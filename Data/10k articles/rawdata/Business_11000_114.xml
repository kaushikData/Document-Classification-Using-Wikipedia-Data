== Biography ==
Pilkington attended [[King Edward VI School, Retford|King Edward VI School]], Retford and received his B.Eng. degree from [[De Montfort University]] in 1987, and his PhD from [[Aston University]] in 1992.&lt;ref name="AP at LI"&gt;Alan Pilkington: Professor at Copenhagen Business School. Linked-in profile. Accessed 20 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduation in 1987 Pilkington started his career in industry as [[project manager]] in manufacturing engineering at the [[Rover Group]], where from 1989 to 1993 he was part of the Manufacturing Policy Unit. In 1996 he returned to academia as [[Associate Professor]] in Operations and Technology Management at the [[Royal Holloway, University of London]], where he stayed until September 2013. Pilkington has been Visiting Scholar at the [[University of California, Davis]] between 1997 and 2003; at the [[University of Western Australia]] between 2003 and 2005; and at [[Cesar Ritz Colleges]] in 2011–12. In 2009 he became Adjunct Professor at the [[Hult International Business School]] in London. In September 2013 he became a Professor at [[Copenhagen Business School]].&lt;ref name="AP at LI"/&gt; Since 2015 he has been Professor of Technology Management at [[Westminster Business School]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.westminster.ac.uk/about-us/our-people/directory/pilkington-alan|title=Pilkington, Professor Alan - About us - University of Westminster, London|website=www.westminster.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[IEEE]] Pilkington chairs the [[IEEE Technology Management Council]] for the UK and Republic of Ireland joint Chapter on Engineering Management.&lt;ref name="AP at LI"/&gt;

== Work ==
Pilkington research interests are in the field of [[enterprise engineering]] and [[innovation]], particularly [[disruptive innovation]].

=== Innovation ===
Pilkington's approach to innovation concerned "product of individual, organisational and knowledge trajectories". His idea was that "modelling the relationships between observed typologies within each of these spheres, conditions for successful innovation can be identified and failures explained. This work is leading to tools which will help managers define successful and achievable technology strategies."&lt;ref name="AP at RH"&gt;[http://pure.rhul.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/alan-pilkington_ff819cf3-759f-4440-81df-3944e25b72fb.html Alan Pilkington], at Royal Holloway, University of London&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Enterprise Engineering ===
Pilkington has initiated and directed the Pilkington research in [[Enterprise Engineering]] at [[Royal Holloway]]. According to Pilkington (2008/13):
:''Enterprise Engineering is the application of engineering principles to the management of enterprises. It encompasses the application of knowledge, principles, and disciplines related to the analysis, design, implementation and operation of all elements associated with an enterprise.&lt;br/&gt; In essence it is an interdisciplinary field which combines systems engineering and strategic management as it seeks to engineer the entire enterprise in terms of the products, processes and business operations. The view is one of continuous improvement and continued adaptation as firms, processes and markets develop along their life cycles. This total systems approach encompasses the traditional areas of research and development, product design, operations and manufacturing as well as information systems and strategic management.''&lt;ref name="EE at RH, 2013"/&gt;

This Enterprise Engineering research had focussed on five types of management specialties:&lt;ref name="EE at RH, 2013"/&gt;
* [[Engineering Management]] : the application of engineering principles to business practice. It brings together the technological problem-solving savvy of engineering and the organizational, administrative, and planning abilities of management to oversee complex enterprises from conception to completion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.allengineeringschools.com/engineering-degree/all-degrees/engineering-management/california |title=Archived copy |access-date=10 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903184234/http://www.allengineeringschools.com/engineering-degree/all-degrees/engineering-management/california |archive-date=3 September 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Innovation Management]] : discipline of managing processes in innovation. It can be used to develop both product and organizational innovation. Innovation management includes a set of tools that allow managers and engineers to co-operate with a common understanding of goals and processes.
* [[Operations Management]] : area of management concerned with overseeing, designing, and controlling the process of production and redesigning business operations in the production of goods or services.
* [[Service Management]] : integrated part of [[supply chain management]], the intersection between the actual sales and the customer. The aim of high performance service management is to optimise the service-intensive supply chains, which are usually more complex than the typical finished-goods supply chain. 
* [[Technology Management]] : set of management disciplines that allows organisations to manage their technological fundamentals to create competitive advantage. Typical concepts used in technology management are technology strategy (a logic or role of technology in organisation), technology forecasting (identification of possible relevant technologies for the organisation)
At Royal Holloway&lt;ref name="EE at RH, 2013"/&gt; more specific topics of research in this field concerned [[Alternative fuel]] Technology, [[Bibliometrics]] and Patent analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Pilkington, Alan, Romano Dyerson, and Omid Tissier. "The electric vehicle:: Patent data as indicators of technological development." World Patent Information 24.1 (2002): 5–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications ==
Pilkington has authored and co-authored numerous publications in the field of Management of technology, Operations management, Manufacturing strategy and Enterprise engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoogleScholar|id=1HlIgBgAAAAJ|name=Alan Pilkington}}&lt;/ref&gt; A selection:
* Pilkington, Alan. "Manufacturing strategy regained: evidence for the demise of best-practice." California Management Review 41 (1998): 31–42.
* Pilkington, Alan, and [[Catherine Liston-Heyes]]. "Is production and operations management a discipline? A citation/co-citation study." International Journal of Operations &amp; Production Management 19.1 (1999): 7–20.
* Pilkington, Alan, Romano Dyerson, and Omid Tissier. "The electric vehicle:: Patent data as indicators of technological development." World Patent Information 24.1 (2002): 5–12.
* Pilkington, Alan, and [[Thorsten Teichert]]. "Management of technology: themes, concepts and relationships." Technovation 26.3 (2006): 288–299.
* Pilkington, Alan, and [[Jack R. Meredith]]. "The evolution of the intellectual structure of operations management—1980–2006: A citation/co-citation analysis." Journal of Operations Management 27.3 (2009): 185–202.

'''Andrey Melnichenko''' ({{lang-ru|Андрей Игоревич Мельниченко}}, {{lang-be|Андрэй Мельнічэнка}}, born 8 March 1972 in [[Gomel]], [[Belarus]]) is a self-made [[Russia]]n industrialist and philanthropist&lt;ref name="forbes" /&gt;.
 
He is the main beneficiary of fertilizer producer [[EuroChem|EuroChem Group]], coal producer [[Siberian Coal Energy Company|SUEK]], and power generator SGC&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aimfoundation.info/page0001#amen|title=About the Foundation: Andrey Melnichenko|last=|first=|date=|website=aimfoundation.info|access-date=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;. He is the Chairman of the Strategy Committees (Non-Executive Director) in all three companies. With an estimated personal wealth of $15.5 billion, in 2018 he ranked 88th in the [[Forbes]] World's billionaires list (7th in Russia).&lt;ref name=forbes&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/profile/andrey-melnichenko/ Biography Andrey Melnichenko], ''Forbes'', February 2017&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bloomberg, as of September 2018, Melnichenko's net worth is estimated at $15.9 billion (67th in the world, 5th in Russia).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/andrey-melnichenko/|title=Andrey Melnichenko|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Bloomberg|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=15 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Too young to gain from the 1990s privatizations that made many oligarch's fortunes, he began trading currency with two friends while a physics student at Moscow State University, taking advantage of the unique opportunities that opened up in a newly capitalist Russia&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. After the Soviet Union fell, the trio registered a bank, before Melnichenko began buying assets including in thermal coal and fertilizers. Branching out at the turn of the millennium, he took an interest in the commodities markets with the acquisition of plants and mines, many of which were distressed, transforming them into modern enterprises. He sold his banking interests in 2007, just before the global financial crisis, allowing him to focus on those industrial investments. Melnichenko turned EuroChem into Russia's largest manufacturer of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers and one of largest fertilizers exporters globally, and SUEK into one of the world's largest coal companies that produces higher-quality thermal coal&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;. 

Melnichenko is one of the main social investors and philanthropists in Russia&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.donorsforum.ru/projects/lkb/proekt-2016/pobediteli-renkinga-2016/|title=Winners 2016 / Leaders of Corporate Philanthropy|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Apart from his companies' own charitable and social investment programs, the [[Andrey Melnichenko Foundation]] runs projects in science and education, supporting gifted children from the regions where his companies operate aiming to create social mobility in Russia&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. Melnichenko's companies reportedly spent over $400 million on social and charitable projects in Russia in the last decade&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;.

==Early life and education==
Andrey Melnichenko was born on March 8, 1972 in Gomel, Belarus. His parents were teachers. As a gifted student, he attended the Advanced Education and Science Centre of the [[Moscow State University|Lomonosov Moscow State University]], and in 1989, became a student of the Faculty of Physics at [[Moscow State University]]. He then transferred to the [[Plekhanov Russian University of Economics]], from which he graduated in Finance&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|title=Andrey Melnichenko Didn't Miss His Once-in-a-Lifetime Opportunity|url=http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/08/26/andrey-melnichenko-from-college-dropout-to-one-of.aspx|website=The Motley Fool|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Career history ==

=== Banking and investments ===
While at university, Melnichenko began his entrepreneurial ventures opening a currency exchange booth on the campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/andrey-melnichenko/|title=The World's Billionaires: Andrey Melnichenko|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having made their first US$50,000 through a chain of the currency exchange booths, Melnichenko and his partners, two like-minded fellow students, received a banking licence from the Bank of Russia. In 1993, at the age of 21, Melnichenko co-founded the [[MDM Bank]] which grew to become one of Russia's largest private banks within ten years. The bank moved onto buying currency at the interbank foreign exchange, developing a derivatives market and debt instruments&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. From 1993 to 1997, Melnichenko chaired the Board of Directors of MDM Bank&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=22864661&amp;privcapId=231846677&amp;previousCapId=231846677&amp;previousTitle=SUEK%20LTD.|title=Andrey Igorevich Melnichenko: Executive Profile &amp; Biography - Bloomberg|website=www.bloomberg.com|access-date=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;. From the late 1990s to the early 2000s, MDM Bank expanded through acquisition, integrating seven regional banks. MDM Bank did not participate in any post-Soviet privatization programs or the loans-for-shares auctions of the 1990s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-29/young-russian-billionaire-seeks-plain-sailing-in-commodity-waves|title=A Young Russian Billionaire Plants the Seeds of Future Success|date=2016-09-29|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2018-02-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Euro am Sonntag, 26th April 2008" /&gt; In 1997, Melnichenko bought out MDM Bank shares from his partners and became the sole shareholder of the Bank and the Chairman of the Management Board. It gradually became one of Russia's largest private banks, based on total assets, and the first in book running of Russian corporate Eurobonds&lt;ref name="Euro am Sonntag, 26th April 2008"&gt;Euro am Sonntag, 26 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;. From 2001 to 2005, he chaired MDM Bank's Board of Directors&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;. MDM Bank was named the "Bank of the Year" by [[The Banker]] in 2002 and 2003. In 2003, [[Euromoney]] and, in 2004, [[Global Finance (magazine)|Global Finance]], named it the “Best Russian Bank”&lt;ref name="Euro am Sonntag, 26th April 2008" /&gt;.

In 2000, Melnichenko, together with [[Sergei Viktorovich Popov|Sergei Popov]], a former metals trader from Ural, co-founded the MDM Group for industrial investments into three areas: pipeline manufacturing, coal production and processing, production and processing of fertilizers&lt;ref name="forbes" /&gt;. It was done through the acquisition of more than 50 independently-run and -owned businesses: joint-stock companies, plants and mines, which enabled to form three separate companies: [[Siberian Coal Energy Company|SUEK]], [[EuroChem]] and TMK (which he exited in 2006 through an IPO at the London Stock Exchange)&lt;ref&gt;TMK-Group {{cite web|url=http://www.tmk-group.com/invest_faq.php#_-On_which_stock|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224032618/http://tmk-group.com/invest_faq.php|archivedate=24 February 2009|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2009-03-26|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These industries were derelict and risky and not subject to the political influence that dominated other sectors&lt;ref name="Euro am Sonntag, 26th April 2008" /&gt;. With the process of post-Soviet era privatizations having finished five years earlier, no more than 5% of the assets purchased were acquired from the state&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. From 2001 to 2004, Melnichenko was the President of the MDM Group&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;. 

From 2004 to 2007, Melnichenko sold shares of MDM Bank to his MDM Group partner [[Sergei Viktorovich Popov|Sergei Popov]], and focused on the development of the industrial assets in fertilizers and coal.&lt;ref name="forbes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea-coal.org.uk/site/2010/news-section/news-items/russia-interview-with-suek-owner-mr-andrey-melnichenko?|title=Russia: Interview with SUEK owner, Mr. Andrey Melnichenko|website=IEA News Centre|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160512181519/http://www.iea-coal.org.uk/site/2010/news-section/news-items/russia-interview-with-suek-owner-mr-andrey-melnichenko|archivedate=12 May 2016|deadurl=yes|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Global Finance named it the “Best Russian Bank” in four categories: corporate management, FOREX, the best organizer of Eurobond loans in the Russian market, and the best consultant in the Russian M&amp;A market. Following Melnichenko's decision to step down from MDM Bank in 2007, the International Financial Corporation (IFC) purchased 5% of MDM Bank shares for US$185 million, valuing the bank at US$3.7 billion&lt;ref name="Euro am Sonntag, 26th April 2008" /&gt;. Having served its consolidating purpose, MDM Group ceased to exist.

=== EuroChem ===
Andrey Melnichenko became the Chairman of the Board of Directors mineral and chemical company OJSC [[EuroChem]] in April 2004&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;. In 2007, he became EuroChem's majority shareholder&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.  

When EuroChem was founded, the purchased assets included several nitrogen plants and a phosphate mine with Soviet-era equipment. Melnichenko built EuroChem to become one of the world's largest high-tech fertilizer manufacturers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eurochemgroup.com/en/eurochem-in-the-news/|title=SNL Financial - Eurochem's expansion into mining could double company size, boost it to top 5 potash player|last=Ben|first=Seeder|date=|website=www.eurochemgroup.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

One of EuroChem's key enterprises, Novomoskovsky Azot, became the largest urea plant in Europe, where production of granulated urea began for the first time in Russia. New modern manufacturing facilities were built in Nevinnomyssk (including the first melamine production plant in Russia) and Kovdor (including an apatite and shtaffelite ores processing complex). Modern terminal was launched in Sillamae (Estonia), and Murmansk port was rebuilt. It acquired laboratories in Germany in 2011, which led to creation of similar facilities in Russia, Ukraine, and other countries, which are working on the development of second-generation fertilizers, including advanced slow-release products that help reduce the environmental footprint of the agricultural sector&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eurochemgroup.com/en/who-we-are/history/|title=History – EuroChem|website=www.eurochemgroup.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

EuroChem bought licenses for potash deposits in Volgograd (2005) and Perm (2008), launching plans to develop two large potash industrial plants&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;. 

In 2015, EuroChem moved its headquarters to Switzerland for access to the capital markets and international operations. It has manufacturing, logistic and distributing facilities in Russia, Belgium, Lithuania, Estonia, China, Germany, Kazakhstan, and the USA&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;. EuroChem products are sold in more than 100 countries. EuroChem Group has raised funds on the international capital markets. In 2016, EuroChem invested in biological crop nutrition company Agrinos to invest in research and development for a new generation of products. Elsewhere, EuroChem expanded its distribution network, buying operations in the US, Argentina, Brazil and Hungary. It is developing second-generation fertilizers, including advanced slow-release products that help reduce the environmental footprint of the agricultural sector. One EuroChem fertilizer, Entec 26, became the only such product to be recognized by a carbon exchange foundation in Switzerland, marking the first time that the contribution of advanced fertilizers to reducing agricultural emissions was acknowledged.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eurochemgroup.com/en/press-releases/agrinos-and-eurochem-sign-equity-investment-and-two-collaboration-agreements/|title=Agrinos and EuroChem sign equity investment and two collaboration agreements – EuroChem|website=www.eurochemgroup.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eurochemgroup.com/en/our-world/|title=Global Fertilizer Day – EuroChem|website=www.eurochemgroup.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

EuroChem is Russia's largest manufacturer of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers and one of largest fertilizers exporters globally&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;. It produces higher-value specialty fertilizers including inhibitor products that allow slow release of nutrients into crops, and is launching two Russian potash mines planning to produce 8 million metric tons of the fertilizer a year, a 10th of current world output, as well as eyeing an ammonia and urea plant in Louisiana. According to Melnichenko, EuroChem aims to transform itself "into a company that creates and promotes high-tech products"&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eurochemgroup.com/en/at-a-glance-2/|title=At a glance – EuroChem|website=www.eurochemgroup.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eurochemgroup.com/en/press-releases/eurochem-announces-fertiliser-project-in-louisiana/|title=EuroChem announces fertiliser project in Louisiana – EuroChem|website=www.eurochemgroup.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Since April 2015, Andrey Melnichenko is the Chairman of the Strategy Committee (Non-Executive Director) of EuroChem Group AG&lt;ref name="EuroChem Board &amp; Management"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurochemgroup.com/en/board-managment/|title=EuroChem Board &amp; Management|last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As of 2018, Melnichenko controls 90 percent of EuroChem&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.

=== SUEK ===
Andrey Melnichenko became Member of the Board of Directors of [[Siberian Coal Energy Company|SUEK]] JSC (Siberian Coal Energy Company) in February 2005, and the Chairman of the Board of Directors in June 2011&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;. The same year, he created the Siberian Generating Company (SGC) on the basis of electricity assets of SUEK and became the Chairman of its Board of Directors. In 2013, he became the primary shareholder of SUEK and SGC after he has bought his ex-partner's shares&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.  

The assets that formed SUEK were distressed – production capacity was less than 30 million tons per year, the enterprises employed 70,000 miners yet productivity was low, and virtually none of its output was exported. The average equipment depreciation was 90%. During the early years of the business, SUEK's assets were modernized, debts were repaid, wages and taxes were paid, and a modernization program was launched with new machinery. The old mines and worn-out equipment were transformed into modern enterprises. Several enrichment factories and modules were put into operation with the latest processing technologies that allowed SUEK to produce highly enriched coal with low impurity levels. SUEK built modern coal bulk terminals and upgraded seaports, and built Russia's first coal mine methane processing station to generate power within the framework of the Kyoto Protocol. Russia's first smart mining management control center was built to run all SUEK's operations, monitoring the location and well-being of miners working underground&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.suek.com/about-us/history/|title=SUEK - History|last=|first=|date=|website=www.suek.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

After the consolidation of electric power assets, Melnichenko created the Siberian Generating Company (SGC) as a part of SUEK, and then spun it out as a separate company. SGC provides between 35% and 78% of electrical power in the Russian regions of its operation. It is the fourth largest heat producer in the world&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.

Melnichenko led SUEK to become Russia's largest coal producer with operations in seven Russian regions, as well as the world's third largest coal exporter by reserves and sales with distribution in 38 countries worldwide, including the Asia Pacific where coal plays a key role in energy access. SUEK assets produce more than 100 million tons of coal annually, with assured coal reserves of 5.4 billion tons. SUEK is Russia's largest coal producer and a global leader in exporting higher-quality thermal coal. As reported in Financial Times in 2017, according to the International Energy Agency's Clean Coal Centre, "SUEK, Russia's main exporter of higher-quality thermal coal, has invested in modern high-capacity washing plants and has ash control technologies at all its coal ports".&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/79394d9e-d07a-11e7-9dbb-291a884dd8c6|title=Clean coal is part of the answer to the Paris Agreement|last=|first=|date=|website=Financial Times|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bloomberg, SUEK is Russia's largest producer of higher quality thermal coal which, according to Melnichenko, focusses on “high-quality and less-emitting coal”&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.suek.com/media/Melnichenko-in-media/suek-owner-says-fossil-fuels-won-t-be-replaced-by-alternatives/|title=Bloomberg: SUEK owner says fossil fuels won’t be replaced by alternatives|last=|first=|date=|website=www.suek.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Andrey Melnichenko is the main beneficiary of SUEK and SGC. As of 2018, he owns 92.2 percent stake in SUEK and 92.2 percent of SGC&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.

'''Business performance management''' is a set of [[performance management]] and analytic processes that enables the [[management]] of an [[organization's performance]] to achieve one or more pre-selected goals. Synonyms for "business performance management" include '''"corporate performance management (CPM)"'''&lt;ref&gt;"Introducing the CPM Suites Magic Quadrant", Lee Geishecker and [[Frank Buytendijk]], 2 October 2002, www.gartner.com, M-17-4718&lt;/ref&gt; and '''"enterprise performance management"'''.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Business performance management is contained within approaches to [[business process management]].&lt;ref&gt;vom Brocke, J. &amp; Rosemann, M. (2010), [http://www.bpm-handbook.com Handbook on Business Process Management: Strategic Alignment, Governance, People and Culture] (International Handbooks on Information Systems). Berlin: Springer&lt;/ref&gt;

Business performance management has three main activities:
# selection of goals
# [[data consolidation|consolidation]] of measurement information relevant to an organization’s progress against these goals
# interventions made by managers in light of this information with a view to improving future performance against these goals

Although presented here sequentially, typically all three activities will run concurrently, with interventions by managers affecting the choice of goals, the measurement information monitored, and the activities being undertaken by the organization.

Because business performance management activities in large organizations often involve the collection and reporting of large volumes of data, many software vendors, particularly those offering [[business intelligence]] tools, market products intended to assist in this process. As a result of this marketing effort, business performance management is often incorrectly understood as an activity that necessarily relies on software systems to work, and many definitions of business performance management explicitly suggest software as being a definitive component of the approach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bpmmag.net/magazine/article.html?articleID=13966 BPM Mag, What is BPM?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061212062646/http://www.bpmmag.net/magazine/article.html?articleID=13966 |date=December 12, 2006 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

This interest in business performance management from the software community is sales-driven{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} - "The biggest growth area in operational BI analysis is in the area of business performance management."&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1992, business performance management has been strongly influenced by the rise of the [[Balanced Scorecard|balanced scorecard]] framework. It is common for managers to use the balanced scorecard framework to clarify the goals of an organization, to identify how to track them, and to structure the mechanisms by which interventions will be triggered. These steps are the same as those that are found in BPM, and as a result, balanced scorecard is often used as the basis for business performance management activity with organizations.{{Citation needed|date = September 2010}}

{{as of | 2009 | alt = In the past}}, owners have sought to drive strategy down and across their organizations, transform these strategies into actionable metrics, and use analytics to expose the cause-and-effect relationships that, if understood, could give insight into decision-making.

== History ==
Reference to non-[[business]] performance management occurs{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} in [[Sun Tzu]]'s ''[[The Art of War]]''. Sun Tzu claims that to succeed in war, one should have full knowledge of one's own strengths and weaknesses as well as those of one's enemies. Lack of either set of knowledge might result in defeat.&lt;ref&gt;http://ctext.org/art-of-war/attack-by-stratagem/zh?en=on#n20929  paragraph 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Parallels between the challenges in business and those of war include{{Citation needed | date=January 2009}}:

* collecting data - both internal and external
* discerning patterns and meaning in the data (analyzing)
* responding to the resultant information

Prior to the start of the [[Information Age]] in the late 20th century, businesses sometimes took the trouble to laboriously collect data from non-automated sources. As they lacked computing resources to properly analyze the data, they often made commercial decisions primarily on the basis of [[intuition (knowledge)|intuition]].

As businesses started automating more and more systems, more and more data became available. However, collection often remained a challenge due to a lack of infrastructure for data exchange or due to incompatibilities between systems. Reports on the data gathered sometimes took months to generate. Such reports allowed informed long-term strategic decision-making. However, short-term tactical decision-making often continued to rely on intuition.

In 1989 [[Howard Dresner]], a research analyst at [[Gartner]], popularized "[[business intelligence]]" (BI) as an umbrella term to describe a set of concepts and methods to improve business decision-making by using fact-based support systems. Performance management builds on a foundation of BI, but marries it to the planning-and-control cycle of the enterprise with enterprise planning, consolidation, and modeling capabilities.

Increasing standards, automation, and technologies have led to vast amounts of data becoming available. [[Data warehouse]] technologies have allowed the building of repositories to store this data. Improved [[Extract, transform, load|ETL]] and [[enterprise application integration]] tools have increased the timely collecting of data. [[Online analytical processing|OLAP]] reporting technologies have allowed faster generation of new reports which analyze the data. {{As of | 2010}}, business intelligence has become the art of sieving through large amounts of data, extracting useful information and turning that information into actionable knowledge.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

== Definition and scope ==
Business performance management consists of a set of management and analytic processes, supported by technology, that enable businesses to define strategic goals and then measure and manage performance against those goals. Core business performance management processes include [[Financial planning (business)|financial planning]], operational planning, business modeling, consolidation and reporting, analysis, and monitoring of [[key performance indicator]]s linked to strategy.

Business performance management involves [[data consolidation|consolidation of data]] from various sources, querying, and analysis of the data, and putting the results into practice.

== Frameworks ==
Various frameworks for implementing business performance management exist. The discipline gives companies a top-down framework by which to align planning and execution, strategy and tactics, and [[business-unit]] and enterprise objectives. Reactions may include the [[Six Sigma]] strategy, [[balanced scorecard]], [[activity-based costing]] (ABC), [[OKR | Objectives and Key Results]] (OKR), [[Total Quality Management]], [[Economic value added|economic value-add]], [[integrated strategic measurement]] and [[Theory of Constraints]].

== Metrics and key performance indicators ==
Some of the areas from which bank management may gain knowledge by using business performance management include:

* customer-related numbers:
** new customers acquired
** status of existing customers
** attrition of customers (including breakup by reason for attrition)
* turnover generated by segments of the customers - possibly using demographic filters
* outstanding balances held by segments of customers and terms of payment - possibly using demographic filters
* collection of bad debts within customer relationships
* [[demographic analysis]] of individuals (potential customers) applying to become customers, and the levels of approval, rejections and pending numbers
* delinquency analysis of customers behind on payments
* [[Profit (accounting)|profitability]] of customers by demographic segments and segmentation of customers by profitability
* [[marketing campaign|campaign]] management
* [[Real time (media)|real-time]] [[Dashboard (business)|dashboard]] on key operational metrics
** [[overall equipment effectiveness]]
* [[clickstream]] analysis on a website
* key product portfolio trackers
* [[marketing channel|marketing-channel]] analysis
* [[sales]]-data analysis by product segments
* [[callcenter]] metrics

Though the above list describes what a bank might monitor, it could refer to a telephone company or to a similar service-sector company.

Items of generic importance include:

# consistent and correct KPI-related data providing insights into operational aspects of a company
# timely availability of KPI-related data
# KPIs designed to directly reflect the efficiency and effectiveness of a business
# information presented in a format which aids decision-making for management and decision-makers
# ability to discern patterns or trends from organized information

Business performance management integrates the company's processes with [[customer relationship management|CRM]] or {{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} [[enterprise resource planning|ERP]]. Companies should become better able to gauge [[customer satisfaction]], control customer trends and influence shareholder value.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

==Application software types==
People working in business intelligence have developed tools that ease the work of business performance management, especially when the business-intelligence task involves gathering and analyzing large amounts of unstructured [[data]].

Tool categories commonly used for business performance management include:

* [[MOLAP]] &amp;mdash; Multidimensional online analytical processing, sometimes simply called "analytics" (based on [[dimensional analysis]] and the so-called "hypercube" or "cube")
* [[Balanced scorecard|scorecarding]], [[Dashboards (management information systems)|dashboarding]] and [[data visualization]]
* [[data warehouse]]s
* [[document warehouse]]s
* [[text mining]]
* DM &amp;mdash; [[data mining]]
&lt;!--  * BPM — Business performance management --&gt;
* BPO &amp;mdash; business performance optimization
* EPM &amp;mdash; [[enterprise performance management]]
* EIS &amp;mdash; [[executive information system]]s
* DSS &amp;mdash; [[decision support system]]s
* MIS &amp;mdash; [[management information system]]s
* SEMS &amp;mdash; [[strategic enterprise management]] software
* EOI &amp;mdash; [[Operational intelligence]] Enterprise Operational Intelligence Software

== Design and implementation ==
Questions asked when implementing a business performance management program include:

* '''Goal-alignment queries'''
:Determine the short- and medium-term purpose of the program. What strategic goal(s) of the organization will the program address? What organizational mission/vision does it relate to? A hypothesis needs to be crafted that details how this initiative will eventually improve results / performance (i.e. a [[strategy map]]).
* '''Baseline queries'''
:Assess current information-gathering competency. Does the organization have the capability to monitor important sources of information? What data is being collected and how is it being stored? What are the statistical parameters of this data, e.g., how much random variation does it contain? Is this being measured?
* '''Cost and risk queries'''
:Estimate the financial consequences of a new BI initiative. Assess the cost of the present operations and the increase in costs associated with the BPM initiative. What is the risk that the initiative will fail? This risk assessment should be converted into a financial metric and included in the planning.
* '''Customer and stakeholder queries'''
:Determine who will benefit from the initiative and who will pay. Who has a stake in the current procedure? What kinds of customers / stakeholders will benefit directly from this initiative? Who will benefit indirectly? What quantitative / qualitative benefits follow? Is the specified initiative the best or only way to increase satisfaction for all kinds of customers? How will customer benefits be monitored? What about employees, shareholders, and distribution channel members?
* '''Metrics-related queries'''
:Information requirements need [[operationalization]] into clearly defined metrics. Decide which metrics to use for each piece of information being gathered. Are these the best metrics and why? How many metrics need to be tracked? If this is a large number (it usually is), what kind of system can track them? Are the metrics standardized, so they can be [[benchmarking|benchmarked]] against performance in other organizations? What are the industry standard metrics available?
* '''Measurement methodology-related queries'''
:Establish a methodology or a procedure to determine the best (or acceptable) way of measuring the required metrics. How frequently will data be collected? Are there any industry standards for this? Is this the best way to do the measurements? How do we know that?
* '''Results-related queries'''
:Monitor the BPM program to ensure that it meets objectives. The program itself may require adjusting. The program should be tested for accuracy, [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]], and [[Validity (statistics)|validity]]. How can it be demonstrated that the BI initiative, and not something else, contributed to a change in results? How much of the change was probably random?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9312">A '''business rule''' defines or constrains some aspect of [[business]] and always resolves to either true or false. Business rules are intended to assert business structure or to control or influence the behavior of the business.&lt;ref name="BRG1" /&gt; Business rules describe the operations, definitions and constraints that apply to an organization.  Business rules can apply to people, processes, corporate behavior and computing systems in an organization, and are put in place to help the organization achieve its goals.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

For example, a business rule might state that ''no credit check is to be performed on return customers''.  Other examples of business rules include requiring a rental agent to disallow a rental tenant if their credit rating is too low, or requiring company agents to use a list of preferred suppliers and supply schedules.

While a business rule may be informal or even unwritten, documenting the rules clearly and making sure that they don't conflict is a valuable activity.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}  When carefully managed, rules can be used to help the organization to better achieve goals, remove obstacles to market growth, reduce costly mistakes, improve communication, comply with legal requirements, and increase customer loyalty.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

==Introduction==
'''Business rules'''  tell an organization ''what'' it can do in detail, while strategy tells it ''how'' to focus the business at a macro level to optimize results.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} Put differently, a strategy provides high-level direction about what an organization should do. Business rules provide detailed guidance about how a strategy can be translated to action.

Business rules exist for an organization whether or not they are ever written down, talked about or even part of the organization's consciousness.  However it is a fairly common practice for organizations to gather business rules.  This may happen in one of two ways.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Organizations may choose to proactively describe their business practices, producing a database of rules.  While this activity may be beneficial, it may be expensive and time-consuming.  For example, they might hire a consultant to comb through the organization to document and consolidate the various standards and methods currently in practice.

Gathering business rules is also called rules harvesting or [[business rule mining]]. The [[business analyst]] or consultant can extract the rules from IT documentation (like use cases, specifications or system code).  They may also organize workshops and interviews with subject matter experts (commonly abbreviated as SMEs). Software technologies designed to capture business rules through analysis of legacy source code or of actual user behavior can accelerate the rule gathering processing.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

More commonly, business rules are discovered and documented informally during the initial stages of a project.  In this case the collecting of the business rules is incidental.  In addition, business projects, such as the launching of a new product or the re-engineering of a complex process, might lead to the definition of new business rules.  This practice of incidental, or emergent, business rule gathering is vulnerable to the creation of inconsistent or even conflicting business rules within different organizational units, or within the same organizational unit over time. This inconsistency creates problems that can be difficult to find and fix.

Allowing business rules to be documented during the course of business projects is less expensive and easier to accomplish than the first approach{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}, but if the rules are not collected in a consistent manner, they are not valuable.  In order to teach business people about the best ways to gather and document business rules, experts in business analysis have created the [[business rules approach|Business Rules Methodology]].  This methodology defines a process of capturing business rules in natural language, in a verifiable and understandable way.  This process is not difficult to learn, can be performed in real-time, and empowers business stakeholders to manage their own business rules in a consistent manner.

== Categories ==

According to the white paper by the Business Rules Group,&lt;ref name="BRG1"&gt;Business Rules Group, ''Defining Business Rules ~ What Are They Really?'', [http://www.businessrulesgroup.org/first_paper/br01c0.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; a statement of a business rule falls into one of four categories:
*Definitions of business terms
The most basic element of a business rule is the language used to express it. The very definition of a term is itself a business rule that describes how people think and talk about things. Thus, defining a term is establishing a category of business rule. Terms have traditionally been documented in a [[Glossary]] or as entities in a [[Conceptual schema|conceptual model]].

*Facts relating terms to each other
The nature or operating structure of an organization can be described in terms of the facts that relate terms to each other. To say that a customer can place an order is NOT a business rule, but a ''fact''. '''Facts''' can be documented as natural language sentences or as relationships, attributes, and generalization structures in a graphical model.

*Constraints (also called "action assertions")
Every enterprise constrains behavior in some way, and this is closely related to constraints on what data may or may not be updated. To prevent a record from being made is, in many cases, to prevent an action from taking place.

*Derivations
Business rules (including laws of nature) define how [[knowledge]] in one form may be transformed into other knowledge, possibly in a different form.

== Real world applications and obstacles ==

Business rules are gathered in these situations: 
# When dictated by law
# During the [[business analysis]]
# As an [[ephemeral]] [[aid]] to engineers.
  
This lack of consistent approach is mostly due to the cost and effort required to maintain the list of rules.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

While newer software tools are able to combine business rule management and execution, it is important to realize that these two ideas are distinct, and each provides value that is different from the other.  Software packages automate business rules using [[business logic]].  The term ''business rule'' is sometimes used interchangeably with ''business logic''; however the latter connotes an engineering practice and the former an intrinsic business practice{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}.  There is value in outlining an organization's business rules regardless of whether this information is used to automate its operations.

One of the pitfalls in trying to fill the gap between rules management and execution is trying to give business rules the syntax of logic, and merely describing logical constructs in a natural language. Translation for engines is easier, but business users will no longer be able to write down the rules.

== Formal specification ==

Business rules can be expressed using modeling approaches such as [[Unified Modeling Language]], [[Z notation]], [[Business Process Execution Language]], [[Business Process Modeling Notation]], [[Decision Model and Notation]] or the [[Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules]] (SBVR).{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Business rules encoded in computer code in an operational program are known as [[business logic]].

Similar to how [[Business Risks]] can be structured as:

If &lt;condition(s)&gt; Then &lt;consequence(s)&gt;

a Business Rule can be structured as:

When &lt;condition(s)&gt; Then &lt;imposition(s)&gt; Otherwise &lt;consequence(s)&gt;

[[Image:Carsten Anker 2.jpg|thumb|Statue of Carsten Anker, 1869]]
'''Carsten Tank Anker''' (17 November 1747 – 13 March 1824) was a Norwegian businessman, civil servant, politician and one of the Fathers of the Constitution of Norway. He was the owner of the manor house in [[Akershus]] at which the original National Assembly (''[[Riksforsamlingen]]'') of Norway was held. The manor house has since then been given the name ''[[Eidsvollsbygningen]]''.

==Early years==
Born in [[Halden|Frederikshald]], he was the son of the trader Erik Ancher (1709–1785) and cousin of [[Bernt Anker]]. In 1759 Carsten left on a journey abroad that was to last for several years, together with his brother [[Peter Anker|Peter]] and four cousins from [[Oslo|Christiania]]. From 1771 to 1772 he was an envoy from several of the major Norwegian trading companies in [[Stockholm]] to negotiate better conditions for the timber trade on the river [[Klarälven]], without much success. While in [[Sweden]], however, there arose suspicion that he was also working with a secret, political agenda, and when [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustav III]] conducted his coup d'état, Anker was asked by the government in [[Copenhagen]] to return.

==Civil service career==
[[File:Eidsvollsbygninen.jpg|thumb|300 px|[[Eidsvollsbygningen|Eidsvoll Manor]] in Akershus]]
He then started his career as a civil servant. On 10 May 1774 he was appointed secretary in the ''General-Landøkonomi- og [[Kommercekollegiet]]'' (College of General Rural Economy and Commerce), in 1776 he was made ''justisråd'', in 1781 third deputy of the ''Bjærgværksdirektoiret'' (Mining Directory) and in 1784 second deputy. He was given the, mostly honorary, titles of ''etatsråd'' and ''konferensråd'' in 1779 and 1784 respectively, and on 14 January 1779 he was also made a member of the [[Norwegian nobility|nobility]]. When ''Bjærgværksdirektoiret'' was dissolved by royal resolution on 28 January 1791, Anker was given a pension, but kept a position as first director of the so-called ''Realisations-Kommission'' (Realisation Committee). This position entailed among other things special responsibility for the government's Norwegian glassmaking companies. In 1792 he was made first director of ''det dansk-asiatiske Kompagni'' (the Danish-Asian Company), a position he kept until 1811. He also acquired considerable property in Norway by buying the historic Eidsvoll Ironworks (''Eidsvoll Verk''). He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1804.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqSearch=RefNo==%27EC%2F1803%2F06%27&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl |title=Library and Archive Catalogue |publisher=Royal Society |accessdate=13 March 2012 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Time abroad==
As an envoy of  ''det dansk-asiatiske Kompagni'', he stayed in London from January 1805 to take care of the company's business affairs vis-à-vis the English [[Honourable East India Company|East India Company]]. This task he seems to have performed in an excellent manner. In 1807 he carried out a large transaction of money for the government in [[Hamburg]], and finalised a deal in ship timber for the [[Royal Dano-Norwegian Navy|navy]]. In 1811 he took up permanent residence at Eidsvoll Ironworks.

==Friendship with Christian Frederik of Denmark==
During his stay in Copenhagen, he had become an intimate acquaintance of the [[heir presumptive]] to the throne, [[Christian Frederik]]. When the prince arrived in Norway as ''stattholder'' in 1813, Anker was immediately made one of the prince's closest advisors. After the [[Treaty of Kiel]] the prince held a meeting at Eidsvoll during his journey to [[Trondheim]], and on the way back he convened the ''Stormannsmøtet'' (gathering of notables) of Eidsvoll on 16 February 1814, where it was decided that Norway should declare its independence, and that a National Assembly should be convened, also to be held at Eidsvoll.

==National Assembly of 1814==
Before the National Assembly gathered, Anker had left Norway, and could therefore not take up his position in the new Norwegian government, where he was appointed councillor of government for the 5th Ministry (economy) on 2 March, and councillor of state on 19 May. In March 1814 he had crossed the [[North Sea]] to promote Norway's interests in England. Here he worked to put the interests of Sweden and the great powers up against each other, but achieved little. In 1815 he was dismissed as councillor of state, and returned to Norway, where he developed a close relationship to the crown prince [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Karl Johan]].

==Last years==
In the last years of his life Anker's economy was not good; the ironworks was virtually closed down. Yet he continued to administer the government's glassmaking companies, and died during a visit to the glassworks at [[Biri, Norway|Biri]]. He had literary interests, acted as a patron, and had a large collection of manuscripts and books. In 1784 he married Hedvig Caroline Ernestine Christine Wegener (1763–1846).

'''Charles Irénée du Pont''' (March 29, 1797 – January 31, 1869) was an [[United States|American]] [[manufacturer]] and [[politician]], and an early member of the prominent [[du Pont family]] business. He was a nephew of [[Eleuthère Irénée du Pont]], the founder of the [[DuPont|E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company]], and a member of the [[Delaware General Assembly]].

==Early life==
Du Pont was born March 29, 1797, in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], the eldest son of French immigrants [[Victor Marie du Pont|Victor Marie du Pont de Nemours]] (born 1767 in Paris) and Gabrielle Joséphine de la Fite de Pelleport (born 1770 in [[Stenay]]). He lived with his parents in [[New York, New York|New York City]] until they established themselves in the wool manufacturing business at across from the [[Brandywine Creek (Christina River)|Brandywine Creek]] from the [[Eleutherian Mills]] near [[Greenville, Delaware]].

He was educated at Mount Airy College in [[Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Germantown, Philadelphia]], from 1809 to 1813, when he left school to work with his father in Delaware.&lt;ref name="hagley"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Du Pont, Charles I. (Charles Irénée), 1797-1869. Papers, 1807-1892. |publisher=[[Hagley Museum and Library]]|accessdate=January 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional career==

In 1815, the textile manufacturing company of Du Pont, Bauduy &amp; Co. ended acrimoniously. [[:fr:Pierre de Bauduy de Bellevue]], a Frenchman who had invested in the business in 1803, eventually sued the du Ponts over various disagreements. (The lawsuit was decided in the du Pont's favor in 1924.)&lt;ref name="gardner"&gt;{{cite book|title=E. I. Du Pont de Nemours and Company, a History, 1802-1902 |author=Bessie Gardner Du Pont |pages=48–51 |isbn=978-1295712120|year=1920|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Co. |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After de Bauduy's departure, Charles and his father formed the partnership of Victor &amp; Charles I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. After Victor's death in 1827, the firm continued to operate as Charles I. du Pont &amp; Co., with the U.S. Army as a major client for its cloth. Charlies retired in 1856, at which point  E.I. duPont de Nemours &amp; Co. purchased his company.&lt;ref name="hagley" /&gt;

==Civic and political career==

In addition to his business interest, du Pont was very active in civic and political affairs. Du Pont was a member of the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], who served in the [[Delaware Senate|State Senate]] from [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle County]] for four terms in the [[Delaware General Assembly]] from 1841-1847.

He was elected a director of the [[Farmers' Bank of Delaware]] in 1830, and served as president of the bank from 1865-1868. In 1853, he was made director of the Delaware Railroad Company, and was also a director of the [[Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad|Philadelphia, Wilmington &amp; Baltimore Railroad Company]] and the Columbia Insurance Co. of Philadelphia. He was also of the Brandywine Manufacturers' Sunday School and vice president of the Delaware Improvement Association.&lt;ref name="hagley" /&gt;

==Family==

In 1824, du Pont married Dorcas Montgomery Van Dyke (born 1806), daughter of U.S. Senator and Representative [[Nicholas Van Dyke (senator)|Nicholas Van Dyke III]] and granddaughter of Delaware Governor [[Nicholas Van Dyke (governor)|Nicholas Van Dyke, Jr.]]. Their wedding was attended by the [[Marquis de Lafayette]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2293&amp;dat=19490612&amp;id=M-VfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-gIGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1826,1334070 |title=Redletter Nuptials for Van Dyke Girls |work=The Sunday Morning Star |date=June 12, 1949|accessdate=January 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had three children, Victor, Mary Van Dyke and Charles, Jr.

After Dorcas' death in 1838,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.hagley.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15017coll5/id/335 |title=du Pont, Dorcas Montgomery (Van Dyke) (1806-1838) |publisher=[[Hagley Museum and Library]]|accessdate=January 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; he married Ann Ridgely (born 1815). Like his first wife, Ridgely was the daughter of a U.S. Senator and Representative from Delaware, [[Henry M. Ridgely]]. They had two children, Amélia Elizabeth (who married her cousin [[Eugene du Pont]]) and Henry Ridgely.

Du Pont died January 31, 1869, at [[Louviers (Wilmington, Delaware)|Louviers]], his family estate, and is buried at the [[Du Pont de Nemours Cemetery]] at [[Winterthur Museum, Garden and Library|Winterthur]], near Greenville.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4502">A '''chief experience officer''' ('''CXO''') is an executive responsible for the overall experience of an organization's products and services. As [[user experience]] (UX) is quickly becoming a key differentiator in the modern business landscape,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CEO as Chief Experience Officer -|url = http://blog.generalassemb.ly/ceo-chief-experience-officer/|website = GA Blog|access-date = 2016-01-14|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; the CXO is charged with bringing holistic experience design to the boardroom and making it an intrinsic part of the company's strategy and culture.

== Responsibilities ==
A CXO's responsibilities include:
* Corporate leadership in UX strategy
* Software and hardware design management
* Creative reviews and concept development
* Intellectual property positioning and protection
In a piece in UX Magazine, Lis Hubert said the goal of having a CXO is "to have someone responsible for curating and maintaining a holistic user-, business-, and technology-appropriate experience" at the [[C-Suite|C-level]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hubert|first=Lis|title=UX, It's Time to Define CXO|url=http://uxmag.com/articles/ux-its-time-to-define-cxo|publisher=UX Magazine|accessdate=13 January 2013|date=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=January 2013}} Authors Claudia Fisher and  Christine Vallaster state that a CXO or chief marketing officer is a good idea when "the brand is seen as a strategic driver of the organization."&lt;ref name="FisherVallaster2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fisher|first1=Claudia|last2=Vallaster|first2=Christine|title=Connective Branding: Building Brand Equity in a Demanding World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mh-4Iq_YntEC&amp;pg=PA147|accessdate=17 January 2013|date=2010-04-01|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9780470740873|pages=147–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In Healthcare ===

Howard Larkin states that in healthcare, the CXO is "responsible for making sure every aspect of a complex delivery system consistently meets basic patient and human needs" and what it calls "operationalizing the patient experience mission."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Larkin|first=Howard|title=Chief Experience Officer: Listener-in-chief|url=http://www.nonprofithealthcare.org/news/newsview.asp?id=2133|publisher=Hospitals &amp; Health Networks|date=11 Nov 2012|accessdate=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perception of title==
In 2006 the New York Times discussed the role of the chief experience officer in the context of a number of other "unconventional" and "wacky" titles being created by [[Madison Avenue#Advertising industry|Madison Avenue firms]] with the intent to "signal a realization by an advertiser or agency that in a rapidly changing marketing and media landscape, the time for the tried and true has come and gone."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Elliott|first=Stuart|title=Wanted: Experience Officer. Some Necessary.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/13/business/media/13adco.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=13 January 2013|date=13 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wharton Business School has called the proliferation of roles in the C-Suite "Title Inflation",&lt;ref name="CoomberWoods2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coomber|first1=Steve|last2=Woods|first2=Marc|title=Where Do All the Paperclips Go: ...and 127 other business and career conundrums|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ezRwOzXhUxkC&amp;pg=PA99|accessdate=17 January 2013|date=2008-06-10|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781906465001|pages=99–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Herman and Giola warn about the "dangerous side effects" of "job title invention".&lt;ref name="Futurist"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Futurist|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CwVmAAAAMAAJ|year=2000|publisher=World Future Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related positions ==
In a 2012 publication, it was reported that "[[chief customer officer]]" (30%) and "chief client officer" (15%) were more commonly used for the role than "chief experience officer" (10%), with 45% utilizing other variations.&lt;ref name="ManningBodine2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Manning|first1=Harley|last2=Bodine|first2=Kerry|title=Outside In: The Power of Putting Customers at the Center of Your Business|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zBy2a9bMfXYC&amp;pg=PA186|accessdate=17 January 2013|date=2012-08-28|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=9780547913988|pages=186–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Chopourian v. Catholic Healthcare West''''', Case No. 2:09-CV-02972-KJM-KJN (E.D. Cal. Feb. 28, 2012), was a court case in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California which, at the time, was believed to be the largest single-plaintiff employment verdict in United States history at $167,720,488.&lt;ref&gt;http://abcnews.go.com/US/LegalCenter/168-million-awarded-woman-harassed-raunchy-cardiac-surgery/story?id=15835342&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.workplacebullying.org/168mil/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAkDb_MKds4&lt;/ref&gt; The record has since been surpassed by the verdict in [[Juarez v.

==Background and Trial==
Ani Chopourian was employed as a Physician Assistant by [[Dignity Health|Catholic Healthcare West]] (now [[Dignity Health]]), Mercy General Hospital in the Cardio Vascular Operating Rooms (“CVOR”) from August 2006 to August 2008. A graduate of Yale University School of Medicine Physician Associates Program in 1999, Ms. Chopourian had been nationally certified by the National Commission on Certification of Physician Assistants since initially obtaining her license in 1999. As a Physician Assistant in the CVOR, Ms. Chopourian’s job responsibilities included the treatment and care for patients undergoing a variety of open heart surgeries including, but not limited to: Coronary Artery Bypass, Aortic/Mitral Valve Replacement, and Congenital Heart Defect Repair. In furtherance of this work, Ms. Chopourian supported heart surgery procedures by providing a number of important functions, including vein/artery harvesting, retraction of the sternum, and other technical functions to assist the heart surgeon. During her employment, Ms. Chopourian worked with numerous different heart surgeons in four different operating rooms in two separate facilities. 

Within months of her employment, in or around October 2006, Ms. Chopourian spoke to her supervisor, Jean Scrafton, about the fact that she was not getting her meal breaks. Ms. Chopourian explained that, as a result of not being able to eat within the first five hours of her shift, she would feel lightheaded and was concerned her performance was being affected. Ms. Chopourian also made a written complaint about this fact in an “Event Report.” In addition to her complaints about lunch breaks, Ms. Chopourian submitted at least 18 written complaints to hospital managers concerning the working conditions in the hospital, including failure to provide required meal breaks, unsafe surgical conditions, bullying, mismanaged care during surgery, verbal abuse by one of the heart surgeons, mistreatment by a coworker, as well as other issues. Ms. Chopourian’s final complaint was submitted July 31, 2008 (8 days before her termination) and was stamped received by human resources.
 
According to the schedule for August 2008 given to Plaintiff regarding on-call assignments, there was no indication Ms. Chopourian would be required to provide post-surgical rounds on Sunday, August 3, 2008. On Saturday night, August 2, 2008, according to procedure, Ms. Chopourian called the PM assignment recording to see if she was needed, as she was on call. There was nothing on the outgoing message indicating she was needed on August 3, 2008. On Sunday, August 3, 2008, Ms. Chopourian received a call from the hospital asking why she was not present to provide post-surgical floor coverage. Ms. Chopourian explained that she was not aware floor coverage was required. Ms. Chopourian offered to come in to provide coverage, but was told not to do so, that coverage was already obtained and her presence was no longer required. On August 7, 2008, Catholic Healthcare West terminated Ms. Chopourian for failing to report to work on Sunday, August 3, 2008. 

On August 1, 2009, almost a year after her termination from Catholic Healthcare West, Ms. Chopourian secured a position as a Physician Assistant with Radiological Associates of Sacramento Medical Group, Inc. (“RAS”). A condition of employment was that she would obtain privileging at Mercy General Hospital. Ms. Chopourian was originally informed by Mercy that there would be no problem obtaining privileging. She was then informed that she would need national certification to obtain privileging. Ms. Chopourian studied for and took the exam, then renewed her application. In the interim, Ms. Chopourian’s first deposition for her pending lawsuit against Catholic Healthcare West was taken on March 15, 2010. During the deposition, Defendant’s counsel questioned Ms. Chopourian about documents she recently produced in response to discovery requests and concluded on the record that Ms. Chopourian had violated medical privacy laws. Ms. Chopourian was never investigated for such a violation, assessed civil penalties, or charged with criminal violation. In May 2010, Ms. Chopourian was informed that her credentialing privileges were being held up because of allegations that she violated patient privacy laws. Ms. Chopourian was denied privileges on June 8, 2010 and subsequently lost her job at RAS on June 21, 2010.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.juryverdictalert.com/jury-verdicts/item/employment/chopourian-v-catholic-healthcare-west&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.morelaw.com/verdicts/case.asp?n=&amp;s=CA&amp;d=53915&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.palisadeshudson.com/2012/03/a-management-failure-that-could-cost-168-million/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Verdict==
The verdict in favor of Plaintiff included $3,720,488 in economic damages, $39,000,000 in non-economic damages, and $125,000,000 in punitive damages. .&lt;ref&gt; http://www.juryverdictalert.com/jury-verdicts/item/employment/chopourian-v-catholic-healthcare-west&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.morelaw.com/verdicts/case.asp?n=&amp;s=CA&amp;d=53915&lt;/ref&gt; The trial lasted 11 days and the jury deliberated for 3 days before unanimously finding in favor of Plaintiff on her claims of [[hostile work environment]], retaliation for workplace complaints, defamation, and intentional interference with economic advantage. .&lt;ref&gt; http://www.juryverdictalert.com/jury-verdicts/item/employment/chopourian-v-catholic-healthcare-west&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3707">'''Daniel Gómez Íñiguez''' is a Mexican entrepreneur distinguished for his appearance in business magazines like [[Forbes]] and [[Inc. (magazine)|INC]] before the age of 21. He was recognized as the most innovative entrepreneur of the [[TR35]] of 2013. He co-founded the biodiesel company [[Solben (Bioenergy solutions)|Bioenergy Solutions]] (SOLBEN), a for-profit business that produces 80% of the biodiesel produced in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=El rey del biodiesel|journal=Tec Review|volume=03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
He created his first company in early 2009, at that time he was at the age of 16, and he was studying in high school. This enterprise was SOLBEN, a Mexican company that manufactures and sells machinery to produce biodiesel. He co-founded SOLBEN with his three partners Guillermo Colunga, Antonio Lopez, and Mauricio Pareja.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.inc.com/30under30/2011/profile-daniel-gomez-iniguez-guillermo-colunga-antonio-lopez-mauricio-pareja-founder-solben.html|title=Daniel Gomez Iniguez, Co-founder of Solben|last=Fass|first=Allison|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their company brought in over $1 million in revenue during its first year of business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2011/03/11/how-to-make-a-million-before-you-graduate-entrepreneurs.html|title=How to make $1 million before you graduate|last=|first=|date=|website=Forbes|publisher=Forbes|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from high school, he continued his studies as a chemical engineer at [[Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education]] (ITESM).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://enlace.itesm.mx/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=70:solben&amp;catid=1:noticias&amp;Itemid=50|title=Estudiante y hombre de negocios|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=El Norte|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, he had the idea to create a social media platform that would reduce the communication gap between the Mexican population and their leaders. This project proposal was name "Caras politicas". He had difficulties establishing this project in Mexico, so he moved the project to the European continent, and renamed it GovFaces. GovFaces is a project that pretends to create a link between citizens of different European nations and their local representatives, as well as their representatives at the European Parliament and European Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Opinion Invitada / Humberto Cantu Rivera: GovFaces y accion ciudadana|last=|first=|date=2014|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10611">'''Deformulation''' refers to a set of analytical procedures used to separate and identify individual components of a formulated chemical substance.&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;J. W. Gooch, Analysis and deformulation of polymeric materials: paints, plastics, adhesives, and inks, Springer, May 31, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref2"&gt;S. Narayan, S. Thanedar, Overview of polymeric materials deformulation
(1996) Technical Papers, Regional Technical Conference - Society of Plastics Engineers, pp. 125-128.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref3"&gt;M. L. Bruck, G. F. Willard, The Art and Science of Paint Deformulation, Metal Finishing, 104 (9), pp. 23-24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref4"&gt;W. Hea, G. Cheng, F. Zao, Y. Lin, J. Huang, R. Shanks, Spectrochimica Acta Part A, 61 (2005) 1965–1970.&lt;/ref&gt; Deformulation applies methods of [[analytical chemistry]] and is often used to obtain [[competitive intelligence]] about chemical products. Deformulation is related to [[reverse engineering]]; however, the latter concept is most closely associated with procedures used to discover working principles of a device or a designed system through examination and disassembly of its structure. The term, reverse engineering, has become specifically and almost exclusively linked to the field of software engineering;&lt;ref name="ref5"&gt;Eldad Eilam, Reversing: Secrets of Reverse Engineering, Wiley, Indianapolis, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref6"&gt;Andrew Huang, Hacking the Xbox: An Introduction to Reverse Engineering, Xenatera, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; whereas, deformulation is a term more applicable to the field of chemical manufacturing. Deformulation of a multicomponent chemical mixture may occur in several contexts, including the investigation of causes of chemical product failure, competitive benchmarking, legal inquiry to obtain evidence of patent infringement, or new product research and development. Depending upon this context and upon the level of information sought, the requirements of analyses for deformulation may differ.&lt;ref name="ref7"&gt;R. Chen, A. M. Tseng, M. Uhing, L. Li, J Am Soc Mass Spectrom 12 (2001)55–60.&lt;/ref&gt; Deformulation processes typically require the application of several analytical methods, and the selection of methods is dependent upon the degree of confidence required in the results. Methods of deformulation also have similarity to methods of [[forensic chemistry]] in which analytical procedures may be applied to discover the causes of material failure or to resolve a legal question.

==Deformulation Related to Intellectual Property Rights==

In The United States, federal law recognizes a legal practice for the study of an item in hopes of obtaining a detailed understanding of the
way in which it works for the purpose of creating duplicate or superior products without the benefit of having the plans for the original item. The studied item must first have been legally obtained, not stolen or otherwise misappropriated.&lt;ref name="ref8"&gt;Craig L. Uhrich, The Economic Espionage Act—Reverse Engineering and the Intellectual Property Public Policy,7 Mich. Telecomm. Tech. L. Rev. 147 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of intellectual property protection is to provide incentives to invest and to advance the collective knowledge. It is felt that deformulation or reverse engineering helps to educate and promote healthy competition. It is considered to be a learning tool which provides a path to making new, competitive products that perform better and at lower cost than what is currently on the market. Deformulation is often considered along with benchmarking, patent mapping, and other competitor intelligence gathering processes as a means of conducting day-to-day business.&lt;ref name="ref9"&gt;P. Samuelson, S. Scotchmer, The Law and Economics of Reverse Engineering, The Yale Law Journal, 111, 1575-1663 April 10, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other countries may have different conceptions about intellectual property rights and about legal allowances for deformulation or reverse engineering of items. For information concerning the legal status of deformulation practices in other countries throughout the world it is advisable to consult with an expert on intellectual property law.

==Deformulation Procedures==
A preliminary zeroth order analysis may be performed to answer fundamental questions about the nature of the unknown material. Methods that might be used for the preliminary analysis include spectroscopic methods, such as infrared spectroscopy or x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy. The results of the zeroth order characterization of the material inform subsequent choices in later stages of analysis.

A formulated chemical mixture may contain multiple phases, such as suspended or emulsified material. A first-order analysis of the material may involve the separation of phases. [[Centrifugation]], extraction, and [[filtration]] are examples of methods which separate material in different phases. Centrifugation is effective to separate phases that differ in density. Extraction is effective to separate immiscible liquid phases. Filtration is effective to separate dispersed particles that are sufficiently large in size to be trapped in a filter. This initial separation may require the selection of appropriate solvents to either dissolve solid components or to act as a diluent for liquids. The quantitative determination of phases is often determined gravimetrically.

Once separated, each material phase is itself a chemical mixture to be further analyzed. A second-order analysis of each phase will typically involve a selection among available analytical methods to further separate these components. Analytical methods used on liquid phases might include distillation or one of a variety of chromatographic separation methods. [[Distillation]] separates the components of a liquid mixture according to differences in their boiling points. Chomatography separates components of a liquid or gaseous mixture according to differences in retention time as the mixture interacts with a stationary phase. Individual components thus separated can then be identified by a variety of detection methods, including [[infrared spectroscopy]], [[Raman spectroscopy]], [[mass spectrometry]], and [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] spectrometry. Methods used to further analyze solids might include thermal analysis (such as [[thermogravimetric analysis]] or [[differential scanning calorimetry]]), [[x-ray diffraction]] to characterize crystalline solids, microscopy, [[pyrolysis]], combustion analysis, or surface spectroscopic methods.

In some contexts further stages of analysis of the separated components may be required. The active ingredients of a formulated chemical product that differentiate it from another similar material may include proprietary ingredients or specific functional additives.&lt;ref name="ref10"&gt;J. C. J. Bart, Additives In Polymers: Industrial Analysis And Applications, Appendix II, John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Such ingredients that play a key role in the performance of the material in an application may require a third-order analysis to more completely characterize them. Some examples of functional additives include [[surfactants]], [[emulsifiers]], [[dispersants]], adhesion promotors, leveling agents, [[dyes]] and [[pigments]], [[antioxidants]], [[preservatives]], and optical brighteners. Practically every type of chemically formulated product is associated with its own formulary of likely functional additive choices that can fulfill some critical role in performance. Deformulation may thus require both a breakdown of material composition and also identification of the functional role of key ingredients.

The analytical determination of a functional additive has particular problems associated with it. The concentration of a functional additive may be low compared to other ingredients; therefore, it may be difficult to detect. Proprietary ingredients are especially difficult to correctly identify. The functional role of a key component may not be obvious upon inspection. A key ingredient may be undisclosed by the maker of the material, but rather kept as a [[trade secret]]. Careful study of trade literature and patent filings associated with the manufacturer may aid the analyst in the characterization.

{{Contract law}}

A '''firm offer''' is an [[Offer and acceptance|offer]] that will remain open for a certain period or until a certain time or occurrence of a certain event, during which it is incapable of being revoked. As a general rule, all offers are revocable at any time prior to acceptance, even those offers that purport to be irrevocable on their face.

In the [[United States]], an exception is the merchant firm offer rule set out in [[Uniform Commercial Code]] - § 2-205, which states that an offer is firm and irrevocable if it is an offer to buy or sell goods made by a merchant and it is in writing and signed by the offeror.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/article2.htm#s2-205 |title=Uniform Commercial Code - § 2-205. Firm Offers|website=Cornell University Law School, Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such an offer is irrevocable even in the absence of [[consideration]]. If no time is stated, it is irrevocable for a reasonable time, but in no event may a period of irrevocability exceed three months. Any such term of assurance in a form supplied by the offeree must be separately signed by the offeror.

However, even when the period of irrevocability expires, the offer may still remain open until revoked or rejected according to the general rules regarding termination of an offer.

If the offeree rejects, fails to accept the terms of the offer, fixed or otherwise, or makes a counter-offer, then the original offer is terminated.

{{Refimprove|date=November 2009}}
In [[trade finance]], '''forfaiting''' is a service providing medium-term financial support for export/import of capital goods.  The third party providing the support is termed the forfaiter.   The forfaiter provides medium-term finance to, and will commonly also take on certain risks from, the importer; and takes on all risk from the exporter, in return for a margin.&lt;ref name=diff&gt;{{cite web|url=http://keydifferences.com/difference-between-factoring-and-forfaiting.html|title=Difference Between Factoring and Forfaiting (with Comparison Chart) - Key Differences|date=13 January 2016|publisher=|accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Payment may be by [[negotiable instrument]], enabling the forfaiter to lay off some risks.&lt;ref name="A.I. Trade"&gt;''A.I. Trade Finance, Inc. v. Laminaciones de Lesaca, S.A.'', 41 F.3d 830 (2d Cir. 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;  Like [[Factoring (finance)|factoring]], forfaiting involves sale of financial assets from the seller’s [[Accounts receivable | receivables]].  Key differences are that forfait supports the buyer (importer) as well as the seller (exporter), and is available only for export/import transactions and in relation to capital goods.&lt;ref name=diff/&gt;&lt;ref name="CPA_Finance"&gt;J. Downes, J.E. Goodman, "Dictionary of Finance &amp; Investment Terms", Baron's Financial Guides, 2003; and J.G. Siegel, N. Dauber &amp; J.K. Shim, ''The Vest Pocket CPA'', Wiley, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''forfaiting'' is derived from the French word ''forfait'', meaning to relinquish a right (in this case, the exporter’s right to receive payment from the customer - the importer).&lt;ref&gt;Treasury Today, [http://treasurytoday.com/2008/09/forfaiting Forfaiting], published September 2008, accessed 7 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
The characteristics of a forfaiting transaction are:
* Credit is extended to the importer for a period of between 180 days and seven years.
* The minimum bill size is normally $250,000, although $500,000 is preferred.
* The payment is normally receivable in any major convertible currency.
* A [[letter of credit]] or a guarantee is made by a bank, usually in the importer's country.
* The contract can be for either goods or services.

At its simplest, the receivables should be evidenced by a promissory note, a bill of exchange, a deferred-payment letter of credit, or a letter of forfaiting.

==Pricing==
Three elements relate to the pricing of a forfaiting transaction:
* Discount rate, the interest element, usually quoted as a margin over [[LIBOR]].
* Days of grace, added to the actual number of days until maturity for the purpose of covering the number of days normally experienced in the transfer of payment, applicable to the country of risk.
* Commitment fee, applied from the date the forfaiter is committed to undertake the financing, until the date of discounting.

The benefits to the exporter from forfaiting include eliminating political, transfer, and commercial risks and improving cash flows. The benefit to the forfaiter is the extra margin on the loan to the exporter.

==Professional associations==
The oldest forfaiting association in the world is VEFI, the Association of Forfaiters in [[Switzerland]] ({{lang-de|Vereinigung von forfaitierenden Instituten in der Schweiz}}), which was founded in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forfaitswiss.ch Welcome to the VEFI-Website!], accessed 7 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The International Trade &amp; Forfaiting Association (ITFA) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itfa.org|title=ITFA|first=Logix|last=Digital|publisher=|accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 1999 as a worldwide trade association for the forfaiting industry with a cash contribution from VEFI. Its purpose is to develop business relationships and assist other forfaiting-related organizations.

'''Francisco J. Collazo''' (born 1931) is the [[CEO]] and President of Collazo Enterprises Inc. He is the co-founder of COLSA Corporation, a business enterprise which provides engineering and support services to [[NASA]], [[U.S. Army]], [[U.S. Air Force]], [[U.S. Navy]], [[Defense Intelligence Agency]], and the [[Missile Defense Agency]]. In 2012, COLSA Corp. was recognized by Hispanic Business Magazine as being one of the top 100 Hispanic Businesses in the United States.&lt;ref name="HBM"&gt;[http://www.hispanicbusiness.com/research/500/list.asp Hispanic Business Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Collazo was born in the city of [[Utuado, Puerto Rico]] and grew up in his father's farm. He received his primary education in his hometown. In 1946, he dropped out of high school and joined the [[United States Army]].

He was a son of [[Hendrik Muller Sz.]], a Rotterdam-based Dutch businessman and politician, and [[Marie Cornelie van Rijckevorsel]], member of another prominent Rotterdam based business family.

Muller started his career as a businessman, trading with [[East Africa|East]] and West Africa. In his mid-twenties he travelled to [[Zanzibar]], Mozambique, and South Africa for business purposes, but showed himself a keen [[ethnography|ethnographer]] as well, collecting ethnographic [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefacts]] and writing reports about the societies and people he encountered on his way. In 1890, Muller retired from business for personal reasons, and went to Germany to study ethnography and geography. He graduated with a PhD dissertation four years later.

In 1896 he was first appointed consul and later consul general for the [[Orange Free State]]. Muller held this position all through the [[Second Boer War]] and his high-profile performance as European representative for this Boer republic won him considerable fame and notoriety, which lasted all his life. After the [[Treaty of Vereeniging]] was signed in 1902 Muller retired to a life of travelling and writing for some years, making Muller a household name with his travel books. In 1919 the Dutch government appointed him envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to Romania, and later to [[Czechoslovakia]], where he retired in 1932. As diplomat Muller strongly promoted Dutch business interests, especially in oil and electrotechnics.

Muller was a prolific writer. Over the course of his life he published well over two hundred articles, brochures, and books about his travels through the world, about South Africa and the Boers, and about Dutch foreign policy and diplomacy, apart from a range of other subjects. Muller gathered a large fortune with well appointed private investments. He bequeathed his considerable wealth to a private fund in support of academic research and cultural heritage.

==Biography==

===Early life as businessman===
[[File:Muller in 1882.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Muller as young businessman travelling in East Africa (1882–1883)]]
Hendrik Pieter Nicolaas Muller was born in [[Rotterdam]] (Netherlands) on 2 April 1859, as the third child and second son of [[Hendrik Muller Sz.]] and [[Marie Cornelie van Rijckevorsel]]. His father was a successful businessman based in [[Rotterdam]] and trading with Africa and the [[Netherlands East Indies]]. H.P.N. Muller's maternal grandfather, [[Abram van Rijckevorsel]], was the doyen of the Rotterdam merchant community in the early part of the nineteenth century. Both his father and maternal grandfather were politicians as well, liberals who staunchly defended the principle of [[free trade]], and both were at one time members of the [[Senate of the Netherlands|Senate]] of the [[States-General of the Netherlands]].

Muller's paternal grandfather was a German immigrant to the Netherlands and a [[Mennonite Church in the Netherlands|Doopsgezind]] (Mennonite) minister and professor of theology in Amsterdam. The Muller family was fairly prominent in the Netherlands in the nineteenth and early twentieth century, with Christian ministers, professors of literature and history, archivists, antiquarian booksellers, statesmen and businessmen in their midst.	

Muller was destined to step into his father's footsteps and become a businessman. He first attended the private institution Delfos followed by the [[Hogere Burgerschool]] (high school) in [[Rotterdam]], before continuing his education in Germany, at the ''Hohe Real Schule'' in [[Frankfurt-am-Main]], to specialise in trade and business. After finishing his studies with good results, he continued his training with internships in business firms in [[Liverpool]], Manchester, and [[Marseilles]]. His first serious job came when his father called him back to [[Rotterdam]] in 1882, to become interim manager of the [[Handels Compagnie Mozambique]] (Trading Company Mozambique), an ill-performing trading firm doing business in Mozambique. In 1882/'83 Muller travelled to East Africa and visited all the trading posts and establishments of the firm, changing business practices. At the end of his trip he made an extensive tour of South Africa, visiting [[Colony of Natal|Natal]], [[Zulu Kingdom|Zululand]], [[South African Republic|Transvaal]], the [[Orange Free State]], and the [[Cape Colony]]. On his return to [[Rotterdam]] he advised the directors of the company on business opportunities. Subsequently he was appointed co-director of the reconstituted company, now called the [[Oost-Afrikaansche Compagnie]] (East African Company), as well as deputy manager in his father's firm, Hendrik Muller &amp; Co., which had important trading interests in Liberia and elsewhere in West Africa.

In the 1880s Muller was active for his businesses, and travelled to the [[Congo Conference]] in Berlin in 1884, to Portugal in 1886 and North Africa in 1889. In the same year he succeeded his father as consul general for Liberia in the Netherlands, a position he would hold until 1913. After a third business journey to Africa in 1890, now to Liberia and the [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]], for Hendrik Muller &amp; Co., he returned home seriously ill, and had to convalesce for months. In this period he fell out with his father and younger brother [[Abram Muller]], about both personal and business matters. It was a personal break that would never be healed and with professional repercussions. In 1891 Muller left business for good and embarked on a totally new career.

===Ethnographer and geographer===
Already in the 1880s, Muller had dabbled in [[ethnography]] and writing. On the basis of materials gathered on his journey to East Africa and South Africa in 1882/’83, he had held public lectures throughout the Netherlands and Belgium. He also published articles on his trip in Dutch magazines and newspapers, and collated these publications into a book titled ''Zuid-Afrika''. It made him somewhat of a celebrity, and an expert on South Africa and East Africa. During his journey Muller had also collected a large number of [[ethnography|ethnographic objects]] and artefacts, on which he published a richly illustrated study in 1892, together with [[Johannes François Snelleman|Joh. F. Snelleman]], curator of the Africa collection in the [[National Museum of Ethnology (Netherlands)|Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde]] (National Museum of Ethnology) in [[Leiden]].

Once freed from running the better part of two businesses, and financially independent, Muller went to Germany to study geography and ethnography. He attended lectures at the universities of [[Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]] and [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]] before completing his doctorate at the [[University of Giessen]] in 1894, summa cum laude. His thesis ''Land und Leute zwischen Zambezi und Limpopo'' (''Land and People between Zambezi and Limpopo'') was mainly based on secondary material, rather than the materials collected and observations made by Muller himself during his time in East Africa. This limited the originality of the study, although in its time it was appreciated as an important piece of academic work, and was also published in a commercial version.

===Consul general for the Orange Free State===

[[File:Muller Toorop drawing.jpg|thumb|right|Drawing of Dr. H.P.N. Muller as consul general of the Orange Free State. Artist: [[Jan Toorop]], 1902]]
After his return to the Netherlands, H.P.N. Muller settled down in [[The Hague]], where he was originally only occupied with his consular duties for Liberia, his membership of the Commission for Consular Examinations (since 1890) and his writing. Early in 1896 Muller was appointed as consul for the [[Orange Free State]] in the provinces of North and South Holland, assisting the consul general [[H.A.L. Hamelberg]]. He received the appointment on the strength of his publications about South Africa. After [[H.A.L. Hamelberg|Hamelberg's]] death later in 1896 Muller succeeded him as consul general. It was an honorary position. In the following years Muller wholeheartedly set out to work for the [[Orange Free State]] and its interests in Europe. His predecessor [[H.A.L. Hamelberg|Hamelberg]] had not only been consul general, but had on occasion also acted as [[special envoy]] to be able to negotiate [[treaties]] and accords with foreign powers. Muller also acted as special envoy and in this capacity inter alia enrolled the [[Orange Free State]] in the [[Universal Postal Union]], the [[Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property]], and the [[Geneva Conventions]], and negotiated treaties of friendship and trade with Germany, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. He also strengthened the consular representation of the [[Orange Free State]] in Europe and inquired into all kinds of practical issues like a cure for [[rinderpest]] and improved methods of [[irrigation]].

In 1898 Muller travelled to South Africa, where he visited [[Cape Town]], the [[Orange Free State]], and the [[Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek]]. In [[Pretoria]] he attended the inauguration of [[President Kruger]] and in [[Bloemfontein]] he struck up a friendship with the newly elected President [[Marthinus Theunis Steyn|M.T. Steyn]] and his family. He also renewed his relations with other leading statesmen, like former President [[Francis William Reitz|F.W. Reitz]], government secretary [[Pieter Jeremias Blignaut|P.J. Blignaut]], and chairman of the [[Volksraad]] [[Cornelius Hermanus Wessels|C.H. Wessels]]. In Cape Town, he was granted an audience with High Commissioner [[Alfred Milner|Sir Alfred Milner]].

[[File:M VA0953.jpg|thumb|upright|Dr. H.P.N. Muller as consul general of the Orange Free State, ''c.'' 1899]]
Once back in the Netherlands, the political situation in South Africa became tense very rapidly, and Muller did all he could to propagate the cause of the [[Boer Republics]] in the press and via diplomatic channels. Once the [[South African War]] broke out in October 1899, Muller set up an elaborate operation to support the cause of the war for the [[Orange Free State]]. He mobilised public support in the Netherlands, Germany and the United States of America and had public gatherings organised. Through his many contacts with the European press Muller saw to it that the Boer cause was extensively covered in the newspapers, usually in his own words, but published in the name of the respective editor. His office in [[The Hague]] was the hub of diplomatic and consular activity in this period, with several secretaries working continuously on the gathering of information and dealing with correspondence. In the war effort Muller cooperated with the [[:nl:Algemeen Nederlandsch Verbond|Algemeen Nederlandsch Verbond]] in [[Dordrecht]], the Nederlandsche Zuid-Afrikaansche Vereeniging in [[Amsterdam]], and of course the Transvaal's diplomatic representative in Brussels, Dr. [[Willem Johannes Leyds|W.J. Leyds]]. Originally the relationship between Muller and [[Willem Johannes Leyds|Leyds]] was cordial, but with time it soured and turned into open animosity. Both men were strong personalities with strong convictions. The fact that Muller was only [[consul general]] and [[Willem Johannes Leyds|Leyds]] an accredited diplomat was not helpful either and neither was the fact that – at least in Muller's opinion – the [[Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek]] received much more attention than the [[Orange Free State]]. The first time problems arose in the open was in 1900, when the [[Boer Republics]] sent a joint Special Diplomatic Delegation to Europe and the United States, which was ill-prepared and for which Leyds had very different ideas than Muller.

In 1901 Muller travelled to the United States himself to mobilise support from President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], especially on behalf of the women and children in the British [[concentration camps]]. He also held public lectures all around the country. While visiting Mexico, news reached Muller about the [[Treaty of Vereeniging|Peace of Vereeniging]], making him jobless. Muller took the opportunity to turn his American journey into an expedition. On his return to the Netherlands in 1903 he published a book about it. In the years after the end of the [[South African War]] Muller maintained his interest in South Africa and the [[Afrikaners]], both personally and professionally. In 1904 he supported the [[Steyn family]] when they were in Europe for the President's recovery of a debilitating illness. Until his death Muller was active for the Algemeen Nederlandsch Verbond and the Nederlandsche Zuid-Afrikaansche Vereeniging.

===Travel through Asia===
[[File:HPN Muller VA0967.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Muller in the Dutch East Indies, 1907]]

Between 1907 and 1909 Muller travelled through Asia, a journey that produced several books and articles after his return, including a two-part report of his travels (''Azië gespiegeld''; Asia mirrored).&lt;ref&gt;A translation of selected chapters from part I was published by [[Carool Kersten]] as ''Dr. Muller's Asian Journey. Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and Yunnan (1907–1909)'' (Bangkok: White Lotus 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spies, '' 'n Nederlander'', 252–262.&lt;/ref&gt; Muller also published a scientific source publication on Cambodia and the earliest Dutch presence in [[French Indochina]]. The French government rewarded him for it with a knighthood in the [[Légion d'Honneur]] for the latter. The French colony [[Annam (French colony)|Annam]] made Muller a knight in the [[Order of the Dragon of Annam|Order of the Dragon]] for his contributions to the history of Vietnam.

Muller's Asian trip was comprehensive. He visited [[British India]] and Ceylon, Burma, Malaysia and the Philippines and [[French Indochina]], travelled extensively through the [[Dutch East Indies]], and returned via Japan, [[Korea]] – where he had an audience with the last Korean emperor&lt;ref&gt;Muller, ''Azië gespiegeld'', part I, 369–371.&lt;/ref&gt; –, [[Manchuria]], China, and [[Siberia]].&lt;ref&gt;On the Philippines, Siam, French Indo China, Korea, Manchuria, and Siberia: Muller, ''Azië gespiegeld'', part I.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On China: Muller, ''Azië gespiegeld'', part II, 174–286.&lt;/ref&gt; Muller's visit to Japan triggered a lively interest in this country and its economic development potential. Back in the Netherlands he presented his views on the country in several speeches, brochures, and articles, mainly under the auspices of the [[Comité Nederland-Japan]] (Dutch-Japanese Committee).&lt;ref&gt;Muller, ''Zij en wij''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dutch government official and diplomat===
In 1914, at the outbreak of [[World War I]], Muller's career took a new turn. The [[Dutch government]] appointed him government commissioner in charge of one of the main Belgian Refugee Camps in the Netherlands. Muller was charged with the transfer of the camp from a makeshift army encampment in [[Oldebroek]] to a proper refugee camp with full provisions in [[Nunspeet]]. He took to the job with great enthusiasm, but resigned a year later, declaring that he had attained the goals he had set himself on his appointment. Actually the resignation came in a cloud of controversy around his person and policies. At the end of World War I the Dutch prime minister did acknowledge the high quality of Muller's work in setting up the camps and bringing and maintaining order and human dignity under very trying circumstances. Apart from his position as member of the Consular Examinations Commission, this position was the only Dutch government appointment Muller held inside the Netherlands.

From the 1890s onwards, Muller had published with great regularity about the importance of a proper Dutch consular service to promote the Dutch mercantile interests around the world. In his articles he forcefully advanced the idea that the consular and diplomatic services should be merged and professionalised. In his publications Muller also strongly propagated a more active role of the Netherlands in [[international relations|international affairs]]. In this vain, in 1919, he published an article on the history and geography of [[Spitsbergen]] ([[Svalbard]]) and the necessity for the Dutch government to defend its historic claims on the islands. A year later, the Dutch government became a signatory to the [[Spitsbergen Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;
Muller, Hendrik, ‘Nederland's historische rechten op Spitsbergen’, ''Tijdschrift van het Koninklijk Nederlandsch Aardrijkskundig Genootschap'' 2e serie, deel 34 (1919) no. 1, 94–104; [[s:Spitsbergen Treaty|Spitsbergen Treaty (full text in Wikisource)]].
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919, now already sixty years old, he got the chance to put his opinions on Dutch foreign policy into practice. In that year the Dutch government appointed him [[Diplomatic rank|Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary]] to Romania, a country in the throes of political and economic transformation. The Dutch had had important business interests in the country, especially in petroleum. Muller stayed here until early 1924 when he was appointed envoy to [[Czechoslovakia]]. In [[Prague]] he was also involved in Dutch business affairs, ''inter alia'' looking after the interests of the Dutch electrotechnical firm [[Philips]].

He resigned his post in 1932 after being requested to step back by the Dutch minister of Foreign Affairs, who wished to free some senior diplomatic posts for younger diplomats waiting to be appointed envoy. Muller decided not take his pension, allowing him to keep his title of [[Diplomatic rank|Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary]] until his death.

===Dutch history and heritage===
[[File:De Witt unveiling.jpg|right|thumb|Unveiling of statue of [[Johan de Witt]] on the Plaats in [[The Hague]] by [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina]] (front); H.P.N. Muller in third group.]]
From an early age Muller was interested in Dutch history, especially in the great national achievements of the Dutch during the centuries. During his lifetime Muller translated his interests in several concrete projects.

[[File:Johan de Witt-TheHague.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Statue of [[Johan de Witt]] on the Plaats in [[The Hague]] by F.E. Jeltsema.]]
In line with his historical interests he initiated the erection of a statue for the murdered [[Grand Pensionary]] of Holland, [[Johan de Witt]] (1625–1672). The statue was designed and made by the Dutch sculptor [[Frederik Engel Jeltsema]]. The unveiling in [[The Hague]] on 12 June 1918 was a national event. The actual unveiling was done by [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina]], with several ministers in attendance. The statue stands close to the place where De Witt and his brother [[Cornelis de Witt|Cornelis]] were killed by a mob in 1672. On the side of the socle a text is engraved which – in translation – reads: 'Leader and servant of the Republic, designer of it most powerful fleets, defender of the [[freedom of the seas]], caretaker of the State's coffers, mathematician. He was a perfect Dutchman.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vriendenvandewitt.nl website Vrienden van De Witt] (Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt; Muller had an important hand in the formulation of the text.

Muller funded the erection of a plaque in honour of the Dutch seventeenth-century [[admiral]] [[Maarten Harpertsz. Tromp]] in the newly built [[City Hall]] of his birthplace [[Rotterdam]].

===Retirement===
In the years after 1932 Muller travelled a little around Europe and retired to his house in [[The Hague]]. He remained involved in cultural and academic activities, organised his papers, and kept a keen interest in South African affairs. In the last years of his life he was honoured in several ways, among others with an [[honorary doctorate]] in law from the [[University of South Africa]], a bust in the hall of the Eeufeesgebou of the [[University of the Free State]], with a copy in the [[National Museum of Ethnology (Netherlands)|Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde]] (National Museum of Ethnology) in [[Leiden]], and an honorary diner party by the [[Royal Geographical Society]] in London. Without children and never fully reconciled with his family, Muller left almost his complete estate to the [[:nl:Dr. Hendrik Muller’s Vaderlandsch Fonds|Dr. Hendrik Muller's Vaderlandsch Fonds]] for the support of academic research and cultural heritage. Finally his health failed more and more and H.P.N. Muller died in his house in [[The Hague]] on 11 August 1941. He was buried in the cemetery of [[:nl:Oud Eik en Duinen|Oud Eik en Duinen]] in [[The Hague]] in a grand ceremony, with the Dutch flag covering the coffin and the [[national anthem]] being played, in defiance of the [[:nl:Nederland in de Tweede Wereldoorlog|German Nazi occupation]] and as a – somewhat old-fashioned – celebration of Dutch [[cultural identity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://kranten.kb.nl/Exe/ZyNET.exe/1941_08_15_2_03.txt?ZyActionD=ZyDocument&amp;Client=Koninklijke+Bibliotheek&amp;Index=het%20Centrum%20%281910-1930%29%7Cde%20NRC%20%281910-1930%29%7Chet%20Vaderland%20%281920-1945%29%7Chet%20Volk%20%281910-1920%29&amp;Query=hendrik%20AND%20muller&amp;Time=&amp;EndTime=&amp;SearchMethod=1&amp;TocRestrict=n&amp;Toc=&amp;TocEntry=&amp;QField=Datum%5E%3E19410801%3A%3C19410829%7CEditie%5E&amp;QFieldYear=&amp;QFieldMonth=&amp;QFieldDay=&amp;UseQField=Datum&amp;File=E%3A%5CZYDATA%5CDATA%5CGADH01%5CVADERLAND%5CEXPORT%5CTXT%5C236%5F237%5C1941%5F08%5F15%5F2%5F03.txt&amp;User=anonymous&amp;Password=anonymous&amp;SortMethod=n%7C-&amp;MaximumDocuments=20&amp;FuzzyDegree=0&amp;ImageQuality=r65g4/r65g4/x150y150g16/i360&amp;Display=hpfr&amp;DefSeekPage=f&amp;SearchBack=ZyActionL&amp;Back=ZyActionS&amp;BackDesc=Results%20page&amp;MaximumPages=1&amp;ZyEntry=1&amp;SeekPage=f 'Begrafenis Dr. H.P.N. Muller', Het Vaderland 15 August 1941]&lt;/ref&gt; Among the attendants were several former government ministers and high-ranking military officers, university professors, former diplomats, representatives of cultural and scientific organisations, and friends from his South African period and after.

During his lifetime H.P.N. Muller was well respected for his work. He was extensively decorated by almost all the countries he worked for or in, in many cases with the highest distinction. He was made a [[Knight Grand Cross]] in military and civilian orders of Portugal, Liberia, Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia, [[Czechoslovakia]] and the Netherlands, was commander of the French [[Legion of Honour]], and knight in orders of Liberia, [[Order of the Dragon of Annam|Annam]] and the Netherlands. Apart from having his bust placed in the University of the Free State, the Bloemfontein municipal authorities named a street after him.

Although highly decorated, honoured and well respected for his work, Muller was not an easy person. This shows through in a consistently bad press he received during his lifetime and after, which highlights his eccentricities and his at times volatile character.

==Concise bibliography==
During his life, H.P.N. Muller published well over 200 books, articles, columns, and papers. Many of these – especially his newspaper articles – were published anonymously. Many of the (propaganda) articles he wrote about the [[South African War]] when he was consul general for the [[Orange Free State]] were published secretly, often under another journalist's or newspaper editor's name, to maximise the public relations effect.

This bibliography only lists Muller's main book publications and some key articles.

The '''International Labour and Amateur Sports Confederation''' (French: Confédération Sportive Internationale Travailliste et Amateur, '''CSIT''') is an international multi-sports organization. The organization celebrated its 100 years anniversary in 2013. The core principles of contributing to physical activity and sports have stayed in its action policy: it is a right of man and woman to practice sport by his/her own conditions. The key concept of the CSIT’s sport policy has always been in sport for all. – The policy stems from the historic ideas of the [[Socialist Workers' Sport International|international worker sport movement.]]

Nowadays, the main activities that the CSIT is organizing are the major and small sports events, more precisely Sport for All - games for amateurs and workers, competitive and non-competitive, for young and old, men and women from all over the world. Sports events are considered as festivals of friendship, cultural exchange, events promoting awareness of tolerance, respect, sustainability and fair play in sport environment addressed to unlimited size of participants; all those major and small events welcome the CSIT members, other non-member organizations, cooperation partners, governmental bodies, trade unions and business companies with sports activities for employees and amateurs worldwide.

Within the world of international sport, the CSIT maintains its support for everyone to benefit from sporting activities regardless of their qualifications, talent, nationality, age, sex and social circumstances.

During last two decades the CSIT has grown rapidly up to a global organization with altogether 31 national member organizations. They are in alphabetical order: FAST (Algeria), UNTA (Angola), ASKOE (Austria), AFSTB (Belgium), FROS (Belgium), BWF Sport &amp; Health (Bulgaria), CWCIE (China), PASEK (Cyprus), DAI (Denmark), JOUD (Estonia), KALEV (Estonia), TUL (Finland), FFST (France), FSGT (France), Rad- und Kraftfahrerbund ”Solidarität” Deutchland 1896 e.v. (Germany), AFWSI (Iran), AAI (Ireland), HAPOEL (Israel), ACSI (Italy), AICS (Italy), LTSA (Latvia), ”ZALGIRIS” (Lithuania), INDET (Mexico), NCS (Netherlands), INATEL (Portugal), CSE (Romania), ”Atomsport” (Russia), ZZBSS (Slovenia), SATUS (Switzerland), ONCST (Tunisia) and HIS (Turkey).

In addition there are two (sub) continental members: one from Americas (Confederacao Pan-Americana de Desporto do Trabalhador COPADET) and the other from Europe (Balkan Association for Workers’ Sport BAWS).  Furthermore, in January 2018 there were eight candidate members in process to become regular CSIT members; namely ANASTACAM (Cameron), UCEC (Spain, Catalonia), ICSF (Iraq), WSFI (India, LIBERTAS  (Italy), CSEN (Italy), MASA (Mongolia) and FederSwiss – Sport for All (Switzerland).

== Objective ==

The relevance of the CSIT sport policy is growing with importance, especially when commercialization and the lack of facilities and economic resources are reducing sports participation to passive entertainment for the vast majority of people. The CSIT is an organization, which aims at promoting and broadening workers' and amateurs' sport activities and thus developing into a world-wide movement. All activities pursue aspirations for democracy, solidarity and improvement of the quality of life through sport. The movement should encompass all sports federations and hence it would be possible to provide better opportunities for varied physical exercise for all citizens.

As stated above the CSIT stands for promotion of tolerance, respect, fair play, friendship, intercultural dialogue and integration through sport. A “Zero Tolerance” - Policy towards violence, fanatic behaviour and racism is pursued accurately.

== Fields of Activity ==

As listed the fields of the CSIT activities are as follows:
* '''Sports Championships from young to seniors'''  The championships are not games for professional top athletes, but for all workers and amateurs from different countries and cultures all over the world. Not only organizing competitions is in the foreground, but also organizing a huge festival with the objective of gathering sports friends as a worldwide family to advance the making of lifelong friendships, the exchange of information and experiences.
* '''Sports for All Activities: Sports for Elderly People (Seniors 55+)'''   The task is to organize events also for elderly ones by gathering them to the following experiences: to  practice and discovery of specific sports and physical activities, the exchange of training programs and knowledge relating to these and the exchange about culture, tourism and way of life of each country.
* '''Young Leaders Platform'''   The purpose of the Younger Leaders Platform is to share projects, events and camps, diffuse ideas and innovations, give information about different organizations, strengthen networks and ways of collaboration, learn to know better each other and develop a mutual support by sharing the expertise.

== Relevant Activities and Experiences ==

The achievement of the following aims is the most important task of the CSIT:
* to  bring together workers and amateur sports organizations of the entire world and to promote the foundation of new organizations,
* to co-operate with international organizations with the same goals and values,
* to support member organizations with their tasks and activities in all the fields of sport and physical culture, also through agreements with international organizations and authorities,
* to promote all activities that aim to improve the practice of sports by human beings of two sexes considering their age and their physical aptitudes in order to protect and improve their health;
* to achieve the aims by respecting the amateur status of athletes, the values of amateurism and the educational values of sport,
* to encourage to practice sport and physical activity in nature while considering the protection of the environment,
* to use sport as a means to promote peace and mutual understanding among people and to contribute to development of the world of social associations at any level,
* to sustain cultural advancement and to improve health including psychophysical conditions of the member unions as well as its individual members.

== Pillars of CSIT ==
The objectives of the CSIT are conducted in praxis by clearly defined pillars. They are the CSIT World Sports Games, the CSIT Single Championships, the International Tournaments, the International Festivals, the Sport for All-activities, the International Projects and the Health, Recreation and Fitness Activities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5504">'''Josephine "Fina" Uwineza''' is a Rwandan entrepreneur and social activist. In 2018, she plans to open the first microbrewery within Rwanda which will feature a staff composed entirely of local women.

==Early Life==
Josephine was born in 1964 to a family with five other siblings. In 1974, her father was assassinated during the [[1973 Rwandan coup d'état]] which led Fina's mother to exile Rwanda with all of her children in tow.&lt;ref name="sheinspiresher.com1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sheinspiresher.com/josephine-uwineza-rwandas-unexpected-brewer/|title=Josephine Uwineza: Rwanda's Unexpected Brewer - She Inspires Her|date=20 March 2017|publisher=|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Uwineza family went to a few neighboring countries where other exiled family members had been staying but eventually ended up in Canada. Josephine later returned to Rwanda in 1998 to provide aid to the nation following the [[Rwandan genocide]] which led to a large chunk of the population dead and the nation in shambles.&lt;ref name="sheinspiresher.com1"/&gt;

==Career==
Upon returning to Rwanda with her husband and child, Josephine managed a Chinese restaurant, Flamingo, within the city of Kigali. She managed the restaurant for 13 years before deciding to close it down in 2015 after deciding that she wasn't getting enough satisfaction from the business and wanted to spend more time with her family.&lt;ref name="sheinspiresher.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sheinspiresher.com/josephine-uwineza-rwandas-unexpected-brewer/|title=Josephine Uwineza: Rwanda's Unexpected Brewer - She Inspires Her|date=20 March 2017|publisher=|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the closing of Flamingo, Josephine became a member of the Peace Through Business program held by the Institute for Economic Empowerment of Women which targets women in the countries of Rwanda and Afghanistan who are starting their own businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ieew.org/peace-through-business|title=the Institute for Economic Empowerment of Women – PEACE THROUGH BUSINESS®|website=ieew.org|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sheinspiresher.com"/&gt; Through the Peace Through Business program, Josephine met Nancy Coldham, a consultant who aids in the financial pursuits of women in low-income nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://girltalkhq.com/rwandan-female-entrepreneur-set-open-countrys-first-craft-beer-brewery/|title=Rwandan Female Entrepreneur Set To Open The Country's First Craft Beer Brewery - GirlTalkHQ|date=2 November 2016|publisher=|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Josephine had the beginnings of an idea to open a new business within Kigali which Coldham encouraged and even helped instigate by helping Josephine find an outside source for help with this start-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://draftmag.com/crafted-in-kigali/|title=Crafted in Kigali|website=DRAFT Magazine|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coldham found help in the form of [[Beau's All Natural Brewing Company]], a brewing company in Ontario, Canada.&lt;ref name="draftmag.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://draftmag.com/crafted-in-kigali/|title=Crafted in Kigali|website=DRAFT Magazine|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sheinspiresher.com"/&gt; Beau's had interest in providing resources and training to someone who wanted to start their own brewery which Josephine could take advantage of. A team of leads from Beau's visited Rwanda in 2016 to assess the situation firsthand which ultimately lead to agreeing to aid Josephine with her start-up.&lt;ref name="draftmag.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sheinspiresher.com"/&gt; Following the visit from Beau's, Josephine and her newfound friends in Beau's launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise funding for the brewery, citing the importance of a brewery within Rwanda as well as the business plan for the brewery to be owned and operate entirely by women.&lt;ref name="kickstarter.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/beaus/the-rwanda-craft-brewery-project|title=The Rwanda Craft Brewery Project|website=Kickstarter|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sheinspiresher.com"/&gt; The Kickstarter campaign raised over CAD $95,000 with over 1,000 backers.&lt;ref name="kickstarter.com"/&gt;

==Rwanda Brewery==
Josephine's brewery, planned to open in 2018, will feature a staff composed entirely of women from areas surrounding Kigali.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenwoodbrews.com/herstory-craft-beer-opens-the-door-to-female-empowerment-in-rwanda/|title=HerStory: Craft Beer Opens the Door to Female Empowerment in Rwanda|website=www.greenwoodbrews.com|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="draftmag.com"/&gt; The brewery will make use of ingredients that are sourced mostly from Rwanda.&lt;ref name="draftmag.com"/&gt; The main ingredients for the majority of the brews that will be produced include banana and sorghum which are popular ingredients to use within African brews.&lt;ref name="draftmag.com"/&gt; Josephine hopes that the implementation of Rwanda's first microbrewery will be a positive step for the country as a whole since Rwanda enjoys the consumption of beer and being able to have a locally produced microbrew will be a source of unifying strength for the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/beaus/the-rwanda-craft-brewery-project|title=The Rwanda Craft Brewery Project|website=Kickstarter|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kao Ching-yuen''' ({{zh|t=高清愿|poj=Ko Chheng-gōan|p=Gāo Qīngyuàn}}; 24 May 1929 – March 2016, aged 86) was a Taiwanese businessman. Kao was born to a poor family in Gakkō Village, Hokumon District, [[Tainan Prefecture]], [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese-era Taiwan]] (modern-day [[Xuejia District|Xuejia]], [[Tainan]]). Kao began working upon graduating from elementary school. He got into Taiwan Spinning (台南紡織), a [[textile processing]] company in 1954, and became a manager later. Kao left Taiwan Spinning in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thain|first1=Greg|last2=Bradley|first2=John|title=FMCG: The Power of Fast-Moving Consumer Goods|date=2014|publisher=First Edition Design|isbn=9781622876471|page=483|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i8MABAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA483&amp;lpg=PA483&amp;dq=Kao+Ching-yuen+Taiwan+spinning&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Yft36DQonO&amp;sig=xIbCqsnjfingMw6Yd5ZVZqxD5fE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj2l-XB8OzLAhVCRSYKHTx2BfwQ6AEIJTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Kao%20Ching-yuen%20Taiwan%20spinning&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ttobit"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chen|first1=Ted|title=Uni-President confirms death of founder Kao|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2016/04/02/2003642990|accessdate=2 April 2016|work=Taipei Times|date=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leonardo Maugeri''' (10 April 1964 &amp;ndash; 10 July 2017) was an Italian oil and gas expert,&lt;ref&gt;[http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/experts/2510/leonardo_maugeri.html]&lt;/ref&gt; who was a top manager at [[Eni]] from 1994 to 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eni.com/wogr_2008/pdf/cv-leonardo-maugeri.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303225404/https://www.eni.com/wogr_2008/pdf/cv-leonardo-maugeri.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his death, he was Chairman &amp; CEO of the U.S. Investment firm Romulus Asset Management LLC and a Senior Associate &lt;ref&gt;[http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/experts/2510/leonardo_maugeri.html]&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Harvard University]] [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]], [[Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs]].
Maugeri sat on the Energy Advisory Board of [[Accenture]]. He previously sat on the boards of [[Saipem]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Italgas|it|3=Italgas|vertical-align=sup}} and [[Polimeri Europa]].
Maugeri was a Visiting Scholar at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), as well as a member of the Institute’s Energy Advisory Board. He also served as an International Counselor of the [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]] (CSIS – Washington, DC).

==Eni==
Maugeri became ''[[Eni]]''’s youngest director in 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eni.com/wogr_2008/pdf/cv-leonardo-maugeri.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303225404/https://www.eni.com/wogr_2008/pdf/cv-leonardo-maugeri.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; when at 36 he was named Director of Strategy and Development (2000-2010). In 2010 Maugeri was named Executive Chairman of Polimeri Europa (formerly known as Enimont and currently renamed Versalis), the company managing ''[[Eni]]''’s petrochemical activities (2010-2011).
The appointment of Maugeri as ''[[Eni]]''’s head of strategy coincided with the development of aggressive plans for growth that resulted in the  period of greatest development for the company: from 2000 to 2005 ''[[Eni]]'' increased its  hydrocarbons production by 50 per cent while corporate profits reached their highest level in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eni.com/it_IT/attachments/documentazione/bilanci-rapporti/rapporti-2009/fact_book_2008.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924001434/http://www.eni.com/it_IT/attachments/documentazione/bilanci-rapporti/rapporti-2009/fact_book_2008.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 Maugeri launched a new strategy for renewable energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eni.com/wogr_2008/pdf/cv-leonardo-maugeri.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303225404/https://www.eni.com/wogr_2008/pdf/cv-leonardo-maugeri.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He engineered the relaunch of the historic Istituto Donegani (a research center),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freenovara.it/economia-e-lavoro/novara/dove-sta-andando-listituto-donegani]&lt;/ref&gt; with a new focus on renewable energy  and a strategic alliance between [[Eni]] and [[MIT]] - concluded by Maugeri with the current [[U.S. Secretary of Energy]] [[Ernest Moniz]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/01/16/a_surge_for_energy_research_at_mit]&lt;/ref&gt; During his chairmanship of Polimeri Europa Maugeri conceived and engineered (in association with [[Novamont]]) the largest [[green chemistry]] project in the world – the industrial reconversion of the [[Porto Torres]] site. Whereas Eni’s petrochemical activities had been operating at a loss for several decades (€630 mln and € 513 in 2008 and 2009 respectively), Maugeri’s strategy of radical discontinuity allowed it to obtain a modest but significant positive cash flow from operating activities (€ 25 mln in 2011, with losses cut to € 71 mln).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eni.com/it_IT/attachments/azienda/attivita-strategie/petrolchimica/polimeri-europa/pubblicazioni/PE-Bilancio-2011.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413070920/http://www.eni.com/it_IT/attachments/azienda/attivita-strategie/petrolchimica/polimeri-europa/pubblicazioni/PE-Bilancio-2011.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings==
Maugeri’s views and predictions have been expressed in a series of articles for several major international newspapers and magazines – including ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'' (currently ''International New York Times''), ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', ''[[Newsweek]]'', ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', ''[[Scientific American]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[Forbes]]'', and ''[[The National Interest]]''. In particular, Maugeri is one of the leading supporters of the view according to which the world does not run the risk of running out of oil (See: “Not in Oil’s Name” – ''Foreign Affairs'', July–August 2003 – and “Oil, Never Cry Wolf: Why the Petroleum Age is Far from Over” – ''Science'', 21–27 May 2004), and for this reason he has been attacked on many occasions by proponents of the “[[peak oil]]” thesis  [https://web.archive.org/web/20041027075334/http://www.peakoil.net/].

In his book ''The Age of Oil: the Mythology, History, and Future of the World’s Most Controversial Resource'' (Praeger, 2006) Maugeri predicted an imminent collapse of oil prices, which occurred in the second half of 2008. In the same book he predicted the development of [[unconventional oil]] and gas resources thanks to the advent of new technologies – including hydraulic fracturing. In ''Beyond the Age of Oil: The Myths, Realities, and Future of Fossil Fuels and Their Alternatives'' (Praeger, 2010) Maugeri argues that by 2020 a technological breakthrough will shake the solar industry and permanently alter the energy landscape.

Two essays published by Maugeri during his stay at Harvard have sparked a heated debate at the international level. In these essays, Maugeri argues that the incessant growth of global oil production capacity is generally underestimated, and this – combined with modest growth in oil demand – could lead to an oil price collapse in the course of this decade. The second of these studies – “The Shale Oil Boom: A U.S. Phenomenon” (2013),[http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/23191/shale_oil_boom.html] based on an unprecedented analysis of 4,000 [[shale oil wells]], concludes that the United States could become the world’s biggest oil producer by 2017. At the same time, however, the study indicates that the shale oil and gas revolution will not be replicable in the rest of the world – let alone in Europe – due to the high drilling intensity required.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1452">'''LoopCo''' is an economic model created in the mid-1990s as a proposal to the [[Federal Communications Commission]] and the US Congress for the healthy development of competition in the local and long distance industries in the US. While there was widespread support among competitors in the industry, it was not implemented. Instead the Telecom Act of 1996 was implemented in a form that resulted in the reduction of telecommunications competition in the local loop. The original proposal was designed and named by Roy Morris, an adjunct professor at Capitol College, and with  US ONE Communications, one of the early entrants in the local telephone business, which also was one of the first to exit that business. The fundamental economic principles were developed based on earlier research and publications of Jerry Duvall, a prominent economist at the Federal Communications Commission.

'''''Mathematics of Operations Research''''' is a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[scientific journal]] first published in February 1976. It focuses on areas of mathematics relevant to the field of [[operations research]] such as [[continuous optimization]], [[discrete optimization]], [[game theory]], [[machine learning]], simulation methodology, and [[stochastic models]]. The journal is published quarterly by [[INFORMS]] (Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences), which also publishes other journals including ''[[Operations Research (journal)|Operations Research]]'' and ''[[Management Science (journal)|Management Science]]''. ''Mathematics of Operations Research'' is indexed by the ''[[Journal Citation Reports]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stang.sc.mahidol.ac.th/internal/if2004/pdf/OPER.pdf Journal Citation Reports Year 2004 Science Edition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211173900/http://stang.sc.mahidol.ac.th/internal/if2004/pdf/OPER.pdf |date=2012-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, it moved to "Issues in Advance", which publishes the articles online as they become available. The [[H-index]] of the journal is 50.&lt;ref&gt;"Mathematics of Operations Research". SCIMAGO.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The first issue of ''Mathematics of Operations Research'' was published in February 1976. The founding editor was then-professor at Stanford University, [[Arthur F. Veinott Jr.]] He then served as editor-in-chief until 1980, when the position was taken over by Stephen M. Robinson, who held the position until 1986. [[Erhan Cinlar]] served from 1987 to 1992, and was followed by [[Jan Karel Lenstra]] (1993-1998). Next was [[Gérard Cornuéjols]] (1999-2003) and [[Nimrod Megiddo]] (2004-2009). Finally came Uri Rothblum (2009-2012) and the current editor-in-chief Jim Dai (2012–present).&lt;ref&gt;“Mathematics of Operations Research: Stats and History”. Informs&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal's three initial areas were [[game theory]], stochastic systems, and mathematical programming, edited by [[Robert Aumann]], [[Donald Iglehart]], and [[R. Tyrrell Rockafellar]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;"Front Matter." Mathematics of Operations Research 1.1 (1976): n. pag. JSTOR. Web. 27 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the journal has four areas: [[continuous optimization]], [[discrete optimization]], [[stochastic models]], and game theory. They are edited by [[Marc Teboulle]], [[Jens Vygen]], [[Adam Shwartz]], and [[Bernhard von Stengel]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;"Front Matter." Mathematics of Operations Research 40.2 (2015): n. pag. JSTOR. Web. 30 Apr. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mathematics of Operations Research'' has hosted articles written by four Nobel Prize-winning authors: Robert Aumann (Economics, 2005), Roger B. Myerson (Economics, 2007), Alvin E. Roth (Economics, 2012), and Lloyd S. Shapley (Economics 2012).&lt;ref&gt;“Mathematics of Operations Research: Stats and History”.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Networks''' are crucial parts of any action taken in a [[marketplace]].&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"/&gt; Peter Drucker &lt;ref&gt;Drucker, P (1993) Post Capitalist Society. Oxford: Butterworth.&lt;/ref&gt; even described the future economy as one of a society of networks. Companies embedded in such networks stand to gain a lot.&lt;ref name="Achrol"&gt;Achrol, R. S., &amp; Kotler, P. (1999). Marketing in the Network Economy. The Journal of Marketing, 63, 146-163.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wyner"&gt;Gordon, A. W. (1999). Network effects in marketing. Marketing Research, 11(3), 36.&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of different network models, which have distinct relevance to customers,&lt;ref name="Wyner"/&gt; and marketing initiatives. A network in marketing can be formed either strategically (e.g. [[Business networking]]) or completely randomly (e.g. [[Referral economy]]). [[Marketing channel]]s and business networks have been referred to, by Achrol &amp; Kotler &lt;ref name="Achrol"/&gt; as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;“Interdependent systems of organizations and relations that are involved in carrying out all of the production and marketing activities involved in creating and delivering value in the form of products and services to intermediate and final customers.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Achrol &amp; Kotler &lt;ref name="Achrol"/&gt; stated that networks are not accepting of traditional mechanisms, such as authority and control. Suggesting that organizational hierarchy, power and contracts are now exchanged for instruments of relational control. Businesses such as Ford, Procter &amp; Gamble and General Electric have evolved in much the same. It wasn’t all to long ago that they were organized as classic hierarchies. Displaying central control, unified purpose, and complex management structure of many tiers.&lt;ref name="Achrol"/&gt;

Business and marketing networks differ in the amount of connectivity between agents. Some markets, which are more fragmented, have less connectivity between agents than others. On top of this, the level of [[complexity]] differs between various networks, some may seem ordered and rather linear, whereas other random and [[Chaos theory|chaotic]]. As a network develops, agents or entities form relationships with others, which increases the efficiency of operations. Although, this inevitably adds complexity to otherwise simple networks, and makes them more prone to chaos.

==Networks in general==
{{see also|network (disambiguation){{!}}network}}
A network is a web of interrelated lines, passages, or edges, intersecting at a certain points, nodes, vertices, or places, which can be interlinked with other networks and contain sub networks .&lt;ref&gt;search networking, http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/network&lt;/ref&gt; Networks have been linked to branches of [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|mathematics]], electronics, [[Biological network|biology]], and [[Social network|biosocial fields]]. Studies of inter-organization relations, and its networks, can be traced to early societies.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"&gt;Wilkinson, I. (2001). A History of Network and Channels Thinking in Marketing in the 20th Century. Australasian Marketing Journal (AMJ), 9(2), 23-52.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 1736, Leonhard Euler created [[graph theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Leonhard Euler's Solution to the Konigsberg Bridge Problem. {{cite web |url=http://mathdl.maa.org/mathDL/46/?pa=content&amp;sa=viewDocument&amp;nodeId=1310&amp;bodyId=1452 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522140452/http://mathdl.maa.org/mathDL/46/?pa=content&amp;sa=viewDocument&amp;nodeId=1310&amp;bodyId=1452 |archivedate=2011-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Graph theory paved the way for network models such as [[Barabási–Albert model|Barabási-Albert’s]] scale-free networks, chance networks such as Paul Erdös and Alfréd Rényi,  [[Erdős–Rényi model]], which applies to random graph theory, and Watts &amp; Strogatz [[Small-world network]], all of which can be adapted to be representative of strategies and or relationships in the marketplace.

With respect to marketing, much of the creation of theories around systems, structure, and the management of business networks, can arguably be attributed to early economists such as John Common, Ronald Coase, and Joseph Schumpter.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"/&gt; John Commons, in 1934, took ideas from the fields of law, economics, and psychology, and focused on transactions as a rudimentary unit of analysis. Commons showed how united economic entities arise and grow to deal with inherent conflicts of interest among agents and how united organizations are in control of individual actions in that it both restricts and facilitates it.&lt;ref&gt;Commons, J. (1934) Institutional Economics. New York:MacMillan.&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Schumpter, in 1939, focused on the processes underlying industrial organizations and how they have transformed. He showed how the battle for survival among various types of businesses and networks, vying to serve the needs of society, fashioned the change of the industrial sector.&lt;ref&gt;Schumpter, J (1939) Business Cycles. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; Ronald Coase, in 1937, introduced the concept of transaction cost. His research signified the development of ideas about exchange and more specifically the cost of securing agreements as well as coordinating, controlling and implementing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2626876|title=The Nature of the Firm|first=R. H.|last=Coase|date=1 January 1937|publisher=|journal=Economica|volume=4|issue=16|pages=386–405|doi=10.2307/2626876}}&lt;/ref&gt; These three economists, Wilkinson stated,&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"/&gt; have been especially influential in the development of theories surrounding networks in marketing.

There are a number of notable historic studies, pieces of literature marketing networks. Theodore Macklin, in 1921, published a book called ‘Efficient marketing for agriculture’. He emphasized the importance of maintaining relationships between farmers and local middlemen, and between various levels of middlemen in bringing about successful and efficient marketing.&lt;ref&gt;Macklin, T (1921) Efficient marketing for Agriculture. New York: Ferris&lt;/ref&gt; Wilkinson stated that his study can be seen as a precursor for research on marketing and economic evolution and the way the development of marketing organizations linked local markets to larger scale markets that enabling the steps of economic specialize.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"/&gt; Another key study in the field could be that by Ralph Breyer, in 1924. Breyer introduced the thought of marketing flows, depicting marketing frameworks in terms of the flow of electric current through wires, when connections are made. Distinguishing organization unit channels, enterprise channels, business type channels, and channel groups with respect to the number of business actors involved.&lt;ref&gt;Breyer, R (1924) The marketing institution. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940’s, there were signs that change was in order. Marketers by the names of [[Wroe Alderson]], and Reavis Cox wrote an article in 1948, proposing a number of ways that marketing theory could be built upon. Alderson’s research depicted a divide in the development of marketing thought and more specifically the structure and operations of channel networks and marketing institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=1246823|title=Towards a Theory of Marketing|first1=Wroe|last1=Alderson|first2=Reavis|last2=Cox|date=1 January 1948|publisher=|journal=Journal of Marketing|volume=13|issue=2|pages=137–152|via=|doi=10.2307/1246823}}&lt;/ref&gt; They sought to understand the nature of work and the functional requirements of a marketing system and the way that marketing organizations come about to carry out this work.

These previously mentioned studies and pieces of literature demonstrate the creation of various ideas and thought surrounding networks in marketing. As the years have passed these concepts have develop and evolved, as will be shown.

===1960s===

Studies around this time had a focus on the economic structure of [[Distribution (business)|distribution channels]], looking at it from more of a macro view.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"/&gt; A significant study was that by Cox, Goodman, and Fichandler, which built upon previous research conducted by Stewart, Dewhurst and Field (1939) and examined the distribution in a high level economy.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, R., Fichandler, T. C., &amp; Goodman, C. S. (1965). Distribution in a high-level economy. Englewood Cliffs: N. J., Prentice-hall.&lt;/ref&gt; Bert McCammon, in 1963, enriched the field further. He drew from previous literature by Schumpter and Coase, bringing together research and ideas from a number of behavioural sciences exploring the processes of change occurring in channel systems.&lt;ref&gt;McCammon Jr., Bert C.1963. Alternative Explanations of Institutional Change and Channel Evolution. In Stephen A. Greyser ed. Toward Scientific Marketing. Chicago: American Marketing Association 477-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other developments made in the 1960s were a number of models of channel systems. These models were created to study the many interactions taking place and how they affected performance. Wilkinson cited Forrester’s (1961) models of industrial dynamics and Balderston and Hoggat (1962) models of market processes as fundamental frameworks for following logistic models developed by Bowersox (1972) and his colleagues.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"/&gt;

===1970s===
Research around this time looked more at the behavioral dimensions of channels, somewhat the result of Wroe Alderson’s earlier writings. The first attempts were made to improve the typical conceptual models of inter-firm relations towards the tail end of the 1970s. Major developments were undertaken by researchers such as Robicheaux.&lt;ref&gt;Robicheaux, R. A. (1976). A General Model for Understanding Channel Member Behavior. ''Journal of Retailing'', 52(4), 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Also the first marketing channels textbook was created Malled in 1976.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"/&gt; Research in this decade was very limited in that studies were considered unsuccessful if conflict and power were not present. Leading researchers to focus on the car industry and franchisor-franchisee relations were conflict and power are more likely.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"/&gt;

===1980s===

As the 1980s dawned so too did another era of research into networks and its behavioral dimensions. A significant study by Phillips, in 1981, challenged the problem of various informants in [[Business relations|inter-firm relations]] research.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"/&gt; Phillips suggested that the perceptions of a relationship differed across various informants in an organization. Putting into question the validity of many studies carried out in the years prior. It also showed that inter-organization relations involve personal as well as business relations and interactions between many people in a company.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip, L. W. (1981). Assessing measurement error in key information reports: A methodological note on organizational analysis in marketing. JMR, Journal of Marketing Research (pre-1986), 18(000004), 395.&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers also started to explore additional facets of inter-organization relations, combining them with more extensive models of relationships (e.g. Anderson and Narus&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, J. C., &amp; Narus, J. A. (1984). A Model of the Distributor's Perspective of Distributor-Manufacturer Working Relationships. The Journal of Marketing, 48(4), 62-74.&lt;/ref&gt;). As well as this work by Oliver Williamsons in 1975 on transaction cost and the nature and price of inter-firm governance, sparked interest again on economic theories.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"/&gt;

===1990s===
Literature around the 1990s brought together a number of research traditions. This is when various theories such as relationship marketing in industrial and consumer market appeared. The connection between services marketing to the analysis of relations and networks emerged. There was also more of a focus on cooperation as opposed to competing relations, which caused in an eruption of interest in the region of relationships and networks. Furthermore, Researchers began directing more effort to network dimensions, as opposed to isolated dyadic relationship. Moreover, new technology has been used in the study of business networks, allowing for specific issues to be addressed.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"/&gt;

The developments made in the last several decades, demonstrate the evolution of pre-existing concepts and models in relation to networks in marketing, first proposed in the 1950s and 60’s. Wilkinson stated that what is needed now is the application of modeling techniques to portray networks in marketing, in order to strengthen current theories with empirical evidence.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"/&gt;

===2000s to present===

Various studies have used a number of methods to study business networks.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite journal |doi=10.1509/jm.10.0406 |title=How Doppelgänger Brand Images Influence the Market Creation Process: Longitudinal Insights from the Rise of Botox Cosmetic |year=2012 |last1=Giesler |first1=Markus |journal=Journal of Markeing |volume=76 |issue=6 |pages=55–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such study conducted by Aino Halinen, &amp; Jan-Åke Törnroos, looked at how networks are constructed and how they function in the modern day world. Giving insight into use of case studies as a method of measurement.&lt;ref&gt;Halinen, A., &amp; Törnroos, J.-Å. (2005). Using case methods in the study of contemporary business networks. Journal of Business Research, 58(9), 1285-1297.&lt;/ref&gt; Another key study, conducted by Jun, Kim, Kim, &amp; Choi, modeled consumer referrals through use of a small world network. Demonstrating that Watts &amp; Strogatz’s [[Small world network]] model can be adapted to interpret the initial linear relationship between firms, and consumers, and its subsequent development exhibiting small world properties.&lt;ref name="Jun"&gt;Jun, T., Kim, J.-Y., Jun Kim, B., &amp; Choi, M. Y. (2006). Consumer referral in a small world network. Social Networks, 28(3), 232-246.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively a study by Lorenzo Bizzi &amp; Ann Langley (2012) considered the key choices, with regard to methodology, met by researchers, when looking at network dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Bizzi, L., &amp; Langley, A. (2012). Studying processes in and around networks. Industrial Marketing Management, 41(2), 224-234.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

Work by Ravi Achrol &amp; Philip Kotler identified several marketing network models.&lt;ref name="Achrol"/&gt;

===Layered network===

The first model proposed was that of a layered network. A layered network is a business which comprises “an operational layer of cross-functional teams on the one hand and a knowledge creating layer of functional silos on the other hand, connected internally and externally through extensive data bank knowledge and transparent information flows”.&lt;ref name="Achrol"/&gt; An example of this has been implemented by sharp electronics.&lt;ref&gt;Nonaka, I. (2007). The knowledge-creating company. Harvard Business review, 85(7-8), 162-162. http://hbr.org/2007/07/the-knowledge-creating-company/ar/1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internal marketing networks===
The second model proposed is that of internal marketing networks. An internal marketing network is a “firm organized into internal enterprise units that operate as semiautonomous profit centers buying from, selling to, or investing in other internal or external units as best serves their needs on market determined terms of trade but subject to firm policy”.&lt;ref name="Achrol"/&gt; AC-Rochester is a definitive example{{According to whom|date=May 2015}} of an internal marketing network. It is one of eight component manufacturing divisions of General Motors, structured as an internal market. It markets its products to Mitsubishi in Japan, Daewoo in Korea and Opel in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Snow, C. C., Miles, R. E., &amp; Coleman, H. J. (1992). "Managing 21st century network organizations". ''Organizational Dynamics'', 20(3), 5-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Internal marketing networks have many similar properties to those of small worked networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mlmnetworkmarketing.org/training/|title=Network Marketing Basics Tips|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2017-07-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vertical networks===

A vertical network comprises a groups of resource firms specializing in the various product, technologies, or services that constitute the inputs of particular industry, organized around a focal company that focusing on monitoring and managing the critical contingencies faced by the network participants in that market.&lt;ref name="Achrol"/&gt;

Vertical network in marketing often represent monopolies. These would include companies such as Transpower, Kiwi rail, and the like. These networks display preferential attachment, similar that of Barabasi-Albert Model.

==Small world networks==

[[Watts and Strogatz model|Watt’s and Strogatz’s]] used graph theory to create three models depicting varying amounts connectedness, these were named [[Small-world network|Small world network]]. A small world network Is a graph in which most nodes aren’t connected to one another but as connections are made other nodes can be reached through only a couple of intermediaries. In terms of marketing small world networks have been used to model this such as consumer referrals (e.g. Jun, Kim, Kim, &amp; Choi).&lt;ref name="Jun"/&gt;

If we are to think of this in terms of a business relationship, it is not hard to see where this model becomes applicable. Consider Jun, Kim, Kim, &amp; Choi’s example of consumer referrals. Each node represents a consumer, and the connections represent the relationship one consumer has with another. As more incentive is given for referring a product the probability of increasing connections increases. What starts as a regular network, quickly becomes random and [[Complexity|complex]]. This same thing could apply a network of firms, middlemen and consumers. With every step in the chain, value is added to the product, and the cost increases. This increases the incentive for middleman, and or consumer to form other connections to get better deals. As deals and relationships are forged the network becomes more and more complex and integrated, creating disorder.

==Hubs==

‘Hubs’ or ‘connectors’ are important aspects to analyze when examining any system or network and marketing is no exception to this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.2139/ssrn.1526490 |title=Integrating the Social Network to Diffusion Model and Evaluation of the Value of Hubs in the Adoption Process  Electronic Journal |year=2009 |last1=Goldenberg |first1=Jacob |last2=Lowengart |first2=Oded |last3=Shapira |first3=Daniel }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A hub in a network is a consequence of a [[Power Law]], whereby a small number of nodes or actors in a network have a disproportionately large number of links to other nodes in the network. A Power Law in a market system for instance could be explained in that there are many actors who have a very limited number of business contacts in their 'rolodex', but there are a small few, say 10% of those in the network, who have a huge number of network contacts in their 'rolodex' and can easily facilitate communication between two separated actors. The idea that in a network the majority of nodes will have a couple of links which can allow communication through many pathways, whereas hubs have a large number of links and ensure that a network has full contact and eases the complexity of this.&lt;ref&gt;Bornholdt, S., Schuster, H. G. 2005. Handbook of Graphs and Networks: From the Genome to the Internet, Weinheim.&lt;/ref&gt;
One of the first empirical observations of hubs or connectors in social sciences experimentation came about in Stanley Milgram’s Small world experiments, the first of which taking place in 1967. Of the 64 letters which made it through to the stated destination, 60% of those went through the same four people, and in a further experiment of a similar nature when 24 letters got through, 16 of those went through the same last person as a connection.&lt;ref&gt;Travers, J., Milgram, S (1969) An Experimental Study of the Small World Problem. Sociometry, 32, 425-443.&lt;/ref&gt;
Hubs are distinctive components of network systems and through understanding them a better understanding of network function and behavior can be attained.&lt;ref name="Barabasi"&gt;Barabasi, A. 2002. Linked: The New Science of Networks, United States, Perseus Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Barabási states that hubs dominate all networks through the large number of links they possess, that the links hubs provide in areas of high clustering and also between areas of high clustering demonstrate their connective qualities. The presence of hubs in a market can be an important aspect of new product adoption and [[Diffusion (business)|diffusion]] rates, by utilizing hubs when bringing a product to market producers can generate more ‘buzz’ and reach a greater target audience with improved efficiency through the use of hubs and their large number of connections across a network.&lt;ref name="Delre"&gt;Delre, S.A., Jager, W., Bijmolt, T.H.A. &amp; Janssen, M. 2010. Will it spread or not? The effects of social influence and network topology on innovation diffusion. Journal of Product Innovation Management, 27, 267-282.&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of hubs acting as facilitators of diffusion, they can take many forms. One example of this is a celebrity endorsement in a marketing campaign for a product, the celebrity acts as the hub by using their fame and the perceived links that consumers have with their favorite celebrities to distribute information about the product which is given to them by the producer.&lt;ref name="Delre"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roll, M. 2011. Branding celebrities, brand endorsements, brand leadership. Available :( http://www.venturerepublic.com/resources/branding_celebrities_brand_endorsements_brand_leadership.asp.&lt;/ref&gt;
The links involved with hubs exhibit small world properties of a number of short paths between actors which are clustered due to similarities. However, while the interconnectedness which hubs can bring into a network is a great strength it can also be their greatest weakness in that, if functioning correctly hubs keep everyone in touch through a system, but remove a hub and the clusters become segregated and communication and information flow become strained.&lt;ref&gt;Gladwell, M. 2000. The Tipping Point: How Little things Can Make A Big Difference. United States of America, Little Brown.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strong vs. Weak ties and their relative importance==

The concepts of weak and strong ties in a marketing and social sciences context relates to the intensity of the [[Interpersonal ties|relationships]] between members of a network. The strength of a tie according to [[Mark Granovetter|Professor Mark Granovetter]] can be analyzed by looking at a combination of; the amount of time, the emotional intensity, the intimacy and mutual confiding, and the reciprocal services between those which the tie exists.
A strong tie relationship obviously exhibits high levels of the afore mentioned attributes and in a relationship between two parties which is a strong tie there is assumed to be mutual choice for both parties involvement in the relationship. Strong ties are often found in highly dense groups of nodes who share many similarities and connections within the groups. Thus removing one or two strong ties in a group does not affect the information distribution through a group due to the intense interlinking present.&lt;ref name="Granovetter, M. S. 1973"&gt;Granovetter, M. S. (1973). The Strength of Weak Ties. American Journal of Sociology, 78, 1360-1380.&lt;/ref&gt;   
Weak ties refer to the relationships that are present between individuals which are not actively sought out or maintained. Where strong ties require high levels of commitment and other factors a weak tie only needs a small amount of connection to function effectively and does not require mutual agreement to be present. Nor do they require similar interests across nodes in a network, on the contrary weak links occur due to different interests but are created through often minimal factors. They link groups or clusters together despite differences in the clusters and enable the flow of information or diffusion of ideas to take place across an entire network rather it remaining in one cluster. 
The idea that removing strong ties from a network will not have as big of an effect as removing a weak one. The concept of [[Bridge (interpersonal)|bridges]] is central to this idea. A bridge is a connection which acts as the only way for information to travel between two nodes in a network, there are no other connections available to get said information across. Due to the nature of bridges strong ties are not able to be bridges due to the interconnected nature of strong ties in a community and the presence of alternate connections to facilitate [[lateral diffusion]]. Conversely weak ties can be bridges because they are often the only links between groups or nodes, however it is important to note that not all weak links are bridges there may be other connections, but all bridges are weak ties, thus transmission probabilities rely heavily on them.&lt;ref name="Granovetter, M. S. 1973"/&gt; 
An example of how weak ties can be effective at reaching a larger audience than strong ties is shown by Rapoport and Horvath’s 1961 study of a high school in Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;Rapoport, A., Horvath, W. J. 1961. A Study of a Large Sociogram. Behavioral Science, 6, 279-291.&lt;/ref&gt; 857 students were asked to rank their eight top friends from 1(best friend) to 8(associate). The results of the survey showed that those rated one or two were a small minority of the students, where those who were seen as more associates canvassed a vast majority of the sample. In this example the strong links were those rated as best friends where the weak links who had the ability for far greater diffusion of information were those considered associates. 
Through utilizing weak links available in the market a firm operating in one system or niche perhaps would potentially be able expand or tap into different markets through utilizing a weak link and diversify. Marketers also need to be aware that just because their advertisements are targeted specifically at a segment where they believe it will go down well or be acceptable such an adult advertisement on a billboard in a ‘suitable location’ or a giveaway on a beer bottle, due to weak links it has potential to be able to affect those outside the [[target audience]] or group who would find it appropriate.

==Complexity==

[[Complexity]] in networks is tied to the notion of elements of the system or networks have relationships amongst themselves which from relationships they may have with other elements outside their group. A [[complex system]] is a system composed of interconnected parts that as a whole exhibit one or more properties which can be obvious when viewing the system as a whole, however when viewing the individual components of the system their potential to produce is not visible (or obvious).
A complex system is a highly structured system, which shows structure with a number of variations. It is very sensitive to initial conditions and small alterations to these can result in dramatically different outcomes as chaos theory suggests, there are a number of pathways and evolutions which the [[butterfly effect|'butterfly’s wings']] are able to affect.  A complex system is one that by design or function or both is difficult to understand and verify. There are multiple simultaneous interactions by actors and components which lead to an overall output of a system.&lt;ref&gt;Mathews, K. M., White, M. C. &amp; Long, R. G. (1999). Why Study the Complexity Sciences in the Social Sciences? Human Relations, 52, 439-462.&lt;/ref&gt;
It is important in a marketing environment to recognize that there are many levels of complex systems at play and that targeting individual parts of production, advertising or other aspects will not often result in proportional outputs. On this note it is also important to recognize the nesting potential in a market complex system, where a market is made up of different firms which are complex systems themselves, which in turn are made up of people who also exhibit complex system functionalities. The market must be viewed as a whole to understand the sum of the parts and analyze emergent behaviors. The many aspects of complex systems mean that they are unpredictable and involve aspects of chaos and non-linearity and this in turn leads to the rise in small-world phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Uzzi, B., Amaral, L. A. &amp; Reed-Tsochas, F. (2007). Small-world networks and management science research: a review. [[European Management Review]], 4, 77 - 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chaos Theory==

[[Chaos Theory]] studies the behavior of [[dynamical systems]] that are highly sensitive to initial conditions. Chaos Theory applied to [[marketing]] offers an alternative explanation for the complex, apparently disorderly patterns of behavior in marketing systems over time which are observed in phenomena such as sales, inventories, brand shares and prices.&lt;ref name="Hibbert"&gt;Hibbert, B., Wilkinson, I. F. (1994). Chaos Theory and the Dynamics of Marketing Systems. Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 22(3), 218-233.&lt;/ref&gt; Marketing systems are identified as being [[nonlinear systems|nonlinear]] in nature because they fail to satisfy the [[superposition principle]] (outputs are not directly proportional to inputs). Even though the rules governing behavior in marketing systems are known, it is impossible to make accurate long-term predictions of system behavior due to the high sensitivity of initial conditions. This happens even though marketing systems are fully [[deterministic]]. Traditional explanations of marketing phenomena typically rely on assumed patterns of external shocks, random noise or inherently stochastic processes to account for the [[complexity|complex]] dynamics within marketing systems.&lt;ref name="Hibbert"/&gt;

Chaos Theory explains at least a component of disorderly market behavior in terms of deterministic feedback mechanisms reflected in the rules governing system members’ behavior and interactions. This feedback represents non-linearity and occurs in two forms: (1) the reinforcing growth effect of positive feedback; and (2) the damping effect of negative feedback.  Chaos theory also offers alternative explanations for the existence of various types of marketing institutions as 'disequilibrium mechanisms' designed to buffer or reduce the effects of complex dynamics.&lt;ref name="Hibbert"/&gt; These include inventory-holding intermediaries, financial intermediaries, insurance agencies, and ordering systems. Finally, Chaos Theory can explain and predict structural change and evolution in marketing systems.&lt;ref name="Hibbert"/&gt;

The application of chaos theory to marketing systems can lead to new ways of coping with or avoiding these chaotic patterns of behavior, to the extent the rules governing behavior are amenable to control by firms and/or policymakers.

===Marketing Models with Chaos Properties===
Chaos is present in several popular marketing models of product diffusion, market or brand share and market evolution.&lt;ref name="Lambkin"&gt;Lambkin, M., Day, G.S. (1989). Evolutionary Processes in Competitive Markets: Beyond the Product Life Cycle. Journal of Marketing, 53(3), 4-20.&lt;/ref&gt; The transition from order to chaos can be demonstrated in this simple nonlinear equation, representing market evolution, under plausible assumptions of interdependence of actions and/or variables:

&lt;math&gt;N_{t+1}=rN_t[(K-N_t)/K]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Lambkin"/&gt;

The rate of growth, &lt;math&gt;rN_t&lt;/math&gt;, will be exponential as entry far exceeds exit.&lt;ref name="Doherty"&gt;Doherty, N., Delener, N. (2001). Chaos Theory: Marketing &amp; Management Implications. Journal of Marketing Theory and Practice, 9(4), 66-75.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the number of firms in the industry (&lt;math&gt;N_t&lt;/math&gt;) approaches the capacity (&lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;) and growth slows. Growth becomes negative should overcrowding occur, which may be reflected by, for example, price competition and competitive promotional activities. Eventually this competition will drive profit below threshold levels. The value &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; determines the degree of non-linearity present in the model and is the critical determinant of the pattern of market evolution.&lt;ref name=Doherty/&gt; Stable equilibrium occurs at values of less than 2, periodic and bifurcation patterns begin at values of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; exceeding 2 and chaos occurs at values of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; greater than 2.57.&lt;ref name="Hibbert"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gleick"&gt;Gleick, J. 2008. Chaos: Making a New Science, New York, U.S.A., Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4099">The '''Octave Chanute Award''' was created in early 1902 by the [[Western Society of Engineers]] for papers of merit on engineering innovations. It is still awarded as of 2011. 
The [[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.]] (AIAA) introduced the "Chanute Flight Award" in 1939; it was presented for an outstanding contribution made by a pilot or test personnel to the advancement of the art, science, and technology of aeronautics. This award was discontinued in 2005. It was reactivated in 2010 as the "Chanute Flight Test Award" to recognize significant lifetime achievements in the advancement of the art, science, and technology of flight test engineering. 

==Self taught==
[[File:Octave A. Chanute.jpg|thumb|60 px| right|alt=Octave Chanute photograph|Chanute]]
[[Octave Chanute]], 1832&amp;ndash;1910, was born in France and became a naturalized American. He was a self-taught engineer. He designed the first [[rail transport|railroad]] [[bridge (structure)|bridge]] over the Missouri River and the [[Union Stock Yards]] in Chicago (IL) as well as those in Kansas City (MO). Octave Chanute was a pioneer aeronautical engineer and experimenter, and was a friend and adviser to the Wright Brothers.

==Aeronautical pioneer==
Chanute waged a long campaign to encourage the invention of the airplane. He collected information from every possible source and gave it to anyone who asked. He published a compendium of aviation information in 1894. In 1896 he commissioned several aircraft to be built. The ''Katydid'' had multiple wings that could be attached variously about the fuselage for ease of experimentation. Chanute's biplane glider (1896) with "two arched wings held rigidly together by vertical struts and diagonal wire bracing" (the principle of the Pratt truss used in the railroad bridges which Chanute constructed) served as a prototype design for subsequent airplanes.

==Recognition==
He is universally recognized as a prominent engineer, experimenter, writer and communicator, which is why these two award were given his name.

The former Chanute AFB in Illinois was named in honor of him, and so was the town of Chanute, KS

'''Oleg Lvovich Mitvol''' ({{lang-ru|Олег Львович Митволь}}) (born October 3, 1966)  is a Russian environmentalist, businessman and government official, known for his activity in the chair of environmental protection department.

==Business career==
In 1997 - 2003 Mitvol was the chairman of the JSC newspaper [[Novye Izvestiya]].

As media tycoon [[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Boris Berezovsky]], owner of the newspaper, had fled from Russia to [[London]], Mitvol obtained a 76% share in the newspaper from him, but Berezovsky effectively continued to support the newspaper financially. However, on February 20, 2003, Oleg Mitvol, citing a decision of a meeting of the board, kept secret from the journalists despite their 24% share, accused Director General of Novye Izvestiya [[Igor Golembiovsky]] of misappropriation of funds and fired him. The publication was suspended.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|work=lenta.ru|url=http://lenta.ru/articles/2003/04/07/newizv/|script-title=ru:Девять смертей газеты "Новые известия"|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berezovsky claimed that Mitvol's move was politically motivated,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|work=www.gazeta.ru|url=http://www.gazeta.ru/2003/02/20/novyeizvesti.shtml|script-title=ru:"Новые известия" больше не выйдут|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|work=www.mn.ru |url=http://www.mn.ru/issue.php?2003-7-22 |title=КТО ЗАКРЫВАЕТ "НОВЫЕ ИЗВЕСТИЯ" |language=Russian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061027035052/http://www.mn.ru/issue.php?2003-7-22 |archivedate=October 27, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as the newspaper was opposed to President [[Vladimir Putin]] and on that very day had published an article by [[Vladimir Pribylovsky]] about the allegedly emerging cult of Putin's personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|work=www.anticompromat.org|url=http://www.anticompromat.org/putin/putnoslavie.html|title=?|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Accusation of plagiarism ==
According to examination performed by [[Dissernet]], both doctoral&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dissernet.org/expertise/mitvolol2002.htm Published results of the expertise of Oleg Mitvol’s doctoral thesis on Dissernet server]&lt;/ref&gt; and higher doctoral&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dissernet.org/expertise/mitvolol2004.htm Published results of the expertise of Oleg Mitvol’s higher doctoral thesis on Dissernet server]&lt;/ref&gt; theses of Mitvol contain gross plagiarism from several doctoral and higher doctoral theses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.echo.msk.ru/blog/serguei_parkhomenko/1255558-echo/ Театр одного Митволя] // [[Echo of Moscow]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental supervisor career==
Since April 2004 he has been Deputy Head of the [[Russian Federal Service for the Oversight of Natural Resources]]. He soon became attracting media attention with [[environmental crime]]s investigations.

One of the famous campaigns by Mitvol was "[[Dacha]] war", against elite cottage settlements that were [[illegally built]] in the [[gallery forest]] area on [[Istra River]] shores. The "Piatnitsa" cottage settlement was ordered to be deconstructed. It was followed by protests of cottage owners.

Another his activity was about [[Sakhalin]] environment and its possible damage by oil-gathering companies. In September 2006, he threatened to revoke environmental authorisation for [[Royal Dutch Shell]]'s [[Sakhalin II]] oil and gas production project. He brought in London lawyer [[Mark Stephens (solicitor)|Mark Stephens]] to take proceedings to preserve the [[Russian Far East]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.theguardian.com/business/2006/dec/15/oilandpetrol.news|title=Greenpeace lawyer prepares case against Shell-Russians hire British legal firm for Sakhalin case|publisher=Guardian|date=2006-12-15 |accessdate=2011-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 14, 2006, [[Sergei Sai]], Head of the Service, tried - and failed - to fire Mitvol from this position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rian.ru/economy/20061214/56912368.html|script-title=ru:Глава Росприроднадзора инициировал увольнение Митволя|date=14 December 2006|work=www.rian.ru|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pacific Bell Telephone Company''' ('''Pacific Bell''') is a [[telephone company]] that provides telephone service in California. The company is owned by [[AT&amp;T Inc.]] through [[AT&amp;T Teleholdings]]. The company has been known by a number of names during which its service area has changed. The formal name of the company from the 1910s through the 1984 Bell System divestiture was The Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Company. As of 2002, the name “Pacific Bell” is no longer used in marketing, Pacific Bell is still the holder of record for the infrastructure of cables and fiber through much of California.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/2002/dec/11/business/fi-pacbell11&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Company''' managed the [[Bell System]]'s telephone operations in [[California]]. It grew by acquiring smaller telephone companies along the Pacific coast. It built and occupied San Francisco's [[PacBell Building|Pacific Telephone Building]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.preservationnation.org/magazine/story-of-the-week/2009/san-francisco-telephone-building.html |title=On Hold in San Francisco |publisher=Preservationnation.org |date=2009-01-30 |accessdate=2012-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; on [[New Montgomery Street]] which has been described as a "monument to western progress and foresight".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfmuseum.org/hist8/140telco.html |title=Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Company Building - 1925 |publisher=Sfmuseum.org |date=1924-01-01 |accessdate=2012-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== San Francisco graft ===

During the [[San Francisco graft trials]], the company was implicated in paying bribes to obtain an operations franchise in San Francisco. Theodore Halsey, a confidential political agent for the Pacific States Telephone and Telegraph Company, paid attorney [[Abe Ruef]] a [[retainer agreement|retainer]] of $1,250 a month for "advice" on municipal issues. Ruef was the [[political boss]] behind S.F. Mayor [[Eugene Schmitz]]. In 1906, San Francisco was one of the most promising places for investment in all of the United States. Many companies were vying for a piece of the money to be made. The city's supervisors had run on a platform that included the city acquiring its own telephone system which both Home Telephone Company and Pacific States Telephone and Telegraph Company wanted to prevent. The Home Telephone Company, financed by investors from Southern California and Ohio, was trying to wrest the telephone franchise held exclusively by Pacific States Telephone and Telegraph Company in Northern California.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p31}}

After the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|massive earthquake of 1906]], the Home Telephone Company contributed $75,000 to a relief fund for the city, but asked that it be held until their franchise was approved.&lt;ref name=hichborn/&gt;{{rp|p51}} It was later revealed that the city's supervisors had received payoffs through Ruef from both the Home Telephone Company and Pacific States Telephone Co. Home Telephone paid 10 supervisors $3,500 each and seven supervisors $6,000 each (about ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|3500|1906}}}} to ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|6000|1906}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}). Pacific States Telephone Co. paid 10 supervisors $5,000 each (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|2000|1905}}}} today). After the [[San Francisco graft trials|graft prosecutions]], E.F. Pillsbury, General Counsel for the telephone company, revealed that he had never heard of Ruef's employment, and would have objected to Ruef receiving compensation greater than his own $1,000 per month.&lt;ref name=hichborn&gt;{{cite book | title=The System | first=Frank |last=Hichborn|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EwgqAAAAYAAJ&amp; |year=1915 |location=San Francisco |publisher=The James H. Barry Company|accessdate=June 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Growth ===

During the first part of the 20th century, Pacific Telephone &amp; Telegraph, along with the rest of the Bell System, initially resisted automating its services,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telephonecollectors.org/singwire/dial1.htm |title=Why the Bell System Opposed the Automatic Dial Telephone, Part I by Roger Conklin |publisher=Singing Wires |date=October 2008 |accessdate=2013-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the premise that their people could provide better service than machines. When it acquired competing providers, if the company provided automatic dial service, Bell removed the automatic equipment and replaced it with manual telephones and manual operator switchboards. However, the company soon realized its best manual systems were unable to keep up with the growing demand for telephone service. In the early 1920s, following the 1921 installation of the nation's first large [[panel switch]] in Omaha, the Bell operating companies began to install automated switching equipment.

=== Southern California service ===

Los Angeles and San Francisco employed different approaches for adopting new automatic switching technology. The Los Angeles Telephone Co. had merged with the Sunset Telephone Co. of northern California in 1883. Sunset was subsequently acquired by Pacific Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. in 1906. Following the purchase by PT&amp;T, the southern California company remained a separate operation and used the Sunset name.

The Los Angeles area was also served by a competitor, The Home Telephone Co., which began offering automatic (dial) service in 1902. The Sunset Telephone Co. subscribers were able to make local and long distance calls via the Bell System, but Home Telephone Co. customers could make only local calls to other Home customers. To reach both exchanges, businesses were required to pay for a line from each company. In 1916, under pressure from local politicians and subscribers, Sunset Telephone Co. agreed to acquire the Home Company's operations. The new entity was called The Southern California Telephone Co. The two company's operations were fully integrated in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.losangelestelephone.com |title=Los Angeles Telephone History |publisher=Los Angeles Telephone |date= |accessdate=2013-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the 1918 merger, Home had 60,000 customers served from 16 dial offices. Sunset had 68,000 subscribers served from nine manual offices. Home's operations were sizable and the public felt Home provided better service than Sunset, so Pacific Telephone didn't convert the dial offices to manual as it had in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telephonecollectors.org/resources/dial1.htm |title=Why the Bell System Opposed the Automatic Dial Telephone, Part I by Roger Conklin |publisher=Singing Wires |date=October 2008|accessdate=2013-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, they took the highly unusual step of adding a dial and trunk lines to every manual switchboard position. In this way, former Sunset customers could reach the former Home subscribers via their central office operator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://telephonecollector.info/odds_and_ends/lats_history.html |title=Early LA Telephone Service Article TCI SW, March 2009 |publisher=Telephonecollector.info |date=1917-05-01 |accessdate=2013-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last Los Angeles manual exchange was THornwall 6, in Burbank, which operated until the late 1950s.&lt;ref name="yahoo1"/&gt; The last manual office in southern California was in [[Avalon, California|Avalon]], on [[Santa Catalina Island, California|Catalina Island]], dating from a radiotelephone service installed in the early 1920s. Pacific Telephone later laid two submarine cables to link the island to the mainland. Avalon was converted to dial in 1978, using switching equipment 23 miles away in the San Pedro central office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecentraloffice.com/calif/la/lap/lap.htm |title=Los Angeles Pacific Bell-SBC|publisher=Thecentraloffice.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Northern California operations ===
[[File:PacBell Building, San Francisco.jpg|thumb|180px|PacBell Building, San Francisco]]
San Francisco continued to install manual offices throughout the 1920s. When PT&amp;T took over the operations of its San Francisco and Oakland competitor, Home Telephone Co., in the early 1920s, their customers were switched from Home's dial service to Pacific Telephone manual exchanges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.artandarchitecture-sf.com/home-telephone-building.html/dsc_7637 |title=333 Grant » Art and Architecture - San Francisco |publisher=Artandarchitecture-sf.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1927 Pacific Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. publication proudly describes the company's newest manual offices, without a word of plans to introduce dial service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=R.

Groups |publisher=TEN Project |date= |accessdate=2013-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dial service conversion ===
Telephone service conversion from manual to dial systems was slowed by equipment shortages during [[World War II]]. San Jose had been planned for conversion before the war, but remained on manual service until 1949. 
[[File:Pacific Bell telephone booth.jpg|thumb|200px|Pacific Bell telephone booth]]
In preparation for operator direct distance dialing, the precursor to customer DDD, cities throughout the country converted telephone numbers to a standardized 2L-5N format, e.g. EXchange 1-2345. San Francisco completed its conversion in December 1947. In July 1948, Pacific Telephone converted most of the cities on the San Francisco Peninsula. The company announcement, “most Peninsula cities now have exchange names”&lt;ref name="archive1948"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/telephonedirectjuly1948pacirich#page/n0/mode/2up |title=Telephone directory for communities in San Mateo County |publisher=Archive.org |date=1948-07-04 |accessdate=2013-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; confirmed that the old four- or five-digit numbers had been converted to the seven-digit exchange format.

* DAvenport 2 - Palo Alto
* OXford - Millbrae
* DIamond 3 &amp; 4 - Burlingame, San Mateo
* FIreside 5 - San Mateo
* EMerson 6 - Redwood City

Manual numbers were still used in some peninsula cities and were listed in the directory without the first two letters of the name capitalized, indicating a non-dialable point requiring operator assistance to reach. For example:&lt;ref name="archive1948"/&gt;
* Belmont 120
* San Carlos 932-J
* Pescadero 2349-R
* Half Moon Bay 3497
* San Gregorio 2

To place calls to certain other Northern California exchanges, such as Sacramento, Stockton, and Vallejo in Northern California, dial customers would dial ‘’0’’ to reach an operator. The operator dialed through a [[tandem switch]] and directly called numbers in those cities. These calls were indicated by a star in the telephone directory. For other call destinations, customers dialed ‘’211’’ to reach a long distance operator who would connect the customer using manual trunks to reach a distant operator.&lt;ref name="archive1948"/&gt;

When Pacific Telephone converted its San Francisco operations to 2L-5N calling in 1947, the old central office names were kept in most cases, with an extra digit appended. Certain exchanges were abandoned after being converted from manual service, such as WEst, RAndolph, and the famous CHina exchange of Chinatown. The manual 25th Street office in San Francisco, serving the MIssion, ATwater, and VAlencia exchanges, was converted by Pacific to dial in 1952. On September 6, 1953, JUniper 6, previously known as RAndolph in the 2L-4N era, the last manual office within the City and County, cut over its 2700 subscribers to crossbar equipment in the new Juniper central office on Onondaga Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.telephonecollectors.info/index.php/document-repository/doc_view/4701-53-ptm-san-franciscos-last-manual-exchange |title= Pacific Telephone News. (by Date) &amp;#124; Western Electric/Bell System &amp;#124; Catalogs, Manuals, Educational Docs (by Company) |publisher=Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Co. |year=1953 |accessdate=2013-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Riverside maintained a large manual office until 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://groups.yahoo.com/group/TENproject/message/31 |title=Yahoo! Groups |publisher=Groups.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berkeley converted AShberry 3, its last manual office, to dial in 1963. Crockett, the final Bay Area manual office, was converted to dial in 1969.&lt;ref name="yahoo1"/&gt;

=== Northwest acquisitions ===
Acquisitions over the years extended Pacific Telephone's territory into [[Oregon]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], and northern [[Idaho]]. Those operations were split off on July 1, 1961 to form [[Pacific Northwest Bell#Pacific Northwest Bell|Pacific Northwest Bell]]. In the 1980s, Pacific Telephone's assets were valued at $14.5 billion, making it the largest of any of the 21 wholly owned Baby Bells owned by AT&amp;T, which also made Pacific Telephone the "crown jewel" of the operating companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Coll | first = Steve | authorlink = Steve Coll |title = The Deal of the Century: The breakup of AT&amp;T | accessdate =  |year = 1986 | publisher = Atheneum | location = New York | ISBN=978-0-689-11757-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Pacific Telephone was one of the least profitable Bells due to very tough local telephone regulations in [[California]].

=== Separation from AT&amp;T ===
[[File:Pacific Bell logo (1984–1997).svg|150px|thumb|Pacific Bell logo, 1984–1997]]
Prior to the [[AT&amp;T breakup]] in 1984, AT&amp;T held 89.8% of Pacific Telephone. After the breakup, The Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Company changed its name to Pacific Bell Telephone Company, or PacBell for short. [[Pacific Telesis]] was formed as a holding company for PacBell's interests, with PacBell and [[Nevada Bell]] (which PacBell had owned since 1913) as its operating companies. Since Nevada Bell had long been a PacBell subsidiary, that company was omitted from the [[Modification of Final Judgment]] that broke up the Bell System.

== Mergers and subsequent growth ==
In 1997, [[Pacific Telesis Group]] was acquired by [[SBC Communications]], and although the [[Pacific Telesis]] corporate name disappeared fairly quickly, SBC continued to operate the local telephone companies separately under their original names.

[[File:Pacific Bell&amp;SBC logo.svg|200px|frame|right|Pacific Bell logo, 1999-2001]]
In September 2001, SBC rebranded the telephone company "SBC Pacific Bell". In late 2002, the companies were rebranded again as "SBC". Meanwhile, employees of [[SBC Communications|SBC]] working in California who support SBC's non-regulated services and/or services provided both within and outside California were transferred to other SBC subsidiaries, like "Pacific Telesis Shared Services" and "SBC Operations, Inc." However, for legal and regulatory purposes, employees supporting local regulated services were still employed by "Pacific Bell Telephone Company dba SBC California ("SBC California")" which is the SBC subsidiary that provides regulated [[local exchange carrier]] telephone services within the franchise territory in California.

[[File:Pacific Bell 2001.svg|150px|thumb|Pacific Bell logo, 2001-2002]]
On November 18, 2005, SBC completed its acquisition of AT&amp;T Corp. to form [[AT&amp;T|AT&amp;T Inc.]] Pacific Bell is now known as "Pacific Bell Telephone Company", [[d/b/a|dba]] AT&amp;T California.

In 2006, the company's direct parent, originally [[Ameritech]], became [[AT&amp;T Teleholdings]] due to an internal reorganization at AT&amp;T. Its former direct parent, Pacific Telesis Group, was legally merged into AT&amp;T Teleholdings.

In 2007, local telephone service in California was further deregulated, resulting in price increases for AT&amp;T California customers.&lt;ref&gt;Temple, James, [https://www.sfgate.com/technology/dotcommentary/article/AT-amp-T-rates-skyrocket-since-deregulation-4204388.php "AT&amp;T rates skyrocket since deregulation"], ''San Francisco Chronicle'', 2013-01-18.

'''The Peak Time''' is an international student business competition organized every year by the students of the [[Stockholm School of Economics in Riga]]. Currently, it is one of the biggest international events held in the [[Baltic states|Baltic States]], attracting attention from about around 2000 students from 70 countries, i.e., USA, Germany, UK, Brazil, Canada, Singapore, Sweden, China, Italy, and others. Over 16 years, thousands of students have applied and competed against each other, to win prizes and gain experience. Participants of the competition are tested in their [[Business analysis|analytic]] and [[Decision-making|decision making]] skills in an online business simulation provided by CESIM, but their ability to provide creative solutions for real life business problems is challenged in [[Case study|case studies]] prepared by consultancy companies. Teams and individuals which break to the finals in [[Riga]] not only compete for main prizes, but also have an opportunity to listen to world famous speakers and attend social and networking events.

== History ==

Peak Time has originated in year 1999, where it was first organized at the Stockholm School of Economics in Riga, exclusively by the students themselves. The initial aim of the competition was “to find the most talented and passionate students from the Baltic States, involve top companies that were looking for high-performing employees and establish an annual meeting platform – [http://www.peaktime.org Peak Time]”. As time passed by, it started to become more and more international, and now it gathers around 1.5 thousand participants from around 70 countries around the world. The motto of Peak Time is BE THE ONE WHO SHAPES TOMORROW OF BUSINESS.

== Stages of the competition ==
[[File:New Pictured (3).png|thumb|right|Structure of Peak Time competition]]

* '''Online registration'''
Participants register as a team of four people or as an individual, when the registration for the competition is opened. After the participants have registered and sent in their applications, the preliminary online round of the competition starts.

* '''Preliminary CESIM simulation rounds''' 
The first stage is playing in a business simulation, provided by the Finnish company CESIM. In the business simulation participants have to operate a production company in a competitive market and play against other teams in the assigned group. The goal of the simulation is to gain the biggest share of the market. After the simulation round, the results are summed up, and top 100 teams and top 100 individuals are invited to the next round of the competition.

* '''Case studies and Team portfolios''' 
The next round of the competition is solving a case study. Case study is usually a challenging task - teams and individuals are provided with raw data and other relevant information about a company, market, country etc. and they have to provide both numerical and creative analysis for the given tasks. For example: how to cut on costs, without making the customer suffer from that.After the case study solutions are evaluated, 16 teams (64 people) and 16 individuals (16 people) are invited to come to the final stage which is held in Riga. If a person is invited as an individual, he or she is randomly given a team (to form 4 teams of 4 individual participants in each team) whereas those who come as teams continue to participate together.

* '''Final event''' 
The finals in Riga have three stages: the first day is CESIM simulations, where the participants once again have to play a more complex yet faster version of the CESIM simulation. The next day they are given a case study, which they once again have to solve and present this time live to jury members. After the two stages are finished, the results are summed up and the top 5 teams are selected, who will have to prove their worthiness once more - they will receive another case study which they will then have to solve and present during only a couple of hours. Afterwards, the teams are ranked once again by the same jury members, and the winners of Peak Time are finally chosen.

== Final event ==
The final event is not only about a tough competition. It's also a good time to meet new friends and acquaintances. Throughout the three days, the participants have special evening programmes: team building activities in the city, led by our student compadres, Cultural and National evenings, where the participants share something that they brought from their countries, or experience what Latvian culture has to offer. And of course a party. It is held on the day the top 5 is selected - during the party the winners are announced and leave to prepare for the next day, whereas the other finalists party SSE Riga style.

The '''Peer Leadership''' is a school educational program that looks upon [[upperclassmen]] to help ease the transition to the underclassman's respective freshmen year, usually run in public Universities and high schools. The Peer Program is considered to stress communal interaction and social insight. Before meeting with smaller groups of newcomers the larger Peer Leader is trained to deal and mentor with the educational needs the newcomers may express.

==The Five Stages Approach==

The [[methodology]] most commonly used in training the members of Peer is known as the Five Stages Approach, which teaches Peer Leaders about the five stages of a group. It is important to note that this is the interpretation of the journey, per se, that many peer groups embark upon. The stages are:

Stage One: ''Forming'', which understands that upon first creating groups, the members will be nervous. This stage remains crucial for leaders to emerge.

Stage Two: ''[[Norm (sociology)|Norm]]ing'', following ''forming'', is the stage in which group members begin to adjust to their new, institutionalized atmosphere. The Peer members themselves begin to initiate general conversation and, within time, to manifest state-sponsored curriculum upon their members.

Stage Three: ''[[Storm]]ing'', the stage in which the freshmen begin to fight for roles in the group. Often conflict erupts emotionally as true feelings are expressed and group members learn about how others perceive them.

Stage Four: ''[[Performing]]'', the point in which the group members have the capacity to feel comfortable with each other. Unlike the stage preceding it, many of the emotions felt on this level are of trust and kindness, although apathy and disinterest may also peak in certain members during this stage.

Stage Five: ''[[Mourning]] and [[Reform]]'', the final stage which involves a parting of ways as group members review and reflect on the past. At the same time, they also focused on their future lives and ways that they will impart their differences upon the world. The Peer Leader must stress that it is the responsibility of the individual group members to act responsibly and morally in their future endeavors, taking care to especially stress the value of autonomy and self-direction.This is the most vital of all stages it ties all the stages together and helps to students cope with their feelings as they move on.

== Peer Recognition ==

Peer leaders often have various ways of recognizing each other as well as expressing the Peer bond and emotional trust between Peer leaders. There are many levels on which Peer recognition functions, starting from the most basic and common form to the most complex form:

Level 1: ''Fist Peer'': This is a soft fist pound in which Peer leaders recognize each other and express their bond through Peer, often repeating such phrases as "Peer" or "Peer love". This is by far the most common form of Peer recognition.

Level 2: ''Eye Peer'': This type of [[Recognition (sociology)|recognition]] involves Peer leaders making eye contact with each other for several seconds, followed by a slight [[head nod]], which signifies that both leaders recognize each other as fellow Peer members. The Eye Peer works well because it can allow Peer members to bond from long distances.

Level 3: ''Mental Peer'': The [[mind|Mental]] Peer allows a Peer leader to recognize the presence of other Peer members without making direct contact, as well as allowing the Peer member to recognize when other members are thinking of Peer.

These 3 levels are the only known levels of Peer recognition, although other, more complex forms are reputed to be in development. Some forms of Peer recognition vary from school to school and program to program and may contain handshakes, shared sayings or  certain high five like motions or dance moves. These forms of peer recognition are usually handed down through the years and their exact meanings safeguarded.

== Arguments Against Peer Leadership ==

Some object to the standardization that the program imposes upon its members, especially within the high school level, where a significant majority of the freshmen class may be members. For example, Peer Leaders are given curriculum to follow each week under strict instruction to not deviate. Much of the curriculum that Peer Leaders and members give/receive, respectively, is pre-screened by school officials, in addition to having been directly handed down from the respective state Department of Education (i.e. NJ Dept. of Education, NJ being the first state to implement the Peer Program). Thus, an argument can be made that neither freshmen nor seniors have input on the information and pro-social lessons that they must discuss, and are forced into discussions on topics that are frequently irrelevant, unimportant, or generally uninteresting. High School freshmen have especially been known to express their dissent about issues, rules, and values that are taught to them. Furthermore, not all group members feel comfortable discussing personal problems and giving input to conversation, leading to an estrangement between the more socially-oriented group members and those who are more introverted in nature. For many freshmen, large Peer Groups (as many as 20+ in several instances) are intimidating and may reach a state of uncontrollability on the part of the Peer Leaders, who lack the authority of teachers.

The Peer Leader selection process has been a particular subject of scrutiny. Peer Leaders chosen are typically gregarious and outgoing, and females comprised 65% of the Peer force within the 2008-2009 Somerville High School school year. Through a series of group examinations in which random Peer applicants are given physical leadership puzzles to complete within specified time periods, the most outspoken individuals are looked upon highly. Through group interviews that follow, seniors that are similarly self-confident and socially agreeable are chosen as Peer Leaders. Those judged to have a speaking impediment, perceived shyness of character, or any other noticeable personality flaw(s) are passed up in favor of other students. Seniors who have been given a certain number of after school, and/or Saturday detentions, and/or suspensions are officially banned from the program and cannot apply. Through careful selection of Peer Leaders, socially acceptable role models for incoming freshmen students can be chosen and institutional image reinforced.

[[File:LosAngeles-Plaza-1869.jpg|thumb|''La Plaza'', as seen from the [[Pico House]], c.1869. The "[[Nuestra Señora Reina de los Ángeles Asistencia|Old Plaza Church]]" is to the left, the brick reservoir on the right, and in the center of the plaza, was the original terminus of the [[Zanja Madre]].]]

'''''El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Ángeles''''' (the Town of Our Lady the Queen of the Angels) was the Spanish civilian ''[[Municipality|pueblo]]'' founded in 1781, which by the 20th century became the American [[metropolis]] of [[Los Angeles]].

Official settlements in [[Alta California]] were of three types: ''[[presidio]]'' (military), ''[[Spanish missions in California|mission]]'' (religious) and ''pueblo'' (civil). The Pueblo de los Ángeles was the second pueblo (town) created during the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonization]] of California (the first was [[History of San Jose, California#First Spanish pueblo in California San José/|San Jose]], in 1777). ''El Pueblo de la Reina de los Ángeles''—'The Town of the Queen of Angels'&lt;ref&gt;http://www.laalmanac.com/history/hi03b.htm&lt;/ref&gt; was founded twelve years after the first ''presidio'' and ''mission'', the [[Presidio of San Diego]] and the [[Mission San Diego de Alcalá]] (1769). The original settlement consisted of forty-four people in eleven families, recruited mostly from [[Estado de Occidente]]. As new settlers arrived and soldiers retired to civilian life in Los Angeles, the town became the principal urban center of southern Alta California, whose social and economic life revolved around the raising of livestock on the expansive ''[[Ranchos of California|ranchos]]''.

==Founding==
In 1542 [[Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo]], with a commission from Viceroy [[Antonio de Mendoza]], was the first European to sail along and explore the California coast. Although he claimed all he saw as territory of the Spanish Empire, no efforts at colonization were made for over two hundred years. Concerned about colonizing efforts by the Russians and French, Spain set plans in motion in the 1760s to establish a presence and defend its claim to the territory.

The Spanish settlement did not reach Alta California until 1769, when explorer [[Gaspar de Portolà]] reached the San Diego area via the first land route from [[Mexico]]. Accompanying him were two [[Franciscan]] [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|Padres]], [[Junípero Serra]] and [[Juan Crespí]], who recorded the expedition. As they came through today's [[Elysian Park, Los Angeles|Elysian Park]], they were awed by a river that flowed from the northwest, past their point and on southward. Crespí named the river ''El Río de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Ángeles de Porciúncula'', meaning, in Spanish, "the River of Our Lady Queen of the Angels of Porciuncula".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.laalmanac.com/history/hi03a.htm . accessed 7/21/2010&lt;/ref&gt; The name derives from [[Santa Maria degli Angeli (Assisi)|Santa Maria degli Angeli]] (Italian: "St. Mary of the Angels") which is the name of the small town in Italy housing the [[Porziuncola|Porciuncula]], the church where St. Francis of Assisi, founder of the Franciscan order, carried out his religious life. The river that was called the Porciuncula is today's [[Los Angeles River]]. Because the future town's name was a take on this "[[Queen of Heaven]]" Marian title, various versions of Crespí's formula would be used for the town, including the exceedingly long ''El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Ángeles sobre el Río Porciúncula''.&lt;ref&gt;Historian Doyce B. Nunis, Jr., has traced the longer name to the histories written by the Franciscan missionaries, especially [[Francisco Palóu]], who wished to play up the region's connections to their [[Roman Catholic religious order]]. Pool, Bob, [http://articles.latimes.com/2005/mar/26/local/me-name26 "City of Angels' First Name Still Bedevils Historians."] ''Los Angeles Times'' (March 26, 2005), Sec. A-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the expedition, Father Crespí observed a location along the river that would be good for a settlement or mission. However, in 1771, Father Serra instead commissioned two missionaries to establish the [[Mission San Gabriel Arcángel]]-San Gabriel Mission near the present day [[Whittier Narrows]] section of the [[San Gabriel River (California)|San Gabriel River]]. The missionaries encountered resistance from the [[Tongva people|Tongva]] to their attempts to [[Indian Reductions|resettle]] the Natives on the mission. The mission encountered further trouble in 1776 when a flood damaged the mission, convincing the missionaries to move and rebuild the mission on a higher and more defensible location: its present site in [[San Gabriel, California|San Gabriel]]. The first Spanish governor of [[Las Californias]], [[Felipe de Neve]] had, as well, recommended to [[Antonio María de Bucareli y Ursúa|Viceroy Bucareli]] Father Crespí's location on the Río Porciúncula ([[Los Angeles River]]) for a mission. Instead, in 1781, [[Charles III of Spain|King Charles III]] mandated that a pueblo be built on the site instead, which would be the second town in Alta California, after [[Pueblo of San José|San José de Guadalupe]] in 1777. The monarch, disregarding the production and trade roles of the missions, saw a greater need for secular pueblos to be established as the centers of agriculture and commerce to supply the crown's ever-growing military presence in "Nueva California." The priests at the missions ignored the royal mandate and continued their ranching, trading and production of tallow, soap, hides, and beef, often in competition with new pueblo ventures.

===Settlement===
{{See also|Los Angeles Pobladores}}
Governor de Neve took his assignment seriously and had a complete set of maps and plans drawn up by May 1780 for the layout and settlement of the new pueblo, including the placement of government houses, town houses, the church, the fields, the farms, and access to the river – the ''Instrucción'' and the [http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/hb7f59p41q/ ''Reglamento para el gobierno de la Provincia de Californias''].&lt;ref&gt;Nunis, Doyce B., Jr. ''The Founding Documents of Los Angeles: A Bilingual Edition''.

[https://archive.org/stream/outwestland06archrich#page/76 Available online at Internet Archive (retrieved July 2018)]&lt;/ref&gt; But gathering the ''pobladores''-settlers was a little more difficult. After failing to recruit the target number of families in [[Sonora]], he had to go as far as [[Sinaloa]] to finally end up with 11 families, that is, 11 men, 11 women, and 22 children of various [[Casta|Spanish American castes]]: [[Criollo (people)|Criollo]], [[Mulatto]] and ''[[Black people|Negro]]''.&lt;ref&gt;The California ''Reglamento'' here was following Book 4, Title 5, Law X of the ''Recompilación de las [[Laws of the Indies|Leyes de Indias]]'' and the 101st Ordinance of Philip II's Ordinances Concerning Discoveries.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LA founding pueblo marker.jpg|thumb|Monument commemorating origin of Pueblo de Los Angeles]]

As local lore tells it, on September 4, 1781 the 44 ''pobladores'' gathered at [[San Gabriel Mission]] and, escorted by a military detachment and two priests from the Mission, set out for the site that Crespí had chosen. In reality, several of the families were probably already working on their plots of land as early as late July.&lt;ref&gt;The families arrived at San Gabriel Mission in two groups. The first in early June and the second in mid August. The second group had to be quarantined for a few days due to an outbreak of [[smallpox]] among it. The September 4 date seems to reflect the day the formal foundation documents were drawn up. Ríos-Bustamante, ''Mexican Los Ángeles'', 50–53.&lt;/ref&gt; Governor de Neve gave the new town the name ''El Pueblo de la Reina de los Ángeles''-The Town of the Queen of the Angels. Per the [[Laws of the Indies]] and ''Reglamento'' the new towns in Alta California were to have four square [[League (unit)|leagues]] of land; that is a distance marked by one league in each [[cardinal direction]] from the town center.&lt;ref&gt;Guinn, J.

Book 4, Title 5, Law VI of the ''Recompilación de Leyes de Indias'' and Ordinances 88 and 89 of the Ordinances Concerning Discoveries.&lt;/ref&gt; The streets, however, were laid out at forty-five degrees from the cardinal directions, a plan which is still preserved in [[Downtown Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.raremaps.com/gallery/detail/17775/Map_Of_The_City_Of_Los_Angeles_Showing_the_Confirmed_Limits_Surveyed_in/Bancroft-Thayer-Brooks.html  Map Of The City Of Los Angeles Showing the Confirmed Limits…] below in External_Links.&lt;/ref&gt; The old town limits are still marked by Hoover and Indiana Streets in the west and east respectively.  In 1784 an [[Nuestra Señora Reina de los Angeles Asistencia|''asistencia'' or sub-mission]] of the San Gabriel Mission was established on the central [[plaza]], to provide religious services to the settlers.

===Government===
{{See also|List of pre-statehood mayors of Los Angeles, California}}
[[File:La Iglesia de Nuestra Señora Reina de los Angeles.jpg|thumb|300px|right|People gather in the original Plaza in front of the &lt;br&gt; "[[La Iglesia de Nuestra Señora Reina de los Angeles|Old Plaza Church]]", ''circa'' 1890-1900.]]

The pueblo came under the jurisdiction of the [[Provincias Internas|Commandancy General of the Internal Provinces]] in the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]]. As a pueblo, Los Angeles was granted a ''[[cabildo (council)|cabildo]]'' (town council). The first municipal officers, the ''regidores'' (council members) and ''[[alcalde]]'' (municipal magistrate), were appointed by Governor de Neve. Subsequent ones were elected annually by the settlers, the ''[[Vecino|vecinos pobladores]]''. Since the government of Las Californias had a strong military orientation in this early phase of colonization, the civilian ''cabildo'' was originally supervised by a ''commisionado'' (commissioner) appointed by the ''[[Commandant (rank)|comandante]]'' (commander) of the [[Presidio of Santa Barbara]], who was charged with making sure the ''alcalde'' and ''regidores'' carried out their duties correctly. The first ''commisionado'' was [[José Vicente Feliz]], one of the soldiers who accompanied the original 44 settlers to the pueblo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cityplanning.lacity.org/StaffRpt/CHC/8-21-08/CHC-2008-2724.pdf | title=Los Angeles Department of City Planning, Recommendation Report | accessdate=March 9, 2016 | date=August 21, 2008 | publisher=City of Los Angeles}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first recorded ''alcalde'' was José Vanegas, who served in 1786 and 1796. Vanegas was first listed as an [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]] in the original 1781 ''padrón'' (register) but then as a [[Mestizo]] in the 1790 census.&lt;ref&gt;Unfortunately the records of the Spanish-era ''cabildo'' were lost and the relevant parts of the Provincial archives were burned in the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]], so the surviving list of ''alcaldes'' is incomplete.

(Berkeley: University of California Press, 1977), 74–75. {{ISBN|0-520-03410-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The next few ''alcaldes'' reflected the mixed population of the small settlement: José Sinova, a [[Criollo (people)|Criollo]], 1789; [[Jose Maria Verdugo#Mariano Verdugo|Mariano de la Luz Verdugo]], a Criollo, 1790; and Juan Francisco Reyes, a [[Mulatto]], 1793. Among the first ''regidores'' were Felipe Santiago García (a Criollo) and Manuel Camero (a Mulatto in the 1781 ''padrón'', and a Mestizo in 1790 census). In judicial affairs, both military and civil cases were appealed to the [[Real Audiencia of Guadalajara|Audiencia of Guadalajara]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hubert Howe Bancroft|Bancroft, Hubert Howe]].

===''La Iglesia de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Ángeles''===
{{Main|La Iglesia de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Ángeles}}
On August 18, 1814 Father Luis Gíl y Taboada placed the cornerstone of a new [[Franciscan]] church amidst the ruins of the [[Nuestra Señora Reina de los Ángeles Asistencia|original ''asistencia'']]. The completed structure was dedicated on December 8, 1822.&lt;ref name="ruscin49"&gt;Ruscin, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; A replacement chapel, named ''La Iglesia de Nuestra Señora de los Ángeles'' (The Church of Our Lady of the Angels) was rebuilt utilizing materials of the original church in 1861. The term ''Reina'' (queen) was added later to reconcile the church's name with that of the town.&lt;ref name="ruscin50"&gt;Ruscin, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; The small chapel, also called "''La Placita''" and "the Plaza Church," served the total [[Californio]] and immigrant  Roman Catholic community as the only church in the vicinity of the City of Los Angeles until the 1876 construction of the [[Cathedral of Saint Vibiana]]. Saint Vibiana Cathedral became the English-speaking parish and ''La Placita'' became the Spanish-speaking parish.&lt;ref&gt;Poole and Ball. ''El Pueblo: The Historic Heart of Los Angeles'', 111.&lt;/ref&gt; "The Plaza Church" still stands today, exhibiting [[Spanish Colonial architecture|Spanish Colonial]] and [[Carpenter Gothic]] architectural styles.

The Los Angeles parish was under the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Hermosillo|Diocese of Sonora]] until 1840, when a new [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Monterey in California|Diocese of the Two Californias]] was established to serve the [[Baja California Peninsula]] and Alta California. Both the dioceses of Sonara and the Two Californias were suffragan of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mexico|Archdiocese of Mexico]].

==Mexican independence and era==
{{unreferenced|section|date=September 2017}}
{{See also|History of California through 1899#Mexican era (1821–1846)|l1=California History: Mexican era (1821–1846)}}
After Mexico's [[Mexican War of Independence|War of Independence]] (1810–1821) from Spain, life began to change in Los Angeles and [[Alta California]] . With the [[Mexican secularization act of 1833|secularization of the missions]], their land was distributed for the establishment of many more [[Ranchos of California|ranchos]]. The Native population was displaced or absorbed into the [[Hispanic]] population.

Beginning about 1827, Los Angeles, now the largest pueblo of the territory, became a rival of [[Monterey, California|Monterey]] for the honor of being the capital of California; was the seat of conspiracies to overthrow the Mexican authority; and the stronghold of the South California party in the bickering and struggles that lasted down to the American occupation.

In about 1834, [[Richard Henry Dana, Jr.]] visited [[San Pedro Harbor]] as a sailor. His book, ''[[Two Years Before the Mast]]'', includes a brief depiction of the pueblo and area, then dependent on the export of cattle [[Hide (skin)|hides]] and [[tallow]]. In 1835 it was made a city by the Mexican Congress, and declared the capital, but the last provision was not enforced and was soon recalled. In 1836–1838, it was the headquarters of [[Carlos Antonio Carrillo]], a legally named but never ''de facto'' governor of California, whose jurisdiction was never recognized in the north; and, in 1845–1847, it was the actual capital.

In 1842, a sheep rancher, pausing under an oak tree, discovered gold in [[Placerita Canyon State Park|Placerita Canyon]] in [[Rancho San Francisco]], just north of the city  sparking a minor [[gold rush]]. In subsequent decades local mining employed [[Underground mining (hard rock)|hard rock]] and [[Placer mining|placer]] techniques. Land however turned out to be the more "profitable gold", as ranching and development expanded as the town and region grew.

===Mexican–American War===
{{Further|Mexican–American War}}
[[Manifest Destiny]] reached California at the time of the [[Mexican–American War]] (1846–1848). On June 18, 1846 a small group of [[Yankee]]s raised the California [[Bear Flag]] and declared independence from Mexico in the [[Bear Flag Revolt]] in [[Northern California]]. United States troops then took control of the [[presidio]]s at [[Monterey, California|Monterey]] and San Francisco, and proclaimed the invading "conquest" complete. In [[Southern California]], the Mexican citizens repelled American troops for five months, utilizing about 160 [[vaquero]]s, or cowboys, against about 700 American forces.

Los Angeles initially surrendered to the surprise invasion by United States forces. The small Mexican forces of Los Angeles fled at the approach of US troops, and August 13, 1846 the American flag was raised over the city. A garrison of fifty US Marines under [[Archibald Gillespie]] was left in control. The city's population had been rent by factional quarrels when war broke out between [[Mexico]] and the United States, but the occupation caused both factions to unite against the invading Americans.  Gillespie's garrison was compelled to withdraw in October when the residents, Californio Lancers, vaqueros on horseback without firearms, only lances,  revolted and chased the US occupying force back to the San Pedro Harbor. Los Angeles was not retaken until Commodore Stockton again captured the city on January 10, 1847, after the battles at the [[Siege of Los Angeles]], [[Battle of Dominguez Rancho]], [[Battle of San Pasqual]], [[Battle of Rio San Gabriel]] and the [[Battle of La Mesa]]. These battles, in which the [[Californios]] were greatly outmanned and outgunned, represented the important overt resistance to the establishment of the American regime in the [[Los Angeles Basin]]. Lieutenant-Colonel [[John C. Frémont|Frémont]] and [[List of pre-statehood governors of California|Governor of Alta California]] [[Andrés Pico]] signed the [[Treaty of Cahuenga]], an informal agreement to cease fighting in California at the [[Campo de Cahuenga]] in the [[San Fernando Valley]] in January 1847. Under the later comprehensive 1848 [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], Mexico formally ceded nearly half its nation's total territory, including Alta California, to the United States.

==Statehood==
Located on the [[coastal plain]]s surrounding the [[Los Angeles River]], the town became a cattle [[ranching]] center, expanding on the role during the [[California Gold Rush]]. It was the center for the [[ranchos of California|Alta California ranchos]] in the surrounding regions, further developing shipping ability from [[San Pedro Bay (California)|San Pedro Bay]]. In the latter 19th century the development of Los Angeles shifted the business district and cultural center of town to the south, present day [[Downtown Los Angeles]], leaving the Pueblo district to decline, and by 1900 it was a less favored area, with the [[Chinatown, Los Angeles|Chinatown district]] and other ethnic "[[ghetto]]s", and the blight of new railroad adjacent industrial areas.

==Modern state park==
A 1920s restoration drive led by Christine Sterling began a restoration of the historic area, starting with [[Olvera Street]]. Today the Pueblo's original outline is preserved by the [[Los Angeles Plaza Historic District|El Pueblo de Los Angeles Historic Monument]]. Among its saved and restored buildings is the oldest standing residence in Los Angeles City, the 1818 [[Avila Adobe]] built by [[Cornelio Avila#Francisco Avila|Francisco Avila]] who owned [[Rancho Las Cienegas]] -''"mid Wishire area"'' and a successful cattle enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;Note: The oldest house in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles '''County''']] is the Henry Gage Mansion, built in 1795 on the [[Rancho San Antonio (Lugo)|Rancho San Antonio]] site, presently [[Bell Gardens, California|Bell Gardens]].&lt;/ref&gt; Across Olvera Street stands the 1887 [[Los Angeles Plaza Historic District#Sepulveda House|Eloisa Martinez de Sepulveda House]], that now is the [[Los Angeles Plaza Historic District|Los Angeles Plaza Historic District Visitors Center]]. The 1939 construction of the significant transit hub and architectural landmark, the Los Angeles [[Union Station (Los Angeles)|Union Station]] east of the old Plaza, added to the Pueblo area's reinvigoration.

Of archaeological interest is the discovery of sections of the original brick lined ''[[Zanja Madre]]''-the ''Mother Ditch'', which was a "surface and underground" gravity fed [[canal]] and [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]], that brought water from the [[Los Angeles River|Rio Porciuncula-Los Angeles River]] near the [[Arroyo Seco (Los Angeles County)|Arroyo Seco]] confluence, to the colonial pueblo and later the American city into the latter 19th century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5183">'''Robert Burnett Choate Jr.''' (November 6, 1924 – May 3, 2009) was an American [[businessperson|businessman]], [[political activism|political activist]], and self-described "[[lobbying|citizen lobbyist]]" most famous for his work in [[consumer protection]].

Born in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], the son of the wealthy publisher of the ''[[Boston Herald]]'', Choate attended the [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] in [[New Hampshire]] for his [[high school]] education. After [[World War II]], during which he served in the [[United States Navy]], he received his [[bachelor's degree]] in [[civil engineering]] from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1949. Subsequently, he relocated to [[Phoenix, Arizona]], where he worked as a [[construction engineering|construction engineer]] and became wealthy in his own right through [[real estate]] investments.

In the late 1950s, during a trip abroad, he contracted a strain of [[hepatitis]]. While recuperating, he read the [[memoir]]s of [[Walter Francis White]], the former leader of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]]. Choate, a lifelong [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], became inspired to use his wealth to battle what he saw as the greatest social ills afflicting America: [[poverty]], [[hunger]], and a lack of [[civil and political rights]] for [[African American]]s and other [[minority group]]s.

Among the ventures he undertook to that end over the next several decades were the publishing of a [[magazine]] dedicated to [[social justice]], called ''Reveille''; founding a number of [[social welfare provision|social welfare]] programs and [[charitable organization|charities]] in the Phoenix area; organizing a [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]] conference on poverty, which included such speakers as [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Hubert Humphrey]] and [[Peace Corps]] director [[Sargent Shriver]]; working in [[Washington, D.C.]] as a lobbyist for groups such as the [[Citizens Crusade Against Poverty]]; and serving as a [[consultant]] to the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]], where he was credited with initiating a national study on [[malnutrition]]. His efforts were later credited with the formation of the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs]], which operated from 1968 to 1977, and the creation of the [[White House Conference]] on Food, Nutrition, and Health, which met in 1969.

In September 1970, Choate became famous when he testified before the Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs on the nutritional content (specifically, [[vitamin]]s, [[dietary mineral]]s, and [[protein]]) of the 60 bestselling [[brand]]s of dry [[breakfast cereal]] in the United States. Choate told the Committee, that, on a scale from 0 to 900, with 900 being the best, 40 of the cereals ranked below 100 and were therefore "[[empty calorie]]s" which "fatten but do little to prevent malnutrition." Only three products -- [[Kellogg Company]]'s [[Product 19]] and [[General Mills]]' [[Kaboom (breakfast cereal)|Kaboom]] and [[Total (breakfast cereal)|Total]]—scored as high as 700. Choate's testimony received much publicity nationally (with a headline in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' asking, "Breakfast of Chumps?"), sparking a [[public relations]] war between Choate and the various cereal companies. Although the companies heatedly denied Choate's charges, public opinion eventually sided with him, and the companies decided to voluntarily add [[nutrition facts label]]s to their products' boxes, so that consumers could judge their nutritional value for themselves.

In later years, Choate continued his education, receiving a [[master's degree]] in [[education]] from [[Harvard University]], before relocating to [[California]], where he started Operation Civic Serve, a [[non-profit organization]] dedicated to promoting [[volunteering]] amongst [[college]] students. On May 3, 2009, he died of natural causes in a [[retirement community]] in [[Lemon Grove, California]]. He was survived by four children from two of his three [[marriage]]s, each of which ended in [[divorce]], and three grandchildren.

'''Samuel Cooper''' (June 12, 1798 – December 3, 1876) was a career [[United States Army]] staff officer, serving during the [[Second Seminole War]] and the [[Mexican–American War]]. Although little-known today, Cooper was also the highest-ranking [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[General officer|general]] during the [[American Civil War]]. After the conflict, he remained in Virginia as a farmer.

==Early life and career==
Samuel Cooper was born in [[New Hackensack, New York|New Hackensack]], [[Dutchess County, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;Davis, William C. "General Samuel Cooper." In ''Leaders of the Lost Cause: New Perspectives on the Confederate High Command'', edited by [[Gary W. Gallagher]] and Joseph T. Glatthaar, 101–131. Mechanicsburg, PA: Stackpole Books, 2004, 102&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Fitzhugh. "Sketch of the Late General S. Cooper." Southern Historical Society Papers 3, no. 5–6 (June 1877): 271&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mary Boykin Chesnut, ''A Diary from Dixie As Written by Mary Boykin Chesnut'' (New York: D. Appleton and Company, 1905), 150. Cooper's place of birth is often incorrectly given as Hackensack, New Jersey, by Dupuy (p. 189), Eicher (p. 184), Wakelyn (p. 150), and Wright (p. 9); place of birth given as Dutchess County, New York, by Warner (p. 62), or just New York by Snow (p. 305); place of birth given as New Hackensack, New York, by both websites "leeslieutenants.com" and "generalcooper.com".&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a son of Samuel Cooper and his wife Mary Horton.&lt;ref name=Wakelyn150&gt;Wakelyn, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1813 he entered the [[United States Military Academy]] at age 15 and graduated 36th in a class of 40 two years later (the customary length of study in that period.)&lt;ref name="Lee's Lieutenants site biography of Cooper"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leeslieutenants.com/generals/samualCooper.html|title=Lee's Lieutenants site biography of Cooper|publisher=''www.civilwarreference.com''|accessdate=September 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed a [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] [[second lieutenant]] in the U.S. Light Artillery on December 11, 1815. He was promoted to [[first lieutenant]] in 1821 and to [[Captain (OF-2)|captain]] in 1836.&lt;ref name=Eicher185&gt;Eicher, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1827, Cooper married Sarah Maria Mason, becoming the brother-in-law of future Confederate diplomat [[James M. Mason]] and later the father-in-law of [[Union Army|Union]] General [[Frank Wheaton]]. Sarah's sister, Ann Maria Mason, was the mother of Confederate cavalry general [[Fitzhugh Lee]], a nephew of [[Robert E. Lee]], while her brother John Mason, was a son-in-law of Gen. [[Alexander Macomb (general)|Alexander Macomb]]. Cooper served as [[aide-de-camp]] for Gen. Macomb from 1828 to 1836 and under his supervision authored ''A Concise System of Instructions and Regulations for the Militia and Volunteers of the United States''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cooper |first1=Samuel |authorlink=Samuel Cooper (general) |url=https://archive.org/details/concisesystemof00coop |title=A Concise System of Instructions and Regulations for the Militia and Volunteers of the United States |location=Philadelphia |publisher=Robert P. Desilver |year=1836 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:S Cooper US Army.jpg|left|thumb|Cooper in the U.S. Army]]

Cooper served in numerous artillery units until 1837, when he was appointed chief clerk of the [[U.S. War Department]]. In 1838 he received a brevet promotion to [[Major (United States)|major]] and was appointed assistant adjutant general of the Army. Nine years later, with a brevet as [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]], he served in the same capacity.

Cooper's service in the [[Second Seminole War]] of 1841–42 was a rare departure for him from [[Washington, D.C.]] He was chief of staff for Col. [[William J. Worth]], and after hostilities ended he returned to staff duty in Washington from 1842 to 1845.&lt;ref&gt;Dupuy, pp. 189–90.&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper received a brevet promotion to [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] on May 30, 1848, for his War Department service in the [[Mexican–American War]], and was promoted to the permanent rank of colonel in the [[Regular Army (United States)|regular army]] and appointed the army's [[Adjutant General]] on July 15, 1852.&lt;ref name=Eicher185/&gt; Cooper also served very briefly as acting [[United States Secretary of War|U.S. Secretary of War]] in 1857.&lt;ref&gt;Eicher, p. 185. He held the position from March 3 to 6, 1857.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooper was also a slave owner. At the time of the 1850 census, he owned six slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite census | url = | title =  "Seventh Census of the United States, Slave Schedules| year = 1850| location = Ward 1, Washington| roll = | page = | line = 31-36| enumdist = | filmnum = | nafilm = | accessdate = 27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil War service==
At the beginning of the Civil War, Cooper's loyalties were with the South. His wife's family was from Virginia, and he had a close friendship with [[Jefferson Davis]], who had also been U.S. Secretary of War.&lt;ref name=Warner62-3&gt;Warner, pp. 62-3.&lt;/ref&gt; One of his last official acts as Adjutant General of the U.S. Army was to sign an order dismissing [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brig. Gen.]] [[David E. Twiggs]] from the army. Twiggs had surrendered his command and supplies in [[Texas]] to the Confederacy (and was shortly thereafter made a Confederate [[Major General (CSA)|major general]].) This order was dated March 1, 1861, and Cooper resigned six days later. He traveled to [[Montgomery, Alabama]], at the time the Confederacy's capital, to join the Confederate States Army.&lt;ref name="Lee's Lieutenants site biography of Cooper"/&gt;

On reaching Montgomery, Cooper was immediately given a commission as a [[Brig. Gen. (CSA)|brigadier general]] on March 16, 1861.&lt;ref name=Eicher185/&gt; He served as both Adjutant General and [[Inspector General]] of the Confederate Army, a post he held until the end of the war. Cooper provided much-needed organization and knowledge to the fledgling Confederate War Department, drawing on his years performing such duties as Adjutant General of the U.S. Army.&lt;ref name=Warner63&gt;Warner, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 16, 1861, Cooper was promoted to [[General officers in the Confederate States Army#General|full general]] in the Confederate Army.&lt;ref name=Eicher185/&gt; He was one of five men promoted to the grade at that time, and one of only seven during the war, but with the earliest date of rank. Thus, despite his relative obscurity today, he outranked such luminaries as [[Albert Sidney Johnston]], [[Robert E. Lee]], [[Joseph E. Johnston]], and [[P. G. T. Beauregard]].&lt;ref&gt;Eicher, p. 807. Generals (ACSA) Line Command List&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper reported directly to [[President of the Confederate States of America|Confederate President]] Jefferson Davis.&lt;ref name="Lee's Lieutenants site biography of Cooper"/&gt; At the war's end in 1865, Cooper surrendered and was paroled on May 3 at [[Charlotte, North Carolina]].&lt;ref name=Eicher185/&gt;

While building defenses near Washington, D.C., Union forces demolished his home and used its bricks to build a fort dubbed "Traitor's Hill" in Cooper's honor.

==Postbellum life==
Cooper's last official act in office was to preserve the official records of the Confederate Army and turn them over intact to the United States government, where they form a part of the [[Official Records of the American Civil War|''Official Records'']], ''The War of the Rebellion: a Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies'', published starting in 1880. Military historians have highly regarded Cooper for this action.&lt;ref&gt;Lee's Lieutenants site biography of Cooper: "This contribution is said to be Samuel's most lasting contribution to the Confederacy, in overseeing the removal of War Department records from Richmond in April 1865, and protecting them until they could be turned over to Federal authorities..."&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Ezra J. Warner believed that in doing so Cooper was "thereby making a priceless contribution to the history of the period."&lt;ref name=Warner63/&gt;

After the war, Cooper was a farmer at his home, Cameron, near [[Alexandria, Virginia]]. His house had been taken over by the U.S. government during the war and turned into [[Fort Williams (Virginia)|a fort]], but he was able to move into what had been an overseer's house. Due to his age Cooper earned a meager living. On August 4, 1870, Robert E. Lee, on the behalf of other former Confederates, sent Cooper $300. Lee wrote to him saying, "To this sum I have only been able to add $100, but I hope it may enable you to supply some immediate want and prevent you from taxing your strength too much."&lt;ref name="Lee's Lieutenants site biography of Cooper"/&gt; Samuel Cooper died at his home in 1876, and is buried in Alexandria's [[Christ Church (Alexandria, Virginia)|Christ Church Episcopal]] Cemetery.&lt;ref name=Eicher185/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18024">'''Social justice educational leadership''' emphasizes the belief that all students can and will reach proficiency, without exceptions or excuses, and that schools ought to be organized to advance the [[educational equity|equitable]] learning of all students. Rather than focusing on one group of students who traditionally struggle, or who traditionally succeed, social justice leaders address the learning needs of all students. Social justice educational leadership specifically addresses how differences in race, income, language, ability, gender, and sexual orientation influence the design and effectiveness of learning environments. Social justice leadership draws from [[inclusive education]] practices from disability education, but extends the concepts further to support students from diverse groups with a wide range of needs. Through restructuring staff allocation and assessing student progress through disaggregated data, school leaders strive to create schools with equal access and equitable support for all students.

==Goals==
Social justice [[educational leadership|educational leaders]] recognize the role race, ethnicity, family income, ability, gender, and sexual orientation play in predicting student success in school. They commit to creating schools that address societal inequalities by striving to help all students reach academic proficiency. As described by Scheurich and Skrla, "In striving for both equity and excellence... we are aiming for schools in which there are no persistent patterns of differences in academic success or treatment among students grouped by race, ethnicity, culture, neighborhood, income of parents, or home language. In other words, we are aiming to foster schools that literally serve each and every student really well." (pg. 2).&lt;ref name="Scheurich &amp; Skrla"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Glickman|first1=James Joseph Scheurich, Linda Skrla ; foreword by Carl D.|title=Leadership for equity and excellence creating high-achievement classrooms, schools, and districts|date=2003|publisher=Corwin Press|location=Thousand Oaks (Calif.)|isbn=978-0761945864}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to assess whether these patterns of difference exist, social justice leaders use data tools, such as equity audits, to uncover structures that create differences in student learning outcomes.&lt;ref name="Johnson &amp; Avelar La Salle" /&gt; Equity audits use data such as standardized test scores, [[school discipline|discipline]] rates, family involvement in schools, advanced course participation, [[special education]] labeling, at-risk identification, and [[Response to Intervention|intervention]] placement to create profiles of achievement for different student groups in the school. Equity audits reveal [[achievement gap]] trends in these areas, in which traditionally [[marginalized]] students frequently perform at lower levels than their more privileged peers.&lt;ref name="Frattura &amp; Capper" /&gt; Many schools find demographically similar groups of students struggling in academics, language, discipline, graduation rates, and other markers of student success. Once these patterns are identified, social justice leaders equip staff and students with the skills necessary to address discrepancies in student learning needs.&lt;ref name="Capper &amp; Frattura"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frattura|first1=Colleen A. Capper, Elise M.|title=Meeting the needs of students of all abilities : how leaders go beyond inclusion|date=2009|publisher=Corwin Press|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.|isbn=978-1412966955|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student services==

Social justice leadership builds on concepts of [[inclusive education]], in which services are brought to students in the general classroom environment, rather than pulling students out to a resource room. However, social justice leadership diverges somewhat from inclusive education in that full inclusion at all times is not required.&lt;ref name="Capper &amp; Frattura" /&gt; Social justice leaders focus on providing services in classrooms and other flexible spaces that can be accessed by all students, rather than removing students to receive special support in separate classrooms.&lt;ref name=Theoharis&gt;{{cite book|last1=Theoharis|first1=George|title=The school leaders our children deserve : seven keys to equity, social justice, and school reform|date=2009|publisher=Teachers College Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0807749517}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social justice leadership also emphasizes assigning students to classrooms and groups using proportional representation. This means that the proportion of students in any classroom or group should match the natural proportion of students from all demographic groups in the school.&lt;ref name="Johnson &amp; Avelar La Salle"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Salle|first1=Ruth S. Johnson, Robin Avelar La|title=Data strategies to uncover and eliminate hidden inequities : the wallpaper effect|date=2010|publisher=Corwin|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.|isbn=978-1412914932}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if 15% of the student body is [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]], then 15% of every classroom should be Latino, only 15% of students who qualify for special education should be Latino and only 15% of students receiving discipline should be Latino.

This method of bringing services to students in general education environments with proportional representation also differs from pull-out models like [[response to intervention]] (RtI). Many pull-out models identify students struggling in the classroom and assign them to interventions led by educator specialists outside the general education classroom, rather than by their classroom teachers. For students with more significant needs, pull-out interventions may be from several staff, such as from the Title I teacher, reading interventionist, speech therapist, and social worker, introducing multiple adults and environments to students who would most benefit from consistency. This practice locates the responsibility for educating students with additional needs with the interventionist, rather than the classroom teacher, reducing their efficacy.&lt;ref name="Capper &amp; Frattura" /&gt;

== Behavior Management ==
Many school behavior management efforts criminalize small infractions, and maintain a focus on retribution rather than restoration.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alexander|first=Heather S.|date=2002|title=Restorative justice in elementary schools|url=|journal=University of Lethbridge|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, combined with institutional and individual bias, results in a significant overrepresentation of students of color in suspension and expulsion rates.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=González|first=Thalia|date=2012|title=Keeping kids in schools: Restorative justice, punitive discipline, and the school to prison pipeline.|url=|journal=JL &amp; Educ|volume=41|pages=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of social justice in schools purport that exclusionary discipline practices such as suspension and expulsion actively remove students from their school communities and exacerbate feelings of isolation and resentment.

Zero tolerance policies, popularized in the 1990s, have been shown to be ineffective on multiple measures, leaving school leaders looking for alternative strategies to promote safe and orderly learning environments.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt; School leaders focused on social justice are additionally compelled to find strategies that disrupt persisting inequities. This is where restorative justice practices, culturally and linguistically responsive practices (CLRP) and Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) come into play as approaches aiming to address both institutional inequities and the need for safe learning environments.

=== CLR-PBIS ===
PBIS comes with a variety of acronyms. Some schools cut out the “intervention” part, going with the proactive-only PBS system. PBIS is more akin to the three-tiered Response to Intervention system. Others add in the necessity of schoolwide (SW) implementation, dubbing the program SWPBIS.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Closing the school discipline gap: Equitable remedies for excessive exclusion|last=Losen|first=Daniel J.|publisher=Teachers College Press|year=2015|isbn=978-0-8077-5613-3|location=New York, NY|pages=151–165; 207–221}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever variation is used (here, PBIS), the primary practices included in the system are listed below. PBIS has shown promise in reducing exclusionary discipline practices overall, but has not shown, on its own, to be effective at reducing the racial disparities in student discipline, and in some cases has even been shown to exacerbate the discrepancies by further reducing discipline referrals for White students, but not for students of color.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; These criticisms have led to a call for examination of PBIS, and the integration of CLRP with PBIS in order to address systemic inequities in school discipline.

CLRP has its roots in the work of Gloria Ladson-Billings surrounding culturally relevant pedagogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ladson-Billings|first=Gloria|date=1995|title=Toward a theory of culturally relevant pedagogy|url=|journal=American Educational Research Journal|volume=32 |issue=3|pages=465–491}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting on this initial thinking, Ladson-Billings more recently stated:&lt;blockquote&gt;By focusing on student learning and academic achievement versus classroom and behavior management, cultural competence versus cultural assimilation or eradication, and sociopolitical consciousness rather than school-based tasks that have no beyond-school application, I was able to see students take both responsibility for and deep interest in their education. This is the secret behind culturally relevant pedagogy: the ability to link principles of learning with deep understanding of (and appreciation for) culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ladson-Billings|first=Gloria|date=2014|title=Culturally responsive pedagogy 2.0: aka the remix|url=|journal=Harvard Educational Review|volume=84 |issue=1|pages=74–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Other scholars have echoed and built upon this work, giving linguistic relevance footing in the literature, proposing specific practices that may help teachers improve pedagogical relevance, and considering how to best integrate PBIS and CLRP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vincent|first=Claudia|last2=Randall|first2=Carla|last3=Cartledge|first3=Gwendolyn|last4=Tobin|first4=Tary|last5=Swain-Bradway|first5=Jessica|date=2011|title=Toward a conceptual integration of cultural responsiveness and schoolwide positive behavior support|url=|journal=Journal of Positive Behavior Interventions|volume=13 |issue=4|pages=219–229}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Culturally and linguistically responsive teaching and learning: Classroom practices for student success|last=Hollie|first=Sharroky|publisher=Shell Educational Publishing, Inc.|year=2013|isbn=978-1-4258-0686-6|location=Huntington Beach, CA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Key Features of PBIS ====
* Clearly defining behavioral expectations valued by the school community.
* Proactively teaching what those expected behaviors look like in various school settings at least once a year.
* Frequently rewarding students who comply with behavioral expectations.
* Administering a clearly defined continuum of consequences for behavioral violations.
* Continuously collecting and analyzing data to assess students’ responsiveness to the behavioral support provided.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

=== Restorative Justice ===
Thalia González describes restorative justice in schools as “an approach to discipline that engages all parties in a balanced practice that brings together all people impacted by an issue or behavior.”&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt; Heather Alexander details the roots of these practices, stating, “The principles of restorative justice are consistent with many indigenous traditions, including Canadian First Nations people and the Maori in New Zealand.”&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; She also links restorative justice to “entangled roots in native, religious, and legal communities.”&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Alexander and González have studied how the underpinnings of various cultural, religious, and judicial practices have made their way into the philosophy and practice of restorative justice.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Multiple scholars advocate for restorative practices as an alternative to exclusionary approaches to discipline, both in schools and in the criminal justice system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karp|first=David R.|last2=Breslin|first2=Beau|date=2001|title=Restorative justice in school communities|url=|journal=Youth &amp; Society|volume=33 |issue=2|pages=249–272}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Many different practices (including, but not limited to: circles, mediation, conferencing, and youth courts) are labeled as restorative justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mapping Leadership: The tasks that matter for improving teaching and learning in schools.|last=Halverson|first=Richard|publisher=Jossey Bass|year=2017|isbn=|location=San Francisco|pages=98–116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trevor Fronius, et. al describe restorative justice as “a broad term that encompasses a growing social movement to institutionalize peaceful and non-punitive approaches for addressing harm, responding to violations of legal and human rights, and problem solving.”&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fronius|first=Trevor|last2=Persson|first2=Hannah|last3=Guckenburg|first3=Sarah|last4=Hurley|first4=Nancy|last5=Petrosino|first5=Anthony|date=2016|title=Restorative justice in US schools: A research review|url=http://www.antoniocasella.eu/restorative/Fronius_feb16.pdf|journal=WestEd Justice and Prevention Research Center|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition speaks to restorative justice as more of a collection of practices rooted in a common philosophy than a specific “program.” Fronius, et. al go on to say that “the emphasis on the harm done rather than the act is a widely recognized principle across the RJ literature.”&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; and they speak to Dorothy Vaandering’s work surrounding “how to use shame as a path toward reintegration rather than stigmatization."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vaandering|first=Dorothy|date=2010|title=The significance of critical theory for restorative justice in education|url=|journal=Review of Education, Pedagogy &amp; Cultural Studies|volume=32 |issue=2|pages=145–176}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
'''Key Principles of Restorative Justice''' 
* Repairing Harm, 
* Involving Stakeholders 
* Transforming Community Relationships&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

==Staff allocation==

Both inclusive and pull-out models seek to reduce the student to teacher ratio, but inclusive models do so by bringing services and staff expertise to students. Thus, social justice leaders need to strategically plan how to effectively allocate their limited staff resources.&lt;ref name="Frattura &amp; Capper"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Capper|first1=Elise M. Frattura, Colleen A.|title=Leading for social justice : transforming schools for all learners|date=2007|publisher=Corwin Press|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|isbn=978-0761931782}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than having several specialists who work with students with specific needs, leaders structure collaborative teams of classroom teachers, cross-categorical special education teachers, and bilingual resource teachers to support classrooms of students.&lt;ref name=Theoharis /&gt;

==Critiques==

Social justice educational leadership has been critiqued in several ways. Some feel social justice leadership reinforces the categorization of students, even though the approach emphasizes reducing unnecessary student labeling.&lt;ref name="Scheurich &amp; Skrla" /&gt; The data equity audits 
focus mostly on identifying inequitable learning outcomes,&lt;ref name="Johnson &amp; Avelar La Salle" /&gt; but few solutions and strategies are suggested for improving these outcomes. By identifying the classroom teacher as responsible for ensuring all students reach proficiency, many teachers feel unsupported in the work and struggle to adequately [[differentiated instruction|differentiate]] lessons for their students. Finally, social justice educational leadership emphasizes proficiency as measured by [[standardized test]] scores,&lt;ref name="Frattura &amp; Capper" /&gt; which limits the space for innovation and teaching that builds higher-order thinking, which is difficult to measure on standardized tests.

==Background==
Sioeng grew up in Indonesia. Raised in an ethnically Chinese family, he has a strong affinity for China, which is now the focus of his business interests, while he also admires the United States - he and his family have been based in [[Los Angeles]] since 1987.

==Business interests==
While in his 20s, Sioeng became successful selling foam rubber padding. In the 1970s, he was quick to recognize that money could be made in emerging China and he built a multimillion-dollar fortune selling the Chinese used factory equipment – such as for [[cigarette]]- and toy-manufacturing and in the medical field – and exporting [[Smoking in the People's Republic of China|Chinese cigarettes]] to the West. In China, he goes by the name Xiong Delong.&lt;ref name = bw1/&gt;

He quickly saw that by donating money to good causes, such as to build schools, hospitals, and roads, he could gain favour with local governments. In [[Yunnan]], this approach gained him a license to sell the popular [[Hongtashan]] brand of cigarettes – called 'Red Pagoda Mountain' in the U.S. – outside of China. He now runs the business as a (dollar-based) joint venture.&lt;ref name = bw1/&gt;

He is owner of the Chinese-language [[International Daily News]], published in the United States and Indonesia.

==US campaign finance controversy==
Mr Ted Sioeng was a major figure in the [[1996 United States campaign finance controversy]], notably sitting next to [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Al Gore]] at fundraising events after having donated to the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] funds allegedly linked to China.&lt;ref name = bw1/&gt; In 1997 the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] was informed by the U.S. attorney general, and the directors of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], and [[National Security Agency|NSA]] that they had credible intelligence information indicating Sioeng was an agent of China.&lt;ref name=briefing&gt;Duffy, Brian, and Woodward, Bob, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/campfin/stories/cf091297b.htm "Senate Panel Is Briefed on China Probe Figure"], ''Washington Post'', September 12, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an unclassified final draft of a report by the US Senate committee then investigating campaign finance abuses, half of the $400,000 given to the Democrats by Sioeng and his family was "funded by transfer from overseas accounts," suggesting that the money came from the Chinese government.&lt;ref name = Woodward/&gt;

==Family and personal life==
Mr Ted Sioeng, who is ethnically Indonesian, began his life in an orphanage. He was then brought up (in Indonesia) by an [[Chinese Indonesians|Indonesian Chinese]] couple, which led to his  interests in China.

He is married with five children, including his eldest, daughter [[Jessica Elnitiarta]], who heads the family interests in California and was also involved in the Clinton controversy, having donated $300,000, some of which was alleged to have been Chinese government money.

Mr. Ted Sioeng holds a [[Singapore]] passport but his wife and children are permanent U.S. residents. He is able to speak good English.&lt;ref name = bw1/&gt;

'''The Support Center''' (TSC or formerly known as the North Carolina Minority Support Center) is a [[not-for-profit organization]] and a [[community development financial institution]](CDFI),&lt;ref name="Credit Union Times:More than $28 Million Moves to CDCUs in Latest CDFI Round"&gt;[http://www.cutimes.com/2011/07/19/more-than-28-million-moves-to-cdcus-in-latest-cdfi], Credit Union Times:More than $28 Million Moves to CDCUs in Latest CDFI Round.&lt;/ref&gt; based in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]]. It is a statewide nonprofit that partners with Community Development [[Credit Union]]s (CDCUs) and community-based organizations to provide small business and mortgage lending services to its members; and to provide training, grants, and loans to create economic opportunities for individuals, families, and communities in underserved markets.

==History==
The Support Center was founded in 1990&lt;ref name="Start-A-Biz :Non-Bank Lenders"&gt;[http://startabiz.gaston.edu/start/nonbank_lenders.htm], Start-A-Biz :Non-Bank Lenders.&lt;/ref&gt; by Lenwood V. Long, Sr.&lt;ref name="Carolina Business Connection:The North Carolina Minority Support Cetnter"&gt;[http://www.carolinabusinessconnection.com/cbc/article.html?id=11967], Carolina Business Connection:The North Carolina Minority Support Cetnter.&lt;/ref&gt; and Martin D. Eakes. Later, Saundra Scales of the School Workers Federal Credit Union and Jim Gilliam of St. Luke joined The Support Center.

==Services==
Throughout its history, The Support Center has offered its affiliates the following services: technical assistance, capital support, advocacy, marketing, financial education, capital grants and youth financial education. However, due to consolidation and mergers after the 2008 financial crisis, The Support Center now focuses mainly on Small Business Lending, Policy &amp; Research, Technical Assistance and Capital Support.&lt;ref name="The Support Center:About Us"&gt;[http://thesupportcenter-nc.org/cdcus.html], The Support Center:About Us.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Small business lending programs===
The Support Center offers loans directly as well as through their affiliated credit unions with support from federal and state funding. It focuses on specific loan products that are not easily available through traditional bank services. They are currently offering two programs for small business owners: USDA Intermediary Relending Program (IRP) and NC Small Business Development Loan Program.&lt;ref name="Despite the credit crunch, North Carolina’s community credit unions are eager to lend"&gt;[http://www.americanindependent.com/160993/despite-the-credit-crunch-north-carolinas-community-credit-unions-are-eager-to-lend], The American Independent : Despite the credit crunch, North Carolina’s community credit unions are eager to lend.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Policy and research===
The Support Center helps its affiliates with publishing white papers, impact studies and surveys that address specific issues that relate directly to CDCUs and other community focused financial service groups.

===Technical assistance===
Technical Assistance include its compliance and regulation services along with brokering assistance with marketing, grant writing and other operational needs. It will also include offering assistance in matching USDA housing financing programs with those offered by our affiliates.

===Capital support===
Capital support service will be offering assistance with generating general deposits, secondary capital and lending funds for its affiliates.

==Affiliates==
Currently, The Support Center has six CDCU affiliates with more than 110,000 members at 26 branches across the state of North Carolina:&lt;ref name="The Support Center:About Us"/&gt;

*First Legacy Community Credit Union

[[Malay titles|Datuk]] '''Vinod Balachandra Sekhar''' is the President and Group Chief Executive of Petra Group, a Malaysian company that focuses on [[rubber recycling]], [[biotechnology]] and financial software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leadership Summit Asia 2008|url=http://www.insead.edu/events/leadershipsummitasia2008/speakers/sekhar.cfm|publisher=Insead}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also the chairman of the Sekhar Foundation, based in [[Kuala Lumpur]] and the CEO of Green Rubber. He was named by ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine as Malaysia's 28th richest man for 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Malaysia's Richest No. 28 Vinod Sekhar|url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2009/84/malaysia-09_Vinod-Sekhar_TL7H.html|work=Forbes.com|accessdate=27 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;Nevertheless, there were complaints filed against him, leading to lawsuits.

The title of Dato' was given to Sekhar at the early age of 26 by [[Yang di Pertuan Besar]] of Negeri Sembilan, Tuanku Ja'afar Ibni Almarhum Tuanku Abdul Rahman on his 71st birthday, who was at that time the 10th Yang di Pertuan Agong of Malaysia. He was the youngest person to be conferred a Dato'ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cinderella Man|url=http://themalaysiamovement.com/images/Cinderella_Man.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal and Family Life==
Sekhar is the youngest son of Sukumari Nair and [[B.C. Sekhar]], also known as Mr. Natural Rubber, who for a time provided significant inputs in the global [[natural rubber]] industry. He has three siblings. He is married to Winy Sekhar with whom he has two daughters, Petra and Tara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Malaysian Rubber Industry Pioneer B.C. Sekhar Dies|url=http://news.oneindia.in/2006/09/07/malaysian-rubber-industry-pioneer-b-c-sekhar-dies-1157610620.html|publisher=One India News|accessdate=7 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from managing his businesses, Sekhar takes time to write literary contents. He has written numerous plays and even produced a book of poetry. "In the Mind's Eye", one of the plays that he has written was a success and was well received when it was produced in the United States, United Kingdom and in his homeland, [[Malaysia]]. Dato Vinod paid for it to be produced.

Moreover, he became the host of the first English talk show on television in Malaysia.

He also enjoys playing golf with a 22 handicap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roop|first=Sharma|title=Vinod Sekhar : Malaysia's most prominent businessmen, philanthropists|url=http://www.nriinternet.com/NRIentrepreneurs/ASIA/Malaysia/A_Z/Vinod_Sekhar/Forbes_Malaysia_40richest_2007%20.htm|publisher=NRI Internet|accessdate=30 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career life==
While he attended [[Haileybury and Imperial Service College]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Malaysian work experience offer for six pupils|url=http://haileybury.com/news/archive/Default.asp?id=266&amp;offset=400|publisher=Haileybury and Imperial Service College|accessdate=15 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and writes broadly – for instance&lt;ref&gt;"Malaysia in the Asian Century: The Challenges we all face", in: [[Frank-Jürgen Richter]] and Thang D. Nguyen: ''The Malaysian Journey'', Marshall Cavendish 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; he started a non-partisan multiracial youth organisation, Malaysiana Muda. He remained president of one of the largest multiracial youth organisations in Malaysia at that time for two terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vinod Sekhar|url=http://greenleaderssummit.com/vinod-sekhar|publisher=Green Leaders Summit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sekhar was only 21 when he started his business career with just US$50 when he put up his own clothing company called Vincent Siefer Clothing Company that sold college embossed shirts to university students in different American universities. He later then sold his clothing company for US$5 million.{{cn|date=April 2016}}

In 1990, Sekhar formed Sekhar Tunku Imran (STI) Group together with his friend, Tunku Tan Sri Imran and penetrated various business ventures. Some of the most notable business deals that STI had was when it had a joint venture with [[Disney-MGM Studios]] in Florida, USA to produce the movie entitled Tarzan, The Epic Adventure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roop|first=Sharma|title=Vinod Sekhar : Malaysia's most prominent businessmen, philanthropists|url=http://www.nriinternet.com/NRIentrepreneurs/ASIA/Malaysia/A_Z/Vinod_Sekhar/Forbes_Malaysia_40richest_2007%20.htm|publisher=NRI Internet|accessdate=30 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, STI teamed up with various business partners both in the local and international scene that in 1997, the Petra Group was born.

The Petra Group is a privately held company that is well known for Green Rubber Global – the company's key business which is a cost-effective process that can efficiently recycle used rubber.

Sekhar is also an active supporter of different socio-civic organisations. He founded the Sekhar Foundation which owns 60% of The Petra Group and acts as the philanthropic arm of the company by supporting various charitable organisations worldwide. The Sekhar Foundation has donated to a range of organisations that are working in the fields of education, poverty alleviation, and healthcare provision. The Foundation is also the main sponsor for South East Asia's largest rain forest research programme in the Danum Valley in [[Borneo]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.insead.edu/events/leadershipsummitasia2008/speakers/sekhar.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University Council Members: Dato Vinod Sekhar|url=http://www.limkokwing.net/university_guidance/council/datuk_vinod_sekhar/|publisher=Limkokwing University of Creative Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Green Rubber Global ===

Green Rubber Global (GRG) is a part of Sekhar's Petra Group. A recycling plant is being built near Gallup, New Mexico in USA to pave way to Green Rubber production. Aside from that, GRG is planning to expand and build more recycling plants in US, [[Mexico]] and Asia to increase production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Malaysian rubber recycler expands into USA|url=http://www.recyclinginternational.com/recycling-news/5170/other-news/archiv/malaysian-rubber-recycler-expands-usa|publisher=Recycling International|accessdate=1 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recycling plant will make use of the process that Sekhar's father has developed called De-Link to create "green rubbers". The De-Link process will devulcanise old and used tyres then revulcanise them and convert them into different new rubber products such as vehicle tyres and footwear soles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Matthew|first=Phan|title=Watch 'green rubber' bounce back to life soon|url=http://www.wildsingapore.com/news/20070910/070912-5.htm|publisher=Wild Singapore|accessdate=12 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GRG has famous supporters and shareholders like Hollywood celebrities [[Mel Gibson]] and [[Bruce Willis]] and ''Forbes'' magazine publisher, [[Steve Forbes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mel Gibson-backed firm Green Rubber eyes London IPO|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2007/09/11/rubber-ipo-mel-gibson-idUSL1184655720070911|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=11 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, Bruce Willis then sued the company to recoup US$900,000 (RM3.1mil) of the US$2mil he invested.In his complaint filed in the federal court in Los Angeles, Willis said Petra chief executive officer Datuk Vinod B. Sekhar and Tunku Imran induced him to invest in this company &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bruce Willis sues Petra and Tunku Imran|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2008/11/22/bruce-willis-sues-petra-and-tunku-imran|publisher=The Star Newspaper|accessdate=23 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disputes==
=== Declared bankruptcy in 2005 and Insolvency Dept bid against Vinod Sekhar in 2010 ===

In June 2005, the Kuala Lumpur High Court declared Sekhar a bankrupt due to failure of settling his debts to Orix Credit Malaysia Sdn Bhd and 11 other companies that totals RM 12.376 million.According to the application that the director-general of the Insolvency Department has submitted to KL's High Court, Sekhar committed two offences when he was still in directorship of 25 companies and flew out of the country without gaining permission from the Director-General of Insolvency, under Section 38 of the Bankruptcy Act 1967.However, in March 2011, Sekhar's attorney successfully proved to the court that the adjudication and receiving order documents pertaining to the bankruptcy were never served on his client and that the signatures appearing on those documents were forged. Because of that, the application to put Sekhar to jail was dismissed by High Court Senior Assistant Registrar Rozianti Mohamed Hanaphi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vinod Sekhar won't respond to allegations company|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2010/09/04/vinod-sekhar-wont-respond-to-allegations/|publisher=The Star Newspaper|accessdate=4 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== The filing of Lawsuit by Bruce Willis in 2008 ===

Hollywood actor Bruce Willis filed a lawsuit against Vinod Sekhar and Malaysian Prince Imran Ibni Tuanku Ja'afar last November 2008 when the actor wanted to get his $2 million investment but only received $1.1 million.[18]The actor sued Sekhar and Ja'afar for the remaining $900, 000 of his total investment immediately after learning that the plan to launch green rubber was put on hold because of the weakening global economy. In his complaint filed in the federal court in Los Angeles on 22 November 2008, Willis said Petra chief executive officer Datuk Vinod B. Sekhar and Tunku Imran induced him to invest in a company that was developing a non-toxic and recyclable rubber in 2007, according to a Bloomberg report. Willis was told that former US Vice-President Al Gore and actor Mel Gibson had also invested in the company.

The '''Williamson trade-off model''' is a theoretical model in the [[economics]] of [[industrial organization]] which emphasizes the trade-off associated with [[horizontal merger]]s between gains resulting from lower [[marginal cost|costs of production]] and the losses associated with higher [[price]]s due to greater degree of [[monopoly power]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Beynon, [https://books.google.com/books?id=26m3RXKUuQIC&amp;pg=PA349&amp;lpg=PA349&amp;dq=Williamson+trade+off+model&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2EzE7a9bfw&amp;sig=B1AVpfWqnzC70fm35GJso3iNedQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=TGJNS--gM5X2NYWx2O4M&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Williamson%20trade%20off%20model&amp;f=false "The Routledge critical dictionary of global economics"], Taylor &amp; Francis, 1999, p. 349&lt;/ref&gt;

The model was first presented by [[Oliver Williamson]] in his 1968 paper "Economies as an Antitrust Defense: The welfare tradeoffs" in the ''[[American Economic Review]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, Oliver, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1831653 "Economies as an Antitrust Defense: The welfare tradeoffs"], The ''American Economic Review'', Vol. 58, No. 1 (March 1968), pp. 18–36&lt;/ref&gt; Williamson argued that ignoring efficiencies that may result from proposed mergers in antitrust law "fail[ed] to meet the basic test of economic rationality".&lt;ref&gt;Katalin Judit Cseres, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ov6Vr9ev57MC&amp;pg=PT32&amp;lpg=PT32&amp;dq=Williamson+trade+off+model&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=e3EjP3DuHN&amp;sig=2pKrldsGbpaPlwTodsQoWzSlpjo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mmVNS9ehCJT4NY2wgOoM&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Williamson%20&amp;f=false "Competition law and consumer protection"], Kluwer Law International, 2005, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:WilliamsonTOmodel.JPG|thumb|300px|Graphical illustration of the Williamson trade-off model]]

==Basic idea of the model==

Suppose that a given industry is initially characterized by [[perfect competition]] and has a constant unit cost of production equal to ''c1'' (assumed the same across all firms in the industry). Because of competition, the market price of the good produced will be equal to this unit cost, which means that firms in the industry earn [[normal profit]]s, as captured by the [[producer surplus]] (the area below the market price, but above the supply/unit cost curve).&lt;ref name=AnP/&gt;

Suppose further that after a merger between firms in the industry takes place, unit costs fall to ''c2&lt;c1'' as a result of [[economies of scale]] or other forms of [[synergy]]. However, the industry is now less competitive, with a [[monopoly]] being the most extreme example. Since the firm is no longer a [[price-taking|price taker]], the price it charges will be above the (now lower) unit cost. For a monopoly, for example, the price will be set where the unit/marginal cost intersects [[marginal revenue]]. This means that the amount of [[consumer surplus]], the area below the demand curve and above the price, will be lower.&lt;ref name=AnP/&gt;

The change in overall [[social surplus]] of the market depends on whether the increase in producer surplus due to lower production costs is larger or smaller than the fall in consumer surplus due to higher prices. Note that it is theoretically possible that the fall in unit costs due to the merger could be sufficiently large that the post merger monopoly price ends up being lower than the pre merger competitive price in which case both producer and consumer surplus would increase. In that situation no trade-off exists and the merger is unambiguously beneficial to all market participants. More generally however, a horizontal merger can involve both costs and benefits.&lt;ref name=AnP/&gt;

==Applications in antitrust policy==

One implication of the Williamson model is that the gains from cost reduction do not have to be "large" in order to outweigh the losses that result from higher prices.&lt;ref name=AnP/&gt;
This is because the welfare losses associated with the latter tend to be "second-order" (graphically, they are triangles), while the gains tend to be "first-order" (rectangles). What this means is that the gains from the merger would have to be very small, or alternatively, the demand for the good in question would have to be relatively quite [[Price elasticity of demand|inelastic]] for social surplus to decrease.&lt;ref name=AnP/&gt;

A broader conclusion of the model is that [[Competition law|antitrust]], or competition, policy should be "discretionary".&lt;ref name=CLP&gt;C. L. Pass, Bryan Lowes, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ffoNAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA177&amp;lpg=PA177&amp;dq=Williamson+trade-off+model&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QlHt5pe8fZ&amp;sig=mPH4gLVvdECPF4N0agXsdwZ5sZE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3G9KS63OOoe0tgf1l9nkDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CBUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Williamson%20trade-off%20model&amp;f=false "Business and microeconomics: an introduction to the market economy"], Routledge, 1994, p. 175-178&lt;/ref&gt; That is, government regulators who are faced with a proposed merger need to examine each proposal on a case by case basis. In some instances, the cost savings might make it worth the loss of competition, while in others they will not. This is in contrast to a "non-discretionary" policy where regulators set certain standards that any industry must meet - for example, that no firm has more than 20% market share. Then, they do not actually examine the potential gains or losses to consumer or producer surplus from a proposed merger, but only its impact on meeting the set standard - for example, whether or not the merger will increase a single firm's market share above 20%.&lt;ref name=CLP/&gt;

The model has been applied to the study of mergers in the US rail freight industry and the US food industry, among others.&lt;ref&gt;Ivaldi, Marc
and McCullough, Gerard, [http://www.cepr.org/pubs/new-dps/dplist.asp?dpno=5000 "Welfare Trade-Offs in US Rail Mergers"], Centre for Economic Policy Research&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sanjib Bhuyan, [http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/20469/1/sp01bh01.pdf "Impact of Vertical Mergers on Food Industry Profitability: An Empirical Evaluation"]&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been used in evaluation of actual antitrust laws by American legal scholar and judge [[Robert Bork]].&lt;ref name=Fink&gt;Richard Fink, [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119536139/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 "General and partial equilibruim theory in Bork's antitrust analysis"], paper delivered at the Annual Western Economic Association International Conference, Las Vegas, Nevada, June 24–28, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; A regulatory approach based on the model was popular in the United States in the 1980s and influenced much antitrust legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick A McNutt, "Signalling, Strategy and Management Type" [http://www.patrickmcnutt.com/docs/Chapter%207%20Antitrust%20And%20Public%20Policy.pdf Chapter 7, Antitrust &amp; Public Policy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms and limitations==

#The "trade-off" in the Williamson model involves a gain in producers' (firms') surplus and a loss in consumers' surplus. Thus, in focusing the analysis on total surplus, it neglects distributional issues and treats changes in both consumers' and producers' welfare symmetrically. However, anti-trust policy as actually practiced in many countries ([[Europe]], [[Canada]] and [[United States|US]]) appears to have the goal of maximizing consumer surplus (or this goal is stated explicitly).&lt;ref name=Zulfi&gt;S. Zulfi Sadeque, Competition Bureau, Industry Canada, Government of Canada, [http://www.apeccp.org.tw/doc/Workshop/w1996/doc8.htm "Some Aspects of Competition Policy: the View from Canada"], APEC Workshop on Competition Policy and Deregulation, August 17–18, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; In that sense, as long as the post-merger market price is higher than pre-merger, the fact that producer surplus and firm profits rise is immaterial from the point of view of the regulators. In that case, only those mergers in which the fall in unit cost is sufficiently large to ensure a lower price after the merger should be permitted.&lt;ref name=AnP&gt;Michael Whinston in Mark Armstrong, Robert Porter, eds. [https://books.google.com/books?id=bvrn72h8dDwC&amp;pg=PT449&amp;lpg=PT449&amp;dq=Williamson+trade-off+model&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=suaMKWbVit&amp;sig=7NbiL-LKBviWCutjwAFTGPGD88U&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3G9KS63OOoe0tgf1l9nkDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Williamson%20trade-off%20model&amp;f=false "Handbook of industrial organization, Volume 3"], Elsevier, 2007, p. 2373-2375&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, the Williamson model is not applicable in [[European Community competition law]] and is controversial in Canada.&lt;ref name=Monti&gt;Giorgio Monti, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hHe2PklOqPUC&amp;pg=PT292&amp;lpg=PT292&amp;dq=Williamson+trade+off+model&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hJXOk9GH_P&amp;sig=P5OnAH62CPCxHSLGDN97qysclZY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=FmNNS7e4KInUM-W-9fcM&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CBIQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Williamson%20trade%20off%20model&amp;f=false "EC competition law"], Cambridge University Press, 2007, p. 292&lt;/ref&gt;
#The simplest version of the model compares a situation where initially the market is competitive to a situation where the post-merger market is not. However, if initially price exceeds marginal cost (i.e. the market is not competitive), further increases in price have a "first order" effect on consumer surplus (graphically, they are trapezoids).&lt;ref name=AnP/&gt;
#The model is limited in that it only considers the effect of the merger on price charged by the firm(s). However, in most real life situations, firms compete on many other aspects other than price, for example product quality, capacity, research and development, and product differentiation. These variables are also likely to be affected by a merger and the basic model does not capture these effects. However, the model can and has been extended in these directions by more recent work.&lt;ref name=AnP/&gt;
#The model ignores the possibilities that the same cost reductions and efficiency gains (once technologically feasible) may arise on their own due without any need for a merger,&lt;ref name=Paddy&gt;Paddy McNutt, [https://books.google.com/books?id=qZTdn1JtFV4C&amp;cd=1e "Law, economics and antitrust: towards a new perspective"], Edward Elgar Publishing, 2005, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; for example via own-firm investment.

Kaufmann co-founded two [[venture capital]] firms: Veritas Venture Partners, an Israel-based fund investing in early-stage tech startups,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; and Sadara Ventures, the first venture capital fund to target Palestinian tech companies.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He also founded two [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit organizations]]: Tmura, an Israeli fund that connects the high-tech community to philanthropy in Israel,&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.geektime.com/2014/01/09/tmura-a-model-angel-for-vcs-and-angels/|title=Tmura: A model angel for VC's and Angels|date=2014-01-09|work=Geektime|access-date=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/1.4893964|title=Ex-New Yorker's Philanthropic VC Does Good by Doing Well|date=2006-03-03|work=Haaretz|access-date=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Palestinian Internship Program, which arranges work opportunities for young Palestinian professionals at Israel-based tech and finance companies.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2014/10/20/entrepreneurship-the-way-to-peace-in-the-middle-east/#78ce39ce18b2|title=Entrepreneurship - The Way To Peace In The Middle East|last=Rudee|first=Eliana|date=20 October 2014|work=Forbes|access-date=3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.inc.com/jill-krasny/palestinian-internship-program-israel.html|title=The Program Pairing Israeli Startups With Palestinian Talent|date=2014-09-02|work=Inc.com|access-date=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

In 2011, Israeli financial magazine, [[TheMarker|The Marker]], named Kaufmann to its list of the 100 most influential people in the Israeli economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cvent.com/events/gcv-israel-2018/speakers-271c5f5ae7a14fd799cc9105b3f436ba.aspx|title=GCV Israel 2018|website=Cvent|access-date=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In 2017, ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine named Kaufmann one of its “[[FP Top 100 Global Thinkers|Global Thinkers]]”, a list of "the world's pre-eminent thought leaders and public intellectuals."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gt.foreignpolicy.com/2017|title=FP's 2017 Global Thinkers|website=FP's 2017 Global Thinkers|access-date=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Venture capital career ==

=== Venture Capital in Israel ===
In 1987, Kaufmann joined Athena Venture Partners, Israel’s first venture capital fund, just as the “Start-Up Nation” was beginning to develop.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://today.law.harvard.edu/nothing-ventured-nothing-gained/|title=Nothing Ventured, Nothing Gained - Harvard Law Today|work=Harvard Law Today|access-date=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://paw.princeton.edu/video/yadin-kaufmann-80-building-high-tech-bridges|title=Yadin Kaufmann '80: Building High-Tech Bridges|date=2016-01-21|work=Princeton Alumni Weekly|access-date=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, Kaufmann co-founded, with Gideon Tolkowsky, Veritas Venture Partners, an early-stage investor in Israeli technology-based companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://finder.startupnationcentral.org/investor_page/veritas-venture-partners|title=Start-Up Nation Finder - Israeli innovation network|website=Start-Up Nation Finder|access-date=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Athena and Veritas led seed-stage (and subsequent) financing rounds in numerous Israeli companies, including [[Mercury Interactive|Mercury Interactive Corp.]] (Nasdaq: MERQ, later acquired by [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]]); [[Electronics for Imaging]] (Nasdaq: EFII), [[Gilat Satellite Networks]] (Nasdaq: GILT), [[List of acquisitions by Cisco Systems|Class Data Systems]] (acquired by [[Cisco Systems|Cisco]]), [[M-Systems]] (Nasdaq: MSYS, later acquired by [[SanDisk]]), [[Coherent, Inc.|ESC Medical Systems]] (Nasdaq: ESCMF, later acquired by Lumenis), and others.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Venture Capital in the Palestinian Territories ===
Kaufmann has launched several initiatives aimed at helping to develop a "technology ecosystem" in the [[Palestinian territories|Palestinian Territories]]. He has asserted that his intentions for investing in the Palestinian Territories are to improve [[Economy of the State of Palestine|Palestinian economy]] and to increase the chances of [[Israeli–Palestinian peace process|peace between Israelis and Palestinians]].&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

In 2008, Kaufmann partnered with Palestinian tech entrepreneur Saed Nashef and began building the first-ever venture capital fund to target Palestinian tech startups.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.foxbusiness.com/features/obama-praises-palestinian-startup-scene|title=Obama Praises Palestinian Startup Scene|last=Karol|first=Gabrielle|date=2016-03-22|work=Fox Business|access-date=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Despite the backdrop of a [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|global financial crisis]] and [[List of violent incidents in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, 2008|recurring political hostilities in the region]], Kaufmann and Nashef raised a $30 million fund from investors including the [[Soros Fund Management|Soros Economic Development Fund]], [[AOL]] founder [[Steve Case|Steve Case’s]] [[Case Foundation]], former [[eBay]] President [[Jeffrey Skoll|Jeff Skoll’s]] [[Skoll Foundation]], [[Google.org|Google Foundation]], [[Cisco Systems|Cisco]] and the [[European Investment Bank]].&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-palestinians-investment-sadara/in-west-bank-a-venture-capital-fund-hunts-palestinian-tech-returns-idUSKBN1721MQ|title=In West Bank, a venture capital fund hunts Palestinian tech returns|last=Baker|first=Luke|date=31 March 2017|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/google-cisco-back-palestinian-vc-fund-2011-04-06|title=Google, Cisco back Palestinian VC fund|last=Daniel|first=Robert|date=6 April 2011|work=MarketWatch|access-date=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eib.org/en/infocentre/press/releases/all/2009/2009-269-european-investment-bank-supports-middle-east-venture-capital-fund-first-venture-capital-fund-in-palestinian-territories.htm|title=EIB supports first venture capital fund in Palestinian territories|website=www.eib.org|access-date=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaufmann|first=Yadin|date=|title=Start-Up Palestine: How to Spark a West Bank Tech Boom|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/israel/2017-06-13/start-palestine|journal=Foreign Affairs|volume=July/August 2017 Issue|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kerryadolan/2012/12/18/billionaire-backed-palestinian-vc-fund-sadara-invests-in-mobile-job-matching-firm-souktel/#60ac00e116f5|title=Billionaire-backed Palestinian VC Fund Sadara Invests In Mobile Job-Matching Firm Souktel|last=Dolan|first=Kerry A.|date=18 December 2012|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sadara Ventures was formally launched in 2011 in Ramallah at an event including the then-[[Prime Minister of the Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Prime Minister]] [[Salam Fayyad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.portlandtrust.org/sites/default/files/peb/issue55_apr_2011.pdf|title=Palestinian Economic Bulletin, Issue 55 (April 2011)|last=|first=|date=|website=The Portland Trust|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iJtRjfUgd8&amp;feature=youtu.be|title=Excerpt of Prime Minister Fayyad speech at Sadara Ventures Launch|last=|first=|date=9 Apr 2011|website=YouTube|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since making Palestine’s first-ever VC investment in [[Yamsafer]], an online accommodation booking platform, in 2012,&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Sadara has invested in a total of six [[Startup company|startups]] in the Palestinian Territories.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

US President [[Barack Obama]] referred to Kaufmann’s partnership with Saed Nashef in his [[List of international presidential trips made by Barack Obama|March 2013]] speech in [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9Tak9w60Os|title=Obama makes a reference to Sadara Ventures in Jerusalem speech|last=|first=|date=21 March 2013|website=YouTube|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-profit activity ==

=== Tmura - The Israeli Public Service Venture Fund ===
In 2002, Kaufmann founded “Tmura - The Israeli Public Service Venture Fund.”&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Tmura receives donations of equity from Israeli and Israel-related high-tech companies and, upon a [[liquidity event]] such as an [[Takeover|acquisition]] or [[initial public offering]], allocates the proceeds to education- and youth-related charities in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1000755277|title=Tmura offers start ups a philanthropic option - Globes|website=Globes|language=he|access-date=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tmura has received options donations from more than 500 companies and has raised over $16.5 million for the causes that it supports.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;[http://tmura.org]

=== The Palestinian Internship Program ===
In 2014, Kaufmann founded the Palestinian Internship Program (PIP)[http://palinternship.com], a US-registered non-profit that arranges work experiences and other professional development activities for highly talented Palestinian graduates from the [[West Bank]] and [[East Jerusalem]] in the Israeli high-tech sector.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

As of early 2018, PIP has enabled 40 young Palestinian professionals to work at 25 Israel-based companies including [[Intel]], [[HP Indigo Division|HP Indigo]] and [[Thomson Reuters]], as well as a number of startups and VC funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://files.acrobat.com/a/preview/4005c2ab-7f26-4825-9d28-1a82f9ca5122|title=Palestinian Internship Program 2018 Impact Report|last=|first=|date=|website=Accessed via Palestinian Internship Program webite (www.palinternship.com)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Breaking the Impasse ===
Kaufmann is a member of [[Breaking the Impasse]] (BTI), a [[World Economic Forum]] (WEF)-backed [[advocacy group]] of Palestinian and Israeli businesspeople (founded by Palestinian businessman [[Munib al-Masri]] and Israeli high-tech entrepreneur [[Yossi Vardi]]) lobbying political leaders to advance the [[Israeli–Palestinian peace process|Israeli-Palestinian peace process]].&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/.premium-israeli-palestinian-execs-call-for-2-states-1.5270032|title=Israeli, Palestinian Business Leaders Call for Two-state Solution|last=Avriel|first=Eytan|date=2013-05-27|work=Haaretz|access-date=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-a-peace-agreement-can-solve-our-economic-woes-1000911966|title=A peace agreement can solve our economic woes|last=Ben-Israel|first=Adi|date=23 January 2014|website=Globes|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaufmann has spoken on behalf of BTI at high-profile WEF-sponsored events including at the group's launch event at the [[Dead Sea]], [[Jordan]] in 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgQ_89sjNb0&amp;feature=youtu.be|title=Jordan 2013 - Press Conference Breaking the Impasse|last=|first=|date=26 May 2013|website=YouTube|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; and at [[Davos]], [[Switzerland]] in 2014.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;
