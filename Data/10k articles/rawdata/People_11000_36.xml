{{eastern name order|Gáspár András}}

'''András Gáspár''' (23 November 1804 – 5 August 1884) was a Hungarian general who fought in the Hungarian War of Independence of 1848–1849.

He was born in a poor bourgeois family. His father was a bootmaker. He finished grammar school in his home town. From 1821 he is ranker, in 1847 is chief captain in the IXth Hussar regiment.

From September 1848 he participated in the fights against [[Josip Jelačić]]. From 8 (16) October he was major, division commander in the regiments which joined the Hungarian side. From 26 November 1848 he was the commander of the IX. Hussar Regiment. From 5 January 1849 he was brigadier, from 18 February commander of a division in the Army of the Northern Danube led by [[Artúr Görgei]]. For his victory in the [[Battle of Hatvan]], he received the title of general and the III. Class Hungarian Military Decoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bóna|1987|pp=157}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His decision to not to attack with his army corps the Austrians in the [[Battle of Isaszeg (1849)|Battle of Isaszeg]], was considered a big mistake, which could been bring the destruction of the united Habsburg forces in Hungary under the lead of Marshall [[Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Grätz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hermann|2004|pp=226–228}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He took an important role in the victory in the [[Battle of Nagysalló]]. But being against the [[Hungarian Declaration of Independence]] of 14 April 1849, he asked to go in permission, and never came back in the Hungarian army.

After Hungary's [[Surrender at Világos]] in front of the Russian troops, and the end of the Hungarian War of Independence, he was sentenced to 10 years in prison by the Austrian authorities, but in 1850 he was pardoned. He became postmaster in Bihar. Between 1868–1875 he was a parliamentarian in the [[National Assembly (Hungary)|House of Representatives]], than was elected as president of the Central Honvéd Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bóna|1987|pp=157}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Annie Oakley''' (born '''Phoebe Ann Mosey'''; August 13, 1860 – November 3, 1926) was an American [[marksman|sharpshooter]] and [[exhibition shooting|exhibition shooter]]. Her amazing talent&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IK9J3H0S10wC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=%22amazing+talent%22+%22sitting+bull%22 |title=Wild West Women (book)|page=55|last=Krohn|first=Katherine E. |publisher=Lerner Publications|year=2005|isbn=9780822526469}} "Sitting Bull was deeply moved by Annie's talent.

Butler]], whom she later married. The couple joined ''[[Buffalo Bill|Buffalo Bill's Wild West]]'' show a few years later. Oakley became a renowned international star, performing before royalty and heads of state.

Oakley also was variously known as "Miss Annie Oakley", "Little Sure Shot", "Little Miss Sure Shot", "Watanya Cicilla", "Phoebe Anne Oakley", "Mrs. Annie Oakley", "Mrs. Annie Butler", and "Mrs. Frank Butler". Her [[death certificate]] gives her name as "Annie Oakley Butler".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Person Details for Annie Oakley Butler|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:X8K9-G86|website=FamilySearch.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a stone-mounted plaque in the vicinity of the site, which was placed by the Annie Oakley Committee in 1981, 121 years after her birth.

Annie's parents were [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]]s of English descent from [[Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania|Hollidaysburg]], [[Blair County, Pennsylvania]]: Susan Wise, age 18,&lt;ref name="Wukovits"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wukovits|first=John|date=May 1997|title=Annie Oakley|series=Legends of the West|publisher=[[Chelsea House]]|isbn=978-0791039069}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wills"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wills|first=Chuck|title=Annie Oakley|year=2007|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|location=London|isbn=978-0-7566-2997-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jacob Mosey, born 1799, age 49, married in 1848. They moved to a rented farm (later purchased with a mortgage) in [[Patterson Township, Darke County, Ohio]], sometime around 1855.

Born in 1860, Annie was the sixth of Jacob and Susan's nine children, and the fifth of the seven surviving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/timeline/oakley/|title=Timeline: The Life of Annie Oakley|accessdate=June 15, 2015|quote=August 13, 1860: Annie Oakley is born Phoebe Ann Moses, on the family farm in Darke County, Ohio, fifth ...|work=[[American Experience]]|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502042159/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/timeline/oakley/|archivedate=May 2, 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her siblings were Mary Jane (1851–1867), Lydia (1852–1882), Elizabeth (1855–1881), Sarah Ellen (1857–1939), Catherine (1859–1859), John (1861–1949), Hulda (1864–1934) and a stillborn infant brother in 1865. Annie's father, who had fought in the [[War of 1812]], became an invalid from [[hypothermia]] during a blizzard in late 1865 and died of [[pneumonia]] in early 1866 at age 66.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Riley|first=Glenda|title=The Life and Legacy of Annie Oakley |publisher = [[University of Oklahoma Press]]|year=1994|page=5|isbn=9780806126562}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother later married Daniel Brumbaugh, had one more child, Emily (1868–1937), and was widowed for a second time.

Because of poverty following the death of her father, Annie did not regularly attend school as a child, although she did attend later in childhood and in adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kasper|first=Shirl|title=Annie Oakley|year=1992|publisher=[[University of Oklahoma Press]]|isbn=978-0-8061-2418-6|pages=6, 20}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 15, 1870, at age nine, she was admitted to the Darke County Infirmary along with her sister Sarah Ellen. According to her autobiography, she was put in the care of the infirmary's superintendent, Samuel Crawford Edington, and his wife Nancy, who taught her to sew and decorate. Beginning in the spring of 1870, she was "bound out" to a local family to help care for their infant son, on the false promise of fifty cents a week and an education. The couple had originally wanted someone who could pump water, cook, and who was bigger. She spent about two years in near slavery to them, enduring mental and physical abuse. One time, the wife put Annie out in the freezing cold without shoes, as a punishment because she had fallen asleep over some darning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Freifeld, Riva (director and producer)|year=2006|title=The American Experience: Annie Oakley|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/cast-crew/oakley-credits/|publisher=WGBH|location=Boston, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Annie referred to them as "the wolves". Even in her autobiography, she never revealed the couple's real names.&lt;ref&gt;Whiting, Jim. What's so great about Annie Oakley. Mitchell Lane Publishers. Delaware, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to biographer Glenda Riley, "the wolves" could have been the Studabaker family,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Riley|first=Glenda|title=The Life and Legacy of Annie Oakley|publisher=[[University of Oklahoma Press]]|year=1994|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the 1870 U.S. Census suggests they were the Abram Boose family of neighboring [[Preble County, Ohio|Preble County]].&lt;ref name=cen1870en&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.family-forest.net/photos/AnnieMoseyCensus1870Enlarged.jpg|title=AnnieMoseyCensus1870Enlarged|editor=Billene Statler Nicol|format=JPG|year=2010|accessdate=August 9, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811025310/http://www.family-forest.net/photos/AnnieMoseyCensus1870Enlarged.jpg|archivedate=August 11, 2014|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fscen1870&gt;{{cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.3.1/TH-266-11929-69872-17?cc=1438024|title=TH-266-11929-69872-17|publisher=[[FamilySearch]]|year=1870|work=U.S. Census, Harrison Township, Preble County, Ohio|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the spring of 1872, Annie ran away from "the wolves". According to biographer Shirl Kasper, it was only at this point that Annie met and lived with the Edingtons, returning to her mother's home around the age of 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kasper|first=Shirl|title=Annie Oakley|publisher=[[University of Oklahoma Press]]|year=1992|isbn=0-8061-2418-0|pages=6, 7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g1CqL48DUo0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=annie+oakley+shirl+kasper}}&lt;/ref&gt; Annie's mother married a third time, to Joseph Shaw, on October 25, 1874.{{citation needed|date=October 2014|reason=Needs cite for date of mother's marriage to Shaw}}

Annie began trapping before the age of seven, and shooting and hunting by age eight, to support her siblings and her widowed mother. She sold the hunted game to locals in [[Greenville, Ohio|Greenville]], such as shopkeepers Charles and G. Anthony Katzenberger, who shipped it to hotels in Cincinnati and other cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Riley | first = Glenda | title = The Life and Legacy of Annie Oakley | publisher = [[University of Oklahoma Press]] | date = 1994 | page = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also sold the game to restaurants and hotels in northern Ohio. Her skill paid off the mortgage on her mother's farm when Annie was 15.&lt;ref name=Dorchester&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dorchesterlibrary.org/library/aoakley.html |title=Annie Oakley |publisher=Dorchester County Public Library, Cambridge, MD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debut and marriage==
[[File:The Amateur Circus at Nutley by Peter Newall 1894.jpg|thumb|''The Amateur Circus at Nutley'' (1894) by American illustrator Peter Newell. The scene depicted in the center is of Annie Oakley, standing on horseback, demonstrating her shooting ability.]]

Annie soon became well known throughout the region. On Thanksgiving Day 1875,&lt;ref name=PBS&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!--none given--&gt;|title=Biography: Frank Butler|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/oakley-butler/|work=pbs.org|accessdate=April 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Baughman &amp; Butler shooting act was being performed in [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]]. Traveling show marksman and former dog trainer [[Frank E. Butler]] (1847–1926), an Irish immigrant, placed a $100 bet per side ({{Inflation|US|100|1875|fmt=eq}}) with Cincinnati hotel owner Jack Frost that Butler could beat any local fancy shooter.&lt;ref name="CL"&gt;[http://longford.rootsireland.ie/ Longford Genealogy], Retrieved October 8, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The hotelier arranged a shooting match between Butler and the 15-year-old Annie, saying, "The last opponent Butler expected was a five-foot-tall 15-year-old girl named Annie."&lt;ref name=PBS/&gt; After missing on his 25th shot, Butler lost the match and the bet. Another account says that Butler hit on his last shot, but the bird fell dead about two feet beyond the boundary line.&lt;ref name="CE"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/history/2014/07/20/did-annie-oakley-shooting-contest-happen-in-cincinnati/12913819/|title= Did Annie Oakley shooting contest happen in Cincinnati?|author=Suess, Jeff|newspaper=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]|date=July 20, 2014|accessdate=April 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He soon began courting Annie and they married. They did not have children.&lt;ref name=PBS/&gt;

According to a modern-day account in ''[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]'', it is possible that the shooting match may have taken place in 1881 and not 1875.&lt;ref name="CE"/&gt; It appears the time of the event was never recorded. Biographer Shirl Kasper states the shooting match took place in the spring of 1881 near Greenville, possibly in North Star as mentioned by Butler during interviews in 1903 and 1924. Other sources seem to coincide with the [[North Fairmount, Cincinnati|North Fairmount]] location near Cincinnati if the event occurred in 1881.&lt;ref name="CE"/&gt; The Annie Oakley Center Foundation mentions Oakley visiting her married sister Lydia Stein at her home near Cincinnati in 1875.&lt;ref name="AOF"&gt;[http://www.annieoakleycenterfoundation.com/faq.html Annie Oakley Center Foundation], Retrieved October 2, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; That information is incorrect as Lydia didn't marry Joseph C. Stein until March 19, 1877.&lt;ref name="FS"&gt;[https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/XDF7-123 FamilySearch], Retrieved October 2, 2014. {{Dead link|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although speculation, it is most likely that Oakley and her mother visited Lydia in 1881 as she was seriously ill from [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref name="GENI"&gt;[https://www.geni.com/people/Lydia-Stein/6000000020692137376 Geni], Retrieved April 24, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bevis House hotel was still being operated by Martin Bevis and W. H. Ridenour in 1875. It opened around 1860 after the building was previously used as a pork packaging facility. Jack Frost didn't obtain management of the hotel until 1879.&lt;ref name="CE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CINCY"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dW-52BWC4LoC&amp;pg=PA209&amp;lpg=PA209|publisher=State of Ohio Works Progress Administration|title=Cincinnati: A Guide to the Queen City and its Neighbors|date=May 1943|page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Baughman &amp; Butler shooting act first appeared on the pages of ''The Cincinnati Enquirer'' in 1880.

Regardless of the actual date of the shooting match, Oakley and Butler were married a year afterward.

A possible reason for the contradictory dates is that Butler's divorce from his first wife, Henrietta Saunders, was not yet final in 1876. An 1880 U.S. Federal Census record shows Saunders as married.&lt;ref name="ANC1880"&gt;[http://search.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?rank=1&amp;new=1&amp;MSAV=0&amp;gss=angs-g&amp;gsfn=henrietta&amp;gsln=butler&amp;mswpn__ftp=Camden%2c+Camden%2c+New+Jersey%2c+USA&amp;mswpn=7420&amp;mswpn_PInfo=8-|0|1652393|0|2|3244|33|0|468|7420|0|&amp;msbdy=1854&amp;uidh=9rd&amp;pcat=ROOT_CATEGORY&amp;h=49520049&amp;db=1880usfedcen&amp;indiv=1&amp;ml_rpos=1 Ancestry.com, 1880 U.S. Federal Census], Retrieved October 7, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Sources mentioning Butler's first wife as Elizabeth are inaccurate; Elizabeth was his granddaughter, her father being Edward F.

They joined ''[[Buffalo Bill's Wild West]]'' in 1885. At five feet tall, Oakley was given the nickname of "Watanya Cicilla" by fellow performer [[Sitting Bull]], rendered "Little Sure Shot" in the public advertisements.

During her first engagement with the Buffalo Bill show, Oakley experienced a tense professional rivalry with rifle sharpshooter [[Lillian Smith (entertainer)|Lillian Smith]]. Smith was eleven years younger than Oakley, age 15 at the time she joined the show in 1886, which may have been a primary reason for Oakley to alter her actual age in later years due to Smith's press coverage becoming as favorable as hers.&lt;ref name="LSTOT"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.historynet.com/lillian-smith-the-on-target-california-girl.htm|title=Lillian Smith: The On-Target 'California Girl'|magazine=Wild West|author=Bricklin, Julia|date=November 25, 2014|accessdate=April 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oakley temporarily left the Buffalo Bill show but returned two years later, after Smith departed, in time for the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|Paris Exposition of 1889]].&lt;ref name="AmExAOBio"/&gt; This three-year tour only cemented Oakley as America's first female star. She earned more than any other performer in the show, except for [[Buffalo Bill|"Buffalo Bill" Cody]] himself. She also performed in many shows on the side for extra income.&lt;ref name="AmExAOBio"/&gt;

In Europe, she performed for [[Queen Victoria]] of the United Kingdom, [[King Umberto I]] of Italy, President [[Marie François Sadi Carnot]] of France and other crowned heads of state. Oakley supposedly shot the ashes off a cigarette held by the newly crowned German [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] at his request.&lt;ref name=Kaiser&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ormiston.com/annieoakley/tales.html#KAISER |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021015053658/http://www.ormiston.com/annieoakley/tales.html#KAISER|archivedate=October 15, 2002 |title=Tall Tales and the Truth: Did she shoot the Kaiser's cigarette?|publisher=Annie Oakley Foundation at web.archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Miss-Annie-Oakley-peerless-wing-shot.jpg|thumb|upright|''Wild West Show'' poster]]

From 1892 to 1904, Oakley and Butler made their home in [[Nutley, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Beglin, Julie|title=In Nutley, Mementos of a Very Straight Shooter|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/23/nyregion/in-nutley-mementos-of-a-very-straight-shooter.html|accessdate=April 24, 2018|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 23, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oakley promoted the service of women in combat operations for the [[United States armed forces]]. She wrote a letter to President [[William McKinley]] on April 5, 1898, "offering the government the services of a company of 50 'lady sharpshooters' who would provide their own arms and ammunition should the U.S. go to war with Spain."&lt;ref name="archives.gov"&gt;The [[National Archives and Records Administration]] (NARA). [https://www.archives.gov/research/recover/example-02.html Letter to President William McKinley from Annie Oakley]. Retrieved January 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Spanish–American War]] did occur, but Oakley's offer was not accepted. [[Theodore Roosevelt]], did, however, name his volunteer cavalry the "[[Rough Riders]]" after the "Buffalo Bill's Wild West and Congress of Rough Riders of the World" where Oakley was a major star.

The same year that McKinley was fatally shot by an assassin, 1901, Oakley was also badly injured in a train accident, but recovered after temporary paralysis and five spinal operations. She left the Buffalo Bill show and in 1902 began a less taxing acting career in a stage play written especially for her, ''The Western Girl''. Oakley played the role of Nancy Berry who used a pistol, a rifle and rope to outsmart a group of outlaws.&lt;ref name="Wukovits"/&gt;

Throughout her career, it is believed that Oakley taught more than 15,000 women how to use a gun. Oakley believed strongly that it was crucial for women to learn how to use a gun, as not only a form of physical and mental exercise, but also to defend themselves.&lt;ref name="Wills"/&gt; She said: "I would like to see every woman know how to handle guns as naturally as they know how to handle babies."

Buffalo Bill was friends with [[Thomas Edison]], and Edison built the world's largest electrical power plant at the time for the ''Wild West Show''.&lt;ref name=dorchester /&gt; Buffalo Bill and 15 of his show Indians appeared in two Kinetoscopes filmed September 24, 1894.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mbrsmi/edmp.4025 |title=Buffalo dance / Thomas A.

==Shooting prowess==
[[File:Annie Oakley shooting over her shoulder using a hand mirror..jpg|thumb|left|Annie Oakley shooting over her shoulder using a hand mirror.|382x382px]]

Biographers, such as Shirl Kasper, repeat Oakley's own story about her very first shot at the age of eight. "I saw a squirrel run down over the grass in front of the house, through the orchard and stop on a fence to get a hickory nut." Taking a rifle from the house, she fired at the squirrel, writing later that, "It was a wonderful shot, going right through the head from side to side".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kasper|first=Shirl|title=Annie Oakley|publisher=[[University of Oklahoma Press]]|year=1992|isbn=0-8061-2418-0|page=4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=g1CqL48DUo0C&amp;pg=PA3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' notes that:&lt;blockquote&gt;Oakley never failed to delight her audiences, and her feats of marksmanship were truly incredible. At 30 paces she could split a playing card held edge-on, she hit dimes tossed into the air, she shot cigarettes from her husband's lips, and, a playing card being thrown into the air, she riddled it before it touched the ground.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', article on Annie Oakley.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

R. A. Koestler-Grack reports that, on March 19, 1884, she was being watched by [[Chief Sitting Bull]] when:&lt;blockquote&gt;Oakley playfully skipped on stage, lifted her rifle, and aimed the barrel at a burning candle. In one shot, she snuffed out the flame with a whizzing bullet. Sitting Bull watched her knock corks off of bottles and slice through a cigar Butler held in his teeth.&lt;ref&gt;Koestler-Grack, RA., ''Annie Oakley'', Facts On File, Incorporated, Infobase Publishing, 2010, pp. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Libel cases ==
In 1904, sensational [[cocaine]] prohibition stories were selling well. Newspaper magnate [[William Randolph Hearst]] published a false story that Oakley had been arrested for stealing to support a cocaine habit. The woman actually arrested was a [[American burlesque|burlesque]] performer who told Chicago police that her name was Annie Oakley.

Most of the newspapers that printed the story had relied on the Hearst article, and they immediately retracted it with apologies upon learning of the libelous error. Hearst, however, tried to avoid paying the anticipated court judgments of $20,000 (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|20000|1904|fmt=c}} in 2017) by sending an investigator to Darke County, Ohio with the intent of collecting reputation-smearing gossip from Oakley's past. The investigator found nothing.&lt;ref name=pbs /&gt;

Oakley spent much of the next six years winning 54 of 55 [[libel]] lawsuits against newspapers. She collected less in judgments than the total of her legal expenses.&lt;ref name=pbs&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/oakley/peopleevents/p_oakley.html |title=Annie Oakley (1860-1926) |publisher=pbs.org |date=February 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later years and death ==
[[File:Annie Oakley NYWTS.jpg|thumb|left|Oakley in 1922|267x267px]]

In 1912, the Butlers built a brick [[ranch-style house]] in [[Cambridge, Maryland]]. It is known as the [[Annie Oakley House]] and was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1996. In 1917, they moved to [[North Carolina]] and returned to public life.

She continued to set records into her sixties, and also engaged in extensive philanthropy for women's rights and other causes, including the support of young women she knew. She embarked on a comeback and intended to star in a feature-length silent movie. She hit 100 clay targets in a row from {{convert|16|yd}} at age 62 in a 1922 shooting contest in [[Pinehurst, North Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lkwdpl.org/wihohio/oakl-ann.htm |title=Annie Oakley |publisher=lkwdpl.org Women in History |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120713141105/http://lkwdpl.org/wihohio/oakl-ann.htm |archivedate=July 13, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1922, the couple were in a car accident that forced her to wear a steel brace on her right leg. She eventually performed again after more than a year of recovery, and she set records in 1924.&lt;ref name=dorchester&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dorchesterlibrary.org/library/aoakley.html |title=Annie Oakley |publisher=dorchesterlibrary.org Dorchester County Public Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During her lifetime, the theatre business began referring to complimentary tickets as "Annie Oakleys". Such tickets traditionally have holes punched into them (to prevent them from being resold), reminiscent of the playing cards Oakley shot through during her sharpshooting act.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==Influence==
Oakley's worldwide stardom as a sharpshooter enabled her to earn more money than most of the other performers in the Buffalo Bill show.&lt;ref name="AmExAOBio"/&gt; She did not forget her roots after gaining financial and economic power. She and Butler together often donated to charitable organizations for orphans.&lt;ref name="AmExAOBio"/&gt; Beyond her monetary influence, she proved to be a great influence on women.

Oakley urged that women serve in war, though President McKinley rejected her offer of woman sharpshooters for service in the [[Spanish–American War]].&lt;ref name="archives.gov"/&gt; Beyond this offer to the president, Oakley believed that women should learn to use a gun for the empowering image that it gave.&lt;ref name="bestshot"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Isenberg|first=Nancy|date=February 2008|title=Review: ''Her Best Shot: Women and Guns in America'' by Laura Browder|journal=The Journal of Southern History|publisher=[[Southern Historical Association]]|volume=74|issue=1|pages=175–176|jstor=27650088}}&lt;!--|access-date=December 2, 2014 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Laura Browder discusses how Oakley's stardom gave hope to women and youth in ''Her Best Shot: Women and Guns In America''. Oakley pressed for women to be independent and educated.&lt;ref name=bestshot/&gt; She was a key influence in the creation of the image of the American cowgirl. Through this image, she provided substantial evidence that women are as capable as men when offered the opportunity to prove themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=June 1998|title=Doctoral Dissertations in American Studies, 1996–1997|journal=[[American Quarterly]]|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|volume=50|issue=2|pages=447–469|doi=10.1353/aq.1998.0019|jstor=30041628}}&lt;!--|access-date=December 2, 2014 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Anton's Finnish father and Russian Estonian mother met in [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]] in 1994 and married in 1997. The pair filed for legal divorce in 2002, which came into effect on 13 January 2003, but they continued to live together until 2005. Anton was born out of wedlock on 3 October 2003.&lt;ref name="Interfax" /&gt;&lt;ref name="alueviesti"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Paavo Salosen taistelu kestänyt jo vuoden | author = | url = http://www.alueviesti.fi/alueviesti_ajankohtaiset.php?tiedote_id=531 | journal = Alueviesti | date = | accessdate = 2009-05-16 | language = Finnish}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At birth Anton was legally entitled to Russian citizenship, but the citizenship was never registered.&lt;ref name="Interfax" /&gt; He was registered as a Finnish citizen after the Finnish father's paternity had been established. His mother gained Finnish citizenship via naturalisation after the birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Rimma Salosen vastine Paavo Salosen hyökkäyksiin |url=http://www.suomi.ru/forum/showthread.php?t=49295&amp;page=25&amp;pp=30 |date=6 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616012623/http://www.suomi.ru/forum/showthread.php?t=49295 |archivedate=2008-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the divorce the parents had [[joint custody]].

From a previous marriage of his mother, Anton has an older, 19-year-old brother, whom she left in Finland.&lt;ref name="rian-en-1"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Russia lashes out at Finland over kidnapping |url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20090803/155713900.html |publisher=[[RIA Novosti]] |date=8 August 2009 |accessdate=2009-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abduction by mother to Russia ===
Anton's mother left Finland with Anton without the consent of the father on 5 March 2008.&lt;ref name="Interfax" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Missä on Anton? | author = Timo Myllyniemi | url = http://www.iltasanomat.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/uutinen.asp?id=1514179 | journal = [[Ilta Sanomat]] | date = 4 April 2008 | accessdate = 2009-05-17 | language = Finnish| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090519212621/http://www.iltasanomat.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/uutinen.asp?id=1514179| archivedate= 19 May 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Embassy of Russia in Helsinki|Russian Embassy in Finland]] assisted the mother with the Russian [[Visa (document)|visa]] application.&lt;ref name="us2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Anton-pojan draamasta löytyi outoja yksityiskohtia |url=http://www.uusisuomi.fi/kotimaa/60355-anton-pojan-draamasta-loytyi-outoja-yksityiskohtia |journal=[[Uusi Suomi]] |date=17 May 2009 |accessdate=2009-05-20 |language=Finnish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716132432/http://www.uusisuomi.fi/kotimaa/60355-anton-pojan-draamasta-loytyi-outoja-yksityiskohtia |archivedate=2011-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The signature of the father is presumed to have been forged on the application.&lt;ref name="us3"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Jarmo Koponen: Anton Salonen | url = http://www.uusisuomi.fi/nakokulmat/jarmokoponen/anton-salonen | journal = [[Uusi Suomi]] | date = 17 May 2009 | accessdate = 2009-05-23 | language = Finnish | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090519221416/http://www.uusisuomi.fi/nakokulmat/jarmokoponen/anton-salonen | archivedate = 19 May 2009 | deadurl = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 65-year-old father blames a religious organization near the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] in Finland for the abduction,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Kaapatun pojan isä uskoo jälkien johtavan Vammalan Stormiin |author=Maija Latva |url=http://jps-dev.net/alueviesti/pdf_files/200804081035020.2.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819034313/http://jps-dev.net/alueviesti/pdf_files/200804081035020.2.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=19 August 2011 |journal=Alueviesti |date=9 April 2008 |accessdate=2009-05-16 |pages=5–6 |language=Finnish }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Pikku-Anton pääsee kotiin Suomeen |url=http://www.satakunnankansa.fi/cs/Satellite?c=AMArticle_C&amp;childpagename=SKA_newssite%2FAMLayout&amp;cid=1194608106873&amp;p=1192553427666&amp;pagename=SKAWrapper |author=Tapio Pessi |journal=Satakunnan Kansa |date=20 November 2008 |accessdate=2009-05-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717003940/http://www.satakunnankansa.fi/cs/Satellite?c=AMArticle_C&amp;childpagename=SKA_newssite%2FAMLayout&amp;cid=1194608106873&amp;p=1192553427666&amp;pagename=SKAWrapper |archivedate=2011-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; calling the Memorial Society of [[Seraphim of Sarov|Saint Seraphim of Sarov]] ({{lang-fi|Serafim Sarovilaisen Muistoyhdistys}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uskonnot.fi/yhteisot/view?orgId=933|title=Pyhittäjäisä Serafim Sarovilaisen Muistoyhdistys ry|website=www.uskonnot.fi|accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[sect]]. The lower court in [[Tampere]] ordered that the mother be detained on suspicion of [[child abduction]]. The order is only effective inside the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name="iltalehti"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Anton unohti suomen kielen | url = http://www.iltalehti.fi/uutiset/200807237990209_uu.shtml | journal = [[Iltalehti]] | date = 23 July 2008 | accessdate = 2009-05-16 | language = Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia is not a signatory of the [[Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction]]. The court also gave sole custody of the child to the father.&lt;ref name="iltalehti" /&gt; In Russia Anton was granted Russian citizenship based on information provided by the mother. According to Uusi Suomi this sort of citizenship is normally granted in months, not in days.&lt;ref name="us2" /&gt;

After locating the child and mother in [[Balakhna]] near [[Nizhny Novgorod]] the father initiated legal proceedings in Russia to regain custody and revoke the Russian citizenship.&lt;ref name="Sanomat"/&gt; On 20 November 2008, the Balakhna City Court revoked Anton's Russian citizenship because his mother had presented false information for registration of citizenship. On 17 March 2009, the judicial board on civil cases of the Nizhny Novgorod regional court upheld the decision.&lt;ref name="Interfax" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Похищенный в Балахне 5-летний мальчик не имеет российского гражданства&amp;nbsp;– решение суда | url = http://nta-nn.ru/news/item/?ID=153000 | publisher = NTA Privolzhie | date = 18 May 2009 | accessdate = 2009-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the decision, the father came to Russia to take Anton back to Finland.

=== Abduction by father ===

Russian online newspaper Grani.ru claimed that in April 2009 Anton was forcibly taken from his mother by his father outside her home on Ryazanova Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = СКП расследует дело о похищении Антона Салонена | url = http://www.sj3.ru/cgi-bin/iframe/grani?820715 | work = [[grani.ru]] | date = 15 May 2009 | accessdate = 2009-05-17 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090417181414/http://www.sj3.ru/cgi-bin/iframe/grani?820715 | archivedate = 17 April 2009 | deadurl = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The press service of Russia's Investigation Committee alleges that on 12 April 2009, the father, acting in conspiracy with persons unknown, attacked the mother and retrieved Anton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = ФИНН, ПОХИТИВШИЙ СЫНА АНТОНА, МОЖЕТ ПОПАСТЬ В РОССИЙСКУЮ ТЮРЬМУ | date=16 May 2009 | url = http://www.regions.ru/news/contries/2215100/ | publisher = regions.ru | accessdate = 2009-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; After allegedly being prevented from leaving Russia, the father and son took refuge at a vacant apartment of the [[List of diplomatic missions of Finland|Finnish Consulate-General]] in [[Saint Petersburg]].

The Russian authorities allegedly ignored the earlier Russian court decision and Anton's Russian citizenship was expeditiously re-instated on May 7.&lt;ref name="alueviesti" /&gt; One day later, on 8 May, Anton was smuggled to Finland in the closed [[diplomatic bag|trunk]] of a diplomatic car by the legal consul at the Saint Petersburg consulate, [[Simo Pietiläinen]].

== Conflict of law ==

There is a [[conflict of law]] between Finland and Russia. It is a criminal offense under Finish law for the Russian mother to take her child to Russia. It is a criminal offense under Russian law for the Finnish diplomat to take the same child from Russia back to Finland. This is why the Finnish diplomat was declared [[persona non grata]]. This is why the [[Russians|Russian]] mother faces [[parental abduction]] [[criminal charges]] in [[Finland]].

== Reactions ==

The incident has been widely covered in Finnish and [[Russian media]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://yle.fi/uutiset/ulkomaat/2009/05/suomeen_tuodun_anton-pojan_kohtalo_puhuttaa_venajalla_744040.html | title =  Suomeen tuodun Anton-pojan kohtalo puhuttaa Venäjällä | publisher = [[YLE]] Uutiset | author = Liisa Lehmus | date = 18 May 2009 | accessdate = 2009-05-18 | language = Finnish | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090521123642/http://yle.fi/uutiset/ulkomaat/2009/05/suomeen_tuodun_anton-pojan_kohtalo_puhuttaa_venajalla_744040.html| archivedate= 21 May 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; in what some commentators have described as a [[Information warfare|media war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Mediasotaa itärajan kahta puolta | author = Tuula Rantonen | journal = [[Karjalainen]] | page = editorial | url = http://www.karjalainen.fi/Karjalainen/Mielipiteet/mediasotaa_it%C3%A4rajan_kahta_puolta_5278889.html | date =19 May 2009 | accessdate = 2009-05-19 | language = Finnish | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090522191348/http://www.karjalainen.fi/Karjalainen/Mielipiteet/mediasotaa_it%C3%A4rajan_kahta_puolta_5278889.html| archivedate= 22 May 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian media have speculated that the incident will have a negative effect on [[Finland–Russia relations]]. The case has also been compared to that of [[Eliza André]].&lt;ref name="MosNews" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Russia launches kidnapping probe against Finnish father | url = http://en.rian.ru/russia/20090515/155026679.html | agency = [[RIA Novosti]] | date = 15 May 2009 | accessdate = 2009-05-18 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090519000658/http://en.rian.ru/russia/20090515/155026679.html| archivedate= 19 May 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Investigation Committee of the Russian Prosecutor's office has launched criminal proceedings against the father on suspicion of "pre-meditated [[kidnapping]] of a person by an organized group" under article 126 of the [[Russian Criminal Code]].&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Finland investigates Anton Salonen case as border offence | url = http://newsroom.finland.fi/stt/showarticle.asp?intNWSAID=21726&amp;group=General | agency = [[Suomen Tietotoimisto|STT]] | publisher = NewsRoom Finland | date = 18 May 2009 | accessdate = 2009-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trial of mother in Finland ==
Anton's mother returned to Finland on 1 August 2009. She was arrested at the airport in the  [[Tampere]].&lt;ref name="rian-en-1" /&gt; A Finnish court considered the case of Anton's mother, and released her pending trial. However she was given a [[Persona non grata|travel ban]] for the next 60 days.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/artikkeli/Lapsikaappauksesta+ep%C3%A4ilty+Anton+Salosen+%C3%A4iti+matkustuskieltoon/1135248158522 Helsingin Sanomat: Lapsikaappauksesta epäilty Anton Salosen äiti matkustuskieltoon&lt;/ref&gt; Through the Russian media, [[Johan Bäckman]] claimed that a Finnish police officer promised not to arrest Anton's mother, and furthermore the mother was allegedly arrested in [[Estonia]]'s capital [[Tallinn]].&lt;ref name="rian-en-1" /&gt; Bäckman was presented as one of the aides or lawyers&lt;ref name="rian-en-1" /&gt; of Rimma Salonen, while the trial lawyer is [[Heikki Lampela]] in Finland&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/artikkeli/Johan+B%C3%A4ckman+Poliisi+ja+Antonin+is%C3%A4+tekiv%C3%A4t+ansan+Rimma+Saloselle/1135248128697|title=Helsingin Sanomat: Johan Bäckman: Poliisi ja Antonin isä tekivät ansan Rimma Saloselle|publisher=|accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dmitry Glazov]] in Russia.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Finnish media have reported some claims as a matter of inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/artikkeli/Rimma+Salosen+tapaus+kuohuttaa+Ven%C3%A4j%C3%A4ll%C3%A4/1135248189979|title=Helsingin Sanomat: Rimma Salosen tapaus kuohuttaa Venäjällä|publisher=|accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The incident has been top television news in Russia. The main villains have been Anton's Finnish father and the Finnish diplomat Simo Pietiläinen. Johan Bäckman has had a central role as commentator about the incident in Russia and Finland. His comments and speculation have been published as such, without checkup, in many Russian media, such as [[Ria Novosti]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rian.ru/society/20090915/185147037.htmlРИА Новости: Финская прокуратура обвинила россиянку Салонен в похищении ребенка ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iltasanomat.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/uutinen.asp?id=1730495|title=Uutiset - Ilta-Sanomat|website=Ilta-Sanomat|accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Later, Rossiyanka interviewed the prosecutor, and corrected the false information: http://www.pravda.ru/news/society/18-09-2009/324434-sal-0&lt;/ref&gt;  Later Bäckman apologized his comments about the incident,&lt;ref&gt;[http://antonfree.blogspot.com/2009/10/johan-backmanin-julkinen-anteeksipyynto.html Johan Bäckman: Johan Bäckmanin julkinen anteeksipyyntö Paavo Saloselle] (in Finnish)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/artikkeli/Johan+B%C3%A4ckman+haluaa+sovitella+riidat+Paavo+Salosen+kanssa/1135250207917 Helsingin Sanomat: Johan Bäckman haluaa sovitella riidat Paavo Salosen kanssa] (in Finnish)&lt;/ref&gt; but he has later recanted and is again arranging demonstrations against Paavo Salonen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://antifasistit.blogspot.com/2012/05/vapauttakaa-anton-salonen-kansanvalinen.html|title=Vapauttakaa Anton Salonen.

The Russian foreign ministry has made negative comments, and implied the negative effect of the incident to mutual relations between Russia and Finland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yle.fi/uutiset/ulkomaat/2009/08/anton-pojan_tapaus_nousi_ykkosuutiseksi_venajalla_906869.html|title=Anton-pojan tapaus nousi ykkösuutiseksi Venäjällä|website=Yle Uutiset|accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Finnish expert on Russia [[Ilmari Susiluoto]], the case of Anton is part of the Kremlin public relations campaign. The Finns have too positive an image in Russia, and this does not fit the Kremlin's idea of the "hostile outside world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uusisuomi.fi/ulkomaat/67846-venajalla-nousi-suomi-kohu|title=Venäjällä nousi Suomi-kohu|publisher=|accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rimma Salonen was given a one to five year [[suspended sentence]] for [[kidnapping]] and [[child abduction]] on 13 October 2009 in [[käräjäoikeus]] (lower court). She also had to pay 20,000 euros for emotional distress to her son and almost 4,800 euros to Paavo Salonen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/artikkeli/Rimma+Salonen+tuomittiin+ehdolliseen+vankeuteen/1135250005726|title=Helsingin Sanomat: Rimma Salonen tuomittiin ehdolliseen vankeuteen|publisher=|accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, [[hovioikeus]] (the Finnish appeals court) upheld Salonen's suspended prison sentence. However, the court did lower the damages awarded Anton Salonen to 10,000 euros. The court also ordered her to pay 7,500 euros in legal fees for Anton and Paavo Salonen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/news/2010/10/rimma_salonen_loses_appeal_2096393.html|title=Turku Appeal Court Upholds Sentence in Child Abduction Case|publisher=|accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
In May 2010, Russian Child Rights Ombudsman [[Pavel Astakhov]] accused the Finnish authorities of denying Anton the right to speak Russian. Astakhov also referred to statements of [[Johan Bäckman]] that Finnish authorities had also banned Anton from praying, being baptized, or wearing crosses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rfdeti.ru/news/rubric-1.1/position-1400.html Office of the Children Rights Ombudsman for the President of the Russian Federation: П.

In March 2011, Rimma Salonen announced she is a candidate for the [[Finnish parliamentary election, 2011|2011 Finnish parliamentary election]] for the [[Workers Party of Finland]]. She also represented the organization of [[Finnish Anti-Fascist Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iltasanomat.fi/vaalit2011/Huoltajuuskiistasta%20tuttu%20Rimma%20Salonen%20pyrkii%20eduskuntaan/art-1288373373617.html|title=Iltasanomat: Huoltajuuskiistasta tuttu Rimma Salonen pyrkii eduskuntaan|publisher=|accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://antifasistit.blogspot.com/2011/03/jussi-parviainen-johan-backman-juha.html|title=Jussi Parviainen, Johan Bäckman, Juha Molari, Rimma Salonen ovat SAFKAn eduskuntavaaliehdokkaat!|publisher=|accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salonen got 16 votes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://192.49.229.35/E2011/e/tulos/ehdkutulos_helsinki.html Electoral district of Helsinki] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928082454/http://192.49.229.35/E2011/e/tulos/ehdkutulos_helsinki.html |date=2011-09-28 }} Official results of Finnish Justice Ministry&lt;/ref&gt;

Russia joined the [[Hague Abduction Convention]] on 1 October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=events.details&amp;year=2011&amp;varevent=228|title=HCCH -  The Russian Federation becomes the 86th Contracting State to the Hague Child Abduction Convention|first=e-Vision.nl, The|last=Netherlands|website=www.hcch.net|accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012 Rimma Salonen appealed to the Russian people and called for help because, according to her, Western authorities are stealing talented and unique Russian children to supplant Western children who are just robots and sex dolls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://antifasistit.blogspot.com/2012/04/rimma-salonens-appeal-to-russian-people.html|title=Rimma Salonen's appeal to the Russian people|publisher=|accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013 [[Supreme Court of Finland]]  decided not to give Rimma Salonen [[Certiorari|right to appeal]] for the ruling of Vaasa [[Hovrätt]]. This means Anton's father is his [[legal guardian]] as Vaasa Hovrätt ruled.&lt;ref name="Mtv31707"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv3.fi/uutiset/kotimaa.shtml/2013/07/1781533/isa-voitti-anton-pojan-huoltajuuskiistan|title=Isä voitti Anton-pojan huoltajuuskiistan |publisher=Mtv3.fi|date=17 July 2013|accessdate=17 July 2013|language=fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Batman''' ('''Bruce Wayne''') is a fictional [[superhero]] and an [[Alternative versions of Batman|alternative version]] of the [[DC Comics]] [[Batman|character of the same name]]. This version of Batman was created by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] and first appeared in ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'' #1 ([[1986 in comics#February|February 1986]]). This satirical version of the character is regarded as an older, darker interpretation of the character who, after years of retirement, resumes his role as a vigilante and, eventually, a revolutionary [[freedom fighter]].

==Publication history==
{{Main article|Batman#The Dark Knight Returns and later}}
In his introduction to ''The Dark Knight Returns'' #1, Frank Miller says that he got the idea for the character while going through a [[midlife crisis]], while on the verge of turning 30.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman: The Dark Knight Returns'' #1, February 1986&lt;/ref&gt; He later said that while he could tolerate the fact that his little brother was older than [[Spider-Man]], the fact that he himself was getting older than Batman "was something that needed to be stopped."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0588340/bio Frank Miller (II) - Biography]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ''[[All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder]]'' is printed under the [[All Star DC Comics]] [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]], it takes place in its own continuity outside of [[Grant Morrison]]'s ''[[All Star Superman]]'' [[canon (fiction)|canon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=82819 Geoff Johns on All Star Batgirl]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011204906/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=82819 |date=October 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Miller, ''All Star Batman'' is the same version of his character set in the continuity of ''The Dark Knight Returns'' ''(DKR)'', ''[[Batman: Year One|Year One]]'' ''(YO)'', ''[[The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'' ''(DKSA)'', and ''[[The Dark Knight III: The Master Race]]'' and ''Dark Knight Returns: The Last Crusade''. The series has an abstract depiction of its historical setting, as the satirical nature of the books often requires the aesthetic setting to shift with modern times with each new title; ''The Dark Knight Returns'' retained its 1980s themes due to its commentary on [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]]-era politics, while the sequel more closely resembled [[George Bush, Jr.|Bush]]-era America and ''All Star Batman'' and ''The Master Race'' both resemble the nature of the contemporary "digital age". Out of all of the stories, ''Year One'' was the only one that also existed in the core DC continuity, until it was replaced by ''[[Batman: Zero Year]]''.&lt;ref name="ign"&gt;[http://comics.ign.com/articles/685/685820p1.html ''Comics in Context #119: All Star Bats'' on IGN]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the maxiseries ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', it is revealed that a new DC [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]] of 52 different Earths now exists. The Dark Knight Universe ''(DKU)'' was formerly designated as "Earth-31", but it is not included amongst the current [[New 52]] [[DC Multiverse]] and another alternate Earth has taken its place. It is unclear whether the Dark Knight Universe still occurs within the canonical [[New 52]] DC multiverse, although the profiles of seven DC alternate Earths are still currently unknown according to the [[The Multiversity|''Multiversity'']] handbook.

''[[Spawn/Batman]]'', which has Batman team up with [[Todd McFarlane]]'s character [[Spawn (comics)|Spawn]], was released as a companion to ''The Dark Knight Returns'' and takes place in the same universe.

== Characterization ==
This version of Batman's character has varied throughout the course of his publication history. In ''[[Batman: Year One]]'' and ''The Dark Knight Returns'', he is basically still the brooding, bitter vigilante from the mainstream comics, while in ''All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder'' and ''The Dark Knight Strikes Again'', he has evolved into something of an [[antihero]]. In ''The Dark Knight Strikes Again'', his actions could at least be justified since he is fighting a high-stakes war against [[Lex Luthor]] and [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]]'s police-state regime, in which attempting to preserve life could be seen as a weakness. In ''All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder'', however, he appears to brutalize criminals for the fun of it, and even goes as far as to berate and abuse the young [[Dick Grayson]] after kidnapping him after his parents died (though in this case, interior monologues show that he is in conflict with himself for these actions). At the end of ''The Dark Knight Strikes Again'', after Luthor and Brainiac have been defeated and the world now in the safe hands of Superman, Batman encounters Dick as the new "[[Joker (comics)|Joker]]" and kills him rather than try to rehabilitate him.

== Fictional character biography ==
Much like the mainstream [[New Earth (DC Comics)|New Earth]]/[[Post-Crisis]] Batman, Miller's [[Batman]] begins his journey after his parents are murdered by [[Joe Chill]]. (However, in ''Dark Knight Returns'', it is hinted that he never found out who murdered his parents.) He travels the world in search of a means to fight crime, which include various forms of [[martial arts]] and forensic skills. After returning to [[Gotham City]] in his early twenties, Bruce takes up the mantle of the Batman. In his first few months, he exposes [[police corruption]] in the [[Gotham City Police Department]], unsettles the empire of crime lord [[Carmine Falcone]], and gains an ally in Lieutenant [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]]. At some unspecified point, shortly after the events of ''Year One'', he stops [[The Joker (comics)|The Joker]] from poisoning Gotham's water supply.&lt;ref&gt;[[Batman: Year One]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Also around this time, he uses the Gotham sewers as his first [[Batcave]] to prove to himself that he doesn't need his wealth, and learns [[Catwoman]]'s identity.

In the second year of his career, Batman takes on a protégé in young acrobat [[Dick Grayson]], whose parents are killed by a hitman upon The Joker's orders. Batman accepts Dick into his inner circle, and he debuts as [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]. It is during this time that he meets [[Justice League of America]] (JLA) members [[Superman]] and [[Hal Jordan]], to whom he shows complete disrespect. During this time, Bruce Wayne grows to love being Batman and constantly refers to himself as ''the Goddamn Batman''. His own inexperience makes him reckless and ruthless towards criminals, however, and he treats Dick with nothing short of abuse and contempt, forcing him to live uncomfortably in the Batcave and chastising [[Alfred Pennyworth]] for showing him kindness.&lt;ref&gt;[[All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fifteen years prior to the events of ''DKR'', Batman fires Dick (the reason is unknown, though Batman states it was for "cowardice and incompetence") and replaces him with [[Jason Todd]]. Some time later, Bruce is involved in riots, during which he modifies the [[Batmobile]] to its tank-like structure. Batman later becomes a member of the JLA and seems to develops a strong friendship with [[Hal Jordan]] ([[Green Lantern]]), similar to his friendship with Superman in the Mainstream DC Universe, twelve years before ''DKR''.

Batman apprehends [[Two-Face]] one last time before his retirement. Two-Face's last crime is the kidnapping of [[conjoined twins|Siamese twins]], and the JLA is pressured into disbanding by [[political correctness]] groups. While most members of the JLA retire, Superman goes to work for the government, and Batman continues to fight crime in Gotham. Batman's best friend in the superhero community, Hal Jordan, retires to space, though Batman begs him to stay.

[[Arkham Asylum]] for the Criminally Insane becomes Arkham Home for the Emotionally Troubled, due to the wave of political correctness. Batman and Robin investigate a strange blackmail case involving [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]], during which Bruce becomes injured and Jason becomes increasingly violent and unpredictable. The Joker escapes Arkham soon after. Jason, upset that Batman is not pursuing the Joker after he escaped, goes to where the Joker is staying and tries to break in. He is killed by the Joker's henchmen, who were waiting outside the door before he entered. Ten years before ''DKR'', Batman retires over the burden of Jason's death. According to Superman, the other superheroes "almost threw a party." The Joker enters a catatonic state for about ten years due to Batman's disappearance.

Seven years before ''DKR'', Bruce crosses paths with Dick again, but it ends badly and they part ways on bad terms. Over the next decade, Bruce takes to drinking heavily and engaging in near-[[suicide|suicidal]] risk-taking. Despite maintaining his image as a playboy, he invests a considerable amount in the rehabilitation of Harvey Dent, the former [[Two-Face]]. Following an "anniversary" of Batman's last crusade with Jim Gordon, a 55-year-old Bruce is almost mugged by a group of street hoods. He defends himself, realizing that he cannot ignore the rising wave of crime.

A new teenage gang called "The Mutants" begins to terrorize the police and citizens of Gotham. Bruce begins suffering [[night terrors]] and [[somnabulism|sleepwalking]] which ends in his waking in the Batcave. After watching ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1920 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' and reliving the murders of his parents (who had taken him to see the film on the night they were killed), he dons the cape and cowl once more. He manages to save Gotham from Two-Face and the Mutant gang, and takes on a new sidekick &amp;mdash; [[Carrie Kelley]], the new Robin. When the Joker reappears and kills hundreds of people, Batman fights him one last time, but the Joker kills himself and Batman is framed for his murder. Superman is sent by the government to stop Batman's increasingly violent style of vigilantism. Batman confronts the Man of Steel with a variety of weapons, including several missiles and a sonic gun. Batman fights Superman to what appears to be his own death, but not before beating Superman. It is later revealed that he was induced to catatonia but revived to lead an underground subversive movement alongside Carrie, [[Green Arrow]] and the Mutants (renamed as the Sons of Batman).&lt;ref&gt;[[The Dark Knight Returns]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years after going underground, Bruce Wayne and Carrie (now known as Catgirl) train an army of "Batboys" to save the world from a "[[police-state]]" [[dictatorship]] led by [[Lex Luthor]]. In a series of raids on government facilities, Batman's soldiers release from captivity other superheroes including: the [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]] (trapped for years in a [[petri dish]]), [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]] (forced to run on a treadmill to provide America with free power), and [[Plastic Man]] (now insane and trapped in [[Arkham Asylum]]). [[Elongated Man]] is recruited from his job as a commercial spokesman and Green Arrow is working with Batman.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]&lt;/ref&gt; Luthor responds by sending a genetically-superpowered man who resembles the Joker to kill as many superheroes as possible. Batman, with help from his allies, manages to take Luthor down, and Luthor is killed by the son of [[Hawkman]], who had been killed earlier on by Luthor.

As he returns home, Batman receives a communication from Carrie, who is being attacked by the new Joker. Batman rushes to her aid and recognises the man as Dick, who has been genetically manipulated to possess a powerful healing factor, but has been driven insane. Batman shows nothing but contempt for his former sidekick and plans his death the moment they face each other. Batman hurls himself and Dick into a miles-deep crevasse filled with lava and blows up the entire cave, igniting an underground volcano and destroying everything. Dick falls into the lava and is killed, but Batman is saved by Superman at the last moment and brought to Carrie in the Batmobile.

'''Robert Earle Clarke''' (born August 13, 1949), also known as '''Bob Clarke''' (since retirement as a player) and '''Bobby Clarke''' (while active as a player), is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] former professional [[ice hockey]] [[Centre (ice hockey)|centre]] who played his entire 15-year [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) career with the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] and is currently an executive with the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flyers.nhl.com/club/page.htm?id=35749|title=Bio - Clarke - Philadelphia Flyers - Team |publisher=Philadelphia Flyers |accessdate=October 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clarke is widely acknowledged as being one of the greatest hockey players and [[Captain (ice hockey)|captains]] of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pelletier |first=Joe |url=http://broadstreetbullies.blogspot.com/2006/05/bobby-clarke.html |title=Bobby Clarke |publisher=Greatest Hockey Legends.com |accessdate=June 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hoffman |first=Patrick |url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/top-10-captains-in-nhl-history/ |title=Top 10 captains in NHL history |publisher=[[Sportsnet]] |accessdate=May 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was captain of the Flyers from 1973 to 1979, winning the [[Stanley Cup]] with them in both [[1974 Stanley Cup Finals|1974]] and [[1975 Stanley Cup Finals|1975]]. He was again captain of the Flyers from 1982 to 1984 before retiring. A 3-time [[Hart Memorial Trophy|Hart Trophy]] winner and 1987 [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] inductee, Clarke was rated number 24 on [[The Hockey News]]' list of ''[[List of 100 greatest hockey players by The Hockey News|The Top 100 NHL Players of All-Time]]'' in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Dryden, [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0771041756/ The Top 100 NHL Players of All-Time], 1998&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 Clarke was named one of the '[[100 Greatest NHL Players]]' in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=100 Greatest NHL Players|url=https://www.nhl.com/fans/nhl-centennial/100-greatest-nhl-players|publisher=National Hockey League|accessdate=January 27, 2017|date=January 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clarke had three 100-point seasons, twice leading the league in [[Assist (ice hockey)|assists]],&lt;ref name="BSBblogspot"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://broadstreetbullies.blogspot.com/2006/05/bobby-clarke.html|title=Philadelphia Flyers Legends: Bobby Clarke|date=May 2006|accessdate=2007-07-08|publisher=Greatest Hockey Legends.com|author=Joe Pelletier}}&lt;/ref&gt; and played in eight [[NHL All-Star Game]]s. He also won the [[Frank J. Selke Trophy]] in [[1982–83 NHL season|1983]], as the league's best defensive forward.

Upon retiring at the end of the [[1983–84 NHL season|1983–84]] season with 358 goals and 852 assists for a total of 1,210 points in 1,144 career games, he immediately became general manager of the Flyers. He spent 19 of the following 23 seasons as a general manager of the Flyers, also briefly serving as general manager of the [[Minnesota North Stars]] and [[Florida Panthers]], and reached the Stanley Cup Finals three times with the Flyers and once with Minnesota. His time as an NHL general manager had its share of controversy, perhaps none greater than the rift between him and star player [[Eric Lindros]] during the late 1990s and early 2000s. He resigned from the general manager position less than a month into the [[2006–07 NHL season|2006–07]] season and is currently the Flyers' senior vice president.&lt;ref name="SrVP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flyers.nhl.com/club/page.htm?id=35749|title=Bio - Clarke - Philadelphia Flyers - Team|publisher=philadelphiaflyers.com|accessdate=2011-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The image of Clarke, with a toothless grin, embracing the Stanley Cup and winking following the Flyers' victory in the [[1975 Stanley Cup Finals]] is considered one of the most iconic and famous photos in the history of the sport of hockey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greatesthockeylegends.com/2008/08/greatest-photos-in-hockey-history-18.html|title=Bobby Clarke's Toothless Grin|accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in the small northern Manitoban mining town of Flin Flon,&lt;ref name="Russia"/&gt; Clarke began playing organized hockey when he was eight years old.&lt;ref name="HonouredPlayer"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/LegendsMember.jsp?mem=P198701&amp;type=Player&amp;page=bio&amp;list=ByName#photo|title=The Legends - Honoured Player - Bobby Clarke - Biography|accessdate=2007-07-08|work=''LegendsofHockey.net''|publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the time he was 12 or 13 years old, he learned he had [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|type 1 diabetes]].&lt;ref name="Spotlight"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/html/spot_oneononep198701.htm|title=Spotlight - One on One with Bobby Clarke|date=2003-05-02|accessdate=2007-07-08|author=Kevin Shea|work=''LegendsofHockey.net''|publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929125237/http://www.legendsofhockey.net/html/spot_oneononep198701.htm|archive-date=2007-09-29|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though he progressed into a highly touted prospect playing for the [[Flin Flon Bombers]], leading the league in which the Bombers played in scoring in each of his last three years of junior hockey, NHL teams feared Clarke would never be able to play in the NHL because of his diabetes.&lt;ref name="Russia"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://english.portal.sport-express.ru/articles/9_68/|title=SPORT EXPRESS - BOBBY CLARKE: "I WAS NO FIGHTER..."|accessdate=August 9, 2012|work=Sports Express Daily|date=July 24, 2006|author=Slava Malamud|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201201037/http://english.portal.sport-express.ru/articles/9_68/|archivedate=February 1, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bombers coach [[Pat Ginnell]] took Clarke to the [[Mayo Clinic]] in [[Minnesota]] following the 1967–68 season and the doctors concluded that as long as he took care of himself he could play professionally.&lt;ref name="HonouredPlayer"/&gt; Ginnell asked the doctors to write that statement down and when NHL scouts came to watch the Bombers play during the 1968–69 season, Ginnell showed them the doctor's verdict.&lt;ref name="HonouredPlayer"/&gt;

Even with such assurances Clarke fell to the second round of the [[1969 NHL Amateur Draft]] and was finally selected by the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] 17th overall. After [[Gerry Melnyk]], a scout and administrative assistant with the Flyers, tried to convince general manager [[Bud Poile]] to draft Clarke with their first-round pick and failed&lt;ref name="FlyersHistoryHoF"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.flyershistory.net/cgi-bin/hofprof.cgi?002|title=Flyers History - Hall of Fame Profile - Bobby Clarke|accessdate=2007-07-08|work=P.

==NHL career==
[[File:Bobby Clarke 1983.jpg|thumb|Clarke playing for [[Philadelphia Flyers]] in 1983]]
Wearing #16, Clarke made his NHL debut on October 11, 1969, against the [[Minnesota North Stars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flyershistory.net/cgi-bin/boxscore.cgi?19690004|title=Flyers History - Philadelphia Flyers Game Summary - 11-Oct-69|work=P.

His efforts helped the Flyers make the playoffs, but Clarke was held scoreless in his first playoff action and the Flyers lost in four games to the [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]].&lt;ref name="HonouredPlayer"/&gt;

A [[tooth abscess]] was the cause of a slow start to the [[1971–72 NHL season|1971–72]] season;&lt;ref name="FlyersHistoryHoF"/&gt; 20 pounds underweight, Clarke only managed 5 goals and 11 assists 31 games into the season.&lt;ref name="FlyersHistoryHoF"/&gt; He rebounded over the final 47 games, scoring 30 goals and 35 assists&lt;ref name="FlyersHistoryHoF"/&gt; and bringing his totals to 35 goals and 46 assists. His dedication was rewarded when he became the first Flyer to win a major NHL award, the [[Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy]],&lt;ref name="HonouredPlayer"/&gt; and the Flyers re-signed him to a five-year contract worth $100,000 per season, a raise of $75,000 per season.&lt;ref name="FlyersHistoryStats"/&gt;

A few months following his strong play during the [[Summit Series]] for [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Team Canada]], Clarke was named the Flyers' captain at age 23, the youngest to ever assume that role in NHL history at the time.&lt;ref name="BSBblogspot"/&gt; As leader of the brawling Broad Street Bullies, Clarke became the first player from an [[1967 NHL Expansion|expansion team]] to score more than 100 points in a season,&lt;ref name="BSBblogspot"/&gt; 104 points (37 goals, 67 assists) total. Facing the [[Minnesota North Stars]] in the first round, the Flyers and Clarke received a scare, as he was hit in the eye with a stick which broke his contact lens and was rushed to the hospital.&lt;ref name="FlyersHistoryHoF"/&gt; After removing parts of his broken contact from under the eye, Clarke returned to the lineup the next game despite having suffered a scratched cornea,&lt;ref name="FlyersHistoryHoF"/&gt; and the Flyers won their first playoff series. The Flyers lost to the [[Montreal Canadiens]] during the next round, but Clarke was later awarded the [[Hart Memorial Trophy]] as the league's MVP and the Lester B. Pearson Award as the league's most outstanding player as voted by the league's players.

Clarke's production fell to 87 points in 77 games during the [[1973–74 NHL season|1973–74]] regular season, but his leadership and [[Bernie Parent]]'s stellar goaltending led the Flyers to the second best record in the league and to the Stanley Cup Finals to play the team with the best record, the [[Boston Bruins]]. After losing Game 1, Clarke scored arguably the biggest goal of his career in overtime of Game 2, putting a rebound shot in over Bruins goaltender [[Gilles Gilbert]].&lt;ref name="FlyersHistoryHoF"/&gt; The Flyers won three of the next four games and became the first expansion team to win the [[Stanley Cup]].&lt;ref name="BSBblogspot"/&gt; Clarke played a key role in the Finals in countering Bruins' star players, winning 48 of the 66 face-offs against [[Phil Esposito]], and neutralizing [[Bobby Orr]] by chasing him down. The Stanley Cup winning goal in game six was scored after a fight between Clarke and Orr that sent both players to the penalty box.[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/nhl/features/si_stanley_cup/70s/#1974]

Clarke set the NHL record, at the time, for most assists by a centreman with 89&lt;ref name="FlyersHistoryHoF"/&gt; during the [[1974–75 NHL season|1974–75]] season on his way to a 116-point season. He finished second in the league in plus-minus rating with a plus 79, which illustrates his strong two-way play.  The Flyers returned to the Stanley Cup Finals and defeated the [[Buffalo Sabres]] in six games, repeating as Stanley Cup champions. In addition to the second championship, Clarke was awarded the Hart Trophy for the second time, while being voted to the league's First All-Star Team.

[[1975–76 NHL season|1975–76]] was a record breaking season for Clarke. Playing on the LCB line with [[Reggie Leach]] and [[Bill Barber]], the trio set a record for most goals by a line with 141.&lt;ref name="17thoverall"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hockeydraftcentral.com/1969/69017.html|title=1969 NHL Amateur Draft -- Bobby Clarke|accessdate=2007-07-08|publisher=HockeyDraftCentral.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also tied his mark of the previous season with 89 assists and set a personal best and franchise record for most points in a single season with 119 (later broken by [[Mark Recchi]] in [[1992–93 NHL season|1992–93]]).&lt;ref name="PHIseasonleaders"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hockey-reference.com/teams/PHI/leaders_season.html|title=Philadelphia Flyers Season Leaders|work=Hockey-Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=2011-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also led the league in plus-minus rating with a plus 83.  The Flyers, without Parent and [[Rick MacLeish]],&lt;ref name="FlyersHistoryHoF"/&gt; made their third straight Finals appearance. However, Montreal coach [[Scotty Bowman]]'s strategy successful prevented Clarke's line from scoring and the Flyers were swept in four straight games.[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/nhl/features/si_stanley_cup/70s/#1974] Clarke was awarded his third Hart Trophy and named to the NHL First All-Star team. Clarke's production would drop off over the next few seasons; in fact, his point total fell six seasons in a row. But the Flyers remained contenders, reaching the semifinals and losing to Boston in [[1976–77 NHL season|1976–77]] and [[1977–78 NHL season|1977–78]].

[[File:Bob_Clarke_2012.jpg|thumb|left|Clarke pictured during the Alumni game for the [[2012 NHL Winter Classic]] on December 31, 2011.]]After a quarterfinal loss to the Rangers in [[1978–79 NHL season|1978–79]], Clarke was named an assistant coach.&lt;ref name="FlyersHistoryHoF"/&gt; In order to become an assistant he had to give up the captaincy due to NHL rules,&lt;ref name="FlyersHistoryHoF"/&gt; so [[Mel Bridgman]] was named the 4th captain in Flyers history. His first season as a playing assistant coach, [[1979–80 NHL season|1979–80]], saw the Flyers go on an undefeated streak of 35 games, not only the longest in NHL history, but the longest in North American professional sports history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flyershistory.com/streak.htm|title=Flyers History - The Streak - 35 Game Undefeated Streak|work=P. Anson|publisher=FlyersHistory.net|accessdate=2011-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Flyers made it to the Stanley Cup Finals before losing to the [[New York Islanders]] in six games. During the playoffs, Clarke scored 8 goals and assisted on 12 others in 19 games, all 8 goals coming on the power play.&lt;ref name="FlyersHistoryStats"/&gt; Following the playoffs, Clarke was awarded the [[Lester Patrick Trophy]] along with Flyers owner [[Ed Snider]] and former Flyers coach [[Fred Shero]].

Clarke wore the number 16 throughout his entire NHL career except for two games during the {{NHL Year|1980}} season.&lt;ref name="16stolen"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hockeybookreviews.com/2008/02/little-book-of-hockey-sweaters.html|title=Hockey Book Reviews.com: The Little Book Of Hockey Sweaters|accessdate=2011-02-02|date=2008-02-06|publisher=Joe Pelletier}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to a road game on February 27, 1981,&lt;ref name="36game1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flyershistory.net/cgi-bin/boxscore.cgi?19800064|title=Flyers History - Philadelphia Flyers Game Summary - 27-Feb-81|work=P.

On March 19 during a game against the [[Boston Bruins]], a Reggie Leach slapshot struck Clarke.&lt;ref name="FlyersHistoryHoF"/&gt; After leaving the ice, he re-appeared moments later stitched up and with his jersey covered in blood.&lt;ref name="FlyersHistoryHoF"/&gt; 31 seconds into the third period Clarke beat Bruins goalie [[Marco Baron]] for his 19th goal of the season&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flyershistory.net/cgi-bin/boxscore.cgi?19800073|title=Flyers History - Philadelphia Flyers Game Summary - 19-Mar-81|work=P.

Despite his diabetes and hard-nosed play, Clarke proved to be remarkably durable. A broken foot suffered during the [[1981–82 NHL season|1981–82]] season&lt;ref name="FlyersHistoryStats"/&gt; limited him to 62 games, the only time in his career he played fewer than 70 games in a season. No longer an assistant coach, Clarke reassumed the captaincy from Bill Barber during {{NHL Year|1982}}. He skated in his [[List of NHL players with 1000 games played|1000th career game]] on October 23, 1982, against the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]]. Clarke had his best season since 1977–78, scoring 85 points in 80 games. He also won the [[Frank J. Selke Trophy]], given annually to the league's best defensive forward. After the Flyers were eliminated from the playoffs in the first round for the third straight season in {{NHL Year|1983}} and the general manager position opened up after [[Bob McCammon]] resigned,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/25/sports/sports-people-2-coaches-out.html|title=SPORTS PEOPLE; 2 Coaches Out|website=[[The New York Times]]|date=1984-04-25|accessdate=2011-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clarke retired on May 15, 1984, to become the general manager of the Flyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/16/sports/sports-people-clarke-quits-playing.html|title=SPORTS PEOPLE; Clarke Quits Playing|website=[[The New York Times]]|date=1984-05-16|accessdate=2011-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 14, 2017, Clarke played in the Flyers' 50th anniversary alumni game against the alumni of the Pittsburgh Penguins, where he combined with his longtime linemates, Bill Barber and Reggie Leach, which ended in a 3–3 tie before a sold out crowd of over 19,000 at the [[Wells Fargo Center (Philadelphia)|Wells Fargo Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Breen|first1=Matt|title=Alumni game marks a farewell of sorts for Flyers' Bob Clarke|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/sports/flyers/20170115_Alumni_game_marks_a_farewell_of_sorts_for_Flyers__Bob_Clarke.html|website=Philadelphia Daily News|accessdate=May 23, 2017|date=January 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the game Clarke announced that it would be his last alumni game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carchidi|first1=Sam|title=Clarke, Barber say alumni game will be their last|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/sports/flyers/20170112_Clarke__Barber_say_alumni_game_will_be_their_last.html|website=Philadelphia Daily News|accessdate=May 23, 2017|date=January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clarke played for Team Canada three times during his career. He played a major role in defeating the Soviet Union during the [[Summit Series]] in 1972, captained the Canadian team to gold at the [[1976 Canada Cup]], and won a bronze medal at the 1982 World Championships. In addition, he led the Flyers to the only [[1976 Flyers–Red Army game|outright victory]] over the Soviet Union's best team, Soviet Red Army, during the 1976 [[Super Series]], and took part in the [[1979 Challenge Cup (ice hockey)|1979 Challenge Cup]] with the NHL All-Stars. After his playing career, he served as one of Canada's four general managers during the [[1987 Canada Cup|1987]] and [[1991 Canada Cup]]s&lt;ref name="17thoverall"/&gt; and served as Canada's lone general manager during the [[1998 Winter Olympics]].

===Summit Series===
Coming off his third NHL season, Clarke was the last player Team Canada selected to play in the Summit Series.&lt;ref name="1972SummitSeries"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.1972summitseries.com/clarke.html|title=Clarke Did What He Had To Do|accessdate=2007-07-08|work=Joe Pelletier|publisher=1972summitseries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; His line with [[Ron Ellis]] and [[Paul Henderson]] turned out to be Canada's best during the series,&lt;ref name="1972SummitSeries"/&gt; Clarke tallying two goals and four assists in the eight game series won by Canada as well as being awarded Team Canada MVP in game one of the series.&lt;ref name="1972SummitSeries"/&gt; Clarke's play earned the respect of many during the series, Henderson saying, "The best thing that could have happened to Ronnie (Ellis) and me was to get this young kid making plays for us. He was terrific!"&lt;ref name="1972SummitSeries"/&gt; [[Wayne Cashman]] would add, "There were guys on Team Canada who took their game to new heights in that series. A perfect example would be Bobby Clarke."&lt;ref name="1972SummitSeries"/&gt; The Soviet team's assistant coach, [[Boris Kulagin]], thought Clarke was Canada's best player.&lt;ref name="FlyersHistoryHoF"/&gt; Clarke's strong play was largely attributed to the fact that, unlike many of the Canadian players, Clarke reported to training camp in top physical condition, as he had always followed a strict off-season training regimen.  Though he earned much praise due to his play, he was also criticized for an incident during the sixth game which is often referred to as, "The Slash."&lt;ref name="Slashof72"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://proicehockey.about.com/library/blhenderson-clarke.htm|title=Classic Hockey Quotes - great hockey quotes past and present|accessdate=2007-07-08|publisher=About.com|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clarke's line played against the line of the Soviets' top player, [[Valeri Kharlamov]], during the entire series.&lt;ref name="Russia"/&gt; After being on the receiving end of some stick work from Kharlamov while going for the puck,&lt;ref name="Russia"/&gt; Clarke caught up with Kharlamov and laid a two-handed slash across his ankle,&lt;ref name="Russia"/&gt; breaking it in the process.&lt;ref name="Kharlamov"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chidlovski.com/personal/1972/yroster/ru17.htm|title=The Summit in 1972: Players Info - Valery Kharlamov|accessdate=2007-07-13|work=Arthur R. Chidlovski|publisher=chidlovski.com|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Kharlamov finished the game, he missed the seventh game and was largely ineffective in the eighth.&lt;ref name="Kharlamov"/&gt; When asked about the slash years later, Clarke said, "If I hadn't learned to lay on a two-hander once in a while, I'd never have left Flin Flon."&lt;ref name="1972SummitSeries"/&gt; 30 years after the series, Henderson criticized Clarke, calling the slash, "the low point of the series."&lt;ref name="Slashof72"/&gt; Clarke responded saying that he thought it was "improper to criticize a teammate thirty years later," and that he did not "understand why he would bring it up now."&lt;ref name="Slashof72"/&gt; Henderson has since retracted his criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2002/09/19/clarke-henderson020919.html | publisher=[[CBC News]] | title=Paul Henderson sorry for criticizing Clarke slash | date=2002-10-07 |accessdate=2011-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kharlamov, prior to his death in 1981, said he thought Clarke was tasked with "taking me out of the game."&lt;ref name="Kharlamov"/&gt; [[John Ferguson, Sr.]], an assistant coach with Team Canada in 1972, said, "I called Clarke over to the bench, looked over at Kharlamov and said, 'I think he needs a tap on the ankle.' I didn't think twice about it. It was Us versus Them. And Kharlamov was killing us. I mean, somebody had to do it. And I sure wasn't going to ask Henderson."&lt;ref name="Slashof72"/&gt; Clarke, however, does not recall Ferguson telling him this.&lt;ref name="Russia"/&gt;

===Nagano Olympics===
Named general manager of Team Canada on January 30, 1997,&lt;ref name="17thoverall"/&gt; Clarke was tasked with picking which NHLers would compete for Canada at the [[Ice hockey at the 1998 Winter Olympics|1998 Winter Olympics]] in Nagano, the first time NHLers would compete in the Olympics. A few of Clarke's choices were the source of some consternation, in particular omitting [[Mark Messier]] in favour of surprise selection [[Rob Zamuner]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/30/sports/hockey-gretzky-in-messier-out-as-canada-picks-team.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm | work=The New York Times | title=HOCKEY; Gretzky In, Messier Out As Canada Picks Team | first=Ed | last=Willes | date=1997-11-30 | accessdate=2011-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and choosing 24-year-old [[Eric Lindros]] as the team's captain over the likes of [[Wayne Gretzky]], [[Ray Bourque]], and [[Steve Yzerman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/508439821.html?dids=508439821:508439821&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Feb+04%2C+1998&amp;author=Roy+MacGregor&amp;pub=The+Spectator&amp;desc=All+eyes+on+Eric%3A+Is+24-year-old+Eric+Lindros+ready+to+carry+Canada's+hockey+hopes%3F&amp;pqatl=google | title=All eyes on Eric: Is 24-year-old Eric Lindros ready to carry Canada's hockey hopes? | first=Roy | last=MacGregor | date=1998-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ranked number one going into the tournament, Team Canada played strongly until being stymied by Czech goaltender [[Dominik Hašek]] in the semifinals, losing in a [[Shootout (ice hockey)|shootout]]. They then lost 3–2 to Finland in the bronze medal match.

==NHL management==
Following his retirement, Clarke's first stint as Flyers general manager lasted six seasons and included two trips to the Stanley Cup Finals in [[1985 Stanley Cup Finals|1985]] and [[1987 Stanley Cup Finals|1987]]. After making the playoffs in each of his first five seasons in the front office, the Flyers fell off during the [[1989–90 NHL season|1989–90]] season and missed the playoffs, resulting in his firing by Flyers President [[Jay Snider]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/17/sports/sports-people-hockey-flyers-dismiss-clarke.html|title=SPORTS PEOPLE: HOCKEY; Flyers Dismiss Clarke|website=[[The New York Times]]|date=1990-04-17|accessdate=2011-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clarke moved on to the [[Minnesota North Stars]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/09/sports/sports-people-hockey-north-stars-hire-clarke-as-general-manager.html|title=SPORTS PEOPLE: HOCKEY; North Stars Hire Clarke As General Manager|website=[[The New York Times]]|date=1990-06-09|accessdate=2011-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and spent two seasons as the North Stars general manager, one of which saw a surprise run to the Finals in [[1991 Stanley Cup Finals|1991]].&lt;ref name="17thoverall"/&gt;

Leaving Minnesota, Clarke returned to Philadelphia to assume the role of Senior Vice President during the [[1992–93 NHL season|1992–93]] season, and served as a mentor for young phenom Eric Lindros during his first season.&lt;ref name="17thoverall"/&gt; Clarke moved on shortly after and took the general manager position with the expansion [[Florida Panthers]], a team which set the expansion team record for wins and points during a season in [[1993–94 NHL season|1993–94]]. He returned to the role of Flyers general manager prior to the [[1994–95 NHL season|1994–95]] season (Florida was compensated with cash and Philadelphia's second-round draft pick in the [[1994 NHL Entry Draft]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/16/sports/sports-people-hockey-compensation-for-clarke.html|title=SPORTS PEOPLE: HOCKEY; Compensation for Clarke|website=[[The New York Times]]|date=1994-06-16|accessdate=2011-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he rebuilt the team into a Cup contender. During his second tenure as general manager of the Flyers, the team made the playoffs 11 seasons in a row but reached the Finals once ([[1997 Stanley Cup Finals|1997]]). Following a poor start to the [[2006–07 NHL season|2006–07]] season, Clarke resigned citing a possible burnout and a lack of desire.&lt;ref name="Resignation"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=2634817|title=Flyers GM Clarke resigns; coach Hitchcock fired|date=2006-10-24|accessdate=2007-07-26|publisher=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clarke returned to the franchise on December 4, 2006, and was named Senior Vice President.&lt;ref name="SrVP"/&gt;

===Controversy and criticism===
Clarke failed to win a Stanley Cup over the 22 seasons he was a general manager with Philadelphia, Minnesota, and Florida. During his 19 seasons as Flyers manager over two stints, the Flyers reached the Stanley Cup finals three times and amassed a regular season record of 714–443–199,&lt;ref name="SrVP"/&gt; but for one reason or another always came up short of a Cup title.&lt;ref name="Doomed"/&gt; Clarke's Flyers in 1985 and 1987 were considered underdogs to the powerhouse [[Edmonton Oilers]], as were his North Stars to the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] in 1991. In his second tenure as Flyers manager, the team lost in the postseason, frequently to lower-seeded teams. While goaltending was a strength during his first tenure with two [[Vezina Trophy]] winners between the pipes ([[Pelle Lindbergh]] and [[Ron Hextall]]), only Hextall in 1995, a combination of Hextall and [[Garth Snow]] in 1997, [[Brian Boucher]] in [[1999–2000 NHL season|2000]], and [[Robert Esche]] in [[2003–04 NHL season|2004]] got the Flyers past the second round of the playoffs during his second stint. By contrast the [[New Jersey Devils]], their [[Atlantic Division (NHL)|Atlantic Division]] rivals, were stable in net with [[Martin Brodeur]] and beat the Flyers in the Conference Finals en route to Stanley Cups in 1995 and 2000.&lt;ref name="Doomed"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefourthperiod.com/columnists/wyshynski061023.html|title=The Legion of Doomed|date=2006-10-23|accessdate=2007-07-26|author=Greg Wyshynski|publisher=The Fourth Period|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070623085212/http://www.thefourthperiod.com/columnists/wyshynski061023.html|archive-date=2007-06-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clarke received his harshest criticism after first round playoff exits, including a string of four in five years from 1998 to 2002,&lt;ref name="Resignation"/&gt; and several coaching changes. After [[Terry Murray]] was fired following the team's sweep in the 1997 Stanley Cup Finals (some suggested that Murray lost the players' respect by describing the 6-1 loss in game three as a "choking situation"[http://www.hockeynut.com/9798/playoffs.html]), five more coaching changes were made in the next five years. [[Wayne Cashman]], Murray's replacement, was replaced three-quarters of the way through the 1997–98, by [[Roger Neilson]] due to inconsistent team play. Some suggested Clarke's handling of Neilson, who took a medical leave in February 2000 to undergo cancer treatment and was replaced by [[Craig Ramsay]], was disrespectful. Clarke explained "The Neilson situation - Roger got cancer - that wasn't our fault. We didn't tell him to go get cancer. It's too bad that he did. We feel sorry for him, but then he went goofy on us."&lt;ref name="Goofy"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2000/12/22/neilson00.html|title=Clarke claims Neilson 'went goofy'|accessdate=2008-11-10|publisher=[[The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]| date=2000-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ramsay guided the team to the Eastern Conference Finals in 2000, but he was fired after a subpar start in 2000-01, being replaced by Clarke's former linemate [[Bill Barber]]. Barber was named coach of the year for 2000-01, however under his watch the Flyers suffered two consecutive first round eliminations, as their 2001 playoffs ended with an 8-0 defeat to Buffalo in Game Six, and their offense was held to just two goals by Ottawa during the 2002 playoffs, and this led to calls for Clarke's dismissal after he fired Barber. Clarke hired [[Ken Hitchcock]] as head coach for the 2002-03 season and Hitchcock remained until Clarke's resignation four years later, guiding the team to the 2004 conference finals.&lt;ref name="Resignation"/&gt;

Following the [[2004–05 NHL lockout]], Clarke signed 6'5" defencemen [[Derian Hatcher]] and [[Mike Rathje]] to four-year and five-year contracts respectively.&lt;ref name="Doomed"/&gt; While the moves were initially praised&lt;ref name="Doomed"/&gt; and even led some to label the Flyers Cup favorites in [[2005–06 NHL season|2005–06]],&lt;ref name="Doomed"/&gt; some suggested Clarke could not compete in the new NHL after the team was eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by Buffalo, a smaller, quicker team that proved to be effective against such slower defencemen as Hatcher and Rathje.&lt;ref name="Resignation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Doomed"/&gt; Such criticisms became louder after a poor start to the following season which led to his resignation.&lt;ref name="Resignation"/&gt;

====Eric Lindros====
Nothing was more controversial during Clarke's time as a general manager than his dispute with [[Eric Lindros]] and his parents, particularly his father Carl who was Eric's agent. The trouble started following the [[1997–98 NHL season|1997–98]] season while negotiating a new contract for Lindros. Clarke threatened to trade him, saying, "If you want to be the highest-paid player in the game or close to it, you've got to play that way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/classic/biography/s/Lindros_Eric.html|title=Great expectations haunt talented Lindros|publisher=ESPN|author=Bob Carter|date=2004-10-18|accessdate=2011-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Lindros was not traded and he played well during the [[1998–99 NHL season|1998–99]] season, his season was cut short after sustaining a collapsed lung during a game on April 1 against the [[Nashville Predators]].&lt;ref name="Lindros"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apse.dallasnews.com/contest/2000/writing/over250.news.first.html|title=How it all began|accessdate=2007-07-29|website=The Philadelphia Inquirer|author=Frank Fitzpatrick|year=2000|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070804140431/http://apse.dallasnews.com/contest/2000/writing/over250.news.first.html|archive-date=2007-08-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lindros' parents criticized team trainer John Worley and claimed Clarke tried to kill their son by trying to put him on a plane back to Philadelphia, which would have been fatal given his condition.&lt;ref name="Lindros"/&gt;

After Lindros criticized Worley in March 2000 for failing to diagnose a concussion&lt;ref name="Lindros"/&gt; (his second of the season),&lt;ref name="88timeline"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2000/11/30/lindros001129.html|title=Eric Lindros timeline|accessdate=2007-07-29|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation| date=2000-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clarke stripped Lindros of the role of team captain.&lt;ref name="Lindros"/&gt; A few weeks after suffering a third concussion during practice,&lt;ref name="88timeline"/&gt; Lindros returned to the Flyers lineup for Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals and sustained his fourth concussion of the season (his sixth in 27 months) during Game 7.&lt;ref name="88timeline"/&gt; Afterwards, Clarke said he did not dislike Eric, but he had a problem with his parents, saying, "If he's going to come back, he can't have his dad calling us and telling us who to trade for and who he wants to play with Eric and who can't play with Eric."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/news/2001/08/17/lindros_history/|title=Hockey - Eric Lindros' concussion history|work=Sports Illustrated|date=2001-08-17|accessdate=2011-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lindros never played for the Flyers again, as he rejected the Flyers qualifying offer in the off-season and sat out the [[2000–01 NHL season|2000–01]] season. Lindros pushed for a trade to Toronto but that move fell apart at last minute when Clarke and Leafs manager [[Pat Quinn (ice hockey)|Pat Quinn]] could not agree on terms. [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/nhl/features/si_stanley_cup/70s/#1974] Clarke finally traded Lindros to the New York Rangers in August 2001. Following the trade, Clarke said, "I don't give a crap whether he ever plays again or if I ever see him again. All he ever did was cause aggravation to our team."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://proicehockey.about.com/b/2006/10/22/bob-clarke-a-farewell-to-hockeys-king-of-quotes.htm|title=Bob Clarke: A Farewell to Hockey's King of Quotes|author=Jamie Fitzpatrick|publisher=About.com|date=2006-10-22|accessdate=2011-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon Lindros' retirement in November 2007, Clarke stated that Lindros belonged in the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]]. "Yes, based on his ability to play the game and based on his contributions as a player, I think you have to separate all the crap that went on. Particularly when he played for the Flyers, it was just outstanding, dominant hockey — the first of the huge, big men with small man's skill."&lt;ref name="LindrosHHOF"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/story/2007/11/08/nhl-clarke-lindros.html?ref=rss|title=Eric Lindros is a Hall of Famer: Clarke | publisher=[[CBC News]] | date=2007-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lindros and Clarke both played for the Philadelphia Flyers Alumni during the [[2012 NHL Winter Classic#Alumni game|2012 Winter Classic Alumni Game]] on December 31, 2011. The opposing team was the New York Rangers Alumni.&lt;ref name="Alumni"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sbnation.com/nhl/2011/12/31/2672430/winter-classic-alumni-game-eric-lindros-philadelphia-flyers-new-york-rangers|title=Winter Classic Alumni Game: 4 Reasons 2012 Edition Is Better Than Ever | publisher=sbnation | date=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both men acknowledged the game as an opportunity to mend fences.

&lt;blockquote&gt;''(T)his Alumni Game has provided an opportunity to rebuild ... once-burnt bridges. In recent years, Clarke has stated multiple times that he believes Lindros belongs in the Hall of Fame, and Lindros has acknowledged his many disagreements with Clarke and expressed a desire to move on.''&lt;ref name="Alumni"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Personal life==
Clarke and his family have been long-time residents of [[South Jersey]]. When first playing with the Flyers, Clarke lived in [[Cherry Hill, New Jersey]], later moving to [[Moorestown, New Jersey|Moorestown]] and then [[Haddonfield, New Jersey|Haddonfield]].&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Bob. [https://njmonthly.com/articles/jersey-living/good-neighbor-policy/ "Good Neighbor Policy; Canadian Bob Clarke was known as Bobby when he arrived as a rookie with the Philadelphia Flyers in 1969. Now the team's senior vice president calls Haddonfield home."], ''[[New Jersey Monthly]]'', November 15, 2000. Retrieved January 1, 2018. "The bars would close up and all the young kids decided to stop over. So we bought a house in Cherry Hill.... But we discovered we liked neighbors, so we sold that and bought a house in Moorestown. The kids, I have four, went to the Friends school there and then the public high school, where they played sports and all. We left for Minnesota and Florida when I had jobs there, then when we came back to the Flyers, we first went back to Moorestown and, after the kids were finished with school, to Haddonfield."&lt;/ref&gt;

Clarke and his wife, Sandy, have four children, sons Wade and Lucas  and daughters Jody and Jakki. They live in [[Ocean City, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hickey|first=Brian|url=http://citypaper.net/articles/2003-10-02/cover.shtml|title=The Ice Man: After all these years do we really know Bobby Clarke?|publisher=[[Philadelphia City Paper]]|date=October 2–8, 2003|accessdate=March 1, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031116085121/http://citypaper.net/articles/2003-10-02/cover.shtml#|archive-date=2003-11-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henry Zuckerman,''' credited as '''Buck Henry''' (born December 9, 1930), is an [[United States|American]] [[actor]], writer, [[film]] director, and [[television]] director. He has been nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] twice, in 1968 for Best Adapted Screenplay for ''[[The Graduate]]'' and in 1979 for Best Director for ''[[Heaven Can Wait (1978 film)|Heaven Can Wait]]''.

==Early life==
Henry was born to a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishtampa.com/jews-in-the-news/jews-in-the-news-carrie-fisher-norman-lear-stephen-tobolowsky Tampa Jewish Federation: "Jews in the News: Carrie Fisher, Norman Lear and Stephen Tobolowsky" ] retrieved March 18, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; in New York City, the son of silent film actress and star of the original ''[[Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1928 film)|Gentlemen Prefer Blondes]]'', [[Ruth Taylor (actress)|Ruth Taylor]] (January 13, 1905 – April 12, 1984) and Paul Steinberg Zuckerman (April 15, 1899 – 1965), a retired Air Force brigadier general and [[stockbroker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/29/Buck-Henry.html|title=Buck Henry Biography|publisher=Filmreference.com|date=|accessdate=September 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/sampler/article/0,8599,219497,00.html|title=That Old Feeling: Sweet Smells|publisher=TIME|date=March 21, 2002|accessdate=September 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[Displaying Abstract]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1965/12/04/archives/paul-s-zuckeriyian-broker-here-was-66.html|title=PAUL S. ZUCKERMAN, BROKER HERE, WAS 66 - Obituary - NYTimes.com|publisher=Select.nytimes.com|date=September 5, 2010|accessdate=September 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry attended [[Choate Rosemary Hall|The Choate School]] (now Choate Rosemary Hall) and [[Dartmouth College]], where he met [[Bob Rafelson]], and also worked on the ''[[Dartmouth Jack-O-Lantern]]'' humor magazine. From 1959 to 1962, as part of an elaborate hoax by comedian [[Alan Abel]], he pretended to be G. Clifford Prout, the quietly outraged president of the [[Society for Indecency to Naked Animals]], who presented his point of view on talk shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://priceonomics.com/the-hoaxster-who-revealed-sad-truths-about-america|title=The Hoaxster Who Revealed Sad Truths About America|first=Zachary|last=Crockett|website=Priceonomics|date=2016-03-16|accessdate=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television career==
Henry's dry humor attracted attention in the entertainment community. He became a cast member on [[television|TV]] programs such as ''[[Steve Allen|The New Steve Allen Show]]'' (1961) and  ''[[That Was The Week That Was]]'' (1964–65). He was a co-creator and writer for ''[[Get Smart]]'' (1965–70), with [[Mel Brooks]]. Two of his TV projects had short runs but are fondly remembered by fans: ''[[Captain Nice]]'' (1967) with [[William Daniels]] as a reluctant superhero, and ''[[Quark (TV series)|Quark]]'' (1978), with [[Richard Benjamin]] in command of a garbage scow in outer space.  He also played Dr. Victor Rudman, a fractal scientist who dated Murphy, on the "My Dinner With Einstein" episode (1989) of ''[[Murphy Brown]]''.

He appeared on the television show ''[[Will and Grace]]'' in 2005. In 2007, he made two guest appearances on ''[[The Daily Show]]'' as a contributor, billed as the show's "Senior Senior Correspondent". He has also appeared as [[Liz Lemon]]'s father, Dick Lemon, in the ''[[30 Rock]]'' episodes "[[Ludachristmas]]" (December 13, 2007) and "[[Gentleman's Intermission]]" (November 4, 2010). In 2011, he appeared in a multi-episode arc of ''[[Hot in Cleveland]]'' as Elka's groom.

==''Saturday Night Live''==
Henry hosted NBC's ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' 10 times between 1976 and 1980, making him the show’s most frequent host during its initial five year run, thus setting a record that held for nearly a decade. This figure does not include the show’s second-season Mardi Gras special, for which he was not in fact credited as host, but rather as one of several guest comedy and musical performers. Because he was featured more prominently than any of the other comedy performers who guested on the special episode (which was broadcast live from within the midst of Mardi Gras events in New Orleans), he is sometimes erroneously considered to have been the host of the program. (This role could be more accurately described as having been filled by musical performer [[Randy Newman]]).
It became a tradition during these years for Henry to host the final show of each season, beginning with the 1976-1977 season.
Henry's frequent host record would be broken when [[Steve Martin]] made his 11th appearance as host of the show on the finale episode of the 1988-1989 season.&lt;ref&gt;Alec Baldwin is now the most frequent male host in ''SNL'' history with 16 episodes from 1990 to 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; During the October 30, 1976, episode, Buck Henry was injured in the forehead by [[John Belushi]]'s [[katana]] in the [[Saturday Night Live Samurai|samurai]] sketch. Henry's head began to bleed and he was forced to wear a large bandage on his forehead for the rest of the show. As a gag, the members of the ''SNL'' cast each wore a bandage on their foreheads as well.

===Recurring characters on ''SNL''===
*Howard, a sadistic stunt coordinator
*Marshall DiLaMuca, father of Bill Murray's character Todd in [[The Nerds]] sketches
*Mr. Dantley, the straight man and frequent customer to Samurai Futaba's ([[John Belushi]]) many businesses.
*Uncle Roy, a single, [[pedophilic]] babysitter who disguises his attempts at molesting the children he is watching (played by [[Gilda Radner]] and [[Laraine Newman]]) as games.

===Celebrity impersonations on ''SNL''===
*[[Charles Lindbergh]]
*[[John Dean]]
*[[Ron Nessen]]

==Film and stage career==
Henry has appeared in more than 40 films including ''[[The Graduate]]'', ''[[Candy (1968 film)|Candy]]'', ''[[Catch-22 (film)|Catch-22]]'', ''[[Taking Off (film)|Taking Off]]'', ''[[The Man Who Fell to Earth (film)|The Man Who Fell to Earth]]'', ''[[Gloria (1980 film)|Gloria]]'', ''[[Eating Raoul]]'', ''[[Aria (film)|Aria]]'', ''[[Tune in Tomorrow]]'', ''[[Defending Your Life]]'', ''[[The Player (film)|The Player]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Henry's cameo in ''[[The Player (film)|The Player]]'' had him (playing himself) pitching a 20-years-later sequel to ''[[The Graduate]]'', which Henry later claimed led to real-life interest in such a project from some studios.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Short Cuts]]'', and ''[[Grumpy Old Men (film)|Grumpy Old Men]]''. He co-directed ''[[Heaven Can Wait (1978 film)|Heaven Can Wait]]'', the 1978 remake of ''[[Here Comes Mr. Jordan]]'', and appeared in the film as an officious angel, reprising the character originally played by [[Edward Everett Horton]].

His many writing credits include ''[[The Graduate]]'', ''[[Candy (1968 film)|Candy]]'', ''[[The Owl and the Pussycat (film)|The Owl and the Pussycat]]'', ''[[What's Up, Doc? (1972 film)|What's Up, Doc?]]'', ''[[Catch-22 (film)|Catch-22]]'', ''[[The Day of the Dolphin]]'', ''[[Protocol (film)|Protocol]]'', and ''[[To Die For]]''.

Henry shared an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nomination with [[Calder Willingham]] for their screenplay for ''[[The Graduate]]'' (1967). He received a second shared Oscar nomination, this time for Best Director of 1978’s ''[[Heaven Can Wait (1978 film)|Heaven Can Wait]]'', which he co-directed with the movie’s star [[Warren Beatty]]. In 1997, Henry was the recipient of the [[Austin Film Festival]]'s Distinguished Screenwriter Award.

His Broadway credits include the 2002 revival of ''[[Morning's at Seven]]''. Off-Broadway in July 2009, he starred opposite [[Holland Taylor]] in ''Mother'', a play by Lisa Ebersole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/129098-Buck+Henry+and+Holland+Taylor+Cast+in+Ebersole's+Mother|title=Buck Henry and Holland Taylor Cast in Lisa Ebersole's play, ''Mother''|publisher=Playbill.com|date=May 11, 2009|accessdate=September 21, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515024637/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/129098-Buck+Henry+and+Holland+Taylor+Cast+in+Ebersole's+Mother#|archive-date=May 15, 2009|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chandramukhi Basu''' ({{lang-bn|চন্দ্রমুখী বসু}}; 1860–1944), a [[Bengali Christian]] from [[Dehradun]], which was located in the (then known as) [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh]], was one of the first two female graduates of the [[British Empire]]. In 1882, along with [[Kadambini Ganguly]], she passed the examination of the bachelor's degree in arts from [[University of Calcutta]], India. Their formal degrees were handed during the convocation of the University in 1883.

==Early life==
The daughter of Bhuban Mohan Bose, she passed the First Arts examination from Dehradun Native Christian School in 1880.&lt;ref name = "Bose152"&gt;Sengupta, Subodh Chandra and Bose, Anjali (editors), 1976/1998, ''Sansad Bangali Charitabhidhan'' (Biographical dictionary) Vol I, {{Bn icon}}, p152, {{ISBN|81-85626-65-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time [[Bethune College|Bethune School]], to which shewanted to enter; did not admit non-Hindu girls, and as such she had to be admitted at the First Arts (F.A.) level in Reverend [[Alexander Duff (missionary)|Alexander Duff]]'s Free Church Institution (now the [[Scottish Church College]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishchurch.ac.in/College%20History02.pdf |title=Glimpses of college history |publisher=www.scottishchurch.ac.in|accessdate=2009-03-10|last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1876, because of the discriminatory official stances towards gender, she had to be given special permission to appear for the F.A. examination. As the only girl to appear for the examination that year, she had ranked first, but the university had to hold a series of meetings to decide whether her results could be published. Before Kadambini Ganguly, Chandramukhi Basu had already cleared her Entrance Examination in 1876, although the university refused to enlist her as a successful candidate. Only the university's changed resolution in 1878 allowed her to study further&lt;ref&gt;Manna, Mausumi, (2008) ''Women's Education through Co-Education: the Pioneering College'' in ''175th Year Commemoration Volume''.

==Career==
She started her career as a lecturer in Bethune College (it was still part of Bethune School) in 1886. The college was separated from the school in 1888.&lt;ref name = "Bose152"/&gt;  She became the principal, thus becoming the [[Firsts in India|first]] female head of an undergraduate academic establishment in South Asia.

She retired in 1891 because of bad health and spent the rest of her life in Dehradun.&lt;ref name = "Bose152"/&gt;

==Sisters==
Two of her sisters, Bidhumukhi and Bindubasini, were also renowned. Bidhumukhi Bose and Virginia Mary Mitra (Nandi), graduating in 1890, were among the earliest women medical graduates from Calcutta Medical College. Thereafter, Bindubasini Bose graduated from Calcutta Medical College in 1891.&lt;ref&gt;Bose, Anjali (editor),  ''Sansad Bangali Charitabhidhan'' (Biographical dictionary) Vol II, 1996/2004,{{Bn icon}}, p215, 219, {{ISBN|81-86806-99-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A native of Hawaii, he graduated from [[Harvard College]] and [[Harvard Law School]] before entering private practice in [[San Francisco]]. He served as a federal prosecutor for some years in California and then Hawaii, rising to become chief of the Civil Division of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Hawaii. Appointed to the federal bench in 2012 and 2013 by President [[Barack Obama]], he was unanimously confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] in 2013. Watson is the fourth [[Native Hawaiian]] federal judge in U.S. history, and the only one currently serving.

==Early life and education==
Derrick Kahala Watson was born in 1966, in [[Honolulu, Hawaii|Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]],&lt;ref name="Questionnaire"&gt;[https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Watson-Senate-Questionnaire-Public-Final-WD.pdf Nomination Questionnaire for Derrick K.

==Legal career and service in Army Reserves==
He began his career as an associate at the law firm of Landels, Ripley &amp; Diamond in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], [[California]], where he worked from 1991 to 1995.&lt;ref name=Whitehouse/&gt;  He served as an [[Assistant United States Attorney]] in the Northern District of California from 1995 to 2000, serving as Deputy Chief of the Civil Division from 1999 to 2000.&lt;ref name=Whitehouse/&gt; In 2000, Watson returned to private practice, joining the law firm of Farella Braun + Martel LLP, where he worked on [[product liability]], [[toxic tort]], and environmental cost recovery litigation.&lt;ref name=Whitehouse/&gt; Watson became a partner at the firm in 2003.&lt;ref name=Whitehouse/&gt; While in private practice, Watson conducted substantial pro bono work on behalf of the San Francisco Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights, he also did pro bono work involving [[human trafficking]] and wage and hour claims.&lt;ref name="Burns"/&gt; Watson served as an Assistant United States Attorney in the District of Hawaii from 2007 to 2013 and served as Chief of the Civil Division from 2009 to 2013.&lt;ref name=Whitehouse/&gt; From 1998 to 2006, Watson served in the [[United States Army Reserve]] in the [[Judge Advocate General's Corps, United States Army|Judge Advocate General's Corps]], with the rank of captain. He was honorably discharged.&lt;ref name="Questionnaire"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fjc.gov"/&gt;

==Federal judicial service==
On November 14, 2012, [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] nominated Watson to serve as a United States District Judge for the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii, to the seat vacated by Judge [[David Alan Ezra]], who took [[senior status]] on June 27, 2012.&lt;ref name=Whitehouse/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/pacific/news/2012/11/14/derrick-kahala-watson-picked-to-be.html Derrick Kahala Watson picked to be U.S. District Court judge], ''Pacific Business Journal'' (November 14, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; On January 2, 2013, his nomination was returned to the President, due to the ''[[sine die]]'' adjournment of the Senate. He was renominated to the same office the next day.&lt;ref name="WhiteHouseRenominates"&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/01/03/president-obama-re-nominates-thirty-three-federal-judgeships "President Obama Re-nominates Thirty-Three to Federal Judgeships], White House Office of the Press Secretary (January 3, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Watson was rated "well qualified" by a substantial majority of the [[American Bar Association]]'s [[Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/uncategorized/GAO/WebRatingChart.authcheckdam.pdf Ratings of Article III Judicial Nominees: 113th Congress]: [[American Bar Association]] [[Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary]].&lt;/ref&gt; Watson encountered no opposition in the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]], which reported his nomination to the Senate floor on February 14, 2013, by voice vote.&lt;ref name="WhiteHouseRenominates"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.staradvertiser.com/2013/02/14/breaking-news/senate-committee-approves-watson-appointment-to-u-s-district-court/ Senate committee approves Watson appointment to U.S. District Court], ''Honolulu Star-Advertiser'' (February 14, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Watson's appointment was confirmed by a vote of 94 ayes to 0 nays on April 18, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=113&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00106 Senate Roll Call: Question: On the Nomination (Confirmation Derrick Kahala Watson, of Hawaii, to be U.S. District Judge], [[Secretary of the United States Senate]].&lt;/ref&gt; He received his commission on April 23, 2013. Watson is the fourth [[Native Hawaiian]] to serve on the federal bench, and the only currently serving Native Hawaiian judge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency=[[Associated Press]] |url=http://www.staradvertiser.com/2017/03/15/breaking-news/native-hawaiian-federal-judge-halts-revised-travel-ban/ |title=Travel ban judge is only Native Hawaiian on federal bench |date=March 15, 2017 |accessdate=March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fjc.gov"/&gt;

==Travel ban case==

On March 15, 2017, Watson granted a temporary restraining order blocking President Trump's [[Executive Order 13780|revised executive order banning entry of nationals of six majority-Muslim countries]] into the United States from going into effect. Watson held that the order would violate the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]'s [[Establishment Clause]] in that "a reasonable, objective observer ... would conclude that the Executive Order was issued with a purpose to disfavor a particular religion." Watson justified his opinion by contending that because the intent of Trump's executive order disfavored foreign Muslims, it by extension disfavored domestic Muslims thus violating their First Amendment rights as well.&lt;ref&gt;[https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3518057/Order.pdf Order Granting Motion for Temporary Restraining Order], ''State of Hawaii v.  Trump'', CV. No. 17-00050 DKW-KSC (D. Haw. March 15, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dan Levine &amp; Mica Rosenberg, [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-court-idUSKBN16M17N Hawaii judge halts Trump's new travel ban before it can go into effect], Reuters (March 15, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Burns, [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/15/us/politics/trump-travel-ban.html 2 Federal Judges Rule Against Trump’s Latest Travel Ban], ''New York Times'' (March 15, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 29, Watson converted the temporary restraining order into a preliminary injunction.&lt;ref&gt;Michelle Broder Van Dyke, Chris Geidner &amp; Zoe Tillman, [https://www.buzzfeed.com/mbvd/hawaii-judge-travel-ban-order A Federal Judge Keeps Trump's Travel And Refugee Ban On Hold Indefinitely], "Buzzfeed News" (March 29, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; On June 12, 2017, the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] upheld the majority of the injunction, unanimously determining that Trump had "exceeded the scope of authority delegated to the president" under the [[Immigration and Nationality Act]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/12/politics/9th-circuit-ruling-travel-ban/index.html Hawaii v. Trump]'', 859 F.3d 741 (9th Cir. 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan Neuhauser, [https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2017-06-12/9th-circuit-largely-upholds-hawaii-judges-ruling-blocking-trumps-travel-ban 9th Circuit Upholds Block to Trump's Travel Ban], Associated Press (June 12, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Supreme Court]] granted Trump's request to hear the case, setting [[oral argument|arguments]] for October 2017; in the meantime, the Court partially reinstated Trump's executive order for a travel ban on June 26, 2017; the Court "prohibited the government from enforcing the ban against any 'foreign nationals who have a credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States,' but they allowed the government to enforce it against travelers who lack such a relationship."&lt;ref&gt;Amy Howe, [http://www.scotusblog.com/2017/07/dispute-travel-ban-return-supreme-court/ Dispute over travel ban could return to Supreme Court (UPDATED)], ''SCOTUSBlog'' (July 7, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the Trump administration excluded grandparents, aunts, uncles, and other relations from the exceptions to the travel ban, arguing that they were not "close" relatives. The State of Hawaii filed an emergency motion to clarify the scope of "close familial relationships" under the terms of the injunction and Supreme Court decision narrowing it, asking the district court to rule "that the federal government may not enforce the controversial bans against fiances, grandparents, grandchildren, brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews and cousins of people currently living in the United States."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Gonzales, [https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/06/29/534947770/hawaii-asks-federal-court-for-clarification-as-travel-ban-goes-into-effect Hawaii Asks Federal Court For Clarification As Travel Ban Goes Into Effect], NPR (June 29, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; On July 6, Watson denied the motion, writing that "[t]his Court will not upset the Supreme Court's careful balancing and equitable judgment" and that the State should seek guidance from the Supreme Court. State Attorney General [[Doug Chin]] described Watson's action as "procedural" rather than a decision on the merits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/35829846/federal-judge-turns-back-hawaiis-motion-on-trumps-travel-ban Federal judge turns back Hawaii's motion on Trump's travel ban], ''Hawaii News Now''/KHNL/KHMN (July 6, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the Ninth Circuit ruled that Watson "had the authority to interpret the Supreme Court's order and block any violation of it" and the issue returned to him. On July 13 Watson issued a ruling expanding the class of exemptions from the travel ban. He ordered that the definition of "close family members" be expanded to include grandparents, grandchildren, brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, and cousins in the United States. Watson also ruled that refugees who have a formal promise of placement from a U.S. [[refugee resettlement|resettlement]] agency are exempt from the ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/wireStory/judge-expands-list-relatives-exempted-travel-ban-48630036|title=Judge expands list of relatives exempted from travel ban|last=Kellelher|first=Jennifer Sinco|date=July 14, 2017|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, [[U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Rex Tillerson]] sent out a [[diplomatic cable]] to all U.S. diplomatic posts reflecting Watson's ruling; the cable "reversed the State Department's previous, narrow definition of close family and stated that 'grandparents, grandchildren, brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, aunts and uncles, nephews and nieces, and cousins' are eligible for visas."&lt;ref&gt;Arshad Mohammed &amp; Yeganeh Torbati, [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-travelban-idUSKBN1A2248 Grandmas, grandpas from travel ban states now welcome -U.S. cable], Reuters (July 17, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 17, 2017, Watson again issued a temporary restraining order preventing a later revision of Trump's travel ban from going into effect.  In his decision, Watson prevented the blocking of citizens of Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, and Chad from traveling to the United States, while leaving intact the restrictions for North Korean citizens and some Venezuelan officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-41659724|title=Trump's latest travel ban order blocked|date=October 17, 2017|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=17 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that the revised ban “suffers from precisely the same maladies as its predecessor”.&lt;ref name="veconomist" &gt;{{cite news|author=S.M.|title=Donald Trump’s latest travel ban is blocked by two federal judges|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2017/10/d-j-vu-all-over-again|work=[[The Economist]]|date=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 26, 2018, in ''[[Trump v. Hawaii]]'' the Supreme Court reversed this decision in a 5–4 decision, ruling that plaintiffs did not have a "likelihood of success on the merits" on either their INA or their Establishment Clause claims. The court vacated the injunction and remanded the case to lower courts for further proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/supreme-court-upholds-trump-travel-ban/2018/06/26/b79cb09a-7943-11e8-80be-6d32e182a3bc_story.html |title=Supreme Court upholds Trump travel ban |last=Barnes |first=Robert |last2=Marimow |first2=Ann E. |publisher=[[The Washington Post]] |language=en |access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/26/us/politics/supreme-court-trump-travel-ban.html |title=Trump’s Travel Ban Is Upheld by Supreme Court |last=Liptak |first=Adam |last2=Shear |first2=Michael D. |date=June 26, 2018 |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |language=en |access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Qur'anic]] account of the [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] ({{lang-ar|الحواريون}} ''al-ḥawāriyyūn'') of [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]]  does not include their names, numbers, or any detailed accounts of their lives. Muslim [[exegesis]], however, more-or-less agrees with the [[New Testament]] list and says that the disciples included [[Peter in Islam|Peter]], [[Philip the Apostle|Philip]], [[Thomas the Apostle|Thomas]], [[Bartholomew the Apostle|Bartholomew]], [[Matthew the Apostle|Matthew]], [[Andrew the Apostle|Andrew]], [[James, son of Zebedee|James]], [[Jude the Apostle|Jude]], [[John the Apostle|John]] and [[Simon the Zealot]].&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, ''A-Z of Prophets in Islam and Judaism'', ''Disciples of Jesus'', pg. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars generally draw a parallel with the disciples of Jesus and the [[Sahabah|disciples of]] [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]], who followed Muhammad during his lifetime, 600 years later.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, ''A-Z of Prophets in Islam and Judaism'', ''Disciples of Jesus'', pg. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

==Textual references==
{{quotefarm|date=March 2015}}
===In the Qur'an===
{{Islam}}
The following is a list of all the Qur'anic references to the disciples of Jesus:

{{quote|"'(I, Jesus, have come to you Children of Israel), to attest the Law which was before me. And to make lawful to you part of what was (Before) forbidden to you; I have come to you with a Sign from your Lord. So fear God, and obey me.&lt;br&gt;"'It is God who is my Lord and your Lord; then worship Him. This is a way that is straight.'"&lt;br&gt;When Jesus found unbelief on their part He said: "Who will be my helpers to (the work of) God?" ['''[[Ansar (Islam)|anṣār]] 'ilā [[Allah|llāh]]''] Said the disciples: "We are God's helpers [''anṣāru llāhi'']: We believe in God, and do thou bear witness that we are [[Š-L-M#Arabic_Isl.C4.81m|Muslims]] [''wa-ishhad bi-'anna muslimuna''].&lt;br&gt;"Our {{LORD}}! we believe in what Thou hast revealed, and we follow the Messenger (Jesus); then write us down among those who bear witness."|[[Sura 3]]:49&amp;ndash;53&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|49|e=53|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|"And behold! I inspired the disciples to have faith in Me and Mine Messenger: they said, 'We have faith, and do thou bear witness that we bow to God as Muslims'".&lt;br&gt;Behold! the disciples, said: "O Jesus the son of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]]! can thy Lord send down to us  a table set (with viands) from heaven?" Said Jesus: "Fear God, if ye have faith."&lt;br&gt;They said: "We only wish to eat thereof and satisfy our hearts, and to know that thou hast indeed told us the truth; and that we ourselves may be witnesses to the miracle."&lt;br&gt;Said Jesus the son of Mary: "O God our Lord! Send us from heaven a table set (with viands), that there may be for us - for the first and the last of us - a solemn festival and a sign from thee; and provide for our sustenance, for thou art the best Sustainer (of our needs)."&lt;br&gt;God said: "I will send it down unto you: But if any of you after that resisteth faith, I will punish him with a penalty such as I have not inflicted on any one among all the peoples."|[[Sura 5]]:111&amp;ndash;115&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|5|111|e=115|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote| O ye who believe! Be ye helpers of God: As said Jesus the son of Mary to the Disciples, "Who will be my helpers to (the work of) God?" Said the disciples, "We are God's helpers!" then a portion of the [[Children of Israel]] believed, and a portion disbelieved: but We gave power to those who believed, against their enemies, and they became the ones that prevailed.|[[Sura 61]]:14&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|61|14|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===In Hadith===
The following are [[Hadith]] (narrations originating from the words of [[Muhammad]]), collected by [[Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj Nishapuri]], which indirectly emphasize [[Islamic theology|Islamic beliefs]] concerning the disciples of Jesus:&lt;ref&gt;''The Book of Faith (Kitab Al-Iman)'' Book 1, Chapter 21, ''Concerning the Facts That Interdiction Against Abominable is a Part of Faith, That Faith Increases and Diminishes; Enjoining That Which is Good and Forbidding That Which is Abominable Are Obligatory (Acts)''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|It is narrated on the authority [[Abd Allah ibn Mas'ud|'Abdullah b. Mas'ud]] that the Messenger of God observed: Never a [[Prophet]] had been sent before me by God towards his nation who had not among his people (his) disciples and companions who followed his ways and obeyed his command. Then there came after them their successors who said whatever they did not practise, and practised whatever they were not commanded to do. He who strove against them with his hand was a believer: he who strove against them with his tongue was a believer, and he who strove against them with his heart was a believer and beyond that there is no faith even to the extent of a [[mustard seed]]. Abu Rafi' said: I narrated this hadith to [[`Abd Allah ibn `Umar|'Abdullah b. 'Umar]]; he contradicted me. There happened to come 'Abdullah b. Mas'ud who stayed at Qanat, and 'Abdullah b 'Umar wanted me to accompany him for visiting him (as 'Abdullah b. Mas'ud was ailing), so I went along with him and as we sat (before him) I asked Ibn Mas'ud about this hadith. He narrated it in the same way as I narrated it to Ibn 'Umar.

The same hadith has been transmitted by another [[Hadith terminology|chain of narrators]] on the authority of 'Abdullah b. Mas'ud who observed: Never was there one among the prophets who had had not disciples who followed his direction and followed his ways. The remaining part of the hadith is like that as narrated by [[Saleh|Salih]] but the arrival of Ibn Mas'ud and the meeting of Ibn 'Umar with him is not mentioned.|''[[Sahih Muslim]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|1|81}}, {{Hadith-usc|muslim|1|82}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Florence Terry Griswold''' (May 28, 1875–July 7, 1941) was an American cattlewoman and rancher from Texas. She was the first woman delegate of the Texas Cattle Raisers Association to attend the Trans-Mississippi Convention and for several years, the only woman delegate. A staunch supporter of women's equality, she worked as a [[suffragist]], served as a Republican National Convention Delegate for many years and later fought for equal pay for women. She is most known as the founder of the Pan-American Round Tables in 1916, which has grown from a single club begun in San Antonio, Texas to an international [[NGO]] with over 1400 branches. 

==Early life==
Florence T. Terry was born on May 28, 1875, on ''La Pendencia'', a ranch located between [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]] and [[Carrizo Springs, Texas]]{{sfn|''The Del Rio News Herald''|1990|p=4}} to Louisa James (née Lamkin) and Judge William Theodore Terry.{{sfn|Allen|2016}}{{sfn|Texas State Registrar|1941|p=195}} Terry's grandfather, Constant Terry, was a prominent settler in south Texas and had urged his son, who had earned a law degree in New York to move west. The young couple settled on the ranch and Theodore worked in nearby Eagle Pass as a lawyer. He became one of the first [[federal judge]]s in Southwest Texas and built his ranch to an extensive size. Louisa and Theodore had four children: Annie Louise, Alice, William Nathaniel and Florence, the youngest child. From an early age, she was bilingual.{{sfn|Marchbanks|1983|pp=5-11}}

On September 5, 1894, in Carrizo Springs, she married Felix Motlow Shaw, a rancher and cattleman.{{sfn|Allen|2016}}{{sfn|Texas Marriages|1894|p=68}} Felix was well known among fellow ranchers having been one of the two ranchers, who introduced [[shorthorn]] bulls to the area.{{sfn|Marchbanks|1983|pp=5-11}} Subsequently, the couple had four children: Ruth, Adele, Hazel and Felix Jr. Initially they made their home in [[Webb County, Texas]].{{sfn|''The San Antonio Gazette''|1908|p=10}}{{sfn|U. S. Census|1900|p=4A}}{{sfn|U. S. Census|1910|p=5A}} Later, they maintained a home in San Antonio at 323 Woodlawn Avenue as well as maintaining their ranch in Dimmit County.{{sfn|Allen|2016}} On July 10, 1908, Shaw's husband Felix became overheated and had a [[Heat stroke|stroke]], when working on his ranch. He was transported via train to [[Uvalde, Texas|Uvalde]] and then driven by car to his home in San Antonio. He died a week later on 18 July, 1908, leaving the widow and her four children his estate.{{sfn|Allen|2016}}

==Career==
Upon Felix's death, Shaw took over his business and operated as a [[Cowman (profession)|cattlewoman]] and [[rancher]].{{sfn|Allen|2016}}{{sfn|U. S. Census|1910|p=5A}} Because the life insurance company refused to pay, Shaw sued and was successful in her claim.{{sfn|Allen|2016}}{{sfn|''The San Antonio Light''|1908|p=5}} Managing the ranch, she doubled the holdings her husband had left her and by 1910, had over 100,000 acres with 5,000 head of cattle on her ranches in [[Webb County, Texas|Webb]] and Dimmit counties. She also managed a 500 acre farm in Dimmit county.{{sfn|''The San Antonio Light and Gazette''|1910|p=10}} Shaw was one of the 1909 delegates, and the only woman sent by the Texas Cattle Raisers Association to the 1909 Trans-Mississippi Convention in [[Denver]].{{sfn|''The Corsicana Daily Sun''|1909|p=1}} On 29 September 1910 at her home, Shaw married her second husband Spencer Patterson Brundage, a real estate partner in the firm of Hust and Brundage.{{sfn|Allen|2016}}{{sfn|Texas Marriages|1910|p=394}}{{sfn|''The Galveston Daily News''|1910|p=26}}{{#tag:ref|Allen's newspaper account shows the marriage took place on September 29, 1910,{{sfn|Allen|2016}} but the record shows that was the date the license was issued. The date of the marriage on the license shows September 20th, which precedes the license date. Recordation was October 1, 1910.{{sfn|Texas Marriages|1910|p=394}} A newspaper article from ''[[The Daily News (Texas)|The Galveston Daily News]]'' shows the couple were married on Thursday evening, confirming the date of September 29th.{{sfn|''The Galveston Daily News''|1910|p=26}}|group="Notes"}} The couple immediately left for an extended month long holiday in the east,{{sfn|''The Galveston Daily News''|1910|p=26}} but were back in Texas in time for her to attend the Trans-Mississippi Convention, where once again, she was the only woman delegate.{{sfn|''The San Antonio Light and Gazette''|1910|p=10}}

After her second marriage, Brundage became more socially active, joining such organizations as the Reading Club and the San Antonio Woman's and Symphony Society. Her husband became vice president of the International Club, to promote the city and provide hospitality to tourists from Mexico.{{sfn|Allen|2016}} She also joined the [[women's suffrage]] movement, attending the State Convention for Equal Franchise in 1913, serving as the corresponding secretary for the San Antonio Equal Suffrage Society, and visiting with Congressmen throughout the state.{{sfn|''The San Antonio Light''|March 16, 1913|p=9}}{{sfn|''The Houston Post''|1914|p=6}} By the end of 1913, the couple had divorced and Brundage resumed use of the name of Shaw.{{sfn|Allen|2016}}{{sfn|''The San Antonio Light''|November 23, 1913|p=18}} She married her third husband John Case Griswold, a real estate clerk at A. C. Dauchy Company, on June 8, 1914 and the two settled into her San Antonio home. Her marriage did not stop her campaign for women's rights, as she became a "frequent, featured speaker" on behalf of enfranchisement. She also began to hold informal meetings of women to improve international relationships with Latin American women.{{sfn|Allen|2016}}

With the end of the [[Mexican Revolution]] and the influx of women and children refugees, to whom she opened her home, Griswold formalized the international meetings. Believing that businessmen and politicians pursued self-serving interests, she was convinced that women could help create bridges by familiarizing themselves with other cultures and building networks. To that end, she called together a group of friends at the [[Menger Hotel]] on October 16, 1916 to create the [[Pan American Round Table]], for which she served as first Director General.{{sfn|Frantz|2010}} As the organization expanded to several branches in Texas, Griswold established the Pan American Round Tables of Texas in 1922 and became the first Director General of the state organization.{{sfn|Trotter|1967}} 

In 1924, Griswold was elected as Republican National Commiteewoman for Texas and served for eight years,{{sfn|''The Laredo Times''|1932|p=6}} striving to improve the rights for women. She was particularly in favor of pay equality for men and women performing equal work, as well as unpaid labor for domestic service being included as an essential part of the economy.{{sfn|''The San Antonio Light''|1930|p=2}} She remained politically active in the national [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] events and served as a chair for the election campaign of [[Wendell Willkie]].{{sfn|''The Laredo Times''|1936|p=2}}{{sfn|''The San Antonio Express''|1940|p=11}}

==Death and legacy==
Griswold died on July 7, 1941 in San Antonio, Texas.{{sfn|''The Brownsville Herald''|1941|p=16}} The Pan American Round Tables has grown into an international organization with over 1400 branches located in each country of the [[Western Hemisphere]].{{sfn|Rosales| 2006|p=340}} In 2016, the organization celebrated its centennial with a convention honoring its founder.{{sfn|Allen|2016}}{{sfn|Valenzuela|2016}} The Florence Terry Griswold Scholarship is awarded annually by the Alliance of Pan American Round Tables to allow Latin American students to study in the United States.{{sfn|Trotter|1967}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13556">'''Fulcanelli''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 1920s) was the name used by a [[France|French]] [[alchemy|alchemist]] and [[esoteric]] author, whose identity is still debated.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Riviere ''Fulcanelli'', p. 29, Red Pill Press Ltd, 2006 {{ISBN|978-1-897244-21-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name Fulcanelli seems to be a play on words: Vulcan, the ancient Roman god of fire, plus [[El (deity)|El]], a Canaanite name for God and so the [[Sacred fire of Vesta|Sacred Fire]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Stavish ''The Path of Alchemy'', p. 171, Llewellyn Worldwide, 2006 {{ISBN|978-0-7387-0903-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The appeal of Fulcanelli as a cultural phenomenon is due partly to the mystery of most aspects of his life and works; one of the anecdotes pertaining to his life retells, in particular, how his most devoted pupil [[Eugène Canseliet]] performed a successful [[Alchemy|transmutation]] of 100&amp;nbsp;grams of [[lead]] into [[gold]] in a laboratory of the gas works of Sarcelles at the Georgi company with the use of a small quantity of the "[[Projection (alchemy)|Projection Powder]]" given to him by his teacher, in the presence of Julien Champagne and Gaston Sauvage.

== Life ==
[[File:Frontispice du Mystère des cathédrales.jpg|thumb|Frontispice of ''Le Mystère des Cathédrales'' by Fulcanelli (1926). Illustration by Julien Champagne.]]

Fulcanelli was likely a Frenchman educated in the ways of alchemical lore, architecture, art, science and languages. Fulcanelli wrote two books that were published after his disappearance in 1926, having left his [[masterpiece|magnum opus]], ''Le Mystère des Cathédrales'', with his only student, [[Eugène Canseliet]]. Its first edition consisted of 300 copies and was published by Jean Schemit at 52 Rue Laffitte, [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Riviere ''Fulcanelli'', p.31&lt;/ref&gt;

Theories about Fulcanelli speculate that he was one or another famous French occultist of the time: perhaps a member of the former Royal Family (the [[Valois Dynasty|Valois]]), or another member of the ''Frères d'Heliopolis'' (''Brothers of Heliopolis'', a society centred around Fulcanelli which included [[Eugène Canseliet]], Jean-Julien Champagne, and Jules Boucher). Patrick Rivière, a student of Canseliet's, believed that Fulcanelli's true identity was [[Jules Violle]], a famous French physicist.&lt;ref&gt;Rivière, Patrick. ''Fulcanelli''. Red Pill Press {{ISBN|1-897244-21-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1996 book, samples of writing by Jean-Julien Hubert Champagne (born January 23, 1877) and Fulcanelli are compared, and show considerable similarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archerjulienchampagne.com/article-2006821.html|title=DEDICACES DE JULIEN CHAMPAGNE - JULIEN CHAMPAGNE|author=ARCHER|work=JULIEN CHAMPAGNE}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any event, by 1916, Fulcanelli had accepted Canseliet, who was then only sixteen, as his first student. During 1921, he accepted the sons of [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]] as students and in 1922 two more students: Jules Boucher and Gaston Sauvage. In 1925, Fulcanelli relocated to 59 rue Rochechouart where he allegedly succeeded in transmuting [[base metals]] into gold.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis William Hauck ''Sorcerer's Stone'', p. 172, Citadel Press, 2004 {{ISBN|978-0-8065-2545-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, with the publication of the international bestseller ''[[The Morning of the Magicians]]'', Pauwels and Bergier popularized the mystery of the Master Alchemist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Weidner |first1=Jay |last2=Bridges |first2=Vincent |title=The Mysteries of the Great Cross of Hendaye |page=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fulcanelli's Master===
Without neglecting the belief of some researchers that Canseliet himself could have been Fulcanelli, Canseliet himself believed Fulcanelli's Master was [[Basil Valentine]], an alchemist of the 15th century; the theoretical Master at least, for Fulcanelli's initiator may have been his own wife. As Fulcanelli describes in a strange letter he kept as a talisman about the completion of the Great Work - by someone who is presumably Basil Valentine - he also mentions his own wife: "...When my wife told me the good news" and "...my wife, with the inexplicable intuition of sensitives, had a really strange dream." As shown by this letter, when referring to something as important as the [[Great Work]], he mentions his wife as someone important to the [[Great Work|Magnum Opus]].&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Riviere ''Fulcanelli'', p. 47, Red Pill Press, 2006 {{ISBN|978-1-897244-21-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samael Aun Weor ''The Perfect Matrimony'', ch. I, Glorian Publishing, 2008 {{ISBN|978-1-934206-03-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conclusion===
According to Louis Pauwels, Fulcanelli survived [[World War II]] and disappeared completely after the [[Liberation of Paris]]. Every attempt to find him failed. In August 1945, American G-2 ([[Military Intelligence Corps (United States Army)|Army Intelligence]]) asked [[Jacques Bergier]] to contact a certain Army major who was in charge of the operation of searching for German research reports on atomic energy. The major, whose identity was apparently anonymous, or simply forgotten, wanted to know the whereabouts of Fulcanelli. Bergier could not say and the army major seemed satisfied Fulcanelli could not be found.&lt;ref&gt;''Alchemy, the Ancient Science'', ibid. p.53&lt;/ref&gt;

== Meeting in Paris with Jacques Bergier ==
Walter Lang reports that Fulcanelli communicated with [[Jacques Bergier]] to warn French atomic physicist André Helbronner of man's impending use of nuclear weapons. According to Fulcanelli, nuclear weapons had been used before, by and against humanity. Prof. Helbronner and [[Constant Chevillon|Chevillon]], among others, were assassinated by the [[Gestapo]] towards the end of [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Fulcanelly ''Le Mystère des Cathédrales'', p. 29, Neville Spearman Ltd, London, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

The meeting between Jacques Bergier and Fulcanelli reportedly occurred during June 1937 in a laboratory of the Gas Board in Paris. According to Neil Powell, the following is a translation of the original verbatim transcript of the rendezvous:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"You're on the brink of success, as indeed are several others of our scientists today. Please, allow me. Be very very careful. I warn you... The liberation of [[nuclear power]] is easier than you think and the [[radioactivity]] artificially produced can poison the atmosphere of our planet in a very short time: a few years. Moreover, atomic explosives can be produced from a few grains of metal powerful enough to destroy whole cities. I'm telling you this for a fact: the alchemists have known it for a very long time...

I shall not attempt to prove to you what I'm now going to say but I ask you to repeat it to Mr. Helbronner: certain geometrical arrangements of highly purified materials are enough to release atomic forces without having recourse to either electricity or vacuum techniques... The secret of alchemy is this: there is a way of manipulating matter and energy so as to produce what modern scientists call '[[field (physics)|a field of force]]'. The field acts on the observer and puts him in a privileged position vis-à-vis the universe. From this position he has access to the realities which are ordinarily hidden from us by time and space, matter and energy. This is what we call [[The Great Work#In alchemy|the Great Work]]." &lt;ref&gt;Powell, Neil ''Alchemy, the Ancient Science'', p. 53, Aldus Books Ltd, London, 1976 SBN 490 00346 X&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When Bergier asked Fulcanelli about the Philosopher's Stone, the alchemist answered: "...the vital thing is not the transmutation of metals but that of the experimenter himself. It is an ancient secret that a few people rediscover each century. Unfortunately, only a handful are successful..."&lt;ref&gt;Dennis W. Hauck ''Sorcerer's Stone'', p. 174, Citadel Press, 2004 {{ISBN|978-0-8065-2545-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1938, the German chemists [[Otto Hahn]] and [[Fritz Strassmann]] sent a manuscript to ''[[Naturwissenschaften]]'' reporting they had detected the element [[barium]] after bombarding [[uranium]] with [[neutron]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Natturwissenschaften, v. 27, # 1, pp. 11–15, 1939&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lise Meitner]] and her nephew [[Otto Robert Frisch]] correctly interpreted these results as being [[nuclear fission]].&lt;ref&gt;''Nature'', v. 143, #3615, pp. 239–240, Feb. 11, 1939&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/physics/looking-back/meitner/index.html|title=nature physics portal - looking back - Breaking up is easy -- nuclear fission discovered|work=nature.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rendezvous in Spain ==
According to Canseliet, his last encounter with Fulcanelli happened in 1953 (years after his disappearance), when he went to [[Spain]] and there was taken to a castle high in the mountains for a rendez-vous with his former master. Canseliet had known Fulcanelli as an old man in his 80s but now the Master had grown younger and had physically changed in appearance: he was now an androgynous creature, a being Fulcanelli called The Divine Androgyne. The reunion was brief and Fulcanelli once again disappeared not leaving any trace of his whereabouts.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Harpur ''Mercurius'', p. 336, Blue Angel Gallery, 2007 {{ISBN|978-0-9802865-8-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Phonetic Cabala ==
According to Fulcanelli, the Phonetic Cabala (Fulcanelli's term for a special use of language, drawing on phonetic similarities and other symbolic techniques for expanding the expressive reach of words)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://glossary.cassiopaea.com/glossary.php?id=167|title=Cassiopaea Glossary|author=dxf|work=cassiopaea.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; is not the Hebrew [[Kabbalah]]; even the derivation is different: Cabala is derived from the Latin ''caballus'', a horse, as in the Horse of Troy in the [[Iliad]]. It is basically [[homophonic]] and [[symphonic]] rather than numerical; it is based on [[phonetic]] [[assonance]] and [[resonance]] to echo the [[Gay Science]] in the words of the [[Greece|Hellenic]] [[gods]] spoken in sacred [[Ancient Greek]] nomenclature.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Riviere ''Fulcanelli'', p. 42, Red Pill Press Ltd., 2006 {{ISBN|978-1-897244-21-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Walter Lang, who wrote an introduction to the English translation of Fulcanelli's ''Le Mystère des Cathédrales'', the basic principles of the Phonetic Cabala are restored in Fulcanelli's ''Magnum Opus''.&lt;ref&gt;Fulcanelli ''Le Mystère des Cathédrales'', Neville Spearman, London, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

== Works ==
The two books by Fulcanelli are
*''Le Mystère des Cathédrales'' (''The Mystery of the Cathedrals''), written in 1922 and published in [[Paris]] in 1926.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book |last=Riviere |first=Patrick |title=Fulcanelli: His True Identity Revealed |page=95 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l2q-Xt1cgLsC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;lpg=PA95&amp;dq=Le+Mystere+des+Cathedrales+1926+1929&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3iwoSo1KAL&amp;sig=g-jXxcqbNJARQliafw_EJQBXIRY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ct=result#PPA95,M1  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Les Demeures Philosophales'' (''Dwellings of the Philosophers''), published in Paris in 1929.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
The books are written in a cryptic and erudite manner, replete with [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] puns, alchemical symbolism, [[double entendre]]s, and lectures on and in [[Argot]] and [[Cant (language)|Cant]], all of which serve to keep casual readers ignorant.

A third book, ''Finis Gloriae Mundi'' (''End of the World's Glory''),&lt;ref&gt;Fulcanelli ''Finis Gloriae Mundi'', 125 pages, Obelisco, 2004 {{ISBN|84-7720-937-5}} (Spanish ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; was also reportedly being prepared for publication. The notes for the book were left for a time with his only student, Canseliet. Fulcanelli decided that the timing for publication of the book was not right and so it was never in fact published. A book by the same name, citing Fulcanelli as the author, was published much later, but has been shown to be a counterfeit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alchymie.net/english_version/critiques/fulcanelli_uk.htm Fulcanelli revealed, p. 8: Finis Gloriae Mundi] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050906035635/http://www.alchymie.net/english_version/critiques/fulcanelli_uk.htm |date=September 6, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr '''Geoffrey Keith Charles Pardoe''' OBE [[FREng]] [[FRAeS]] FBIS (2 November 1928 &amp;ndash; 3 January 1996) was the [[project manager]] for the [[Blue Streak (missile)|Blue Streak]] [[ballistic missile]] programme. He was also an advocate for [[Science and technology in the United Kingdom|British advanced science and technology]], and involvement in space exploration, deploring (repeated) government negligence and its aborted technology programmes.

He attended [[Wanstead High School|Wanstead County High School]], a co-educational [[grammar school]] in [[Wanstead]], east London. He attended and gained a [[Bachelor of Science|BScEng]] from Loughborough of College of Technology (the college's degree was awarded by the University of London). He later gained a PhD in Astronautics from [[Loughborough University]] in 1984.

==Career==
From 1949-1951 he was senior aerodynamicist at [[Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft]], then part of [[Hawker Siddeley]]. He worked on rocket design and the [[Sea Slug (missile)]] (Britain's first guided missile). From 1951-19566 he was chief aerodynamicist at the Guided Weapons division of [[de Havilland Propellers]], working on the [[De Havilland Firestreak]]. He worked on aerodynamics and flight analysis.

De Havilland was given the Blue Streak ballistic missile project, and he was the project manager from 1956-60. In 1959 he proposed a scheme known as [[Black Prince (rocket)|Black Prince]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britain-in-space.co.uk/1950/blackprince.html Black Prince 1959] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318141852/http://www.britain-in-space.co.uk/1950/blackprince.html |date=18 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereby a Blue Streak would be the main first stage, with the second stage a [[Black Knight (rocket)|Black Knight]], with a third stage a military solid rocket on top. It was also considered to have a [[Black Arrow]] as the second stage or third stage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1988/mar/30/space-policy-1 Space Policy - House of Lords March 1988]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1978/1978%20-%201252.html FlightGlobal 1978]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 April 1960 the Blue Streak project was abruptly cancelled. He argued in September 1959 that the space vehicle could be transformed into the first stage of a European rocket launcher. He spoke fluent French and German. He found it difficult to forgive the British government when it withdrew from the [[European Launcher Development Organisation]] (ELDO) in 1968, with funding finishing in 1971. The government was paying £9 million a year to ELDO, which he argued was less than a few miles of motorway, and that leaving ELDO would ''keep Britain out of spaceflight forever'', which was largely later proved correct (although work on satellites would continue). The French government would later massively support the [[Ariane (rocket family)|Ariane project]]. By 1988 Ariane had around £2 billion worth of orders for flights. The earlier British rocket project was later referred to as the ''ill-fated'' Blue Streak, but it was only ''ill fated'' at the administrative level, not the technical.

De Havilland merged with Hawker Siddeley in 1960, and he was the chief engineer of [[Hawker Siddeley Dynamics]] Weapons and Space Research division from 1960 to 1963. From 1963 to 1969 he was chief project engineer of the company's Space Division. He was managing director from 1985 to 1987 and deputy chairman from 1987 to 1993 of [[Surrey Satellite Technology]].

From 1993 until his death in 1996, he was director of the [[International Academy of Science]]. In 1986 he became chairman of the [[Watt Committee on Energy]]. From 1984 to 1985 he was president of the [[Royal Aeronautical Society]]. The RAeS has honoured him with the [[Geoffrey Pardoe Space Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

===British Space Development Company===
In 1960 the [[British Space Development Company]], a consortium of thirteen large industrial companies was set up, to plan the world's first commercial communication satellite company, by [[Robert Renwick, 1st Baron Renwick]]. He became the Executive Director. With Blue Streak, Britain had the technology to make it possible.

The idea was flatly turned down by the British government on the grounds that such a system could not be envisaged in the next 20 years (1961–81). America then set up [[COMSAT]] in 1963, resulting in [[Intelsat]], the world's largest fleet (52) of commercial satellites. The first of Intelsat's fleet, [[Intelsat I]] (''Early Bird'') was launched in April 1965. Intelsat has been very commercially successful.

Private finance would have been available for the project, but the project was scuppered by not receiving government approval. Later in the mid-1980s he campaigned for a British space agency, as Britain was the only main Western country not to have one, even though the Chairman of the European Space Agency, from 1984-7, was Britain's Dr (later Professor) [[Harry Atkinson (scientist)|Harry Atkinson]]. The [[British National Space Centre|BNSC]] was formed in 1985.

===General Technology Systems===
He founded the consultancy General Technology Systems in [[Brentford]] in 1973, with a colleague from the Blue Streak project, Bill Stephens. It was later based at the [[Brunel Science Park]] at [[Brunel University]] in 1988. In the late 1980s GTS was developing an 80-foot satellite launcher called [[LittLEO]], to carry 700&amp;nbsp;kg payloads into orbit from the [[Andøya Rocket Range]] launch site in [[Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3_8Muqj445oC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;dq=%22general+technology+systems%22+pardoe&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PwP4adjSjZ&amp;sig=toPr81-knp1GYzHpNw4XKOLLnkg&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22general%20technology%20systems%22%20pardoe&amp;f=false New Scientist article]&lt;/ref&gt; The cost would be around £10,000 per kg. The company LittLEO Ltd was established. A first launch was planned for 1992. It would have been multi-staged with a solid fuel propellant.

===Broadcasting===
During the [[Apollo 11]] mission to the Moon in 1969, he was part of the television commentary team with [[Reg Turnill]]. He was chosen for this role as he was a good communicator.

==Personal life==
He married Patricia Gutteridge in 1953. They had a son and a daughter. He died of a heart attack aged 67 on a business visit to attend meetings at the International Academy of Science in Kansas City, Missouri.

He was made OBE in 1988, a Fellow of the [[Royal Aeronautical Society]] in 1968, and of the [[Royal Academy of Engineering]] in 1988.

'''Grace White Sherwood''' (1660–1740), called the '''Witch of Pungo''', is the last person known to have been convicted of [[witchcraft]] in [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]]. A farmer, healer, and midwife, she was accused by her neighbors of  [[shapeshifting|transforming herself]] into a cat, damaging crops, and causing the death of livestock. She was charged with witchcraft several times; at her trial in 1706, Sherwood was accused of bewitching her neighbor, Elizabeth Hill, causing Hill to [[miscarriage|miscarry]]. The court ordered that Sherwood's guilt or innocence be determined by [[Trial by ordeal#Witch-hunts|ducking]] her in water. If she sank, she was innocent; if she did not, she was guilty. Sherwood floated to the surface and may have spent almost eight years in jail before being released.

Sherwood lived in [[Pungo, Virginia|Pungo]], [[Princess Anne County, Virginia|Princess Anne County]]{{efn|[[Lower Norfolk County]] before 1691}} (today part of [[Virginia Beach, Virginia|Virginia Beach]]), and married James Sherwood, a [[Plantations in the American South|planter]], in 1680. The couple had three sons: John, James, and Richard. Her first case was in 1697; she was accused of casting a [[spell (paranormal)|spell]] on a bull, resulting in its death, but the matter was dismissed by the agreement of both parties. The following year she was accused of witchcraft by two neighbors; she supposedly bewitched the hogs and cotton crop of one of them. Sherwood sued for [[defamation|slander]] after each accusation, but her lawsuits were unsuccessful and her husband had to pay court costs. In 1706 she was convicted of witchcraft and was incarcerated. Freed from prison by 1714, she recovered her property from Princess Anne County (her husband had died in 1701). She did not remarry, and lived on her farm until her death in 1740 at the age of about 80.

On July 10, 2006, the 300th anniversary of Sherwood's conviction, [[Governor of Virginia|Governor]] [[Tim Kaine]] granted an informal [[pardon]] to "officially restore [her] good name",{{sfnp|Barisic|2006}} recognizing that she was wrongfully convicted. A statue depicting her was erected near [[Sentara Health System|Sentara Independence]] on Independence Boulevard in Virginia Beach, close to the site of the colonial courthouse where she was tried. She is sculpted alongside a [[raccoon]], representing her love of animals, and carrying a basket containing [[garlic]] and [[rosemary]], in recognition of her knowledge of [[herbalism|herbal healing]].

== Family background ==
Sherwood was born in 1660{{sfnp|Old Donation Episcopal Church|2010}} to John and Susan White. John White was a carpenter and farmer{{sfnp|Chewning|2006|pp=83–90}} of Scottish descent; it is uncertain whether he was born in America. Susan was English by birth;{{sfnp|Nash|Sheets|2012|pp=40–44}} their daughter Grace was born in Virginia, probably in Pungo.{{sfnp|Witkowski|2012}}{{sfnp|Campbell|1934}}

In April 1680 Grace White married a respected small-farm landowner, James Sherwood, in the [[Old Donation Episcopal Church|Lynnhaven Parish Church]].{{sfnp|Old Donation Episcopal Church|2010}}{{sfnp|Campbell|1934}}{{sfnp|James|1894 Oct|pp=96–101}} The couple had three sons: John, James, and Richard.{{sfnp|Chewning|2006|p=83}} John White gave the Sherwoods {{convert|50|acre|ha}} of land when they married, and on his death in 1681 left them the remainder of his {{convert|145|acre|ha}} farm.{{sfnp|Chewning|2006|p=83}} The Sherwood family was poor, and lived in an area inhabited by small landowners or those with no land at all.{{sfnp|Campbell|1934}}{{sfnp|Hume|2005|pp=86–89}}{{sfnp|Newman|2009|pp=42–43}} In addition to farming, Grace Sherwood grew her own herbs, which she used to heal both people and animals. She also acted as a [[midwife]].{{sfnp|Virginia Historical Society|2006}} When James died in 1701, Grace inherited his property.{{sfnp|Department of Public Libraries|2006|pp=27–30}}{{sfnp|Chewning|2006|p=85}} She did not remarry.{{sfnp|Witkowski|2012}}

No drawings or paintings of Sherwood exist, but contemporary accounts describe her as attractive and tall and possessing a sense of humor. Sherwood wore trousers instead of a dress while working on her farm. This was unusual for the time, as was her herb growing. The combination of clothing and good looks was said to attract men and upset their wives.{{sfnp|Chewning|2006|pp=83–90}}{{sfnp|USA Today|2006}} Sherwood biographer and advocate Belinda Nash suggests that Sherwood's neighbors may have been jealous of Sherwood, and that the witchcraft tales may have been conjured up in an effort to remove her from, and subsequently get, her property.{{sfnp|Old Donation Episcopal Church|2010}}{{sfnp|USA Today|2006}} Sherwood was a party to at least a dozen lawsuits, in which she had to defend against accusations of witchcraft, or in which she sued her accusers for slander.{{sfnp|USA Today|2006}}

== Witchcraft and Virginia ==

[[File:Asheville_Bridge_Creek_in_Sigma,_Virginia.jpg|thumb|right|Asheville Bridge Creek, known as Muddy Creek when Grace Sherwood lived on its banks]]
The existence of witches and demonic forces was taken for granted by the American colonists—[[witchcraft]] was considered the work of the [[Devil]].{{sfnp|Newman|2009|pp=1–8}}{{sfnp|Hill|1972|p=87}}{{sfnp|Davis|1957|pp=131–149}} Colonists believed that witches could be identified by their strange behavior.{{sfnp|Virginia Beach.com|2013}} As early as 1626, nineteen years after the founding of the [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown colony]], a [[grand jury]] in Virginia sat to consider whether Goodwife Joan Wright was a witch—she had supposedly predicted the deaths of three women and had caused illness as revenge for not hiring her as midwife. No record of the outcome is extant.{{sfnp|Davis|1957|pp=138–139}} Nevertheless, Virginia did not experience events of [[mass hysteria]] such as the [[Salem witch trials|Salem, Massachusetts witch trials]] in 1692–1693, in which 19&amp;nbsp;people were executed on allegations of sorcery, some years before the first accusations against Sherwood.{{sfnp|USA Today|2006}} Ecclesiastical influence in the courtroom was much less a factor in Virginia, where the clergy rarely participated in witchcraft trials, than in New England, where ministers took an active part.{{sfnp|Newman|2009|pp=56–57, 65–74}} People's fears of witchcraft in Virginia were not based on their religious beliefs as much as they were rooted in [[folklore]], although the two often intermingled.{{sfnp|Newman|2009|p=37}} [[Puritans#New England Puritans|New England's Puritans]] had settled in towns, and community pressure helped contribute to witchcraft convictions. There were few such towns in Virginia, where the population mostly lived on farms and plantations, connected by water transport and scattered over a large area.{{sfnp|Newman|2009|pp=56–57}}

Virginia's lay and religious leaders were more interested in prosecuting offenses such as gossip, slander, and fornication, seeing them as threats to social stability. They wished to avoid witchcraft prosecutions, which were divisive.{{sfnp|Newman|2009|p=ii}} Virginia courts were reluctant to hear accusations of witchcraft and were even more reluctant to convict. Unlike the Salem witch trial courts, where the accused had to prove her innocence, in Virginia courts the accuser carried the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]].{{sfnp|Newman|2009|pp=58–59}} Further, Virginia courts generally ignored evidence said to have been obtained by [[ghost|supernatural]] means, whereas the New England courts were known to convict people based solely on it.{{sfnp|Newman|2009|pp=2–3, 10–11}} Virginia required proof of guilt through either searches for [[witches' mark|witch's marks]] or [[cucking stool|ducking]]. Judges and magistrates would dismiss unsubstantiated cases of witchcraft and allow the accusers, who found themselves "under an ill tongue", to be sued for slander.{{sfnp|Department of Public Libraries|2006|pp=27–30}}{{sfnp|Newman|2009|p=78}}{{sfnp|Good Luck Horseshoe|1909|pp=247248}} Frances Pollard of the [[Virginia Historical Society]] states: "It was pretty clear that Virginia early on tried to discourage these charges being brought of witchcraft because they were so troublesome."{{sfnp|USA Today|2006}} The [[Tidewater region|southeastern corner]] of Virginia, around present-day [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]] and Virginia Beach (where Pungo is located), saw more accusations of witchcraft than other areas. According to Leslie M. Newman, this may have been due to local poverty as there was no cultural elite to restrain such prosecutions.{{sfnp|Newman|2009|pp=42–43}}

Although few Virginia records survive from that era,{{sfnp|Hume|2005|pp=86–89}} 19&amp;nbsp;known witchcraft cases were brought in the colony during the 17th&amp;nbsp;century, all but one of which ended in acquittal.{{sfnp|USA Today|2006}}{{sfnp|Newman|2009|pp=2, 11}} The one conviction was a 1656 case of a man convicted of witchcraft and sentenced to 10 [[flagellation|stripes]] and banishment from the county.{{sfnp|Burr|1914|pp=435–442}}{{sfnp|Seltzer|2013}}{{sfnp|The William and Mary Quarterly|1893|pp=127–129}} There were no executions for witchcraft in Virginia.{{sfnp|USA Today|2006}} Nonetheless, as late as in 1736, Virginia's [[justice of the peace|justices of the peace]] were reminded that witchcraft was still a crime, and that first offenders could expect to be [[pillory|pilloried]] and jailed for up to a year.{{sfnp|Hume|2005|pp=86–89}} In 1745, John Craig, a Presbyterian minister in [[Augusta County, Virginia|Augusta County]], made assertions of witchcraft after his child and several of his animals died, and was in response accused of using evil arts to [[divination|divine]] who was responsible. Neither he nor those who accused him brought their claims to court to face "unsympathetic magistrates", though prosecution for witchcraft was still possible in Virginia.{{sfnp|Butler|1979|p=338}} The last Virginia witchcraft trial took place in 1802 in [[Brooke County, West Virginia|Brooke County]], which is now in [[West Virginia]]. In that case, a couple claimed that a woman was a witch, an accusation ruled slanderous.{{sfnp|USA Today|2006}}

The trial by ducking (immersing the accused, bound, in water, to see if she would float) appears to have been used only once in Virginia, to try Sherwood.{{sfnp|USA Today|2006}}{{sfnp|Barisic|2006}} It was believed that, as water was considered pure, it would reject witches, causing them to float, whereas the innocent would sink.{{sfnp|Barisic|2006}}

== Accusations against Sherwood ==

=== Initial claims of witchcraft ===
The first accusation against Sherwood came to court in early 1697. Richard Capps alleged that she had used a spell to cause the death of his bull. The court made no decision,{{sfnp|Old Donation Episcopal Church|2010}} and the Sherwoods filed a defamation suit against Capps that was resolved by a settlement.{{sfnp|Yarsinske|2002|pp=61–62}} In 1698, Sherwood was accused by her neighbor John Gisburne of enchanting his pigs and cotton crop. No court action followed this accusation, and another suit for defamation by the Sherwoods failed. In the same year Elizabeth Barnes alleged that Sherwood had assumed the form of a [[Black cat#Historical associations|black cat]], entered Barnes' home, jumped over her bed, drove and whipped her, and left via the keyhole. Again the allegation was unresolved, and again the subsequent defamation action was lost. For each of the failed actions, Sherwood and her husband had to pay court-related costs.{{sfnp|Old Donation Episcopal Church|2010}}{{sfnp|Department of Public Libraries|2006|pp=27–30}}{{sfnp|Yarsinske|2002|pp=61–62}}{{sfnp|Nash|Sheets|2012|p=108}}

According to Richard Beale Davis in his journal article on witchcraft in Virginia, by this time "Princess Anne County had obviously grown tired of Mrs. Sherwood as a general nuisance".{{sfnp|Davis|1957|p=146}} In 1705, Sherwood was involved in a fight with her neighbor, Elizabeth Hill.{{sfnp|James|1895 Jan|pp=190–192}} Sherwood sued Hill and her husband for assault and battery, and on December 7, 1705, was awarded damages of twenty shillings (one [[pound sterling]]).{{sfnp|Witkowski|2012}}{{sfnp|James|1895 Jan}} 

=== Trial by water ===
[[File:Ordeal of water.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Engraving of a naked woman with hands tied to tied on her back floating on water as a trial by ordeal for being a witch|17th-century engraving of ducking similar to that of Sherwood]]
On January 3, 1706, the Hills accused Grace Sherwood of witchcraft.  She failed to answer the charge in court,{{sfnp|James|1895 Apr|pp=242–245}} and on February 7, 1706, the court ordered her to appear on a charge of having bewitched Elizabeth Hill, causing a miscarriage.{{sfnp|Burr|1914|pp=435–442}} In March 1706 the Princess Anne County justices sought to empanel two juries, both made up of women. The first was ordered to search Sherwood's home for waxen or baked figures that might indicate she was a witch. The second was ordered to look for "demon suckling teats" by examining her.{{sfnp|Hume|2005|pp=86–89}}{{sfnp|Newman|2009|pp=48–49}} In both instances, reluctance on the part of the local residents made it difficult to form a jury and both juries refused to carry out the searches.{{sfnp|Burr|1914|pp=435–442}}{{sfnp|Davis|1957|p=146}} On March 7, 1706, Sherwood was examined by a jury of 12 "ancient and knowing women" appointed to look for markings on her body that might be brands of the Devil.{{sfnp|James|1895 Jul|pages=18–22}} They discovered two "marks not like theirs or like those of any other woman".{{sfnp|James|1895 Jul|pages=18–22}} The forewoman of this jury was the same Elizabeth Barnes who had previously accused Sherwood of witchcraft.{{sfnp|Campbell|1934}}

Neither the colonial authorities in Williamsburg nor the local court in Princess Anne were willing to declare Sherwood a witch.{{sfnp|Department of Public Libraries|2006|pp=27–30}} Those in Williamsburg considered the charge overly vague, and on April 16 instructed the local court to examine the case more fully. For each court appearance, Sherwood had to travel {{convert|16|mi}} from her farm in Pungo to where the court was sitting.{{sfnp|Old Donation Episcopal Church|2010}}{{sfnp|Burr|1914|pp=435–442}}

On May 2, 1706, the county justices noted that while no particular act of [[maleficium (sorcery)|maleficium]] had been alleged against Sherwood, there was "great cause of suspicion".{{sfnp|Newman|2009|p=47}} Consequently, the Sheriff of Princess Anne County took Sherwood into custody, though Sherwood could give bond for her appearance and good behavior.{{sfnp|James|1895 Apr|pp=242–245}} Maximilian Boush, a [[churchwarden|warden]] of Lynnhaven Parish Church, was the prosecutor in Sherwood's case.{{sfnp|Old Donation Episcopal Church|2010}} On July 5, 1706, the justices ordered a trial by ducking to take place, with Sherwood's consent,{{sfnp|Davis|1957|pp=146–147}} but heavy rains caused a postponement until July 10, as they feared the wet weather might harm her health.{{sfnp|Cushing|1833|pp=73–78}} Sherwood was taken inside Lynnhaven Parish Church, placed on a stool and ordered to ask for forgiveness for her witchery.{{sfnp|James|1895 Apr|pp=242–245}} She replied, "I be not a witch, I be a healer."{{sfnp|Old Donation Episcopal Church|2010}}

[[File:Witch Duck Bay.jpg|thumb|200px|left|alt=A bay and two points of land|Witch Duck Bay as seen from the very end of North Witchduck Road on Witch Duck Point in Virginia Beach, looking north. This is the place where Grace Sherwood was ducked.]]
At about 10&amp;nbsp;a.m. on July 10, 1706, Sherwood was taken down a dirt lane now known as Witchduck Road,{{sfnp|USA Today|2006}}{{sfnp|Virginia Beach.com|2009}} to a plantation near the mouth of the [[Lynnhaven River]].{{sfnp|James|1895 Apr|pp=242–245}}{{sfnp|Harpers|1884|pp=99–102}} News had spread, and the event attracted people from all over the colony,{{sfnp|Old Donation Episcopal Church|2010}} who began to shout "Duck the witch!"{{sfnp|USA Today|2006}} According to the principles of trial by water, if Sherwood floated she would be deemed guilty of witchcraft; if she did not, she would be innocent. It was not intended that Sherwood drown; the court had ordered that care be taken to preserve her life.{{sfnp|Seltzer|2013}}

Five women of Lynnhaven Parish Church examined Sherwood's naked body on the shoreline for any devices she might have to free herself, and then covered her with a sack.{{sfnp|James|1895 Apr|pp=242–245}} Six of the justices that had ordered the ducking rowed in one boat {{convert|200|yd}} out in the river,{{sfnp|Old Donation Episcopal Church|2010}}{{sfnp|USA Today|2006}} and in another were the sheriff, the magistrate, and Sherwood. Just before she was pushed off the boat Sherwood is said to have stated, under clear skies, "Before this day be through you will all get a worse ducking than I."{{sfnp|USA Today|2006}} Bound across the body—her right thumb to her left big toe and her left thumb to her right big toe&amp;nbsp;– she was "cast into the river",{{sfnp|The William and Mary Quarterly|1893|pp=127–129}} and quickly floated to the surface.{{sfnp|Department of Public Libraries|2006|pp=27–30}} The sheriff then tied a {{convert|13|lb|adj=on}} Bible around her neck. This caused her to sink, but she untied herself, and returned to the surface, convincing many spectators she was a witch.{{sfnp|Old Donation Episcopal Church|2010}} As Sherwood was pulled out of the water a downpour reportedly started, drenching the onlookers.{{sfnp|USA Today|2006}}{{sfnp|Barisic|2006}} Several women who subsequently examined her for additional proof found "two [[supernumerary nipple|things like titts]] on her private parts of a black coller [color]". She was jailed pending further proceedings.{{sfnp|James|1895 Jul|pages=18–22}}

What happened to Sherwood after her ducking is unclear{{sfnp|Hume|2005|pp=86–89}} as many court records have been lost.{{efn|George Lincoln Burr's book ''Narrative of the Witchcraft Cases 1648–1706'' reproduces the text of the surviving records relating to Sherwood and to other witchcraft cases, "a selection made and edited by a master hand from authentic, original documents". See {{harvnb|Burstein|1961|p=527}}}}{{sfn|Butler|1979|p=335}} She served an unknown time in the jail next to Lynnhaven Parish Church,{{sfnp|James|1895 Jul|pages=18–22}} perhaps as long as seven years and nine months.{{sfnp|Barisic|2006}} She was ordered to be detained "to be brought to a future trial", but no record of another trial exists, so it is possible the charge was dismissed at some point.{{sfnp|James|1895 Jul|pages=18–22}} On September 1, 1708, she was ordered to pay Christopher Cocke {{convert|600|lb}} of tobacco{{efn|Then used as currency in Virginia.{{sfnp|Murphy|2017}}}} for a reason not indicated in surviving records, but there is no mention of the payment.{{sfnp|James|1895 Jul|pages=18–22}} She appears to have been released some time in or before 1714, since in that year she paid back taxes on her {{convert|145|acre|adj=on}} property—which [[Lieutenant Governor of Virginia|Virginia Lieutenant Governor]] [[Alexander Spotswood]] helped her to recover from Princess Anne County—on the banks of Muddy Creek off what is now Muddy Creek Road.{{sfnp|Barisic|2006}}{{sfnp|Virginia Beach Historical Society|2001a}}{{sfnp|Ruegsegger|1999}} She lived the remainder of her life quietly until her death in 1740, aged about 80.{{sfnp|Old Donation Episcopal Church|2010}}{{sfnp|USA Today|2006}}{{sfnp|Virginia Beach Historical Society|2001}} She is believed to have died in August or September 1740.{{sfnp|Nash|Sheets|2012|pp=136–139}} Her will was proved on October 1, 1740; it noted that she was a widow.{{sfnp|Hume|2005|pp=86–89}} She left five [[Shilling#North America|shilling]]s each to her sons James and Richard and everything else to her eldest son John.{{sfnp|Chewning|2006|p=89}}

According to legend, Sherwood's sons put her body near the fireplace, and a wind came down the chimney. Her body disappeared amid the embers, with the only clue being a cloven hoofprint.{{sfnp|Department of Public Libraries|2006|pp=27–30}} Sherwood lies in an unmarked grave under some trees in a field near the intersection of Pungo Ferry Road and Princess Anne Road in Virginia Beach.{{sfnp|Old Donation Episcopal Church|2010}} Stories about the Devil taking her body, unnatural storms, and loitering black cats quickly arose after her death, and local men killed every feline they could find; this widespread killing of cats might have caused the infestation of rats and mice recorded in Princess Anne County in 1743.{{sfnp|Chewning|2006|pp=83–90}} Her home on Muddy Creek stood for over 200 years. After being burned several times in the 20th century by vandals, all that was left in 2002 were the brick chimneys, which were bulldozed in November 2002. All that remains are a few bricks and part of the foundation, which is overgrown. The property is now owned by the Federal Government as part of [[Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge]].{{sfnp|Nash|Sheets|2012|pp=144–148}}

Grace Sherwood's case was little known until Virginia Beach historian and author [[Louisa Venable Kyle]] wrote a children's book about her in 1973. Called ''The Witch of Pungo'', it is a collection of seven local [[Folklore of the United States|folk tales]] written as fiction, although based on historical events.{{sfnp|Virginia Beach Historical Society|2001}}{{sfnp|Gibson|2007|pp=95–97}} Sherwood's story was adapted for ''Cry Witch'', a courtroom drama at [[Colonial Williamsburg]], the restored early capital of Virginia.{{sfnp|USA Today|2006}}

A statue by California sculptor Robert Cunningham depicting Sherwood with a raccoon and a basket of rosemary was unveiled on April 21, 2007, on the site of the present-day Sentara Bayside Hospital, close to the sites of both the colonial courthouse and the ducking point.{{sfnp|Batts|2007}}{{sfnp|Adams|2009}} The raccoon represents Sherwood's love of animals and the rosemary her knowledge of herbal healing.{{sfnp|Batts|2007}} A Virginia Department of Historic Resources marker (K-276) was erected in 2002, about {{convert|25|yd}} from Sherwood's statue. The place of her watery test and the adjacent land are named Witch Duck Bay and Witch Duck Point.{{efn|Witch Duck Bay location: {{Coord|36.881|N|76.117|W|display=inline}}}}{{sfnp|Adams|2009}} A portion of [[Virginia State Route 190]] in Virginia Beach, a north–south thoroughfare on its western side which traverses [[Interstate 264 (Virginia)|Interstate 264]] at exit numbers 14–16, has been named "[[Virginia State Route 190|Witchduck Road]]".{{sfnp|Interstate Guide|2013}} Other commemorations in Virginia Beach include Sherwood Lane and Witch Point Trail.{{sfnp|Virginia Beach.com|2009}}{{sfnp|Dunphy|1994}} In 2014, a memorial marker was placed at a herb garden of the [[Old Donation Episcopal Church]], Sherwood's former parish church, which is in Virginia Beach.{{sfnp|Cleavelin|2014}} A local legend in Virginia Beach states that all of the rosemary growing there came from a single plant Sherwood carried in an eggshell from England.{{efn|While it was common at the time to protect seedlings in eggshells,{{sfnp|Chewning|2006|pp=83–90}} this tale appears to be a variant of another legend that she once ran out of rosemary and rowed an eggshell to a ship in the harbor, bewitched the lone person on board, and sailed in a single night to and from England.{{sfnp|Hume|2005|p=85}} Another version of the story describes her sailing to the Mediterranean in an eggshell. See {{harvnb|Campbell|1934}} and {{harvnb|Harpers|1884|pp=99–102}}}}{{sfnp|Department of Public Libraries|2006|pp=27–30.}}

[[File:Grace Sherwood stone horizontal.jpg|thumb|Memorial marker for Sherwood]]
Belinda Nash, in addition to writing a biography of Sherwood, worked tirelessly to get her pardoned.{{sfnp|Shapira|2006}} Governor [[Tim Kaine]] granted an informal [[pardon]] to "officially restore the good name of Grace Sherwood" on July 10, 2006, the 300th anniversary of her conviction.{{sfnp|Virginia Historical Society|2006}}{{sfnp|Barisic|2006}} Annual reenactments of the ducking have taken place since 2006. No one is actually ducked in these events, which embark from a spot across from [[Ferry Plantation House]] along Cheswick Lane, which is very close to Witch Duck Bay.{{sfnp|Wethersfield Historical Society|2012}}{{sfnp|Batts|2006}} According to local residents, a strange moving light, said to be Sherwood's restless spirit, still appears each July over the spot in Witch Duck Bay where Sherwood was thrown into the water.{{sfnp|Adams|2009}}

[[File:Хаджи-Мурат.JPG|thumb|Hadji Murad]]
'''Hadji Murad''' ({{lang-ru|Хаджи-Мурат}}, {{lang-av|XӀажи Мурад}}; late 1790s – April 23, [[New Style|N.S.]] May 5, 1852) was an important [[Caucasian Avars|Avar]] leader during the resistance of the peoples of [[Dagestan]] and [[Chechnya]] in 1811–1864 against the incorporation of the region into the [[Russian Empire]].

==Life==
===Alliance with Russia===
Hadji Murad was an Avar commander who lived in the Caucasus. He was foster-brother to Omar, Pakkou-Bekkhe, the [[Khanum#Compound and derived princely titles|Khanum]] of [[Khunzak]]'s son. Hadji Murad was involved in the murder of [[Gamzat-bek]] during a Friday prayer in 1834, in revenge for Gamzat's murdering of the Khanum and her sons. Murad's brother, Osman, was slain in the fight with Gamzat-bek's [[Murid]]s.

Hadji Murad supported the Russians for a while, to counter what he saw as the threat of [[Murid]]ism. His rival, Akhmet Khan, set about undermining Russian confidence in Murad, until they ordered his arrest, which was carried out by Akhmet Khan. General [[Mikhail Semyonovich Vorontsov]] demanded that he be brought into general headquarters. Hadji Murad contrived to escape, by flinging himself over the ledge of a narrow mountain-pass. The Russians gave him up for dead. The snow, however, had broken his fall and he lay in hiding for the winter. Because of the Russian's bad faith, he decided to throw his lot in with [[Imam Shamil]], who bestowed upon him the rank of naib. Many tribes followed Hadji Murad, defecting from the Russians.

===Exploits and service under Shamil===
His exploits and red dress earned him the nickname of the 'red devil' from the Russians. After an ineffectual raid on Russian headquarters at [[Buynaksk|Temir-Khan-Shura]], a rumour spread that he had slaughtered all the Russians in the hospital and cut them up into [[shashlik]]s, which he left behind for the Russian troops to eat unawares. Though false, this rumour gained much credence among the Russians and vilified Hadji Murad's reputation.

===Defection to Russia===
In 1851, a feud broke out between him and Shamil, when Shamil proclaimed his son, Khazi Mohammed, as the successor. In a secret meeting, Shamil and his naibs decided that Hadji Murad should be killed. An unknown naib warned him and he managed to escape in time, but his family were held captive. Hadji Murad surrendered to the Russians, who lionised but mistrusted him. He repeatedly asked to be given men and guns to attack Shamil and rescue his family, but received no firm reply. He was allowed to move from [[Tbilisi]] to the small Muslim town of [[Shaki, Azerbaijan|Noukkha]] (now Shaki, [[Azerbaijan]]) accompanied by a [[Cossack]] escort. Hadji Murad planned an escape, which he carried out on April 24 ([[Old style calendar]]), 1852, during one of his morning rides. The Cossack guards were ambushed and killed but the town's garrison, led by Colonel Karganov, tracked Hadji Murad down. The Russians were joined by many tribesmen, including Akhmet Khan's son and Hadji Murad was killed in the ensuing fight. The young Akhmet Khan cut off the head and sent it to Tbilisi, where it was embalmed and then sent to the [[Nicholas I of Russia|Emperor]]. [[Hadji Murat (novel)|Tolstoy]] places Murad's death near the minaret of Belarjik (probably referring to the latterday town of Biləcik on the Shaki to [[Qax]] road) but a commemorative grave marker is further south near km76 on the Shaki-[[Zaqatala (city)|Zaqatala]] road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Mark Elliott (British author)|Elliott, Mark]]|title="Azerbaijan with excursions to Georgia" (4th edition)|year=2010|page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hadji Murad's severed head was finally sent to be kept at the [[Kunstkamera]] in St. Petersburg. In 2017, his descendants and activists in Dagestan petitioned to retrieve his skull from St. Petersburg and reunite it with the rest of his remains believed to be buried in modern Azerbaijan's [[Qakh District]]. The Russian government set up an interagency commission to consider the request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lomsadze|first1=Giorgi|title=To Bury, or Not to Bury?

===In fiction===
[[File:Hadji Murad.jpg|thumb|Hadji Murad]]
[[Leo Tolstoy]]'s posthumously published novel ''[[Hadji Murat (novel)|Hadji Murad]]'' (1912) is a fictionalized account of Murad's struggle with the Russian Empire. His image also appears in ''My Dagestan'', a novel of the Avars writer [[Rasul Gamzatov]].

''Agi Murad il diavolo bianco'' (1959) – in English, ''[[The White Warrior]]'' – is an Italian movie account of Murad's struggle with the Russian Empire. Murad is played by [[Steve Reeves]].

'''Harun al-Rashid'''  ({{IPAc-en|h|ɑː|ˈ|r|uː|n|_|ɑː|l|r|ɑː|ˈ|ʃ|iː|d|}}; {{lang-ar|هَارُون الرَشِيد}} ''Hārūn Ar-Rašīd''; "Aaron the Orthodox" or "Aaron the Rightly-Guided," 17 March 763 or February 766&amp;nbsp;– 24 March 809 (148–193 Hijri))&lt;ref&gt;Assuyuti, ''Tarikh Al Khulafa''&lt;/ref&gt; was the fifth [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] [[Caliph]]. His birth date is debated, with various sources giving dates from 763 to 766. His [[laqab|epithet]] "al-Rashid" translates to "the Orthodox," "the Just," "the Upright," or "the Rightly-Guided." Al-Rashid ruled from 786 to 809, during the peak of the [[Islamic Golden Age]]. His time was marked by [[Science in medieval Islam|scientific]], [[Muslim culture|cultural]], and [[Islam|religious]] prosperity. [[Islamic art]] and [[Islamic music|music]] also flourished significantly during his reign.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} He established the legendary library [[House of Wisdom|Bayt al-Hikma]] ("House of Wisdom") in [[Baghdad]] in present-day [[Iraq]], and during his rule Baghdad began to flourish as a center of knowledge, culture and trade.&lt;ref&gt;Audun Holme, ''Geometry: Our Cultural Heritage'' p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; During his rule, the family of [[Barmakids]], which played a deciding role in establishing the Abbasid Caliphate, declined gradually. In 796, he moved his court and government to [[Raqqa]] in present-day [[Syria]].

A [[Franks|Frankish]] mission came to offer Harun friendship in 799. Harun sent various presents with the emissaries on their return to [[Charlemagne]]'s court, including a clock that Charlemagne and his retinue deemed to be a conjuration because of the sounds it emanated and the tricks it displayed every time an hour ticked.&lt;ref&gt;André Clot, ''Harun al-Rashid and the world of the thousand and one nights'', p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; The fictional ''[[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights]]'' is set in Harun's magnificent court and some of its stories involve Harun himself.&lt;ref&gt;André Clot, ''Harun al-Rashid and the world of the thousand and one nights''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Harun's life and court have been the subject of many other tales, both factual and fictitious.

Some of the [[Twelver]] sect of [[Shia Muslims]] blame Harun for his supposed role in the murder of their 7th Imam ([[Musa ibn Ja'far]]).

==Biography==

=== Early life ===

Hārūn was born in [[Rey, Iran|Rey]], then part of [[Jibal]] in the Abbasid Caliphate, in present-day [[Tehran Province]], [[Iran]]. He was the son of [[al-Mahdi]], the third Abbasid caliph (ruled 775 – 785), and [[al-Khayzuran]], a former slave girl from [[Yemen]], who was a woman of strong personality and who greatly influenced affairs of state in the reigns of her husband, mother and sons.

Before becoming caliph, in 780 and again in 782, Hārūn had already nominally led campaigns against the Caliphate's traditional enemy, the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], which was under the rule of empress [[Irene (empress)|Irene of Athens]]. The [[Abbasid invasion of Asia Minor (782)|latter expedition]] was a huge undertaking, and even reached the Asian suburbs of [[Constantinople]].

=== As Caliph ===
[[File:Abbasid Provinces ca 788.png|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Map of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] and its provinces, {{circa|788}}]]
Hārūn became caliph in 786 when he was in his early twenties. On the day of accession, his son [[al-Ma'mun]] was born, and [[al-Amin]] some little time later: the latter was the son of [[Zubaidah bint Ja`far|Zubaida]], a granddaughter of [[al-Mansur]] (founder of the city of Baghdad); so he took precedence over the former, whose mother was a Persian. He began his reign by appointing very able ministers, who carried on the work of the government so well that they greatly improved the condition of the people.&lt;ref&gt;New Arabian nights' entertainments, Volume 3&lt;/ref&gt;

It was under Hārūn ar-Rashīd that Baghdad flourished into the most splendid city of its period. Tribute was paid by many rulers to the caliph, and these funds were used on [[Abbasid architecture|architecture]], the [[arts]] and a luxurious life at court.

In 796, Hārūn decided to move his court and the government to [[Raqqa]] at the middle [[Euphrates]].&lt;!---clarify please---&gt; Here he spent 12 years, most of his reign. Only once did he return to Baghdad for a short visit. Several reasons might have influenced the decision to move to Raqqa. It was close to the Byzantine border. The communication lines via the Euphrates to Baghdad and via the Balikh river to the north and via [[Palmyra]] to Damascus were excellent. The agriculture was flourishing to support the new Imperial center. And from Raqqa any rebellion in Syria and the middle Euphrates area could be controlled. [[Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani]] pictures in his anthology of poems the splendid life in his court. In Raqqa the Barmekids managed the fate of the empire, and there both heirs, al-Amin and al-Ma'mun grew up.

For the administration of the whole empire, he fell back on his mentor and longtime associate Yahya bin Khalid bin Barmak. Rashid appointed him as his [[vizier]] with full executive powers, and, for seventeen years, this man Yahya and his sons, served Rashid faithfully in whatever assignment he entrusted to them.&lt;ref&gt;Masʻūdī, Paul Lunde, Caroline Stone, The meadows of gold: the Abbasids page 62&lt;/ref&gt;

Harun made pilgrimages to Mecca several times, e.g., 793, 795, 797, 802 and last in 803. Tabari concludes his account of Harun's reign with these words: "It has been said that when Harun ar-Rashid died, there were nine hundred million odd (dirhams) in the state treasury."

=== Advisors ===

[[File:(ar-Rashid) dirham 170h.jpg|thumb|250px|left|A silver [[dirham]] minted in Madinat al-Salam (Bagdad) in 170 [[Anno Hegirae|AH]] (786 CE). At the reverse, the inner marginal inscription says: "By order of the slave of God, Harun, [[Commander of the Faithful]]"]]

Hārūn was influenced by the will of his mother in the governance of the empire until her death in 789. His [[vizier]] (chief minister) [[Yahya the Barmakid]], Yahya's sons (especially [[Ja'far ibn Yahya]]), and other [[Barmakids]] generally controlled the administration. The position of [[Persian people|Persians]] in the Abbasid caliphal court reached its peak during al-Rashid's reign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=39XZDnOWUXsC&amp;pg=PA66|title=The Persian Presence in the Islamic World|first1=Richard G.|last1=Hovannisian|first2=Georges|last2=Sabagh|date=19 November 1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=1 September 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Barmakids were a Persian family (from [[Balkh]]) that dated back to the [[Khalid ibn Barmak|Barmak]] a hereditary [[Buddhist]] priest of [[Nava Vihara]], who converted after the Islamic conquest of Balkh and became very powerful under al-Mahdi. Yahya had helped Hārūn in obtaining the caliphate, and he and his sons were in high favor until 798, when the caliph threw them in prison and confiscated their land. [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari]] dates this in 803 and lists various accounts for the cause: Yahya's entering the Caliph's presence without permission; Yahya's opposition to Muhammad ibn al Layth, who later gained Harun's favour; and Ja'far's release of Yahya ibn Abdallah ibn Hasan, whom Harun had imprisoned.

The fall of the Barmakids is far more likely due to their behaving in a manner that Harun found disrespectful (such as entering his court unannounced) and making decisions in matters of state without first consulting him.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} [[Al-Fadl ibn al-Rabi]] succeeded Yahya the Barmakid as Harun's chief minister.

=== Diplomacy ===

[[File:Harun-Charlemagne.jpg|thumb|right|Harun al-Rashid receiving a delegation sent by [[Charlemagne]] at his court in Baghdad. 1864 painting by Julius Köckert.]]

Both [[Einhard]] and [[Notker the Stammerer]] refer to envoys travelling between Harun's and Charlemagne's courts, amicable discussions concerning Christian access to the Holy Land and the exchange of gifts. Notker mentions Charlemagne sent Harun Spanish horses, colourful Frisian cloaks and impressive hunting dogs. In 802 Harun sent Charlemagne a present consisting of [[silk]]s, [[brass]] [[candelabra]], [[perfume]], [[Balsam of Mecca|balsam]], [[ivory]] chessmen, a colossal tent with many-colored curtains, an [[elephant]] named [[Abul-Abbas]], and a [[water clock]] that marked the hours by dropping bronze balls into a bowl, as mechanical [[knights]]—one for each hour—emerged from little doors which shut behind them. The presents were unprecedented in Western Europe and may have influenced [[Carolingian]] art.

When the Byzantine empress [[Irene (empress)|Irene]] was deposed in 802, [[Nikephoros I]] became emperor and refused to pay tribute to Harun, saying that Irene should have been receiving the tribute the whole time. News of this angered Harun, who wrote a message on the back of the Roman emperor's letter and said "In the name of God the most merciful, From [[Amir al-Mu'minin]] Harun ar-Rashid, commander of the faithful, to Nikephoros, dog of the Romans. Thou shalt not hear, thou shalt behold my reply". After [[Abbasid invasion of Asia Minor (806)|campaigns in Asia Minor]], Nikephoros was forced to conclude a treaty, with humiliating terms.&lt;ref&gt;Tarikh ath-Thabari 4/668-669&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Kathir, Al-Bidaya wa'l-Nihaya v 13 .p 650&lt;/ref&gt;

An alliance was established with the Chinese [[Tang dynasty]] by Ar-Rashid after he sent embassies to China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QivwtVwq8ykC&amp;pg=PA214&amp;dq=arab+mercenaries+china&amp;q=arab%20mercenaries%20china|title=The Chinese Machiavelli: 3000 years of Chinese statecraft|author=Dennis Bloodworth, Ching Ping Bloodworth|year=2004|publisher=Transaction Publishers|location=|page=214|isbn=0-7658-0568-5|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=drPQaUGOJQIC&amp;pg=PA138&amp;dq=abu+giafar+chinese#v=onepage&amp;q=harun%20raschid%20less%20obtrusive&amp;f=false|title=Confucianism and its rivals|author=Herbert Allen Giles|accessdate=2011-12-14 |edition=|series= |volume= |date= |year=1926 |month= |publisher=Forgotten Books |location= |language= |isbn=1-60680-248-8|page=139 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was called "A-lun" in the Chinese [[Tang Annals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ObcNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=Several+embassies+from+the+Abbaside+Caliphs+to+the+Chinese+Court+are+recorded+in+the+T'ang+Annals,+the+most+important+of+these+being+those+of+(A-bo-lo-ba)+Abul+Abbas,+the+founder+of+the+new+dynasty,+that+of+(Ap'u-cKa-fo)+Abu+Giafar#v=onepage&amp;q=Several%20embassies%20from%20the%20Abbaside%20Caliphs%20to%20the%20Chinese%20Court%20are%20recorded%20in%20the%20T'ang%20Annals%2C%20the%20most%20important%20of%20these%20being%20those%20of%20(A-bo-lo-ba)%20Abul%20Abbas%2C%20the%20founder%20of%20the%20new%20dynasty%2C%20that%20of%20(Ap'u-cKa-fo)%20Abu%20Giafar&amp;f=false|title=Islam in China: a neglected problem|author=Marshall Broomhall|accessdate=2011-12-14 |edition=|series= |volume= |date= |year=1910 |month= |publisher=Morgan &amp; Scott, ltd. |location=LONDON 12 PATERNOSTER BUILDINGS, E.C. |language= |isbn=|pages=25, 26 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alliance was aimed against the Tibetans.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=W4mCH1oCKTkC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=Luciano+Petech+Harun+Tibetans&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ari2VK3MNoGyggSmpYLADw&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Luciano%20Petech%20Harun%20Tibetans&amp;f=false Bajpai 2002], p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Tn5oVOER2ogC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=A+few+years+later,+the+Arabian+Caliph+Harun+Al+Rashid+allied+himself+with+the+Chinese+in+order+to+keep+the+Tibetans+in+check.+Attacked+by+the&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5Lm2VJW9B4emgwS29IGADA&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=A%20few%20years%20later%2C%20the%20Arabian%20Caliph%20Harun%20Al%20Rashid%20allied%20himself%20with%20the%20Chinese%20in%20order%20to%20keep%20the%20Tibetans%20in%20check.%20Attacked%20by%20the&amp;f=false Bajpai 1981], p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=aBcdAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=A+few+years+later,+the+Arabian+Caliph+Harun+Al+Rashid+allied+himself+with+the+Chinese+in+order+to+keep+the+Tibetans+in+check.+Attacked+by+the&amp;dq=A+few+years+later,+the+Arabian+Caliph+Harun+Al+Rashid+allied+himself+with+the+Chinese+in+order+to+keep+the+Tibetans+in+check.+Attacked+by+the&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5Lm2VJW9B4emgwS29IGADA&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAg Bajpai 1970], p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_ahBEjHRnBcC&amp;pg=PA32#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Nomadic Empires: From Mongolia to the Danube|first=GÃ©rard|last=Chaliand|publisher=Transaction Publishers|accessdate=1 September 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luciano Petech, ''A Study of the Chronicles of Ladakh'' (Calcutta, 1939), pp. 73-73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luciano Petech, ''A Study of the Chronicles of Ladakh'' (Calcutta, 1939), pp. 55-85.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rebellions ===

Because of the ''Thousand and One Nights'' tales, Harun ar-Rashid turned into a legendary figure obscuring his true historic personality. In fact, his reign initiated the political disintegration of the Abbasid caliphate. [[al-Sham|Syria]] was inhabited by tribes with Umayyad sympathies and remained the bitter enemy of the Abbasids, while Egypt witnessed uprisings against Abbasids due to maladministration and arbitrary taxation. The Umayyads had been established in Spain in 755, the [[Idrisids]] in Morocco in 788, and the [[Aghlabids]] in Ifriqiya (modern Tunisia) in 800. Besides, unrest flared up in Yemen, and the Kharijites rose in rebellion in Daylam, Kerman, Fars and Sistan. Revolts also broke out in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], and ar-Rashid waged many campaigns against the Byzantines.

Ar-Rashid appointed [[Ali ibn Isa ibn Mahan|Ali bin Isa bin Mahan]] as the governor of Khorasan, who tried to bring to heel the princes and chieftains of the region, and to reimpose the full authority of the central government on them. This new policy met with fierce resistance and provoked numerous uprisings in the region.

=== Death ===

A major revolt led by [[Rafi ibn al-Layth]] was started in [[Samarkand|Samarqand]] which forced Harun al-Rashid to move to Khorasan. He first removed and arrested Ali bin Isa bin Mahan but the revolt continued unchecked. Harun al-Rashid became ill and died very soon when he reached Sanabad village in [[Tus, Iran|Tus]] and was buried in Dar al-Imarah, the summer palace of [[Humayd ibn Qahtaba]], the Abbasid governor of Khorasan. Due to this historical event, the Dar al-Imarah was known as the Mausoleum of Haruniyyeh. The location later became known as [[Mashhad]] ("The Place of Martyrdom") because of the martyrdom of [[Ali ar-Ridha|Imam ar-Ridha]] in 818.

=== Legacy ===

Al-Rashid virtually dismembered the empire by apportioning it between his two sons al-Amin and al-Ma'mun (with his third son, [[Al-Qasim ibn Harun al-Rashid|al-Qasim]], being belatedly added after them). Very soon it became clear that by dividing the empire, Rashid had actually helped to set the opposing parties against one another, and had provided them with sufficient resources to become independent of each other.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} After the death of Harun al-Rashid, [[Fourth Fitna|civil war]] broke out in the empire between his two sons, al-Amin and al-Ma'mun, which spiralled into a prolonged period of turmoil and warfare throughout the Caliphate, ending only with Ma'mun's final triumph in 827.

==Anecdotes==
Many anecdotes attached themselves to the person of Harun al-Rashid in the centuries following his rule. [[Saadi (poet)|Saadi]] of Shiraz inserted a number of them into his [[Gulistan of Sa'di|Gulistan]], in one telling how Harun enjoined his son to forgiveness.

[[Al-Masudi]] relates a number of interesting anecdotes in ''[[The Meadows of Gold]]'' illuminating the character of this caliph. For example, he recounts Harun's delight when his horse came in first, closely followed by al-Ma'mun's, at a race Harun held at Raqqa. Al-Masudi tells the story of Harun setting his poets a challenging task. When others failed to please him, Miskin of Medina succeeded superbly well. The poet then launched into a moving account of how much it had cost him to learn that song. Harun laughed saying he knew not which was more entertaining, the song or the story. He rewarded the poet.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Masudi, ''The Meadows of Gold'', p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also the tale of Harun asking Ishaq ibn Ibrahim to keep singing. The musician did until the caliph fell asleep. Then, strangely, a handsome young man appeared, snatched the musician's lute, sang a very moving piece (al-Masudi quotes it), and left. On awakening and being informed of this, Harun said Ishaq ibn Ibrahim had received a supernatural visitation.

There is a street in Cairo, Egypt named after his name, located in Masr El-Gdida.

Shortly before he died, Harun is said to have been reading some lines by [[Abu al-Atahiya]] about the transitory nature of the power and pleasures of this world, an anecdote related about other caliphs as well.

*Harun al-Rashid was a main figure and character in several of the stories in some of the oldest versions of the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]''.
*Hārūn ar-Rashīd figures throughout [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', in a dream of [[Stephen Dedalus]], one of the protagonists.

* In a 1923 poem by [[W. B. Yeats]], "The Gift of Harun al-Rashid",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csun.edu/~hceng029/yeats/poemsalpha.html|title=Yeats Poems Titles|website=Csun.edu|accessdate=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.csun.edu/~hceng029/yeats/yeatspoems/GiftOfHarun |title=Archived copy |access-date=16 March 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008075736/http://www.csun.edu/~hceng029/yeats/yeatspoems/GiftOfHarun |archive-date=8 October 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Harun al-Rashid is celebrated.
* A story of one of Harun's wanderings provides the climax to the narrative game of titles at the end of [[Italo Calvino]]'s ''[[If on a winter's night a traveler]]'' (1979). In Calvino's story, Harun wanders at night, only to be drawn into a conspiracy in which he is selected to assassinate the Caliph Harun-al-Rashid.
*In ''[[Charles Dickens|Charles Dickens']]'' 1842 [[Travel literature|travelogue]], ''[[American Notes|American Notes for General Circulation]]'', he compares American supporters of slavery to the "Caliph Harun al-Rashid in his angry robe of scarlet".
*The two protagonists of [[Salman Rushdie]]'s 1990 novel ''[[Haroun and the Sea of Stories]]'' are Haroun and his father Rashid Khalifa.
*In the [[The Sten Chronicles|Sten]] science fiction novels by [[Allan Cole]] and [[Chris Bunch]], the character of the Eternal Emperor uses the name "H. E. Raschid" when incognito; this is confirmed, in the final book of the series, as a reference to the character from [[Richard Francis Burton|Burton]]'s translation of ''The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night''.
*In [[Roald Dahl]]'s story ''[[The BFG]]'', the Sultan of Baghdad says he had an uncle called Caliph Harun al-Rashid who disappeared with his wife and ten children.
*The movie ''[[The Golden Blade]]'' (1952), starring [[Rock Hudson]] and [[Piper Laurie]] depicts the adventures of ''Harun'' who uses a [[magic sword]] to free a [[fairy-tale]] Baghdad from Jafar, the evil usurper of the throne. After he finally wins the hand of princess Khairuzan she awards him the title Al-Rashid ("the righteous").
*The [[comic book]] ''[[The Sandman (DC Comics Modern Age)|The Sandman]]'' features a story (issue 50, "Ramadan") set in the world of the ''One Thousand and One Nights'', with Hārūn ar-Rashīd as the protagonist. It highlights his historical and mythical role as well as his discussion of the transitory nature of power. The story is included in the collection ''[[The Sandman: Fables and Reflections]]''.
*[[Haroun El Poussah]] in the French [[comics|comic]] strip ''[[Iznogoud]]'' is a satirical version of Hārūn ar-Rashīd.
*In ''[[Quest for Glory II]]'', the sultan who adopts [[Hero (Quest for Glory)|the Hero]] as his son is named Hārūn ar-Rashīd. He is often seen prophesying on the streets of Shapeir as The Poet Omar.
*Harun al-Rashid appears as the leader of Arabia in the video game ''[[Civilization 5]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zacny |first=Rob |title=Civilization V Field Report 2 |url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/217737/civilization-v-field-report-2 |publisher=GamePro |date=December 24, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106162336/http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/217737/civilization-v-field-report-2 |archivedate=6 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Future US President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], when he was a [[New York Police Department]] Commissioner, was called in the local newspapers "Haroun-al-Roosevelt".
*In ''[[The Master and Margarita]]'', by novelist [[Mikhail Bulgakov]], Harun al-Rashid is referenced by the character Korovyev in which he warns a door man not to judge him "by [his] suit," and to reference the story of "the famous caliph, Harun al-Rashid".
*In the 1924 film ''[[Waxworks (film)|Waxworks]]'', a poet is hired by a wax museum proprietor to write back-stories for three wax models. Among these wax models is Harun al-Rashid, played by [[Emil Jannings]].
*In the 2006 novel ''[[Variable Star]]'' by [[Robert Heinlein]] and [[Spider Robinson]], chapter 1 is prefaced with a quotation from Alfred, Lord Tennyson's "Recollections of the Arabian Nights" regarding "good Harun Alrashid," the relevance of which becomes apparent in chapter 2 when one character relates stories (probably apocryphal and presumably drawn from Tennyson) of Harun al-Rahsid to another character in order to use them as an analogy.
*The second chapter in the novel ''[[Prince Otto]]'' by [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] has the title "In which the Prince Plays Haroun al-Raschid".
*Haroun al-Rashid has a character page in the video game ''[[Crusader Kings II]]'', and it is possible to play as his descendants of the [[Abbasid dynasty]].
*Harun al-Rashid is mentioned in passing by the character Madame de Villefort in [[Alexandre Dumas]]'s novel ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'' as an example of how different cultures react to poisoners.
*Harun al-Rashid appears on the children's comic book ''[[Mampato]]'', in the stories "Bromiznar de Bagdad" and "Ábrete Sesamo", by the Chilean author ''[[Themo Lobos]]''. In this story, al-Rashid is shown at first as lazy and indolent, but after a series of adventures he decides to take the leading role against an evil Visir and help the main character, Mampato.
*[[Frank Lloyd Wright]] designed a monument to al-Rashid as part of his proposed 1957 urban renewal plan for [[Baghdad, Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Urbanism-Frank-Lloyd-Wright/dp/0691167532/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1457631810&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=urbanism+frank+levine|title=The Urbanism of Frank Lloyd Wright|first=Neil|last=Levine|date=1 December 2015|publisher=Princeton University Press|accessdate=1 September 2018|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Jeanne Eagels''''' (also titled '''''The Jeanne Eagels Story''''') is a 1957 American [[biographical film]] loosely based on the life of stage star [[Jeanne Eagels]]. Distributed by [[Columbia Pictures]], the film was produced and directed by [[George Sidney]] from a [[screenplay]] by [[John Fante]], [[Daniel Fuchs]] and [[Sonya Levien]], based on a story by Fuchs.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Variety Film Reviews|Variety]]'' film review; July 24, 1957, page 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Harrison's Reports and Film Reviews|Harrison's Reports]]'' film review; July 20, 1957, page 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film stars [[Kim Novak]] in the title role. [[Jeff Chandler (actor)|Jeff Chandler]], [[Charles Drake (actor)|Charles Drake]], [[Agnes Moorehead]], [[Larry Gates]], [[Virginia Grey]], [[Gene Lockhart]] and [[Murray Hamilton]] co-star.

Many aspects of Eagels' real life were omitted or largely fictionalized. Eagels' family later sued Columbia Pictures over the way Eagels was depicted in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/97099/Jeanne-Eagels/overview|title=Jeanne Eagels (1957)|last=Erickson|first=Hal|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=January 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Jeanne Eagels is a Kansas City waitress. After losing a carnival's beauty contest, she asks carny owner Sal Satori for a job. Her dancing in a skimpy costume is accused of being obscene. Sal decides to join his brother in New York and invites Jeanne to join them in an amusement park at [[Coney Island]].

Taking acting lessons instead, the ambitious Jeanne becomes the understudy in a Broadway show and a star when she gets a chance to play the part. A once successful actress named Elsie Desmond wants to make a comeback in a new play, but Jeanne betrays her and takes the play for herself, willing to do anything to get ahead. Elsie denounces her in the theater before the first performance, then commits suicide. Sal is disgusted by Jeanne's behavior as well. She accepts a proposal from a ne'er-do-well named John Donahue, but both descend into alcoholism. Jeanne misses performances and causes fellow actors to lose out on paychecks.

Her situation deteriorates further when she's required to pay alimony to John after a divorce. A new play fails because Jeanne, drunk and on pills, collapses on stage. The actors' guild suspends her for 18 months. Unable to work, she returns to Sal's amusement park and is offered a job dancing. Another performer sexually assaults her in a dressing room. Jeanne, her life in ruins, continues to spiral downward and hallucinate. While trying to make it to a stage one night, she collapses on the staircase and dies.

[[File:CharlesDodgson.jpg|thumb|alt=Photographic portrait of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (Lewis Carroll), seated and holding a book|Lewis Carroll]]

'''Charles Lutwidge Dodgson''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ʌ|t|w|ɪ|dʒ|_|ˈ|d|ɒ|dʒ|s|ən}}; 27 January 1832 – 14 January 1898), better known by his [[pen name]] '''Lewis Carroll''', was an [[List of English writers|English writer]] of world-famous children's fiction, notably ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' and its sequel ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]''. He was noted for his facility at [[word play]], logic and fantasy. The poems ''[[Jabberwocky]]'' and ''[[The Hunting of the Snark]]'' are classified in the genre of [[literary nonsense]]. He was also a [[mathematician]], [[photographer]] and Anglican [[deacon]].

Carroll came from a family of [[high church]] Anglicans, and developed a long relationship with [[Christ Church, Oxford]], where he lived for most of his life as a scholar and teacher. Alice Liddell, daughter of the Dean of Christ Church, [[Henry Liddell]], is widely identified as the original for ''Alice in Wonderland'', though Carroll always denied this.

==Background and early life==
Dodgson's family was predominantly [[Northern England|northern English]] (with [[Irish people|Irish]] connections), conservative and [[high church]] Anglican. Most of Dodgson's male ancestors were army officers or [[Church of England]] clergy. His great-grandfather, also named [[Charles Dodgson (bishop)|Charles Dodgson]], had risen through the ranks of the church to become the [[Bishop of Elphin]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Clark|Clark]], p.&amp;nbsp;10&lt;/ref&gt;  His paternal grandfather, another Charles, had been an army captain, killed in action in Ireland in 1803 when his two sons were hardly more than babies.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Collingwood|Collingwood]], pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; The older of these sons – yet another [[Charles Dodgson (priest)|Charles Dodgson]] – was Carroll's father. He went to [[Westminster School]] and then to [[Christ Church, Oxford]].  He reverted to the other family tradition and took [[holy orders]].  He was mathematically gifted and won a [[double first]] degree, which could have been the prelude to a brilliant academic career. Instead, he married his first cousin Frances Jane Lutwidge&lt;ref&gt;[[#Collingwood|Collingwood]], p.&amp;nbsp;8&lt;/ref&gt; in 1830 and became a country [[parson]].&lt;ref name="kqihew"&gt;[[#Cohen|Cohen]], pp. 30–35&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lewis Carroll's birthplace - geograph.org.uk - 40.jpg|thumb|Carroll's birthplace]]
Dodgson was born in the small parsonage at [[Daresbury]] in [[Cheshire]] near the towns of [[Warrington]] and [[Runcorn]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://g.co/maps/cp7d5|title=Google map of Daresbury, UK|accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the eldest boy but already the third child. Eight more children followed. When Charles was 11, his father was given the [[Benefice#Church of England|living]] of [[Croft-on-Tees]] in North [[Yorkshire]], and the whole family moved to the spacious rectory. This remained their home for the next 25 years.

Charles's father was an active and highly conservative cleric of the [[Church of England]] who later became the [[Archdeacon of Richmond]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Dodgson.html|title=Charles Lutwidge Dodgson|work=The MacTutor History of Mathematics archive|accessdate=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and involved himself, sometimes influentially, in the intense religious disputes that were dividing the church. He was [[high church]], inclining toward [[Anglo-Catholicism]], an admirer of [[John Henry Newman]] and the [[Tractarian movement]], and did his best to instil such views in his children. Young Charles was to develop an ambiguous relationship with his father's values and with the Church of England as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cohen|Cohen]], pp. 200–202&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
[[File:Lewis Carroll Self Portrait 1856 circa.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Photographic portrait of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (Lewis Carroll), seated and holding a book|Lewis Carroll self-portrait c. 1856]]

===Home life===
During his early youth, Dodgson was educated at home. His "reading lists" preserved in the family archives testify to a precocious intellect: at the age of seven, he was reading books such as ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]''. He also suffered from a [[Stuttering|stammer]] – a condition shared by most of his siblings&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cohen|Cohen]], p.&amp;nbsp;4&lt;/ref&gt; – that often influenced his social life throughout his years. At the age of twelve, he was sent to Richmond Grammar School (now part of [[Richmond School]]) at nearby [[Richmond, North Yorkshire|Richmond]].

===Rugby===
In 1846, Dodgson entered [[Rugby School]] where he was evidently unhappy, as he wrote some years after leaving:
{{quote|I cannot say ... that any earthly considerations would induce me to go through my three years again ... I can honestly say that if I could have been ... secure from annoyance at night, the hardships of the daily life would have been comparative trifles to bear.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Collingwood|Collingwood]], pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Dodgson did not claim he suffered from bullying but cited little boys as the main targets of older bullies at Rugby.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Mystery of Lewis Carroll: Discovering the Whimsical, Thoughtful, and Sometimes Lonely Man Who Created "Alice in Wonderland"|last=Woolf|first=Jenny|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=2010|isbn=9780312612986|location=New York|pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart Dodgson Collingwood, who was Dodgson's nephew, wrote that "even though it is hard for those who have only known him as the gentle and retiring don to believe it, it is nevertheless true that long after he left school, his name was remembered as that of a boy who knew well how to use his fists in defense of a righteous cause", which is the protection of the smaller boys.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Scholastically, though, he excelled with apparent ease. "I have not had a more promising boy at his age since I came to Rugby", observed mathematics master R. B. Mayor.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Collingwood|Collingwood]], p.&amp;nbsp;29&lt;/ref&gt; Francis Walkingame's ''The Tutor's Assistant; Being a Compendium of Arithmetic'' – the mathematics textbook that the young Dodgson used – still survives and it contained an inscription in [[Latin]], which translates to: "This book belongs to Charles Lutwidge Dodgson: hands off!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rediscovered Lewis Carroll Puzzles|first=Lewis|last=Carroll|editor-first1=Edward|editor-last1=Wakeling|publisher=[[Dover Publications]]|location=New York City|date=1995|isbn=0486288617|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some pages also included annotations such as the one found in p.&amp;nbsp;129, where he wrote "Not a fair question in decimals" next to a question.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Charlie|last=Lovett|title=Lewis Carroll Among His Books: A Descriptive Catalogue of the Private Library of Charles L. Dodgson|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., Publishers|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|date=2005|isbn=0786421053|pages=329}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oxford===
He left Rugby at the end of 1849 and [[matriculation|matriculated]] at the [[University of Oxford]] in May 1850 as a member of his father's old college, [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Clark|Clark]], pp. 63–64&lt;/ref&gt;  After waiting for rooms in college to become available, he went into residence in January 1851.&lt;ref name=clark6465&gt;[[#Clark|Clark]], pp. 64–65&lt;/ref&gt;  He had been at Oxford only two days when he received a summons home. His mother had died of "inflammation of the brain" – perhaps [[meningitis]] or a stroke – at the age of 47.&lt;ref name=clark6465/&gt;

His early academic career veered between high promise and irresistible distraction. He did not always work hard but was exceptionally gifted and achievement came easily to him. In 1852, he obtained [[first-class honours]] in Mathematics [[Moderations]] and was shortly thereafter nominated to a [[Studentship]] by his father's old friend Canon [[Edward Pusey]].&lt;ref name=collingwood52&gt;[[#Collingwood|Collingwood]], p.&amp;nbsp;52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=clark74&gt;[[#Clark|Clark]], p.&amp;nbsp;74&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1854, he obtained first-class honours in the Final Honours School of Mathematics, standing first on the list, graduating [[Bachelor of Arts]].&lt;ref name=collingwood57&gt;[[#Collingwood|Collingwood]], p.&amp;nbsp;57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wilson&gt;[[#Wilson|Wilson]], p.&amp;nbsp;51&lt;/ref&gt;  He remained at Christ Church studying and teaching, but the next year he failed an important scholarship through his self-confessed inability to apply himself to study.&lt;ref name=cohen51&gt;[[#Cohen|Cohen]], p.&amp;nbsp;51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=clark79&gt;[[#Clark|Clark]], p.&amp;nbsp;79&lt;/ref&gt;  Even so, his talent as a mathematician won him the Christ Church Mathematical Lectureship in 1855,&lt;ref name=frw41&gt;{{cite book | title=Mathematics in Victorian Britain | first1=Raymond |last1=Flood | first2=Adrian |last2=Rice | first3=Robin |last3=Wilson | author3-link=Robin Wilson (mathematician) | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | location=Oxfordshire, England|date=2011 | isbn=0-19-960139-9 |oclc=721931689 | page=41 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which he continued to hold for the next 26 years.&lt;ref name=cohen414-6&gt;[[#Cohen|Cohen]], pp. 414–416&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite early unhappiness, Dodgson was to remain at Christ Church, in various capacities, until his death, including that of Sub-Librarian of the Christ Church library, where his office was close to the Deanery, where Alice Liddell lived.&lt;ref name = "ekfvyz"&gt;[[#Leach|Leach]], Ch. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character and appearance==
[[File:Lewis Carroll 1863.jpg|thumb|1863 photograph by [[Oscar G. Rejlander]]]]

===Health problems===
The young adult Charles Dodgson was about {{convert|6|ft|2}} tall and slender, and he had curly brown hair and blue or grey eyes (depending on the account). He was described in later life as somewhat [[asymmetry|asymmetrical]], and as carrying himself rather stiffly and awkwardly, although this might be on account of a knee injury sustained in middle age. As a very young child, he suffered a fever that left him deaf in one ear. At the age of 17, he suffered a severe attack of [[Pertussis|whooping cough]], which was probably responsible for his chronically weak chest in later life. Another defect which he carried into adulthood was what he referred to as his "hesitation", a [[Stuttering|stammer]] that he acquired in early childhood and which plagued him throughout his life.&lt;ref name = "ekfvyz"/&gt;

The stammer has always been a significant part of the image of Dodgson. It is said that he stammered only in adult company and was free and fluent with children, but there is no evidence to support this idea.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Leach|Leach]], p.&amp;nbsp;91&lt;/ref&gt; Many children of his acquaintance remembered the stammer, while many adults failed to notice it. Dodgson himself seems to have been far more acutely aware of it than most people whom he met; it is said that he caricatured himself as the [[Dodo (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Dodo]] in ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'', referring to his difficulty in pronouncing his last name, but this is one of the many "facts" often repeated for which no first-hand evidence remains. He did indeed refer to himself as the dodo, but whether or not this reference was to his stammer is simply speculation.&lt;ref name = "ekfvyz"/&gt;

Dodgson's stammer did trouble him, but it was never so debilitating that it prevented him from applying his other personal qualities to do well in society. He lived in a time when people commonly devised their own amusements and when singing and recitation were required social skills, and the young Dodgson was well equipped to be an engaging entertainer. He reportedly could sing tolerably well and was not afraid to do so before an audience. He was adept at mimicry and storytelling, and was reputedly quite good at [[charades]].&lt;ref name="ekfvyz"/&gt;

===Social connections===
In the interim between his early published writings and the success of the ''Alice'' books, Dodgson began to move in the [[pre-Raphaelite]] social circle. He first met [[John Ruskin]] in 1857 and became friendly with him. He developed a close relationship with [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and his family, and also knew [[William Holman Hunt]], [[John Everett Millais]], and [[Arthur Hughes (artist)|Arthur Hughes]], among other artists. He knew fairy-tale author [[George MacDonald]] well – it was the enthusiastic reception of ''Alice'' by the young MacDonald children that persuaded him to submit the work for publication.&lt;ref name="ekfvyz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="snaogq"&gt;[[#Cohen|Cohen]], pp. 100–4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics, religion, and philosophy===
In broad terms, Dodgson has traditionally been regarded as politically, religiously, and personally conservative. [[Martin Gardner]] labels Dodgson as a [[Tory]] who was "awed by lords and inclined to be snobbish towards inferiors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to The annotated Alice: Alice's adventures in Wonderland &amp; Through the looking glass|last=Gardner|first=Martin|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|year=2000|page=xv|isbn=0-517-02962-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Tuckwell|The Reverend W. Tuckwell]], in his ''Reminiscences of Oxford'' (1900), regarded him as "austere, shy, precise, absorbed in mathematical reverie, watchfully tenacious of his dignity, stiffly conservative in political, theological, social theory, his life mapped out in squares like Alice's landscape."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Introduction to Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass | last = Gardner | first = Martin | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2009 | page = xvi | isbn = 0-517-02962-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dodgson was ordained a deacon in the Church of England on 22 December 1861. In ''The Life and Letters of Lewis Carroll'', the editor states that "his Diary is full of such modest depreciations of himself and his work, interspersed with earnest prayers (too sacred and private to be reproduced here) that God would forgive him the past, and help him to perform His holy will in the future."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Collingwood|Collingwood]]&lt;/ref&gt; When a friend asked him about his religious views, Dodgson wrote in response that he was a member of the Church of England, but "doubt[ed] if he was fully a 'High Churchman'". He added:
{{Quote|I believe that when you and I come to lie down for the last time, if only we can keep firm hold of the great truths Christ taught us—our own utter worthlessness and His infinite worth; and that He has brought us back to our one Father, and made us His brethren, and so brethren to one another—we shall have all we need to guide us through the shadows. Most assuredly I accept to the full the doctrines you refer to—that Christ died to save us, that we have no other way of salvation open to us but through His death, and that it is by faith in Him, and through no merit of ours, that we are reconciled to God; and most assuredly I can cordially say, "I owe all to Him who loved me, and died on the Cross of Calvary."|Carroll (1897)&lt;ref&gt;[[#Collingwood|Collingwood]], Chapter IX&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Dodgson also expressed interest in other fields. He was an early member of the [[Society for Psychical Research]], and one of his letters suggests that he accepted as real what was then called "thought reading".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Society for Psychical Research, 1882–1982 A History | last = Hayness | first = Rene&amp;#769;e | publisher = Macdonald &amp; Co | place = London | year = 1982 | isbn = 0-356-07875-2 | pages = 13–14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dodgson wrote some studies of various philosophical arguments. In 1895, he developed a philosophical regressus-argument on deductive reasoning in his article "[[What the Tortoise Said to Achilles]]", which appeared in one of the early volumes of ''Mind''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/mind/IV.14.278| title = What the Tortoise Said to Achilles| journal = Mind| issue = 14| pages = 278| year = 1895| last1 = Carroll | first1 = L. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The article was reprinted in the same journal a hundred years later in 1995, with a subsequent article by [[Simon Blackburn]] titled "Practical Tortoise Raising".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/mind/104.416.695| title = Practical Tortoise Raising| journal = Mind| volume = 104| issue = 416| pages = 695| year = 1995| last1 = Blackburn | first1 = S. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic activities==

===Literature===
From a young age, Dodgson wrote poetry and short stories, contributing heavily to the family magazine ''[[Mischmasch]]'' and later sending them to various magazines, enjoying moderate success. Between 1854 and 1856, his work appeared in the national publications ''The Comic Times'' and ''The Train'', as well as smaller magazines such as the ''[[Whitby Gazette]]'' and the ''Oxford Critic''. Most of this output was humorous, sometimes satirical, but his standards and ambitions were exacting. "I do not think I have yet written anything worthy of real publication (in which I do not include the ''Whitby Gazette'' or the ''Oxonian Advertiser''), but I do not despair of doing so some day," he wrote in July 1855.&lt;ref name = "ekfvyz"/&gt; Sometime after 1850, he did write [[marionette|puppet]] plays for his siblings' entertainment, of which one has survived: ''La Guida di Bragia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title=La Guida Di Bragia, a Ballad Opera for the Marionette Theatre| publisher=Lewis Carroll Society of North America| year=2007| chapter=Introduction| first=Peter L. |last=Heath| pages=vii–xvi| isbn=0-930326-15-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1856, he published his first piece of work under the name that would make him famous. A romantic poem called "Solitude" appeared in ''The Train'' under the authorship of "Lewis Carroll". This pseudonym was a play on his real name: ''Lewis'' was the anglicised form of ''Ludovicus'', which was the Latin for ''Lutwidge'', and ''Carroll'' an Irish surname similar to the Latin name ''Carolus'', from which comes the name ''Charles''.&lt;ref name = "kqihew"/&gt; The transition went as follows:
"Charles Lutwidge" translated into Latin as "Carolus Ludovicus". This was then translated back into English as "Carroll Lewis" and then reversed to make "Lewis Carroll".&lt;ref&gt;Roger Lancelyn Green [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/97087/Lewis-Carroll On-line Encyclopædia Britannica ]&lt;/ref&gt; This pseudonym was chosen by editor Edmund Yates from a list of four submitted by Dodgson, the others being Edgar Cuthwellis, Edgar U. C. Westhill, and Louis Carroll.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p.&amp;nbsp;129&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Alice'' books====
[[File:Alice par John Tenniel 30.png|thumb|alt=Illustration of Alice holding a Flamingo, standing with one foot on a curled-up hedgehog with another hedgehog walking away|"The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo". Illustration by [[John Tenniel]], 1865.]]
[[File:Jabberwocky.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Illustration of a child with a sword facing a fearsome winged dragon in a forest|''The Jabberwock'', as illustrated by [[John Tenniel]] for Lewis Carroll's ''Through the Looking-Glass'', including the poem "[[Jabberwocky]]".]]

In 1856, Dean (i.e., head of the college) [[Henry Liddell]] arrived at [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]], bringing with him his young family, all of whom would figure largely in Dodgson's life over the following years, and would greatly influence his writing career. Dodgson became close friends with Liddell's wife Lorina and their children, particularly the three sisters Lorina, Edith, and Alice Liddell. He was widely assumed for many years to have derived his own "Alice" from [[Alice Liddell]]; the [[acrostic]] poem at the end of ''Through the Looking-Glass'' spells out her name in full, and there are also many superficial references to her hidden in the text of both books. It has been noted that Dodgson himself repeatedly denied in later life that his "little heroine" was based on any real child,&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Morton N. (ed) (1979) ''The Letters of Lewis Carroll'', London: Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nbrhxm"&gt;[[#Leach|Leach]], Ch. 5 "The Unreal Alice"&lt;/ref&gt; and he frequently dedicated his works to girls of his acquaintance, adding their names in acrostic poems at the beginning of the text. [[Gertrude Chataway]]'s name appears in this form at the beginning of ''[[The Hunting of the Snark]]'', and it is not suggested that this means that any of the characters in the narrative are based on her.&lt;ref name="nbrhxm"/&gt;

Information is scarce (Dodgson's diaries for the years 1858–1862 are missing), but it seems clear that his friendship with the Liddell family was an important part of his life in the late 1850s, and he grew into the habit of taking the children on rowing trips (first the boy Harry, and later the three girls) accompanied by an adult friend&lt;ref name="Winchester"&gt;{{cite book| title=The Alice Behind Wonderland

}}&lt;/ref&gt; to nearby [[Nuneham Courtenay]] or [[Godstow]].&lt;ref name="ulsdnc"&gt;[[#Leach|Leach]], Ch. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

It was on one such expedition on 4 July 1862 that Dodgson invented the outline of the story that eventually became his first and greatest commercial success. He told the story to Alice Liddell and she begged him to write it down, and Dodgson eventually (after much delay) presented her with a handwritten, illustrated manuscript entitled ''Alice's Adventures Under Ground'' in November 1864.&lt;ref name="ulsdnc"/&gt;

Before this, the family of friend and mentor [[George MacDonald]] read Dodgson's incomplete manuscript, and the enthusiasm of the MacDonald children encouraged Dodgson to seek publication. In 1863, he had taken the unfinished manuscript to Macmillan the publisher, who liked it immediately. After the possible alternative titles were rejected – ''Alice Among the Fairies'' and ''Alice's Golden Hour'' – the work was finally published as ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' in 1865 under the Lewis Carroll pen-name, which Dodgson had first used some nine years earlier.&lt;ref name="snaogq" /&gt; The illustrations this time were by [[John Tenniel|Sir John Tenniel]]; Dodgson evidently thought that a published book would need the skills of a professional artist. Annotated versions provide insights into many of the ideas and hidden meanings that are prevalent in these books.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, Martin (2000). "The Annotated Alice. The definitive Edition". New York: W.W. Norton.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heath, Peter (1974). "The Philosopher's Alice". New York: St. Martin's Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Critical literature has often proposed [[Freudian]] interpretations of the book as "a descent into the dark world of the [[subconscious]]", as well as seeing it as a satire upon contemporary mathematical advances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/07/opinion/07bayley.html|title=Algebra in Wonderland|date=7 March 2010|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20427391-600-alices-adventures-in-algebra-wonderland-solved/|title=Alice's adventures in algebra: Wonderland solved|first=Melanie|last=Bayley|work=[[New Scientist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The overwhelming commercial success of the first Alice book changed Dodgson's life in many ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The big book of beastly mispronunciations: the complete opinionated guide for the careful speaker | first=Charles Harrington | last=Elster | authorlink=Charles Harrington Elster | publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt | year=2006 | isbn=061842315X | pages=158–159 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YtojrMr0Ft4C&amp;pg=PA158 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Unpronounceables: Difficult Literary Names 1500–1940 | last=Emerson | first=R.

He was inundated with fan mail and with sometimes unwanted attention. Indeed, according to one popular story, [[Queen Victoria]] herself enjoyed ''Alice in Wonderland'' so much that she commanded that he dedicate his next book to her, and was accordingly presented with his next work, a scholarly mathematical volume entitled ''An Elementary Treatise on Determinants''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wilson|Wilson]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hhgg&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A4462670 |title=Lewis Carroll – Logician, Nonsense Writer, Mathematician and Photographer |publisher=BBC  |work=The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy |date=26 August 2005 |accessdate=12 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dodgson himself vehemently denied this story, commenting "...&amp;nbsp;It is utterly false in every particular: nothing even resembling it has occurred";&lt;ref name=hhgg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dodgson |first=Charles |title=Symbolic Logic |year=1896}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is unlikely for other reasons. As [[Thomas Strong (bishop)|T. B. Strong]] comments in a ''[[The Times|Times]]'' article, "It would have been clean contrary to all his practice to identify [the] author of Alice with the author of his mathematical works".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mr. Dodgson: Lewis Carroll at Oxford |first=T. B. |last=Strong |newspaper=[The Times] |date=27 January 1932}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/language/literary/carroll.asp |title=Fit for a Queen |publisher=Snopes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also began earning quite substantial sums of money but continued with his seemingly disliked post at Christ Church.&lt;ref name="snaogq"/&gt;

Late in 1871, he published the sequel ''[[Through the Looking-Glass|Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There]]''. (The title page of the first edition erroneously gives "1872" as the date of publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cohen |first=Morton |title=Introduction to "Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass"|publisher=[[Random House]] |date=24 June 2009 |isbn=978-0-553-21345-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Its somewhat darker mood possibly reflects changes in Dodgson's life. His father's death in 1868 plunged him into a depression that lasted some years.&lt;ref name="snaogq"/&gt;

====''The Hunting of the Snark''====
In 1876, Dodgson produced his next great work, ''[[The Hunting of the Snark]]'', a fantastical "nonsense" poem exploring the adventures of a bizarre crew of nine tradesmen and one beaver, who set off to find the snark. It received largely mixed reviews from Carroll's contemporary reviewers,&lt;ref name="Hark the Snark"&gt;{{cite book|title=Lewis Carroll Observed|editor=Guilano, Edward|author=Cohen, Morton N.|year=1976|chapter=Hark the Snark|publisher=Clarkson N.

====''Sylvie and Bruno''====
In 1895, 30 years after publication of his masterpieces, Carroll attempted a comeback, producing a two-volume tale of the fairy siblings [[Sylvie and Bruno]]. Carroll entwines two plots set in two alternative worlds, one set in rural England and the other in the fairytale kingdoms of Elfland, Outland, and others. The fairytale world satirizes English society, and more specifically the world of academia. ''Sylvie and Bruno'' came out in two volumes and is considered a lesser work, although it has remained in print for over a century.

===Photography (1856–1880) ===
[[File:Alice Liddell 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.75|Photo of [[Alice Liddell]] taken by Lewis Carroll (1858)]]

In 1856, Dodgson took up the new art form of photography under the influence first of his uncle [[Robert Wilfred Skeffington Lutwidge|Skeffington Lutwidge]], and later of his Oxford friend [[Reginald Southey]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Clark|Clark]], p.&amp;nbsp;93&lt;/ref&gt; He soon excelled at the art and became a well-known gentleman-photographer, and he seems even to have toyed with the idea of making a living out of it in his very early years.&lt;ref name = "snaogq"/&gt;

A study by Roger Taylor and Edward Wakeling exhaustively lists every surviving print, and Taylor calculates that just over half of his surviving work depicts young girls, though about 60% of his original photographic portfolio is now missing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Taylor |first=Roger |last2=Wakeling |first2=Edward |title=Lewis Carroll, Photographer |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |date=25 February 2002 |isbn=978-0-691-07443-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dodgson also made many studies of men, women, boys, and landscapes; his subjects also include skeletons, dolls, dogs, statues, paintings, and trees.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Morton (1999). "Reflections in a Looking Glass." New York: Aperture.&lt;/ref&gt; His pictures of children were taken with a parent in attendance and many of the pictures were taken in the Liddell garden because natural sunlight was required for good exposures.&lt;ref name="Winchester"/&gt;

He also found photography to be a useful entrée into higher social circles.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p.&amp;nbsp;116&lt;/ref&gt; During the most productive part of his career, he made portraits of notable sitters such as [[John Everett Millais]], [[Ellen Terry]], [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], [[Julia Margaret Cameron]], [[Michael Faraday]], [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]], and [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Alfred Tennyson]].&lt;ref name = "snaogq"/&gt;

By the time that Dodgson abruptly ceased photography (1880, over 24 years), he had established his own studio on the roof of [[Tom Quad]], created around 3,000 images, and was an amateur master of the medium, though fewer than 1,000 images have survived time and deliberate destruction. He stopped taking photographs because keeping his studio working was too time-consuming.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p.&amp;nbsp;265&lt;/ref&gt; He used the [[Collodion|wet collodion process]]; commercial photographers who started using the [[Dry-plate photography#Popularization|dry-plate process]] in the 1870s took pictures more quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Wakeling |first=Edward |title=An Exhibition From the Jon A. Lindseth Collection of C. L. Dodgson and Lewis Carroll |place=New York, NY |publisher=The Grolier Club |year=1998 |chapter=Lewis Carroll's Photography |pages=55–67 |isbn=0-910672-23-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular taste changed with the advent of [[Modernism]], affecting the types of photographs that he produced.

===Inventions===
To promote letter writing, Dodgson invented "The Wonderland Postage-Stamp Case" in 1889. This was a cloth-backed folder with twelve slots, two marked for inserting the most commonly used penny stamp, and one each for the other current denominations up to one shilling. The folder was then put into a slipcase decorated with a picture of Alice on the front and the [[Cheshire Cat]] on the back.  It intended to organize stamps wherever one stored their writing utensils; Carroll expressly notes in ''[[Eight or Nine Wise Words about Letter-Writing|Eight or Nine Wise Words About Letter-Writing]]'' it is not intended to be carried in a pocket or purse, as the most common individual stamps could easily be carried on their own.  The pack included a copy of a pamphletted version of this lecture.&lt;ref&gt;Flodden W. Heron, "Lewis Carroll, Inventor of Postage Stamp Case" in ''Stamps'', vol. 26, no. 12, 25 March 1939&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lewiscarrollsociety.org.uk/pages/eventspeopleplaces/inspired/stamps.html |title=Carroll Related Stamps |publisher=The Lewis Carroll Society |date=28 April 2005 |accessdate=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nyctograph reconstruction.jpg|thumb|right|Reconstructed nyctograph, with scale demonstrated by a 5 [[euro]] cent.]]
Another invention was a writing tablet called the [[nyctograph]] that allowed note-taking in the dark, thus eliminating the need to get out of bed and strike a light when one woke with an idea. The device consisted of a gridded card with sixteen squares and system of symbols representing an alphabet of Dodgson's design, using letter shapes similar to the [[Graffiti (Palm OS)|Graffiti]] writing system on a [[Palm (PDA)|Palm]] device.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Everson|Everson, Michael]].

Foreword by Alan Tannenbaum, Éire: Cathair na Mart. {{ISBN|978-1-904808-78-7}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

He also devised a number of games, including an early version of what today is known as [[Scrabble]]. He appears to have invented – or at least certainly popularized – the "doublet" (see [[word ladder]]), a form of brain-teaser that is still popular today, changing one word into another by altering one letter at a time, each successive change always resulting in a genuine word. For instance, CAT is transformed into DOG by the following steps: CAT, COT, DOT, DOG.&lt;ref name = "snaogq"/&gt; The games and puzzles of Lewis Carroll were the subject of Martin Gardner's March 1960 [[Mathematical Games column]] in Scientific American.

Other items include a rule for finding the day of the week for any date; a means for justifying right margins on a typewriter; a steering device for a velociam (a type of tricycle); new systems of parliamentary representation;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PN1dAAAACAAJ|title=A Mathematical Approach to Proportional Representation |last=Black |first=Duncan |last2=McLean|first2= Iain|last3= McMillan|first3= Alistair|last4= Monroe|first4= Burt L.|last5= Dodgson|first5= Charles Lutwidge |isbn=978-0-7923-9620-8|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; more fair elimination rules for tennis tournaments; a new sort of postal money order; rules for reckoning postage; rules for a win in betting; rules for dividing a number by various divisors; a cardboard scale for the [[Senior Common Room]] at Christ Church which, held next to a glass, ensured the right amount of liqueur for the price paid; a double-sided adhesive strip to fasten envelopes or mount things in books; a device for helping a bedridden invalid to read from a book placed sideways; and at least two [[cipher]]s for [[cryptography]].&lt;ref name = "snaogq"/&gt;

Within the academic discipline of mathematics, Dodgson worked primarily in the fields of [[geometry]], linear and [[matrix algebra]], [[mathematical logic]], and [[recreational mathematics]], producing nearly a dozen books under his real name. Dodgson also developed new ideas in linear algebra (e.g., the first printed proof of the [[Rouché–Capelli theorem|Kronecker–Capelli theorem]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Seneta, Eugene|year=1984|title= Lewis Carroll as a Probabilist and Mathematician|url=http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/eseneta/l.carroll.1984.pdf|journal=Mathematical Scientist|volume=9|pages= 79–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abeles, Francine F.

His occupation as Mathematical Lecturer at Christ Church gave him some financial security.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wilson|Wilson]], p.&amp;nbsp;61&lt;/ref&gt;

His mathematical work attracted renewed interest in the late 20th century. Martin Gardner's book on logic machines and diagrams and William Warren Bartley's posthumous publication of the second part of Carroll's symbolic logic book have sparked a reevaluation of Carroll's contributions to symbolic logic.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, Martin.

The algorithm known as [[Dodgson condensation]] is closely related to the [[Schur complement]] and the Desnanot-Jacobi identity.

The discovery in the 1990s of additional ciphers that Carroll had constructed, in addition to his "Memoria Technica", showed that he had employed sophisticated mathematical ideas in their creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.aam.2004.06.006| title = Lewis Carroll's ciphers: The literary connections| journal = Advances in Applied Mathematics| volume = 34| issue = 4| pages = 697| year = 2005| last1 = Abeles | first1 = F.

==Correspondence==
Dodgson wrote and received as many as 98,721 letters, according to a special letter register which he devised. He documented his advice about how to write more satisfying letters in a missive entitled "Eight or Nine Wise Words About Letter-Writing".&lt;ref name="Clark-D"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/uni/summary/v034/34.2.clark.html | title=The Place of Lewis Carroll in Children's Literature (review) | last=Clark|first= Dorothy G. | journal=The Lion and the Unicorn |date=April 2010 | volume=34 | issue=2 | pages=253–258 | doi=10.1353/uni.0.0495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dodgson's existence remained little changed over the last twenty years of his life, despite his growing wealth and fame. He continued to teach at Christ Church until 1881 and remained in residence there until his death. The two volumes of his last novel, ''[[Sylvie and Bruno]]'', were published in 1889 and 1893, but the intricacy of this work was apparently not appreciated by contemporary readers; it achieved nothing like the success of the ''Alice'' books, with disappointing reviews and sales of only 13,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;Angelica Shirley Carpenter (2002).

The only known occasion on which he travelled abroad was a trip to Russia in 1867 as an ecclesiastic, together with the Reverend [[Henry Liddon]]. He recounts the travel in his "Russian Journal", which was first commercially published in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lewiscarroll.org/works.html |title=Chronology of Works of Lewis Carroll |accessdate=20 February 2009 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220131026/http://www.lewiscarroll.org/works.html |archivedate=20 February 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On his way to Russia and back, he also saw different cities in Belgium, Germany, partitioned Poland, and France.

He died of [[pneumonia]] following [[influenza]] on 14 January 1898 at his sisters' home, "The Chestnuts", in [[Guildford]]. He was two weeks away from turning 66 years old. His funeral was held at the nearby [[St Mary's Church, Guildford|St Mary's Church]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisisourtownguildford.co.uk/st-marys-church/10301656 Lewis Carroll and St Mary's Church – ''Guildford: This Is Our Town'' website]&lt;/ref&gt; He is buried in Guildford at the [[Mount Cemetery]].&lt;ref name = "snaogq"/&gt;

[[File:Hatch, Beatrice (Lewis Carroll, 30.07.1873).jpg|thumb|right|Lewis Carroll portrait of [[Beatrice Hatch]]]]

===Discussion of Dodgson's sexual preferences===
Some late twentieth-century biographers have suggested that Dodgson's interest in children had an erotic element, including [[Morton N. Cohen]] in his ''Lewis Carroll: A Biography'' (1995),&lt;ref name=cohen-166254&gt;[[#Cohen|Cohen]], pp. 166–167, 254–255&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donald Serrell Thomas|Donald Thomas]] in his ''Lewis Carroll: A Portrait with Background'' (1995), and [[Michael Bakewell]] in his ''Lewis Carroll: A Biography'' (1996).
Cohen, in particular, speculates that Dodgson's "sexual energies sought unconventional outlets", and further writes:

{{quote|We cannot know to what extent sexual urges lay behind Charles's preference for drawing and photographing children in the nude. He contended the preference was entirely aesthetic. But given his emotional attachment to children as well as his aesthetic appreciation of their forms, his assertion that his interest was strictly artistic is naïve. He probably felt more than he dared acknowledge, even to himself.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cohen|Cohen]], p.&amp;nbsp;228&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Cohen goes on to note that Dodgson "apparently convinced many of his friends that his attachment to the nude female child form was free of any [[erotic]]ism", but adds that "later generations look beneath the surface" (p.&amp;nbsp;229). He argues that Dodgson may have wanted to marry the 11-year-old Alice Liddell, and that this was the cause of the unexplained "break" with the family in June 1863,&lt;ref name="snaogq"/&gt; an event for which other explanations are offered. Biographers Derek Hudson and [[Roger Lancelyn Green]] stop short of identifying Dodgson as a [[paedophile]] (Green also edited Dodgson's diaries and papers), but they concur that he had a passion for small female children and next to no interest in the adult world. Catherine Robson refers to Carroll as "the Victorian era's most famous (or infamous) girl lover".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Catherine|last=Robson|title=Men in Wonderland: The Lost Girlhood of the Victorian Gentlemen|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=Princeton, New Jersey|date=2001|ISBN=978-0691004228|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other writers and scholars have challenged the evidential basis for Cohen's and others' views about Dodgson's sexual interests. Lebailly has endeavoured to set Dodgson's child photography within the "Victorian Child Cult", which perceived child nudity as essentially an expression of innocence. Lebailly claims that studies of child nudes were mainstream and fashionable in Dodgson's time, and that most photographers made them as a matter of course, including [[Oscar Gustave Rejlander]] and [[Julia Margaret Cameron]]. Lebailly continues that child nudes even appeared on Victorian [[Christmas card]]s, implying a very different social and aesthetic assessment of such material. Lebailly concludes that it has been an error of Dodgson's biographers to view his child-photography with 20th- or 21st-century eyes, and to have presented it as some form of personal idiosyncrasy, when it was in fact a response to a prevalent aesthetic and philosophical movement of the time.

[[Karoline Leach]]'s reappraisal of Dodgson focused in particular on his controversial sexuality. She argues that the allegations of paedophilia rose initially from a misunderstanding of Victorian morals, as well as the mistaken idea – fostered by Dodgson's various biographers – that he had no interest in adult women. She termed the traditional image of Dodgson "the Carroll Myth". She drew attention to the large amounts of evidence in his diaries and letters that he was also keenly interested in adult women, married and single, and enjoyed several relationships with them that would have been considered scandalous by the social standards of his time. She also pointed to the fact that many of those whom he described as "child-friends" were girls in their late teens and even twenties.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Leach|Leach]], pp. 16–17&lt;/ref&gt; She argues that suggestions of paedophilia emerged only many years after his death, when his well-meaning family had suppressed all evidence of his relationships with women in an effort to preserve his reputation, thus giving a false impression of a man interested only in little girls. Similarly, Leach points to a 1932 biography by Langford Reed as the source of the dubious claim that many of Carroll's female friendships ended when the girls reached the age of 14.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Leach|Leach]], p.&amp;nbsp;33&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the biographical works that have discussed Dodgson's sexuality, there are modern artistic interpretations of his life and work that do so as well — in particular, [[Dennis Potter]] in his play ''Alice'' and his screenplay for the motion picture ''[[Dreamchild]]'', and [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]] in his film ''Alice''.

===Ordination===
Dodgson had been groomed for the ordained ministry in the [[Church of England]] from a very early age and was expected to be [[holy orders|ordained]] within four years of obtaining his master's degree, as a condition of his residency at Christ Church. He delayed the process for some time but was eventually ordained as a deacon on 22 December 1861. But when the time came a year later to be ordained as a priest, Dodgson appealed to the dean for permission not to proceed. This was against college rules and, initially, Dean Liddell told him that he would have to consult the college ruling body, which would almost certainly have resulted in his being expelled. For unknown reasons, Liddell changed his mind overnight and permitted Dodgson to remain at the college in defiance of the rules.&lt;ref&gt;Dodgson's MS diaries, volume 8, 22–24 October 1862&lt;/ref&gt; Dodgson never became a priest, unique amongst senior students of his time.

There is currently no conclusive evidence about why Dodgson rejected the priesthood. Some have suggested that his stammer made him reluctant to take the step, because he was afraid of having to preach.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cohen|Cohen]], p.&amp;nbsp;263&lt;/ref&gt;  Wilson&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wilson|Wilson]], pp. 103–104&lt;/ref&gt; quotes letters by Dodgson describing difficulty in reading lessons and prayers rather than preaching in his own words. But Dodgson did indeed preach in later life, even though not in priest's orders, so it seems unlikely that his impediment was a major factor affecting his choice.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}  Wilson also points out that the [[Bishop of Oxford]], [[Samuel Wilberforce]], who ordained Dodgson, had strong views against clergy going to the theatre, one of Dodgson's great interests. He was interested in minority forms of Christianity (he was an admirer of [[Frederick Denison Maurice|F. D. Maurice]]) and "alternative" religions ([[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Leach|Leach]], p.&amp;nbsp;134&lt;/ref&gt; Dodgson became deeply troubled by an unexplained sense of sin and guilt at this time (the early 1860s) and frequently expressed the view in his diaries that he was a "vile and worthless" sinner, unworthy of the priesthood and this sense of sin and unworthiness may well have affected his decision to abandon being ordained to the priesthood.&lt;ref&gt;Dodgson's MS diaries, volume 8, see prayers scattered throughout the text&lt;/ref&gt;

===Missing diaries===
At least four complete volumes and around seven pages of text are missing from Dodgson's 13 diaries.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Leach|Leach]], pp. 48, 51&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of the volumes remains unexplained; the pages have been removed by an unknown hand. Most scholars assume that the diary material was removed by family members in the interests of preserving the family name, but this has not been proven.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Leach|Leach]], pp. 48–51&lt;/ref&gt; Except for one page, material is missing from his diaries for the period between 1853 and 1863 (when Dodgson was 21–31 years old).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Leach|Leach]], p.&amp;nbsp;52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Real Lewis Carroll / A Talk given to the Lewis Carroll Society |first=Edward |last=Wakeling |date = April 2003|url=http://www.wakeling.demon.co.uk/page3-real-lewiscarroll.htm |work=1855 ... 1856 ... 1857 ... 1858 ... 1862 ... 1863|accessdate=14 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was a period when Dodgson began suffering great mental and spiritual anguish and confessing to an overwhelming sense of his own sin. This was also the period of time when he composed his extensive love poetry, leading to speculation that the poems may have been autobiographical.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Leach|Leach]] p.&amp;nbsp;54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dodgson Family and Their Legacy|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/carroll/dreamchild/dreamchild5.html|accessdate=5 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many theories have been put forward to explain the missing material. A popular explanation for one missing page (27 June 1863) is that it might have been torn out to conceal a proposal of marriage on that day by Dodgson to the 11-year-old Alice Liddell. However, there has never been any evidence to suggest that this was so, and a paper offers some evidence to the contrary which was discovered by [[Karoline Leach]] in the Dodgson family archive in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Dodgson Family Collection, Cat. No. F/17/1. "[http://www.lewiscarroll.cc/cutpages.html Cut Pages in Diary]{{Dead link|url=http://www.lewiscarroll.cc/cutpages.html|date=September 2009}}". (For an account of its discovery see ''The Times Literary Supplement'', 3 May 1996.)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cutpagesdoc.jpg|thumb|upright|The "cut pages in diary" document, in the Dodgson family archive in Woking]]
This paper is known as the "cut pages in diary document", and was compiled by various members of Carroll's family after his death. Part of it may have been written at the time when the pages were destroyed, though this is unclear. The document offers a brief summary of two diary pages that are missing, including the one for 27 June 1863. The summary for this page states that Mrs. Liddell told Dodgson that there was gossip circulating about him and the Liddell family's [[governess]], as well as about his relationship with "Ina", presumably Alice's older sister Lorina Liddell. The "break" with the Liddell family that occurred soon after was presumably in response to this gossip.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Leach|Leach]], pp. 170–2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lewiscarroll.cc/cutpages.html |work=Looking for Lewis Carroll |title=Text available on-line |accessdate=4 May 2007}}{{Dead link|url=http://www.lewiscarroll.cc/cutpages.html|date=September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative interpretation has been made regarding Carroll's rumoured involvement with "Ina": Lorina was also the name of Alice Liddell's mother. What is deemed most crucial and surprising is that the document seems to imply that Dodgson's break with the family was not connected with Alice at all; until a primary source is discovered, the events of 27 June 1863 will remain in doubt.

===Migraine and epilepsy===
In his diary for 1880, Dodgson recorded experiencing his first episode of [[migraine]] with aura, describing very accurately the process of "moving fortifications" that are a manifestation of the aura stage of the syndrome.&lt;ref name=w1&gt;Wakeling, Edward (Ed.) "The Diaries of Lewis Carroll", Vol. 9, p.&amp;nbsp;52&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, there is no clear evidence to show whether this was his first experience of migraine ''per se'', or if he may have previously suffered the far more common form of migraine without aura, although the latter seems most likely, given the fact that migraine most commonly develops in the teens or early adulthood. Another form of migraine aura called [[Alice in Wonderland syndrome]] has been named after Dodgson's little heroine because its manifestation can resemble the sudden size-changes in the book. It is also known as [[micropsia]] and [[macropsia]], a brain condition affecting the way that objects are perceived by the mind. For example, an afflicted person may look at a larger object such as a basketball and perceive it as if it were the size of a golf ball. Some authors have suggested that Dodgson may have suffered from this type of aura and used it as an inspiration in his work, but there is no evidence that he did.&lt;ref name="Migraineand"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Migraine and Lewis Carroll|author= Maudie, F.W. |journal=The Migraine Periodical|volume=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Dodgson also suffered two attacks in which he lost consciousness. He was diagnosed by a Dr. Morshead, Dr. Brooks, and Dr. Stedman, and they believed the attack and a consequent attack to be an "epileptiform" seizure (initially thought to be fainting, but Brooks changed his mind). Some have concluded from this that he was a lifetime sufferer of this condition, but there is no evidence of this in his diaries beyond the diagnosis of the two attacks already mentioned.&lt;ref name=w1/&gt; Some authors, Sadi Ranson in particular, have suggested that Carroll may have suffered from [[temporal lobe epilepsy]] in which consciousness is not always completely lost but altered, and in which the symptoms mimic many of the same experiences as Alice in Wonderland. Carroll had at least one incident in which he suffered full loss of consciousness and awoke with a bloody nose, which he recorded in his diary and noted that the episode left him not feeling himself for "quite sometime afterward". This attack was diagnosed as possibly "epileptiform" and Carroll himself later wrote of his "seizures" in the same diary.

Most of the standard diagnostic tests of today were not available in the nineteenth century. Yvonne Hart, consultant neurologist at the [[John Radcliffe Hospital]], Oxford, considered Dodgson's symptoms. Her conclusion, quoted in Jenny Woolf's 2010 ''The Mystery of Lewis Carroll'', is that Dodgson very likely had migraine, and may have had epilepsy, but she emphasises that she would have considerable doubt about making a diagnosis of epilepsy without further information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Woolf |first=Jenny |title=The Mystery of Lewis Carroll |pages=298–9 |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |isbn=978-0-312-67371-0|date=4 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sara Liu Xijun''' ({{zh|s=刘惜君|t=劉惜君|p=Líu Xījūn|j=Lau4 Sik1 Gwan1}}), is a Chinese [[pop singer]] who rose to fame through televised singing competitions. Born April 30, 1988 in [[Shenzhen]], [[Guangdong]] of Hakka [[Meixian District|Meixian]] ancestry, she began as a singer by ranking fifth in the fourth season (2009) of a singing contest in China, ''[[Super Girl (TV series)|Super Girls]]'' (Chinese: 快乐女声), or Happy Girl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://girl09.hunantv.com/zixun/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210115731/http://girl09.hunantv.com/zixun/index.html |archivedate=2010-02-10 |df= }} Super Girls 2009 main page.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career life==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Sara1.jpg|thumb|right|快樂女聲]] --&gt;
* In 2009, Liu Xijun decided to take part in the famous [[Hunan TV]] show ''[[Super Girl (TV series)|Super Girl]]'', but she failed to rank with the [[Hunan TV]] ''[[Super Girl (TV series)|Super Girl]]'' nationwide top 3. Her musical experience is listed below.
* Personal experience:
* In 2003, Liu Xijun started to show her shining talent: she was awarded as a top 10 school singer in a Shenzhen shatoujiao school singing competition.
* In February 2004, when the little Xijun was only fifteen years old, she won the championship of a local famous singing competition, which was hosted by Shenzhen Aoqi Music Inc, and then was signed by this music company.

===Super Girl===

* In March 2009, she attended a TV show hosted by Zhejiang TV, representing Shenzhen City. Liu Xijun joined the Super Girl 2009 competition. Her goal was to be in the top 20 in Guangdong Province and top 300 nationwide. She became one of the top 60 nationwide on June 13, 2009. With her outstanding talent, she later ranked with the top 20 nationwide.
* On June 26, 2009, Liu Xijun beat Zeng Yike by just one vote at Super Girl national competition and became the third Super Girl top 10 competitor.
* On July 17, 2009, she competed with [[Yisa Yu|Yu Kewei]] to be the cover girl for the fashion magazine ''Elle''.
* On July 24, 2009, Liu Xijun was ranked fourth in Round 2 of the Super Girl National final competition.
* On August 1, 2009,  she was voted fourth in Round 3 of the Super Girl National final competition; advancing past Tan Lina to become one of the nationwide top 7.
* On August 8, 2009,  Liu Xijun sang "Sky", and moved all the judges and brought them to their feet; however, she failed to become ''Elle'' cover girl that week.
* On August 15, 2009, she beat Tan Lina in the final PK and became one of the top 5 finalists at Super Girl.
* On August 22, 2009, Liu Xijun together with Yu Haomin, sang the classical song "Embrace" and high acclaim from the judges and the audience.
Unfortunately, Liu Xijun lost her challenge to Yu Kewei with her song "I Only Care for You". Even with her defeat, Liu left the stage gracefully with a smile on her beautiful face.

===Musical style===
Liu Xijun has high personal music recognition accuracy in terms of her voice, therefore, people can easily distinguish her voice by listening to her songs. Liu Xijun’s musical style could be categorized as classical pop music, such as Deng Lijun, she owned nearly all the characters which Chinese traditional singers have had.{{clarify|reason=How do you own a traditional character? In America we have traditional characters like Cinderella, but nobody owns Cinderella or the copyright.|date=September 2017}} Even though her songs still have her own features, taking "Love Garden" for instance, this song is standard pop music, depicting a tale of a girl’s first love. Having experienced Super Girl 2009 as her precious fortune, Liu Xijun improved her singing skills greatly when she signed with EEMEDIA after ''Super Girl'', and started her new music career.

'''Mañjuśrī''' is a [[bodhisattva]] associated with [[Prajñā (Buddhism)|prajñā]] (insight) in [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]]. In [[Tibetan Buddhism]], he is also a [[yidam]]. His name means "Gentle Glory"（Chinese：妙吉祥, 妙乐） in [[Sanskrit]].&lt;ref&gt;Lopez Jr., Donald S. (2001). ''The Story of Buddhism: A Concise Guide to its History and Teachings.'' New York, USA: HarperSanFrancisco. {{ISBN|0-06-069976-0}} (cloth) P.260.&lt;/ref&gt; Mañjuśrī is also known by the fuller name of Mañjuśrīkumārabhūta,&lt;ref name="Keown, Damien 2003 p.172"&gt;Keown, Damien (editor) with Hodge, Stephen; Jones, Charles; Tinti, Paola (2003). ''A Dictionary of Buddhism.'' Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-860560-9}} p.172.&lt;/ref&gt; literally "Mañjuśrī, Still a Youth" or, less literally, "Prince Mañjuśrī".

==In Mahāyāna Buddhism==
[[File:Manjushri statue. Lalung Gompa, Spiti.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Manjushri statue. Lhalung Gompa, [[Spiti Valley]], India]]
[[File:Kishi Monju pentad (Saidaiji Nara).jpg|thumb|250px|[[Saidai-ji]]]]
Scholars have identified Mañjuśrī as the oldest and most significant bodhisattva in Mahāyāna literature.&lt;ref&gt;A View of Manjushri: Wisdom and Its Crown Prince in Pala Period India. Harrington, Laura. Doctoral Thesis, Columbia University, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Mañjuśrī is first referred to in early [[Mahayana sutras]] such as the [[Prajnaparamita]] sutras and through this association, very early in the tradition he came to symbolize the embodiment of ''prajñā'' (transcendent wisdom).&lt;ref name="Keown, Damien 2003 p.172"/&gt; The ''[[Lotus Sutra]]'' assigns him a [[pure land]] called ''Vimala'', which according to the ''[[Avatamsaka Sutra]]'' is located in the East. His pure land is predicted to be one of the two best pure lands in all of existence in all the past, present, and future. When he attains [[buddhahood]] his name will be Universal Sight. In the Lotus Sūtra, Mañjuśrī also leads the [[Longnü|Nagaraja's daughter]] to enlightenment. He also figures in the ''[[Vimalakirti Sutra]]'' in a debate with [[Vimalakirti]] where he is presented as an Arhat who represents the wisdom of the Hinayana.

An example of a wisdom teaching of Mañjuśrī can be found in the ''Saptaśatikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra'' ([[Taishō Tripiṭaka]] 232).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.acmuller.net/descriptive_catalogue/files/k0010.html|title=The Korean Buddhist Canon: A Descriptive Catalog (T 232)}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sūtra contains a dialogue between Mañjuśrī and the Buddha on the One [[Samadhi]] (Skt. ''Ekavyūha Samādhi''). [[Sheng-yen]] renders the following teaching of Mañjuśrī, for entering samādhi naturally through transcendent wisdom:
{{quote|Contemplate the five [[skandha]]s as originally empty and quiescent, non-arising, non-perishing, equal, without differentiation. Constantly thus practicing, day or night, whether sitting, walking, standing or lying down, finally one reaches an inconceivable state without any obstruction or form. This is the Samadhi of One Act (''yixing sanmei'', 一行三昧).&lt;ref&gt;Sheng-Yen, Master (聖嚴法師)(1988). [https://web.archive.org/web/20121011012531/http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-BJ001/02_10.htm ''Tso-Ch'an''], p.364&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Vajrayana Buddhism==

Within [[Vajrayana|Vajrayana Buddhism]], Mañjuśrī is a meditational deity and considered a fully enlightened Buddha. In [[Shingon Buddhism]], he is one of the [[Thirteen Buddhas]] to whom disciples devote themselves. He figures extensively in many esoteric texts such as the ''[[Mañjuśrī-mūla-kalpa]]''&lt;ref name="Keown, Damien 2003 p.172"/&gt; and the ''[[Mañjuśrīnāmasamgīti]]''. His consort in some traditions is [[Saraswati]].

The [[Mañjuśrī-mūla-kalpa|Mañjusrimulakalpa]], which later came to classified under [[Outer_Tantras#Kriyatantra|Kriyatantra]], states that mantras taught in the [[Shaivism|Saiva]], Garuda and [[Vaisnava]] tantras will be effective if applied by Buddhists since they were all taught originally by Manjushri.&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson, Alexis. "The Śaiva Age: The Rise and Dominance of Śaivism during the Early Medieval Period." In: Genesis and Development of Tantrism, edited by Shingo Einoo. Tokyo: Institute of Oriental Culture, University of Tokyo, 2009. Institute of Oriental Culture Special Series, 23, pp. 129-131.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==

Mañjuśrī is depicted as a male bodhisattva wielding a flaming sword in his right hand, representing the realization of transcendent wisdom which cuts down ignorance and duality. The scripture supported by the [[Padma (attribute)|padma]] (lotus) held in his left hand is a ''Prajñāpāramitā sūtra'', representing his attainment of ultimate realization from the blossoming of wisdom. Mañjuśrī is often depicted as riding on a blue [[lion]] or sitting on the skin of a lion. This represents the use of wisdom to tame the mind, which is compared to riding or subduing a ferocious lion.

In Chinese and Japanese Buddhist art, Mañjuśrī's sword is sometimes replaced with a ''[[ruyi (scepter)|ruyi]]'' scepter, especially in representations of his ''[[Vimalakirti Sutra]]'' discussion with the layman [[Vimalakirti]].&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, J. LeRoy, "The Origin and Early Use of the Ju-i", ''Artibus Asiae'' 1950,13.4, 240.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Berthold Laufer]], the first Chinese representation of a ''ruyi'' was in an 8th-century Mañjuśrī painting by [[Wu Daozi]], showing it held in his right hand taking the place of the usual sword. In subsequent Chinese and Japanese paintings of Buddhas, a ''ruyi'' was occasionally represented as a Padma with a long stem curved like a ''ruyi''.&lt;ref&gt;Laufer, Berthold, ''[https://openlibrary.org/books/OL7181158M/Jade Jade, a Study in Chinese Archaeology and Religion]'', Field Museum of Natural History, 1912, 339.&lt;/ref&gt; 

He is one of the Four Great Bodhisattvas of [[Chinese Buddhism]], the other three being [[Kshitigarbha|Kṣitigarbha]], [[Avalokiteśvara]], and [[Samantabhadra]]. In China, he is often paired with Samantabhadra.

In [[Tibetan Buddhism]], Mañjuśrī is sometimes depicted in a trinity with Avalokiteśvara and [[Vajrapāṇi]].

==Mantras==

A [[mantra]] commonly associated with Mañjuśrī is the following:&lt;ref&gt;Buswell, Robert. Lopez, Donald. ''The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism.'' 2013. p. 527&lt;/ref&gt;

:''oṃ arapacana dhīḥ''

The Arapacana is a [[syllabary]] consisting of forty-two letters, and is named after the first five letters: ''a, ra, pa, ca, na''.&lt;ref&gt;Buswell, Robert. Lopez, Donald. ''The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism.'' 2013. p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; This syllabary was most widely used for the [[Gāndhārī language]] with the [[Kharosthi|Kharoṣṭhī script]] but also appears in some Sanskrit texts. The syllabary features in Mahāyāna texts such as the longer ''[[Prajñāpāramitā]]'' texts, the ''[[Gaṇḍavyūha Sūtra]]'', the ''[[Lalitavistara Sūtra]]'', the ''[[Avataṃsaka Sūtra]]'', the ''[[Dharmaguptaka]] [[Vinaya]]'', and the ''[[Mūlasarvāstivāda]] Vinaya''.&lt;ref&gt;Buswell, Robert. Lopez, Donald. ''The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism.'' 2013. p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; In some of these texts, the Arapacana syllabary serves as a [[mnemonic]] for important Mahāyāna concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Buswell, Robert. Lopez, Donald. ''The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism.'' 2013. p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its association with him, ''Arapacana'' may even serve as an alternate name for Mañjuśrī.&lt;ref&gt;Buswell, Robert. Lopez, Donald. ''The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism.'' 2013. p. 527&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Sutra on Perfect Wisdom'' (Conze 1975) defines the significance of each syllable thus:{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

# ''A'' is a door to the insight that all dharmas are unproduced from the very beginning (''ādya-anutpannatvād'').
# ''RA'' is a door to the insight that all dharmas are without dirt (''rajas'').
# ''PA'' is a door to the insight that all dharmas have been expounded in the ultimate sense (''paramārtha'').
# ''CA'' is a door to the insight that the decrease (''cyavana'') or rebirth of any dharma cannot be apprehended, because all dharmas do not decrease, nor are they reborn.
# ''NA'' is a door to the insight that the names (i.e. ''nāma'') of all dharmas have vanished; the essential nature behind names cannot be gained or lost.

Tibetan pronunciation is slightly different and so the Tibetan characters read: ''{{IAST|oṃ a ra pa tsa na dhīḥ}}'' ({{bo|w=om a ra pa tsa na d+hIH|t=ༀ་ཨ་ར་པ་ཙ་ན་དྷཱི༔|lang=yes}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visiblemantra.org/manjusri.html] - Visible Mantra's website&lt;/ref&gt; In Tibetan tradition, this mantra is believed to enhance wisdom and improve one's skills in debating, memory, writing, and other literary abilities. "{{IAST|Dhīḥ}}" is the seed syllable of the mantra and is chanted with greater emphasis and also repeated a number of times as a [[decrescendo]].

==In Buddhist cultures==
{{MahayanaBuddhism}}
[[File:Yulin Cave 3 w wall Manjusri (Western Xia).jpg|thumb|A painting of the Buddhist ''manjusri'' from the [[Yulin Caves]] of [[Gansu]], China, from the [[Tangut people|Tangut]]-led [[Western Xia]] dynasty]]
===In China===
Mañjuśrī is known in China as ''Wenshu'' ({{zh|c=文殊|p=Wénshū}}). [[Mount Wutai]] in [[Shanxi]], one of the four [[Sacred Mountains of China]], is considered by Chinese Buddhists to be his [[bodhimaṇḍa]]. He was said to bestow spectacular visionary experiences to those on selected mountain peaks and caves there. In Mount Wutai's [[Foguang Temple]], the Manjusri Hall to the right of its main hall was recognized to have been built in 1137 during the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]]. The hall was thoroughly studied, mapped and first photographed by early twentieth-century Chinese architects [[Liang Sicheng]] and [[Lin Huiyin]].&lt;ref&gt;Liang, Ssucheng. ''A Pictorial History of Chinese Architecture''. Ed. Wilma Fairbank. Cambridge, Michigan: The MIT Press, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; These made it a popular place of pilgrimage, but patriarchs including [[Linji Yixuan]] and [[Yunmen Wenyan]] declared the mountain off limits.&lt;ref&gt;*See Robert M. Gimello, "Chang Shang-ying on Wu-t'ai Shan", in Pilgrims and Sacred Sites in China:, ed. Susan Naquin and Chün-fang Yü (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1992), pp. 89–149; and Steven Heine, "Visions, Divisions, Revisions: The Encounter Between Iconoclasm and Supernaturalism in Kōan Cases about Mount Wu-t'ai", in The Kōan, pp. 137–167.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mount Wutai was also associated with the [[East Mountain Teaching]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Heine | first= Steven | title=Opening a Mountain: Koans of the Zen Masters | publisher= Oxford University Press | location= USA | page= &lt;!-- insert page number(s) --&gt; | year= 2002 | isbn=0-19-513586-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mañjuśrī has been associated with Mount Wutai since ancient times. Paul Williams writes:&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations.'' 2000. p. 227&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Apparently the association of Mañjuśrī with Wutai (Wu-t'ai) Shan in north China was known in classical times in India itself, identified by Chinese scholars with the mountain in the 'north-east' (when seen from India or [[Central Asia]]) referred to as the abode of Mañjuśrī in the ''[[Avatamsaka Sutra|Avataṃsaka Sūtra]]''. There are said to have been pilgrimages from India and other Asian countries to Wutai Shan by the seventh century.}}

According to official histories from the [[Qing dynasty]], [[Nurhaci]], a military leader of the [[Jurchen people|Jurchens]] of [[Northeast China]] and founder of what became the Qing dynasty, named his tribe after Mañjuśrī as the [[Manchus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=|last=Agui|title=满洲源流考 (the Origin of Manchus)|publisher=Liaoning Nationality Publishing House|year=1988|isbn=9787805270609|url=http://book.douban.com/subject/4106389/|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The true origin of the name Manchu is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Chongnian|last=Yan|title=明亡清兴六十年 (彩图珍藏版)|publisher=Zhonghua Book Company|year=2008|isbn=9787101059472|url=http://book.douban.com/subject/2359481/|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monk Hanshan (寒山) is widely considered to be a metaphorical manifestation of Mañjuśrī. He is known for having co-written the following famous poem about reincarnation with monk Shide:

Drumming your grandpa in the shrine,&lt;br&gt;
Cooking your aunts in the pot,&lt;br&gt;
Marrying your grandma in the past,&lt;br&gt;
Should I laugh or not?&lt;br&gt;

堂上打鼓打公皮，&lt;br&gt;
鍋內煎煮是姑娘，&lt;br&gt;
三世祖母娶為婦，&lt;br&gt;
我今不笑等何時。&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foxue.163.com/photonew/B06C0324/114.html|title=诗僧寒山与拾得:文殊菩萨普贤菩萨化身|publisher=NetEase Buddhism Channel|date=2014-12-10|language=zh|location=Beijing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lingshh.com/wuyuefojiao/hantingjie.htm|title=寒山诗赏析|author=韩廷杰|publisher=灵山海会期刊社|language=zh|location=Zhejiang}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Tibet===
In Tibetan Buddhism, Mañjuśrī manifests in a number of different [[tantra|Tantric]] forms. [[Yamantaka|Yamāntaka]] (meaning 'terminator of [[Yama]] i.e. Death') is the [[wrathful deity|wrathful]] manifestation of Mañjuśrī, popular within the [[Gelug]] school of Tibetan Buddhism. Other variations upon his traditional form as Mañjuśrī include Namasangiti, Arapacana Manjushri, etc. 

Mahasiddha Virupa, Mahsiddha Naropa, Emperor Trisong Detsen, Translator Lotsawa Loden Sherab, Father of the Tibetan Language-Thonmi Sambhuta, Yogi Ra Lotsawa, Scholar Sakya Pandita, Buton Rinchen Drub, Panchen Sonam Srkpa, Lama Tsongkhapa, Duldzin Drakpa Gyaltsen, Tulku Drakpa Gyaltsen, and other great realised masters are believed to be human manifestations of Manjushri.

===In Nepal===
According to [[Swayambhu Purana]], the [[Kathmandu Valley]] was once a lake. It is believed that Mañjuśrī came on a pilgrimage from his earthly abode-[[Wutaishan]](five-peaked mountain) in China. He saw a lotus flower in the center of the lake, which emitted brilliant radiance. He cut a gorge at Chovar with his flaming sword to allow the lake to drain. The place where the lotus flower settled became the great [[Swayambhunath]] [[Stupa]] and the valley thus became habitable.

===In Indonesia===
In eighth century [[Java]] during the [[Medang Kingdom]], Mañjuśrī was a prominent deity revered by the [[Sailendra dynasty]], patrons of Mahayana Buddhism. The [[Kelurak inscription]] (782) and [[Manjusrigrha inscription]] (792) mentioned about the construction of a grand Prasada named ''Vajrāsana Mañjuśrīgṛha'' (Vajra House of Mañjuśrī) identified today as [[Sewu]] temple, located just 800 meters north of the [[Prambanan]]. Sewu is the second largest Buddhist temple in Central Java after [[Borobudur]]. The depiction of Mañjuśrī in Sailendra art is similar to those of the [[Pala Empire]] style of [[Nalanda]], [[Bihar]]. Mañjuśrī was portrayed as a youthful handsome man with the palm of his hands tattooed with the image of a flower. His right hand is facing down with an open palm while his left-hand holds an ''utpala'' (blue lotus). He also uses the necklace made of tiger [[canine tooth|canine teeth]].

==History==

===Beginnings in late 70s===
Mediaset's story began in 1978, with '''Telemilano''', a local [[Milan]]-based broadcaster that became '''[[Canale 5]]''' two years later and began broadcasting nationally. Canale 5 was subsequently joined by '''[[Italia 1]]''' (bought from the publishing group Rusconi in 1982) and '''[[Rete 4]]''' (acquired from [[Arnoldo Mondadori Editore]] in 1984). Television area was called '''RTI''' and became established with three national analogue networks, supported by an advertising sales company, '''Publitalia '80''', that exclusively collects advertising for all three channels, and two other companies, '''Videotime''', that manages TV technology and production activities, and '''Elettronica Industriale''' that guarantees signal distribution through the management of the broadcasting infrastructure.

===From late 90s to early 2000: the evolution===
In 1996 RTI, Videotime, Publitalia and Elettronica Industriale were brought together in a single group, Mediaset, which was then listed on the [[Milan stock exchange]], opening up the company to both important institutional investors and private investors (around 300,000). In 1997, Mediaset expands outside [[Italy]] with the acquisition of a 25% stake in the Spanish broadcaster, '''[[Telecinco]]'''. In 1999, Mediaset Group expands its web-based activities with a television portal dedicated to Canale 5, Italia 1 and Retequattro and a daily online news service, is accessible from a range of media ([[internet]], [[TV]], [[radio]], Mediavideo [[teletext]] and [[mobile phones]]).

==Lawsuits==

===Europa 7===
In January 2008, the European Court of Justice ruled that the TV frequencies used by Mediaset to broadcast Rete 4 were shared out unfairly. They should have been given to [[Europa 7]], a competitor channel, the judges maintain, and Rete 4 should be broadcast via satellite instead. Although the Italian Council of State, the highest court on administrative matters, has confirmed that the Italian government should abide by this European ruling, Rete 4 continues its operation on analog frequencies and on [[DVB-T]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/rbssTechMediaTelecomNews/idUSL3142399220080531|title=Italy court rejects Mediaset appeal to EU ruling|date=May 31, 2008|work=[[Reuters]] | first=Giuseppe | last=Fonte}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Google===
On 30 July 2008, Mediaset filed a lawsuit against [[Google]] for €500 million (US$779 million) charging copyright infringement.

'''Milton Johnson''' (born May 15, 1950) is an American [[serial killer]] who committed up to ten known murders in [[Will County, Illinois|Will County]], [[Illinois]]. An abundance of evidence linked him to the crimes, including the murder of two police officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://justpac.org/detail.php?c=2262997&amp;t= |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120709170956/http://justpac.org/detail.php?c=2262997&amp;t= |archivedate=2012-07-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murders==
===The Murders of Officers Denis Foley and Stephen Mayer===
On Saturday July 16, 1983, at approximately 3:25 a.m. at 143rd and State, Will County Auxiliary Sergeant Denis Foley and Auxiliary Deputy Stephen Mayer were mortally wounded in an ambush slaying.

The deputies had been shot in what they thought was going to be a routine stop to help a motorist. They stopped to assist the driver of a pickup truck. The rear of the truck was blocking part of the road, while its front bumper was up against a red car parked in a rutted turn-around area. As the officers approached, their assailant said, "We need a jump."

When the officers exited their vehicle, the gunman suddenly shot both of them. Mayer died shortly after being shot; Foley was seriously wounded in the throat. A few minutes later another car came around the curve and slowed down. The gunman opened up on them. The driver was killed; a female passenger was shot six times. The car rolled on down the road and into a bean field. Wounded and frightened, the female went looking for help.
 
The deputies were in trouble but they couldn't be found and other officers were frantically searching in the darkness of rural [[Homer Township, Will County, Illinois|Homer Township]]. Between 3:25 a.m. and 3:40 a.m., county police officers searched for Foley and Mayer.

Sergeant Foley, badly injured from one bullet that had shattered his mouth and teeth, attempted to speak over the police radio microphone. Most of his words were garbled. He couldn't give his location. He was instructed to turn on his siren and shine his spotlight in the air. Meanwhile, a farmer who lived in the area called county police to say he could hear racket behind his buildings, including a siren. Officers met the citizen and less than a minute later, the site of the ambush was located.

After finding the two auxiliary deputies, responding units located the bodies of a 25-year-old female, and a 32-year-old male who had been in the car parked in front of the pickup truck. 

The auxiliary officers' guns and wallets were missing. Mayer's body had been dragged across the gravel road and left in a ditch. In a reconstruction of the crime scene, it was determined that before he died, Mayer, as he leaned on 301A, had attempted to flag down the last car that was also ambushed. "Stop! Stop!" he had called out. As he was calling for help, the gunman had zigzagged between the front of the pickup truck and the squad car firing shots at the car. The female survivor saw a man in a uniform shirt shouting at them. She thought the officer was shooting at them.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.odmp.org/officer/4970-auxiliary-sergeant-denis-p-foley&lt;/ref&gt;

===The murder of Anthony Hackett===
On July 16, 1983, Patricia Payne and her boyfriend, Anthony Hackett, drove from their hometown of [[Emden, Illinois]], and spent the day at [[Six Flags Great America]] Amusement Park in [[Gurnee, Illinois]]. That day, Hackett bought a stuffed doll depicting the popular [[Tasmanian Devil (Looney Tunes)|Tasmanian Devil]] character; he placed the receipt for the doll in his wallet. Around 10 p.m., Payne and Hackett left the park and, on the way home, they stopped Hackett's car along [[Interstate 55]] in [[Will County]] to sleep. Hackett slept in the front seat; Payne slept in the back. 

Around 1:30 a.m. on July 17, Payne awoke to tapping on the passenger-side window followed by gunshots which struck and killed Hackett. The assailant opened the passenger-side door and ordered Payne to give him Hackett's wallet and her purse. He then ordered Payne to crawl from the car and into a pickup truck parked nearby. The assailant climbed into the truck and drove down the interstate. While driving, the assailant sexually assaulted Payne; after exiting the interstate and stopping the truck, he raped her. 

The assailant again started to drive, but pulled the truck onto the shoulder of the road 10 minutes later. The assailant then stabbed Payne in the chest and dumped her from the truck. Payne was found on the grassy median an hour later at 5:30 a.m. by a passing motorist. She had no pulse or blood pressure, and she was rushed to a Joliet hospital, where doctors performed emergency surgery. Payne survived.

Later that morning, Special Agent John Meduga of the Illinois Department of Law Enforcement (now known as the Illinois State Police) spoke with Payne. Payne indicated to Meduga that her assailant was an African American man with no observable facial hair. Eight days later, Payne looked through approximately 1,500 mugshots and selected 42 photographs of persons with facial characteristics similar to her assailant, 34 of whom had facial hair. The record does not reveal whether the defendant's photograph was chosen by Payne. More than a month later, Payne looked through 137 mugshots, including one of the defendant, and selected four photographs of persons with facial hair and facial characteristics similar to her assailant. Payne did not choose the defendant's photograph.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.state.il.us/Court/Opinions/SupremeCourt/2002/May/Opinions/Html/85134.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investigation===
The police investigation of these crimes stalled until information that Ann Shoemaker telephoned the Will County sheriff's office in August 1983 was turned over to the State Police in February 1984. Shoemaker described an incident in which a dark pickup truck had played cat and mouse game with her while she was driving one night in July 1983. She and a friend followed the truck and recorded its license plate number. After seeing the driver was not someone they knew, tried to get away. On March 6, 1984, she gave this number to the police, who traced it to a truck owned by Sam Myers, Johnson's stepfather.  

After Myers signed a consent form, the police searched the truck and found Caucasian head hairs similar to Payne's hair, bloodstains, a steak knife, reddish brown fibers, and a sales receipt for a Tasmanian Devil stuffed doll. Based on these items, the police obtained a search warrant for Myers' residence, where the defendant lived. The police seized three .357 Magnum cartridges from a dresser in Myers' bedroom.

Also on March 6, 1984, Payne looked at five mugshots. Johnson's photograph was the only one among the five which Payne had seen on September 6, 1983. After several minutes, Payne tentatively identified the defendant as her assailant. On March 9, Payne viewed a six-person [[Police lineup|lineup]]. After each person in the lineup repeated commands that the assailant had given Payne on the night of her ordeal, Payne unmistakably identified the defendant as her assailant.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.state.il.us/Court/Opinions/SupremeCourt/2002/May/Opinions/Html/85134.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trial===
Initially, the Will County public defender was appointed to represent the defendant. On June 1, 1984, the day before the scheduled trial date, William Swano entered his appearance as the defendant's retained attorney. The trial court granted Swano three continuances, totaling 55 days, and set the trial date for July 26, 1984. 

The defendant moved for a change of venue, citing negative pretrial publicity in Will County, and the trial court transferred the case to Iroquois County. Following a jury trial, the defendant was convicted of the first degree murder of Hackett, as well as the aggravated kidnapping, deviate sexual assault, rape, and attempted murder of Payne. The defendant waived his right to a sentencing jury, and the trial court found the defendant eligible for the death penalty. 

The trial court further found no mitigating circumstances sufficient to preclude the death penalty and sentenced the defendant to death for Hackett's murder and to concurrent terms of 40 years' imprisonment for deviate sexual assault, rape, and attempted murder. On direct appeal, this court affirmed the defendant's convictions and sentences. See People v. Johnson, 114 Ill. 2d 170 (1986).

Johnson then filed a pro se post-conviction petition in the Will County circuit court, alleging that he received ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal and in post-conviction proceedings. The trial court granted the state's motion to dismiss the petition. On appeal, they affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. The court held that the trial court properly dismissed Johnson's claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, but that the trial court improperly dismissed Johnson's claim relating to his post-conviction attorney's performance. See People v. Johnson, 154 Ill. 2d 227 (1993).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dcbabrief.org/vol110199art6.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson is serving his sentence in [[Menard Correctional Center]].

'''Miquel Hudin''' is an American-Croatian wine writer based in [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]].

As a technology entrepreneur, he co-founded [[The Tender]], a local news website for San Francisco's [[Tenderloin,_San_Francisco|Tenderloin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hillman|first=Beth|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/culture/meet-your-neighborhood-blogger-miquel-hudin-of-the-tender/|website=SF Weekly|title=Meet Your Neighborhood Blogger: Miquel Hudin of The Tender|accessdate=2016-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Maneno]], a non-profit startup focused on creating a platform for news and blogging in Africa, in local languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hersman|first=Erik|url=http://whiteafrican.com/2008/11/08/maneno-a-blogging-platform-made-for-africa/|website=White African|title=Maneno: A Blogging Platform Made for Africa|accessdate=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Being a wine lover for years, he saw a lack of approachable, practical wine books, and in response, created a new series called, [[Vinologue]] upon which he currently focuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scoutmob.com/atlanta/scoutfinds/2339?ref=art_prev|website=Scoutmob|title=Meet Miquel Hudin, Guiding you to your favorite wine|accessdate=2016-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vidirecte.cat/noticia/184/entrevista-elia-varela-i-miquel-hudin-autors-de-la-primera-guia-d-enoturisme-de-la-doq-priorat.html|website=Vi Directe|title=Èlia Varela i Miquel Hudin, autors de la primera guia d'enoturisme de la DOQ Priorat|accessdate=2016-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vinologue.com/about/|website=Vinologue|title=History &amp; About|accessdate=2016-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Originally from the interior of Northern California, Miquel moved to [[San Francisco]] for university and while there, started working for the [[Inglenook_(winery)|Inglenook winery]] in [[Napa Valley]] in 1999.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hudin.com/about/|website=Miquel Hudin|title=About|accessdate=2016-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked in various other wine trade capacities including an importer of Central European wines which lead to a growing interest in wine.

'''Nikolay Karlovich Krabbe''' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Николай Карлович Краббе}}) (September 19, 1814 –  January 3, 1876) was an  admiral of the [[Russian Imperial Navy]].

After graduating from naval academy joined the [[Sea Cadet Corps (Russia)|corps of navy cadets]] ({{lang-ru|link=no|гардемарины - gardemariny}}) and in 1832 was promoted [[midshipman]] in the [[Baltic Fleet]] serving on the frigates  ''Belton'', ''Kulm'' and ''Oranienbaum''. In 1836-1837 he was sent to the [[Caspian Sea]], participating in the naval operations during the [[Caucasian War]]. His bravery during the war earned him the rank of lieutenant. In 1838 Krabbe was appointed the General Staff of the Imperial Navy, as aide-de-camp to prince L.S. Menshikov.

In 1839 he was sent to the [[Sea of Azov|Azov Sea]] to organize a naval expedition along the northern coast of the [[Black Sea]], being in command of a [[Squadron (naval)|squadron]] under admiral [[Mikhail Petrovich Lazarev]] at that time in head of the [[Black Sea Fleet]]. Promoted [[captain lieutenant]] in 1842, he was part of the Russian mission led by admiral [[Yevfimy Putyatin|Yevfimy Vasilievich Putyatin]] to [[Iran]]. Thereafter, in 1847, he was in charge of a naval expedition exploring the delta of the [[Syr Darya]]. He returned to the [[Black Sea Fleet]] in 1853,  being in command of a squadron under viceadmiral [[Lazar Markovich Serebryakov]].

The same year he was promoted imperial [[aide-de-camp]] and appointed deputy director of the Ministry of Navy's Inspection Department. Two years later he became director of the department. He returned to active duty during the [[Crimean War]], returning to the Ministry after the war. While working at the Inspection Department he was actively involved in the equipment of the vessels to be stationed in the delta of the [[Amur River]], creating the first Russian naval base in the Far East, on the Pacific Ocean.

His career continued rapidly: Nikolay Krabbe was promoted [[counter admiral]] în 1856, [[viceadmiral]] in 1862 and [[admiral]] in 1869. În 1860 he was appointed Minister of the Navy, holding his position for 14 years. His main concern was the modernization of the Russian navy. His main concern was the [[naval artillery]] and he was instrumental in the building of the [[Obukhovsky Steel Foundry]] (now Obukhov State Plant) for the production of naval guns. He also started modernizing the fleet from wooden vessels to metal plated ships and from sailing ships to ships equipped with steam engines. He also made the arrangement for [[Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich's]] visit the United States.&lt;ref&gt;The Question settled. Confirmation of the Grand Duke's visit to America – New York Times, 30 iunie 1871&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1874 he was relieved of his duties as Minister of the Navy and appointed vice [[General Admiral]] of the Russian Imperial Navy. Nikolay Krabbe died on January 3, 1876  &lt;ref&gt;[http://khasan-district.narod.ru/directory/person/krabbe.htm  Краббе, Николай Карлович (1814 - 1876)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.risorden.ru/publi/pub_stal.htm  Николай Кедров -Стальная независимость]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Francisco "Paco" Rabaneda Cuervo''' (born 18 February 1934), more commonly known under the pseudonym of  '''Paco Rabanne''' ({{IPA-fr|pako ʁaban|lang}}; {{IPA-es|ˈpako raˈβan|lang}}), is a [[Spanish people|Spanish]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.monsieur-biographie.com/celebrite/biographie/paco_rabanne-5802.php&lt;/ref&gt;  [[fashion design]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;er of [[Basque people|Basque]] origin who became known as ''[[l'enfant terrible]]'' (unruly child) of the [[1960s in fashion|1960s]] French fashion world.

==Early life and education==
Rabanne was born 18 February 1934 in the Basque town of [[Pasajes]], Gipuzkoa province. His father, a [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican]] Colonel, was executed by [[Francisco Franco|Francoist]] troops during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. He fled [[Spain]] for [[France]] with his mother after the Francoists won the war, in 1939. His education was originally in [[architecture]].

== Career ==
=== Fashion ===
[[File:1 Million PL.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Rabanne's 1 Million eau de toilette spray]]
[[File:Rabanne.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Paco Rabanne metal and plastic dress, 1967]]
He started his career in fashion by creating jewelry for [[Givenchy]], [[Christian Dior|Dior]], and [[Balenciaga]] and founded his own fashion house in 1966. He used unconventional material such as metal, paper, and plastic for his [[Metal Couture]] and outlandish and flamboyant designs.

Rabanne is known for the green costume worn by Jane Fonda in the 1968 [[Science fiction|science-fiction]] [[Science fiction film|film]] ''[[Barbarella (film)|Barbarella]]''. [[Françoise Hardy]] was a big fan of Rabanne's designs. The popular French singer [[Mylène Farmer]] continues to bring the extravagance of Paco Rabanne to her live concerts.&lt;ref&gt;Mylène Farmer ''[[Live à Bercy]]'' – Creation des costumes&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Beauty ===
In 1968, he began collaborating with fragrance company [[Puig (company)|Puig]], which resulted in the company marketing Rabanne's perfumes.&lt;ref name="PR"&gt;La Vanguardia, 9 October 2011, Supplement  Diners, page 14&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, the company built a perfume factory in [[Chartres]], [[France]].&lt;ref name="Chartres"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/2005/03/15/pagina-43/34731561/pdf.html?search=Chartres%20puig | title = To be multinational in Spain costs a lot, because the domestic market is too small | accessdate = 9 May 2012 | publisher = La Vanguardia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, in [[Brazil]], his men's perfume brand registration was forfeited due to a court judgement that the brand was never officially present in Brazil despite heavy advertising and a strong local awareness. The court reasoned that because the Puig's local distributor was smuggling perfume into Brazil, the company could not show proof of payment of import duties. It took six or seven years to recover his brand name in Brazil.&lt;ref name="Luxury"&gt;{{cite book | title=Luxury Brand Management | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | author=Chevalier, Michel | year=2012 | location=Singapore | isbn=978-1-118-17176-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Rabanne opened in [[Moscow]], Russia, the first exhibition of his drawings. His reasoning for showing the drawings then was, "I am 72 years old and I wanted to present my drawings this year before disappearing from this planet. I have not shown them to anyone except [[Salvador Dalí]] 30 years ago who told me to keep going." One of the [[black-and-white]] sketches depicts a child letting go of a dove and a white balloon into the sky, which he said was inspired by the commemoration ceremony for the 2004 [[Beslan school hostage crisis|Beslan attack]] in [[Beslan]], [[North Ossetia]], in which 319 hostages were killed, including 186 children, 12 servicemen, and 31 hostage-takers. Rabanne wanted the money that the drawing sold for to go to the women of Beslan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title=French Designer Paco Rabanne Shows Drawings in Moscow  | publisher=ARTINFO  | date= 5 October 2005 | url=http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/1269/french-designer-paco-rabanne-shows-drawings-in-moscow/ | accessdate=20 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Rabanne visited [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]]. He summed up the changes since the [[Orange Revolution]]: "Ukraine reminds me of a flower unfolding its petals before my very eyes."&lt;ref&gt;[[Olena Golub]] (2006).

'''Peng Chong''' ({{zh|c=彭冲}}; March 1915 &amp;ndash; October 18, 2010 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bestjerseys.tk/former-vice-chairman-of-npc-standing-committee-died-at-the-age-of-96-year-old-peng-chong/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120727084048/http://bestjerseys.tk/former-vice-chairman-of-npc-standing-committee-died-at-the-age-of-96-year-old-peng-chong/ |archivedate=2012-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;), born '''Xu Tieru''' ({{zh|c=許鐵如|labels=no}}), was a member of the [[Chinese Communist Party | Chinese Communist Party (CCP)]] [[Central Committee]] (1969–87) and its [[politburo]] (1977–82); and [[Secretary-General of the National People's Congress|Secretary General]] of the [[National People’s Congress]] between 1988 and 1992.

==Pre-1949==
Peng Chong, originally named Xu Tieru (許鐵如), was born in [[Zhangzhou]], [[Fujian]] in 1915. Unlike most CCP leaders of his generation, he graduated from middle school, and by the age of 15 was active in underground communist activities in his home county. As leader of the local student movement, he joined the [[Communist Youth League]] in 1933, and the [[Communist Party of China|Party]] a year later, eventually rising to the post of local Organization Department Director.&lt;ref name="who"&gt;Editorial Board, ''Who’s Who in China: Current Leaders'', (Foreign Language Press, Beijing: 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|528}}
In 1938, Peng was a regimental political officer in the central [[Jiangsu]] [[New Fourth Army]], a district administrator (1938–39) in Wuxian, and back to being a regimental cadre in 1940-42 in the 52nd Regiment of the 18th Brigade, 6th Division, under [[Tan Zhenlin]] and [[Rao Shoukun]].&lt;ref name="Lampton"&gt;Lampton, David M., ''Paths to Power: Elite Mobility in Contemporary China'', "Michigan Monographs in Chinese Studies No. 55," The University of Michigan (Ann Arbor: 1986).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|60}} At the close of the war, Peng was county CCP Secretary in Taizhou (1945).

During the post-war reorganization, the New Fourth Army was merged into the East China Field Army and, later, the Third Field Army. In 1947-49, Peng served as deputy political commissar for the 6th Division, under [[Rao Shushi]].

==Post-1949==
Peng Chong emerged from the civil war as provincial government deputy secretary general,&lt;ref name="Lampton"/&gt;{{rp|62}} and Director of the Fujian Province CCP United Front Department (UFD), and deputy head of the East China’s Bureau UFD.&lt;ref name="who"/&gt;{{rp|529}} The latter work put him in close contact with overseas Chinese groups, Hong Kong and Taiwanese communities outside Taiwan. Peng’s work in Fujian put him in close contact with future leaders such as [[Ye Fei]], [[Fang Yi]] and [[Xu Jiatun]].

After working in Fujian reconstruction for several years, Peng served briefly in the party’s East China Bureau in 1954, and then was named Mayor and CCP Deputy Secretary of [[Nanjing]], in the summer of 1955.&lt;ref name="who"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lampton"/&gt;{{rp|67}} In 1956, he took over as 1st Secretary from [[Xu Jiatun]]. He appears to have warmly embraced the "Hundred Flowers" liberalization movement, and equally enthusiastically crushed it when the time came.&lt;ref name="Lampton"/&gt;{{rp|73–76}} His response to the [[Great Leap Forward]] was similar: in March 1958, [[Mao Zedong]] singled out Nanjing and [[Tianjin]] as laggards, after which Peng modestly increased his official enthusiasm.&lt;ref name="Lampton"/&gt;{{rp|80–83}} In January 1959, he was elevated to the provincial CCP Standing Committee, and some months later gave up his position as mayor of Nanjing.

In 1960, Peng moved into provincial-level work full-time, and relinquished his position as head of the Nanjing party apparatus, a promotion that enabled him to visit the [[USSR]] in 1962. However, sometime between December 1962 and January 1964 (reports differ&lt;ref name="Lampton"/&gt;{{rp|87}}), Peng once again was identified as Nanjing 1st Secretary, yet retained his provincial culture and media posts. At the end of 1965, he was elevated to the post of Secretary of the provincial CCP Secretariat, a role in charge of day-to-day party affairs.

==Cultural Revolution==
The Jiangsu provincial leadership was broadly targeted for "struggle" in the [[Cultural Revolution]], and responded with the typical effort to control the [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guard]], battle radicals with outside workers and, inevitably, violence.&lt;ref name="Lampton"/&gt;{{rp|89}} While the more forceful responses would have been the responsibility of more senior people such as [[Nanjing Military Region]] Commander [[Xu Shiyou]], Peng’s involvement in the first phases is clear.

Peng was denounced by the Red Guard in 1967 for his official visit to the USSR and his post-trip comment that China might learn something from Soviet art. Nevertheless, he was named the sole civilian provincial Revolutionary Committee Vice Chair in March 1968. Aligning his star with the armed forces led to Alternate Membership of the [[9th National People’s Congress]] Central Committee a year later.&lt;ref name="Lampton"/&gt;{{rp|90–91}} When order, and the provincial party committee were restored in 1970, Peng was made a Deputy Secretary, again as the sole civilian.

Xu Shiyou’s 1974 transfer to [[Guangzhou]] opened up space for Peng Chong to become 1st CCP Secretary and Chairman of the Jiangsu Revolutionary Committee. This brief role positioned him to play a more pivotal role in neutralizing the [[Gang of Four]]’s supporters in Shanghai following the October 1976 coup d’état. Peng, General [[Su Zhenhua]] and labor politico [[Ni Zhifu]] were sent to Shanghai to take power from the radical left, while long-time ally Xu Jiatun remained behind as Jiangsu secretary.&lt;ref name="Lampton"/&gt;{{rp|94}}

==National Affairs==
Although Peng was nominally 3rd CCP Secretary of Shanghai, his two nominal superiors’ national-level responsibilities left him as de facto boss. As a reward for his loyalty and efficiency in purging Shanghai, he was elevated to the politburo in August 1977. Peng added a [[National People's Congress]] (NPC) Vice Chairmanship to his titles (1978–87), and was formally named Shanghai 1st Secretary in early 1979, due to Su Zhenhua’s death, and mayor at the end of the year. He remained affiliated with Shanghai until 1981, when he was succeeded in the party and state roles by [[Chen Guodong]] and [[Wang Daohan]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, Malcolm,  ''Directory of Officials and Organizations in China, 1968-83'', M.E. Sharpe (Armonk: 1983), p. 491-492.&lt;/ref&gt; Among his top priorities was establishing a merit-based education system.&lt;ref name="Lampton"/&gt;{{rp|98–99}}

In 1980, Peng was promoted to work directly for [[Hu Yaobang]] in the CCP Central Committee Secretariat, his first move out of provincial politics. However, in September 1982, at the 12th National Party Congress, Peng Chong lost his politburo seat and that on the Secretariat. His last posts were as Vice Chairman and Secretary-General (1988–93) of the National People’s Congress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinavitae.com/biography/Peng_Chong China Vitae : Biography of Peng Chong&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1615">'''Ponç de la Guàrdia''' (or '''Pons de la Guardia'''; [[floruit|fl.]] 1154–1188) was a Catalan [[knight]] of the family of [[Saguàrdia]], lords of the [[castle]] of [[Ripoll]]. He was not a professional [[jongleur]], but a [[troubadour]] who wrote songs for amusement which were much celebrated, so we are told, by [[Occitan]] women.

Ponç participated in the [[Siege of Conca]] (1177) on the side of [[Alfonso II of Aragon]] and a little later in the campaign to bring [[Raymond V of Toulouse]] to heel.

He wrote four amorous compositions which form a small cycle dedicated to an anonymous lady called "On-tot-mi-platz". It has been suggested by one editor of his works, that nine of his songs form a cycle with the plot of a ''roman d'amour'', but the ordering of these cycles is not the same in the different manuscripts, one of which considers them anonymous.&lt;ref&gt;Bossy, 277.&lt;/ref&gt; Ponç is one of the few troubadours suspected of anthologising his own works. Though his work is all in Occitan, some [[Catalan language|Catalan]] words make appearances.

'''Robert Morris, Jr.''' (January 20, 1734 – May 8, 1806), a [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Father]] of the United States, was an English-born American merchant who financed the [[American Revolution]], oversaw the striking of the [[Nova Constellatio|first coins of the United States]],&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, David, "Nova Constellatio: Identifying the First US Coin"; The Numismatist 08/2017 https://www.money.org/nova-constellatio&lt;/ref&gt; and signed the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], the [[Articles of Confederation|Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union]], and the [[United States Constitution]]. Along with [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[Albert Gallatin]], he is widely regarded as one of the founders of the financial system of the [[United States]].

Born in [[Liverpool]], Morris migrated to the United States in his teens, quickly becoming a successful businessman. In the aftermath of the [[French and Indian War]] (1754–1763), Morris became a prominent opponent of unpopular British policies like the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]] in 1765. He was elected to the [[Pennsylvania Assembly]], became the chairman of the Pennsylvania [[Committee of Safety (American Revolution)|Committee of Safety]], and was chosen as a delegate to the [[Second Continental Congress]]. He served as chairman of the "Secret Committee of Trade" and as a member of the [[Committee of Correspondence]]. Though reluctant to break with Britain, he ultimately came to support the independence movement and emerged as an important financier of the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775–1783).

From 1781 to 1784, he served as the [[Superintendent of Finance of the United States]], a forerunner to the position of [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|U.S. Secretary of the Treasury]]. As the central civilian in the government, Morris was, next to [[George Washington in the American Revolution|General George Washington]], "the most powerful man in America".&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Rappleye|Rappleye, Charles]]. ''Robert Morris: Financier of the American Revolution''. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 2010. {{ISBN|978-1-4165-7091-2}}. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; His [[American Revolution#Finance|successful administration]] led to the sobriquet, "Financier of the Revolution". At the same time he was [[Agent of Marine]], a position he took without pay, and from which he controlled the [[Continental Navy]]. He successfully proposed numerous policies including the creation of a national bank, but many of his ideas were not enacted. In 1783, Morris oversaw the creation of the first US coins, the [[Nova Constellatio]] patterns, which illustrated his plan for a national decimal coinage; although the plan was not adopted, his coins were examined by both [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]], influencing both men in their creation of the decimal monetary system that is used by the United States today.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coinworld.com/news/us-coins/2015/07/nova-constellatio-patterns-among-earliest-us-coins.all.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 1787, he was elected as a delegate to the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Philadelphia Convention]], which created a more powerful federal government.

Morris declined Washington's offer to serve as the nation's first Treasury Secretary, instead suggesting that Washington appoint Hamilton to the position. Morris represented Pennsylvania in the [[United States Senate|Senate]] from 1789 to 1795, during which time he aligned with the [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist Party]] and supported Hamilton's economic policies. Morris invested a considerable portion of his fortune in land shortly before the [[Panic of 1796–97|Panic of 1796–1797]], which led to his bankruptcy in 1798, and he spent several years in [[debtors' prison]], until the [[United States Congress]] passed a bankruptcy act to release him. After he left prison in 1801, he lived a quiet, private life in a modest home in [[Philadelphia]] until his death in 1806.

==Early life==
Morris was born to Robert Morris, Sr. and Elizabeth Murphet in [[Toxteth]], [[Liverpool]], [[Lancashire]], [[England]], on January 20, 1734. At the age of 13, Morris immigrated to [[Oxford, Maryland]], to live with his father, who was a tobacco [[Factor (agent)|factor]]. As a youth, Morris was provided a tutor and was a quick learner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcfl.org/mdroom/worthies/morris.html|title=Robert Morris:  The Oxford Merchant 1711–1750|website=www.tcfl.org|access-date=2017-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His father sent him to [[Philadelphia]] to study where he stayed with Charles Greenway, a family friend. Greenway arranged for young Robert to become an apprentice at the shipping and banking firm of the Philadelphia merchant (and then mayor) [[Charles Willing]]. A year later, Robert's father died after being wounded in an accident when hit by the [[wadding]] of a ship's gun that was fired in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;Rappleye. ''Robert Morris''. p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

When Charles Willing died in 1754, his son [[Thomas Willing]] made Morris his partner at age 24. They established the prominent shipping-banking firm of Willing, Morris &amp; Co. on May 1, 1757. The partnership lasted until about 1779.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://constitutionday.com/constitution-founding-fathers-2.html|title=Founding Fathers – U.S. Constitution|website=constitutionday.com|access-date=2017-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal and family life==
On March 2, 1769, at age 35, Morris married 20-year-old Mary White. White was the daughter of a wealthy and prestigious Maryland landholder, but was residing in [[Philadelphia]]. Together they had five sons and two daughters. White came from a prominent family in Maryland; her brother was the well-known Episcopal [[William White (Bishop of Pennsylvania)|Bishop William White]].&lt;ref&gt;Rappleye. ''Robert Morris''. pp. 22, 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Morris worshipped in Philadelphia at [[St. Peter's Church, Philadelphia|St. Peter's Church]] on Pine Street and [[Christ Church, Philadelphia|Christ Church]] on 2nd Street, both of which were run by his brother-in-law, William White. Morris remained a constant worshipper and supporter of these congregations for his entire life. Both Morris and White are buried in the churchyard located at 2nd and Market Sts.&lt;ref name=r1&gt;[http://www.christchurchphila.org/Historic-Christ-Church/Burial-Ground/The-Graves/98/ The Graves] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110921032132/http://www.christchurchphila.org/Historic-Christ-Church/Burial-Ground/The-Graves/98/ |date=September 21, 2011 }}. Christ Church, Philadelphia&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the locations and reputations of Christ Church and St. Peter’s Church in Philadelphia, they served as places of worship for a number of the notable members of the Continental Congress, sometimes including George Washington.

===Shipping and slavery===
In 1757, Morris became a business partner with [[Thomas Willing]]. Their partnership was a merchant firm with interests in shipping, real estate, and other lines of business. The partnership was forged just after the [[Seven Years' War]] began (1754–1763), which hindered attracting the usual supply of new indentured servants to the colony.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond A. Mohl (1997), ''The Making of Urban America,&lt;/ref&gt; Potential immigrants were conscripted in England to fight in Europe, and the contracts for those already in the colonies in America were expiring.&lt;ref&gt;David Waldstreicher (2005), ''Runaway America: Benjamin Franklin, Slavery, and the American Revolution,''&lt;/ref&gt; Indentured servants could legally break their contracts to join the British forces to fight against the French and their Indian allies.

At the same time, the British Crown wanted to encourage the [[slave trade]] which was profitable for the King's political allies in the [[African Company of Merchants]]. While Morris was a junior partner and Willing was pursuing a political career, the company Willing, Morris &amp; Co. co-signed a petition calling for the repeal of Pennsylvania's tariff on imported slaves. (About 200 slaves were imported into Philadelphia in 1762, the height of the trade; most were brought in by the Rhode Islanders D'Wolf, [[Aaron Lopez]], and Jacob Rivera.&lt;ref&gt;Joe William Trotter Jr. and Eric Ledell Smith, ''African Americans in Pennsylvania,'' (Pennsylvania State University Press, 1997). p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;)

Willing, Morris &amp; Co funded its own slave-trading voyage. The ship did not carry enough to be profitable and, during a second trip, was captured by French [[privateers]]. The firm handled two slave auctions for other importers, offering a total of 23 slaves.&lt;ref&gt;''Pennsylvania Gazette'' items # 25284, 26076, 26206, 26565, 28558, 28712, 36325, in 1765&lt;/ref&gt; In 1762, the firm advertised an agency sale in Wilmington, Delaware for over 100 Gold Coast slaves. The ship had docked in Wilmington to avoid the tariff.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afrolumens.org/slavery/buying.html ''Pennsylvania Gazette''], May 6, 1762. Note: This arrangement made it easy for Pennsylvania slave-buyers to avoid paying the tariff.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1765, on their last reported agency deal (out of a total of eight), the firm advertised 17 slaves who were brought in from Africa on the ship ''Marquis de Granby''.&lt;ref&gt;''Pennsylvania Gazette,'' July 25, 1765&lt;/ref&gt; The slaves were not sold in Philadelphia, as the owner took the ship and all the slaves to Jamaica.&lt;ref&gt;''The Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade'' CD-ROM, published by the Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Both partners authored the non-importation agreements that marked the end of all trade with Britain, including the importation of slaves. Robert Morris led to the abolition of the slave trade in the north not due to a moral obligation but to remove request for his daily life from those in the north.  They became advocates for free trade, which would end the kind of trade restrictions that gave rise to the business. As a government official, Morris tried to tax the domestic slave trade, and to lay a head tax on the slaves payable by the owner. His efforts were resisted by the Southerners who fought all his measures. Pennsylvania passed a law for gradual abolition of slavery in 1780 at his lead. Philadelphia County at the time had no slave registrations making it impossible to determine who in Philadelphia owned slaves in 1780. Western farmers petitioned the Assembly for relief from the abolition law, but Morris's allies in the state government resisted these attempts.&lt;ref&gt;Journals of the Assembly 1781, pp, 570, 573, 581, 586, 591, 594–95, 601, 690, 693&lt;/ref&gt; Morris commented that slave trading was not profitable and would prefer blankets and the speed of trips to England over slave trade to Africa and virtually eliminated the slave trade to the northern colonies. Morris's efforts led to the virtual end of slavery in the north before the revolutionary war.

Willing, Morris &amp; Co. ships traded with India, the [[Levant]], the [[West Indies]], Spanish [[Cuba]], Spain, and Italy. The firm's business of import, export, and general agency made it one of the most prosperous in Pennsylvania. In 1784, Morris, with other investors, underwrote the voyage of the ship ''[[Empress of China (1783)|Empress of China]]'', the first American vessel to visit the Chinese mainland. Among the investors were [[Samuel Miles]], who built a sugar refinery in Philadelphia; John Holker, French Agent; and Daniel Parker, merchant. The ship embarked from New York harbor for China on [[George Washington|Washington]]'s birthday, February 22, 1784.

In 1786 Washington wrote to Morris discussing his hopes for the democratic process bringing an end to slavery. His reference to how escaped slaves made their way to the North is taken as the first reference and led to Robert Morris funding the initial aspects of this enterprise [[Underground Railroad]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part2/2h66.html Part 2: ''Africans in America''], PBS, accessed August 15, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The 1790 census is the first in Philadelphia County that lists slaveholders by name.

===Conflict with Britain===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}
The [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]] of 1765–1766 was a tax on all legal documents. The merchants banded together to end what they saw as an unconstitutional tax. Morris began his public career in 1765 by serving on a local committee of merchants organized to protest the Stamp Act. He mediated between a mass meeting of protesters and the Stamp Tax collector, whose house they threatened to pull down "brick by brick" unless the collector did not carry out his job. Morris remained loyal to Britain, but he believed that the new laws constituted taxation without representation and violated the colonists' rights as British citizens. In the end, Britain lifted the stamp tax.

After Britain passed the Tea Tax, the tea ship ''Polly'' reached the lower Delaware Bay. Philadelphia ordered the bay pilots not to bring it to port. Morris was a warden of the port at that time. Captain Ayers brought the ''Polly'' into port by following another ship up the bay which set off a protest. At least 20 percent of the population filled the street as Ayers was escorted to the State House. A meeting with Ayers and the port wardens, including Morris, was held. Ayers agreed to leave Philadelphia without delivering any taxed tea.

==Continental Congress==
[[File:Robert Morris circa 1876.jpg|thumb|An engraving by Ole Erekson, {{circa|1876}}, of Robert Morris]]
[[File:NH 85212-KN.jpg|thumb|USS ''Alfred'']]
Morris was elected to the Pennsylvania Council of Safety (1775–1776), the [[committee of correspondence|Committee of Correspondence]], the [[Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly|Provincial Assembly]] (1775–1776), and the [[Pennsylvania General Assembly|Pennsylvania legislature]] (1776–1778). He was also elected to represent Pennsylvania in the [[Second Continental Congress]] from 1775 to 1778.

In 1775 the Continental Congress contracted with Morris's company to work with the Secret Committee of Trade after March 14, 1776. He devised a system to smuggle war supplies from France a year before independence was declared. He handled much of the financial transactions, contracting with merchants and business firms to obtain needed war material and purchasing commodities for export to pay for it.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth M. Nuxoll, ''Congress and the Munitions Merchants'' (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

He served with [[John Adams]] on the committee that wrote the [[Model Treaty]]. The Model Treaty incorporated his long held belief in [[free trade]]. It was an outgrowth of his trading system, and acted as the basis for the [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|1778 Treaty with France.]]

He served on the Marine and Maritime Committees and gave his best ship, ''The Black Prince,'' to the Continental Congress along with over 1900 other ships from his personal navy. It was renamed as the [[USS Alfred (1774)|USS ''Alfred'']], the first ship in the Mid-Atlantic area Second Squadron of ships Continental Navy. [[John Barry (1745-1803)|John Barry]], a captain who sailed for his company, became the captain of the ''Alfred.'' The first Continental Navy ship, the Hannah, was commissioned on September 2, 1775 in Marblehead, Massachusetts, and was one of the seven "Washington Cruisers" commissioned by Commander in Chief George Washington to attack British supply ships at sea headed for Boston. The Hannah was named for the wife of Colonel, later General, [[John Glover (general)|John Glover]], its owner, who was key in the evacuation of the Continental Army at [[Battle of Long Island|Brooklyn Heights]] in August 1776, and in Crossing the Delaware to attack [[Battle of Trenton|Trenton]] on the morning of December 26, 1776.

Morris used his extensive international trading network as a spy network and gathered intelligence on British troop movements. One of his spies sent the information that allowed the Americans to defend [[Fort Moultrie]] near [[Charleston, South Carolina]].

On July 1, 1776, Morris voted against the Congressional motion for independence. The Pennsylvania delegation, which was split 4–3, cast its vote in the negative. The following day, Morris and [[John Dickinson]] agreed to abstain, allowing the other Pennsylvania delegates to vote for independence. Robert Morris vote of abstention is considered the most pivotal in the process as he was a needed entity for the revolution. The final vote was 12 states in favor and no states opposed. (New York's delegates voted later.) On August 2, Morris signed the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] saying, "I am not one of those politicians that run testy when my own plans are not adopted. I think it is the duty of a good citizen to follow when he cannot lead." and "While I do not wish to see my countrymen die on the field of battle nor do I wish to see them live in tyranny".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Morris to Horatio Gates, Philadelphia, October 27, 1776, cited in "The Founders on the Founders" ed. by John P. Kaminski, U. VA. Press 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financed the war===
[[Image:Commerce in The Apotheosis of Washington.jpg|300px|thumb|right|A scene from ''[[The Apotheosis of Washington]]'' shows Morris receiving a bag of gold from [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], commemorating his financial services during the Revolutionary War]]
Morris personally paid £100,000,000 (about £4,500,000,000 today) to pay the Continental troops under Washington. During the war the combined expenditures of Robert Morris towards the American Revolution and subsequent events would be in excess of $300,000,000 (about $15,575,000,000 today) not including materials and ships and the balance of the colonist would contribute $800,000 (about $36,000,000 today). He helped to keep the Army together just before the [[Battle of Princeton]]. He subsequently paid from his own funds the troops via "Morris Notes" to continue Washington's ability to wage war as the US currency had no value.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

In March 1778, Morris signed the [[Articles of Confederation]] as a representative of Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;[[Articles of Confederation#Signers]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=November 2017}}

During the war, [[privateer]]s seized the cargo of English ships. Morris owned an interest in many of the privateers and his firm helped sell the English spoils as they came into port. In addition to owning ships that carried cargo to Cuba, France, and Spain, he was accused of [[War profiteering|profiteering]], but these accusations were proven to be false. John Jay, the president of Congress, even wrote him an apology.&lt;ref&gt;Letters of Delegates to Congress, 12:75&lt;/ref&gt; Morris wrote a friend that his firm had had over 1000 ships during the war and so came out "about even". He had lost one of the largest private navies in the world during the War, but he never asked for reimbursement from the new government. Morris also personally supplied the funding for 90 percent of all bullets fired during the war and almost 95 percent of all other expenses for the fledgling government, though he also never asked to be reimbursed for these expenses. He used his remaining money to buy shares in a variety of ships that waged an economic war on Britain. During this period he acted as a commercial agent for John Holker, a French national who was one of many military contractors who dealt with the French and American forces.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

While many in popular culture often make reference to the size of John Hancock's signature on the Declaration of Independence, it was the Rob Morris that led the King to refer to as the "most damming name of all".

During this time [[Thomas Paine]], [[Henry Laurens]], and others criticized him and his firm for alleged war profiteering. In 1779, a congressional committee acquitted Morris and his firm on charges of engaging in improper financial transactions, but his reputation was damaged after this incident. Robert Morris told the committee "I lost over 1000 ships and gained some beaver pelts... ."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://constitutioncenter.org/learn/educational-resources/founding-fathers/pennsylvania#robert_morris|title=Pennsylvania – National Constitution Center|website=National Constitution Center – constitutioncenter.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after serving in the Congress, Morris served two more terms in the state legislature, from 1778 to 1781. While he was in the Pennsylvania Assembly, Morris worked on the constitution and legislation to restore checks and balances, and to overturn the [[religious test]] laws. These had excluded from voting 40 percent of the state's citizens, including Quakers, Jews, and Mennonites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Highways of Man – Volume 2: The Odyssey Almanac|last=Machat|first=Steven|publisher=Consciousness Manifesto Inc|year=2011|asin=B006X813B8|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 4, 1779, an angry mob, who supported the "Constitutionalist" faction in opposition to Morris and his allies, tried to chase [[James Wilson]] from his home in Philadelphia. The mob was in the process of aiming a cannon at Wilson's home when the [[First Troop Philadelphia City Cavalry|First City Troop]] came to his rescue. Five men were killed in the battle of "Fort Wilson". Constitutionalists in Pennsylvania ran off their political opposites and confiscated their property. James Wilson went on to argue against slavery, defend [[Haym Salomon]] from fraud, sign the Constitution, and become a Supreme Court justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Collected Works of James Wilson: In Two Volumes|last=Wilson|first=James|publisher=Liberty Fund|year=2009|isbn=086597683X|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Morris supplied the majority of war materials to the troops when the state failed to act. Pennsylvania went bankrupt in 1780 due to Constitutionalist policies which mandated state-controlled markets and self-imposed embargoes. Ultimately the state called on Morris to restore the economy. He did so by opening the ports to trade, and allowing the market to set the value of goods and the currency.&lt;ref&gt;Paul A. Gilje, William Pencak, [https://books.google.com/books?id=MZJcvuhJGJsC&amp;pg=PA158&amp;lpg=PA158&amp;dq=anti-federalist+%22price+controls%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nUu1ElMViF&amp;sig=Kt_XgqBhaCJOMyKU6U0asB9FLJo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjKnKfa1tnNAhWL1ywKHYBfDBAQ6AEINDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=anti-federalist%20%22price%20controls%22&amp;f=false "Title of article"], ''New York in the Age of the Constitution, 1775–1800'', date&lt;/ref&gt;

===Superintendent of Finance of the United States===
{{refimprove section|date=February 2014}}
In 1781, the US was in a crisis. The British controlled the coast line from the sea, two major cities, and the western frontier. The treasury was in debt by $25 million (about ${{Formatprice|{{inflation|US|25000000|1800|r=0}}}} today) and public [[credit (finance)|credit]] had collapsed, of which he again paid this debt from his personal funds. With the failure of their own policies, Congress changed from the committee systems they had used for years and created the first executive offices in American history. Morris held the offices of Finance and Marine. His detractors worried he was gaining "dictatorial powers". In a unanimous vote, Congress appointed Morris to be [[Superintendent of Finance of the United States]] from 1781 to 1784. In defending himself from would-be critics, Morris insisted Congress allow him to continue his private endeavors while serving in a related public office. He was not active in private business during this term but remained a silent partner in various companies.&lt;ref name="sdbis"&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert Morris|url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/declaration/bio33.htm|work=Signers of the Declaration Biographically Sketches|publisher=National Park Services|accessdate=April 4, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018201921/http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/declaration/bio33.htm|archivedate=October 18, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three days after becoming Superintendent of Finance, Morris proposed to establish a national bank, as urged by [[Alexander Hamilton]]. The first financial institution chartered by the United States, the [[Bank of North America]], was founded in 1782. The bank was funded in part by a significant loan Morris had obtained from France in 1781. The initial role of the bank was to finance the war against Britain.&lt;ref name="sdbis"/&gt;

As Superintendent of Finance, Morris instituted several reforms, including reducing the civil list, significantly cutting government spending by using competitive bidding for contracts, tightening accounting procedures, and demanding the federal government's full share of support (money and supplies) from the States.&lt;ref name="sdbis"/&gt; Morris obtained supplies for the army of [[Nathanael Greene]] in 1779, and from 1781–1783.

He took an active role in helping move Washington and his army from New York State to [[Yorktown, Virginia]]. He was in Washington's camp the day the move was initiated. He acted as quartermaster for the trip and supplied over $114 million (about ${{Formatprice|{{inflation|US|14000000|1800|r=0}}}} today) in his own credit to supply the Army. He was also Agent of Marine and coordinated with the French Navy to get Washington's Army to the [[Battle of Yorktown (1781)]]. After Yorktown, Morris noted the war had changed from a war of bullets to a war of finances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://education-curriculum-reform-government-schools.org/w/2011/09/signers-constitution-robert-morris-financier-of-the-revolution/|title=Signers of the Constitution: Robert Morris Financier of the Revolution {{!}}|website=education-curriculum-reform-government-schools.org|access-date=2017-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his tenure as Superintendent, Morris was assisted by his friend and assistant [[Gouverneur Morris]] (no relation). He proposed a national economic system in a document called "On Public Credit". This was the basis for Hamilton's plan of the same name submitted much later to Congress. The Morrises proposed to make the American currency a [[decimal currency]], a progressive idea at the time.&lt;ref name="z1SZNil2nwZk.docx"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://members.sar.org/media/uploads/pages/309/z1SZNil2nwZk.docx|title=Robert Morris |website=sar.org |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320144041/https://members.sar.org/media/uploads/pages/309/z1SZNil2nwZk.docx |archivedate=March 20, 2017 |deadurl=no |accessdate=March 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 15, 1782 Morris drafted a proposal that he later presented to the [[Continental Congress]] to recommend the establishment of a national [[mint (coin)|mint]] and decimal [[coin]]age. However, the [[United States Mint]] was not established until 1792, after further proposals by [[Alexander Hamilton|Hamilton]] and [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]].&lt;ref name="z1SZNil2nwZk.docx"/&gt;{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

As of January 1, 1783 the public debt was $42 million of which 18.77 percent was foreign debt and 81.23 percent was owned at home.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wWkuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA317&amp;dq=January+1,+1783+public+debt+35,327,769&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj0xeqYjMfbAhVCyVMKHYBcD18Q6AEILTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=January%201%2C%201783%20public%20debt%2035%2C327%2C769&amp;f=false Financial History of the United States. p. 317]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a report to the President of Congress Morris wrote:

The rest being unliquidated debts, etc., interest.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

In 1783, Morris was believed to be one of the main conspirators in the [[Newburgh Conspiracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, Paul S. ''The Enduring Vision'', 6th ed. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Morris's lifelong enemy [[Arthur Lee (diplomat)|Arthur Lee]] spread rumors about his participation. The author of the Newburgh letter was Major Armstrong, a partisan for the faction that opposed Morris's policies in the Pennsylvania state house. Its members were often allied with Lee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Papers of Robert Morris, 1781–1784: November 1, 1782 – May 4, 1783|last=Morris|first=Robert|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|year=1989|isbn=9780822934851|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Morris's resignation in 1784, a treasury board was set up including Arthur Lee; in either 1794 or 1795 those old Commercial Committee accounts&lt;ref&gt;In 1778–1779 Morris had attempted to strengthen out the accounts of the old Commercial Committee but had to give it up; he stated in answer to Paine "..the accounts of Willing and Morris with the committee had been partially settled, but were still partially open, because the transactions could not be closed up."[https://books.google.com/books?id=dLOwGSsyVosC&amp;pg=PA116&amp;dq=Arthur+lee+charges+against+robert+morris&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiWueqB3cbbAhVG3FMKHci8BGgQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=arthur%20%20lee&amp;f=false Robert Morris. p. 117]&lt;/ref&gt; were brought to a settlement—a June 1796 entry in the Treasury debt against Morris for $9,312.63.

===Morris House===
[[File:PhiladelphiaPresidentsHouse.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[President's House (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania)|President's House]], [[Philadelphia]] at 190 High Street [later 524–30 Market Street]. Morris's Philadelphia city house served as the [[White House|Executive Mansion]] for presidents George Washington and John Adams, 1790–1800. He sold it in 1795,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Market Street Philadelphia |page=106|author=Joseph Jackson|year=1918|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Jg-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA106}}&lt;/ref&gt; using the proceeds to fund construction of the L'Enfant mansion.]] In 1781, Robert Morris purchased a house at 190 High Street in Philadelphia from John Holker. He rebuilt and lived there while he was Superintendent of Finance, and Agent of Marine. When the Federal Government moved from New York, he offered his home to his friend [[George Washington]]. Washington was familiar with the place, since he had stayed there with Morris during the Constitutional Convention. [[John Adams]] occupied it in turn. Morris initially offered his city home to Washington for free, but to avoid the appearance of improper influence, he rented the house for $1 a year to the city of Philadelphia to be used as the presidential residence. Philadelphia was the temporary US capital from 1790–1800 during the construction of [[Washington, D.C.]] Morris moved next door, into another house he owned on the corner of 6th and High (Market) Sts.

The last remaining wall of [[President's House (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania)|President's House]] was taken down for redevelopment when Independence Mall was created. In the late 20th century, the foundations of the President's House were rediscovered during [[archeological]] work related to construction of the Liberty Center. The site, a few steps away from the [[Liberty Bell]], has been designated a national memorial. It is commemorated with an outline of the house indicated above ground and exhibits about the early federal period. Its interpretation focuses on the first two [[President of the United States|Presidents]], their families, and the nine enslaved Africans who worked in Washington's presidential household.

===Later political career===
[[File:RobertAndGouverneurMorris.jpg|thumb|Gouverneur Morris and Robert Morris.  [[Charles Willson Peale]], 1783.]]

In 1787, Morris was elected to the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]]. He arranged to have [[Gouverneur Morris]] appointed to the Pennsylvania delegation. Although Robert Morris said little at the Convention, Gouverneur and his lawyer, [[James Wilson]], were two of the three most talkative men there. Both opposed slavery during the Convention. Gouverneur Morris wrote the polished draft of the Constitution. While it was widely known at the time that Morris was active behind the scenes, his only significant public role of record during the Convention was to nominate his friend George Washington as its president. His nomination of Washington was done to end any questions as he was the only other person considered for that role by the leaders of the new country.

Washington wanted to appoint Morris as the first [[Secretary of the Treasury]] in 1789, but Morris declined and suggested [[Alexander Hamilton]] for the position, who supported his policies. Morris was [[United States Senate elections in Pennsylvania, 1788|elected]] by the Pennsylvania legislature to serve as a [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from 1789 to 1795. Morris was on 41 Senatorial committees and reported for many of them. He supported the Federalist economic program, which included [[internal improvements]] such as canals and lighthouses to aid commerce. As senator he generally supported the [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist]] party and backed Hamilton's economic proposals. Hamilton used principles similar to those in Morris's report "On Public Credit", submitted some 10 years earlier.

Pennsylvania State assemblyman [[Hugh Henry Brackenridge]] lost a bid for re-election because he opposed popular sentiment against the [[Bank of North America]]. At a dinner a guest accused Morris of using the bank to enrich himself personally. Brackenridge retorted, "the people are fools; if they would let Mr. Morris alone, he would make Pennsylvania a great people, but they will not suffer him to do it." Another legislator at the party, [[William Findley]] publicized the remark and the subsequent controversy led to Brackenridge's electoral defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gordon S.

In 1784 Morris was part of a syndicate that backed the sailing of the [[Empress of China (1783)]] for the China trade. On March 7, 1791, Morris obtained title to a lot from [[John Dickinson]] and wife;&lt;ref name="TAAAAMAAJ p. 363"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5m1TAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA513&amp;dq=Joshua+Francis+Fisher+on+Robert+Morris&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiSnqOl99XbAhVDulMKHbUUCRQQ6AEIVTAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Morris%20folly&amp;f=false The Historic Mansions and Buildings of Philadelphia: With Some Notice of ... p. 363]&lt;/ref&gt; on March 9, 1793, the site was surveyed; it wasn't until 1794 he began construction of a mansion on Chestnut Street in Philadelphia designed by [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant]].

Despite the spent amount of £6138 5s 10d the structure was never completed.&lt;ref name="TAAAAMAAJ p. 363"/&gt;  The unfinished mansion became known as "Morris's folly",&lt;ref name="nps"&gt;[http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/declaration/bio33.htm National Park Service – Signers of the Declaration (Robert Morris)&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018201921/http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/declaration/bio33.htm|date=October 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the land eventually became [[Jewelers' Row, Philadelphia|Sansom Street]]. Marble from this house was purchased by [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe|Latrobe]]; he used it to adorn buildings and monuments from [[Rhode Island]] to [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charlestown]], [[South Carolina]].

A partner of Morris in the Phelps and Gorham Purchase was land speculator [[James Greenleaf]]. Morris' purchase from Massachusetts was for some {{convert|3,750,000|acre|km2}}. Morris almost immediately resold {{convert|12000000|acre|km2 sqmi}} through his London agent [[William Temple Franklin]] to [[The Pulteney Association|the Pulteney Associates]], led by Sir William Pulteney. He sold at more than double the price he had paid. Sir [[Sir William Pulteney, 5th Baronet|William Pulteney]] bought 9/12ths interest, [[William Henry Hornby (1805–1884)|William Hornby]] 2/12ths, and [[Patrick Colquhoun]] 1/12th interest. At the time non-citizens could not legally hold title to land. The buyers sent Charles Williamson from Scotland, and he was naturalized on January 9, 1792, in order to permit him to hold the land in trust for the owners. He relocated to the United States in February 1792 and settled on the tract.&lt;ref name="ZwvAAAAYAAJ p. 26"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gZwvAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA24-IA4&amp;dq=Charles+Williamson+and+the+Phelps+Gorham+purchase&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiYrZCZuY3cAhVj54MKHSYMCGUQ6AEIOjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Charles%20Williamson%20and%20the%20Phelps%20Gorham%20purchase&amp;f=false "The Title of the Phelps and Gorham Purchase" Howard Lawrence Osgood p. 26]&lt;/ref&gt;  Morris conveyed the deed to Williamson on April 11, 1792 and was paid $333,333 (£75,000).

This {{convert|500,000|acre|km2}} tract was known as the [[The Morris Reserve|Morris Reserve]]. At the north end of the Morris Reserve, Morris sold a {{convert|87000|acre|km2|adj=on}} triangular-shaped tract to Herman Leroy, William Bayard, and John McEvers. This was nicknamed the Triangle Tract. A {{convert|100000|acre|sqkm|adj=on}} tract due west of the Triangle Tract was sold to the State of [[Connecticut]].

His son [[Thomas Morris (New York politician)|Thomas]] settled the peace with the Six Nations of the [[Iroquois]] Confederacy, four of whom had sided with the British during the Revolution. Then Morris sold most of the vast tract of property to the [[Holland Land Company]] in 1792–1793 for redevelopment in parcels;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nyheritage.org/collections/holland-land-company-maps|title=Holland Land Company Maps {{!}} New York Heritage|website=www.nyheritage.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} another source identifies the sale date as being approximately five years later, in 1797–1798.&lt;ref name="Redbook" /&gt;

Besides Land Speculation, Morris founded several canal companies: [Similar to the [[Potomac Company]]], two Pennsylvania canal companies were set up to  try to link the produce of the western lands with the eastern markets; they were the [[Schuylkill and Susquehanna Navigation Company]] chartered September 29, 1791 and the [[Schuylkill and Susquehanna Navigation Company#Schuylkill and Susquehanna Navigation Company|Delaware and Schuylkill Canal Company]] chartered April 10, 1792, Morris was president of both companies;&lt;ref name="KAAAAIAAJ p. 44"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tkcKAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=Robert+Morris+of+the+Schuylkill+and+Susquehanna+Navigation+company&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjK0qDWruDbAhXG24MKHRyIBcMQ6AEIMzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Robert%20Morris%20of%20the%20Schuylkill%20and%20Susquehanna%20Navigation%20company&amp;f=false Development of Transportation Systems in the United States: Comprising a ... p. 44]&lt;/ref&gt; he was also involved with a steam engine company, and launched a [[hot air balloon]] from his garden on Market Street.

===Land speculation===
As part of the effort to repay France for loans that financed the war, Morris contracted to supply 20,000 hogsheads of tobacco annually to France beginning in 1785. Shortly after these contracts were signed, Ambassador Thomas Jefferson took it upon himself to interfere with these arrangements and that brought about the collapse of the tobacco market. This not only harmed Morris, but it forced the French Crown to look elsewhere for tax revenue, and that was the genesis for the French revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Papers of Robert Morris, 9:152–56&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1787, Morris was sued in Virginia by [[Carter Braxton]] for £28,257; the lawsuit continued for eight years before commissioners were appointed, then Morris appealed. Finally Virginia's Court of Appeals led by Edmund Pendleton decided mostly in favor of Braxton before Morris was forced into bankruptcy by his own continued land speculations (although Morris as late as 1800 believed he should have won £20,000). By Morris's own admission the beginning of his bankruptcy began with the failure of John Warder &amp; Co. of Dublin and  Donald and Burton of London in the spring of 1793.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5m1TAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA513&amp;dq=Joshua+Francis+Fisher+on+Robert+Morris&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiSnqOl99XbAhVDulMKHbUUCRQQ6AEIVTAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Morris%20folly&amp;f=false The Historic Mansions and Buildings of Philadelphia: With Some Notice of ... p. 364 Morris 1799 Bankrupt petition]&lt;/ref&gt; Morris was deeply involved in land speculation, especially after the Revolutionary War;(See [[Phelps and Gorham Purchase]] of 1791 above); on April 22, 1794 Morris entered into an association  called the Asylum Company with [[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/169639833/john-nicholson John Nicholson]], [who had served as Comptroller-General of the state of Pennsylvania from 1782 to 1794] to purchase 1,000,000 acres of Pennsylvania land besides land they already had title to in [[Luzerne County]]; [[Northumberland County, Pennsylvania|Northumberland County]] and [[Northampton County, Pennsylvania|Northampton County]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5m1TAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA513&amp;dq=Joshua+Francis+Fisher+on+Robert+Morris&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiSnqOl99XbAhVDulMKHbUUCRQQ6AEIVTAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Morris%20folly&amp;f=false The Historic Mansions and Buildings of Philadelphia: With Some Notice of ... p. 364]&lt;/ref&gt; [This was not the first partnership Morris and Nicholson were involved in; in 1792, Nicholson had negotiated the purchase from the federal government of the {{convert|202000|acre|km2|adj=on}} tract known as the [[Erie Triangle]].

After that, he took the options to purchase over {{Convert|6000000|acre|km2}} in the rural south. Unfortunately for Morris, that syndicate reneged on their commitment, leaving him once again liable, but this time with more exposure.&lt;ref name="Barbara Ann Chernow 1978"&gt;Barbara Ann Chernow, ''Robert Morris, Land Speculator, 1790–1801'' (1978)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1795, Morris and two of his partners, Greenleaf and Nicholson, pooled their land and formed a land company called the '''North American Land Company'''.

To encourage investors to purchase shares, the three partners guaranteed that a 6 percent dividend would be paid every year. To ensure that there was enough money to pay this divided, each partner agreed to put 3,000 of their own NALC shares in [[escrow]].&lt;ref name="Roberts407"&gt;"Roberts407"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Any inability to pay the dividend would result in the sale of these shares to make up the difference.

===Panic of 1797 and bankruptcy===
When England and the Dutch declared war on Revolutionary France, an expected loan from Holland never materialized. The subsequent [[Napoleonic Wars]] ruined the market for American land and Morris's highly leveraged company collapsed. Lastly, the financial markets of England, the United States, and the Caribbean suffered from deflation related with the [[Panic of 1796–97|Panic of 1797]]. Morris was left "land rich and cash poor". He ''owned'' more land than any other American at any time, but didn't have enough [[Hard money (policy)|liquid capital]] to pay his creditors.&lt;ref&gt;"Barbara Ann Chernow 1978"&lt;/ref&gt; Among his creditors was his son-in-law James Marshall for £20,000 sterling; likewise his brother-in-law Bishop White was also a creditor to Morris for $3,000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dLOwGSsyVosC&amp;pg=PA116&amp;dq=Arthur+lee+charges+against+robert+morris&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiWueqB3cbbAhVG3FMKHci8BGgQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=gold%20watch&amp;f=false Robert Morris. p. 165]&lt;/ref&gt;

The NALC encountered financial difficulty almost immediately. Only {{convert|4479317|acre|km2}} of land was turned over to the NALC, which meant it could issue only 22,365 shares. This meant only 7,455 shares were put into escrow (instead of the required 9,000). Rather than paying creditors with cash, the NALC paid them with shares (8,477 shares in 1795 and 1796).&lt;ref&gt;Livermore, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; On May 15, 1795, the D.C. commissioners demanded their first payment from Greenleaf, Morris, and Nicholson, for the 6,000 lots purchased in 1793. But Greenleaf had misappropriated some of the company's income to pay his own debts. Without the Dutch mortgage income and missing funds, there was no money to make the payment to the commissioners. Furthermore, Greenleaf had co-signed for loans taken out by Morris and Nicholson. When these men defaulted, creditors sought out Greenleaf to make good on the debts—which he could not.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; Moris and his partners had failed to both pay the instalments on the Washington D.C. building lots and finished building twenty houses (they had contracted ten houses annually for seven years on said lots);&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OSjrX6pqo5sC&amp;pg=PA303&amp;dq=Robert+Morris+building+lots+in+washington+DC&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjUo6XyoZPcAhVq4IMKHbnbB_cQ6AEIMzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Robert%20Morris%20building%20lots%20in%20washington%20DC&amp;f=false Journal of the ...

The worsening financial problems of Greenleaf, Morris, and Nicholson led to increasingly poor personal relations among the three men.&lt;ref name="Sakolski165"&gt;"Sakolski165"&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholson, particularly bitter, began making public accusations against Greenleaf in print.&lt;ref name="Sakolski165"/&gt; Morris attempted to mediate between the two men, but his efforts failed.&lt;ref name="Livermore165"/&gt; In an attempt to resolve his financial problems, Greenleaf sold his shares in the NALC to Nicholson and Morris on May 28, 1796, for $1.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;"Livermore168"&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, Morris and Nicholson funded their purchase by giving Greenleaf [[Security (finance)|personal notes]].&lt;ref name="Roberts407"/&gt; Furthermore, they endorsed one another's notes.&lt;ref name="Sakolski165"/&gt; Morris and Nicholson, themselves nearly bankrupt, agreed to pay one-quarter of the purchase price every year for the next for years. Greenleaf's shares were not to be transferred to Morris and Nicholson until the fourth payment was received.&lt;ref&gt;Livermore168"&lt;/ref&gt; On September 30, 1796, James Greenleaf put 7,455 of his NALC shares in a trust (known as the "391 trust" because it was recorded on page 391 of the firm's accounting book). The "391 trust" was created to generate income (from the 6 percent dividend) to pay a loan given to Greenleaf by Edward Fox. A trustee was assigned to hold on to the shares. The same day, Greenleaf put 2,545 shares into another trust (the "381 trust"), as a guarantee against nonpayment of the dividend by Morris and Nicholson.&lt;ref name="Livermore166"&gt;Livermore, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; Morris and Nicholson's made the first payment to Greenleaf for the one-third interest in the NALC by turning over title to several hundred lots in Washington, D.C. On March 8, 1797, Greenleaf executed the 381 trust.&lt;ref&gt;Greenleaf executed another trust on October 11, 1796, transferring real estate and notes owed to him to this trust as security for payment of yet another debt. On March 23, 1797, the trustee of the third trust executed assigned certain real estate and notes under the October 11 trust to Henry Pratt and others.&lt;/ref&gt; When the NALC did not issue its 6 percent dividend, Greenleaf transferred one-third of the shares in the "391 trust" to the trustees.&lt;ref&gt;Originally, there was just a single trustee for the "391 trust", George Simpson. Simpson later brought in other trustees, including Henry Pratt. The Pratt trustees purchased $4,725 in notes issued by Morris and Nicholson in order to shore up their trust—and, perhaps, to help keep Morris and Nicholson out of bankruptcy.&lt;/ref&gt; The total number of shares transferred to the "381 trust" trustees was now 6,119.&lt;ref name="Livermore, p. 169"&gt;Livermore, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; On June 24, 1797 Morris, Greenleaf and Nicholson  had conveyed their Washington D.C.

The Washington DC Lots were not the only land problums for Morris; he began losing everything for nonpayment on interest on loans and taxes: In May 1796, [[John Barker Church]] accepted a mortgage on another 100,000 acres of the Morris Reserve in present-day [[Allegany County, New York|Allegany County]] and [[Genesee County, New York|Genesee County]], against a debt owed to him by Morris.&lt;ref name=NYT-PhilipChurch&gt;{{cite news |title=Philip Church's Career – One of the Most Prominent of Allegany's Early Settlers |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 23, 1895 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/15751680/the_new_york_times/ |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171213165411/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/15751680/the_new_york_times/ |archivedate=December 13, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After Morris failed to pay the mortgage, Church foreclosed, and Church's son [[Philip Schuyler Church]] acquired the land in May 1800.&lt;ref name=NYT-PhilipChurch/&gt; Philip began the settlement of Allegany and Genesee counties by founding the village of [[Angelica, New York]].&lt;ref name=Minard&gt;{{cite book |last1=Minard |first1=John S. |title=Allegany County and Its People |date=1896 |publisher=W.A.

Poor business practices were now dragging down NALC. For years, Morris and Nicholson had acted as personal guarantors for one another's notes. Now many of these notes were coming due, and neither man could pay them. Creditors began selling the notes publicly, often at heavy discounts.&lt;ref name="Mann201"&gt;"Mann201"&lt;/ref&gt; By 1798, Morris and Nicholson's $10 million in personal notes were trading at one-eighth their face value.&lt;ref&gt;"Mann202"&lt;/ref&gt; NALC also discovered that some of titles to the {{convert|6000000|acre|km2}} of land it owned were not clear, and thus the land could not be used for security. In other cases, NALC found it had been swindled, and the rich land it thought it owned turned out to be barren and worthless.&lt;ref name="Mann201"/&gt; Morris and Nicholson honestly believed that, if their cash flow problems were fixed, they could make payments on the property they owned and their shares would be returned to them. This proved incorrect. On October 23, 1807, all stock in the company was sold at 7 cents on the dollar to the accountants managing the Aggregate Fund. In 1856, the Trustees of the North American Land Company held $92,071.87. Morris and Nicholson's heirs sued to recover the stock and gain access to the income. The North American Land Company stayed in existence until 1872.&lt;ref name="Livermore, p. 169"/&gt; An 1880 auditors report called the litigation "phenomenal ... the counsel for Morris and Nickerson pursued the fund for twenty-five years, seeking to obtain it from the trustees of the North American Company and the trusts which had been created from it, and also defending the money from the State in a attempt to sequestrate it. After all counsel fees  and expenses, the amount available for division to the Morris interest was $9,692.49." &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dLOwGSsyVosC&amp;pg=PA116&amp;dq=Arthur+lee+charges+against+robert+morris&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiWueqB3cbbAhVG3FMKHci8BGgQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=gold%20watch&amp;f=false Robert Morris. p. 169]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Both Norris and Nicholson's estates received this exact same amount in 1880 ["Clark7475"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Morris attempted to avoid creditors by staying outside the city at his country estate "The Hills", located on the [[Schuylkill River]], but his creditors literally pursued him to his gate. Morris was sued by a former partner, [[James Greenleaf]], who had been imprisoned for fraud and was serving time in [[debtors' prison]]. Unable to dodge his creditors and their lawyers, Morris was finally arrested. He was imprisoned for debt in Prune Street prison in Philadelphia from February 1798 to August 1801.&lt;ref&gt;Axelrod, Alan. ''The Real History of the American Revolution'', 2007. p. 349, sidebar&lt;/ref&gt; 43 of the 100 acres of his estate "The Hills" was purchased in March 1799 by [[Henry C. Pratt (merchant)|Henry Pratt]] for $14,654.00 for his country house [[Lemon Hill]] after the tearing down of Morris's old mansion;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5m1TAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA513&amp;dq=Joshua+Francis+Fisher+on+Robert+Morris&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiSnqOl99XbAhVDulMKHbUUCRQQ6AEIVTAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Henry%20Pratt&amp;f=false The Historic Mansions and Buildings of Philadelphia: With Some Notice of ... pp. 376–377]&lt;/ref&gt; in turn the "Lemon Hill" estate became part of the foundation for [[Fairmount Park]] Philadelphia; one part of Morris property which had also been purchased in 1799 by William Cannard became part of the [[Sedgeley]] mansion-which in turn ironically became part of Fairmont Park. In January 1799 Morris lamented to Nicholson of how a London firm had refused to accept his bill of lading £389 sterling "..because the money in the hands of the party upon whom the bill was drawn had been attached by the owner of a bond given for payment of some lands in Georgia..".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5m1TAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA513&amp;dq=Joshua+Francis+Fisher+on+Robert+Morris&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiSnqOl99XbAhVDulMKHbUUCRQQ6AEIVTAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Morris%20folly&amp;f=false The Historic Mansions and Buildings of Philadelphia: With Some Notice of ... p. 372]&lt;/ref&gt; Of his partners Geenleaf was released after being declared bankrupt in 1798;&lt;ref&gt;[Besides speculation he was occupied in defending himself in 13 lawsuits from 1797 until his death in 1843]&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholson died in prison in 1800.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oVBAAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA108&amp;dq=Robert+Morris+building+lots+in+washington+DC&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiV3rmeqZPcAhVh64MKHQUjBhgQ6AEIOTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Robert%20Morris%20building%20lots%20in%20washington%20DC&amp;f=false A History of the United States: Federalists and Republicans, 1789-1815 .p.112]&lt;/ref&gt;

Morris's economic failure reduced the fortunes of many other prominent Federalists who had invested in his ventures (e.g., [[Henry Lee III|Henry Lee]]). Morris's political adversaries used his bankruptcy to gain political power in Pennsylvania. A Democratic-Republican Governor [[Thomas McKean]] was elected and refined the art of political patronage in America. McKean's party picked the Pennsylvania members of the [[electoral college]] for the election of 1800, which contributed to votes for [[Thomas Jefferson]] as president.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/82871/12-facts-about-election-1800|title=12 Facts About the Election of 1800|date=2016-07-28|access-date=2017-03-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

The US Congress passed its first bankruptcy legislation, the temporary [[Bankruptcy Act of 1800]], in part to get Morris out of prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=556-YcjJYhkC&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;vq=29&amp;pg=PA29|title=A Dictionary of American History|publisher=Wiley|page=29|isbn=978-1-57718-099-9|author=Thomas L. Purvis|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his release, three commissioners found that he had debts of $2,948,711.11; the proceedings were certified October 15, 1801 after 2/3 of his creditors agreed to the discharge of Morris; on December 4, 1801 a certificate of bankruptcy was confirmed. In January 1830, Morris's son Henry petitioned the district Court of Philadelphia that the commission should be vacated and superseded as nothing had been done by either the assignees or the creditors; the petition was granted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5m1TAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA513&amp;dq=Joshua+Francis+Fisher+on+Robert+Morris&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiSnqOl99XbAhVDulMKHbUUCRQQ6AEIVTAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Morris%20folly&amp;f=false The Historic Mansions and Buildings of Philadelphia: With Some Notice of ... pp. 374–75]&lt;/ref&gt;

After his release, Morris continued to suffer poor health and spent the rest of his life in retirement. He was assisted by his wife who had supported him throughout his misfortune. Their only source of income was a $1,500.00 annuity for Mrs. Morris which had been set up for her from the Holland Land Company by Gouverneur Morris.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dLOwGSsyVosC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=Robert+Morris+financier&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjUsZiTso3cAhXh24MKHUJ6CqsQ6AEIQzAF#v=onepage&amp;q=watch&amp;f=false Morris. p. 167]&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically one of the few assets Morris had left to him was his father's old worn out watch which he had inherited at the start of his career; Morris managed to leave this timepiece to his son Robert Jr.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dLOwGSsyVosC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=Robert+Morris+financier&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjo7tmNto3cAhWB8oMKHVy5D_cQ6AEIQzAF#v=onepage&amp;q=gold%20watch&amp;f=false Robert Morris. p. 165]&lt;/ref&gt; Morris died on May 8, 1806 in Philadelphia. He is buried in the family vault of Bishop William White, his brother-in-law, at [[Christ Church, Philadelphia|Christ Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{FAG|739}}&lt;/ref&gt; A plaque installed later reads: "ROBERT MORRIS signer of the Constitution of the United States of America.

It referred to the two columns draped with scrolls on the [[Spanish dollar|Spanish milled dollar]], which predated the US Dollar. Morris was the first to use that symbol in official documents and in official communications with [[Oliver Pollock]]. The US dollar was based on the Spanish milled dollar when, in the [[Coinage Act of 1792]], the first Mint Act, its value was "fixed" (per the [[U.S. Constitution]], Article I, Section 8, clause 1 power of the [[United States Congress]] "To coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin, and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures") as being "of the value of a Spanish milled dollar as the same is now current, and to contain three hundred and seventy-one grains and four sixteenth parts of a grain of pure, or four hundred and sixteen grains of standard silver".

'''Robin Francis Cavendish''', [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] (12 March 1930 – 8 August 1994), was a British advocate for disabled people, medical aid developer, and one of the longest-lived ''responauts''{{efn|A person permanently dependent upon a [[mechanical ventilator]] to maintain breathing.&lt;ref name=TheIndependent/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/responaut "responaut"]. [[Oxford English Dictionary]]. [[Oxford University Press]]. Retrieved 17 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;}} in Britain. Born in [[Middleton-by-Youlgreave|Middleton, Derbyshire]], Cavendish was affected by [[polio]] at the age of 28. Despite being initially given only three months to live, Cavendish, paralysed from the neck down and able to breathe only with the use of a [[mechanical ventilator]], became a tireless advocate for disabled people, instrumental in organising the first records of the number of responauts in Britain and helping to develop numerous devices to provide independence to paralysed people.

==Early life and career==
Robin Francis Cavendish was born 12 March 1930 in Middleton, Derbyshire, England. He attended [[Winchester College]]. He attended [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]] and was commissioned into the 60th Rifles, of the [[King’s Royal Rifle Corps]], spending seven years in the Army, eventually attaining the rank of Captain. He left the Army to join Thompson Smithett in starting up a tea-broking business in Africa. In 1957, he married Diana Blacker and returned to Kenya. They had one son,&lt;ref name=DailyMail&gt;Bamigboye, Baz (16 March 2017). [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-4322262/Claire-Foy-Andrew-Garfield-star-new-film-Breathe.html "Claire and Andrew bring to life a remarkable love story: Actress tells BAZ BAMIGBOYE about her role in new film Breathe"].

''[[London Evening Standard]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polio diagnosis and subsequent career==
In December 1958, while in Kenya, Cavendish became ill with [[polio]]. Because he was paralyzed from the neck down, a Nairobi doctor put him on a [[mechanical respirator]] that Cavendish needed to breathe, making him a "responaut". Cavendish flew back to England.&lt;ref name=TheIndependent/&gt;&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;Oaksey, John (17 August 2001). [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1337670/Professor-E-T-Teddy-Hall.html "Obituaries: Professor E T 'Teddy' Hall"]. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; He was initially given only three months, and then one year, to live.&lt;ref name=TheIndependent/&gt; According to Jonathan Cavendish, his father's first thought after being struck down by polio was to "turn off the machine", reasoning that Diana was only 25, and telling her, "You can start again." But, as Jonathan states, "she wasn't having any of it."&lt;ref name=DailyMail/&gt; Against the advice of his doctors, he left the hospital after a year.&lt;ref name=TheIndependent/&gt;

For the remainder of his life, Cavendish and his wife worked not only to improve the quality of his life, but the lives of other paralysed people, travelling the world to inspire others as campaigners for disabled people. Cavendish would often serve as the expert who explained his condition to consultants and nurses. In the 1960s he tracked down and listed the circumstances of all the responauts in Britain, compiling the first record of how many people were confined to [[iron lungs]].&lt;ref name=TheIndependent/&gt;

In 1962, Cavendish and his friend [[Edward Thomas Hall|Teddy Hall]], the [[Oxford University]] professor, developed a wheelchair with a built-in respirator that freed Cavendish from confinement to his bed, which became the model for future devices of its type,&lt;ref name=TheIndependent/&gt; with Cavendish eventually using a total of 10 different chairs.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt; Determined that mobility should be available to other polio survivors, Cavendish raised money from the Ernest Kleinwort Charitable Trust for the first dozen chairs, and eventually persuaded the then [[British Department of Health]] to fund a series of chairs, which were manufactured by Teddy Hall's company, Littlemore Scientific Engineering. After testing them on himself, Cavendish helped to market pieces of equipment that improve the quality of life of disabled people. Most notable among these was the Possum, which Cavendish developed with scientists at [[Stoke Mandeville Hospital]], and which allowed users to use the telephone, turn on a television or adjust a home's central heating with only a left-or-right movement of their head.&lt;ref name=TheIndependent/&gt; Others included a lightweight ventilator that ran on batteries, and a modified aircraft seat fitted with electronic aids. Littlemore received government funding to make another forty chair-and-ventilator sets.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;

Moved by the plight of families who could never go on holiday together, Cavendish and others, in particular polio specialist Dr. G.T. Spencer, the consultant in charge of the Lane-Fox Unit at [[St Thomas's Hospital]] in London, co-founded the charity Refresh in 1970 to raise the money toward the construction of Netley Waterside House, a holiday complex overlooking [[Southampton Water]] on the South Coast whose facilities provided for the care of severely disabled responauts as they and their families enjoyed the attractive surroundings. The facility opened in 1977.&lt;ref name=TheIndependent/&gt;&lt;ref name=DailyMail/&gt;

Cavendish was made an [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] in 1974.&lt;ref name=TheIndependent/&gt;

==Personal life==
Cavendish was an [[atheist]].&lt;ref name=TheIndependent/&gt; Among his pastimes was reading newspapers. Cavendish and Diana refused to accept Cavendish's condition as a major restriction, travelling widely until a short time before his death. They often drove from Oxford to London in their specially adapted van, returning home late at night. They also travelled abroad to visit places such as the battlefields of northern France, and they enjoyed receiving visiting friends in their home. According to Alice and Tim Renton of ''[[The Independent]]'', "Young people found him an irresistible ear to pour confidences into and his stimulating and down-to-earth attitude to problems helped many. His contemporaries would drive across country to ask his advice and enjoy his company. It was as if his sedentary life gave him a broader viewpoint and a sharper vision than the rest of us, and his capacity for laughing at, as well as with, his friends was healthily deflating."&lt;ref name=TheIndependent/&gt;

Cavendish was described by the Rentons as "naturally unsentimental" whose love for Diana, Jonathan and daughter-in-law, Leslie Ann Rogers was both "well-concealed and totally evident". According to the Rentons, Cavendish "questioned mercilessly and passed on gossip as happily as he received it, but somehow the malice disappeared as it went through him. He had a natural graciousness: his lack of evident resentment at his own condition made helping him a positive pleasure."&lt;ref name=TheIndependent/&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Cavendish died on 8 August 1994 at [[Drayton St Leonard]], [[Oxfordshire]], England at the age of 64, becoming a medical phenomenon as one of the longest-living polio survivors in Great Britain. In their obituary of him, the Rentons stated, "To know Robin Cavendish was to know the personification of courage. Many people achieve moments of great courage, few are called on to show it continuously for 36 years."&lt;ref name=TheIndependent/&gt;

On 27 November 1995, the Robin Cavendish Memorial Fund was created, with Diana, Jonathan and Leslie Cavendish among its trustees. Its purpose was to provide grants to individuals and organisations for the purpose of advancing the health and saving the lives of people with disabilities. In 2014, it was merged with the charity that Robin and Diana Cavendish had previously founded, Refresh, into the Cavendish Spencer Trust, which provides holiday and respite breaks for people with severe disability due to neurological or neuromuscular disorders. The Trust is named for Cavendish and his close friend Geoffrey Spencer, who aided Cavendish in his advocacy for disabled people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://opencharities.org/charities/1051055 "The Robin Cavendish Memorial Fund"]. Open Charities. Retrieved 17 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cavendishspencertrust.com/about-funding-break/ "About Us"]. The Cavendish Spencer Trust. Retrieved 17 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017 Cavendish and Diana were awarded the [[Patient Innovation]] Lifetime Achievement Award for their work in developing innovations and advocating for people with disabilities. The award was announced by Nobel Laureate Sir [[Richard J. Roberts]], a member of the Advisory Board of [[Patient Innovation]] and of the Jury of the Awards, addressed the audience in the Awards Ceremony at the [[Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation]] in Lisbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mailchi.mp/patient-innovation/patient-innovation-christmas-edition-1531641|title=Newsletter #12: 3rd Patient Innovation Awards at the conference 'Opening up to an era of Social Innovation'|publisher=Patient Innovation|accessdate=August 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Jackley was born in [[Exeter, Devon]].

In 2008, Jackley was arrested in the United States, after getting caught in [[Vermont]] using a fake ID to buy a firearm. A year later, he was returned to the United Kingdom where he was convicted of a series of armed robbery related offences on banks, building societies and bookmakers. Jackley's offences stood out due to his use of "calling cards" and statements that he believed himself a "modern day Robin Hood", who allegedly gave some of his loot to charities and homeless people.&lt;ref name="Birmingham Mail"&gt;{{cite news

He went on to appeal his sentence, which the Court of Appeal reduced from 13 to 12 years on the basis of his condition, Asperger's Syndrome, making prison life harder than for other offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Approved Judgment - R v Jackley [2013] EWCA Crim 774|url=http://crimeline.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Jackley.pdf|website=Crimeline.co.uk|publisher=Crimeline.co.uk|accessdate=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst in custody he took up a string of court cases, involving prisoners access to IT equipment for legal representation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=London Criminal Courts Solicitors' Association|url=https://www.lccsa.org.uk/r-on-the-application-of-jackley-v-secretary-of-state-for-justice-2014/|website=lssa.org.uk|accessdate=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 'home detention curfew' policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rashid|first1=Tariq|url=http://www.worcesternews.co.uk/news/11754988._Robin_Hood__bank_robber_bids_to_sue_Justice_Secretary/|accessdate=30 April 2018|publisher=Worcester News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackley was released in May 2015. It has been reported that he is a trustee and national coordinator of the UK prison-reform organisation, Justice in Prisons.&lt;ref name="Justice in Prisons"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.justiceinprisons.org.uk/aboutus/trustees.html
|title=Trustees

He also started a consultancy social enterprise called StarUp CIC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starup.org.uk/|website=StarUp CIC|publisher=StarUp CIC|accessdate=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2016, of which he is named as a director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/10431695|website=Companies House|publisher=UK Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Jackley has published books including ''Just Sky'' (an autobiography) and ''Good Intentions'' (a crime thriller), and anthologies of short stories/essays. In early 2015, he helped found the publishing enterprise, Arkbound Ltd,&lt;ref name="Arkbound Ltd"&gt;{{cite web

'''The Five''', also known as the '''Mighty Handful''' and the '''New Russian School''', were five prominent 19th-century Russian [[composers]] who worked together to create distinct [[Russian classical music]]. [[Mily Balakirev]] (the leader), [[César Cui]], [[Modest Mussorgsky]], [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] and [[Alexander Borodin]] all lived in [[Saint Petersburg]], and collaborated from 1856 to 1870.

==History==

===Name===
[[Image:Vladimir Stasov.jpg|thumb|[[Vladimir Stasov]] &lt;br&gt; (1824&amp;ndash;1906)]]
In May 1867 the critic [[Vladimir Stasov]] wrote an article, titled ''Mr. Balakirev's Slavic Concert'', covering a concert that had been performed for visiting Slav delegations at the "All-Russian Ethnographical Exhibition" in Moscow. The four Russian composers whose works were played at the concert were [[Mikhail Glinka]], [[Alexander Dargomyzhsky]], [[Mily Balakirev]], and [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]].&lt;ref&gt;Abraham, Gerald, ''Essays on Russian and East European Music: Vladimir Stasov, Man and Critic'', Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1985, pg. 112&lt;/ref&gt; The article ended with the following statement:

{{quote|God grant that our Slav guests may never forget today's concert; God grant that they may forever preserve the memory of how much poetry, feeling, talent, and intelligence are possessed by the small but already mighty handful of Russian musicians.&lt;ref name="Calvocoressi, M.D. 1946, pg. 178"&gt;Calvocoressi, M.D., Abraham, G., ''Master Musicians Series: Mussorgsky'', London: J.M.Dent &amp; Sons, Ltd., 1946, pg. 178&lt;/ref&gt;|Vladimir Stasov|''[[Sankt-Peterburgskie Vedomosti]], 1867''}}

The expression "mighty handful" ({{lang-ru|Могучая кучка}}, ''Moguchaya kuchka'', "Mighty Bunch") was mocked by enemies of Balakirev and Stasov: [[Alexander Serov|Aleksandr Serov]], academic circles of the conservatory, the Russian Musical Society, and their press supporters. The group ignored critics and continued operating under the moniker.&lt;ref name="Calvocoressi, M.D. 1946, pg. 178"/&gt; This loose collection of composers gathered around Balakirev now included Cui, Mussorgsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, and Borodin &amp;mdash; the five who have come to be associated with the name "Mighty Handful", or sometimes "The Five". [[Gerald Abraham]] stated flatly in the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' that "they never called themselves, nor were they ever called in Russia, 'The Five'"&lt;ref&gt;Abraham, Gerald, ''The New Grove: Russian Masters 1: Balakirev'', New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 1986, pg. 86&lt;/ref&gt; (although today the Russian equivalent "Пятёрка" ("Pyatyorka") is occasionally used to refer to this group).&lt;ref&gt;''Krugosvet'', "[http://www.krugosvet.ru/enc/kultura_i_obrazovanie/muzyka/BALAKIREV_MILI_ALEKSEEVICH.html Balakirev Mily Alekseevich]".&lt;/ref&gt; In his memoirs, Rimsky-Korsakov routinely refers to the group as "Balakirev's circle", and occasionally uses "The Mighty Handful", usually with an ironic tone. He also makes the following reference to "The Five":

{{quote|If we leave out of account [[Nikolai Lodyzhensky|Lodyzhensky]], who accomplished nothing, and [[Anatoly Lyadov|Lyadov]], who appeared later, Balakirev's circle consisted of Balakirev, Cui, Mussorgsky, Borodin, and me (the French have retained the denomination of "''Les Cinq''" for us to this day).&lt;ref&gt;Rimsky-Korsakov, N., ''Chronicle of My Musical Life'', New York: Knopf, 1923, pg. 286&lt;/ref&gt;|Nikolay Rimsky-Korsakov|''Chronicle of My Musical Life'', 1909}}

The Russian word ''kuchka'' also spawned the terms "kuchkism" and "kuchkist", which may be applied to artistic aims or works in tune with the sensibilities of the Mighty Handful.

The name of [[Les Six]], an even looser collection of French-speaking composers, emulates that of "The Five".

===Formation===
The formation of the group began in 1856, with the first meeting of Balakirev and [[César Cui]]. [[Modest Mussorgsky]] joined them in 1857, [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] in 1861, and [[Alexander Borodin]] in 1862. All the composers in The Five were young men in 1862. Balakirev was 25, Cui 27, Mussorgsky 23, Borodin the eldest at 28, and Rimsky-Korsakov just 18. They were all self-trained amateurs. Borodin combined composing with a career in [[chemistry]]. Rimsky-Korsakov was a [[Imperial Russian Navy|naval officer]] (he wrote his First Symphony on a three-year naval voyage circumnavigating the globe). Mussorgsky had been in the prestigious [[Preobrazhensky Regiment]] of the Imperial Guard, and then in the civil service before taking up music; even at the height of his career in the 1870s he was forced by the expense of his drinking habit to hold down a full-time job in the State Forestry Department.&lt;ref&gt;Figes, Orlando, ''Natasha's Dance: A Cultural History of Russia'' (New York: Metropolitan Books, 2002), 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the élite status and court connections of Conservatory composers such as [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], The Five were mainly from the minor gentry of the provinces. To some degree their ''[[esprit de corps]]'' depended on the myth, which they themselves created, of a movement that was more "authentically Russian," in the sense that it was closer to the native soil, than the classic academy.&lt;ref&gt;Figes, 179. Also see R. Tarushkin, ''Defining Russia Musically'', xiii ff, per Figes.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before them, [[Mikhail Glinka]] and [[Alexander Dargomyzhsky]] had gone some way towards producing a distinctly Russian kind of music, writing operas on Russian subjects, but the Mighty Handful represented the first concentrated attempt to develop such a music, with Stasov as their artistic adviser and Dargomyzhsky as an elder statesman to the group, so to speak. The circle began to fall apart during the 1870s, no doubt partially due to the fact that Balakirev withdrew from musical life early in the decade for a period of time. All of "The Five" are buried in [[Tikhvin Cemetery]] in [[Saint Petersburg]].

==Musical language==

===Stylization===
{{refimprove section|date=January 2016}}
The musical language The Five developed set them far apart from the Conservatoire. This self-conscious Russian styling was based on two elements:

*They tried to incorporate in their music what they heard in village songs, in [[Cossack]] and [[Peoples of the Caucasus|Caucasian]] dances, in church chants and the tolling of church bells (to the point where the bell tolling became a cliché). The Five's music became filled with imitative sounds of Russian life. They also tried to reproduce the long-drawn, lyrical and [[melisma]]tic peasant song, what Glinka had once called "the soul of Russian music."  Balakirev made this possible by his study of songs from the Volga in the 1860s. More than any previous anthology, his transcriptions artfully preserved the distinctive aspects of Russian folk music:
**Tonal mutability
*:A tune seems to shift naturally from one [[tonal center]] to another, often ending up in a different key than the one in which the song began. This can produce a feeling of elusiveness, a lack of definition or of logical progression in the harmony. Even when stylized by The Five, this quality can make Russian music sound very different from the tonal structures of the West.
**[[Heterophony]]
*:A melody is simultaneously rendered by two or more performers in different variations. This is improvised by the singers until the end, when the song reverts to a single melodic line.
**[[consecutive fifth|Parallel fifth]]s, fourths and thirds
*:The effect lends Russian music a raw sonority missing entirely from the comparatively polished harmonies of Western music.
*The Five also adopted a series of harmonic devices to create a distinct "Russian" style and color different from Western music. This "exotic" styling of "Russia" was not just self-conscious but entirely invented. None of these devices was actually used in Russian folk or church music:
**[[Whole tone scale]]
*:Although Glinka did not invent this scale, his application of it in the opera ''[[Ruslan and Lyudmila (opera)|Ruslan and Lyudmila]]'' (1842) &amp;mdash; most recognizable at the end of the festive overture &amp;mdash; provided a characteristic harmonic and melodic device. This scale in "Russian" works often suggests evil or ominous personages or situations. It was used by all the major composers from Tchaikovsky (the appearance of the Countess's ghost in ''[[The Queen of Spades (opera)|The Queen of Spades]]'') to Rimsky-Korsakov (in all his magic-story operas—''[[Sadko (opera)|Sadko]]'', ''[[Kashchey the Deathless]]'' and ''[[The Legend of the Invisible City of Kitezh and the Maiden Fevroniya|The Invisible City of Kitezh]]''). [[Claude Debussy]] also uses this scale in his music, taking this, among many things, from the Russians. Later it became a standard device in horror-movie scores.
**The [[Russian submediant]]&lt;ref&gt;DeVoto, Mark. "The Russian Submediant in the Nineteenth Century," Current Musicology, no. 59 (October 1995), pp. 48&amp;ndash;76.&lt;/ref&gt;
*:Also linked to Glinka's  ''Ruslan'', this is a harmonic pattern (in  major mode) in which one upper part proceeds from the dominant pitch chromatically to the submediant while the other harmony parts remain constant. The most basic form of this pattern can be shown as follows (beginning with typical tonic):  root-position tonic triad → root-position augmented tonic triad → 1st inversion submediant minor triad. A famous example of the Russian submediant occurs in the very opening bars of the third movement of Rimsky-Korsakov's ''[[Scheherazade (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Scheherezade]]''.
**[[Octatonic scale|Diminished or octatonic scale]]
*:Rimsky-Korsakov first used this in his symphonic poem ''Sadko'' in 1867. This scale became a sort of Russian calling-card &amp;mdash; a ''[[leitmotif]]'' of magic and menace used not just by Rimsky-Korsakov but all of his followers, above all [[Alexander Scriabin]], [[Maurice Ravel]], [[Igor Stravinsky]] and [[Olivier Messiaen]] (mode 2).
**Modular rotation in sequences of thirds
*:The Five made this device of [[Franz Liszt]] their own to base a loose [[symphonic poem|symphonic-poem]] type of structure. This way, they could avoid the rigid Western laws of modulation in [[sonata form]], allowing the form of a musical composition to be shaped entirely by the "content" of the music (its programmatic statements and visual descriptions) rather than by formal laws of symmetry. This loose structure became especially important for Mussorgsky's ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]'', a work that may have done more than any other to define the Russian style.&lt;ref&gt;Figes, 180&amp;ndash;181.&lt;/ref&gt;
**[[Pentatonic scale]]
*:This stylistic aspect became used by every Russian nationalist composer.&lt;ref name="figes391"&gt;Figes, 391.&lt;/ref&gt; Its distinctive feature is to have only five notes in the octave, rather than the seven of the [[heptatonic scale]]s (e.g., [[Major scale|major]] and [[Minor scale|minor]]). The pentatonic scale is one of the ways of suggesting a "primitive" folk-melodic style as well as the "Eastern" element (Middle East, Asia). A melodic example of the "major-mode" pentatonic scale (C-D-E-G-A) can be heard at the entrance of the chorus at the beginning of Borodin's ''[[Prince Igor]]''.

===Orientalism===
One hallmark of "The Five" was its reliance on [[orientalism]].&lt;ref name="figes391"&gt;Figes, 391.&lt;/ref&gt; Many quintessentially "Russian" works were composed in orientalist style, such as Balakirev's ''[[Islamey]]'', Borodin's ''[[Prince Igor]]'' and Rimsky-Korsakov's ''[[Scheherazade (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Scheherazade]]''.&lt;ref name="figes391"&gt;Figes, 391.&lt;/ref&gt; Orientalism, in fact, became widely considered in the West both one of the best-known aspects of Russian music and a trait of Russian national character.&lt;ref name="maes80"&gt;Maes, 80.&lt;/ref&gt; As leader of "The Five," Balakirev encouraged the use of eastern themes and harmonies to set their "Russian" music apart from the German symphonism of [[Anton Rubinstein]] and other Western-oriented composers.&lt;ref name="figes391"&gt;Figes, 391.&lt;/ref&gt; Because Rimsky-Korsakov used Russian folk and oriental melodies in his [[Symphony No. 1 (Rimsky-Korsakov)|First Symphony]], Stasov and the other nationalists dubbed it the "First Russian Symphony," even though Rubinstein had written his ''Ocean'' Symphony a dozen years before it.&lt;ref name="figes391"&gt;Figes, 391.&lt;/ref&gt; These were themes Balakirev had transcribed in the Caucasus.&lt;ref name="figes391"&gt;Figes, 391.&lt;/ref&gt; "The symphony is good," Cui wrote to Rimsky-Korsakov in 1863, while the latter was out on naval deployment. "We played it a few days ago at Balakirev's—to the great pleasure of Stassov. It is really Russian. Only a Russian could have composed it, because it lacks the slightest trace of any stagnant Germanness."&lt;ref&gt;Rimsky-Korsakov, A.N., ''N.A. Rimskii-Korsakov: zhizn' i tvorchestvo'', vyp. 2 (Moscow, 1935), 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Orientalism was not confined to using authentic Eastern melodies.&lt;ref name="maes82"&gt;Maes, Francis, tr. Pomerans, Arnold J. and Erica Pomerans, ''A History of Russian Music: From ''Kamarinskaya ''to'' Babi Yar (Berkeley, Los Angeles and London: University of California Press, 2002), 82.&lt;/ref&gt; What became more important than the melodies themselves were the musical conventions added to them.&lt;ref name="maes82"/&gt; These conventions allowed orientalism to become an avenue for writing music on subjects considered unmentionable otherwise, such as political themes and erotic fantasies.&lt;ref name="maes80"&gt;Maes, 80.&lt;/ref&gt; It also became a means of expressing Russian supremacy as the empire expanded under [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]].&lt;ref name="maes80"&gt;Maes, 80.&lt;/ref&gt; This was often reinforced through [[Misogyny|misogynist]] symbolism—the rational, active and moral Western man versus the irrational, passive and immoral Eastern woman.&lt;ref name="maes80"/&gt;

Two major works entirely dominated by orientalism are Rimsky-Korsakov's symphonic suite ''[[Antar (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Antar]]'' and Balakirev's symphonic poem ''Tamara''.&lt;ref name="maes82"/&gt; ''Antar'', set in Arabia, uses two different styles of music, Western (Russian) and Eastern (Arabian).&lt;ref name="maes82"/&gt; The first theme, Antar's, is masculine and Russian in character.&lt;ref name="maes82"/&gt; The second theme, feminine and oriental in melodic contour, belongs to the queen, Gul Nazar.&lt;ref name="maes82"/&gt; Rimsky-Korsakov was able to soften the implicit misogyny to some extent.&lt;ref name="maes82"/&gt; However, female sensuality does exert a paralyzing, ultimately destructive influence.&lt;ref name="maes82"/&gt; With Gul Nazar extinguishing Antar's life in a final embrace, the woman overcomes the man.&lt;ref name="maes82"/&gt;

Balakirev gives a more overtly misogynistic view of oriental women in ''Tamara''.&lt;ref name="maes82"/&gt; He had originally planned to write a Caucasan dance called a ''lezginka'', modeled on Glinka, for this work.&lt;ref name="maes83"/&gt; However, he discovered a poem by [[Mikhail Lermontov]] about the beautiful Tamara, who lived in a tower alongside the gorge of Daryal.&lt;ref name="maes83"&gt;Maes, 83.&lt;/ref&gt; She lured travelers and allowed them to enjoy a night of sensual delights, only to kill them and throw their bodies into the River Terek.&lt;ref name="maes83"&gt;Maes, 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Balakirev uses two specific codes endemic to orientalism in writing ''Tamara''. The first code, based on obsessive rhythms, note repetitions, climactic effects and accelerated tempi, represents Dionysian intoxication.&lt;ref name="maes82"/&gt; The second code, consisting of unpredictable rhythms, irregular phrasing and based on long passages with many repeat notes, augmented and diminished [[interval (music)|intervals]] and extended [[melisma]]s, depict sensual longing.&lt;ref name="maes82"/&gt; Not only did Balakirev use these codes extensively, but he also attempted to supercharge them further when he revised the orchestration of ''Tamara'' in 1898.&lt;ref name="maes83"&gt;Maes, 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

A direct result of such orientalism was the big influence that this circle left on the formation of classical traditions in other nations of the east and south of Russia. For instance, one of Rimsky-Korsakov's famous students, [[Alexander Spendiaryan]] went on to become the founder of Armenian classical music, carrying on the traditions and aesthetics of the Mighty Handful to the Caucasus.

==Quotations==
[[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]] provides the following picture of "The Mighty Handful" in his memoirs, ''Chronicle of My Musical Life'' (translated by J. A. Joffe):

===Tastes===
{{quote|"The tastes of the circle leaned towards Glinka, Schumann, and Beethoven's last quartets ... they had little respect for Mendelssohn ... Mozart and Haydn were considered out of date and naive ... J. S. Bach was held to be petrified ... Chopin was likened by Balakirev to a nervous society lady ... Berlioz was highly esteemed ...Liszt was comparatively unknown ... Little was said of Wagner ... They respected Dargomyzhsky for the recitative portions of ''Rusalka'' ... [but] he was not credited with any considerable talent and was treated with a shade of derision. ...Rubinstein had a reputation as a pianist, but was thought to have neither talent nor taste as a composer."}}

===Balakirev===
{{quote|"Balakirev, who had never had any systematic course in harmony and counterpoint and had not even superficially applied himself to them, evidently thought such studies quite unnecessary ... An excellent pianist, a superior sight reader of music, a splendid improviser, endowed by nature with the sense of correct harmony and part-writing, he possessed a technique partly native and partly acquired through a vast musical erudition, with the help of an extraordinary memory, keen and retentive, which means so much in steering a critical course in musical literature ... He instantly felt every technical imperfection or error, he grasped a defect in form at once. Whenever I or other young men, later on, played him our essays at composition, he instantly caught all the defects of form, modulation, and so on, and forthwith seating himself at the piano, he would improvise and show how the composition in question should be changed exactly as he indicated, and frequently entire passages in other people's compositions became his and not their putative authors' at all. He was obeyed absolutely, for the spell of his personality was tremendous. ... His influence over those around him was boundless, and resembled some magnetic or mesmeric force. ... he despotically demanded that the tastes of his pupils should exactly coincide with his own. The slightest deviation from his taste was severely censured by him. By means of raillery, a parody or caricature played by him, whatever did not suit him at the moment was belittled — and the pupil blushed with shame for his expressed opinion and recanted...."}}

===Abilities===
{{quote|"Balakirev considered me a symphony specialist ... in the sixties, Balakirev and Cui, though very intimate with Mussorgsky and sincerely fond of him, treated him like a lesser light, and of little promise at that, in spite of his undoubted talent. It seemed to them that there was something missing in him and, in their eyes, he was in need of advice and criticism. Balakirev often said that Mussorgsky had 'no head' or that his 'brains were weak.' ... Balakirev thought that Cui understood little in symphony and musical forms and nothing in orchestration, but was a past master in vocal and operatic music; Cui, in turn, thought Balakirev a master in symphony, form, and orchestration, but with little liking for operatic composition and vocal music in general. Thus they complemented each other, but each, in his own way, felt mature and grown up. Borodin, Mussorgsky, and I, however &amp;mdash; we were immature and juvenile. Obviously, towards Balakirev and Cui we were in somewhat subordinate relations; their opinions were listened to unconditionally...."}}

==Influence==
Except perhaps for Cui, the members of this group influenced or taught many of the great Russian composers who were to follow, including [[Alexander Glazunov]], [[Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov]], [[Sergei Prokofiev]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], and [[Dmitri Shostakovich]]. They also influenced the two French symbolist composers [[Maurice Ravel]] and [[Claude Debussy]] through their radical tonal language.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7423">'''Justice Thomas Walther''' (born 1943) is a lawyer based in [[Kempten]], in the province of [[Bavaria]] in [[Germany]]. He is a former judge and German federal prosecutor for the [[Central Office of the State Justice Administrations for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes]]. He is known as the "last of the [[Nazi hunter]]s" for his work in setting legal precedent in seeking punishment for former [[Schutzstaffel|SS officers]] and guards who were involved in the [[Holocaust]], whether directly responsible for deaths or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Keefe|first1=Stephen|title=A Conversation With 71-Year-Old 'Nazi Hunter' Thomas Walther|url=https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/a-conversation-with-71-year-old-nazi-hunter-thomas-walther-834|website=Vice|accessdate=5 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His father Rudolph saved two Jewish families during the [[Kristallnacht]] anti-Jewish riots of 1938. "My father had quite a lot of Jewish friends in the '30s and he had hidden two families in our big garden during the Night of Broken Glass and they stayed there for some weeks until they had organized their escape to Australia and Paraguay."&lt;ref name=lastof/&gt;

==John Demanjuk case==
After 23 years, he retired as a judge in 2006, joining the Central Office for the Investigation of Nazi Crimes, setting out to change the precedent on prosecuting Nazi guards. After the war, it is estimated that between 7,000 to 8,000 SS guards served at [[Auschwitz]]. Before Walther became a Nazi hunter, only 48 were convicted.&lt;ref name=lastof&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mandel|first1=Michele|title=Last Nazi Trial: The last of the Nazi hunters|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2016/06/16/last-nazi-trial-the-last-of-the-nazi-hunters|publisher=Toronto Sun|date=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2011, after standing trial for two years, German courts decided to convict [[John Demjanjuk]] without any direct evidence of murder –simply by being a guard who watched thousands march to their death made him complicit in the murder of 27,900 Dutch Jews at Sobibor. Demjanjuk, 91, was found guilty in May 2011 of helping to murder more than 28,000 Jews at [[Sobibor]] and sentenced to five years in prison. He was released pending an appeal and was moved to a nursing home.
The two major contributions Walther helped bring into law were that a Nazi did not have to be directly involved to be guilty of aiding and abetting a murder during the Holocaust; and a Holocaust survivor who testifies in a German court does not have to directly identify the defendant.
Walther took this opportunity to help find any remaining German citizens who were former Nazi SS guards. Given that his hunt for Nazis started almost 70 years after the Holocaust ended, many had passed away. He eventually located four former Nazi guards: [[Oskar Gröning]], [[Reinhold Hanning]], Hubert Zafke and Ernst Tremmel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kopf|first1=Shula|title=LAST CHANCE FOR JUSTICE|url=http://www.jpost.com/Jerusalem-Report/Jewish-World/Last-chance-for-justice|publisher=Jerusalem Post|date=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In April, Tremmel died just days before he was to go to trial at the age of 93, and Zafke's trial has been postponed indefinitely – he's been deemed unfit to stand trial due to his ill health. On June 15, 2015, Gröning, known as the "Bookkeeper of Auschwitz," became the 50th Nazi guard to be convicted since the war ended.
The [[New York Times]] wrote, "Thomas Walther, a German lawyer who was the driving force behind the trial of Mr. Demjanjuk, represented Holocaust survivors as co-plaintiffs in the trials of Mr. Hanning and Mr. Gröning. He expressed frustration that Mr. Hanning never responded to his clients' pleas to recount his experience at Auschwitz so that present and future generations would know of it. But in a telephone interview on Thursday, Mr. Walther said that the clients he had contacted on hearing of Mr. Hanning's death insisted that the most important thing was that Mr. Hanning was brought to justice and that his deeds were recounted in court."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smale|first1=Alison|title=Reinhold Hanning, Former Auschwitz Guard Convicted a Year Ago, Dies at 95|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/01/world/europe/reinhold-hanning-dead-convicted-auschwitz-ss-guard.html|publisher=New York Times|date=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
June 17, 2016 Hanning was convicted for the crimes he committed at Auschwitz, and Walther helped bring the 51st Nazi guard to justice following the war. Hanning's trial has been dubbed by many as the "Last of the Nazi trials."

==Gröning trial==
Gröning worked as an accountant at Auschwitz in [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|Nazi-occupied Poland]], sorting and counting the money taken from those killed or used as slave labour, and sending it back to his Nazi superiors in Berlin.
The court in the northern city of [[Lüneburg]] acknowledged that he had only been a "cog in the wheel" at the camp but that it had taken thousands of such people to keep running "a machinery designed entirely for the killing" of human beings.
Presiding judge Franz Kompisch called it "scandalous" that it had taken so long for the German justice system to prosecute such cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Germany indicts 92-year-old former Auschwitz guard|url=http://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/europe/78628-150716-germany-indicts-92-year-old-former-auschwitz-guard|website=iTV News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Rafi Yablonsky of [[Jewish National Fund]] Toronto said: "When we write these final chapters on the Holocaust, Thomas Walther, the last of the Nazi hunters, should not just be included – he should be recognized as a post-Holocaust member of the "Righteous Among the Nations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yablonsky|first1=Rafi|title=LAST OF THE NAZI HUNTERS SHOULD BE RIGHTEOUS AMONG THE NATIONS|url=http://www.cjnews.com/perspectives/opinions/last-of-the-nazi-hunters-should-be-righteous-among-the-nations|accessdate=29 June 2016|publisher=Canadian Jewish News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2017 [[March of the Living]] ceremony, Walther said, "Shalom. I have worked for quite a long time to change the law practice in Germany [regarding] accessory to murder in places just like Auschwitz… I did it for the survivors, I did it for the victims and I did it for the children of the victims. And I did it as well for the future… And the future is with me here, the young generation….They are my hope - they are also my future and your future, and your hope. To life!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Candle Lighting - Justice Thomas Walther|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E8sq0yzbiw&amp;list=PLiDsKsm12xwDUffHBu4BCYSw9rXepN344|website=YouTube|publisher=Jewish Remembrance|accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tom and Mary Bierbaum''' are an [[United States|American]] husband-and-wife writing team, known for their work on the [[DC Comics|DC]] [[comic book]] ''[[Legion of Super-Heroes]]''.

==Biography==
The Bierbaums entered the world of professional comic book writing through Legion [[fandom]]. Tom Bierbaum grew up as a Legion fan, first becoming exposed to the characters via ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' #310 (July 1963).&lt;ref name="companion"&gt;Tom and Mary Bierbaum interview in [[Glen Cadigan|Cadigan, Glen]] and [[Jim Shooter|Shooter, Jim]]. ''The Legion Companion'' ([[TwoMorrows Publishing]], 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bierbaum"&gt;Bierbaum, Tom &amp; Mary. "Legion Outpost," ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' vol. 4, #3 (January 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, Mary Gilmore became a serious Legion fan in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name="companion" /&gt;

=== Interlac and marriage ===
Tom joined the Legion fan club [[The Legion Outpost]], and then the Legion [[amateur press association]] [[Interlac (APA)|Interlac]], where he met fellow member Gilmore, who had joined the APA around the same time.&lt;ref name="Bierbaum" /&gt; Through Interlac, the two struck up a relationship. Gilmore lived in California, and as Bierbaum had designs on getting into the entertainment industry, he moved out West, and the two began living together, eventually getting married.&lt;ref name="Broertjes"&gt;Broertjes, Harry. [http://members.aol.com/interlac/ "The History of Interlac (and Legion fandom, too!)," Interlac APA website.] Accessed September 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Early on in their relationship, the Bierbaums wrote stories together, their first published piece being a Halloween-themed short story for a local newspaper. (The story was actually a thinly veiled Legion of Super-Heroes story with the characters' names and situations changed.)&lt;ref name="companion" /&gt; They also submitted and published articles and stories in Interlac, which attracted the attention of veteran ''Legion'' artist [[Keith Giffen]]&lt;ref name="companion" /&gt; and future ''Legion'' editor [[Mark Waid]]&lt;ref name="Haeleury"&gt;Haeleury, Michael. [http://www.lonely.geek.nz/giffenlegionv4.html "A Preview Of DC's New Legion of Super-Heroes," ''Amazing Heroes'' #172, (Oct. 1989).] Accessed September 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; (both of whom were also Interlac members).

=== Keith Giffen and early writing work ===
Recognizing the Bierbaum's devotion to the Legion, Giffen contacted them, at first using them as a sounding board for his ideas about the Legion.&lt;ref name="companion"/&gt;  Giffen also utilized a new costume idea for [[Element Lad]] that Tom suggested.&lt;ref name="companion" /&gt;

In 1984, when Giffen was looking for a scripter for his "Lightning" stories in [[Deluxe Comics]]' ''Wally Wood's [[T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents]]'', he recruited the husband and wife writing team for the job. That, along with their work for DC's ''[[New Talent Showcase]]'' editor [[Sal Amendola]], convinced the editors at DC (specifically [[Dick Giordano]])&lt;ref name="companion" /&gt; that they were ready to become ''Legion'' scripters.

=== Legion of Super-Heroes: "Five Years Later"===
The Bierbaums wrote the first fifty issues of ''[[Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' vol. 4, from 1989–1993. Working under editor Waid and alongside Giffen and [[Al Gordon]] (who was a co-writer and [[inker]] on the book) for the first 36 issues, the Bierbaums dialogued the "Five Years Later" storyline. The revival of the title was controversial with many longtime Legion fans, as it incorporated several major "[[retcons]]," including the editorially-mandated &lt;ref name="companion"/&gt; excision of [[Superboy (Kal-El)|Superboy]] from Legion history; the housing of [[Proty]]'s consciousness in [[Lightning Lad]]'s body; and the revelation that former [[Science Police]] liaison [[Shvaughn Erin]] was actually a formerly male [[transsexual]] who used drugs to maintain her female identity, while her longtime beau [[Element Lad]] was of ambiguous sexuality and would not have required her to be female. 

After Giffen's departure, the Bierbaums continued on the title for another year, overseeing the return of several classic characters, until leaving for ''[[Legionnaires (comics)|Legionnaires]]'' (a spin-off title) after ''Legion'' issue #50 (November 1993). They wrote ''Legionnaires'' for its first 15 issues, until 1994.

The Bierbaums and Giffen also worked together on DC's short-lived offbeat title ''[[Heckler (comics)|The Heckler]]'' in 1992–1993.

=== Image and other publishers ===
After their DC work, the Bierbaums went on to write various titles for [[Image Comics]], including ''[[Supreme (comics)|Supreme]]'', ''[[SuperPatriot]]'', ''[[Youngblood (comics)|Youngblood: Strikefile]]'', and ''[[Star (comics)|Star]]'', as well as ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess (comics)|Xena: Warrior Princess]]'' and ''[[Jurassic Park (film)#Distribution|Jurassic Park]]'' for [[Topps Comics]]. Most recently, they worked on ''[[Wonderlanders]]'' for [[Oktomica]] and ''[[StormQuest]]'' for [[Caliber Comics]].

=== Personal life===
Never full-time comics writers, the couple live in [[Erie, Pennsylvania]], with their two children. Mary retired from being a nurse in 1991;&lt;ref name="Broertjes" /&gt; Tom used to freelance for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' before becoming a staffer at the short-lived entertainment/business website [[Inside.com]]. In 2001, he began work at [[NBC]] as a ratings analyst.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legiononline.net/volume5/creators.html Bierbaum bio in the Legion of Super-Heroes Online Companion: Volume 5.] Accessed September 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writing method ==
As writing partners, the Bierbaums evolved a unique collaborating style. Generally, they work together in the conceptual stage, and then Tom writes the first draft. Mary works closely with Tom on the plotting, while Tom mainly writes the dialogue, with Mary acting as a sounding board for overall "feel and direction.&lt;ref name="Haeleury" /&gt;

'''José Luis Álvarez Enparantza''' (27 September 1929 – 14 January 2012), better known by his pseudonym '''Txillardegi''', was a Basque linguist, politician and writer from Spain. Born in [[San Sebastián]] ([[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]], [[Spain]]), he did not learn the [[Basque language]] until the age of 17, but came to be considered one of the most influential figures in Basque nationalism and culture in the second half of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Noticias EFE |url=http://www.diariovasco.com/agencias/20120114/mas-actualidad/cultura/muere-txillardegi-escritor-fundo-nombre_201201141442.html |title=Muere "Txillardegi", el escritor que fundó ETA y dio nombre a la organización. |publisher=Diariovasco.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Álvarez Enparantza (the maternal surname was sometimes hispanicised as Emparanza) studied engineering in Bilbao, and linguistics in Paris. In 1957, he became a corresponding member of the [[Euskaltzaindia]] (''Academia de la Lengua Vasca'', Academy of the Basque Language), which adopted most of his proposals on the orthography and morphology of [[Standard Basque]]. In 1993 he became a member of its Commission on Pronunciation.&lt;ref name=EITB&gt;{{cite web|author=EITB |url=http://www.eitb.com/es/noticias/politica/detalle/812130/biografia-txillardegi-vida-dedicada-al-euskera/ |title=Biografía: 'Txillardegi', una vida dedicada al euskera |publisher=EITB.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; His name was put forward twice to become a full member of the Euskaltzaindia but he was turned down for political reasons. When he was going to be proposed for a third time, he himself turned down the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idazleak.org/english/writers/jose-luis-alvarez-enparantza-txillardegi?h=A&amp;p=2 Txillardegi's page in the website of the Basque Writers' Association]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a major contributor to the standardisation of Basque. His philosophy was based on the following points: 
* that if minority languages are to survive, they have to be able to deal with modern science and technology;
* that a standardised language is a key part of modernisation;
* that any subject could be discussed in an understandable way in any language, based on "trying, time, and intelligence";
* and that the main feature, among others, that should identify a person (or the country) as Basque should be knowledge of the Basque language.

He was also a well-known writer and linguist under the pseudonyms ''Larresoro'', ''Igara'' and ''Usako''. He was a writer influenced by [[existentialism]] of [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]], [[Miguel de Unamuno|Unamuno]] and [[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartre]], and also by the writer [[Bertrand Russell]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Joxe Azurmendi|Azurmendi, J.]] 1999: Txillardegiren saioa: hastapenen bila, Jakin, 114: 17-45.&lt;/ref&gt; He has had many books published, mostly to do with the Basque language and its grammar. He has also written novels and political essays. His work ''Leturiaren egunkari ezkutua'' (1957) is considered the first modern novel written in Basque and makes a clear dividing line in [[Basque literature]]. Other work included the novels ''Haizeaz bestaldetik'' (1979) and ''Putzu'' (1999); the influential essays ''Huntaz eta hartaz'' (1965), ''Hizkuntza eta pentsakera'' (1972) and ''Euskal Herria helburu'' (1994), and the academic works ''Euskal fonologia'' (1980), ''Euskal azentuaz'' (1984) and ''Elebidun gizartearen azterketa matematikoa'' (1984).

In 1968 he won the Txomin Agirre award for his novel ''Elsa Scheelen''. He also won the Andima award in Caracas in 1969 for books on teaching mathematics. He won the ''Silver Lauburu'' for his book ''Euskal Gramatika'' in Bilbo in 1980.

In the 1970s Txillardegi co-founded the ''Euskal Herrian Euskaraz'' Basque language movement. In 1982 he began lecturing in the [[University of the Basque Country]], of which he later became a professor emeritus.&lt;ref name=EITB/&gt;

The database of the Basque scientific-intellectual community [[:eu:Inguma (datu-basea)|Inguma]] shows references to 122 products (paper, books, talks etc.) created by Txillardegi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inguma.org/egiledatuakgakoa.php?egile_gakoa=5392&amp;hizkuntza=eu Reference to 122 products created by Txillardegi in Inguma database]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political activity ==
A member of the [[Basque Nationalist Party]] (PNV) in his youth, he promoted the defence and study of the [[Basque language]] as the basis of Basque identity.

After becoming disillusioned with the PNV, Txillardegi was one of the founders of [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] in 1959, together with a group of young nationalists and was the visible leader of the cultural branch of the movement. In 1961 he fled into exile, in Paris and Brussels, returning in 1967. In 1976 he and Iñaki Aldekoa formed a political party, the ''Euskal Sozialista Biltzarrea'' (ESB: ''Congreso de Socialistas Vascos'', Basque Socialist Congress).&lt;ref name=EITB/&gt;

Txillardegi participated in the foundation in 1977 of [[Herri Batasuna]] and was elected senator for the [[abertzale]] coalition in the first elections.

Coming to believe that the armed struggle was unviable, for a time he was active in [[Aralar Party|Aralar]]. In the general elections of 2008, he announced his Senate candidacy for the [[Eusko Abertzale Ekintza]] party (''Acción Nacionalista Vasca'', Basque Nationalist Action) for the precinct of Guipúzcoa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://es.noticias.yahoo.com/ep/20080130/tpl-anv-registra-en-la-junta-electoral-l-679ba16.html ANV registra en la Junta Electoral las listas por Guipúzcoa al Congreso y Senado y dice que mantendrá su "rumbo político"]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Stoughton''' (1631 – July 7, 1701) was a colonial magistrate and administrator in the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]]. He was in charge of what have come to be known as the [[Salem Witch Trials]], first as the Chief Justice of the Special Court of [[Oyer and Terminer]] in 1692, and then as the Chief Justice of the Superior Court of Judicature in 1693.  In these trials he controversially accepted [[spectral evidence]] (based on supposed demonic visions). Unlike some of the other magistrates, he never admitted to the possibility that his acceptance of such evidence was in error.

After graduating from [[Harvard College]] in 1650, he continued religious studies in England, where he also preached.  Returning to Massachusetts in 1662, he chose to enter politics instead of the ministry.  An adept politician, he served in virtually every government through the period of turmoil in Massachusetts that encompassed the revocation of its first charter in 1684 and the introduction of its second charter in 1692, including the unpopular rule of Sir [[Edmund Andros]] in the late 1680s.  He served as lieutenant governor of the province from 1692 until his death in 1701, acting as governor (in the absence of an appointed governor) for about six years.  He was one of the province's major landowners, partnering with [[Joseph Dudley]] and other powerful  figures in land purchases, and it was for him that the town of [[Stoughton, Massachusetts]] was named.

==Early life==
William Stoughton was born in 1631 to [[Israel Stoughton]] and Elizabeth Knight Stoughton.  The exact location of his birth is uncertain, because there is no known birth or baptismal record for him, and the date when his parents migrated from [[England]] to the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] is not known with precision.  What is known is that by 1632 the Stoughtons were in the colony, where they were early settlers of [[Dorchester, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, pp 1773–5&lt;/ref&gt;

Stoughton graduated from [[Harvard College]] in 1650 with a degree in theology. He intended to become a [[Puritan]] [[religious minister|minister]] and traveled to England, where he continued his studies in [[New College, Oxford]].  He graduated with an M.A. in theology in 1653.&lt;ref name=CS480/&gt;  Stoughton was a pious preacher who believed in the "Lord's promise and expectations of great things."&lt;ref&gt;Felt, p. 424&lt;/ref&gt;  England was at the time under Puritan [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth Rule]], although 1653 was the year [[Oliver Cromwell]] dissolved Parliament, beginning [[The Protectorate]].&lt;ref&gt;Manganiello, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;  Stoughton preached in [[Sussex]], and after [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] was [[English Restoration|restored to the throne]] in 1660, Stoughton lost his position in the crackdown on religious dissenters that followed.&lt;ref name=S195/&gt;

==Politics and land development==
[[File:Lieut-Gov William Stoughton by Evert Duyckinck.png|thumb|right|William Stoughton, {{circa|lk=no|1685}}, portrait by Evert Duyckinck, in the collection of the [[Boston Athenæum]]]]With little prospect for another position in England, Stoughton returned to Massachusetts in 1662.&lt;ref name=S195&gt;Sibley, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;  He preached on several occasions at Dorchester and Cambridge, but refused offers of permanent ministerial posts.  He instead became involved in politics and land development.  He served on the colony's council of assistants (a precursor to the idea of a governor's council) almost every year from 1671 to 1686, and represented the colony in the [[New England Confederation]] from 1673 to 1677 and 1680 to 1686.&lt;ref name=CS480/&gt;  In the 1684 election, [[Joseph Dudley]], who had been labelled as an enemy of the colony (along with Stoughton, Bulkley, and others) for his moderate position on colonial charter issues, failed to win reelection to the council.  Stoughton, who was reelected by a small majority and was a friend and business partner of Dudley, refused to serve in protest.&lt;ref&gt;Lovejoy, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Joseph Dudley attributed to Peter Lely.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Stoughton's friend and business partner, [[Joseph Dudley]]]]
In 1676 he was chosen, along with [[Peter Bulkley (1643-1688)|Peter Bulkley]], to be an agent representing colonial interests in England.  Their instructions were narrowly tailored.  They were authorized to acquire land claims from the heirs of Sir [[Ferdinando Gorges]] and [[John Mason (governor)|John Mason]] that conflicted with some Massachusetts land claims in present-day [[Maine]]. These they acquired for £1,200,&lt;ref name=S184/&gt; incurring the anger of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who had intended to acquire those claims for the [[James II of England|Duke of York]].&lt;ref name=L140/&gt; They were unsuccessful in maintaining broader claims made by Massachusetts against other territories of Maine and the [[Province of New Hampshire]]. Their limited authority upset the [[Board of Trade|Lords of Trade]], who sought to have the colonial laws modified to conform to their policies.&lt;ref name=S184&gt;Staloff, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; The mission of Stoughton and Bulkley did little more than antagonize colonial officials in London  because of their hardline stance.&lt;ref name=L140&gt;Lovejoy, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years Stoughton and Joseph Dudley were friends, as well as political and business partners.&lt;ref&gt;Quincy, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;  The two worked closely together politically, and engaged in land development together.  In the 1680s Stoughton acquired significant amounts of land from the [[Nipmuc|Nipmuc tribe]] in what is now [[Worcester County, Massachusetts|Worcester County]] in partnership with Dudley. The partnership included a venture that established [[Oxford, Massachusetts|Oxford]] as a place to settle refugee [[Huguenots]].

Dudley and Stoughton used their political positions to ensure that the titles to lands they were interested in were judicially cleared, a practice that also benefited their friends, relatives, and other business partners.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, pp. 88–97&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning this practice, Crown agent [[Edward Randolph (colonial administrator)|Edward Randolph]] wrote that it was "impossible to bring titles of land to trial before them where his Majesties's rights are concerned, the Judges also being parties."&lt;ref&gt;Martin, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; This was particularly obvious when Stoughton and Dudley were part of a venture to acquire {{convert|1|e6acre|km2}} of land in the [[Merrimack River]] valley. Dudley's council, on which Stoughton and other investors sat, formally cleared that land's title in May 1686.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

When Dudley was commissioned in 1686 to temporarily head the [[Dominion of New England]], Stoughton was appointed to his council, and he was then elected by the council as the deputy president.&lt;ref&gt;Lovejoy, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;  During the administration of Sir [[Edmund Andros]] he served as a magistrate and on the council.  As a magistrate he was particularly harsh on the town leaders of [[Ipswich, Massachusetts|Ipswich]], who had organized tax protests against the dominion government, based on the claim that dominion rule without representation violated the [[Rights of Englishmen]].&lt;ref&gt;Lovejoy, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; When Andros [[1689 Boston revolt|was arrested]] in April 1689 in a bloodless uprising inspired by the 1688 [[Glorious Revolution]] in England, Stoughton was one of the signatories to the declaration of the revolt's ringleaders.&lt;ref&gt;Lovejoy, pp. 241–242&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite this statement of support for the popular cause, he was sufficiently unpopular due to his association with Andros that he was denied elective offices.&lt;ref&gt;''The Quarterly Register'', p. 338&lt;/ref&gt;  He appealed to the politically powerful Mather family, with whom he still had positive relations.  In 1692,&lt;ref&gt;Quincy, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; when [[Increase Mather]] and Sir [[William Phips]] arrived from England carrying the charter for the new [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]] and a royal commission for Phips as governor, they also brought one for Stoughton as lieutenant governor.&lt;ref&gt;Quincy, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lieutenant governor and chief justice==

===Witch trials===
{{main|Salem witch trials}}
[[File:WilliamStoughton-personalseal.jpg|thumb|100px|right|Stoughton's personal seal, as it appeared on the warrant for the execution of [[Bridget Bishop]]]]
When Phips arrived, rumors of witchcraft were running rampant, especially in [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]].&lt;ref&gt;Cowing, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;  Phips immediately appointed Stoughton to head a special tribunal to deal with accusations of witchcraft, and in June appointed him chief justice of the colonial courts, a post he would hold for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=C93/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hurd, pp. xiv, xvi&lt;/ref&gt;

In the now-notorious [[Salem Witch Trials]], Stoughton acted as both chief judge and prosecutor. He was particularly harsh on some of the defendants, sending the jury deliberating in the case of [[Rebecca Nurse]] back to reconsider its not guilty verdict; after doing so, she was convicted.&lt;ref name=C93&gt;Cowing, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;  Many convictions were made because Stoughton permitted the use of [[spectral evidence]], the idea that a demonic vision could only take on the shape or appearance of someone who had made some sort of devilish pact or engaged in witchcraft. Although [[Cotton Mather]] argued that this type of evidence was acceptable when making accusations, some judges expressed reservations about its use in judicial proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;Cowing, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; Stoughton, however, was convinced of its acceptability, and may have influenced other judges to this view.&lt;ref name="Cowing, p. 94"&gt;Cowing, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; The special court stopped sitting in September 1692.&lt;ref name=D2657/&gt;

In November and December 1692 Governor Phips oversaw a reorganization of the colony's courts to bring them into conformance with English practice.  The new courts, with Stoughton still sitting as chief justice, began to handle the witchcraft cases in 1693, but were under specific instructions from Phips to disregard spectral evidence. As a result, a significant number of cases were dismissed due to a lack of evidence, and Phips vacated the few convictions that were made. On 3 January 1693 Stoughton ordered the execution of all suspected witches who had been exempted by their pregnancy. Phips denied enforcement of the order.&lt;ref name=D2657&gt;Dunn, pp. 265–267&lt;/ref&gt; This turn of events angered Stoughton, and he briefly left the bench in protest.&lt;ref name=C93/&gt;

Historian Cedric Cowing suggests that Stoughton's acceptance of spectral evidence was based partly in a need he saw to reassert Puritan authority in the province.&lt;ref name="Cowing, p. 94"/&gt; Unlike his colleague [[Samuel Sewall]], who later expressed regret for his actions on the bench in the  trials, Stoughton never admitted that his actions and beliefs with respect to spectral evidence and the trials were in error.&lt;ref&gt;''The Quarterly Register'', p. 339&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acting governor===
Stoughton was also involved in overseeing the colonial response to [[King William's War]], which had broken out in 1689. Massachusetts Bay (which included the area now known as [[Maine]]) was in the forefront of the war with [[New France]], and its northern frontier communities suffered significantly from French and Indian raids.&lt;ref&gt;Leach, pp. 84–104&lt;/ref&gt;  Governor Phips was frequently in Maine overseeing the construction of defenses there, leaving Stoughton to oversee affairs in Boston.&lt;ref&gt;Rawlyk, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;  During one such absence, for example, Stoughton was responsible for raising a small force of militia intended to help protect neighboring New Hampshire, which was similarly being devastated by raids.&lt;ref&gt;Leach, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1694 Phips was recalled to London, to answer charges of misconduct. He delayed his departure until November, at which time Stoughton took over as acting governor. Phips died in London in early 1695, before the charges against him were heard.&lt;ref&gt;Dunn, pp. 268–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William Phips - Project Gutenberg etext 20110.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Sir [[William Phips]], Massachusetts governor 1692–1694]]
Stoughton viewed himself as a caretaker, holding the government until the crown appointed a new governor. As a consequence, he gave the provincial assembly a significant degree of autonomy, which, once established, complicated the relationship the assembly had with later governors.  He also took relatively few active steps to implement colonial policies, and only did the minimum needed to follow instructions from London.  A commentator in the colonial office observed that he was a "good scholar", but that he was "not suited to enforce the [[Navigation Acts|Navigation Act]]".&lt;ref&gt;Pencak, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1695 Stoughton protested the actions of French [[privateer]]s operating from [[Acadia]], who were wreaking havoc in the New England fishing and merchant fleets.&lt;ref&gt;Rawlyk, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to counter this activity, he authorized [[Benjamin Church (ranger)|Benjamin Church]] to organize a raid against Acadia. While Church was recruiting men for the expedition, New France's governor, [[Louis de Buade de Frontenac|the comte de Frontenac]], organized an expedition to target [[Fort William Henry (Pemaquid Beach, Maine)|the English fort at Pemaquid, Maine]]. Church had still not departed in August 1696 when he learned that the fort [[Siege of Pemaquid (1696)|had been taken and destroyed]].&lt;ref&gt;Rawlyk, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;  The instructions Stoughton issued to Church were somewhat vague, and he did little more than raid [[Beaubassin]] at the top of the [[Bay of Fundy]] before returning to Boston.  Before Church's return Stoughton organized a second, smaller expedition that unsuccessfully besieged Fort Nashwaak on the [[Saint John River (Bay of Fundy)|Saint John River]]. The failure of these expeditions highlighted the inadequacies of the provincial forces, and the Massachusetts assembly appealed to London for aid.&lt;ref&gt;Rawlyk, pp. 82–83&lt;/ref&gt;

Peace between France and England was achieved with the [[Treaty of Ryswick]] in 1697, but it did not resolve any issues concerning the [[Abenaki people|Abenakis]] to the north.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, pp. 141–142&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, there continued to be tension on the frontier, and disputes over fishing grounds and the use of Acadian territory by New Englanders for drying fish continued. Stoughton and Acadian Governor [[Joseph Robineau de Villebon]] exchanged complaints and threats in 1698 over the issue, with Villebon issuing largely empty threats (he lacked the needed resources to execute them) to seize Massachusetts ships and property left in Acadian territory.&lt;ref&gt;Rawlyk, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;  Stoughton appealed to London for diplomatic assistance, which had some success in reducing tensions.&lt;ref&gt;Rawlyk, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

Stoughton served as acting governor until 1699, while still also serving as chief justice. He remained lieutenant governor during the brief tenure of [[Richard Coote, 1st Earl of Bellomont|the Earl of Bellomont]] as governor, and again became acting governor on the latter's departure in 1700.  He was by then in poor health, and accomplished little of note in his final year.&lt;ref&gt;Sibley, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harvard and the Brattle Street Church===
[[File:1859 BrattleSqChurch byJJHawes Boston.png|thumb|right|upright|The [[Brattle Street Church]], 1859]]
The corporate existence of [[Harvard College]] had been thrown into turmoil by the recission of the colonial charter in 1684, upon which the Harvard charter depended. In 1692 the provincial assembly passed a law enacting a new charter for the college, but the Board of Trade vetoed this law in 1696, again throwing the college's existence into jeopardy.  Stoughton, then acting governor, made temporary arrangements for the college's governance while the assembly worked to craft a new charter.&lt;ref&gt;Quincy, pp. 69–82&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, Harvard's charter problems would not be solved until 1707, when its 1650 charter was revived.&lt;ref&gt;Quincy, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious and political differences between factions of directors at Harvard boiled into the open during the late 1690s. [[Increase Mather]], then the president of Harvard, was theologically conservative, while a number of the directors had adopted moderate views, and in these years they began a struggle for control of the college.&lt;ref&gt;Quincy, pp. 127–129&lt;/ref&gt; This split eventually led to the founding in 1698 of Boston's [[Brattle Street Church]], which issued a manifesto explicitly distancing itself from some of the more extreme Puritan practices advocated by Mather and his son, [[Cotton Mather|Cotton]].&lt;ref&gt;Quincy, pp. 130–132&lt;/ref&gt;  Stoughton and a number of other high-profile religious and political figures in the colony stepped in to resolve the dispute.&lt;ref&gt;Quincy, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; The peace was so successfully brokered that the elder Mather took part in the new church's dedicatory services.&lt;ref&gt;Quincy, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family and legacy==
He died at home in Dorchester in 1701, while serving as acting governor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mass.gov/portal/government-taxes/laws/interactive-state-house/historical/governors-of-massachusetts/royal-colony-of-massachusetts-1692-1774/william-stoughton-1631-1701.html|title=Biography of William Stoughton|publisher=State of Massachusetts|accessdate=2011-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was buried in the cemetery now known as the [[Dorchester North Burying Ground]].&lt;ref&gt;Boston Cemetery Department, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a bachelor, and willed a portion of his estate and his mansion to [[William Tailer]], the son of his sister Rebeccah.&lt;ref&gt;Clapp, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;  Tailer, who was twice lieutenant governor and briefly served as acting governor,&lt;ref&gt;Clapp, pp. 22–24&lt;/ref&gt; was buried alongside Stoughton.&lt;ref&gt;Boston Cemetery Department, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

The only sermon of Stoughton's to be published was entitled ''New-Englands True Interest''.&lt;ref&gt;McWilliams, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt;  The sermon was originally delivered at the election of 1668, and was published in 1670.&lt;ref&gt;McWilliams, p. 337&lt;/ref&gt;  In it he harkened back to the founding of the colony, saying "God sifted a whole Nation that he might send choice Grain over into this Wilderness", but also lamented what he saw as a decline in Massachusetts society, and urged the lay members of society to defer judgment to their clerical elders.&lt;ref name=S163&gt;Staloff, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;

The town of [[Stoughton, Massachusetts]] is named in his honor,&lt;ref name=CS480&gt;Colby and Sandeman, p. 480&lt;/ref&gt; as is [[Stoughton Hall|one of the Harvard College dormitories]] in [[Harvard Yard]].  Construction of the first Stoughton Hall, in 1698, was made possible by his £1,000 gift.&lt;ref&gt;Quincy, p. 180&lt;!--engraving of 1698 building on p. 194--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
