[[Louis Braille]]'s original publication, ''Procedure for Writing Words, Music, and Plainsong in Dots'' (1829),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfb.org/Images/nfb/Publications/braille/TheFirstPublicationoftheBrailleCode.html ''Procédé pour écrire les Paroles, la Musique, et le Plain-chant au moyen de points''] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/69o3fSsEr?url=http://www.nfb.org/Images/nfb/Publications/braille/TheFirstPublicationoftheBrailleCode.html |date=2012-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; credits Barbier's [[night writing]] as being the basis for the [[braille|braille script]]. It differed in a fundamental way from modern braille: It contained nine decades (series) of characters rather than the modern five, utilizing dashes as well as dots. Braille recognized, however, that the dashes were problematic, being difficult to distinguish from the dots in practice, and those characters were abandoned in the second edition of the book.

The first four decades indicated the 40 letters of the alphabet (39 letters of the French alphabet, plus English&lt;!--not German: German was not supported until later--&gt; ''w''); the fifth the digits; the sixth punctuation; the seventh and part of the eighth mathematical symbols. The seventh decade was also used for musical notes. Most of the remaining characters were unassigned.

==Script==
[[File:1829 braille.jpg|thumb|The character tables of Braille's 1829 publication.]]
As in modern braille, most of the higher decades were derived from the first:

*Decades 1–4 were the same as today and had their modern [[French braille|French values]].
*Decade 5 was not derived from the first. (See image at left or table below.) Like the first decade, only the top half of the cell was used.&lt;ref&gt;In the image, digits 9 and 0 appear shifted downward. However, the verbal description clarifies that they also occupy the top half of the cell.&lt;/ref&gt; The digit 1 was a dash in the top row; 2 was dashes in the top and mid rows. (That is, these were ''a'' and ''b'', or modern digits ''1'' and ''2'', but with dashes in place of dots.) 3–5 were a top dash with a left, double, and right dot in the middle; 6–8 were a mid dash with a left, double, and right dot at top. 9 and 0 were ''a'' and ''b'' shifted to the right (that is, the modern French superscript and currency signs, {{braille cell|type=text|4}} and {{braille cell|type=text|45}}): [[File:Old braille, 5th decade.png|175px]]
*Decade 6 was derived from the first by adding dash at the bottom. That is, it resembled the 3rd decade with the two bottom dots connected into a line.
*Decade 7 was formed with a dash in the top row of the cell, displacing the dots of the first decade downward. That is, it was much like the modern fifth decade with an overstruck dash at the top. For the 1st and 3rd characters of the decade, however, the dots were shifted all the way down to the bottom row, rather than shifted once to the middle as in the modern 5th decade:  No character outside the original 1st and 5th decades occupied just the top half of the cell.
*Decade 8 was formed by ''splitting'' the first decade with a dash, placing it between the upper and lower parts of each sign.&lt;ref&gt;Braille conceived of his script as being based on a 4-dote, 2×2 square supplemented with additional dots and dashes. Thus the middle row is the lower part of the basic sign, and the bottom row is below the basic sign; thus the letter ''b'' has a dot in "each" position of the left-hand column, while the letter ''l'' has an additional dot "below" the column.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, a dash appeared in the middle row, displacing the dots of that row to the bottom of the cell. In the case of first and 3rd characters (from ''a'' and ''c''), which did not have dots in the middle row, the dots at the top were displaced to the bottom instead. That is, this decade was equivalent to adding an overstrike to {{braille cell|type=text|3|13|36|146|16 |134 |1346 |136 |34 |346}}.
*Decade 9 was derived from the fifth (the digits) by adding a dash in the bottom row. These were left unassigned apart from the first three, which were used when needed as markers of words, music, and [[plainsong]], respectively.
Thus the 1st and 5th decades occupied only the top half of the cell, while all characters in the other decades had a dot or dash in the bottom row.

The supplemental signs were {{braille cell|type=text|3|36|345|3456}} and a top dash with {{braille cell|type=text|6|56}}.&lt;ref&gt;Only the four of these without a dash were defined, with their modern values of apostrophe, hyphen, [[∝|proportionality (∝)]], and the number/symbol indicator.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 125 (5³) possible patterns, 97 were used. The modern 5th decade and other supplemental signs do not appear in the 1829 version of braille, apart from {{bc|type=text|5}} and {{bc|type=text|25}} in plainsong notation.

Punctuation differed slightly from today, even accounting for the shift downward when the dash was dropped from the bottom row of the cell. {{braille cell|type=text|()}} was used for both parentheses, as in modern [[English braille]]. {{braille cell|type=text|hh}} was used for either quotation mark; {{braille cell|type=text|jj}} was a [[pipe (punctuation)|pipe]]. {{braille cell|type=text|en}} was the question mark, as in modern French braille, while {{braille cell|type=text|in}} was the asterisk, which is used doubled in English braille.

===Substitutions for the dash===
Anticipating that the dashes might prove problematic, Braille provided that the supplemental sign {{braille cell|type=text|num}} (now known as the number sign) would shift the decade by four. That is, adding it to the first four decades would produce substitutes for the fifth through eighth. Only its use to replace the old fifth decade has been retained; the old sixth decade survives as the modern fifth, with the dash removed and the dots shifted down to replace it. The original proposal was as follows:

==Musical notation==
The book allots a great deal of space to the representation of music. Instrumental notation was largely a one-to-one transcription of the system already in use for the blind. The durations of the notes and the [[accidental (music)|accidental]]s, however, had to be replaced; for these the 7th decade was used, as shown in the table above.&lt;ref&gt;If the symbols do not display in your browser, they are ''whole note, half note, quarter note,'' etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

A simplified system for [[plainsong]] was provided. The twelve notes are the twelve characters of the upper half of the cell (the first and fifth decades) which do not have dashes.&lt;ref&gt;These are the twelve characters in the top row of the table for ''[[braille#upper-half cells|the 64 Braille cells]]'' in the main article.&lt;/ref&gt; By themselves (1st decade), they indicate half notes. Quarter notes are 2nd decade, dotted quarter notes 3rd, and eighth notes 4th. Dotted half notes are indicated by a dash below (6th decade), whole notes by a dash above (7th decade), and dotted whole notes by a mid dash (8th decade). The alto, bass, treble, and tenor [[clef]]s were indicated by the 5th–8th characters of the fifth decade. {{bc|type=text|5}} is the sharp-note prefix, {{bc|type=text|25}} the bass-note prefix, and the equivalent with a dash the natural prefix. {{braille cell|type=text|3|36}} are the repetition sign and 'star'.

==Shorthand==
The book finishes with a proposal for braille [[shorthand]], utilizing the first decade for vowels, and the fifth for consonants (without a [[voiced consonant|voicing]] distinction). That is, Braille's shorthand used a 4-dot cell rather than the standard 6-dot cell, taking two-thirds the space of normal braille, and one-third the space of Barbier's night writing.

==Second edition==
[[File:Final braille.png|thumb|The final form of Braille's alphabet, according to Henri (1952). The decade diacritics are listed at left, and the supplementary letters are assigned to the appropriate decade at right. "(1)" indicates markers for musical and mathematical notation.]]
In the classroom, Braille's students found the characters with dashes to be impractical, as the dashes were not easily distinguishable from pairs of dots, and they were quickly abandoned. The second edition of the ''Procédé'', published in 1837, sets out [[French Braille#History|French Braille]] essentially as we know it today.&lt;ref&gt;Zina Weygand, 2003, ''Aveugles dans la société française, du Moyen Age au siècle de Louis Braille''&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Henri (1952), at right, the numerical sign was used with the new fifth decade, plus one of the supplementary characters, for mathematical notation:  {{braille cell|type=text|num}}{{braille cell|type=text|235}} +, {{braille cell|type=text|num}}{{braille cell|type=text|36}} &amp;minus;, {{braille cell|type=text|num}}{{braille cell|type=text|236}} ×, {{braille cell|type=text|num}}{{braille cell|type=text|256}} /, {{braille cell|type=text|num}}{{braille cell|type=text|2356}} =, {{braille cell|type=text|num}}{{braille cell|type=text|345}} [[√]].  Several of these values continue today in [[Antoine notation]].

'''ATM SafetyPIN software''' is a [[software application]] that would allow users of [[automated teller machine]]s (ATMs)  to alert the police of a forced cash withdrawal by entering their [[personal identification number]] (PIN) in reverse order.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zicubedatm.com/ ZICUBED ATM SAFETYPIN] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809221032/http://www.zicubedatm.com/ |date=August 9, 2007 }} ATM Safety PIN aka Reverse PIN Web Site.&lt;/ref&gt; The system was patented by [[Illinois]] lawyer Joseph Zingher ({{US patent|5731575}}).

SafetyPIN is not currently used in ATM systems, despite widely circulated rumors originating from a [[chain letter]] e-mail, mainly due to issues regarding reversible PINs being incompatible with the system and potential [[Vulnerability (computing)|security vulnerabilities]] that could arise if implemented.

== History ==
The concept of a backup emergency PIN system, or [[duress code]], for ATM systems has been around since at least July 30, 1986, when [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Mario Biaggi]], a former police officer, proposed it in the U.S. [[Congressional Record]], pp.&amp;nbsp;18232 et seq. Biaggi then proposed House Resolution 785 in 1987 which would have had the [[FBI]] track the problem of [[express kidnapping]]s and evaluate the idea of an emergency PIN system. HR785 died in committee without debate.

Zingher has not been successful in marketing licenses for his patent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fsb/fsb_archive/2006/02/01/8368177/index.htm Why Great Ideas Get Shot Down] CNNMoney.com, 01-27-2006&lt;/ref&gt; 
Police in New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Illinois,  and Kansas have supported the concept.&lt;ref&gt;Asbury Park Press, January 25th, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wlwt.com/news/2896611/detail.html Are Local Banks Doing All They Can To Protect ATM Users?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928035101/http://www.wlwt.com/news/2896611/detail.html |date=September 28, 2007 }} Jesse Jones, WLWT.

Police support prompted the Illinois legislature to pass a law making it mandatory on all ATMs in Illinois. The law was changed shortly after it was passed by a "follow-on" bill that changed the meaning to the exact opposite of what they were seeking.&lt;ref&gt;St. Louis Post Dispatch, March 27, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ilga.gov/legislation/publicacts/93/093-0898.htm Public Act 093-0898] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930040642/http://ilga.gov/legislation/publicacts/93/093-0898.htm |date=September 30, 2007 }} Illinois General Assembly&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=1192&amp;ChapAct=205%26nbsp%3BILCS%26nbsp%3B616%2F&amp;ChapterID=20&amp;ChapterName=FINANCIAL+REGULATION&amp;ActName=Electronic+Fund+Transfer+Act%2E FINANCIAL REGULATION (205 ILCS 616/) Electronic Fund Transfer Act]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928051711/http://ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=1192&amp;ChapAct=205&amp;nbsp%3BILCS&amp;nbsp%3B616%2F&amp;ChapterID=20&amp;ChapterName=FINANCIAL+REGULATION&amp;ActName=Electronic+Fund+Transfer+Act. |date=September 28, 2006 }} Illinois General Assembly&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4086277/ Banking on ATM Safety] ''Forbes'', 01-28-2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, an e-mail [[chain letter]] [[hoax]] circulated that claimed a reverse PIN duress code system is in place universally.&lt;ref name="Diebold"&gt;[http://www.diebold.com/atmsecurity/securityupdate.htm Security Update - Reverse PIN Hoax] Diebold, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[American Banker]]'' reported on January 2, 2007 that no PIN-reversal duress code is used on any ATM as of that date. 
In September 2013 the hoax was still circulating in Australia with the text:

{{quote|If you should ever be forced by a robber to withdraw money from an ATM, you can notify the police by entering your PIN in reverse. For example if your PIN is 1234 then you would put in 4321. The ATM recognizes that your PIN is backwards from the ATM card you placed in the machine. The machine will still give you the money you requested, but unknown to the robber, the police will be immediately dispatched to help you. This information was recently broadcast on TV and it states that it is seldom used because people don't know it exists. Please pass this along to everyone possible. Australian Federal Police. AFP Web site: http://www.afp.gov.au}}

The same kind of e-mail [[chain letter]] [[hoax]] is still circulated on [[Tumblr]] and [[Facebook]], as well as in [[India]] and other parts of the world.

Were the system implemented, [[palindrome|palindromic]] PINs such as 5555 or 2112 then would be unavailable so that false alarms would not occur. Moreover, PINs that are semi-reversible such as 5255 or 1241, where the first and last numbers are the same, would be something to avoid as well so that accidental alarms would not be triggered by mistakenly switching the middle numbers.

[[Diebold]], a manufacturer of ATMs, states on their website that no such emergency alerting system is currently in use.  They cite an article in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch which claims bankers oppose the reverse-PIN system out of concerns that "ATM users might hesitate or fumble while trying to enter their PINs backwards under duress, possibly increasing the chances of violence." Diebold further states that they would be willing to support such technology if their customers (presumably banks) request it.&lt;ref name="Diebold" /&gt;

A bill making the reverse emergency PIN system mandatory on all ATMs in the state of Illinois was proposed on February 10, 2009.  Subsection (i) is the new bill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?DocName=&amp;SessionId=76&amp;GA=96&amp;DocTypeId=SB&amp;DocNum=1355&amp;GAID=10&amp;LegID=42570&amp;SpecSess=&amp;Session= Illinois General Assembly - Full Text of SB1355] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306051519/http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?DocName=&amp;SessionId=76&amp;GA=96&amp;DocTypeId=SB&amp;DocNum=1355&amp;GAID=10&amp;LegID=42570&amp;SpecSess=&amp;Session= |date=March 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
i) A terminal operated in this State must be designed and programmed so that when a consumer enters his or her personal identification number in reverse order, the terminal automatically sends an alarm to the local law enforcement agency having jurisdiction over the terminal location. The Commissioner shall promulgate rules necessary for the implementation of this subsection (i).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2009, Los Angeles City Councilman Greig Smith announced his intention to make the ReversePIN system mandatory on all ATMs in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local-beat/ATM-Duress-Code-Good-Idea-Any-Takers-56739192.html|title=Teen's Slaying Prompts Talk of ATM Duress Code|author=|date=|website=nbclosangeles.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Adobe Captivate''' is an authoring tool that is used for creating elearning content such as software demonstrations, software simulations, branched scenarios, and randomized quizzes in Small Web Formats ([[SWF|.swf]]) and HTML5 formats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Adobe Captivate Help {{!}} Publish projects as SWF files|url = https://helpx.adobe.com/captivate/using/publish-projects-swf-files.html|website = helpx.adobe.com|accessdate = 2015-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Adobe Captivate Help {{!}} Publish projects as HTML5 files|url = https://helpx.adobe.com/captivate/using/publish-projects-html5-files.html|website = helpx.adobe.com|accessdate = 2015-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can also convert Adobe Captivate-generated file formats (.swf) to digital MP4 ([[.mp4]]) formats which can be played with media players or uploaded to video hosting websites. For software simulations, Captivate can use left or right mouse clicks, key presses and rollover images.

It can also be used to create [[screencast]]s, and to convert [[Microsoft PowerPoint]] presentations to [[.swf]] and HTML5 formats.

==History==
While the product started out as a pure screen recording utility known as Flashcam (Nexus Concepts 2002), it evolved into an [[E-learning]] [[Authoring systems|authoring tool]] after [[San Diego]]-based eHelp Corporation acquired Flashcam and released it as RoboDemo.  Eventually, software firm [[Macromedia]] acquired eHelp to gain RoboDemo.  Shortly before Adobe Systems acquired Macromedia, they changed the name of the product to Captivate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10571">The '''Aiken tube''' was the first successful [[flat panel display|flat panel]] [[black and white television]]. Originally designed in the early 1950s, a small number of tubes were built in 1958 for military use in a collaboration with [[Kaiser Industries]]. An extended patent battle followed with a similar technology developed in the United Kingdom and planned commercial production for the home market never started. Further development was carried out by a number of companies, including [[Sinclair Electronics]] and [[RCA]] after the patents had expired.

==History==
===Genesis===
William Ross Aiken was an [[electrical engineering]] undergraduate student at [[UC Berkeley]] in 1941. Originally expecting to graduate in the Class of 1942, he decided to take a year off and work in industry. He got a job at the Kaiser Shipyards plant number 2 in [[Richmond, California]], and was promoted to head of the electrical department. When the US entered [[World War II]], Aiken's selective service status was declared as category 1-B. He was one of seven people in the country "frozen" in their jobs by [[Emory S. Land|Admiral Land]] and unable to leave their job under any circumstances.&lt;ref name=int2&gt;''Interview'', pg. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

When the war ended Aiken was drafted, but declared 4-F due to [[asthma]], and was instead sent to work in industry in a variety of jobs. He spent the next six years working for the [[University of California Radiation Laboratory]], today's [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]], designing controls for the [[cyclotron]]s being built there. He was then put in charge of developing an [[x-ray spectrometer]] for measuring the temperature of the fireballs from [[nuclear weapon]]s.&lt;ref name=int2/&gt; While working on these developments he was sent to [[Eniwetok]] during a series of nuclear tests.

It was during this time that he came up with the idea for a new type of thin [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT) while he was working with [[oscilloscopes]]. He thought the display tubes in use at the time were too long, and a shorter tube would be much more practical.&lt;ref name=int4&gt;''Interview'', pg. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Aiken was not the first to consider the possibility of a compact CRT with a thin display screen, but no-one had been successful in developing one at that point. There were any number of problems, especially with focusing arrangements, but Aiken kept attacking them one by one until he developed what he felt was a workable solution.&lt;ref name=int5&gt;''Interview'', pg. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Having sketched out the idea, he went to the [[U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]], his employer at the time, but they didn't find the concept interesting. Returning from Eniwetok he next approached the Radiation Laboratory, but they too declined to take up development. He decided to build a thin CRT prototype on his own. He rented space in the basement of a [[post office]], and developed a working tube that could draw and move a dot around the screen.&lt;ref name=int6&gt;''Interview'', pg. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kaiser enters===
It was one thing to draw a dot on the screen and move it around, it is another entirely to make a working television. Looking for development capital, Aiken started shopping the concept around to anyone who expressed an interest. [[Warner Brothers]] sent an engineer to examine it, but declined to fund development believing it was being faked. [[Walter Ransom Gail Baker|Walter Baker]], the  head of [[General Electric]]'s research labs, called Aiken to set up a meeting, but Aiken demanded they sign a [[non-disclosure agreement]] and Baker refused.&lt;ref name=int7&gt;''Interview'', pg. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Aiken then approached some of his old contacts at Kaiser, and they proved much more interested and happy to sign the non-disclosure agreement. After seeing the unit and how it worked they decided to fund development using profits from another division. When they discovered that the profits were due to an accounting error, development almost ended.&lt;ref name=int10&gt;''Interview'', pg. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

By this time the [[United States Naval Research Laboratory]] had heard about his work and were very interested in developing it as an interactive plotting table for displaying the data from [[sonobuoy]]s in anti-submarine [[helicopter]]s.&lt;ref name=int9&gt;''Interview'', pg. 9&lt;/ref&gt; They later added an additional role as a [[heads up display]] for the [[T-2 Buckeye]] trainer, which required a transparent phosphor so the pilot could look through the display and out of the canopy.&lt;ref name=int12&gt;''Interview'', pg. 12&lt;/ref&gt; With their funding secure, Kaiser set up a new laboratory in [[Palo Alto, California]]. [[Shockley Semiconductor]] collaborated on the development of a small transistorized computer to display basic navigation information, while [[Corning Incorporated|Corning]] was brought in to develop the super-flat glass plates needed to front the display.&lt;ref name=int11&gt;''Interview'', pg. 11&lt;/ref&gt; 

While development continued, Kaiser started looking for partners in the [[consumer electronic]]s space that might be able to help fund the effort of taking the tube into commercial production. At the time, the [[NTSC]] was in the process of introducing its [[color television]] standard and enormous amounts of funding were being spent on developing a wide array of technologies in the color market. Kaiser was unable to find anyone interested in developing another black and white system, and after the government contracts ran out, stopped funding development.&lt;ref name=int14&gt;''Interview'', pg. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lawsuit===
It was about this time that the similar tube developed by [[Dennis Gabor]] (better known as the developer of [[hologram]]s) first came to their attention. Gabor's design was similar in that it used an offset gun and deflection plates behind the [[phosphor]], but differed in having the [[electron gun]] arranged under the display area rather than to the side. Aiken had also filed similar patents after his early attempts. A patent battle followed, with Gabor eventually winning UK rights and Aiken U.S. rights. By this point active development of both had ended, and the two became friends.&lt;ref name=int14/&gt;

Aiken went on to develop a number of unrelated display technologies, similar to the [[flip-disc display]] eventually forming "Display Technology Corporation" to produce them.

==Description==
Aiken developed a number of different tube designs while working with Kaiser, a number of which were described in U.S. Patent 2,795,731.

The primary design used an [[electron gun]] arranged to the side of the screen, either firing horizontally across the top of the display tube, or firing vertically towards the top and then bent through 90 degrees to travel along the top. Across the top of the tube were a series of C-shaped plates and a matching set of parallel bars below it. The plates were charged relative to the bars to provide deflection, bending the beam to travel between the bars and down the face of the tube.

Behind the tube was a series of wide metal plates running horizontally along the back face of the display. These were used to bend the beam through an angle and cause it to hit the front face of the screen. 2D scanning was accomplished by charging two of the horizontal plates to select a vertical location on the display, and then quickly charging the deflection plates at the top in turn to select a horizontal location. Each vertical and horizontal plate addressed many locations on the screen, with the locations within each plate's area selected by charging it relative to its neighbors.

The patents describe a number of different systems for constructing the deflection plates, including both [[electrostatic]] and [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] circuits. Switching the plates on and off at high frequencies and high voltages is a major problem, even today, and a number of different systems were described to accomplish this, including an optical-mechanical system similar to the [[Nipkow disk]].

The second design, described in U.S. Patent 2,837,691, was similar to the first for vertical addressing, but used a conventional horizontal scanning system. The gun was moved to the lower middle of the display, firing upward, scanned horizontally by a single pair of deflection plates arranged just above the gun. Horizontal scanning is much faster than vertical, so this change greatly reduced the complexity of the driver electronics. At the top of the screen was a single wire charged to very high voltages, which bent the beam through 180 degrees back towards the bottom of the display. The vertical deflection plates were mounted on a plate arranged to lie between the path of the beam as it traveled upwards at the back of the tube and back down at the front.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16857">[[Image:LVS-Tracker-DTS.jpg|thumb|Digital avalanche transceiver with LED display]]
'''[[Avalanche]] transceivers''' or '''avalanche beacons''' are a class of active radio transceivers operating at 457&amp;nbsp;kHz and specialized for the purpose of finding people or equipment buried under [[snow]].  When the owner sets out on a skiing descent, the transceiver is activated, causing the device to emit a low-power pulsed transceiver signal during the trip.&lt;ref name=Mackido /&gt;  Following an avalanche, and if the holder of the transceiver is safe and has not themselves been caught by the avalanche, they may switch the transceiver from transmit into receive mode, allowing use as a [[radio direction finding]] device to search for signals coming from other skiers' transceiver who may be trapped.  A 457&amp;nbsp;kHz transceiver is an active device that requires batteries.  A [[ski suit]] may also contain a passive [[RECCO]] transponder sewn into the clothing.

Early avalanche transceivers transmitted at 2.275&amp;nbsp;kHz (2275 [[Hertz|Hz]]).&lt;ref name=wildsnow /&gt;  In 1986, the international frequency standard of 457&amp;nbsp;kHz was adopted, and this remains the standard today.&lt;ref name=ASTM /&gt;  Many companies manufacture transceivers that comply with this standard.

An avalanche transceiver is not considered a preventive measure against possible avalanche burial, but rather it is a way to reduce the amount of time buried.&lt;ref name=BCAresearch /&gt;

==History==
In 1968, Dr. John Lawton invented the first effective avalanche transceiver&lt;ref name=Alpenglow /&gt;  at [[Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory]] in [[Buffalo, New York]], with the first units being sold in 1971 under the “Skadi” brand name (from the mythological [[Skaði]]).&lt;ref name=Alpenglow /&gt; This unit, functioning at 2.275&amp;nbsp;kHz, converted the radio frequency to a simple tone audible to the human ear. By following the tone to where it was loudest, the transceiver operator could use it to locate the buried transceiver by using a grid searching technique.&lt;ref name=wildsnow /&gt;

In 1986, [[Internationale Kommisia fur Alpines Rettingwesen|IKAR]] adopted the frequency of 457&amp;nbsp;kHz. In 1996 [[ASTM]] adopted the 457&amp;nbsp;kHz standard.&lt;ref name=ASTM /&gt;

The following are the currently accepted international standards for Avalanche Transceivers operating on the 457&amp;nbsp;kHz frequency.&lt;ref name=Mackido /&gt;&lt;ref name=ASTM /&gt;&lt;ref name=ANSI /&gt;&lt;ref name=EUlaw /&gt;
* 457&amp;nbsp;kHz, frequency tolerance ±80&amp;nbsp;Hz
* 200 hours transmitting at +10C (assumed inside protective clothing)
* 1 hours receiving at −10C (assumed handheld)
* operation from −20C to +45C
* carrier keying (pulse period) 1000±300 ms

Now that the frequency 457&amp;nbsp;kHz had become an international standard, and the problems of range had been discussed and analyzed, everyone was most interested in ease of use.  With a new generation of entirely automatic apparatuses existing on the market containing a microprocessor that analyzed the beacon's signals or pulses to determine both the direction and distance of the victim, a new digital age was born. In 1997, the first digital beacon was introduced at the Winter Outdoor Retailer show by Backcountry Access under the brand name "Tracker".&lt;ref name=BCAresearch /&gt;  The Tracker DTS soon became the most widely used beacon in North America, and is still sold and used by many backcountry enthusiasts. Today, consumers have a wide range of choices for digital beacons from companies like Ortovox, Arva, Pieps, Mammut, and Backcountry Access. Although beacon technology is constantly evolving and improving, practicing and being familiar with your beacon remains the most important aspect for performing timely rescues and preventing avalanche fatalities.

==Types of beacons==
[[Image:LVS_Mammut_Barryvox.jpg|thumb|Digital avalanche transceiver with LCD display]]
There are two types of avalanche beacons: digital and analog. They both adhere to the international standard as described above, and only differ in the method(s) used to indicate to the user where the buried beacon is located. Most beacons currently being sold are digital, because of their enhanced ease of use and higher recovery rates.&lt;ref name=BCAresearch /&gt;

===Analog===
The original avalanche beacon was an analog beacon which transmitted the pulsed signal as an audible tone to the user. The tone gets louder when the user is closer to the transmitting beacon. These beacons have also been augmented with [[Light Emitting Diode|LEDs]] that provide a visual indication of signal strength, and earpieces to increase the ability of the listener to hear the tone.

===Digital===
Digital transceivers take the strength of the signal and the emitted dipole flux pattern and compute distance and direction to the buried transceiver.&lt;ref&gt;ISSW 2000&lt;/ref&gt; In order to calculate the emitted dipole flux pattern, a digital transceiver must have at least two antennas, although most modern transceivers have three. The digital beacons will then indicate the direction to the victim's beacon as an arrow on the display, and provide audio cues such as varying pitch or frequency. Most low- to mid-range beacons have a segmented arrow capable of pointing in five to eight forward directions only, displaying a 'U-Turn' indicator if the user is traveling away from the victim.&lt;ref name=BeaconReviews /&gt; Higher end beacons such as the Mammut® Pulse Barryvox and Arva® Link are equipped with a digital compass and free-flowing arrow, facilitating more exact direction finding, even rotating to maintain direction between pulses of the transmitting beacon (a feature that is impossible without a digital compass or sophisticated accelerometer). In addition, many higher end beacons can point to victims 360°, including behind the user if the user is moving in the wrong direction.&lt;ref name=BeaconReviews/&gt; Many digital beacons are also capable of being used in analog mode for more advanced rescuers, or to enhance reception range.

==W-Link==
Several high-end digital beacons are also equipped with a secondary "supplementary" frequency referred to as W-Link.&lt;ref name=BeaconReviews /&gt; This frequency broadcasts additional details to other transceivers capable of receiving the W-Link signal. Advertised brand-independent features of W-Link include:&lt;ref name=Arva /&gt;

* The ability to resolve multiple, complex burial situations by better differentiating individual transceivers
* More reliable estimation of the number of burials
* More reliable and quicker marking/unmarking of victims (i.e. forcing the transceiver to ignore an already found victim)
* More reliable selection of victim search, as the closest victim may not be the easiest to recover
* Ability to transmit and receive additional data including wearer's vital signs or identification&lt;ref name=Mammut /&gt;

===Vitals detection===
Beacons transmitting on the W-Link frequency send a specific device code to assist in isolating and pinpointing multiple signals, and facilitate all of the above features. Certain beacons like the Mammut® Pulse Barryvox also detect micro-movements in the user, including the minuscule movement generated by a heart beat. These beacons will transmit this information across the W-Link frequency, so that any user with another W-Link capable transceiver can determine whether or not a buried victim is alive, and formulate rescue [[triage]] based on that situation.&lt;ref name=Mammut /&gt;  The idea behind this is that if everyone in a group is wearing a vitals-capable W-Link transceiver and some group members are buried in an avalanche, the remaining group members will be able to determine which of the buried victims are still alive, and focus rescue efforts on those members.

To compensate for group members without vitals-capable beacons (including lower-end beacons without W-Link and W-Link capable beacons without vitals detection), the rescuer's W-Link beacon will often display two indicators on the display for each victim. One indicator shows that a victim's beacon is transmitting on the W-Link frequency while another shows that the victim is moving. This helps mitigate the potential risk of mis-categorizing an alive victim as dead because their beacon is not transmitting vitals data, and thus the rescuer does not see the "alive" indicator on their transceiver.

===Controversies of W-Link===

As a universal rule, W-Link capable transceivers do not display personally identifiable characteristics of the buried victims, although they are capable of doing this. This is to eliminate conflicts of interest in rescue situations where a rescuer may choose to save one person before (or instead of) another, even if another person is closer or easier to rescue. By not identifying any buried victims, the rescuer is not left with a decision of which person to save, and are spared the moral implications and consequences of his or her choices.&lt;ref name=ArvaLinkManual /&gt;  Critics of the W-Link system, especially of the vitals-detecting transceivers, argue that even without offering [[personally identifiable information]], the W-Link transceivers still present moral implications, and complicate rescue efforts because these transceivers will distinguish between W-Link capable and incapable victims with an indicator on the display, further segregating victims with a vitals-data capable beacons. Critics argue that this leads to an unfair distribution of rescue resources and personnel to persons with higher-end or newer transceivers, and deprives everyone of an equal chance for rescue. For this reason transceiver manufacturer Arva Equipment has elected to omit received vitals data from being displayed on their Link transceiver, although the beacon does transmit them.&lt;ref name=ArvaLinkManual /&gt;  A scenario that W-Link critics will use to exemplify their point is as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A four-person group goes on a backcountry tour into avalanche terrain. A husband and his wife are both equipped with the same W-Link, vitals-sensing transceiver. They just met the other two group members the day before. One of them has a basic digital beacon, and the other has a modern, digital W-Link beacon that does not transmit vitals data. Along their tour, three of the group members are caught in an avalanche, leaving only the husband to rescue them. He quickly activates his transceiver and it gets a lock on all three victims. The display shows two beacons 10 and 12 meters directly in front of him, one with W-Link signal and one with regular signal only. It also shows one beacon 33 meters behind him transmitting W-Link and vitals data saying the victim is alive.&lt;ref name=BeaconReviews /&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In this scenario, it is clear to distinguish between all three victims even though the transceiver does not display their names; his wife is 33 meters behind him, while the other two people he just met are much closer, and close together, as well. The moral implications are that the man will either choose to save his wife, likely at the expense of the other two group members' lives, or he will rescue one or both of the other group members, allowing his wife to die. In a rescue situation without the additional information, a competent rescuer would triage and initially rescue the two closer victims. If the husband chooses this path, he will have to live with the knowledge that he could have saved his wife but choose not to, for the rest of his life.

===Frequencies and technical information===

The W-Link frequency in use varies based on geographical location. Currently the frequencies are '''869.8&amp;nbsp;MHz in Region A''' and '''916-926&amp;nbsp;MHz in Region B.'''&lt;ref name=Mammut /&gt; Region A consists of the majority of the European Union, Sweden, Norway, Greenland, Iceland, and other countries in that vicinity. Region B consists of Canada and the United States. W-Link frequencies are not permitted for use in Russia, China, India, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and other various countries in Asia and Eastern Europe. Users may disable W-Link capabilities on their individual beacon when traveling to these countries, although switching between Regions B and A may require servicing by an authorized retailer.&lt;ref name=Mammut /&gt;

==Search techniques==
{{Main|Avalanche rescue}}
Due to the highly directional nature of the 457&amp;nbsp;kHz signal at the ranges common for avalanche burial (and the range specified in the standards), there have been many techniques developed to search for buried beacons. Good beacon search abilities are considered a required skill for recreational backcountry skiers, mountaineers as well as avalanche professionals such as ski guides, ski patrollers, search and rescue volunteers and professionals. Recreationalists and professionals alike take part in drills, practice and scenarios as a regular part of avalanche skills training.

The burial of a single beacon may involve search using one of several methods:&lt;ref name=searchmethods /&gt;
* Grid search
* Induction search
* Circle method

These search methods are adapted and extrapolated to scenarios where there is more than one burial.

[[File:Doppelschluessel.jpg|thumb|Berlin key]]
The '''Berlin key''' (also known as, German, ''Schließzwangschlüssel'', or, English, ''forced locking key'') is a [[key (lock)|key]] for a type of [[Mortise lock|door lock]]. It was designed to force people to close and lock their doors (usually a main entrance door or gate leading into a common yard or [[tenement]] block). Its particularity comes from the fact that it has two key blades (the part which activates the [[dead bolt|bolt]]), one at each end of the key, rather than the usual single blade. After unlocking the lock, the key must be pushed all the way through the lock and retrieved on the other side of the door after it has been closed and locked again. The mechanism makes the retrieval of the key impossible when the door is unlocked. Also, locking an open door is usually not possible.

Invented by the Berliner locksmith Johannes Schweiger,&lt;ref name="DerTagesspiegel"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ullmann|first=Petra|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/vor-fast-90-jahren-erfand-ein-weddinger-handwerker-den-durchsteckschluessel/128154.html|title=Vor fast 90 Jahren erfand ein Weddinger Handwerker den Durchsteckschlüssel|publisher=[[Der Tagesspiegel]]|date=8 March 2000|accessdate=19 August 2013|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Berlin key was massively produced by the Albert Kerfin &amp; Co company starting in 1912.&lt;ref name="MieterMagazin"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sethmann|first=Jens|url=http://www.berliner-mieterverein.de/magazin/online/mm1105/110519.htm|title=Der Siegeszug des Doppelschlüssels|publisher=MieterMagazin|date=November 2005|accessdate=19 August 2013|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the advent of more recent locking technologies, this kind of lock and key is becoming less common, but it can still be widely found in the [[tenement]] buildings of [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]. 

The key is subject of the book ''[[The Berlin Key]]'' by Science and Technology studies professor [[Bruno Latour]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1362">[[File:Bus holder circuit.svg|thumb|right|The two inverters form a delay that holds the previous state of the bus and drives it back through a resistor.]]
A '''bus-holder''' (or '''Bus-keeper''') is a weak latch [[Electronic circuit|circuit]] which holds last value on a [[tri-state logic|tri-state bus]].

The circuit is basically a delay element with the output connected back to the input through a relatively high impedance. This is usually achieved with two [[inverter (electrical)|inverters]] connected back to back. The resistor drives the bus weakly; therefore other circuits can override the value of the bus when they are not in tri-state mode.

Bus-holders are used to prevent CMOS gate inputs from getting floating values when they are connected to tri-stated nets. Otherwise both [[transistors]] in the gate could get turned on, thus shorting the power supply and ground, which would destroy the CMOS gate. This is prevented by the bus-holder pulling the input to the last valid logic level (0 or 1) on the net. The circuit is usually placed in parallel with the tri-stated net.

[[File:Kitchen-Modern-Can-Opener.jpg|thumb|300px|A modern opener with a combination of a rotating cutting wheel and a serrated wheel. This particular can opener is for left-handed use.]]
[[File:Dosenöffner.gif|thumb|Using a can opener]]
A '''can opener''' (in North American English and Australian English) or '''tin opener''' (in British and Commonwealth English) is a device used to open [[tin can]]s ([[metal]] cans). Although [[canning|preservation of food]] using tin cans had been practiced since at least 1772 in the Netherlands, the first can openers were not patented until 1855 in England and 1858 in the United States. These early openers were basically variations of a knife, though the 1855 design continues to be produced. The first can opener consisting of the now familiar sharp rotating cutting wheel was invented in 1870 but was considered too difficult to operate for the ordinary consumer. A breakthrough design came in 1925 when a second, serrated wheel was added to hold the cutting wheel on the ring of the can. This easy-to-use design has become one of the most popular can opener models.

Around the time of [[World War II]], several can openers were developed for military use, such as the American [[P-38 can opener|P-38]] and P-51. These featured a robust and compact design with a folding cutting blade and no handle. Electric can openers were introduced in the late 1950s and met with success. The development of new can opener types continues with the recent addition of a side-cutting model.

==Invention of cans==
[[File:Can opener.ogg|thumb|A can opener in action]]
[[File:Röda Clara - Sigvard Bernadotte.jpg|thumb|Can opener Röda Clara (Red Clara) Design by [[Sigvard Bernadotte]].]] 
Food preserved in tin cans was in use by the Dutch Navy from at least 1772.&lt;ref name=robertson&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NFRR6GayR74C&amp;pg=PA122|pages=122–123|title=Food packaging|author=Gordon L. Robertson|publisher=CRC Press|year=2006|isbn=0-8493-3775-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before 1800, there was already a small industry of canned [[salmon]] in the Netherlands. Freshly caught salmon were cleaned, boiled in [[brine]], smoked and placed in tin-plated iron boxes. This canned salmon was known outside the Netherlands, and in 1797 a British company supplied one of their clients with 13 cans. Preservation of food in tin cans was patented by [[Peter Durand]] in 1810. The patent was acquired in 1812 by [[Bryan Donkin]], who would later set up the world's first canning factory in London in 1813. By 1820, canned food was a recognized article in Britain and France and by 1822 in the United States.&lt;ref name="robertson"/&gt; The first cans were robust containers, which weighed more than the food they contained and required ingenuity to open, using whatever tools available. The instruction on those cans read "Cut round the top near the outer edge with a chisel and hammer."&lt;ref name=first&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.researchpod.co.uk/pdf/lifting_the_lid_on_the_tin_can_opener.pdf|title=Lifting the lid on the tin can opener|accessdate=8 August 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726191239/http://www.researchpod.co.uk/pdf/lifting_the_lid_on_the_tin_can_opener.pdf#|archive-date=26 July 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventions/canopener.htm|accessdate=8 August 2009|title=Can opener}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The gap of decades between the invention of the can and can opener may be attributed to the functionality of existing tools versus the cost and effort of a new tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ridely|first1=Matt|title=Don't Look for Inventions Before Their Time|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444100404577643723610334602|accessdate=8 April 2015|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First, lever-type can openers==
[[File:YatesOpener3.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Lever-type can opener design of 1855 by Robert Yeates]]
[[File:WarnerOpener.JPG|thumb|Lever-type can opener design of 1858 by Ezra Warner]]
[[File:BullOpener.png|thumb|Bull-head lever-type can opener of 1865]]

Dedicated can openers appeared in the 1850s and were of a primitive claw-shaped or "lever-type" design. In 1855, Robert Yeates, a cutlery and surgical instrument maker of Trafalgar Place West, Hackney Road, [[Middlesex]], UK, devised the first claw-ended can opener with a hand-operated tool that haggled its way around the top of metal cans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Kitchen History|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Group|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D7IhN7lempUC&amp;pg=PA143|isbn=978-1-57958-380-4|date=27 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1858, another lever-type opener of a more complex shape was patented in the United States by [[Ezra Warner (inventor)|Ezra Warner]] of [[Waterbury, Connecticut]]. It consisted of a sharp sickle, which was pushed into the can and sawed around its edge. A guard kept the sickle from penetrating too far into the can. The opener consisted of several parts which could be replaced if worn out, especially the sickle.&lt;ref&gt;Ezra J. Warner (5 January 1858) "Can opener" {{US patent|19063}}&lt;/ref&gt; This opener was adopted by the United States Army during the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865); however, its unprotected knife-like sickle was too dangerous for domestic use. A home-use opener named the "Bull's head opener" was designed in 1865 and was supplied with cans of pickled beef named "Bully beef". The opener was made of cast iron and had a very similar construction to the Yeates opener, but featured a more artistic shape and was the first move towards improving the look of the can opener. The bull-headed design was produced until the 1930s and was also offered with a fish-head shape.&lt;ref name=first/&gt;

==Rotating wheel openers==
[[File:BunkerOpener.JPG|thumb|The Bunker opener]]
[[File:LymanOpener.JPG|thumb|left|Rotary can opener of 1870 by William Lyman, side view]]
[[File:WheelOpener.png|thumb|left|Double-wheel design of 1925]]

The first rotating wheel can opener was patented in July 1870 by [[William Lyman (inventor)|William Lyman]] of [[Meriden, Connecticut]] and produced by the firm Baumgarten in the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;William W. Lyman "Improvement in can openers" {{US patent|105346}} 12 July 1870.&lt;/ref&gt; The can was to be pierced in its center with the sharp metal rod of the opener. Then, the length of the lever had to be adjusted to fit the can size, and the lever fixed with the wingnut. The top of the can was cut by pressing the cutting wheel into the can near the edge and rotating it along the can's rim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MlQ7NK9dw7IC&amp;pg=PA398|page=398|title=The history of science and technology|author=Bryan H. Bunch, Alexander Hellemans|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year=2004|isbn=0-618-22123-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The necessity to pierce the can first was a nuisance, and this can opener design did not survive. In 1925, the Star Can Opener Company of [[San Francisco, California]] had improved Lyman's design by adding a second, serrated wheel, called a "feed wheel", which allowed a firm grip of the can edge. This addition was so efficient that the design is still in use today.

Whereas all previous openers required using one hand or other means to hold the can, can-holding openers simultaneously grip the can and open it. The first such opener was patented in 1931 by the Bunker Clancey Company of Kansas City, Missouri and was, therefore, called the "Bunker". It featured the now standard pliers-type handles, when squeezed would tightly grip the can rim, while turning the key would rotate the cutting wheel, progressively cutting the lid along the rim.  The cutting wheel is coupled to a serrated feed wheel via a set of gears, as in the Star design.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Arthur Bunker, "Can opener", {{US patent|1838525}}, 29 December 1931.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bunker company was absorbed by the Rival Manufacturing Company, also of Kansas City, in 1938.&lt;ref name=first/&gt;

==Church key==
{{Main|Churchkey}}
[[File:Churchkey patent 1996550.jpg|thumb|Contemporary church key, three views.  The left end is a can piercer and the right end is a bottle cap lifter.]]
'''Church key''' initially referred to a simple hand-operated device for prying the cap (called a "[[crown cork]]" or "bottle cap") off a glass bottle; this kind of closure was invented in 1892.&lt;ref&gt;William Painter (2 February 1892) "Bottle sealing device" {{US patent|468258}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-chu2.htm Churchkey]. Worldwidewords.org (2 November 2002). Retrieved on 2013-03-20.&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these church key style openers was patented in Canada in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;Mario Theriault (2001) ''Great Maritime Inventions 1833–1950'', Goose Lane, p. 21 {{ISBN|0-86492-324-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shape and design of some of these openers did resemble a large simple key.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.just-for-openers.org/Church-Key.html January 1980 JFO Newsletter]. Just-for-openers.org. Retrieved on 20 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935, steel beer cans with flat tops appeared, and a device to pierce the lids was needed. The same opener was used for piercing those cans.  Made from a single piece of pressed metal, with a sharp point at one end, it was devised by D.&amp;nbsp;F. Sampson,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060511222412/http://www.bartenderschoolofsantarosa.com/usbgnewsletter/usbg_news_date_p8.shtml United States Bartenders Guild Newsletter]. bartenderschoolofsantarosa.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.streeter.org/community/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=468 Short History of the Beer Can (part 2)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720171523/http://www.streeter.org/community/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=468 |date=20 July 2011 }}.

For example, a "butterfly" opener is often a combination of the church key and a serrated-wheel opener.

[[File:Kitchen-Classic-Can-Opener.jpg|thumb|left|A modern butterfly opener combining a serrated wheel and a "church key".]]
There is sparse, and often contradictory, documentation on the origin of the term "church key". The phrase is likely an ironic euphemism, as the opener was obviously not designed to access churches. One explanation is that in [[Middle Ages|Medieval Europe]], most brewers were [[monks]].  [[Lager]] [[Basement#Cellar|cellars]] in the [[monasteries]] were locked to protect aging beers, and the monks carried keys to these lager cellars. It may have been those keys, which remotely resembled the early church key openers, that gave the "church key" opener its name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.wordorigins.org/index.php/church_key/|title=Historical Dictionary of American Slang|volume=1, A-G|editor=Jonathan Lighter|place=New York|publisher=Random House|year=1994|page=422}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another motive for assigning the device such an ironic name could have been the fact beer was first canned (for test marketing) in 1933,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rustycans.com/HISTORY/timeline.html Timeline: History of Beer Cans]. Rustycans.com. Retrieved on 20 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; the same year president [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] signed the [[Cullen-Harrison Bill]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090328030827/http://bcca.com/history/overview4.php Beer can history]. Brewery Collectibles Club of America&lt;/ref&gt; This act, which predated [[Repeal of Prohibition]], amended the [[Volstead Act]], making [[3.2% alcohol beer|3.2% low-alcohol beer]] legal. Some experts have posited the term "church key" was in mockery of the religious organizations which had supported [[Prohibition]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20070916082109/http://www.plateaupress.com.au/wfw/churckey.htm church key]. plateaupress.com.au&lt;/ref&gt;

Another key-type opener with completely different design was patented by J. Osterhoudt in 1866.&lt;ref&gt;J. Osterhoudt "Improved Method of Opening Tin Cans" {{US patent|58554}} 2 October 1866&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of piercing the can, it was used to tear off and roll up a pre-scored strip on the side of the can, just below the lid. It was also called "key", because of resemblance to a door key. Such openers are spot-welded or soldered to many small, thin-walled cans nowadays and are separated prior to use by prying the key up and bending it back and forth a few times until it breaks loose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blcan.htm|title=History of the Can: Can Opener|accessdate=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military use can openers==
{{Main|P-38 can opener}}
[[File:P-openers.jpg|thumb|P-51 and P-38 openers]]
Several can openers with a simple and robust design have been specifically developed for military use. The P-38 and P-51 are small can openers with a cutter hinged to the main body. They were also known as a "[[John Wayne]]" because the actor was shown in a training film opening a can of [[K-ration]]s. The P-38 can opener is [[keychain]]-sized, about 1.5&amp;nbsp;inches (38&amp;nbsp;mm) long, and consists of a short metal [[blade]] that serves as a handle (and can also be used as a [[screwdriver]]), with a small, hinged metal tooth that folds out to pierce the can lid. A notch just under the hinge point keeps the opener hooked around the rim of the can as the device is "walked" around the rim to cut the lid out. A larger version, called P-51, is somewhat easier to operate. P-38 was developed in 1942 and was issued in the canned [[field ration]]s of the [[United States Armed Forces]] from [[World War II]] to the 1980s. The P-38 and P-51 are cheaper to manufacture and are smaller and lighter to carry than most other can openers. The device can be easily attached to a [[keyring]] or [[Dog tag (identifier)|dog tag]] chain using the small punched hole.&lt;ref name = "Foster1995"&gt;{{cite news |author= R. Foster |title= The greatest Army invention ever |url= http://www.dogtagsrus.com/images/P38/p38newspaper.jpg |publisher= Pentagram (Army Public Affairs) (image of article at www.dogtagsrus.com)|date=18 August 1995|accessdate= 8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Official military designations for the P-38 include "US Army pocket can opener" and "Opener, can, hand, folding, type I". As with some other military terms (e.g., ''[[jeep]]''), the origin of the term is not known with certainty. The P-38 and P-51 openers share a designation with the [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning]] and [[North American P-51 Mustang]] fighters, however this is coincidental. The most likely origin of the name is much more pedestrian; the P-38 and P-51 measure {{convert|38|mm|abbr=on}} and {{convert|51|mm|abbr=on}} in length respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgia-outfitters.com/p3851milspecs.htm P-38 Engineering Drawing]. Georgia-outfitters.com. Retrieved on 20 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

P-38s are no longer used for individual rations by the United States Armed Forces, as canned C-rations were replaced by soft-pack [[Meal, Ready-to-Eat|MREs]] in the 1980s. They are, however, included with United States military "Tray Rations" (canned bulk meals). They are also still seen in disaster recovery efforts and have been handed out alongside canned food by rescue organizations, both in America and abroad in Afghanistan. The original US-contract P-38 can openers were manufactured by J. W. Speaker Corp. (stamped "US Speaker") and by Washburn Corp. (marked "US Androck"), they were later made by Mallin Hardware (now defunct) of [[Shelby, Ohio]] and were variously stamped "US Mallin Shelby O." or "U.S. Shelby Co."&lt;ref name=p38&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=8 August 2009|url=http://www.georgia-outfitters.com/page52.shtml|title=The P-38 can opener}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ADF Can Opener.jpg|thumb|Standard issue "FRED" can opener of the Australian Defence Force]]
A similar device that incorporates a small spoon at one end and a bottle opener at the other is currently employed by the [[Australian Defence Force]] and [[New Zealand Army]] in its ration kits. The [[Field Ration Eating Device]] is known by the acronym "FRED". It is also known as the "Fucking Ridiculous Eating Device".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Greame Hardiman|url = http://www.diggerhistory.info/pages-conflicts-periods/malaya-korea/malaya-2rar.htm| title = The Malayan Emergency. 2RAR 1956/57|work = 2RAR|publisher = Digger History: an unofficial history of the Australian &amp; New Zealand Armed Forces| accessdate = 5 November 2007 |quote = I remember the spoon come tin opener that was in later years nicknamed "Fred" (Fucking ridiculous eating device)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Black Berets|year = 2007|url = http://www.militarypeople.com.au/mainsite/content/view/175/50/|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100511034618/http://www.militarypeople.com.au/mainsite/content/view/175/50/|archivedate = 11 May 2010|work = Ration Pack|publisher = Australian Defence News &amp; Opinion – MilitaryPeople.com.au|accessdate=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another similar device was included with British Army "Operational Ration Pack, General Purpose" 24-hour ration pack and "Composite Ration Pack" rations. At one time they were manufactured by W. P. Warren Engineering Co., Ltd. The instructions printed on the miniature, greaseproof paper bag in which they were packed read: "Their design is similar, but not identical, to the P-38 and P-51 can openers."&lt;ref name=p38/&gt;

Most military ration can openers have a very simple design and have also been produced for civilian use in many countries. For example, small folding openers similar to the P-38 and P-51 were designed in 1924 and were widely distributed in the [[Eastern Europe]]an countries.&lt;ref name=schioniger&gt;K. F. Schioniger "Folding can opener" {{US patent|1507093}} 2 September 1924&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Slovenia]] a somewhat rounded version of a P-38 is known as "[[sardine]] can opener", because in the 1990s such openers were usually packed with cans that did not feature the pull-top pre-scored lid. A non-folding version of the P-38 used to be very common in [[Israel]]i kitchens, and can still be found in stores, often sold in packs of five.

==Electric openers==
[[File:Krups electric can opener.JPG|thumb|left|A modern [[Krups]] hand-held electric can opener]]
The first electric can opener was patented in 1931 and modeled after the cutting-wheel design.&lt;ref&gt;Preston C. West "Can opener" {{US patent|1834563}} 1 December 1931&lt;/ref&gt; Those openers were produced in the 1930s and advertised as capable of removing lids from more than 20 cans per minute without risk of injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7CcDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA18|page=18|title=Popular Science|year=1933|volume=123|issue=5|issn=0161-7370|publisher=Bonnier Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, they found little success. Electric openers were re-introduced in 1956 by two Californian companies. Klassen Enterprises of Centreville brought out a wall-mounted electric model,&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Klassen "Electrically operated can opener" {{US patent|2789345}} 26 March 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; but this complex design was unpopular too.&lt;ref name=first/&gt;

The same year, Walter Hess Bodle invented a freestanding device, combining an electric can opener and knife sharpener.&lt;ref&gt;Walter H. Bodle "Can opening and knife sharpening device" {{US patent|2897589}} 4 December 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; He and his family members built their prototype in his garage, with daughter Elizabeth sculpting the body design. It was manufactured under the "Udico" brand of the Union Die Casting Co. in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] and was offered in Flamingo Pink, Avocado Green, and Aqua Blue, popular colors of the era. These openers were introduced to the market for Christmas sales and found immediate success.&lt;ref name=first/&gt;

==Novel designs==
[[File:Sidecanopener.JPG|thumb|right|Side can opener]]
A new style of the can opener emerged in the 1980s. Whereas most other openers remove the lid by cutting down through the lid from the top just inside the rim, removing the top and leaving the rim attached to the can, these use a roller and cutting wheel to cut round the side of the can just below the rim, removing the top and rim. The can is left with a relatively safe, non-jagged  edge. The feed wheel teeth have a somewhat finer pitch than those of earlier designs and reside at the bottom of a V-shaped groove, which surrounds the rim on three sides at the point of action.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Porucznik, Keith Longstaff, "Can Openers" {{US patent|4782594}} 5 April 1984&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Kun-Jen Chang, "Side cutting can opener with a double grip" {{US patent|5946811}} 4 November 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==
[[Henry Kuttner]]'s 1943 short story "The Proud Robot" is about a fancy [[narcissism|narcissistic]] robot which turns out to be "a bigger and better opener" created by a drunk inventor,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mWtXZLCu2u8C&amp;pg=PP15 p. 15]&lt;/ref&gt; and is described by a reviewer as "the most beautiful can opener in the world".&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Pan, [http://www.legendsmagazine.net/111/scifi.htm Off The Shelf - "The World Treasury of Science Fiction"], a book review, ''[[Legends Magazine]]'', vol. 111, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15387">A '''colliery viewer''' or '''coal viewer''' was the manager of a [[:en:coal mine|coal mine]] or [[:en:colliery|colliery]].  The term was mostly used in the late eighteenth to nineteenth centuries, in the UK. In modern use, the viewer would be the senior and responsible [[mining engineer]] at a site.&lt;ref name="DMM, Occupations" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mackenzie, 1825" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Greenwell, 1849" /&gt;

The role began as a person to represent the owner of the land, often an aristocrat, who had leased the rights to mine there to another who would 'work' the mine.&lt;ref name="Century" /&gt; Land at this time was rarely sold, the aristocratic estates were intent on preserving themselves intact, and so mining rights would usually be in terms of a long-term lease. As both of these gentlemen were affluent, if not titled, they would not be familiar with mining themselves and would not generally wish to become so. As mines grew larger and more complex into the nineteenth century, the role of the viewer shifted to representing the safe technical management of the mine, on behalf of the owner. Later, as mine safety laws were passed, the viewer had a duty to represent the interests of the miners as well.

The viewer was usually employed by the owner, but in some cases was also the owner, or part-owner, themselves. The New Hartley Pit, of the [[:en:Hartley Colliery disaster|Hartley Colliery disaster]], was owned by the Carr brothers, where one brother acted as viewer.&lt;ref name="ILN, Hartley" /&gt;

An experienced viewer, known for their good judgement, was recognised as a skilled profession and in the North East they often became an independent contractor or consultant who would advise a number of mines on particular issues, such as sinking a new shaft, or making a new investment.&lt;ref name="Flinn" /&gt; This represented the shift from the viewer as manager or agent, to the development of the modern mining engineer.&lt;ref name="Gresley, 1883, Viewer" /&gt; Even at the time, the distinction between managers, or 'agents', for the day-to-day operation of collieries, and consultant viewers, who advised on the development of new aspects, was never a clear one.&lt;ref name="Flinn" /&gt;

The viewer would be responsible for deciding major expenditures, such as the purchase of a [[Newcomen engine|pumping engine]] or construction of a [[tramroad]] or railway. These new technical innovations were described in advisory guide books such as [[John Curr]]'s ''The Coal Viewer and Engine Builder's Practical Companion'' (1797).&lt;ref name="Curr, 1797" /&gt;

== Other roles ==
=== Overman ===
The overman is a deputy to the viewer and involved more directly with the daily work of the pit. When a colliery has a number of pits under a viewer, there is an overman to each pit. The overman has responsibilities for daily and hands-on tasks, such as inspecting the pit's safety each day and recording the work performed for [[:en:piece work|piece work]] systems.&lt;ref name="Mackenzie, 1825" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyle, 1892" /&gt;

An overman would be an experienced miner who has been promoted on the basis of experience.&lt;ref name="Greenwell, 1849, Overman" /&gt; {{efn-lr|"The old distich of the northern coalfield  'Trapper, Trimmer, Hewer, Under-Overman, and then Viewer' shows how common it has been for generations for a Northumbrian miner to work  up from the lowest to the highest grade of his vocation" said the Athenaeum in 1862.&lt;ref name="Pitmen" &gt;In a piece on 'The Pitmen and "The Drama of Hartley Colliery"' reprinted as {{cite news|title=The Pitmen of Durham and Northumberland|work=Durham County Advertiser|date=21 February 1862|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
A viewer in the early years, in contrast, would often be a 'gentleman' from a social class comparable to that of the [[:en:bourgeois|bourgeois]] owner. In later years, from the mid-19th century, it became more common for viewers to be skilled miners who had risen through the ranks.&lt;ref name="Pitmen" /&gt;

Wages in 1849 for an overman were 26 [[shilling]]s to 28s. per week.&lt;ref name="Greenwell, 1849, Overman" /&gt; This was twice that of other skilled trades, such as blacksmiths, indicative of the responsibility. As for most jobs, down to the lowliest colliers, a house and free [[small coal]] were also provided.{{efn-lr|This was often less generous than it might seem, as these [[tied house|tied cottage]]s were dependent on employment at the pit, and so anyone leaving employment would also make them and their family homeless.}}

There was a distinction in a colliery between 'day wagemen', those such as overmen and engine drivers, who were paid a daily or weekly wage and 'oncostmen',&lt;ref name="DMM, Occupations" /&gt; those such as coal cutters and loaders, who were paid according to a 'bargain', a form of [[piecework]]. The overman would keep the records of work done underground, so that on the Wednesday before a Friday payday he could 'reckon' with the men and agree the totals of work done.&lt;ref name="Boyle, 1892" /&gt;

The overman would also have regular roles underground,&lt;ref name="MI, 1894" /&gt; whereas the viewer would spend most of their time on the surface.

==== Back-overman ====
Pits in the 19th century worked a two shift system, with a morning or 'fore' shift (6am-2pm) and an afternoon or 'back' shift (2-10pm). Having an overman permanently on site was considered so important that a second deputy or 'back-overman' would work the second shift.&lt;ref name="DMM, Occupations" /&gt; Depending on pit conditions, the fore shift might concentrate on winning coal and the back shift on the 'dead work' of timbering and propping roadways etc.

=== Under-viewer ===
The viewer's role, particularly with the development of parliamentary mining regulations in the mid-nineteenth century, was ultimately that of responsibility. Although not necessarily owning the mine or being the engineer engaged to direct it technically, the viewer would be held responsible for any accident.

The under-viewer, under-looker or steward,&lt;ref name="Gresley, 1883, Viewer" /&gt; was a deputy to the viewer. As well as being an assistant to them, their main role was to act as a [[:en:locum|locum]] if the viewer is away from the colliery, and to ensure that the responsible person was always present.&lt;ref name="DMM, Occupations" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mackenzie, 1825" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Greenwell, 1849" /&gt;

=== Check-viewer ===

A viewer employed by the [[:en:lessor (leasing)|lessor]] to see that the provisions of the [[:en:lease|lease]] are duly observed.&lt;ref name="DMM, Occupations" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Greenwell, 1849" /&gt;

These provisions would include that the area being mined did not exceed the boundaries contracted for in the lease, that the amount of support left by [[:en:Room and pillar mining|stall and pillar]] working would be sufficient to avoid surface collapse, and sometimes also that surface waters were not polluted by run-off from mine drainage.

== Notable viewers ==
* [[William Brown (mining engineer)|William Brown]] (1717–1782) 
* [[:en:William Hedley|William Hedley]] (1779–1843) [[:en:Wylam Colliery|Wylam Colliery]], constructed ''[[Puffing Billy (locomotive)|Puffing Billy]]'', one of the first steam locomotives.
* [[:en:John Buddle|John Buddle]] (1773–1843), and his father, were both viewers at [[:en:Wallsend Colliery|Wallsend Colliery]]. Buddle became a successful businessman and the owner of several collieries. As a technical innovator he introduced the [[:en:Davy safety lamp|Davy safety lamp]] to pits in the North East and the ''[[:en:Steam Elephant|Steam Elephant]]'' locomotive for the [[Wallsend Waggonway]].
* Father of [[:en:William Hutton (1797–1860)|Dr William Hutton]], geologist (1797–1860)&lt;ref name="Smiles, Thrift, Hutton" /&gt;
* [[:en:Ralph Dodds|Ralph Dodds]], (1792–1874) viewer at [[:en:High Pit, Killingworth|High Pit]], who first employed [[George Stephenson]] as an engineer&lt;ref name="Smiles, Lives of the Engineers, Stephenson, 43" /&gt;
* [[Thomas Emerson Forster]] C.E. (1802-1875) "the well-known mining engineer",&lt;ref name="DGMobitTEForster"&gt;{{cite news|title=Death of Mr. T. E. Forster, Mining Engineer|work=Daily Gazette for Middlesbrough|date=9 March 1875|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also in the same newspaper obituary "the most successful viewer since the days of Mr Buddle. He has done more real work, and seen more seams of coal with his own eyes, than any other living follower of the art of mining engineering"&lt;ref name="DGMobitTEForster" /&gt; &lt;ref&gt; "The duties of a colliery viewer, in which Mr. Forster was so largely engaged, were such as none but the most vigorous and laborious men could execute. Sometimes at midnight, or at the early hours of two or three o'clock, he was subject to be called upon to travel many miles, to descend deep pits, to traverse underground works, and, not unfrequently, to penetrate into parts of a mine where nothing but the most careful judgment could preserve him from extreme risk of explosion or other accident. The commander, as it were, of many thousands of miners, he not only directed their labours, but gained their friendly confidence.


In the mine he was thoroughly at home. He affected only such habits and modes of speech as were perfectly understood by the pitman ; and to this peculiar tact his usefulness and success were in a great measure owing. In dealing with those of elevated rank, a respectful deference was never allowed to interfere with the most plain and freely spoken expression of opinion; and thus he maintained at all times a consistency of character, and a large amount of influence with all parties he met, or for whom he was concerned in professional business."  {{cite journal|url=http://www.dmm.org.uk/news18/8760817.htm

His son, George Baker Forster, also became a well-known mining engineer, but had first read Mathematics at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], and indeed rowed for them against [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] at [[Henley Royal Regatta|Henley]] {{cite journal|title=Obituaries: Mr. George Baker Forster|journal=The Minutes of Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers|volume=143|url=https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/George_Baker_Forster|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is one overman to a pit, so that if there are two or three pits at a colliery, there are two or three overmen.

In [[electronics]], a '''common-drain''' [[electronic amplifier|amplifier]], also known as a '''source follower''', is one of three basic single-stage [[field effect transistor]] (FET) amplifier topologies, typically used as a [[voltage]] [[buffer amplifier|buffer]]. In this circuit (NMOS) the gate terminal of the transistor serves as the input, the source is the output, and the drain is ''common'' to both (input and output), hence its name. The analogous [[bipolar junction transistor]] circuit is the [[common collector|common-collector amplifier]]. This circuit is also commonly called a "stabilizer."

In addition, this circuit is used to transform [[Electrical impedance|impedance]]s. For example, the [[Thevenin's theorem|Thévenin resistance]] of a combination of a voltage follower driven by a voltage source with high Thévenin resistance is reduced to only the output resistance of the voltage follower (a small resistance). That resistance reduction makes the combination a more ideal voltage source. Conversely, a voltage follower inserted between a driving stage and a high load (i.e. a low resistance) presents an infinite resistance (low load) to the driving stage—an advantage in coupling a voltage signal to a large load.

A '''conditioner''' (or ''hay conditioner'') is a [[Agricultural machinery|farm implement]] that crimps and crushes newly cut [[hay]] to promote faster and more even drying. Drying the hay efficiently is most important for first cutting of the hay crop, which consists of coarse stalks that take a longer period of time to draw out moisture than finer textured hays, such as second and subsequent cuttings.

A conditioner is made up of two grooved rollers which the hay is forced through, causing the stalks to split, thus allowing the liquid trapped behind [[cell wall]]s ([[sap]] and [[cell sap]]) to leak out and also giving more [[surface area]] for [[evaporation]]. The stand-alone conditioner is no longer used on most farms, since the conditioner has been incorporated into '''mower-conditioners''', which combine the [[mower]] and conditioner into a single machine. The names '''Haybine''' and '''Discbine''' are [[brand]] names of mower-conditioners, although some farmers [[generic trademark|use these names somewhat generically]].

==Mower-conditioners==
[[File:Krone mower with conditioner.jpg|thumb|Mower with conditioner]]
Mower-conditioners are a staple of large-scale hay making. Mower-conditioners are defined by the mechanisms that accomplish mowing and conditioning.

There are three types of [[mower]]s: sickle bar mowers, disc mowers, and drum mowers. Sickle bar mowers use a [[reciprocating]] blade to cut the grass and typically use a reel to fold the grass over the knife. Disc mowers have a number of hubs across the cutting width, each hub having a small (18") rotating disc with knives. Drum mowers use two or three large plates (called the drums, about 36" across) which ride over the ground as they are spinning. A sickle bar mower's main advantage over disc mowers and drum mowers is the reduced horsepower requirements. Its disadvantage is the extra maintenance required due to the high number of moving parts and wear items. Disc mowers were historically considered an "all the eggs in one basket" kind of mower because all the mower hubs were in one large gearbox. If one blade hit something and a gear tooth broke, the whole gearbox would suffer a catastrophic failure, and there would be nothing worth fixing. If anything broke, everything broke. Drum mowers prevented this by having typically two belt-driven drums compared to six or more gear-driven hubs. Modern disc mowers use isolated gearboxes, and if one fails it can be swapped out without rebuilding the entire machine.

Conditioners come in three main types: rubber-roller conditioners, steel-roller, and flail. The roller conditioners consist of two opposing rolls that have a raised, interlocking pattern. The rollers have either a rubber or steel pattern and a steel main shaft. The crop is crimped between the rollers, decreasing the drying time. The flail conditioner is an arrangement of steel V's on a main shaft that beat the crop against the top of the mower-conditioner. The flail conditioner reduces drying time by removing the waxy coating on the crop.

Even though conditioners can shorten the dry time of the hay, they can come with problems in the hayfield. The space between the two opposing rolls can decrease or increase by the users needs, but there is a max area of opening&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://messicks.com/nh/58098|title=New Holland (488) - HAYBINE MOWER CONDITIONER (7/77-) Parts Diagrams|website=messicks.com|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This can cause a break down or problem in the machine. If the hay is wet or lay downed in the field it can bunch together when pushed into the conditioner rolls. This can jam the rolls, even causing the hay to wrap completely around them. If caught early, the user can shut down the machine and cut the hay free by hand. If it is not caught early this can stop the bars from rolling, thus stopping the belts from turning the machine, then stopping the tractor. If this happens, one is looking at major problems with their machinery. Not only can this damage the rolls, but also the belts on the mower-conditioner can snap and the tractor itself will be receiving considerable amounts of stress on its engine. Even though this can be a major money and time consuming problem, if the user is alert and constantly aware of their equipment's performance, this issue should never go further than a small stoppage. 

''Haybine'' is the brand name of the first mower-conditioner.  It combined the sickle bar mower and the hay conditioner to promote faster drying hay all in one process. The current versions produced by [[New Holland Agriculture|New Holland]] are branded the ''Discbine,'' since they now feature faster disc mowers.

The '''Convention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives for the Purpose of Detection''' is a [[multilateral treaty|multilateral]] [[anti-terrorism legislation|anti-terrorism]] [[treaty]] that aims to prohibit and prevent the manufacture or storage of unmarked [[plastic explosive]]s.

==Content==
A state that ratifies the Convention agrees to prohibit the manufacture, storage, transport, or entry of unmarked plastic explosives in its territory. Plastic explosives are not prohibited by the treaty, but it mandates that when they are produced they are marked with a chemical [[taggant]] (specified in the treaty's Technical Annex) which can facilitate future identification purposes.

The Convention also establishes an International Explosives Technical Commission, which is composed of experts in the field explosives manufacturing and detection. The Commission can propose amendments to the Technical Annex of the treaty.

==Conclusion and ratifications==
The Convention was concluded at the [[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]] International Conference on Air Law in [[Montreal]] on 1 March 1991. It entered into force on 21 June 1998 after it had been ratified by 35 signatory states.

As of October 2018, the Convention has been ratified by 155 states, made up of 154 [[United Nations member states]] plus [[Niue]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1034">The '''Dornier DO-960''' was a [[hybrid computer]] designed for the [[Dornier Do 31]] experimental VTOL aircraft.

The hybrid approach was necessary because the computations for controlling [[VTOL]] were not feasible with digital computers available at that time. Vertical take-off requires solving complex differential equations in [[Real-time data|real-time]]. The DO-960 incorporates both [[digital computer]] and [[analog computer]] elements. The analog units are fit for solving computationally challenging differential equations, while the digital units are responsible for controlling the overall program flow. 

Although known primarily for aircraft, [[Dornier Flugzeugwerke|Dornier]] had been building analog and hybrid computers as soon as it started engineering vertical takeoff aircraft. The Dornier DO-960 was the last known hybrid computer of this series.

'''eBeam''' is an [[interactive whiteboard]] system developed by [[Luidia, Inc.]] that transforms any standard whiteboard or other surface into an interactive display and writing surface.

Luidia's eBeam hardware and software products allow text, images and video to be projected onto a variety of surfaces, where an interactive stylus or marker can be used to add notes, access control menus, manipulate images and create diagrams and drawings.&lt;ref&gt;“Put to the test: Luidia eBeam Edge,” Tech &amp; Learning (2009-06-22).&lt;/ref&gt; The presentations, notes and images can be saved and emailed to class or meeting participants, as well as shared in real time on local networks or over the Internet.

eBeam technology has been incorporated into other manufacturers' interactive whiteboard systems, such as the [[3M]] "Wall Display" / Digital Board, [[Hitachi Starboard]], Legamaster eBoard, and [[NEC]]'s WT615 short throw projection unit.

==Technology==
'''eBeam''' technology uses [[infrared]] and [[ultrasound]] receivers to track the location of a transmitter-equipped pen, called a stylus, or a standard dry-erase marker in a transmitter-equipped sleeve. A separate receiver unit attaches to the edge of the whiteboard, wall or other writing surface, and determines the distance and direction of the transmitter pen using the known quantities and differences of the [[speed of light]] and the [[speed of sound]].

Luidia's eBeam technology was originally developed and patented by engineers at Electronics for Imaging Inc. (Nasdaq: [http://quotes.nasdaq.com/asp/SummaryQuote.asp?symbol=EFII&amp;selected=EFII EFII]), a Foster City, Calif. developer of digital print server technology. Luidia was spun off&lt;ref&gt;“Luidia Launches,” San Jose Business Journal (2003-09-17)&lt;/ref&gt; from EFI in July 2003 with venture funding from Globespan Capital Partners and Silicom Ventures.

Since then, Luidia has continued to update and expand its eBeam product line, while adding numerous manufacturing partners, including Hitachi, NEC and Uchida.

==Products==

=== Safety Shower ===
[[File:Emergency eyewash and shower.jpg|thumb|Picture of Emergency eyewash and shower]]
A safety shower is a unit designed to wash an individual's [[head]] and [[Human body|body]] which has come into contact with hazardous [[Chemical substance|chemicals]]. Large volumes of water are used and a user may need to take off any clothing that has been contaminated with hazardous chemicals. Safety showers cannot be used for flushing our eyes, due to the high pressure of water from the shower, which can damage a user's eyes.
[[File:How to use Emergency Shower.ogg|thumb|How to use Emergency Shower.]]
[[File:How to use Emergency Showerr.ogg|thumb|How to use Emergency Shower..]]

=== Eyewash Station ===
An eyewash station is a unit for washing chemicals or substances that might splash into an individual's eyes before he or she can seek further medical attention. The user needs to wash their eyes for at least 5 minutes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:How to use an Emergency Eye wash.ogg|thumb|How to use Emergency Eye wash.]]

=== Drench Hose ===
A drench hose is an equipment that can spray water to a specific spot of the chemical exposure on individual's body. The benefit of a drench hose is that it can be applied to an individual who cannot reach a normal eyewash or shower station or in the case where the eyewash and shower station are unavailable.

=== Combination Unit ===
A combination unit is where other units such as a shower station, eyewash station, and drench hose share the same water supply plumbing. This unit is useful in laboratory where hazardous chemicals with different properties are used.

=== Eyewash Bottle ===
Also known as a personal eyewash unit, it is a supplementary for eyewash stations. However, eyewash stations cannot be replaced by eyewash bottles since they do not meet safety standards. Eyewash bottles allow an individual to flush the injured area immediately, or until the individual can reach the fixed eyewash station. Early eyewashes were designed with a single rinsing stream, but recent advancements have made eyewashes capable of flushing both eyes simultaneously. A pH neutral solution for emergency eyewash&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hawsco.com/index.php/downloads/dl/file/id/16290/product/0/squeeze_bottle_when_to_use_ph_neutral_vs_saline.pdf |title= PERSONAL EYEWASHES|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt;|date= |website= www.hawsco.com|publisher= hawsco|access-date=26 October 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; may also be chosen to reduce the danger from contaminants if strong acids or alkali chemicals are presented.

==Specification and requirement==
In the United States, [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) regulations on emergency eyewash and shower station are contained in 29 [[Code of Federal Regulations|C.F.R.]] 1910.151 (c), which provides that "Where the eyes or body of any person may be exposed to injurious corrosive materials, suitable facilities for quick drenching or flushing of the eyes and body shall be provided within the work area for immediate emergency use." However, OSHA regulation is unclear defining what facility is required. From this reason, American National Standards Institute (ANSI) has developed a standard (ANSI/ISEA Z358.1-2014) for emergency eyewash and shower stations, including the design of such stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gesafety.com/downloads/ANSIGuide.pdf|title=ANSI / ISEA Z358.1-2014 Compliance Checklist |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt;|date= 2014|website=www.gesafety.com|publisher= Guardian |access-date=26 October 2017 |quote=}}

[[File:ISO 7010 E012.svg|thumb|Sign for safety shower station]]

=== Safety Shower ===

'''Enhanced GPS''' (or '''E-GPS''', '''EGPS''', trademarked as eGPS) is a technology designed for mobile phones on [[GSM]] and [[W-CDMA]] [[Telecommunications network|networks]], to augment [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] signals to deliver faster location fixes, lower cost implementations and reduced power and processing requirements. It is being developed by [[CSR plc|CSR]] who has partnered with [[Motorola]] &amp;ndash; together they intend to create an open [[industry forum]].

According to CSR, EGPS delivers a "universal positioning capability that will not only work reliably indoors and in zero GPS signal conditions, but greatly speed time to fix in poor GPS reception areas where most handsets are used." More specifically, it can "exploit data available from the cellular network to speed GPS fixes and provide complementary, fast, and reliable location sensing when GPS signals are weak or unavailable." CSR is hoping to add eGPS capabilities to handsets for less than $1 per unit.

E-GPS combines CSR's "Matrix" technology with GPS &amp;ndash; when a user initiates a location request they get a Matrix location instantly using cell tower information, accurate to within 100m.  Then CSR's "Fine Time Aiding" helps the device know where to look for a GPS signal, to quickly acquire satellite information within seconds. Fine Time Aiding enables a more aggressive search and is claimed to be equivalent to 6 dB more sensitivity than can be achieved by any GPS hardware correlator in the terminal.

CSR claim that this enables software-only GPS solutions to operate reliably in all environments, and that eGPS is superior to [[Assisted GPS]]. EGPS technologies are due in 2008.

eGPS is much advanced than conventional GPS system provided with enhanced location search and integrated cellular connectivity.

The '''Fatigue Damage Spectrum''' (FDS) of a vibration is obtained by tracing the fatigue damage experienced by a linear Single [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|Degree of Freedom]] System (SDOF) according to its natural frequency, for given damping ratio and for a given value of parameter b (this parameter comes from the Basquin law representing the Wöhler curve of the material constituting the structure).

Regardless of the vibratory signal studied (sinusoidal vibration, shock, random or composite vibration); the FDS can be obtained directly from the time history signal. The method consists of :

*numerically calculating relative response displacement of the mass in relation to its support;
*establishing a peak histogram, giving the number ni of peaks according to their amplitude;
*using [[Miner’s damage accumulation law]].

In the case of stationary random vibration, the [[Spectral density|Power spectral density]] (PSD) of the vibration can be directly used for the FDS calculation.

==Note==

Vibrations can damage a mechanical system as a result of several processes, among which are:
*the exceeding of characteristic instantaneous stress limits (yield stress, ultimate stress etc.);
*the damage by fatigue following the application of a large number of cycles.

FDS is used according to the second criterion. The first criterion is considered with the ''[[Extreme response spectrum]]'' (ERS).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13818">'''Fluorescence interference contrast (FLIC) microscopy''' is a [[microscopy|microscopic]] technique developed to achieve z-resolution on the nanometer scale. 

FLIC occurs whenever [[fluorescent]] objects are in the vicinity of a reflecting surface (e.g. Si wafer). The resulting interference between the direct and the reflected light leads to a double sin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; modulation of the intensity, I, of a fluorescent object as a function of distance, h, above the reflecting surface. This allows for the ''nanometer height measurements''.

FLIC microscope is well suited to measuring the topography of a membrane that contains fluorescent
probes e.g. an artificial [[lipid bilayer]], or a living [[cell membrane]] or the structure of fluorescently labeled [[protein]]s on a surface.

==FLIC optical theory==
===General two layer system===
The optical theory underlying FLIC was developed by Armin Lambacher and Peter Fromherz.  They derived a relationship between the observed fluorescence [[intensity (physics)|intensity]] and the distance of the fluorophore from  a reflective [[silicon]] surface.

The observed fluorescence intensity, &lt;math&gt;I_{FLIC}&lt;/math&gt;, is the product of the excitation probability per unit time, &lt;math&gt;P_{ex}&lt;/math&gt;, and the probability of measuring an emitted photon per unit time, &lt;math&gt;P_{em}&lt;/math&gt;.  Both probabilities are a function of the fluorophore height above the silicon surface, so the observed intensity will also be a function of the fluorophore height.  The simplest arrangement to consider is a fluorophore embedded in silicon dioxide (refractive index &lt;math&gt;n_{1}&lt;/math&gt;) a distance ''d'' from an interface with silicon (refractive index &lt;math&gt;n_{0}&lt;/math&gt;).  The fluorophore is excited by light of wavelength &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{ex}&lt;/math&gt; and emits light of wavelength &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{em}&lt;/math&gt;.  The unit vector &lt;math&gt;''e_{ex}''&lt;/math&gt; gives the orientation of the transition [[dipole]] of excitation of the fluorophore.  &lt;math&gt;P_{ex}&lt;/math&gt; is proportional to the squared projection of the local [[electric field]], &lt;math&gt;F_{in}&lt;/math&gt;, which includes the effects of [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]], on the direction of the transition dipole. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;P_{ex}\propto  \mid F_{in}\cdot e_{ex}\mid^{2} &lt;/math&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;
The local electric field, &lt;math&gt;F_{in}&lt;/math&gt;, at the fluorophore is affected by interference between the direct incident light and the light reflecting off the silicon surface.  The interference is quantified by the phase difference &lt;math&gt;\Phi_{in}&lt;/math&gt; given by
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \Phi_{in} = \frac{4\pi n_{1}d\cos \theta^{in}_{1}}{\lambda_{ex}}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\theta^{in}_{1}&lt;/math&gt; is the angle of the incident light with respect to the silicon plane normal.  Not only does interference modulate &lt;math&gt;F_{in}&lt;/math&gt;, but the silicon surface does not perfectly reflect the incident light.   Fresnel coefficients give the change in amplitude between an incident and reflected wave.  The [[fresnel diffraction|Fresnel coefficients]] depend on the angles of incidence, &lt;math&gt;\theta_{i}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta_{j}&lt;/math&gt;, the [[index of refraction|indices of refraction]] of the two mediums and the [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] direction.  The angles &lt;math&gt;\theta_{i}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta_{j}&lt;/math&gt; can be related by [[Snell's Law]].  The expressions for the reflection coefficients are:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
r^{TE}_{ij} = \frac{n_{i}\cos \theta_{i} - n_{j}\cos \theta_{j}}{n_{i}\cos \theta_{i} + n_{j}\cos \theta_{j}}\quad r^{TM}_{ij} = \frac{n_{j}\cos \theta_{i} - n_{i}\cos \theta_{j}}{n_{j}\cos \theta_{i} + n_{i}\cos \theta_{j}}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
TE refers to the component of the electric field perpendicular to the plane of incidence and TM to the parallel component (The incident plane is defined by the plane normal and the propagation direction of the light).  In [[cartesian coordinate system|cartesian]] coordinates, the local electric field is 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;F_{in} = \sin \gamma_{in} \left[\begin{array}{c}0 \\1 + r^{TE}_{10}\textit{e}^{ i\Phi_{in}} \\0\end{array}\right] + \cos \gamma _{in} \left[\begin{array}{c}\cos \theta ^{in}_{1}(1-r^{TM}_{10}\textit{e}^{i\Phi_{in}}) \\0 \\ \sin \theta ^{in}_{1}(1+r^{TM}_{10}\textit{e}^{i\Phi_{in}})\end{array}\right]
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\gamma_{in}&lt;/math&gt; is the polarization angle of the incident light with respect to the plane of incidence.  The orientation of the excitation dipole is a function of its angle &lt;math&gt;\theta_{ex}&lt;/math&gt; to the normal and &lt;math&gt;\phi_{ex}&lt;/math&gt; azimuthal to the plane of incidence.  
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\textit{e}_{ex} = \left[\begin{array}{c}\cos \phi_{ex}\sin \theta_{ex}\\\sin \phi_{ex}\sin \theta_{ex} \\\cos \theta_{ex}\end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The above two equations for &lt;math&gt;F_{in}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textit{e}_{ex}&lt;/math&gt; can be combined to give the probability of exciting the fluorophore per unit time &lt;math&gt;P_{ex}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Many of the parameters used above would vary in a normal experiment.  The variation in the five following parameters should be included in this theoretical description.
* The [[coherence (physics)|coherence]] of the excitation light 
* The incident angle (&lt;math&gt;\theta^{in}_{1}&lt;/math&gt;) of excitation light 
* Polarization angle (&lt;math&gt;\gamma_{in}&lt;/math&gt;) of the excitation light 
* The angle of transition dipole (&lt;math&gt;\theta_{ex}&lt;/math&gt;) of the fluorophore  
* The wavelength of the excitation light (&lt;math&gt;\lambda_{ex}&lt;/math&gt;)
The squared projection &lt;math&gt;\mid F_{in}\cdot e_{ex}\mid^{2}&lt;/math&gt; must be averaged over these quantities to give the probability of excitation &lt;math&gt;P_{ex}&lt;/math&gt;.  Averaging over the first 4 parameters gives
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt;
&lt;\mid F_{in}\cdot e_{ex}\mid^{2}&gt; \propto \int \sin \theta_{1}^{in}d\theta_{1}^{in}A_{in}(\theta_{1}^{in}) \times \int \sin \theta_{ex}d\theta_{ex}O(\theta_{ex})U_{ex}(\lambda_{in},\theta_{1}^{in}.\theta_{ex})&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt; U_{ex} = \sin^{2}\theta_{ex}\mid 1+r^{TE}_{10}\textit{e}^{i\Phi_{in}}\mid^{2} + \sin^{2}\theta_{ex}\cos^{2}\theta^{in}_{1}\mid 1-r^{TM}_{10}\textit{e}^{i\Phi_{in}}\mid^{2}+2\cos^{2}\theta_{ex}\sin^{2}\theta^{in}_{1}\mid 1+r^{TM}_{10}\textit{e}^{i\Phi_{in}}\mid^{2}
&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:FLIC intensity plot.png|thumb|Example of a FLIC intensity plot showing the relative fluorescence intensity measured versus the distance of the fluorophore from the reflective surface. The peaks might not be the same height in a real experimental plot]]
Normalization factors are not included.  &lt;math&gt;O(\theta_{ex})&lt;/math&gt; is a distribution of the orientation angle of the fluorophore dipoles.  The [[polar coordinate system|azimuthal]] angle &lt;math&gt;\phi_{ex}&lt;/math&gt; and the polarization angle &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{in}&lt;/math&gt; are integrated over analytically, so they no longer appear in the above equation.  To finally obtain the probability of excitation per unit time, the above equation is integrated over the spread in excitation wavelength, accounting for the intensity &lt;math&gt;I(\lambda_{ex})&lt;/math&gt; and the extinction coefficient of the fluorophore &lt;math&gt;\epsilon(\lambda_{ex})&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt;
P_{ex}\propto \int d\lambda_{ex}I(\lambda_{ex})\epsilon(\lambda_{ex})&lt;\mid F_{in}\cdot e_{ex}\mid^{2}&gt;
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The steps to calculate &lt;math&gt;P_{em}&lt;/math&gt; are equivalent to those above in calculating &lt;math&gt;P_{ex}&lt;/math&gt; except that the parameter labels ''em'' are replaced with ''ex'' and ''in'' is replaced with ''out''.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
P_{em}\propto \int d\lambda_{em}\Phi_{det}(\lambda_{em})\textit{f}(\lambda_{em})&lt;\mid F_{in}\cdot e_{ex}\mid^{2}&gt;
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The resulting fluorescence intensity measured is proportional to the product of the excitation probability and emission probability

&lt;math&gt;
I_{FLIC} \propto P_{ex}P_{em}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It is important to note that this theory determines a proportionality relation between the measured fluorescence intensity &lt;math&gt;I_{FLIC}&lt;/math&gt; and the distance of the fluorophore above the reflective surface.  The fact that it is not an equality relation will have a significant effect on the experimental procedure.

==Experimental Setup==
A silicon wafer is typically used as the reflective surface in a FLIC experiment.  An [[silicon dioxide|oxide]] layer is then thermally grown on top of the silicon wafer to act as a spacer.  On top of the oxide is placed the fluorescently labeled specimen, such as a lipid membrane, a cell or membrane bound proteins.   
With the sample system built, all that is needed is an epifluorescence microscope and a [[charge-coupled device|CCD]] camera to make quantitative intensity measurements.  

[[Image:FLIC bilayer.jpg|thumb|This is a diagram of an example FLIC experimental setup with silicon, three oxide layers and a fluorescently labeled lipid bilayer (the yellow stars represent fluorophores.]]
The silicon dioxide thickness is very important in making accurate FLIC measurements.  As mentioned before, the theoretical model describes the ''relative'' fluorescence intensity measured versus the fluorophore height.  The fluorophore position cannot be simply read off of a single measured FLIC curve.    The basic procedure is to manufacture the oxide layer with at least two known thicknesses (the layer can be made with [[photolithography|photolithographic]] techniques and the thickness measured by [[ellipsometry]]).  The thicknesses used depends on the sample being measured.  For a sample with fluorophore height in the range of 10&amp;nbsp;nm, oxide thickness around 50&amp;nbsp;nm would be best because the FLIC intensity curve is steepest here and would produce the greatest contrast between fluorophore heights.  Oxide thickness above a few hundred nanometers could be problematic because the curve begins to get smeared out by polychromatic light and a range of incident angles.  A ratio of measured fluorescence intensities at different oxide thicknesses is compared to the predicted ratio to calculate the fluorophore height above the oxide (&lt;math&gt;d_{\textit{f}},&lt;/math&gt;).  
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\frac{I_{theory}(d_{1})}{I_{theory}(d_{0})}=\frac{I_{exp}(d_{1}+d_{\textit{f}})}{I_{exp}(d_{0}+d_{\textit{f}})}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The above equation can then be solved numerically to find &lt;math&gt;d_{\textit{f}}&lt;/math&gt;.
Imperfections of the experiment, such as imperfect reflection, nonnormal incidence of light and polychromatic light tend to smear out the sharp fluorescence curves.  The spread in incidence angle can be controlled by the [[numerical aperture]] (N.A.).  However, depending on the numerical aperture used, the experiment will yield good lateral [[optical resolution|resolution]] (x-y) or good vertical resolution (z), but not both.  A high N.A. (~1.0) gives good lateral resolution which is best if the goal is to determine long range topography.  Low N.A. (~0.001), on the other hand, provides accurate z-height measurement to determine the height of a fluorescently labeled molecule in a system.
===Analysis===
[[Image:FLIC experimental data.jpg|thumb|Example of experimental data collected for a fluorescently labeled sample over 16 oxide thicknesses. Fitting the curve to the 16 data points would give the height of the fluorophores above the oxide surface.]]
The basic analysis involves [[curve fitting|fitting]] the intensity data with the theoretical model allowing the distance of the fluorophore above the oxide surface (&lt;math&gt;d_{\textit{f}}&lt;/math&gt;) to be a free parameter.
The FLIC curves shift to the left as the distance of the fluorophore above the oxide increases.  &lt;math&gt;d_{\textit{f}}&lt;/math&gt; is usually the parameter of interest, but several other free parameters are often included to optimize the fit.  Normally an amplitude factor (a) and a constant additive term for the background (b) are included.  The amplitude factor scales the relative model intensity and the constant background shifts the curve up or down to account for fluorescence coming from out of focus areas, such as the top side of a cell.  Occasionally the numerical aperture (N.A.) of the microscope is allowed to be a free parameter in the fitting.  The other parameters entering the optical theory, such as different indices of refraction, layer thicknesses and light wavelengths, are assumed constant with some uncertainty.
A FLIC chip may be made with oxide terraces of 9 or  16 different heights arranged in blocks.  After a fluorescence image is captured, each 9 or 16 terrace block yields a separate FLIC curve that defines a unique &lt;math&gt;d_{\textit{f}}&lt;/math&gt;.  The average &lt;math&gt;d_{\textit{f}}&lt;/math&gt; is found by compiling all the &lt;math&gt;d_{\textit{f}}&lt;/math&gt; values into a histogram.
&lt;br /&gt;
The [[statistical error]] in the calculation of &lt;math&gt;d_{\textit{f}}&lt;/math&gt; comes from two sources: the error in fitting of the optical theory to the data and the uncertainty in the thickness of the oxide layer.  [[Systematic error]] comes from three sources: the measurement of the oxide thickness (usually by ellipsometer), the fluorescence intensity measurement with the CCD, and the uncertainty in the parameters used in the optical theory.  The systematic error has been estimated to be &lt;math&gt;\sim 1 nm&lt;/math&gt;.

In [[cooking]], a '''gas stove''' is a [[Kitchen stove|cooker/stove]] which uses [[syngas]], [[natural gas]], [[propane]], [[butane]], [[liquefied petroleum gas]] or other [[Flammability|flammable]] [[gas]] as a [[fuel]] source. Prior to the advent of gas, cooking stoves relied on solid fuel such as coal or wood. The first gas stoves were developed in the 1820s, and a gas stove factory was established in England in 1836. This new cooking technology had the advantage that it was easily adjustable and could be turned off when not in use. However the gas stove did not become a commercial success until the 1880s, by which time a supply of piped gas was available in large towns in Britain. The stoves became widespread on the [[Continental Europe|European Continent]] and in the [[United States]] in the early 20th century.

Gas stoves became less unwieldy when the oven was integrated into the base and the size was reduced to fit in better with the rest of the kitchen furniture. By the 1910s, producers started to enamel their gas stoves for easier cleaning. Ignition of the gas was originally by match and this was followed by the more convenient [[pilot light]]. This had the disadvantage of a continual consumption of gas. The oven still needed to be lit by match, and accidentally turning on the gas without igniting it could lead to an explosion. To prevent these types of accidents, oven manufacturers developed and installed a safety valve called a [[Flame supervision device |flame failure device]] for gas [[cooktop|hobs (cooktops)]] and ovens. Most modern gas stoves have electronic ignition, automatic timers for the oven and [[Exhaust hood|extractor hood]]s to remove fumes.

== History ==
[[File:Gas stove 1851.jpg|thumb|right|250x250px|Early gas stoves produced by Windsor. From ''[[Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management]]'', 1904.]]
The first gas stove was developed in 1802 by Zachäus Winzler ([[:de:Zachäus Andreas Winzler|de]]), but this along with other attempts remained isolated experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ROL_MPNKtzoC&amp;pg=PT43&amp;lpg=PT43&amp;dq=Zachaus+Winzler&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MJ53Ne4Cww&amp;sig=LGYxQuRzt8_P9e4WorHrhkHBijk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjA3KLg9rrQAhXKCsAKHUP_CG8Q6AEIWjAO#v=onepage&amp;q=Zachaus+Winzler&amp;f=false|title=Relish: The Extraordinary Life of Alexis Soyer, Victorian Celebrity Chef|first=Ruth|last=Cowen|date=16 December 2010|publisher=Orion|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; James Sharp patented a gas stove in [[Northampton, England]] in 1826 and opened a gas stove factory in 1836. His invention was marketed by the firm Smith &amp; Philips from 1828. An important figure in the early acceptance of this new technology, was [[Alexis Soyer]], the renowned chef at the [[Reform Club]] in London. From 1841, he converted his kitchen to consume piped gas, arguing that gas was cheaper overall because the supply could be turned off when the stove was not in use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SJGNAgAAQBAJ|title=Encyclopedia of Kitchen History|author=Mary Ellen Snodgrass|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|page=428}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A gas stove was shown at the [[World Fair]] in [[London]] in 1851, but it was only in the 1880s that the technology became a commercial success in England. By that stage a large and reliable network for gas [[pipeline transport]] had spread over much of the country, making gas relatively cheap and efficient for domestic use. Gas stoves only became widespread on the [[Continental Europe|European Continent]] and in the United States in the early 20th century.

Early gas stoves were rather unwieldy, but soon the oven was integrated into the base and the size was reduced to fit in better with the rest of the kitchen furniture. In the 1910s, producers started to enamel their gas stoves for easier cleaning.

== Ignition ==
{{refimprove|date=September 2014}}
[[File:Gas stove ignition spark.JPG|220px|thumb|Electric ignition spark]]
Gas stoves today use two basic types of ignition sources, standing pilot and electric. A stove with a standing pilot has a small, continuously burning gas flame (called a [[pilot light]]) under the [[kitchen stove|cooktop]]. The flame is between the front and back burners. When the stove is turned on, this flame lights the gas flowing out of the burners. The advantage of the standing pilot system is that it is simple and completely independent of any outside power source. A minor drawback is that the flames continuously consume fuel even when the stove is not in use. Early gas ovens did not have a pilot. One had to light these manually with a match. If one accidentally left the gas on, gas would fill the oven and eventually the room. A small spark, such as an arc from a light switch being turned on, could ignite the gas, triggering a violent explosion. To prevent these types of accidents, oven manufacturers developed and installed a safety valve called a [[flame failure device]] for gas [[kitchen stove|hobs (cooktops)]] and ovens. The safety valve depends on a thermocouple that sends a signal to the valve to stay open. Although most modern gas stoves have electronic ignition, many households have gas cooking ranges and ovens that need to be lit with a flame. Electric ignition stoves use electric sparks to ignite the surface burners. This is the "clicking sound" audible just before the burner actually lights. The sparks are initiated by turning the gas burner knob to a position typically labeled "LITE" or by pressing the 'ignition' button. Once the burner lights, the knob is turned further to modulate the flame size. [[Auto reignition]] is an elegant refinement: the user need not know or understand the wait-then-turn sequence. They simply turn the burner knob to the desired flame size and the sparking is turned off automatically when the flame lights. Auto reignition also provides a safety feature: the flame will be automatically reignited if the flame goes out while the gas is still on—for example by a gust of wind. If the power fails, surface burners must be manually match-lit.

Electric ignition for ovens uses a "hot surface" or "glow bar" ignitor. Basically it is a heating element that heats up to gas's ignition temperature. A sensor detects when the glow bar is hot enough and opens the gas valve.

Also stoves with electric ignition must be connected with gas protection mechanisms such as gas control breaker. Because of this many manufactureres supply stoves without electricity plug.

'''IT energy management''' or Green IT as per International Federation of Global &amp; Green ICT "IFGICT" is the analysis and management of [[Energy consumption|energy demand]] within the [[Information Technology]] department in any organization.  IT energy demand accounts for approximately 2% of global {{CO2}} emissions, approximately the same level as aviation,&lt;ref&gt;Gartner Press Release April 26, 2007, Gartner Estimates ICT Industry Accounts for 2 Percent of Global CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Emissions http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=503867&lt;/ref&gt; and represents over 10% of all the global energy consumption (over 50% of aviation's energy consumption).&lt;ref&gt;MILLS, Mark P. The cloud begins with coal. Digital Power Group. Online at: http://www.tech-pundit.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Cloud_Begins_With_Coal.pdf, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; IT can account for 25% of a modern office building’s energy cost.&lt;ref&gt;Gartner Inc., “IT Vendors, Service Providers and Users Can lighten IT’s Environmental footpint” Simon Mingay, December 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

At one point, the main sources of manageable IT energy demand were PCs and Monitors, accounting for 39% of energy use, followed by data centers and servers, accounting for 23% of energy use.&lt;ref name="Steve Kleynhans PC"&gt;Steve Kleynhans, VP Computing, Gartner presentation “the Green PC Environment” - presentation, New York, November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, US IT infrastructures consumed an estimated 61 billion kWh of energy, totaling to a cost of $4.5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1007.0066|title=A Taxonomy and Survey of Energy-Efficient Data Centers and Cloud Computing Systems|last=Beloglazov|first=Anton|date=|work=|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|last2=Buyya|first2=Rajkumar|format=PDF|last3=Choon Lee|first3=Young|last4=Zomaya|first4=Albert}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significant opportunities exist for Enterprises to optimise their IT energy usage.&lt;ref&gt;E. Curry, B. Guyon, C. Sheridan, and B. Donnellan, [http://www.edwardcurry.org/publications/MISQE_SustainableIT_Intel_2012.pdf “Developing an Sustainable IT Capability: Lessons From Intel’s Journey,”] MIS Quarterly Executive, vol. 11, no. 2, pp. 61–74, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Computers, data centers and networks consume 10% of the world’s electricity. 30% of this electricity goes to power terminal equipment (computers, mobiles and other devices), 30% goes to data centers and 40% goes to the network. A router consumes 10&amp;nbsp;kW and a large data center consumes nearly 100MW.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.cnrs.fr/articles/new-technologies-wasted-energies|title=New Technologies' Wasted Energies|website=CNRS News|language=en|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data centers can consume up to 100 times more energy &lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://energy.gov/eere/femp/data-center-energy-consumption-trends | title=Data Center Energy Consumption Trends}}&lt;/ref&gt; than a standard office building. Often, less than 15% of original source energy is used for the information technology equipment within a data center. With the introduction of new technologies and products, energy management  of several IT equipments has been greatly improved.

==Server and data center power management==
{{main|Data center environmental control}}
Servers and data centers account for 23% of IT energy demand.&lt;ref name="Steve Kleynhans PC"/&gt; As hardware becomes smaller and less expensive, energy costs constitute a larger portion of server or data center costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Power Provisioning for a Warehouse-sized Computer|journal=Proceedings of the ACM International Symposium on Computer Architecture, San Diego, CA, | date = June 2007| url=http://www.seamicro.com/sites/default/files/Power%20Provisioning%20for%20a%20Warehouse-sized%20Computer.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These allow gains to be made through optimisation of servers.  This is typically done by doing diagnostic tests on individual servers and developing a model for a data center’s energy demand using these measurements. By analysing every server in a data centre, server power management software can identify servers that can be removed.  It also enables servers to be virtualized, processes to be consolidated to a smaller number of servers, and servers with a predictable cyclical power demand to be fully powered down when not in use.  Active power management features are also included which put remaining servers into their lowest power state that allows instant wake-up on demand when required.

Energy efficiency benchmarks, such as [[SPECpower]], or specifications, like [[Average CPU power]], can be used for comparing server efficiency and [[performance per watt]].

== PC power management ==

A research study shows that in the US, 50% of PCs are left on overnight, resulting in an estimated annual energy waste of 28.8 billion kWh, and a cost of $2.8 billion per year.  User behaviour is slightly different in Europe, with approximately 28% of  PCs being left on overnight in the UK, resulting in an estimated energy loss of 2.5 billion kWh, costing £300 million per year.  In Germany, with approximately 30% of PCs left on overnight, it is estimated 4.8 billion kWh of energy are wasted each year, costing €919 million&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=PC Energy Report 2009, United States, United Kingdom, Germany |publisher=[[Alliance to Save Energy]] &amp; 1E |date=March 2009 |url=http://www.climatesaverscomputing.org/docs/1E_PC_Energy_Report_2009_US.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224153324/http://www.climatesaverscomputing.org/docs/1E_PC_Energy_Report_2009_US.pdf |archivedate=2012-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a significant market in third-party [[Comparison of Power Management Software Suites|Power Management Software]] offering features beyond those present in the Windows operating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.windowsitpro.com/article/buyers-guide/Power-Management-Software-for-Windows-Workstations-Buyers-Guide.aspx|title=Power Management Software for Windows Workstations}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=power_mgt.pr_power_mgt_comm_packages|title=Energy Star Commercial Packages List}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hmcsustainability.org.uk/energy.html|author=The Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference|title=HMC: A Practical Guide to Sustainable Building for Schools}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most products offer [[Active Directory]] integration and per-user/per-machine settings with the more advanced offering multiple power plans, scheduled power plans, anti-insomnia features and enterprise power usage reporting.

==Energy Efficient Ethernet==
{{main|Energy Efficient Ethernet}}

Energy Efficient Ethernet (IEEE 802.3az) could reduce the energy use of networking equipment.  In 2005, all the network-interface controllers in the United States (in computers, switches, and routers) used an estimated 5.3 terawatt-hours of electricity.&lt;ref name=IEEESpectrum&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/networks/energyefficient-ethernet |title=IEEE Spectrum: Energy-Efficient Ethernet |publisher=Spectrum.ieee.org |date= |accessdate=2010-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a researcher at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, Energy Efficient Ethernet could save an estimated $450 million a year in energy costs in the U.S.&lt;ref name=EETimes&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eetimes.com/news/latest/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=207601205 |title=Energy-efficient Ethernet standard gains traction |publisher=EETimes.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; With most of the savings from home computers ($200 million), and offices ($170 million), and the remaining $80 million from data centers.&lt;ref name=EETimes/&gt;  Energy efficient Ethernet saves energy by allowing network links to either go into a low power sleep mode or run at a slower rate when there is no data.  It also defines lower power signaling for use on higher quality cables.

== Organisations and resources for IT energy management ==
There are a number of industry associations and policy organisations whose work on promoting energy efficiency includes providing resources and information on IT energy management.  These include:
* [[The Green Grid]]
* [[Alliance to Save Energy]]
* [[Climate Savers Computing Initiative]]
* [[2Degrees]] (Low Carbon ITC Network)

This article discusses moving image capture, transmission and presentation from today's technical and creative points of view; concentrating on aspects of frame rates.

== Essential parameters ==
The essential parameters of any moving image sequence as a visual presentation are: presence or absence of [[colour]], [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]], [[Image resolution|resolution]] and image change rate.

=== Image change rate ===
There are several standard image-change rates (or frame rates) used today: 24&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]], 25&amp;nbsp;Hz, 30&amp;nbsp;Hz, 50&amp;nbsp;Hz, and 60&amp;nbsp;Hz. Technical details related to the backward-compatible addition of color to the [[NTSC]] signal caused other variants to appear: 24000/1001&amp;nbsp;Hz, 30000/1001&amp;nbsp;Hz, and 60000/1001&amp;nbsp;Hz.

The image change rate fundamentally affects how "fluid" the motion it captures will look on the screen. Moving image material, based on this, is sometimes divided into two groups: ''film-based'' material, where the image of the scene is captured by camera 24 times a second (24&amp;nbsp;Hz), and ''video-based'' material, where the image is captured roughly 50 or 60 times a second.

The roughly 50 and 60&amp;nbsp;Hz material captures motion very well, and it looks very fluid on the screen. In principle, the 24&amp;nbsp;Hz material conveys motion satisfactorily; but, because it is usually displayed at least twice the capture rate in cinema and on CRT TV (to avoid flicker), it is not considered capable of transmitting "fluid" motion. Nevertheless, it still is used to film movies, because of the unique artistic impression arising exactly from the slow image-change rate.

25&amp;nbsp;Hz material, for all practical purposes, looks and feels the same as 24&amp;nbsp;Hz material. 30&amp;nbsp;Hz material is in the middle, between 24 and 50&amp;nbsp;Hz material, in terms of "fluidity" of the motion it captures; but, in TV systems, it is handled similarly to 24&amp;nbsp;Hz material (i.e. displayed at least twice the capture rate).

== Capture ==
The capture process fixes the "natural" frame rate of the image sequence. Moving image sequence can be captured at the rate which is different from presentation rate, however this is usually only done for the sake of artistic effect, or for studying fast-pace or slow processes. In order to faithfully reproduce familiar movements of persons, animals, or natural processes, and to faithfully reproduce accompanying sound, the capture rate must be equal to, or at least very close to the presentation rate.

All modern moving image capture systems either use a mechanical or an electronic [[Shutter (photography)|shutter]]. Shutter allows the image for a single frame to be integrated over a shorter period of time than the image change period. Another important function of the shutter in raster-based systems is to make sure that the part of frame scanned first (e.g. the topmost part) contains image of the scene integrated over exactly the same period of time as the part of frame scanned last.

Early TV cameras, such as the [[video camera tube]], did not have a shutter. Not using shutter in raster systems may alter the shape of the moving objects on the screen. On the other hand, the video from such a camera looks shockingly "live" when displayed on a CRT display in its native format.

== Transmission ==
Analog broadcasting systems—[[PAL]]/[[SECAM]] and [[NTSC]]—were historically limited in the set of moving image formats they could transmit and present. PAL/SECAM can transmit 25&amp;nbsp;Hz and 50&amp;nbsp;Hz material, and NTSC can only transmit 30&amp;nbsp;Hz and 60&amp;nbsp;Hz material (later replaced by 30/1.001 and 60/1.001&amp;nbsp;Hz). Both systems were also limited to an aspect ratio of 4:3 and fixed resolution (limited by the available bandwidth). While the wider aspect ratios were relatively straightforward to adapt to 4:3 frame (for instance by letterboxing), the frame rate conversion is not straightforward, and in many cases degrades the "fluidity" of motion, or quality of individual frames (especially when either the source or the target of the frame rate conversion is interlaced or inter-frame mixing is involved in the rate conversion).

=== 50 Hz television systems ===
Material for local TV markets is usually captured at 25&amp;nbsp;Hz or 50&amp;nbsp;Hz. Many broadcasters have film archives of 24 frame/s (film speed) content related to news gathering or television production.

Live broadcasts (news, sports, important events) are usually captured at 50&amp;nbsp;Hz. Using 25&amp;nbsp;Hz (de-interlacing essentially) for live broadcasts makes them look like they are taken from an archive, so the practice is usually avoided unless there is a motion processor in the transmission chain.

Usually 24&amp;nbsp;Hz material from [[film]] is usually sped up by 4%, when it is of feature film origin. The sound is also raised in pitch slightly as a result of the 4% speedup but pitch correction circuits are typically used.
* Older technology allows an alternative option where every 12th film frame is held for three video fields instead of two mostly fixing the problem.
* More modern film playback technology allows for every 25th frame to be interpolated, with less objectionable results and no need for pitch modification.
* Each of these film oriented content transmission techniques has its own drawbacks. However modern motion compensation processors are considered to produce the least objectionable output.

With roughly 30 or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz material, imported from 60&amp;nbsp;Hz systems, is usually adapted for presentation at 50&amp;nbsp;Hz by adding duplicate frames or dropping excessive frames, sometimes also involving intermixing consecutive frames. Nowadays, digital motion analysis, although complex and expensive, can produce a superior-looking conversion (though not absolutely perfect).

=== 60 Hz television systems ===
Because of higher television production budgets in the US, and a preference for the look of film, many prerecoded TV shows were, in fact, captured onto film at 24&amp;nbsp;Hz.

Source material filmed at 24&amp;nbsp;Hz is converted to roughly 60&amp;nbsp;Hz using the technique called [[3:2 pulldown]], which includes inserting variable number of duplicate frames, with additional slowdown by the factor of 1.001, if needed. Occasionally, inter-frame mixing is used to smooth the judder.

Live programs are captured at roughly 60&amp;nbsp;Hz.  In the last 15 years, 30&amp;nbsp;Hz has also become a feasible capture rate when a more "film like" look is desired, but ordinary video cameras are used. Capture on video at the film rate of 24&amp;nbsp;Hz is an even more recent development, and mostly accompanies HDTV production. Unlike 30&amp;nbsp;Hz capture, 24&amp;nbsp;Hz cannot be simulated in post production. The camera must be natively capable of capturing at 24&amp;nbsp;Hz during recording. Because the ~30&amp;nbsp;Hz material is more "fluid" than 24&amp;nbsp;Hz material, the choice between ~30 and ~60 rate is not as obvious as that between 25&amp;nbsp;Hz and 50&amp;nbsp;Hz. When printing 60&amp;nbsp;Hz video to film, it has always been necessary to convert it to 24&amp;nbsp;Hz using the reverse 3:2 pulldown. The look of the finished product can resemble that of film, however it is not as smooth, (particularly if the result is returned to video) and a badly done deinterlacing causes image to noticeably shake in vertical direction and lose detail.

References to "60 Hz" and "30 Hz" in this context are shorthand, and always refer to the 59.94&amp;nbsp;Hz or 60 x 1000/1001 rate. Only black and white video and certain HDTV prototypes ever ran at true 60.000&amp;nbsp;Hz. The US HDTV standard supports both true 60&amp;nbsp;Hz and 59.94&amp;nbsp;Hz; the latter is almost always used for better compatibility with NTSC.

25 or 50&amp;nbsp;Hz material, imported from 50&amp;nbsp;Hz systems, can be adapted to 60&amp;nbsp;Hz similarly, by dropping or adding frames and intermixing consecutive frames. The best quality for 50&amp;nbsp;Hz material is provided by digital motion analysis.

=== Modern digital systems ===
[[Digital video]] is free of many of the limitations of analog transmission formats and presentation mechanisms (e.g. [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] display) because it decouples the behavior of the capture process from the presentation process. As a result, digital video provides the means to capture, convey and present moving images in their original format, as intended by directors (see article about purists), regardless of variations in video standards.

[[Frame grabber]]s that employ [[MPEG]] or other compression formats are able to encode moving image sequences in their original [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]]s, resolution and frame capture rates (24/1.001, 24, 25, 30/1.001, 30, 50, 60/1.001, 60&amp;nbsp;Hz). MPEG—and other compressed video formats that employ [[motion analysis]]—help to mitigate the incompatibilities among the various video formats used around the world.

At the receiving end, a digital display is free to independently present the image sequence at a multiple of its capture rate, thus reducing visible flicker. Most modern displays are "multisync," meaning that they can refresh the image display at a rate most suitable for the image sequence being presented. For example, a multisync display may support a range of vertical refresh rates from 50 to 72&amp;nbsp;Hz, or from 96 to 120&amp;nbsp;Hz, so that it can display all standard capture rates by means of an integer rate conversion.

== Presentation ==
There are two kinds of displays on the market today: those which "flash" a picture for a short part of the refresh period (CRT, cinema projector), and those which display an essentially static image between the moments of refreshing it (LCD, DLP).

The "flashing" displays must be driven at least 48&amp;nbsp;Hz, although today, a rate significantly below 85&amp;nbsp;Hz is not considered ergonomic.

For these displays, the 24–30&amp;nbsp;Hz material is usually displayed at 2x, 3x, or 4x the capture rate. 50 and ~60&amp;nbsp;Hz material is usually displayed at its native rate, where it delivers a very accurate motion without any smearing.  It can also be displayed at twice the capture rate, although moving objects will look smeared or trailed, unless intermediate frames are calculated using the motion analysis and are not just simply duplicated.

The "continuous" display can be driven at any integer multiple of the capture rate - it won't matter for the viewer, nor can it be visually discriminated. However, in general, "continuous" displays show noticeable smear over quickly-moving objects in 50 and ~60&amp;nbsp;Hz video material (even if their response time is instant).  However, there are two emerging techniques to combat smearing of the video-based material in LCD display: it can be effectively converted into the "flashing" display by appropriately modulating its backlight; and/or it can be driven at double the capture rate while calculating intermediate frames using the motion analysis (see [[LCD television]]).

Obviously, when presentation rate is not an integer multiple of the capture rate, the "fluidity" of the motion on the screen will suffer to a varying degree (terribly for video-, unpleasantly for film-based material). This is usually the case with computer-based DVD players and PAL PC TVs, where the user does not switch the refresh rate either out of ignorance, or due to technical constraints; which sometimes are, in fact, artificial, made by manufacturers counting on that user's ignorance. For instance some laptop LCD panels cannot be (easily) switched to anything but a 60&amp;nbsp;Hz refresh rate, and some LCD displays with DVI input refuse to accept digital input signal if its vertical refresh rate does not fit between 58 and 62&amp;nbsp;Hz.

Most software DVD players do not assist with switching display modes, and even if it is switched manually, they hardly synchronize frame updating with the display's vertical retrace periods. (There is only soft synchronization using hardware double buffering, which is not enough to match hardware players in the stability of playback.)

== 50 vs. 60 Hz ==
60&amp;nbsp;Hz material captures motion a bit more "smoother" than 50&amp;nbsp;Hz material. The drawback is that it takes approximately 1/5 more bandwidth to transmit, if all other parameters of the image (resolution, aspect ratio) are equal. "Approximately", because interframe compression techniques, such as [[MPEG]], are a bit more efficient with higher frame rates, because the consecutive frames also become a bit more similar.

There are, however, technical and political obstacles for adopting a single worldwide video format.  The most important technical problem is that quite often the lighting of the scene is achieved with lamps which flicker at a rate related to the local [[mains electricity|mains]] frequency.  For instance the mercury lighting used in stadiums (twice the mains frequency).  Capturing video under such conditions must be done at a matching rate, or the colours will flicker badly on the screen.  Even an AC incandescent light may be a problem for a camera if it is underpowered or near the end of its useful life.

The necessity to select a single universal video format (for the sake of the global material interchange) should anyway become irrelevant in the digital age. The director of video production would then be free to select the most appropriate format for the job, and a video camera would become a global instrument (currently the market is very fragmented).

A '''multistorey car park'''&lt;ref name=cam&gt;[https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/parking-garage?a=british ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oed&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/car_park ]&lt;/ref&gt; (UK English) or '''parking garage''' (US English;&lt;ref name=cam/&gt; also called a '''multistorey''',&lt;ref name=cam2&gt;[https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/multistorey ]&lt;/ref&gt; '''parkade''' (mainly Canadian), '''parking structure''', '''parking ramp''',  '''parking deck''' or '''indoor parking''') is a building designed for car parking and where there are a number of floors or levels on which parking takes place. It is essentially an indoor, stacked [[car park|parking lot]]. Parking structures may be [[HVAC|heated]] if they are enclosed.

Design of parking structures can add considerable cost for planning new developments, and can be mandated by cities or states in new building parking requirements. Some cities such as [[London]] have abolished previously enacted minimum parking requirements.&lt;ref name="economist.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21720269-dont-let-people-park-free-how-not-create-traffic-jams-pollution-and-urban-sprawl|title=How not to create traffic jams, pollution and urban sprawl|website=The Economist|access-date=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:The Modern Multi-Floor Garage (1929) - p. 13 - cross section of a d'Humy Motoramp garage (no caption).png|thumb|A circa 1929 drawing shows a cross-section of a typical multi-storey car park of that era, using the d'Humy Motoramp design.]]
&lt;!-- Please note that in British English, the language this article was written in, the correct spelling is 'multi-storey' not 'multi-storey'. Thanks! --&gt;
The earliest known multi-storey car park was opened in May 1901 by City &amp; Suburban Electric Carriage Company at 6 Denman Street, central London. The location had space for 100 vehicles over seven floors, totaling 19,000 square feet. The same company opened a second location in 1902 for 230 vehicles. The company specialized in the sale, storage, valeting and on-demand delivery of electric vehicles that could travel about 40 miles and had a top speed of 20 miles per hour.

The earliest known multi-storey car park in the United States was built in 1918 for the Hotel La Salle at 215 West Washington Street in the West Loop area of downtown Chicago, Illinois. It was designed by Holabird and Roche.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asphaltnation.com/Articles/parking.html|title=asphaltnation.com|publisher=|accessdate=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hotel La Salle was demolished in 1976, but the parking structure remained because it had been designated as preliminary landmark status&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationaltrust.org/magazine/archives/arch_story/102105.htm Preservation Online: Storey of the Week Archives: Car Culture&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and the structure was several blocks from the hotel.  It was demolished in 2005 after failing to receive landmark status from the city of Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.preservationchicago.org/risk/lasalle.html Preservation Chicago&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623002621/http://preservationchicago.org/risk/lasalle.html |date=23 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 49-storey apartment tower, 215 West, has taken its place, also featuring a multi-tiered parking garage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://discountparkandride.com/blog/guide-to-parking-lots/|title=The Guide to Parking Lots|date=9 January 2015|publisher=Discount Park &amp; Ride|accessdate=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
[[File:Underground parking 2.jpg|thumb|Basement parking]]
[[File:Met 2 Miami 20110307.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A large, mostly enclosed multi-storey car park forms the base or "pedestal" of two connected high rises. At nearly 20 stories and over {{convert|200|ft|m}}, it is an exceptionally large car park that comprises a significant portion of the building.]]
[[File:Free Parking.jpg|thumb|right|The inside of a multi-storey car park]]
[[File:Motorcycle parking.jpg|thumb|left|Motorcycle parking inside a multi-storey car park]]

The movement of vehicles between floors can take place by means of:

* interior [[Inclined plane|ramp]]s – the most common type
* exterior ramps – which may take the form of a circular ramp (colloquially known as a 'whirley-gig' in America)
* vehicle [[Elevator|lifts]] – the least common
* automated robot systems – combination of ramp and elevator

Where the car park is built on sloping land, it may be [[split-level]] or have sloped parking.

Many car parks are independent buildings dedicated exclusively to that use. The design loads for car parks are often less than the office building they serve (50 psf versus 80 psf), leading to long floor spans of 55–60 feet that permit cars to park in rows without supporting columns in between. The most common structural systems in the United States for these structures are either [[prestressed concrete]] [[double-tee]] floor systems or post-tensioned cast-in-place concrete floor systems.

In recent times, car parks built to serve residential and some business properties have been built as part of a larger building, often underground as part of the basement, such as at the [[Atlantic Station]] redevelopment in [[Atlanta]].  This saves land for other uses (as opposed to a parking lot), is cheaper and more practical in most cases than a separate structure, and is hidden from view.  It protects customers and their cars from weather such as rain, snow, or hot summer sunshine that raises a vehicle's interior temperature to extremely high levels.  Underground parking of only two levels was considered an innovative concept in 1964, when developer [[Louis Lesser]] developed a two-level underground parking structure under six 10-storey high-rise residential halls at [[California State University, Los Angeles]], which lacked space for horizontal expansion in the {{convert|176|acre|km2|adj=on}} university.  The simple two-level parking structure was considered unusual enough in 1964 that a separate newspaper section entitled "Parking Underground" described the garage as an innovative "concept" and as "subterranean spaces".&lt;ref name="LAT25Jun63"&gt;Los Angeles Times, 25 June 1963, "High Rise Developer Defends Loss of View to Convenience"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LAT15Mar64"&gt;Los Angeles Times, 15 March 1964, Tom Cameron, "$118&amp;nbsp;Million Going Into Expansion at L.A. State"&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Toronto]], a 2,400 space parking lot below [[Nathan Phillips Square]] is one of the world's largest.

Car parks which serve shopping centres can be built adjacent to the centre for easier access at each floor between shops and parking. One example is [[Mall of America]] in [[Bloomington, Minnesota]], USA, which has two large car parks attached to the building, at the eastern and western ends. A common position for car parks within shopping centres in the UK is on the roof, around the various utility systems, enabling customers to take lifts straight down into the centre. Examples of such are [[The Oracle, Reading|The Oracle]] in [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] and [[Festival Place]] in [[Basingstoke]].

These garages often have low ceiling clearances, which restrict access by [[full-size van]]s and other large vehicles. On 15 December 2013, a man was killed during a robbery in the garage at [[The Mall at Short Hills]] in [[Millburn, New Jersey]]. The paramedics responding to the shooting were delayed because their ambulance was too large to enter the garage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nj.com/essex/index.ssf/2014/01/short_hills_carjacking_911s_wifes_call.html|title='Where is it?' Panicked 911 calls from wife of lawyer killed in mall carjacking beg for ambulance|last=Queally|first=James|date=14 January 2014|accessdate=15 January 2014|newspaper=The Star-Ledger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, costs for multi-storey parking structures are estimated to cost between $25,000 per space, with underground parking costing around $35,000 per space.&lt;ref name="economist.com"/&gt;

===Structural integrity===
[[File:Collapsed parking garage site.jpg|thumb|left|Shuttered construction site of garage nearly two years after partial structural failure]]
Parking structures are subjected to the heavy and shifting loads of moving vehicles, and must bear the associated physical stresses. [[Expansion joint]]s are used between sections not only for thermal expansion but to accommodate the flexing of the structure's sections due to vehicle traffic.  [[Seismic retrofit]]s can be applied where earthquakes are an issue.

Some parking structures have partly collapsed, either during construction or years later.  In July 2009 a fourth-floor section failed at the [[Centergy]] building in [[midtown Atlanta]], pancaking down and destroying more than 30 vehicles but injuring no-one.  In December 2007, a car crashed into the wall of the deck at the [[SouthPark Mall (Charlotte, North Carolina)|SouthPark Mall]] in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], weakening it and causing a small collapse which destroyed two cars below.  On the same day, one under construction in [[Jacksonville, Florida]] collapsed as concrete was being poured on the sixth floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,315587,00.html|title=North Carolina Parking Deck Collapse Kills 1|date=6 December 2007|publisher=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In November 2008, the sudden collapse of the middle level of a deck in [[Montreal]] was preceded by warning signs some weeks before, including cracks and water leaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/montreal/story/2008/11/26/mtl-bldg.html|title=Man dies after Montreal parking garage roof collapses|date=26 November 2008|work=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Parking structures are generally not subject to [[building inspection]]s after being checked for their initial [[occupancy permit]].

In October 2012 four people were killed and nine more injured when a parking structure under construction at a campus of [[Miami-Dade College]] in Florida collapsed,&lt;ref name="mdc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdc.edu/main/thereporter/archive/vol03-05/news/four_dead_several_injured_after_parking_.aspx|title=Four Dead, Several Injured After Parking Garage Collapses At West Campus|date=30 October 2012|publisher=Miami-Dade College|author=Castillo, Gregory|accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; purportedly due to an unfinished column.&lt;ref name="huffpostmiami"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/29/miami-college-parking-garage-collapse_n_2979021.html|title=Miami Dade College Parking Garage Collapsed Due To Unfinished Column: Lawyer|date=29 March 2013|work=[[Huffington Post]]|accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Precast parking structures===
[[File:Precast parking structure.jpg|thumb|right|Precast parking structure showing an interior column, girders and double-tee structural floors. The two gray circles are covers to close the lifting anchor holes.]]

With the growth of multi-storey car parks since the middle of the twentieth century, many constructions of such structures have been using [[precast concrete]] to reduce the construction time. The design involves putting parking structure parts together. The parts of precast concrete include multi-storey structural wall panels, interior and exterior columns, structural floors, [[girder]]s, wall panels, stairs and slabs. The precast concrete parts are transported using flatbed semi-trailers to the sites. The structural floor modules may need to be laid tilted during the transportation in order to cover as large floor area as possible while they can be easily transported on the roadways. The modules are lifted using [[precast concrete lifting anchor system]]s at the sites for assembly. Decorations may include using of covers to close the holes in the precast concrete that contains the lifting anchors, and installing [[facade]]s to the exterior of the structures.

In modern construction of the precast modules, there are other features to improve the strength of the structure. An example is to use [[Prestressed concrete|prestressed strands]] on post-tensioned concrete for the construction of the [[shear wall]]s. Another example is the use of [[carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer]] to replace steel wire mesh to lighten the load and yield more corrosion resistant especially for the cold-climate areas which use salt for melting snow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highconcrete.com/resources/technical/upload/Hi_ParkBro_18.pdf|title=High Precast Parking Systems|publisher=High Concrete Group|accessdate=3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architectural value===
[[File:1111 Lincoln Road at night.jpg|thumb|The [[1111 Lincoln Road]] parking garage]]
These structures are not usually known for their architectural value.  As ''[[Architectural Record]]'' has noted, "In the Pantheon of Building Types, the parking garage lurks somewhere in the vicinity of prisons and toll plazas."&lt;ref name="ar-arch"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archrecord.construction.com/projects/portfolio/archives/10061111Lincoln_Road-1.asp|title=1111 Lincoln Road|date=June 2010|author=Beth Broome|magazine=[[Architectural Record]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;   ''[[The New York Times]]'' has labeled parking structures as "the grim afterthought of American design".&lt;ref name="nyt-event"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/24/us/24garage.html|title=A Miami Beach Event Space. Parking Space, Too.|date=24 January 2011|page=A1|author=Michael Barbaro|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A handful of parking garages have received considerable praise for their design, including
*1111 Lincoln Road, in the [[South Beach]] section of [[Miami Beach, Florida]] and designed by the internationally known Swiss architectural firm of [[Herzog &amp; de Meuron]].&lt;ref name="ar-arch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-event" /&gt;
*The [[Brutalist]] [[Preston bus station]] in the United Kingdom, which incorporates a multi-storey car park

==Nomenclature==
The term ''multistorey car park'' (often abbreviated to ''multistorey'' or ''multistory'')&lt;ref name=cam2/&gt; is used in the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, and many [[Commonwealth of Nations]] countries, and it is nowadays most commonly spelled without a hyphen.&lt;ref name=cam/&gt;&lt;ref name=oed/&gt; In the western United States, the term ''parking structure'' is used,{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} especially when it is necessary to distinguish such a structure from the "[[Garage (house)|garage]]" connected with a house. In some places in North America, "parking garage" refers only to an indoor, often underground, structure. Outdoor, multi-level parking facilities are referred to by a number of regional terms:
*'''Parking garage''' is used, to varying degrees, throughout the U.S. and Canada as well often referring to underground parking, and professionally by [[civil engineering|civil engineers]];
*'''Parking deck''' is used mostly in the [[Southern United States]].
*'''Parking ramp''' is used in the upper [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], especially [[Minnesota]] and [[Wisconsin]], and has been observed as far east as [[Buffalo, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wisconsin English varieties|url=http://csumc.wisc.edu/wep/Words.html|website=Wisconsin Englishes|publisher=Center for the Study of Upper Midwestern Cultures; Wisconsin Humanities Council|accessdate=29 October 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603191722/http://csumc.wisc.edu/wep/Words.html|archivedate=3 June 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bcarparking.com/|website=Buffalo Civic Auto Ramps|accessdate=2 August 2017|title=Buffalo Civic Auto Ramps}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Parkade''' is widely used in West Canada and South Africa
*'''Parking building''' is used in New Zealand.

Architects and [[civil engineer]]s in the USA are likely to call it a '''parking structure''' since their work is all about structures and since that term is the vernacular in some of the western United States.  When attached to a [[high-rise]] of another use, it is sometimes called a '''parking podium'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lamag.com/driver/judging-the-parking-podiums-of-dtlas-newest-high-rises/|title=Judging the Parking Podiums of DTLA's Newest High-Rises – Los Angeles Magazine|date=2015-10-13|work=Los Angeles Magazine|access-date=2017-04-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  United States [[building codes]] use the term '''open parking garage''' to refer to a structure designed for car storage that has openings along at least 40% of the perimeter, as opposed to an '''enclosed parking garage''' that requires mechanical ventilation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://publicecodes.cyberregs.com/icod/ibc/2012/icod_ibc_2012_4_sec006.htm International Code Council. ''International Building Code 2012 (Second Printing)''&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201235526/http://publicecodes.cyberregs.com/icod/ibc/2012/icod_ibc_2012_4_sec006.htm |date=1 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Natural or mechanical ventilation provides fresh air flow to disperse car exhaust in normal conditions, or hot gas and smoke in case of fire.

Typically car park experts describe the number of car park floors in terms of "G+x". G stands for ground and x for the number of floors above ground. For example, G+5 is a multi-story car park structure with a ground floor and 5 floors above that, i.e. a total of 6 floors.

==Construction types==
* Concrete 
* Steel structure
* Automated (mechanical)

===Steel structure===
Structure car parks are car parks made of structural steel components connected to each other to carry the loads and provide full structural rigidity.

Steel is a high-strength material requiring less material than other types of structures like concrete and timber. Steel construction features:
* Cost savings: inexpensive to manufacture and erect, and requires less maintenance than traditional building methods.
* Speed: Allows construction/prefabrication off-site with rapid installation on-site. Some suppliers claim construction in days.
* Durability: Suppliers claim 50-plus years lifespan.
* Removability: Steel car park structure could be designed to be removed at a later date.
* Expandability: Steel car park structures can be expanded easily at a later date.
* Creativity: Steel allows for long column-free spans.

The ceiling slab of the steel structure car park is typically made of composite material such as corrugated steel sheets and concrete. The surface of the first-floor parking can be left bare or covered with epoxy or tarmac.

===Foundationless and modular===

Demand, steel features, and innovation have led to the development of a foundationless, modular, removable steel car park structure.

Parking demand often grows quickly, significantly and sometimes unexpectedly.  Modular steel car parks could be the proper solution if the surface area available is not sufficient and can be expanded upwards, or whenever it is not feasible to build up a multi-story parking.
The development of the building concept of modular car parks came about by using the modular assembling method of vertical and horizontal elements (such as columns and beams)
Modular car park structures are versatile and can be built in phases or in different sizes and shape.
The solution makes it possible to develop a parking structure even in case of particular conditions or constraints, such as archaeological sites or city centres, because it allows:
* To virtually double the parking surface without leaving any footprint on the ground, as no settlement for excavations or traditional foundations is needed;
* To double the parking surface by means of a light steel single-deck car park system.
* Prefab modular components of the system make each project versatile and suitable for both large and small sized areas.

These parking structures are generally demountable and can be relocated to avoid making the choice of converting a surface to parking area irrevocably. They could be used as permanent structures or are conceived as temporary parking facilities for temporary parking demand needs. A number of parking decks have been demounted after a few years – to make room for the development of a permanent structure – and relocated to respond to local parking demand.

==Automated parking==
{{main|Automated parking system}}
{{distinguish|text=[[Automatic parking]], a self-parking feature in a car}}
[[File:Automatic-Underground-Car-Storage-Thessaloniki.jpg|thumb|Automatic underground car storage in [[Thessaloniki]], Greece]]
The earliest use of an [[automated parking system]] (APS) was in Paris in 1905 at the Garage Rue de Ponthieu.&lt;ref name="McDonald-2012"&gt;Sanders McDonald, Shannon.[http://www.trforum.org/forum/downloads/2012_112_Cars_Parking_Sustain.pdf "Cars, Parking and Sustainability"], ''The Transportation Research Forum http://www.trforum.org/''.Retrieved on 16 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The APS consisted of a groundbreaking&lt;ref name="McDonald-2012" /&gt; multi-story concrete structure with an internal elevator to transport cars to upper levels where attendants parked the cars.&lt;ref name=Hamelink&gt;{{Citation
 | title = The Mechanical Parking Guide 2011
 | year = 2011
 | author = Hamelink, Ir. Leon J.
 | isbn = 1-466-43786-3
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A 1931 ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' article speculated an underground garage where the car was taken to a parking area by a [[conveyor]] then an elevator to shuttles mounted on rails.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=u-IDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA180&amp;dq=Popular+Mechanics+1931+curtiss&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3bTyTKD7AZPfnQeEr635Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Underground Garage to End Parking Problem"], February 1931, ''Popular Mechanics''&lt;/ref&gt;

The total cost of ownership of automated car parks needs to be carefully considered.

The actual cost of construction of automated car parks is typically higher than conventional car park structures, however, this can be offset by the higher space efficiency of automated car parks. The cost of the mechanical equipment needed to transport the cars needs to be added to the building cost. In addition, operation and maintenance costs of the mechanical equipment need to be added in order to determine the total cost of ownership. Other costs could be saved, for example, there is no need for an energy-intensive [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilating system]], since cars are not driven inside and human cashiers or security personnel may not be needed. For naturally ventilated car parks structures, the ventilation equipment is not needed.

Automated car parks rely on similar technology to that used for mechanical handling and document retrieval. The driver leaves the car in an entrance module, and it is then transported to a parking slot by a robotic [[flatbed trolley|trolley]]. For the driver, the process of parking is reduced to leaving the car inside an entrance module.

At peak periods a wait may occur before entering or leaving, because loading passengers and luggage occurs at the entrance and exit rather than at the parking stall. This loading blocks the entrance or exit from being available to others. It is generally not recommended to use automated car parks for high peak hour volume facilities.

Additional factors that need to be taken into consideration are:
* Fear of breakdowns (How does the user get the car back)
* Maintenance contracts needed with suppliers

== Other technologies==
{{See also|Parking guidance and information|Parking lot}}
[[File:Car park sensor.jpg|thumb|[[Ultrasonic sensor|Ultrasonic]] [[sensor]]s above each lot in this indoor car park determine if a car has already taken the lot and indicate using [[LED]]s;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://keytop.en.alibaba.com/product/513301802-209897983/led_lamps_for_parking_car_parking_space_led_indicator.html|title=parking sensor indicator/parking space indicator/led parking lot lighting, View car parking led indicator, KEYOP Product Details from Xiamen Keytop Communication &amp; Technology Company Limited on Alibaba.com|publisher=|accessdate=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some can send a [[Bluetooth]]/[[Short Message Service|SMS]] message with the parking space number or code.]]

Modern parking lots utilize a variety of technologies to help motorists find unoccupied parking spaces, [[car location]] when returning to the vehicle and improve their experience.  This includes [[adaptive lighting]], [[sensor]]s and [[parking space LED indicator]]s (red for occupied, green for available and blue is reserved for the disabled; above every parking space), [[indoor positioning system]] (IPS), including [[QR code]], and  [[mobile payment]] options. The Santa Monica Place shopping mall in California has cameras on each stall that can help count the lot occupancy and find lost cars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jan/23/local/la-me-santa-monica-parking-20110123 "Servant or snoop in the parking garage?"] ''Los Angeles Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

Online booking technology service providers have been created to helped drivers find long-term parking in an automated manner, while also providing significant savings for those who book parking spaces ahead of time. They use real-time inventory management checking technology to display parking lots with availability, sorted by price and distance from the airport.

== Education &amp; research ==
In October 2009, the [[National Building Museum]] opened an exhibition solely devoted to the study of parking garages (multi-storey car parks) and their impact on the built environment. This exhibition, titled ''House of Cars: Innovation and the Parking Garage'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbm.org/exhibitions-collections/exhibitions/house-of-cars.html|title=House of Cars: Innovation and the Parking Garage|publisher=|accessdate=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was on view until 11 July 2010.

==Acquisition of Freescale Semiconductor==
* In March 2015, a merger agreement was announced through which NXP would acquire rival [[Freescale Semiconductor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=NXP, Freescale Agree to Merger: Cash-and-stock deal values U.S. chip maker at $11.8 billion | publisher=Wall Street Journal | date= 1 March 2015 | author=DANA MATTIOLI, GILLIAN TAN | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/nxp-freescale-agree-to-merger-1425245923?tesla=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* On December 7, 2015, NXP completed its acquisition of Freescale Semiconductor and the merged company continued operations as NXP Semiconductors N.V.&lt;ref&gt;NXP. "[http://investors.nxp.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=209114&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=2120581 NXP and Freescale Announce Completion of Merger]." December 03, 2015. Retrieved August 17, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analysis of merger===
Both have deep roots stretching back to when they were part of Philips NV (in the case of NXP), and Motorola (Freescale). Each has comparable revenue figures; US$4.8B and US$4.2B for NXP and Freescale respectively in 2013. NXP primarily focuses on [[near field communication]] (NFC) and [[high-performance mixed signal]] (HPMS) hardware. Freescale focuses on its [[microprocessor]] and [[microcontroller]]. Both companies possess roughly equal patent portfolios.&lt;ref name="chipworks.com"&gt;http://www.chipworks.com/en/technical-competitive-analysis/resources/blog/nxpfreescale-merger-a-union-of-equals/ NXP/Freescale Merger a Union of Equals&lt;/ref&gt;

Certainly, each company brings core strengths to the combined organization, NFC from NXP and microcontrollers from Freescale. Also, both companies have been actively involved in litigation over the years as both plaintiff and defendant, so a larger and, more importantly, a more geographically diverse patent portfolio could likely prove useful in such matters.  [[Chipworks]]' analysts suggest the newly merged company will divest itself of many properties as the merger progresses.&lt;ref name="chipworks.com"/&gt;

Some analysts believe cost savings after the two companies merge are expected to be about $500M dollars. Customers are ultimately divided over the consolidation of their product families and how it may affect their own development and end-products.&lt;ref name="chipworks.com"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3641">'''NeTEx ''' (formally Network Exchange ''PD CEN/TS 16614-1:2014', PD CEN/TS 16614-2:2014 and PD CEN/TS 16614-3:2014'') is the [[European Committee for Standardization|CEN]] Technical standard   for  exchanging [[Public Transport]] Information  as  XML documents. it provides a W3C XML schema based on the [[Transmodel]] abstract model of common  public transport concepts and data structures and can be used to exchange many different kinds of data  between  [[passenger information system]]s, including data describing for stops, facilities, timetabling and  fares. Such data can be used by both operational management systems and customer facing systems for [[Journey Planner|journey planning]] etc.

==Scope==
NeTEx provides a modular  XML schema for public transport information data including  [[passenger information system]]s, with coverage of a number of different subdomains of PT information, including transport network infrastructure and [[topology]], public transport schedules, [[Journey Planner|journey planning]], fares, fare validation.  It includes uniform mechanisms for versioning  and identifying entity instances within a global context. It provides protocols for exchanging NeTEx XML documents using either  asynchronous bulk exchange and any file transfer protocol,  or dynamic messaging using http and a set of protocols that make use of the common framework of the [[Service Interface for Real Time Information]]. Like Transmodel, on which it is closely based (using [Model Driven Design] concepts), NeTEx provides reusable abstractions to represent data elements of public transport.

* Part 1 - '''Network Topology'''  (''CEN/TS 16614-1:2014'') describes the Public Transport Network topology and timing concepts; and includes common framework concepts used by all parts.
* Part 2 - '''Timing Information''' (''CEN/TS 16614-2:2014'') describes Scheduled Timetables, including complex rail and non-rail modes;
* Part 3 - '''Public Transport Fares''' (''CEN/TS 16614-3:2015'') covers Fare information, including complex fare models

==History==
NeTEx is an evolution and offspring of the [[Transmodel]] project, which developed a conceptual model to harmonise and systemise the data formats of a number of European countries. It represents a harmonisation of a number of different European standards such as Bison (Netherlands), Trident (France)   [[TransXChange]] (UK), VDV 452 (Germany), TAP TSI, for all of which a mapping to NeTEx exists.  There is also a mapping to  Google's [[GTFS]].

V1.0 of NeTEx was published by CEN in 2014. V1.1 is under development for completion in 2018/2019.  

In 2017, under the Intelligent Transport Systems Priority Action A Directive (2010/40/E), the European Commission recognized NeTEx as a strategic standard for the cross-border exchange of data to  enable the provision of EU-wide multi-modal travel information services, with the aim of making public transport data available in NeTEx format at National Access Points in all European countries by 2019.

'''Networked Help Desk''' is an [[open standard]] initiative to provide a common [[Application programming interface|API]] for sharing customer support tickets between separate instances of [[Issue tracking system|issue tracking]], [[Bug tracking system|bug tracking]], [[customer relationship management]] (CRM) and [[Project management software|project management]] systems to improve [[customer service]] and reduce [[vendor lock-in]].&lt;ref name="NHDMAIN"&gt;{{cite web |title=Open Standard for Customer Service and Help Desks |date=2011-06-01 |url=http://networkedhelpdesk.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ASAY2011"&gt;{{cite journal |title=One help desk API to unite them all: Down with the Software Tower of Babel |date=2011-06-01 |last=Asay |first=Matt |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/07/01/networking_the_helpdesk/ |accessdate=2016-05-06 |journal=[[The Register]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative was created by [[Zendesk]] in June 2011 in collaboration with eight other founding member organizations including [[Atlassian]], [[New Relic]], [[OTRS]], [[Pivotal Tracker]], [[ServiceNow]] and [[SugarCRM]].&lt;ref name="CARR2011"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Help Desk Shuffle: Will New Standard Help? |date=2011-06-07 |first=David F. |last=Carr |url=http://www.informationweek.com/crm/help-desk-shuffle-will-new-standard-help/d/d-id/1098166 |accessdate=2016-05-06 |journal=[[InformationWeek]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MEMBERS"&gt;{{cite web |title=Networked Help Desk Members |url=http://networkedhelpdesk.org/members/ |accessdate=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first integration,  between Zendesk and Atlassian's issue tracking product, [[Jira (software)|JIRA]],&lt;ref name="CARR2011"/&gt; was announced at the 2011 Atlassian Summit.&lt;ref name="LATKIEWICZ2011B"&gt;{{cite news |first=Matthew |last=Latkiewicz |date=2011-06-07 |title=Zendesk's JIRA Integration Rocks! |url=https://www.zendesk.com/blog/zendesks-jira-integration-rocks |accessdate=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; By August 2011, 34 member companies had joined the initiative.&lt;ref name="ZENDESK201108"&gt;{{cite news |title=NetworkedHelpDesk.org Welcomes 34 New Member Companies |date=2011-08-12 |url=https://www.zendesk.com/company/press/networkedhelpdesk-org-welcomes-34-new-member-companies/ |accessdate=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year after launching, over 50 organizations had joined.&lt;ref name="ONEYEARLATER"&gt;{{cite news |title=NetworkedHelpDesk.org: One Year Later |date=2012-05-31 |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/networkedhelpdeskorg-one-year-later-155961365.html |accessdate=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within Zendesk instances this feature is branded as '''ticket sharing'''.&lt;ref name="ZENDESKTICKETSHARING"&gt;{{cite web |title=Share Customer Support Tickets Seamlessly with Zendesk |url=http://www.zendesk.com/product/ticketsharing |date=2011-06-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028131600/http://www.zendesk.com/product/ticketsharing |archive-date=2011-10-28 |access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LATKIEWICZ2011A"&gt;{{cite news |first=Matthew |last=Latkiewicz |date=2011-06-06 |title=Share Support Tickets Across Multiple Zendesks With Our New Ticket Sharing Feature |url=http://www.zendesk.com/blog/zendesk-ticket-sharing-strengthens-collaborative-support |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140122092325/http://www.zendesk.com/blog/zendesk-ticket-sharing-strengthens-collaborative-support |archivedate=2014-01-22 |accessdate=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LATKIEWICZ2011C"&gt;{{cite news |first=Matthew |last=Latkiewicz |date=2011-06-06 |title=Networked Help Desk: An Open Standard for Better Customer Service |url=https://www.zendesk.com/blog/networked-help-desk-an-open-standard-for-better-customer-service/ |accessdate=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basis ==
Support tools are generally built around a common paradigm that begins with a customer making a [[ITIL#Request fulfillment|request]] or an [[Incident management (ITSM)|incident]] report, these create a ticket. Each ticket has a progress status and is updated with annotations and attachments. These annotations and attachments may be visible to the customer (public) or only visible to analysts (private). Customers are notified of progress made on their ticket until it is complete. If the people necessary to complete a ticket are using separate support tools, additional overhead is introduced in maintaining the relevant information in the ticket in each tool while notifying the customer of progress made by each group in completing their ticket. For example, if a customer support issue is caused by a software bug and reported to a help desk using one system, and then the fix is documented by the developers in another, and analyzed in a customer relationship management tool, keeping the records in each system up-to-date and notifying the customer manually using a swivel chair approach is unnecessarily time-consuming and error-prone. If information is not transferred correctly, a customer may have to re-explain their problem each time their ticket is transferred.&lt;ref name="FEIL2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WEINBERGER2011"&gt;{{cite news |first=Matthew |last=Weinberger |date=2011-06-07 |title=NetworkedHelpDesk.org: Helping Partners Break Help Desk Barriers? |url=http://talkincloud.com/networkedhelpdesk-org-helping-partners-break-help-desk-barriers |accessdate=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For systems with the Networked Help Desk API implemented, it is possible for several different applications related to a customer's support experience to synchronize data in one uniquely identified shared ticket.&lt;ref name="FINLEY2011C"&gt;{{cite journal |title=New API Aims to Unite Customer Service Applications |first=Klint |last=Finley |date=2011-06-07 |url=http://readwrite.com/2011/06/07/customer-service-api/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923233131/http://readwrite.com/2011/06/06/customer-service-api |archivedate=2013-09-23 |accessdate=2016-05-06 |journal=[[ReadWrite]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many applications in these domains have implemented APIs that allow data to be imported, exported and modified, Network Help Desk provides a common standard for customer support information to automatically synchronize between several systems.&lt;ref name="FEIL2011"&gt;{{cite news |first=George |last=Feil |title=Building the Web 3.0: NetworkedHelpDesk |date=2011-06-08 |url=https://blog.newrelic.com/2011/07/08/building-the-web-3-0-networkedhelpdesk/ |accessdate=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once implemented two systems can quickly share tickets with just a configuration change as they both understand the same interface.&lt;ref name="HINCHCLIFFE2011"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Enabling collaboration with open APIs |first=Dion |last=Hinchcliffe |date=2011-06-18 |url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/enabling-collaboration-with-open-apis/ |accessdate=2016-05-06 |journal=[[ZDNet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Communication between two instances on a specific ticket occurs in three steps, an invitation agreement, sharing of ticket data and continued synchronization of tickets.&lt;ref name="HINCHCLIFFE2011"/&gt; The standard allows for "full delegation" (analysts in both systems each make public and private comments and synchronize status) as well as "partial delegation" where the instance receiving the ticket can only make private comments and status changes are not synchronized.&lt;ref name="ZENDESKTICKETSHARING"/&gt;&lt;ref name="API"&gt;{{cite web |title=API Walkthough |url=http://networkedhelpdesk.org/api/ |accessdate=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tickets may be shared with multiple instances.&lt;ref name="LATKIEWICZ2011A"/&gt;

== Criticism ==
Harvey Kandola of Countersoft suggested that it would be preferable to have a single application that consolidates all tracking related functions, rather than using multiple tools and "connecting the dots" with initiatives like the Networked Help Desk.&lt;ref name="BRIDGWATER2012"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Adrian |last=Bridgwater |title=Countersoft's One-Stop Task and Project Tracker |url=http://www.drdobbs.com/tools/countersofts-one-stop-task-and-project-t/240006917 |date=2012-09-07 |accessdate=2016-05-06 |journal=[[Dr. Dobb's Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1591">'''PSOLA'''  (Pitch Synchronous Overlap and Add) is a digital [[signal processing]] technique used for [[speech processing]] and more specifically [[speech synthesis]]. It can be used to modify the [[pitch (music)|pitch]] and [[duration (music)|duration]] of a speech signal. It was invented around 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Charpentier|first1=F.|last2=Stella|first2=M.|title=Diphone synthesis using an overlap-add technique for speech waveforms concatenation|journal=Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, IEEE International Conference on ICASSP'86.|date=Apr 1986|volume= 11|pages=2015–2018|doi=10.1109/ICASSP.1986.1168657}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PSOLA works by dividing the speech waveform in small overlapping segments. To change the pitch of the signal, the segments are moved further apart (to decrease the pitch) or closer together (to increase the pitch). To change the duration of the signal, the segments are then repeated multiple times (to increase the duration) or some are eliminated (to decrease the duration). The segments are then combined using the [[overlap add]] technique.

PSOLA can be used to change the [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] of a speech signal.

The '''Philippine Scientific Earth Observation Microsatellite (PHL-Microsat) program''' is a [[satellite]] program carried by the [[Department of Science and Technology (Philippines)|Department of Science and Technology]] (DOST) of the Philippines in cooperation with the [[Tohoku University|Tohoku]] and [[Hokkaido University|Hokkaido Universities]] of Japan.

==Background==
[[Hokkaido University]] and [[Tohoku University]] of [[Japan]] initiated a project to send 50 microsatellites into space by 2050. The project will photograph aftermaths of natural disasters, partnering with governments, universities and other organizations based in [[Bangladesh]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Myanmar]], [[Mongolia]], [[Philippines]], [[Thailand]], and [[Vietnam]]. Two satellites are commissioned for the Philippine government.&lt;ref name=satnews&gt;{{cite news|title=Asian Universities +  Asian Nations Go Small...

The Philippine [[Department of Science and Technology (Philippines)|Department of Science and Technology]] (DOST) announced on June 29, 2017 that two [[CubeSat|CubeSats]] or nanosatellites will be launch in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Usman |first1=Edd |title=After micro-satellite, DOST set to launch ‘cube satellites’ in 2018 |url=http://newsbytes.ph/2017/06/30/after-micro-satellite-dost-set-to-launch-cube-satellites-in-2018/ |accessdate=4 July 2018 |work=Newsbytes |date=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of these satellites was [[Maya-1 (satellite)|Maya-1]], a nanosatellite developed under the Kyushu Institute of Technology-led Birds-2 project, was launched to space. The equipment is the first nanosatellite of the Philippines and is also placed under the PHL-Microsat program. It is to be deployed from the ISS sometime in August 2018,&lt;ref name="pdi1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Maya-1: Cube satellite latest Pinoy venture into space |url=http://technology.inquirer.net/77081/maya-1-cube-satellite-latest-pinoy-venture-space |accessdate=4 July 2018 |work=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 10, Maya-1 was deployed from the ISS along with satellites from Bhutan and Malaysia.

Part of the program also includes training Filipinos on satellite building capabilities.&lt;ref name="ptvnews"&gt;{{cite news |title=DOST to launch microsatellite to gather data on disasters |url=https://www.ptvnews.ph/dost-to-launch-microsatellite-to-gather-data-on-disasters/ |accessdate=27 October 2018 |work=PTV News |date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''potentiostat''' is the [[electronic hardware]] required to control a [[Voltammetry|three electrode cell]] and run most [[Electroanalytical method|electroanalytical]] experiments.  A ''Bipotentiostat'' and ''polypotentiostat'' are potentiostats capable of controlling two working electrodes and more than two working electrodes, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Bard, A.J.; Faulkner, L.R. '''Electrochemical Methods: Fundamentals and Applications.''' New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2nd Edition, '''2000''' {{ISBN|0-471-40521-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia G. Zoski (Editor) '''[[Handbook of Electrochemistry]]'''.  Elsevier, '''2007''' {{ISBN|0-444-51958-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter T. Kissinger, William R. Heineman '''Laboratory Techniques in Electroanalytical Chemistry'''.  CRC Press, '''1996''' {{ISBN|0-8247-9445-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglas A. Skoog, F. James Holler, Timothy A. Nieman '''Principles of Instrumental Analysis'''. Harcourt Brace College Publishers, '''1998''' {{ISBN|0-03-002078-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The system functions by maintaining the [[voltage|potential]] of the [[working electrode]] at a constant level with respect to the [[reference electrode]] by adjusting the [[electric current|current]] at an [[auxiliary electrode]]. It consists of an [[electric circuit]] which is usually described in terms of simple [[op amps]].

== Primary use ==
This equipment is fundamental to modern [[electrochemical]] studies using [[Voltammetry|three electrode systems]] for investigations of [[electrochemical reaction mechanism|reaction mechanisms]] related to [[redox]] chemistry and other [[chemistry|chemical]] phenomena.  The dimensions of the resulting data depend on the experiment.  In [[voltammetry]], [[electric current]] in [[ampere|amps]] is plotted against [[electric potential]] in [[voltage]].   In a [[bulk electrolysis]] total [[coulomb]]s passed (total [[electric charge]]) is plotted against time in seconds even though the experiment measures electric current ([[ampere]]s) over time.  This is done to show that the experiment is approaching an expected number of coulombs.    

Most early potentiostats could function independently, providing data output through a physical data trace.  Modern potentiostats are designed to interface with a [[personal computer]] and operate through a dedicated [[software]] package.  The automated software allows the user rapidly to shift between experiments and experimental conditions.  The computer allows data to be stored and analyzed more effectively, rapidly, and accurately than historic methods.

== Basic relationships ==
A potentiostat is a [[Controller (control theory)|control]] and [[measuring]] device.  It comprises an [[electric circuit]] which controls the potential across the cell by sensing changes in its  [[electrical resistance|resistance]], varying accordingly the current supplied to the system: a higher resistance will result in a decreased current, while a lower resistance will result in an increased current, in order to keep the voltage constant as described by [[Ohm's law]].

:&lt;math&gt;{R} = {E \over I}&lt;/math&gt;
As a result, the variable system [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] and the controlled current are [[inversely proportional]]
:&lt;math&gt;I_o={E_c \over R_v}&lt;/math&gt;
:*''&lt;math&gt;I_o&lt;/math&gt;'' is the output electric current of the potentiostat
:*''&lt;math&gt;E_c&lt;/math&gt;'' is the [[voltage]] that is kept constant
:*''&lt;math&gt;R_v&lt;/math&gt;'' is the [[electrical resistance]] that varies.

== Principles of operation ==
Since 1942, when Hickling built the first three electrode potentiostat,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal
| volume = 38
| pages = 27–33
| last = Hickling
| first = A.
| title = Studies in electrode polarisation. Part IV.-The automatic control of the potential of a working electrode
| journal = Transactions of the Faraday Society
| year = 1942
| doi = 10.1039/TF9423800027
}}&lt;/ref&gt; substantial progress has been made to improve the instrument.  Hickling's device used a third electrode, the [[reference electrode]] to control the cell potential automatically. Up until the present day his principle has remained in use. At a glance, a potentiostat measures the potential difference between the working and the reference electrode, applies the current through the counter electrode and measures the current as an &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; R &lt;/math&gt;  voltage drop over a series resistor (&lt;math&gt; R_{\textrm m} &lt;/math&gt; in Fig. 1).

The control amplifier (CA) is responsible for maintaining the voltage between the reference and the working electrode as closely as possible to the voltage of the input source &lt;math&gt; E_{\textrm i} &lt;/math&gt;. It adjusts its output to automatically control the cell current so that a condition of equilibrium is satisfied. The theory of operation is best understood using the equations below.

Prior to observing the following equations, one may note that, from an electrical point of view, the electrochemical cell and the current measurement resistor &lt;math&gt; R_{\textrm m} &lt;/math&gt; may be regarded as two impedances (Fig. 2).  &lt;math&gt; Z_1 &lt;/math&gt; includes &lt;math&gt; R_{\textrm m}&lt;/math&gt; in series with the interfacial impedance of the [[counter electrode]] and the solution resistance between the counter and the reference. &lt;math&gt; Z_2 &lt;/math&gt;
represents the interfacial impedance of the working electrode in series with the solution resistance between the working and the reference
electrodes. 
[[File:Potentiostat4.png|thumb|right|300px|Fig. 2 : Schematic of a potentiostat, with electrochemical cell replaced by two impedances.]]

The role of the control amplifier is to amplify the potential difference between the positive (or noninverting) input and the negative (or inverting) input. This may be translated mathematically into the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt; E_{\textrm{out}}=A\,(E^+-E^-)=A\,(E_{\textrm i}-E_{\textrm r}) &lt;/math&gt;. (1)

where &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; is the amplification factor of the CA. At this point the assumption may be made that a negligible amount of current is flowing through the reference electrode. This correlates to physical phenomenon since the reference electrode is connected to a high impedance electrometer.  Thus, the cell current may be described in two ways:

:&lt;math&gt; I_{\textrm c}=\frac{E_{\textrm{out}}}{Z_1+Z_2} &lt;/math&gt;(2)

and

:&lt;math&gt; I_{\textrm c}=\frac{E_{\textrm r}}{Z_2} &lt;/math&gt;. (3)

Combining Eqs.  (2) and (3) yields Eq. (4):

:&lt;math&gt; E_{\textrm r}=\frac{Z_2}{Z_1+Z_2}\,E_{\textrm{out}}=\beta\,E_{\textrm{out}}&lt;/math&gt; (4)

where &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of the output voltage of the control amplifier returned to its negative input; namely the feedback factor:

:&lt;math&gt; \beta=\frac{Z_2}{Z_1+Z_2} &lt;/math&gt;.

Combining Eqs. (1) and (4) yields Eq. (6):

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{E_{\textrm r}}{E_{\textrm i}}=\frac{\beta\,A}{1+\beta\,A} &lt;/math&gt;. (6)

When the quantity &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt;  becomes very large with respect to one, Eq.  (6) reduces to Eq. (7), which is one of the negative feedback equations:

:&lt;math&gt; E_{\textrm i}=E_{\textrm r} &lt;/math&gt;. (7)

Eq. (7) proves that the control amplifier works to keep the voltage between the reference and the working close to the input source voltage.

== Software control ==
Replacing the CA, a control algorithm can maintain a constant voltage &lt;math&gt;E_{\textrm c}&lt;/math&gt; between the reference electrode and the working electrode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Siegert | first1 = M. | year = 2018 | title = A scalable multi-channel software potentiostat | url = https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenrg.2018.00131/full | journal = [[Frontiers in Energy Research]] | volume = 6 | page = 131 | doi = 10.3389/fenrg.2018.00131 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This algorithm is based on the [[rule of proportion]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{U_{\textrm m}}{E_{\textrm c}} = \frac{U_{\textrm n}}{E_{\textrm {SP}}} &lt;/math&gt;. (8)

:*''&lt;math&gt;U_{\textrm m}&lt;/math&gt;'' is the last measured cell voltage between the working electrode (WE) and the counter electrode (CE).
:*''&lt;math&gt;E_{\textrm c}&lt;/math&gt;'' is the last measured electrochemical potential, i.e. the voltage between the reference electrode and WE to be kept constant.
:*''&lt;math&gt;U_{\textrm n}&lt;/math&gt;'' is the next cell voltage to be set, i.e. the controller output.
:*''&lt;math&gt;E_{\textrm {SP}}&lt;/math&gt;'' is the [[Setpoint (control system)|setpoint]], i.e. the desired &lt;math&gt;E_{\textrm c}&lt;/math&gt;.

If the measurement intervals of Eq. (8) are kept constant, the control algorithm sets the cell voltage &lt;math&gt;U_{\textrm m}&lt;/math&gt; so to keep &lt;math&gt;E_{\textrm c}&lt;/math&gt; as close as possible to the setpoint &lt;math&gt;E_{\textrm {SP}}&lt;/math&gt;. The algorithm requires software-controllable hardware such as a [[digital multimeter]], a [[power supply]], and a double-pull double-though [[relay]]. The relay is necessary to switch polarity.

== Significant features ==
In electrochemical experiments the electrodes are the pieces of equipment that comes in immediate contact with the [[analyte]].   For this reason the electrodes are very important for determining the experimental result.  The electrode surface may or may not catalyze chemical reactions.  The size of the electrodes affects the magnitude of the currents passed which can affect signal to noise.  But electrodes are not the only limiting factor for electrochemical experiments, the potentiostat also has a limited range of operation.  The following are a few significant features that vary between instruments.
 
*''Electric potential range (measured and applied)'': while the potential window is mostly based on the solvent window the electronics can also limit the possible range.
*''Accuracy in potential (measured and applied)'': limits of deviations between the actual and reported.
*''Range of scan rate'': how slow or fast a  potential window can be scanned this is most important for experiments that require high scan rates such as those involving [[ultramicroelectrode]]s.
*''Sample rate'': the rate at which potential or voltage can be accurately sampled.  This can be important for experiments that need high scan rates such as those involving ultramicroelectrodes.
*''File size'':  a limiting factor can be the file size limit.  This would most likely affect the choice of the potential range swept or the potential sample rate.
*''Electric current range (measured and applied)'': the maximum range over which current can be sampled.  Applying large currents is important for experiments that pass a great deal of current like a large [[bulk electrolysis]].  Measuring small currents is important for experiments that pass small currents like those involving ultramicroelectrodes.
*''Current resolution'': determines the operational range of a specific experiment and the bit resolution of that data in the current dimension.
*''Accuracy in current (measured and applied)'': limits of deviations between the actual and reported.
*''Number of working channels'': how many [[working electrode]]s can the instrument control.  A ''bipotentiostat'' is necessary to controlling systems with two working electrodes like a [[rotating ring-disk electrode]].  A ''polypotentiostat'' may be important for controlling some biological experiments with three or more working electrodes.
*''Footprint'': potentiostats include small devices of about 20 x 10 x 5&amp;nbsp;cm weighing well under a kilogram or a simple board that can be installed in a desktop computer.  A large bench-top model would be on the order of 50 x 20 x 10&amp;nbsp;cm and weigh up to or more than 5 kilograms.
*''Interface'': can the instrument run independently or must they be slaved to a personal computer.
*''Sweep generator'': can the system apply an analogue sweep or does it use a digital staircase generator as an approximation.  If it does use a digital staircase then the resolution of the staircase is important.
*''Rotating electrode'': can the instrument operate a rotating electrode.  This is intrinsic for experiments that require a [[rotating disk electrode]] or [[rotating ring-disk electrode]].

While the traditional process analysis and a set of [[teaching|instructions]] are both organized chronologically, the reader of a process analysis is typically interested in understanding the chronological components of a system that operates largely without the reader's direct actions (such as how the body digests an apple), while the reader of a set of instructions intends to use the instructions in order to accomplish a specific, limited task (such as how to bake an apple pie). By contrast, the reader of a [[mechanism description]] is more interested in an object in space (such as the form and nutritional value of a particular kind of apple).

'''Project Alpha''' is an academic research project working to counter [[nuclear proliferation]]-related trade. It was founded in 2011 with funding from the British Government and is housed in the Centre for Science and Security Studies at [[King's College London]]. &lt;ref name=College&gt;{{cite web|title=King's College London|url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/departments/warstudies/research/groups/csss/alpha/About-Alpha.aspx|publisher=Kcl.ac.uk|accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its primary mission is to publish independent research findings on illicit trade activities and to support the private and the public sectors with the implementation of international trade controls in order to deter the proliferation of [[nuclear weapons]]. 

Project Alpha has three main strands of work: understanding illicit trade, countering illicit trade and supporting international efforts of non-proliferation. This includes conducting research of proliferation-related case studies for publication on the Alpha website promoting industry engagement with authorities and providing training and consultancy to businesses in order to encourage good practices of compliance with international regulations governing the export of sensitive goods and technologies.&lt;ref name="Project Alpha"&gt;{{cite web|title=Project Alpha|url=https://www.projectalpha.eu/|publisher=projectalpha.eu|accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also supports the work of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] and the implementation of relevant [[UN Security Council resolutions]], including [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540]], aimed at preventing  the spread of [[weapons of mass destruction]] to non-state actors, and sanctions resolutions adopted against [[Iran]] and [[North Korea]]. 

From September 2015, Project Alpha has been central to the EU's outreach program on dual-use export controls (the EU's P2P program on dual-use goods). &lt;ref&gt;https://export-control.jrc.ec.europa.eu/Home/Dual-use-trade-control&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 Project Alpha published a report on Pakistan's nuclear weapons program which identified a large number of front companies and a suspected new uranium enrichment facility.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.ihsmarkit.com/press-release/aerospace-defense-security/new-construction-pakistans-khan-research-laboratories-consi&lt;/ref&gt; The report received a great deal of media attention, particularly in South Asia.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.dailypakistan.com.pk/business/sassi-organises-discussion-on-export-controls/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''RioCard''' (''Bilhete Único'') is a [[smartcard]] system used in the transport system of [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro state]], [[Brazil]]. The card is contactless and uses [[MIFARE]] technology. It is a form of electronic payment produced and distributed by the Fetranspor company, in cooperation with [[Itaú]] bank. Its installation was seen as strengthening Brazil's connection with the  [[CIPURSE|Open Standard for Public Transport]] (OSPT) Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20140623006004/en/RioCard-TI-Strengthens-OSPT-Alliance-Position-Brazil#.VBxbYhbNKaI|title=RioCard TI Strengthens OSPT Alliance Position in Brazil|date=23 June 2014|work=businesswire.com|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2013, Rio de Janeiro launched a trial run for this ticket to be run on smartphones, using [[near field communication]] (NFC) technology. Around 200 users of the ticket on buses, trains and ferries were selected for the trial, which involves putting a Motorola Razr D3 within a few inches of the reader terminal. Users can then check the balance of their card. Soon,{{When|date=May 2015}} one will be able to prepay fares by using one's phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rio de Janeiro launches pilot for public transportation NFC ticketing with smartphones|url=http://www.gemalto.com/php/pr_view.php?id=1688#.Up6xpyfw-RN|publisher=gemalto.com|accessdate=4 December 2013|date=18 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rio de Janeiro launches pilot for public transportation NFC ticketing|url=http://www.rfid-ready.com/201311118478/rio-de-janeiro-launches-pilot-for-public-transportation-nfc-ticketing.html|publisher=http://www.rfid-ready.com|accessdate=4 December 2013|date=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conventional transportation (Transporte Convencional) ==

Created for commuters (home-work-home), this card can be requested over the Internet or in person and is free of charge, with the minimum credits value of R$40.00 (approximately US $17&lt;ref name="x-rates.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.x-rates.com/calculator/?from=BRL&amp;to=USD&amp;amount=40|title=Currency Calculator (Brazilian Real, US Dollar) - X-Rates|work=x-rates.com|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;). This card can be used for any mode of transportation (bus, ferry, subway, train) but can only be used once per trip at a maximum of eight times per day. Requests to add value to the card can only be done online or in RioCard stores, or in RioCard ATMs. Use of the card is limited to the city in which the card was activated or used at least three times in the past 30 days.

== Rapid transit (Transporte Rápido) ==
This card is intended for infrequent commutes or people who want to acquire their card more quickly. It is sold at [[Unibanco]] locations and can only be purchased with cash. It can be loaded with only fixed amounts of  R$40 or R$80 (approximately US $17 or US $34&lt;ref name="x-rates.com"/&gt;) and cannot be re-loaded; repeat users must purchase a new card once the balance is zero or the remaining credit is insufficient for passage. This card is only intended for use on the most inexpensive form of transportation available. Use in other modes of transportation will require complementary payment in another form. It can be used toward any mode of transportation (bus, ferry, subway, train) but can only be used once per trip at a maximum of eight times per day.

== Express (Expresso) ==
This monetary card is intended for passengers who want more flexibility for their transport options. It is accepted on buses, ferries, and [[SuperVia]] trains but it is only accepted on subways if the RioCard (Bilhete Único) is activated. Express cards are available for purchase at Itaú locations, banks, pharmacies, and online. Cards come pre-filled with either R$40 or R$80 and value can be re-added online on a card with a zero balance or with insufficient funds for passage. This card is only intended for use on the most inexpensive form of transportation available. Use in other modes of transportation will require complementary payment in another form.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cartaoriocard.com.br/scrcpr/geral/expresso.jsp]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Integrated (Integração)==
[[File:Metro Rio 01 2013 5414.JPG|thumbnail|Integrated bus/Metro line in Rio de Janeiro city]]
Created exclusively for commuters who travel using multiple modes of transportation and don't possess other forms of the RioCard, the integrated card allows the combination of several modes of transit into one route. This card can be used in up to three kinds of transportation while only deducting a single, fixed price.

Route options include:
* Integrated Route A: Trem &gt; Municipal bus in Rio de Janeiro (from the stations below)
* Integrated Route AB: Barca Cocotá &gt; Municipal bus in Rio de Janeiro (from Cocotá station)
* Integrated Route AC: Barca Niterói &gt; Municipal bus in Rio de Janeiro (from Niterói station)
* Integrated Route AD: Trem &gt; Bus in the Baixada Fluminense (from the stations below)
* Integrated Bus-Bus to Niterói: The use of two buses is permitted in the city of Niterói

Bus lines include: Central, São Cristovão, Cascadura, Madureira, Mercadão de Madureira, Nova Iguaçu, Belford Roxo, Bangu, Campo Grande and Santa Cruz

== Special passengers (Passe Especial) ==
* '''Students''': Service is provided for public school students in the city of Rio de Janeiro (the city of Rio does not provide service for students enrolled in other institutions), and as long as they are wearing a school uniform, the card permits their passage at no cost. This service is suspended when school is not in session and when students cease to be enrolled.
*  '''Senior citizens''': Service is provided for the elderly (those above the age of 65) without limitation and their right to free passage is legally mandated and protected.
* '''Disabled''': Service is also provided without charge to those with chronic illnesses or physical disabilities.

== Single ticket (Bilhete Único) in the state of Rio de Janeiro==
On December 29, 2009, Law 5628 established the [[Bilhete Único]] in the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro. The "Bilhete Único RJ" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cartaoriocard.com.br/scrcpr/geral/bilhete_unico.jsp|title=Sobre o Cartão Bilhete Único Intermunicipal|work=cartaoriocard.com.br|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; costs R$5.25 (US $2.19) and allows the purchaser to utilize up to two different modes of transportation—bus,van, train, ferry, or subway—within three hours as long as one of them is "integrated" with other municipalities. This program also benefits those using inter-municipal transportation that costs more than the standard fare. The Bilhete Único RJ can be incorporated with any form of the RioCard. Purchase of the Bilhete Único RJ can be made at any ticketing area for trains, subways, and ferries, as well as in Fetranspor locations and Loja Virtual do Bilhete Único RJ. However, the Bilhete Único RJ cannot be used immediately after purchase. Activation requires a verification of the user's [[Cadastro de Pessoas Físicas|CPF]] and 48 hours before it is enabled. Air-conditioned buses are not included in this program.

==Bilhete Único Carioca (Carioca Single ticket)==
The Bilhete Único Carioca &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cartaoriocard.com.br/scrcpr/geral/bu_carioca.jsp|title=Sobre o Cartão Bilhete Único de Carioca|work=cartaoriocard.com.br|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; offers a rate that "integrates" the use of two municipal bus lines within the city of Rio de Janeiro. Users can ride up to two municipal buses within two hours for R$3.00 (US $1.25). The card can be used on municipal bus lines within the city of Rio de Janeiro operated by: Internorte, Intersul, Transcarioca e Santa Cruz. Air-conditioned buses are not included in this program. For trips that are not integrated, the card can be used without restriction, enabling the user to pay for various passages on the same vehicle and the normal fare will be discounted. It can be used in any bus line within the state of Rio de Janeiro, regardless of the cost of the fare.

== Bilhete Único Niterói (Single ticket Niterói) ==
According to the Law 2851 enacted in 2011, the Bilhete Único Niterói &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cartaoriocard.com.br/scrcpr/geral/bu_niteroi.jsp]&lt;/ref&gt; offers a discounted rate for the integration of municipal buses in the city of [[Niterói]]. The electronic card allows users to ride up to two municipal buses within two hours for R$3.90 (US $1.25). Return trips should be made at a minimum of two hours after the card is first scanned in order to utilize the discounted rate. This card can only be used two times per day. Since 2012 air-conditioned buses are included in this program. If used two times in a row on the same bus line, the card will be debited two normal fares. It is now accepted in other modes of transportation, including the Ferry and the Rio de Janeiro Subway.

'''Sensibo''' is a manufacturer of air conditioning controllers.

== History ==
Sensibo was founded in November 2013 by Omer Enbar and Ran Roth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nocamels.com/2014/05/meet-sensibo-the-aircon-attachment-that-will-make-you-feel-so-cool/ |title=Meet Sensibo: The Attachment That Will Revolutionize Your Aircon |publisher=nocamels.com |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea originated around 2004 when Omer Enbar had built a personal control system to activate his air conditioner via email prior to biking home from work. The system connected an [[IR blaster]] to a laptop that would send a signal to the AC every time he sent an email with the title "AC on" or "AC off".

During 2013, Omer Enbar and Ran Roth manually built and deployed several prototypes to friends and family. They later proceeded to found the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/07/sensibo-will-give-your-air-conditioners-nest-like-intelligence-and-remote-control/ |title=Sensibo Will Give Your Air Conditioners Nest-Like Intelligence And Remote Control |publisher=techcrunch.com |accessdate=2015-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crowdfunding and Video ==
In May 2014, Sensibo launched a successful crowdfunding campaign on [[Indiegogo]]. The campaign has raised $165,000 in July 20, 2014. Its campaign video was later selected by Indiegogo as the funniest pitch video of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://go.indiegogo.com/blog/2015/01/five-funniest-pitch-videos-2014.html |title=Five funniest pitch video of 2014 |publisher=go.indiegogo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video, created by Tross Media and starring Michael Harpaz, has been often compared to [[Dollar Shave Club]]  and the TV series [[House of Cards (U.S. TV series)|House of Cards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/2658pt/make_any_air_conditioner_smart_sensibo_251/ |title=Make any air conditioner smart - Sensibo |publisher=reddit.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Product Launches ==
Sensibo delivered on its crowdfunding campaign during the summer of 2015, shipping thousands of units worldwide, according to the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.sensibo.com/2015/04/20/sensibo-is-coming |title=Sensibo is coming |publisher=sensibo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2015, Sensibo launched an [[IFTTT]] channel, allowing its system to interface with other apps and devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.ifttt.com/post/118871348243/introducing-the-sensibo-channel |title=Introducing the Sensibo Channel |publisher=blog.ifttt.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The devices are being distributed in many countries.&lt;ref name=Nagubandi&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nagubandi|first1=Ayyappa|title=Stay sensibly cool this summer|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/stay-sensibly-cool-this-summer-with-sensibo/article7077760.ece|accessdate=12 August 2015|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|date=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nield&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nield|first1=David|title=How to Turn on Your AC Before You Even Walk In the Door|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/home/interior-projects/how-to/a16345/how-to-make-your-air-conditioner-smart/|accessdate=12 August 2015|publisher=[[Popular Mechanics]]|date=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017 the company launched its 2nd generation device, Sensibo Sky. Features include: 7-day scheduling, Location based on/off, Multiple users controlling a single device, integration with [[Amazon Echo]] and [[IFTTT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sensibo.com/pages/learn-more|title=Learn More|website=Sensibo|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4408">A '''stressed member engine''' is a [[Internal combustion engine|vehicle engine]] used as an active [[structural element]] of the [[chassis]] to transmit forces and torques, rather than being passively contained by the chassis with [[anti-vibration mount]]s. [[Automotive engineering|Automotive engineers]] use the method for weight reduction and mass centralization in [[vehicle]]s. Applications are found in several vehicles where mass reduction is critical for performance reasons, usually after several iterations of conventional frame/chassis designs have been employed.

==Applications==

{{further|Motorcycle frame#Engine as a stressed member}}
Stressed member engines was patented in 1900 by Joah ("John") Carver Phelon and his nephew Harry Rayner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ianchadwick.com/motorcycles/triumph/time01.html ianchadwick.com] Ian Chadwick ''1901'' (Retrieved 28 October 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; and were pioneered at least as early as the 1916 Harley-Davidson 8-valve racer, and incorporated in the production [[Harley-Davidson Model W]] by 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Rafferty| first = Tod| title = Illustrated Directory of Harley-Davidson Motorcycles| year=2001 | publisher = MotorBooks International | isbn = 0-7603-1126-9 | pages = 59, 64&amp;ndash;67 | url = https://books.google.com.jm/books?id=NPElj2hU3pgC&amp;pg=PA64}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique was developed in the 20th century by [[Vincent Motorcycles|Vincent]] and others, and by the end of the century was common feature of chassis built by [[Ducati]], [[BMW Motorcycles|BMW]] and others.

===Automobiles===
Many [[Mid-engine design|mid-engine]] [[Sports car|sport cars]] have used stressed engine design.

====Race cars====
The 1967 [[Lotus 49]] is credited for establishing a solution copied by "everyone" in [[Formula One]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|journal=Road and Track|url=http://www.roadandtrack.com/features/magazine/fast-present-future-64-8-roa0513|date=May 2013|title=Fast, Present, Future: 1967 Lotus 49 vs. 2013 Corvette ZR1|author=John Krewson |accessdate=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This requirement is cited as a reason the rules committee changed from an inline-four to a V-6 configuration for the 2014 Formula One season.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.f1technical.net/news/16406|title=Team bosses agree on 1.6l V6 for 2014|publisher=f1technical.net|date=June 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Production automobiles====
The limited-production [[De Tomaso Vallelunga]] mid-engine car prototyped in 1963 used the engine as a stressed member.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|journal=[[European Car]]|date=February 2009|title=De Tomaso Vallelunga: Just the beginning for Alexjandro|url=http://www.europeancarweb.com/features/0502ec_de_tomaso_vallelunga/|publisher=[[Source Interlink]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In GM's Chevrolet Bolt and Tesla Motors [[Tesla Model S|Model S]] and [[Tesla Roadster (2008)|Roadster]] electric cars, the battery pack is a stressed member to increase rigidity.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|journal=Motor Trend|date=December 2012|author=Frank Markus|url=http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/alternative/1206_2012_tesla_model_s_first_drive|title=First Drive: 2012 Tesla Model S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Plug-in Electric Car Buyers Buying Guide|author=Steve E.

The [[Fordson tractor]] Model F, designed during World War I, eliminated the frame to reduce cost of materials and assembly, and was probably influenced by the similar design of the 1913 [[Massey Ferguson#Wallis Gas Tractor|Wallis]] Cub.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| first= Lee| last=Klancher | first2=Randy | last2=Leffingwell | first3=Andrew | last3=Morland | first4=Robert N. | last4= Pripps | title= Farm Tractors: John Deere, Farmall, Ford &amp; Fordson | year=2003 | publisher= Crestline Imprints | isbn= 0-7603-1776-3 |page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''This Week in Tech'''''–casually referred to as '''''TWiT''''', and briefly known as '''''Revenge of the Screen Savers'''''–is the weekly flagship [[podcast]] and namesake of the [[TWiT.tv (network)|TWiT.tv network]].  It is hosted by [[Leo Laporte]] and many other former [[TechTV]] employees and currently produced by Karsten Bondy. It features round-table discussions and debates surrounding current [[technology]] news and reviews, with a particular focus on [[consumer electronics]] and the [[Internet]]. TWiT is produced in the TWiT "eastside" studios in [[Petaluma, California]], United States, as of 27 August 2016, a few miles away from the former "brickhouse" studios where it was produced for 5 years, and earlier TWiT "cottage", where it was produced for over 6 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twit.tv/shows/twit-live-specials/episodes/297 |title=TWIT LIVE SPECIALS 297 MOVING DAY! |publisher=Twit.Tv |date= |accessdate=2016-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://twit.tv/specials87 |title=TWiT Live Specials 87 |publisher=Twit.Tv |date= |accessdate=2012-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The podcast is streamed live on Sundays at 3:00 P.M. [[Pacific Standard Time|PST]].

==Format==
Following the show's number, title, sponsors and theme tune, Leo Laporte typically begins an episode of ''TWiT'' by introducing the week's panelists, allowing each of them to discuss his or her recent projects or work. The main portion of the show consists of a round-table discussion and debate, pegged loosely to a selection of the week's major technology headlines. The format of the show encourages spontaneity and the conversation often diverges wildly from technology topics. This causes the length of each episode to vary, sometimes considerably, from show to show, although most episodes run approximately two hours. Each episode typically features three or four commercial breaks, usually in the form of a "live read" from Laporte that may include interaction with the panelists (e.g., Laporte usually prompts guests for recommended [[audiobook]]s during spots for frequent advertiser [[Audible.com]]). The show closes with each panelist giving a personal "plug" for their affiliated website or Twitter account.

==Panelists==
The most frequently recurring guests on TWiT include [[John C. Dvorak]], [[Patrick Norton]], [[Wil Harris]], [[Kevin Rose]], [[Robert Heron (presenter)|Robert Heron]], [[David Prager]], [[Tom Merritt]], [[Roger Chang]], [[Dwight Silverman]] and [[Jason Calacanis]]. Other guests include [[Becky Worley]], [[Steve Gibson (computer programmer)|Steve Gibson]], [[Xeni Jardin]], [[Alex Lindsay]], [[Owen Stone]], [[Veronica Belmont]] and [[Molly Wood]].

The show has had a number of famous guests, including [[Steve Wozniak]], [[Kevin Mitnick]], [[John Hodgman]], [[Lawrence Lessig]], artist [[Roger McGuinn]], as well as ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' cast members [[LeVar Burton]] ([[Geordi La Forge]]) and [[Wil Wheaton]] ([[Wesley Crusher]]).

In September 2015, Leo Laporte famously "banned" his long-time friend and frequent TWiT guest [[John C. Dvorak]] from the show for various comments Dvorak made on Twitter.&lt;ref name=JCD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nag.billhutchison.org/banned-why-i-was-fired-from-twit/|title=Unceremoniously fired by Leo for tweeting. The real explanation.|publisher=John C. Dvorak|accessdate=15 Dec 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reply to Dvorak's comments that Laporte was biased, Laporte told Dvorak "you won't ever have to worry about it again&lt;ref name=laporte&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?in_reply_to=647423221227130880&amp;ref_src=twsrc^tfw&amp;original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Ftotaldrama.net%2F2015%2F09%2Fleo-laporte-bans-john-c-dvorak-from-twit-for-expressing-his-opinions-elsewhere%2F&amp;tw_p=tweetembed|title=Laporte: Reply to a Tweet|publisher=Twitter|author=Leo Laporte|accessdate=15 Dec 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;", insinuating that he never wanted Dvorak back on TWiT. Laporte apologized a few days later,&lt;ref name=td&gt;{{cite web|url=https://totaldrama.net/2015/09/leo-laporte-bans-john-c-dvorak-from-twit-for-expressing-his-opinions-elsewhere/|title=Leo Laporte Bans John C. Dvorak from TWiT for Expressing His Opinions Elsewhere|publisher=Leica Lens|accessdate=15 Dec 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but continued to berate Dvorak publicly. Dvorak has yet to return to the show.

==History==
The program began when Laporte recorded a one-off round-table discussion between himself, Patrick Norton, Sarah Norton, Kevin Rose, David Prager, and Roger Chang at the 2005 [[Macworld Conference &amp; Expo|Macworld Expo]] in San Francisco.

After publishing the show on his blog to an enthusiastic public reception, Laporte decided to rename this discussion "episode 0" and turned the round-table concept into a weekly downloadable audio file, or "[[podcast]]," featuring more cast members from his former [[TechTV]] program ''[[The Screen Savers]]''. The first episode was posted on Monday, April 18, 2005 as ''Revenge of the Screen Savers'', but it was temporarily renamed "Return of the [BEEP]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twit.tv/2 |title=this WEEK in TECH 2 |publisher=Twit.Tv |date= |accessdate=2012-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and shortly thereafter changed in response to a [[cease and desist]] letter sent to Laporte from [[Comcast]], owners of TechTV's intellectual property rights, arguing it too closely resembled the defunct show's name.  (TWiT started using the Screen Savers trademark after Comcast allowed it to expire, and ''[[The New Screen Savers]]'' was launched as a separate weekly program on May 2, 2015.) In episode 2, Laporte announced a contest in which listeners could suggest a new name for the show.  One listener suggested ''This Week in Geek'', which inspired Laporte to create the eventual name, ''This Week in Tech'', or ''TWiT''.

The weekly show was originally recorded with all of the hosts staying at their respective homes and talking via [[Voice over IP]] (mostly using [[Skype]]). Starting around episode 10, Norton began physically coming to Leo's Petaluma office during the taping.  Upon Rose's announcement that he was moving to [[San Francisco]], Laporte started to gather the panelists for public live tapings in the San Francisco area, with most episodes being videotaped and released as a video podcast download.

During the fall of 2005, several of the previously regular hosts began to move on to other projects, resulting in the format of the show changing from being a show with a core group of hosts and occasional guests, into Laporte being the only regular host, and inviting in a variety of different guests each show. Around the same time, the people responsible for filming the shows, the [[Pixel Corps]] and their leader, [[Alex Lindsay]] became more involved with the show, with many also contributing.

During the first few years TWiT episodes were made available in a variety of file formats for individual download or RSS subscription. These included a standard 64&amp;nbsp;kbit/s [[MP3]], a low-bandwidth 16&amp;nbsp;kbit/s MP3, [[Advanced Audio Coding]] (AAC), and open source [[Ogg Vorbis]]. However, the Ogg Vorbis version of the show ceased to be offered in August 2009 with the AAC and low bandwidth MP3 versions ending in early November 2009. In response, Leo Laporte stated that he was a believer that his content should be made available to the widest audience possible in the format of their choice, as well as philosophically agreeing with the open source nature of Ogg Vorbis. However the time and effort the TWiT Staff needed to encode, upload, and distribute alternate audio formats in the limited time between recording and release each Sunday evening was not justified by the number of people choosing to listen to them.

The show recording is usually posted every Sunday evening.

==Awards==
As well as being ranked #1 on Podcast Alley, [[Yahoo Podcasts]], and the [[iTunes]] Podcast Directory (where it averages around 315,000 downloads a week), ''TWiT'' has also won two [[Podcast Awards]], as both the "People's Choice" and as "Best Technology Podcast". This Week in Tech also made [[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine's]] Top 10 Podcasts of 2006, ranked 9th.&lt;ref name="podcastaward"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/topten/2006/podcasts/09.html | work=Time | title=Top 10 Everything 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="9th rank in Podcasts from Time Magazine"&gt;{{Cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;
It also won Podcast of the Year from the 2007 Weblog Awards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://2007.weblogawards.org/polls/best-podcast-1.php Best Podcast - The 2007 Weblog Awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Video==
TWiT began as an audio podcast, although several video episodes were filmed in the first few years of the show. Starting in 2008, the show was made available for live streaming in both audio and video formats. Since episode 215 in October 2009, the show has been available weekly as both an audio and video download as well as on YouTube.

==Distribution and licensing==
All episodes are licensed under the [[Creative Commons]] attribution [[share-alike]] noncommercial [[Creative Commons License|license]], and are distributed via direct download from the TWiT.tv website, from [[Apple Computer|Apple]]'s [[iTunes Store]], or as a subscription on any device with the necessary internet connection and podcasting software. There is no charge to download current or past shows.

The show is typically available in three formats: 64 [[kilobit per second|kbit/s]] [[MP3]], 32 kbit/s MP3, and 64 kbit/s [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]]. Occasionally, other bitrates are used for episodes produced in [[stereo]], however most episodes are [[monaural]]. The files are available as direct downloads, with bandwidth provided by [[Cachefly]]. On 23 February 2014, before recording TWiT 446, Laporte stated that episode bandwidth for the entire network is around 950 terabytes per month.

A sponsorship deal with [[America Online]] was announced on July 4, 2005, following the server demand that resulted from the release of [[iTunes#Recent version history|iTunes 4.9]]'s built-in podcasting directory. Since the new TWiT website was launched, the TWiT Torrent server initially preferred by Laporte has ceased operation. In several episodes, Laporte has noted that the distributed nature of [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] makes it impossible to accurately gauge the popularity of the show, decreasing the likelihood of attracting advertisers. As of episode 174, TWiT began being hosted from AOL Radio.&lt;ref name="TWiT 174"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aolradio.podcast.aol.com/twit/TWiT0174H.mp3 |title=TWiT 174 |date= |accessdate=2012-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  AOL hosting ended in the summer of 2013.

==Funding==
Laporte stated in episode 3 that the show would always remain free and without advertising. However, due to ongoing costs as a result of TWiT.tv's constant expansion, a roadmap for the introduction of podcast and web-based advertising was announced during episode 45 of This WEEK in TECH. On 5 September 2006, TWiT.tv officially became one of the first major advertising-supported podcast networks, sponsored initially by both [[Visa (company)|Visa]] and [[Dell]].

Listeners have always been invited to support the network by means of an automatic PayPal subscription or one-time payment. In the past, this granted access to an exclusive TWiT forum which no longer exists, yet donations are still accepted.  Listener funding has been used for the operational costs of the network including improvements to Laporte's recording studio and to purchase radio-quality microphones and digital audio-recording devices for the hosts.  Financial compensation for the network mostly comes from the network's sponsors.  Sponsors of the network include Ford, Audible, Lantronix, Squarespace, Hulu, Rackspace, Hover, Carbonite, Stamps.com and more.

Before recording started for This Week in Tech 268 on 3 October 2010, while discussing the sale of [[TechCrunch]] to [[AOL]], Laporte mentioned that his network would "do three to four [million {{US$}}]" in advertising revenue for 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[[Justin.tv]] video broadcast, [http://live.twit.tv/ TWiT Live], 15:01 PDT Sunday 3 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the increase in the number of sponsored programs as well as the increase in sponsors, the 2013 gross revenue is estimated{{by whom|date=April 2015}} to be in the eight million dollar range.  This Week in Tech Episode 561 on 5/08/2016 had extensive talk about podcast revenue.  In the episode, Leo Laporte said a recent NY York Times article stated that podcasts ad revenue was $57 million per year and "If that's true, than I actually own 25% of all of the podcasting revenue in the world." This would put TWIT ad revenue around $13–14 million per year.&lt;ref&gt;https://twit.tv/shows/this-week-in-tech/episodes/561?autostart=false&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4375">In [[computer science]], a '''Uniform Resource Characteristic''' ('''URC''') is a [[character string (computer science)|string]] of [[character (computing)|character]]s representing the [[metadata]] of a [[Uniform Resource Identifier|Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)]], a string identifying a [[Web resource]]. A URC binds a URI's associated [[Uniform Resource Name|Uniform Resource Name (URN)]], a unique name for a Web resource, to its [[Uniform Resource Locator|Uniform Resource Locator (URL)]], the location at which a Web resource can be found. &lt;ref name="scenarios"&gt;{{cite web|first1=Ron Jr.|last1=Daniel|first2=Michael|last2=Mealling|authorlink2=Michael Mealling|title=URC Scenarios and Requirements|date=27 March 1995|publisher=[[IETF]]|url=//tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-uri-urc-req-01|accessdate=2013-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; URCs were proposed as a [[specification (technical standard)|specification]] in the mid-1990s, but were never adopted.

The use of a URC would allow the location of a Web resource to be obtained from its standard name, via the use of a [[Resolver (DNS)|resolving service]].&lt;ref name="scenarios" /&gt; It was also to be possible to obtain a URC from a URN by the use of a resolving service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=IETF URI Working Group|title=URN to URC resolution scenario|date=14 April 1994|publisher=[[IETF]]|url=//tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-uri-urn2urc-00|accessdate=2013-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design goals of URCs were that they should be simple to use, easy to extend, and compatible with a wide range of technological systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Michael|last=Mealling|authorlink=Michael Mealling|title=Encoding and Use of Uniform Resource Characteristics|date=8 July 1994|publisher=[[IETF]]|url=//tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-uri-urc-spec-00|accessdate=2013-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The URC syntax was intended to be easily understood by both humans and software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Paul E.|last1=Hoffman|first2=Ron Jr.|last2=Daniel|title=Trivial URC Syntax: urc0|publisher=[[IETF]]|date=21 April 1995|url=//tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-uri-urc-trivial-00|accessdate=2013-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
During the early to mid-1990s, basic Web technologies were still in their infancy. Naming documents was, according to [[Tim Berners-Lee]], the inventor of the Web, "probably the most crucial aspect of design and standardization in an open [[hypertext]] system".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Berners-Lee|first=Tim|authorlink=Tim Berners-Lee|year=1991|title=Design Issues for the World Wide Web: Document Naming|url=http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Naming.html|accessdate=2013-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most discussion, naming was partitioned into location (URLs) and identification (URNs) as independent applications of an URI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Michael|last=Mealling|authorlink=Michael Mealling|title=Specification of Uniform Resource Characteristics|date=5 April 1994|publisher=[[IETF]]|url=//tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-uri-urc-00|accessdate=2013-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; URCs were a third identifier type, intended to provide a standardized representation of document properties, such as owner, encoding, access restrictions or cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Karen|last1=Sollins|first2=Larry|last2=Masinter|title=Functional Requirements for Uniform Resource Names|date=December 1994|publisher=[[IETF]]|url=//tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1737|accessdate=2013-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

URCs were the subject of an [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] working group around 1994/1995. However, the working group never produced a final standard and URCs were never widely adopted in practice. Even so, the concepts on which URCs were based influenced subsequent technologies such as the [[Dublin Core]] and [[Resource Description Framework]].

'''Viewdata''' is a [[Videotex]] implementation.  It is a type of [[information retrieval]] service in which a [[subscriber]] can [[Access control|access]] a remote [[database]] via a [[common carrier]] [[Communication channel|channel]], request [[data]] and receive requested data on a [[video]] display over a separate channel. [[Samuel Fedida]], who had the idea for Viewdata in 1968, was credited as inventor of the system. The first prototype became operational in 1974. The access, request and reception are usually via common carrier broadcast channels.  This is in contrast with [[teletext]].

==Technology==
Originally Viewdata was accessed with a special purpose [[Computer terminal|terminal]] (or [[Emulator|emulation software]]) and a [[modem]] running at [[ITU-T]] [[V.23]] speed (1200 bit/s down, 75 bit/s up). By 2004 it was normally accessed over [[TCP/IP]] using Viewdata [[client software]] on a [[personal computer]] running [[Microsoft Windows]], or using a Web-based emulator.

As of 2015, Viewdata was still in use in the [[United Kingdom]], mainly by the [[travel industry]]. [[Travel agent]]s use it to look up the price and availability of [[package holiday]]s and [[Commercial aviation|flight]]s. Once they find what the customer is looking for they can place a booking. 

There are a number of factors still holding up a move to a [[World Wide Web|Web]]-based standard. Viewdata is regarded within the industry as low-cost and reliable, travel consultants have been trained to use Viewdata and would need training to book holidays on the Internet, and [[tour operator]]s cannot agree on a Web-based standard.

==Bulletin board systems==
It was made in the late 1970s and early 1980s to make it easier for travel consultants to check availability and make bookings for holidays.
A number of Viewdata [[bulletin board system]]s existed in the 1980s, predominantly in the UK due to the proliferation of the [[BBC Micro]], and a short-lived ''Viewdata Revival'' appeared in the late 1990s fuelled by the [[retrocomputing]] vogue. Some Viewdata boards still exist, with accessibility in the form of [[Java (Sun)|Java]] [[Telnet]] clients.

The term '''virtual patient''' is used to describe interactive [[computer simulation]]s used in [[health care]] [[Medical education|education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=JiSC|year=2009|title=Repurposing existing virtual patients|url=http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/programmes/elearningcapital/reproduce/revip.aspx|accessdate=2009-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The special focus is targeted on the simulation of clinical processes with virtual patients. Virtual patients combine scientific excellence, modern technologies and the innovative concept of [[game-based learning]]. Virtual patients allow the learner to take the role of a health care professional and develop clinical skills such as making diagnoses and therapeutic decisions.&lt;ref name=imison&gt;{{cite conference|vauthors=Imison M, Hughes C|year=2008|url=http://www.ascilite.org.au/conferences/melbourne/procs/imison.pdf|title=The virtual patient project: using low fidelity, student generated online case studies in medical education|conference=Hello? Where are you in the landscape of educational technology? Proceedings ascilite Melbourne 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virtual patients have also been considered computer-based simulations designed to complement clinical training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huang|first1=Grace|title=Virtual Patient Simulation at U.S. and Canadian Medical Schools|journal=Educational Strategies|date=May 2007|volume=82|issue=5|page=446|doi=10.1097/ACM.0b013e31803e8a0a|pmid=17457063}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of virtual patient programmes is increasing in healthcare, partly in response to increasing demands on health care professionals and education of students but also because they allow opportunity for students to practice in a safe environment.&lt;ref name=imison/&gt;
There are many different formats a virtual patient may take. However the overarching principle is that of [[interactivity]]—a virtual patient will have mechanisms for the learner to interact with the case and material or information is made available to the learner as they complete a range of learning activities. Interactivity is often included with questions, specific decision-making tasks, text-composition etc. and is [[Sequence (medicine)|non-sequential]]. Most systems provide quantitative and qualitative feedback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Sagae|first2=K|last3=John|first3=B|last4=Rizzo|first4=AA|date=2012|title=Sorting out the Virtual Patient|journal=International Journal of Gaming and Computer-Mediated Simulations|volume=4|issue=3|pages=1–19|doi=10.1373/clinchem.2011.176958|last1=Talbot|first1=TB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forms==
Virtual patients may take a number of different forms:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kononowicz|first=Andrzej A.|last2=Zary|first2=Nabil|last3=Edelbring|first3=Samuel|last4=Corral|first4=Janet|last5=Hege|first5=Inga|date=2015-02-01|title=Virtual patients - what are we talking about?

*''Case Presentation'': review of patient related cases to reinforce and apply primary medical concepts to real world situations.
*''Interactive Patient Scenario'': multimedia patient case designed to teach clinical reasoning skills such as diagnostic test ordering and interpretation.
*''Virtual Patient Game'': interactive clinical scenarios that take place in an entirely virtual world designed to practice team training in high risk situations (e.g. avatars within a virtual health facility).&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
*''Virtual Reality Scenarios'': virtual reality based training exercises to teach procedural skills in situations of varying complexities. (e.g. virtual reality surgical simulation).
*''High Fidelity Software Simulation'': computer programs designed to allow the mimicking of human physiological conditions for a variety of clinical scenarios.
*''High Fidelity Manikin'': realistic, programmable manikins that are capable of simulating a wide range of clinical scenarios; including simulating cardiac arrest, seizure, etc. complete with simulated, real-time vitals.&amp;nbsp;
*''Virtual Standardized Patient'': an artificially intelligent patient designed with natural language capabilities to assist in training provider-patient communication skills.

==Types of interactions==
A number of different modes of virtual patient delivery have been defined:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.medbiq.org/sites/default/files/files/ModelingVirtualPatientsandVirtualCases_meld.pdf | title=Modeling Virtual Patients and Virtual Cases | date=23 November 2004 | author=Rachel Ellaway}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Predetermined scenario [directed mode]
*The learner may build up the patient or case data from observations and interactions [blank mode]
*The learner may view and appraise or review an existing patient or scenario [critique mode or rehearsal mode]
*The VP may be used as a mechanism to address particular topics [context mode]
*The learner may use a scenario or patient to explore personal/professional dimensions [reflective mode]
*Banks of patients or scenarios may collectively address broad issues of healthcare [pattern mode]

==Possible benefits==
Virtual patients have been shown to be a time-efficient and cost-effective method of developing clinical reasoning skills in students through independent and repeated practice of physician tasks in a safe environment without the risk of harm to the patient or learner, which can significantly increase the mental pool of learned cases in students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stevens|first=Amy|last2=Hernandez|first2=Jonathan|last3=Johnsen|first3=Kyle|last4=Dickerson|first4=Robert|last5=Raij|first5=Andrew|last6=Harrison|first6=Cyrus|last7=DiPietro|first7=Meredith|last8=Allen|first8=Bryan|last9=Ferdig|first9=Richard|date=June 2006|title=The use of virtual patients to teach medical students history taking and communication skills|journal=American Journal of Surgery|volume=191|issue=6|pages=806–811|doi=10.1016/j.amjsurg.2006.03.002|issn=0002-9610|pmid=16720154}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cook|first=David A.|last2=Erwin|first2=Patricia J.|last3=Triola|first3=Marc M.|date=October 2010|title=Computerized virtual patients in health professions education: a systematic review and meta-analysis|journal=Academic Medicine|volume=85|issue=10|pages=1589–1602|doi=10.1097/ACM.0b013e3181edfe13|issn=1938-808X|pmid=20703150}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[Simulated patient|simulated]] or real patients, virtual patients can be accessed on demand, and the user may monitor a case over several months while spending less than an hour in real-time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Orton|first=Eric|last2=Mulhausen|first2=Paul|date=2008|title=E-learning virtual patients for geriatric education|journal=Gerontology &amp; Geriatrics Education|volume=28|issue=3|pages=73–88|doi=10.1300/J021v28n03_06|issn=0270-1960|pmid=18215989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, virtual patients can be endlessly replayable and can be easily modified to allow the user to explore different clinical scenarios and patient outcomes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Triola|first=Marc M.|last2=Campion|first2=Ned|last3=McGee|first3=James B.|last4=Albright|first4=Susan|last5=Greene|first5=Peter|last6=Smothers|first6=Valerie|last7=Ellaway|first7=Rachel|date=2007|title=An XML Standard for Virtual Patients: Exchanging Case-Based Simulations in Medical Education|journal=AMIA Annual Symposium Proceedings|volume=2007|pages=741–745|issn=1942-597X|pmc=2655833|pmid=18693935}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; In comparison to [[simulated patient]]s, virtual patients can also be used as a method of standardized assessment that minimizes variance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hubal|first=R.

They should be viewed as educational tools that augment existing modes and methods of clinical teaching.

==Data standards==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}

The MedBiquitous consortium established a working group in 2005 to create a free and open data standard for expressing and exchanging virtual patients between different authoring and delivery systems. This was in part to address the problem of exchanging and reusing virtual patients and in part to encourage and support easier and wider use of virtual patients in general.

This standard has been very successful and is now widely adopted, e.g. in major projects like eViP.

In 2010, this standard attained status as an [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] standard.
