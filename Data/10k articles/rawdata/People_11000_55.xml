'''Adame Ba Konaré''' (born 1 May 1947 in [[Ségou|Segu]], [[Mali]]) is a Malian historian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chretien|first=Jean-Pierre|title=L'Afrique de Sarkozy Un deni de l'histoire|year=2008|publisher=Karthala|isbn=978-2-8111-0004-9|pages=11–13|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=cIWqGZ01bCcC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=Reponse+de+Adame+Ba+Konare+a+Sarkozy&amp;ots=_dg-grRS9j&amp;sig=qfX8E-UHwMqkzDGxrOYsfYJoUSs#v=onepage&amp;q=Adame%20Ba%20Konare&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and writer who is married to [[Alpha Oumar Konaré]], former [[Heads of State of Mali|President of Mali]].&lt;ref name="article"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dougueli|first=Georges|title=Adame Ba Konare|url=http://www.jeuneafrique.com/Article/LIN30097adameranoka0/|publisher=Jeune Afrique|accessdate=9 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is active in several causes for newborns and refugees.

==Life==
Adame Ba Konaré was born in [[Ségou]] on 1 May 1947 to Marmadou Ba who was a dentist and his wife Kadiatou Thiam. Her parents hailed from a [[Fula people|Fula]] family. She attended the highest education facility, the [[École Normale Supérieure]] in [[Bamako]], along with her future husband, Alpha Oumar Konaré. They married on 15 September 1971. Her new husband was employed as a high school teacher but he was to be sent to the [[University of Warsaw]] to undertake doctoral research. They both obtained a PhD in History in 1976. She returned to Mali and became a history professor at her alma mata in Bamako.&lt;ref name=akyearn/&gt;

Konaré and her spouse worked together on several projects. They published a book together in 1983 called ''Grande Dates Du Mali'' and they both worked for the democratic cause under the presidency of Moussa Traore who ruled Mali's single party state until 1991. During that time they created a publishing house ''Jamana'' and a daily newspaper ''Les Echos'' and a political party called ADEMA-PAS. In 1991 the president was deposed and in the following elections her husband was democratically elected.&lt;ref name=akyearn/&gt;

Konaré has written various types of books, from biographies (about [[Sunni Ali Ber]]) to philosophy (''L'Os de la parole'') and even a novel (''Quand l'ail se frotte a l'encens''), the plot of which focuses on the social gap in a fictional society similar to Mali's. For this book, her style has been compared to French authors [[Emile Zola]] and [[Victor Hugo]]'s works.

Although officially retired, she is often invited to conferences on African History. In addition to her work in academia, Adam Ba Konare is also an outspoken feminist, and the founder of one of the few women's museums in [[Africa]].&lt;ref name=akyearn&gt;{{cite book|last=Akyeampong|first=Emmanuel K.|title=Dictionary of African biography|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0195382072|pages=419–420|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0195382072|editor=chief, Henry Louis Gates Jr. editors in}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum was started in 1987 following the publication of Konaré's book ''The Dictionary of Famous Women of Mali''. The museum, [[Muso Kunda]], is funded by Konaré.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museedelafemme.com/historique.html History and Mission] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131025022854/http://www.museedelafemme.com/historique.html |date=October 25, 2013 }}, Muso Kunda, retrieved 11 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, she has been involved in a project to promote African History, following French president [[Nicolas Sarkozy]]'s speech in [[Dakar]].&lt;ref name="article" /&gt; The movement aims to write a history of Africa, defending the African legacy and past civilizations. As an historian, Adam Ba Konare disagreed with Sarkozy's speech and invited African historians, intellectuals and all friends of Africa to join to write a rebuttal to Sarkozy's speech in order to denounce "the attacks on African memory".&lt;ref name="article"/&gt;

'''Andrew Hunt''' (born 9 June 1970 in [[West Thurrock]], [[Essex]]) is an English former [[Association football|footballer]].

==Career==

Hunt started his career in [[non-league football]], whilst training in business and tourism management, with [[King's Lynn F.C.|King's Lynn]] and [[Kettering Town F.C.|Kettering Town]] before being signed by then manager [[Jim Smith (footballer)|Jim Smith]] for [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in early 1991. Smith departed soon after, and Hunt continued to play under his successor [[Ossie Ardiles]].

However, this was not a successful time for the Magpies, who had fallen into the Second Division in 1989 and failed to make even the playoffs in the [[1990-91 in English football|1990-91 season]]. Ardiles reshaped the side for the [[1991-92 in English football|1991-92 season]] by drafting in more young players and adopting a very attacking style of football, but things failed to improve and by the end of October in 1991 the Magpies were bottom of the Second Division.

Ardiles was sacked on 5 February 1992 and replaced by [[Kevin Keegan]], who chose [[David Kelly (association footballer)|David Kelly]] and [[Micky Quinn]] as his first choice attacking force. Hunt was on the sidelines for much of the next 12 months before departing to [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]], where Ardiles was now the manager. Hunt scored a hat-trick on his home debut for Albion in March 1993 against Brighton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Matthews | first = Tony | title = The Who's Who of West Bromwich Albion | publisher = Breedon Books | year = 2005 | pages = 120–121 | isbn = 1-85983-474-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored the first goal in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] play-off final in 1993 at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] as West Brom beat [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] 3–0 to gain promotion.

Hunt was a regular over the next five seasons, creating an effective partnership with [[Bob Taylor (footballer)|Bob Taylor]], but West Brom failed to gain another promotion. In 1998, he joined [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]], who had just been promoted to the [[Premier League]], on a free transfer.

Sharma made her acting debut in [[Aditya Chopra]]'s romantic drama ''[[Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi]]'' (2008), opposite [[Shah Rukh Khan]].

'''Bharatchandra Ray Gunakor''' ({{lang-bn|ভারতচন্দ্র রায় গুণাকর}}; 1712–1760) was an 18th-century [[Bengali language|Bengali]] and [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] poet and song composer. He is mostly known for his poetic work, ''[[Annadamangal]]'' or ''Annapurnamangal''.&lt;ref name="sen"&gt;Sen, Sukumar (1991, reprint 2007).

Maharaja Krishnachandra of Nadia conferred him with the title Gunakor, after which he became famous as '''Ray Gunakor Bharatchandra'''.&lt;ref name = "bharat_grathabali"&gt;Chakraborty, Shree Natabar (publisher), (1905/1906), ''Bharatchandrer Granthabali'', {{Bn icon}}, p 19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Bharatchandra was born to Narendranarayan Ray and Bhavani Devi in Penro-Bhurshut village (in the present-day [[Howrah district]]) which is currently near Amta, Howrah area. He was youngest of the four children. His father entered a property dispute with the Raja of Bardhaman, and in the process disrespected Raja Kirti Chandra Ray's mother Rani Bishnukumari. As a result, they took away all his lands. A penniless Narendranarayan fled away, while Bharatchandra was taken to his maternal uncle's home in Naoapara. While staying there he learned Sanskrit at the nearby village of Tajpur. When he was 14 he mastered the language and married the daughter of Narottam Acharya of nearby Sarada village.

On returning home his elder brothers mocked him for learning [[Sanskrit]] as they thought the language would be of no use for them. Bharatchandra felt bad and left home for West Debanandpur, a village in Bashberia area of [[Hooghly district]]. There, while living in Ramchandra Munshi's house, he mastered Persian. After his education, he worked as a Mokhtar to facilitate his paternal household's property management. He had to leave his ancestral home because of property disputes and marriage of his own choice. He roamed from place to place. He passed some time in [[Cuttack]], Orissa in the domain of the Maratha power. Later he went back to Bengal.&lt;ref name = "bharat_grathabali_2"&gt;Chakraborty, Shree Natabar (publisher), (1905/1906), ''Bharatchandrer Granthabali'', {{Bn icon}}, p 10 - 15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Court poet of Maharaja Krishnachandra==
When Bharatchandra was residing in the house of [[Indranarayan Chaudhury]], the [[Diwan (title)|Diwan]] of the French government at [[Chandernagore]], his talent was noticed by [[Maharaja Krishnachandra]] of [[Krishnanagar, Nadia|Krishnanagar]] and Bharatchandra became his court poet. He was bestowed with the title '''''Raygunakar''''' and received huge amount of land in [[Shyamnagar, West Bengal|Mulajore]] from Krishnachandra. He was the first poet in the [[Bengali language]] to be identified as a people’s poet, and lent a new grace and beauty to the language.&lt;ref name="sen"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Bose377"/&gt;

==Works==
The most notable work of Bharatchandra is ''[[Annada Mangal]]'' or ''Annapurnamangal''. This work, completed in 1752, is divided into three parts. The first part, which eulogises the goddess [[Annapurna]] is known as ''Annadamangal''. The second part, which narrates the story of Vidya and Sundar is known as ''Kalikamangal'' and the third and the final part, which narrates the story of [[Man Singh I]] and Bhavananda Majumdar is known as ''Annapurnamangal''. His another work, ''Rasamanjari'' is a Bengali-language adaptation of a [[Maithili language|Maithili]] work of the same name written by Bhanudatta. ''Nagashtaka'', a bi-lingual poetic work in Sanskrit and Bengali, shows his mastery over Sanskrit metres. His other notable works include: ''Gangashtaka'' in Sanskrit, ''Satyanarayan Panchali'' and an incomplete work, ''Chandi Natak''.&lt;ref name="sen"/&gt;

==Songs==
Bharatchandra was the true representative of the transition of Bengali music from medieval to modern age. He was well versed in classical music, a skill he possibly acquired in the court of the Maharaja Krishnachandra. While he adopted the line of ''mangalgan'' (song of bliss) which was traditionally dedicated to the gods and goddesses, he attempted to liberate the poetical as well as musical compositions of Bengal from the hold of gods and goddesses and infused a human touch into them. Many of the songs he composed as part of long poetic works were on their own lyrical and could be sung independently. Bharatchandra may also be regarded as a pioneer in composing songs on Radha-Krishna love theme in raga musical form outside the area of ''padavali kirtan''. In a way he is considered the forerunner of [[Ramprasad Sen]] and Ramnidhi Gupta (popular as [[Nidhu Babu]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

'''William A. "Bill" Thomas Jr.''' (born June 1, 1947) is a businessman, commercial fisherman, and politician from the U.S. state of Alaska.  Thomas served as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] member of the [[Alaska House of Representatives]] from the 5th District, comprising scattered rural and semi-rural communities throughout [[Southeast Alaska]] and stretching westward to [[Prince William Sound]], from 2005 to 2013. Thomas served in the majority his entire tenure in the House and held multiple chairmanships.  Thomas gained a seat on the powerful House Finance Committee during his second term and would eventually co-chair the committee. Following [[redistricting]], Thomas lost reelection [[Alaska elections, 2012|in 2012]] by 32 votes to 23-year-old [[Jonathan Kreiss-Tomkins]], a political newcomer who left [[Yale University]] to run.

==Early life==
William A. Thomas Jr. was born in [[Haines, Alaska|Haines]], [[Territory of Alaska]] on June 1, 1947, and is a lifelong resident of Haines and the surrounding [[Chilkat River|Chilkat Valley]]. He is descended from the [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]] Natives of nearby [[Klukwan]] village.  Speaking before a Native organization in Juneau about his origins, Thomas once explained "And the Thomas?  That came from [[California]]".

Bill Thomas graduated from [[Haines High School]] in 1965. Shortly thereafter, he briefly attended the [[University of Alaska Fairbanks|University of Alaska]]&lt;!--Anyone reading references to simply "University of Alaska" should be aware that the University of Alaska and what is now the University of Alaska Fairbanks were synonymous with each other in 1965.--&gt; before joining the U.S. Army, where he served for two years during the Vietnam War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://house.legis.state.ak.us/rep.php?id=thm |title=The Alaska State Legislature |publisher=House.legis.state.ak.us |date=June 1, 1947 |accessdate=September 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business career==
Bill Thomas began commercial fishing for a living ca. 1970, and has continued in this line of work ever since.  He has mostly run gillnets and longlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://housemajority.org/thomas/index.php?p=bio |title=Rep. Thomas's Biography – 27th AK Legislature House Majority |publisher=Housemajority.org |accessdate=September 20, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924203550/http://housemajority.org/thomas/index.php?p=bio |archive-date=September 24, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas has also served as chairman and CEO of his village's Native corporate, Klukwan, Inc.  This position has led to Thomas serving on the board of directors of a number of the corporation's subsidiaries.

==Political career==

===Early political career===
Bill Thomas began working as a [[lobbyist]] in Juneau ca. 1991, mostly representing small community concerns throughout Southeast Alaska. He also spent four years apiece on the [[Haines Borough]] assembly (legislative body) and school board.

In 2004, Democrat [[Georgianna Lincoln]], who represented the sprawling, rural District C in the [[Alaska Senate]] (Lincoln hailed from the [[Yukon River]] village of [[Rampart, Alaska|Rampart]]), did not seek reelection.  5th District member of the [[Alaska House of Representatives]], [[Albert Kookesh]], filed to run for the Senate, eventually winning. Thomas ran for the 5th District House seat, citing his experience as a lobbyist as being beneficial to the position. Thomas won election in 2004 by 59 votes over Tim June, a fellow commercial fisherman from Haines, who was active in environmental and watershed issues for many years. Thomas would be reelected mostly easily thereafter, including defeating June by an approximately 61 to 38 percent margin in 2008.

===Alaska House of Representatives===

====24th Alaska State Legislature====
In the [[24th Alaska State Legislature]], Thomas served as co-chair of the House Community and Regional Affairs Committee, as well as co-chair of the Fisheries Committee.  He also served on the Education, Military and Veterans' Affairs and the Transportation Committees in the House.

===2012 election loss===
Due to an Alaskan Supreme Court order, the redistricting board has redrawn the district lines for the 2012 election based on state constitutional requirements. Major changes have been proposed to the Southeast region, including Thomas's district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Redistricting board redraws southeast Alaska|url=http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/article/Redistricting-board-redraws-southeast-Alaska-3557894.php|publisher=mysanantonio.com|accessdate=20 May 2012|author=BECKY BOHRER|date=May 14, 2012}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Redistricting board unveils boundary changes for Southeast|url=http://www.adn.com/2012/05/14/2464675/redistricting-board-redraws-southeast.html|publisher=Anchorage Daily News|accessdate=20 May 2012|author=BECKY BOHRER|date=May 15, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120518103050/http://www.adn.com/2012/05/14/2464675/redistricting-board-redraws-southeast.html|archivedate=May 18, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed plan combines the 5th District with Juneau, the state capital directly to the south. Constituents from [[Haines Borough, Alaska|Haines Borough]] have objected to the new map, town mayor Stephanie Scott stated "we do not believe that we are socio-economically integrated with the Mendenhall Valley, we don't have the same concerns, the same needs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Haines objects to capital city link: Juneau's northern neighbor fears being 'swallowed up' in new legislative district|url=http://juneauempire.com/local/2012-05-20/haines-objects-capital-city-link#.T7l3FMXLL3A|publisher=Juneau Empire|accessdate=20 May 2012|author=Pat Forgey|date=May 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonathan Kreiss-Tomkins]] of [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]] was the Democratic challenger to Thomas.

Kreiss-Tomkins subsequently defeated Thomas by 32 votes, following a recount.  As ballot-counting continued beyond election day, the lead went back and forth, even tying at one point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Mark|title=Kreiss-Tomkins wins seat by 32 votes|url=http://juneauempire.com/state/2012-12-03/kreiss-tomkins-wins-seat-32-votes#.UQxwclo3lL8|publisher=Juneau Empire|accessdate=2 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--Of course, Thomas has had plenty to say about how he had to go out and earn a living instead of campaign, unlike his opponent, who he described as unemployed and living with his parents.  This can be rather abundantly substantiated by reliable sources, but then again, this campaign in general began to get a little ugly and Wikipedia articles have a nasty habit of being way too complementary.--&gt;

==Personal life==
Bill Thomas and his wife, Joyce Marie, have five children: Rhett, Danny, Gabriel, Cole and Rhiannon.

'''Bishnu Pratap Shah''', a well known personality in the [[service sector]] of Nepal represented in his lifetime the cause of [[good governance]] in his own way. He served under different capacities and rose to the higher positions through his dedication to work, talent and capability. "Shah, who, had been appointed to important positions of Zonal Commissioner and Government Secretary during the party-less Panchayat era, also succeeded in getting high position of the Chief Election Commissioner&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tinepal.org/contents/activities/annual_report_8th_agm.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819141443/http://www.tinepal.org/contents/activities/annual_report_8th_agm.html |archivedate=2008-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; after the restoration of democracy in 1990 because of his personal integrity and dedication to work." " 1./  He had won the heart of the Nepalese readers through his thought provoking write-ups published in Kantipur daily from time to time. In one such article he had underlined the need to hold Constituent Assembly elections, long before the peace process was initiated as he had already smelt the root cause of the Maoist insurgency. In fact, he was not only an efficient administrator and honest civil servant, but also a person with diverse personality and high-vision.

Shah steered the Election Commission so perfectly that facilitated Nepal to hold Parliamentary as well as local level elections on the basis of the principle of adult-franchise to the satisfaction of all the political parties and the mission of the Peoples Movement I.
Born in Maidi VDC Ward No. 2,&lt;ref&gt;http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/print/features/world/asia/nepal/nepal-text&lt;/ref&gt; Dhading district on 29 August 1937 to father Captain Lal Jung Shah and mother Subhadra Kumari. Shah was married to Ishwori Shah in 1971 B.S. and is survived by son Bimal Pratap Shah and daughter Binita Shah (Khadka)and grandchildren Sivashish Pratap Shah and Biraj Khadka. Shah died on 29 April 2005.

Besides being honoured as the Chairman of Association of Asian Election Authorities (AAEA), he was also decorated with Trishakti Patta (Second) and [[Gorkha Dakshina Bahu]] (Second) at home and [[Legion of Honour]] (highest civilian honour of France).
Shah had also served as chairman of board of directors of different schools, colleges and trusts. He had also authored various articles in Nepal and abroad on the topics of history, politics, administration, literature, tourism etc.

Shah was a patriotic person, dedicated civil servant and an efficient administrator. "With his quality to identify and solve problems, democratic attitude and thorough political analysis, many people will remember him for a long time" writes Prof. Ghanashyam Kandel.
Senior journalist Yuvaraj Ghimire points out that "Shah did not only display honesty and spotless nature during his 45 year long career in public positions, he had also become non-controversial despite the change in political system and successfully conducted four elections including parliamentary and local level ones. He was liberal, cooperative and continued academic studies even after retirement from public service." "Shah always tried to forge consensus among the election commissioners while taking key decisions and he had never tried to impose his ideas on others"  recalls Prof. Dr. BIrendra Prasad Mishra, who had worked as the Election Commissioner under the tenure of Shah.
As a student Shah was talented, a mixable friend, qualified administrator, honest and loving parent of his family members. He had extraordinary wisdom, dedication and hardworking capacity and capacity to analyze things. We all may get inspiration from his life full of dedication, hard work, honesty and high intellectual capacity.

==Notable charitable work &amp; career highlights==
Johnstone's activism and philanthropy work began in Edmonton, Alberta in the [[summer]] of 2011, when he began going door-to-door around various neighbourhoods&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ammsa.com/publications/alberta-sweetgrass/edmonton-aboriginal-news-briefs-january-2015|title=Edmonton Aboriginal News|publisher=Aboriginal multi-media society|date=2015-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; by himself collecting food and clothing donations for various charities, such as the Edmonton Food Bank, the youth shelter, and various homeless shelters and [[soup kitchens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://alberta.ctvnews.ca/video?clipId=667190&amp;binId=1.2002989&amp;playlistPageNum=1|title=Can Man Dan on CTV Alberta Primetime|publisher=CTV Alberta Primetime|date=2015-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTl1Aa70G7c|title=I like it RAW - Raw veganism in beef country|publisher=I like it RAW|date=2016-02-16|time=6 minutes, 04 seconds}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://naitnewswatch.ca/blogs/can-man-dans-plan/|title=Can Man Dan's Plan|publisher=NAIT News Watch|date=2015-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013, Can Man Dan provided immediate assistance to Calgary's Food Bank and those affected by the [[2013 Alberta floods]] in the form of 5000 pounds of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://globalnews.ca/video/675525/businesses-help |date=2012-12-18 |title=Businesses help |deadurl=no |accessdate=2013-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both December 2013 and December 2014, local [[Edmonton]] chain restaurant, Delux Burger Bar, featured Can Man Dan as their "Celebrity Chef."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.btedmonton.ca/videos/3919368547001/|title=Can Man Dan at it again!|publisher=Edmonton Breakfast Television|date=2014-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEa-i3ov_oU|title=Can Man Dan appears on City TV's BT|publisher=City TV|date=2014-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delux Burger Bar locations across Edmonton added the Can Man Dan burger to their menus, and gave a portion of sales to the Edmonton Food Bank on Dan's behalf. Dan also arranged to have the Can Man Dan burger served to hundreds of Edmonton's homeless &amp; less fortunate as he hosted "Burger Night" at one of Edmonton's local homeless shelters. Johnstone made headlines in April 2014 after he announced that he would wrestle in a [[professional wrestling]] match with Canadian wrestling promotion, the PWA (The [[Prairie Wrestling Alliance]]) to raise money, food and awareness for Edmonton's [[homeless youth]] population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.edmontonexaminer.com/2014/04/23/edmontons-can-man-dan-will-wrestle-against-pros-to-help-raise-funds-for-yess|title=Can Man Dan fights for youth|publisher=Edmonton Examiner|date=2014-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ipick.ca/edmonton/edmontons-can-man-dan-will-wrestle-against-pros-to-help-raise-funds-for-yess|title=Edmonton's Can Man Dan will fight pro's to help raise money for YESS|publisher=iPick|date=2014-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite suffering a fractured nose during the bout, Johnstone ultimately won his debut [[wrestling]] match raising thousands of dollars and thousands of pounds of food for Edmonton's Youth Empowerment and Support Services (YESS), an organization that Dan's [[mother]] had used when she was a [[teenager]]. In the [[spring (season)|spring]] of 2015, Johnstone started a new community project aimed to help struggling locally-owned businesses attain new customers called "Localive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edmonton.ctvnews.ca/video?clipId=603677&amp;binId=1.1203428&amp;playlistPageNum=1|title=Localive|publisher=CTV Edmonton|date=2015-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2015, "WO Magazine" listed Johnstone as one of their "Top 5 Anti-Poverty Activists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wo-magazine.com/politics/2015/6/8/top-five-anti-poverty-activists|title=Top 5 Anti-Poverty Activists|publisher=WO?

In the [[summer]] of 2015, Johnstone was voted in by Edmonton's general public to serve as an honorary parade marshal for their annual [[K-Days]] festival parade. Johnstone, along with five other community heroes and various departments of Edmonton's [[first responders]], were made honorary parade marshals and each given $2500 to donate to a charity of their choice.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.edmontonjournal.com/Local+first+responders+will+lead+Days+parade+marshals/11198642/story.html|title=Local first responders will lead the way as K-Days parade marshals|publisher=Edmonton Journal|date=2015-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dinnertelevision.ca/videos/4344948231001/|title=K-Days' honorary parade marshals|publisher=Dinner TV|date=2015-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2015, a press release was issued announcing that Johnstone was made honorary chairman and official ambassador for Edmonton's Adopt-A-Teen program, a social program that Dan and his family used when he was growing up.

In December 2016, Johnstone embarked on his "Feed Alberta Tour" hoping to raise food and funds for various food banks across Alberta that were hit hard due to the ongoing [[recession]]. Johnstone travelled to the cities that were most affected by the stagnant economy and camped out in freezing cold temperatures for several days on end.

==Personal life==
Daniel Lee Johnstone was born in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]] on July 31, 1987 during the notorious [[Edmonton tornado]] (also known as "Black Friday") that claimed 27 lives, and he is the eldest son of Pamela Johnstone. Dan is an avid [[professional wrestling]] fan, a self-declared [[cinephile]], and [[board game]] enthusiast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.edmontonexaminer.com/2013/05/08/20-questions-can-man-dan|title=20 Questions|publisher=Edmonton Examiner|date=2013-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; His favourite [[television]] show is ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', and he is also a huge fan of [[reality television]], and has said that he one day hopes to compete on ''[[Big Brother Canada]]'' and ''[[The Amazing Race Canada]]''. Dan considers himself to be a political [[independent politician|independent]], but believes that all levels of government should take a more [[centrist]] approach when governing, as he believes that divisive and polarizing politics are harmful to a society and the community.&lt;ref name="03 – DAN JOHNSTONE"/&gt;

==Politics==
In June 2013, Dan Johnstone announced that he would be running in the [[Edmonton municipal election, 2013]]. Johnstone declared that he would be running for the open seat in Edmonton's Ward 10 which was vacated by Mayoral hopeful, [[Don Iveson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.edmontonexaminer.com/2013/06/26/dan-johnstone-aka-can-man-dan-seeks-vacant-ward-10-seat |last=Robb |first=Trevor |publisher=Edmonton Examiner |date=2013-06-26 |title=Dan Johnstone, a.k.a.

Johnstone's platform was largely based on the repair of basic [[infrastructure]], paying off the city's deficit, focusing on the revitalization of mature neighbourhoods, investing in the building of [[low income]] housing, as well as building a stronger [[public transit]] system while lowering fares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thelocalgood.ca/election-2013-questionnaire-response-dan-johnstone-ward-10/|title=Election 2013 response: "Can Man Dan" Dan Johnstone|publisher=The Local Good|date=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edmonton.ctvnews.ca/2.2237/ward-ten/dan-johnstone-ward-ten-candidate|title=Dan Johnstone Ward 10 candidate|publisher=CTV Edmonton|date=2013-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eliminatepovertyinedmonton.ca/election-2013/ward-10-dan-johnstone.html|title=Dan Johnstone - Ward 10|publisher=Eliminate Poverty Edmonton|date=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnstone also pledged to self-fund his entire campaign and donate $10 000 for each year of his terms' salary to various charities and causes around Edmonton citing that, "politicians make entirely too much money."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hersuccess.ca/running-political-office-dan-johnstone/|title=Running for political office with Dan Johnstone|publisher=Her Success|date=2016-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnstone openly refused to take money or campaign contributions from corporations, unions, developers, or special interest groups.&lt;ref name="03 – DAN JOHNSTONE"/&gt; He was ultimately defeated by former [[Alberta Party]] candidate, Michael Walters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.edmonton.ca/city_government/municipal_elections/elections-2013-results.aspx |date=2013-10-21 |title=2013 Official Election Results |deadurl=no |accessdate=2013-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 27 of 2015, Johnstone announced his candidacy for the Ward 12 [[by-election]] race in Edmonton's south-side district to replace [[Amarjeet Sohi]] who was elected to [[Justin Trudeau]]'s [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] government in October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.edmontonexaminer.com/2016/01/06/can-man-dan-runs-for-ward-12|title="Can Man Dan" runs for Ward 12|publisher=Edmonton Examiner|date=2016-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.metronews.ca/news/edmonton/2016/01/05/edmonton-ward-12-set-to-have-24-candidates-in-race-.html|title=Edmonton's Ward 12 set to have crowded field for byelection|publisher=Metro Edmonton|date=2016-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnstone, once again labelling himself as a [[fiscal conservative]] and socially progressive candidate, concentrated on restructuring Edmonton's photo radar system and redirecting a majority of the revenue to Edmonton's Police services, ushering in a more economical public transit system, postponing the building of the Valley Line LRT route, and mandating that a certain percentage of newly developed land must contain low-income and other forms of [[social housing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.metronews.ca/news/edmonton/2016/02/09/edmonton-ward-12-candidates-weigh-in-on-the-valley-line-.html|title=Ward 12 candidates weigh in on the Valley Line LRT|publisher=Metro Edmonton|date=2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edmontonjournal.com/news/politics/david-staples-edmonton-byelection-candidates-turning-against-lrt|title=Ward 12 candidates turning against Valley Line LRT|publisher=Edmonton Journal|date=2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vueweekly.com/ward-12-candidates-weigh-in-with-their-opinions-on-the-next-leg-of-the-lrt/|title=Ward 12 candidates weigh in with their opinions|publisher=Vue Weekly|date=2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edmontonjournal.com/news/politics/david-staples-where-do-edmonton-ward-12-candidates-stand-on-key-issues|title=Where do Ward 12 candidates stand on key issues|publisher=Edmonton Journal|date=2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/who-are-edmontons-ward-12-candidates|title=Meet the 32 candidates of the Ward 12 by-election|publisher=Edmonton Journal|date=2016-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnstone was also openly critical of the record-breaking thirty-two candidates citing that it would confuse casual voters and result in a low voter turnout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.edmontonsun.com/2016/01/24/edmontons-ward-12-byelection-log-jam-getting-worse|title=Ward 12 by-election log-jam getting worse|publisher=Edmonton Sun|date=2016-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or580IB6C4k|title="Can Man Dan" Dan Johnstone talks by-election|publisher=Youtube|date=2016-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnstone was defeated by local police detective, Moe Banga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/moe-banga-wins-historic-ward-12-byelection-1.3459508|title=Moe Banga wins historic Ward 12 by-election|publisher=CBC|date=2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, Johnstone announced that he was seeking the [[Alberta Party]] nomination to be their official candidate in the upcoming 2019 Alberta provincial election. Johnstone was looking to represent the Alberta Party in the province's Edmonton-South district, but left near the end of June 2018, citing lack of "leadership, direction, and organization;" he also noted he was not impressed with the new leadership under [[Stephen Mandel]], and preferred the leadership style of former Alberta Party leader [[Greg Clark (Canadian politician)|Greg Clark]]. Although Johnstone's campaign was brief, he was running on a platform of lowering and controlling Alberta's ballooning debt (which is forecasted to hit $96 billion in 2023),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edmontonjournal.com/news/politics/alberta-budget-2018-expected-to-reveal-road-map-to-balanced-books|title=Alberta budget 2018: NDP aims to erase deficit by 2023 as debt climbs to $96 billion|publisher=Edmonton Journal|date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; supporting Alberta's small businesses and local entrepreneurs, investing in the building of more housing projects for low-income families and seniors, lowering taxes, protecting social programs that his family had used while living in poverty, and working to end the divisiveness often found in politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/edmonton/2018/05/14/anti-poverty-activist-can-man-dan-running-as-alberta-party-candidate-in-edmonton.html|title=Anti-poverty activist Can Man Dan running as Alberta Party candidate in Edmonton|publisher=Toronto Star|author=Catherine Griwkowsky|date=2018-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://danjohnstone.com/2018/05/14/let-me-be-your-champion-official-nomination-campaign-announcement/|title=Let me be your champion!

Canadian naming conventions vary based on whether one is Aboriginal Canadian, English Canadian or French Canadian.

==English Canadian names==
{{Expand section|date=January 2011}}
In English Canada, names follow much the same convention as they do in the United States and United Kingdom. Usually the "first name" (as described in e.g. birth certificates) is what a child goes by, although a middle name (if any) may be preferred—both also known as "given names." The "last name" is usually taken from a child's parents, which may be from either or both (joined by hyphenation).&lt;ref group=note&gt;Middle names are optional and are generally only used on official documentation (multiple middle names are rare but officially recognized).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Live Birth"&gt;[http://www.forms.ssb.gov.on.ca/mbs/ssb/forms/ssbforms.nsf/AttachDocsPublish/007-11022~1/$File/11022E.pdf Statement of Live Birth Form] [http://www.forms.ssb.gov.on.ca/mbs/ssb/forms/ssbforms.nsf/GetFileAttach/007-11335E~1/$File/11335E.pdfServiceOntario.ca&lt;/ref&gt; Outside Quebec (with distinct civil law system), either spouse has the right to assume the otherʼs last name, as long as it is not intended for the purposes of fraud. Getting married does not result in a legal change of name nor automatically change identification records.&lt;ref name="Taking spouse name Ontario"&gt;[https://www.ontario.ca/en/information_bundle/individuals/119599.html Assuming/Unassuming a Spouse’s or Partner’s Name] ServiceOntario.ca&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Proof of name Canada"&gt;[http://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/eng/sin/apply/proof.shtml Criteria to apply for Social Insurance Number] ServiceCanada.ca - See section 'Supporting Documents'&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref group=note&gt;Marriage certificate is considered proof.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not uncommon to see names that follow patterns differing from the English and French naming conventions.

==French Canadian names==
;Given names in Quebec

In [[French Canada]], up until the late 1960s, children of [[Roman Catholic]] origin were given three names at birth (usually not hyphenated): the first, Marie or Joseph, usually indicated the gender of the child. The second was usually the name of the [[Godparent|godfather]] or [[Godparent|godmother]], while the third and last given name was the name used in everyday situations. {{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole proposition|date=October 2012}} Thus, a child prenamed ''Joseph Bruno Jean'' on his birth or baptismal certificate would indicate the baby was a boy, the godfather's first name was ''Bruno'' and that the child would be called ''Jean'' (and not ''Joseph'') for all intents and purposes of everyday life. A real-life example of this naming convention was that of Canadian prime minister [[Jean Chrétien]], who was born ''Joseph Jacques Jean Chrétien''.

Although it is still permitted to list multiple names on a birth, it is uncommon for people to even be aware of their other given names, and the practice of using religious names became increasingly rarer after the [[Quiet Revolution]] as baptism ceremonies gradually became less common. The Quebec government officially recommends not using more than four given names.&lt;ref name="Given Name rules Quebec"&gt;[http://www.etatcivil.gouv.qc.ca/en/birth.html#prenom Child's given name(s)] Directeur de l'état civil, Quebec&lt;/ref&gt;

;Surnames in Quebec

Currently, most couples give the child the surname of the father, though the [[Quebec]] civil code allows a couple to combine at most two of their surnames, with or without hyphens.&lt;ref name="Naming rules Quebec"&gt;[http://www.etatcivil.gouv.qc.ca/en/birth.html#nom Child's surname] Directeur de l'état civil, Quebec&lt;/ref&gt; Thus a couple named ''Joseph Bouchard-Tremblay'' and ''Marie Dion-Roy'' could give to their children the surnames ''Bouchard'', ''Tremblay'', ''Dion'', ''Roy'', ''Bouchard-Tremblay'', ''Dion-Roy'', ''Bouchard-Dion'', ''Bouchard-Roy'', and so on.

Following traditional French custom, Quebec women did not change their legal names upon marriage, but were referred to by their husband's surname in common speech. This latter practice fell out of favour following the [[Quiet Revolution]], and spouses now retain their surnames after marriage in all contexts. A name change for marriage is difficult or impossible to do if desired, as requests to adopt a husband's name after marriage are typically denied.&lt;ref name="Marriage"&gt;[http://www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/english/publications/generale/maria-a.htm#names Marriage - Spouses' names] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123172016/http://www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/english/publications/generale/maria-a.htm#names#names |date=2010-11-23 }} Justice Quebec&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Change Name"&gt;[http://www.etatcivil.gouv.qc.ca/en/change-name.html Change of Name] Directeur de l'état civil, Quebec&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="News"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=72ddc06b-4660-4b92-8b92-3a26ae24b377&amp;k=5969 | title=Quebec newlywed furious she can't take her husband's name | website=Canada.com News | date=August 8, 2007 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160102072805/http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=72ddc06b-4660-4b92-8b92-3a26ae24b377&amp;k=5969 | archivedate= 2016-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;The "nom-dit" tradition
{{see also| Dit name}}
Until the late 19th century, several families also had a ''nom-dit'' tradition.  This was a family nickname (literally a "said name").&lt;ref name="Canadian Genealogy Centre"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/genealogy/022-914.004-e.html# |title=Canadian Genealogy Centre |access-date=2010-12-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824044034/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/genealogy/022-914.004-e.html# |archive-date=2011-08-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of the ''noms-dits'' were various.  Some ''noms-dits'' were the war-name of the first settler, while he was a soldier: ''Hébert dit Jolicœur'' (Pretty Heart, cf. Braveheart), ''Thomas dit Tranchemontagne'' (mountain chopper).  Some denoted the place of origin of the first settler: ''Langevin'' ([[Anjou]]), ''Barbeau dit Poitevin'' ([[Poitou]]).  Others denoted a characteristic of the person or of his dwelling: ''Lacourse'', ''Lépine'', ''Larivière''.

==Indigenous Canadian names==
Many, if not most, Indigenous Canadians (primarily in this First Nations and Métis people, but also Inuit to an extent) carry European surnames, and most of those are French names, either because of intermarriage with French Canadian and Métis men and indigenous women or because a surname was assigned to an indigenous person by a French-speaking Christian missionary.  The most notable example is the [[Cardinal (name)|Cardinal]] family, which started with a few French Canadians moving to the West and now includes thousands of Cree and Metis people in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and beyond.  Other examples would [[Belcourt (surname)|Belcourt]].  Other European groups have contributed notably to indigenous, and especially Métis names, such as [[Isbister]] (Scottish), [[Sarah Hardisty|Hardisty]] (English), and so on.

On the Great Plains, many First Nations people have surnames that are direct English translations of an ancestor's given name, often these are multiple words long; examples would be [[Milton Born With A Tooth|Born with a Tooth]] (Blackfoot), [[Byron Chief-Moon|Chief-Moon]] (Blood), or [[Massey Whiteknife|Whiteknife]] (Cree).

For others, a name in their ancestral language is rendered in English or French spelling such as [[Gordon Tootoosis|Tootoosis]] (Plains Cree), [[Newashish]] (Atikamekw), or [[Yahgulanaas]] (Haida).

Some people have a legal or baptismal name in English or French and separate name in their ancestral language, for example [[Oronhyatekha]] (Mohawk) who was also called Peter Martin.

For an overview of common Inuit names in Canada see [[List of Canadian Inuit]].

==Use of titles in Canadian English==
{{main|Canadian honorifics}}

Courtesy titles may be used on official documents in Canada, and are frequently used in formal situations such as business correspondence or meetings.

As in other English-speaking countries, the following courtesy titles are used by default or can be chosen by the bearer when completing a form or application:
* Mr. (Mister) (referencing any male)
* Mrs. (Missus) (referencing a married, widowed, or divorced female)
* Miss (Miss) (referencing a single young female)
* Ms. (Miz) (referencing a female of any age without specifying her marital status).

When referring to a woman whose marital status that one does not know, [[Ms.|it is common to write Ms.]], but no specific rules apply. Using a courtesy title in a non-formal situation may be construed as wrong and awkward.

Although each person has one of the above titles in their name, other titles may be acquired through various ways. The titles of Dr. (doctor) and Prof. (Professor) are acquired through schooling. Often the titles for professors and medical doctors are used instead of the Given name of the individual when being said by one of the individuals students or patients. This does not apply, however, for friends and family and is strictly prohibited to those using the service of the individual and does not know the individual well enough. An example would be for a medical doctor named Mark. His friends would say, "Hello, Mark," but his patients would say, "Hello, doctor."

The parliamentary titles Hon. (honourable) or Rt. Hon. (right honourable) are given to serving cabinet ministers, either federal or provincial/territorial and in some cases are retained for life; for example in the case of retired prime ministers. Senators are designated with the prenominal title Sen. (Senator) while in office.

Foreign titles, such as Sir and Count, are not used; the acceptance of foreign honours by Canadian citizens is not permitted under the [[Canadian titles debate|Nickle resolution and subsequent Acts of Parliament]].

==Suffixes==
Suffixes always come after the family name, and are also acquired for various reasons.
Suffixes are only used in oral communication when necessary, and are also rarely written on the wish of the individual bearing the suffix.

The most common suffixes are Sr. (Senior) and Jr. (Junior). When an individual names their child after themselves or another family member (not necessarily immediate), that individual then bears the suffix Sr. and the offspring bears the suffix Jr., which may also be replaced with II (the second). The suffix "III" is used after either Jr or II and like subsequent numeric suffixes, does not need to happen in one family line. For example, if John and Bob Gruber are brothers and if Bob has a son before John, he will call his son John, II. If John now has a son, his son is John, Jr. As time passes, the III suffix goes to the first born of either John Jr or John II. This is how it is possible and correct for a Jr. to father a IV. Such suffixes are rare amongst French-Canadians due the strongly generational nature of most French given names.

Other completely accepted suffixes include:
*M.D. (Medical Doctor)
*Ph.D. (Doctor of Philosophy)
*MP (Member of Parliament), for federal elected politicians
*Abbreviations for provincially elected politicians:
**MLA (Member of the Legislative Assembly)
**MPP (Member of Provincial Parliament, Ontario only)
**MNA (Member of the National Assembly, Quebec only)
**MHA (Member of the House of Assembly, Newfoundland and Labrador only)
MP and its provincial or territorial equivalents may be followed by the name of the constituency in which that member was elected. For example: Buddy Johnson, M.P. London North-Centre. However, the constituency name or similar designations are not shown of official documents outside of parliament and is never used in casual communication.

Postnominals granted under the Canadian honour system include PC ([[Queen's Privy Council for Canada|Privy Councillor]], granted to federal cabinet ministers and some other senior politicians including leaders of opposition parties); CM (Member of the [[Order of Canada]]); OC (Officer of the Order of Canada); and CC (Companion of the Order of Canada, the highest rank of that order). For a list of other postnominals, including professional titles and orders, provincial honours, and honours in gift of the Crown, see [[List of post-nominal letters in Canada]].

He was a small business owner and was president of Wilson Funeral Homes and Wilson Furniture Store.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

==Ohio legislature==
Wilson ran for Ohio's 99th House District in 1996. He defeated William L. Thomas in the Democratic primary 54%–46%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sos.state.oh.us/sos/elections/Research/electResultsMain/1990-1999OfficialElectionResults/DemOhioReps031996.aspx |title=Democratic Ohio House of Representatives: March 19, 1996 |publisher=Sos.state.oh.us |date=1996-03-19 |accessdate=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won the general election and re-election in 1998 (50%),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=206781 |title=OH State House 99 Race - Nov 03, 1998 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2000 (68%),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=201036 |title=OH State House 99 Race - Nov 07, 2000 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2002 (62%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=49437 |title=OH State House 96 Race - Nov 05, 2002 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, he ran for the [[Ohio Senate]] when incumbent Democrat [[Greg DiDonato]] of the 30th District decided to retire after redistricting. In the Democratic primary, he defeated State Representative [[Jerry W. Krupinski|Jerry Krupinski]] 67%–33%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=70736 |title=OH State Senate 30 D Primary Race - Mar 02, 2004 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won the general election with 67% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=70737 |title=OH State Senate 30 Race - Nov 02, 2004 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he decided to retire to run for the [[U.S. House of Representatives]], his son [[Jason Wilson (politician)|Jason Wilson]] replaced him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=431747 |title=OH State Senate 30 Race - Nov 04, 2008 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elections===
;2006
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Ohio, 2006}}
In 2006, incumbent Democratic U.S. Congressman [[Ted Strickland]] decided to retire to run for [[Governor of Ohio]]. Wilson decided to run for the open seat in [[Ohio's 6th congressional district]]. Ohio state law requires that a candidate for Congress submit 50 valid signatures from constituents in his district to qualify for a place on the primary ballot. When Wilson's signatures were verified by the [[Columbiana County, Ohio|Columbiana County]] Board of Elections, only 46 of the 93 signatures submitted could be verified as legal residents of the 6th district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cillizza|first1=Chris|title=Ohio: Republicans' Machiavellian Maneuver in the 6th|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/thefix/house/house-republicans-machiavellia.html|accessdate=December 21, 2015|publisher=Washington Post|date=April 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As such, for the Democratic primary on May 2, 2006, Charlie Wilson's name did not appear on the ballot. Wilson's campaign launched a massive effort, aided by the [[Democratic National Committee|national party]] and [[AFL-CIO|organized labor]], to '[[write-in]]' Charlie Wilson's name in the primary. The campaign was successful, with Wilson winning 66% of the Democratic vote against two opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Democratic U.S. House of Representatives: May 2, 2006|url=http://www.sos.state.oh.us/sos/elections/Research/electResultsMain/2006ElectionsResults/06-0502DemUSReps.aspx|accessdate=21 December 2015|publisher=Ohio Secretary of State}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson defeated Republican State Representative [[Chuck Blasdel]] 62%–38%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=207162|title=OH - District 06 Race|date=November 7, 2006|publisher=Our Campaigns|accessdate=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;2008
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Ohio, 2008#District 6}}
Wilson defeated Republican [[Richard Stobbs]] 62%–33%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=389951|title=OH - District 06 Race|date=November 4, 2008|publisher=Our Campaigns|accessdate=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;2010
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Ohio, 2010#District 6*}}
Wilson was defeated by Republican U.S. Air Force veteran [[Bill Johnson (Ohio politician)|Bill Johnson]] 50%–45%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=507578|title=OH - District 06 Race|date=November 2, 2010|publisher=Our Campaigns|accessdate=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 2010 campaign, Wilson was criticized for giving his staff large bonuses with taxpayer money as he was ending his term. Congressman Wilson's staff payroll increased by 49.7% from the previous payroll quarter, indicating that his staff did indeed receive hefty taxpayer funded bonuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.morningjournalnews.com/page/content.detail/id/531229/Wilson-staff-s-exit-bonuses---called-into-question.html?nav=5006 |title=News, Sports, Jobs - Morning Journal |website=Morningjournalnews.com |date= |accessdate=2017-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;2012
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Ohio, 2012#District 6}}
In November 2011, Wilson filed to run a rematch against Johnson in the newly redrawn 6th Congressional District.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/house-races/196335-former-rep-charlie-wilson-will-seek-rematch-in-ohio|title=Former Rep. Charlie Wilson will seek rematch in Ohio|publisher=TheHill|date=2011-11-30|accessdate=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The race for Ohio's 6th Congressional District was listed as one of the most competitive in the country. It was one of the 24 toss-up races in the New York Times 2012 House Race Ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elections.nytimes.com/2012/ratings/house |title=House Ratings - Election 2012 - NYTimes.com |website=Elections.nytimes.com |date= |accessdate=2017-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the major issues in the race were jobs and the economy, health care, and energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theintelligencer.net/page/content.detail/id/572015/Wilson-Says-He-Also-Voted-Against-Obama-s-Issues.html?nav=515 |title=News, Sports, Jobs |newspaper=[[The Intelligencer &amp; Wheeling News Register|The Intelligencer]] |date=2017-06-19 |accessdate=2017-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the issue of coal, Wilson told NPR that "We don't need to fire Obama and we don't need to stop the war on coal", in an interview on September 28, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.npr.org/2012/09/28/161934809/mining-for-swing-votes-in-battleground-ohio |title=Obama, Romney Mine For Swing Voters In Ohio |website=Npr.org |date=2012-09-28 |accessdate=2017-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His spokesman said the candidate was being sarcastic, calling the comments "the farthest thing from the truth. Charlie has fought against both administrations, both the Bush administration and the Obama administration in the battle for coal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Weigel|first=Dave|title=I never said we were FactCheck|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2012/09/28/charlie_wilson_gop_makes_out_of_context_attack_on_democrat_defends_it_.html|accessdate=October 10, 2012|newspaper=Slate|date=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked about the Supreme Court ruling on President Obama's health care law, Wilson said he viewed the tax as a way of encouraging people to buy insurance and was quoted saying: "I look at it as a way of directing people into what would be a good decision for them,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mariettatimes.com/page/content.detail/id/545087/Health-care-ruling-reactions-divided.html|title=Health Care Ruling Reactions Divided|accessdate=2012-10-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304034835/http://mariettatimes.com/page/content.detail/id/545087/Health-care-ruling-reactions-divided.html|archivedate=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 6, 2012, Wilson was defeated by Johnson 53% to 47% in the rematch of their 2010 race in a slightly more Republican-leaning district, drawn after the 2010 census.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Steubenville Herald-Star|work=[[hsconnect.com]]|accessdate=November 9, 2012|date=November 7, 2012|title=Johnson gets second term in 6th congressional district|last=Harris|first=Linda|url=http://www.heraldstaronline.com/page/content.detail/id/579903/Johnson-gets-second-term-in-6th-Congressional-District.html?nav=5010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tenure===
;Blue Dog Coalition
After entering office, Wilson joined the [[Blue Dog Coalition]], a group of moderate and [[Conservatism|conservative]] congressional Democrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Blue Dogs Expose Unknown Administration Budget Report; Call for Honesty, Accountability, and Transparency in Budget|url=http://www.house.gov/ross/BlueDogs/bluedogs.shtml|accessdate=21 December 2015|publisher=The Blue Dog Coalition|date=March 2, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061228002805/http://www.house.gov/ross/BlueDogs/bluedogs.shtml|archivedate=December 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson was named Blue Dog of the Week on April 2, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PRESS RELEASE: Wilson Named "Blue Dog Of The Week"|url=http://www.charliewilson.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=26&amp;Itemid=70|accessdate=21 December 2015|publisher=House.Gov|date=April 2, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206230409/http://www.charliewilson.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=26&amp;Itemid=70|archivedate=December 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson voted "Yes" on the Senate version of the health care bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Olka|url=http://hotlineoncall.nationaljournal.com/archives/2010/03/updating_the_he_7.php|title=Updating The Health Care Whip Count – Hotline On Call|publisher=Hotlineoncall.nationaljournal.com|accessdate=2010-08-23|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224143857/http://hotlineoncall.nationaljournal.com/archives/2010/03/updating_the_he_7.php|archivedate=February 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Medicaid tamper-resistant prescription pads
Along with Rep. [[Robert Marion Berry|Marion Berry]] (D-[[Arkansas|AR]]) and Rep. [[Mike Ross (politician)|Mike Ross]] (D-AR), Wilson introduced H.R.3090 in July 2007 to counteract a provision tucked away in the Iraq Spending Bill. The provision required that all [[Medicaid]] prescriptions be written on "tamper-resistant pads" effective October 1, 2007. The provision was put in place to combat Medicaid prescription fraud, but it may have unintended consequences. For example, the pads may not be widely available, nor is there a good definition of what they are. If pharmacists fill prescriptions that are not written on the special pads they risk not getting reimbursed through Medicaid.

Wilson's bill would have required that only [[Schedule II (US)|Class II narcotics]] prescriptions, like [[OxyContin]], be written on tamper-resistant pads. "This will prevent the most dangerous fraud without preventing those in need from receiving their everyday medications," Wilson said.&lt;ref name=Pharmacist&gt;{{cite news|title=PRESS RELEASE: Wilson Introduces Patient And Pharmacists Protection Act Of 2007|url=http://www.charliewilson.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=116&amp;Itemid=70|accessdate=December 21, 2015|publisher=House.Gov|date=July 19, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207004712/http://www.charliewilson.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=116&amp;Itemid=70|archivedate=December 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Daniel Jenkyn Jones''' [[OBE]] (7 December 1912 – 23 April 1993) was a Welsh [[composer]] of [[European classical music|classical music]], who worked in Britain.  He used both serial and tonal techniques. He is best known for his quartets and thirteen symphonies (some composed in his own system of 'Complex Metres') and for his song settings for [[Dylan Thomas]]'s play, ''[[Under Milk Wood]]''.

==Biography==
Jones was born in [[Pembroke, Pembrokeshire|Pembroke]] in south [[Wales]]. His father, Jenkyn Jones, was a composer and his mother a singer,&lt;ref name=archive&gt;National Library of Wales Daniel Jones Archive: Context&lt;/ref&gt; and by the time he was nine years old the young Daniel had himself written several piano sonatas.

He attended the [[Bishop Gore School]] in [[Swansea]] (1924–1931), where his enthusiasm for literature led to a close friendship with the poet Dylan Thomas, and to his going on to study English literature at [[Swansea University]]. At this period Jones and Thomas were part of the informal group of aspiring artists who would meet at the Kardomah cafe in Castle Street, [[Swansea]]. Other members of the group were the poet [[Vernon Watkins]] and the painter [[Alfred Janes]]. In 1935 Jones left Swansea to study music at the [[Royal Academy of Music]] in London (1935–1938), where his teachers included [[Henry Wood (conductor)|Sir Henry Wood]] and [[Harry Farjeon]].&lt;ref name=archive/&gt;  Winning the [[Mendelssohn Scholarship]] in 1935 allowed him to study in Czechoslovakia, France, the Netherlands and Germany, and to develop his skills as a linguist.

In 1937 Jones married Penelope Eunice Bedford, with whom he would have three daughters.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-daniel-jones-1457920.html | title=Obituary: Daniel Jones | first=Geraint | last=Lewis | newspaper=The Independent | date=28 April 1993 | accessdate=4 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the years leading up to [[World War II]] he composed his first large-scale orchestral works – 'Symphonic Prologue' and 'Five Pieces for Orchestra' – and developed his own compositional system of 'Complex Metres'.

During the War, as a captain in the [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|Intelligence Corps]] (1940–1946), he used his linguistic abilities at [[Bletchley Park]] codes centre as a cryptographer and a decoder of Russian, Romanian and Japanese texts.  In 1944 Jones married his second wife, Irene Goodchild, with whom he would have one son and one daughter.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

After the War, Jones won increasing recognition as an innovative composer. In 1950 his "Symphonic Prologue" won the first prize of the [[Royal Philharmonic Society]], and thereafter most of his compositions were written to commission – from the [[Festival of Britain]], the [[Swansea Festival of Music and the Arts|Swansea Festival]], the Royal [[National Eisteddfod]], the [[BBC]], the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]] and the Llandaff Festival. Between 1945 and 1985 he composed his series of twelve symphonies, each centred on one semi-tone of the chromatic scale, and in 1992 his unnumbered "Symphony In Memoriam John Fussell" (his friend, the Director of the Swansea Festival). By 1993 he had composed eight string quartets, as well as works in many other genres, including the cantata, ''The Country Beyond the Stars'', a setting of Henry Vaughan's poem.

Jones enjoyed long friendships with several artists, among them [[Vernon Watkins]], [[Ceri Richards]] and [[Grace Williams]], and, most closely, Dylan Thomas. As well as composing song-settings for Thomas's ''[[Under Milk Wood]]'' (1954) and dedicating his fourth symphony (1954) to Thomas's memory, he edited collections of Thomas's poetry and prose, and in 1977 published the memoir, ''My Friend Dylan Thomas''.

In 1968 Jones was awarded an [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]].

He died in [[Swansea]] in 1993. His archive is held at the National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth. An oil portrait of Jones by [[Alfred Janes]] is held by the [[National Museum Cardiff]]; a photographic portrait by Bernard Mitchell (1967) is held by the National Portrait Gallery, London.

In 2008 the actor Adrian Metcalf and composer Rob Marshall drew on the compositions and writings of Jones and Thomas in their tribute, "Warmley" (named after Daniel Jones's boyhood home).

==Composition==
By 1936, Jones had devised his own compositional system of Complex Metres, which was fully developed in his "Sonata for Three Non-Chromatic Kettle-Drums" (1947). In 1950, he described this system: 'The unifying element of fixed pattern is present, but the pattern itself is asymmetrical, therefore with a powerful means of satisfying structural requirements there would seem to be possible both a greater variety and a greater subtlety in the rhythm-metre relationship'.&lt;ref&gt;"The Score", June 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;  Jones's system was adapted in Germany by the composer [[Boris Blacher]]. For Jones himself his complex structures had always to be allied with emotive intention. As is the case with other composers who used both serial techniques and tonality, Jones's music may for a time have seemed too advanced for traditionalists and too old-fashioned for the avant-garde.

After espousing virulently [[Neo-fascism|neo-fascistic]] and [[Racial segregation|segregationist]] views in the 1950s under the tutelage of Pound, Wand moved to California in the 60s and became a supporter of the [[Black Power movement]], seeing parallels between the Asian-American and African-American experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=WITEMEYER|first=HUGH|date=1986|title=THE STRANGE PROGRESS OF DAVID HSIN-FU WAND|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/24723978|journal=Paideuma|volume=15|issue=2/3|pages=191–210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early Life ==
Wand was born on December 28, 1931 in [[Hangzhou]], China, and claimed to be a direct descendent of [[Tang dynasty]] poet [[Wang Wei (Tang dynasty)|Wang Wei]] (699–759). He attended [[St. John's University, Shanghai|St. John's Middle School]] in [[Shanghai]], and fled to the United States as a refugee from the [[Chinese Communist Revolution|Communist Revolution]] in 1949. While Wand's family was anti-communist, he expressed admiration for [[Mao Zedong|Mao]]'s poetry and considered [[Chiang Kai-shek]] "an intellectual midget." He graduated from [[Dartmouth College]] in 1955, studying English and Italian and joining the [[Beta Theta Pi]] fraternity.

In 1955, Wand (writing as David Rafael Wang) began corresponding with Ezra Pound, who was incarcerated at [[Ezra Pound#St Elizabeths Hospital|St. Elizabeths Hospital]] following his [[Ezra Pound#Arrest for treason|arrest and trial for treason against the United States]] in 1945. In their letters, Wand and Pound discussed their shared interest in [[Confucius]] and [[Chinese characters|Chinese written characters]], with Wand calling Pound “the greatest poet writing in the English language" and Pound taking particular interest in Wand's name's middle logogram (燊), lifting its meaning "flame-style king" for the ideogram of the 1959 [[The Cantos#Thrones|''Thrones Cantos'']].

== New York ==

=== Correspondences with Ezra Pound ===

After graduating from Dartmouth, Wand moved to [[New York City|New York]], where he worked a series of odd jobs while continuing his correspondence with Pound (he visited him at St. Elizabeths in 1956). Increasingly [[Neo-fascism|neo-fascistic]], [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] and [[Racial segregation|segregationist]] in his worldview, Wand sought Pound for guidance, writing in October 1957, “For eugenics' sake, please tell me what the best books on [[Economic antisemitism|money issue]] are." He frequently wrote in praise of far-right activist (and fellow Pound devotee) [[John Kasper]] and in support of racial purity and [[Eugenics|eugenic breeding]], exclaiming in a July 12, 1957 letter that:&lt;blockquote&gt;My impression of the French is that they are of all Europeans the closest to the kikes in spirit and nature. 11 years of living under the French in Shanghai have taught me that they are more beastly than the Japs. The Italians and the Germans were the only Europeans who acted civilized. I am for an united Europe under the rule of either Germany or Italy. [[Adolf Hitler|Adolf]] and [[Benito Mussolini|Benito]] were certainly close to saints.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Wand believed strongly in [[male chauvinism]], recounting a disagreement with a female friend that "[[Adolf Hitler|Adolf]] knew where women should belong more than any other political leaders. Told her that glorification of the ‘[[New Woman]]' by murky thinkers like [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]] and [[George Bernard Shaw|GBS]] has lead [sic] to family disunity and political chaos in the West." Despite opposition to miscegenation, Wand justified marriage proposals to Marcella Spann and [[Sheri Martinelli|Sherri Martinelli]] on the grounds that their offspring would be genetically superior.

While Wand expressed hostility for [[Homosexuality|homosexuals]] and "effeminate" intellectuals, railing against “intellectual molly-coddles," “effeminate weaklings,” “liberaloid eggheads," and “milksop ‘Poundians',” he declared his admiration for physically fit men of action: the "plain jock," "prizefighters and cattlebreeders," and imagined setting up gymnasium-bookstores where men could work out and "exchange ideas and practice target-shooting, which may come in handy later in dealing with the [[John Foster Dulles|Dulleses]] and [[Adlai Stevenson II|Stevensons]] etc." He wrote to Pound about his intention to become a sports writer and wrote poems about [[Bodybuilding|bodybuilders]] and [[Elvis Presley]], whom he saw as a hero because he “at least makes one feel like fucking or busting the noses of some spineless poetic jerks like [[Richard Eberhart]] and [[W. H. Auden]] and murdering some filthy intellectual scumbags like Adlai Stevenson and/or [[Anthony Eden]]."

In 1957, Wand organized the “North American Citizens for the Constitution: An Affiliation of the Whib Party" (Whib was an acronym that Pound invented for "Wheat in bread" based on his interest in grain-rites), an intellectual front for John Kasper's segregationist activities that sought to carry his ideas to [[Ivy League]] campuses. The NACC  supported "racial integrity," states' rights, and the right to bear arms while opposing "the forced integration of races," the [[NAACP]], the [[National Urban League|Urban League]], and the [[Anti-Defamation League]]. They accused [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|President Eisenhower]] of treason and threatened "Marxist, usurer, race-mixer, degenerate politician, we pledge eternal vigilance, eternal combativeness, even death!"

Wand's activities with the NACC compelled a former Dartmouth classmate, David Rattray, to accuse him in a November 1957 issue of ''[[The Nation]]'' of supporting “the cause of [[white supremacy]]" and of “touring the Ivy League colleges with the purpose of setting up [[Citizens' Councils|White Citizens' councils]] on the campuses."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rattray|first=David|date=16 November 1957|title=Weekend with Ezra Pound|url=|journal=The Nation|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wand, in a letter to the editor in December 1957, wrote that &lt;blockquote&gt;My main purpose in life is to fight against bigotry and racial prejudice while upholding the separate but equal station to which the laws of nature have entitled us. I am strongly against forced integration. I am strongly against miscegenation. I am against those who have lost their racial integrity and desire to be assimilated with the white race.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Wand later suggested that the ''Nation'' article cost him his job at a local [[YMCA]], and made him fear [[deportation]] to China. Wand's correspondences with Ezra Pound ended in 1958, shortly after Pound's release from St. Elizabeth's and subsequent return to Italy.

=== Collaboration with William Carlos Williams ===
Pound and Noel Stock put Wand in touch with [[William Carlos Williams]] after Williams expressed admiration for Wand's English translations of Chinese poetry in ''Edge,'' writing that his poems "are worth the trip half way round the world to have encountered.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wordswithoutborders.org/dispatches/article/william-carlos-williamss-chinese-experiment-jonathan-cohen|title=Empty Hills—Deep Woods—Green Moss: William Carlos Williams’s Chinese Experiment - Words Without Borders|last=Cohen|first=Jonathan|work=Words Without Borders|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wand visited Williams's house in [[Rutherford, New Jersey]] in March 1957 and the two began collaborating on a poetry collection, "The Cassia Tree" (published in [[New Directions Publishing|''New Directions'']] in 1966, after Williams's death), in which Wand provided word-by-word translations of 37 [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] and [[Song dynasty|Song]]-era poems and Williams turned them into English poems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Field|first=Stephen|date=Spring 1992|title="The Cassia Tree": A Chinese Macropoem|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/24565040|journal=William Carlos Williams Review|volume=18 (1)|pages=34–49|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams encouraged Wand to work on ''The Grandfather Cycle'', a sequence of 101 cantos (mirroring Pound's ''[[The Cantos|Cantos]]'') that Wand had begun in 1956. The unfinished work was meant to feature Wand's "fabulous ancestors," including his grandfather Wang Fenggao, one of the last [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|mandarin]] civil servants and founder of Guanghua University in Shanghai, with "comments on sex, marriage, and prostitution, and references to Eugenics." In one canto, Wand describes his grandfather, the protagonist, and his sexual prowess and diverse progeny: &lt;blockquote&gt;In Shanghai / by the Yangtze River / Where I watched / the ships / Coming in going out / of the harbor / And the tiny sampans / tremulous on the wave, / I used to sit / beneath the peach blossoms / Near the Lungwha Tower, / with swallows / Dipping over my head / and sandcrabs / Scurrying near my feet / And think about / The epic fornications / of my Fabulous / Grandfather. / Great man! / He sired / Eight sons / and some / Twenty bastards / by / Three wives / and / Four dozen / Concubines / in an age / when virginity / Was the eunuch's lot / and polygamy / the strong man's goal. / His offspring / Multiplied, / Spread from / Hangchow to / London, / Paris to / Mukden— / Some begotten / On ships, / Some made / in sampans; / All different: / Blonde hair, /Grey eyes, / Widow's peak, / Curly beard, / Till even / Tao-Kwan &amp; / T'ung Tse, / the emperors, / became envious of / him, / the plucker of peaches &amp; apple blossoms.&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Eliot Weinberger]], writing on Wand's artistic influences and outspoken bigotry, notes the difference between his relationship with Pound (who was an outspoken bigot) and Williams (who wasn't):&lt;blockquote&gt;What interests me [...] is that not only Pound (from whom we expect such things) but Williams and others were not merely tolerating but working with people like Wang in the 1950's—regardless of the daily reports of segregationist violence. That is, although Williams (unlike Pound) probably disagreed with Wang's extremism, his racism and political fanaticism were still considered as minor peccadilloes to be excused in the Artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/13456146|title=Works on paper, 1980-1986|last=Eliot|first=Weinberger|date=|publisher=New Directions|isbn=0811210006|location=[New York]|oclc=13456146}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== West Coast ==
Wand left New York for [[San Francisco]] in 1958, where he began as a reporter for ''The Chinese World'', a bilingual newspaper based on [[Chinatown, San Francisco|Chinatown]]. In 1959, he enrolled in a creative writing program at [[San Francisco State University|San Francisco State College]], where he continued to work on cantos for ''The Grandfather Cycle''. While spending time at local bookstores, he met [[Gary Snyder]], [[Philip Whalen]], [[Clarence Major]], and [[Cid Corman]]. 

After receiving his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in 1961, Wand moved to [[Honolulu]], where he taught at both the [[University of Hawaii]] and Iolani Preparatory School until 1964. While in Hawaii, Wand became acquainted with [[Polynesian narrative|Hawaiian and Samoan oral poetry]], and published several translations into English.

In 1964, Wand moved to [[Los Angeles]], where he began teaching at [[Santa Ana College]] and [[Santa Monica College|Santa Monica City College]], and then enrolled in the Comparative Literature doctoral program at [[University of Southern California|USC]]. In an [[arranged marriage]] set up by his mother in 1966, he married Yuet-fun and had one daughter.

Of his poetry in the 1960s and 1970s, Wand told [[James Laughlin]], “Other than [[Mao Zedong|Mao Tse-tung]] and two other poets in [[Hong Kong]], I am about the leading modern Chinese poet [...] No other Chinese poet has blended the Greco-Sino-Samurai African tradition in poetry as I have done." Ashe explained, "in my writing I aim at the concision of the Greek [[epigram]], the warmth and geniality of T'ang ''[[Shi (poetry)|shih]]'' and Sung ''[[Ci (poetry)|tz'u]]'', the virility and martial spirit of the [[Samurai#Arts|Zen-samurai arts]], and the form and changes of [[jazz]]."

=== Two Identities ===
In California, Wand became increasingly outspoken about his twin identities as a poet and an academic, and the separate names—David Rafael Wang and David Hsin-Fu Wand—that corresponded to them. In 1974, he said that&lt;blockquote&gt;"My role as poet has been kept distinct from my role as professor, and the two identities coexist in a symbiotic relationship much as Dr. Haggard and Mr, Jive. As David Hsin-Fu Wand I am chiefly a critic and teacher of English and comparative literature, while as David Rafael Wang I am a poet, found by most of my friends to be rather anti-intellectual in my poetry.&lt;/blockquote&gt;In 1975, Wand released ''The Intercourse'', a poetry collection that focused heavily on the physicality of the body, including poems about dance, gymnastics, bodybuilding, surfing, bathing, and heterosexual and homosexual encounters. The collection continues to espouse male chauvinist attitudes toward sexuality but also expresses sympathy for the [[Black Power movement]]: in one poem, he writes “If you don't get this, man, dig: / Us spade cats will shovel white trash / into the underground furnace of love."

As an academic, completed his doctorate in 1972, entitling his dissertation ''Cathay Revisited: The Chinese Tradition in the Poetry of Ezra Pound and Gary Snyder.'' In 1974, he taught at the [[University of New Mexico]], where he incorporated martial arts demonstrations into his lectures about Asian poetry, citing the [[samurai]] tradition of the warrior-poet. He expressed admiration for [[Muhammad Ali]] and discussed poetry with him during Ali's visit to [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]]. At the time of his death, Wand held a Comparative Literature position at the [[University of Texas at Dallas]].

=== Promoting Asian-American Literature ===
In 1974, Wand released an anthology of contemporary Asian-American writers entitled ''Asian-American Heritage: An Anthology of Prose and Poetry,'' which included works by writers of Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Filipino descent. 

Contributors to the anthology include [[Chung Ling]], John Hideyo Hamamura, [[Sadakichi Hartmann]], [[Richard E. Kim]], [[Kim Yong-ik|Kim Yong-Ik]], [[Alexander Kuo]], Stephen S. N. Liu, Pardee Lowe, [[Wing Tek Lum]], Suzi Mee, [[Janice Mirikitani]], [[Toshio Mori]], Paul Motoyoshi, Jr., Francis Naohiko Oka, [[John Okada]], [[Daniel Okimoto|Daniel I. Okimoto]], Irvin Paik, [[José García Villa|Jose Garcia Villa]], and [[Hisaye Yamamoto]], as well as many translations of Samoan and Hawaiian poetry by [[Armand Schwerner]] and Wand himself (credited as David Rafael Wang). Wand justifies including Polynesian oral translations because "Polynesian-American literature [...] belongs to American literature as much as Amerindian lores [...] It belongs to Asian-American literature because Hawaiians and Samoans are native Americans of the fiftieth state, which is geographically a part of Southeast Asia."

In his introduction, Wand explores the question of Asian American identity:&lt;blockquote&gt;Refusing to be "whitewashed" or "enlightened," these younger Asian-Americans are proud of being Americans of Asian ancestry. While with every word they write they proclaim their identity with Chinatowns or ''[[Japantown, San Francisco|Nihonmachi]]'', they write exclusively in American English, enlivened with the staccato rhythm of jazz. These rebellious young writers have mroe in common with [[Eldridge Cleaver|Elridge Cleaver]], [[Amiri Baraka|Imamu Baraka]], [[George Jackson (activist)|George Jackson]], and the militant blacks than with [[Lin Yutang]], [[C. Y. Lee (author)|C.Y. Lee]] (author of the popular ''Flower Drum Song''), and [[S. I. Hayakawa|S.I. Hayakawa]], whom they despise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1044433|title=Asian-American heritage; an anthology of prose and poetry.|others=Wand, David Happell Hsin-Fu, 1931-|isbn=0671487566|location=New York|oclc=1044433}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;After describing at length the [[history of Asian Americans]] from the 1800s to the present, he concludes by drawing a more explicit parallel between the Asian-American experience and black freedom struggles worldwide:&lt;blockquote&gt;Unashamed to be yellow, Asian-Americans of the postwar generations tend to align themselves with the [[Third-Worldism|Third World Movement]]. They find their inspiration in [[Frantz Fanon]], author of the ''[[The Wretched of the Earth|Wretched of the Earth]]'', rather than Hayakawa or Lin Yutang. Like the black rebels, with whom they feel a close spiritual affinity, they demand an end to racial injustice and fight for a proper assessment of their ethnic heritage.&lt;/blockquote&gt;In 1975, the [[Modern Language Association]] appointed Wand to their Commission on Minority Groups, at the time chaired by critic [[María Teresa Babín Cortés]]. 

=== Death ===
Wand died on April 7th, 1977 during a meeting of the Commission on Minority Groups at the [[Barbizon 63|Barbizon Plaza Hotel]] in New York. Authorities reported that he fell out of his 11th floor window, although whether he committed suicide, fell by accident, or was pushed remains unclear. His autopsy report ruled out foul play.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/04/09/archives/jump-or-fall-kills-dr-wand-poet-45-at-barbizon-plaza.html|title=Jump or Fall Kills Dr. Wand, Poet, 45  At Barbizon Plaza|last=Asbury|first=Edith Evans|access-date=2018-10-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Diosdado Ignacio "Dato" Macapagal Arroyo''' (born September 4, 1974) is the son of former [[Philippines|Philippine]] [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]].

==Early life==
'''Diosdado M. Arroyo''' was born on September 4, 1974 in [[Manila]], and comes from a family of public servants. His father, Atty. [[Mike Arroyo|Jose Miguel Arroyo]], is a descendant of the late former Senator Jose Ma. Arroyo of [[Iloilo]] and Gen. Aniceto Lacson who led the province of [[Negros Island|Negros]] in the revolt against Spain. His mother, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, is the daughter of the late former President [[Diosdado Macapagal]] whose ancestry can be traced to [[Lakandula]].

==Education==
Dato took elementary and high school education at the [[Ateneo de Manila University|Ateneo de Manila]] graduating in 1992. He finished his college education at the [[Ateneo de Naga University]] in October 1997 with a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration, Major in Legal Management.

==Career==
Dato worked as one of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo's speechwriters, and also served as an intern with the Ateneo Human Rights Center. He proudly considers himself a [[Bicolano people|Bicolano]] by choice, and has been actively supporting programs for the [[Bicol Region]] since graduating from college, particularly in areas concerning the provision of basic needs, Bicol tourism and sports. Recognizing his efforts, he was officially made an Adopted Son of Camarines Sur in November 2004, Lived somewhere in Brgy. Dayangdang and soon moved to Libmanan.

In 2005, Dato set up the Amigo Foundation, with the objective of helping out of those with less in life. The foundation has pushed for and promoted various livelihood, health, education, youth and sports programs not only within the Bicol Region, but around the country as well. 

Aside from the founding the Amigo Foundation, Dato was also the president of the Metro Manila Chapter of the [[Ateneo de Naga University|Ateneo de Naga Alumni Association]], and the Chairman of the Bicol Regional Tourism Summit.

==Political life==
Promoting his platform of TKO, or "Tubig, Kalye, Oportunidad" in the 2007 elections, Dato ran and won as Representative of the First District of [[Camarines Sur]], winning in over 80% of the barangays and leading by more than 30,000 votes over his nearest rival. In Congress, Dato is active as a member of 12 committees. He serves as Vice-Chairman in the Committees of Agriculture and Food, Youth and Sports Development, and Bicol Recovery and Development, making him the only first-term congressman with three vice-chairmanships. Aside from having a perfect attendance record in sessions, he has already filed numerous pro-poor bills and resolutions, including those on cheaper medicines, tax exemptions for minimum wage earners, and the use of agrarian land as collateral.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12286">'''Eugene Theodore Booth, Jr.''' (28 September 1912 &amp;ndash; 6 March 2004) was an [[United States|American]] [[nuclear physicist]]. He was a member of the historic Columbia University team which made the first demonstration of nuclear fission in the United States. During the [[Manhattan Project]], he worked on [[gaseous diffusion]] for [[isotope separation]]. He was the director of the design, construction, and operation project for the 385-Mev synchrocyclotron at the Nevis Laboratories, the scientific director of the SCALANT Research Center, and dean of graduate studies at Stevens Institute of Technology.Booth was the scientific director of the SCALANT Research Center, in [[Italy]].&lt;ref name="Eugene T. Booth"/&gt;

==Education==
He was born on 28 September 1912 in [[Rome, Georgia]] to Reverend Eugene Theodore Booth, Sr. and Lucy Cornelia Gibson.

Booth studied physics at the [[University of Georgia]], where he received his [[Bachelor of Science]] (1932), [[Master of Science]] (1934), and [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (1937) degrees. In 1934, he was a [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes Scholar]].&lt;ref name="Eugene T. Booth"&gt;[http://www.uga.edu/gm/archives/ArcRho.html Eugene T. Booth] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060911034137/http://fax.libs.uga.edu/hmans/1f/hargrett_manuscripts_C.pdf |date=2006-09-11 }} – University of Georgia, Rhodes Scholar recipient, 1934.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="26 March 2004"&gt;''Physicist Booth, Who Built Columbia’s Cyclotron, Dies'', ''Columbia University Record: News in Brief'' [http://www.columbia.edu/cu/record/archives/vol29/vol29_iss12/Pg.3_2912New.pdf (26 March 2004)].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

Booth joined the [[Columbia University]] faculty as a lecturer. He also helped professor [[John R. Dunning]] with his [[cyclotron]] construction and research. Thus began Booth’s lengthy professional collaboration with Dunning.&lt;ref name="26 March 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="John Ray Dunning 1907 &amp;ndash; 1975"&gt;Herbert L. Anderson ''[http://books.nap.edu/html/biomems/jdunning.pdf John Ray Dunning 1907 &amp;ndash; 1975]'' in ''Biographical Memoir'' 163-186 (National Academy of Sciences, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1938, the German chemists [[Otto Hahn]] and [[Fritz Strassmann]] sent a manuscript to ''[[Die Naturwissenschaften|Naturwissenschaften]]'' reporting they had detected the element [[barium]] after bombarding [[uranium]] with [[neutrons]];&lt;ref&gt;O. Hahn and F. Strassmann ''Über den Nachweis und das Verhalten der bei der Bestrahlung des Urans mittels Neutronen entstehenden Erdalkalimetalle'' (''On the detection and characteristics of the alkaline earth metals formed by irradiation of uranium with neutrons''), ''Naturwissenschaften'' Volume 27, Number 1, 11-15 (1939). The authors were identified as being at the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Chemie, Berlin-Dahlem. Received 22 December 1938.&lt;/ref&gt; simultaneously, they communicated these results to [[Lise Meitner]]. Meitner, and her nephew [[Otto Robert Frisch]], correctly interpreted these results as being [[nuclear fission]].&lt;ref&gt;Lise Meitner and O. R. Frisch ''Disintegration of Uranium by Neutrons: a New Type of Nuclear Reaction'', ''Nature'', Volume 143, Number 3615, 239-240 [http://www.nature.com/physics/looking-back/meitner/index.html (11 February 1939)]. The paper is dated 16 January 1939. Meitner is identified as being at the Physical Institute, Academy of Sciences, Stockholm. Frisch is identified as being at the Institute of Theoretical Physics, University of Copenhagen.&lt;/ref&gt; Frisch confirmed this experimentally on 13 January 1939.&lt;ref&gt;O. R. Frisch ''Physical Evidence for the Division of Heavy Nuclei under Neutron Bombardment'', ''Nature'', Volume 143, Number 3616, 276-276 [http://dbhs.wvusd.k12.ca.us/webdocs/Chem-History/Frisch-Fission-1939.html (18 February 1939)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123165907/http://dbhs.wvusd.k12.ca.us/webdocs/Chem-History/Frisch-Fission-1939.html |date=January 23, 2009 }}. The paper is dated 17 January 1939. [The experiment for this letter to the editor was conducted on 13 January 1939; see Richard Rhodes ''The Making of the Atomic Bomb'' 263 and 268 (Simon and Schuster, 1986).]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, Hahn  received the [[Nobel Prize for Chemistry]] for the discovery of nuclear fission. Some historians have documented the history of the discovery of nuclear fission and believe Meitner should have been awarded the Nobel Prize with Hahn.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ruth Lewin Sime]] ''From Exceptional Prominence to Prominent Exception: Lise Meitner at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry'' [http://www.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/KWG/Ergebnisse/Ergebnisse24.pdf Ergebnisse 24] Forschungsprogramm ''Geschichte der Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gesellschaft im Nationalsozialismus'' (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Lewin Sime ''Lise Meitner: A Life in Physics'' (University of California, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Crawford, Ruth Lewin Sime, and Mark Walker ''A Nobel Tale of Postwar Injustice'', ''Physics Today'' Volume 50, Issue 9, 26-32 (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

Even before it was published, Meitner’s and Frisch’s interpretation of the work of Hahn and Strassmann crossed the Atlantic Ocean with [[Niels Bohr]], who was to lecture at [[Princeton University]]. [[Isidor Isaac Rabi]] and [[Willis Lamb]], two [[Columbia University]] physicists working at Princeton, heard the news and carried it back to Columbia. Rabi said he told Fermi; Fermi gave credit to Lamb. It was soon clear to a number of scientists at Columbia that they should try to detect the energy released in the nuclear fission of uranium from neutron bombardment. On 25 January 1939, Booth was a member of the experimental team at Columbia University which conducted the first nuclear fission experiment in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;H. L. Anderson, E. T. Booth, J. R. Dunning, E. Fermi, G. N. Glasoe, and F. G. Slack ''The Fission of Uranium'', ''Phys. Rev.'' Volume 55, Number 5,  511 - 512 (1939). Institutional citation: Pupin Physics Laboratories, Columbia University, New York, New York. Received 16 February 1939.&lt;/ref&gt; which was done in the basement of [[Pupin Hall]]; the other members of the team were [[Herbert L. Anderson]], [[John R. Dunning]], [[Enrico Fermi]], [[G. N. Glasoe|G. Norris Glasoe]], and [[Francis G. Slack]].&lt;ref name="John Ray Dunning 1907 &amp;ndash; 1975"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bederson.org"&gt;Bederson, Benjamin ''The Physical Tourist: Physics in New York City'', ''Physics in Perspective'' Volume 5, 87-121 [http://www.bederson.org/bensr/nyc.pdf (2003)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041230140845/http://www.bederson.org/bensr/nyc.pdf |date=2004-12-30 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Rhodes ''The Making of the Atomic Bomb'' 267-270 (Simon and Schuster, 1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], Booth was a member of Columbia’s scientific staff in the Division of War Research. During the [[Manhattan Project]], Dunning conducted pioneering work at Columbia University on [[gaseous diffusion]] to separate uranium isotopes; others working on the project included Booth, Henry A. Boorse, [[Willard Libby|Willard F. Libby]], [[Alfred O. C. Nier]], and [[Francis G. Slack]].&lt;ref name="26 March 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bederson.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boney, F. N. and Michael Adams ''A Pictorial History of the University of Georgia'' 114 (University of Georgia, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II, Booth was director of the project for the design, construction, and operation of a 385-[[Electronvolt|MeV]] [[Synchrocyclotron]] at the [[Nevis Laboratories]] in [[Irvington, New York|Irvington-on-the-Hudson]]. The project was a collaborative effort of [[Columbia University]], the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]], and the [[Office of Naval Research]].&lt;ref name="John Ray Dunning 1907 &amp;ndash; 1975"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Atomic Glue'', ''Time'' [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,815533,00.html?promoid=googlep 15 October 1951].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Leon M.

He died on 6 March 2004 in [[Briarcliff Manor, New York]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9060">'''Faubion Bowers''' (29 January 1917 – 17 November 1999) was a noted academic and writer in the area of [[Asian Studies]], especially [[Japanese theatre]]. He also wrote the first full-length biography of Russian composer [[Alexander Scriabin]]. During the [[Occupied Japan|Allied Occupation of Japan]], he was General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s personal [[Japanese language]] [[interpreter]] and [[aide-de-camp]].

==Biography==
Bowers was born in [[Miami, Oklahoma]]. He graduated from [[Columbia University]] in 1935 and the [[Juilliard School|Juilliard Graduate School of Music]] in 1939. Bowers taught at [[Hosei University]] in [[Tokyo]] from 1940 to 1941.

After the surrender of [[Japan]], he was the interpreter for the advance party of 150 US personnel which flew into the [[Atsugi]] airfield on 28 August 1945. As MacArthur's interpreter he lived at the American Embassy with the MacArthur family, and served as interpreter at the initial meeting between MacArthur and Emperor [[Hirohito]]. While an official [[Censorship|censor]] for Japanese theater he became its champion.

After the war he taught at the [[New School for Social Research]], and at [[Kansas University]] as Distinguished Professor of Asian Studies. He also served as music editor or reviewer for various periodicals.

Bowers became a respected authority on oriental art and culture, writing scholarly monographs on such subjects as [[Dance in India|Indian dance]] and [[Theatre of Japan|Japanese theatre]], as well as a definitive two-volume biography of the Russian composer [[Alexander Scriabin]].  His book, ''[[Japanese Theatre]]'', was published in 1952 and is highly recommended by [[James Michener]], in his book on Japanese [[ukiyo-e]] prints, ''The Floating World'', as "one of the foremost works of scholarship dealing with Japanese culture to come out of the occupation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

He was married from 1951&amp;ndash;1966 to [[India]]n writer [[Santha Rama Rau]]. They had one son who, according to his parents, traveled widely and lived an affluent vagabond existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Bowers was interviewed for [[Columbia University]]'s Oral History Project in 1960. He wrote the first full-length biography of Russian composer [[Alexander Scriabin]] (1872–1915) in two volumes (1970, 2nd edition 1996) and was a member of the [[Bagby Foundation for the Musical Arts]] in [[New York City]]. He died in New York City on 17 November 1999.

==Kabuki==
Bowers is known as ''The Man Who Saved Kabuki'' in Japan. While on his way to [[Indonesia]] in 1940, he visited [[Tokyo]]'s [[Kabuki-za]] where he watched the famous [[Chūshingura|Kanadehon Chūshingura]] [[kabuki]] play, and was very moved by kabuki as an art form. Four years later he returned to Japan as General MacArthur's secretary during the American Occupation of Japan. At this time the [[Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers]] thought kabuki should be banned for its portrayal of feudal values. Bowers was strongly against this, stating that "Kabuki is not only Japanese culture but world culture and must be preserved for the future." He promoted kabuki plays and instructed that a "Dream Team" cast of big kabuki stars should be assembled to perform "Kanadehon Chūshingura" in 1947. This performance and many others performed at the [[Tokyo Army College]] were a success, and the cast later performed the play in 1950 in East Coast venues across the US.

==Awards==
Bowers was awarded the [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]] in 1944, and an [[Oak Leaf Cluster]] in 1945.

In 1985, Bowers was awarded the [[Order of the Sacred Treasure]] by the government of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B03E4DB133CF931A15752C1A96F958260&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=Faubion+Bowers Pace, Eric.

In the [[Philippines]], varying naming customs are observed, whether it is given name first, family name last, a mixture of native conventions with those of neighbouring territories, etc. The most common iteration amongst [[Filipino people|Filipinos]] is a blend of the older Spanish system and Anglo-American conventions, where there is a distinction between the "Christian name" from "surname". The construct of having several names in the middle name convention is common to all systems, but to have multiple "first" names and only one middle and last name is a result of the blending of American and Spanish naming customs. The [[Tagalog language]] is one of the few national languages in Asia to use the Western name order. Thus, the Philippine naming custom is coincidentally identical to the [[Spanish name|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese name]] customs.

For the most part, most Filipinos abide by the Spanish system of using both paternal and maternal surnames, the latter constituting the "middle name". An example would be ''Jose Cuyegkeng y Mangahas'' becoming ''Jose Mangahas Cuyegkeng'', where the [[Spanish naming customs#The particle "y" (and)|particle '''''y''''']] is used only for legal purposes and is otherwise dropped. The middle name in its natural sense would have been the second name if the person had one, but is never counted as an individual's given name.

Filipinos tend to use middle names and surnames always.

==Given names==
Filipinos may have one or more official given names (as registered in their birth certificates and baptismal certificates) and various types of temporary or permanent nicknames. Filipinos have a penchant for giving themselves or each other various sorts of nicknames and monikers. Some nicknames are carried for life while others are used only with certain groups so a person can have multiple nicknames at different ages or among different groups of people.

===Abbreviations, combinations, and elisions===
Long given names can be shortened in various ways. ''Emmanuel'' can become ''Eman'', ''Manuel'', ''Manolo'', ''Manny'', or ''Manoy''. ''Consolación'' has been converted to ''Connie'', ''Cons'', ''Sol'', or ''Chona''.

Filipino women with two given names such as ''María Cristina'' or ''María Victoria'' may choose to abbreviate the very common ''María'' (in honour of the [[Virgin Mary]]) as ''Ma''. (with a [[full stop]]), thus rendering these given names as ''Ma. Cristina'' or ''Ma. Victoria''. Filipino males with two given names such as ''José Mariano'' or ''José Gerardo'' could follow the same practice of abbreviating ''Josés'' as ''Jo.'', but this is not as consistent. Some Muslims would follow conventions found in neighbouring [[Malaysia]], [[Brunei]], and [[Indonesia]], abbreviating "''Muhammad''" (and its variants, ''[[viz.]]'' "''Mohammed''", etc.) as "''Muhd.''" or "''Mohd.''"

Another common practice rarely seen in other cultures (but common with [[Spanish name#María and José|Spanish conventions]]) is to [[elision|elide]] or combine multiple given names into one nickname. The aforementioned ''María Cristina'' and ''María Victoria'' may thus acquire the nicknames ''Maricris'' and ''Marivic''. Thus the Filipino names ''Maricel'', ''Maritoni'', ''Marijo'', ''Maritess'', and ''Maricon'' come from  ''Maria Celia (or Celeste)'', ''Marie Antoinette'', ''María Josefa'' (or ''Josefina)'', ''María Teresa'', and ''María Concepción'' (or ''Consolación)''. The popular male nicknames ''Joma'', ''Jomar'', and ''Jomari'' are derived from [[concatenation|concatenating]] ''José Mariano''. ''Jestoni'' was derived from ''Jesús Antonio''. These types of nicknames have become so common that they have also been registered as a child's official given name by the parents (e.g., ''Maricris Llamador Gunigundo'' or ''Maricris Ll. Gunigundo''). The child ''Sidperl'' got his name when his parents combined their given names ''Isidro'' and ''Perlita''.

Sometimes, this practice results in a completely new, unprecedented given name. Former [[Vice President of the Philippines|Vice-President]] [[Jejomar Binay]]'s given name is a combination of ''[[Holy Family|Jesus-Joseph-Mary]]''. A former senator's first name was ''Heherson'', derived from ''He-Her-Son'' (from "He, Her [Virgin Mary]'s Son", referring to [[Jesus Christ]]). The unique, patriotic female names ''[[Luzviminda]]'' and its variants ''Minvilu'' and ''Vizminda'' come from concatenating the names of the country's three main island groups: [[Luzon]], [[Visayas]], and [[Mindanao]].

Some first names like ''Lodegrano'' or ''Lorimer'' may have been invented on the spot by the parents or derived from some partially remembered foreign term. Other coined first names have unusual spellings or [[spelling pronunciation|spellings which are pronounced differently]].

===Honorifics and titles===
Honorifics and titles are sometimes used in place of a person's actual name. Thus, the titles for family elders are often used by the younger persons and then adopted by the wider community: ''Apo'' (grandson/granddaughter). ''Lolo'' (grandfather) and ''Lola'' (grandmother) are used for senior elders; ''Tatay/Itay/Ama'' (father) or ''Tito/Tiyo/Tsong'' (uncle) and ''Nanay/Inay/Ina'' (mother) or ''Tita/Tiya/Tsang'' (aunt) for middle-aged elders; ''Manong'' or ''Kuya'' (elder brother) and ''Manang'' or ''Ate'' (elder sister) for anyone slightly older than the person speaking.

People in the community are often addressed by their military or police rank, professional titles or job descriptions, either with or without their names. ''Architect'', ''Attorney'', ''Engineer'', ''Dok/Doctor'', ''Direk/Director'', ''Manager'', ''Bisor'' (supervisor), ''Boss'', ''Tsip/Chief'', are used in the same way as ''Mister'', ''Miss'', ''Ms''., or ''Mrs''. especially when the addressee's name is not yet known by the speaker. This is often done as a sign of respect and to avoid giving offence. Even foreigners who work in the Philippines or are naturalized Filipino citizens, including foreign spouses of Filipinos, who hold some of these titles and descriptions are addressed in the same way as their Filipino counterparts, although it may sound awkward or unnatural to some of them or language purists who argue that the basic titles that precede surnames and either ''Sir'' or ''Ma'am/Madam'' are to be employed for simplicity. Also, ''Sir'' and ''Madam/Ma'am'' are not to be used precede a nickname.

===Numerals and birth order patterns===
People with the same name as their father are registered as ''Junior'' (abbreviated to ''Jr''.) or numbered with Roman numerals (III, IV, V, etc.); their father adds ''Senior'' (''Sr''.) after his surname or suffix. Inevitably, the younger person tends to be nicknamed ''Junior'' or ''Jun'' permanently. One person's nickname became ''Third'' because his full name was ''Alfonso Ma. Roxas Cuyegkeng III'' (this is a fictional name for example purposes). Thus a family will necessarily bestow a variety of unofficial nicknames to distinguished the various people having with nearly identical official given names.

The names of children in some families may follow a certain pattern, such as beginning with a certain letter of the alphabet, e.g. ''Diego Arnel'', ''Diamond Amelia'', ''Danford Arman'', ''Dolores Allison'', such that all their initials will be the same, i.e., ''DAZL'' if the middle name is ''Zulueta'' and the surname is ''Lim''. One group of siblings was named after countries (''Arabia'', ''Australia'', ''Aruba'', ''Albania'') while another was named after car trademarks (''Ford'', ''Mercedes'', ''Bentley'', ''Maserati''). Other names seemed to have been taken from popular brand names, food, fruits, and flowers: ''Ramcar'', ''Cherry Pie'', ''Apple'', ''Peachy'', ''Pepsi'', ''Brandy''. World Champion boxer Manny Pacquiao named his two daughters ''Queen Elizabeth'' and ''Princess''&lt;ref name=McGeown/&gt; while his wife is named ''Jinky''. Former Philippine Senator Joker Arroyo (legal name) has a brother named Jack.&lt;ref name=McGeown/&gt;

Many nicknames are bestowed by parents or other elders on children while they are still toddlers. Examples are the numerous ''Boy'', ''Toto/Totoy'' (young boy), ''Girlie'', ''Nene'' (young girl), ''Baby'' and similar types of pet names given to people who received them as kids and carried them into adult life and seniority. They've carried the nickname all their lives and see no incongruity in being called ''Boy'' or ''Baby'' even when in their sixth decade. Some are diminutives of the actual name, such as ''Pepito'' for ''Pepe'', ''Juanito'' for ''Juan'' (or the English form ''Johnny'' for ''John''), and ''Nenita'' for ''Nena''. Thus, a person used to being called ''Joselito'' (''Little Joseph'') as a child may retain the nickname as an adult even if he could already be called ''José'' or ''Joseph''.

===Reversals, indigenised names and Anglicisation===
The Filipino given name ''Dranreb'' was invented by reversing the spelling of the English name ''Bernard'', while someone calling himself ''Nosrac'' bears the legal name ''Carson''. [[Joseph Estrada|Joseph Ejército Estrada]], [[List of Presidents of the Philippines|Thirteenth]] [[President of the Philippines]], began as a movie actor and received his nickname ''Erap'' as an adult; it comes from ''Pare'' spelled backwards (from Spanish ''compadre'', ''fellow godparent'') but now means ''mate'' or ''buddy'' in Filipino.&lt;ref name=McGeown/&gt;

An old custom is to replace or insert Filipino phonemes into a Spanish or English name: ''Mariano'' becomes ''Nano'', ''Edwin'' becomes ''Aweng'', ''Eduardo'' becomes ''Dwarding'', ''Roberto'' becomes ''Berting'', ''Ponciano'' becomes either ''Popoy'', ''Onse'', or ''Syano''. Sometimes there is a tendency to convert a grand-sounding given name into something very ordinary, such as when ''John Paul'' becomes ''JayPee'', ''Peter John'' becomes ''Peejong'', ''Anthony'' becomes ''Tonyo'', ''Ronald'' becomes ''Onad'', ''María Elena'' becomes ''Ineng'' or ''Inyang'', or ''Ambrosia'' becomes ''Brosya''.

Complementary to this is the practise of Anglicising (with the implication of "modernising") a Spanish given name. Thus ''José Roberto'' becomes ''Joseph Robert'' (further shortened to ''Joebert''). ''Eduardo'' becomes ''Edward'' and then ''Eddie'' or ''Eddieboy'' (sometimes further shortened to ''Daboy''). ''Consolación'' becomes ''Connie''; ''Corazón'' becomes ''Cora'' or ''Cory''; ''Juan'' becomes ''John'' or ''Johnny''; ''Teresita'' or ''Teresa'' becomes ''Terê'', ''Tessa'', or ''Tessie''; and ''Gracia'' becomes ''Grace''.

===Monikers and progressional names===
The variety of Filipino names, some of them with negative connotations in Anglicised form, often take foreigners by surprise.&lt;ref name=McGeown&gt;{{cite web|author=Kate McGeown |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/9435751.stm |title=Playful Filipino Names Hard to Get Used To |publisher=[[BBC News]]| date=27 March 2011 |access-date=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most Filipinos don't notice any negative English connotations, however, unless somebody points it out.&lt;ref name=McGeown/&gt;

Many Filipino celebrities and high-status personalities, such as actors and politicians, don't mind having such types of nicknames;&lt;ref name=McGeown/&gt; in fact, their nicknames are often more well-known than their actual given names. Film and television celebrity [[German Moreno]] didn't mind using the nickname ''Kuya Germs'' (''kuya'' = elder brother). National Artist of the Philippines for Fashion Design, José ''Pitoy'' Moreno, would never be recognized anywhere under his official given name, but so far, he is the only prominent ''Pitoy'' in the world.

===Combined names===
It is very common for parents to combine their given names to create a name for their child. Examples:
*Maria + Carlos = Maricar
*Elvin + Liza = Elliza
*Marino + Erlinda = Marinerl
*Pearlisita + Ian = Pearlianne

==Middle names==
===Maternal names===
Christians (as well as certain Muslims, Chinese Filipinos, and others) in the [[Philippines]] formerly followed [[Spanish naming customs|naming patterns]] practiced throughout the Spanish-speaking world (the practice of having the father's surname followed by the mother's surname, the two being connected by the particle "y", which means "and", such as ''Guillermo Cu-Unjieng y Araullo''). If the second surname starts with ''i'', ''y'', ''hi'' or ''hy'', the particle becomes ''e'', following Spanish rules of euphony, as in ''[[Eduardo Dato e Iradier]]''. Sometimed this second rule is overlooked.
[[File:Janet Lim-Napoles mugshot.jpg|thumb|Mug shot of [[Janet Lim-Napoles]] with her name on a placard showing "Janet Napoles y Lim". Notice the use of Spanish order of paternal and maternal surnames, which are Napoles and Lim, respectively, separated by the [[Spanish naming customs#The particle y (and)|particle ''y'']]]]
This practice changed when the Philippines became a [[United States]] colony in the early 20th century. The order was reversed to follow the conventional American form "Christian name - [[Middle name]] -
Surname," which in this case is actually "Christian name - Mother's surname - Father's surname" (Francisco Concepcion Casas or simply Francisco C. Casas). The conjunction ''y'' was dropped, although it is still used in certain contexts today (most notably names in [[criminal record]]s, like the names used in placards used in [[mug shot]]s, such as shown in the image on the right).

Currently, the middle name is usually, though not always, the mother's maiden name (followed by the last name which is the father's surname). This is the opposite of what is done in Spanish-speaking countries and is similar to the way surnames are done in [[Portugal]] and [[Brazil]]. The blending of American and Spanish naming customs results in the way Filipinos write their names today.

Furthermore, application forms for various legal documents define the first name as the "Christian name(s)," the middle name as the "mother's maiden surname" (this becomes the basis for the middle initial), and the surname as the "father's surname."

Bearing the mother's maiden surname as the middle name or middle initial is more important to a majority of Filipinos than to use one of the given names as a middle name or middle initial. Filipino culture usually allocates equal value to the lineage from both mother and father except in some prominent families who practice a strictly patriarchal system (usually of Spanish or Chinese heritage).

Exceptions apply in the case of children with single parents. Children born out of wedlock are registered under the mother's maiden name (if still unmarried), applying her middle name (maternal surname) for the child's last name, respectively. The unmarried father must resort to legal and administrative procedures if he desires to acknowledge the child as his own and for the child to be registered with his own surname (in which case the child will use the mother's surname as his/her middle name). Likewise, children raised by single fathers take the current surname (paternal surname) with no middle name, whether or not the mother's identity is known. These exceptions also apply to Filipino children who have non-Filipino descent.

===Maiden and married names===
When a woman marries, she may: use her maiden first name and surname and add her husband's surname; use her maiden first name and her husband's surname; or use her husband’s full name, but prefixing a word indicating that she is his wife, such as “Mrs.”&lt;ref name="SNCivilCode"&gt;{{cite act|title=Civil Code of the Philippines|type=Republic Act|number=386|article=XIII: Use of Surnames|articletype=Title|date=June 18, 1949|url=http://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1949/06/18/republic-act-no-386/}}&lt;/ref&gt; She may also decline to adopt her husband's surname and continue to use her maiden name since there is no law in the Philippines which obligates a married woman to use the surname of her husband.&lt;ref name="PAOOp"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://manilatimes.net/no-philippine-law-obligates-married-woman-to-drop-her-maiden-name/14771/ | title=No Philippine law obligates married woman to drop her maiden name | work=Manila Times | date=July 1, 2013 | accessdate=February 4, 2014 | author=Acosta, Persida}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*A woman may use her birth surname after marriage. However, once she has opted to use the surname of her husband, she shall continue using it until her marriage with her husband is validly terminated, such as through [[annulment]], subject to certain conditions.&lt;ref name="SNCivilCode" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PAOOp" /&gt;
*All children from this marriage will automatically have the mother's birth surname as their middle name, and the father's surname as their surname.&lt;ref name="SNCivilCode" /&gt;

Until the middle of the 20th century, it was common for married Filipino women to insert the particle "de" ("of") between her maiden surname and husband's surname (as in ''Margarita Mangahas de Cuyegkeng'' or ''Margarita M. de Cuyegkeng''), another common Spanish naming custom. However, this practice is no longer common.

Married Filipino women who are professionals may choose to hyphenate their surnames (such as ''Margarita Margarita - Cuyegkeng'', instead of simply ''Margarita Cuyegkeng'' or ''Margarita M. Cuyegkeng''), at least in professional use, and use it socially even if legal documents follow a different naming pattern. This practice allows others to identify them after their marriage and helps others keep track of their professional achievements; otherwise, her unmarried and married names would seem to refer to two different persons (''Margarita Gomez Mangahas'' as compared to ''Margarita Mangahas-Cuyegkeng'').

===Middle initials===
Before digitization of records, middle initials and sorting of surnames follow the first letter of the name after Hispanic ''de'', ''dela'', ''del'', ''delos''. For example, the name ''Jose delos Santos dela Cruz'' is shortened as ''Jose S. dela Cruz'' and surname sorted on the letter C. Today, the middle initial must be the letter D (''Jose D. dela Cruz'') and surname sorted in the letter D.

==Surnames==
===Indigenous languages===
Though most Filipinos adopted Spanish surnames, some chose surnames that derive from words in local languages, like Tagalog, Visayan (Cebuano and Hiligaynon), Ilocano, Kapampangan and Pangasinan. Many indigenous surnames derive from words displaying qualities of people, especially those related to strength (e.g. Tagalog ''Macaraeg'' and ''Panganiban''), defiance (e.g. Tagalog ''Dimayuga'') or settlement (e.g. Cebuano/Hiligaynon ''Magbanua''). Most indigenous surnames have traditional spellings altered to follow [[Spanish orthography]] rules, therefore obscuring their meanings.&lt;ref name=PilipinoExpress /&gt;

===Cordilleran===
Unlike their lowlander counterparts, [[Igorot people|Igorots]] living in the [[Cordillera Central (Luzon)|Cordillera Central]] in northern [[Luzon]] were not conquered by the Spaniards, thereby preserving their naming customs from foreign influence. Each group had their own naming customs, but generally, like [[Indonesian names]], there is only one given name and no surname to speak of. The given name's meaning is usually connected to natural phenomena or objects, such as ''danum'' for water. It was only the Igorots who have had interacted with Spaniards and lowlanders for trade who were given a name that follows the binomial "first name"-"surname" system, such as Mateo Cariño and Mateo Carantes.

It was only at the turn of the 20th century and the advent of the [[History of the Philippines (1898–1946)|American occupation of the Philippines]] that the naming customs of the Igorots slowly conformed with the national legal naming system used to today, aided by the evangelization efforts of American Protestant missionaries. Most older people, however, still keep the singular given name given to them by their parents while also using the so-called "Christian names" to conform to Philippine law. The singular given names of some individuals living in the early 20th century have since been adopted as a surname by their descendants.

===Spanish===
{{see also|Catálogo alfabético de apellidos}}
Almost all Filipinos had [[Spanish naming customs|Spanish]] or Spanish-sounding surnames imposed on them for taxation purposes, but a number of them have indigenous Filipino surnames. On 21 November 1849, Governor General Narciso Clavería y Zaldúa issued a decree stating that Filipinos should adopt Spanish surnames to make census counting easier. Some Filipinos retained their native pre-colonial names, especially those who were exempted from the Clavería decree such as the descendants of rulers of the ''Maharlika'' or noble class. These surnames of the native nobility include Lacandola, [[Macapagal]], Macabulos, and Tupas whom each descended from different [[Datu]]s. They were allowed to keep the name to claim tax exemptions.

The Spanish surname category provides the [[List of common Filipino surnames|most common surnames]] in the Philippines.&lt;ref name="geocities.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/heartland/ranch/9121/surnames.html|title=List of some surnames in the Philippines|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/heartland/ranch/9121/surnames.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+02:24:29|archivedate=2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the course of time, some Spanish surnames were altered (with some eventually diverged/displaced their original spelling), as resulted from illiteracy among the poor and farming class bearing such surnames, creating confusion in the civil registry and a sense of detachment from their better-off relatives. Except for the "Ñ", Filipino surnames from Spanish are written without accents from American influence.

===Chinese===
Many modern-day [[Chinese Filipino]]s, mostly [[Hoklo people|Hoklo]], have last names with one syllable like Lim, Cheng, Lao, Ang, Lo, Chua, Ong, Chiu, Yan, Uy, Ching, Sin, Go, Tan, Yap, Cu, Ke, Wu, So, Yu, Dy, Khu and Sy. However, early [[Chinese Filipino]] families took on the complete name of their [[patriarch]], thus their names had three syllables. These were adopted into the mainstream [[Surnames by country#The Philippines|Filipino surnames]] and do not exist anywhere else in the world. Their names were transcribed using the Spanish orthography in effect during the 19th century.&lt;ref name=PilipinoExpress&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pilipino-express.com/history-a-culture/in-other-words/895-claverias-catalogue.html|title=Clavería's catalogue|first=Paul|last=Morrow|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese===
Some Filipinos bear Japanese surnames.

These people in military service during that time are descendants of [[World War II]] Japanese soldiers who were captured, pardoned and settled in the Philippines, or descended from pre-war immigrants who became economically successful in their ventures in the country, and married local Filipino women. Japanese migrants in the Philippines in the early 19th Century are categorically [[Issei]], or "first generation", who have been born in Japan and migrated to the country or to other countries primarily to [[United States|U.S]], [[Brazil]], [[Mexico]] and [[Peru]]; their descendants are either full-blooded Japanese who extend their descent categorically to [[Nisei]] and [[Sansei]], or a generation of Filipino-Japanese with combined or Filipinized cultural practices and lifestyles less often categorized to both Nisei or Sansei. However, there's no official categorization of the generation of Japanese migrants unlike in U.S. and Brazil since post-war developments in the Filipino social landscape enabled them to be socially and economically integrated to the Filipino society, making their cultural practices and lifestyles fully Filipino and ignoring or obscuring their Japanese heritage.

More recent economic developments in both countries enabled exchanges of both peoples for various economic reasons, whether for employment, higher career opportunities, business expansions, or philanthropic ventures, thus a few Japanese expatriates making such ventures settled in the country today, marrying local Filipino women and raising a generation of Filipino-Japanese children taking their education in the Philippines and living in a mix of Filipino and Japanese cultural lifestyles.

===Anglo-American English===
These are the surnames of Filipinos of British and/or American heritage, as these surnames are both shared by the Americans and the British. But much of the Filipinos bearing these surnames were more descended from their American fathers or grandfathers, whom a handful of them settled in the Philippines before the Second World War. Today, with the recent influx of British expatriates who settled in the country and married local Filipino women gave rise of the modern generation of Filipino-British children.

===German surnames===
A number of Filipino-[[Germans]], Filipino-[[Austrians]], Filipino-[[Swiss people|Swiss]] and Filipino descendants of [[German Americans]] bear these surnames. Some have German surnames because of the immigration of the Jewish communities from Europe during the Commonwealth era in the Philippines. A few of the Filipinos with German heritage became television and film personalities since 1950s.

===Moro===
The use of [[Arabic name]]s is prominent among the [[Islam in the Philippines|Filipino Muslim]]s. The country has Islamic influence from what are now Arabs, Persians, Malays, Indonesians, and Indians, who have traded with ancestors of Filipinos, and introduced [[Islam in the Philippines|Islam]] to the southern parts of the archipelago beginning in the 13th century. Some names, including Fátima, Omar, and Soraya, bear direct influence from Arab sources and Spanish ones, given the latter's period [[Al-Andalus|under Moorish rule]]. Filipino Muslims, or called "Moros" as how the Spaniards called them, also bear and maintain unique blend of indigenous Moro and Arabic surnames, some are registered with Spanish renderings. Among Maranao families, some Maranao surnames are often used as a given name to their children. Others may or might have borne surnames from their mothers, manifesting scant matrilineal practice.

===Other surnames of foreign origins===
Filipinos who hold middle or family names from other non-English-speaking nations also follow the conventions mentioned in this article, despite the proper naming customs that are followed in those nations. Such surnames indicate their foreign heritage, primarily due to the influx of migrants and workers from Europe and South Asia, and more recently from Middle East.

Below is a short list of known surnames of other foreign origins. Some of these surnames have their spelling altered over time, making their foreign origins or nationalities obscure and often hard to determine. Possible and apparent nationality or ethnicity of these surnames are enclosed in the parentheses:

*Bagatsíng (Indian, Bhagat Singh)
*Butra (Putra) (Indonesian)
*Cailles (French)
*Castiglione (Italian)
*Choudhary (Indian)

*Dharamdas (Indian)
*Gleyvohba (possibly from a Russian female immigrant bearing a surname Glebova, Глебова)
*Heydarian (Iranian)
*Jaworski (Polish)
*Kazanidis (Greek)
*Khan (Indian or Pakistani)
*Kohansal (Iranian)
*Kurdi (Lebanese)

'''Frederick Hockley''' (1809 &amp;ndash; November 10, 1885) was a British [[occult]]ist and [[Scrying|scryer]] who was a London-based [[Freemasonry|Freemason]] and a member of the [[Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia]].&lt;ref&gt;Cavendish, Richard. (1977). ''A History of Magic''. Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson. p. 138. {{ISBN|978-0297772521}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Decker, Ronald; Dummett, Michael. (2002). ''A History of the Occult Tarot, 1870-1970''. Duckworth. pp. 44-45. {{ISBN|978-0715631225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

Hockley avidly collected and transcribed over many years a vast library of important occult books, works and texts, including a [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucian]] manuscript belonging to [[Sigismund Bacstrom]], who was initiated into an occult society in [[Mauritius]] in 1794. This text had a great influence on British [[occultism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jwmt.org/v2n14/hockley_article.html "Frederick Hockley: A Hidden Force behind the 19th Century English Occult Revival"]. Journal of the Western Mystery Tradition.&lt;/ref&gt;

He established the [[Spiritualism|spiritualist]] Croydon Circle in 1853, in which he claimed to be in communication with a group of [[spirit]]s controlled by the Crowned Angel of the Seventh Sphere. This predated the first spiritualist organization in London, known as the Charing Cross Spirit Circle formed in January, 1857.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, G. K. (2013). ''Spiritualism and Society''. p. 92. Routledge. {{ISBN|978-0415714624}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hockley practiced the art of '[[Scrying|crystallomancy]]' or 'the art of invocating spirits by the crystal' and believed this to be one of the most important forms of spirit communication. He kept notes on many of his experiments and experiences, accumulating a vast amount of information.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, Chic; Cicero, Sandra Tabatha. (2003). ''The Essential Golden Dawn: An Introduction to High Magic''. Llewellyn Publications. p. 38. {{ISBN|978-0738703107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is said that through close knit London circles, his freemasonry connections and SRIA connections, as well as the extensive and vast library he left behind him on his passing that he contributed to the forming and curriculum of 'The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn'. It is also alleged that the original cipher manuscript on which the Golden Dawn was formed may well have been written by Hockley.

Hockley was a close friend of [[Kenneth R. H. Mackenzie]] and other British Rosicrucians and occultists of his period. He was purportedly a pupil of [[Francis Barrett (occultist)|Francis Barrett]], author of ''[[The Magus (Barrett book)|The Magus]]'' (1801).

In March, 1884 he joined the [[London Spiritualist Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;M. A. Oxon ([[William Stainton Moses]]). The London Spiritualist Alliance. Light. Volume 4. March 15, 1884. p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;

Hockley died November 10, 1885.

'''Harold Keke''' (born 1971) is a [[Solomon Islands]] [[warlord]] involved with the [[Guadalcanal Revolutionary Army]] (GRA).

== Biography ==
The grandson of one of the founders of the [[South Seas Evangelical Church]] in Australia,&lt;ref name="trans"&gt;{{cite web| last = O'Shea| first = David| title = Harold Keke - Rebel or Raskol| publisher = ''[[Dateline (Australian TV program)|Dateline]]''| date = 2003-07-03| url = http://news.sbs.com.au/dateline/index.php?page=archive&amp;daysum=2003-07-30| accessdate = 2007-07-07| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070611071727/http://news.sbs.com.au/dateline/index.php?page=archive&amp;daysum=2003-07-30| archivedate = 2007-06-11| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Keke was raised a Catholic in the Solomons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Skehan| first = Craig| title = Gun in one hand, Bible in the other| publisher = [[The Age]]| date = 2003-07-26| url = http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/07/25/1059084208417.html| accessdate = 2007-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; but left the faith to become a petty criminal in [[Papua New Guinea]].  After a number of years, he returned home, where he took work as a police officer,&lt;ref name="profile"&gt;{{cite web| title = Profile: Harold Keke| publisher = [[BBC News]]| date = 2005-03-18| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3090297.stm| accessdate = 2007-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and embraced [[evangelical Christianity]].&lt;ref name="trans"/&gt;

During the 1990s, tensions flared up between indigenous inhabitants of [[Guadalcanal]] and immigrants from neighboring [[Malaita]].  Following the election of [[Bartholomew Ulufa'alu]], militants, including those led by a newly radicalized Keke, began a campaign of intimidation and violence against Malaitan settlers.  This, including Keke's 1998 raid of a police armory, led to the formation of the [[Malaita Eagle Force]] (MEF) and all out ethnic warfare in the islands.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Keke views himself as a prophet, leading his people to their "promised land".  He also claims that he had political backing for the start of the conflict from then-premier [[Ezekiel Alebua]] &amp;mdash; who provided money, weapons, and ammunition for the GRA.  This claim has been denied by Alebua, who calls Keke "little more than a violent thug".&lt;ref name="trans"/&gt;

During the ensuing conflict, the MEF gained the upper hand, deposing the government and gaining control of most police forces; making them a ''de facto'' extension of the militias.  Many of the militias opposed to the MEF struck a peace deal in late 2000, but Keke refused to sign, moving his soldiers into the jungles of the Weather Coast to avoid capture.&lt;ref name="trans"/&gt;

The GRA, under Keke's leadership, has been accused of a variety of crimes, including arson, kidnapping, assassination, and murder.  Keke has been personally implicated in more than 50 murders,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Solomons warlord Keke in custody of Australians| publisher = [[Associated Press]]| date = 2003-08-14| url = http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2003/08/14/2003063687| accessdate = 2007-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; including that of cabinet minister and priest [[Augustine Geve]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Cabinet minister shot dead| publisher = [[One News (New Zealand)|ONE News]]| date = 2002-08-24| url = http://tvnz.co.nz/view/news_world_story_skin/126475| accessdate = 2007-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as seven [[missionaries]] from the [[Melanesian Brotherhood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|publisher=Anglican Communion News Service
|accessdate=2008-05-11
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2003, following the arrival of a multi-national intervention force led by [[Australia]], Keke called for a cease-fire, and surrendered to peace-keepers.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web| title = Solomons warlord surrenders| publisher = [[BBC News]]| date = 2003-08-13| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/3146413.stm | accessdate = 2007-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, he was convicted of the murder of Geve, and sentenced to [[life sentence|life in prison]].

'''Hugo Makibi Enomiya-Lassalle''' (11 November 1898&lt;ref name="newday"&gt;{{cite book|last=Akinade|first=Akintunde E.|title=A New Day: Essays on World Christianity in Honor of Lamin Sanneh|publisher=Peter Lang|year=2010|page=242|ISBN=9781433104565}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Gut Externbrock near [[Nieheim]], [[Province of Westphalia|Westphalia]] – 7 July 1990&lt;ref name="newday"/&gt; in [[Münster]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia|Westphalia]]) was a German [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priest and one of the foremost teachers to embrace both Roman Catholic [[Christianity]] and [[Zen]] [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref name="newday"/&gt;

==Biography==

Enomiya-Lassalle joined the [[Society of Jesus]] on 25 April 1919. At the end of the usual Jesuit spiritual and academic training he was ordained [[Catholic priest|priest]] on 28 August 1927.

He travelled to Japan as a [[Catholic missionary|missionary]] in 1929 and became interested in that country's [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] practices.  In 1940, he became the vicar of [[Hiroshima]], and on 6 August 1945 he was critically wounded by the nuclear blast in that city, which is depicted in [[John Hersey]]'s book ''[[hiroshima (book)|Hiroshima]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Hersey]]: ''Hiroshima''; [[Vintage Books]], New York 1989, p 11 etc&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, he returned to Germany.

In September 1946, he had an audience with [[Pope]] [[Pius XII]], in which he revealed his plan to build in Hiroshima a [[cathedral]] dedicated to the idea of world peace. Designed by Japanese architect [[Togo Murano]], construction on the cathedral began in 1950 and on 6 August 1954, the [[Assumption of Mary Cathedral, Hiroshima|Memorial Cathedral for World Peace]]（[[:ja:世界平和記念聖堂|ja]]）was dedicated.&lt;ref&gt;http://cpap.hiroshima-diocese.net/?page_id=3543&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, Enomiya-Lassalle began studying Zen with [[Harada Daiun Sogaku]].&lt;ref name="newday"/&gt;&lt;ref name="journeys"&gt;{{cite book|last=Oldmeadow|first=Harry|title=Journeys East: 20th Century Western Encounters with Eastern Religious Traditions|publisher=World Wisdom, Inc|year=2004|pages=429–430|ISBN=9780941532570}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1958, he published ''Zen: A Way to Enlightenment''.&lt;ref name="journeys"/&gt;

Following Harada's death in 1961, Enomiya-Lassalle became an apprentice of one of Harada's students, [[Yamada Koun]].  Yamada was enthusiastic about the possibilities of Zen as a Christian practice, believing that "''Zen would become an important stream in the Catholic Church one day''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://terebess.hu/english/sharf.html Terebess Asia Online]&lt;/ref&gt;  With Enomiya-Lassalle's active assistance, he attracted a number of Catholic priests and nuns as students.  In the late 1960s, Enomiya-Lasalle was certified as a teacher in Yamada's [[Sanbo Kyodan]] sect and given the title ''[[Rōshi|roshi]]'' ([[Zen master]]), while professing his continued belief in Christianity.  After 1968, Enomiya-Lassalle spent much of his time in Europe leading Zen retreats and encouraging Zen practice among Christians.  His books influenced symphony conductor [[Herbert von Karajan]] to study Zen and incorporate a Zen mindset into his conducting.

'''Jean-Antoine Houdon''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒɑ̃n‿ɑ̃twan udɔ̃}}) (25 March 1741 – 15 July 1828) was a French neoclassical sculptor.

Houdon is famous for his portrait busts and statues of philosophers, inventors and political figures of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. Houdon's subjects included [[Denis Diderot]] (1771), [[Benjamin Franklin]] (1778-09), [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] (1778), [[Voltaire]] (1781), [[Molière]] (1781), [[George Washington (Houdon)|George Washington]] (1785–88), [[Thomas Jefferson]] (1789), [[Louis XVI]] (1790), [[Robert Fulton]], (1803–04), and [[Napoléon Bonaparte]] (1806).

==Biography==
[[File:Paris art deco boilly houdon.jpg|thumb|''Jean-Antoine Houdon at work in his atelier'', 1804, by [[Louis-Léopold Boilly]], [[Musée des Arts Décoratifs, Paris|Musée des Arts Décoratifs]], Paris.]]

He was born in [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]], on 25 March 1741.
In 1752, he entered the [[Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture]], where he studied with [[René-Michel Slodtz]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne]], and [[Jean-Baptiste Pigalle]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} From 1761 to 1764, he studied at the [[École royale des élèves protégés]].{{sfn|Murray|2004}}

Houdon won the [[Prix de Rome]] in 1761, but was not greatly influenced by ancient and Renaissance art in Rome. His stay in the city is marked by two characteristic and important productions: the superb [[écorché]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artcyclopedia.com/feature-2003-06-Houdon-Ecorche.html|title=Jean-Antoine Houdon: l'Ecorche (Flayed Man)|website=''artcyclopedia.com''}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1767), an anatomical model which has served as a guide to all artists since his day, and the statue of [[Bruno of Cologne|Saint Bruno]] in the church of [[Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri]] in Rome. 
After ten years stay in [[Italian Peninsula|Italy]], Houdon returned to Paris.

He submitted "Morpheus" to the Salon of 1771.{{sfn|Herbermann|1913}} He developed his practise of portrait busts.
He became a member of the [[Académie de peinture et de sculpture]] in 1771, and a professor in 1778. In 1778, he modeled [[Voltaire]], producing a portrait bust with wig for the [[Comédie-Française]]; one for the [[Palace of Versailles]], and one for [[Catherine the Great]].{{sfn|Hart|Biddle|1911|p= 36}}

In 1778, he joined the masonic lodge [[Les Neuf Sœurs]], where he later met [[Benjamin Franklin]], and [[John Paul Jones]].{{sfn|Marshall|Kaufman|Johnston|2005}}
For Salon of 1781, he submitted a "Diana" which was refused without drapery.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Houdon's portrait sculpture of Washington was the result of a specific invitation by Benjamin Franklin to cross the Atlantic in 1785, specifically to visit [[Mount Vernon (plantation)|Mount Vernon]], so that Washington could model for him. Washington sat for wet clay life models and a plaster life mask. 
These models served for many commissions of Washington, including the [[George Washington (Houdon)|standing figure]] commissioned by the [[Virginia General Assembly]], for the [[Virginia State Capitol]] in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} 
Numerous variations of the Washington bust were produced, portraying him variously as a general in uniform, in the classical manner showing chest musculature, and as Roman Consul [[Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus]] clad in a toga. A cast of the latter is located in the [[Vermont State House]].

In the 1780s Houdon produced two semi-nude sculptures, [[Winter (sculpture)|''Winter'']] and [[Bather (sculpture)|''Bather'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/jahd/hd_jahd.htm|title=Jean Antoine Houdon (1741–1828)|website=metmuseum.org|access-date=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Perceived as bourgeois for his connections to the court of Louis XVI, he fell out of favour during the [[French Revolution]], although he escaped imprisonment. 
Houdon returned to favor during the [[French Consulate]] and [[First French Empire|Empire]], being taken on as one of the original artistic team for what became the [[Column of the Grande Armée]] at Wimille.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
He was made a Chevalier de la [[Légion d'honneur]], on 17 December 1804.{{sfn|Hart|Biddle|1911|p= 264}}

Houdon died in Paris on 15 July 1828,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} and was interred at the [[Cimetière du Montparnasse]].

==Family==
On 1 July 1786, he married Marie-Ange-Cecile Langlois;{{sfn|Hart|Biddle|1911|p=274}} they had three daughters: Sabine, Anne-Ange, and Claudine.{{sfn|Hart|Biddle|1911|p=256}}

Houdon's sculptures were used as models for the engravings used on [[Presidents of the United States on U.S. postage stamps#1880s|various U.S. postage stamps]] of the late 19th and early 20th centuries which depict Washington in profile.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arago.si.edu/index.asp?con=1&amp;cmd=1&amp;tid=2032672 Smithsonian National Postal Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Madeleine ffrench-Mullen''' (30 December 1880 – 26 May 1944) was an Irish revolutionary and labour activist who took part in the [[Easter Rising]] in Dublin in 1916.

ffrench-Mullen was a member of the radical nationalist women's organisation {{lang|ga|[[Inghinidhe na hÉireann]]}}. In 1913 during the [[Dublin Lock-out]], she worked in the soup kitchen in [[Liberty Hall]]. She subsequently joined the [[Irish Citizen Army]] (ICA).&lt;ref name=Bryan&gt;Deirdre Bryan, "Mullen, Madeleine ffrench-", ''Dictionary of Irish Biography''.&lt;!--publisher; year of publication; ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the Easter Rising she worked in a first aid tent. She was arrested following the Rising but released the following month.&lt;ref name=Bryan /&gt; She joined [[Sinn Féin]] and was elected to Rathmines District Council in 1920.&lt;ref name=Bryan /&gt;

== Early life ==
Madeleine ffrench-Mullen was born on 30 December 1880 in Malta, where her father, St Lawrence ffrench-Mullen, a Royal Navy surgeon, was stationed. She had two brothers, St Lawrence Patrick Joseph (1890–1891) and Douglas (1893–1943).&lt;ref name=Bryan /&gt;&lt;ref name=Luddy&gt;{{cite web|last1=Luddy|first1=Maria|title=Madeleine ffrench mullen|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/58635|website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=29 October 2015|ref=Luddy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Women Rights and the Suffrage Movement ==
ffrench-Mullen's interest in politics started young, Her father was a committed Parnellite and their Dundrum home was a campaign headquarters. She was a radical feminist and republican during her life. Like many other of the time she regarded it as a woman's right to vote. She joined the [[Women's suffrage|suffrage]] movement, and met women with a similar worldview and values. The women's suffrage movement was included in the Movements of Extremists reports of the [[Dublin Metropolitan Police]].&lt;ref name="DMP reports"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chief Secretary's Office, Crime Branch: Dublin Metropolitan Police (DMP) Movement of Extremists 29 May 1915 – 20 April 1916|url=http://www.nationalarchives.ie/digital-resources/chief-secretarys-office-crime-branch-dublin-metropolitan-police-dmp-movement-of-extremists-29-may-1915-20-april-1916/dmp-reports-june-1915/|website=National Archives of Ireland|accessdate=20 November 2015|pages=7, 14 June, 4 October 1915}}&lt;/ref&gt; ffrench-Mullen went on to join [[Inghinidhe na hÉireann]], a radical nationalist women's group founded by [[Maud Gonne]] in 1900. The organisation developed into [[Cumann na mBan]] in 1913. Suffragist values were central to [[Cumann na mBan]]'s goal of standing side-by-side with men in the fight for the Irish Republic. Some members saw this as women regaining the rights that had belonged to them in pre-invasion Gaelic civilisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Guerrilla Warfare in the Irish War of Independence, 1919–1921|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=BxLb0aZOFOMC|publisher = McFarland|date = 17 February 2011|isbn = 978-0-7864-8519-2|first = Joseph|last = McKenna}}&lt;/ref&gt; ffrench-Mullen was on the socialist wing of the moment, holding to the ideals of universal social equality of the syndicalist [[James Connolly]] and the [[Irish Citizen Army]].

The Irish Times (1874–1920) Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/516996400&lt;/ref&gt; The hospital focused on children's health and wellbeing, an area that was perceived at the time as women's concern. In the aftermath of [[World War I|WW1]] many health problems had arisen including a rise in venereal diseases such as [[syphilis]], carried from soldiers returning home from war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Syphilis and the state|last = Kirkpatrick|first = Thomas Percy C.|date = June 1918|journal = The Dublin journal of medical science|volume =  CXLV|pages = 339–357}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Ireland's infants of the time suffered from [[congenital syphilis]] (inherited disease from mother at birth) this was a driving factor in the opening of St Ultan's hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Renegades: Irish Republican Women 1900–1922|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pzYkTYi3JRgC|publisher = Mercier Press Ltd|date = 1 January 2010|isbn = 978-1-85635-684-8|first = Ann|last = Matthews|page = 213}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tuberculosis]] was endemic in Ireland during its time as a British colony. Against steadfast opposition by the State and the Catholic Church, Lynn and ffrench Mullen established a vaccination project, vaccinating thousands of impoverished children who would certainly have succumbed to TB without their vaccines. Their success led to the foundation of Ireland's [[BCG vaccine|BCG]] programme, which has vaccinated all babies since the 1950s.

The [[Magellan probe|Magellan]] project was set up so that the initial images and data from the Magellan probe were only for use and study by a team of [[Magellan Principal Investigators|principal investigators]] from a variety of universities and institutions, and by the [[Magellan Project Science Team]].  These scientists were responsible for validating the data, contributing input for spacecraft acquisition of data, and interpreting the data results for their release to the public. Data were shared with three visiting Soviet scientists ([[Alexander Basilevsky]], Effaim Akim and Alexander Zacharov), a first, and sensitive issue, for NASA at the time considering the [[Cold War]] was just coming to a close.  

The Magellan Project Science room became notorious for its hanging of long thermal print strips of image data (FBIDRs) along the walls of a spacious room. This was the first form in which the imagery of the surface of Venus was seen due to the long, narrow swathes acquired by the spacecraft.  Significant guests during the mission's operation included [[Margaret Thatcher]].

After the initial investigation stage Magellan's full data set was released for public consumption.

===Wine===

In 2011, Goldin Group bought the 40-acre [[SLOAN ESTATE]] winery in the [[Napa Valley]] from Stuart Sloan, planted to Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc.  The estate produces the flagship SLOAN and second label ASTERISK.  The SLOAN 2002 and 2007 vintages were awarded 100 points by renowned wine critic Robert Parker.

On 30 May 2013, the Group purchased three more châteaux in [[Bordeaux]], [[France]], namely Château Le Bon Pasteur in Pomerol, Château Rolland-Maillet in Saint-Émilion and Château Bertineau St-Vincent in Lalande-de-Pomerol.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2013/05/le-bon-pasteur-sold-to-asian-investor/ the drinks business: Le Bon Pasteur Sold to Asian Investor]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Château Le Bon Pasteur]] is a [[Pomerol AOC]] [[Bordeaux wine]] from world-renowned consulting oenologist [[Michel Rolland]].

'''Paul S. Berry''' is a [[physician]], researcher in [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]], producer, director, editor, [[entertainer]], and author. He currently works as a [[nocturnist]] in a federally designated physician shortage area&lt;ref name="Multiple1"&gt;"O'Neill, Michael. "List of Hospitals in Health Professional Shortage Area."

== Biography ==
Born in the late 50s, Berry’s turbulent childhood sent him to multiple foster homes, a county home for boys and dropping out of high school at age 17. Ultimately, he returned to academics in the early 1980s. It was during the early 80’s and his initial years in college while DJ’ing at a nightclub in West Hollywood California called [[Studio One (nightclub)|Studio One]], that Berry noticed various acquaintances and “party-goers,” who would suddenly become ill and die from what would later come to be known as acquired immune deficiency syndrome. He believed that sexual transmission was implicated in what was then called [[Gay-related immune deficiency|GRID]] (Gay-related immune disorder).&lt;ref name="Multiple5"&gt;Berry, Paul S. "Pre Med Advice: Medicine is not about money, not a job - It's a calling." Butte College Pre Med Advice. Butte College, Oroville. 19 July 2017. http://doctorberry.com&lt;/ref&gt; He abandoned the party disco atmosphere of the early 80s to focus on academics and pursue a career in medicine.&lt;ref name="Multiple6"&gt;"Berry, Paul S., (doctorberry).

Library of Congress Control number: 2011944940.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul S. Berry attended undergrad at the [[University of California, Los Angeles|University of California, Los Angeles, California]]. He graduated in July 1986 with a Bachelor of Science degree in science and psychobiology.''' '''Berry then attended''' '''[[George Washington University]] Medical School, obtaining his Doctor of Medicine degree in May 1990. He returned to Los Angeles for residency training in internal medicine in 1990.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The AIDS epidemic escalated, and Berry joined Search Alliance, an AIDS research group headed by Dr. Paul Rothman. After Rothman succumbed to AIDS, Berry assumed the position of medical director of Search Alliance (later becoming known as [[AIDS Research Alliance]]).&lt;ref name="Multiple7"&gt;"AIDS Research Alliance.” Wikipedia.

Through the 1990s, HIV/AIDS rapidly became a manageable long term disease in non-third world industrialized nations, and Berry pursued other endeavors. Berry earned a Master of Business Administration from the [[University of California, Irvine|University of California Irvine]] and a Juris Doctorate from [[Boalt Hall]] at the University of California at Berkeley.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

His most recognized brands are [[Roshen]], the large-scale confectionery company which has earned him the nickname of 'Chocolate King',&lt;ref name="BBC Profile Poroshenko"/&gt; and the TV channel ''[[5 kanal]]'', an all-news national TV broadcaster. Due to the scale of his business holdings in the manufacturing, agriculture and financial sectors, his political influence that included several stints at government prior to his presidency, and ownership of an influential mass-media outlet, Poroshenko has long been considered one of the prominent Ukrainian oligarchs even though not the most influential among them.

He was [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2014|elected president on 25 May 2014]], capturing more than 54% of the vote in the first round, thereby winning outright and avoiding a run-off.

==Early life and education==
Poroshenko was born in the city of [[Bolhrad]], in [[Odessa Oblast]], on 26 September 1965 to Oleksij Ivanovich Poroshenko and Evgenia Sergeevna (née Grigorchuk).&lt;ref name="The Richest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.therichest.com/celebnetworth/celebrity-business/men/petro-poroshenko-net-worth/ |title=Petro Poroshenko Net Worth |work=The Richest |accessdate=26 May 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130822061718/http://www.therichest.com/celebnetworth/celebrity-business/men/petro-poroshenko-net-worth/ |archivedate=22 August 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scotsman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/mobile/news/world/kerry-heads-for-crisis-talks-over-ukraine-1-3358208 |title=Kerry heads for crisis talks over Ukraine |work=[[The Scotsman]] |date=29 March 2014 |accessdate=26 May 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527174812/http://www.scotsman.com/mobile/news/world/kerry-heads-for-crisis-talks-over-ukraine-1-3358208 |archivedate=27 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, {{Interlanguage link|Oleksij Poroshenko|de|Oleksij Poroschenko|uk|Порошенко Олексій Іванович|ru|Порошенко, Алексей Иванович|WD=}}, was an engineer and later government official who managed several factories during the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet rule in Ukraine]].

==Business career==
In 1993, Poroshenko, together with his father Oleksiy and colleagues from the Road Traffic Institute in Kiev, created the UkrPromInvest Ukrainian Industry and Investment Company, which specialized in the confectionery and automotive industries (as well as in other agricultural processing later on.)&lt;ref name="Poroshenko family"/&gt; Poroshenko was director-general of the company from its founding until 1998, when in connection with his entry into parliament he handed the title over to his father, while retaining the title of honorary president.&lt;ref name="Poroshenko family"/&gt;

Between 1996 and 1998, UkrPromInvest acquired control over several state-owned confectionery enterprises which were combined into the [[Roshen]] group in 1996, creating the largest confectionery manufacturing operation in [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref name="Poroshenko family"/&gt; His business success in this industry earned him the nickname "Chocolate King".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Abram Brown |date=31 March 2014 |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2014/03/31/the-willy-wonka-of-ukraine-is-now-the-leading-presidential-candidate/ |title=The Willy Wonka of Ukraine Is Now The Leading Presidential Candidate |journal=[[Forbes]] |accessdate=19 April 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201194141/http://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2014/03/31/the-willy-wonka-of-ukraine-is-now-the-leading-presidential-candidate/ |archivedate=1 December 2008 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Poroshenko's business empire also includes several car and bus factories, [[Kuznya na Rybalskomu]] shipyard, the [[5 Kanal (Ukraine)|5 Kanal]] television channel,&lt;ref name=poro5&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/67473/ |title=Poroshenko is not going to sell Channel 5 TV |work=Kyiv Post |date=23 May 2010 |accessdate=25 May 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525042142/http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/67473/ |archivedate=25 May 2010 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as other businesses in Ukraine.

Although not the most prominent in the list of his business holdings, the assets that drew much recent media attention, and often controversy, are the confectionery factory in [[Lipetsk]], Russia, that became controversial due to the [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014–present)]], the [[Sevastopol Marine Plant]] (Sevmorzavod) that has been confiscated after the [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|2014 Russian forcible annexation of Crimea]] and the media outlet [[5 kanal]], particularly because of Poroshenko's repeated refusal to sell an influential media asset following his accession to presidency.

According to Poroshenko (and [[N M Rothschild &amp; Sons|Rothschild Wealth Management &amp; Trust]]) since becoming President of Ukraine he has relinquished the management of his businesses, ultimately (in January 2016) to a [[blind trust]].&lt;ref name=KPp71016/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pbt20117b"&gt;[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/economic/397675.html Roshen quits activity of its factory in Lipetsk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170120130300/http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/economic/397675.html |date=20 January 2017 }}, [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (20 January 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Billionaires lists rankings===

The estimate of his assets was set at $979 million USD, a 20% growth, and his ranking increased from 9th to 6th wealthiest person in Ukraine. The article noted that Poroshenko remained one of the only two European leaders who owned a business empire of such scale, with [[Silvio Berlusconi]] of Italy being the other.

A total of €450 million is kept in an Amsterdam-based company registered in Cyprus, as a result of which his effective tax rate is 5% rather than the statutory tax rate of 18% in Ukraine. The company is likely to be worth much more, as the annual accounts published by the Dutch Chamber of Commerce only contain the book value of the shares, which is very likely to be lower than the market value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Alle schimmige geldstromen belastingontwijkende President Oekraïne in één handig overzicht|url=http://925.nl/archief/2016/11/24/handig-alle-schimmige-geldstromen-belastingontwijkende-president-oekraine-in-een-overzicht/|date=24 November 2016|accessdate=9 July 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170415135655/http://925.nl/archief/2016/11/24/handig-alle-schimmige-geldstromen-belastingontwijkende-president-oekraine-in-een-overzicht/|archivedate=15 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mirror Weekly]]. 30 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and at the Kiev city mayor election – [[Vitaliy Klychko]].&lt;ref name=fwgpaap/&gt;

===Mikheil Saakashvili===
On 29 May 2015 [[President of Ukraine]] Petro Poroshenko granted a Ukrainian citizenship to former [[President of Georgia]] [[Mikheil Saakashvili]] almost 10 months after a Tbilisi city court approved the request of the General Prosecutor of Georgia's office and elected a pre-trial detention for Saakashvili in absentia as preventative measure.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.rambler.ru/caucasus/26237159-sud-tbilisi-zaochno-arestoval-eks-prezidenta-gruzii-saakashvili/ Mass media: Tbilisi court arrested the former president of Georgia Saakshvili in absentia (СМИ: суд Тбилиси заочно арестовал экс-президента Грузии Саакашвили )].

Newsru. 2 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for granting the citizenship was acknowledging that it "poses a state interest of Ukraine".&lt;ref&gt;Poroshenko, P. [https://web.archive.org/web/20150602040433/http://www.president.gov.ua/documents/19531.html "About granting a Ukrainian citizenship to Saakashvili M. as a person granting whom the citizenship of Ukraine poses a state interest for Ukraine (Про прийняття до громадянства України Саакашвілі М. як особи, прийняття якої до громадянства України становить державний інтерес для України)"]. Presidential ukase № 301/2015. 29 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2015 the General Prosecutor of Georgia's office had appealed to the [[General Prosecutor of Ukraine]] office for extradition of Saakashvili.  The [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Georgia]] had also recalled the [[Ukraine Ambassador to Georgia]], in relation to Saakashvili's appointment as a chairman of Consultative International Council of Reforms.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2015/02/17/7058884/ Ukraine has denied Georgia extradition of Saakashvili (Україна відмовила Грузії в екстрадиції Саакашвілі)]. [[Ukrayinska Pravda]]. 17 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Later during his visit to Georgia in 2017, President Poroshenko at his briefing in Tbilisi stated that Ukraine has never received any requests for extradition of Saakashvili, while Minister of Justice of Georgia [[Tea Tsulukiani]] countered it with the announcement that there were actually two official requests.&lt;ref&gt;[https://hromadske.ua/posts/hruziia-dvichi-zvertalas-do-ukrainy-shchodo-ekstradytsii-saakashvili Georgia has asked Ukraine twice to give away Saakashvili – Ministry of Justice of Georgia (Грузія двічі просила Україну видати Саакашвілі — Мінюст Грузії)].

===New year vacationing (2018)===
In January 2018 journalists from [[Radio Free Europe]] reported that during Poroshenko's New Year's vacation starting 1 January 2018 on the [[Maldives]] there were 10 people who spent $500 000, rented separate islands and the most expensive hotel in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/news-schemes/28983638.html|title=Mr. Petro Incognito.

'''Rae Spoon''' is a [[Canadian]] musician and writer. Their musical style has varied from [[country music|country]] to electronic-influenced [[indie rock]] and [[folk punk]].&lt;ref name=longview&gt;[http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid1=126&amp;csid2=4&amp;fid1=33965 Rae Spoon's Long View]. ''[[Exclaim!]]'', October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

Spoon grew up as a [[transgender]] person in [[Calgary]], Alberta. They were raised in a Pentecostal household to a paranoid-schizophrenic father. Their father's religious beliefs caused anxiety to a teenage Rae. Spoon now lives in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], British Columbia.

After a decade of living as a [[trans man]],&lt;ref name="see"&gt;{{citation |title=He said/she said? |accessdate=2007-09-22 |url=http://www.seemagazine.com/Issues/2003/0508/mus1.htm |date=2003-05-08 |periodical=[[SEE Magazine]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022043241/http://seemagazine.com/Issues/2003/0508/mus1.htm |archivedate=2007-10-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spoon noted a preference for the pronoun "they" in 2012 during an interview with cartoonist [[Elisha Lim]], a fellow advocate for the [[gender-neutral pronoun]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nomorepotlucks.org/site/elisha-lim-and-rae-spoon-talking-shop "Elisha Lim and Rae Spoon: Talking Shop"]. ''No More Potlucks'', January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; They explained to ''[[Now (newspaper)|Now Magazine]]'', "after years of fighting to be called 'he,' the idea of coming out again made me tired. But now I feel kind of rejuvenated, ready to fight on some more. I think the 'they' pronoun is a pretty cool thing. It's letting a lot of people not have to identify as a man or a woman. Whatever it means to them."&lt;ref name="nowtoronto.com"&gt;[http://www.nowtoronto.com/music/story.cfm?content=184903 "Rae Spoon: Powerful album reignites the pronoun debate"].

==Career==
{{Quote box
 |quote  = How do you become a transgender country singer? For some, it's easier to be transgender from the start,and then work towards becoming a singer. For others it is better to play music first, and then come out as transgender. About ten years ago, I managed to do both in the space of a few months.

Spoon started performing before they started recording.

Their early music features country imagery to the sound of acoustic string instruments such as [[banjo]], [[guitar]] and [[mandolin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McPherson|first1=David|title=Your Trailer Door|url=http://exclaim.ca/Music/article/rae_spoon-your_trailer_door|website=exclaim|publisher=Ian Danzig|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spoon's breakthrough album, 2008's ''Superioryouareinferior'', was recorded in [[Calgary]] and introduced some [[electronic music]] elements into Spoon's style.&lt;ref name=longview /&gt; ''Superioryouareinferior'' includes themes previously used by Spoon like [[Canadian history]] and [[Canadian culture|culture]] such as the commentary on [[colonialism]] in their song "Come On Forest Fire Burn The Disco Down".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ash|first1=Amanda|title=Superioryouareinferior|url=http://exclaim.ca/Music/article/rae_spoon-superioryouareinferior|website=Exclaim!|publisher=Ian Danzig|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Superioryouareinferior'' was a longlisted nominee for the [[2009 Polaris Music Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid1=147&amp;csid2=4&amp;fid1=49036 "Pop goes Rae Spoon"].

==Background==
[[File:Myer_Salaman_bust.jpg|thumb|Bust of Salaman's mother Sarah]]
Salaman was born in [[Kensington, London|Kensington]], [[London]] and was the ninth of fifteen children born to his parents Sarah Solomon and Myer Salaman who was a wealthy merchant who traded in ostrich feathers at the height of the [[Plume hunting|plume trade]].&lt;ref name="Karl Popper and the Two New Secrets of Life"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Palladino"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/35911|title=Salaman, Redcliffe Nathan (1874–1955), geneticist and Jewish activist|author=Paolo Palladino|work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Salaman family are [[Ashkenazi Jews]],&lt;ref name="theguardian"&gt;{{cite news |last=Morrison|first=Blake|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/oct/11/featuresreviews.guardianreview2|title=Generation gap|work= |location= |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=11 October 2013|accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; who according to Salaman, migrated to Britain from either [[Holland]] or the [[Rhineland]] in the early 18th century.&lt;ref name="Plumes"&gt;{{cite book |last=Stein|first=Sarah Abrevaya|title=Plumes: Ostrich Feathers, Jews, and a Lost World of Global Commerce|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ikHj7Xc9lJUC&amp;pg=PA180&amp;lpg=PA180|year=2010|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|page=180|isbn=978-0300168181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Salaman was educated at [[St Paul's School, London]] initially studying [[classics]] but due to the dull teaching methods he switched to studying science and later became head boy of the Science Side of the school. He obtained a scholarship at [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]] in 1893 and graduated with a first class degree in Natural Sciences in 1896 having studied physiology, zoology and chemistry. He was tutored and advised by the physiologist [[W. H. Gaskell]] who later became a good friend of Salaman. He moved to the [[London Hospital]] in 1896 to study medicine and remained there until he qualified in 1900.&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt;

==Research==
In 1903, Salaman was appointed Director of the Pathological Institute at the London Hospital but in 1904 he developed [[tuberculosis]] and had to stop practising medicine and spend six months in a Swiss [[sanitorium]].&lt;ref name="Palladino"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reader2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Reader|title=The Untold History of the Potato|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LAM4s6arkhsC|year=2009|publisher=Vintage|isbn=978-0-09-947479-1|pages=221–225}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took him over two years to fully recover from the illness, changing the course of his entire life. He purchased a house in [[Barley, Hertfordshire]] and because he could not return to practising medicine began experimenting in the emerging science of [[genetics]] under the guidance of his friend [[William Bateson]].&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reader2009"/&gt; After several failed experiments with a range of animals, Salaman decided to experiment with potatoes after seeking advice from his gardener. Later in his career, commenting on his decision to study potatoes Salaman noted that he had "embarked on an enterprise which, after forty years, leaves more questions unsolved than were thought at that time to exist. Whether it was mere luck, or whether the potato and I were destined for life partnership, I do not know, but from that moment my course was set, and I became ever more involved in problems associated directly or indirectly with a plant with which I had no particular affinity, gustatory or romantic".&lt;ref name="Reader2009"/&gt;

Working in his private garden, he initially set out to cross two potato varieties and establish which traits were [[dominance (genetics)|dominant]] and [[recessive (genetics)|recessive]] in a similar manner to [[Gregor Mendel]]'s work on peas, but he soon broadened into other areas. In 1908, he decided to include wild potatoes in his experiments and requested that [[Kew Gardens]] provide him with ''[[Solanum maglia]]''. Kew's stocks had been incorrectly labelled however and Salaman was sent ''[[Solanum edinense]]'' instead. In 1909, Salaman grew 40 self-fertilised crosses of ''S. edinense'' and found that seven of them did not succumb to [[late blight]] (''Phytophthora infestans''). Convinced that resistance to late blight existed in wild species he began to study other species and found that ''[[Solanum demissum]]'' was also resistant to blight. Salaman started to cross ''S. demissum'' with domesticated varieties of potato in 1911 to produce high yielding lines that were also resistant to late blight. By 1914, he had successfully created hybrids and in 1926 he remarked that he had produced varieties with "reasonably good economic characteristics which, no matter what their maturity, appeared to be immune to late blight.&lt;ref name="Reader2009"/&gt; Salaman was the first to identify genetic resistance to late blight and ''S. demissum'' was still used as a source of resistance in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; In ''[[The Propitious Esculent]]'', John Reader called Salaman's discovery "an important breakthrough, offering real promise ... that it was possible to breed blight-resistant potato varieties".&lt;ref name="Reader2009"/&gt; In 1987, it was thought that half of the potato varieties cultivated in Europe contained genes from ''S. demissum''.&lt;ref name="nee"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/2806972| jstor = 2806972| title = The History and Social Influence of the Potato| journal = Brittonia| volume = 39| pages = 48| year = 1987| last1 = Nee | first1 = M. | last2 = Salaman | first2 = R.

In 1910, he published a paper the inheritance of colour in potato in the first issue of the ''[[Journal of Genetics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF02981567| title = The inheritance of colour and other characters in the potato| journal = Journal of Genetics| volume = 1| pages = 7| year = 1910| last1 = Salaman | first1 = R.

N. }}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote the book ''Potato Varieties'' in 1929.&lt;ref name="Karl Popper and the Two New Secrets of Life"/&gt;

His research on potatoes was disrupted by the outbreak of the [[First World War]] during which Salaman joined the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] and served in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. Afterwards he was appointed chairman of the potato synonym committee at the [[National Institute of Agricultural Botany]] where he was tasked with describing potato varieties and putting an end to the common practice of marketing old and unreliable varieties under new names. His work there culminated in the publication of ''Potato Varieties'' in 1926. The same year he persuaded the [[Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Agriculture]] to establish the Potato Virus Research Institute in Cambridge of which he remained a director until 1939.&lt;ref name=Palladino/&gt; [[Kenneth Manley Smith]] was an entomologist at the institute and [[:de:Frederick Bawden|Frederick Charles Bawden]] became Salaman's assistant in 1930. Smith and Bawden went on to become renowned plant virologists.&lt;ref name="Ainsworth1981"&gt;{{cite book|author=Geoffrey Clough Ainsworth|title=Introduction to the History of Plant Pathology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j-s8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA83|year=1981|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-23032-2|pages=84–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; In conjunction with [[Paul A. Murphy]] of [[Dublin]] a large stock of virus-free potatoes was built up and multiplied in greenhouses, a practice which continued after his death and was adopted in other countries.&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt; His research on viruses lead to him being elected to the [[Royal Society]] in 1935.&lt;ref name="Palladino"/&gt;

Salaman supervised the PhD thesis of [[Jack Hawkes (botanist)|Jack Hawkes]], who went on to become an authority in the taxonomy of wild potato species and identified sources of resistance to [[potato cyst nematode]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s10722-005-8253-3|author=Richard N.

==Views==
Salaman combined active [[Zionism]] with research into the genetics and social history of the potato, which led him to an interest in eugenics and racial explanations for Arab "failure". In 1919, he was uncomfortably conscious that clearing [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] of Arabs would be "simply ridiculous and comparable to [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]]'s effort in Ireland", and the chief moral he drew from [[the Holocaust]] was the peril of attributing misfortune to racial characteristics rather than political oppression.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news |last=FitzHerbert|first=Claudia|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3604881/Plundering-the-past-with-the-verve-of-an-angry-child.html|title=Plundering the past with the verve of an angry child|work= |location= |publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''|date=21 October 2003|accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nina Salaman continued to pursue her interest in medieval Hebrew poetry. Despite Barley's distance from London, she maintained a kosher home and [[Sabbath]] observance. For the festivals, the family traveled to London, where they stayed with one of Redcliffe's siblings and worshipped at the [[New West End Synagogue]]. She took personal responsibility for the Hebrew education of her children until they left for boarding school.&lt;ref name="jwa"/&gt;

'''S'gaw''' (စှီၤ/ကညီကျိာ်), '''Sgaw Karen''' or '''Sgaw Kayin''', commonly known as '''Karen''' is a language spoken chiefly by the Sgaw Karen people in [[Myanmar]] and [[Thailand]]. A [[Karenic language|Karenic branch]] of the [[Sino-Tibetan language family]], Sgaw Karen is spoken by over four million people in [[Tanintharyi Region]], [[Ayeyarwady Region]], [[Yangon Region]], and [[Bago Region]] in Myanmar, and about 200,000 in northern and western Thailand along the border near Kayin State. It is written using the [[S'gaw Karen alphabet]], derived from the [[Burmese script]] although a Latin-based script is also in use among the Sgaw Karen in northwestern Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pakakoenyo.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=4&amp;Itemid=8&lt;/ref&gt;

Various divergent dialects are sometimes seen as separate languages: Paku in the northeast, Mopwa (Mobwa) in the northwest, Wewew, and Monnepwa.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Beckwith, International Association for Tibetan Studies, 2002. ''Medieval Tibeto-Burman languages'', p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Sgaw language has been used as the official language in the [[Karen National Union]] (KNU) organization who have [[The Karen Conflict|waged a war]] against the Burmese government since early 1949. A Bible translation was published in 1853.

==Dialects==
The Sgaw Karen language has at least 3 dialects. They are [[mutually intelligible]] to each other however there may be words that sound unfamiliar to one another.
*'''Northern dialect''' - also known as southern dialect of [[Kayah State]] is the Sgaw dialect that does not have the '''th''' sound in there language or dialect. They replace the southern and eastern dialects '''th''' with '''s'''. For example: while the southern and eastern would say ''moe tha boe'', the northern dialect would say ''moe sa boe''. This dialect used the [[#Alphabet(Latin script)|Roman alphabet]] for their writing system.
*'''Southern dialect''' and '''Eastern (Pa'an) dialect''' - these two dialect have very similar dialect but there may be words that each may not understand each other due to regional location which grew the language apart. These two dialect used the [[#Alphabet|Myanmar script]] as their writing system.
*There are also different accents in the Karen language.

==Alphabet==
{{see also|S'gaw Karen Script}}
The Karen alphabet consist of 25 consonants, 9 vowels, 5 tones and 5 medials. The Karen alphabet was derived from the [[Burmese script]]. It was created by the help of the English missionaries around the early 1860s.{{cn|date=January 2018}} The Karen alphabet was created for the purpose of translating the Bible into the Karen language. Karen script is written from left to right and requires no spaces between words, although modern writing usually contains spaces after each clause to enhance readability.

===Tones===
In Sgaw Karen, every syllable consists of a [[vowel]], either
alone, or preceded by a single or double [[consonant]]. A syllable
always ends in a vowel. Every syllable may be pronounced in six
different tones of voice, the meaning varying according to the
tone in which it is pronounced. 

{| class=wikitable
! Tones !! Description
|-
| ၢ်(အၢသံ) || is pronounced with a heavy falling inflection
|-
| ာ်(အးသံ) || is pronounced abruptly, at a low pitch
|-
| း(ဖျၢၣ်ဆံး) || is pronounced abruptly at an ordinary pitch 
|-
| ၣ်(ဟးသံ) || is pronounced with a falling circumflex inflection
|-
| ၤ(က့ၣ်ဖိ)|| is pronounced with a prolonged
even tone
|}
*Where no tone is marked, the syllable is pronounced with a rising inflection.

===Double consonants===
When one consonant follows another with no vowel sound
intervening, the second consonant is represented by a symbol,
which is joined to the character representing the first consonant.

==Tones==
Ken Manson (2009) proposed a Karen tone box to help understand Karenic tonal diversity and classify Karenic languages.&lt;ref name="Manson2009"&gt;Manson, Ken. 2009. ''A prolegomena to reconstructing Proto-Karen''. La Trobe Working Papers in Linguistics 12.&lt;/ref&gt; It is similar to William Gedney's [[Tai languages|Tai]] tone box (''see [[Proto-Tai language#Tones]]''). The tone box contains diagnostic words for use during field elicitation.

'''Stanoje Stamatović''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Станоје Стаматовић}}), known as '''Stanoje Glavaš''' (Станоје Главаш; 21 February 1763 – 15 February 1815) was a Serbian [[hajduk]]  and hero in the [[First Serbian Uprising]].

==Life==
Glavaš was born in 1763 in the village of [[Glibovac]], near [[Smederevska Palanka]], at the time part of the [[Sanjak of Smederevo]], [[Ottoman Empire]]. In his youth, he was a gentleman's tailor in Smederevska Palanka. He never married, which was unusual for small town business owners of the time in Serbia. For a time, he shared a house with a certain other confirmed bachelor, originally from [[Negotin]], one Borisav Petrović, and they had a joint entreprise for constructing adobe houses. During this time [[Karađorđe Petrović]] spent several months in Glavaš's house, either as an apprentice or as a [[hajduk]] in hiding during wintertime.&lt;ref&gt;According to an eponymous book about Stanoje Glavaš by Miladin Stevanović, Knjiga-komerc Publishing, Belgrade, 2005; {{ISBN|9788677120658}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Glavaš was the co-leader, with [[:sr:Станко Арамбашић|Stanko Arambašić (link to Serbian Wiki)]] and [[:sr:Лазар Добрић|Lazar Dobrić (also)]], of a hajduk company based in [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]]-held [[Syrmia]], which frequently crossed the Ottoman border, and attacked [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] forces and caravans in the Sanjak of Smederevo in the 1790s (including [[Koča's frontier rebellion]]).

In 1804, at the eve of the [[First Serbian Uprising]], Glavaš, [[Karađorđe]] and several other leaders gathered at [[Orašac, Serbia|Orašac]] to organize the revolt (see [[Serbian Revolution]]). Glava[ was suggested as leader. He refused the offer, opting for Karađorđe instead. In December 1806, commanders [[Vujica Vulićević|Vujica]], [[Mladen Milovanović]] and Glavaš commanded an army of 18,000 soldiers to defend the Serbs at the [[Battle of Deligrad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nebojša Damnjanović, Vladimir Merenik|title=The first Serbian uprising and the restoration of the Serbian state|publisher=Historical Museum of Serbia, Gallery of the Serbian Academy of Science and Arts|year=2004|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fight ended in Serbian victory, with [[Ibrahim Bushati]], pasha of [[Shkodër]], signing a 6-week truce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Esdaile|first=Charles|title=Napoleon's Wars|publisher=Viking Adult|year=2008|page=252}}&lt;/ref&gt; He led a company of around 3,000 men which liberated [[Prokuplje]] and [[Kuršumlija]].{{when|date=February 2014}} His company guarded the [[Morava Valley (Serbia)|Morava Valley]] and fought the Ottomans in the mountains of [[Niš]] and [[Novi Pazar]] for two months before being captured. He was killed by the Ottomans on 15 February 1815, after the demise of [[Hadži-Prodan's Uprising]]. His severed head was on display at the [[Kalemegdan]] along with other Serbian leaders.

==Legacy==
In his home town, there is a street and an [[Primary education|elementary school]] named after him. He is the subject of a Serbian heroic play written by [[Đura Jakšić]], which was widely shown throughout Serbia in the 19th century.

As a young widow, his mother remarried when he was about 12 or 13 (and that's when he became a tailor's apprentice) so he had several half-siblings, many years younger to whom he played a kind of fatherly role  in his mature age, especially as he did not have his own family. He also had full (i.e. not half-) brother and sister from his mother's first marriage (to his father) and as a leader of the [[Serbian Revolution]], he facilitated the marriage of his niece Marija (daughter of his brother) to [[Hajduk Veljko Petrović]], a fellow-hero and leader of the revolution (and there are surviving descendants of that union).&lt;ref&gt;Translated from Serbian Wikipedia&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sterling Burton Marlin''' (born June 30, 1957) is an American [[stock car racing|stock car]] racing driver. He formerly competed in the [[NASCAR]] [[Sprint Cup Series]], winning the [[Daytona 500]] in [[1994 Daytona 500|1994]] and [[1995 Daytona 500|1995]]. He is the son of late NASCAR driver [[Coo Coo Marlin]]. He is married to Paula and has a daughter, Sutherlin, and a son, [[Steadman Marlin|Steadman]], a former [[Nationwide Series]] driver.

==Career==

===Beginnings===
Marlin attended Spring Hill High School, where he played high school basketball and football, earning the captain status his senior year while he played quarterback and linebacker. He began his collection of civil war artifacts shortly after high school. In 1976, he made his NASCAR debut at Nashville Speedway, filling in for his injured father in the No. 14 [[H.B. Cunningham]] Chevrolet. He started 30th and finished 29th after suffering [[oil pump (internal combustion engine)|oil pump]] failure early in the race. He made two more starts in 1978, finishing ninth at [[World 600]] and twenty-fifth at Nashville for Cunningham. He ran Nashville again in 1979, finishing seventeenth. In 1980, he posted two top-tens, eighth in the [[Daytona 500]] for Cunningham, and seventh at Nashville for [[D.K. Ulrich]]. From 1980 to 1982, Marlin was a three-time track champion at the historic [[Nashville Speedway USA]].

===NASCAR career===

====1983–1990====
[[Image:SterlingMarlin17racecar1983.jpg|left|thumb|1983 Rookie of the Year]]
In 1983, Marlin was hired by [[Roger Hamby]] to drive his No. 17 [[Hesco Exhaust]]-sponsored [[Chevrolet]]. He posted a tenth-place finish at [[Dover International Speedway]] and finished 19th in the standings, clinching the Rookie of the Year award. Despite finishing 15th in the [[1984 Daytona 500]] for Hamby, Marlin spent most of the season running for [[Sadler Brothers Racing]], posting two top-ten finishes. He also competed in one race for [[Jimmy Means]] and [[Dick Bahre]] respectively. Marlin only made eight starts in 1985, seven of them coming for Sadler, his best finish being 12th at [[Talladega Superspeedway]]. He ended his season at [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]] in the [[Bank of America 500|Miller High Life 500]], driving the [[Helen Rae Special]]. He finished 29th, after suffering flywheel failure.

Marlin moved over to the No. 1 [[Bull's Eye Barbecue Sauce]]-sponsored car owned by [[Hoss Ellington]] in 1986. His best finish that season came at the [[Coke Zero 400|Firecracker 400]], where he finished second. Marlin received a full-time ride in 1987, when he was hired by [[Billy Hagan (racing driver)|Billy Hagan]] to drive the No. 44 [[Piedmont Airlines]]-sponsored [[Oldsmobile]]. He had four top-fives and finished 11th in points. The following season, he had seven finishes of eighth or better in the first ten races and finished tenth in the standings. In 1989, the team received sponsorship from [[Sunoco]] and switched to the number 94. He tied a career-best 13 top-ten finishes but dropped to 12th in the final standings. He left the team at the end of the 1990 season. During the 1990 season, he won his first career [[Busch Series]] race at Charlotte, driving the No. 48 [[Diamond Ridge]]-sponsored Chevrolet owned by Fred Turner.

====1991–1997====
[[Image:SterlingMarlin1997Pocono.jpg|thumb|left|1997 car at Pocono]]
Marlin signed to drive the No. 22 [[Maxwell House]]-sponsored [[Ford Thunderbird]] for [[Junior Johnson]] in 1991. He had a second-place finish at Daytona to start the season and won two poles at [[Talladega Superspeedway]] and the Firecracker 400, finishing seventh in the standings. The next season, he won an additional five poles and had six top-five finishes. Despite his career-high pole total, Marlin departed to drive the No. 8 [[Raybestos]]-sponsored Ford for [[Stavola Brothers Racing]]. He had just one top-five finish and fell to fourteenth in the standings.

Marlin's first career win came in his 279th career start at the [[1994 Daytona 500]] driving for [[Morgan-McClure Motorsports]] in the No. 4 [[Kodak]]-sponsored Chevrolet. He went on to win the 500 again in the following year, becoming only one of three drivers to win consecutive Daytona 500s. The other two men that have accomplished that feat were [[Richard Petty]] and [[Cale Yarborough]]. He also became the only driver to have his first two career wins at the Daytona 500.  Marlin won 2 more times during the 1995 season and finished a career high third in the point standings, during a four-year run with Morgan-McClure Motorsports. In 1997, he did not return to victory lane and dropped to 25th in the final standings. He left the No. 4 team at year's end.

====1998–2006====
In 1998, he joined [[SABCO Racing]] to drive the No. 40 [[Coors Light]]-sponsored Chevrolet. He opened the season by winning the [[Gatorade 125]], a qualifying race for the Daytona 500 but three weeks later, he failed to qualify for the [[Golden Corral 500|Primestar 500]], the first race he had missed since 1986. He finished in the Top 10 six times and had a 13th-place points finish. In 1999, he won his first pole since 1995 at [[Pocono Raceway]], but dropped down to sixteenth in the standings. In 2000, he won his second career Busch Series race, driving SABCO's No. 82 entry at [[Bristol Motor Speedway]]. During the season, he lost teammate [[Kenny Irwin, Jr.]] in a practice crash at [[New Hampshire International Speedway]]. After finishing in the Top 10 seven times, he fell back to 19th in the overall standings.

In [[2001 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|2001]], SABCO's majority ownership stake was purchased by [[Champ Car|CART]] &amp; [[IndyCar]] championship owner [[Chip Ganassi]] and the team switched to [[Dodge Intrepid]]s. In his first race with the new team, Marlin won the Gatorade 125 qualifying race at Daytona. Three days later at the Daytona 500, Marlin appeared to make contact with [[Dale Earnhardt]], causing Earnhardt to [[Death of Dale Earnhardt|crash]] into the turn 4 wall, an impact that would kill him. In the following days, Marlin and his family received [[hate mail]] and death threats from angry fans who felt that Marlin was responsible for Earnhardt's death. He was eventually publicly defended by two of Earnhardt's drivers, [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.|his son]] and race winner [[Michael Waltrip]], and was also cleared of any wrongdoing by NASCAR's investigation into the accident. He won Dodge's first race in its return to NASCAR at [[Michigan International Speedway]], as well as winning the [[UAW-GM Quality 500]] at Charlotte. He tied his career best points finish of third that season. Had the current [[Chase for the Sprint Cup|Chase]] points system been in place in 2001, Marlin would have been the 2001 champion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Willis|first=Matthew|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/rpm/nascar/cup/news/story?id=3578587|title=Ancient Chaseology: 2000-2003|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2008-09-13|accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2002, Marlin had a strong car at the [[2002 Daytona 500|Daytona 500]], and towards the end was battling Jeff Gordon for the lead when they made contact, sending Gordon spinning, and triggering a crash. NASCAR red-flagged the race so it would not finish under caution, and stopped the field momentarily on the backstretch. Concerned about a damaged right front fender, Marlin jumped out of his car and started pulling the fender away from the tire. As working on the car is prohibited during red flag conditions, Marlin was sent to the tail end of the field for the restart.

The following week, Marlin finished second in Rockingham to [[Matt Kenseth]]. Marlin took the points lead&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/races/cup/2002/2/data/standings_official.html |title=NASCAR Sprint Cup Standings |publisher=Nascar.Com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and did not let it go for the following 24 weeks. For most of that time he held a comfortable lead, which reached triple digits several times. Marlin followed this 2nd-place finish with a win at the [[UAW-DaimlerChrysler 400]] at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, but not without controversy: During the race, Marlin spun while making late race pit stop, causing him to break the pit road speed limit. NASCAR's penalty for being too fast entering pit road was to hold the car in its pit stall for an additional 15 seconds, but the official at Marlin's pit stall was not informed of the penalty until ''after'' the crew had released the car. NASCAR determined that they had no precedent for forcing Marlin to return to the pits as his early release was their mistake (and they could not order him to return for a stop and go penalty). Following the incident, NASCAR changed the rule so that all speeding violations are enforced with a drive through penalty (forcing the driver to travel the length of pit road at the speed limit).

After this win, Marlin finished 9th the following week at Atlanta. The week after that, he won the Carolina Dodge Dealers 400 at [[Darlington Raceway]], which would be the final win of his Cup career.

[[File:MarlinWaltrip2006.jpg|right|thumb|200px|No. 14 Marlin battles No. 55 [[Michael Waltrip]] at the 2006 spring Bristol race.]]

With a series of strong finishes (7th at Texas, 5th at Talladega, 7th at California, 4th in June at Pocono, 3rd at Daytona, 3rd at the second Pocono race, 6th at Michigan in August, 7th at Bristol, and 4th at Darlington in the fall), Marlin was still 91 points ahead of second place entering the [[Richmond_Raceway|Chevy Monte Carlo 400]] in September. However, Marlin finished that race in last place after an early accident&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/races/cup/2002/26/data/results_official.html |title=Nascar.Com |publisher=Nascar.Com |date=2002-09-07 |accessdate=2012-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and saw his points lead all but evaporate as [[Mark Martin]], who had entered the race 125 points behind Marlin, gained 116 points and moved into second place in the points as Marlin's lead shrunk to nine points ([[Jeff Gordon]], who had leapfrogged Martin for second place in the standings with a win the week before, also gained on Marlin but dropped to fourth due to the strong finishes from both Martin and [[Jimmie Johnson]], who gained 95 points on Marlin to move into third).&lt;ref name="nascar2002"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/races/cup/2002/26/data/standings_official.html |title=NASCAR Sprint Cup Standings |publisher=Nascar.Com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Sylvania 300|New Hampshire 300]] the next week Marlin lost the points lead as Martin finished four places ahead of him, gaining 15 points.&lt;ref name="nascar2002"/&gt; The next week, Marlin dropped to 4th in the standings after a 21st-place finish at Dover.&lt;ref name="nascar2002"/&gt;

One week later, at the [[Protection One 400]] at Kansas, Marlin had a hard crash after 147 laps and finished 33rd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/races/cup/2002/29/data/results_official.html |title=Nascar.Com |publisher=Nascar.Com |date=2002-09-29 |accessdate=2012-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was diagnosed with a cracked vertebra in his neck and would be forced to miss the remaining seven races. Marlin was replaced by Busch Series driver [[Jamie McMurray]], who had recently been signed by Chip Ganassi Racing to drive for the team in the 2003 season. McMurray won the [[NASCAR Banking 500|UAW-GM Quality 500]] in his second start with Marlin's car, and Marlin telephoned McMurray during the post-race festivities to congratulate him. Marlin ultimately finished 18th in the final season points with eight Top 5s and ten Top 10s. It has been rumored that the broken neck signified the beginning of the struggles for Chip Ganassi Racing and the beginning of the dissolving of Sterling Marlin's career in motorsports.

Marlin did not finish in the Top 5 in 2003, but had 11 Top 10 and matched his previous year's finish of 18th in points. He did however come close to a win at the 2003 Sharpie 500 at his hometown in Bristol Tennessee. Marlin controlled the race early and mid-way and appeared to have victory in his hands until he was wrecked by [[Kurt Busch]] with less than 150 laps to go. Kurt Busch went on to win the race but apologized in victory lane. Sterling Marlin however was not pleased with Busch in post-race ceremonies, stating "What a bone-headed move. I guess Spencer didn't punch him hard enough.", as a reference to Kurt Busch and Jimmy Spencer's altercation the previous week.
 
Despite three Top 5s in [[2004 NASCAR Nextel Cup Series|2004]], he fell to 21st in points. During the [[2005 in NASCAR|2005 season]], Ganassi announced Marlin would be replaced by [[David Stremme]] for the [[2006 NASCAR Nextel Cup Series|2006 season]] in order to attract the younger male demographic. It was also said that [[Richard Childress Racing]] had offered Marlin a deal to drive the No. 07 Jack Daniels-sponsored Chevrolet, However, Marlin honored his contract with Ganassi and finished out the 2005 season. He did however miss one race-the 2005 [[Cheez-It 355 at The Glen|Sirius at the Glen]] to attend the funeral of his father [[Coo Coo Marlin]] who died of lung cancer one day before the race. Road ringer [[Scott Pruett]] replaced Sterling in the 40 and finished 4th in the race.

He reached as high as 6th in the points standings, but would later fall to 30th in the final standings.

Marlin joined [[MB2 Motorsports]] for 2006 to drive the [[Waste Management (company)|Waste Management]] Chevy, running with the No. 14 in tribute to his father, Coo Coo Marlin, who died during the 2005 season. Marlin's only Top 10 finish in 2006 was 9th place at Richmond.  His 2006 season was shadowed by bad luck and No. 14 finished 36th in owner points.

====2007–2010====
Marlin was able to qualify via speed for each of the first five races of the 2007 season, his [[Pep Boys]] No. 14 team was the only team out of the top 35 from 2006 to do this. Marlin's run in the No. 14 ended on July 17, 2007, when Ginn Racing announced [[Regan Smith]], who had been splitting time with [[Mark Martin (racecar driver)|Mark Martin]] in Ginn's [[U.S. Army]]-sponsored No. 01 car, would replace him beginning at the [[Allstate 400 at the Brickyard]] at Indianapolis. He attempted to qualify for two races in 2007, but he failed to qualify for either. He tried to make the [[Sharpie 500]] at Bristol in the No. 78 car as a replacement for [[Kenny Wallace]], and the [[UAW-Ford 500]] at Talladega, replacing [[Mike Wallace (racing driver)|Mike Wallace]] in the No. 09 car. However, in November he managed to qualify the No. 09 and drove at Phoenix for a 25th-place finish, and a week later at Homestead finishing 33rd.

Marlin failed to qualify for the 2008 Daytona 500 in the No. 09 car, but qualified at Talladega and the following week at Richmond as well. For Darlington, Marlin raced in his old No. 40 car and qualified 14th, and also at the Coca-Cola 600 at [[Lowe's Motor Speedway]] in the No. 40, still in for the injured [[Dario Franchitti]]. He finished out the rest of the season driving for [[Phoenix Racing (NASCAR team)|Phoenix Racing]]. In March 2009, Marlin participated in and won the Saturday Night Special, a charity event at Bristol Motor Speedway which included NASCAR Legends. He led the entire event in a car painted similar to the one he drove with [[Morgan McClure Motorsports]], and wearing an older-style Coors Light uniform from his days while driving for Chip Ganassi.

[[Image:Sterling Marlin 2008 Miccosukee Chevy Impala.jpg|thumb|right|No. 09 Cup racecar in 2008]]
For the 2009 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, Marlin continued to run a limited schedule in the No. 09 Phoenix Racing Miccosukee Resort &amp; Gaming Chevrolet.  His best finish for the 2009 season was 35th at Martinsville, which also proved the last of his 748 career starts.

An announcement was made preceding the Cup Series finale weekend at [[Homestead-Miami Speedway]] that Marlin would attempt the race in the No. 70 Chevrolet for [[TRG Motorsports]], though Marlin later denied it.

==Retirement==
Marlin announced his retirement from racing on March 18, 2010, and formerly owned a Chevrolet dealership in [[Ashland City, Tennessee]] and a Dodge dealership in [[Dickson, Tennessee]]. In 2012, Marlin publicly revealed that he had been diagnosed with [[Parkinsonism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/press-box-former-nascar-driver-234007287--spt.html;_ylt=A2KJjaiaC49Q_nkAGjvQtDMD|title=Press Box: Former NASCAR driver Sterling Marlin has Parkinsonism|publisher=[[Yahoo! Sports]]|date=2012-10-29|accessdate=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presently==
In late 2011, Marlin helped form Tennessee Racing Association, LLC, along with several other drivers (including [[Chad Chaffin]] and [[Mike Alexander (racing driver)|Mike Alexander]]) and businessmen, in an effort to preserve [[Fairgrounds Speedway]] and allow the track to remain active in the racing community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nashville Superspeedway &amp; Fairgrounds Track News/Rumors|work=Jayski's Silly Season Site|publisher=Tennessee Racing Association, LLC|url=http://www.jayski.com/pages/tracks/nashville.htm|accessdate=November 2, 2013|date=December 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he is retired from [[NASCAR]] competition, Marlin still remains an active driver in the Pro Late Model Division at [[Fairgrounds Speedway]]. He currently leads the point standings in that division to go along with his two victories in 2013, driving the No. 40 car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fairgrounds Speedway Nashville - Current Standings|work=Fairgrounds Speedway Nashville|url=http://www.fairgroundsspeedwaynashville.com/standings/|accessdate=November 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Utnapishtim''' or '''Utanapishtim''' ({{lang-akk|{{cuneiform|𒌓𒍣}}}}) is a character in the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' who is tasked by [[Enki]] (Ea) to abandon his worldly possessions and create a giant ship to be called ''Preserver of Life''. He was also tasked with bringing his wife, family, and relatives along with the craftsmen of his village, baby animals, and grains.&lt;ref name="Rosenberg1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenberg|first=Donna|title=World Mythology: An Anthology of the Great Myths and Epics|year=1994|publisher=National Textbook Company|location=Lincolnwood, Chicago|isbn=0-8442-5765-6|pages=196–200}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oncoming flood would wipe out all animals and people not on the ship, a concept similar to the biblical story of [[Noah's Ark]]. After twelve days on the water, Utnapishtim opened the hatch of his ship to look around and saw the slopes of [[Mount Nisir]], where he rested his ship for seven days. On the seventh day, he sent a dove out to see if the water had receded, and the dove could find nothing but water, so it returned. Then he sent out a swallow, and just as before, it returned, having found nothing. Finally, Utnapishtim sent out a raven, and the raven saw that the waters had receded, so it circled around, but did not return. Utnapishtim then set all the animals free, and made a sacrifice to the gods. The gods came, and because he had preserved the seed of man while remaining loyal and trusting of his gods, Utnapishtim and his wife were given immortality, as well as a place among the heavenly gods. Enki (Ea) also claims that he did not tell "Atrahasis" (apparently referring to Utnapishtim) about the flood, but rather that he only made a dream appear to him,&lt;ref name="GardnerMaier1984"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gardner|last2=Maier|first1=John|first2=John|title=Gilgamesh: translated from the Sin-leqi-unninni version|year=1984|publisher=Random House, Inc|location=New York, New York|isbn=0-394-74089-0|page=240}}&lt;/ref&gt; a claim which contradicts the earlier narrative of the poem and reveals an alternative telling.

== Role in the epic ==
In the epic, overcome with the death of his friend Enkidu, the hero [[Gilgamesh]] sets out on a series of journeys to search for his ancestor Utnapishtim (Xisouthros) who lives at the mouth of the rivers and has been given eternal life. Utnapishtim counsels Gilgamesh to abandon his search for immortality, but gives him a trial to defy sleep if he wishes to obtain immortality. Failing at his trial to defy sleep, Utnapishtim next tells Gilgamesh about a plant that can make him young again. Gilgamesh obtains the plant from the bottom of the sea in [[Dilmun]] (often considered to be current-day [[Bahrain]]) but a serpent steals it, and Gilgamesh returns home to the city of [[Uruk]], having abandoned hope of either immortality or renewed youth.

==''Preserver of Life''==
The ''Preserver of Life'' was made of solid timber, so that the rays of [[Shamash]] (the sun) would not shine in, and of equal dimensions in length and width. The design of the ship was supposedly drawn on the ground by Enki, and the frame of the ark, which was made in five days, was 200 feet in length, width and height, with a floor-space of one acre.&lt;ref name="Rosenberg1994"/&gt; The ark interior had seven floors, each floor divided into 9 sections, finishing the ark fully on the seventh day. The entrance to the ship was sealed once everyone had boarded the ship.
