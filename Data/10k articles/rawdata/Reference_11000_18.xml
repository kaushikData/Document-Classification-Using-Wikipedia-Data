[[File:Masterpiece1704edition.jpg|thumb|Frontispiece and  contents page from 1704  edition of ''Aristotle's Masterpiece'']]
'''''Aristotle's Masterpiece''''', also known as '''''The Works of Aristotle, the Famous Philosopher''''', is a [[sex manual]] and a [[midwifery]] book that was popular in England from the early modern period through to the 19th century. It was first published in 1684 and written by an unknown author who falsely claimed to be [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name="fissell" /&gt; As a consequence the author is now described as a [[Pseudo-Aristotle]], the collective name for unidentified authors who masqueraded as Aristotle. It is claimed that the book was banned in Britain until the 1960s,&lt;ref name="ex-classics" /&gt; although there was no provision in the UK for "banning" books as such. However reputable publishers and booksellers might have been cautious about vending ''Aristotle's Masterpiece'', at least in the wake of the [[Obscene Publications Act 1857|1857 Obscene Publications Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hall|first=Lesley A.|title=It wasn't 'banned', and it's hardly rare|url=http://lesleyahall.blogspot.co.uk/2013/01/it-wasnt-banned-and-its-hardly-rare.html|publisher=Lesley A. Hall Blog|accessdate=2013-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
After [[Nicholas Culpeper]]'s ''Directory for Midwives'' had been published in 1651, other writers and booksellers sought to emulate its great success. ''Aristotle's Masterpiece'' was among the two dozen works in the genre which were published in the following decades. This was in sharp contrast to the three titles which had been published on the subject in the previous century. Through the seventeenth and eighteenth century, the work was published in three different versions in 9, 20 and 78 editions respectively.&lt;ref name="fissell" /&gt; It was probably the most widely reprinted book on a medical subject in the eighteenth and early nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="bull" /&gt;

===Versions===
The first version borrowed most of its content from two earlier works, the ''Secret Miracles of Nature'' by [[Levinus Lemnius]] and the anonymous ''Complete Midwives Practice Enlarged''. The latter had been a successful work by itself, coming second only to Culpeper's ''Directory for Midwives'' in number of seventeenth century editions.&lt;ref name="fissell" /&gt;

A second version was released by publisher [[Benjamin Harris (publisher)|Benjamin Harris]] in 1697. The first half contained most of the first version and the second half was borrowed from John Sadler's ''A Sick Women's Private Looking-Glas'', which was published in 1636. The third version was published around 1710 was more different from the previous versions, but again copied material from other works on the subject. These included the ''Directory for Midwives'', John Pechey's 1698 version of the ''Compleate Midwive's Practice Enlarged'' and other popular books on sex and reproduction available at the time.&lt;ref name="fissell" /&gt;

The third version was still printed and sold to a general audience in the early twentieth century. It remained unchanged from the eighteenth century editions because modern theory on sexuality had not yet been conceived. Because the book was based on the ancient theory of [[humorism]] it provided some outdated information, in particular on the home remedies it prescribed. Nevertheless, it was in fact more accurate and less harmful than some popular works on sexuality dating from the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="bull" /&gt;

===Reasons for attribution to Aristotle===
The title of the work was possibly chosen because Aristotle was seen as a sex expert in early modern England. Another popular pseudo-Aristotelian text which covered sex and reproduction, ''Aristotle's Problems'' (1595), had been responsible for this reputation.&lt;ref name="fissell" /&gt; The real Aristotle had also written works about the reproduction of animals (such as ''[[History of Animals]]'' and ''[[Generation of Animals]]'') and was considered an authority on scientific matters in general.&lt;ref name="bull" /&gt;

==Content==
The third version is divided in two parts. The first part covers anatomy, sexual intercourse and marriage. The second part was intended for married women and explains pregnancy and [[midwifery]].

The first part starts with a description of the male and female [[sex organ]]s in the first chapter. The second chapter advocates sexual intercourse in [[monogamy|monogamous]] relationships and warns against [[polygamy]] and [[adultery]] because it is forbidden by [[christianity|Christian]] doctrine. It finishes with an explanation of when the reproductive age begins and ends. The third chapter explores [[virginity]]. It correctly states that a torn [[hymen]] does not necessarily mean a woman is not a virgin.

The second part continues with the process of [[fertilisation]], pregnancy and how the sex of the fetus can be determined. The second chapter provides advice on how women can become pregnant. The third chapter describes the progress of pregnancy. Failure of the pregnancy, [[infertility]] and its causes are the subject of the fourth chapter. The part ends with a chapter on things women should do and avoid during their pregnancy.

'''Arjuna''' (in [[Devanagari]]: अर्जुन ''{{IAST|arjuna}}'') is the main central character of the ancient Indian epic ''[[Mahabharata]]'' and plays a key role in the [[Bhagavad Gita]] alongside [[Krishna]]. It is believed that Arjuna was best archer in the world at their time. Arjuna was the son of ''[[Indra]]'', the king of the celestials, born of ''[[Kunti]]'', the first wife of King ''[[Pandu]]'' in the ''[[Kuru Kingdom]]''. In a previous birth he was a saint named ''Nara'' who was the lifelong companion of another saint ''[[Narayana]]'' an incarnation of [[Lord Vishnu]] who took rebirth as Lord Krishna. He was the third of the [[Pandava]] brothers and was married to [[Draupadi]], [[Ulupi]], [[Chitrāngadā]] and [[Subhadra]] (Krishna's and Balarama's sister) at different times. His children included [[Upapandavas#Srutakarma|Srutakarma]], [[Iravan]], [[Babruvahana]], and [[Abhimanyu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03040.htm|title=Mahadeva praising Arjuna|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Birth and youth ==
[[File:Boon of Indra to Kunti.jpg|thumb|[[Indra]] bestows a favor on [[Kunti]]]]

Arjuna's birth is most celebrated one and he was born 9 months after the birth of [[krishna]]. A prophesy is said about his birth and so many gods attended to see him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m01/m01124.htm|title=Describes Arjuna birth|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of Pandu (and Madri's subsequent [[Sati (practice)|sati]]), the Pandavas and their mother lived in Hastinapura, where they were brought up together with their cousins, the [[Kaurava]] brothers. Along with his brothers, Arjuna was trained in religion, science, administration and military arts by Bhishma, their granduncle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Johnson|first=W. J|title=A Dictionary of Hinduism|encyclopedia=[[Oxford Reference]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2009|doi=10.1093/acref/9780198610250.001.0001|subscription=yes}} {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One day, when the princes were playing a game, they lost their ball in a [[Water well|well]]. When the rest of the children gave up the ball as being lost, Arjuna stayed behind trying to get it. A stranger came by and extracted the ball for him by making a chain of "sarkanda" (a wild grass). When an astonished Arjuna related the story to Bhishma, Bhishma realised that the stranger was none other than Drona. Bhishma asked Drona to become the Kuru princes' teacher. Seeking refuge from [[Panchala]], Drona agreed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Leeming|first=W. J|title=The Oxford Companion to World Mythology|encyclopedia=[[Oxford Reference]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2009|doi=10.1093/acref/9780195156690.001.0001|subscription=yes}} {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many asuras were killed by him.

== Tutelage under Drona ==

Under [[Drona]]'s tutelage, the [[Kauravas]] and the [[Pandavas]], along with the princes of Hastinapura's allies and [[vassal]]s, learned [[weaponry]]. Arjuna became Drona's favorite and most accomplished pupil; specifically, he became a master in using the [[archery|bow and the arrow]]. In a famous incident, Drona deemed that out of all his students, even his own son [[Ashwatthama]], none but Arjuna had the steadfast focus to shoot the eye of a bird on a tree; he was proven right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parmeshwaranand|first=Swami|title=Encyclopaedic dictionary of Purāṇas|year=2001|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|location=New Delhi|isbn=9788176252263|pages=512–513|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One day, on being questioned by Ashwatthama; why was Drona being partial to Arjuna, Drona replied Arjuna that he was not being partial to any-one but his favourite was Arjuna. His intention was very clear that he loved Arjuna but didn't ill-treat anyone. He ordered Ashwatthama to gather all of his students including Ashwatthama to assemble at near by lake that evening. they did as Drona told. Drona was taking bath; suddenly a crocodile appeared attacking Drona. Nobody except Arjuna were dare to enter into lake. Arjuna then jumped into the lake &amp; began attacking the mighty crocodile with bare hands. Suddenly crocodile disappeared. Drona told everyone that the crocodile was just illusion and created by himself to test all the princes &amp; Ashwatthama. Drona also scolded the rest that they were not ready to save their teacher except Arjuna. Thus Drona proudly declared that Arjuna was his favourite and pet student.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hotstar.com/tv/mahabharat/435/arjun-saves-dronacharya/1000011813&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Swayamvara of Panchala's princess, Draupadi.jpg|thumb|the Swayamvara of Panchala's princess, [[Draupadi]]]]

Pandavas secretly went from Varnavrat after saving themselves from an evil plan of Duryodhana, Shakuni and Karna.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m01/m01153.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 1: Adi Parva: Jatugriha Parva: Section CLII|website=www.[[sacred-texts.com]]|access-date=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still in hiding, the [[Pandavas]] disguised themselves as [[brahmin]]s and attended the [[Swayamvara]] of [[Panchala]] princess [[Draupadi]]. Out of all of the great kings and other [[Kaurava]] princes, only Arjuna was able to do the established challenge. The test is to lift, string, and fire [[Shiva Dhanush|Pinakin]] to pierce the eye of a golden fish whilst only looking at its reflection; [[Drupada]] had designed this test with Arjuna in mind. Like many other contenders [[Karna]] &amp; [[Shalya]] also failed to lift the bow and sting it. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m01/m01190.htm&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/mbs/mbs01179.htm|title=Failure of Karna in Draupadi syamwara|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At last Arjuna came forward and lifted his bow with just one hand and hit the target. Hence, he won Draupadi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/mbs/mbs01179.htm|title=The Mahabharata in Sanskrit: Book 1: Chapter 179|website=www.sacred-texts.com|access-date=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later [[Karna]] attacked Arjuna out of jealousy but Arjuna easily defeated him then Karna asked about his real identity, Arjuna smiled and said that he was a Brahmin. Then Karna praised him by comparing him with Lord Vishnu. Arjuna threatened to kill Karna which made Karna flee from battlefield.
When the brothers returned with Draupadi, Pandavas joked to his mother that they had brought [[alms]]. Dismissively, and without looking because she was preoccupied, Kunti asked him to share it with his brothers. Holding his mother's orders as a divine command, he requested his elder brother to accept Draupadi. [[Draupadi]] had to marry all five of the Pandavas. Her five sons, one from each of the Pandava brothers, are known as the [[Upapandavas]]. [[Srutakarma]] is the son of Arjuna.

At this point in the Mahabharata, the Pandavas revealed that they were alive. With both Duryodhana and Yudhishthira being [[crown prince]]s, tensions were high. Under Bhishma's advice, the kingdom is split, with the Kauravas getting [[Hastinapur]] and the Pandavas getting [[Khandavaprastha]]. Khandavaprastha, however, was an extremely underdeveloped land and had [[Fertility (soil)|infertile soil]], requiring extensive [[tillage|tilling]], so the Pandavas set to work rebuilding the land by burning a thousand acres of forest. Their cousins [[Krishna]] and [[Balarama]] helped them.

== Love of Lord Krishna for Arjuna ==
The friendship bond of [[Krishna|Lord Krishna]] and Arjuna is the most celebrated bond in Hindu mythology followed by the bond of [[Rama|Lord Rama]] and [[Hanuman|Lord Hanuman]]. According to Mahabharata, Arjuna was the incarnation of Lord Nara who was the best friend of [[Vishnu|Lord Vishnu]] and along with Nara, Lord [[Vishnu]] defeated all the demons after the churning of Ocean Samudra Manthan. According to Lord [[Shiva]], Nara and Lord Vishnu holds the whole universe and incarnates in every Yuga to end the evil and establish righteousness. The love of Lord Krishna for Arjuna is evident from Adi Parva where after the fight in Khandava forest instead of asking any weapon or power Lord [[Krishna]] asked [[Indra]] that his friendship with Arjuna will remain forever when the latter asked Lord Krishna to ask for a boon. Lord Krishna also described his love for Arjuna in Vana Parva by saying that whoever will hate Arjuna will hate Lord [[Krishna]] and whoever will follow Arjuna will follow Lord Krishna. He even said that nobody in the whole world is dearer to him than Arjuna and he can sacrifice anything including his sons, wives and citizens just for the sake of Arjuna. During his final conversation with his father Vasudeva he told him that he wants Arjuna to perform his last rites and also said that Lord Krishna is Arjuna and Arjuna is Lord Krishna. Such was the greatness of Arjuna that the supreme God [[Krishna|Lord Krishna]] was ready to sacrifice anything for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03012.htm|title=Love of Lord Krishna for Arjuna|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Burning of Khandava Vana ==
The story, this was the first time Arjuna meets [[Krishna]]. In any case, [[Khandavaprastha]] was where Arjuna and Krishna's friendship was truly forged. Once when roaming in the Khandava Vana, Arjuna and Krishna met the god of fire, [[Agni]]. Agni was in great hunger and needed to burn down the entire Khandava Vana to quench his hunger. But [[Takshaka]], the serpent-king lived in the same forest and was a friend of [[Indra]]'s. So the latter brought down heavy [[rains]] to thwart Agni's plans to burn the woods. Agni requested Krishna and Arjuna to help him realise his goal.&lt;ref name="autogenerated518"&gt;{{cite book|title=Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa.|year=2008|publisher=The Echo Library|location=Teddington, Middlesex|isbn=9781406870459|pages=518–520}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arjuna asked Agni for Gandiva as normal bows were not capable to bear the strength of his arms. The three of them then invoked [[Varuna]], the [[God]] of the [[oceans]], who blessed Arjuna with the [[Gandiva]] – the agni-moon bow created by [[Brahma]]. In this way, Arjuna came into possession of his famous bow. Agni also gave Arjuna an incandescent chariot with four horses yoked, and bearing a flag that would one-day be occupied by celestial apes of Vishwkarma.Arjuna also obtained his famous [[Devadatta|conch]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

With Krishna using the [[Sudarshana Chakra]]&lt;ref name="menon302"&gt;{{cite book|last=Menon|first=[translated by] Ramesh|title=The Mahabharata : a modern rendering|year=2006|publisher=iUniverse, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=9780595401871|pages=302–304}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Arjuna and Krishna waged a successful battle against [[Indra]] and helped [[Agni]] burn down the entire Khandava Vana. Indra's pride in Arjuna's success overcame his anger, and he bestowed greater powers on him. At last all gods, demons and snakes got defeated by Arjuna at this Khandava war.

=== Saving Mayasura ===

[[File:Krishna orders Mayasura to build a palace for the Pandavas.jpg|thumb|left|Sri Krishna tells Mayasura to build a palace]]In their demolition of Khandava, Krishna and Arjuna had saved one demon, [[Mayasura]] to build their palace.&lt;ref name="autogenerated518"/&gt; Thus owing Arjuna a favor, and after being so directed by Krishna, Mayasura said that he would build a palace for [[Yudhishtra]]. As Mayasura was a great architect of the [[Asuras]], he soon constructed the Maya assembly hall – a gigantic palace for the Pandavas, filled with ancient books, artifacts, and jewels. This hall was famous for visual illusions. Thus, [[Khandavaprastha]] was renamed [[Indraprastha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Verma|first=retold by Virendra|title=The Mahābhārata : (the great epic of ancient India)|year=1989|publisher=Pitambar Pub.

== Arjuna's Tirtha-yatra and Indraprastha ==
[[File:Arjuna enters Dharma's Budoir.jpg|thumb|Arjuna enters Dharma's Boudoir]]
Arjuna violated [[Yudhishthira]] and [[Draupadi]]'s privacy while they were playing the game of dice, as he had left the [[Gandiva]] in their room. Despite the understanding of all and being forgiven by both Yudhishthira and Draupadi, Arjuna accepted the punishment agreed with Narada and set off on a twelve-year [[pilgrimage|tirtha-yatra]]. According to Narada, Arjuna must retire to forest and pass his days as Brahmacharin for 12 years, so he did.

=== [[Ulupi]] at Nagaloka ===

One day Arjuna was taking bath in nearby [[Ganga]] river flow. Suddenly a current in the river pulled down Arjuna. He fell through regions and reached a place. As soon as he opened eyes, he saw a beautiful woman standing in front of him. The woman introduced herself as [[Ulupi]]-the princess of Nagaloka. She also told Arjuna that the current was created by her in order to drag Arjuna to her land because she loved Arjuna very much as Arjuna was the greatest archer and extreme handsome person. Arjuna explained his situation. [[Ulupi]] told him that she knew everything. Soon [[Ulupi]] married Arjuna and he set-out to finish his pilgrimage. A son, namely [[Iravan]] was produced as the union of Arjuna and [[Ulupi]].&lt;ref&gt;http://hindumythologyforgennext.blogspot.com/2012/05/arjuna-and-uloopi-part-1-of-2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chitrāngadā at Manipura ===

Arjuna visited other Tirthas in [[India]], including [[Kalinga (Mahabharata)|Kalinga]] and the ashrams of the [[Saptarishi]]s, [[Agastya]], [[Vasishta]] and [[Bhrigu]]. He reached the palace of [[Manipur]]. Here he met King Chitravahana's daughter, [[Chitrāngadā]]. After seeing the beauty of Chitrāngadā, Arjuna fell in love with her and asked the king to let them marry. The king accepted Arjuna's proposal because Arjuna was extremely handsome, intelligent and attractive. According to the customs of Manipura the son of the princess would become the King of Manipura. It was mutual benefit for Arjuna since [[Draupadi]] didn’t want other woman equal to queen in [[Indraprastha]]. Soon a son was born to them namely [[Babruvahana]].

=== Meeting [[Hanuman]] ===

Arjuna, after covering various shrines, arrived at Rameshwaram in the south. An age ago, [[Rama]] had established a Shivalinga here, seeking the blessings of Shiva before commencing his journey to Lanka to rescue his wife Sita. His army of monkeys and bears had constructed a bridge of stones and trees across the vast ocean. Arjuna gazed at the remains of this bridge that had survived. A thought struck him and he wondered aloud, "Why on Earth did a great archer like [[Rama]] have to rely on creatures like monkeys and bears to build a bridge? Why couldn't he have instead bridged the distance with arrows?" His fellow pilgrims shook their heads, clearly at a loss for an answer. Then, a small monkey who had been following the company for quite some distance replied Arjuna that Stalwarts like [[Sugreeva]], [[Nala]], [[Neela]], [[Angada]] and [[Hanuman]] adorned their ranks. No bridge of arrows could have withstood their weight. The monkey added "Why, no bridge of arrows could even withstand my weight, puny as I am!" Arjuna was quick to take up what he perceived as an implied challenge. "Let us have a wager. I shall lay down a bridge of arrows. I am willing to burn myself if it fails to bear your weight." The monkey agreed. Arjuna, taking the aid of his famed quiver of inexhaustible arrows, laid down a bridge across the ocean. The monkey jumped onto it and no sooner had he walked ten paces than the bridge collapsed. Arjuna helped the monkey out of the water and asked for another attempt. The monkey agreed. Arjuna constructed another bridge, this time laying his arrows closer to each other, and asked the monkey to try again. The monkey set out on the bridge in the direction of the island of Lanka yet again but the bridge collapsed. Arjuna was ashamed of himself. Not wasting any more time, he prepared a pyre and was about to step into it and give up his life, in accordance with the terms of the wager when a youth held him back and stopped him. "What were you about to do, o mighty prince?", asked the boy, surprised. "I was given a challenge and I failed. I do not wish to continue with this life now that I have faced such great shame", replied Arjuna. The boy was aghast. "But was there an adjudicator? Who was there to see if the challenger was playing fair? A contest without a judge is meaningless. Pray construct another bridge and this time, I shall be the judge." Neither Arjuna, nor the monkey could refute the boy's argument and so they got ready for a third round. Infused with some confidence, Arjuna built a third bridge, using every bit of his ingenuity. "There! Try crossing it now", he said to the monkey. The monkey happily obliged. He walked on, but the bridge was still solid. "He must have locked the arrows together better this time", thought the monkey to himself. He began to jump on the bridge but it did not collapse. It stayed strong. The monkey was surprised. "Let me take on the form I took while leaping across the ocean", he thought and lo! He was large as a mountain now. Arjuna was awestruck when he saw that his challenger was none other than the great Hanuman himself. He bowed his head in reverence, realizing that sooner or later his bridge would succumb to the strength of the great monkey. He was humbled. The bridge did not collapse. Not even under the weight of the now gigantic Hanuman. Arjuna was nonplussed. He could not comprehend what was happening. There seemed to be no logical explanation as to why the bridge hadn't broken yet. Apparently, [[Hanuman]] couldn't fathom things either. He began jumping on the bridge but it still wouldn't yield. All the while the boy was smiling. In a moment of enlightenment, it struck both participants of the contest that their adjudicator was no ordinary boy. Arjuna and [[Hanuman]] fell at his feet and then [[Vishnu]] was standing before them. "I am [[Rama]], and I am [[Krishna]]. I protected your bridge from collapsing, Arjuna. Vanity and pride undo the best of men. Dear [[Hanuman]], you should have known better than to humiliate Arjuna thus. He is a fine warrior, one of the best of his times. How could you drive him into giving up his life?" Arjuna and [[Hanuman]] sought the Lord's forgiveness and He blessed them. "As an act of remorse, I shall stabilize and protect your chariot in the great battle that is imminent.", said [[Hanuman]]. "So be it. You shall be present on the banner of Arjuna's chariot when he rides out to do battle in the great war of his age that is to come."&lt;ref&gt;http://talesfrommythology.blogspot.com/2011/03/hanuman-in-mahabharata.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reaching Dwarka and Subhadra ===

[[File:Ravi Varma-Arjuna and Subhadra.jpg|thumb|Painting of Arjuna and Subhadra by [[Raja Ravi Varma]]]]

Arjuna moved to other Tirthas, including the southern regions in [[Kerala]]. Finally he reached [[Dwarka]], the place where his cousin [[Krishna]] resided. Arjuna had, in his childhood, heard about Krishna's sister, [[Subhadra]]. Krishna, wishing to further tie their families, knew of Arjuna's visit and devised a plan to arrange their meeting. Accordingly, Arjuna disguised himself as a [[Yati]] and stayed at Krishna's palace. Arjuna was attracted to Subhadra and desired to marry her, Krishna understood Arjuna's intention and advised him to kidnap Subhadra then Arjuna kidnapped Subhadra and married with her. After this Balarama became furious upon learning of the abduction but was pacified by Vasudeva, his father, because Lord Krishna knew that whole Dwarka warriors can not defeat Arjuna alone as Arjun was invicible and undefeatable in battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m01/m01223.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 1: Adi Parva: Subhadra-harana Parva: Section CCXXII|website=www.sacred-texts.com|access-date=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple stayed in Dwaraka for a year, and then another year in Pushkar. However, Draupadi had made it clear that no other Pandava wife would be allowed to stay in her city, so Arjuna, as Krishna had advised, tricked Draupadi into meeting Subhadra as a milkmaid. Draupadi realized she had been tricked, but she forgave Subhadra and let her stay in [[Indraprastha]], allowing her to keep company with Arjuna in the four years when he was not with Draupadi. In due course, the union of Arjuna and Subhadra produced a son, Abhimanyu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m01/m01223.htm|title=Mahabharata Text}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m01/m01224.htm|title=Mahabharata Text}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Krishna-Arjuna war ==

Gaya, a Gandharva king, while moving across the skies, spits the pan down his divine plane. It falls into the open palms of Sri [[Krishna]], offering prayers to Sun god [[Surya]]. [[Sri Krishna]] gets very angry and vows to kill him. Gaya is a great devotee of [[Krishna]]. Krishna could not take back his vow. [[Narada]] advises Gaya to approach Arjuna and first seek his assurance of protecting him, before revealing about the person set to take his life. As per Narada's advice, the king takes Arjuna's promise for his protection before revealing Krishna's vow to kill him. Arjuna, though surprised, sticks to his word to Gaya. Both Arjuna and [[Krishna]] feel very sad about the situation that each of them is going to fight against the most beloved ones. Any number of dialogues between both sides makes no dent in the situation. Intervention of [[Subhadra]], Narada, [[Rukmini]], [[Satyabhama]] and others fail resulting in direct combat.
War breaks-out and [[Krishna]] v/s Arjuna archery-duel starts. Both of them go into fierce fight. The weapons and astras used by both cause heavy destruction. Because Krishna had Kodanda and Arjuna had [[Gandiva]]. Both are undefeatable and none of them gets injured. Finally Krishna uses Sudarshana chakra &amp; Arjuna uses Brahmastra. Lord [[Shiva]] appears before them and asks them to withdraw their respective destructive weapons to prevent disaster to the world. Krishna explained the intention behind fighting against Arjuna. Many of people including [[Balarama]] complained that Krishna was partial to Pandavas. Through this he proved that he was not partial to any-one but to justice. Also he meant that Krishna &amp; Arjuna were equal &amp; the same. He meant that Pandavas were right followers of justice, Arjuna being the most sincere person and that's the reason why he loved them and especially Arjuna very much.&lt;ref&gt;"Gayopakhyanam" written by Chilakamarti Lakshmi Narasimham&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conquest for Rajasuya ==
[[File:Arjuna for Rajasuya Yaga.jpg|thumb|Arjuna on his way to the Rajasuya Yaga]]
[[File:PathRajasuyaArjunaDigvijaya.jpg|thumb|Possible route taken by Arjuna for the Rajasuya sacrifice]]

Arjuna was sent south by [[Yudhishthira]] to subjugate kingdoms for the [[Rajasuya|Rajasuya Yagya]], so that he could be crowned [[Emperor]] of [[Indraprastha]]. The Mahabharata mentions several kingdoms to the north of Indraprastha which were conquered (or otherwise peacefully [[genuflection|bent-the-knee]]) by Arjuna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m02/m02027.htm|title=Mahabharata Text}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this conquest Arjuna had conquered Northern kurus which was the territory of Lord Indra,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m02/m02027.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 2: Sabha Parva: Jarasandhta-badha Parva: Section XXVII|website=www.sacred-texts.com|access-date=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was really the difficult feats for any warrior but Arjuna easily achieved many feats in Rajasuya conquest.

== Exile ==

After [[Yudhishthira]] succumbed to [[Shakuni]]'s challenge in the [[Pachisi|game of dice]], the [[Pandavas]] were forced to be in [[exile]] for 13 years, which included one year in anonymity.

=== Fight with Chitrasena ===

After Pandavas lost in dice game and went on for exile, [[Duryodhana]] planned to humiliate Pandavas by showing them the luxuries enjoyed by all Kauravas and [[Karna]]. So all of them had set to forest where Pandavas were living. In the course of Journey [[Duryodhana]] abducted a lady without knowing that she was a Gandharva. Then Gandharvas attacked entire Kauravas and [[Karna]]. [[Karna]] tried to run away from battle after getting defeated by Chitrasena,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03239.htm|title=Karna fled from Chitrasena|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At last Gandharvas captured all the Kauravas and Karna. On knowing this [[Yudhishtira]] asks Arjuna to free them since its Hastinapur which would be insulted. Arjuna followed his eldest brother’s order and defeated [[Chitrasena]]. During the fight with Chitrasena, Arjuna had performed extremely impossible feats as he killed 10 lakh Gandharvas(4.5 akshouni) in single shot by using Agneyastra.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03243.htm|title=Arjuna killed 1 million Gandharvas in single shot|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from Arjuna, no warrior ever achieved this impossible feats even in dream. Immediately Chitrasena granted Sammohana astra to Arjuna after being impressed by Arjuna's bravery &amp; warrior skills.

=== Penance for Pashupatastra ===

[[File:Kiratarjuniya.jpg|thumb|left|From the epic poem [[Kiratarjuniya]]: Arjuna recognizes Shiva and surrenders to him. Painting by [[Raja Ravi Varma]], 19th century.]]

After the battle at Khandava [[Indra]] had promised Arjuna to give him all his weapons as a boon for matching him in battle with the requirement that Shiva is pleased with him. Following the advice of [[Yudhishtira]] to go on a meditation or "tapasya" to attain this [[Astra (weapon)|divine weapon]], Arjuna left his brothers for a penance.

Arjuna traveled for a while before reaching the mountain [[Kanaka Durga Temple#Description|Indra keeladri, Vijayawada]]. Here he sat in meditation in the name of Lord Shiva. Arjuna managed to please Lord Shiva by his severe penance in just months because his penance generated so much intense heat that was unbearable to all living creatures of earth which ultimately forced Lord Shiva to come to earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03038.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 3: Vana Parva: Kairata Parva: Section XXXVIII|website=www.sacred-texts.com|access-date=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shiva appeared soon enough in the guise of a [[hunter]], who challenged Arjuna to a fight. In that fierce battle even 8 forms of Lord Shiva failed to defeat Arjuna,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03049.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 3: Vana Parva: Indralokagamana Parva: Section XLIX|website=www.sacred-texts.com|access-date=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; At last Arjuna gratified Mahadeva in battle by showing his prowess then Hunter(Shiva) transformed himself to show his real avatar and blessed Arjuna with the [[Pashupatastra]]. Shiva lectures Arjuna on the abilities of the weapon, as well as the judgement he must use while wielding it. It is said that, apart from Lord Shiva and Arjuna no one possessed Pasupata weapon which was capable to destroy whole world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03040.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 3: Vana Parva: Kairata Parva: Section XL|website=www.sacred-texts.com|access-date=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visit to heaven ===

After Shiva left, the [[Lokapalas]] appeared before Arjuna and then [[Kubera]], [[Yama]], and [[Varuna]] also blessed each of their potent weapons to Arjuna. Indra then invited his son to his palace in [[Svarga|heaven]].

Arjuna was amazed at the splendor of his father's palace at [[Amaravati (mythology)|Amaravati]]. Dancers like [[Urvashi]], [[Tilottama]], [[Rambha (apsara)|Rambha]] and [[Menaka]] entertained him. There was a huge banquet serving different varieties of heavenly dishes. Arjuna learnt song and [[bharatnatyam|dance]] from the Gandharva, [[Chitrasena (Mahabharata)|Chitrasena]] and Indra himself taught him all the [[Astra (weapon)|divine weapons]] and also gave him his [[Vajra]]. All other divine gods also gave their celestial astras to Arjuna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03044.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 3: Vana Parva: Indralokagamana Parva: Section XLIV|publisher=|accessdate=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nivata-kavachas and Hiranyapura ===

Arjuna got the opportunity to test his skill when Indra asked him to defeat his enemy as the price of his training. Arjuna was taken to the palace of the Nivata-kavachas, a tribe of [[Asuras]] who had a magnificent palace under the oceans. Arjuna used the Mohini-astra and the Madhava-astra to demolish these asuras.

He was also taken to Hiranyapura, a palace in the sky created by a witch Puloma and his asura tribe of the Kalakanjas. Here Arjuna uses the Raudra-astra and annihilates the demons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03172.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 3: Vana Parva: Tirtha-yatra Parva: Section CLXXII|publisher=|accessdate=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== At Virata's Kingdom ===
[[File:Brihannala.jpg|thumb|left|Brihannala – [[Eunuch]] at Virata's Kingdom]]

{{main|Brihannala}}

Along with his brothers, Arjuna spent his last year of exile in the [[Matsya Kingdom|kingdom of Matsya]]. This is the place where Urvashi's curse is implemented and Arjuna becomes a [[eunuch]] called [[Brihannala]] (within themselves Pandavas called him Vijaya).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kapoor|first=edited by Subodh|title=The Indian encyclopaedia : biographical, historical, religious, administrative, ethnological, commercial and scientific|year=2002|publisher=Cosmo Publications|location=New Delhi|isbn=9788177552577|page=4462|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the palace, he teaches song and [[bharatnatyam|dance]], qualities he had learnt from [[Chitrasena (Mahabharata)|Chitrasena]] [King of the Gandharvas in Devalok], to the [[Virata|King Virata's]] daughter, [[Uttarā (Mahabharata)|Uttarā]]. Later, Arjuna arranges for Uttara to become his daughter-in-law by marrying his son [[Abhimanyu]] to her. At the same time, he prevents [[Subhadra]] from marrying Abhimanyu to [[Balarama]]'s daughter [[Vatsala]], as the [[Kuru Kingdom|Kurus]] find marriages between cousins [[taboo]]. But Arjuna and Subhadra are cousins too since Kunti (Arjun's Mother) and Vasudeva (Subhadra's father) are brother and sister.

Hearing about the death of Kichaka, Duryodhana surmises that the Pandavas were hiding in Matsya. A host of Kaurava warriors attack Virata, presumably to steal their cattle, but in reality, desiring to pierce the Pandavas' veil of anonymity. Full of bravado, Virata's son Uttar attempts to take on the army by himself while the rest of the Matsya army has been lured away to fight Susharma and the Trigartas. As suggested by Draupadi, Uttar takes Brihannala with him, as his charioteer. When he sees the Kaurava army, Uttar loses his nerve and attempts to flee. There, Arjuna reveals his identity and those of his brothers'. Switching places with Uttar, Arjuna takes up the Gandiva and Devadatta. Eager to defend the land that had given him refuge, Arjuna engaged the legion of Kaurava warriors. All the warriors including Bhisma, Drona, Karna, Kripa and Ashwthama together attacked Arjuna to kill him but Arjuna defeated all of them multiple times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m04/m04061.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 4: Virata Parva: Go-harana Parva: Section LXI|website=www.sacred-texts.com|access-date=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== [[Abhimanyu]]'s marriage ==

Arjuna saved Matsya kingdom from Kurus and brought back all the cattle, sheep etc. As a gratitude Virata king offered his daughter to Arjuna. Arjuna replied Virata king gently that he had taught dance to [[Uttarā (Mahabharata)|Uttara]]. So he was a teacher to Uttara, a teacher treat a student as a child but not as a spouse. Arjuna suggested Virata King to marry Uttara to his son [[Abhimanyu]]. Virata king was very much pleased with this offer. In some versions, it is also said that [[Abhimanyu]] and Uttara were already in love as [[Abhimanyu]] already met Uttara while he was in search of his parents who were in exile. This was noticed by [[Draupadi]] and [[Yudhishtira]]. Everybody in Dwaraka agreed Arjuna's proposal and soon [[Balarama]] with his wife; [[Krishna]] with [[Rukmini]]; Arjuna, [[Subhadra]] and [[Abhimanyu]] reached Matsya kingdom. [[Abhimanyu]] married Uttara very soon; four months before the commencement of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mahabharataonline.com/translation/mahabharata_04071.php|title=King Virata offered his daughter Uttara to Arjuna|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the war on one day; [[Krishna]] took a promise from Arjuna that Arjuna won't use any divine weapons obtained in heaven. Thus Arjuna fought war without using celestial weapons granted by Lord [[Indra]] and other divine gods.

== Kurukshetra War ==

=== Bhagavad Gita ===
[[File:Bhagvad Gita.jpg|thumb|Arjuna and Lord Krishna, with Krishna as the [[sarathi]] or charioteer]]

{{main| Bhagavad Gita }}

As the battle draws close, Arjuna is overcome with self-doubt about the righteousness of the war against his own kith and kin. He is distraught at the thought of having to fight with his friends and family such as his dear teacher, [[Drona]] and grandsire Bhishma. It was then that Krishna took charge and explained the necessity and inevitability of the war to Arjuna. This conversation is a key part of the Mahabharata known as Bhagavad gita, and is considered as a holy scripture of [[Hinduism]].

Arjuna plays the role of the reader in the Bhagavad Gita. As Krishna dispenses the advice, Arjuna asks the questions.The [[Bhagavad Gita]] primarily takes the form of philosophical dialogue between Prince Arjuna and [[Krishna]].

=== Battles fought at Kurukshetra ===

[[File:Death of Jayadratha.jpg|thumb|Defeat of Jayadratha]]

Arjuna was a key Pandava warrior and played a huge role in the Pandava victory in the Kurukshetra war. Lord [[Hanuman]] stayed on Arjuna’s chariot flag.

Some of the crucial battles fought by Arjuna are as follows:
* '''Fall of [[Bhishma]]''': According to original Mahabharat Arjuna fairly killed [[Bhishma]] on 10th day of kuru war, Shikhandi does not have any role in the matter, though as per one narrative it is Shikhandi who killed [[Bhishma]].
* '''Death of [[Bhagadatta]]''': On the 12th day of the war, Arjuna killed Bhagadatta.
* '''Killing of the Trigartas''': On 17th day of war, Arjuna killed all the Trigartas.
* '''Death of Jayadratha''': Arjuna held [[Jayadratha]] responsible for [[Abhimanyu]]'s death on the 13th day of the war. He vowed to kill him the very next day before sunset, failing which he would kill himself by jumping in a pyre.The [[Kauravas]] hid Jayadratha from Arjuna in a formation, knowing that Arjuna's death would result in a Kaurava victory.  Finally Arjuna defeated all protector of Jaydratha including [[Karna]] and [[Ashwatthama]] and beheaded Jayadratha and made his arrows to carry away [[Jayadratha]]'s head.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m07/m07141.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 7: Drona Parva: Jayadratha-Vadha Parva: Section CXLIV|website=www.sacred-texts.com|access-date=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was because Jayadratha had a boon from his father that whoever would be responsible for his head falling to the ground would have his own head blown up. That is why Arjuna carried the severed head of Jayadratha to his father, who was awoken from his meditation by the sudden landing of a severed head on his body and since he ended up dropping it to the ground, he had his head blown up.{{Clear}}&lt;ref name="test169"&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m07/m07142.htm Kisori Mohan Ganguly translation of Mahabharat P-321] Drona Parv, Chapter 146&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Death of [[Karna]]''': The battle between the two continued fiercely. Finally Arjuna killed [[Karna]] on 17th day using [[Anjalikastra]].

== Conquest for Ashvamedha ==

After the conclusion of the war, the Pandavas take charge of Hastinapura, the undivided realm of their ancestors. Yudhishira appointed Arjuna as the Yuvaraj of [[Hastinapura]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m12/m12a041.htm|title=Mahabharata Text}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Yudhishthira decided to hold the [[Ashvamedha]] Yagna, or "horse sacrifice", to grant them the title of ''Chakravarti'' ("Emperor"). Arjuna led the armed forces which followed the horse around its random wanderings. He received the submission of many kings, either without or following an armed confrontation. He was thus instrumental in the expansion of the Pandava domains. Arjuna was the only warrior who alone conquered the whole world in Mahabharat, Apart from Arjuna, no warrior ever achieved this feat. In the [[Ashvamedha]] Yagna, the horse was stopped by [[Babruvahana]]. He defeated [[Bhima]] and killed [[Vrishaketu]] without knowing that they are his relatives and he was the son of Arjuna. Arjuna fought with [[Babruvahana]] and went on upper hand since Arjuna was invincible. Arjuna defeated [[Babruvahana]] &amp; went to collect his horse. [[Babruvahana]], out of guilt, used the divine weapon (given by Goddess river Ganga) to kill Arjuna when Arjuna was unarmed. This divine weapon would kill any person even monstrous demons. Soon Arjuna got killed and the news reached [[Chitrāngadā]]. She scolded him and revealed the truth that he was the son of Arjuna. With the help of [[Ulupi]], Arjuna’s life was restored by a gem called Nagamani. Arjuna was very impressed with his son’s bravery.

Arjuna built the [[Aranmula Parthasarathy Temple]] during his conquest in South India. [[Aranmula Parthasarathy Temple]] is one of the "[[Divya Desams]]", the 108 temples of [[Vishnu]] revered by the 12 poet saints, or [[Alwars]]&lt;ref&gt;''108 Vaishnavite Divya Desams: Divya desams in Malai Nadu and Vada Nadu''. M. S. Ramesh, Tirumalai-Tirupati Devasthanam.&lt;/ref&gt; located near [[Aranmula]], a village in [[Pathanamthitta District]], [[Kerala]], [[South India]].

== Death ==
[[File:Arjuna throws his weapons in water as advised by Agni.jpg|thumb|Arjuna throws his weapons in water as advised by Agni]]

After Sri Krishna left his mortal body, Arjuna took the citizens of Dwaraka, including 16,100 wives of Krishna, to Indraprastha. On the way, they were attacked by a group of bandits. Arjuna desisted fighting seeing the law of time.

Upon the onset of the [[Kali yuga]] and acting on the advice of [[Vyasa]], Arjuna and other [[Pandavas]] retired, leaving the throne to their only descendant to survive the war of [[Kurukshetra]], Arjuna's grandson [[Parikshit]]. Giving up all their belongings and ties, the Pandavas, accompanied by a [[dog]], made their final journey of pilgrimage to the [[Himalayas]]. It is also to be noted that the listener of the Mahabharata is [[Janamejaya II|Janamejaya]], Parikshit's son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Bowker|first=John|title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions|encyclopedia=[[Oxford Reference]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2000|doi=10.1093/acref/9780192800947.001.0001|subscription=yes}} {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Except for [[Yudhishthira]], all of the Pandavas grew weak and died before reaching [[Swarga|heaven]] (only Yudhishthira is allowed to keep his mortal body). Arjuna was the fourth one to fall after Draupadi, Sahadeva and Nakula. When [[Bhima]] asks Yudhishthira why Arjuna isn't permitted the same, the reason given is Arjuna's over confidence in his skills. [[Draupadi]] also falls because while she claimed to love all the Pandavas equally, she had a soft spot for Arjuna . Bhima was the fifth to fall after Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva. The reason why Bhima fell is because he enjoyed the sufferings of other people. People may cause suffering sometimes, but not allowed to enjoy them. Nakula fell because he liked his appearance a lot instead of being royal. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m17/m17002.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 17: Mahaprasthanika Parva: Section 2|work=sacred-texts.com|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==

Arjuna is a popular choice of name for a [[Hindu]] male child in the Indian subcontinent. As told in the verses in [[Harivamsha]] or Harivamsha Purana, the name Arjuna is cursed by the sage [[Parashurama]]. After the defeat of the mighty and evil king [[Kartavirya Arjuna]] or otherwise called Sahasra Arjuna, Sage [[Parashurama]] pronounced the curse that whoever holds the name ''Arjuna'' will never become a king and always be a servant of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ramachandrashastri|first=K.S|title=Harivamsha|year=1936|publisher=Chitrashala Press|location=Pune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Todor Kableshkov2.jpg|thumbnail|Todor Kableshkov, author]]
[[File:Stone with the Blood letter from Kableshkov.JPG|thumbnail|A monument to the letter in Koprivshtitsa, near its place of writing.]]
The '''Bloody Letter''' ({{lang-bg|Кърваво писмо}}) is a letter written by Bulgarian revolutionary [[Todor Kableshkov]] which is symbolically accepted to be the start of the anti-[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[April Uprising]] of 1876.

Kableshkov writes this letter upon proclaiming the revolt in his home city of [[Koprivshtitsa]] and addresses it to the revolutionary committee of [[Panagyurishte]] and specifically to [[Georgi Benkovski]]. The letter's name comes from the fact that it is signed with the blood of a local Ottoman governor (''müdür''), shortly after he was killed by revolutionary Georgi Tihanek. It was transported by 19-year-old Georgi Salchev for a record time of 2 hours, having his horse passing out just before reaching Panagyurishte because of the strain.

According to ''Memoirs of the Bulgarian Uprisings'' by [[Zahari Stoyanov]], the letter's contents were:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Brothers!

Yesterday Neceb Aga arrived in our village from [[Plovdiv]], and asked to imprison some people, including me. When I heard about your decision, made at the [[Oborishte locality|Council of Oborishte]], I called up some brave men and after we got armed, we headed towards the [[Konak (residence)|konak]] and attacked it, killing the [[governor|müdür]] and some [[Zaptié|policemen]]... Now, as I am writing this letter, the flag is waving before the konak, rifles shoot and the church bells echo simultaneously with them, men are kissing one another on the streets... If you, brothers, happen to be true patriots and apostles of Freedom, then do follow our example in Panagyurishte...

Koprivshtitsa, 20th April ([[old style]]) 1876
T. Kableshkov

I was witness as all events mentioned above in Todor's letter happened. Leaving for [[Klisura (Bulgaria)|Klisura]], to do the same.

N. Karadzhov

The '''Castleton Jail''' is an exhibit building located at the [[Shelburne Museum]] in [[Shelburne, Vermont]], USA. Constructed entirely of slate, it was originally built in 1890 in Castleton, Vermont, where it operated for over fifty years.&lt;ref name="shelburnemuseum.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shelburnemuseum.org/buildings_and_grounds/detail.php?id=13 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612025828/http://www.shelburnemuseum.org/buildings_and_grounds/detail.php?id=13 |archivedate=2009-06-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Castleton==
Castleton was chartered in 1761. The charter for {{convert|36|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}} of land was granted by Gov. Benning Wentworth of New Hampshire and divided the land into 70 "rights" or "shares". Three families had settled in Castleton by 1770. More settlers followed and by 1777 the town consisted of 17 families. Vermont attained statehood in 1791 and Castleton continued to grow as an agricultural community. Farmers raised cattle, then turned for a while to sheep. Apple orchards abounded. Saw mills and gristmills were the first industries to be established in town. During the middle of the nineteenth century the slate and marble industries began to thrive in and around Castleton. The railroad came in 1854, and the last half of the century saw the development of tourism around Lake Bomoseen.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bsi-vt.com/castleton/chs/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; For more see [[Castleton, Vermont]]

==Construction==
The jail building’s unusual composition reflects the richness of Vermont’s geological deposits. In the early 19th century, Vermonters discovered beds of [[slate]] that stretched from the state’s western edge to New York’s eastern borders. These massive deposits gave birth to a healthy mining industry that still extracts the grey, sea green, and red material.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anr.state.vt.us/dec/geo/vtgeofom.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The nature of [[slate]], with its geologically formed horizontal bedding, causes it to fracture along flat lines and, unlike [[granite]] and [[marble]], slate cannot be undercut or sculpted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geology.csupomona.edu/alert/metamorphic/slate.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010430173432/http://geology.csupomona.edu/alert/metamorphic/slate.htm |archivedate=2001-04-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently its use as an art material has been minimal. Despite these limitations, the architect of the Castleton Jail took advantage of the planar formation of slate in constructing the jail, layering pieces of slate horizontally to form the exterior walls, and floors. The dark interior consists of two cells and a jailor’s compartment with only a single window to admit light and air. A riveted iron door completes this impregnable structure.&lt;ref name="shelburnemuseum.org"/&gt;

==History==
In 1953, [[Shelburne Museum]] purchased the fifty-ton jail from the town of Castleton for one dollar per [[ton]]. Only the roof and gable ends were removed for the journey of {{convert|64|mi|km|0}} to Shelburne. Special dollies with twenty-four rubber-tired wheels were built to carry the basic structure and demanded additional steering apparatuses and four sets of brakes to maintain control on steep hills. The move, aided by the Vermont State Police, required three days at speeds varying from up to {{convert|7|mph|km/h|0}}. The most difficult obstacle was the Vergennes underpass of the Rutland Railroad, where the clearance was only five inches.&lt;ref&gt;Shelburne Museum. 1993.

[[File:Climber reading guidebook.jpg|thumb|Consulting the guidebook]]

'''Climbing guidebooks''' are used by rock [[Climbing|climbers]] to find the location of climbing routes at crags or on mountains. Many guidebooks also offer condensed information about local restaurants, bars and camping areas; often include sections on geology and local climbing history; and may contain many pictures to inspire climbers. Guidebooks may range in size from pamphlets detailing dozens of routes up to tomes that document thousands of routes. The library of the [[American Alpine Club]] contains over 20,000 books and videos, a majority of which are such guidebooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanalpineclub.org/p/library |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313063837/http://www.americanalpineclub.org/p/library |archivedate=2015-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Alps the [[Alpine Club Guide]] series is very comprehensive.

==Route descriptions==
Guidebooks can indicate locations by verbal descriptions (for example" ''start in the third left-facing corner below the large, orange roof, left of the route "Something Interesting"''). Starting in the 1980s, a diagram-style was developed, with the detailed diagrams of the routes, called "[[topo (climbing)|topos]]" (probably from French).

Route descriptions typically include information about the length of a route and its [[grade (climbing)|grade]] (difficulty). The description can also include varying amounts of information about how to climb the route, such as the location of the [[Crux (climbing)|crux]], special techniques needed, and amount and type of [[rock-climbing equipment|gear]] needed. When this information is very detailed it is collectively known as ''beta''. In a definitive guide, the route's history (credits for [[first ascent]]s etc.) would also be included.

==Publication==
[[File:Arapiles_new_route_update.pdf|thumb|left|New routes update for [[Mount Arapiles]], Australia]]
Guidebooks may be compilations of selected popular routes, or exhaustive references. They may be published by national/regional mountaineering bodies, commercial publishers, or self-published by local enthusiasts. They are almost always sold in climbing shops near the areas described (or in general shops in areas too small for a climbing shop), but are also often distributed internationally.

As climbing areas develop, it is usually necessary to publish new editions of guidebooks every several years. In the interim, "new routes" updates are published, either as printed booklets or online.

In recent years, many climbing guidebooks have been published in digital format, often for display in [[smartphone]] applications. This medium offers the benefit of frequent or continuous updates, as well as rapid searching, and even, in some cases, GPS navigation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rakkup.com/navigation-turn-by-turn/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Climbing guidebooks are important to the culture of climbing, transmitting history and stories down through the ages, and delineating what is considered good style in a particular area. The upcoming publication of a new guidebook of the area often leads to a flurry of climbers establishing new routes there (because one can clearly see the parts of rock terrain which are still unclimbed).

The '''comics page''' of a daily [[newspaper]] is a page largely or entirely devoted to [[comic strips]].

==Summary==
Other features that frequently appear on the comics page are [[crossword puzzle]]s and [[horoscope]]s. Other special pages in newspapers include the [[sports page]] and the [[society page]].

Some well known comics in the comics page is Garfield, The very first superman comics, and classics such as peanuts. The comic page was also used occasionally used to spread propaganda such as Korea My Home  

Many issues such as [[sex]], [[narcotics]] and [[terrorism]] cannot or can very rarely be openly discussed in strips, although there are exceptions, usually for [[satire]], as in ''Bloom County''. This led some cartoonists to resort to [[double entendre]] or dialogue children do not understand, as in [[Greg Evans (cartoonist)|Greg Evans]]' ''[[Luann (comic strip)|Luann]]''. Young cartoonists have claimed commonplace words, images and issues should be allowed in the comics. Some of the taboo words and topics are mentioned daily on television and other forms of visual media. Web comics and comics distributed primarily to college newspapers are much freer in this respect.

Violence on the comics page is generally kept to a fantasy level. While [[black eye]]s and bandages covering wounds can be shown, the shedding of blood itself is prohibited in North American comic strips. Only the aftermath of [[domestic violence|spousal abuse]] is shown; the violent act itself is never shown on the comics pages. Most comics are episodic; with each storyline lasting for 3-5 days before being dropped in favor of a new storyline.

A [[desktop environment]] is a collection of software designed to give functionality and a certain [[look and feel]] to an [[operating system]].

This article applies to [[operating system]]s which are capable of running the [[X Window System]], mostly [[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] operating systems such as [[Linux]], [[Minix]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], [[IBM AIX|AIX]], [[FreeBSD]] and [[Mac OS X]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xfree86.org/ XFree86 Official Website] line 5&lt;/ref&gt; [[Microsoft Windows]] is incapable of natively running X applications; however, third-party X servers like [[Cygwin/X]], [[Hummingbird Ltd.|Exceed]], or [[Xming]] are available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://x.cygwin.com/ Cygwin/X website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sourceforge.net/projects/xming Xming project homepage on SourceForge]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technical elements of a desktop environment ==
{{see also|Elements of graphical user interfaces}}
A [[desktop environment]] (DE) can be broken up into several components that function independently and interact with one another to provide the look and feel and functionality of the desktop environment. A fundamental part of a DE is the [[window manager]] or WM. A window manager creates a certain way for application windows to present themselves to the user. It manages the various application windows, keeping track of which ones are open and providing features to switch between them. Another important element of a DE is the [[file manager]]. This application manages files/ folders and presents them in a way that the user finds convenient. It provides file operations like viewing, copying or moving, changing [[File system permissions|permissions]] and deleting. DEs usually provide utilities to set wallpapers and screensavers, display icons on the desktop, and perform some administrative tasks. They may optionally include word processors, CD/DVD writing applications, web browsers and e-mail clients.

There are some exceptions: Window managers like [[Fluxbox]], [[wmii]] and [[Ratpoison]] operate independently of a desktop environment and were written with this objective in mind. Additional hand-picked applications add functionality such as a panel and volume management which gives them some of the qualities of a full DE. This contrasts the behaviour of WMs like [[Metacity]] and [[KWin]] which were not written with the objective of operating independently of a DE.

[[KDE Software Compilation]] and [[GNOME]] are written almost completely on special [[software library|software libraries]] [[Qt (toolkit)|Qt]] and [[GTK+]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Official websites of [http://www.gnome.org GNOME] and [http://kde.org KDE]&lt;/ref&gt; This usually means that virtually every component of the desktop environment including the [[file manager]] explicitly depends on that library for its functioning.

[[File:X window system desktop environments timeline.svg|thumb|X Window System desktop environments timeline.]]
Notably, nothing prevents the user from installing any number of software libraries of his/her choice. In practice, software written on major libraries can be run under any desktop environment. Running a package designed for one desktop (which essentially means that it's written using the same libraries as the desktop itself is) within a different desktop can be visually displeasing, as well as incurring the RAM penalty of loading libraries that wouldn't otherwise be required.

Some of the differences which can influence the choice of desktop environment are:
* [[Look and feel]] of the desktop environment. The user will be more comfortable with a certain look and feel that he/she may or may not already be familiar with.
* Flexibility and configurability of the desktop environment. A sophisticated user might want a highly configurable desktop environment to make the desktop environment work the way he/she wants. A beginning user might just want an easy-to-use environment to which he/she will adjust.
* Personal preferences for choice of software, which has two aspects:
** Each desktop environment comes packaged with various default software and various "ways things are done" under that desktop. A casual user might like a highly integrated graphical interface to change various settings while a more experienced user might prefer to use individual configuration utilities or even [[Command-line interface|CLI]] tools.
** Desktops are also often closely tied into various major functional components of the desktop manager (example: [[file manager]], [[web browser|browser]], [[word processor]]); whilst "mix and match" is possible, it is generally pleasing to make choices which result in a consistent look and feel of programs under the chosen desktop environment. Making choices based on what software integrates with a chosen desktop environment necessarily limits the weight that can be given to other application features.

=== Comparison of ease of use and stability ===
GNOME's graphical file manager Files (Nautilus) is intended to be very easy to use and has many features.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gnome.org/projects/nautilus/screenshots.html Official Nautilus screenshots page]&lt;/ref&gt; KDE's file manager Dolphin is described as focused on usability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dolphin.kde.org Official Dolphin file manager page on KDE project site]&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to KDE version 4, the KDE project's standard file manager was Konqueror, which was also designed for ease of use.

Both GNOME and KDE come with many graphical configuration tools, reducing the need to manually edit configuration files for new users. They have extensive bundled software such as graphical menu editors, text editors, audio players, and software for doing administrative work. All applications installed in most distributions are automatically added to the GNOME and KDE menus. No major configuration changes are necessary to begin working. However, by using graphical tools, the extent to which the desktops can be configured is determined by the power provided by those tools.
&lt;!--
 TODO: Insert something about EDE, Xfce, Englightenment and ROX desktop 
--&gt;

== Compatibility and interoperability issues ==
Some desktop environments and window managers claim that they support applications made for other desktop environments explicitly. For example, Fluxbox states KDE support in its feature list.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fluxbox.org/ Fluxbox official website] line 15&lt;/ref&gt; Using software made specifically for the desktop environment in use or window manager agnostic software is a way to avoid issues. For software developers, the [[Portland Project]] has released a set of common interfaces that allows applications to integrate across many desktop environments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS7768863113.html Linux leaps toward KDE/GNOME compatibility] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226050357/http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS7768863113.html |date=2008-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 test by [[Phoronix]] with the default installation of [[Ubuntu Linux|Ubuntu]] 10.04 showed that [[LXDE]] 0.5's memory utilization was lower than that of [[Xfce]] 4.6, which in turn was lower than that of [[GNOME]] 2.29, with [[KDE Software Compilation|KDE]] 4.4 using the most RAM compared to the aforementioned desktops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Larabel|first=Michael|title=Phoronix: Power &amp; Memory Usage Of GNOME, KDE, LXDE &amp; Xfce|url=https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=linux_desktop_vitals&amp;num=1|publisher=Phoronix|accessdate=30 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.porteus.org/info/features.html RAM use of LXDE vs Xfce in Porteus again confirms that LXDE is about 1/2 of that of Xfce]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, it was demonstrated in benchmarks that LXDE performed slightly faster than Xfce overall (in the average of all tests), using the Fedora Linux operating system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=fedora-23-desktops&amp;num=2 Phoronix]&lt;/ref&gt;

|Differs from traditional system dynamics approaches in that 1) it puts much greater emphasis on probabilistic simulation techniques to support representation of uncertain and/or stochastic systems; and 2) it provides a wide variety of specialized model objects (beyond stocks, flows and converters) in order to make models less abstract (and hence more transparent) and help represent processes and events that cannot easily be represented using a traditional system dynamics approach. These differences are due to the fact that GoldSim is primarily used for engineering and scientific applications where quantitative probabilistic predictions of future performance are required.

The '''Early English Text Society''' ('''EETS''') is a [[text publication society]] founded in 1864, dedicated to the editing and publication of early English texts, especially those only available in manuscript. Most of its volumes contain editions of [[Middle English]] or [[Old English]] texts. It is known for having been the first to print many important English manuscripts, including [[Cotton Library|Cotton Nero A.x]], which contains ''[[Pearl (poem)|Pearl]]'', ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]'', and other poems.

==History==
[[File:Blickling homilies leaf 141.png|thumb|left|A page of the [[Blickling Homilies]] in facsimile, as reproduced in ''The Blickling Homilies of the Tenth Century: from the Marquis of Lothian's unique MS A.D. 971'', edited and translated by [[Richard Morris (philology)|Richard Morris]], EETS o.s. vols 58, 63, 73 (1874–80)]]
The Society was founded in England in 1864 by [[Frederick James Furnivall]]. Its stated goal in a report of its first year of existence was, "on the one hand, to print all that is most valuable of the yet unprinted {{abbr|MSS.|manuscripts}} in English, and, on the other, to re-edit and reprint all that is most valuable in printed English books, which from their scarcity or price are not within the reach of the student of moderate means."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=4 Nov 2005 |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/17000/17000-h/17000-h.htm#report |title=Report of the Committee, January, 1865 |publisher=Project Gutenberg |accessdate=17 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As of 2016, the Society had published 347 volumes in its Original Series; 126 volumes in its Extra Series, published between 1867 and 1935, comprising texts previously printed, but only in unsatisfactory or rare editions; and 25 volumes in its Supplementary Series, an occasional and irregular series initiated in 1970. The Society keeps the majority of its older publications in print, excepting only those which have been superseded by subsequent editions in its own series. Volumes are now published on behalf of the Society by [[Oxford University Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~eets/list-of-all-publications-2015.pdf |title=List of Publications 2015 |publisher=Early English Text Society |accessdate=30 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emblem==

The Society emblem is a modified representation of the Anglo-Saxon [[Alfred Jewel]], incorporating a scroll bearing the name of the Society.

==Notable members==
Notable members of the society when it was formed in 1864 included [[Frederick James Furnivall|Furnivall]] himself, [[Alfred Tennyson]] ([[poet laureate]]), [[Warren de la Rue]] (inventor of the [[lightbulb]]), [[Richard Chenevix Trench]] (Irish ecclesiastic), Stephen Austin (a [[Hertford]]-based printer), Edith Coleridge (granddaughter of [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]), the Rev. [[Richard Morris (philology)|Richard Morris]] (the editor of 12 volumes between 1862 and 1880), and others.

'''Edward Dwelly''' (1864–1939) was an English [[lexicographer]] and genealogist. He created the authoritative [[dictionary]] of [[Scottish Gaelic]], and his work has had an influence on [[Irish language|Irish]] Gaelic lexicography. He also practised as a professional genealogist and published transcripts of many original documents relating to [[Somerset]].

==Biography==
Born in Twickenham, Middlesex, in England, he became interested in Scottish Gaelic after being stationed in Scotland with the army and working with the [[Ordnance Survey]]. He began collecting words at the age of seventeen and was also a keen [[bagpipes|bagpiper]].

He released the dictionary in sections from 1901 onwards and the first full edition of his ''Illustrated Gaelic Dictionary'' in 1911 under the pen name of Eoghann MacDhòmhnaill (Ewen MacDonald) fearing that his work would not be well accepted under his own obviously English name.

He continued collating entries from older dictionaries and also recording thousands of new words, both from publications and from his travels in the Gaelic-speaking parts of Scotland. He illustrated, printed, bound and marketed his dictionary with help from his children and wife Mary McDougall (from [[Kilmadock]]) whom he had married in 1896,&lt;ref name=nls&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nls.uk/catalogues/online/cnmi/inventories/acc12052.pdf |title=Inventory account 12052 |last= |first= |publisher=National Library of Scotland |date=December 2007 |website= |access-date=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; herself a native Gaelic speaker, teaching himself the skills required.

In 1912, Dwelly self-published his ''Compendium of Notes on the Dwelly Family'', a 54-page genealogical work on the Dwelly family from a John Duelye in 1229, mainly covering Britain, but with an American section, and pedigrees and parish register extracts with supporting notes.

He subsequently gained a state pension from Edward VII for his work. In later life, alienated by the attitude of some people in Scotland, both Gaels and non-speakers, he returned to England, leaving behind his great legacy and dying in obscurity.

In 1991, the late Dr Douglas Clyne sourced several manuscripts in the [[National Library of Scotland]] which were published by him as ''Appendix to Dwelly's Gaelic-English Dictionary'', over half of the entries being from "A-to-D" alone but containing additional information not published in Dwelly's lifetime.

His life has been little researched, the best being the biographical introduction by [[Peter Berresford Ellis]] in Clyne's ''Appendix''.

==Edward Dwelly's dictionary==
Dwelly's illustrated Scottish Gaelic dictionary, consisting of well over one thousand pages, was truly a marvellous achievement in its day, particularly in view of the difficult circumstances which he faced in preparing it.  Dwelly was nonetheless eager to express his gratitude to those who assisted him. He particularly expressed his thanks to the recently deceased King [[Edward VII]] for awarding him a [[Civil List]] Pension when only about one half of the dictionary had been published. He wished dearly to have been able to present a copy of his completed dictionary to the King and expressed sadness at the news of the King's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dwelly|2001|p=ii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dwelly also expressed his particular gratitude to his wife for revising proofs and assisting in correspondence as well as advising on many of the translations in addition to many other sacrifices on her part.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dwelly|2001|p=iii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dwelly's preface is of particular interest to the student of Scottish Gaelic, since many of the difficulties which he faced then are also applicable to today's Scottish Gaelic. Scottish Gaelic speakers were generally not taught to read and write in their native language and were therefore unable to provide correct spelling, which created enormous difficulties in preparing the dictionary. Scottish Gaelic speakers were also often reluctant to engage in Scottish Gaelic conversation with students of Scottish Gaelic such as Dwelly, generally preferring to speak to him in English.  Edward often had to pose as a native speaker of Scottish Gaelic in order to obtain the opportunity to further his knowledge and understanding of colloquial Scottish Gaelic.&lt;ref&gt;Wmffre, Ivan. "Ideology and the learning of Celtic languages", in Mugnaini, Fabio; Ó Héalaí, Pádraig; and Thompson, Tok (eds.), ''The past in the present: A multidisciplinary approach'', pp. 240–41. Italy: ed.it. {{ISBN|88-89726-01-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dwelly's dictionary contains over 70,000 entries and is widely regarded as the most comprehensive dictionary of the Scottish Gaelic language compiled to date. So far, there have been over 12 printed editions (1920, 1930, 1941, 1949, 1967, 1971, 1973, 1977, 1988, 1993 and 2011) of the dictionary by various publishers.&lt;ref&gt;Dwelly, Edward ''Faclair Gàidhlig agus Beurla le dealbhan'' (2011) Akerbeltz {{ISBN|978-1-907165-02-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dwelly, Edward ''Faclair Gàidhlig gu Beurla le Dealbhan/The Illustrated [Scottish] Gaelic- English Dictionary'' (1993, 10th edition) Birlinn Limited {{ISBN|0-901771-92-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digitisation of Dwelly==
Making Dwelly available digitally, so it could be searched both as a Gaelic-English and an English-Gaelic dictionary was an often heard request from Gaelic speakers, learners and enthusiasts. Due to a change in [[copyright law]] and various other complications, it eventually took a German learner of Scottish Gaelic, [[Michael Bauer (linguist)|Michael Bauer]], over 10 years to complete the digitisation. It was finally launched online in co-operation with [[Will Robertson]], a software engineer from [[Perthshire]], in January 2009 under the name Dwelly-d (short for ''Dwelly digiteach'' "Digital Dwelly").&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/alba/naidheachdan/story/2009/01/090116_dwelly.shtml "Dwelly air a thionndadh 's ga chur air loidhne"].

The '''''Encyclopedia of the Consumer Movement''''' is a 1997 [[encyclopedia]] edited by [[Stephen Brobeck]] and which describes the history of the [[consumer movement]] and other topics related to [[consumerism]].

==Synopsis==
The work contains 198 entries written by 168 authors.&lt;ref name="Carsky"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carsky|first=Mary L.|title=Encyclopedia of the Consumer Movement|journal=Journal of Public Policy &amp; Marketing|date=Spring 1999|volume=18|issue=1|pages=130–133|pmid=|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/30000516?uid=3739832}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scope is the history, activities, interests, legislation, and actors in the twentieth century consumer movement.&lt;ref name="Carsky"/&gt; Focuses of the work include 40 articles each describing the consumer movement in a different country, various articles on specific actions undertaken by consumer activists, and descriptions of the interests of specific populations or demographics in the consumer movement.&lt;ref name="Carsky"/&gt;

The authors include established persons from academia, government, activism, and regulatory organizations who wrote entries summarizing their own fields of expertise.&lt;ref name="Apple"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Apple|first=Rima D.|title=Encyclopedia of the Consumer Movement|journal=[[Journal of Consumer Affairs]]|date=Dec 22, 1999|volume=33|issue=2|page=438|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Encyclopedia+of+the+Consumer+Movement.-a064059261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews==
One reviewer called the work "the only comprehensive reference source of its kind."&lt;ref name="Carsky"/&gt; Another said that "In its depth, breadth, scholarship, and readability, this volume will be considered the standard reference source for many years".&lt;ref name="Apple"/&gt;

'''''Ex Parte Bowman''''' 61 [[U.S.P.Q.2d]] 1669 (Bd. Pat. App. &amp; Int. 2001) was a decision by the U.S. [[Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences]] which asserted that in order to be [[patent-eligible]], a process had to involve or promote the technological arts.  This decision was overruled by the Board's subsequent ''[[Ex Parte Lundgren]]'' decision, but the Board's and then the Federal Circuit's [[In re Bilski]] opinion then superseded ''Lundgren''. ''In re Bilski'', however, rejects use of "not in the technological arts" as a basis for a rejection, although it seems to accept the concept when differently named. ''Bilski'' is now pending on writ of [[certiorari]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3489">A '''fixed point of an isometry group''' is a point that is a [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] for every [[isometry]] in the group. For any [[isometry group]] in [[Euclidean space]] the set of fixed points is either empty or an [[affine space]].

For an object, any unique [[centre (geometry)|centre]] and, more generally, any point with unique properties with respect to the object is a fixed point of its [[symmetry group]].

In particular this applies for the [[centroid]] of a figure, if it exists. In the case of a physical body, if for the symmetry not only the shape but also the density is taken into account, it applies to the [[center of mass|centre of mass]].

If the set of fixed points of the symmetry group of an object is a [[singleton (mathematics)|singleton]] then the object has a specific '''centre of symmetry'''. The centroid and centre of mass, if defined, are this point. Another meaning of "centre of symmetry" is a point with respect to which inversion symmetry applies. Such a point needs not be unique; if it is not, there is [[translational symmetry]], hence there are infinitely many of such points. On the other hand, in the cases of e.g. ''C&lt;sub&gt;3h&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' symmetry there is a centre of symmetry in the first sense, but no inversion.

If the symmetry group of an object has no fixed points then the object is infinite and its centroid and centre of mass are undefined.

If the set of fixed points of the symmetry group of an object is a line or plane then the centroid and centre of mass of the object, if defined, and any other point that has unique properties with respect to the object, are on this line or plane.

==1D==
;Line:
:Only the trivial isometry group leaves the whole line fixed.

;Point:
:The groups generated by a reflection leave a point fixed.

==2D==
;Plane:
:Only the trivial isometry group ''C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' leaves the whole plane fixed.

;Line:
:''C''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; with respect to any line leaves that line fixed.

;Point:
:The [[point groups in two dimensions]] with respect to any point leave that point fixed.

==3D==
;Space:
:Only the trivial isometry group ''C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' leaves the whole space fixed.

;Plane:
:''C&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' with respect to a plane leaves that plane fixed.

;Line:
:Isometry groups leaving a line fixed are isometries which in every plane perpendicular to that line have common 2D point groups in two dimensions with respect to the point of intersection of the line and the planes.
:*''C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' ( ''n'' &gt; 1 ) and ''C&lt;sub&gt;nv&lt;/sub&gt;'' ( ''n'' &gt; 1 )

:*cases in which the symmetry group is an infinite subset of that of cylindrical symmetry

;Point:
:All other [[point groups in three dimensions]]

;No fixed points:
:The isometry group contains translations or a screw operation.

==Arbitrary dimension==
;Point:
:One example of an isometry group, applying in every dimension, is that generated by inversion in a point. An n-dimensional [[parallelepiped]] is an example of an object invariant under such an inversion.

'''Fedor Ivanovich Buslaev''' ({{lang-ru|Фёдор Ива́нович Бусла́ев}}; April 25, 1818 – August 12, 1898) was a [[Russian Empire]] [[philologist]], [[art historian]], and folklorist who represented the [[Mythological school]] of [[comparative literature]] and [[comparative linguistics|linguistics]]. He was profoundly influenced by [[Jacob Grimm]] and [[Theodor Benfey]].

Buslaev was educated at [[Penza]] and [[Moscow University]]. At the end of his academical course, 1838, he accompanied the family of [[Stroganovs|Count S.G.&amp;nbsp;Stroganov]] on a tour through [[Italy]], [[Germany]] and [[France]], occupying himself principally with the study of classical antiquities. On his return he was appointed assistant professor of [[Russian literature]] at the [[University of Moscow]].

A study of [[Jacob Grimm]]'s great dictionary had already directed the attention of the young professor to the historical development of the [[Russian language]], and the fruit of his studies was the book ''On the Teaching of the National Language'' ([[Moscow]], 1844 and 1867), which even now has its value. In 1848 he produced his work ''On the Influence of Christianity on the Slavonic Language'', which was considered a milestone in the study of the development of the [[Slavonic language]]s.

In this work Buslaev proves that long before the age of [[Cyril and Methodius]] the Slavonic languages had been subject to [[Christian]] influences. In 1855 he published ''Palaeographical and Philological Materials for the History of the Slavonic Alphabets'', and in 1858 ''Essay Towards an Historical Grammar of the Russian Tongue'', abounding with rich material for students, carefully collected from an immense quantity of ancient records and monuments. In close connection with this work in his ''Historical Chrestomathy of the Church-Slavonic and Old Russian Tongues'' (Moscow, 1861). He was elected a member of the [[St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences]] in 1860.

Buslaev also interested himself in Russian popular poetry and old Russian art, and the result of his labors is enshrined in ''Historical Sketches of Russian Folk Literature and Art'' (St.&amp;nbsp;Petersburg, 1861), a very valuable collection of articles and monographs, in which the author shows himself a worthy and faithful disciple of Grimm. His ''Folk Poetry'' (St.&amp;nbsp;Petersburg, 1887) is a valuable supplement to the ''Sketches''. In 1881 he was appointed professor of Russian literature at Moscow, and three years later published his ''Annotated Apocalypse'' with an atlas of 400&amp;nbsp;plates, illustrative of ancient [[Russian art]].

In his advanced age Buslaev was to a large degree incapacitated by blindness and passed his time in dictating his [[memoirs]] to a secretary. Buslaev's work in the field of [[comparative literature]] was continued by his numerous students, notably [[Alexander Veselovsky]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3036">'''Gerson ben Solomon Catalan''', also known as '''Gerson ben Solomon of Arles''', was a French author who lived at [[Arles]], France in the middle of the thirteenth century. He died, possibly at [[Perpignan]], toward the end of the thirteenth century. According to [[Abraham Zacuto]] and others, he was the father of [[Gersonides|Levi ben Gerson]] (Gersonides).

Catalan compiled, about 1280, an encyclopedia entitled ''Sha'ar ha-Shamayim'' (Door of Heaven), which contains many quotations and even whole treatises from previous translations of works written in Arabic. Following [[Shem-Tov ibn Falaquera]], he divided his work into three parts, dealing respectively with: (1) physics, including natural phenomena, metals, plants, animals, man, and a chapter on dreams; (2) astronomy, taken chiefly from [[Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Kathir al-Farghani|Al-Fargani]] and the ''[[Almagest]]''; and (3) theology or metaphysics, which part, as Catalan expressly says, contains nothing new, but is a copy of [[Maimonides]]' ''Book of the Soul''. The Greek authors cited are [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]], [[Aristotle]], [[Empedocles]], [[Galen]], [[Hippocrates]], [[Homer]], [[Plato]], [[Ptolemy]], [[Pythagoras]], [[Themistius]], and [[Theophrastus]]; the Arabic: [[Ali ibn Abbas al-Magusi]], [[Ali ibn Ridwan]], [[Averroes]], [[Avicenna]], [[Qusta ibn Luqa|Costa ibn Lucca]], [[Al-Farabi]], Al-Fergani, [[Chonain]], [[Isaac Israeli ben Solomon|Isaac Israeli]], [[Ibn Tufail]], and [[Ibn Zuhr]]. The work was published in Venice in 1547 and [[Rödelheim]] in 1801.

An '''Interpol notice''' is an international alert circulated by [[Interpol]] to communicate information about crimes, criminals, and threats by police in a member state (or an authorised international entity) to their counterparts around the world. The information disseminated via notices concerns individuals wanted for serious crimes, missing persons, unidentified bodies, possible threats, prison escapes, and criminals' ''[[modus operandi]]''.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.interpol.int/content/download/786/6291/version/18/file/Factsheets_EN_mars2013_GI02%20web.pdf |title=INTERPOL Fact Sheet – International Notices system |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=January 2012 |publisher=Interpol |format=PDF |accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are eight types of notices, seven of which are colour-coded by their function: Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, Black, Orange, and Purple. The most well-known notice is the Red Notice which is the "closest instrument to an international [[arrest warrant]] in use today".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title9/crm00611.htm |title=Interpol Red Notices |website=[[United States Attorneys' Manual]] |publisher=[[United States Department of Justice]] |accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Orange Notice"&gt;{{cite press release |title=INTERPOL creates new international alert notice |date=24 February 2004 |publisher=Interpol |location=[[Lyon]], [[France]] |url=http://www.interpol.int/News-and-media/News-media-releases/2004/PR004 |accessdate=1 October 2013 |quote=INTERPOL already issues a series of colour-coded notices, including the famous Red Notice for wanted international fugitives}}&lt;/ref&gt; An eighth Special Notice is issued at the request of the [[United Nations Security Council]].

Notices published by Interpol are made either on the organisation's own initiative or are based on requests from National Central Bureaus (NCBs) of member states or authorised international entities such as the [[United Nations]] and the [[International Criminal Court]]. All notices are published on Interpol's secure website. Extracts of notices may also be published on Interpol's public website if the requesting entity agrees.

Interpol may only publish a notice that adheres to all the proper legal conditions. For example, a notice will not be published if it violates Interpol's constitution, which forbids the organisation from undertaking activities of a political, military, religious, or racial character. Interpol may refuse to publish a notice that it considers inadvisable or a potential risk.

Notices may be issued in any of the four official languages of Interpol: [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[Arabic language|Arabic]].&lt;ref name="Notices"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.interpol.int/INTERPOL-expertise/Notices |title=INTERPOL Expertise – Notices |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |publisher=Interpol |accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to the Notice is another request for cooperation or alert mechanism known as a 'diffusion'. This is less formal than a notice, but also is used to request the arrest or location of an individual or additional information in relation to a police investigation. A diffusion is circulated directly by a member state or international entity to the countries of their choice, or to the entire Interpol membership and is simultaneously recorded in Interpol's databases.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Notices" /&gt;

==History==
The International Notice system was created in 1946 as Interpol re-established itself after [[World War II]] in the [[Paris]]ian suburb of [[Saint-Cloud]]. It initially consisted of six colour coded notices; Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, Black, and Purple. In 2004, the seventh colour was added, Orange.&lt;ref name="Orange Notice" /&gt;

In 2005, the Interpol-United Nations Security Council Special Notice was created at the request of the UN Security Council through [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1617|Resolution 1617]] to provide better tools to help the Security Council carry out its mandate regarding the freezing of assets, travel bans, and arms embargoes aimed at individuals and entities associated with [[Al-Qaeda]] and the [[Taliban]] and was adopted by Interpol at its 74th General Assembly in [[Berlin]] in September 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.interpol.int/content/download/5381/45176/version/4/file/agn74res05.pdf |title=The United Nations Security Council's request to Interpol to assist the UN's anti-terrorism fight |date=September 2005 |publisher=Interpol |format=PDF |accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011===
Interpol published approximately 26,500 notices and diffusions in 2011:

==Controversy==

In his book, ''[[Red Notice (book)|Red Notice: A True Story of High Finance, Murder, and One Man’s Fight for Justice]]'', [[Bill Browder]], the CEO of [[Hermitage Capital Management]], describes how the Russian government repeatedly requested that Interpol issue a Red Notice for his arrest. Interpol refused to do so on the basis that it deemed the request was "predominantly political in nature and therefore contrary to INTERPOL's rules and regulations". Unable to secure his extradition, Browder was subsequently tried and convicted by a Moscow court for tax evasion ''[[Trial in absentia|in absentia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=INTERPOL cannot be used by the Russian Federation to seek the arrest of Mr William Browder |url=http://www.interpol.int/News-and-media/News/2013/N20130726 |location=Lyon, France |publisher=Interpol |date=26 July 2013 |access-date=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Zug |first=James |author-link=James Zug |date=31 January 2015 |title=‘Red Notice’ by Bill Browder |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/books/2015/01/31/review-red-notice-true-story-high-finance-murder-and-one-man-fight-for-justice-bill-browder/0nyJkdoh2hiwGlOrOF2aAM/story.html |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |access-date=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=31 January 2015 |title=Red sky in the morning |url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21641125-salutary-tale-robbery-and-redress-red-sky-morning |newspaper=[[The Economist]] |access-date=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Grimes |first=William |author-link=William Grimes (journalist) |date=1 February 2015 |title=To Russia, With Capitalist Ambitions |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/02/arts/bill-browders-red-notice-about-his-russian-misadventures.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, [[United Kingdom]]-based NGO [[Fair Trials]] called on Interpol to introduce more rigorous checks. Fair Trial chief executive Jago Russell stated, "Interpol has been allowing itself to be used by oppressive regimes across the world to export the persecution of human rights defenders, journalists and political opponents". There have been concerns about conflict of interest as well as in March 2017, the UAE donated $54 million to Interpol, which roughly equaled the contributions by all other member states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UAE donates $54m to Interpol |url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1367033/uae-donates-54m-interpol}}/&lt;/ref&gt; Interpol's secretary-general, Jurgen Stock, stated that Interpol had introduced a task force to review requests "even more intensively".&lt;ref name="AlJazeera"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Spiller|first1=Sarah|last2=Macrae|first2=Callum|title=Interpol: Red Alert!|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/peopleandpower/2017/01/interpol-red-alert-170111133954581.html|accessdate=31 July 2017|work=www.aljazeera.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commission for the Control of Interpol's Files ("CCF")==

The Commission for the Control of Interpol's Files ("CCF") is an independent monitoring body. It operates in line with a number of official rules and documents and has three main functions:
* Monitoring the application of data protection rules to personal data processed by Interpol
* Advising with regard to any operations or projects concerning the processing of personal information
* Processing requests for access to Interpol's files

In 2008, the Interpol General Assembly voted to amend Interpol's Constitution to integrate the CCF into its internal legal structure, thereby guaranteeing its independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interpol.int/About-INTERPOL/Structure-and-governance/Commission-for-the-Control-of-INTERPOL%27s-Files|title=Commission for the Control of INTERPOL's Files|work=interpol.int|accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CCF's most notable function, however, is to consider legal petitions submitted by individuals requesting the revocation of Red Notices. Such petitions, as a rule, only succeed when the Red Notice is deemed to infringe Interpol's Constitution either because it offends the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] or because it was issued for political, religious, military, or racial reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interpol.int/About-INTERPOL/Legal-materials/The-Constitution|title=The Constitution|work=interpol.int|accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview given to [[Forbes]] Africa Magazine in July 2013, leading international defense attorney [[Nick Kaufman]] observed that it may take months for the CCF to rule on such a petition adding that the review body "doesn't have to give reasons for its decision and there is no right of appeal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://jaycaboz.wordpress.com/2013/07/26/publications-july-forbes-africa-magazine/|title=Publications July Forbes Africa Magazine|publisher=Jay Caboz|accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Red notices often are controversial and have been used to persecute opponents of regimes.&lt;ref&gt;http://fpc.org.uk/fsblob/1630.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; An example being that of the former president of Ukraine, [[Viktor Yanukovych]] whose red notice was removed because it was shown to be a political request.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30777844&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.kyivpost.com/article/content/ukraine-politics/yanukovych-no-longer-listed-as-wanted-person-by-interpol-393931.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

In the original 1985 version of the [[Brøderbund]] computer game ''[[Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego? (1985 video game)|Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?]]'', the first part of the player's objective in each mission is to obtain an Interpol Red Notice (imprecisely described as a "warrant to arrest") against a member of a fictitious [[Organized crime|crime syndicate]].{{cn|date=November 2017}}

'''John Wickham Legg''' (28 December 1843 &amp;ndash; 28 October 1921) was an English physician and a writer on theological subjects, especially [[ecclesiology]] and [[liturgy]].

==Life and career==
He was the third son of the printer and bookseller George Legg, and was born at [[Alverstoke]] near [[Portsmouth]] in [[Hampshire]], [[England]], on 28 December 1843. He was educated at [[Winchester College]] and from there he went to [[New College, Oxford]] and subsequently opted to read Medicine at [[University College, London]], where he studied under [[Sir William Jenner]]. Having qualified as a member of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|Royal College of Surgeons]], he was recommended by Jenner for the post of medical attendant to Prince Leopold, [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]'s fourth son, later styled [[Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany|Duke of Albany]], a [[hemophilia|haemophiliac]]. Though the appointment lasted only a year, the young Legg became a favourite of the Prince's wife, [[Princess Helena of Waldeck|Princess Helen]], and of their daughter, [[Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone]].

In 1867, Legg studied in [[Berlin]] and upon his return he obtained his M.D. and membership of the [[Royal College of Physicians of London|Royal College of Physicians]] and was appointed curator of the Pathological Museum at [[University College, London|University College]]. He began to publish and in 1870 became Casualty Physician at [[St Bartholomew's Hospital|St Bartholomew's Hospital, London]]. About this time he took up [[liturgical]] studies as a hobby.

In 1872 Legg married Eliza Jane Houghton and they had a son, [[Leopold George Wickham Legg|Leopold]], in 1877.

The medical publications continued, but the liturgical studies also progressed. In 1875 Legg was elected a fellow of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]] and the following year of the [[Royal College of Physicians]]. In 1878 he became Assistant Physician at [[St Bartholomew's Hospital, London|Bart's]] and the following year began to lecture on Pathology. The liturgical hobby surfaced publicly in 1879 when he became a founder member of the re-established [[St Paul's Ecclesiological Society]] and with an 1881 essay on liturgical colours. The medical career was still unflagging, for in 1883 he gave the Bradshaw Lecture to the [[Royal College of Physicians]] on cardiac aneurisms. However, ill health then intervened. Following two attacks of [[rheumatic fever]], Legg resigned his offices in 1887 and gave away his medical books, retiring for the winter to [[Cannes]].

In 1888 Legg faced the public with the first fruits of a series of editions he was to produce in the next three decades: an edition with [[Cambridge University Press]] of the reformed [[breviary]] devised and published by [[Francisco de Quiñones|Cardinal Quiñones]] in 1535.

Having developed a taste for this line of work, Legg dedicated his energies, social graces and connections to consolidating it. He was the prime mover behind the foundation in 1890 of the [[Henry Bradshaw Society for the Editing of Rare Liturgical Texts|Henry Bradshaw Society]], which on the model of the [[Surtees Society]] aimed at publishing manuscripts and rare printed works in volumes issued to subscribing members. Fittingly enough for a Society inaugurated in the [[Jerusalem Chamber]] of [[Westminster Abbey]], Legg contributed as its first publication a monumental edition of the manuscript Westminster Missal.

An important figure in the history of [[Coronation of the British monarch|coronation in the British monarchy]] (''The Coronation of the Queen'' (1898), ''Three Coronation Orders'' (1900)), Legg passed the passions for this topic to his son, [[Leopold George Wickham Legg]], who published ''English Coronation Records'' (1901).&lt;ref name=Strong&gt;{{citation|last=Strong |first=Roy C. |title=Coronation: A History of Kingship and the British Monarchy |publisher=HarperCollins |year=2005 |page=470 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9OwWAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Leopold+George%22+%22Legg%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legg's publications continued until the last major work, the edition of the [[Sarum Missal]] which he published with [[Oxford University Press]] in 1916. He died at the home of his son, Leopold, by then a Fellow of [[New College, Oxford]], on 28 October 1921, and was buried in [[Saltwood, Kent]].

'''John of Wallingford''' (died 1214), also known as '''John de Cella''', was Abbot of [[St Albans Abbey]] in the [[England|English]] county of [[Hertfordshire]] from 1195 to his death in 1214. He was previously prior of [[Wallingford Priory|Holy Trinity Priory]] at [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]] in [[Berkshire]] (now [[Oxfordshire]]), a cell of St Albans.

He should not be confused with [[John of Wallingford (d. 1258)|another John of Wallingford]] (died 1258), who was a friend of the famous chronicler [[Matthew Paris]]; nor with the unknown author of the so-called "Chronicle of John of Wallingford" (ca. 1225–1250), that is included in a manuscript of the papers of the later John of Wallingford.

==Life==
According to Matthew Paris's ''Gesta Abbatum'' ("Actions of the Abbots"), John came from a moderate family not far from a place called Stodham,&lt;ref&gt;[[Matthew Paris]], ''Gesta Abbatum'', vol i., p. [https://archive.org/stream/gestaabbatummon00rilegoog#page/n250/mode/2up 217]: ''non procul a vinculo qui "Stodham" dicitur, ex mediocri prosapia oriundus''.&lt;br&gt;A partial translation/summary is given by [[Henry Chauncy]] in his ''Historical Antiquities of Hertfordshire'' (1700), p.[https://books.google.com/books?id=AN4HAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA263 263]&lt;br /&gt;See also [[William Henry Page|William Page]], ed. (1914), ''A History of the County of Hertford: volume 4, Religious Houses'' ([[Victoria County History]] series), pp. [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=37957 372-416].&lt;/ref&gt; presumably today's [[Stadhampton]] about five miles north of Wallingford.  A tradition that he was from the family of John de la Hyde de Southcote, ancestor of the [[Hyde family of Denchworth]], is apparently mentioned by some editions of ''[[Burke's Landed Gentry]]''{{better source|date=April 2014}} but it is not clear what the basis for this may be.

The ''Gesta'' records that John studied in [[University of Paris|Paris]]. He gained an excellent reputation and "in grammar he was considered a very [[Priscian]], in poetry a perfect [[Ovid]], and in physic esteemed equal to [[Galen]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Matthew Paris]], ''Gesta Abbatum'', vol i., p. [https://archive.org/stream/gestaabbatummon00rilegoog#page/n250/mode/2up 217]. Apparently the abbot was a ''judex urinarum incomparabilis'' (vol i., p. [https://archive.org/stream/gestaabbatummon00rilegoog#page/n280/mode/2up 246].)&lt;/ref&gt;  After taking Benedictine vows, he was sent to [[Wallingford Priory]], where he became prior in 1191. From this he gained his St Albans by-names "de Wallingford" and "de Cella", having been superior of this important cell of the abbey.&lt;ref name="VCH Berks 2" /&gt; Four years later, on 20 July 1195, he was elected Abbot of St. Albans, where he presided with "sanctity and success".&lt;ref  name="VCH Berks 2"&gt;[[P.H. Ditchfield]] and [[William Henry Page|William Page]], eds. (1907), ''A History of the County of Berkshire: Volume 2'' ([[Victoria County History]] series), pp. [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=40059 77-79].&lt;/ref&gt;  He rebuilt the refectory and the dormitory, and extended the west front of the abbey church, though not without difficulty: the work "swallowed up the revenues as the sea the rivers, and made no progress", until a simplifed design was eventually completed.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Henry Page|William Page]], ed. (1908), ''A History of the County of Hertford: volume 2'' ([[Victoria County History]] series), pp. [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=43312 483-488].&lt;/ref&gt;

He was regarded by the 19th-century scholar [[Henry Richards Luard]] as the originator of the core of [[Roger of Wendover]]'s ''[[Flores Historiarum]]'', which became the first part of Matthew Paris's ''[[Chronica Majora]]'', but this has since been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Flores Historiarum]]'' for details.&lt;/ref&gt;  No source of the time makes any mention of him as a historian.

The '''Pastoral Letter of the Polish Bishops to their German Brothers''' ({{lang-pl|Orędzie biskupów polskich do ich niemieckich braci w Chrystusowym urzędzie pasterskim}}; {{lang-de|Hirtenbrief der polnischen Bischöfe an ihre deutschen Amtsbrüder}}) was a [[pastoral letter]] sent on 18 November 1965 by [[Poland|Polish]] [[bishop]]s of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] to their [[Germany|German]] counterparts. It was foremost an invitation to the 1000 Year Anniversary Celebrations of Poland's Christianization in 966. In this invitation letter the bishops asked for cooperation not only with Catholics but with Protestants as well.

While recalling past and recent historical events, the bishops stretched out their hands in forgiveness and are asking for forgiveness. Here referred to as '''Letter of Reconciliation of the Polish Bishops to the German Bishops''' it is actually only one part of the extensive groundbreaking invitation and letter, where they declared: "We forgive and ask for forgiveness" (for the crimes of World War II).

==Significance==

It was one of the first attempts at reconciliation after the tragedies of the [[Second World War]], in which [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invaded Poland]]; both countries lost millions of people, while millions more, both Poles and Germans, had to flee from their homes or were forcibly resettled. [[Pope Pius XII]] had nominated German bishops over Polish dioceses, which was seen as the Holy See's recognition of the German conquest, and generated popular feeling against the Vatican.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6UsEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA109&amp;dq=warsaw%20intitle%3Alife&amp;pg=PA114#v=onepage&amp;q=warsaw%20intitle:life&amp;f=false Life 19 Nov 1945]&lt;/ref&gt; A much larger part was the invitation and the attempt of the Catholic bishops to gain distance from the Communists who were ruling Poland.

Among prominent supporters of this letter was [[Krakow]]'s [[Archbishop]], Karol Wojtyła, who later became [[Pope John Paul II]] in 1978.

The letter was answered by bishops of both of the then-two Germanys together.

==Reaction==

Widely publicised in Poland's churches, the letter drew a strong reaction from the [[Communist]] authorities of the [[People's Republic of Poland]]. [[Władysław Gomułka]] saw it as clearly aimed at countering his propaganda, which saw [[West Germany]] as the main external enemy of Poland and continued hostility between Poland and West Germany as one of the main guarantees of social order in the [[Recovered Territories]].

To counteract the threat of losing control over people's minds, the Communist authorities reacted with anti-German and anti-Catholic [[hysteria]]. The [[Primate of Poland]], [[Stefan Wyszyński]], was denied a passport for his trip to [[Rome]] and on January 15, 1966, Gomułka announced preparations for state celebrations of the ''1000 Years of the Polish State'', intended as a countermeasure against the church-sponsored celebrations of 1000 years of the [[baptism of Poland]]. Most [[German language|German linguists]] were forced to sign a letter of protest; those who refused were fired from their universities. In addition, the authorities twice refused permission for a planned visit of [[Pope Paul VI]] to Poland in 1966. The following year the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] planned to limit the number of [[Parochial school|religious school]]s, which was also seen as a penalty for the Letter of Reconciliation. The anti-church campaign lasted until Gomułka's downfall in 1970.

'''Like.com''' was a [[price comparison service]] website that billed itself as a "visual search engine for products".&lt;ref name=bweek&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2009-08-04 |url=http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/techbeat/archives/2006/11/likecom_visual.html |title=Like.com: Visual Shopping Search |work=BusinessWeek |date=2006-11-08 |author=Hof, Rob }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The website was created by [[Riya (company)|Riya]], a company built to create a search engine used to search for similar faces among photos. The company found it difficult to monetize the service, however, so they created Like.com to use the same technology for a different purpose. Riya's CEO, Munjal Shah, noted that "the same technology works well to find similar-looking products."&lt;ref name=bweek /&gt; Riya's CTO and co-founder, Burak Göktürk, had previously worked with computer vision technology and has filed for two dozen facial-recognition patents under his name.&lt;ref name=mw /&gt; The website was first announced at the [[Web 2.0 Conference]] on November 8, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2009-08-04 |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-9661237-2.html |title=Riya launches Like.com, visual search for shoppers |publisher=CNET News |work=Webware |date=2006-11-08 |author=Needleman, Rafe }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like.com raised US$19.5&amp;nbsp;million from investors who included [[Bay Partners]], [[BlueRun Ventures]], and [[Leapfrog Ventures]]. The company planned to make money by acting as an affiliate to the retail sites that it links to, allowing it to receive about a 10% commission on each sale that the website sent to an online retailer. As of November 2006, the website had about two million unique products from 200 merchants.&lt;ref name=bweek /&gt; In 2015, the site became defunct and redirected users to Google's shopping search engine.

==Features==
Since launching, the website has only allowed users to search for jewelry, handbags, shoes, and watches. Users can browse the website to find a product that they are interested in, or one that looks similar to what they are looking for. They can then choose to use the website to search its database for similar-looking products.&lt;ref name=bweek /&gt; The website then returns the results with links to retailers such as [[Amazon.com]] and [[Zappos]]. With the results, users can highlight parts of a product image to find other products with similar patterns, shapes, and colors.&lt;ref name=bweek /&gt; Each of the three criterion can be ranked to determine the importance of each according to the user.&lt;ref name=bweek /&gt; Like.com is planning to allow users to upload their own photos for the website to analyze and return similar-looking products. They wish to also allow users to upload photos taken in places such as stores with a mobile device, so that they can search for the product online at a cheaper price.&lt;ref name=bweek /&gt;

==Reception==
Bambi Francisco of [[MarketWatch]] described Like.com as "the next evolution of comparison-shopping engines, such as [[Google]]'s [[Froogle]], [[eBay]]'s [[Shopping.com]], [[EW Scripps]]' [[Shopzilla]] or [[Become.com]] and the next evolution in image search offered by the portals and search engines, Google, [[Yahoo]], [[Microsoft Live|Microsoft's Live]] and [[InterActiveCorp]]'s [[Ask.com]]."&lt;ref name=mw&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2009-08-04 |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/visual-search-and-shopping-collide |title=Visual search and shopping collide  |publisher=MarketWatch |date=2006-11-09 |author=Francisco, Bambi }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acquisitions==
Internet search engine giant, Google Inc, bought the shopping comparison website, Like.com on Aug 23 2010. [[Google]] officials reported that the Like.com will continue to operate separately from Google operations.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

'''MasterFormat''' is a standard for organizing [[specification]]s and other written information for commercial and institutional [[building]] projects in the U.S. and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Mowrer, F. "[http://www.fire.nist.gov/bfrlpubs/fire94/PDF/f94029.pdf Development of the fire Data Management System]" Department of Fire Protection and Engineering, NIST-GCR-94-693, August 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes referred to as the "Dewey Decimal System" of building construction, MasterFormat is a product of the [[Construction Specifications Institute]] (CSI) and [http://www.csc-dcc.ca/ Construction Specifications Canada] (CSC). It provides a master list of Divisions, and Section numbers with associated titles within each Division, to organize information about a facility’s [[construction]] requirements and associated activities.&lt;ref&gt;Charette, R. and Marshall, A. "[http://www.fire.nist.gov/bfrlpubs/build99/PDF/b99080.pdf Uniformat II Elemental classification for Building Specifications, Cost Estimating, and Cost Analysis]," NIST BFRL Office of applied Economics, NISTIR6389, October 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

MasterFormat is used throughout the construction industry to format specifications for construction contract documents. The purpose of this format is to assist the user to organize information into distinct groups when creating contract documents, and to assist the user searching for specific information in consistent locations. The information contained in MasterFormat is organized in a standardized outline format within [[50 Divisions]] ([[16 Divisions]] pre-2004). Each Division is subdivided into a number of Sections.&lt;ref&gt;Ross Spiegel and Dru Meadows, Green Building Materials: A Guide to Product Selection and Specification, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
After World War II, building construction specifications began to expand, as more advanced materials and choices were made available.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clendining |first1=Warren |title=History of Specifications |url=http://www.technical-expressions.com:80/mf/spec-history/index.html |website=Technical Expressions |accessdate=28 May 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130322234436/http://www.technical-expressions.com/mf/spec-history/index.html |archivedate=22 March 2013 |date=2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Construction Specifications Institute]] (CSI) was founded in 1948 and began to address the organization of specifications into a numbering system. In 1963, they published a format for construction specifications, with 16 major divisions of work. A 1975 CSI publication used the term MasterFormat. The last CSI MasterFormat publication to use the 16 divisions was in 1995, and this is no longer supported by CSI. In November 2004, MasterFormat expanded from [[16 Divisions]] to [[50 Divisions]], reflecting innovations in the construction industry and expanding the coverage to a larger part of the construction industry.&lt;ref name="whatnumber"&gt;{{cite web|title=What's My MasterFormat Number?|url=https://www.csiresources.org/practice/standards/masterformat/masterformat-number|website=CSI|accessdate=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Revised editions were published in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2018.&lt;ref name="whatnumber" /&gt; 

==Advantages==
Standardizing the presentation of such information improves communication among all parties involved in construction projects. That helps the project team deliver structures to owners according to their requirements, timelines, and budgets. An indication of the widespread acceptance of MasterFormat is that the ASTM standard for sustainability assessment of building products relies on MasterFormat to organize the data.&lt;ref&gt;ASTM Standard E2129-05, 2005, "[http://www.astm.org/Standards/E2129.htm Standard Practice for Data Collection for Sustainability Assessment of Building Products]", [[ASTM International]], West Conshohocken, PA, 2005, {{doi|10.1520/E2129-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; MasterFormat is an integral component of the SpecsIntact system. SpecsIntact (Specifications Kept Intact), is an automated specification processing system for preparing certain government facility construction projects using standard master specifications, called Master Text or Masters, supplied by each of three government agencies. SpecsIntact was developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ([[NASA]]) and designed for use by engineers, architects, interior designers, specification writers, project managers and construction managers. The Naval Facilities Engineering Command ([[NAVFAC]]) and the Army Corps of Engineers ([[USACE]]) has also adopted SpecsIntact as their standard specifications system, greatly facilitating the effort to standardize construction specifications throughout these agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Morales, M. "SpecsIntact" National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Kennedy Space Center, FL 32899, website last accessed May 4, 2009. [http://specsintact.ksc.nasa.gov/webhelp/SIgeneral/MasterFormat_2004_Edition.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; These services utilize MasterFormat from UFGS (United Facilities Guide Specification) sections found on the Whole Building Design Guide website.

==Related Organizational Formats==
SectionFormat is a standard for organizing information within each Section. A Section is divided into three Parts—"general," "products," and "execution." Each Part is further organized into a system of Articles and Paragraphs.

A relatively new strategy to classify the built environment, named OmniClass,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OmniClass|url=http://www.omniclass.org/|website=OmniClass|publisher=OCCS Development Committee Secretariat|accessdate=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; incorporates the work results classification in its Table 22 Work Results.

The '''Migros Museum of Contemporary Art''' (German: Migros Museum für Gegenwartskunst) is a museum for contemporary art in [[Zürich]], Switzerland. The museum was founded in 1996
[[De:Rein Wolfs|Rein Wolfs (in German)]]
.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/1648234/museum-revisited-at-migros-museum-fur-gegenwartskunst-zurich|title=&amp;amp;#039;Museum Revisited&amp;amp;#039; at Migros Museum für Gegenwartskunst, Zurich  {{!}} Artinfo|work=Artinfo|access-date=2017-08-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the successor to the Halle für Internationale neue Kunst, which existed from 1978 until 1981. It receives financing from the [[cooperative]] society [[Migros]], which dedicates 1% of earnings, the so-called ''Kulturprozent'' to culture.

The museum was renovated between 2010 and 2012 and reopened on August 31, 2012 with the first Swiss solo exhibition by [[Ragnar Kjartansson (performance artist)|Ragnar Kjartansson]]. The museum has two floors with a total area of approximately 1300 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. One floor is used to display the collection, the other is used for temporary exhibitions.&lt;ref name="arttv"/&gt; The collection contains over 1300 works by 700 artists.

[[File:La ParcaGarciaVega.jpg|thumb|La Parca by Mexican artist [[Antonio García Vega]].]]
In [[Roman mythology]], '''Morta''' was the goddess of death. She is one of the [[Parcae]], related to the Roman conception of the Fates in [[Greek mythology]], the [[Moirai]]. Her Greek equivalent is [[Atropos]]. She is responsible for the pain and/or  death that occur in a half-wake, half-sleep time frame. Her father is the god of darkness and her mother is the goddess of night. She visits and warns in advance of the pain and/or death about to be endured.

'''Nikolai Alexandrovich Kushelev-Bezborodko''' (28 November 1834 - 11 April 1862, [[Nice]], France) was a Russian art collector.

==Life==
His father was [[Alexander Kushelov-Bezborodko]] (1800-1855), senator, state controller, count and member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], whilst his mother was Alexander's wife [[Repnin|Alexandra Nikolaevna née Princess Repnina-Volkonskaya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} ''Мурзанов Н. А.'' Словарь русских сенаторов, 1711—1917 гг. Материалы для биографий. — СПб., 2011. — С. 236.&lt;/ref&gt; After his father's death he inherited half his estate and his art collection. At the end of the [[Crimean War]] he went on a trip to Europe, where he explored several museums and exhibitions and decided to expand his father's collection. He began to actively buy up contemporary paintings and sculptures, mainly from France and in large part directly from the artists or their dealers. In a very short time he managed to expand the collection significantly - despite (or perhaps because of) his lack of age, experience and knowledge he appreciated modern artists such as [[Theodore Rousseau]], [[Jules Dupré]], [[Delacroix]], [[Jean-François Millet]], [[Constant Troyon]] [[Courbet]] and [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot|Corot]] and brought the [[Barbizon school]] to the attention of Russian audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} ''Березина В.'' Французская живопись первой половины и середины XIX века в Эрмитаже. Научный каталог. — Л.: Искусство, 1983. — С. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

He died suddenly in 1862 and his artworks were added to the collections of the museum at the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] in [[St Petersburg]], forming a distinct Kushelevskaya Gallery of over 500 paintings and sculptures. Between 1922 and 1923 almost the whole of this collection was transferred to the [[Hermitage Museum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}}

The Hermitage devoted an exhibition to the collection in 1993.

An '''online public access catalog''' (often abbreviated as '''OPAC''' or simply '''[[library catalog]]''') is an [[online database]] of materials held by a [[library]] or group of libraries. Users search a library catalog principally to locate books and other material available at a library.  In simple language it is an electronic version of the [[card catalog]]. OPAC is the gateway to library's collection.

==History==

===Early online catalogs===
[[File:Dynix-Main-Menu-via-Telnet.jpg|thumb|right|Screenshot of a [[Dynix (software)|Dynix]] menu. First introduced in 1983, Dynix was one of the first and most popular commercial library automation systems ever released, enjoying nearly twenty years of dominance in libraries worldwide.]]
Although a handful of experimental systems existed as early as the 1960s, the first large-scale online catalogs were developed at [[Ohio State University]] in 1975 and the [[Dallas Public Library]] in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Borgman C |title=Why are Online Catalogs Still Hard to Use? |journal=Journal of the American Society for Information Science |volume=47 |issue=7 |year=1996 |page=499 |doi=10.1002/(sici)1097-4571(199607)47:7&lt;493::aid-asi3&gt;3.3.co;2-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These and other early online catalog systems tended to closely reflect the [[card catalogs]] that they were intended to replace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Husain R, Alam Ansari M|lastauthoramp=yes |title=From Card Catalog to Web OPACs |journal=DESIDOC Bulletin of Information Technology |volume=26 |issue=2 |year=2006 |pages=41–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using a dedicated [[Computer terminal|terminal]] or [[telnet]] client, users could search a handful of pre-coordinate indexes and browse the resulting display in much the same way they had previously navigated the card catalog.

Throughout the 1980s, the number and sophistication of online catalogs grew. The first commercial systems appeared, and would by the end of the decade largely replace systems built by libraries themselves. Library catalogs began providing improved search mechanisms, including Boolean and keyword searching, as well as ancillary functions, such as the ability to place holds on items that had been checked-out.

At the same time, libraries began to develop applications to automate the purchase, cataloging, and circulation of books and other library materials. These applications, collectively known as an [[integrated library system]] (ILS) or library management system, included an online catalog as the public interface to the system's inventory. Most library catalogs are closely tied to their underlying ILS system.

===Stagnation and dissatisfaction===
The 1990s saw a relative stagnation in the development of online catalogs. Although the earlier character-based interfaces were replaced with ones for the Web, both the design and the underlying search technology of most systems did not advance much beyond that developed in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Borgman C (1996), 493-503.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, organizations outside of libraries began developing more sophisticated information retrieval systems. Web search engines like [[Google]] and popular e-commerce websites such as [[Amazon.com]] provided simpler to use (yet more powerful) systems that could provide relevancy ranked search results using probabilistic and vector-based queries.

Prior to the widespread use of the Internet, the online catalog was often the first information retrieval system library users ever encountered. Now accustomed to web search engines, newer generations of library users have grown increasingly dissatisfied with the complex (and often arcane) search mechanisms of older online catalog systems.

This has, in turn, led to vocal criticisms of these systems within the library community itself, and in recent years to the development of newer (often termed 'next-generation') catalogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|vauthors=Antelman K, Lynema E, Pace AK|date=|year=2006|title=Toward a Twenty-First Century Library Catalog|url=https://ejournals.bc.edu/ojs/index.php/ital/article/view/3342|journal=Information Technology &amp; Libraries|volume=25|issue=3|pages=128–139|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Next-generation catalogs===
The newest generation of library catalog systems are distinguished from earlier OPACs by their use of more sophisticated search technologies, including relevancy ranking and [[faceted search]], as well as features aimed at greater user interaction and participation with the system, including tagging and reviews. These new features rely heavily on existing [[metadata]] which is often poor or inconsistent, particularly for older records.

These newer systems are almost always independent of the library's [[integrated library system]] (ILS), instead providing drivers that allow for the synchronization of data between the two systems. While older online catalog systems were almost exclusively built by ILS vendors, libraries are increasingly turning to next generation catalog systems built by enterprise search companies and open source projects, often led by libraries themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Breeding M |title=Open Source Library Automation |journal=Library Technology Reports|volume=44 |issue=8 |year=2008 |pages=5–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |author=Ganseman J |title=Refactoring a Library's Legacy Catalog: a Case Study |conference=IAML 2015 |year=2015 |url=http://wiki.muziekcollecties.be/images/IAML2015_JG.pdf |location=New York City, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The costs associated with these new systems, however, have slowed their adoption, particularly at smaller institutions.

An example of a next generation OPAC system is included in the [[Libramatic]] software package.

==Union catalogs==
Although library catalogs typically reflect the holdings of a single library, they can also contain the holdings of a group or [[consortium]] of libraries. These systems, known as union catalogs, are usually designed to aid the borrowing of books and other materials among the member institutions via [[interlibrary loan]]. Examples of this type of catalogue include [[COPAC]], [[SUNCAT]], [[NLA Trove]], City of Cape Town library OPAC, and [[WorldCat]], reflecting the collections of libraries worldwide.&lt;ref name="WorldCatstatistics"&gt;{{cite web
| url =http://www.oclc.org/ca/en/worldcat/statistics/default.htm
| title =WorldCat facts and statistics
| year =2009
| publisher =[[Online Computer Library Center]]
| accessdate =November 4, 2009
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related systems==
There are a number of systems that share much in common with library catalogs, but have traditionally been distinguished from them. Libraries utilize these systems to search for items not traditionally covered by a library catalog.

These include [[bibliographic database]]s—such as [[Medline]], [[ERIC]], [[PsycINFO]], and many others—which index journal articles and other research data. There are also a number of applications aimed at managing documents, photographs, and other digitized or [[born-digital]] items such as [[Digital Commons]] and [[DSpace]]. Particularly in academic libraries, these systems (often known as [[digital library]] systems or [[institutional repository]] systems) assist with efforts to preserve documents created by faculty and students.

'''POETS day''' is a term used by workers in the [[United Kingdom]] to refer jocularly to Friday as the last day of the [[work week]]. The word "POETS" is an [[acronym]] for "Piss off early, tomorrow's Saturday": hence Friday becomes "Poets day". It is tradition to begin the POETS day at 3.30PM. Variations on this are "Punch out early, tomorrow's Saturday" (referring to a manual punch [[time clock]]), "Push off early, tomorrow's Saturday" and "Push off early, tomorrow's Sunday" (based on the old 6-day work week). 

It also is a [[backronym]], to be read as in "A [[Poet]]s Day Dream."{{cn|date=March 2015}}

The [[University of Waterloo Faculty of Engineering|Waterloo Engineering Society]] at the [[University of Waterloo]], has an on-campus pub named POETS&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engsoc.uwaterloo.ca/?page_id=534 |title=Waterloo Engineering Society |accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official expansion of the name is "Piss on everything, tomorrow's Saturday".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iwarrior.uwaterloo.ca/2010/01/20/249/poets/ |title=POETS – Movies, ‘OTs &amp; More |date=20 January 2010 |website=The Iron Warrior |access-date=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Calgary]]'s [[Schulich School of Engineering]] also has a weekly meeting/party with the same expansion of POETS.{{cn|date=March 2015}}

In the years immediately before his death, Toynbee donated manuscripts, papers and correspondence relating to Dante and to [[Horace Walpole]] to the [[Bodleian Library]]. Further papers were bequeathed by him in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/dept/scwmss/wmss/online/modern/toynbee-paget/toynbee-paget.html 'Collection Level Description: Paget Toynbee Manuscripts', ''Bodlein Library catalogue'', University of Oxford, 21 January 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motivation ==

With the emergence of chip-multiprocessors computer manufacturers were faced with a problem: The new technology caused a disruptive change.&lt;ref name="mattsonblog"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rabaey08future"&gt;{{Citation

|date=July–August 2008
}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time in computer history software would have to be rewritten in order to take advantage of the parallel nature of those processors, which means that existing programs could not be used effectively to test and develop those new types of computer systems. At that time parallel software only existed in very specialized areas. However, before chip-multiprocessors became commonly available software developers were not willing to [[Parallelization|rewrite]] any mainstream programs, which means hardware manufacturers did not have access to any programs for test and development purposes that represented the expected real-world program behavior accurately. This posed a hen-and-egg problem that motivated a new type of benchmark suite with parallel programs that could take full advantage of chip-multiprocessors.

PARSEC was created to break this circular dependency. It was designed to fulfill the following five objectives:&lt;ref name="bienia08parsec"&gt;{{Citation

# Focuses on multithreaded applications

# Has a diverse selection of programs
# Workloads employ state-of-art techniques
# The suite supports research

Traditional benchmarks that were publicly available before PARSEC were generally limited in their scope of included application domains or typically only available in an unparallelized, serial version. Parallel programs were only prevalent in the domain of [[High-Performance Computing]] and on a much smaller scale in business environments.&lt;ref name=parsec_splash_comparison&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Bienia | first1 = C. | last2 = Kumar | first2 = S. | last3 = Kai Li | doi = 10.1109/IISWC.2008.4636090 | chapter = PARSEC vs. SPLASH-2: A quantitative comparison of two multithreaded benchmark suites on Chip-Multiprocessors | title = 2008 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization | pages = 47 | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-1-4244-2777-2 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[multi-core processor|Chip-multiprocessors]] however were expected to be heavily used in all areas of computing such as with parallelized consumer applications.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="70440">A '''Project Labor Agreement''' ('''PLA'''), also known as a '''Community Workforce Agreement''', is a pre-hire [[collective bargaining]] agreement with one or more [[Trade union|labor organizations]] that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project.&lt;ref name="whitehouse.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/ExecutiveOrderUseofProjectLaborAgreementsforFederalConstructionProjects/|title=Executive Order: Use of Project Labor Agreements for Federal Construction Projects|accessdate=2009-07-24|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724081104/http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/ExecutiveOrderUseofProjectLaborAgreementsforFederalConstructionProjects/|archivedate=2009-07-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before any [[laborer|workers]] are hired on the project, construction unions have bargaining rights to determine the wage rates and [[employee benefit|benefits]] of all employees working on the particular project and to agree to the provisions of the agreement.&lt;ref name="builtbest.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://builtbest.org/sites/builtbest.prometheuslabor.com/files/full_text_california_state_library_project_labor_agreement_report.pdf|title=Johnston-Dodds, Kimberly.

PLAs are authorized under the [[National Labor Relations Act]] (NLRA), 29 U.S.C. §§ 151-169. Sections 8(e) and (f) of the NLRA, 29 U.S.C. §§ 158(e) and (f) make special exceptions from other requirements of the NLRA in order to permit employers to enter into pre-hire agreements with labor unions in the construction industry.&lt;ref name="www4.law.cornell.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www4.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/91-261.ZO.html|title=Building &amp; Constr.

The agreements have been in use in the [[United States]] since the 1930s, and first became the subject of debate in the 1980s, for their use on [[Government spending|publicly funded]] projects. In these instances, government entities made signing PLAs a condition of working on taxpayer funded projects. This type of PLA, known as a government-mandated PLA, is distinct from a PLA voluntarily entered into by contractors on public or private work—as is permitted by the NLRA—as well as a PLA mandated by a private entity on a privately funded construction project. [[Executive order (United States)|Executive orders]] issued since 1992 have affected the use of government-mandated PLAs for federal construction projects and the most recent order, issued by President [[Barack Obama]] in February 2009, encourages their use by federal agencies. The use of PLAs is opposed by a number of groups, who argue that the agreements discriminate against non-union contractors and do not improve efficiency or reduce costs of construction projects. Studies of PLAs have mixed results, with some studies concluding that PLAs have a favorable impact, while others find that the agreements can increase costs, and may negatively impact non-union contractors and workers.

==History of PLAs==

===Early use===
The earliest uses of Project Labor Agreements in the U.S. date back to several dam projects in the 1930s, including the [[Grand Coulee Dam]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]], the [[Shasta Dam]] in [[California]] and the [[Hoover Dam]] in [[Nevada]].&lt;ref name=Richman&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faircontracting.org/PDFs/prevailing_labor_agreements/Project-Labor-Agreement-Brochure.pdf |title=Project Labor Agreements |first=Bill |last=Rickman |year=2000 |work=National Alliance For Fair Contracting |page=5 |format=PDF |accessdate=June 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern PLAs particularly developed from those used in construction carried out during [[World War II]], a period when skilled labor was in demand, construction unions controlled 87% of the national market&lt;ref name=Northrup&gt;{{cite book |title=Government-mandated project labor agreements in construction: a force to obtain union monopoly on government-financed projects |last=Northrup |first=Herbert Roof |year=2000 |publisher=Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania |pages=29 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NdrJGwAACAAJ&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Herbert+Roof+Northrup%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2-dDTv_xEcy40AHXt43oCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwCThG |accessdate=August 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and government spending on construction had increased significantly over a short period of time. These early PLAs focused on establishing standard rates of pay and preventing work stoppages.&lt;ref name=Dunlop&gt;[http://www.jchs.harvard.edu/publications/industrystudies/W02-7_dunlop.pdf Project Labor Agreements]. John T. Dunlop, Harvard University Joint Center for Housing Studies (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; PLA projects that followed included [[Cape Canaveral]] in the 1960s,&lt;ref name=Accounting&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gao.gov/archive/1998/gg98082.pdf/Project-Labor-Agreement-Brochure.pdf |title=Project Labor Agreements |date=May 1998 |work=United States General Accounting Office |pages=6–7 |format=PDF |accessdate=June 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walt Disney World Resort|Disney World]] from 1967–71 and the [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline System|Trans-Alaska Pipeline]] from 1973-77.&lt;ref name=Richman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heller&gt;{{cite news |title=PLAs Grow in Prominence and Gain Critics |first=Al |last=Heller |magazine=New York Construction |date=March 1, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period and subsequently, the unionized share of the construction industry precipitously declined as construction users sought more open competition. By the 1980s, nonunion contractors claimed in excess of 80% of the construction work, in a wide variety of trades, with some variation in different parts of the country.&lt;ref name=Northrup/&gt;

===Boston Harbor and executive orders===
The [[Boston Harbor]] reclamation project that began in the 1980s became the focus of debate over the legality of PLAs.&lt;ref name=Accounting/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heller/&gt; When the [[Massachusetts Water Resources Authority]] elected to use a PLA for the project that mandated union-only labor,&lt;ref name=Greenhouse&gt;{{cite news |title=Supreme Court Roundup |first=Linda |last=Greenhouse |newspaper=New York Times |date=March 9, 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Associated Builders and Contractors of Massachusetts/Rhode Island, Inc. challenged its legality, asserting that the use of a PLA was prohibited by the [[National Labor Relations Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cmaanet.org/files/boston_harbor_project.pdf  |title=A Case Study of Construction Management on the Boston Harbor Project |first1= Walter G |last1=Armstrong |first2=Ralph M. |last2=Wallace|date=January 2001 |work=CM eJournal |publisher=CMAA |accessdate=June 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, the First Circuit [[United States courts of appeals|federal appeals court]] ruled that the Boston Harbor PLA breached federal labor law because of its union-work requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=US Court Voids Labor Pact on Harbor Cleanup |first=Elizabeth |last=Neuffer |newspaper=The Boston Globe |date=October 25, 1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 23, 1992, while the Boston Harbor case was still in court, President [[George H. W. Bush]] signed [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] 12818 prohibiting federal agencies from exclusively contracting union labor for construction projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=23741#axzz1PGtzXjbF |title=Executive Order 12818 - Open Bidding on Federal and Federally Funded Construction Projects |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=October 23, 1992 |work=The American Presidency Project |accessdate=June 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush's order prohibited the use of PLAs in federal construction projects.&lt;ref name=McKenna&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mckennalong.com/news-advisories-2072.html |title=President Obama Signs Executive Order Allowing Agencies to Require Project Labor Agreements (PLA’s) on Large Construction Projects |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=February 10, 2009 |work=McKenna Long &amp; Aldridge LLP |publisher= |accessdate=June 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Clinton administration]] rescinded this order when President [[Bill Clinton]] issued Executive Order 12836 in February 1993, shortly after he took office.&lt;ref name=Greenhouse/&gt; This order allowed federal agencies to fund construction projects where contractors required a PLA.&lt;ref name=Sweeney&gt;{{cite book |title=Construction Law Update |last=Sweeney|first=Neal J. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2009 |publisher=Wolters Kluwer Law &amp; Business |location= |isbn= |page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; One month later, in the Boston Harbor cleanup case, the [[United States Supreme Court]] unanimously upheld the use of the agreements on public projects.&lt;ref name="www4.law.cornell.edu"/&gt; The Supreme Court ruled that if the government was in the role of a regulator, it was not able to require PLA use under [[United States labor law|labor law]] preemption principles, however, it could choose to do so as a market participant without being preempted by the National Labor Relations Act.&lt;ref name="Heller"/&gt; The Court did not address the separate question of whether government-mandated PLAs are lawful under federal or state competitive bidding laws. The decision led to increased use of PLAs in public-sector construction projects throughout the U.S.&lt;ref name="Accounting"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heller/&gt;

In 1997, Clinton proposed an executive order stating that federal agencies must consider use of PLAs for federally funded projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Government Shouldn't Go Where It Doesn't Belong |newspaper=Engineering News-Record |date=May 5, 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Republicans staunchly opposed the move, believing it would restrict federal projects to union contractors only. Clinton abandoned the proposed executive order,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Herman Confirmed After Clinton Drops Executive Order |newspaper=National Journal's CongressDaily |date=May 1, 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but issued a memorandum on June 5, 1997, encouraging  federal departments to consider the use of PLAs for “large and significant” projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Clinton Memorandum on Labor for Federal Construction Projects |newspaper=U.S. Newswire |date=June 6, 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The memorandum required that government agencies review each project to decide whether a PLA would allow the agency to increase efficiency and reduce costs.&lt;ref name=Sweeney/&gt;

===Prohibition for federal projects===
On February 17, 2001, President [[George W. Bush]] signed Executive Order 13202, “Preservation of Open Competition and Government Neutrality Towards Government Contractors’ Labor Relations on Federal and Federally Funded Construction Projects”, prohibiting the use of PLAs for construction projects with federal funding.&lt;ref name=BushEO13202&gt;[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=2001_register&amp;docid=fr22fe01-112.pdf Executive Order No. 13202]&lt;/ref&gt; This order stated that construction projects receiving federal funding would not be allowed to impose project labor agreements.&lt;ref name=Murray/&gt; Specifically, the order declared that neither the federal government, nor any agency acting with federal assistance, shall require or prohibit construction contractors to sign union agreements as a condition of performing work on federally funded construction projects.&lt;ref name=BushEO13202/&gt; The order allowed any PLAs that had previously been agreed to continue, and did not affect projects that did not receive federal funding.&lt;ref name=Brazil/&gt; Bush's order revoked the previous executive order affecting PLAs, Clinton's order 12836, which revoked the executive order issued by President George H.W. Bush in 1992.&lt;ref name=Greenhouse&gt;{{cite news |title=Bush Is Moving to Reduce Labor's Political Coffers |first=Steven |last=Greenhouse |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/16/us/bush-is-moving-to-reduce-labor-s-political-coffers.html |newspaper=New York Times |date=February 16, 2001 |accessdate=June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; President George W.

In August 2001, [[U.S. District Court]] ruled Executive Order 13202 invalid in a case examining the use of a PLA by [[Maryland]] for the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge#Replacement facilities|Woodrow Wilson Bridge replacement]] project. The court ruled that the order was invalid as it conflicted with the [[National Labor Relations Act]].&lt;ref name=Brazil&gt;{{cite news |title=Judge throws out Bush construction labor order |first=Eric |last=Brazil |url= |newspaper=The San Francisco Chronicle |date=August 28, 2001 |page=D2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judge issued a permanent injunction to block enforcement of the order on November 7, 2001.&lt;ref name=Strope&gt;{{cite news |title=Federal judge blocks enforcement of Bush ban on project labor agreements |first=Leigh |last=Strope |newspaper=Associated Press |date=November 7, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WH2002&gt;{{cite news |title=Bush Administration, Construction Unions In Fight Over Project Labor Agreements |newspaper=The White House Bulletin |date=December 5, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2002, the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia]] overturned the District Court's decision and ordered the removal of the injunction.&lt;ref name=Murray&gt;{{cite news |title=Court backs Bush over labor unions in bridge project |first=Frank J. |last=Murray |url= |newspaper=The Washington Times |date=July 16, 2002 |page=A03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this decision, the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], [[NASA]] and the [[General Services Administration]] formally recognized the order in the [[Federal Register]] and implemented it in their construction bidding processes.&lt;ref name=WH2002/&gt;

Although the Court of Appeals decision in 2002 upheld the executive order prohibiting federal projects from using PLAs, individual states and counties were permitted to use PLAs for some public works where funding was from state and local revenue. These PLAs received opposition by organizations such as the Associated Builders and Contractors, and the Black Contractors Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nonunion, minority contractors keep fighting for county work |first=Jay |last=Miller |url= |newspaper=Crain's Cleveland Business |date=September 10, 2007 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A notable example of pro-PLA legislation was passed in New Jersey, which enacted a law in 2002 allowing use of PLAs for some government funded projects.&lt;ref name=AP2002&gt;{{cite news |title=Recent legislative activity on project labor agreements across the country |newspaper=The Associated Press |date=August 9, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PLA use since 2009===
{{wikisource|Executive Order 13502}}
On February 6, 2009, President [[Barack Obama]] signed executive order 13502,&lt;ref name="whitehouse.gov"/&gt; which urges federal agencies to consider mandating the use of PLAs on federal construction projects costing $25 million or more on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New Rule Encourages Federal Agencies to Consider Use of Project Labor Agreements |first1=Mark |last1=Baker |first2=Jonathan E. |last2=O’Connell |newspaper=Mondaq |date=May 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This act served to revoke the Bush executive orders 13202 and 13208 from eight years earlier that prohibited government-mandated PLAs on federal and federally funded construction projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Use of Project Labor Agreements for Federal Construction Projects |newspaper=Housing &amp; Urban Development Documents and Publications |date=August 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Obama order states that federal agencies can require a PLA if such an agreement will achieve federal goals in economy and efficiency. According to the terms of the order, non-union contractors may compete for contracts subject to PLAs, but they must agree to the various terms and conditions contained in each PLA in order to win a federal contract and build a project.&lt;ref name=McKenna/&gt; A key change from the 2001 order is that by repealing the Bush orders, the Obama order permits recipients of federal funding, such as state, local and private construction owners, to mandate PLAs on public works projects of any size. However, the order does not encourage or mandate recipients of federal assistance to use a government-mandated PLA.&lt;ref name=McKenna/&gt;

==Debate over use==
There has been much debate over the government-mandated PLAs, particularly for publicly funded projects.&lt;ref name="Heller"/&gt; The use of project labor agreements is supported by the construction unions,&lt;ref name=Grimm&gt;{{cite news |title=Associated Building Contractors joins President Bush in union fight. |first=Eric |last=Grimm |url= |newspaper=Colorado Springs Business Journal  |date=June 15, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some political figures, who state that PLAs are needed to ensure that large, complex projects are completed on time and on schedule.&lt;ref name=Chase&gt;{{cite news |title=Building Controversy |first=Dan |last=Chase |newspaper=BusinessWest |date=April 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to those who support the use of such agreements, PLAs enable project owners to control costs and ensure that there are no disruptions to the construction schedule, for example from strikes.&lt;ref name=Tuerck&gt;{{cite news |title=Why Project Labor Agreements Are Not In The Public Interest |first=David G. |last=Tuerck |newspaper=Cato Journal |date=Winter 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, proponents of PLAs point to the inclusion of clauses in the agreement that agree to establish labor management problem solving committees that deal with scheduling, quality control, health and safety, and productivity problems during the project.&lt;ref name=Ryan&gt;{{cite news |title=Foes of project labor pacts overlook the advantages |first=Mike |last=Ryan |newspaper=Capital Times |date=July 1, 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also state that PLAs ensure that the workforce hired has received training and is of high quality.&lt;ref name=Ryan/&gt; The use of PLAs in large private construction projects such as the building of the [[New England Patriots]]' [[Gillette Stadium]], are given as examples of how PLAs help project owners meet tight deadlines, according to supporters.&lt;ref name=Chase/&gt; In addition to the stated benefits to project owners, supporters of PLAs also say that PLA use has a positive impact on local communities, through set goals for local hiring and provision of education.&lt;ref name=LA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.labor.ucla.edu/programs/pdfs/ConstructionCareersForOurCommunitiesFullReport.pdf|title=UCLA Labor Center, "Construction Careers for our Communities." p. 5, 46.|accessdate=2009-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These groups have challenged the use of such agreements through litigation, lobbying, public relations campaigns.&lt;ref name="abc.org"/&gt; Opponents of PLAs supported the Bush executive order prohibiting government-mandated PLAs, and have argued that between 2001 and 2008, when the executive order was in place, no federal projects suffered significant labor problems, delays or cost overruns attributable to the absence of PLAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beaconhill.org/Testimony/DC2011/Tuerck-Testimony-2011-0603.pdf |title=Hearing on H.R. 735 and Project Labor Agreements: Restoring Competition and Neutrality to Government Construction Projects |last1=Tuerck |first1=David G. |date=June 3, 2011 |work=Beacon Hill |accessdate=August 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to those who oppose PLAs, the agreements place restrictions on the hiring and working practices of contractors, and can lead to increased costs for project owners.&lt;ref&gt;Petitioner’s Opening Brief, Associated Builders and Contractors v. Metropolitan
Water District, Supreme Court Case No. S067485, filed March 19, 1998, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; One of their objections to PLAs is that the agreements require contractors to pay into union benefit plans&lt;ref name="Brazil"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203946904574300113800780786 |title=Wall Street Journal, Union Pensions in the Red: Labor chiefs are doing better than the workers (July 26, 2009)|accessdate=2009-07-27 | work=The Wall Street Journal | date=2009-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and obey union work rules.&lt;ref name="abc.org"/&gt; In addition, they oppose the use of PLAs to restrict hiring on projects to construction workers selected by unions through union hiring halls, stating that this does not increase the quality of worker as all those who are licensed in a craft have at least the same level of education and skill, regardless of whether they belong to a union.&lt;ref name=Chase/&gt;

Another point of debate is the proportion of construction workers who are unionized. According to opponents, under PLAs contractors must hire their workers through unions,&lt;ref name=BizJournal/&gt; and unionized workers are the majority of those who work on PLA projects, despite non-union workers making up the majority of the construction workforce.&lt;ref name=Chase/&gt; Estimates of the percentage of construction workers who are non-union, cited by opponents of PLAs, are around 85%,&lt;ref name=WSJ10/&gt; based on figures from the U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/news.release/union2.t03.htm|title=U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics Union affiliation of employed wage and salary workers by occupation and industry for 2008|accessdate=2009-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more recent data puts this figure at 86.9%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/news.release/union2.nr0.htm |title=Union members summary |work=bls.gov |publisher=U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics Union |date=January 21, 2011 |accessdate=September 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This figure is disputed by supporters of PLAs, who state that the figures given by those in opposition to PLAs are misleading and are based on census data that encompasses too broad a concept of a construction worker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The truth about PLAs |first=Mark |last=Erlich |url=http://articles.boston.com/2010-07-03/bostonglobe/29321405_1_project-labor-agreement-plas-union-contractors |newspaper=The Boston Globe |date=July 3, 2010 |accessdate=June 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a study by [[Cornell University]] in 2010, cited by Mary Vogel, executive director of the Construction Institute, In Massachusetts 60% of the Construction Trades is unionized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://builtbest.org/letter-editor-featured-boston.com-mary-vogel%2C-executive-director-tci%2C-facts-plas |title=Letter to the Editor featured in boston.com by Mary Vogel, Executive Director of TCI, Facts on PLAs |last1=Vogel |first1=Mary |date=July 6, 2010 |work=BuiltBest.org |publisher=The Construction Institute |accessdate=June 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its inception in 1998, The Construction Institute, a non-profit organization is dedicated to the needs of the unionized construction sector in Massachusetts.

A number of politicians do not agree with the use of the agreements for publicly funded construction projects, and have introduced bills or executive orders that prohibit using the agreements for government projects or prevent the use of public funds for projects using PLAs.&lt;ref name=Gazette&gt;{{cite news |title=Input on project labor agreements sought |first=Rick |last=Smith |newspaper=The Gazette |date=12 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Higgins&gt;{{cite news |title=School construction up in air |first=John |last=Higgins |newspaper=Akron Beacon Journal |date=20 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bill Would Liberalize Bidding for Pennsylvania-Funded Projects |first=Bill |last=Sulon |newspaper=The Patriot News |date=5 April 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These include Louisiana Senate Bill 76, introduced by Senator Danny Martiny, to prohibit state governments from requiring a PLA for projects with government funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://biggovernment.com/kmooney/2011/04/28/louisiana-bill-pre-empts-union-backed-project-labor-agreements/ |title=Louisiana Bill Pre-Empts Union-Backed Project Labor Agreements |first=Kevin |last=Mooney |date=28 April 2011 |work=Big Government |publisher=Breitbart |accessdate=17 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bill was passed in June 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.state.la.us/index.cfm?md=newsroom&amp;tmp=detail&amp;articleID=2874 |title=Governor Jindal Signs Bills into Law |date=June 27, 2011 |work=Office of the Governor, State of Louisiana |publisher= |accessdate=June 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; making Louisiana the 5th state in 2011 to ban government requirements that contractors use PLAs for publicly funded construction projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thetruthaboutplas.com/2011/06/28/louisiana-bans-government-mandated-plas/ |title=Louisiana Bans Government-mandated PLAs on State Funded Projects |date=June 28, 2011 |work=The Truth About PLAs |publisher=Associated Builders and Contractors |accessdate=June 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact on cost===
A main argument has been the impact of PLAs on project cost.&lt;ref name=Silver&gt;{{cite news |title=Containing costs on the Silver Line |first= |last= |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/containing-costs-on-the-silver-line/2011/06/23/AGTInhjH_story.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=June 23, 2011 |accessdate=June 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who oppose PLAs state that the agreements impact competition for project bids, reducing the number of potential bidders as non-union contractors are less likely to bid due to the potential restrictions a PLA would pose.&lt;ref name=BizJournal&gt;{{cite news |title=Building Barriers |first=Todd |last=Larson |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/stories/2002/11/04/focus1.html |newspaper=Boston Business Journal |date=November 4, 2002 |accessdate=June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to opponents of the agreements, the reduced competition leads to higher bids and a higher cost for the project owner.&lt;ref name="Grimm"/&gt; In addition, opponents argue that the cost may also be increased due to contractors having greater expenses under a PLA.  For example, according to Max Lyons of the Employee Policy Foundation, the cost of a project under a PLA is increased up to 7%, since contractors are required to pay their employees the union wage, rather than the government-determined prevailing wage.&lt;ref name=Tuerck/&gt; Opponents have also argued that there is evidence to show that PLA mandates add costs by forcing non-union contractors to pay into union benefit plans and their existing benefit plans.&lt;ref name=McGowan&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thetruthaboutplas.com/2009/10/24/new-report-finds-pla-pension-requirements-steal-from-employee-paychecks-harm-employers-and-taxpayers/ |title=The Discriminatory Impact of Union Fringe Benefit Requirements on Nonunion Workers Under Government-Mandated Project Labor Agreements |last1=McGowan |first1=John R. |year=2009 |work=The Truth About PLAs |format=PDF |accessdate=June 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of PLA use argue that the end cost of projects is not increased if a PLA is in place, compared to projects without such an agreement, since the agreements prevent cost overruns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sbctc.org/default.asp?id=386&amp;pagetype=sitemap |title=Project Labor Agreement Op Ed Article |last1=Balgenorth |first1=Robert J. |date=July 30, 2000 |work=State Building Trades and Construction Trades Council of California |publisher= |accessdate=June 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, opponents of the agreements cite examples of projects a PLA was in place and costs overran including Boston's [[Big Dig]] project, [[Safeco Field]] in [[Seattle]], and the [[San Francisco International Airport]].&lt;ref name=WSJ10&gt;{{cite news |title=Crony Contracts |first= |last= |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303695604575182333308913608 |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |date=April 14, 2010 |accessdate=June 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three studies carried out on PLA use in school construction by the [[Beacon Hill Institute]] in 2003, 2004 and 2006, found that costs were increased by up to 20% in projects in [[Massachusetts]], [[Connecticut]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] where PLAs were used.&lt;ref name=BHI2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=BHI2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=BHI2006/&gt; A 2009 study of PLAs use, carried out by Rider Levett Bucknall to determine whether PLAs should be used in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs' construction projects, found that costs would increase if PLAs are used for construction projects in locations where union membership is low. According to their analysis, in areas including [[Denver]], [[Colorado]], [[New Orleans]],
[[Louisiana]], and [[Orlando, Florida]], where unions do not have a great presence, use of PLAs for projects would lead to cost increases from 5% to 9%. In two cities, [[San Francisco]] and [[New York City]], where unions have a great presence, the study predicted mixed results regarding potential cost savings ranging from small project cost increases to small cost savings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thetruthaboutplas.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/PLAs-Impact-Study-for-the-Department-of-Veterans-Affairs-Rider-Levett-Bucknall-060209.pdf |title=Project Labor Agreements Impact Study for the Department of Veterans Affairs |last1=Rider Levett Bucknall |date=June 2, 2009 |work=The Truth About PLAs |format=PDF |accessdate=July 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact on competition===
Opponents of PLAs state that the agreements impact competition for project bids, which can lead to higher costs.&lt;ref name=Tuerck/&gt; It is argued by those who oppose PLAs, such as former ABC president Henry Kelly, that PLAs discourage if not prevent non-unionized contractors from competing for construction projects, particularly federal projects.&lt;ref name=Grimm/&gt; Competitive bidding statutes discourage public sector PLAs from discrimination between non-union and union contractors, as discrimination between bidders would typically represent a violation of such statutes.&lt;ref&gt;Jolie Siegel, PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS AND COMPETITIVE BIDDING STATUTES.

PLAs often require all companies to obtain their workers from union hiring halls, though the union controlling this employee referral system may not discriminate on the basis of a worker's union or non-union status.&lt;ref&gt;John T. Callahan &amp; Sons, Inc. v. City of Malden, 713 N.E.2d 955, 958 (Mass. 1999) ('The PLA mandates that this referral system be operated in a manner that is nondiscriminatory to non-union workers....')&lt;/ref&gt; It is often the case, however, that the hired employees must join a union, usually for the duration of the project.&lt;ref&gt;Perritt, supra note 4, at 87; see generally Harms Constr. v. N.J. Tpk. Auth., 644 A.2d 76, 84 (N.J. 1994) (stating that under a PLA an employer recognizes a particular union as the bargaining representative and that any hired workers must join relevant union).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dispatch&gt;{{cite news |title=Editorial: Second time's a charm |first= |last= |url=http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/editorials/stories/2010/11/17/second-times-a-charm.html?sid=101 |newspaper=The Columbus Dispatch |date=November 17, 2010 |accessdate=June 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; PLA opponents argue that the union control of hiring prevents a non-union contractor for using its own employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Union fight already brewing on new Kings arena|first=Dale |last=Kasler |url=http://www.sacbee.com/2011/06/16/3704536/union-fight-already-brewing-on.html |newspaper=The Sacramento Bee |date=June 16, 2011 |accessdate=June 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increased cost to contractors and the impact on their workers of joining a union, is said by opponents of PLAs to discourage non-union contractors from bidding on projects with a PLA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vegasinc.com/news/2011/jun/06/contractors-ask-court-rule-union-labor-county-jail/ |title=Contractors ask court to rule on union labor for county jail project

===Local impact===
According to supporters, PLAs can be used by public project owners like [[school boards]] or [[city councils]] to set goals for creating local jobs and achieving [[social welfare]] goals through the construction projects they apply to.&lt;ref name="digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name=LA/&gt;&lt;ref name="Belman, Bodah &amp; Phillips"/&gt; PLAs may include provisions for targeted hiring and apprenticeship ratio provisions. According to proponents, by including requirements for a certain proportion of local workers to enter union apprenticeship programs working on the construction program, PLAs can be used to help local workers gain skills.&lt;ref name="digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu"/&gt; The term "Community Workforce Agreement" (CWA) may be used to describe PLAs with community-focused provisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://brr.berkeley.edu/pubs/WP-2007-17.pdf|title=Academic|accessdate=2009-08-02}}, {{Cite web|url=http://www.wowonline.org/publicpolicy/documents/SummaryTargetedHiringProposal.pdf|title=Policy|accessdate=2009-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://liunaactionnetwork.org/laborers/notice-description.tcl?newsletter_id=26799956|title=Political (LiUNA!)|accessdate=2009-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents state that Community Workforce Agreements re-inject the tax dollars paying for these infrastructure projects back to the communities.&lt;ref name=LA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://74.10.59.52/laane/images/projects/Construction/Building%20Opportunity-June%202009.pdf|title=Cornejo, Jackie.

===Impact on minority contractors===
A number of women and minority contractor groups oppose project labor agreements,&lt;ref name=Opponents/&gt; arguing that PLAs disproportionately impact small businesses, particularly those owned by women and minorities. These groups argue that PLAs are anti-free-market and discriminatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Several protest school board's plan to require union contracts |first=Eleanor |last=Chute |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9ggOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2XADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4581,59821&amp;dq=project-labor-agreement+women&amp;hl=en |newspaper=The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |date=June 21, 2005 |accessdate=June 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lawmakers pass state budget |first=Adam |last=Sichko |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/albany/stories/2008/04/07/daily25.html |newspaper=The Business Review |date=April 9, 2008 |accessdate=June 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, groups including the National Association of Women Business Owners, have voiced their opposition to PLAs, and in 1998, there was a House hearing dedicated to the issue of minority groups' opposition to government-mandated PLAs.&lt;ref name=House&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.org/files/Government_Affairs/StateAffairs/House%20Committee%20on%20Small%20Business%20Hearing%20on%20PLAs%20and%20Minority%20and%20Women%208-6-98.pdf|title=Written Testimony Submitted to House Small Business Committee, August 6, 1998|accessdate=2009-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Black Chamber of Commerce opposes the use of PLAs due to the low numbers of black union members in the construction industry.

==Research and reports==
A number of studies and reports have been published, aiming at identifying the impact of PLAs.
In addition to academic research, reports have been produced by government agencies and individuals on behalf of state or federal government. In 1998 the [[Government Accountability Office]] produced a report on PLAs that noted an overall lack of data but reported that both “proponents and opponents of the use of PLAs said it would be difficult to compare contractor performance on federal projects with and without PLAs because it is highly unlikely that two such projects could be found that were sufficiently similar in cost, size, scope, and timing.” The GAO report concluded that it would be difficult to draw "any definitive conclusions" on the impact of PLAs on performance.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.gao.gov/archive/1998/gg98082.pdf Project Labor Agreements: The Extent of Their Use and Related Information]''. U.S. General Accounting Office, GAO/GGD-98-82, May 1998&lt;/ref&gt; More recent reports include a favorable study of PLAs from the [[Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations]], in 2009,&lt;ref name="digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu"/&gt; reports produced by the Beacon Hill Institute since 2003, which conclude that PLAs increase costs of projects,&lt;ref name=BHI2009/&gt; and an analysis published by the National University System Institute for Policy Research, which found that PLAs increased the cost of school construction in California.

In addition to studies examining the use of PLAs and their impact, reports are available detailing the history of PLA use and the arguments for and against their use. Reports examining the history of PLA use, include a 2001 [[California State Library]] report, compiled for [[California State Senate]], which recounts the history of PLAs in California and uses case studies to examine the features of public and private PLAs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://builtbest.org/sites/builtbest.prometheuslabor.com/files/full_text_california_state_library_project_labor_agreement_report.pdf Constructing California, A Review of Project Labor Agreements]'' Johnson-Dodds, Kimberly (2002). At the request of California State Senator John Burton.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2001 ''University of Pennsylvania Journal of Law'' article, the author outlines the arguments on either side of PLAs and evaluates the state of the law since the 1993 Boston Harbor case decision. The article finds that while there are benefits to PLA use, they can present risks and should only be allowed on projects where they will further the goals of competitive bidding statutes, namely timely, efficient, high quality, and inexpensive construction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buildri.org/contentmgr/showdetails.php/id/1827 "Project Labor Agreements and Competitive Bidding Statutes"] Jolie M. Siegel, University of Pennsylvania Journal of Labor and Employment Law, Volume 3, No. 2, Winter 2001, pp. 295-331.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reports supporting PLAs===
Studies have found that PLAs offer benefits to project owners and local communities, and do not disadvantage nonunion contractors and employees. A 2009 study by Fred B. Kotler, J.D., Associate Director of the [[Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations]] found that there is no evidence that PLAs discriminate against employers and workers, limit the pool of bidders, and raise construction costs.&lt;ref&gt;”[http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1021&amp;context=reports Project Labor Agreements in New York State: In the Public Interest]”.  Fred B. Kotler, J.D.  Associate Director, Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations.  March, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2009 report by Dale Belman, of Michigan State University; Matthew M. Bodah of the University of Rhode Island and Peter Philips of the University of Utah, the authors stated that rather than increase cost, the agreements provide benefits to the community. According to their report, project cost is directly related to the complexity of a project, not the existence of an agreement. They found that PLAs are not suited to all projects, but some projects are good candidates for their use, such as highly complex construction projects.&lt;ref&gt;Belman, Bodah Phillips http://www.onlinecpi.org/downloads/PLA-report.pdf UCLA Labor Center, [http://www.labor.ucla.edu/programs/pdfs/ConstructionCareersForOurCommunitiesFullReport.pdf "Construction Careers for our Communities.”] 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have also considered how PLAs may benefit communities through hiring locals. In a paper focused on whether PLAs for projects developed by the Los Angeles Community College District (LACCD), the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), and the City of Los Angeles met local hiring goals, the author found that the goal of 30% local hires set by the PLAs was met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://constructionacademy.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/ConstructionCareersForOurCommunitiesFullReport.pdf |title=Construction Careers for Our Communities |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year=2008 |work=Construction Academy |publisher=UCLA Labor Center |accessdate=June 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports and studies addressing the cost impact of PLAs on construction projects have found that they may not lead to greater costs, such as a 2002 paper by the Harvard University Joint Center for Housing Studies, which states that the increased costs cited by opponents of PLAs is based on bids rather than end costs. According to the paper, a project's end costs would usually be higher than bid costs due to expenses that arise during construction.&lt;ref name=Dunlop/&gt; In addition, a 2004 report by the Director of General Services for Contra Costa County, California reported that bids for five of eight projects subject to a PLA were lower than the architect/engineer cost estimate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lecet.org/Clearinghouse_Public/LECET/PLA/contra_costa.pdf Contra Costa County PLA report]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 a report written on the use of PLAs in [[Iowa]] states that PLA use increases efficiency and cost effectiveness of construction projects. "Public-sector PLAs on complex projects or projects where timely project completion is important have been shown to provide the performance desired by contractors and project managers, who repeatedly use them."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iowapolicyproject.org/2002-2004docs/041201-PLAs-xs.pdf  Project Labor Agreements in Iowa: An Important Tool for Managing Complex Public Construction Projects.] Ralph Scharnau &amp; Michael F. Sheehan, The Iowa Policy Project (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 paper concluded that there was difficulty in identifying the effect of PLAs on cost in construction of schools, due to the differences between schools built with PLAs and those built without them.  The report stated that there was not any statistically significant evidence for an increase in costs for school construction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sandi.net/props/icoc/2009/0422/exhibit_3_1_att1.pdf Project Labor Agreements’ Effect on School Construction Costs in Massachusetts].&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports on the legal considerations affecting PLAs make the case that PLAs are an effective tool for labor relations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lecet.org/Clearinghouse_Public/LECET/PLA/Project%20Laborers%20Agreement%203.pdf Legal Considerations Affecting the Use of Public Sector Project Labor Agreements: A Proponent’s View.]  Bradford W.

Powers and Gerald M. Waites.&lt;/ref&gt; This is supported by a [[UCLA]] study that challenged findings of the Beacon Hill Institute on PLAs, which found that in the private sector, the usage of PLAs "creates continuity and stability of the work force at the job site".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buildri.org/contentmgr/showdetails.php/id/1824 Evaluating PLA Performance?

===Reports opposing PLAs===
Several studies by the [[Beacon Hill Institute]] (BHI) at Suffolk University in Boston, Massachusetts have concluded that PLAs increase construction costs. Studies in 2003, 2004 and 2006 examining the impact of PLAs on school construction in Massachusetts, Connecticut and New York, respectively, found that where PLAs were in use construction costs were increased, even when controlling for the size of project and type of school. The September 2003 study by the institute found that use of PLAs created a cost increase of almost 14% increase compared to a non-PLA project.&lt;ref name=BHI2003&gt;[http://www.abc.org/res.ashx?p=files/Government_Affairs/PLAStudies/PLApolicystudy12903.pdf  Beacon Hill Study Finds PLAs Increase Cost of School Projects in Massachusetts (September 2003)]&lt;/ref&gt; The following year their study of PLAs in Connecticut found that PLAs increased costs by nearly 18%.&lt;ref name=BHI2004&gt;[http://www.abc.org/res.ashx?p=files/Government_Affairs/PLAStudies/PLAinCT04Oct2004.pdf  Beacon Hill Study Finds PLAs Increase Cost of School Projects in Connecticut (September 2004)]&lt;/ref&gt; A May 2006 study by BHI found that the use of PLAs on school construction projects in New York between 1996 and 2004 increased construction costs by 20%. This study controlled for the size of the project and type of school.&lt;ref name=BHI2006&gt;[http://www.beaconhill.org/BHIStudies/PLA2006/NYPLAReport0605.pdf Beacon Hill Study Finds PLAs Increase Cost of School Projects in New York  (May 2006)]&lt;/ref&gt; A report on PLAs by BHI, published in 2009, examined whether claims made in Obama's executive order  that PLAs have a positive economic impact are correct. The report considered the findings of the institute's studies, further case studies of PLA and non-PLA projects and addressed
criticisms of their previous studies and concluded that the justifications for PLA use in the executive order were not proven. In particular the report concluded that there was no economic benefit to taxpayers in using PLAs.&lt;ref name=BHI2009&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beaconhill.org/BHIStudies/PLA2009/PLAFinal090923.pdf |title=Project Labor Agreements on Federal Construction Projects: A Costly Solution in Search of a Problem |last1=Tuerck |first1=David |last2=Glassman |first2=Sarah |last3=Bachman |first3=Paul  |year=2009 |work=Beacon Hill Institute |publisher= |accessdate=June 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An independently-reviewed 2011 study by The National University System Institute for Policy Research analyzed the cost impact of PLAs on school construction in California from 1996 to 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nusinstitute.org/assets/resources/pageResources/Measuring-the-Cost-of-Project-Labor-Agreements-on-School-Construction-in-California.pdf |title=Measuring the Cost of Project Labor Agreements on School Construction in California |last1=Vasquez |first1=Vince |last2=Glaser |first2=Dale |last3=Bruvold |first3=W.

He wrote the authors: "Although your study has several serious statistical issues, at the end of the day, your results are basically consistent with those presented in my article on PLAs and Massachusetts school construction costs.  The take-away from your results can be summarized as follows:  When appropriate controls are included for differences in the characteristics of schools built including school type and location, building specifications, materials used etc., there is no statistical evidence that PLA schools are more costly compared to non PLA schools." Despite Dr. Belman's claims, the Association of California School Administrators and the California Association of School Business Officials released a [http://www.acsa.org/MainMenuCategories/Advocacy/PLAs.aspx memo] on December 20, 2011 indicating that they found the study's results to be "credible."

In 2010, the New Jersey Department of Labor studied the impact of government-mandated PLAs on the cost of school construction in New Jersey during 2008, and also found that school construction projects where a PLA was used had higher costs, per square foot and per student, than those without a PLA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lwd.dol.state.nj.us/labor/forms_pdfs/legal/2010/PLAReportOct2010.pdf |title=Use of Project Labor Agreements in Public Works Building Projects in Fiscal Year 2008 |date=October 2010 |work=New Jersey Department of Labor And Workforce Development |accessdate=August 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier studies also found increased costs when PLAs were used, including a study in 2000 of a Nevada Water Authority project PLA, which found that the project cost an additional $200,000 because the true low bidder refused to sign the PLA. The project then went to a union contractor whose bid was $200,000 higher.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.org/res.ashx?p=files/Government_Affairs/PLAStudies/Nevada.pdfProject Labor Agreements Research Study: Focus on Southern Nevada Water Authority (November 2000)]&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2000, a study commissioned by the [[Jefferson County, New York]] Board of Legislators examining the potential use of a PLA for the Jefferson County Courthouse Complex concluded that a PLA could result in additional costs of more than $955,000. The total estimated increase of costs for the projects, should a PLA be used, would have represented 7% of the total cost of the project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.org/res.ashx?p=files/Government_Affairs/PLAStudies/Jefferson.pdf  Analysis of the Impacts on the Jefferson County (NY) Courthouse Complex through Project Labor Considerations (September 2000)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to increased costs of projects, studies have found that PLAs can lead to greater costs for nonunion contractors and can lower their employees' take home pay. A study was produced in 2009 by John R. McGowan of Saint Louis University, which found that nonunion workers on government projects with a PLA in place have reduced wages, compared with what they would receive for work on a non-PLA government project. In addition, nonunion employers would have to pay for additional benefits that their employees would be ineligible for and might be liable for pension fund withdrawal liability costs if the terms of the PLA mean they have to contribute to a union pension fund for the duration of the project.&lt;ref name="McGowan"/&gt;

PLAs also may impact competition by discouraging nonunion bids, according to studies including a September 2001 study by Ernst &amp; Young, commissioned by [[Erie County, New York]]. This study analyzed the impact of PLAs on public construction projects and concluded that the number of bidders was reduced for projects with a PLA, as "the use of PLAs strongly inhibits participation in public bidding by non-union contractors."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.org/res.ashx?p=files/Government_Affairs/IssuePages/Erie_County_Courthouse_Construction_Projects_Project_Labor_Agreement_Study_Ernst_and_Young_September_2001_.pdf  Erie County (NY) Courthouse Construction Projects: Project Labor Agreement Study (September 2001)]&lt;/ref&gt; The Worcester Municipal Research Bureau produced a report in 2001, based on a number of studies of PLA use. The report stated that PLAs reduced the number of bidders on construction projects, and led to lower savings than would be possible where contractors are able to work under their usual arrangements for employees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wrrb.org/files/downloads/reports/pub_admin/2001/01-4pla.pdf  PLAs on Public Construction Projects: The Case For And Against  (May 2001)]&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1995, an ABC study of the taxpayer costs for Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, New York, assessed bids for the same project both before and after a PLA was temporarily imposed in 1995. It revealed that there were 30% fewer bidders to perform the work and that costs increased by more than 26%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.org/res.ashx?p=files/Government_Affairs/PLAStudies/Letters.pdf  Roswell Park Cancer Institute Letters (March 1995)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of wider economic impact, a November 2000 Price Waterhouse Coopers study requested by the Los Angeles Unified School District was not able to confirm whether the project stabilization/labor agreement for the district's Proposition BB construction had produced either a positive or negative economic impact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.org/res.ashx?p=files/Government_Affairs/PLAStudies/Waterhouse.pdf  Economic Evaluation of Project Stabilization Agreement For Construction Projects Funded Proposition BB (November 2000)]&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2006, the Public Interest Institute released a study that concludes that the PLA agreed for the construction of the Iowa Events Center project in downtown Des Moines, placed an “unnecessary burden” on local workers, businesses and taxpayers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.limitedgovernment.org/publications/pubs/studies/ps-06-3.pdf  Iowa Events Center PLA Study]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''R v Schoombie'''''&lt;ref&gt;1945 AD 541.&lt;/ref&gt; is an important case in [[South African law]], heard in the Appellate Division on 21 March 1945, with judgment handed down on 15 May, and Watermeyer CJ, Tindall JA, Greenberg JA and Davis AJA presiding.

== Facts ==
On an indictment for attempted [[arson]], it was proved

* that the accused had gone by car to a shop in the early hours of the morning, taking with him [[petrol]] and a tin containing inflammable material;
* that he had placed the tin against the door of the shop and poured petrol into and around it in such a way that the petrol ran under the door into the shop; and
* that he was at this stage interrupted by the arrival of a "native" constable.

The accused was duly convicted.

== Judgment ==
The Appellate Division, upon a question of law reserved, held

* that, since petrol which has been poured out spreads and evaporates quickly, it could legitimately be inferred that the accused was on the point of igniting it at the moment he was interrupted;
* that consequently the placing of the tin and the pouring of the petrol were acts which could properly be regarded as forming part of one continuous operation of setting the building on fire, and not as mere acts of preparation for a subsequent setting on fire; and
* that, therefore, there was evidence upon which the trial judge was entitled to convict.

The principles to be applied in deciding whether the actions of an accused person are mere acts of preparation or amount to an attempt to commit a crime were discussed, and the case of ''[[R v Nlhovo]]''&lt;ref&gt;1921 AD 485.&lt;/ref&gt; applied.

'''The Ralph Rinzler Folklife Archives and Collections''' is housed in the [[Smithsonian Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], United States.  

It is one of the Smithsonian archive collections; as such it serves as a pillar of institutional memory, preserving manuscripts, sound recordings, moving images, and other records of enduring cultural, scientific, historical, and legal value within museums, research centers, governments, businesses, and communities.

The Ralph Rinzler Archives consist of two major collections. The first is the [[Moe Asch|Moses]] and Frances Asch collection, which consists of the original recordings, business records, correspondence, and photographic material that came to the Smithsonian with the purchase of [[Folkways Records]] in 1987.  It also contains recordings on the Paredon, Cook, [[Richard Dyer-Bennet|Dyer-Bennet]], [[Fast Folk]], and Monitor labels that have been subsequently acquired by the Smithsonian. These labels are currently operated by [[Smithsonian Folkways Recordings]].

The Rinzler Archives also houses an extensive collection of recordings documenting ethnic music traditions from around the world, early American country music and bluegrass, blues, and examples of [[American folk music revival|folk revival]] performances on other labels. Listening copies of most of the Folkways catalog are kept in the Archives, and are available to researchers.  

The other major archival collection in the Rinzler Archives consists of the written, audio, and visual records of projects and exhibits sponsored by the Smithsonian Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage: most notably, more than three decades of recordings documenting fieldwork, research and performances related to the annual Smithsonian Folklife Festival (formerly known as the Festival of American Folklife), which takes place each summer on the [[National Mall]] of the United States in Washington, D.C.

The Archives' holdings are global in perspective, and include  such topics as world ethnic performance traditions, historical and spoken word recordings, sounds of science and nature, occupational folklore, and family folklore. The collections are also strong in American, and more specifically Euro-American, African-American, Caribbean, and Native American music and performance traditions. These are living archives, from which recordings and videotapes are regularly issued or reissued for enjoyment and scholarly research.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10313">{{Hungarian language}}
There are numerous [[regular sound correspondence]]s between [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and the other [[Uralic languages]]. For example, Hungarian ''á'' corresponds to [[Khanty language|Khanty]] ''o'' in certain positions, and Hungarian ''h'' corresponds to Khanty ''x'', while Hungarian final ''z'' corresponds to Khanty final ''t''. These can be seen in Hungarian ''ház'' ("house") and Khanty ''xot'' ("house"), or Hungarian ''száz'' ("hundred") and Khanty ''sot'' ("hundred").

Hungarian and [[Khanty language|Khanty]] are closely connected, either genealogically or as part of a [[sprachbund|language area]]. The distance between Hungarian and the Finnic languages is greater, but the correspondences are also regular. The relationship is most obvious when comparing all Uralic languages together, for then individual [[idiosyncrasy|idiosyncrasies]] are averaged out, but here we will just compare Hungarian with [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Estonian language|Estonian]] (two Finnic languages).

==Stop consonants==

===Word-initially===
One important innovation of Hungarian is the [[lenition]] of the [[stop consonant]]s *p *k in initial position.

*Hungarian {{IPA|/f/}} corresponds to Finnish and Estonian {{IPA|/p/}} (compare English ''fish'' to Italian ''pesce''):

The third stop inherited from [[Proto-Uralic]], *t, did not undergo such a change.

===Word-medially===

In the middle of words (note that due to the loss of the word final vocals in the Old Hungarian period these are now at the end of the words), Hungarian has also lenited original stops, but in a different fashion.

* Hungarian {{IPA|/p k/}} correspond to Finnish and Estonian geminate stops {{IPA|/pp kk/}}:

(No examples where a word with original *tt would have survived in both Hungarian and Finnic are known, but cases testifying for the development of *tt to /tt/ in Finnic and /t/ in Hungarian can be set up with the help of the other Uralic languages.)

* Hungarian {{IPA|/d/}} corresponds to Finnish and Estonian {{IPA|/nt/}} (which may alternate with {{IPA|/nn/}}):

(Again, with the help of the other Uralic languages, the analogous developments *mp *ŋk → Hungarian /b g/, Finnic /mp ŋk/ could be supported.)

* Hungarian {{IPA|/z/}} corresponds to Finnish and Estonian {{IPA|/t/}} (which can alternate with {{IPA|/d/}} or zero, and becomes {{IPA|/s/}} before {{IPA|/i/}}):

|-
|''*sükśe''
|''ősz''
|''syksy''

|autumn
|}

==Sibilant consonants==
Two different regular correspondences can be found in Hungarian for Finnish and Estonian {{IPA|/s/}}. The first is Hungarian {{IPA|/s/}}:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Proto-Uralic
!Hungarian
!Finnish 
!Estonian 
!meaning
|-
|''*śata''
|''száz''
|''sata''

|''száj''
|''suu''
|''suu''
|mouth
|-
|''*pesä''
|''fészek''
|''pesä''
|''pesa''
|nest
|}

The second is Hungarian zero:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Proto-Uralic
!Hungarian
!Finnish
!Estonian
!meaning
|-
|''*sewe-''
|''eszik'' : ''ev-''
|''syödä''

|''suoni''
|''soon''
|sinew, (Finnic also) vein
|-
|''*süle''
|''öl''
|''syli''
|''süli''
|bosom
|}

These two correspondences represent two different original consonants. {{IPA|/s/}} : {{IPA|/s/}} is reconstructed as originating in Proto-Uralic *ś, while ∅ : {{IPA|/s/}} is reconstructed as Proto-Uralic *s. Both correspondences can be seen simultaneously in the word for "autumn" (see above under *-k-), from Proto-Uralic *sükśi.

==Sonorant consonants==
* Hungarian liquid consonants {{IPA|/l r/}} correspond to Finnish and Estonian {{IPA|/l r/}}:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Proto-Uralic
!Hungarian
!Finnish
!Estonian
!meaning
|-
|''*ora''
|''ár''

|shoulder
|}
Examples also include 'bit', 'to fear', 'cloud', 'fish', 'winter', 'flat', 'to push', 'bosom' listed above.

'''''Routledge v McKay''''' &lt;ref&gt;''Routledge v McKay'' 1954 1 WLR 615&lt;/ref&gt; is a 1954 [[English contract law]] case, concerning the difference between a [[Contractual term|term]] and a [[Contract law|representation]].



==Facts==
The claimant bought a 1936 [[Douglas (motorcycles)|Douglas]] [[Sidecar|motorcycle outfit]] in a part-exchange deal which required him to pay a balance of £30. The registration documents falsely stated that it was a 1942 model, as a previous owner had earlier modified the bike and had wrongly registered it as a 1942. The current seller had, during negotiations, mentioned the 1942 date, but the actual deal only took place several days later.

==Judgment==
Even though the logbook clearly stated the bike's year as 1942, that statement was a mere representation  and not a contractual term; nor was there any [[misrepresentation]] in this transaction. Furthermore, neither the owner who had made the false registration nor any of the intervening owners were liable to the current owner. The delay between the negotiations and the contract was a contributing factor to the decision.

==Analysis==
A '''[[Contractual term|term]]''' is an integral part of an agreement, whereas a '''[[Contract law|representation]]''' is a pre-contractual statement which remains non-contractual unless and until it is adopted as a term. During negotiations, in the process of [[offer and acceptance]], a representation may take the form of (i) an invitation to treat,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Fisher v Bell]] [1961] 1 QB 394''&lt;/ref&gt; (ii) a request for information,&lt;ref&gt;''Clifton v Palumbo 1944'' [http://lawstudent94.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/clifton-v-palumbo.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  or (iii) a statement of intention;&lt;ref&gt; ''Re Fickus'' 1900 [https://quizlet.com/39952070/chapter-2-contract-formation-cases-flash-cards/]&lt;/ref&gt; but once a valid contract is formed these distinctions serve no further purpose.

'''''Schatzkammer''''', a German word which means ''treasury'' or ''treasure chamber'', is a term used in English for the collection of treasures, especially [[objet d'art]] in precious metals and jewels, of a ruler or other collector which are kept in a secure room and often found in the basement of a palace or castle. It also often included the wider types of object typical of the Renaissance [[cabinet of curiosities]].  A very small but evocative Renaissance room in a tower at [[Lacock Abbey]] was designed for keeping and viewing the treasures of the newly rich owner.

The term is normally used of the collections of European rulers or very wealthy families. Well-known examples are:

* The [[Imperial Treasury, Vienna|Imperial Treasury]] at the [[Hofburg Palace]] in Vienna, Austria.
* The collection of the royal regalia and treasures of the [[Bavaria]]n [[Wittelsbach]] dynasty, housed in the ''[[Residenz, Munich|Residenz]]'' Palace in [[Munich]], [[Germany]].
* The vast collection of the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] [[Monarch]]s of [[Saxony]], kept in the ''[[Grünes Gewölbe]]'' at [[Dresden Castle]] in [[Dresden]], Germany.
* The [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom]] in the [[Tower of London]].
* A display of Bourbon treasures in the basement of the [[Museo del Prado]], Madrid.
* The [[Waddesdon Bequest]], a 19th-century collection of mostly Renaissance treasures now displayed together in the [[British Museum]].
* [[Rosenborg Castle]] in [[Copenhagen]] displays [[objet de vertu]] in silver, ivory and other precious materials, some in the cabinets and treasure rooms (porcelain room, glass room) specially constructed over the centuries by the [[Danish Royal Family|Kings of Denmark]] for their display.  The [[Crown Jewels]] and the [[Danish Crown Regalia]] are displayed in a series of modern galleries built inside an enormous vault in the basement. 

Church establishments also had treasuries where similar objects were kept, which are often now open as museums. Especially important and largely intact examples are:

* The [[Treasury of St. Vitus Cathedral]] in [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]]
* The [[Aachen Cathedral Treasury]] at the [[Aachen Cathedral]] (Germany), one of the most important collections of church cultural artefacts in Europe
* The treasury of [[San Marco]], [[Venice]], which retains a unique collection of [[Byzantine art]], looted during the [[Fourth Crusade]]

Examples outside Europe include:
* The Treasure Rooms of [[Topkapi Palace]] display Ottoman treasures.

[[File:Small throne.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Location of Small Throne Room, within the Winter Palace]]

The '''Small Throne Room''' of the [[Winter Palace]], [[St Petersburg]], also known as the Peter the Great Memorial Hall, was created for Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] in 1833, by the architect [[Auguste de Montferrand]].{{r|Museum}} Following a fire in 1837, in which most of the palace was destroyed, the room was recreated exactly as it had been before by the architect [[Vasily Stasov]].

Designed in a loose [[Baroque]] style, the throne is recessed in an [[apse]] before a [[reredos]], supported by two [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] columns of [[jasper]], which contains a large canvas dedicated to Peter I with [[Minerva]] by [[Jacopo Amigoni]]. In the room proper above [[Dado (architecture)|dado]] height the walls are lined with crimson velvet embellished with double-headed eagles of silver thread, above which is a shallow [[vault (architecture)|vaulted]] ceiling.

Set in the opposing [[lunettes]] beneath the vaulting are paintings depicting the [[Battle of Poltava]] and the [[Battle of Lesnaya]] by Pietro Scotti (1768-1837) and Barnabas Medici. However, the focal point of the room is the [[silver-gilt]] throne of 1731, made in London by the Anglo-French gold-and-silver-smith Nicholas Clausen.{{efn|As to the history of the throne, the State Hermitage Museum [https://web.archive.org/web/20050206022353/http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/05/hm5_1_17.html here] contradicts itself [https://web.archive.org/web/20080924225456/http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/08/hm89_0_1_35.html here]}}

Here, during the era of the Tsars, [[diplomat]]s gathered on New Years Day to offer good wishes to the Tsar.{{sfnp|Budberg|1969|p=201|ps=}} Today, as part of the [[State Hermitage Museum]], this room retains its original decoration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2954">'''Temple Island v New English Teas''' was a case in the England and Wales [[Patents County Court]], heard on 28 November 2011, in which Temple Island Collections Ltd. sued New English Teas Ltd. and Nicholas John Houghton over copyright infringement for using a monochrome image of the [[Houses of Parliament]] and [[London Bridge]]  with a colour picture of a red [[London bus]] on the [[Westminster Bridge]].

==Defence==
The defence turned largely on the fact that similar works had been pre-existent and seen by the defendants before the creation of the image at issue. Some of these images pre-dated the work the claimant had created; some did not. The defence also drew attention to differences between the images.

==Judgment==
Judge [[Colin Birss|Birss]] QC, found for the claimant, as he found "the defendants' work does reproduce a substantial part of the claimant's artistic work."&lt;ref name="Birss"&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWPCC/2012/1.html Judgment]&lt;/ref&gt;

Birss held that, while some aspects of the claimants' work were absent from the offending image, sufficient aspects were present to constitute copyright infringement, conversely he held that the claimant's submission of what would constitute an infringing work was over-broad saying "I am sure there are many things satisfying the claimant's definition which would not infringe."&lt;ref name="Birss" /&gt;

Birss held that defence argument of prior works was irrelevant, since there was on the one hand no claim that the claimants work was influenced by these works, and on the other hand, there was a causal link between the defendants' desire to use an image like the claimant's image and the production of the offending image, that was not disturbed by the search for similar images.&lt;ref name="Birss" /&gt;

==Controversy==
The case caused some controversy, as appearing to widen the scope of copyright protection in the composition of visual images.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amateurphotographer.co.uk/latest/photo-news/photographers-face-copyright-threat-after-shock-ruling-14134|work=Amateur Photographer|title=Photographers face copyright threat after shock ruling}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Intellectual property barrister Jane Lambert expressed unease at the decision, over the move towards protection of idea rather than expression of an idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.techeye.net/software/uk-copyright-law-wades-in-on-photoshopping|title=UK copyright law wades in on photoshopping: Could end up before the beak|author=Nick Farrell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Bandy Papers''''' is a series of novels chronicling the exploits of a [[World War I]] [[fighter ace]] named '''Bartholomew Wolfe Bandy'''. The author, [[Donald Jack]], himself served in the [[RAF]] during World War II.  Every book in the Bandy Papers series contains the word "me" in the title, as do many of the chapter titles, which can also be interpreted as photo captions. The Bandy Papers books are:

#''Three Cheers For Me''&lt;ref name=seq&gt;{{citation |page=392 |chapter=Jack, Donald |title=Sequels: An Annotated Guide to Novels in Series |author=Janet and Jonathan Husband |publisher=American Library Association |year=2009 |isbn=9780838909676}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1962)  This small novel was later expanded into the first 3 volumes:

#''Three Cheers for Me''&lt;ref name=seq/&gt;  (1973)
#''That's Me in the Middle''&lt;ref name=seq/&gt;  (1973)
#''It's Me Again''&lt;ref name=seq/&gt; (1975), also published in two volumes (numbered 3 and 4) as ''It's Me Again'' and ''Me Among the Ruins''
#''Me Bandy, You Cissie''&lt;ref name=seq/&gt; (1979)
#''Me Too''&lt;ref name=seq/&gt; (1983)
#''This One's On Me''&lt;ref name=seq/&gt; (1987)
#''Me So Far''&lt;ref name=seq/&gt; (1989)
#''Hitler vs. Me''&lt;ref name=seq/&gt; (1996)
#''Stalin vs. Me'' (2005)

Bandy was born on July 14, 1893.  Physically he is described as over 6 feet tall and with a face like a horse.  His voice is high pitched and whiney and is said to resemble that of [[W.C. Fields]], whom he once met.  This combination seems to drive most people (and many animals) he meets to dislike him and as a result he has developed a "stone face" to counter these attacks (a defence that often backfires by inciting his enemies to greater levels of malice).  His talents, although well disguised, are real and he has certainly been an influential (though minor) character in history.

Bandy was born and raised in Beamington, in the [[Ottawa Valley]] in [[Ontario]], where his father was a minister.  From his published papers, he seems to have had a difficult time fitting in with his school mates.  There is a reference in ''Me Bandy, You Cissie'' that he was an invalid for a time during his childhood.  He finished school and was at the [[University of Toronto]] Medical School when the First World War broke out.

Bandy volunteered for the infantry in 1916 after being kicked out of medical school and was commissioned as a 2nd lieutenant in the [[Canadian Army]].  After spending some time in the trenches, it was decided that the infantry was not entirely suited to his talents and so he was transferred into the [[Royal Flying Corps]], where he stayed on and off for the rest of the war, until being sent to [[Russia]] to fight [[Bolsheviks]], where he was captured by Red Russian forces at the [[Battle of Tulgas|Battle of Toulgas]] on November 11, 1918. His military career went from the heights of the [[Air Ministry#The Air Board|Air Board]] to the lows of fighting in a [[1st Canadian Division|Bicycle Battalion]].  He left the Air Force in 1920 as a Lieutenant acting Major General!

After the war and his imprisonment in Russia, Bandy had short but illustrious careers in [[silent films]], [[rum-running]], politics, and airplane design. When several of his careers threatened to land him in prison (or worse, Cabinet), Bandy returned to Europe, flying via [[Iceland]], in an attempt to restore his fortunes through the marketing of the Gander, an [[amphibious aircraft]] of his design. His plans came to naught when he lost the Gander during the rescue of a downed aviator in the [[English Channel]]. He was forced to seek employment as a lowly hospital porter until being sought out by the rescued aviator, who turned out to be the son of an [[India]]n [[Maharajah]]. Offered employment in the Maharajah's air force, Bandy continued his long tradition of upsetting the powers that be by accepting this controversial appointment.  This led to him being knighted, but he seldom used his title. It is mentioned that he flew for the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republicans]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]], but this is not detailed.  In [[World War II]], Bandy again fought against [[Germany]] and became reacquainted with a son from a previous adventure. In the final volume of the series, Bandy faces Germany's top fighter pilot in combat before returning to the Soviet Union for the [[Yalta conference]] at the end of the war, where he has to cope with [[Stalin]]'s paranoia and secret police.

The books are noted for their humour and word play, as well as technical and historic accuracy (except possibly in India). Three of the novels featuring Bandy won the [[Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humour]]:  ''Three Cheers for Me''  (1963),  ''That's Me in the Middle'' (1974),  and ''Me Bandy, You Cissie''  (1980).

'''''The Emperor's New Groove''''' is a 2000 American [[Animation|animated]] [[Slapstick film|slapstick]] [[buddy film|buddy]] [[comedy film]] produced by [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Feature Animation]] and released by [[Walt Disney Pictures]]. The 40th [[List of Disney theatrical animated features|animated Disney feature film]], the film was directed by [[Mark Dindal]], written by [[David Reynolds (screenwriter)|David Reynolds]] and starring [[David Spade]], [[John Goodman]], [[Eartha Kitt]], [[Patrick Warburton]] and [[Wendie Malick]]. The film follows a selfish young [[Incan]] emperor named Kuzco who is transformed into a llama by his ex-advisor Yzma. In order for the emperor to change back into a human, he trusts a village leader named Pacha who escorts him back to the palace.

Development for the film began in 1994 where it was conceived as a musical epic titled ''Kingdom of the Sun''. Following his directorial debut with ''[[The Lion King]]'', [[Roger Allers]] recruited English musician [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] to compose songs for the film. Because of the underwhelming box office performances of ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]'' and ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' [[Mark Dindal]] was brought in as co-director in order to add a comedic mood. Due to poor test screenings, creative differences with Dindal and production falling behind schedule, Allers departed the project in which the film shifted from its dramatic musical approach into a more lighthearted comedy film. A documentary about the making of the film, titled ''[[The Sweatbox]]'', details the production troubles that the film endured during its six years of development.

''The Emperor's New Groove'' was released in theaters on December 15, 2000 where it performed disappointingly at the box office compared to the string of successful Disney movies released in the 1990s, grossing $169 million on a $100 million budget, but later found considerably larger success in home media where it became the top-selling DVD release of 2001. It received generally positive reviews from critics who praised it as one of the best films released during Disney's post-[[Disney Renaissance|Renaissance]] era and the most comedic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rotoscopers.com/2013/03/25/are-we-in-a-new-disney-renaissance/|title=Are We In a New Disney Renaissance?|last=Wright|first=Gary|date=March 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] for the song "[[My Funny Friend and Me]]" performed by [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] but lost to "[[Things Have Changed]]" by [[Bob Dylan]] from ''[[Wonder Boys (film)|Wonder Boys]]''. A [[direct-to-video]] sequel to the film titled ''[[Kronk's New Groove]]'', was released in 2005 and an animated television series titled ''[[The Emperor's New School]]'' aired on [[Disney Channel]] from 2006 to 2008.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words! --&gt;
Narrated by himself throughout the film, Kuzco is the 18-year-old selfish and egotistical emperor of the [[Inca]] kingdom who routinely punishes anyone who disappoints him or "throw off his groove". Kuzco meets up with Pacha, a kind peasant and village leader, and tells him that he plans to demolish Pacha's hilltop family home to build himself a lavish summer resort called "Kuzcotopia", leaving Pacha despondent. When Kuzco later fires his conniving adviser [[Yzma]], she, along with her dim-witted henchman Kronk, plots to take the throne. The pair attempt to poison the emperor at dinner, but due to a mix up with the labels on Yzma's vials, they inadvertently give him a potion that transforms him into a [[llama]]. When the two knock Kuzco unconscious and stuff him in a sack, Yzma orders Kronk to dispose of him. Kronk has a stroke of conscience and saves him, but unfortunately misplaces the sack on a cart belonging to Pacha.

Pacha returns home, unaware of the unconscious llama on his cart. When he wakes, Kuzco blames Pacha for his transformation and orders him to return him to the capital. Pacha offers to do so only if Kuzco changes his mind about Kuzcotopia, to which Kuzco at first refuses. However, after running afoul of the local wildlife, he accepts Pacha's offer, secretly planning to go back on his word once he is safe. The two survive many ordeals in the jungle, and Pacha finds Kuzco has a good side to him underneath his ego. Meanwhile, Yzma has taken the throne, but soon learns that Kronk failed to kill Kuzco. The two set out to find Kuzco.

Both pairs arrive at a jungle diner at the same time. Pacha overhears Yzma's plan to kill him, but Kuzco does not believe him, thinking that Yzma and Kronk are out to rescue him. However, Kuzco soon overhears more of Yzma and Kronk's scheming. Thinking no one in his kingdom misses him, he leaves the diner on his own, planning on living out his days as a llama. Pacha catches up, still willing to help Kuzco return to normal. Kuzco apologizes for his selfishness and they set off for Pacha's house to resupply.

When they arrive, Yzma is already there. Pacha has his family stall Yzma, giving him and Kuzco a head start back to the capital. They head to Yzma's laboratory and numerous transformation potions, including the antidote, but Yzma and Kronk have somehow arrived first. Yzma orders Kronk to kill the pair, but he refuses and attempts to turn on her. After dropping him down a trap door, she orders her guards to capture the pair under the pretense that they killed the emperor. Pacha grabs a handful of vials, while he and Kuzco flee, trying the various vials during their flight to find the right one. As they are cornered on the ledges of a giant wall structure, they find they are down to two vials. During a scuffle, Yzma falls onto one of the vials and is transformed into a "helpless" [[kitten]]. After some hi-jinx, Kuzco and Pacha recover the other vial to which Kuzco drinks it.

Now human again and a more selfless ruler, Kuzco takes Pacha's suggestion of moving Kuzcotopia over to a neighbouring, unoccupied hill next to Pacha's village. Some time later, Kuzco joins Pacha and his family at his modest resort while elsewhere Kronk has become a [[scout leader]] and trains a new batch of scouts, including the reluctant Yzma, who remains a kitten.

===''Kingdom of the Sun''===
{{Quote box|width =45%|quote="''Kingdom of the Sun'' was such a heart-breaking experience for me. I put four years of my heart and energy into that one... I was creating an "epic" picture mixing elements of adventure, comedy, romance and mysticism. The head of Disney Features at the time was afraid that we were doing, in his opinion, too many films in the same vein. He was also uncomfortable with the spiritual and cultural (Inca) aspects of it. Hence, he decided to make it a simple slapstick comedy... Would it have worked out if we had had more time?

In 1996, the production crew traveled to [[Machu Picchu]] in [[Peru]], to study Inca artifacts and architecture and the landscape this empire was created in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2000-12-15/entertainment/0012150016_1_sting-empires-emperor | title=Royal Pain But The Agonizing Pays Off | last=Moore | first=Roger | newspaper=[[Orlando Sentinel]] | date=December 15, 2000 | accessdate=February 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#DVD2|''Supplemental Features: The Research Trip]]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kingdom of the Sun'' was to have been a tale of a greedy, selfish [[emperor]] (voiced by David Spade) who finds a [[peasant]] (voiced by [[Owen Wilson]]) who looks just like him; the emperor swaps places with the peasant to escape his boring life and have fun, much as in author [[Mark Twain]]'s [[archetype|archetypal]] novel ''[[The Prince and the Pauper]]''. However, the villainous witch Yzma has plans to summon [[Supay]] (the evil god of death), and destroy the [[sun]] so that she may become young and beautiful forever (the sun gives her wrinkles, so she surmises that living in a world of darkness would prevent her from aging). Discovering the switch between the prince and the peasant, Yzma turns the real emperor into a llama and threatens to reveal the pauper's identity unless he obeys her. During his time as the emperor and doing Yzma's orders, the pauper falls in love with the emperor's soon to be fiancé Nina (voiced by [[Carla Gugino]]) who thinks he is the emperor that has changed his ways. Meanwhile, the emperor-llama learns humility in his new form and even comes to love a female llama-herder named Mata (voiced by [[Laura Prepon]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inspectorcleuzo.blogspot.com/2014/05/from-90s-emperors-new-groove-almost.html | title=From the 90's – The Emperor's New Groove Almost Made it Character | first=Sandro | last=Cleuzo | publisher=inspectorcleuzo.blogspot.com | date=May 1, 2014 | accessdate=February 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, the girl and the llama set out to undo the witch's plans.

Following the underwhelming box office performances of ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]'' and ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'', studio executives felt the project was growing too ambitious and serious for audiences following test screenings, and felt it needed more comedy.&lt;ref name="KingdomoftheSun"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hill|first=Jim|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040902115852/http://www.laughingplace.com/News-PID115140-115141.asp#|url=http://www.laughingplace.com/News-PID115140-115142.asp|title=The Long Story Behind the Emperor's New Groove|publisher=The Laughing Place|date=May 25, 2001|archivedate=September 2, 2004|accessdate=February 8, 2015|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1997, producer [[Randy Fullmer]] contacted [[Mark Dindal]], who had just wrapped up work on ''[[Cats Don't Dance]]'', and offered him to be co-director on ''Kingdom of the Sun''.&lt;ref name="Dindal interview"&gt;{{cite interview |interviewer=Joe Strike |subject=Mark Dindal |title=Mark Dindal's Place in the Sun |url=http://www.awn.com/mag/issue5.08/5.08pages/strikedindal.php3 |accessdate=February 8, 2015 |date=November 18, 2000 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208082024/http://www.awn.com/mag/issue5.08/5.08pages/strikedindal.php3# |archivedate=February 8, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Allers personally called [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], in the wake of [[Elton John]]'s success with ''[[The Lion King]]'s'' [[The Lion King (soundtrack)|soundtrack]], to compose several songs for the film.&lt;ref name="Sweatbox"/&gt; He agreed, but on the condition that his filmmaker wife [[Trudie Styler]] could "document the process of the production".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2002/film/reviews/the-sweatbox-1200545932/ | title=Review: 'The Sweatbox' | last=Harvey | first=David | newspaper=Variety | accessdate=February 8, 2015 | date=September 27, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; This film, which was eventually entitled ''[[The Sweatbox]]'', was made by Xingu Films (their own production company).

In the summer of 1997, it was announced that [[Roger Allers]] and [[Mark Dindal]] would serve as the film's directors and [[Randy Fullmer]] as producer.

By the summer of 1998, it was apparent that ''Kingdom of the Sun'' was not far along enough in production to be released in the summer of 2000 as planned.

Allers acknowledged that the production was falling behind, but was confident that, with an extension of between six months to a year, he could complete the film.

In February 2000, the new film was announced as ''The Emperor's New Groove'' with its new story centering on a spoiled Inca Emperor – voiced by David Spade – who through various twists and falls ends up learning the meaning of true happiness from a poor peasant, played by John Goodman. The release date was scheduled for December 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.empireonline.com/News/story.asp?nid=14893 | title=Hot News: Disney's Dynamic Slate | work=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]] | date=February 1, 2000 | accessdate=February 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the phrasing of the title, the film bears no relation to [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s classic Danish fairy tale "[[The Emperor's New Clothes]]" (although both stories involve an emperor being tricked).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2000-12-15/entertainment/0012150014_1_fred-flintstone-eartha-kitt-emperor | title=A Toon Just For Fun | last=Boyar | first=Jay | date=December 1, 2000 | newspaper=[[Orlando Sentinel]] | accessdate=February 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to Mark V. Moorhead of the ''[[Houston Press]]'', the film's plot does bear some resemblance to that of ''[[The Golden Ass]]'' by [[Apuleius|Lucius Apuleius]], wherein a man is turned into a donkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houstonpress.com/film/jonesing-for-a-new-groove-6562706 | title=Jonesing for a New Groove | last=Moorhead | first=Mark V. | date=December 14, 2000 | newspaper=[[Houston Press]] | accessdate=November 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eisner worried that the new story was too close in tone to Disney's 1997 film ''[[Hercules (1997 film)|Hercules]]'', which had performed decently yet below expectations at the American box office. Dindal and Fullmer assured him that ''The Emperor's New Groove'', as the film was now called, would have a much smaller cast, making it easier to involve audiences. Towards the end of production, the film's ending originally had Kuzco building his Kuzcotopia amusement park on another hill by destroying a rainforest near Pacha's home, and inviting Pacha and his family to visit. Horrified at the ending, Sting commented that "I wrote them a letter and said, 'You do this, I'm resigning because this is exactly the opposite of what I stand for. I've spent 20 years trying to defend the rights of indigenous people and you're just marching over them to build a theme park. I will not be party to this."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nme.com/news/sting/5632#e3t6KxDixZBPcZUd.99 | title=STING FORCES DISNEY TO CHECK ITS '...GROOVE' | date=December 12, 2000 | work=[[NME|New Musical Express]] | accessdate=February 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ending was rewritten so that Kuzco constructs a shack similar to Pacha's and spends his vacation among the villagers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DVD2|''Supplemental Features – Deleted and Unused Scenes, Including 'Destruction of Pacha's Village,' 'Pacha's Family' and 'Original Kuscotopia Ending''']]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design and animation===
During production on ''Kingdom of the Sun'', [[Andreas Deja]] was the initial supervising animator of Yzma, and incorporated [[Supermodel|supermodeling poses]] published in magazines in order to capture Yzma's sultry, seductive persona.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andreasdeja.blogspot.com/2011/09/early-yzma.html | title=Early Yzma | last=Deja | first=Andreas | date=September 25, 2011 | publisher=andreasdeja.blogspot.com | accessdate=February 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nik Ranieri]] was originally slated as the supervising animator for Yzma's rocky sidekick, Hucua. During the research trip to Peru in 1996, Ranieri acknowledged that "I was researching for a character that looked like a rock so I was stuck drawing rocks for the whole trip.

I really enjoyed developing the character and doing some early test animation on her as well. Before I left the film (and it was ultimately shelved), I created model sheets for not only Snowball, but for the rest of the herd of seven other llamas and for Kuzco as a Llama."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|url=http://animatedviews.com/2009/oliver-co-animator-dave-pruiksma/ | title=Once Upon A Time In New York City: Oliver &amp; Company Animator Dave Pruiksma! | interviewer=Jérémie Noyer | subject=[[David Pruiksma]] | publisher=Animated Views | date=January 30, 2009 | accessdate=February 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the film was placed on production shutdown, Pruiksma transferred to work on ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]'' being developed concurrently and ultimately the llama characters were dropped from the storyline.&lt;ref name="Pruiksma" /&gt;

Following the production overhaul and the studio's attempts for more cost-efficient animated features, Mark Dindal urged for "a simpler approach that emphasized the characters rather than overwhelming special effects or cinematic techniques".&lt;ref name="animators" /&gt; Because of the subsequent departure of Deja, animator [[Dale Baer|Dale L. Baer]] inherited the character of Yzma. Using Eartha Kitt's gestures during recording sessions, Baer commented that "She has a natural voice for animation and really got into the role. She would gesture wildly and it was fun just to watch her. She would come into each session almost serious and very professional and suddenly she would go wild and break up laughing."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Amry|title=New groove to an old legend| newspaper=[[New Straits Times]] |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |accessdate=February 13, 2015 |date=March 18, 2001 |first=Shareem |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-82582318.html}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ranieri was later asked to serve as the supervising animator of Kuzco (as a human and a llama), though he would admit being reluctant at first until he discovered that Kuzco "had a side to him, there was a lot of comedy potential and as a character he went through an arc".&lt;ref name="Ranieri" /&gt; Pudleiner was also reassigned to work as an animator of the human version of Kuzco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.glendalenewspress.com/2000-12-20/news/export42362_1_kuzco-animators-mark-dindal | title=Keeping Disney's 'Emperor' in the groove | last=Tolford | first=Katherine | newspaper=[[Glendale News-Press]] | location=[[Glendale, California]] | date=December 20, 2000 | accessdate=February 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to drawing inspiration from David Spade during recording sessions, the Kuzco animation team studied llamas at the zoo, visited a llama farm, watched nature documentaries, and even observed the animals up close when they came for a visit to the studio.&lt;ref name="animators" /&gt; For the rewritten version of Pacha, animator [[Bruce W. Smith]] observed that "Pacha is probably the most human of all the characters," and further added that he "has more human mannerisms and realistic traits, which serve as a contrast to the cartoony llama he hangs out with. He is the earthy guy who brings everything back into focus. Being a big fellow about six-foot-five and weighing about 250 pounds we had to work hard to give him a sense of weight and believability in his movement."&lt;ref name="animators"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemareview.com/production.asp?prodid=1199 | title=The Emperor's New Groove – Animating The Characters | publisher=Cinema Review | accessdate=February 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the release date had shifted to winter 2000, similarities were noted between the film and [[DreamWorks Animation]]'s ''[[The Road to El Dorado]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Road to El Dorado Preview | url=http://www.ew.com/article/2000/02/11/road-el-dorado | newspaper=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=February 11, 2000 | accessdate=February 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marc Lument, a visual development artist on ''El Dorado'', claimed "It really was a race, and [[Jeffrey Katzenberg|Katzenberg]] wanted ours out before theirs." Lument also added that, "We didn't know exactly what they were doing, but we had the impression it was going to be very similar. Whoever came out second would face the impression that they copied the other."&lt;ref name="dreamworks" /&gt; Fullmer and Dindal denied the similarities with the latter commenting "This version [''The Emperor's New Groove''] was well in the works when that movie came out," and further added "Early on, when our movie got to be very comic, all of us felt that you can't be making this farce about a specific group of people unless we are going to poke fun at ourselves. This didn't seem to be a proper choice about Incas or any group of people.

Because of its pre-Columbian setting and Latin American flavor, Disney spent $250,000 in its marketing campaign towards the Latino market releasing dual English and Spanish-language theatrical prints in sixteen multiplexes across heavily populated Latino areas in [[Los Angeles, California]] in contrast to releasing dubbed or subtitled theatrical prints of their previous animated features in foreign markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/dec/16/news/mn-754 | title=Disney Seeks New 'Groove' With Dual-Language Release | last2=Romney | first2=Lee | last1=Eller | first1=Claudia | newspaper=Los Angeles Times | date=December 16, 2000 | accessdate=February 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By January 2001, following nineteen days into its theatrical general release, the Spanish-dubbed prints were pulled from multiplexes as Latino Americans opted to watch the English-language prints with its grossing averaging $571,000 in comparison to $96,000 for the former.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jan/09/business/fi-10087 | title=In Disney Experiment, Spanish Speakers Prefer English 'Groove' | last2=Romney | first2=Lee | last1=Eller | first1=Claudia | newspaper=Los Angeles Times | date=January 9, 2001 | accessdate=February 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Published in ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]'', Marc Savlov gave the film 2/5 stars noting the film "suffers from a persistent case of narrative backsliding that only serves to make older members of the audience long for the days of the dwarves, beauties, and poisoned apples of Disney-yore, and younger ones squirm in their seats". Savlov continued to express his displeasure in the animation in comparison to the previous year's ''[[Tarzan (1999 film)|Tarzan]]'' writing it "is also a minor letdown, with none of the ecstatic visual tour de force."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/calendar/film/2000-12-15/141749/ | last=Sovlov | first=Marc | title=The Emperor's New Groove review | newspaper=[[The Austin Chronicle]] | date=December 15, 2000 | accessdate=February 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Movie reviewer Bob Strauss acknowledged the film is "funny, frantic and colorful enough to keep the small fry diverted for its short but strained 78 minutes", though except for "some nice voice work, a few impressive scale gags and interesting, Inca-inspired design elements, there is very little here for the rest of the family to latch onto". Strauss would target the massive story overhaul during production as the main problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=With Groove, Disney's in a Rut|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/WITH+'GROOVE%2c'+DISNEY'S+IN+A+RUT.-a083411452 | last=Strauss | first=Bob | work=[[Los Angeles Daily News]] | date=December 15, 2000 | accessdate=February 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, ''The Emperor's New Groove'' was named the 16th best Disney animated film by [[IGN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/06/29/the-25-best-disney-animated-movies|title=The 25 Best Disney Animated Movies|publisher=IGN|date=June 29, 2018|accessdate=June 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Sweatbox''==
{{main|The Sweatbox}}

''The Sweatbox'' is a documentary that chronicled the tumultuous collaboration of Sting and David Hartley with the Disney studios to compose six songs for ''Kingdom of the Sun'' (the film's working title).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/film-to-capture-stings-disney-fiasco-20001214 | title=Film to Capture Sting's Disney Fiasco | last=Uhelszki | first=Jaan | newspaper=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]] | date=December 14, 2000 | accessdate=February 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documentary featured interviews from directors [[Roger Allers]] and [[Mark Dindal]], producer [[Randy Fullmer]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] (whose wife created the documentary), Disney story artists, and the voice cast being dismayed by the new direction. Disney was not believed to be opposing Trudie Styler's documentary with Disney animation executive Thomas Schumacher, who had seen footage, commenting that "I think it's going to be great!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Sting makes up with Disney after animated musical bust-up | url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/dec/15/news1 | newspaper=The Guardian | date=15 December 2000 | accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film premiered at the [[2002 Toronto International Film Festival]], but has gone virtually unseen by the public ever since. Disney owns the rights, but has never officially released it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gawker.com/5896027/stings-suppressed-disney-documentary-leaked-online |title=Sting's Suppressed Disney Documentary Leaked Online |first=Rich |last=Juzwaik |publisher=[[Gawker]] |date=March 23, 2012 |accessdate=February 14, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215054754/http://gawker.com/5896027/stings-suppressed-disney-documentary-leaked-online |archivedate=February 15, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2012, a workprint of the documentary was leaked online and was uploaded onto [[YouTube]], by a United Kingdom cartoonist, before it was ultimately pulled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/disney/the-sweatbox-the-documentary-disney-doesnt-want-you-to-see-59467.html | title="The Sweatbox", the Documentary That Disney Doesn't Want You to See | last=Amidi | first=Amid | publisher=[[Cartoon Brew]] | date=March 22, 2012 | accessdate=February 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of April 2015, some scenes from the documentary could be seen from the home media release, including the behind the scenes and the making of ''My Funny Friend and Me.''

==Expanded franchise==
{{main|The Emperor's New Groove (franchise)}}

In April 2005, it was announced that [[DisneyToon Studios]] was producing a [[direct-to-video]] sequel titled ''[[Kronk's New Groove]]'' which was released on December 13, 2005, followed by an animated television series on [[Disney Channel]] titled ''[[The Emperor's New School]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=DisneyToon Studios is producing sequels to "The Emperor's New Groove" and "Brother Bear".|newspaper=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |accessdate=February 8, 2015|date=April 6, 2005 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-131972711.html}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patrick Warburton]], [[Eartha Kitt]] and [[Wendie Malick]] reprised their roles for the sequel and series while [[J.P. Manoux]] replaced [[David Spade]] for the series and [[Fred Tatasciore]] voiced Pacha in season 1. John Goodman subsequently reprises his role for the second and final season for the series.

Kuzco appears as a guest in the animated television series, ''[[Disney's House of Mouse]]'', and its direct-to-video spin-off film ''[[Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse]]''.

[[The Emperor's New Groove (video game)|Two video games]] were developed and released concurrent with the film. The first, for the Sony [[PlayStation]], was developed by [[Argonaut Games]] and published by [[Sony Interactive Entertainment|Sony Computer Entertainment of America]]. The second, for the Nintendo [[Game Boy Color]], was developed by Sandbox and published by [[Ubisoft]]. Both titles were released in PAL territories the following year. The PlayStation version was re-released for the North American [[PlayStation Network]] on July 27, 2010.

The [[Tokyo DisneySea]] rollercoaster attraction ''[[Raging Spirits]]'' took visual inspiration for its Inca ruins theme from the buildings in the film with a structure based on Kuzco's palace similarly crowning the ruins site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mouseinfo.com/forums/tokyo-disney-resort/15952-tds-new-coaster-name-raging-spirits.html |title=TDS: New Coaster Name "Raging Spirits" |publisher=Mouseinfo.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Penguin Guide To Compact Discs and Cassettes.jpg|thumb|250px|top]]
{{Italic title}}
'''''The Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music''''' (formerly '''''The Penguin Guide to Compact Discs''''' and, from 2003 to 2006, '''''The Penguin Guide to Compact Discs and DVDs''''') was a widely distributed annual publication from [[UK|Britain]] published by [[Penguin Books]] that reviewed and rated currently available recordings of [[European classical music|classical music]].  It was written by Ivan March, a music journalist, consultant and former professional musician; [[Edward Greenfield]], former music critic of ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper and [[Robert Layton (musician)|Robert Layton]], music writer and lecturer.  All three were also reviewers for the UK classical music periodical ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]''.  From 2008-2010, a fourth contributor was listed also as a co-author, Paul Czajkowski, who had been listed an editor from the 2002 book.

The ''Guide'' was often found in the classical departments of record stores.  In earlier editions, the Guide awarded each recording a rating of between one and three stars, with extraordinarily favoured recordings receiving a [[rosette (decoration)|rosette]].  From 2007-2010, the publication used four stars to denote records which are "exceptional issue[s] on every count". [[DVD]]s of [[opera]]s and classical music concerts and [[Super Audio Compact Disc]]s were also reviewed.

==Ratings==
As provided by ''The Penguin Guide To Recorded Classical Music'':

* Rosette: A rosette is a compliment that places the recording in a very special class.
* 4 Stars: A very exceptional issue on every count.
* 3 Stars: An outstanding performance and recording of the calibre we now take for granted.
* 2 Stars: A good performance and recording of today's normal high standard.
* 1 Star: A fair or somewhat routine performance, reasonably well performed or recorded.

NOTE: A star in brackets means there is some qualification to the performance or recording.  A  bracket around all three stars usually denotes an outstanding historic performance, usually in [[monaural|mono]].

==History==
The guidebook first appeared in 1960 as ''[[The Stereo Record Guide]]'', in response to the then recent emergence of [[stereo]] [[Gramophone record|LP]] recordings. Up to 1968 the writing team comprised Ivan March, Edward Greenfield and [[Denis Stevens]]. [[Penguin Books]], having published guides to bargain records (1966, 1970 and 1972), began publishing the guides in 1975. At that time, as the reviewers concede&lt;ref&gt;''2006 Penguin Guide'', p. vii&lt;/ref&gt; it was then possible to include almost all stereo recordings in the field.

Additional volumes were printed to cover cassettes, and in the 1984 Guide [[compact discs]] were added for the first time. By the 1990 revision so completely had CDs come to dominate that LPs were omitted altogether. Since 1997, the main guide was supplemented by alternately published 'yearbooks', adding new recordings and recommended issues for that particular year. Several other supplementary volumes were released covering 'bargain' recordings. Additionally, after 2003, classical music DVDs were incorporated, initially as an appendix, but, from the 2006 edition, in the main body of the reviews themselves.

Whilst these other volumes added further reviews, the authors admitted&lt;ref&gt;''2006 Penguin Guide'', p. xi&lt;/ref&gt; that attempting to cover all releases was impossible, and instead only the 'cream' of available recordings could be covered.

This more selective approach, coupled with a perceived British bias, led to criticism, on internet newsgroups and elsewhere.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} However, as even some critics agreed&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2003/Nov03/Penguin_guide.htm Review of 2004 edition]&lt;/ref&gt; a project on this scale and on this topic (inevitably a subjective affair) could not have been expected to suit all perspectives.

The final edition of the Guide was the 2010 edition, published in November, 2009.  Subsequently, for two years, the authors collaborated on a ''Penguin Guide to the 1000 Finest Classical Recordings: The Must-Have CDs and DVDs'', less authoritative than the previous Guide and less than half its length. No related publication has been issued since September, 2012.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

'''Vanessa Leggett''' (née '''Levrier'''; born May 18, 1968) is a freelance journalist, author, lecturer and [[First Amendment]] advocate who was jailed by the [[U.S. Justice Department]] for 168 days for protecting sources and research notes for an independent book about a federal murder-for-hire case. It is the longest contempt-of-court imprisonment of a journalist in [[United States]] history for protecting sources.&lt;ref name="austinchronicle.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/books/2002-02-22/84702/|title=True Crime and Punishment|author=|date=|website=The Austin Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Leggett, the daughter of a Houston oil trader, earned her bachelor's degree in English and a master's degree in liberal arts from the [[University of St. Thomas (Texas)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/11/us/public-lives-when-a-writer-is-punished-for-not-being-an-author.html|title=When a Writer Is Punished for Not Being an Author|author=|date=11 August 2001|website=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case history==
In April 1997, the body of [[Houston, Texas]], socialite [[Doris Angleton]] was discovered in her home. She died from 13 gunshot wounds to her face and chest. At the time of the death, her twin daughters and husband, Robert Angleton, a millionaire and former bookie,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newseuminstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Jailed-subpoenaed-timeline1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; were at a softball game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houstonpress.com/news/murder-she-testified-6561285|title=Murder, She Testified|first=Steve|last=McVicker|date=19 July 2001|website=Houston Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leggett researched the case for five years. In 1998, in a jailhouse interview of Roger Angleton, a suspect in a murder-for-hire plot. Leggett compiled notes and hours of audio tape that reportedly detailed how Roger's brother Robert hired him to murder his brother's wife Doris. The interviews occurred just before Roger's suicide in his Harris County jail cell and before Robert's trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/oh-brother/|title=Oh, Brother|author=|date=31 May 1998|website=texasmonthly.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 19, 2001, U.S. District Judge [[Melinda Harmon]] ordered Leggett to appear in court the next day with her notes and tapes for a book she was researching about the murder. The order was in response to a grand jury that had convened to investigate the possibility of filing federal murder charges against the victim's husband, Robert Angleton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corporate.findlaw.com/litigation-disputes/vanessa-leggett-serves-maximum-jail-time-first-amendment-based.html|title=Vanessa Leggett Serves Maximum Jail Time, First Amendment-Based Reporter's Privilege Under {{Sic|Sei|ge|hide=y}} |author=|date=|publisher=FindLaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leggett, appearing in court on June 20, 2001, refused to turn over her notes, citing [[freedom of the press]]. She was then held in civil contempt of court and jailed by the [[U.S. Justice Department]] for refusing to turn over her notes.&lt;ref name="austinchronicle.com"/&gt;

News organizations, publications and journalists championed Leggett's case, advocating that the public

The [[Center for Individual Freedom]] filed an amicus brief in support of Leggett's petition asking the U.S. Supreme Court to hear her case. The center also contributed to her legal defense fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfif.org/htdocs/legal_issues/legal_activities/amicus_briefs/center_files_brief.htm|title=Center Files Brief on Behalf of Vanessa Leggett|first=Copyright: Unless provided otherwise, all materials and contents of this website are copyrighted and certain logos, slogans and other marks are protected under trademark laws.

She was released on January 4, 2002, after serving the maximum sentence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corporate.findlaw.com/litigation-disputes/vanessa-leggett-serves-maximum-jail-time-first-amendment-based.html|title=Vanessa Leggett Serves Maximum Jail Time, First Amendment-Based Reporter's Privilege Under {{sic|Sei|ge|hide=y}} |author=|date=|website=findlaw.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Federal Detention Center, Houston|Houston Federal Detention Center]] after 168 days of incarceration on the civil contempt charge when the federal grand jury completed its term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcfp.org/browse-media-law-resources/news/vanessa-leggett-released-jail-after-168-days|title=Vanessa Leggett released from jail after 168 days - Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press|author=|date=26 October 2011|website=www.rcfp.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leggett said to reporters as she walked out of jail, "This is not so much about me. It's about the public's right to a free and independent press."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://supreme.findlaw.com/legal-commentary/who-counts-as-a-journalist-for-first-amendment-purposes.html|title=Who Counts As A Journalist, For First Amendment Purposes?  - FindLaw|author=|date=|website=Findlaw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After her release, Leggett, appearing on the ''[[Charlie Rose (TV series)|Charlie Rose]]'' show in April 2004, said, "(My sources) had taken a chance by cooperating with me and giving me information and trusting me with that information. And I felt obligated to honor that. When I realized that underlying this was an assault on the 1st Amendment, it became something much larger than just my sources or just my book. It was about protecting the free flow of information to the public."&lt;ref name="charlierose.com"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1235">A '''visual dictionary''' is a [[dictionary]] that primarily uses pictures to illustrate the meaning of [[word]]s.  Visual dictionaries are often organized by themes, instead of being an [[alphabetical]] list of words.  For each theme, an image is labeled with the correct word to identify each component of the item in question.  Visual dictionaries can be [[monolingual]] or [[multilingual]], providing the names of items in several [[language]]s.  An index of all defined words is usually included to assist finding the correct illustration that defines the word.

Some international visual dictionary publishers include [[Oxford University Press]], [[QA International]] and [[Dorling Kindersley]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4191">The '''Yahoo! Cloud Serving Benchmark''' (YCSB) is an open-source specification and program suite for evaluating retrieval and maintenance capabilities of computer programs. It is often used to compare relative performance of [[NoSQL]] database management systems.

The original benchmark was developed by workers in the research division of [[Yahoo!]] who released it in 2010 with the stated goal of "facilitating performance comparisons of the new generation
of cloud data serving systems", particularly for transaction-processing workloads which differed from ones measured by benchmarks designed for more traditional database management systems.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cs.duke.edu/courses/fall13/cps296.4/838-CloudPapers/ycsb.pdf|title=Benchmarking cloud serving systems with YCSB|last=Cooper|first=Brian F|date=|website=|publisher=Yahoo Research|access-date=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

YCSB was contrasted with the TPC-H benchmark from the  [[Transaction Processing Performance Council]], with YCSB being called a [[big data]] benchmark while TPC-H is a [[decision support system]] benchmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Melyssa Barata, Jorge Bernadino and Pedro Furtado |date= June 27, 2014 |title= YCSB and TPC-H: Big Data and Decision Support Benchmarks |publisher= IEEE |work= 2014 International Congress on Big Data |url= http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6906872&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D6906872|display-authors=etal |doi= 10.1109/BigData.Congress.2014.128 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

YCSB was used by DBMS vendors for "benchmark marketing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= YCSB benchmark notes |last= Monash |first= Curt |url= http://www.dbms2.com/2013/01/17/ycsb-benchmark-notes |publisher= Monash Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been used in scholarly or tutorial discussions, particularly for [[Apache HBase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= YCSB+T: Benchmarking web-scale transactional databases |last1= Dey |first1= Akon |last2= Nambiar |first2= Raghunath |publisher= IEEE |url= http://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings/icdew/2014/3481/00/06818330.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= HBase Administration Cookbook |last= Jiang |first=Lifeng |year= 2012 |publisher= Packt Publishing |url=
