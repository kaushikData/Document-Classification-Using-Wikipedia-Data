'''Abdalqadir as-Sufi''' (born '''Ian Dallas''' in [[Ayr, Scotland|Ayr]], [[Scotland]] in 1930) is a [[Shaykh of Sufism|Shaykh of Instruction]], leader of the [[Darqawa|Darqawi-Shadhili-Qadiri Tariqa]], founder of the [[Murabitun World Movement]] and author of numerous books on [[Islam]], [[Sufism]] and political theory. Born in Scotland, he was a playwright and actor before he converted to Islam in 1967 with the [[Imam]] of the [[University of Al Karaouine|Qarawiyyin Mosque]] in [[Fez, Morocco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Henderson |first=Barney |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/7271752/Radical-Muslim-leader-has-past-in-swinging-London.html |title=Radical Muslim leader has past in swinging London |publisher=Telegraph |date=20 February 2010 |accessdate=27 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
{{Islam}}
Ian Dallas was born in Scotland in 1930 of a [[Scottish Highlands|Highland]] family. He travelled extensively in [[Greece]], France and Italy.&lt;ref name="CWID"&gt;From 'The Collected Works' by Ian Dallas&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963 he acted in [[Federico Fellini]]'s film ''[[8½]]'' as "Il partner della telepata".&lt;ref&gt;[[:imdbname:0198037|IMDB Filmography]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conversion==
As-Sufi converted to Islam in 1967 in Fes, Morocco as ''Abdalqadir'', witnessed by Abdalkarim Daudi, the Imam Khatib of the Qarawiyyin Mosque, and Alal al-Fasi. He then joined the Darqawi order as a student of [[Muhammad ibn al-Habib]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/ABewley/habib.html  |title=Shaykh Muhammad ibn al-Habib al-Filâlî |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=6 September 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071108232207/http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/ABewley/habib.html |archivedate = 8 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He travelled [[Morocco]] and [[Algeria]] with his [[Shaykh of Sufism|Shaykh]] and was further instructed in Sufism by [[Sidi]] Hamud ibn al-Bashir of Blida and Sidi Fudul al-Huwari ''as-Sufi'' of Fes.&lt;ref name="CWID"/&gt;

==Teaching==
Abdalqadir as-Sufi advocates adherence to the original legal school of Islam, the tradition of the people of [[Medina]]&lt;ref name="ABIHP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/ABewley/  |title=Aisha Bewley's Islamic Home Page |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=6 September 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080803071253/http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/ABewley/ |archivedate = 3 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; as recorded by [[Malik ibn Anas]], since he considers this the primal formulation of Islamic society and a necessity for the re-establishment of Islam in the current age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bewley.virtualave.net/Root.html |title=Root Islamic Education |publisher=Bewley.virtualave.net |date= |accessdate=6 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abdalqadir has been responsible for the establishment of the Ihsan Mosque in  Norwich, England,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.muslimsofnorwich.org.uk |title=Ihsan Mosque, Norwich, UK |publisher=Muslimsofnorwich.org.uk |date=9 March 2010 |accessdate=6 September 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828034457/http://www.muslimsofnorwich.org.uk/ |archivedate=28 August 2010 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Great Mosque of Granada,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.granadamosque.com The Great Mosque of Granada], Spain&lt;/ref&gt; and the Jumu'a Mosque of [[Cape Town]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jumuamosquect.com/ The Jumu'a Mosque of Cape Town] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817081709/http://www.jumuamosquect.com/ |date=17 August 2011 }}, South Africa&lt;/ref&gt;

Abdalqadir as-Sufi teaches that suicide terrorism is forbidden under Islamic law, that its psychological pattern stems from [[nihilism]],&lt;ref&gt;Fatwa on Suicide as a Tactic, [Madinah Press] 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; and that it "draws attention away from the fact that capitalism has failed." 
He has stated that Britain is on "the edge of terminal decline" and that only Britain's Muslim population can "revitalise this ancient realm".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/7271752/Radical-Muslim-leader-has-past-in-swinging-London.html Radical Muslim leader has past in swinging London], [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] 21 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He has written extensively on the importance of monarchy and personal rule.&lt;ref&gt;Political Renewal, [Budgate Press] 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
He also regards the face-veil (or [[Niqāb|Niqab]]) of Muslim women as unislamic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.shaykhabdalqadir.com/2006/10/23/lifting-the-veil-on-the-veil-issue/ |title= Lifting the Veil on the Veil Issue By Shaykh Dr. Abdalqadir as-Sufi |publisher= Shaykhabdalqadir.com |date= |accessdate= 25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; describing it as an "evil hinduisation of women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.shaykhabdalqadir.com/2007/06/18/the-end-of-an-age/ |title= The End of an Age by Shaykh Dr. Abdalqadir as-Sufi |publisher=Shaykhabdalqadir.com |date=18 June 2007 |accessdate= 25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, he issued a [[fatwa]], following a visit and speech given by then Pope [[Benedict XVI]] in Germany. In his ''Fatwa Concerning the Deliberations of Pope Benedict XVI in Germany'', he stated that "in my opinion, Pope Benedict XVI is guilty of [[Islam and blasphemy|insulting the Messenger of Allah]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shaykhabdalqadir.com/content/articles/Art066_21092006.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606015844/http://www.shaykhabdalqadir.com/content/articles/Art066_21092006.html |archivedate=6 June 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an early mentor of American Sufi scholar, [[Hamza Yusuf]].&lt;ref name=Grewal&gt;Grewal, Zareena

==Murabitun World Movement==
In February 2014 he distanced himself from the dinar and dirham movement, saying, "So, I now dis-associate myself from all activity involving the Islamic gold dinar and silver dirham".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shaykhabdalqadir.com/the-islamic-dinar-a-way-stage-passed/ "THE ISLAMIC DINAR – A WAY-STAGE PASSED" Shaykh Dr. Abdalqadir as-Sufi]&lt;/ref&gt; The other major condition of a correct [[Zakat]], he argues, is the existence of personal rule, or Amirate, since Zakat is, by Qur'anic injunction, accepted rulings and established practice, taken by the leader, not given as a voluntary [[sadaqa]].&lt;ref&gt;Refer to the following articles on his website, [http://www.shaykhabdalqadir.com/content/articles/Art035_02022005.html Ta Sin Mim – Today] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070518213600/http://www.shaykhabdalqadir.com/content/articles/Art035_02022005.html |date=18 May 2007 }}, [http://www.shaykhabdalqadir.com/content/articles/Art048_30102005.html A Ramadan Message to His Majesty King Abdullah] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070518213759/http://www.shaykhabdalqadir.com/content/articles/Art048_30102005.html |date=18 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="649">In [[philosophy]] and [[logic]], '''accidental necessity''', often stated in its [[Latin]] form, ''necessitas per accidens'', refers to the necessity attributed to the past by certain views of time. It is a controversial concept: its supporters argue that it has intuitive validity while others contest it creates a contradiction in terms by positing such a thing as a "contingent necessity." It is especially important in contemporary discussions of logical and theological [[fatalism]].

'''Aesthetic Realism''' is a philosophy founded by poet and critic [[Eli Siegel]] (1902–1978) in 1941. It is based on three core principles. First, the deepest desire of every person is to like the world on an honest or accurate basis. Second, the greatest danger for a person is to have contempt for the world and what is in it—contempt defined as the false importance or glory from the lessening of things not oneself. Third, the study of what makes for beauty in art is a guide for a good life: "All beauty is a making one of opposites, and the making one of opposites is what we are going after in ourselves."

The philosophy is principally taught at the Aesthetic Realism Foundation, a nonprofit educational foundation based in [[SoHo]], [[New York City]], through a variety of lectures, classes in poetry, anthropology, art, music, and individual consultations.

The Foundation faced controversy for its assertion that men changed from homosexuality through study of this philosophy. In 1990, it stopped presentations and consultations on this subject, explaining that it did not want to be involved in the atmosphere of anger surrounding the issue, and saying that "we do not want this matter, which is certainly not fundamental to Aesthetic Realism, to be used to obscure what Aesthetic Realism truly is: education of the largest, most cultural kind."&lt;ref&gt;Statement of the Aesthetic Realism Foundation, 1990: "It is a fact that men and women have changed from homosexuality through study of Aesthetic Realism. Meanwhile, as is well known, there is now intense anger in America on the subject of homosexuality and how it is seen. Since this subject is by no means central to Aesthetic Realism, and since the Aesthetic Realism Foundation has not wanted to be involved in that atmosphere of anger, in 1990 the Foundation discontinued its public presentation of the fact that through Aesthetic Realism people have changed from homosexuality, and consultations to change from homosexuality are not being given. That is because we do not want this matter, which is certainly not fundamental to Aesthetic Realism, to be used to obscure what Aesthetic Realism truly is: education of the largest, most cultural kind."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Aesthetic Realism is based on the idea that reality, or the world, has a structure that is beautiful. Siegel identified beauty as the making one, or unity, of opposites.&lt;ref&gt;James H. Bready, "Eli Siegel's system lives" in the ''Baltimore Evening Sun'', 28 July 1982: "In brief, the Siegelian lifeview holds 'all reality, including the reality that is oneself [to be] the aesthetic oneness of opposites.' Motion and rest, surface and depth, love and anger, and so on, once identified, can and must be reconciled..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eli Siegel: "In Aesthetic Realism, beauty is the putting together of things that can be thought of as opposites….Aesthetic Realism says that reality is aesthetics….Reality is, when completely seen, beautiful: that is, reality consists of a mingling in aesthetic relation, of such opposites as the orderly and disorderly…." ''Aesthetic Realism: Three Instances''&lt;/ref&gt;

In Siegel’s critical theory, "the resolution of conflict in self is like the making one of opposites in art." A successful novel, for example, composes opposites that people are trying to put together: oneness and manyness, intensity and calm, sameness and change.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah A. Straub in ''Contemporary Authors'': "This philosophy sprang from Siegel’s belief that ‘what makes a good poem is like what can make a good life…, for poetry is a mingling of intensity and calm, emotion and logic.’" URL: http://pdfserve.galegroup.com/pdfserve/get_item/1/Sad7df8w16_1/SB976_01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; His studies led him to conclude that any successful work of art or music combines essential dualities.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Packard (author)|William Packard]]: "And as far as Aesthetic Realism goes, it is eminent good sense. Eli Siegel has boiled it down to a simple formula: ‘In reality, opposites are one; art shows this.’ An artist will try to see the opposites in action, in himself and in his world and eventually in his own work." "How a Major Poet Is Ostracized by Lit Cliches: Eli Siegel in View," published in ''newsArt The Smith,'' (1978) URL: http://www.aestheticrealism.net/NewsArt-Packard-article.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Hattersley: "The solution to our problem with opposites and the use we can make of photography in finding it is pointed to succinctly in the Eli Siegel dictum, ‘In reality opposites are one. Art shows this.’" "Form and Content in Color," ''Popular Photography'', July 1964, (Vol. 55, No. 1, pp. 84-87)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the philosophy of Aesthetic Realism, Siegel developed this concept, writing that the arts and sciences all give evidence that reality has an aesthetic nature.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Campbell in ''Art Students League News'': "According to Siegel all the arts and sciences are really attempts at liking and understanding the world." (March 1983, Volume 37, Number 3)&lt;/ref&gt;  He described the world as having a construction like art: it, too, is composed of opposites. In Siegel's eyes, freedom at one with order could be seen in an electron, a tree, or the solar system.&lt;ref&gt;Eli Siegel: "Philosophers have often seen reality as freedom and order, simultaneously and continually. Indeed, the first opposites I chose in my ''Is Beauty the Making One of Opposites?'', 1955, were Freedom and Order. You can see these right now in the world if you look at it: freedom and order are in the street, in the ocean, in woods in upper New York State." "Good Sense for the World," ''The Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known'', #221 (22 June 1977); URL: http://www.aestheticrealism.net/tro/tro221.html.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eli Siegel: "Verlaine...has some of the subtlest music in French verse. And here we have the first description of the world which beauty and art illustrate: that is, the world is simple and various at once. It is one universe, even as it has many twigs in twilight." "Good Sense for the World" (op. cit.).&lt;/ref&gt;  Siegel reasoned, "If...the structure of the world corresponds to the structure [of art], that much the world may be beautiful in the deepest sense of the word; and therefore can be liked."&lt;ref&gt;Eli Siegel: "If…the structure of the world corresponds to the structure music may have or a novel may have [or any art], that much the world may be beautiful in the deepest sense of the word; and therefore can be liked. "Good Sense for the World," (op. cit.).&lt;/ref&gt;

A primary concept of Aesthetic Realism is that the world can be liked honestly by seeing it as an aesthetic oneness of opposites. Further, a core teaching of Aesthetic Realism is that it is "every person's deepest desire to like the world on an honest or accurate basis."&lt;ref&gt;Martha Shepp: "Aesthetic Realism teaches that the deepest desire of every person is to like the world, honestly. This is the purpose of art education, and actually, ALL education." (Cataloguing Critiques: Submission to C. Staples &amp; H. Williams, the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN.) URL: http://www.marthashepp.com/cv_syll_phil/CritPresent4Website.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daily Poetics, URL: http://dailypoetics.typepad.com/daily_poetics/2006/09/the_world_art_a.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510041505/http://dailypoetics.typepad.com/daily_poetics/2006/09/the_world_art_a.html |date=2010-05-10 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eli Siegel, "Aesthetic Realism: a Tripartite Study," ''The Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known,'' #247 (21 December 1977) URL: http://www.aestheticrealism.net/tro/tro247.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Siegel recognized another competing desire which drives humans away from such an appreciation—the desire to have contempt for the world and what is in it, in order to make oneself feel more important.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah A. Straub: "Aesthetic Realism describe[s] the two opposed purposes in everyone’s life. As Siegel once observed, even though 'every person, in order to respect himself, has to see the world as beautiful, or good, or acceptable,' there is also 'a disposition in every person to think he will be for himself by making less of the outside world.' According to the philosopher, contempt for the world causes tremendous damage to the self (with effects ranging from boredom to insanity) and, on a larger scale, to the entire world when one nation’s contempt for another leads to war." ''Contemporary Authors'', URL: http://pdfserve.galegroup.com/pdfserve/get_item/1/Sad7df8w16_1/SB976_01.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;  Siegel argued that when a person seeks self-esteem through contempt—"the addition to self through the lessening of something else"—he or she is unjust to people and things.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan Patterson: "Eli Siegel, the great American poet and historian, defined hatred and contempt of people different from ourselves as the false importance or glory people received from the lessening of people not like themselves." ''Herald Sun'' of Melbourne, Australia (19 April 2009); URL: http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/sunday-heraldsun/better-to-try-world-on-love/story-e6frf92o-1225700167216.&lt;/ref&gt;  Contempt, the philosophy maintains, may seem like a triumph, but ultimately results in self-dislike and mental distress,&lt;ref&gt;Deborah A. Straub: "According to the philosopher, contempt for the world causes tremendous damage to the self (with effects ranging from boredom to insanity)." ''Contemporary Authors''; URL: http://pdfserve.galegroup.com/pdfserve/get_item/1/Sad7df8w16_1/SB976_01.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; and lessens the capacity of one's mind to perceive and feel in the fullest manner. Siegel held that, in the extreme, contempt causes insanity.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Campbell: "Among many bold pronouncements none by Siegel are stronger than the assertion that contempt of the world produces insanity." ''Art Students League News'' (March 1983, Volume 37, Number 3).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Kernan]] in ''The Washington Post'' (16 August 1978): "There are two elements: oneself and everything that is not oneself, which he calls ‘the world.’ These two opposites must be brought into harmony: By liking the world, one can come to like oneself. If, on the other hand, one feels disdain, or what he calls contempt, for the world, unhappiness results. ‘Contempt can be defined as the lessening of what is different from oneself as a means of self-increase as one sees it,’ he says. Contempt can lead to insanity, according to Siegel." URL: http://www.aestheticrealism.org/Press-Articles-on-Aesthetic-Realism/Wash-Post-Article-Kernan.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aesthetic Realism attests that one’s attitude to the world governs how all of life's components are seen: a friend, a spouse, a lover, a book, food, people of another skin tone.&lt;ref&gt;Eli Siegel: "An attitude to the world…governs one in one's everyday life. If you feel that the world is ill-managed, is contemptible, is unkind, you have to show that in how you see Mildred or how you see Morton…" "Aesthetic Realism; or, Is a Person an Aesthetic Situation?" (14 January 1969); URL: http://www.annefielding.net/Aesthetic-Situation-by-Eli-Siegel.html.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deborah A. Straub: "Siegel regarded this emphasis on the attitude of the individual towards the world as the major difference between Aesthetic Realism and other philosophies." ''Contemporary Authors'', URL: http://pdfserve.galegroup.com/pdfserve/get_item/1/Sad7df8w16_1/SB976_01.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;  Accordingly, Aesthetic Realism argues, individuals have an ethical obligation to give full value to things and people, not devalue them in order to make oneself seem more important.  Aesthetic Realism states that the conscious intention to be fair to the world and people is not only an ethical obligation, but the means of liking oneself.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett Schiff: "Nancy Starrels once attempted a working definition: Aesthetic Realism, she said, is: ‘The art of liking oneself through seeing the world, art, and oneself as the aesthetic oneness of opposites.’" ''New York Post'' (16 June 1957)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deborah A. Straub: "As Siegel once observed,…‘every person, in order to respect himself, has to see the world as beautiful, or good, or acceptable.’" ''Contemporary Authors''; URL:http://pdfserve.galegroup.com/pdfserve/get_item/1/Sad7df8w16_1/SB976_01.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosophy identifies contempt as the underlying cause of broader social problems as well: societal evils like racism and war arise from contempt for "human beings placed differently from ourselves" in terms of race, economic status, or nationality.  Siegel stated that for centuries ill will has been the predominant purpose in humanity’s economic activities.  The philosophy asserts that humanity cannot overcome its biggest problems until people cease to feel that "the world’s failure or the failure of a[nother] person enhances one’s own life." Siegel stated that until good will rather than contempt is at the center of economics and in the thoughts of people, "civilization has yet to begin."&lt;ref&gt;Eli Siegel, "Civilization Begins" in ''The Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known'', #228 (10 August 1977).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Major texts===
The philosophic basis of Aesthetic Realism was set forth systematically by Siegel in two major texts.  The first, ''Self and World: An Explanation of Aesthetic Realism, '' was written from 1941-3.  Individual chapters, including "Psychiatry, Economics, Aesthetics" and "The Aesthetic Method in Self-Conflict,"&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|978-0910492294}}&lt;/ref&gt; were printed in 1946. The full text was published in 1981 (NY: Definition Press).&lt;ref&gt;D.E., ''Booklist,'' (American Library Association, 15 January 1982): "A distinguished poet and teacher, Siegel died in 1978. This posthumous publication combines his essays and articles to give a final overview of his philosophy, called Aesthetic Realism....Siegel's passionate, affirmative intelligence is deeply stirring, frequently convincing. This is one of the few 'human improvement' doctrines to merit philosophic respect."&lt;/ref&gt; His second text, ''Definitions, and Comment: Being a Description of the World,'' completed in 1945, defines 134 terms used in the philosophic thought of Aesthetic Realism, including Existence, Change, Fixity, Freedom, Thought, Will, Wonder, Fear, Hope, Negation, Reality, and Relation. The work was published in 1978-9 as a series in the journal ''The Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known.''

==Poetry==

Siegel stated that ideas central to the philosophy of Aesthetic Realism were implicitly present in "Hot Afternoons Have Been in Montana,"&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Starrett in the ''Chicago Sunday Tribune'' (28 July 1957, part 4, p.4): "It is a longish poem, at once serious and jocose; an essay, according to Siegel, in Aesthetic Realism; and Aesthetic Realism, he says, is 'about [how] the having-to-do-withness or relation of people, is they, is themselves.'&lt;/ref&gt; the poem that brought him widespread fame when it was awarded ''The Nation'''s esteemed poetry prize in 1925. The philosophic principle that individuality ''is'' relation, "that the very self of a thing is its relations, its having-to-do-with other things," is in this poem.&lt;ref&gt;Corbett &amp; Boldt: ''Modern American Poetry,'' p. 144 (Macmillan Company, 1965): "Siegel’s poetry reveals a view of reality in which ‘the very self of a thing is its relation, its having-to-do-with other things.’"&lt;/ref&gt;  It begins with a hot, quiet afternoon in Montana and travels through time and space, showing that things usually thought of as separate and unrelated "have a great deal to do with each other."&lt;ref&gt;Deborah A. Straub, ''Contemporary Authors'': "Siegel composed ‘Hot Afternoons Have Been in Montana’ with this principle in mind, taking 'many things that are thought of usually as being far apart and foreign and [showing] in a beautiful way, that they aren’t so separate and that they do have a great deal to do with each other.'"&lt;/ref&gt; These are lines near the end of the poem: &lt;br&gt;
::Hot afternoons are real; afternoons are; places, things, thoughts, feelings are; poetry is;
::The world is waiting to be known; Earth, what it has in it!  The past is in it;
::All words, feelings, movements, words, bodies, clothes, girls, trees, stones, things of beauty,
:::books, desires are in it; and all are to be known;
::Afternoons have to do with the whole world….

The search for that which connects all branches of knowledge &lt;ref&gt;"Aesthetic Realism on Art and Self," ''Peter Gorlin Interviews Eli Siegel on The World of Art, WKCR, 18 April 1963'' published in ''Definition 15'' (Definition Press, 1963): "Aesthetic Realism is an educational method. And the first thing that it asks is: What is there in common in biology, and in history, and in the study of music, and in psychology, and in religion, and in cookery, and in the study of the history of sport, and in the study of fabrics, and in the study of chemistry, and the study of geology, and in the study of the dance?  ''Is'' there something in common? The one thing that is in common is, obviously, the opposites, because in every art and every science, there is something that is and something that changes."&lt;/ref&gt; led Siegel to discover a key concept of Aesthetic Realism: "The world, art, and self explain each other: each is the aesthetic oneness of opposites."&lt;ref&gt;''Music's Intellectual History,'' edited by Zravko Blažeković &amp; Barbara Dobbs Mackenzie (Répertoire International de Littérature Musicale, 2009), page 167: "It is a central belief of Aesthetic Realism that art, indeed, has metaphysical substance, and therefore any attempt to sever art and philosophy limits the precision and the freedom of one's mind. 'The world, art, and self,' said Eli Siegel, 'explain each other: each is the aesthetic oneness of opposites.'"&lt;/ref&gt; Aesthetic Realism classes were scholarly&lt;ref&gt;Donald Kirkley, ''Baltimore Sun,'' 24 September 1944: "These proceedings are orderly, sensible, and, in this writer’s opinion, scholarly and valuable."&lt;/ref&gt; and sought to demonstrate that poetry is related to the problems of everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;''The Villager,'' 26 July 1956: "This relation of poetry and aesthetics to what a person feels and thinks, goes through in any day of his life, is the unique contribution of Aesthetic Realism, the philosophy taught by Mr. Siegel."&lt;/ref&gt; The viewpoint of Aesthetic Realism is that "what makes a good poem is like what can make a good life."&lt;ref&gt;Deborah A. Straub, ''Contemporary Authors:'' "Known first as Aesthetic Analysis and later as Aesthetic Realism, this philosophy sprang from Siegel’s belief that 'what makes a good poem is like what can make a good life.'"&lt;/ref&gt; This contradicts the Freudian view of art as sublimation.&lt;ref&gt;Katinka Matson, ''Psychology Today Omnibook of Personal Development'' (William Morrow &amp; Company, Inc., 1982): The basic tenet of Aesthetic Realism is that all reality is united in an aesthetic union of opposites: This is beauty itself....Siegel analyzes what he calls 'failures' as personified in the work of certain men, Sigmund Freud and T.S.Eliot among others. Siegel believes their common failure to be the neglect of seeing 'the large continuous purpose of man as good will for everything, animate an inaminate.' Freud 'appealed to incompleteness in man.' He confined man's possible view of self by emphasizing his sexual anxieties and death instinct as the keys to mental disorder."&lt;/ref&gt;

Siegel defined poetry as "the oneness of the permanent opposites in reality as seen by an individual."&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Reiss, Preface to ''Quintillions'' by Robert Clairmont (American Sunbeam Publisher, 2005): "Eli Siegel…[is the] founder of the philosophy Aesthetic Realism....Poetry, he wrote, 'is the oneness of the permanent opposites in reality as seen by an individual.'"&lt;/ref&gt; In Aesthetic Realism classes he explained that the greatest desire of a person is to put together opposites, as, in a good poem, "emotion changes into logic: there is no rift between the two."&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Skene Catling, ''Baltimore Sun,'' 19 April 1952: "'In aesthetic realism,' Mr. Siegel said, 'emotion changes into logic: There is no rift between the two.' Emotion and logic, energy and calm, can and must coexist in poetry if it is to be good poetry, in Mr. Siegel’s opinion."&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained that music distinguishes true poetry, whatever the language, period or style; the music of a poem shows the poet has honestly perceived opposites as one, and sincerely united personal feelings with the impersonal structure of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Reiss, Preface to ''Quintillions'' by Robert Clairmont (American Sunbeam Publisher, 2005): "Eli Siegel...founder of the philosophy Aesthetic Realism...[showed that] every true poem...has come from a person’s seeing something so justly that he or she has perceived in the immediate object the structure of the world itself: ''the oneness of opposites.'' And we ''hear'' that structure as poetic music. Poetry, he wrote, 'is the oneness of the permanent opposites in reality as seen by an individual.' That is true about every instance of good poetry--no matter what its style, or language, or in what century it was written. On the other hand, an unauthentic poem, however impressive, however praised, is insufficiently sincere...lacks that honesty which is a self at its very center meeting what an object really is."&lt;/ref&gt; "Poetry," he wrote, "arises out of a like of the world so intense and wide that of itself, it is musical."&lt;ref&gt;Eli Siegel, ''The Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known,'' #181 (15 September 1976): "Poetry arises out of a like of the world so intense and wide that of itself, it is musical."&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Aesthetic Realism teaches, even a poem that in substance seems to condemn the world, in its technique and music is praising the world, seeing it truly.

In thousands of Aesthetic Realism lectures, Siegel demonstrated the centrality of poetry to every aspect of life, including "Poetry and Anger," "Poetry and Love," "Educational Method Is Poetic," "Poetry and Time," "Poetry, Money, and Good Will," "A Poetic Technique of Parenthood," "Poetry and History," and "Hamlet Revisited; or, The Family Should Be Poetry."&lt;ref&gt;http://aestheticrealism.net/lectures/&lt;/ref&gt; His students affirm that an important aspect of the philosophy continues to be the study of how a good poem has within it "the composition, beauty, sanity we want in ourselves."  This education, they assert, "makes it possible for poetry to be, as Matthew Arnold said, a ''criticism of life.''"&lt;ref&gt;M. Carpenter, K. Van Outryve, Preface to ''The Critical Muse,'' p. iii (Terrain Gallery, 1973) {{ISBN|0-911492-18-6}}: "''The Critical Muse'' is an anthology permeated with the philosophy of Aesthetic Realism....Every poem on the pages that follow is about the need of a person to put together opposites in himself. What makes these poems so important is this: as they tell us about the opposites in ourselves, the ''way'' they tell us, the technique of poetry, shows that opposites can be one. The music of poetry...is the most important sign that opposites are one....In our studies with Eli Siegel, we have come to see poetry as having within it the composition, beauty, sanity we want in ourselves.  This is the education which makes it possible for poetry to be, as Matthew Arnold said, a ''criticism of life.''"&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

=== Lectures and classes by Eli Siegel ===
In 1946, Siegel began giving weekly lectures at [[Steinway Hall]] in New York City, in which he presented what he first called Aesthetic Analysis (later, Aesthetic Realism), "a philosophic way of seeing conflict in self and making this conflict clear to a person so that a person becomes more integrated and happier."&lt;ref&gt;Donald Kirkley, "Poet Outlines a Philosophy," ''Baltimore Sun,'' 2 August 1946: "More than 160 persons…attended the introductory talk. Subsequent lectures will be given weekly at Steinway Hall. Tonight’s theme was 'Self and World.' In it, Mr. Siegel affirmed his belief that 'aesthetic analysis can be of help to everybody.' It is, he said, ‘a philosophic way of seeing conflict in self and making this conflict clear to a person so that a person becomes more integrated and happier.’"&lt;/ref&gt;
From 1948 through 1977, Siegel continued teaching in his library at 67 Jane Street in [[Greenwich Village]], where he also resided. Individuals studied Aesthetic Realism in classes such as the Ethical Study Conference, the Nevertheless Poetry Class, and classes in which Aesthetic Realism was discussed in relation to the arts and sciences, history, philosophy, national ethics, and world literature.&lt;ref&gt;"From Here to Obscurity" by Michael Kernan, ''The Washington Post,'' 16 August 1978: "[A]t 67 Jane St. in the Village…[Siegel] gave his first lessons….[T]oday there are perhaps 250 serious students, mostly New Yorkers, though a few commute from nearby cities."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The arts ===
Among the earliest students of Aesthetic Realism were [[Chaim Koppelman]] (1920–2009),&lt;ref&gt;[http://chaimkoppelman.net/].&lt;/ref&gt; a painter, sculptor, printmaker,&lt;ref&gt;Trudie A. Grace, ''Same Objects/Different Visions: Etchings by Chaim and Dorothy Koppelman'' in ''Journal of the Print World'' (Winter, 2004) p. 36: "In the 1940s, Chaim Koppelman wanted to be a sculptor and then a painter, but in 1953 he switched to printmaking, attracted primarily by the potential for subtle chiaroscuro in the handling of form and atmospheric qualities as well as effects achieved in the biting of the plate."&lt;/ref&gt; and founder of the printmaking department of the [[School of Visual Arts]], and his wife, painter Dorothy Koppelman, who opened the [[Terrain Gallery]] in 1955, introducing Aesthetic Realism to the cultural scene of New York City with art exhibitions and public discussions of the Siegel Theory of Opposites in relation to painting, sculpture, photography, poetry, and later, music, theatre, and architecture."&lt;ref&gt;Bennett Schiff in the ''New York Post,'' Sunday, 16 June 1957: "An interesting aspect of the cultural life of this city within the past three years has been the development of the Terrain Gallery. There probably hasn’t been a gallery before this like the Terrain, which devotes itself to the integration of art with all of living, according to an esthetic principle which is part of an entire, encompassing philosophic theory. The gallery was organized and launched about three years ago by a group of young, cultivated persons including writers, artists and teachers, all of whom held a fundamental belief in common. This was the validity of the theory of ‘Aesthetic Realism’ as developed and taught by Eli Siegel, a poet and philosopher whose work has received growing recognition….Aesthetic Realism is: ‘The art of liking oneself through seeing the world, art, and oneself as the aesthetic oneness of opposites.’"&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaim Koppelman’s interviews of Roy Lichtenstein, Richard Anuszkiewicz, and Clayton Pond, in which these artists discussed the relevance of Aesthetic Realism and Eli Siegel’s Theory of Opposites to their work, are now part of the Smithsonian Archives of American Art.&lt;ref&gt;Smithsonian Archives of American Art: "Relevance of the Siegel theory of opposites to the work of Roy Lichtenstein, Clayton Pond, and Richard Anuszkiewicz, interview by Chaim Koppelman, 1968." [http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/collection/koppchai.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;  Artists began using Aesthetic Realism in writings about their fields, including [[Ralph Hattersley]], editor of the photography journal '' Infinity'',&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Hattersley, "Form and Content in Color," ''Popular Photography'' July 1964 (Vol. 55, No. 1, pp. 84-87): "The solution to our problem with opposites and the use we can make of photography in finding it is pointed to succinctly in the...dictum, ‘In reality opposites are one; art shows this.’ Siegel has, incidentally, a considerable influence on my thinking about photography; but to hold him directly responsible for any of my statements would be to make him considerably less of a philosopher and critic than he actually is."&lt;/ref&gt; and Nat Herz, author of articles in '' Modern Photography'' and of the ''Konica Pocket Handbook: An Introduction to Better Photography.''&lt;ref&gt;Nat Herz, ''Konica Pocket Handbook: An Introduction to Better Photography,'' Universal Photo Books series (NY: Verlan Books, 1960).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Aesthetic Realism: We Have Been There'' (NY: Definition Press, 1969), a book of essays by working artists in the fields of painting, printmaking, photography, acting, and poetry, documents how the Siegel Theory of Opposites "relates life to art and is basically a criterion for all branches of aesthetics".&lt;ref&gt;''Library Journal,'' 1 September 1969: "Heraclitus, Aristotle, Kant, Hegel, and even Martin Buber have posited contraries and polarities in their philosophies. Eli Siegel, however, seems to be the first to demonstrate that ‘all beauty is the making one of the permanent opposites in reality.’ Since the 1940s, this poet-philosopher-aesthetician has been advocating Aesthetic Realism: ‘that the structure of reality is aesthetic.’ He has also been demonstrating the practicality of and the necessity for the aesthetic criticism of self. The Siegel Theory of Opposites relates life to art and is basically a criterion for all branches of aesthetics."&lt;/ref&gt;

Some artistic productions inspired by the philosophy were surrounded by controversy.  A theatrical production of [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen’s]] ''[[Hedda Gabler]]'' by The Opposites Company of the Theatre, in which the title character was presented as "essentially good", in keeping with Siegel’s interpretation of the play,&lt;ref&gt;Eli Siegel, "Two Critics of the New Hedda Gabler," ''New York Times, '' Sunday, 15 March 1970: "Did Hedda Gabler want humanity and the world to be more beautiful?  I see her as good because with all her uncertainty and displeasingness, this was the main thing in her life."&lt;/ref&gt; was highly praised in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;Ted Kalem, ''Time,'' 19 December 1969, p. 58: "Now, in an off-off-Broadway production by a group called the Opposites Company, there is a new Hedda Gabler, not only beautifully performed, but deeply and subtly thought through in terms that make it peculiarly relevant to the psychic and psychological states of the modern woman."&lt;/ref&gt; but severely criticized in ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Kerr, "Hedda Is Not Candida," ''New York Times,'' 25 January 1970: "It is wholly boring and only boring….It doesn’t really mean anything to say that Hedda is 'essentially' good.  All people are 'essentially' good, or so I believe."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clive Barnes, "Hedda Gabler: the Good Person," ''New York Times,'' 18 January 1970: "To see Ibsen’s wonderful and dangerous Hedda…as 'a good person' is a cheap little travesty of drama, a misinterpretation of the playwright’s clear demands."&lt;/ref&gt; which also published Siegel’s response to the critics.&lt;ref&gt;Eli Siegel, "Two Critics of the New Hedda Gabler," ''New York Times, '' Sunday, 15 March 1970: "The history of criticism makes it clear that a lack of good will on the part of a critic constitutes an early form of critical incompetence….As Barnes and Kerr deal with various aspects of the Actor’s Playhouse production, if you have your ear to the ground you will discern not criticism but a displeasure with the existence of Aesthetic Realism as a thing to learn."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aesthetic Realism Theatre Company, composed of actors, singers and musicians, has appeared throughout the country in both musical performances and dramatic productions based on Siegel's lectures on [[Shakespeare]], [[Moliere]], [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]], [[Ibsen]], [[Strindberg]], [[Eugene O’Neill]], [[George Kelly (playwright)|George Kelly]], [[Susan Glaspell]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aestheticrealismtheatreco.org/outreach.htm Aesthetic Realism Theatre Company]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aesthetic Realism Foundation ===
The not-for-profit Aesthetic Realism Foundation was established by Siegel's students in 1973. Located at 141 Greene Street in [[SoHo]], New York, it is the primary location where the philosophy is taught, in public seminars and dramatic presentations, and in consultations for individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Katinka Matson, p.34, ''The Psychology Today Omnibook of Personal Development'' (William Morrow &amp; Co., Inc., 1977): "The process of Aesthetic Realism takes the form of seminars...sponsored by the A[esthetic] R[ealism] Foundation. The seminars deal with a wide range of subjects: those that are directed toward daily problems and the greater problems of life. In seminars, a consultation trio discusses aesthetic solutions to these problems, in terms of music, literature, poetry, painting, history, etc."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deborah A. Straub, ''Contemporary Authors:'' "Informing and educating the public has therefore become the primary task of the Aesthetic Realism Foundation…whose staff members conduct seminars, workshops, and consultation sessions." URL: http://pdfserve.galegroup.com/pdfserve/get_item/1/Sad7df8w16_1/SB976_01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation offers classes in poetry, anthropology, art, music, acting, and singing, and classes for children.&lt;ref&gt;Filomena Gomes, "Promising the world" in ''The Bergen Record'' 26 March 1999: "In a monthly program dubbed 'Learning to Like the World,' educators at the nonprofit foundation, established by Eli Siegel, work with children ages 5 to 12 to help them learn to use books as a tool to appreciate the world and the people around them....The world, according to the foundation’s philosophy, is made up of opposites: outside and inside, rest and motion. Similarly, children want to feel excited and feel at ease at the same time."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ellen Reiss - 20050815.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Ellen Reiss, Chairman of Education]]

In 1977, Siegel appointed Ellen Reiss chairperson for the teaching of Aesthetic Realism. Since that time, she has conducted professional classes for the Foundation's faculty. Herself an Aesthetic Realism consultant since 1971, Reiss also taught in the English departments of [[Queens College|Queens]] and [[Hunter College]]s, [[City University of New York]]. She is a poet, editor, co-author (with Martha Baird) of ''The Williams-Siegel Documentary'' (Definition Press, 1970), and instructor of the course "The Aesthetic Realism Explanation of Poetry".&lt;ref&gt;''Quintillions'' by Robert Clairmont (American Sunbeam Publisher, 2005) back cover: "Ellen Reiss is editor of the periodical ''The Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known,'' where her commentaries on literature, life, and national ethics appear regularly. She is Class Chairman of Aesthetic Realism, appointed by its founder, the philosopher, critic, and poet Eli Siegel; and is co-author, with Martha Baird, of ''The Williams-Siegel Documentary.'' She teaches at the Aesthetic Realism Foundation and taught previously in the English departments of Queens and Hunter Colleges, City University of New York."&lt;/ref&gt;

Siegel died on November 8, 1978.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'' obituary, 10 November 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;  His work is continued by Reiss, whose editorial commentaries on literature, life, and national ethics appear regularly in the periodical ''The Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known.''&lt;ref&gt;http://aestheticrealism.net/tro&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aesthetic Realism and homosexuality===

A controversial aspect of the philosophy concerns the assertion that men and women could change from homosexuality through studying its principles. In 1946 writer and WW II veteran Sheldon Kranz (1919–1980) was the first man to report that he changed from homosexuality through Aesthetic Realism.&lt;ref&gt;John Lewis: "Gays Who Have Gone Straight," ''NY Daily News'', March 15, 1981. "The late Sheldon Kranz, a GI in World War II, was the first man to make the change in 1946. Kranz later married Anne Fielding and the couple remained married for 24 years until his death recently."&lt;/ref&gt;   Kranz said that as his way of seeing the world changed, his sexual preference also changed: from a homosexual orientation (he was no longer impelled toward men) to a heterosexual one that included love for a woman for the first time in his life. Kranz was married for 25 years (until his death) to [[Obie]] award-winning actress Anne Fielding.&lt;ref&gt;Sheldon Kranz to interviewer Jonathan Black; ''Free Time'' show, WNET, Channel 13, 19 February 1971. Interview reprinted in ''The H Persuasion'', Sheldon Kranz, editor (New York: Definition Press, 1971). "Aesthetic Realism is the first body of knowledge which presents a way of seeing the world that incidentally affects one in terms of the way one sees women…so that one can be permanently heterosexual." Sheldon Kranz to interviewer Jonathan Black: "One of the things that happened in terms of my wife is that every time I had sex I have never had that ghastly feeling afterwards. As a matter of fact, it never ceases to be a source of wonder to me that one could have sex and really feel good afterwards."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SKranz-and-AFielding.jpg|border|thumb|right|267px|alt=Sheldon Kranz and Anne Fielding|Sheldon Kranz and Anne Fielding (1980)]]

In keeping with its general approach, Aesthetic Realism views homosexuality as a philosophic matter.&lt;ref&gt;"The Homosexual Story" by Eli Siegel, ''The Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known'', Issue #316, April 25, 1979. "Aesthetic Realism was not chiefly interested, as I said, in talking to homosexual people, although it felt it could be of great use. [T]he principal purpose of Aesthetic Realism in talking to a homosexual person [was] to have him see the world differently and therefore himself differently; or, if one wishes, to have him see himself differently and therefore the world differently."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sheldon Kranz to interviewer Jonathan Black, ''Free Time'' show, WNET, New York: 19 February 1971. Interview reprinted in ''The H Persuasion'', Sheldon Kranz, editor,(New York: Definition Press, 1971), "Aesthetic Realism is the first body of knowledge which presents a way of seeing the world that incidentally affects one in terms of the way one sees women…so that one can be permanently heterosexual."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Elmhurst Press'' (Elmhurst, Illinois), "Aesthetic Realism Ends Homosexuality," August 17, 1983, "Five formerly homosexual men…appeared with David [Susskind] and told how they had changed from homosexuality to heterosexuality with the help of a program of Aesthetic Realism developed by Eli Siegel…It is not just for homosexuals but everyone who may feel he or she would like to make some changes."&lt;/ref&gt; A fundamental principle of the philosophy is that every person is in a fight between contempt for the world and respect for it.&lt;ref&gt;"Aesthetic Realism and Homosexuality" by Kay Longcope, ''The Boston Globe'', April 18, 1982. "The cornerstone of Aesthetic Realism is four-fold: ‘Every person is always trying to put together opposites in himself. Every person, in order to respect himself, has to see the world as beautiful, or good, or acceptable. There is a disposition in every person to think he will be for himself by making less of the outside world."&lt;/ref&gt;   Siegel stated that this fight is present as well in homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah A. Staub in ''Contemporary Authors.'' "The first statement of Aesthetic Realism maintains that ‘every person is always trying to put together opposites in himself.’ Though Siegel never intended this principle to become identified with any particular form of self-conflict, it long ago became linked to his position on what he termed the ‘H Persuasion’--homosexuality. Because he believed homosexuality arises from contempt for the world that manifests itself as contempt for women, the philosopher reasoned that people could be 'changed from homosexuality' if they were taught to 'like the world on an honest basis.' Since 1946, over 100 men and women say they have 'changed from homosexuality' after attending special question-and-answer consultation sessions conducted by teachers of Aesthetic Realism."&lt;/ref&gt; He explained: "All homosexuality arises from contempt of the world, not liking it sufficiently. This changes into a contempt for women."&lt;ref&gt;"Instances of How Aesthetic Realism Sees A Matter of This Time" by Eli Siegel from ''The H Persuasion'', Sheldon Kranz, editor (New York: Definition Press, 1971)&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the philosophy, in the field of love and sex, a homosexual man prefers the sameness of another man while undervaluing the difference of the world that a woman represents. This undervaluing of difference is a form of contempt for the world; therefore, as a man learns how to like the world honestly, his attitude towards difference changes and this affects every area of his life, including sexual preference.&lt;ref&gt;Sheldon Kranz to interviewer Jonathan Black, ''Free Time'', show, WNET, New York: 19 February 1971. Interview reprinted in ''The H Persuasion'', Sheldon Kranz, editor (New York: Definition Press, 1971): "It’s a very philosophic matter, but maybe I can explain it as simply as possible. I think that the desire of every person, just as person, is to be able to welcome and take to himself as much of the variety and diversity and difference of the world as possible….A person becomes educated…to get more and more of the diversity of the world to him. I feel that in homosexuality there is such a limiting of that…such a denying of difference, that I feel there is something very deep in the self of a person that says, ‘This is not what I want.’ Now, as I said…if people…really can say, ‘I like myself this way, really,’ –it’s not for me to say one way or the other."&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1965 supporters of the philosophy began an effort to have press and media report on the change from homosexuality through Aesthetic Realism.&lt;ref&gt;''The H Persuasion'', Sheldon Kranz, editor (New York: Definition Press, 1971), p. xvii. "Since 1965 there has been a more or less continuous effort to have some coverage of the documented changes from homosexuality through the study of Aesthetic Realism."&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1971 men (including Kranz) who said they changed through Aesthetic Realism were interviewed on New York City’s WNET Channel 13 ''Free Time'' show&lt;ref&gt;''Free Time'' show, WNET, Channel 13, New York, aired 19 February 1971&lt;/ref&gt;  and the ''David Susskind Show'',&lt;ref&gt;''The David Susskind Show'' WNEW-TV, Channel 5, aired 4 April 1971, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; which had a national syndication.  The book ''The H Persuasion'',&lt;ref&gt;''The H Persuasion'', Sheldon Kranz, editor (New York: Definition Press, 1971)&lt;/ref&gt; published that year, contained writing by Siegel detailing his premise about the cause of homosexuality, transcripts of Aesthetic Realism lessons, and narratives by men who said they changed, describing both why they changed and how.  In response to requests from men and women wanting to study Aesthetic Realism, Siegel designated four consultation trios, one of which, Consultation With Three, was for the purpose of teaching men who wanted to change from homosexuality.  In 1983, five other men who said they had changed from homosexuality were interviewed on the ''David Susskind Show.''&lt;ref&gt;''The David Susskind Show'' WNEW-TV, Channel 5, aired 8 May 1983, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; The transcript of this interview was published in the 1986 book ''The Aesthetic Realism of Eli Siegel and the Change from Homosexuality.''&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Reiss, editor, ''The Aesthetic Realism of Eli Siegel and the Change from Homosexuality'' (New York: Definition Press, 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

With the exception of a brief 1971 review calling ''The H Persuasion'' "less a book than a collection of pietistic snippets by Believers,"&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'', Book Review, page BR64, September 12, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;  the ''New York Times'' never reported that men said they changed from homosexuality through Aesthetic Realism.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Green: "FYI Put those fears away, all citizens-to-be" ''The Globe and Mail'', April 28, 1978, p.8 "Pity the lot of the Aesthetic Realists…who are mad at the ''New York Times'' because the ''Times,'' they claim, refuses to print a story that 123 homosexuals have changed (to heterosexuality) through Aesthetic Realism."&lt;/ref&gt; Students of the philosophy who said they changed from homosexuality or in other large ways accused the press of unfairly withholding information valuable to the lives of people. In the 1970s they mounted an aggressive campaign of telephone calls, letters, ads, and vigils in front of various media offices and at the homes of editors.&lt;ref&gt;"Some News that’s Unfit to Print," ''New York Magazine'', 17 April 1978, p.8: "Though the ''New York Times'' does a fine job of covering Milanese fashions…it has somehow managed to overlook the Aesthetic Realism story. The Aesthetic Realists do not like this, and they are doing something about it….[They] have disrupted the ''Times'' city desk with more than 65 calls a day from people demanding that the story be run….What is more, the Aesthetic Realists have gone into the city streets, holding vigils in front of publisher Punch Sulzberger’s home and those of other top ''Times'' officials."&lt;/ref&gt; Many wore lapel buttons that read "Victim of the Press".&lt;ref&gt;Nat Hentoff, "Minority protesters trash First Amendment," ''St. Petersburg Times'', Wednesday, May 5, 1993, p. 11A. "For many years in New York's Greenwich Village, decorously dressed followers of poet and guru Eli Siegel ("Hot Afternoons Have Been in Montana") used to wear buttons proclaiming themselves ‘Victims of the Press.’"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Fischkin, ''Muddy Cup: a Dominican Family Comes of Age in a New America'', (NY: Scribner) {{ISBN|0-684-80704-1}}, pages 231-232: "Linda Kunz wore a 'Victim of the Press' button on her lapel. On the first day of class, she wrote this on the blackboard: 'The purpose of all education is to like the world through knowing it--Eli Siegel.' And then this question: 'Can grammar, which is the structure of language, tell us anything about the structure of the world--including ourselves?'"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973 the American Psychiatric Association declassified homosexuality as a mental disorder.&lt;ref&gt;Bayer, Ronald (1987) ''Homosexuality and American Psychiatry: The Politics of Diagnosis''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, p. 3, p.158, pp. 127-8.  {{ISBN|0-691-02837-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, ads were placed in three major newspapers stating "we have changed from homosexuality through our study of the Aesthetic Realism of Eli Siegel." They were signed by 50 men and women.&lt;ref&gt;Advertisement, "We Have Changed from Homosexuality" March 18, 1978, ''New York Times'', ''Washington Post'', ''Los Angeles Times''&lt;/ref&gt; With few exceptions, the press in general either ignored or dismissed the assertion of persons who said they changed.

The gay press and gay reporters were generally hostile to Aesthetic Realism.&lt;ref&gt;Allen Roskoff, "Gay Activist Allen Roskoff Lets It All Out", ''Queerty'', "…they were telling the gay men that it was unnatural to be homosexual.  Only opposites could attract in art and in life.  The whole philosophy was about opposites, and of course that meant that homosexuality was wrong.  I guess they matched up or convinced men.  Whenever I saw a woman with a button, I would say, ‘What’s the matter, you can’t find a straight man?’  I detested these people. I mean, they were the ex-gay people."&lt;/ref&gt;   A 1982 ''Boston Globe'' article written by "the first openly gay reporter" on its staff,&lt;ref&gt;Obituary of Kay Longcope, ''The Boston Globe'', April 8, 2007.  "Generally regarded as the first openly gay reporter on the newspaper's staff…. Ms. Longcope, who spent 22 years at the ''Globe'' and then founded a statewide gay and lesbian newsweekly in her home state of Texas, died of pancreatic cancer March 28 in Hospice Austin's Christopher House."&lt;/ref&gt; interviewed primarily gay therapists and then reported that the "assertion" of change through Aesthetic Realism was "a claim staggering to psychiatrists and psychologists."&lt;ref&gt;Kay Longcope: "Aesthetic Realism and Homosexuality," ''The Boston Globe'', April 18, 1982. "The assertion of change based on Aesthetic Realism is especially startling to professionals in the psychotherapeutic field after a decade of rethinking homosexuality—a process triggered by the Gay Liberation Movement."&lt;/ref&gt;  About 250 people protested the article on the Boston Common.  The ''Globe’s'' ombudsman later wrote in his column that the article was biased against Aesthetic Realism and that it contained "strong, negative words without attribution" and "inaccuracies".&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Kierstead, Ombudsman, "''Globe'' article on ‘Aesthetic Realism’ and gays prompts complaints," ''The Boston Globe'', 24 May 1982. "On May 13, an estimated 250 people rallied on the Boston Common…in the case of The Boston Globe and the Aesthetic Realism Foundation in New York City….The ''Globe'', once it decided to do the article…also assumed an obligation to spare no effort in thoroughly researching and investigating an organization which espouses a philosophy which is both complex and controversial. [Assistant Living Editor Ed Siegel] and writer Longcope believed that under the circumstances involved the story was fair….The ombudsman disagrees. The story, as published, contains a preponderance of material based on interviews with representatives of the gay community who, for the most part, are not un-biased in their views of Aesthetic Realism….The ombudsman believes the article, not intended as an exposé, contained a negative tone and strong negative words without attribution. It also contained inaccuracies."&lt;/ref&gt;

Some gay advocacy groups and gay activists presented Aesthetic Realism as "anti-gay", accusing the philosophy of offering a "gay cure" and expressing skepticism that homosexuality could or should change.&lt;ref&gt;Anti-Gay Cult Pulls Fast One" by Bill Schoell, ''The New York Blade'' April 25, 2008. "Unfortunately, Siegel and his followers believed that homosexuality was an illness ‘caused’ by self-contempt….In the 70s AR…heavily promoted the myth that they could convert people from gay to straight….New York’s Gay Activist Alliance responded by infiltrating [or "zapping"] their meetings at their Greene Street headquarters and passing out pro-gay literature."&lt;/ref&gt;  Persons within the gay pride movement associated the desire of a man to change from homosexuality with a lack of pride in a gay identity, and saw Aesthetic Realism as biased against those living a gay lifestyle.  The Aesthetic Realism Foundation stated unequivocally that it supported full, completely equal civil rights for homosexuals, including the right of a man or woman to live their life in the way they chose.&lt;ref&gt;John Lewis: "Gays Who Have Gone Straight" ''NY Daily News'', March 15, 1981. "Ellen Reiss a teacher at the foundation said: ‘What we offer is a means to have people see themselves and the world as they truly are. We are not interested in grabbing people off the street and saying, "Change." If a person is gay and likes himself and the world and wants to stay that way, fine. But if a person wants to change we offer them a scientific logical approach.’"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition to prejudice and racism==
{{Wide image|The People of Clarendon County at The Congressional Auditorium, US Capitol Visitor Center - 20091021.jpg|400px|''"The People of Clarendon County"—A Play by Ossie Davis, &amp; the Answer to Racism,'' presented at the Congressional Auditorium, US Capitol Visitor Center on October 21, 2009 with Lee Central HS Chorus and the Thelma Slater Singers of Bishopville, South Carolina.|50%|right|alt=alt text}}

In one of his earliest essays, "The Equality of Man" (1923), Siegel criticized writers who were promoting [[eugenics]]. He argued that thus far in the history of the world, people have not had equal conditions of life, to bring out their potential abilities, and he asserted that if all men and women had "an equal chance to use all the powers they had at birth, they would be equal."&lt;ref&gt;''The Modern Quarterly Beginnings of Aesthetic Realism 1922-1923'' (NY: Definition Press, 1969), p. 28: "Whatever the reason, no attempt has been made to bring out all the powers of mind that are in each man at birth, by giving it conditions that would fit it best. Worded differently, men have not had an equal chance to be as actively powerful as they might be. And if they had been given an equal chance to use all the powers they had at birth, they would be equal."&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Aesthetic Realism, racism and prejudice of all kinds begin with the human inclination towards contempt, "the addition to self through the lessening of something else." Students of the philosophy assert that the racist attitude is not inevitable, but can change if one learns to recognize and criticize contempt. In public forums, individuals of diverse nationalities and cultural backgrounds have described how, through study of Aesthetic Realism, their racism and prejudice changed, not into mere "tolerance" but into a respectful desire to know and to see that the feelings of another are "as real, and as deep, as one’s own."&lt;ref&gt;Susan P. Smith, Hickory, SC Branch, NAACP, "Back to School Rally Offers Answer to Racism," ''Hickory Daily Record,'' Friday, 21 August 2009: "The Belk Centrum Theater at Lenoir Rhyne University was packed Saturday for an intellectually stimulating Back to School Rally sponsored by the Hickory Branch NAACP....This demonstrates that people in this area are ready for new ideas in education and race relations.  Aesthetic Realism views contempt as the cause of racism, 'the addition to self through the lessening of something else'…. The criticism of contempt, including in oneself, and learning to see that the feelings of other people are as real and as deep as one's own, are essential in ending racism."&lt;/ref&gt;

On an international level, proponents advocated the study of contempt and good will, as described by Aesthetic Realism, as "The Only Answer to the Mideast Crisis," in a 1990 advertisement on the op-ed page of ''The New York Times.''&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times,'' 13 October 1990&lt;/ref&gt;  To oppose prejudice they recommend that persons of nations who are in conflict "write a soliloquy of 500 words" describing the feelings of a person in the opposing land.&lt;ref&gt;Oron, Bernstein, Fishman, Gvili, Ratz, Levy, Shazar, "Contempt Must Be Studied for Mideast Terror to End!" ''Aesthetic Realism and the Answer to Racism,'' ed. Bernstein (Orange Angle Press, 2004), p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

The UN commissioned filmmaker Ken Kimmelman, a consultant on the faculty of the Aesthetic Realism Foundation, to make two anti-prejudice films: ''Asimbonanga,'' and ''Brushstrokes.'' Kimmelman credits Aesthetic Realism as his inspiration for these films, as well as his 1995 Emmy-award winning anti-prejudice public service film, ''The Heart Knows Better,'' based on, and including, a statement by Eli Siegel.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac J. Black, ''The Heart Knows Better'', ''The Amsterdam News'', 28 October 1995: "The Heart Knows Better, produced by Ken Kimmelman of Imagery Film Ltd., was just awarded the Emmy for Outstanding National Public Service Film. The film addresses racial prejudice and was inspired by this...statement of Eli Siegel, the American poet and founder of Aesthetic Realism: 'It will be found that black and white man have the same goodnesses, the same temptations, and can be criticized in the same way. The skin may be different, but the aorta is quite the same.'"&lt;/ref&gt;

Another noted speaker on the subject of Aesthetic Realism and how it opposes prejudice and racism is Alice Bernstein, whose articles on the subject have been published in hundreds of papers throughout the country, including in her serialized column, "Alice Bernstein &amp; Friends."&lt;ref&gt;Robin H. King, ''South Carolina Black News'', 18 Dec. 2008: "Many people have been introduced to Alice Bernstein through her nationally published articles, and her column in the ''South Carolina Black News'' for the last five years.  She writes about what she learned  about the cause of and answer to racism from the educational philosophy, Aesthetic Realism."&lt;/ref&gt; Mrs. Bernstein is the editor of ''The People of Clarendon County'' (Chicago: Third World Press, 2007), a book that includes a play by Ossie Davis re-discovered by Bernstein, together with historical documents, photographs, and essays about Aesthetic Realism, which she describes as "the education that can end racism." The late Ossie Davis, noted actor and civil rights activist, stated: "Alice Bernstein has dedicated her life to ending racism in this country. ...[She] is writing an introduction [to my play] based on what she has learned about people and history from Aesthetic Realism which she has studied for decades."&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Alice, ed., ''The People of Clarendon County--A Play by Ossie Davis with Photographs and Historical Documents, and Essays on the Education That Can End Racism'' (Chicago: Third World Press, 2007, p. xiv).&lt;/ref&gt;

A production of ''The People of Clarendon County—a Play by Ossie Davis, &amp; the Answer to Racism,'' presenting Aesthetic Realism as the educational method that explains and changes prejudice and racism, was staged in the Congressional Auditorium of the US Capitol Visitor Center in Washington, DC on October 21, 2009, with introductory remarks given by House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn.&lt;ref&gt;''CapitalWire'', Culture, 1 Nov. 2009: "House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn gave opening remarks at a historic event on Capitol Hill in Washington, October 21st: ''The People of Clarendon County—A Play by Ossie Davis &amp; the Answer to Racism!''"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and response==
The organization has also been accused by some ex-students and cult researchers for operating as a [[cult]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://michaelbluejay.com/x/jewishtimes.html Monumental Man: The Controversial Legacy of Eli Siegel], Melissa Goldman, Jewish Times, August 22, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.villagevoice.com/2008-05-06/news/political-surrealism/&lt;/ref&gt; Some former and current students of the philosophy have responded in a website titled "Countering the Lies," saying that the technique of the persons who want to discredit Aesthetic Realism is "1) to find out what characteristics a cult is supposed to have and, 2) then say Aesthetic Realism has them (though of course it doesn't)."&lt;ref&gt;http://counteringthelies.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andrew Newberg, M.D.''' is an American [[neuroscientist]] who is the Director of Research at the Myrna Brind Center for Integrative Medicine at [[Thomas Jefferson University Hospital]],&lt;ref name="Jefferson University Physician Profile"&gt;Jefferson University Physician Profile. "[http://hospitals.jefferson.edu/find-a-doctor/n/newberg-andrew-b/]",  [[Jefferson University Physician Profile]], 2016-08-29.&lt;/ref&gt; an Adjunct Professor of [[Religious Studies]] and an Associate Professor of Radiology at the [[University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine]].&lt;ref name="University of Pennsylvania Staff/Faculty"&gt;Staff/Faculty. "[https://www.med.upenn.edu/stc/staff1.html]",  [[Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania Staff/Faculty]], 2016-08-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been a prominent researcher in the field of [[nuclear medicine|nuclear medical]] [[brain imaging]] and [[neurotheology]]. In particular, his research has focused on the development of neurotransmitter tracers for the evaluation of [[Religion|religiosity]] as well as neurological and psychiatric disorders including [[clinical depression]], [[head injury]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], and [[Parkinson's disease]].

His book Principles of Neurotheology gives a basic understanding on the research done so far on Neurotheology.

==Professional career==
Newberg graduated from [[Haverford College]] in 1988 with a degree in chemistry and then received his medical degree in 1993 from the University of Pennsylvania. He then completed postgraduate training in [[Internal Medicine]] with a Residency at the Graduate Hospital from 1993 to 1996, and then did a Fellowship in Nuclear Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania Department of Radiology from 1996 to 1998. He was certified in Internal Medicine by the American Board of Internal Medicine in 1997 and certified in Nuclear Medicine by the American Board of Nuclear Medicine in 1998.

Because of his work in the intersection between religion and the brain, he has become an adjunct assistant professor in the Department of Religious Studies at the University of Pennsylvania. From 2005 to 2010 he was also the Director of the Center for Spirituality and the Mind.

==Academic research==
In the early 1990s, he began to research the intersection between the brain and [[Religious experience|religious and spiritual experiences]]. In this work, also sometimes referred to as “[[neurotheology]]”, Newberg described the possible neurophysiological mechanisms associated with religious and spiritual experiences.&lt;ref name="religionandbrain"&gt;Begley, Sharon. "[http://www.newsweek.com/id/79341/output/print Religion And The Brain]",  [[Newsweek]], 2001-05-07.&lt;/ref&gt;  His initial research included the use of functional brain imaging to study [[Buddhist meditation|Buddhist meditators]]&lt;ref&gt;Newberg AB, Alavi A, Baime M, Pourdehnad M, Santanna J, d'Aquili EG.  The measurement of regional cerebral blood flow during the complex cognitive task of meditation: A preliminary SPECT study.  Psychiatry Research:  Neuroimaging 106: 113-122, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Franciscan]] [[nun]]s in prayer.&lt;ref&gt;Newberg A, Pourdehnad M, Alavi A, d’Aquili E. Cerebral blood flow during meditative prayer: Preliminary findings and methodological issues. Perceptual and Motor Skills 97: 625-630, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; This work was eventually published in three books, ''The Mystical Mind'', ''Why God Won’t Go Away'', and ''Why We Believe What We Believe''.

Newberg's research has been featured in ''[[Newsweek]],'' the ''[[Los Angeles Times]],'' and the ''[[New Scientist]].''  He has been a guest speaker at the Forum at Grace Cathedral&lt;ref name="NewbergHerzfeldForum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gracecathedral.org/enrichment/forum/for_20010506.shtml |title=God in Our Minds? |authors=Guests: Andrew Newberg, [[University of Pennsylvania Health System]] researcher in [[neurophysiology]], and Noreen Herzfeld, [[College of Saint Benedict/Saint John's University|St. John's University]] professor of [[theology]] and [[computer science]] |work=The Forum at [[Grace Cathedral, San Francisco|Grace Cathedral]] |date=6 May 2001 |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080129171706/http://www.gracecathedral.org/enrichment/forum/for_20010506.shtml |archivedate=29 January 2008 }} (Includes [[RealAudio]] links).&lt;/ref&gt;  and appeared in the films ''[[What the Bleep Do We Know!?]]'' and ''[[Religulous]]''. He has continued to study religious and spiritual phenomena including topics related to forgiveness, meditation, prayer, spiritual development, morality, and belief.  This work has been incorporated more recently into a new Center for Spirituality and the Mind at the University of Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;“New Center for Spirituality and the Mind at Penn Unites Intellectual Resources” Newswise (April 25, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary activities==
Newberg is the author of six books, and numerous articles on neuroimaging in neuropsychiatric disorders and also on [[neuroscience and religion]]. His book, ''Why God Won’t Go Away'', is a popularized account of this topic which describes some of the brain imaging studies and his theories regarding the nature of religious and spiritual experiences. ''Why We Believe What We Believe'', co-authored with Mark Robert Waldman (Executive MBA Faculty, Loyola Marymount University) describes the relationship between the brain and beliefs and also describes brain imaging studies of an [[atheist]] and individuals speaking in tongues (or [[glossolalia]]).&lt;ref&gt;“Tongues on the Mind”. Science (November 10, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent book, ''How Enlightenment Changes Your Brain'', also co-authored with Waldman, is a scientific and practical look at how faith and meditation can enhance brain function. Steering away from the topic of faith, his latest book, co-authored with Mark Waldman, ''Words Can Change Your Brain'' describes how a research-based communication practice, "compassionate communication", can be used to improve brain health and interpersonal communication. The book and communication strategies are now part of the NeuroLeadership course offered in the EMBA program at Loyola Marymount University. The communication strategies have been documented and published in the ''Journal of Executive Education''.&lt;ref&gt;http://digitalcommons.kennesaw.edu/jee/vol11/iss1/3/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{expand section|date=December 2015}}
Newberg’s research has been criticized from two main perspectives.{{non sequitur|date=July 2016}}  From the religious perspective, concerns have been raised that the study of practices such as meditation does not necessarily extrapolate to the broader array of religious and spiritual phenomena.&lt;ref name="religionandbrain"/&gt; However, Newberg tends to agree with this concern and has argued that future studies are needed to elucidate the more complex elements of religious and spiritual phenomena. Newberg has maintained that science and brain imaging studies are only tools to evaluate the brain during such experiences but do not necessarily negate such experiences. Newberg has argued that the integration of science and religion is critical for a better understanding of how human beings think and behave in a global context.

'''Anna Brackett''' (1836&amp;ndash;1911) was a female philosopher known for being a translator, feminist, and an educator. She is known for being one of the most important educators among women, but her philosophical achievements are oftentimes overlooked. She translated [[Johann Karl Friedrich Rosenkranz|Karl Rosenkranz's]] ''Pedagogics as a System'' and wrote ''The Education of American Girls'', a response to arguments against the coeducation of males and females.

==Life==
Anna Callender Brackett was born May 21, 1836 to Samuel and Caroline Brackett and the oldest of five children. Her father was a dry goods merchant on Milk Street in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], and the family lived in [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward T. James, Janet Wilson James, Paul S. Boyer, ''Notable American Women, 1607–1950: A Biographical Dictionary'' (1971)

https://books.google.com/books?id=VYMqAAAAYAAJ
1855 - Boston (Mass.)&lt;/ref&gt; Brackett attended private and public schools in [[Boston]] and [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]] and [[Abbot Academy]]. In 1856 she graduated from the state teaching school in [[Framingham, Massachusetts]], now known at [[Framingham State University]]. She served as a teacher in [[East Brookfield, Massachusetts]] and then as an assistant principal in the teaching school in Framingham. In 1861, Anna became vice principal in [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. At the start of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], she was forced to leave for New Orleans and then St. Louis where she met with the St. Louis [[Hegelianism|Hegelians]] and later published the first English translation of several philosophical works.{{sfn|Rogers|2005|p=73-74}} After briefly returning to Cambridge, Massachusetts and teaching at the high school there, she then went back to St. Louis.&lt;ref&gt;Brackett, Anna Callenderlocked
(21 May 1836–18 March 1911)
Susan M. Lloyd http://www.anb.org/view/10.1093/anb/9780198606697.001.0001/anb-9780198606697-e-0900107&lt;/ref&gt;

One of her biggest accomplishments came in 1863 when she was appointed principal of the St. Louis Normal School ([[Harris-Stowe State College]]), the first female principal of secondary school in the United States. During her tenure, Brackett worked to ensure female students had access to higher education and liberal studies as preparation for professional teaching. She made two proposals to the Board of Education that were eventually adopted. The first proposal was an age requirement for entrance to the school. Second, there should be an entrance exam for admission to the St. Louis Normal School. In 1872 Anna Brackett resigned as principal after there were changes in the curriculum that went against her beliefs. She moved to New York City with her domestic partner, [[Ida M. Eliot]], the daughter of Congressman [[Thomas D. Eliot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Travelers' Charleston: Accounts of Charleston and Lowcountry, South Carolina, 1666-1861|last=Fant|first=Jennie Holton|publisher=Univ of South Carolina Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=Columbia, South Carolina|pages=|oclc=930704223}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair adopted their first daughter, Hope, in 1873 and their second daughter, Bertha, in 1875. In New York, Brackett started The Brackett School for Girls, located at 9 West 39th Street, and she hired notable female teachers such as [[Mary Mitchell Birchall]], the first woman to receive a bachelor's degree from a New England college.&lt;ref&gt;The Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine, Volume 44, edited by Richard Watson Gilder, p.980&lt;/ref&gt; Among Brackett's pupils was [[Ruth Sawyer]], in whose Newbery Award-winning semi-autobiographical children's novel, ''[[Roller Skates]]'', Brackett is remembered fondly as an imposing but beloved educator. Anna Brackett retired from teaching in 1894 and died in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1911/03/19/104858941.pdf "Miss Anna C Brackett" (obituary)]&lt;/ref&gt; Brackett's brother, George, a Harvard graduate, and her two sisters ran a school in Brooklyn, New York. A biography of Brackett was published upon her death, entitled: [https://archive.org/details/cu31924031758125 Anna C. Brackett, in Memoriam, MDCCCXXXVI-MDCCCCXI: An Appreciation (1915)].

==Works==
In 1874, Brackett published ''The Education of American Girls'', an essay that applied Rosenkranz's theory of education to girls. In this essay, Brackett observes that a young woman must be guided through two steps of the learning process, the "perceptive stage" and "conceptual stage." In her opinion, no girl can excel in life without attaining both of these steps. Her thoughts were that an education which merely stops at the conceptual stage is not adequate. If undereducated and untrained in abstract thinking, women are at risk to becoming arbitrary if they were to become active in public affairs. Brackett made the point that if women are confined only to the family circle and taking care of the home, they will not be able to fully develop morally and intellectually. This would cause girls to lose their chance at asserting their independence or compete with others and gain the confidence needed to be successful in the public realm. Men, however, automatically enter into the public realm where they become independent persons, separate from the family. Brackett makes the argument that without being able to grow outside their homes, women face two dangers. The first danger is they grow to be ineffective in the public realm and perpetuate the stereotype of the "incompetent woman." The second danger is to a woman's well-being, risking becoming vulnerable to exploitation by men. This essay was the foundation to Brackett's belief that coeducation is important and necessary in the American education system.{{sfn|Rogers|2005|p=75-77}}

Brackett wrote extensively regarding education and philosophy and published writings in [[Harper's Magazine]] and other well known publications.  She also published ''The Education of American Girls'' and served as an editor of [[New England Journal of Education]].

'''Benny Lévy''' (also '''Pierre Victor'''; 1945–2003) was a philosopher, political activist and author. A political figure of [[May 1968 in France]], he was the disciple and last personal secretary of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] from 1974 to 1980.
Along with him, he helped founding the French newspaper ''[[Libération]]'' in 1972.

After having encountered the [[Jewish philosophy]] of [[Emmanuel Levinas]] in 1978, he operated a return to tradition. He then founded the [[Institut d'études lévinassiennes]] in Jerusalem with [[Alain Finkielkraut]] and [[Bernard-Henri Lévy]].

Benny Lévy is known for his unusual itinerary from [[Maoism]] to [[Judaism]], or "from Mao to Moses", which was also followed by a few other philosophers of his generation.

== May 68 and the Gauche prolétarienne ==
Born in Egypt, Benny Lévy grew up without experiencing Judaism as a faith. He left Egypt after the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956 and immigrated to Belgium then France with his family. His elder half-brother, Eddy Lévy, stayed in Egypt, converted to Islam in 1956 and changed his name to Adil Rifaat.&lt;ref&gt;Mahmoud Hussein, jumeaux de l'islam. Le Monde, 1 March 05&lt;/ref&gt; The historian of mathematics [[Tony Lévy (mathematician)|Tony Lévy]] is his brother.

Benny Lévy  soon proved to be a brilliant student and completed his studies at the [[École Normale Supérieure]], learning under such key intellectual figures as [[Marxist philosopher]] [[Louis Althusser]] and [[Jacques Derrida]], founder of [[deconstruction]]. He entered the [[Union des étudiants communistes]] (UEC), a student communist group, and then at his foundation in 1966 the Maoist [[Union des jeunesses communistes marxistes-léninistes]] (UJC - ml). He became one of the main leader of this latter organization after [[Robert Linhart]]. Benny Lévy was an important figure during the [[May 1968 in France|May 68 Student Revolt]]. After these events, the direction of the UJC-ml was put in minority, and founded the Maoist [[Gauche prolétarienne]] (GP, Proletarian Left). Taking the pseudonym of Pierre Victor, Benny Lévy was one of its main leaders, along with [[Alain Geismar]].

As editor of the Maoist newspaper ''[[La Cause du Peuple]]'' (The Cause of the People), he was arrested repeatedly by the French police, who were determined to suppress the unrest. By 1970, with arrests occurring more frequently, Lévy and the other editors decided to turn to [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], whom they knew benefited from protection to police harassment. Sartre responded by adding his name to the list of editors, and the arrests indeed stopped. It was then discovered by the government that the proletarian leftwing leader Pierre Victor was, in fact, a [[Stateless person|stateless]] [[refugee]]. The passport given to him by the [[United Nations]] was confiscated, and he was ordered to appear at the local police station once every two weeks with his relatives and a lawyer. 
The organisation was outlawed in 1970. As stateless and leader of an outlawed organisation, Benni Lévy was forced to [[wiktionary:clandestinity|clandestinity]] until 1973, date of the auto-dissolving of the GP. By this point, however, Lévy had developed a very amicable relationship with Sartre, who decided to make him his protégé and asked him to serve as his personal secretary, which he remained from September 1974 till Sartre's death in 1980. Sartre interceded to President [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]], and Lévy was [[French nationality|naturalized]].

== The thought of the Return ==
During these six years, Lévy worked with Sartre, and the two men produced four books until Sartre's death. While working with Sartre, Lévy began to discover Judaism, initially through his research into the [[Kabbalah]], which he conducted with his mentor. Their work together created a stir among the circle that surrounded Sartre, because Sartre had begun introducing new ideas and terms that evoked religious and, more specifically, Jewish concepts, such as Redemption and [[Messiah|Messianism]]. Some, including [[Simone de Beauvoir]] began accusing Lévy of brainwashing Sartre and faking his writings. After this Ms de Beauvoir and Mr Levy were no longer on speaking terms. Two months before his death, Sartre responded to these critics, claiming that he had indeed abandoned some of his earlier ideas. {{citation needed|date=April 2008}} In 1978, Lévy encountered Levinas, and started learning Hebrew and beginning [[Talmud]]ic studies.

Starting in 1975, he taught at the [[University of Paris-VII]], founded in the wake of May 68, before obtaining a doctorate in philosophy at the [[Sorbonne University|Sorbonne]] in 1985, and a habilitation to direct researches (HDR) in philosophy in 1998, under the direction of [[Dominique Lecourt]] at Paris-VII.

Benny Lévy embraced Jewish Orthodoxy, and began to study in a [[yeshiva]] in [[Strasbourg]]. He finally immigrated to [[Israel]] in 1997, where he established the [[Institut d'études lévinassiennes]] in Jerusalem along with [[Bernard-Henri Lévy]] and [[Alain Finkielkraut]], and learned with Rabbi Moshe Shapira. He died suddenly during the holiday of [[Sukkot]] in 2003. In ''Etre Juif'', he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To be Jewish. To be, in an absolutely singular manner... a thought of the Return. The Return to the Sinaï... The thought of the Return (''la pensée du Retour'') requires a critique of the atheology of the modern jew &lt;!-- no capital in text --&gt;. Theology of the silence of God after Auschwitz, critique of [[theodicy]], finally return to the notion of absolute Evil, these are the points through which one must pass in a critical manner. In this sense, this book addresses itself at any man, insofar as he is still sensible to the question of the origin of evil.&lt;ref&gt;French: ''« Être Juif. Être, de manière radicalement singulière ; être, irrémissiblement rivé à son judaïsme comme le dit Emmanuel Lévinas, présent tout le long des lignes de ce texte. À partir de cette facticité juive, s'esquissent quelques propositions pour une pensée du Retour. Retour au Sinaï. Là précisément où le juif est rivé. La pensée du Retour requiert une critique de l'athéologie du juif moderne. Théologie du silence de Dieu après Auschwitz, critique de la théodicée, enfin recours à la notion de Mal absolu, voilà les points par où il faut passer de manière critique. En ce sens, ce livre s'adresse à tout homme pour autant qu'il est encore sensible à la question de l'origine du Mal. »''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Gnosticism}}
'''Bogomilism''' ({{lang-bg|Богомилство}}, {{lang-sh|Bogumilstvo/Богумилство}}) was a [[Christian Gnosticism|Christian neo-Gnostic]] or [[Dualistic cosmology|dualist]] [[sect]] founded in the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] by the priest [[Bogomil (priest)|Bogomil]] during the reign of [[Peter I of Bulgaria|Tsar Peter I]] in the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rnggrHo-dqUC&amp;pg=PA108 |title=Heresy and authority in medieval Europe: documents in translation, Middle Ages University of Pennsylvania Press Middle ages series |first=Edward |last=Peters |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |year=1980 |isbn=0-8122-1103-0 |page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YbS9QmwDC58C&amp;pg=PA172 |title=The early medieval Balkans: a critical survey from the sixth to the late twelfth century |first=John |last=Van Antwerp Fine |publisher=University of Michigan Press |year=1991 |isbn=0-472-08149-7 |page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ylz4fe7757cC&amp;pg=PA19 |title=A concise history of Bulgaria, Cambridge concise histories |first=R.

The Bogomils called for a return to what they considered to be early spiritual teaching, rejecting the [[Ecclesiology|ecclesiastical hierarchy]], and their primary political tendencies were resistance to the state and church authorities. This helped the movement spread quickly in the [[Balkans]], gradually expanding throughout the [[Byzantine Empire]] and later reaching [[Kievan Rus']], [[Banate of Bosnia|Bosnia]] ([[Bosnian Church]]), [[Dalmatia]], [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Serbia]], [[Italy]], and [[France]] ([[Cathars]]).

The Bogomils were [[Dualistic cosmology|dualists]] or [[Gnostics]] in that they believed in a world within the body and a world outside the body. They did not use the Christian [[Christian cross|cross]], nor build [[church (building)|church]]es, as they revered their gifted form and considered their body to be the temple. This gave rise to many forms of practice to cleanse oneself through purging{{clarify|date=May 2016}}, [[fasting]], celebrating and dancing.

== Etymology ==
The term ''Bogomil'' in free translation means "dear to God", and is a compound of the [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] words for "god" ([[Common Slavic]]: [[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Slavic/bogъ|*bogъ]]) and "dear" (Common Slavic: *milъ). It may be also a translation of the Greek name ''Theophilos'', literally "dear to God; loved by the gods," from ''theos'' "god" + ''philos'' "loved, beloved". It is difficult to ascertain whether the name was taken from the reputed founder of that movement, the priest Bogomil (Bulgarian: Богомил), or whether he assumed that name after it had been given to the sect itself. The word is an [[Old Church Slavonic]] [[calque]] of ''Massaliani'', the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] name of the sect corresponding to the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[Euchites]]. The Bogomils are identified with the [[Messalians]] in Slavonic documents from the 13th century.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The members are referred to as ''Babuni'' in [[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]] documents, which originally meant "superstition; superstitious person" (Common Slavic ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Slavic/babonъ|*babonъ, *babunъ *babona]]''). Toponyms which retain the name include the river [[Babuna (river)|Babuna]], the mountain [[Babuna (mountain)|Babuna]], the [[Bogomila Waterfall]] and village [[Bogomila]], all in the [[Azot (region)|region of Azot]] today in central [[Republic of Macedonia]], suggesting that the movement was very active in the region.&lt;ref name='obolensky1'&gt;{{cite book |last= Obolensky |first= Dimitry|authorlink= |coauthors= |title= The Bogomils: A study in Balkan Neo-Manicheism |year= 1948|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]|location= |isbn= 0-521-58262-8|editor=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='czech'&gt;{{cite book |last= Loos |first= Milan|authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Dualist heresy in the Middle Ages |year= 1974|publisher= [[Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences]]|location= |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources==
Much of their literature has been [[Lost works|lost]] or [[Book burning|destroyed]] by the contemporary [[Christian Churches]]. The earliest description of the Bogomils is in a letter from Patriarch Theophylact of Bulgaria to Tsar Peter of Bulgaria, and the main source of doctrinal information is the work of [[Euthymius Zigabenus]], who says that they believe that God created man's soul but matter was the invention of Satan, God's older son, who in seducing Eve lost his creative power.&lt;ref name=pachomius&gt;[http://www.voskrese.info/spl/Xbogomil.html "Bogomils" at St. Pachomius Library]&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning the Bogomils, something can be gathered from the polemic ''Against the Newly-Appeared Heresy of the Bogomils'' written in [[Old Church Slavonic|Slavonic]] by [[Cosmas the Priest]], a 10th-century Bulgarian official. The old Slavonic lists of forbidden books of the 15th and 16th century also give us a clue to the discovery of this heretical literature and of the means the Bogomils employed to carry on their [[teachings]]. Much may also be learned from the doctrines of the numerous variations of Bogomilism which spread in Medieval [[Kievan Rus']] after the 11th century.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==History==
{{original research|date=December 2010}}

===Paulicians===
{{main|Paulicianism}}
One of the earliest Christian dualist "heresies", [[Marcionism]], originated in eastern Anatolia.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrman, Bart D. Lost Christianities: The battles for scripture and the faiths we never knew. Oxford University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The church Marcion himself established, appeared to die out around the 5th century, although similarities between Marcionism and [[Paulicianism]], a sect in the same geographical area, indicate that Marcionist elements may have survived.&lt;ref&gt;Helmut Koester, ''History and Literature of Early Christianity'', 2nd edition, (Walter de Gruyter &amp; Co., 2000), 9. https://books.google.com/books?id=oZQgAAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA9l&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; Paulicianism began in the mid-7th century, when [[Constantine-Silvanus|Constantine of Mananalis]], basing his message solely on the New Testament, began to teach that there were two gods: a good god who had made men's souls, and an evil god who had created the entire physical universe including the human body. His followers, who became known as [[Paulicians]], were not marked by extreme deviance in lifestyle compared to contemporaries, despite their belief that the world was evil, and were renowned as good fighting men.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medievalsources.co.uk/dualist.htm Hamilton, Janet and Bernard, ''Christian dualist heresies in the Byzantine world, c.650-c.1450'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In 970 the Byzantine emperor [[John I Tzimiskes]] transplanted 200,000 Armenian Paulicians to Europe and settled them in the neighbourhood of Philippopolis (today's [[Plovdiv]] in Thrace). Under Byzantine and then later Ottoman rule, the Armenian Paulicians lived in relative safety in their ancient stronghold near [[Plovdiv|Philippopolis]], and further northward. Linguistically, they were assimilated into the [[Bulgarians]], by whom they were called ''pavlikiani'' (the [[Byzantine Greek]] word for Paulician). In 1650, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] gathered them into its fold. Fourteen villages near [[Nikopol, Bulgaria|Nicopolis]], in [[Moesia]], embraced Catholicism, as well as the villages around Philippopolis. A colony of Paulicians in the Wallachian village of {{Interlanguage link multi|Cioplea|ro}} near [[Bucharest]] also followed the example of their brethren across the [[Danube]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

===Origins===
[[File:Great Schism 1054 with former borders.png|thumb|right|The religious distribution at the time of the [[East–West Schism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cartileonline.eu/carte/1025738/dragan-brujia-vodia-kroz-svet-vizantijeDragan |title=Vodič kroz svet Vizantije (Guide to the Byzantine World) |accessdate= |author=Dragan Brujić |authorlink= |year=2005 |work= |publisher=Beograd |page=51 |language= |quote= |df= }}{{dead link|date=January 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; showing Bogomils concentrated in the Balkans.]]
The [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] social-religious movement and doctrine originated in the time of [[Peter I of Bulgaria]] (927&amp;ndash;969), alleged in the modern day to be a reaction against state and clerical oppression of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Byzantine church]]. In spite of all measures of repression, it remained strong and popular until the fall of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] in the end of the 14th century. Bogomilism was an outcome of many factors that had arisen in the beginning of the 10th century, most probably in the region of Macedonia.  It was also strongly influenced by the [[Paulicians]] who had been driven out of [[Armenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.reformedreader.org/history/brockett/bogomils.htm |title=Bogomils of Bulgaria and Bosnia | work =The Reformed Reader}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Slavonic sources are unanimous on the point that Bogomil's teaching was Manichaean. A ''Synodikon'' from the year 1210 adds the names of his pupils or "apostles", Mihail, Todur, Dobri, Stefan, Vasilie and Peter. Zealous missionaries carried their doctrines far and wide. In 1004, scarcely 25 years after the introduction of Christianity into [[Kievan Rus]], we hear of a priest Adrian teaching the same doctrines as the Bogomils. He was imprisoned by Leontius, Bishop of [[Kiev]]. In 1125, the Church in the south of [[Kievan Rus'|Rus]] had to combat another heresiarch named Dmitri. The Church in Bulgaria also tried to extirpate Bogomilism. Several thousand went in the army of [[Alexios I Komnenos]] against the [[Normans|Norman]], [[Robert Guiscard]]; but, deserting the emperor, many of them (1085) were thrown into prison.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Efforts were again put forth for their conversion; and for the converts the new city of [[Alexiopolis]] was built, opposite Philippopolis. When the [[Fourth Crusade|Crusaders]] took [[Constantinople]] (1204), they found some [[Paulicians]], whom the historian [[Geoffrey of Villehardouin]] calls Popelicans.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

The Legend of Saint Gerard discloses that followers of Bulgarian Bogomilism were present during the early 11th century in [[Ahtum]]'s realm, which comprised present day [[Banat]]. They invoked [[Archangel]] [[Uriel]], whose name is common in [[amulets]] and magic [[rituals]].{{Citation needed | date = May 2014}}

=== Spread of bogomilism in the Balkans ===
[[File:Nemanjin sabor.jpg|thumb|left|Council against Bogomilism, organized by [[Stefan Nemanja]]. Fresco from 1290]]

The Bogomils spread westwards and settled in [[Serbia]], where they were to be known as Babuns (''Babuni''). At the end of the 12th century [[Serbian Grand Prince]] [[Stefan Nemanja]] and the Serbian council deemed Bogomilism a [[heresy]], and expelled them from the country. Large numbers took refuge in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] and [[Dalmatia]] where they were known under the name of Patarenes (''Patareni'').&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Providing refuge to heretics, including bogomils, was a recurrent pretext for Hungarian rulers to declare [[crusades against Bosnia]] and extend their influence in the region. A first Hungarian complaint to the Pope was averted by the public abjuration of the Bosnian ruler [[Ban Kulin]] in 1203.&lt;ref&gt;Thierry Mudry, Histoire de la Bosnie-Herzégovine faits et controverses, Éditions Ellipses, 1999 (chapitre 2: La Bosnie médiévale p. 25 à 42 et chapitre 7 : La querelle historiographique p. 255 à 265). Dennis P. Hupchick et Harold E. Cox, Les Balkans Atlas Historique, Éditions Economica, Paris, 2008, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; A second Hungarian crusade against Bosnia on bogomil heresy pretext was launched in 1225, but failed. In 1254, rebelling against the Papal order to accept a Hungarian bishop, the [[Bosnian Church]] chose the schism. In the following centuries, the Bosnian Church (autonomous from Rome but mainly following Catholic doctrine) and the heretic sect of the bogomils came to be identified with each other, due to the scarcity of documents after the Ottoman conquest.&lt;ref&gt;The issue of the false Bogomil hypothesis is accurately dealt with by Noel Malcolm (Bosnia. A Short History) as well as by John V.A. Fine (in Mark Pinson, The Bosnian Muslims)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1203, [[Pope Innocent III]], with the aid of the King of Hungary, forced an agreement of Kulin to acknowledge Papal authority and religion: in practice this was ignored. On the death of Kulin in 1216 a mission was sent to convert Bosnia to Rome but failed. In 1234, the [[Bishop of Bosnia|Catholic Bishop of Bosnia]] was removed by Pope Gregory IX for allowing heretical practices.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Lambert, ''Medieval Heresy:Popular Movements from Bogomil to Hus'', (Edward Arnold Ltd, 1977), 143.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Gregory called on the Hungarian king to crusade against the heretics.&lt;ref&gt;''Christian Dualist Heresies in the Byzantine World, C. 650-c. 1450'', ed. Janet Hamilton, Bernard Hamilton, Yuri Stoyanov, (Manchester University Press, 1998), 48-49.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Bosnian nobles were able to expel the Hungarians.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Lambert, ''Medieval Heresy:Popular Movements from Bogomil to Hus'', 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1252, Pope [[Innocent IV]] decided to put Bosnia's bishop under the Hungarian Kalocsa jurisdiction. Such decision provoked the schism of the Bosnian Christians, who refused to submit to the Hungarians and broke off their relations with Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Mudry 1999; Hupchick and Cox 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In that way, an autonomous Bosnian Church came into being, in which some later saw a Bogomil or Cathar Church, while in reality no trace of bogomilism, [[cathars|Catharism]] or [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] can be found in the original documents of the Bosnian Christians.&lt;ref&gt;The issue of the false Bogomil hypothesis is accurately dealt with by [[Noel Malcolm]] (''Bosnia. A Short History'') as well as by John V.A. Fine (in Mark Pinson, ''The Bosnian Muslims'')&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until Pope Nicholas' Bull "''Prae cunctis''" in 1291 that the Franciscans-led inquisition was imposed on Bosnia.&lt;ref&gt;Mitja Velikonja, ''Religious Separation and Political Intolerance in Bosnia-Herzegovina'', transl. Rang'ichi Ng'inga, (Texas A&amp;M University Press, 2003), 35.&lt;/ref&gt; The Inquisition reported of  the existence of a dualist sect in Bosnia in the late 15th century and called them "Bosnian heretics", but this sect was most likely not the same as the [[Bosnian Church]].

Bogomilism was eradicated in Bulgaria and Byzantium in the 13th century, but survived in Bosnia and Herzegovina until the Ottoman Empire gained control of the region in 1463. Both Catholics and Orthodox persecuted the Bogomils as heretics. The early pressures by its Catholic and Orthodox neighbours drew Bosnia to Bogomilism. Later, with the introduction of Ottoman rule, Bosnians were often more likely to convert to Islam since they were not friends of either the Roman Catholic or Serb Orthodox churches.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

From Bosnia, their influence extended into Italy ([[Piedmont (Italy)|Piedmont]]). The Hungarians undertook many crusades against the heretics in Bosnia, but towards the close of the 15th century, the conquest of that country by the Turks put an end to their persecution. Few or no remnants of Bogomilism have survived in Bosnia. The Ritual in Slavonic written by the Bosnian Radoslav, and published in vol. xv. of the ''Starine of the South Slavonic Academy at Agram'', shows great resemblance to the [[Cathar]] ritual published by Cunitz, 1853.&lt;ref&gt;[[Franjo Rački]], "Bogomili i Paternai" in ''[[Rad (journal)|Rad]]'', vols. vii., viii. and x. (Zagreb, 1870)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dollinger, Beiträge zur Ketzergeschichte des Mittelalters, 2 vols. (Munich, 1890).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, the Paulician people from around [[Nikopol, Bulgaria|Nicopolis]] were persecuted by the Turks, presumably on religious grounds{{Citation needed | date = January 2015}}, and a good part of them fled across the [[Danube]] and settled in the [[Banat]] region that was part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] at the time, and became known as [[Banat Bulgarians]]{{Citation needed | date = January 2015}}. There are still over ten thousand Banat Bulgarians in [[Banat]] today in the villages of [[Dudeştii Vechi]], [[Vinga]], [[Denta|Breştea]] and also in the city of [[Timişoara]], with a few in [[Arad, Romania|Arad]]; however, they no longer practice Bogomilism, having converted to [[Roman Catholicism]]. There are also a few villages of Paulicians in the Serbian part of [[Banat]], especially the villages of [[Ivanovo, Serbia|Ivanovo]] and Belo Blato, near [[Pančevo]].

=== Social factors ===
The gradual Christianization of the Bulgarian population, the fact that the service was initially practiced in Greek, which only the elite knew, resulted in a low level of understanding of the religion among the peasantry. Due to the constant wars during the time of [[Simeon I of Bulgaria|Simeon I]], the lands near the Byzantine border ([[Thrace]]) were devastated, and the people living there were left without occupation. The constant change of authority over these lands, and the higher taxes during the time of Tsar Peter I, gave birth to a great social discontent at the beginning of the 10th century. Moreover, the corruption of the church as an institution, led to grave disappointment among its recently converted flock.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

=== Religious factors ===
The existence of older Christian heresies in the Bulgarian lands ([[Manichaeism]] and [[Paulicianism]]), which were considered very [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]], influenced the Bogomil movement. Manichaeism's origin is related to [[Zoroastrianism]]; that is why Bogomilism is sometimes indirectly connected to Zoroastrianism in the sense of its duality.

=== Connections to the royal court ===

Some historians claim that tsar [[Samuil of Bulgaria]] and in particular his son [[Gavril Radomir of Bulgaria|Gavril Radomir]] supported the movement{{Citation needed | date = January 2015}}. The core of Bulgarian empire then corresponded to the region where the Bogomils were most active. Most probably, as Samuil revolted against the Byzantine Empire, he relied on the popular support of the movement. There are no sources of Bogomil persecution during his reign (976–1014).&lt;ref name='obolensky1' /&gt;

== Doctrine ==

===Source texts===
Possible source texts for Bogomil doctrine include:
* The Bulgarian priest [[Jeremiah (Bulgarian priest)|Jeremiah]]'s "The Story of the Cross-tree" and "The Prayer against Fever"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | series = Dissertation abstracts international | publisher = University Microfilms International | year = 1994 | quote = ...texts ascribed to him: ‘The Story of the Cross-tree’ and ‘The Prayer against Fever,’ two genuine Bogomil texts providing a clear understanding of the basic tenets of the Bogomil heretical movement of the tenth-eleventh centuries.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teaching===
The Bogomils had a system of altered traditional orthodox beliefs and rituals. The essence behind their teaching was a dualistic doctrine that the world is divided by God and Satan (good and evil). God rules the spiritual part of the world, and Satan the material. They regarded every material being to be the work of Satan. They also opposed established forms of government and church as alike to [[anarchists|anarchism]] (see [[Christian anarchism]]).

From the imperfect and conflicting data that is available, one positive result can be gathered that the Bogomils were both [[Adoptionist]]s and [[Manichaeism|Manichaeans]]. They had accepted the teaching of [[Paul of Samosata]], though at a later period the name of Paul was believed to be that of the Apostle; and they were not quite free from the Dualistic principle of the Gnostics, at a later period too much identified with the teaching of Mani, by Photius, Petrus Siculus, and other authors. They rejected the Christianity of the Orthodox churches and did not accept the docetic teaching of some of the other sects.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

=== Dualist beliefs and customs ===
The Bogomils taught that God had two sons, the elder Satanail and the younger Michael.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Bogomils|title=1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Bogomils|accessdate= 20 October 2018|year= 1911|quote= Bogomils taught that God had two sons, the elder Satanail and the younger Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; The elder son rebelled against the father and became the evil spirit. After his fall, he created the lower heavens and the Earth and tried in vain to create man; in the end, he had to appeal to God for the Spirit. After creation, Adam was allowed to till the ground on condition that he sold himself and his posterity to the owner of the Earth. Then, Michael was sent in the form of a man; he became identified with Jesus and was "elected" by God after the baptism in the Jordan. When the Holy Ghost (again Michael) appeared in the shape of the dove, Jesus received power to break the covenant in the form of a clay tablet (''hierographon'') held by Satanail from Adam. He had now become the angel Michael in a human form; as such he vanquished Satanail, and deprived him of the termination -''il'' = God, in which his power resided. Satanail was thus transformed into Satan. Through his machinations the crucifixion took place, and Satan was the originator of the whole Orthodox community with its churches, vestments, ceremonies, sacraments and fasts, with its monks and priests. This world being the work of Satan, the perfect must eschew any and every excess of its pleasure. But the Bogomils did not go so far as to recommend asceticism.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

They held the "Lord's Prayer" in high respect as the most potent weapon against Satan, and had a number of conjurations against "evil spirits". Each community had its own twelve "apostles", and women could be raised to the rank of "elect". The Bogomils wore garments like [[Mendicant orders|mendicant friars]] and were known as keen missionaries, travelling far and wide to propagate their doctrines. Healing the sick and exorcising the evil spirit, they traversed different countries and spread their apocryphal literature along with some of the books of the Old Testament, deeply influencing the religious spirit of the nations and preparing them for the Reformation.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; They accepted the four Gospels, fourteen Epistles of Paul, the three Epistles of John, James, Jude, and an Epistle to the Laodiceans, which they professed to have. They sowed the seeds of a rich, popular religious literature in the East as well as the West. The Historiated Bible, the Letter from Heaven, the Wanderings through Heaven and Hell, the numerous Adam and Cross legends, the religious poems of the "Kalēki perehozhie" and other similar productions owe their dissemination to a large extent to the activity of the Bogomils of Bulgaria, and their successors in other lands.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

=== Christology and the Trinity ===
For Bogomils "the [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]] was not the [[God the Son|Second Person of the Blessed Trinity]], the [[incarnation|Eternal Word incarnate]], but merely the spoken word of God, shown in the oral teaching of Christ".&lt;ref&gt;''The Bogomils: A Study in Balkan Neo-Manichaeism'' Page 211 Dimitri Obolensky, 2004 "The Logos was for them not the Second Person of the Blessed Trinity, the Eternal Word incarnate, but merely the spoken word of God, manifested in the oral teaching of Christ.* Hence the Bogomils taught that Christ was ..."&lt;/ref&gt; Although Bogomils regarded themselves as "Trinitarian",&lt;ref&gt;''Contra Patarenos'' Page 39 Hugh Eteriano, Janet Hamilton, Sarah Hamilton, 2004 "He was aware that the Bogomils regarded themselves as Trinitarians: 'Do not be astonished, my brothers', he writes,'… when you hear them say that they believe in Father, Son and Holy Spirit, that they keep the apostles and saints…"&lt;/ref&gt; anathemas against Bogomils (circa 1027) charge Bogomils with rejection of the [[Trinity]].&lt;ref&gt;''Heresy in medieval France: dualism in Aquitaine and the Agenais'', Page 64 Claire Taylor, Royal Historical Society (Great Britain), 2005: "Anathemas against Bogomils were in use in the early decades of the eleventh century, contained in versions of the Synodikon of orthodoxy and included in a euchologion produced in 1027. They attest to Bogomil rejection of the Trinity"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opposition to institutions and materialism ===
{{original research|date=December 2010}}
The essence of Bogomilism is the duality in the creation of the world. This is  why it is considered a heresy by the [[Catholic Church]]. Bogomils explained the earthly sinful corporeal life as a creation of Satan, an angel that was sent to Earth. Due to this duality, the church believes that their doctrine undervalues everything that is created with materialistic and governmental goals and further claims that the doctrine does not come from the soul, the only divine possession of the human.{{Clarify|date=October 2012}} Its followers refused to pay taxes, to work in serfdom, or to fight in conquering wars. They ignored the feudal social system, which was interpreted by their enemies as suggesting disorder if not the destruction of the state and church.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

[[Strigolniki|Karp Strigolnik]], who in the 14th century preached the doctrine in [[Novgorod]], explained that St. Paul had taught that simpleminded men should instruct one another; therefore they elected their "teachers" from among themselves to be their spiritual guides, and had no special priests. There is a tradition that the Bogomils taught that prayers were to be said in private houses, not in separate buildings such as churches. Ordination was conferred by the congregation and not by any specially appointed minister. The congregation were the "elect", and each member could obtain the perfection of Christ and become a Christ or "Chlist". Marriage was not a sacrament. Bogomils refused to fast on Mondays and Fridays, and they rejected monasticism. They declared Christ to be the Son of God only through grace like other prophets, and that the bread and wine of the eucharist were not physically transformed into flesh and blood; that the last judgement would be executed by God and not by Jesus; that the images and the cross were idols and the veneration of saints and relics idolatry.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

These doctrines have survived in the great Russian sects, and can be traced back to the teachings and practice of the Bogomils. But in addition to these doctrines of an adoptionist origin, they held the Manichaean dualistic conception of the origin of the world. This has been partly preserved in some of their literary remains, and has taken deep root in the beliefs and traditions of Balkan nations with substantial Bogomil followings. The chief literature of all the heretical sects throughout the ages has been that of apocryphal Biblical narratives, and the popes Jeremiah or Bogumil are directly mentioned as authors of such forbidden books "which no orthodox dare read". Though these writings are mostly of the same origin as those from the older lists of apocryphal books, they underwent a modification at the hands of their Bogomil editors, so as to be useful for the propagation of their own specific doctrines.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

In its most simple and attractive form—invested with the authority of the reputed holy author—their account of the creation of the world and of man, the origin of sin and redemption, the history of the Cross, and the disputes between body and soul, right and wrong, heaven and hell, were embodied either in "Historiated Bibles" (Paleya) or in special dialogues held between Christ and his disciples, or between renowned Fathers of the Church who expounded these views in a simple manner adapted to the understanding of the people (Lucidaria).&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

== Legacy ==

=== Link with later religious movements ===
The Bogomils were the connecting link between the so-called heretical sects of the East and those of the West. They were, moreover, the most active agents in disseminating such teachings in Kievan Rus' and among all the nations of [[Europe]]. In the 12th and 13th century, the Bogomils were already known in the West as "Cathars" or in other places as "Bulgari", i.e. Bulgarians (българи). In 1207 the ''Bulgarorum heresis'' is mentioned. In 1223 the [[Albigenses]] are declared to be the local Bougres, and in the same period mention is made of the "Pope of the Albigenses who resided within the confines of Bulgaria" (see also [[Nicetas, Bogomil bishop]]). The [[Cathars]] and [[Bosnian Church|Patarenes]], the [[Waldenses]], the [[Anabaptists]], and in Russia the [[Strigolniki]], and [[Spiritual Christians]], have all at different times been either identified with the Bogomils or closely connected with them, even though several of these are unrelated and are not dualist.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Considerable scholarly debate has arisen about the exact relationship between dualist heresies that arose in different places and centuries across medieval Europe, questioning whether it was indeed a single movement or belief system which was spread from one region to the next, or if multiple heretical movements arose independently in different parts of Europe.  Furthering the confusion is that the medieval sources themselves, such as the 13th century papal Inquisition in France, would often simply assume that dualistic heresies were directly connected to previous heretical movements in different regions.  Inquistors often described 13th century Cathars as a direct outgrowth of surviving Manichean dualists from previous centuries—though by the same logic, Inquisitors who encountered pagan religions in the fringes of Europe (Celtic lands, or in the Baltic Crusades) would directly accuse non-Christians of worshiping "Apollo and Mercury", simply applying previous terms and rhetoric to new contexts in which they didn't accurately apply. Thus medieval scholarship is divided over whether the "Cathars" actually were an offshoot of the "Bogomils", or if the 13th century Inquisition itself simply mistook "Cathars" for "Bogomils".

===In modern and popular culture===
In ''[[Foucault's Pendulum]]'', a novel by the [[Italians|Italian]] philosopher and writer [[Umberto Eco]], the plot concerning a widespread secret and mystic conspiracy has its ground in the disappearance of the Bogomils after the fall of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] under the rule of the [[Ottoman Empire]].

''[[The Secret Book]]'' is a [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonian]] [[feature film]] combining the [[Detective fiction|detective]], [[Thriller film|thriller]] and [[conspiracy fiction]] genres, based on a fictional story of the quest for the original Slavic language "Secret Book", written by the Bogomils in Bulgaria and carried to Western Europe during the Middle Ages.

A French and consequently an English word emerged based on twisted perceptions of the Bogomils by the Catholic Church. The words "bouguer" and "[[buggery]]" emerged, by way of the word "bougre" in French, from the [[Latin]] ''Bulgarus'' (Bulgarian). "Buggery" first appears in English in 1330 with the sense "abominable heresy", though "bugger" in a sexual sense is not recorded until 1555.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/24372?redirectedFrom=buggery#eid}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology'' quotes a similar form—"bowgard" (and "bouguer"), but claims that the Bulgarians were heretics "as belonging to the Greek Church, sp. Albigensian". Webster's Third New International Dictionary, gives the only meaning of the word "bugger" as sodomite, "from the adherence of the Bulgarians to the Eastern Church considered heretical"..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Bogomilism Study |url=http://www.bogomilism.eu/Studies/Bugger%20case.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150810053756/http://bogomilism.eu/Studies/Bugger%20case.html |archivedate=2015-08-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bogomil Cove]] on [[Rugged Island (South Shetland Islands)|Rugged Island]] in the [[South Shetland Islands]], [[Antarctica]] is named after Priest Bogomil.

The Bogomils make a significant part in the [[Thomas Pynchon]] novel, [[Against the Day]], when Cyprian Lakewood becomes a postulate and gives up his life of sodomitic servitude as a spy.

'''''Climate Change Denial: Heads in the Sand''''' is a non-fiction book about [[climate change denial]], coauthored by Haydn Washington and John Cook, with a foreword by [[Naomi Oreskes]]. Washington had a background in [[environmental science]] prior to authoring the work, and Cook was educated in [[physics]] and founded the website [[Skeptical Science]] which compiles [[peer review|peer-reviewed evidence]] of [[global warming]]. The book was first published in hardcover and paperback formats in 2011 by [[Earthscan]], a division of [[Routledge]].

The book presents an in-depth analysis and refutation of climate change denial, going over several arguments point-by-point and disproving them with [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] evidence from the [[Scientific opinion on climate change|scientific consensus for climate change]]. The authors assert that those denying climate change engage in tactics including [[cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry picking]] data purported to support their specific viewpoints, and attacking the integrity of [[climate scientists]]. They use [[social science]] theory to examine the phenomenon of climate change denial in the wider public, and call this phenomenon a form of [[pathology]].

The book traces financial support for climate change denial to the [[fossil fuel]] industry, asserting these companies have attempted to influence [[public opinion]] on the matter. Washington and Cook write that politicians have a tendency to use [[weasel word]]s as part of a [[propaganda]] tactic through use of [[Spin (public relations)|spin]], as a way to deflect public interest away from climate change and remain passive on the issue. The authors conclude that if the public ceased engaging in denial, the problem of climate change could be realistically addressed.

For his research on the book, and efforts in communicating the essence of climate change science to the general public, John Cook won the 2011 [[Australian Museum]] [[Eureka Prize]] for Advancement of Climate Change Knowledge.&lt;ref name="honour" /&gt; ''Climate Change Denial'' received a positive reception in reviews from publications including: ''[[The Ecologist]]'',&lt;ref name="ecologist" /&gt; ''[[ECOS (CSIRO magazine)|ECOS]]'' magazine,&lt;ref name="considine" /&gt; [[academic journal]] ''Natures Sciences Sociétés'',&lt;ref name="natures" /&gt; the journal ''Education'' published by the [[New South Wales Teachers Federation]],.&lt;ref name="kitson" /&gt; An article in ''[[The New American]]'' was critical, describing the labels of "deniers" and "denialists" as cruel and forms of [[character assassination]].&lt;ref name="jasper" /&gt;

The authors discuss the broader concept of [[denial]] using social science theory, noting its occurrence appears in society when individuals are frightened or ashamed of their actions.&lt;ref name="natures" /&gt; They write that these motivations, when expanded from an individual to wider society, present themselves as a form of [[disease]].&lt;ref name="ecologist" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kitson" /&gt; The book identifies climate change denial itself as a pathology afflicting the culture of the planet.&lt;ref name="ecologist" /&gt;&lt;ref name="natures" /&gt; The authors lament that an inverse relationship exists between an increasing scientific consensus regarding climate change, and a simultaneous increase in denial within the greater public about the same issue.&lt;ref name="natures" /&gt;

The book identifies a corporate underpinning influencing public opinion by way of companies which derive profit from the fossil fuel industry.&lt;ref name="ecologist" /&gt;&lt;ref name="natures" /&gt; Washington and Cook write that politicians often use weasel words as a form of spin and propaganda, in order to act as if they are going to do something about climate change, while in actuality remaining passive on the issue.&lt;ref name="natures" /&gt; The authors go on to identify a greater level of denial&amp;nbsp;— within the wider public itself.&lt;ref name="ecologist" /&gt;&lt;ref name="natures" /&gt; They argue that society enables denial of [[climate science]] through inaction and resistance to the scientific consensus.&lt;ref name="ecologist" /&gt;&lt;ref name="natures" /&gt; The authors conclude that if the public stopped denying climate change, the problem itself could realistically be significantly addressed.&lt;ref name="ecologist" /&gt;&lt;ref name="natures" /&gt;

==Reception==

The book's coauthor John Cook won the 2011 Eureka Prize for Advancement of Climate Change Knowledge, awarded by the [[New South Wales]] Government as part of the Australian Museum Eureka Prizes, and was honoured for his role in communicating the essence of climate change science to the general public.&lt;ref name="honour"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.uq.edu.au/news/article/2011/09/top-honour-uq%E2%80%99s-eureka-prize-winners|work=UQ News|publisher=[[University of Queensland]]|title=Top honour for UQ's Eureka Prize winners|accessdate=31 October 2015|date=7 September 2011|archivedate=22 October 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022225858/http://www.uq.edu.au/news/article/2011/09/top-honour-uq%E2%80%99s-eureka-prize-winners}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eurekafinalist"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.uq.edu.au/news/article/2011/08/eureka-moment-leading-climate-change-communicator|accessdate=31 October 2015|title=Eureka moment for leading climate change communicator|date=24 August 2011|work=UQ News|publisher=[[University of Queensland]]|archivedate=19 October 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019114542/http://www.uq.edu.au/news/article/2011/08/eureka-moment-leading-climate-change-communicator}}&lt;/ref&gt; Director of the University of Queensland Global Change Institute, Professor [[Ove Hoegh-Guldberg (biologist)|Ove Hoegh-Guldberg]], cited Cook's research and authorship of ''Climate Change Denial: Heads in the Sand'' as the rationale behind him winning the award.&lt;ref name="eurekafinalist" /&gt;

''The Ecologist'' reviewed the book and described it as: "well researched and painstakingly footnoted".&lt;ref name="ecologist"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[The Ecologist]]|accessdate=31 October 2015|url=http://www.theecologist.org/reviews/books/885054/climate_change_denial.html|title=Climate Change Denial|first=Jeremy|last=Williams|date=12 May 2011|issn=0012-9631|oclc=263593196|archivedate=15 September 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915060448/http://www.theecologist.org/reviews/books/885054/climate_change_denial.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review concluded: ''Climate Change Denial'' is a wise and timely book.&amp;nbsp;... It deserves an audience".&lt;ref name="ecologist" /&gt; Writing for ''ECOS'' magazine, Mary-Lou Considine wrote that the book "dissects objections to the peer-reviewed science" in "forensic detail".&lt;ref name="considine" /&gt; Considine recommended the book for those who had previously visited the website Skeptical Science and subsequently wanted to learn more about the wider topic discussed on the site.&lt;ref name="considine" /&gt;

In a review of the book by the academic journal ''Natures Sciences Sociétés'', the authors' thesis was praised for its ability to bring reason to their analysis: "This book shows how we can break through denial, accept reality, and thus solve the climate crisis".&lt;ref name="natures" /&gt; ''Natures Sciences Sociétés'' recommended the work for multiple stakeholders, concluding: "It will engage scientists, university students, climate change activists as well as the general public seeking to roll back denial and act".&lt;ref name="natures"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Natures Sciences Sociétés|title=Climate Change Denial: Heads in the Sand|date=October 2011|volume=19|issue=4|page=474|issn=1240-1307|accessdate=31 October 2015|via=[[EBSCO Host]]|subscription=yes|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/book-reviews/75040268/climate-change-denial-heads-sand|doi=10.1051/nss/2011153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dimitris Dimitrakos''' ({{lang-el|Δημήτρης Δημητράκος}}; born 1936) is a [[Greece|Greek]] [[philosopher]], currently Professor [[Emeritus]] of [[Political Philosophy]] in the [[Philosophy of Science]] Department of the [[University of Athens]]. 

==Biography==
Dimitrakos originally studied [[economics]] at the [[London School of Economics]]), taking part in seminars given there by [[Karl Popper]], before obtaining a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in Political Philosophy at the [[University of Paris]] with a [[thesis]] on [[Antonio Gramsci]]. Since then he has taught at the Universities of Paris, [[University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne|Reims]], [[University of Thessaly|Thessaly]] and Athens and as a visiting professor at the LSE.

Dimitrakos' work covers many areas of [[epistemology]], [[political philosophy]] and [[social theory]] which include [[Karl Popper#Philosophy of science|Karl Popper's philosophy of science]] and society, analytical aspects of [[Marxism]], the role of [[rationalism]] and [[liberalism]] in social and [[political theory]] as well as [[individual rights]] and [[Democracy|democratic theory]].

He has also written extensively on [[civil society]], [[nationalism]] and current political problems. His research interests focus on [[economic theory]], liberalism and the [[Philosophy of social science#Epistemology|epistemology of social sciences]].

In July 2002, he was a speaker at the [[Karl Popper]] centenary conference held in [[Vienna]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pub19.bravenet.com/forum/static/show.php?usernum=1573050381&amp;frmid=627&amp;msgid=19426 Dimitrakos' paper "The Weapon of Criticism".] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20141222111815/http://pub19.bravenet.com/forum/static/show.php?usernum=1573050381&amp;frmid=627&amp;msgid=19426 |date=2014-12-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is currently President of the "Open Society",&lt;ref&gt;[http://facebook.com/opensocietyclub Open Society association]&lt;/ref&gt; an association for the promotion of principles of [[democracy]], [[liberalism]], the [[Rechtsstaat|rule of law]], [[human rights]] and [[civil society]] in Greece.

'''Docker''' is a [[computer program]] that performs [[operating-system-level virtualization]], also known as "containerization".&lt;ref name="SYS-CON Media"/&gt; It was first released in 2013 and is developed by [[Docker, Inc.]]&lt;ref name="os4u"/&gt;

Docker is used to run software packages called "[[containers]]". Containers are isolated from each other and bundle their own application&lt;ref&gt;https://docs.docker.com/engine/faq/#what-does-docker-technology-add-to-just-plain-lxc&lt;/ref&gt;, tools, [[Library (computing)|libraries]] and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. All containers are run by a single [[Kernel (operating system)|operating system kernel]] and are thus more lightweight than [[virtual machine]]s. Containers are created from "images" that specify their precise contents. Images are often created by combining and modifying standard images downloaded from public repositories.

== History ==
[[Solomon Hykes]] started Docker in France as an internal project within [[dotCloud]], a [[PaaS|platform-as-a-service]] company,&lt;ref name="dotcloud"/&gt; with initial contributions by other dotCloud engineers including Andrea Luzzardi and Francois-Xavier Bourlet.&lt;ref name="cleverism"/&gt; [[Jeff Lindsay (computer programmer)|Jeff Lindsay]] also became involved as an independent collaborator.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Docker represents an evolution of dotCloud's proprietary technology, which is itself built on earlier open-source projects such as [[Cloudlets]].{{Clarify|reason=unclear what is meant by: represents an evolution|date=August 2016}}{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

The software debuted to the public in Santa Clara at [[PyCon]] in 2013.&lt;ref name="docker-announcement"/&gt;

Docker was released as open source in March 2013.&lt;ref name="infoq-2013-03" /&gt;  On March 13, 2014, with the release of version 0.9, Docker dropped LXC as the default execution environment and replaced it with its own {{Mono|libcontainer}} library written in the [[Go (programming language)|Go]] programming language.&lt;ref name="zdnet-7000030397"/&gt;&lt;ref name="infoq-2014-03" /&gt;

=== Adoption ===
* On September 19, 2013, [[Red Hat]] and Docker announced a collaboration around [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]], [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]], and [[OpenShift]].&lt;ref name="techcrunch-2013-09"/&gt;
* In November 2014 Docker container services were announced for the  [[Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud]] (EC2).&lt;ref name="amazon-ec2"/&gt;
* On November 10, 2014, Docker announced a partnership with [[Stratoscale]].&lt;ref name="stratoscale"/&gt;
* On December 4, 2014, [[IBM]] announced a strategic partnership with Docker that enables Docker to integrate more closely with the IBM Cloud.&lt;ref name="ibm-partnership"/&gt;
* On June 22, 2015, Docker and several other companies announced that they are working on a new vendor and operating-system-independent standard for software containers.&lt;ref name="common-container-standard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="open-container-project"/&gt;
* {{As of|2015|10|24|df=US}}, the project had over 25,600 [[GitHub]] stars (making it the 20th most-starred GitHub project), over 6,800 forks, and nearly 1,100 contributors.&lt;ref name="GitHub"/&gt;
* In April 2016, Windocks, an independent ISV released a port of Docker's open source project to Windows, supporting Windows Server 2012 R2 and Server 2016, with all editions of SQL Server 2008 onward. &lt;ref name="InfoWorld-Windocks"/&gt;
* A May 2016 analysis showed the following organizations as main contributors to Docker: The Docker team, [[Cisco Systems|Cisco]], [[Google]], [[Huawei]], [[IBM]], [[Microsoft]], and [[Red Hat]].&lt;ref name="gist-project-stats"/&gt;
* On October 4, 2016, Solomon Hykes announced [[InfraKit]] as a new self-healing container infrastructure effort for Docker container environments.&lt;ref name="infrakit-theregister"/&gt;&lt;ref name="infrakit-serverwatch"/&gt;
* A January 2017 analysis of [[LinkedIn]] profile mentions showed Docker presence grew by 160% in 2016.&lt;ref name="linkedin-pulse"/&gt; The software has been downloaded more than 13 billion times as of 2017.

== Technology ==

[[File:Docker-linux-interfaces.svg|thumb|Docker can use different interfaces to access virtualization features of the Linux kernel.&lt;ref name="docker-blog-2014-03" /&gt;]]

Docker is developed primarily for [[Linux]], where it uses the resource isolation features of the [[Linux kernel]] such as [[cgroups]] and kernel [[Linux namespaces|namespaces]], and a [[Union mount|union-capable file system]] such as [[OverlayFS]] and others&lt;ref name="select-storage-driver"/&gt; to allow independent "containers" to run within a single Linux instance, avoiding the overhead of starting and maintaining [[virtual machine]]s (VMs).&lt;ref name="kernel-requirements"/&gt; The Linux kernel's support for namespaces mostly&lt;ref name="kernel-keyrings"/&gt; isolates an application's view of the operating environment, including process trees, network, user IDs and mounted file systems, while the kernel's cgroups provide resource limiting for memory and CPU.&lt;ref name="limit-resources"/&gt;  Since version 0.9, Docker includes the '''{{Mono|libcontainer}}''' [[Library (computing)|library]] as its own way to directly use virtualization facilities provided by the Linux kernel, in addition to using abstracted virtualization interfaces via [[libvirt]], [[LXC]] and [[systemd-nspawn]].&lt;ref name="zdnet-7000030397" /&gt;&lt;ref name="libcontainer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="docker-blog-2014-03"/&gt;

Building on top of facilities provided by the [[Linux kernel]] (primarily cgroups and namespaces), a Docker container, unlike a virtual machine, does not require or include a separate operating system.&lt;ref name="Linux" /&gt;  Instead, it relies on the kernel's functionality and uses resource isolation for CPU and memory,&lt;ref name="limit-resources" /&gt; and [[namespace isolation|separate namespaces]] to isolate the application's view of the operating system.  Docker accesses the Linux kernel's virtualization features either directly using the {{Mono|libcontainer}} library, which is available as of Docker&amp;nbsp;0.9, or indirectly via {{Mono|[[libvirt]]}}, {{Mono|[[LXC]]}} (Linux Containers) or {{Mono|[[systemd-nspawn]]}}.&lt;ref name="docker-blog-2014-03" /&gt;&lt;ref name="infoq-2014-03"/&gt;

=== Components ===
The Docker software is a service consisting of three components:
* '''Software:''' The Docker [[Daemon (computing)|daemon]], called &lt;code&gt;dockerd&lt;/code&gt;, is a persistent process that manages Docker containers and handles container objects. The daemon listens for requests sent via the Docker Engine API.&lt;ref name="docker-overview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dockerd"/&gt; The Docker client program, called &lt;code&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt;, provides a [[command-line interface]] that allows users to interact with Docker daemons.&lt;ref name="cli-usage"/&gt;&lt;ref name="docker-overview" /&gt;
* '''Objects:''' Docker objects are various entities used to assemble an application in Docker. The main classes of Docker objects are images, containers, and services.&lt;ref name="docker-overview" /&gt;
** A Docker container is a standardized, encapsulated environment that runs applications.&lt;ref name="digitalocean"/&gt; A container is managed using the Docker API or CLI.&lt;ref name="docker-overview" /&gt;
** A Docker image is a read-only template used to build containers. Images are used to store and ship applications.&lt;ref name="docker-overview" /&gt;
** A Docker service allows containers to be scaled across multiple Docker daemons. The result is known as a "swarm", a set of cooperating daemons that communicate through the Docker API.&lt;ref name="docker-overview" /&gt;
* '''Registries:''' A Docker registry is a repository for Docker images. Docker clients connect to registries to download ("pull") images for use or upload ("push") images that they have built. Registries can be public or private. Two main public registries are Docker Hub and Docker Cloud. Docker Hub is the default registry where Docker looks for images.&lt;ref name="docker-registry"/&gt;&lt;ref name="docker-overview" /&gt;

=== Tools ===
* '''Docker Compose''' is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.&lt;ref name="compose-overview"/&gt; It uses [[YAML]] files to configure the application's services and performs the creation and start-up process of all the containers with a single command. The &lt;code&gt;docker-compose&lt;/code&gt; CLI utility allows users to run commands on multiple containers at once, for example, building images, [[Scalability|scaling]] containers, running containers that were stopped, and more.&lt;ref name="compose-cli-ref"/&gt; Commands related to image manipulation, or user-interactive options, are not relevant in Docker Compose because they address one container.&lt;ref name="codeship"/&gt; The '''docker-compose.yml''' file is used to define an application's services and includes various configuration options. For example, the &lt;code&gt;build&lt;/code&gt; option defines configuration options such as the Dockerfile path, the &lt;code&gt;command&lt;/code&gt; option allows one to override default Docker commands, and more.&lt;ref name="compose-v3-ref"/&gt; The first public version of Docker Compose (version 0.0.1) was released on December 21, 2013.&lt;ref name="release-0.0.1"/&gt; The first production-ready version (1.0) was made available on October 16, 2014.&lt;ref name="release-1.0.0"/&gt;
* '''Docker Swarm''' provides native [[Computer cluster|clustering]] functionality for Docker containers, which turns a group of Docker engines into a single virtual Docker engine.&lt;ref name="container-orchestration-tools"/&gt; In Docker 1.12 and higher, Swarm mode is integrated with Docker Engine.&lt;ref name="docker-swarm"/&gt; The &lt;code&gt;swarm&lt;/code&gt; CLI utility allows users to run Swarm containers, create discovery tokens, list nodes in the cluster, and more.&lt;ref name="swarm-cli-ref"/&gt; The &lt;code&gt;docker node&lt;/code&gt; CLI utility allows users to run various commands to manage nodes in a swarm, for example, listing the nodes in a swarm, updating nodes, and removing nodes from the swarm.&lt;ref name="docker-node"/&gt; Docker manages swarms using the [[Raft (computer science)|Raft Consensus Algorithm]]. According to Raft, for an update to be performed, the majority of Swarm nodes need to agree on the update.&lt;ref name="aquasec"/&gt;&lt;ref name="raft"/&gt;

== Operation ==

Docker implements a high-level [[Application programming interface|API]] to provide lightweight containers that run processes in isolation.&lt;ref name="infoq-2013-03"/&gt;

According to a [[Linux.com]] article,

{{quote
|text=Docker is a tool that can package an application and its dependencies in a virtual container that can run on any Linux server. This helps enable flexibility and portability on where the application can run, whether [[On-premises software|on premises]], [[public cloud]], [[private cloud]], [[bare-metal server|bare metal]], etc.&lt;ref name="Linux"/&gt;
}}

Because Docker containers are lightweight, a single server or virtual machine can run several containers simultaneously. A 2016 analysis found that a typical Docker use case involves running five containers per host, but that many organizations run 10 or more.&lt;ref name="datadog"/&gt;

Using containers may simplify the creation of highly [[distributed system]]s by allowing multiple applications, worker tasks and other processes to run autonomously on a single physical machine or across multiple virtual machines. This allows the deployment of nodes to be performed as the resources become available or when more nodes are needed, allowing a [[platform as a service]] (PaaS)-style of deployment and scaling for systems such as [[Apache Cassandra]], [[MongoDB]] and [[Riak]].&lt;ref name="CloudAve"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Iron.io"/&gt;

=== Integration ===
Docker can be integrated into various infrastructure tools, including [[Amazon Web Services]],&lt;ref name="docs-amazon-ec2"/&gt; [[Ansible (software)|Ansible]],&lt;ref name="ansible"/&gt; [[CFEngine]],&lt;ref name="cfengine"/&gt; [[Chef (software)|Chef]],&lt;ref name="docker-cookbook"/&gt; [[Google Cloud Platform]],&lt;ref name="containers-google-clould-platform"/&gt;  IBM [[Bluemix]],&lt;ref name="bluemix-ibm-containers"/&gt; HPE Helion Stackato, [[Jelastic]],&lt;ref name="jelastic-integration"/&gt; [[Jenkins (software)|Jenkins]],&lt;ref name="jenkins-plugin"/&gt; [[Kubernetes]],&lt;ref name="containerizing-docker-on-Kubernetes"/&gt; [[Microsoft Azure]],&lt;ref name="docker-vm-extension-azure"/&gt; [[OpenStack]] Nova,&lt;ref name="openstack-newsletter"/&gt; [[OpenSVC]],&lt;ref name="opensvc"/&gt; [[Oracle Cloud#Platform as a Service (PaaS)|Oracle Container Cloud Service]],&lt;ref name="oracle-container-cloud"/&gt; [[Puppet (software)|Puppet]],&lt;ref name="garethr-docker"/&gt; [[ProGet]],&lt;ref name="private-registries"/&gt; [[Salt (software)|Salt]],&lt;ref name="saltstack-dockerio"/&gt; [[Vagrant (software)|Vagrant]],&lt;ref name="vagrant-docker"/&gt; and [[VMware vSphere|VMware vSphere Integrated Containers]].&lt;ref name="vmware-vic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vmware-photon"/&gt;

The Cloud Foundry Diego project integrates Docker into the [[Cloud Foundry]] [[Platform as a service|PaaS]].&lt;ref name="cloud-foundry-diego"/&gt;

Nanobox uses Docker (natively and with [[VirtualBox]]) containers as a core part of its software development platform.&lt;ref name="nanobox"/&gt;

Red Hat's [[OpenShift]] PaaS integrates Docker with related projects (Kubernetes, Geard, Project Atomic and others) since v3 (June 2015).&lt;ref name="red-hat-geard"/&gt;

The [[Apprenda]] PaaS integrates Docker containers in version 6.0 of its product.&lt;ref name="apprenda"/&gt;

[[Jelastic]] PaaS provides managed multi-tenant Docker containers with full compatibility to the native ecosystem.&lt;ref name="jelastic-fifth-element"/&gt;

The Tsuru PaaS integrates Docker containers in its product in 2013, the first PaaS to use Docker in a production environment.&lt;ref name="docker-tsuru"/&gt;

=== For Windows ===
On October 15, 2014, [[Microsoft]] announced integration of the Docker engine into the next [[Windows Server]] release, and native support for the Docker client role in Windows.&lt;ref name="docker-windows-server"/&gt;&lt;ref name="docker-microsoft"/&gt; On June 8, 2016, Microsoft announced that Docker now could be used natively on Windows 10 with Hyper-V Containers, to build, ship and run containers utilizing the Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview 5 Nano Server container OS image.&lt;ref name="win10-insider-preview"/&gt;

Since then, a feature known as Windows Containers was made available for [[Windows 10]] and [[Windows Server 2016]]. There are two types of Windows Containers: "Windows Server Containers" and "Hyper-V Isolation". The former has nothing to do with Docker. The latter, however, is a form of [[hardware virtualization]] (as opposed to OS-level virtualization) and uses Docker to deliver the guest OS image.&lt;ref name="windows-containers"/&gt; The guest OS image is a Windows Nano Server image, which is 652 MB in size and has the same limitations of Nano Server,&lt;ref name="containers-win10"/&gt; as well as a separate [[end-user license agreement]].&lt;ref name="ms-images-eula"/&gt;

'''''Ecology, community and lifestyle: outline of an ecosophy''''' is a 1989 book about [[environmental philosophy]] by the Norwegian philosopher [[Arne Næss]], writing with the philosopher [[David Rothenberg]].

==Summary==
Naess advocates that the people should limit their numbers and "live in an enduring, dynamic equilibrium with other forms of life."{{sfn|Naess|1989|page=23}}

==Publication history==
''Ecology, community and lifestyle'' was first published in 1989 by [[Cambridge University Press]]. According to Rothenberg, the work was "not a direct translation of Arne Naess' 1976 work ''Økologi, samfunn, og livsstil'', but rather a new work in English, based on the Norwegian, with many sections revised and rewritten by Professor Naess and myself, in an attempt to clarify the original work as well as bring it up to date."{{sfn|Rothenberg|1989|page=xii}}

==Reception==
''Ecology, community and lifestyle'' was reviewed by Robert P. McIntosh in ''[[The Quarterly Review of Biology]]'',{{sfn|McIntosh|1989|page=532}} Jim Cheney in ''[[Environmental Ethics (journal)|Environmental Ethics]]'',{{sfn|Cheney|1991|pages=263–273}} and the political scientist [[Charles T. Rubin]] in ''Interpretation: A Journal of Political Philosophy''.{{sfn|Rubin|1993|pages=73–80}} The book was also reviewed in the ''[[Journal of Applied Ecology]]''.{{sfn|''Journal of Applied Ecology''|1990|pages=363–364}}

{{Political campaigning}}

An '''election promise''' or '''campaign promise''' is a [[promise]] or guarantee made to the public by a [[candidate]] or [[political party]] that is trying to win an [[election]].

Across the Western world, political parties are highly likely to fulfill their election promises.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thomson|first=Robert|last2=Royed|first2=Terry|last3=Naurin|first3=Elin|last4=Artés|first4=Joaquín|last5=Costello|first5=Rory|last6=Ennser-Jedenastik|first6=Laurenz|last7=Ferguson|first7=Mark|last8=Kostadinova|first8=Petia|last9=Moury|first9=Catherine|date=2017-07-01|title=The Fulfillment of Parties’ Election Pledges: A Comparative Study on the Impact of Power Sharing|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajps.12313/abstract|journal=American Journal of Political Science|language=en|volume=61|issue=3|pages=527–542|doi=10.1111/ajps.12313|issn=1540-5907}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, platform positions offer important clues as to the policies that U.S. parties will enact. Over the past 30 years, Democratic and Republican [[Member of Congress|congresspeople]] voted in line with their respective party platforms 74% and 89% of the time, respectively.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/7/12/12060358/political-science-of-platforms|title=We asked 8 political scientists if party platforms matter. Here’s what we learned.|last=Stein|first=Jeff|date=2016-07-12|website=Vox|access-date=2016-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fulfilling promises ==

A 2017 study in the ''American Journal of Political Science'' found that for 12 countries (Austria, Bulgaria, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States) found that political parties fulfill their promises to voters to a considerable extent:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thomson|first=Robert|last2=Royed|first2=Terry|last3=Naurin|first3=Elin|last4=Artés|first4=Joaquín|last5=Costello|first5=Rory|last6=Ennser-Jedenastik|first6=Laurenz|last7=Ferguson|first7=Mark|last8=Kostadinova|first8=Petia|last9=Moury|first9=Catherine|date=2017-07-01|title=The Fulfillment of Parties’ Election Pledges: A Comparative Study on the Impact of Power Sharing|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajps.12313/abstract|journal=American Journal of Political Science|language=en|volume=61|issue=3|pages=527–542|doi=10.1111/ajps.12313|issn=1540-5907}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Parties that hold executive office after elections generally fulfill substantial percentages, sometimes very high percentages, of their election pledges, whereas parties that do not hold executive office generally find that lower percentages of their pledges are fulfilled. The fulfillment of pledges by governing executive parties varies across governments in ways that reflect power-sharing arrangements. The main power-sharing arrangement that impacts pledge fulfillment distinguishes between single-party governments and coalitions, not between governments with and without legislative majorities. We found the highest percentages of pledge fulfillment for governing parties in the United Kingdom, Sweden, Portugal, Spain, and Canada, most of which governed in single-party executives. We found lower percentages for governing parties in Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, Bulgaria, Ireland, and Italy, most of which governed in coalitions. Pledge fulfillment by U.S. presidential parties lies at the higher end of coalition governments, which suggests that U.S. presidents are more constrained than governing parties in single-party parliamentary systems, but less constrained than most governing parties in multiparty coalitions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Other research on the United States suggests that Democratic and Republican [[Member of Congress|congresspeople]] voted in line with their respective party platforms 74% and 89% of the time, respectively.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

=== Examples of broken promises ===
{{refimprove section|date=July 2015}}
*The [[Liberal Party (UK)|British Liberal Party]]'s pledge to cut military spending, before embarking on the [[HMS Dreadnought (1906)|Dreadnought]] [[arms race]] with [[Germany]].
*The [[British Labour Party]]'s 1945 pledge to set up a new ministry of housing.
*[[Australia]]n Prime Minister [[Bob Hawke]], in 1987, said that "by 1990 no Australian child will be living in poverty"
*[[George H. W. Bush]] promised not to raise taxes while president during his [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988 campaign]]. This was best remembered in a speech at the Republican National Convention when he said "Congress will push and push...and I'll say [[Read my lips: no new taxes]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sOkxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=PuUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1182%2C1989963 How Headline Writers Read Bush's Lips], Reading Eagle, July 5, 1990, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt; After a recession began during his term and the deficit widened, Bush agreed to proposals to increase taxes. Although not the only broken promise concerning taxes, it was by far the most famous.
*In 1994, upon entering [[Politics of Italy|Italian politics]], media tycoon [[Silvio Berlusconi]] promised that he would sell his assets in [[Fininvest]] (later [[Mediaset]]), because of the [[conflict of interest]] it would have generated, a promise he repeated a number of times in later years, but after 12 years and having served three terms as [[Prime Minister of Italy|prime minister]], he still retains ownership of his company that controls virtually all the Italian private TV stations and a large number of magazines and publishing houses, which have extensively been used in favour of his political party

*When asked about the issue of carbon taxation, [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Julia Gillard]] responded by saying "There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead, but let's be absolutely clear. I am determined to price carbon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sustainabilityaustralia.wordpress.com/2013/03/10/the-tax-thats-not-a-tax/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130630162910/http://sustainabilityaustralia.wordpress.com/2013/03/10/the-tax-thats-not-a-tax/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 30, 2013 |title=The tax that’s not a tax |date=March 10, 2013 |publisher=Sustainability Australia }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2011, Gillard then announced a carbon pricing mechanism in order to secure a minority government. This has been construed by some as being a broken promise, with debate centering on whether or not a fixed price leading into a trading scheme can be called a 'tax'.
*Before the [[Irish general election, 2011|2011 Irish general election]], the then Labour Party leader [[Eamon Gilmore]] infamously said "[[Frankfurt's Way or Labour's Way]]" in reference to the EU/IMF deal.

&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson described his 'Spiritual Awakening' as a spontaneous experience he had in 1979.&lt;ref name="miraclesnetwork"&gt;
{{cite web

|title=Master Teacher Media.
|author=Miracles Network
|accessdate=2009-03-10 
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; A certain pair of earlier extraordinary experiences Anderson had, may offer some insight into Anderson's later experience of 'Spiritual Awakening'.

The ''first'' of these two earlier extraordinary experiences was Anderson's World War II experience in Nagasaki, Japan.  Anderson's Nagasaki experience appears to have made a deeply profound and formative impression upon him.  In a letter to the ''Atomic Veteran's History Project,''&lt;ref name="AVHP"&gt;{{cite web
| title = Nagasaki-Story
| publisher = A Course In Miracles International
| date = 
| url = http://www.themiracletimes.com/Master_Teacher/Nagasaki-Story.htm
| accessdate = 2009-03-10}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson described how, with the Marines 6th Regiment, he was one of the first to land at Nagasaki after the atomic bombing of that city in 1945, where he was faced with a vast and overwhelming feeling of the devastation he was witnessing:

{{quote|On "one particular day", at "one particular moment in time", I found myself standing directly in the center of this unspeakable, indeed unthinkable, devastation that had to have been caused by someone or something. At "that one time" I was filled with complete rage, a wrenching, seething, frustrating, insatiable need for revenge. But against what or whom? It had no point of location, no focus of causation - in effect, no one to blame, no one to hold responsible. It became a passion of intense revulsion for myself, for this world and for any and all members of the human species - a contained certainty from deep within me that all of us, everyone on this earth, all were totally guilty together. And then at "that one moment in time", the light of an inner peace enveloped me. It became "a space in time" where a new resolution appeared, and with it, the message, "Look at this as a new beginning."{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}}}

Anderson wrote that his second such experience came 26 years later in 1971, during a 'Near Death Experience' he had.  Anderson wrote that during this second such experience, he had a certain "space of peace and happiness" while lying on what he presumed would be his deathbed, and that also during this second event, he received a spontaneous healing from cirrhosis of the liver.&lt;ref name="cirrhosis"&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate = 2009-03-10}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[CBS News]]'', Anderson denied having followers, teaching that "the Light is in everyone" and that "You are the light of the world." He claimed to be "returning to heaven" "shortly", and said that "everybody" will be going with him. "There's nothing dangerous about me," Anderson explained, "I am the danger of eternal love."&lt;ref name="Leaving Endeavor Academy"&gt;

Since Anderson's passing in 2008, the Academy and its affiliates have so far continued to remain active, and have continued to produce and disseminate instructional materials.

Following Anderson's passing, the nature of, and names of, the ongoing leadership of the Academy is unknown.

==History==

Anderson received a copy of ''A Course in Miracles'' ca. 1982. In 1991 he first registered the organization in Reedsburg, Wisconsin, USA under its original name, which was "God’s Country Place" (GCP).  This organization was based on many of the teachings of ''ACIM'', as well as some Biblical and AA (Alcoholics Anonymous) materials.&lt;ref name="AA"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; By 1999, Endeavor Academy had grown to accommodate 500 residents.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

In 1992 the organization was registered to operate under the names Endeavor Academy and New Christian Church of Full Endeavor.  Around this time, the use of the GCP name was discontinued.

Endeavor Academy's headquarters was a converted summer resort facility located in a diverse area of water parks and tourist attractions in the middle&lt;ref name="EAmaps"&gt;

== Litigation related to the ''A Course in Miracles'' text ==

Endeavor Academy's primary text, ''[[A Course in Miracles]]'', was published and distributed between 1995 and 2000 by Penguin Books. As a result of litigation with Endeavor Academy the Foundation for Inner Peace (FIP) copyright claims were largely voided in 2003 on the grounds of general distribution prior to obtaining copyright, thus placing the majority of the material previously claimed by FIP as under copyright protection in the public domain.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Erik Maria Ritter von Kuehnelt-Leddihn''' (born July 31, 1909 in [[Haselsdorf-Tobelbad|Tobelbad]], [[Styria]], [[Austria-Hungary]]; died May 26, 1999, in [[Lans, Tyrol|Lans]], [[Tyrol]]) was an [[Austrians|Austrian]] [[political science|political scientist]] and [[journalism|journalist]]. Describing himself as an "extreme conservative arch-liberal" or "liberal of the extreme right", Kuehnelt-Leddihn often argued that [[majority rule]] in [[democracy|democracies]] is a threat to individual liberties, and declared himself a [[monarchism|monarchist]] and an enemy of all forms of [[totalitarianism]], although he also supported what he defined as "non-democratic republics," such as [[Switzerland]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, William F. [http://www.firstprinciplesjournal.com/articles.aspx?article=742&amp;theme=cotho&amp;loc=b “Erik Ritter von Kuehnelt-Leddihn: A Remembrance,”] ''First Principles'', September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;{{not in source|date=April 2018}} 

Described as "A Walking Book of Knowledge", Kuehnelt-Leddihn had an encyclopedic knowledge of the humanities and was a polyglot, able to speak eight languages and read seventeen others.&lt;ref name="WFB1"&gt;{{cite news|author=[[William F. Buckley, Jr.]]|title=A Walking Book of Knowledge|magazine=[[National Review]]|page=104|date=1985-12-31|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
His early books ''The Menace of the Herd'' and ''Liberty or Equality'' were influential within the [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservative movement]]. An associate of [[William F. Buckley Jr.]], his best-known writings appeared in ''[[National Review]]'', where he was a columnist for 35 years.

==Life==
At 16, he became the [[Vienna]] correspondent of ''[[The Spectator]]''. From then on, he wrote for the rest of his life. He studied [[civil law (area)|civil]] and [[canon law]] at the [[University of Vienna]] at 18. Then, he went to the [[Eötvös Loránd University|University of Budapest]], from which he received an M.A. in [[economics]] and his doctorate in [[political science]]. Moving back to Vienna, he took up studies in [[theology]]. In 1935, Kuehnelt-Leddihn travelled to England to become a [[schoolmaster]] at [[Beaumont College]], a [[Jesuit]] [[public school (England)|public school]]. Subsequently, he moved to the United States, where he taught at [[Georgetown University]] (1937–1938), [[Saint Peter's College, New Jersey]] (head of the History and Sociology Department, 1938–1943), [[Fordham University]] (Japanese, 1942–1943), and [[Chestnut Hill College]], Philadelphia (1943–1947).

In a 1939 letter to the editor of ''[[The New York Times]]'', Kuehnelt-Leddihn critiqued the design of every American coin then in circulation except for the [[Washington quarter]], which he allowed was "so far the most satisfactory coin" and judged the [[Mercury dime]] to be "the most deplorable."&lt;ref&gt;Erik v. Kuehnelt-Leddihn, Letter to the Editor, "Our Coins Criticized: Visitor Finds Artistic Faults in All Except the Quarter", ''The New York Times'', Nov. 26, 1939, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

After publishing books like ''Jesuiten, Spießer und Bolschewiken'' in 1933 (published in German by Pustet, Salzburg) and ''The Menace of the Herd'' in 1943, in which he criticised the National Socialists as well as the Socialists directly OE indirectly, as he could not return to the Austria that had been incorporated into the Third Reich.

After the [[Second World War]], he resettled in [[Lans, Tyrol|Lans]], where he lived until his death.&lt;ref&gt;Rutler, George W. [http://www.crisismagazine.com/2007/erik-von-kuehnelt-leddihn “Erik Von Kuehnelt-Leddihn,”] ''Crisis Magazine'', November 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was an avid traveler:  he had visited the [[Soviet Union]] in 1930–1931, and he eventually visited each of the United States.

Kuehnelt-Leddihn wrote for a variety of publications, including ''[[Chronicles (magazine)|Chronicles]]'', ''[[Thought: Fordham University Quarterly|Thought]]'', the ''Rothbard-Rockwell Report'', ''[[Catholic World]]'', and the Norwegian business magazine ''Farmand''. He also worked with the [[Acton Institute]], which declared him after his death "a great friend and supporter."&lt;ref name="Acton"&gt;{{cite web|title=Erik Ritter von Kuehnelt-Leddihn (1909–1999)|publisher=[[Acton Institute]]|url=http://www.acton.org/publications/randl/rl_liberal_en_324.php|accessdate=2009-04-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090626205419/http://www.acton.org/publications/randl/rl_liberal_en_324.php|archivedate=2009-06-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an adjunct scholar of the [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Lew Rockwell|Rockwell, Lew]]. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20140314012735/http://archive.lewrockwell.com/blog/lewrw/archives/022221.html Remembering Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn]". [[LewRockwell.com|''LewRockwell.com Blog'']], July 31, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; For much of his life, Kuehnelt was also a painter; he illustrated some of his own books.

According to his friend [[William F. Buckley]], Dr. Kuehnelt-Leddihn was "the world's most fascinating man."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acton.org/sites/v4.acton.org/files/pdf/rl_v09n5.pdf "Erik Ritter von Kuehnelt-Leddih (1909–1999),"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130702133545/http://www.acton.org/sites/v4.acton.org/files/pdf/rl_v09n5.pdf |date=2013-07-02 }} ''Religion &amp; Liberty'' '''9''' (5), 1999, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
{{Conservatism sidebar |People}}
His socio-political writings dealt with the origins and the philosophical and cultural currents that formed [[Nazism]]. He endeavored to explain the intricacies of [[monarchism|monarchist]] concepts and the systems of Europe, cultural movements such as [[Jan Hus|Hussitism]] and [[Protestantism]], and the disastrous effects of an American policy derived from antimonarchical feelings and ignorance of European culture and history.

Kuehnelt-Leddihn directed some of his most significant critiques towards [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilsonian]] foreign policy activism. Traces of Wilsonianism could be detected in the foreign policies of [[Franklin Roosevelt]]; specifically, the assumption that [[democracy]] is the ideal political system in any context. Kuehnelt-Leddihn believed that Americans misunderstood much of Central European culture such as the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]],&lt;ref&gt;Baltzersen, Jorn K. [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/baltzersen/baltzersen34.1.html “The Last Knight of the Habsburg Empire,”] ''Lew Rockwell'', July 31, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; which Kuehnelt-Leddihn claimed as one of the contributing factors to the rise of [[Nazism]]. He also highlighted characteristics of the German society and culture (especially the influences of both Protestant and [[Catholicism|Catholic]] mentalities) and attempted to explain the sociological undercurrents of Nazism. Thus, he concludes that sound Catholicism, sound Protestantism, or even, probably, sound [[popular sovereignty]] (German-Austrian unification in 1919) all three would have prevented National Socialism although Kuehnelt-Leddihn rather dislikes the latter two.

Contrary to the prevailing view that the Nazi Party was a radical right-wing movement with only superficial and minimal leftist elements, Kuehnelt-Leddihn asserted that Nazism (National Socialism) was a strongly [[leftist]], democratic movement ultimately rooted in the [[French Revolution]] that unleashed forces of [[egalitarianism]], [[conformity]], [[materialism]] and [[centralization]].&lt;ref&gt;Congdon, Lee. [http://www.crisismagazine.com/2012/kuehnelt-leddihn-and-american-conservatism “Kuehnelt-Leddihn and American Conservatism,”] ''Crisis Magazine'', March 26, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that [[Nazism]], [[fascism]], [[Radicalism (historical)|radical-liberalism]], and [[communism]] were essentially democratic movements, based upon inciting the masses to revolution and intent upon destroying the old forms of society. Furthermore, Kuehnelt-Leddihn claimed that all democracy is basically [[totalitarian]] and that all democracies eventually degenerate into [[dictatorship]]s. He said that it was not the case for "republics" (the word, for Kuehnelt-Leddihn, has the meaning of what Aristotle calls πολιτεία), such as [[Switzerland]], or the [[United States]] as it was originally intended in its constitution. However, he considered the United States to have been to a certain extent subject to a silent democratic revolution in the late 1820s.

In ''Liberty or Equality'', his [[masterpiece|magnum opus]], Kuehnelt-Leddihn contrasted monarchy with democracy and presented his arguments for the superiority of monarchy: diversity is upheld better in monarchical countries than in democracies. Monarchism is not based on party rule and "fits organically into the ecclesiastic and familistic pattern of Christian society." After insisting that the demand for liberty is about ''how'' to govern and by no means ''by whom'' to govern a given country, he draws arguments for his view that monarchical government is genuinely more liberal in this sense, but democracy naturally advocates for equality, even by enforcement, and thus becomes anti-liberal.&lt;ref&gt;Lukacs, John. [http://www.mmisi.org/ir/35_01/lukacs.pdf “Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn: A Memoir,”] ''The Intercollegiate Review'' '''35''' (1), Fall 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; As modern life becomes increasingly complicated across many different sociopolitical levels, Kuehnelt-Leddihn submits that the '''Scita''' (the political, economic, technological, scientific, military, geographical, psychological knowledge of the masses and of their representatives) and the '''Scienda''' (the knowledge in these matters that is necessary to reach logical-rational-moral conclusions) are separated by an incessantly and cruelly widening gap and that democratic governments are totally inadequate for such undertakings.

In February 1969, Kuehnelt-Leddihn wrote an article arguing against seeking a peace deal to end the
[[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name="nr"&gt;Erik Von Kuehnelt-Leddihn  
"No Quick Peace In Vietnam", ''National Review'', February 11, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead, he argued that the two options proposed, a reunification scheme and
the creation of a coalition Vietnamese government, were unacceptable 
concessions to the Marxist [[North Vietnam]].&lt;ref name="nr" /&gt; Kuehnelt-Leddihn urged the US to continue the war.&lt;ref name="nr" /&gt; until the Marxists were defeated.

Kuehnelt-Leddihn also denounced the US Bishops' 1982 pastoral 
''[[The Challenge of Peace: God's Promise and Our Response|The Challenge of Peace]]''. 
&lt;ref name="cop"&gt;Camilla J. Kari, ''Public Witness: The Pastoral Letters of the American Catholic Bishops'':
Liturgical Press, 2004. {{ISBN|0814658334}}  (p. 86).&lt;/ref&gt;
"The Bishops' letter breathes idealism... moral imperialism, the attempt to inject
theology into politics, ought to be avoided except in extreme cases, of which abolition and slavery are examples."&lt;ref name="cop" /&gt;

'''Furong Daokai''' (1043-1118) ({{zh|s=芙蓉道楷}}; {{CJKV|j=Fuyō Dōkai|k=Puyong Togae|v=Phù Dung Đạo Khải}}), was a [[Zen]] [[Buddhist]] monk during the [[Song Dynasty]].  He was born is a city known at the time as Yizhou, which is the present-day city of [[Linyi]] in the southern part of [[Shandong Province]].&lt;ref name=Fer&gt;{{citation|last=Ferguson|first=Andrew E.|title=Zen's Chinese heritage: the masters and their teachings|year=2000|publisher=Wisdom Publications|isbn=978-0-86171-163-5|pages=384–388}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with his fellow student [[Dahong Baoen]], Daokai is considered to have returned the [[Caodong]]/[[Sōtō]] Zen lineage to prominence after its near extinction a generation earlier. He was so prominent, in fact, that an extensive biography appeared in the ''Xudeng lu'', a compendium of biographies of prominent monks, in 1101, before he had even reached the height of his career, which was quite unusual for such biographies. The earliest full account of his life appears in Juefan Huihong's biographical compilation of 1119, the ''Chanlin sengbao zhuan'' (Chronicle of the Sangha Treasure in the Groves of Chan). This source speaks very highly of Daokai, despite the fact that its author was a member of the competing [[Rinzai]] school. According to his funerary inscription of 1127, he ordained 93 students during his life, and many of these went on to become prominent teachers themselves.&lt;ref name=sch&gt;{{citation|last=Schlütter|first=Morten|title=How Zen Became Zen: The Dispute Over Enlightenment and the Formation of Chan Buddhism in Song-Dynasty China|year=2010|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-3508-8|pages=81–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
According to the ''Chanlin sengbao zhuan'' (Chronicle of the Sangha Treasure in the Groves of Chan) of 1119, Daokai's first spiritual practices were centered on [[Daoism]], specifically those aimed at achieving [[immortality]]. To this end, he did not eat grain and went to live in the mountains as a hermit. Eventually, he gave this up and began practicing Zen at Shutai Temple outside the old capital city of [[Kaifeng]], in modern [[Henan Province]]. He later became a student of [[Touzi Yiqing]] and received [[dharma transmission]] from him. He left Touzi in 1082 and took a position at a public monastery, but was later assigned to the well-known [[White Horse Temple]] and [[Longmen Grottoes|Longmen Temple]]. After this he served at [[Dayang Jingxuan]]'s former monastery on Mount Dayang in Yingzhou. He again moved, this time to Dahong in [[Suizhou]] around 1103. In 1104, the [[Emperor Huizong of Song|Emperor Huizong]] ordered Daokai to become the abbot of Shifang Jingyin Temple in the capital, Kaifeng. In 1107 he moved to a different temple, Tianning Wanshou, in the same city. This temple was known as a Chongning temple, which were set up by the Emperor so that its residents would pray for his long life. While Daokai did not have a choice in the matter, he later refused to accept a purple robe given to him by the emperor in protest of this system, and he was exiled as a result to Zizhou near modern [[Jinan]] in his home province. Huihong's biography claims that crowds of people mourned as he left the city. The following year, however, the emperor ceased his punishment after Daokai sent a poem explaining his thoughts on the matter to an individual named Wang Songnian, who was in contact with the emperor. At this point, Daokai apparently wished to go to [[Zhejiang]] to spread his teaching, but decided to stay in his hometown after finding his father in old age. A wealthy government official named Liu Fengshi patronized the construction of a small monastery for Daokai at Lake Furong near his home village. In 1117, this monastery was give a plaque by the emperor giving it the name Huayan Chan Monastery, indicating the emperor's complete change of heart regarding him by that time. In 1118 Daokai died on the fourteenth day of the fifth month.&lt;ref name=sch/&gt;

'''Gary Edward Varner''' (born March 10, 1957) is an American philosopher specialising in [[environmental ethics]], philosophical questions related to [[animal rights]] and [[animal welfare]], and [[R. M. Hare]]'s [[two-level utilitarianism]]. He is currently a [[full professor|professor]] in the Department of Philosophy at [[Texas A&amp;M University]], and has been based at the university since 1990. He was educated at [[Arizona State University]], the [[University of Georgia]] and the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]; at Madison, where he was supervised by Jon Morline, he wrote one of the first [[doctoral thesis|doctoral theses]] on environmental ethics. Varner's first [[monograph]] was ''In Nature's Interests?'', which was published by [[Oxford University Press]] in 1998. In the book, Varner defended a form of [[biocentrism (ethics)|biocentric]] individualism, according to which all living entities have morally considerable interests.

From 2001, Varner embarked on a research project exploring animals in Hare's two-level utilitarianism. ''Personhood, Ethics, and Animal Cognition'', published by Oxford University Press in 2012, was the first monograph arising from this project. In the book, Varner moved away from his biocentrism, instead endorsing a developed version of Hare's ethics. Varner draws a distinction between persons, near-persons and merely sentient beings; although all are morally considerable, the lives of persons are of the most significance, and the lives of merely sentient beings are of the least. The practical consequences of this view, though initial comments were offered in ''Personhood, Ethics, and Animal Cognition'', will be explored in ''Sustaining Animals'', forthcoming with Oxford University Press.

==Career==
[[File:TAMU YMCA.JPG|thumb|left|The [[YMCA]] Building, [[Texas A&amp;M University]], houses the University's Department of Philosophy, where Varner has taught since 1990.]]
Varner completed a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[philosophy]] at [[Arizona State University]] in 1980, before studying for a [[Master of Arts]] in philosophy at the [[University of Georgia]], which he completed in 1983. He read for a [[PhD]] at [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]],&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt; writing a [[doctoral thesis|thesis]] on [[environmental ethics]]; this was one of the first on the topic.&lt;ref name="Biographical narrative"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A&amp;M"&gt;"[http://philosophy.tamu.edu/html/bio-Varner.html Gary Varner] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114084555/http://philosophy.tamu.edu/html/bio-Varner.html |date=2016-11-14 }}". Texas A&amp;M University. Accessed November 13, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Developed versions of some of the thesis's chapters were later published as chapters 2, 3 and 4 Varner's first book, ''In Nature's Interests?''. His doctoral research was supervised by Jon Morline, who continued as a supervisor even after leaving Madison to work at [[St. Olaf College]].&lt;ref&gt;Varner 1998, p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating from Madison in 1988, Varner had a number of short-term jobs in the late 1980s; he [[lecturer|lectured]] in philosophy at the [[University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point]] from 1987 to 1988, acted as a [[visiting professor|visiting]] [[assistant professor]] at Madison's Institute of Environmental Studies in the Summer of 1988, and took up the same role, this time in philosophy, at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] from 1988 to 1990.&lt;ref name="CV"&gt;Varner, Gary (2016). [http://philosophy.tamu.edu/~gary/Vita.pdf CV]. Texas A&amp;M University. Accessed November 13, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Varner joined [[Texas A&amp;M University]] in 1990, becoming an assistant professor in 1991. He became Director of Graduate Studies in 1994, a post he kept until 2010. Varner was promoted to [[associate professor]] in 1996, and, in 1998, published his first book: ''In Nature's Interests? Interests, Animal Rights, and Environmental Ethics'', which was a part of [[Oxford University Press]]'s Environmental Ethics and Science Policy Series, edited by Kristin Schrader-Frechette.&lt;ref&gt;Varner 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Varner was promoted to [[full professor]] in 2010, and acted as department head from 2011 to 2014.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;

Varner's second monograph, ''Personhood, Ethics, and Animal Cognition: Situating Animals in the Two-Level Utilitarianism of R. M. Hare'', was published in 2012 by Oxford University Press.&lt;ref name="V2012"&gt;Varner 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Varner had been working on questions about [[R. M. Hare]] and animals since 2001, when he taught a graduate class exploring the subject; given that [[Peter Singer]] was a student of Hare, Varner was interested in exploring whether Hare's philosophy endorsed Singer's conclusions about animal liberation.&lt;ref name="preface"&gt;Varner 2012, pp. xi–xii.&lt;/ref&gt; A project entitled ''Harey Animals: Situating Animals in the Two-Level Utilitarianism of R. M. Hare'' was submitted to Oxford University Press, but this was subsequently split into two books; ''Personhood, Ethics, and Animal Cognition'' was the first, while the second, the forthcoming ''Sustaining Animals: Envisioning Humane, Sustainable Communities'', in under contract with the publisher.&lt;ref name="Biographical narrative"&gt;Varner, Gary. "[http://philosophy.tamu.edu/~gary/bio.html Biographical narrative] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211021501/http://philosophy.tamu.edu/~gary/bio.html |date=2014-12-11 }}". Texas A&amp;M University. Accessed November 13, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="preface"/&gt; While ''Personhood, Ethics, and Animal Cognition'' addresses theoretical issues in Hare's philosophy, ''Sustaining Animals'' is more [[applied ethics|practically focussed]], exploring the applicability of the Harean philosophy developed in ''Personhood, Ethics, and Animal Cognition'' to real-world issues concerning human-animal relationships.&lt;ref name="preface"/&gt; In 2017, Varner's ''Defending Biodiversity: Environmental Science and Ethics'', co-authored with the [[University of Guelph]] [[ecologist]] Jonathan Newman and the Guelph philosopher Stefan Linquist, was published by Cambridge University Press.

==Thought==

===Biocentric individualism===
Varner's ''In Nature's Interests?'' offers a resolution of the debate between individualistic approaches to [[animal rights]] and holistic accounts of environmental ethics. Varner defends an interest-based [[biocentrism (ethics)|biocentric]] individualism according to which all living beings—including plants&lt;ref name="Jensen235"&gt;Jensen 2000, p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt;—have morally significant interests that ground ''prima facie'' (though overridable) duties.&lt;ref&gt;Rowlands 2000, p. 598.&lt;/ref&gt; The approach follows in the tradition of the work of [[Kenneth Goodpaster]] and [[Paul Taylor (philosopher)|Paul Taylor]], though Varner's approach differs from Taylor's in its focus on interests rather than duties, with Varner showing clear [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] commitments.&lt;ref name="Jensen235"/&gt;

Varner begins by critiquing holistic approaches to environmental ethics, using [[J. Baird Callicott]]'s as his example. He argues that the [[philosophic burden of proof|burden of proof]] is with holists to defend the claim that [[ecosystem]]s have interests or have value for some other reason. He next considers desires as the paradigmatic basis of interests, exploring which beings have desires. Nonetheless, he argues that desires cannot be the sole basis of interests; 19th-century mariners, for instance, had an interest in using [[ascorbic acid]] to avoid [[scurvy]], though they could not have desired the acid, as they did not know about it. Instead, such people had a "biological" interest in the acid. It is, Varner argues, the presence of biological interests that separates living beings from artifacts.&lt;ref name="Jensen236"/&gt; This grounds Varner's argument for biocentrism, which [[Mark Rowlands]] summarises as follows:

#Nothing at or below the level of a fish possesses desires.
#Nevertheless, all living things possess biological needs, and these needs are plausibly construed as interests.
#The welfare of an organism O is, at least in part, to be understood in terms of the interests, rather than the desires, of O.
#Therefore, all living things have a welfare.
#Therefore, all living things are morally considerable.&lt;ref&gt;Rowlands 2000, p. 599.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rowlands argues that the problem with the book's central approach is that it assumes that all interests have a clear relation to [[welfare]] and thus moral considerability; an assumption which, he argues, is partially undermined by the introduction of biological interests.&lt;ref&gt;Rowlands 2000, pp. 599–601.&lt;/ref&gt; Jon Jensen, who reviewed the book for ''Ethics and the Environment'', raised a similar worry, arguing that Varner did not sufficiently justify his claim that biological interests are inherently morally significant.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen 2000, p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt;

A distinctive aspect of Varner's theory as presented in ''In Nature's Interests?'' is the hierarchy of interests that he proposes; biological interests are the least important, with desire-based interests of greater significance and "ground projects"—possessed only by humans, these are "a nexus of [an individual's] most important desires"—of the most weight.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen 2000, pp. 237–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Varner defends a kind of "axiological anthropocentrism"; this can be distinguished from "valuational anthropocentrism", according to which only humans have inherent value.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen 2000, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book also has a practical dimension, presenting debates between [[anthropocentrism|anthropocentric]] and non-anthropocentric approaches to environmental ethics as of little practical consequence, and suggesting that animal rights goals can be consistent with holistic environmentalist goals.&lt;ref name="Jensen236"&gt;Jensen 2000, p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt; Jensen argues that Varner's own discussion of the reconciliation of environmentalism and animal advocacy is too narrow, but that, nonetheless, Varner's own biocentric individualism offers potential in this area, even despite the limited engagement in the book with practical animal-related issues.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen 2000, pp. 238–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Two-level utilitarianism===
Hare's philosophy of [[two-level utilitarianism]] has been a focus of Varner's since the early 2000s, and was the subject of his ''Personhood, Ethics, and Animal Cognition''.&lt;ref name="Biographical narrative"/&gt;&lt;ref name="preface"/&gt; In the book, Varner breaks with his previous biocentrism, instead endorsing [[sentientism]] (the idea that [[sentience]] is necessary and sufficient for moral considerability), [[Universal prescriptivism|prescriptivism]], and two-level utilitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;Attfield and Humphreys 2012, p. 493.&lt;/ref&gt; The book is split into three parts: "Hare's Two-Level Utilitarianism", "Persons, Near-Persons, and the Merely Sentient", and "Formulating ILS [Intuitive-Level System] Rules for Persons, Near-Persons, and the Merely Sentient".&lt;ref name="V2012"/&gt; The first part offers a reconstruction and analysis of Hare's philosophy, while the latter two offer an original position on [[animal ethics]] and [[personhood]].&lt;ref&gt;Kadlac 2015, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Part I, Varner offers considerable endorsement of Harean philosophy. Varner interprets Hare as understanding that utilitarianism derives from prescriptivism, and affirms Hare's argument on this point. He goes on to discuss the utility of Intuitive-Level System (ILS) rules;&lt;ref&gt;Attfield and Humphreys 2012, p. 494.&lt;/ref&gt; these are the rules that one lives by in day-to-day life, which, though ultimately justified by it, do not derive their content from utilitarian calculation.&lt;ref&gt;Varner 2012, chap. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; There are, for Varner, four key kinds of ILSs: "common morality, personal morality, professional ethics, and laws". Though these are [[deontological]] in "flavor", following the precepts of these ILSs is generally justified under two-level utilitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;Kadlac 2015, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; Further arguments—these are original, rather than being derived from Hare's own—are then offered for Hare's prescriptivism.&lt;ref&gt;Attfield and Humphreys 2012, pp. 494–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Part II, Varner adopts a [[Higher-order theories of consciousness|higher-order thought theory of consciousness]] and reviews evidence for [[animal consciousness]]. He argues that, according to contemporary science, vertebrates are conscious (i.e., sentient, able to feel pain), but few invertebrates are; [[cephalopod]]s are an exception.&lt;ref name="AH495"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 2014, p. 491.&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to argue that most animals lack a biographical sense of self, something possessed by paradigmatic humans. A good life for human persons, consequently, "consists in living a good story",&lt;ref name="AH495"&gt;Attfield and Humphreys 2012, p. 495.&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that persons can be harmed in ways that non-persons cannot.&lt;ref name="K249"&gt;Kadlac 2015, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; Varner denies that nonhuman animals lack the psychological sophistication necessary for personhood, but argues that some, nonetheless, may be "near-persons"; this means that they lack a biographical sense of self, but possess [[autonoetic consciousness]]. Possible candidates include nonhuman [[primates]], as well as [[Corvidae]], [[Cetacea]] and [[Elephantidae]],&lt;ref name="AH496"/&gt; and [[rat]]s and [[parrot]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 2014, p. 690.&lt;/ref&gt; Varner frames the lives of near-persons as of less significance than the lives of persons, but of greater significance than the lives of other animals who are nonetheless sentient.&lt;ref name="AH496"&gt;Attfield and Humphreys 2012, p. 496.&lt;/ref&gt; The distinctions drawn in Part II are logically independent of any commitment to utilitarianism, Harean or otherwise.&lt;ref name="K249"/&gt;

In Part III, Varner explores the replaceability argument (the idea that it would be ethically acceptable to painlessly kill beings if it was immediately replaced with a new equally happy being) in the context of two-level utilitarianism. At the critical level, he argues that both humans and animals are replaceable. However, he argues that the intuitive-level idea that humans are not replaceable should be respected.&lt;ref&gt;Moss 2015, p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; Animals typically kept on farms are, for Varner, replaceable, meaning that certain forms of [[animal agriculture]] are permissible.&lt;ref name="AH496"/&gt; Varner's also claims that there is a ''prima facie'' good in creating more happy animals and more happy humans,&lt;ref name="M228"/&gt; the latter meaning that there is a ''prima facie'' good in human procreation, and a ''prima facie'' wrong in [[abortion]].&lt;ref name="K249"/&gt; This, however, applies only to critical-level thinking, and good intuitive-level theorising, he argues, would typically leave these decisions up to individuals.&lt;ref name="M228"&gt;Moss 2015, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; Varner also explores the issue of [[argument from marginal cases|"marginal" cases]]. Given that he holds that the lives of nonhuman non-persons and nonhuman near-persons are of lesser value than those of human persons, it may seem that Varner has to accept that the lives of human non-persons and human near-persons are of less value than the lives of human persons or else face the charge of [[speciesism]] or inconsistency. However, Varner argues that human non- and near-persons should be given equal rights to life as human persons on the basis that, first, human persons have strong relationships with human non-persons, and, second, human persons may fear becoming human non-persons.&lt;ref name="AH496"/&gt;

Varner then considers a range of proposals for sustainable, humane agriculture, including replacing cattle with buffalo and engineering blind chickens.&lt;ref name="AH496"/&gt; Varner defends demi-[[vegetarianism]], holding that humans should eat less meat and be more selective about where their meat comes from;&lt;ref&gt;Kadlac 2015, pp. 249–50.&lt;/ref&gt; [[factory farming]], for example, is likely unacceptable.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 2014, p. 659.&lt;/ref&gt; The book closes with a consideration of the relationship between a Harean approach to animal ethics and Singer's approach; Varner argues that Singer has employed two-level utilitarianism, and implicitly supports the idea of near-persons. Varmer also argues that Singer, despite the latter's advocacy for vegetarianism, presents a theory that supports certain forms of humane agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Attfield and Humphreys 2012, pp. 496–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Genetic drift''' (also known as '''allelic drift''' or the '''Sewall Wright effect''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = [[The Structure of Evolutionary Theory]] | year = 2002 | first = Stephen Jay | last = Gould | name-list-format = vanc | author-link = Stephen Jay Gould | chapter = Chapter 7, section "Synthesis as Hardening" }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the change in the frequency of an existing [[gene]] variant ([[allele]]) in a population due to random sampling of organisms.&lt;ref name="Masel 2011"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Masel J | title = Genetic drift | journal = Current Biology | volume = 21 | issue = 20 | pages = R837-8 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 22032182 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2011.08.007 | publisher = [[Cell Press]] | authorlink = Joanna Masel }}&lt;/ref&gt; The alleles in the offspring are a sample of those in the parents, and [[probability|chance]] has a role in determining whether a given individual survives and reproduces. A population's [[allele frequency]] is the fraction of the copies of one gene that share a particular form.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futuyma|1998|loc=Glossary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic drift may cause gene variants to disappear completely and thereby reduce [[genetic variation]].&lt;ref name="Star_2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Star B, Spencer HG | title = Effects of genetic drift and gene flow on the selective maintenance of genetic variation | journal = Genetics | volume = 194 | issue = 1 | pages = 235–44 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23457235 | pmc = 3632471 | doi = 10.1534/genetics.113.149781 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also cause initially rare alleles to become much more frequent and even fixed. 

When there are few copies of an allele, the effect of genetic drift is larger, and when there are many copies the effect is smaller. In the early 20th century, vigorous debates occurred over the relative importance of [[natural selection]] versus neutral processes, including genetic drift. [[Ronald Fisher]], who explained natural selection using [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendelian genetics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Miller|2000|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; held the view that genetic drift plays at the most a minor role in [[evolution]], and this remained the dominant view for several decades. In 1968, population geneticist [[Motoo Kimura]] rekindled the debate with his [[neutral theory of molecular evolution]], which claims that most instances where a genetic change [[Fixation (population genetics)|spreads across a population]] (although not necessarily changes in [[phenotype]]s) are caused by genetic drift acting on neutral [[mutation]]s.&lt;ref name="Kimura_1968"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kimura M | title = Evolutionary rate at the molecular level | journal = Nature | volume = 217 | issue = 5129 | pages = 624–6 | date = February 1968 | pmid = 5637732 | doi = 10.1038/217624a0 | publisher = Nature Publishing Group | authorlink = Motoo Kimura | bibcode = 1968Natur.217..624K }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Futuyma 1998 320"&gt;{{harvnb|Futuyma|1998|p=320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analogy with marbles in a jar==

The process of genetic drift can be illustrated using 20 marbles in a jar to represent 20 organisms in a population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/samplingerror_01 |title=Sampling Error and Evolution |website=Understanding Evolution |publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]] |access-date=2015-12-01 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208125724/http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/samplingerror_01 |archive-date=8 December 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consider this jar of marbles as the starting population. Half of the marbles in the jar are red and half are blue, with each colour corresponding to a different allele of one gene in the population. In each new generation the organisms reproduce at random. To represent this reproduction, randomly select a marble from the original jar and deposit a new marble with the same colour into a new jar. This is the "offspring" of the original marble, meaning that the original marble remains in its jar. Repeat this process until there are 20 new marbles in the second jar. The second jar will now contain 20 "offspring", or marbles of various colours. Unless the second jar contains exactly 10 red marbles and 10 blue marbles, a random shift has occurred in the allele frequencies.

If this process is repeated a number of times, the numbers of red and blue marbles picked each generation will fluctuate. Sometimes a jar will have more red marbles than its "parent" jar and sometimes more blue. This fluctuation is analogous to genetic drift&amp;nbsp;– a change in the population's allele frequency resulting from a random variation in the distribution of alleles from one generation to the next.

It is even possible that in any one generation no marbles of a particular colour are chosen, meaning they have no offspring. In this example, if no red marbles are selected, the jar representing the new generation contains only blue offspring. If this happens, the red allele has been lost permanently in the population, while the remaining blue allele has become fixed: all future generations are entirely blue. In small populations, [[Fixation (population genetics)|fixation]] can occur in just a few generations.

[[File:Random sampling genetic drift.svg|thumb|center|550px|In this simulation each black dot on a marble signifies that it has been chosen for copying (reproduction) one time. There is [[Fixation (population genetics)|fixation]] in the blue "allele" within five generations.]]

==Probability and allele frequency==
The mechanisms of genetic drift can be illustrated with a simplified example. Consider a very large colony of [[bacteria]] isolated in a drop of solution. The bacteria are genetically identical except for a single gene with two alleles labeled '''A''' and '''B'''. '''A''' and '''B''' are neutral alleles meaning that they do not affect the bacteria's ability to survive and reproduce; all bacteria in this colony are equally likely to survive and reproduce. Suppose that half the bacteria have allele '''A''' and the other half have allele '''B'''. Thus '''A''' and '''B''' each have allele frequency 1/2.

The drop of solution then shrinks until it has only enough food to sustain four bacteria. All other bacteria die without reproducing. Among the four who survive, there are sixteen possible [[combination]]s for the '''A''' and '''B''' alleles:

'''(A-A-A-A), (B-A-A-A), (A-B-A-A), (B-B-A-A), &lt;br /&gt; (A-A-B-A), (B-A-B-A), (A-B-B-A), (B-B-B-A),&lt;br /&gt; (A-A-A-B), (B-A-A-B), (A-B-A-B), (B-B-A-B),&lt;br /&gt; (A-A-B-B), (B-A-B-B), (A-B-B-B), (B-B-B-B).'''

Since all bacteria in the original solution are equally likely to survive when the solution shrinks, the four survivors are a random sample from the original colony. The [[probability]] that each of the four survivors has a given allele is 1/2, and so the probability that any particular allele combination occurs when the solution shrinks is

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{16}.
&lt;/math&gt;

(The original population size is so large that the sampling effectively happens without replacement). In other words, each of the sixteen possible allele combinations is equally likely to occur, with probability 1/16.

Counting the combinations with the same number of '''A''' and '''B''', we get the following table.
{| class=wikitable
|-
| '''A'''
| '''B'''
| Combinations
| Probability
|-
| 4
| 0
| 1
| 1/16
|-
| 3
| 1
| 4
| 4/16
|-
| 2

| 6
| 6/16
|-
| 1
| 3
| 4
| 4/16
|-
| 0
| 4
| 1
| 1/16
|}

As shown in the table, the total number of combinations that have the same number of '''A''' alleles as of '''B''' alleles is six, and the probability of this combination is 6/16. The total number of other combinations is ten, so the probability of unequal number of '''A''' and '''B''' alleles is 10/16. Thus, although the original colony began with an equal number of '''A''' and '''B''' alleles, it is very possible that the number of alleles in the remaining population of four members will not be equal. Equal numbers is actually less likely than unequal numbers. In the latter case, genetic drift has occurred because the population's allele frequencies have changed due to random sampling. In this example the population contracted to just four random survivors, a phenomenon known as [[population bottleneck]].

The probabilities for the number of copies of allele '''A''' (or '''B''') that survive (given in the last column of the above table) can be calculated directly from the [[binomial distribution]] where the "success" probability (probability of a given allele being present) is 1/2 (i.e., the probability that there are ''k'' copies of '''A''' (or '''B''') alleles in the combination) is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
{n\choose k} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k \left(1-\frac{1}{2}\right)^{n-k}={n\choose k} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n\!
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''n=4'' is the number of surviving bacteria.

==Mathematical models==

Mathematical models of genetic drift can be designed using either [[branching process]]es or a [[diffusion equation]] describing changes in allele frequency in an [[idealised population]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wahl LM | title = Fixation when N and s vary: classic approaches give elegant new results | journal = Genetics | volume = 188 | issue = 4 | pages = 783–5 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21828279 | pmc = 3176088 | doi = 10.1534/genetics.111.131748 | publisher = [[Genetics Society of America]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wright–Fisher&lt;!--this has c. 6x as many hits as Fisher-Wright, so please leave it alone--&gt; model===

Consider a gene with two alleles, '''A''' or '''B'''. In [[Ploidy#Diploid|diploid]] populations consisting of ''N'' individuals there are 2''N'' copies of each gene. An individual can have two copies of the same allele or two different alleles. We can call the frequency of one allele ''p'' and the frequency of the other ''q''. The Wright–Fisher model (named after [[Sewall Wright]] and [[Ronald Fisher]]) assumes that generations do not overlap (for example, [[annual plant]]s have exactly one generation per year) and that each copy of the gene found in the new generation is drawn independently at random from all copies of the gene in the old generation. The formula to calculate the probability of obtaining ''k'' copies of an allele that had frequency ''p'' in the last generation is then&lt;ref name="Hartl_p112"&gt;{{harvnb|Hartl|Clark|2007|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tian|2008|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{(2N)!}{k!(2N-k)!} p^k q^{2N-k} &lt;/math&gt;

where the symbol "'''!'''" signifies the [[factorial]] function. This expression can also be formulated using the [[binomial coefficient]],

:&lt;math&gt;{2N \choose k}  p^k q^{2N-k} &lt;/math&gt;

===Moran model===

The [[Moran process|Moran model]] assumes overlapping generations. At each time step, one individual is chosen to reproduce and one individual is chosen to die. So in each timestep, the number of copies of a given allele can go up by one, go down by one, or can stay the same. This means that the [[Stochastic matrix|transition matrix]] is [[tridiagonal matrix|tridiagonal]], which means that mathematical solutions are easier for the Moran model than for the Wright–Fisher model. On the other hand, [[computer simulation]]s are usually easier to perform using the Wright–Fisher model, because fewer time steps need to be calculated. In the Moran model, it takes ''N'' timesteps to get through one generation, where ''N'' is the [[effective population size]]. In the Wright–Fisher model, it takes just one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Moran | first = P. A. P. | name-list-format = vanc | authorlink = Pat Moran (statistician) | doi = 10.1017/S0305004100033193 | title = Random processes in genetics | journal = [[Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society]]| volume = 54 |issue=1| pages = 60–71| year = 1958 | pmid =  | pmc = | bibcode = 1958PCPS...54...60M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, the Moran and Wright–Fisher models give qualitatively similar results, but genetic drift runs twice as fast in the Moran model.

===Other models of drift===

If the variance in the number of offspring is much greater than that given by the binomial distribution assumed by the Wright–Fisher model, then given the same overall speed of genetic drift (the variance effective population size), genetic drift is a less powerful force compared to selection.&lt;ref name="Charlesworth09" /&gt; Even for the same variance, if higher [[Moment (mathematics)|moments]] of the offspring number distribution exceed those of the binomial distribution then again the force of genetic drift is substantially weakened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Der R, Epstein CL, Plotkin JB | title = Generalized population models and the nature of genetic drift | journal = Theoretical Population Biology | volume = 80 | issue = 2 | pages = 80–99 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 21718713 | doi = 10.1016/j.tpb.2011.06.004 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | authorlink2 = Charles Epstein }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Random effects other than sampling error===

Random changes in allele frequencies can also be caused by effects other than [[sampling error]], for example random changes in selection pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Li|Graur|1991|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One important alternative source of [[Stochastic#Biology|stochastic]]ity, perhaps more important than genetic drift, is [[genetic hitchhiking|genetic draft]].&lt;ref name="gillespie 2001"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gillespie JH | title = Is the population size of a species relevant to its evolution? | journal = Evolution; International Journal of Organic Evolution | volume = 55 | issue = 11 | pages = 2161–9 | date = November 2001 | pmid = 11794777 | doi = 10.1111/j.0014-3820.2001.tb00732.x | publisher = [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] for the [[Society for the Study of Evolution]] | authorlink = John H. Gillespie }}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic draft is the effect on a [[Locus (genetics)|locus]] by selection on [[genetic linkage|linked]] loci. The mathematical properties of genetic draft are different from those of genetic drift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Neher RA, Shraiman BI | title = Genetic draft and quasi-neutrality in large facultatively sexual populations | journal = Genetics | volume = 188 | issue = 4 | pages = 975–96 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21625002 | pmc = 3176096 | doi = 10.1534/genetics.111.128876 | publisher = Genetics Society of America | arxiv = 1108.1635 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The direction of the random change in allele frequency  is [[autocorrelation|autocorrelated]] across generations.&lt;ref name="Masel 2011" /&gt;

==Drift and fixation==
The [[Hardy–Weinberg principle]] states that within sufficiently large populations, the allele frequencies remain constant from one generation to the next unless the equilibrium is disturbed by [[gene flow|migration]], genetic [[mutation]]s, or [[Selection (biology)|selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ewens|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in finite populations, no new alleles are gained from the random sampling of alleles passed to the next generation, but the sampling can cause an existing allele to disappear. Because [[random sample|random sampling]] can remove, but not replace, an allele, and because random declines or increases in allele frequency influence expected allele distributions for the next generation, genetic drift drives a population towards genetic uniformity over time. When an allele reaches a frequency of 1 (100%) it is said to be "fixed" in the population and when an allele reaches a frequency of 0 (0%) it is lost. Smaller populations achieve fixation faster, whereas in the limit of an infinite population, fixation is not achieved. Once an allele becomes fixed, genetic drift comes to a halt, and the allele frequency cannot change unless a new allele is introduced in the population via mutation or [[gene flow]]. Thus even while genetic drift is a random, directionless process, it acts to eliminate genetic variation over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Li|Graur|1991|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rate of allele frequency change due to drift===
[[File:Random genetic drift chart.png|thumb|250px|Ten simulations of random genetic drift of a single given allele with an initial frequency distribution 0.5 measured over the course of 50 generations, repeated in three reproductively synchronous populations of different sizes. In these simulations, alleles drift to loss or fixation (frequency of 0.0 or 1.0) only in the smallest population.]]
Assuming genetic drift is the only evolutionary force acting on an allele, after ''t'' generations in many replicated populations, starting with allele frequencies of ''p'' and ''q'', the variance in allele frequency across those populations is

: &lt;math&gt;
V_t \approx pq\left(1-\exp\left(-\frac{t}{2N_e} \right)\right)
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barton|Briggs|Eisen|Goldstein|2007|p=417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Time to fixation or loss===
Assuming genetic drift is the only evolutionary force acting on an allele, at any given time the probability that an allele will eventually become fixed in the population is simply its frequency in the population at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futuyma|1998|p=300}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if the frequency ''p'' for allele '''A''' is 75% and the frequency ''q'' for allele '''B''' is 25%, then given unlimited time the probability '''A''' will ultimately become fixed in the population is 75% and the probability that '''B''' will become fixed is 25%.

The expected number of generations for fixation to occur is [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the population size, such that fixation is predicted to occur much more rapidly in smaller populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Otto SP, Whitlock MC | title = The probability of fixation in populations of changing size | journal = Genetics | volume = 146 | issue = 2 | pages = 723–33 | date = June 1997 | pmid = 9178020 | pmc = 1208011 | url = http://www.genetics.org/content/146/2/723.full.pdf | publisher = Genetics Society of America | format = PDF | df = dmy-all | deadurl = no | archive-date = 19 March 2015 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150319042554/http://www.genetics.org/content/146/2/723.full.pdf | authorlink1 = Sarah Otto }}&lt;/ref&gt; Normally the effective population size, which is smaller than the total population, is used to determine these probabilities. The effective population (''N''&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt;) takes into account factors such as the level of [[inbreeding]], the stage of the lifecycle in which the population is the smallest, and the fact that some neutral genes are genetically linked to others that are under selection.&lt;ref name="Charlesworth09"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Charlesworth B | title = Fundamental concepts in genetics: effective population size and patterns of molecular evolution and variation | journal = Nature Reviews. Genetics | volume = 10 | issue = 3 | pages = 195–205 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19204717 | doi = 10.1038/nrg2526 | publisher = [[Nature Publishing Group]] | authorlink = Brian Charlesworth }}&lt;/ref&gt; The effective population size may not be the same for every gene in the same population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cutter AD, Choi JY | title = Natural selection shapes nucleotide polymorphism across the genome of the nematode Caenorhabditis briggsae | journal = Genome Research | volume = 20 | issue = 8 | pages = 1103–11 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20508143 | pmc = 2909573 | doi = 10.1101/gr.104331.109 | publisher = [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One forward-looking formula used for approximating the expected time before a neutral allele becomes fixed through genetic drift, according to the Wright–Fisher model, is

: &lt;math&gt;
\bar{T}_\text{fixed} = \frac{-4N_e(1-p) \ln (1-p)}{p}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''T'' is the number of generations, ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt; is the effective population size, and ''p'' is the initial frequency for the given allele. The result is the number of generations [[Expected value|expected]] to pass before fixation occurs for a given allele in a population with given size (''N''&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt;) and allele frequency (''p'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hedrick|2005|p=315}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The expected time for the neutral allele to be lost through genetic drift can be calculated as&lt;ref name="Hartl_p112" /&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
\bar{T}_\text{lost} = \frac{-4N_ep}{1-p} \ln p.
&lt;/math&gt;

When a mutation appears only once in a population large enough for the initial frequency to be negligible, the formulas can be simplified to&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Li|Graur|1991|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
\bar{T}_\text{fixed} = 4N_e
&lt;/math&gt;

for average number of generations expected before fixation of a neutral mutation, and

: &lt;math&gt;
\bar{T}_\text{lost} = 2 \left ( \frac{N_e}{N} \right ) \ln (2N)
&lt;/math&gt;

for the average number of generations expected before the loss of a neutral mutation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kimura|Ohta|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Time to loss with both drift and mutation===
The formulae above apply to an allele that is already present in a population, and which is subject to neither mutation nor natural selection. If an allele is lost by mutation much more often than it is gained by mutation, then mutation, as well as drift, may influence the time to loss. If the allele prone to mutational loss begins as fixed in the population, and is lost by mutation at rate m per replication, then the expected time in generations until its loss in a haploid population is given by

: &lt;math&gt;
\bar{T}_\text{lost} \approx \begin{cases}
\dfrac 1 m, \text{ if } mN_e \ll 1\\[8pt]
\dfrac{\ln{(mN_e)}+\gamma} m \text{ if } mN_e \gg 1
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is [[Euler–Mascheroni constant|Euler's constant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Masel J, King OD, Maughan H | title = The loss of adaptive plasticity during long periods of environmental stasis | journal = The American Naturalist | volume = 169 | issue = 1 | pages = 38–46 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17206583 | pmc = 1766558 | doi = 10.1086/510212 | publisher = [[University of Chicago Press]] on behalf of the [[American Society of Naturalists]] | author1link = Joanna Masel }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first approximation represents the waiting time until the first mutant destined for loss, with loss then occurring relatively rapidly by genetic drift, taking time ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≪&amp;nbsp;1/''m''. The second approximation represents the time needed for deterministic loss by mutation accumulation. In both cases, the time to fixation is dominated by mutation via the term 1/''m'', and is less affected by the [[effective population size]].

==Versus natural selection==
In natural populations, genetic drift and natural selection do not act in isolation; both forces are always at play, together with mutation and migration. Neutral evolution is the product of both mutation and drift, not of drift alone. Similarly, even when selection overwhelms genetic drift, it can only act on variation that mutation provides.

While natural selection has a direction, guiding evolution towards heritable [[adaptation]]s to the current environment, genetic drift has no direction and is guided only by the [[probability|mathematics of chance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.actionbioscience.org/evolution/futuyma.html |title=Natural Selection: How Evolution Works |work=[[Actionbioscience]] |publisher=[[American Institute of Biological Sciences]] |location=Washington, D.C. |access-date=2009-11-24 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106013805/http://www.actionbioscience.org/evolution/futuyma.html |archive-date=6 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }} An interview with [[Douglas J. Futuyma]]. See answer to question: Is natural selection the only mechanism of evolution?&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, drift acts upon the [[genotype frequency|genotypic frequencies]] within a population without regard to their phenotypic effects. In contrast, selection favors the spread of alleles whose phenotypic effects increase survival and/or reproduction of their carriers, lowers the frequencies of alleles that cause unfavorable traits, and ignores those that are neutral.&lt;ref name="humangenes"&gt;{{harvnb|Cavalli-Sforza|Menozzi|Piazza|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[law of large numbers]] predicts that when the absolute number of copies of the allele is small (e.g., [[small population size|in small populations]]), the magnitude of drift on allele frequencies per generation is larger. The magnitude of drift is large enough to overwhelm selection at any allele frequency when the [[selection coefficient]] is less than 1 divided by the effective population size. Non-adaptive evolution resulting from the product of mutation and genetic drift is therefore considered to be a consequential mechanism of evolutionary change primarily within small, isolated populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zimmer|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mathematics of genetic drift depend on the effective population size, but it is not clear how this is related to the actual number of individuals in a population.&lt;ref name="gillespie 2001" /&gt; [[Genetic linkage]] to other genes that are under selection can reduce the effective population size experienced by a neutral allele. With a higher [[homologous recombination|recombination]] rate, linkage decreases and with it this local effect on effective population size.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Golding|1994|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Charlesworth B, Morgan MT, Charlesworth D | title = The effect of deleterious mutations on neutral molecular variation | journal = Genetics | volume = 134 | issue = 4 | pages = 1289–303 | date = August 1993 | pmid = 8375663 | pmc = 1205596 | url = http://www.genetics.org/content/134/4/1289.full.pdf | publisher = Genetics Society of America | authorlink3 = Deborah Charlesworth }}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect is visible in molecular data as a correlation between local recombination rate and [[genetic diversity]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Presgraves DC | title = Recombination enhances protein adaptation in Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Current Biology | volume = 15 | issue = 18 | pages = 1651–6 | date = September 2005 | pmid = 16169487 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2005.07.065 | publisher = Cell Press | authorlink = Daven Presgraves }}&lt;/ref&gt; and negative correlation between gene density and diversity at [[noncoding DNA]] regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nordborg M, Hu TT, Ishino Y, Jhaveri J, Toomajian C, Zheng H, Bakker E, Calabrese P, Gladstone J, Goyal R, Jakobsson M, Kim S, Morozov Y, Padhukasahasram B, Plagnol V, Rosenberg NA, Shah C, Wall JD, Wang J, Zhao K, Kalbfleisch T, Schulz V, Kreitman M, Bergelson J | title = The pattern of polymorphism in Arabidopsis thaliana | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 7 | pages = e196 | date = July 2005 | pmid = 15907155 | pmc = 1135296 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0030196 | publisher = [[PLOS|Public Library of Science]] }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stochasticity associated with linkage to other genes that are under selection is not the same as sampling error, and is sometimes known as [[genetic hitchhiking|genetic draft]] in order to distinguish it from genetic drift.&lt;ref name="gillespie 2001" /&gt;

When the allele frequency is very small, drift can also overpower selection even in large populations. For example, while disadvantageous mutations are usually eliminated quickly in large populations, new advantageous mutations are almost as vulnerable to loss through genetic drift as are neutral mutations. Not until the allele frequency for the advantageous mutation reaches a certain threshold will genetic drift have no effect.&lt;ref name="humangenes" /&gt;

==Population bottleneck==
{{Main|Population bottleneck}}
[[File:Population bottleneck.jpg|thumb|350px|Changes in a population's allele frequency following a [[population bottleneck]]: the rapid and radical decline in population size has reduced the population's [[genetic variation]].]]
A population bottleneck is when a population contracts to a significantly smaller size over a short period of time due to some random environmental event. In a true population bottleneck, the odds for survival of any member of the population are purely random, and are not improved by any particular inherent genetic advantage. The bottleneck can result in radical changes in allele frequencies, completely independent of selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-last=Robinson |editor-first=Richard | name-list-format = vanc |encyclopedia=Genetics |title=Population Bottleneck |url=http://www.bookrags.com/research/population-bottleneck-gen-03/ |access-date=2015-12-14 |year=2003 |publisher=[[Gale (publisher)|Macmillan Reference USA]] |volume=3 |location=New York |isbn=0-02-865609-1 |lccn=2002003560 |oclc=614996575 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303210737/http://www.bookrags.com/research/population-bottleneck-gen-03/ |archive-date=3 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact of a population bottleneck can be sustained, even when the bottleneck is caused by a one-time event such as a natural catastrophe.
An interesting example of a bottleneck causing unusual genetic distribution is the relatively high proportion of individuals with total [[rod cell]] [[color blindness]] ([[achromatopsia]]) on [[Pingelap|Pingelap atoll]] in [[Federated States of Micronesia|Micronesia]]. After a bottleneck, inbreeding increases. This increases the damage done by recessive deleterious mutations, in a process known as [[inbreeding depression]]. The worst of these mutations are selected against, leading to the loss of other alleles that are [[linkage disequilibrium|genetically linked]] to them, in a process of [[background selection]].&lt;ref name="Masel 2011" /&gt; For recessive harmful mutations, this selection can be enhanced as a consequence of the bottleneck, due to [[genetic purging]]. This leads to a further loss of genetic diversity. In addition, a sustained reduction in population size increases the likelihood of further allele fluctuations from drift in generations to come.

A population's genetic variation can be greatly reduced by a bottleneck, and even beneficial adaptations may be permanently eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futuyma|1998|pp=303–304}}&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of variation leaves the surviving population vulnerable to any new selection pressures such as disease, [[climate change]] or shift in the available food source, because adapting in response to environmental changes requires sufficient genetic variation in the population for natural selection to take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Corry-Crowe G | title = Climate change and the molecular ecology of Arctic marine mammals | journal = Ecological Applications | volume = 18 | issue = 2 Suppl | pages = S56-76 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18494363 | doi = 10.1890/06-0795.1 | publisher = [[Ecological Society of America]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cornuet JM, Luikart G | title = Description and power analysis of two tests for detecting recent population bottlenecks from allele frequency data | journal = Genetics | volume = 144 | issue = 4 | pages = 2001–14 | date = December 1996 | pmid = 8978083 | pmc = 1207747 | publisher = Genetics Society of America }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been many known cases of population bottleneck in the recent past. Prior to the arrival of [[Europeans]], [[North America]]n prairies were habitat for millions of [[greater prairie chicken]]s. In [[Illinois]] alone, their numbers plummeted from about 100 million birds in 1900 to about 50 birds in the 1990s. The declines in population resulted from hunting and habitat destruction, but a consequence has been a loss of most of the species' genetic diversity. [[DNA]] analysis comparing birds from the mid century to birds in the 1990s documents a steep decline in the genetic variation in just the latter few decades. Currently the greater prairie chicken is experiencing low [[reproductive success]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sadava|Heller|Orians|Purves|2008|loc=chpts. 1, 21–33, 52–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the genetic loss caused by bottleneck and genetic drift can increase fitness, as in ''[[Ehrlichia]]''.&lt;ref name="DaleMoran2006"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dale C, Moran NA | title = Molecular interactions between bacterial symbionts and their hosts | journal = Cell | volume = 126 | issue = 3 | pages = 453–65 | date = August 2006 | pmid = 16901780 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2006.07.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over-hunting also caused a severe population bottleneck in the [[northern elephant seal]] in the 19th century. Their resulting decline in genetic variation can be deduced by comparing it to that of the [[southern elephant seal]], which were not so aggressively hunted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/bottlenecks_01 |title=Bottlenecks and founder effects |work=Understanding Evolution |publisher=University of California, Berkeley |access-date=2015-12-14 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151204051014/http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/bottlenecks_01 |archive-date=4 December 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Founder effect===
{{Main|Founder effect}}
[[File:Founder effect with drift.jpg|thumb|right|350px|When very few members of a population migrate to form a separate new population, the founder effect occurs. For a period after the foundation, the small population experiences intensive drift. In the figure this results in fixation of the red allele.]]
The founder effect is a special case of a population bottleneck, occurring when a small group in a population splinters off from the original population and forms a new one. The random sample of alleles in the just formed new colony is expected to grossly misrepresent the original population in at least some respects.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Campbell|1996|p=423}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is even possible that the number of alleles for some genes in the original population is larger than the number of gene copies in the founders, making complete representation impossible. When a newly formed colony is small, its founders can strongly affect the population's genetic make-up far into the future.

A well-documented example is found in the [[Amish]] migration to [[Pennsylvania]] in 1744. Two members of the new colony shared the recessive allele for [[Ellis–van Creveld syndrome]]. Members of the colony and their descendants tend to be religious isolates and remain relatively insular. As a result of many generations of inbreeding, Ellis-van Creveld syndrome is now much more prevalent among the Amish than in the general population.&lt;ref name="humangenes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PBS_Evolution_founder"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/library/06/3/l_063_03.html |title=Genetic Drift and the Founder Effect |year=2001 |website=Evolution Library |series=Evolution |publisher=[[WGBH Educational Foundation]]; Clear Blue Sky Productions, Inc. |location=Boston, MA |type=Web resource |oclc=48165595 |access-date=2009-04-07 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090314040513/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/library/06/3/l_063_03.html |archive-date=14 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The difference in gene frequencies between the original population and colony may also trigger the two groups to [[genetic divergence|diverge]] significantly over the course of many generations. As the difference, or [[genetic distance]], increases, the two separated populations may become distinct, both genetically and [[phenotype|phenetically]], although not only genetic drift but also natural selection, gene flow, and mutation contribute to this divergence. This potential for relatively rapid changes in the colony's gene frequency led most scientists to consider the founder effect (and by extension, genetic drift) a significant driving force in the evolution of [[speciation|new species]]. Sewall Wright was the first to attach this significance to random drift and small, newly isolated populations with his [[shifting balance theory]] of speciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wolf|Brodie|Wade|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following after Wright, [[Ernst Mayr]] created many persuasive models to show that the decline in genetic variation and small population size following the founder effect were critically important for new species to develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hey|Fitch|Ayala|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is much less support for this view today since the hypothesis has been tested repeatedly through experimental research and the results have been equivocal at best.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Howard|Berlocher|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{further|Modern synthesis (20th century)}}
The concept of genetic drift was introduced by a founder of [[population genetics]], [[Sewall Wright]]. His first use of the term "drift" was in 1929,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wright |first=Sewall |authorlink=Sewall Wright | name-list-format = vanc |date=November–December 1929 |title=The evolution of dominance |journal=The American Naturalist |location=Chicago, IL |publisher=University of Chicago Press on behalf of the American Society of Naturalists |volume=63 |issue=689 |pages=556–561 |doi=10.1086/280290 |issn=0003-0147 |jstor=2456825}}&lt;/ref&gt; though at the time he was using it in the sense of a directed process of change, or natural selection. Random drift by means of sampling error came to be known as the "Sewall–Wright effect," though he was never entirely comfortable to see his name given to it. Wright referred to all changes in allele frequency as either "steady drift" (e.g., selection) or "random drift" (e.g., sampling error).&lt;ref name="Wright55"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wright |first=Sewall | name-list-format = vanc |year=1955 |title=Classification of the factors of evolution |journal=Cold Spring Harbor Symposia on Quantitative Biology |location=Cold Spring Harbor, NY |publisher=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press |volume=20 |pages=16–24 |doi=10.1101/SQB.1955.020.01.004 |issn=0091-7451}} Symposium: "Population Genetics: The Nature and Causes of Genetic Variability in Populations".&lt;/ref&gt; "Drift" came to be adopted as a technical term in the [[stochastic]] sense exclusively.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stevenson|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today it is usually defined still more narrowly, in terms of sampling error,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freeman|Herron|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this narrow definition is not universal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Masel J | title = Rethinking Hardy-Weinberg and genetic drift in undergraduate biology | journal = BioEssays | volume = 34 | issue = 8 | pages = 701–10 | date = August 2012 | pmid = 22576789 | doi = 10.1002/bies.201100178 | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lynch|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wright wrote that the "restriction of "random drift" or even "drift" to only one component, the effects of accidents of sampling, tends to lead to confusion."&lt;ref name="Wright55" /&gt; Sewall Wright considered the process of random genetic drift by means of sampling error equivalent to that by means of inbreeding, but later work has shown them to be distinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Crow JF | title = Wright and Fisher on inbreeding and random drift | journal = Genetics | volume = 184 | issue = 3 | pages = 609–11 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20332416 | pmc = 2845331 | doi = 10.1534/genetics.109.110023 | publisher = Genetics Society of America | authorlink = James F. Crow }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early days of the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]], scientists were beginning to blend the new science of population genetics with [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of natural selection. Within this framework, Wright focused on the effects of inbreeding on small relatively isolated populations. He introduced the concept of an [[Fitness landscape|adaptive landscape]] in which phenomena such as cross breeding and genetic drift in small populations could push them away from adaptive peaks, which in turn allow natural selection to push them towards new adaptive peaks.&lt;ref name="Larson221-243"&gt;{{harvnb|Larson|2004|pp=221–243}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wright thought smaller populations were more suited for natural selection because "inbreeding was sufficiently intense to create new interaction systems through random drift but not intense enough to cause random nonadaptive fixation of genes."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stevenson|1991}}: Quote attributed to [[Will Provine|William B. Provine]] in ''The Origins of Theoretical Population Genetics'' (1971), p. 162; Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wright's views on the role of genetic drift in the evolutionary scheme were controversial almost from the very beginning. One of the most vociferous and influential critics was colleague Ronald Fisher. Fisher conceded genetic drift played some role in evolution, but an insignificant one. Fisher has been accused of misunderstanding Wright's views because in his criticisms Fisher seemed to argue Wright had rejected selection almost entirely. To Fisher, viewing the process of evolution as a long, steady, adaptive progression was the only way to explain the ever-increasing complexity from simpler forms. But the debates have continued between the "gradualists" and those who lean more toward the Wright model of evolution where selection and drift together play an important role.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Avers|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, Motoo Kimura rekindled the debate with his neutral theory of molecular evolution, which claims that most of the genetic changes are caused by genetic drift acting on neutral mutations.&lt;ref name="Kimura_1968" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Futuyma 1998 320" /&gt;

The role of genetic drift by means of sampling error in evolution has been criticized by [[John H. Gillespie]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gillespie JH | title = Genetic drift in an infinite population.

Provine]], who argue that selection on linked sites is a more important stochastic force.

[[File:Saint Irenaeus.jpg|thumb|236px&lt;!--(approx Sidebar/Infobox)--&gt;|Saint [[Irenaeus]], the second-century philosopher and theologian who inspired the development of the Irenaean theodicy.]]
{{Philosophy of religion sidebar |challenges}}

The '''Irenaean theodicy''' is a Christian [[theodicy]] (a response to the [[problem of evil]]). It defends the probability of an [[omnipotent]] and [[omnibenevolent]] (all-powerful and perfectly loving) God in the face of evidence of evil in the world. Numerous variations of theodicy have been proposed which all maintain that, while evil exists, God is either not responsible for creating evil, or he is not guilty for creating evil. Typically, the Irenaean theodicy asserts that the world is the [[best of all possible worlds]] because it allows humans to fully develop. Most versions of the Irenaean theodicy propose that creation is incomplete, as humans are not yet fully developed, and experiencing evil and suffering is necessary for such development.

Second-century philosopher and theologian [[Irenaeus]], after whom the theodicy is named, proposed a two-stage creation process in which humans require free will and the experience of evil to develop. Another early Christian theologian, [[Origen]], presented a response to the problem of evil which cast the world as a schoolroom or hospital for the soul; theologian Mark Scott has argued that Origen, rather than Irenaeus, ought to be considered the father of this kind of theodicy. [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] argued in the nineteenth century that God must necessarily create flawlessly, so this world must be the best possible world because it allows God's purposes to be naturally fulfilled. In 1966, philosopher [[John Hick]] discussed the similarities of the preceding theodicies, calling them all "Irenaean". He supported the view that creation is incomplete and argued that the world is best placed for the full moral development of humans, as it presents genuine moral choices. British philosopher [[Richard Swinburne]] proposed that, to make a free moral choice, humans must have experience of the consequences of their own actions and that natural evil must exist to provide such choices.

The development of [[process theology]] has challenged the Irenaean tradition by teaching that God's power is limited and that he cannot be responsible for evil. Twentieth-century philosopher [[Alvin Plantinga]] supported the idea that this world is the best possible world, arguing that the good in the world (including God's infinite goodness) outweighs the evil and proposing that the ultimate good of God's sacrifice when Jesus was crucified necessitated the existence of evil. His free will defence was not a theodicy because he was trying to show the logical compatibility of evil and the existence of God, rather than the probability of God. [[D. Z. Phillips]] and [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] challenged the instrumental use of suffering, suggesting that love cannot be expressed through suffering. However, Dostoyevsky also states that the beauty of love is evident, in that love can continue to grow, withstand and overcome even the most evil acts. [[Michael Tooley]] argued that the magnitude of suffering is excessive and that, in some cases, cannot lead to moral development. French theologian [[Henri Blocher]] criticised Hick's universalism, arguing that such a view negates free will, which was similarly important to the theodicy.

==Outline==
The Irenaean theodicy was first identified as a form of theodicy by [[John Hick]] in ''Evil and the God of Love'', written in 1966. Hick distinguished between the [[Augustinian theodicy]], which is based on free will, and the Irenaean theodicy, which casts God as responsible for evil but justified in it.&lt;ref name=Hall2003&gt;Hall 2003, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; The Irenaean theodicy is distinguished by its acceptance that God is responsible for evil, but that he is not at fault.&lt;ref&gt;Svendsen &amp; Pierce 2010, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evidential problem of evil===
The Irenaean theodicy is a response to the [[evidential problem of evil]] which raises the problem that, if an [[omnipotent]] and [[omnibenevolent]] (all-powerful and perfectly loving) God exists, there should be no evil in the world. Evidence of evil in the world would make the existence of God improbable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evil/#DirIndVerEviArgEvi | title=The Problem of Evil | publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=16 September 2002 |work=substantive revision on 21 August 2009 | accessdate=17 September 2011 | author=Tooley, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theodicy attempts to demonstrate that the existence of God remains probable, despite the occurrence of evil.&lt;ref&gt;Svendsen &amp; Pierce 2010, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creation and development of humans===
According to the Irenaean tradition, humans are not created perfectly, but in a state of imperfection.&lt;ref name=S&amp;P2010&gt;Svendsen &amp; Pierce 2010, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; The theodicy teaches that creation has two stages: humans were first created in the image of God, and will then be created in the likeness of God. Humans are imperfect because the second stage is incomplete, entailing the potential, not yet actualised, for humans to reach perfection. To achieve this likeness of God, humans must be refined and developed.&lt;ref&gt;Engel, Soldan &amp; Durand 2004, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; The theodicy proposes that evil and suffering exists in the world because this is the best way for humans to develop. As such, the Irenaean theodicy is sometimes referred to as the "soul-making theodicy", a phrase taken from the poet [[John Keats]].&lt;ref name=S&amp;P2010 /&gt;

===Greatest possible world===
Typical to variations of the Irenaean theodicy is the notion that the present world is the greatest possible world, or the [[best of all possible worlds]].&lt;ref&gt;Eriksen 1998, p. 447&lt;/ref&gt; This is based on the Irenaean idea of human development, suggesting that the best possible world would be best suited to human development: a world containing evil and suffering would allow development better than one which does not, so the world is considered the best possible world.&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood &amp; Alles 2006, p. 446&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
[[File:Sistine jonah.jpg|thumb|Irenaeus used the Biblical example of Jonah as someone whose suffering brought about a greater good]]

===Irenaeus===
Second-century philosopher [[Irenaeus]] developed a theodicy based on the idea that the creation of humans is still in progress.&lt;ref name="Encountering evil"&gt;Davis 2001, pp. 40–42&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed that creation consists of two distinct parts: first in the [[image of God]], then in the likeness of God.  Irenaeus believed the first stage is complete, but the second stage requires humans to develop and grow into the likeness of God, a stage which Irenaeus believed is still in progress. He believed that, in order to achieve moral perfection, humans must be given free choice, with the actual possibility of choosing to do evil.&lt;ref name=ESD2007&gt;Engel, Soldan &amp; Durand 2007, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; Irenaeus argued that for humans to have free will, God must be at an [[epistemology|epistemic distance]] (or intellectual distance) from humans, far enough that belief in God remains a free choice.&lt;ref&gt;Davis 2001, p.41&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Irenaeus saw the purpose of the world to be the development of the moral character of humans, he believed that a good world would be best suited to that purpose. Irenaeaus believed that this world would include some suffering and evil to help people draw closer to God. He perceived God's declaration in the [[Book of Genesis]] that his creation was good to mean that the world is fit for purpose, rather than being free from suffering.&lt;ref name=ESD2007 /&gt; To illustrate the benefits of suffering, Irenaeus cited the Biblical example of [[Jonah]], from the [[Book of Jonah]]. His suffering, being swallowed by a whale, both enabled God's plan to be fulfilled and also brought Jonah closer to God: Jonah ended up repenting for his sin and the people of Nineveh turn to God.&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, Ch. ''God endured Jonah's absorption, man's long punishment.'' p. 284&lt;/ref&gt;

Irenaeus' [[Christian eschatology|eschatology]] was based on a literal interpretation of the Bible, especially the [[Book of Revelation]].&lt;ref&gt;Minns 2010, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that there would be 6000 years of suffering before the world ends in a fiery purge. This fire would purify believers ahead of a new human community existing in the [[New Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;Barber &amp; Neville 2005, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; The afterlife, Irenaeus proposed, focuses more on time than space; he looked forward to a time in which humans are fully developed and live the life of God.&lt;ref&gt;Bretherton 2011, Ch. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origen===
Early Christian theologian [[Origen]] also presented suffering as necessary for the development of human beings. Theologian Mark Scott has argued that John Hick's theodicy is more closely aligned with Origen's beliefs than Irenaeus' and ought to be called an "Origenian theodicy". Origen used two metaphors for the world: it is a school and a hospital for souls, with God as Teacher and Physician, in which suffering plays both an educative and healing role. Through an [[allegory|allegorical]] reading of [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] and the books of [[Solomon]], Origen casts human development as a progression though a series of stages which take place in this life and after death. Origen believed that all humans will eventually reach heaven as the logical conclusion of God being 'all in all'. Hell is a metaphor for the purification of our souls: our sinful nature goes to 'Hell' and our original nature, created by God, goes to heaven. Scott argues that significant aspects of Origen's theology mean that there is a stronger continuation between it and Hick's theodicy. These aspects are Origen's allegorical treatment of [[Adam and Eve]], the presentation of the world as a hospital or schoolroom, the progression he advocates of the human soul, and his universalism.&lt;ref&gt;Scott 2010, pp. 322-333&lt;/ref&gt;

===Friedrich Schleiermacher===
In the early 19th century, Friedrich Schleiermacher wrote ''Speeches'' and ''The Christian Faith'', proposing a theodicy which John Hick later identified as Irenaean in nature. Schleiermacher began his theodicy by asserting that God is omnipotent and benevolent and concluded that, because of this, "God would create flawlessly". He proposed that it would be illogical for a perfect creation to go wrong (as Augustine had suggested) and that evil must have been created by God for a good reason.&lt;ref&gt;Engel &amp; Soldan 2008, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; Schleiermacher conceived a perfect world to be one in which God's purposes can naturally be achieved, and will ultimately lead to dependence on God. He conceived sin as being an obstruction to humanity's dependence on God, arguing that it is almost inevitable, but citing Jesus as an example of a sinless man, whose consciousness of God was unobstructed.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Peters, Hewlett &amp; Russell 2008, pp. 127–128&lt;/ref&gt; This theology led Schleiermacher to [[Christian Universalism|universalism]], arguing that it is God's will for everyone to be saved and that no person could alter this.&lt;ref name=Hall2122&gt;Hall 2003, pp. 21–22&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{Quote|If we proceed on this definite assumption that all belonging to the human race are eventually taken up into loving fellowship with Christ, there is nothing for it but this single divine fore-ordination.|Friedrich Schleiermacher|The Christian Faith&lt;ref name=Hall2122 /&gt;}}

===John Hick===

[[John Wick]] published ''[[Evil and the God of Love]]'' in 1966, in which he developed a theodicy based on the work of Irenaeus. Hick distinguished between the Augustinian theodicy, based on free will, and the Irenaean theodicy, based on human development.&lt;ref name="Hall2003" /&gt; Hick framed his theodicy as an attempt to respond to the problem of evil in light of scientific development, such as Darwin's [[theory of evolution]], and as an alternative to the traditionally accepted [[Augustinian theodicy]].&lt;ref&gt;Geivett 1995, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Rejecting the idea that humans were created perfectly and then [[original sin|fell away from perfection]], Hick instead argued that humans are still in the process of creation.&lt;ref&gt;Pojman &amp; Rea 2011, p. 349&lt;/ref&gt; He interpreted the [[fall of man]], described in the [[book of Genesis]], as a mythological description of the current state of humans.&lt;ref name=IEP&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/hick/#SH3a | title=John Hick (1922– ) | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=3 November 2009 | accessdate=6 September 2011 | author=Cramer, David C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hick used Irenaeus' notion of two-stage creation and supported the belief that the second stage, being created into the likeness of God, is still in progress. He argued that to be created in the image of God means to have the potential for knowledge of and a relationship with God; this is fulfilled when creation in the likeness of God is complete. Humanity currently exists in the image of God and is being developed into spiritual maturity.&lt;ref&gt;Davis 2001, pp. 40–41&lt;/ref&gt; Hick proposed that human morality is developed through the experience of evil and argued that it is possible for humans to know God, but only if they choose to out of their own free will.&lt;ref name=IEP /&gt; Hick acknowledges that some suffering seems to serve no constructive purpose and instead just damages the individual. Hick justifies this by appealing to the concept of mystery. He argues that, if suffering was always beneficial to humans, it would be impossible for humans to develop compassion or sympathy because we would know that someone who is suffering will certainly benefit from it. However, if there is an element of mystery to suffering, to the effect that some people suffer without benefit, it allows feelings of compassion and sympathy to emerge.&lt;ref&gt;Scott 2010, p. 320&lt;/ref&gt;

The value Hick placed on free will was the result of his belief that it is necessary for genuine love: he believed that love which is not freely chosen is valueless. A genuinely loving God, he argued, would have created humans with free will. Hick held that it would be possible for God to create beings that would always freely choose to do good, but argued that a genuine relationship requires the possibility of rejection.&lt;ref&gt;Cheetham 2003, pp. 48–49&lt;/ref&gt; Irenaeus' notion of humans existing at an "epistemic distance" from God also influenced Hick, as it would ensure a free choice in belief in God.&lt;ref name=IEP /&gt; Hick argued that a world without pain or suffering would prevent moral development; such a world would have no fixed structure, or have a structure subject to divine intervention, preventing humans from coming to any harm. Hick argued that this would leave humans unable to help or harm one another, allowing them no moral choices and so preventing moral development.&lt;ref&gt;Stump 1999, pp. 222–227&lt;/ref&gt;

The nature of his theodicy required Hick to propose an [[Christian eschatology|eschatology]] in which humans are fully morally developed. He proposed a [[universalism|universalist]] theory, arguing that all humans would eventually reach heaven. Hick believed that there would be no benefit or purpose to an eternal Hell, as it would render any moral development inconsequential. The eternal suffering of Hell could not be explained in terms of human development, so Hick rejected it. Despite this, he did not reject the existence of Hell outright, as to do so could make living morally in this life irrelevant. Rather, he argued that Hell exists as a mythological concept and as a warning of the importance of this life.&lt;ref&gt;Hall 2003, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

===Richard Swinburne===
British philosopher [[Richard Swinburne]] proposed a version of the Irenaean theodicy based on his [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarian]] view of free will, a view that one's free actions are not caused by any outside agent.&lt;ref&gt;Little 2005, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that, in order for people to make free moral decisions, they must be aware of the consequences of such decisions. Knowledge of these consequences must be based on experience—Swinburne rejected the idea that God could implant such knowledge, arguing that humans would question its reliability.&lt;ref&gt;Stump 1999, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; Swinburne argued that humans must have first hand experience of natural evil in order to understand the consequences of moral evil and that for God to give humans moral free will, he must allow human suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell &amp; Wilkinson 2010, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; Swinburne conceived Hell as being a separation from God, rejecting the notion of eternal physical punishment,&lt;ref&gt;Hall 2003, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; and argued that people who had chosen to reject God throughout their lives would continue to do so after death.&lt;ref&gt;Hall 2003, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Process theology===
[[File:Dr.griffin.jpg|thumb|Process theologian David Ray Griffin contested "the utility of soul making"]]
The development of [[process theology]] has presented a challenge to the Irenaean theodicy. The doctrine proposes that God is benevolent but suggests that his power is restricted to persuasion, rather than coercion and so is unable to prevent certain evil events from occurring.&lt;ref&gt;Migliore 2004, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Process theology accepts God's indirect responsibility for evil, but maintains that he is blameless, and does everything in his power to bring about good.&lt;ref&gt;Melse 1993, pp. 13&lt;/ref&gt; In his introduction to process theology, C. Robert Melse argued that, although suffering does sometimes bring about good, not all suffering is valuable and that most does more harm than good.&lt;ref&gt;Melse 1993, pp. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Process theologian [[David Ray Griffin|David Griffin]] contested "the utility of soul making". He argued that the Irenaean theodicy supposes that God inflicts pain for his own ends, which Griffin regarded as immoral.&lt;ref&gt;Thiselton 2005, pp. 131–133&lt;/ref&gt;

===D. Z. Phillips===
[[File:Birkenau gate.JPG|thumb|D. Z. Phillips argued that the magnitude of suffering experienced in the Holocaust cannot be justified by any apparent gains]]
Philosopher [[Dewi Zephaniah Phillips]] published ''The Problem of Evil and the Problem of God'' in 2004, presenting a challenge to the Irenaean theodicy. Phillips maintained throughout his work that humans are incapable of fully understanding God, and presented an understanding of the moral diversity of human existence.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson &amp; Campbell 2010, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; With reference to the suffering of [[the Holocaust]], he rejected any theodicy which presents suffering as instrumental, arguing that such suffering cannot be justified, regardless of any good that comes of it.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson &amp; Campbell 2010, p. 183–184&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fyodor Dostoyevsky===

Russian novelist [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] presented a similar argument in his novel, ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]''. This is however not a final argument, given the nature of Dostoyevsky's work as polyphonic.  In the novel, the character Ivan Karamazov presents an account of incredible cruelty to innocent people and children to his theist brother, Alyosha. Following this, Ivan asks his brother if he would, hypothetically, choose to be the architect of the eternal happiness of mankind, which would come into existence, if, and only if he would torture an innocent child, a necessary evil, after which this eternal happiness would 
come into existence.&lt;ref&gt;Aitfield 2006, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{Quotation
|"Would you consent to be the architect under those conditions? Tell me honestly!"
&lt;br /&gt;
"No, I wouldn't agree," said Alyosha quietly.
|Fyodor Dostoyevsky
|''The Brothers Karamazov'', p. 308&lt;ref&gt;Barnhart 2550, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;}}

But Dostoyevsky's work, polyphonic in nature, also states that the love Christ showed to all people and for all people, which is Alyosha's final stance in the novel, is the only good, and in the face of evil, the beauty that will save the world.

===Michael Tooley===
Writing in the [[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], [[Michael Tooley]] rejected the Irenaean theodicy as unsatisfactory. He argued that the magnitude of suffering experienced by some people is excessive, supporting Eleanor Stump's view that the suffering endured by those with terminal illnesses cannot be for moral development, and that such illnesses do not fall more often upon those seemingly immoral or in need of development. He also challenged the suffering both of animals and of young children. Neither of these instances of suffering serve any useful purpose, as they cannot lead to moral development. Finally, he questioned whether the current universe is the best possible world for the moral development of humans. Citing the examples of those who die young and those who experience too great a pain to learn from it, as well as people who suffer too little to learn anything, he suggested that this world is not ideally suited to human development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evil/#SouMakThe | title=The Problem of Evil | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=16 September 2002 | accessdate=12 February 2012 | author=Tooley, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Henri Blocher===
French theologian [[Henri Blocher]] criticised the universalism of John Hick's theory. Blocher argued that universalism contradicts free will, which is vital to the Irenaean theodicy, because, if everyone will receive salvation, humans cannot choose to reject God. Hick did attempt to address this issue: he argued that a free action is one which reflects that character of a person, and that humans were created with a "Godward bias", so would choose salvation. Blocher proposed that Hick must then accept a level of [[determinism]], though not going all the way.&lt;ref&gt;Blocher 2005, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Julien Offray de La Mettrie''' ({{IPA-fr|ɔfʁɛ də la metʁi|lang}}; November 23, 1709&lt;ref&gt;For La Mettrie's birth in literature one finds at least three different calendar dates; the date given here is most probably the correct one. Cf.: Birgit Christensen: Ironie und Skepsis, Würzburg 1996, p. 245, fn. 2&lt;/ref&gt; – November 11, 1751) was a [[France|French]] [[physician]] and [[philosopher]], and one of the earliest of the [[French materialism|French materialists]] of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. He is best known for his work ''[[Man a Machine|L'homme machine]]'' (''Machine Man'').&lt;ref&gt;The 1748 English translation bore the title ''Man a machine'', but Ann Thomson, in her recent translation, chooses the title ''Machine Man'' (Thomson 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
La Mettrie was born at [[Saint-Malo]] in Brittany on November 23, 1709, and was the son of a prosperous textile merchant. His initial schooling took place in the colleges of Coutances and Caen. After attending the [[Collège du Plessis]] in [[Paris]], he seemed to have acquired a vocational interest in becoming a clergyman, but after studying [[theology]] in the [[Jansenism|Jansenist]] schools for some years, his interests turned away from the [[Catholic Church|Church]]. In 1725, La Mettrie entered the [[College d'Harcourt]] to study philosophy and natural science, probably graduating around 1728. At this time, D'Harcourt was pioneering the teaching of [[Cartesianism]] in France.&lt;ref name =aram&gt;Aram Vartanian, ''La Mettrie's ''L'Homme Machine'': A Study in the Origins of an Idea'' (Princeton University Press, 1960), p. 2-12&lt;/ref&gt; In 1734, he went on to study under [[Hermann Boerhaave]], a renowned physician who, similarly, had originally intended on becoming a clergyman. It was under Boerhaave that La Mettrie was influenced to try to bring changes to medical education in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nyirubugara|first=Olivier|title=A Sociobibliographic Study of L'homme machine|url=http://www.olny.nl/Research_Recherche/Media_Studies/O_Nyirubugara_SOCIOBIBLIOGRAPHIC_STUDY_HOMME_MACHINE.pdf|pages=3, 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical career==
After his studies at D'Harcourt, La Mettrie decided to take up the profession of medicine. A friend of the La Mettrie family, [[François-Joseph Hunauld]], who was about to take the chair of anatomy at the [[Jardin des Plantes|Jardin du Roi]], seems to have influenced him in this decision. For five years, La Mettrie studied at faculty of medicine in Paris, and enjoyed the mentorship of Hunauld.&lt;ref name=aram/&gt;

[[File:Herman Boerhaave - Project Gutenberg eText 15690.jpg|right|thumb|150px|In [[Leiden]], La Mettrie studied under the famous physician [[Herman Boerhaave]] (pictured above)]]

In 1733, however, he departed for [[Leiden]] to study under the famous [[Herman Boerhaave]]. His stay in Holland proved to be short but influential. In the following years, La Mettrie settled down to professional medical practice in his home region of Saint-Malo, disseminating the works and theories of Boerhaave through the publication and translation of several works. He married in 1739 but the marriage, which produced two children, proved an unhappy one. In 1742 La Mettrie left his family and travelled to Paris, where he obtained the appointment of surgeon to the [[Gardes Françaises]] regiment, taking part in several battles during the [[War of the Austrian Succession]]. This experience would instill in him a deep aversion to violence which is evident in his philosophical writings. Much of his time, however, was spent in Paris, and it is likely that during this time he made the acquaintance of [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis|Maupertuis]] and the [[Émilie du Châtelet|Marquise de Châtelet]].&lt;ref name=aram/&gt;

It was in these years, during an attack of [[fever]], that he made observations on himself with reference to the action of quickened blood circulation upon thought, which led him to the conclusion that [[mental process]]es were to be accounted for as the effects of organic changes in the brain and nervous system. This conclusion he worked out in his earliest philosophical work, the ''Histoire naturelle de l'âme'' (1745). So great was the outcry caused by its publication that La Mettrie was forced to quit his position with the French Guards, taking refuge in [[Leiden]]. There he developed his doctrines still more boldly and completely in ''[[Man a Machine|L'Homme machine]]'', a hastily written treatise based upon consistently materialistic and quasi-atheistic principles.&lt;ref name=aram/&gt; La Mettrie's materialism was in many ways the product of his medical concerns, drawing on the work of 17th-century predecessors such as the Epicurean physician [[Guillaume Lamy]].&lt;ref name=ann&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Ann|title=Machine Man and Other Writings|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ethics|ethical implications]] of these principles would later be worked out in his ''Discours sur le bonheur''; La Mettrie considered it his ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Julien Offray de La Mettrie: ''Discours sur le bonheur.'' Critical edition by John Falvey. Banbury: The Voltaire Foundation 1975. ''Introduction'' by John Falvey, p. 12: "central and culminating part of his thinking".&lt;/ref&gt; Here he developed his ''theory of remorse'', i.e. his view about the inauspicious effects of the feelings of guilt acquired at early age during the process of [[enculturation]]. This was the idea which brought him the enmity of virtually all thinkers of the [[Age of Enlightenment|French Enlightenment]], and a ''[[damnatio memoriae]]''&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen Wellman: ''La Mettrie – Medicine, Philosophy, and Enlightenment''. Durham: Duke University Press 1992, chap. 8, pp. 213-245, part. pp. 213, 220&lt;/ref&gt; which was lifted only a century later by [[Friedrich Albert Lange]] in his ''[[History of Materialism and Critique of its Present Importance|Geschichte des Materialismus]]''.

==Philosophy==
Julien de La Mettrie is considered one of the most influential determinists of the eighteenth century. Along with aiding the furthering of determinism he considered himself a [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]] [[Materialism|materialist]].

He believed that mental processes were caused by the body. He expressed these thoughts in his most important work ''Man a Machine''. There he also expressed his belief that humans worked like a machine. This theory can be considered to build off the work of [[René Descartes|Descartes]] and his approach to the human body working as a machine.&lt;ref name=king&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=D. Brett|title=A History of Psychology: Ideas and Context|year=2009|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|location=Boston|isbn=0-205-51213-5|page=169|edition=4|author2=Viney W. |author3=Woody W. }}&lt;/ref&gt; La Mettrie believed that man, body and mind, worked like a machine. Although he helped further Descartes' view of mechanization in explaining human bodily behavior, he argued against Descartes' dualistic view on the mind. His opinions were so strong that he stated that Descartes was actually a materialist in regards to the mind.&lt;ref name=greenwood&gt;{{cite book|last=Greenwood|first=John|title=A Conceptual History of Psychology|year=2009|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-07-285862-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Man and the animal===
Prior to ''Man a Machine'' he published ''The Natural History of the Soul'' in 1745. He argued that humans were just complex animals.&lt;ref name=greenwood/&gt; A great deal of controversy emerged due to his belief that "from animals to man there is no abrupt transition".&lt;ref name =offrey&gt;{{cite web|last=Offray de la Mettrie|first=Julien|title=Man a Machine|url=http://bactra.org/LaMettrie/Machine/}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later built of that idea claiming that humans and animals were composed of organized matter. He believed that humans and animals were only different in regards to the complexity that matter was organized. He compared the differences between man and animal to those of high quality pendulum clocks and watches stating: "[Man] is to the ape, and to the most intelligent animals, as the planetary pendulum of [[Christiaan Huygens|Huygens]] is to a watch of [[Julien Le Roy]]".&lt;ref name=offrey/&gt; The idea that essentially no real difference between humans and animals existed was based on his findings that sensory feelings were present in animals and plants.&lt;ref name =bren&gt;{{cite book|last=Brennan|first=James|title=History and Systems of Psychology|year=2003|publisher=Prentice Hill|location=Upper Saddle River|isbn=0-13-048119-X|page=169|edition=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he did recognize that only humans spoke a language, he thought that animals were capable of learning a language. He used apes as an example, stating that if they were trained they would be "perfect [men]".&lt;ref name=king/&gt; He further expressed his ideas that man was not very different from animals by suggesting that we learn through imitation as do animals.

His beliefs about humans and animals were based on two types of continuity. The first being weak continuity, suggesting that humans and animals are made of the same things but are organized differently. His main emphasis however was on strong continuity, the idea that the psychology and behavior between humans and animals was not all that different.

===''Man a Machine''===
La Mettrie believed that man worked like a machine due to mental thoughts depending on bodily actions. He then argued that the organization of matter at a high and complex level resulted in human thought. He did not believe in the existence of God. He rather chose to argue that the organization of humans was done to provide the best use of complex matter as possible.&lt;ref name=greenwood/&gt;

La Mettrie arrived at this belief after finding that his bodily and mental illnesses were associated with each other. After gathering enough evidence, in medical and psychological fields, he published the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Watson|first=Robert|title=The Great Psychologists|year=1968|publisher=J.B. Lippincott Company|location=Philadelphia|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the evidence La Mettrie presented was disregarded due to the nature of it. He argued that events such as a beheaded chicken running around or a recently removed heart of an animal still working proved the connection between the brain and the body. While theories did build off La Mettrie's, his works were not necessarily scientific. Rather, his writings were controversial and defiant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=Daniel|title=An Intellectual History of Psychology|year=1995|publisher=The University of Wisconsin Press|location=Madison|isbn=0-299-14840-8|page=253|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human nature===
He further expressed his radical beliefs by asserting himself as a determinist, dismissing the use of judges.&lt;ref name=king/&gt; He disagreed with Christian beliefs and emphasized the importance of going after sensual pleasure, a hedonistic approach to human behavior.&lt;ref name=bren/&gt; He further looked at human behavior by questioning the belief that humans have a higher sense of morality than animals. He noted that animals rarely tortured each other and argued that some animals were capable of some level of morality. He believed that as machines, humans would follow the law of nature and ignore their own interests for those of others.&lt;ref name=greenwood/&gt;

===Influence===
La Mettrie most directly influenced [[Pierre Jean Georges Cabanis]], a prominent French physician. He worked off La Mettrie's materialistic views but modified them to not be as extreme. La Mettrie's extreme beliefs, were rejected strongly, but his work did help influence [[psychology]], specifically [[behaviorism]]. His influence is seen in the [[Reductionism|reductionist]] approach of behavioral psychologists.&lt;ref name=bren/&gt; However, the backlash he received was so strong that many behaviorists knew very little to nothing about La Mettrie and rather built off other materialists with similar arguments.&lt;ref name=greenwood/&gt;

==Later life==

===Flight to Prussia===
[[File:Friedrich Zweite Alt.jpg|thumb|150px|right|The court of [[Frederick the Great]] provided La Mettrie with a refuge in which to write and publish his works]]
{{Hedonism}} La Mettrie's [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] and materialistic principles caused outrage even in the relatively tolerant Netherlands. So strong was the feeling against him that in 1748 he was compelled to leave for [[Berlin]], where, thanks in part to the offices of [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis|Maupertuis]], the Prussian king [[Frederick the Great]] not only allowed him to practice as a physician, but appointed him court reader. There La Mettrie wrote the ''Discours sur le bonheur'' (1748), which appalled leading [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers such as [[Voltaire]], [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]] and [[Baron d'Holbach|D'Holbach]] due to its explicitly [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] sensualist principles which prioritised the unbridled pursuit of pleasure above all other things.&lt;ref name=ann/&gt;

===Death===
La Mettrie's celebration of sensual pleasure was said to have resulted in his early death. The French ambassador to Prussia, Tirconnel, grateful to La Mettrie for curing him of an illness, held a feast in his honour. It was claimed that La Mettrie wanted to show either his power of gluttony or his strong constitution by devouring a large quantity of ''pâté de faisan aux truffes''. As a result, he developed a [[gastric illness]] of some sort. Soon after he began suffering from a severe fever and eventually died.&lt;ref name=aram/&gt;&lt;ref name=king/&gt;

[[Frederick the Great]] gave the funeral oration, which remains the major biographical source on La Mettrie's life. He declared: "La Mettrie died in the house of Milord Tirconnel, the French plenipotentiary, whom he had restored to life. It seems that the disease, knowing with whom it had to deal, was cunning enough to attack him first by the brain, in order to destroy him the more surely. A violent fever with fierce delirium came on. The invalid was obliged to have recourse to the science of his colleagues, but he failed to find the succor that his own skill had so often afforded as well to himself as to the public".[http://cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/LaMettrie/Eulogy/]" Frederick further described him as a good devil and medic but a very bad author.&lt;ref name=pag&gt;{{cite book|last=Pagden|first=Anthony|title=The Enlightenment: and why it still matters|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=019966093X|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was survived by his wife and a 5-year-old daughter.

La Mettrie's collected ''Œuvres philosophiques'' appeared after his death in several editions, published in London, Berlin and Amsterdam.

'''Latihan''' (from Indonesian ''latihan kejiwaan''; "spiritual exercise") is a form of spiritual  practice. It is the principal practice of the [[Subud]] organization.{{sfn|Webb|1995|p=268}}{{sfn|Chryssides|1999|p=262}}

==Origin==
The origin of the practice is associated with Javanese [[kebatinan|"kebatinan" or "kejawen" tradition]].{{sfn|Webb|1995|p=272}}

==The practice==
''Latihan kejiwaan'' (or simply ''latihan'') means "spiritual exercise", or "training of the spirit".{{sfn|Chryssides|1999|p=261}} This exercise is not thought about, learned or trained for; it is unique for each person and the ability to 'receive' it is passed on by being in the presence of another person who aready practises it at the 'opening'. About twice a week, Subud members go to a local center to participate in a group latihan, men and women separately.{{sfn|Webb|1995|p=269–270}} The experience takes place in a room or a hall with open space. After a period of sitting quietly, the members are typically asked to stand and relax by a 'helper', who then announces the start of the exercise.{{sfn|Chryssides|1999|p=263}}{{sfn|Webb|1995|p=270}}

Practitioners are advised to surrender to the Divine and follow 'what arises from within', not expecting anything in advance. One is recommended not to focus on any image or recite any mantra, nor to mix the exercise with other activities like meditation or use of drugs, but simply to intend to surrender to the Divine or the will of God. (The term "God" is used here with a broad and inclusive intention. An individual is at liberty to substitute interpretations that they feel more in tune with.) One is not to pay attention to others in the room, each of whom is doing his or her own latihan.{{sfn|Webb|1995|p=270}} During the exercise, practitioners may find that, in terms of physical and emotional expression, they involuntarily move, make sounds, walk around, dance, jump, skip, laugh, cry or whatever.{{sfn|Hunt|2003|p=122}}{{sfn|Chryssides|1999|p=263}} The experience varies greatly for different people, but the practitioner is always wholly conscious throughout and free to stop the exercise at any time.

Outwardly the exercise often manifests as physical movement and vocal activity that vary greatly both over time and between individuals.{{sfn|Webb|1995|p=270}} It proceeds spontaneously, involving neither teacher nor method,{{sfn|Webb|1995|p=268}} being unstructured except for basic rules relating to group practice.{{sfn|Chryssides|1999|p=263}}

Personal capacity to engage in ''latihan'' the first time, in what is called the "opening", is said to be transmitted by the presence of experienced practitioners.{{sfn|Webb|1995|p=268}} It usually entails an attitude of patience and trust, typically with some preparatory relaxation of thoughts and feelings,{{sfn|Chryssides|1999|p=152}} and involves the whole human being, not just body, emotions, mind or any other single facet.{{sfn|Geels|1997|p=148}}

It is regarded by practitioners as being of spiritual or psychological benefit, depending on personal interpretation and individual experience{{sfn|Geels|1997|p=148-160, 196-205}}{{sfn|Hunt|2003|p=122}}{{sfn|Webb|1995|p=263}} though apparently it does not affect all practitioners and may affect some detrimentally.{{sfn|Briedis|2009|p=228}}{{sfn|Geels|1997|p=150, 164}} Many practitioners see ''latihan'' as a way of direct access to a [[mystical experience]] that is compatible with a busy modern lifestyle.

===Use in Subud===
{{Main|Subud}}

While the opinions of [[Subud]]'s founder are often cited among its members,{{sfn|Webb|1995|p=270}} the organization officially endorses no doctrine regarding latihan's nature or benefits.{{sfn|Hunt|2003|p=122}} Practitioners tend to agree that the exercise is best experienced with minimal theorizing or mental imagery.{{sfn|Chryssides|1999|p=150}}

Although ''latihan'' can be practiced alone,{{sfn|Webb|1995|p=270}} [[Subud]] arranges regular practice in group settings. Normally sessions are held two or three times a week and last thirty minutes, with the two sexes segregated.{{sfn|Webb|1995|p=269-270}} Subud offers formal pragmatic, preliminary advice in relation to commencing the practice.{{sfn|Webb|1995|p=270}} Non-members are not allowed to witness Subud ''latihan'' sessions as they are considered private.{{sfn|Webb|1995|p=270}}

Subud's founder speculated that the spontaneous movements which characterise ''latihan'' are similar in character to early meetings of the [[Religious Society of Friends]] which gave rise to the name [[Quakers]].{{refn|group=note|It also resembles reports of followers of [[H. W. L. Poonja]] and [[Andrew Cohen (spiritual teacher)|Andrew Cohen]], who also report spontaneous awakening while [[Satsang|being in their presence]].}}

=== Raja Yoga ===
The use of ''latihan'' is also included by Vladimir Antonov in his program of [[Rāja yoga|raja yoga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
| url = http://autobiography.swami-center.org/yoga-and-evolution.shtml
| title = Raja Yoga and Buddhi Yoga: Their Place in the Evolution
| website = autobiography.swami-center.org
| access-date = 2016-02-26
}}&lt;/ref&gt; He states that [[Rāja yoga|raja yoga]] is a stage of spiritual work aimed at, among other things, purifying the body from coarse energies, and refining oneself as a consciousness to the level of being able to experience [[samadhi]] (the bliss of contact with God).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

| title = Raja Yoga
| website = encyclopedia-of-religion.org
| access-date = 2016-02-25
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The method of ''latihan'' consists in feeling the Holy Spirit (Te, Brahmin, etc.) above oneself as Living Light—and asking It to flow through one's body from above. By surrendering to this flow, the body can start making spontaneous movements with the arms, hands, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Latihan'' is sometimes referred to by the name 'spontaneous dance', due to the movements of the body that can happen while surrendering to the flow of light.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Latihan'' can also be classified as a meditation of the '[[Laya yoga|Laya]]' type, i.e. as a means of dissolving oneself in Living God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
| url = http://encyclopedia-of-religion.org/laya_yoga.html
| title = Laya Yoga
| website = encyclopedia-of-religion.org

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Active meditation==
The method was later adopted by [[Osho (Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh)]], who made use of many spiritual methods. He viewed ''latihan'' as potentially beneficial, capable of cleansing the mind, yet incomplete and potentially dangerous to mental health since it involved surrender of self-control.&lt;ref name="oshosearch.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oshosearch.net/Convert/Articles_Osho/Sermons_in_Stones/Osho-Sermons-in-Stones-00000021.html|title=Osho Sermons in Stones: This too will pass...|website=oshosearch.net|accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He therefore incorporated it as a stage of longer "active meditations", advocating the maintenance of a "witnessing consciousness", following ''latihan'' with a period of complete rest and preceding it with one of several techniques intended to promote an [[Autohypnosis|autohypnotic trance]], and further recommended that, when practising in groups, both sexes should practise together.&lt;ref name="oshosearch.net"/&gt; Preliminary methods used include listening to quiet music,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oshoteachings.com/osho-devavani-meditation-osho-devavani-active-meditation/&lt;/ref&gt; or else a breathing exercise intended to increase blood [[carbon dioxide]] levels followed by fifteen minutes looking at a [[strobe]] light while listening to music, both of these running at seven times the rate of the heart-beat in order to create an [[Brainwave entrainment|entrainment]] to [[alpha wave]] brain-state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oshoteachings.com/osho-active-meditations-osho-gourishankar-meditation/|title=Site Unavailable|website=oshoteachings.com|accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may also be followed by a form of wordless prayer. He agreed that it was easiest to learn in the presence of someone already experienced in the method.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.messagefrommasters.com/Psychic-World/osho_latihan_mahamudra.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mioara Mugur-Schächter''' is a French physicist of [[Romanians|Romanian]] origin, a specialist in [[quantum physics]] and [[epistemology]].

==Biography==

Born in Romania, she arrived in France in 1962 from [[Bucharest]]. Her PhD thesis - of which the whole content had been elaborated beforehand in Bucharest and sent to [[Louis de Broglie]] - contains the first and very elaborated invalidation of von Neumann's famous proof asserting the impossibility of hidden parameters compatible with the quantum mechanical formalism. This work was published in a volume prefaced by [[Louis de Broglie]] and published in the collection "Les grands problèmes des sciences", Gauthiers Villars, Paris, 1964.Since that time, a professor of theoretical physics in France

== Works ==
:•	The mentioned invalidation has been incorporated to a Ph.D. thesis directed by Louis de Broglie and published by Gauthier Villars in 1964 (two years before Bell’s invalidation), in a small book prefaced by Louis de Broglie, titled ''Étude du caractère complet de la théorie quantique''.
:•	She has invalidated the proof of Wigner’s theorem on the impossibility of a joint probability of position and momentum compatible with the formalism of quantum mechanics (The quantum mechanical one-system formalism, joint probabilities and locality, in Quantum Mechanics a half Century Later, J. L. Lopes and M. Paty, eds., Reidel, pp. 107-146, 1977 ; Study of Wigner’s Theorem on Joint Probabilities, Found. Phys., Vol. 9, pp. 389-404, 1979).
:•	She has constructed an opacity functional of a statistic, with respect to the acting probability law.  This functional constitutes a mathematical unification between the theory of probabilities and Shannon’s theory of communication of information (Le concept nouveau de fonctionnelle d’opacité d’une statistique. Etude des relations entre la loi des grands nombres, l’entropie informationnelle et l’entropie statistique, Anns. de l’Inst. H. Poincaré, Section A, vol XXXII, no. 1, pp. 33-71, 1980; The Probabilistic-Informational Concept of an Opacity Functional, (en collab. Avec N. Hadjissavas), Kybernetes, pp.189-193, Vol. 11(3), 1982).
:•	She has explicated the specific structure of the quantum mechanical probabilities and of the logic of the quantum mechanical events (of which she contested a lattice structure) (Toward a Factually induced Spacetime Quantum Logic, Found. of  Phys., Vol. 22, No. 7, pp. 963-994, 1992; Quantum Probabilities, Komogorov probabilities, and Informational Probabilities, Int. J. Theor. Phys., Vol. 33, No.1, pp. 53-90, 1994).
:•	Since 1982 she has never stopped developing a Method of Relativized Conceptualization Objectivity and Descriptional Relativities, Foundations of Science 7, pp. 73-180, 2002 (;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mugur-schachter.net/docsupload/publications/publications_doc5.pdf Objectivity and Descriptional Relativities, Foundations of Science 7, pp. 73-180, 2002]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Quantum Mechanics versus a Method of Relativized Conceptualization, in Quantum Mechanics, Mathematics, Cognition and Action, Proposals for a Formalized Epistemology, M. Mugur-Schächter and Alwyn Van Der Merwe eds., Kluwer Academic, 2002, pp. 109-307;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mugur-schachter.net/docsupload/publications/publications_doc6a.pdf Quantum Mechanics versus a Method of Relativized Conceptualization, in Quantum Mechanics, Mathematics, Cognition and Action, Proposals for a Formalized Epistemology, M. Mugur-Schächter and Alwyn Van Der Merwe eds., Kluwer Academic, 2002, pp. 109-307]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sur le tissage des connaissances, Hermès Science Publishing – Lavoisier, 2006, 316 pages, that has now become a genuine scientific "formalized epistemology"). According to the editor of "Automates intelligents" Jean-Paul Baquiast, this work embodies «a revolution in the way of representing the processes by which we acquire knowledge, and consequently, in the way of representing  “reality” (or the “object-entities-of knowledge”)».

According to the terms of Mugur-Schächter, this method is "a new discipline: a representation of the process of conceptualization rooted directly into the a-conceptual physical reality – far beneath languages – and the character of which is resolutely methodological and formalizing. The whole qualitative essence of the descriptions of microstates, wherefrom nowadays microphysics draws its remarkable powers, is incorporated in this method. Inside the framework of this method, the processes of conceptualization are represented by qualitative constructive algorithms, which exclude a priori any vagueness and illusory problems".

The method of Relativized Conceptualization (as it is best exposed in ''Sur le tissage des connaissance'') leads to a unification between the MRC-(genetic and relativized) logic and the MRC concept of (genetic relativized) probabilities.

The method furthermore leads to an algorithm for constructing a relativized concept of a factual probability law (Mathematical Structures in Computer Science /June 2014 - Volume 24, Special Issue 03, Developments of the Concepts of Randomness, Statistic and Probability, Mioara Mugur-Schächter invited editor, Preface, article ''On the Concept of Probability'', organizer of a common final debate). 
The general method of relativized conceptualization also elucidates where and how meaning is involved inside Shannon’s theory of communication of information ( &lt;ref&gt;Sur le tissage des connaissances chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt;). And it allows yields a definition of relativized mathematical measures of complexity that preserve the involved semantic contents ( chapter 8).

The infra-quantum mechanics  [[arXiv:0903.4976v3]] (in French) offers a strictly qualitative description of microstates constructed quite independently of the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics,  under – exclusively – the constraints imposed by: '''(a)''' the cognitive situation in which is placed a human being who wants to create knowledge concerning non-perceivable “microstates”, and '''(b)''' the general requirements of the human ways of conceptualizing. Those who know the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics can clearly discern the general features of the quantum mechanical algorithms inside the qualitative descriptional structure obtained in the above-mentioned way. But they will also discern features that are occulted by these algorithms, even though they are endowed with major semantic importance. 
The epistemological/operational/methodological discipline called infra-quantum mechanics offers from now on ''a reference structure'' for a face-à-face with the quantum mechanical formalism, that is elaborated outside this formalism and permits to dissolve in one single block, in a mutually coherent way, -----all the problems of “interpretation” raised by the formalism since nearly 80 years.

The work titled "Principles of a 2nd Quantum Mechanics ([[arXiv:1310.1728]] still in French only) effectively realizes the above-mentioned face-à-face. (''A thoroughly improved version containing a long abstract in English is now available on http://www.mugur-schachter.net/'' and http://www.admiroutes.asso.fr/larevue/2014/149/mq2.htm).

PRINCIPLES OF A SECOND QUANTUM MECHANICS rooted in factuality via computational assistance : [[arxiv:1506.00431v3|arXiv:1506.00431]], a very concise and notably improved English reformulation of all the preceding versions.

This new version of QM2 suggests the possibility of a quite general way of constructing for any physical entity consensual and verifiable scientific probabilistic descriptions mathematically representable in a conveniently chosen Hilbert space.

'''Mohamed Habib Marzouki''' ({{lang-ar|محمد الحبيب المرزوقي}}; born 29 March 1947) is a Tunisian academic, philosopher and politician. He was a member of the [[Constituent Assembly of Tunisia|Constituent Assembly]] from 22 November 2011 to 6 March 2013.

==Early life and education ==
He was born in [[Ferryville, French Protectorate of Tunisia]]. The thirteenth in a family of fifteen children, he obtained a philosophy degree at the [[Sorbonne University]] in 1972. He taught at the [[University of Tunis]] between 1980 and 2006 and at the International Islamic University of Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ville-tunisie.com/tunisie/%20international%20l%E2%80%99agence.html?start=60|title=International L’agence|publisher=Ville-tunisie.com|accessdate=3 May 2015|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
He was elected to the [[Constituent Assembly of Tunisia|Constituent Assembly]] as a representative of the Islamist party [[Ennahda]] for the district of Tunis on 23 October 2011, and was subsequently appointed advisor to the Culture and the Education minister. He later resigned from the assembly on 6 March 2013, and returned to the teaching of philosophy. He also translated several philosophical works to Arabic, including texts by [[Pierre Duhem]], [[Gaston Bachelard]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.la-croix.com/Actualite/Monde/Abou-Yaareb-Marzouki-l-islamiste-moderne-tunisien-2013-10-23-1049739|title=Abou Yaareb Marzouki, l’" islamiste moderne " tunisien|publisher=''La Croix''|date=23 October 2013|accessdate=3 May 2015|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
His best known work, the "Lament of a Royal Concubine" or "The Complaints of the Royal Harem" ([[Cung Oán Ngâm Khúc]]), is an example of ''[[Song That Luc Bat|song thất lục bát]]'' ("double seven, six eight") form of [[nôm]] poetry in the ''ngâm'' "lament" style.&lt;ref&gt;Mark W. McLeod, Thi Dieu Nguyen –  Culture and Customs of Vietnam – Page 70 2001 "Another famous ''nom'' poem employing the ''ngam'' style is Cung Oan Ngam Khuc, or the Lament of a Royal Concubine, by Nguyen Gia Thieu (c. 1741— 1798). Nguyen Gia Thieu was an aristocrat related to the Trinh lords. He showed little inclination for officeholding, resigning a command in 1783 and retiring to his lakeside villa in [[Hanoi|Đông Kinh]]".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norman G. Owen ''The Emergence Of Modern Southeast Asia: A New History'' 2005- Page 69 "In the masterpiece of lyric poetry by Nguyen Gia Thieu (1741-1798) "The Complaints of the Royal Harem," the rejected harem women – whom Thieu depicts as accomplished artists and chess players – are surrogates for politically frustrated "&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3891">In [[law]], '''nonacquiescence''' is the intentional failure by one branch of the government to comply with the decision of another to some degree.  It tends to arise only in governments that feature a strong [[separation of powers]], such as in the [[United States]], and is much rarer in governments where such powers are partly or wholly fused.  In the context of [[lawsuit]]s, [[executive branch|executive]] nonacquiescence in [[judiciary|judicial]] decisions can lead to bizarre [[Kafkaesque]] situations where parties discover to their chagrin that their legal victory over the government is an empty one.{{fact|date=March 2014}}{{POV-inline|date=March 2014}} Nonacquiescence can also possibly lead to a [[constitutional crisis]], given certain critical situations and decisions.

In the [[United States]], certain [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] agencies are notorious for practicing nonacquiescence (essentially, ignoring court decisions that go against them and refusing to accept their validity as [[binding precedent]]).&lt;ref&gt;Gregory C. Sisk, ''Litigation with the Federal Government'' (Philadelphia: American Law Institute, 2006), 418-425.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Hume, ''How Courts Impact Federal Administrative Behavior'' (New York: Routledge, 2009), 92-106.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1017/CBO9780511493782.004 |chapter=Studying bureaucratic implementation of judicial policies in the United States: conceptual and methodological approaches |title=Judicial Review and Bureaucratic Impact |year=2004 |last1=Canon |first1=Bradley C. |editor1-last=Hertogh |editor1-first=Marc |editor2-last=Halliday |editor2-first=Simon |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-511-49378-2 |pages=76–100}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Social Security Administration]] and the [[Internal Revenue Service]] are particularly well known for such conduct.&lt;ref&gt;The SSA publishes [http://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/rulings/ Acquiescence Rulings] and the IRS publishes [https://www.irs.gov/app/picklist/list/actionsOnDecisions.html Actions on Decisions], in which they state whether they will obey a particular court decision or not.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although executive nonacquiescence has been heavily criticized by the federal courts,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''Hutchison v. Chater'', 99 F.3d 286, 287-88 (8th Cir. 1996); ''Johnson v. U.S. Railroad Retirement Board'', 969 F.2d 1082 (D.C. Cir. 1992); ''Allegheny General Hospital v. NLRB'', 608 F.2d 965 (3d Cir. 1979); and ''Lopez v. Heckler'', 713 F.2d 1432 (9th Cir.), rev'd on other grounds sub nomine ''Heckler v. Lopez'', 463 U.S. 1328 (1983).&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[American Bar Association]],&lt;ref&gt;Rhonda McMillion, "A Little Compliance Can't Hurt," ''[[ABA Journal]]'', August 1997, 96.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] has not yet been able to pass a [[bill (proposed law)|bill]] formally prohibiting or punishing such behavior.{{POV-inline|date=March 2014}}

The [[United States|U.S.]] [[Internal Revenue Service | Internal Revenue Service (IRS)]] uses the term ''nonacquiescence'' in its actions on decision to indicate that the IRS disagrees with a court ruling and will not follow its precedent nationwide.&lt;ref name="irs36"&gt;{{cite web|title=Internal Revenue Manual, 36.3.1.4|url=https://www.irs.gov/irm/part36/irm_36-003-001.html#d0e157|publisher=Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Dept of Treasury|accessdate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This does not necessarily mean that the IRS will refuse to follow the ruling of the court on that particular case; rather it means that the IRS will not apply the ruling to ''other'' cases.  In some cases of nonacquiesence, the IRS may follow the decision's precedent within the jurisdiction of the case in question, but not apply it in other jurisdictions.&lt;ref name="irs36"/&gt;

'''Physitheism''' is the worship of nature and the assignment of gods to natural phenomena, or the attribution of physical form to gods and religious beings.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/physitheism&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monotheism==
A vestige of physitheism is apparent in certain passages of the [[Hebrew Bible]] such as [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 33:23 where God tells [[Moses]], "And I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen."

God is also described in a manner similar to a physical person in Genesis 3:8, "And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden."

Such apparently physitheistic verses are a matter of controversy; the early followers of [[Gnosticism]] considered them evidence that the Judeo-Christian god was in fact an imperfect [[demiurge]], wholly separate from the higher, transcendental God.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

'''Raimo Tuomela''' (born October 9, 1940 in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]]) is a [[Finns|Finnish]] [[philosopher]]. Tuomela received his first degree of [[doctor of philosophy]] in 1968 from the [[University of Helsinki]] and the second one in 1969 from [[Stanford University]]. Tuomela has been full [[professor]] of [[philosophy]] (especially methodology and philosophy of the [[social sciences]]) at the Department of Philosophy, [[University of Helsinki]] since 1971.&lt;ref name=Tuoela1 &gt;{{cite web|title=Raimo Tuomela|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/tint/tuomela/|website=www.helsinki.fi|accessdate=2017-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having earlier worked and published in many fields of philosophy, especially [[philosophy of science]] and [[philosophy of action]], the theory of [[social action]] has been his main research interest.

Tuomela has received several grants and awards, including the [[Alexander von Humboldt Foundation]] Research Award (''Forschungspreis''), awarded in recognition of achievements in research.

During the five-year period 1995–2000, Tuomela was Academy Professor at the [[Academy of Finland]]. This research professorship also included a research group working within the general field of the philosophy of social action.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8791">'''Samuel Danforth''' (1626–1674) was a [[Puritan]] minister, preacher, poet, and astronomer, the second pastor of [[The First Church in Roxbury]] and an associate of the Rev. [[John Eliot (missionary)|John Eliot]] of [[Roxbury, Massachusetts]], known as the “Apostle to the Indians.”
[[File:1647Almanack.jpg|thumb|250px| Danforth's 1647 Almanack, title page]]
He was born October 17, 1626, in [[Framlingham]], [[Suffolk]], [[England]], the sixth of seven children of Nicholas Danforth (1589–1639) and Elizabeth Symmes Danforth (c.1596–1629). Six surviving children— Elizabeth (1619–1673), Anna (1622–1704), Thomas (1623–1699), Lydia (1625–1686), Samuel, and Jonathan (1628–1712) —emigrated with their father to [[Massachusetts]] in 1634. After their father died in 1639, Samuel lived with [[Thomas Shepard (minister)|Thomas Shepard]], pastor of the church in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], and later attended [[Harvard College]], where he graduated in 1643 and remained as a tutor until 1650, whereupon he became one of the five founding [[Fellow]]s of [[Harvard College|Harvard]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.harvard.edu/university-archives/using-the-collections/online-resources/charter-of-1650 ''The Harvard Charter of 1650''] ''The Charter of the President and Fellows of Harvard College, under the seal of the Colony of Massachusetts Bay, and bearing the date May 31st, A. D. 1650'', Harvard College. Accessed October 9, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Danforth's studies included astronomy, and during this time he published three almanacs (for 1647, 1648, and 1649), which are the earliest surviving American examples of the form. A fourth (for the year 1646) is also attributed to him, although the single surviving copy is missing the first several pages and any attribution. These almanacs included his own original poetry (some in the form of enigmas or word puzzles), and are among the earliest examples of secular verse published in New England. They also contained—in addition to celestial tables, tide tables, calendars, and dates of court sessions—brief chronologies of significant events in New England's history. In 1650 he became pastor at [[The First Church in Roxbury]], where Rev. John Eliot was Teaching Elder, and was ordained on September 24, 1650. In 1651, he married Mary Wilson (1633–1713), daughter of the Rev. [[John Wilson (Puritan)|John Wilson]] of [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], with whom he had twelve children in 24 years. He died November 19, 1674.

No copies of his "Catechism" (published in 1650 or 1651) are known to have survived (see Roden, ''The Cambridge Press 1638-1692''). He published [http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/libraryscience/37/ '''''An Astronomical Description of the Late Comet'''''] in 1665 (reprinted in London the following year). In 1670, he was invited to give the annual election sermon to the General Assembly, which was afterwards printed as [http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/libraryscience/35/ '''''A Brief Recognition Recognition of New-Englands Errand into the Wilderness'''''] and is regarded as one of the finest examples of the “[[jeremiad]]” form. In April 1674, he delivered what is regarded as the first published “execution sermon”:[http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/libraryscience/34 '''''The Cry of Sodom Enquired Into'''''], on the occasion of the sentencing to death by hanging of Benjamin Goad, a young man from his congregation convicted of bestiality upon being discovered in a compromised position with a lady-horse. This work was published shortly after his death.

William Sprague, in his ''Annals of the American Pulpit'' (I, 139), describes him as follows: “As a preacher, he was remarkable for sustaining all his positions by arguments from Scripture; for adhering closely to the main object before him; for a free, clear and rapid utterance; and for a depth and power of feeling which in almost every sermon manifested itself in tears. ... He was particularly watchful against the inroads of immorality among the young. He used his influence to prevent any, except persons of correct moral habits, from keeping houses of public entertainment; and when he saw from his study window any of the people of the town tippling at the tavern, he made conscience to go directly to them and administer a pointed rebuke.”

== Family ==
Three of Danforth’s children died in infancy—Samuel (aged 7 months) in 1653, Thomas (aged 10 days) in 1672, and Elizabeth (aged 2 weeks) in 1673). Three others—Mary (aged 5 years), Elizabeth (aged 3), and Sarah (aged 1)—died in December 1659. His funeral remarks on this occasion were reprinted by [[Cotton Mather]] in his ''[[Magnalia]]''. Two more children—Elizabeth (aged 7) and Sarah (aged 2)—died in October 1672. His son John (1660–1730) graduated from Harvard College in 1677 and was minister at [[Dorchester, Massachusetts|Dorchester]] from 1682 until his death. The other surviving son, Samuel (1666–1727), graduated from Harvard College in 1683, and served as the minister at [[Taunton, Massachusetts|Taunton]] from 1687 until his death. Daughter Mary (1663–1734) married Edward Bromfield (1649–1734) in 1683. Daughter Abiel, born two months after her father’s death, married Thomas Fitch in 1694, and, after his death, John Osborn in 1741; she died in or before 1745.

His widow Mary was married in 1682 to Joseph Rock of Boston, who died the next year.

His older brother [[Thomas Danforth]] (1623–1699) was treasurer of Harvard College, deputy governor, and justice of the colony’s superior court. His younger brother Jonathan was a resident and founder of [[Billerica, Massachusetts]]. Sister Elizabeth married Andrew Belcher (1639–1673) of Cambridge; sister Anna married Matthew Bridge (1615–1700) of [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington]]; sister Lydia married William Beamont (1608–1698) of [[Saybrook, Connecticut]]; and sister Mary Danforth, who also came over to the Americas with Samuel, married John Parish.

'''Sandra Dingli''' (born 1952) is a Maltese [[philosopher]] mostly specialised in [[Creative Thinking]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Montebello, ''Malta's Philosophy &amp; Philosophers'', PIN Publications, Malta, 2001, pp. 156-159.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Dingli was born at [[Paceville]], [[Malta]], in 1952. She started attending [[philosophy]] and [[language]] courses at the [[University of Malta]], and later proceeding to graduate courses at the same university.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30504">'''Scriptural Reasoning''' ("SR") is one type of interdisciplinary, [[interfaith]] scriptural reading. It is an evolving practice in which [[Christians]], [[Jews]], [[Muslims]], and sometimes members of other faiths, meet to study their sacred scriptures together, and to explore the ways in which such study can help them understand and respond to particular contemporary issues. Originally developed by theologians and religious philosophers as a means of fostering post-critical and [[narrative theology|postliberal]] corrections to patterns of [[modernity|modern]] reasoning, it has now spread beyond academic circles.

== Method ==

Scriptural Reasoning involves participants from multiple religious traditions&lt;ref&gt;It is most commonly described as involving Jews, Christians and Muslims ({{Harvnb |Ford|2006}}; {{Harvnb |Mudge|2008| p=33}}; {{Harvnb |Campbell|2001}}; {{Harvnb |Gaylord|2006| p=327}}; {{Harvnb |Burrell|2006| p=708}}; {{Harvnb |Clooney|2008| p=28}}; and {{Harvnb |Hauerwas|2008| loc=p.19, n.43}}); for the inclusion of Hindus, see {{Harvnb |Heim|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; meeting, very often in small groups, to read and discuss passages from their sacred texts (e.g., [[Tanakh]], the [[New Testament]], and the [[Qur'an]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Mudge|2008| pp=33, 123}}; {{Harvnb |Clooney|2008| p=28}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The texts will often relate to a common topic - say, the figure of [[Abraham]], or consideration of legal and moral issues of property-holding.&lt;ref&gt;For the thematic nature of many SR discussions, see {{Harvnb |Mudge|2008| p=123}}; for collections of themed essays emerging from such discussions, see issues of the [http://etext.virginia.edu/journals/ssr/ ''Journal of Scriptural Reasoning''].&lt;/ref&gt; Participants discuss the content of the texts, and will often explore the variety of ways in which their religious communities have worked with them and continue to work with them, and the ways in which those texts might shape their understanding of and engagement with a range of contemporary issues.&lt;ref&gt;For SR’s engagement with contemporary issues, see {{Harvnb |Mudge|2008| p=124}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A participant from any one religious tradition might therefore:

* Discuss with the other participants his or her own readings of the texts from his or her own tradition
* Discuss with them ''their'' attempts to make sense of the texts from his or her own tradition, and
* In turn discuss with them the texts from their own traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Higton|2008}} provides a transcript and analysis of an SR group's conversation about a particular Qur'anic passage; for more general descriptions of SR, see {{Harvnb |Adams|2006| pp=240–244}}; {{Harvnb |Bailey|2006}} and {{Harvnb |Ford|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scriptural Reasoning has sometimes been described as a "tent of meeting" - a Biblical ''mishkan'' (Heb. משׁכן Ara. مسكن) - a reference to the story of Genesis 18. Steven Kepnes, a Jewish philosopher, writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Participants in SR practice come to it as both representatives of academic institutions and particular "houses" (churches, mosques, synagogues) of worship. SR meets, however, outside of these institutions and houses in special times and in separate spaces that are likened to Biblical "tents of meeting". Practitioners come together in these tents of meeting to read and reason with scriptures. They then return to their academic and religious institutions and to the world with renewed energy and wisdom for these institutions and the world.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvnb |Kepnes|2006| p=368}}. Note that Kepnes’ handbook is pointed to by various third party sources as an appropriate description of SR. See, for example, {{Harvnb |Anglican Communion Network for Inter Faith Concerns (NIFCON)|2008| p=6}} and {{Harvnb |Clooney|2008| p=252}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Purpose ==

As originally conceived, SR was an academic practice involving theologians, religious philosophers, and text scholars, and was said to be aimed at 'repairing' or 'correcting' patterns of modern philosophical and theological reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Mudge|2008}}; {{Harvnb |Lamberth|2008| pp=460–461}}; {{Harvnb |Campbell|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, it was seen not only as a form of [[interfaith|interfaith dialogue]], but also as a form of philosophical or theological reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Smith|2008| pp=469–472}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It has often been described as a 'postliberal' or 'postcritical' theological or philosophical movement.&lt;ref&gt;For 'postliberal', see {{Harvnb |Pecknold|2006| p=339}}; {{Harvnb |Smith|2008| pp=469–472}} or {{Harvnb |Heim|2004}}; for 'postcritical', see {{Harvnb |Soulen|Soulen|2001| p=140}}; {{Harvnb |Mudge|2008}}; {{Harvnb |Lamberth|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Its purpose is sometimes described more simply as that of promoting the growth of 'wisdom',&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Torrance|2009| p=128}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or, more simply still, as 'humbling and creative' interfaith encounter&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Anglican Communion Network for Inter Faith Concerns (NIFCON)|2008| p=6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or 'deeper mutual understanding'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Clooney, 2008: p.28.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basic features ==

Most forms of SR exhibit the following basic features:

* SR does not ask participants from different faith traditions to focus upon areas in which they are most nearly in agreement, or to bracket their commitments to the deepest sources of their traditions' distinct identities. SR allows participants to remain faithful to the deepest identity-forming practices and allegiances of their religious communities.&lt;ref&gt;See the section of {{Harvnb |Ford|2006 }} on 'Core Identities in Conversation'.&lt;/ref&gt;
* SR provides a context in which the participants can discuss those commitments, and perhaps even become more self-aware about them. SR sessions therefore often highlight and explore differences and disagreements between religious tradition, and give rise to serious argument - in order to promote what has been called 'better quality disagreement'.&lt;ref&gt;"Unlike some other kinds of interfaith dialogue, we aim not to pretend a consensus between our often divergent religious teachings and practices, but rather we seek to understand our disagreements more deeply through scripture study - and build friendships out of that better quality disagreement." {{Harvnb |Scriptural Reasoning Society|n.d.}}. Cf {{Harvnb |Kepnes|2006| p=368}} - 'SR is about serious conversation between three religious traditions that preserves difference as it establishes relations.'&lt;/ref&gt;
* SR does not assume any consensus between the participants as to how they understand the nature, authority or proper interpretation of the texts in front of them. Participants do not have to assume, for instance, that the Bible fulfills the same role for Christians as does the Qur'an for Muslims or the Tanakh for Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Batnitzky|2008| p=484}}: ‘I do not mean to suggest that Ochs' view of scriptural reasoning requires a shared theology as a prerequisite for dialogue.’ David F. Ford gives the following maxim for SR: 'Acknowledge the sacredness of the others' scriptures to them (without having to acknowledge its authority for oneself) - each believes ''in different ways'' (which can be discussed) that their scripture is in some sense from God and that the group is interpreting it before God, in God’s presence.' {{Harvnb |Ford|2006| p=349}}, emphasis added.)&lt;/ref&gt;
* SR is said to rely upon the existence of honesty, openness and trust amongst the participants, and more generally upon the growth of friendship among the participants in order to provide an appropriate context for disagreement. It is therefore sometimes said that the key to SR is 'not consensus but friendship'.&lt;ref&gt;The phrase is coined in {{Harvnb |Adams|2006| p=243}}; for other examples of its use see {{Harvnb |Scriptural Reasoning Society|2007}} and {{Harvnb |Abernethy|2007}}. It builds on earlier claims such as that of {{Harvnb |Kepnes|2006| p=367}} that SR 'builds sociality among its practitioners'. Cf the claim in {{Harvnb |Society for Scriptural Reasoning|2006}}: 'After about three sessions of this kind, a successful group should begin to nurture a sense of friendship in study and an emergent sense of direction'. For a third-party description of the importance of friendship in SR, see {{Harvnb |Torrance|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In order to encourage these relationships, the practice of Scriptural Reasoning is often located geographically with a view to engendering mutual hospitality - for example, by meeting in neutral academic spaces such as universities, or by peripatetically rotating between the houses of worship of different faiths. SR groups try to preserve an ethos of ''mutual'' hospitality with each participant being both host and guest, and to ensure parity of leadership, oversight or ownership.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvnb |Scriptural Reasoning Society|2007| p=2}}: 'It may be appropriate for meetings of a Member Scriptural Reasoning Group to take place in rotation between different venues associated with different faiths, or for meetings to be hosted at a neutral venue such as a secular university or community centre.'&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The term "Scriptural Reasoning" was coined by [[Peter W. Ochs|Peter Ochs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Mudge|2008| p=123}}; {{Harvnb |Hauerwas|2008| p=19 n.43}}. Note that the phrase can also be found in some other contexts – sometimes in apparent dependence upon SR usage, as in {{Harvnb |Campbell|2006| p=60}}; '"scriptural reasoning" for Paul is necessarily a social and communal activity rather than being purely individual and personal.' Note that Campbell had already written on SR before using the term this way: {{Harvnb |Campbell| 2001}}. Other uses, like that of {{Harvnb |Donnelly|2009}}, seem to be unconnected to SR.&lt;/ref&gt; to name a group who now form the Society for Scriptural Reasoning (SSR)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Ford|2007| p=278}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The founders of this international group, formed in 1995, include Ochs himself, [[David F. Ford]] and [[Daniel W. Hardy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Ochs|2006| p=147 n.3}}; {{Harvnb |Torrance|2009| p=128}}; {{Harvnb |Afzaal|1998| pp=3–5}} describes the importance of Basit Koshul in the extension of this practice to Muslims.&lt;/ref&gt; Its origins lie in a related practice, "Textual Reasoning" ("TR"),&lt;ref&gt;See [http://etext.virginia.edu/journals/tr/ The Journal of Textual Reasoning]&lt;/ref&gt; which involved Jewish philosophers reading Talmud in conversation with scholars of rabbinics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Ochs|2006| p=147, n.4}}, {{Harvnb |Ford|2006| p=3}}: 'Scriptural reasoning had its immediate origins in "textual reasoning" among a group of academic Jewish text scholars .... on the one hand, and philosophers and theologians, on the other hand....'. Lewis S. Mudge speaks of ‘a traditional Jewish practice being opened, as an act of hospitality, to others.’ {{Harv |Mudge|2008| p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Ochs was one of the leading participants in Textual Reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Ford|2006| pp=3–4}} describes the involvement of Ochs in Textual Reasoning. The fullest description of Textual Reasoning can be found in {{Harvnb |Ochs|2002}} and {{Harvnb |Levene|2002}} (and in the rest of the book from which those essays come); for some of the ways in which TR relates to SR see {{Harvnb |Hardy|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The core practice of interfaith biblical study resembles already existing practices, such as that of the International Theology Conference at the [[Shalom Hartman Institute]] in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt |Burrell|2006| p=78}} suggests similarities between SR and Hartman Institute activity; see also the Hartman's Institute [http://www.hartman.org.il/Center_Adv/Program_View.asp?Program_Id=9 programme overview]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [http://www.scripturalreasoning.org.uk Scriptural Reasoning Society] is an independent network of SR activity in the UK, not affiliated to the international Society for Scriptural Reasoning described above.

In 2007, independent Islamic authorities in London issued a fatwa&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Fatahllah|Al-ansari|Al-Salamoni|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; advising Muslims about participation in the practice of Scriptural Reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;'...groups are now welcomed in major UK mosques - a feat achieved through a fatwah (a scholarly opinion on a matter of Islamic law) accomplished by the Society.' (i.e., the Scriptural Reasoning Society.) 'Drawing upon fundamental Islamic teaching, the fatwa lays down guidelines that enable Muslims to feel comfortable in participating in the dialogue' {{Harv |Williams|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Developments ==

Scriptural Reasoning began as an academic practice. Examples of academic SR include the Scriptural Reasoning Group of the [[American Academy of Religion]],&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvnb |Mudge|2008| p=33}}; {{Harvnb |Clooney|2008| p=28}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Scriptural Reasoning in the University group (which evolved from the Scriptural Reasoning Theory Group &lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvnb |Society for Scriptural Reasoning|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;), Scriptural Reasoning project at the Center for Theological Inquiry in Princeton,&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvnb |Gaylord|2006| p=327}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the [http://www.scripturesindialogue.org/ Scriptures in Dialogue] project founded by [[Leo Baeck College]], and the SR Oxford group of the Scriptural Reasoning Society ("Oxford School") founded by the [http://www.cmcsoxford.org.uk/ Centre for Muslim-Christian Studies], Oxford and the [http://www.interfaithalliance.org.uk/ Interfaith Alliance UK].

Scriptural Reasoning has also become a "civic practice" in the community, examples of which include the [http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/journals/abraham/cvsrg.html Central Virginia Scriptural Reasoning Group] sponsored by [[Eastern Mennonite University]], at [http://www.stethelburgas.org/sr.htm St Ethelburga's Centre for Reconciliation and Peace] at [[St Ethelburga's Bishopsgate]], the SR Camden and SR Westminster groups of the Scriptural Reasoning Society sponsored by Camden Faith Communities Partnership, [[Liberal Judaism (United Kingdom)]] and different places of worship in London.

Civic developments from Scriptural Reasoning carrying different names, include the Faith and Citizenship programme of [[London Metropolitan University]], and [http://www.3ff.org.uk/prog_t4t.htm Tools for Trialogue], a youth project of the [[Three Faiths Forum]], which develops modes of scriptural study for young people in schools and local communities.

== Criticisms ==

Theologian Adrian Thatcher has questioned whether Scriptural Reasoning flattens theological differences in the way the three traditions approach their respective Scriptures, noting especially "the paucity of references to Jesus Christ" in the essays in ''The Promise of Scriptural Reasoning'' (see, e.g., Ford and Pecknold 2006), and asking whether this "may indicate … the further erosion of Christocentric biblical interpretation."&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvnb |Thatcher|2008| pp=193–4, n.1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theologian, [[James Gustafson|James M. Gustafson]], questions the claim he believes implied by Peter Ochs' descriptions of Scriptural Reasoning that it "has not only the capacity, but also the authority to correct 'modernist reason'" – and asking whether Scriptural Reasoning has been sufficiently open to the critical discourses fostered in modernity. His claims have been responded to directly by S. Mark Heim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Gustafson|2004| pp=37–39}}; {{Harvnb |Heim|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Christina Grenholm and [[Daniel Patte]] ask whether SR "presupposes a view of Christianity as a separate nation with clear borders and set markers" and whether it lacks a "critical perspective that would reveal that there are different kinds of 'scriptural reasonings.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Grenholm|Patte|2005| pp=16 n.14}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Sesson Yūbai'''|雪村 友梅|extra=1290 - 14th day of the 1st month, 1348}} was a [[Japan]]ese [[Zen]] [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monk of the [[Rinzai]] sect.

''Seeds in the heart,'' p. 1064.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In China==
Yūbai started studying [[Linji school|Linji]] [[Ch'an]] under Chinese master [[Issan Ichinei]] in Japan and later moved to China where he studied with many other teachers. He lived in China for over twenty years (1307–1329). He was imprisoned in [[Chang'an]] during the period in which Zen Buddhists were persecuted.  Many of the poems were created during or about this period survive; and they form the basis of his reputation.&lt;ref name="kato105"&gt;Katō, Shūichi. (1997). [https://books.google.com/books?id=wUxOuD0NS5kC&amp;pg=PA105&amp;dq=Sesson+Yubai&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=Sesson%20Yubai&amp;f=false  ''A History of Japanese Literature: From the Man'yōshū to Modern Times,'' p. 105.]&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''Bingatshū,'' the collection of 242 poems includes this one:
:::I do not like praises and honours
:::Nor did I fear disdain
:::I just stayed away.
:::My mind, clear water,
:::My body bound and tied
:::For three years in Chang'an.
:::I sing what I feel in songs
:::In straight words, undecorated.&lt;ref name="kato105"/&gt;

==In Japan==
With the patronage of the [[Akamatsu clan]], Yūbai was able to become the founder of a number of provincial [[List of Buddhist temples|Buddhist temple]]-[[Monastery#Buddhist monasteries|monasteries]] in [[Japan]], including [[Hōun-ji (Kamigōri)|Hōun-ji]] and [[Hōrin-ji (Harima)|Hōrin-ji]] in [[Harima, Hyōgo]].&lt;ref name="hall600-603"&gt;Hall, John Whitney.

Prominent among Yūbai's followers were [[Akamatsu Norimura]] (1277–1350) and his son [[Akamatsu Norisuke]] (1314–1371).&lt;ref name="hall600-603"/&gt;

{{Zen Buddhism}}
'''Shoshin''' ([[wikt:初心|初心]]) is a word from [[Zen Buddhism]] meaning "'''beginner's mind.'''"  It refers to having an attitude of openness, eagerness, and lack of preconceptions when studying a subject, even when studying at an advanced level, just as a beginner would. The term is especially used in the study of [[Zen Buddhism]] and [[Japanese martial arts]].{{cn|date=May 2014}}

The phrase is also discussed in the book ''[[Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind]]'' by [[Shunryu Suzuki]], a Zen teacher. Suzuki outlines the framework behind shoshin, noting "in the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, in the expert's mind there are few."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind|first=Shunryu|last=Suzuki|year=1970|isbn=9780834800793|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Swami Sundaranand''' (born April, 1926 near Nellore, Andhra Pradesh, India) is a [[Yogi]], [[photographer]], [[author]] and [[mountaineer]] who lectures widely in [[India]] on threats to the [[Ganges River]] and the loss of [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] [[glacier]]s due to [[global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/now/shows/430/india-journal5.html|title=Gangotri: The Clicking Swami|last=Brancaccio|first=David|author2=photographs by John Siceloff |date=2008-08-01|work=NOW|publisher=PBS|accessdate=2008-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hindi.webdunia.com/regional-hindi-news/%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%9C%E0%A4%A6-%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%B2%E0%A5%80-%E0%A4%96%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A8-%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8B-%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%B8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%80-%E0%A4%AA%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%B8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0-110011900068_1.htm|date=18 July 2015|title=(Amjad Ali Khan Saraswati Award)|publisher=WebDunia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2002/20020113/spectrum/main1.htm|date=13 January 2002|title=Celestial Peaks, Divine Grandeur: The Himalayas through the lens of a sadhu|publisher=Sunday Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sundarananda was a student of the reclusive [[yoga]] master Swami [[Tapovan Maharaj]] (1889–1957), who wrote in the late 19th and early 20th centuries about yogic life in the [[Himalayas]] in the classic yoga book ''Wanderings in the Himalayas'' (Himagiri Vihar).&lt;ref&gt;Wanderings in the Himalayas, English Edition, Published by Chinmaya Publication Trust, Madras-3, 1960, translated by T.N. Kesava Pillai, M.A.&lt;/ref&gt; Sundaranand lived with Swami Tapovan in the then inaccessible area of [[Gangotri]], at the source of the [[Ganges]], which is considered one of India's most sacred places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amarujala.com/news/city/uttarkashi/Uttar-Kashi-70739-17/|title=आर्ट गैलरी-ध्यान केंद्र बनवाने में जुटे स्वामी सुंदरानंद- Amarujala|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://publicasia.in/newsDetails.php?Id=17466 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402100930/http://publicasia.in/newsDetails.php?Id=17466 |archivedate=April 2, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1948, he has lived by the Ganges in Gangotri, at 10,400 feet, in a modest hut (''kuti'') which his master Swami Tapovan Maharaj later bequeathed to him on his death in 1957.  There, Swami Sundaranand has lived in solitude and through the severest of winters without any comforts or conveniences.&lt;ref&gt;Elixir Magazine, Spring 2006, page 87&lt;/ref&gt; He has witnessed up close the gradual shrinking of the [[Gangotri Glacier]] from which the Ganges springs forth, and has chronicled his devotion to the natural beauty of the Indian Himalayas as an accomplished photographer. A museum devoted to environmental protection and spiritual guidance, containing Swami Sundaranand's Himalayan photography, is now in the planning stages. It will be located in Gangotri on the property of Sundaranand and his master.

As an ascetic, he took the brahmacharya sadhu vow over 59 years ago and daily devotes his life to rigorous meditation and other spiritual practices. He continues to be a principal advocate for the ecological preservation of the Himalayas, the Ganges and its source at Gangotri.

He has taken more than 100,000 photos, over a 50-year period, of the shrinking Gangotri glacier in the Indian Himalayas. He now travels India raising awareness of the Gangotri's rapid decline.&lt;ref name="OurPlanet"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.unep.org/pdf/ourplanet/2007/may/en/op-2007-05-en-fullversion.pdf |title=Melting Ice: A Hot Topic, Climate Change and the Crysosphere |format=pdf |journal =Our Planet:The Magazine of the United Nations Environment Programme |date=May 2007| pages=4 |accessdate=2008-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicknamed "the ''[[Sadhu]]'' Who Clicks" because of his photography, he is also a noted mountain climber, having scaled over 25 Himalayan peaks, and climbing twice with Sir [[Edmund Hillary]] and [[Tenzing Norgay]].&lt;ref name="csm"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0103/p07s02-sten.htm |title=Himalaya's receding glaciers suffer neglect &amp;#124; csmonitor.com |author=Janaki Kremmer |work=[[Christian Science Monitor]] | date=3 January 2007  |accessdate=2008-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sir Edmund Hillary paid his respects to Swami Sundaranad in the 1980s at his [[Gangotri]] hut.&lt;ref&gt;Personal Time with Swami-ji, 157 mins Film, The Center for Healing Arts&lt;/ref&gt; Of the Gangotri glacier, Swami Sundaranand says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1949, when I first saw the glacier, I felt as if all my sins were washed away and I had truly attained rebirth. But now, it is impossible to experience that Ganga of the past.&lt;ref name="csm"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Swami Sundaranand is the author of the book ''Himalaya: Through the Lens of a Sadhu'' with over 425 photographs spanning 60 years of his work.&lt;ref name="urlhimalaya-sundaranand"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.meaus.com/himalaya-sundaranand.htm |title=Book Review: HIMALAYA: THROUGH THE LENS OF A SADHU|author = B.

A lookout point and plaque have been built downriver from Gangotri and dedicated to the Swami's work and efforts.

Swami Sundaranand is the subject of a feature documentary shot at his home in Gangotri titled ''Personal Time with Swamiji''. The film was produced by [http://www.thecenterforhealingarts.com The Center for Healing Arts] and directed by [[Victor Demko]].

==Views on global warming==
Over the past six decades, Swami Sundaranand has used his combined interests to raise awareness about the Ganga. "When I first came to this region, it was one of the most beautiful part of the Himalayas," he says. "It is difficult to imagine the purity of the Ganga and the abundance of Himalayan vegetation and fauna that was prevalent then. We don't know what we have cruelly destroyed."

Swami Sundaranand has lived in Gangotri since 1948, when he became a renunciate, and arrived there from Andhra Pradesh. In his words: "A lot has changed since then. Although the air is cold here, the sun is harsh. It's becoming hotter every year. People say it is global warming. I say it is a global warning."

The pollution of Ganga in the plains has been an oft-repeated refrain, but, according to Sundaranand, a graver threat is its pollution at the source. He attributes this to the unchecked construction of hotels and ''ashrams'' in Gangotri and the dumping of waste from these locations, such as faecal matter and garbage, into the Ganga. According to him, "there are no environment lovers left here, only money lovers". Every year, while the temple town closes during the harsh winter months, unchecked construction and felling of trees is at its peak. According to the sadhu, "many bhoj trees in Bhojbasa, en route [[Gaumukh]] have been cut down. Earlier, on my treks to the Gaumukh glacier, I could spot rare animals like the snow leopard and musk deer. They are rarely visible now".

The sadhu is also an avid mountaineer — it was during his treks to the glacier over the last 10–15 years that he saw the glacier retreat more rapidly than ever before. According to him, Gaumukh was barely 1&amp;nbsp;km away from Bhojbasa, but today, it is 4&amp;nbsp;km away and that every year, the glacier was retreating by at least 10 metres. He has expreseed the view that the pollution of Ganga at its source and melting Himalayan glaciers were the real issues that environmentalists needed to urgently take up, rather than opposing the construction of dams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/sunday-times/deep-focus/The-sadhu-who-clicks/articleshow/8730692.cms|first=Atul |last=Sethi |publisher=Times of India|title=The sadhu who clicks|date=5 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Swami Sundaranand has a strong connection with the [[Himalayas]] that few others have. He has climbed dozens of its peaks, several of them over 21,000 feet above sea level, and has lectured at Tensing's Himalayan Institute (a famous mountaineering school). He is also a skilled [[naturalist]] that is familiar with thousands of Himalayan plants and he knows the lore and medicinal uses of these species.

He engages in 3 hours of meditation during the day, and may meditate at night into the early hours of the morning. The most important parts of his life are meditation, ''japa'' and ''pranayama''. As a younger man he was an accomplished ''hatha'' yogi, mastering 300 postures, and he continues to practice it daily. He is very devoted to the ecosystem in which he has lived for forty years and believes that "God does not reside in temples or mosques - he is scattered everywhere in the courtyard of nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=665|publisher=Hinduism Today|title=Swami Sundarananda, John Muir of the Himalayas|date=October 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=river /&gt;

'''''The Structure of Science: Problems in the Logic of Scientific Explanation''''' is a 1961 book about the [[philosophy of science]] by the philosopher [[Ernest Nagel]]. The book is considered a classic discussion of its subject, though its approach has been seen as outdated.

==Summary==
{{expand section|date=October 2018}}
Nagel discusses branches of science such as [[physics]].{{sfn|Nagel|1961|page=336}}

==Publication history==
''The Structure of Science'' was first published by [[Harcourt (publisher)|Harcourt, Brace &amp; World]] in 1961. It was reprinted in 1979 by [[Hackett Publishing Company]].

==Reception==
===Mainstream media===
''The Structure of Science'' received a mixed review from the philosopher [[Raziel Abelson]] in ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]''.{{sfn|Ableson|1961}} The book was also reviewed by the philosopher [[A. J. Ayer]] in ''[[Scientific American]]'' and William Gilman in ''[[The Nation]]''.{{sfn|Ayer|1961|page=197}}{{sfn|Gilman|1961|pages=503–504}}

Ableson considered the book's publication an important event in American philosophy. He credited Nagel with consolidating the rival insights of [[logical positivism]] and [[pragmatism]], demonstrating how four different kinds of explanation function in different types of inquiry, refuting the view that science does nothing more than describe "sequences of phenomena", and convincingly criticizing Berlin. However, he argued that Nagel's account of science was strained and that some of Nagel's views were unclear. He believed that Nagel was less successful in discussing sociology and history than he was in discussing the natural sciences. He also charged Nagel with vacillating between the "mechanistic" view of social knowledge and that of "pragmatic pluralism", arguing that each of these perspectives has merit, but only when adopted with full commitment.{{sfn|Ableson|1961}}

===Scientific and academic journals===
''The Structure of Science'' was reviewed by G. B. Keene in ''[[Philosophy (journal)|Philosophy]]'' and the philosopher [[Paul Feyerabend]] in the ''[[British Journal for the Philosophy of Science]]''.{{sfn|Keene|1962|pages=372–374}}{{sfn|Feyerabend|1966|pages=237–249}} The book was also discussed by Colin Klein in ''[[The Philosophical Quarterly]]'',{{sfn|Klein|2009|pages=39–53}} Grażyna Musiał in the ''Journal of Economics &amp; Management'',{{sfn|Musiał|2011|pages=73–86}} and the philosopher [[Kenneth F. Schaffner]] in ''[[The Journal of Philosophy]]''.{{sfn|Schaffner|2012|pages=516–566}}

Klein wrote that discussions of the role of reduction in scientific explanation published after the book moved away from Nagel's views, because of "perceived shortcomings in Nagel’s theory of reduction." He argued that the trend away from Nagel's views has been a mistake. In his view, while "Nagel’s account of reduction has a number of flaws" Nagel's "account of intertheoretic connection is largely correct."{{sfn|Klein|2009|pages=39–53}} Musiał wrote that the book is "a source of inspiring conclusions" and is regarded as one of the "fundamental works on the contemporary methodology of science." She added that Nagel's conception of scientific theories is "considered classical and as such, worth of detailed analysis" and that Nagel's "position left numerous opened questions that were further developed" by other authors, and concluded that Nagel's book is "still a valuable reading for junior
research workers in economics who wish to reinforce their knowledge."{{sfn|Musiał|2011|pages=73–86}} Schaffner noted that "Nagel's theory is based on the reduction of classical thermodynamics to statistical mechanics" and that criticisms of his theory "are based on the application of the reductionist mode of thinking to genetics, statistics and the concept of multiple realizability".{{sfn|Schaffner|2012|pages=516–566}}

===Evaluations in books===
The philosopher [[Adolf Grünbaum]] criticized Nagel for misinterpreting the philosopher of science [[Henri Poincaré]] in ''[[Philosophical Problems of Space and Time]]'' (1973).{{sfn|Grünbaum|1974|page=91}} The philosopher [[Douglas Hofstadter]] described Nagel's book as a classic in the philosophy of science in ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'' (1979). He praised it for Nagel's discussions of reductionism and holism and teleological and non-telological explanations.{{sfn|Hofstadter|1980|page=752}} The historian [[Peter Gay]] praised ''The Structure of Science'' as an important book and a clear exposition of positivism in ''Style in History'' (1974). He credited Nagel with refuting opposing points of view.{{sfn|Gay|1988|page=237}} Gay wrote in ''Reading Freud'' (1990) that Nagel's work is a book on which "many of us grew up", and that it "remains valuable". He noted that while Nagel was "no Freudian", the closing sentence of ''The Structure of Science'' paraphrases the famous last paragraph of [[Sigmund Freud]]'s ''[[The Future of an Illusion]]'' (1927).{{sfn|Gay|1990|page=187}}

The philosopher [[Roger Scruton]] praised Nagel's discussion of the "dispute over the nature of theories and theoretical terms" in ''Modern Philosophy: An Introduction and Survey'' (1994).{{sfn|Scruton|1997|page=535}} The philosopher [[Isaac Levi]] described ''The Structure of Science'' as a well-known classic in its field in ''[[The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy]]'' (1999).{{sfn|Levi|1999|page=595}} The philosopher [[Michael Ruse]] described ''The Structure of Science'' as Nagel's "definitive work" in ''[[The Oxford Companion to Philosophy]]'' (2005). However, he maintained that [[Thomas S. Kuhn]]'s ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1962) discredited Nagel's approach to the philosophy of science.{{sfn|Ruse|2005|page=637}}

Pogge is also an editor for social and political philosophy for the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/board.html SEP: Subject Editors]&lt;/ref&gt; and a member of the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnva.no/c26849/artikkel/vis.html?tid=40104|title=Gruppe 3: Idéfag|publisher=[[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate=16 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/macmillan/globaljustice/pogge.html Yale profile]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Pogge received his Ph.D. from Harvard University with a dissertation supervised by [[John Rawls]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://opinion.inquirer.net/79332/when-the-global-economic-order-favors-the-rich When the global economic order favors the rich]&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, he has published widely on [[Immanuel Kant]] and in moral and political philosophy, including various books on Rawls and [[global justice]].

==Major works==

===''The Health Impact Fund: Making New Medicines Accessible for All'' (2008)===
In this book, Thomas Pogge and Aidan Hollis argue in favour of establishing the [[Health Impact Fund]] (HIF).  The HIF is a new proposal for stimulating [[research and development]] of life-saving pharmaceuticals that make substantial reductions in the [[global health|global burden of disease]].

The HIF will provide pharmaceutical companies with a new choice. Pharmaceutical companies can sell a new medicine in the usual manner at [[patent]]-protected high prices, or they can choose to register their new medicine with the HIF and sell it globally at the cost of production.  If they choose to register their medicine with the HIF, the pharmaceutical company will receive additional payments from the fund that are proportionate to health improvements that are brought about by the registered medicines. The more effective the medicine is in improving global health, the bigger the payout. Because malaria kills millions, the firm that finds and develops a cure can expect a significant return.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.impactnottingham.com/2014/10/can-the-pharmaceutical-industry-cure-the-poor/ CAN THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY CURE THE POOR?]&lt;/ref&gt;

===''World Poverty and Human Rights'' (2002, 2008)===
Pogge’s ''[[World Poverty and Human Rights]]'' (2002) includes a number of original and substantial theses, the most notable being that people in wealthy Western liberal democracies (such as Western Europeans) are currently harming the world’s poor (like those in sub-Saharan Africa).  In particular, without denying that much blame should be directed at domestic kleptocrats, Pogge urges us to recognize the ways in which international institutions facilitate and exacerbate the [[corruption]] perpetuated by national institutions.  Pogge is especially critical of the “resource” and “borrowing” privileges,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Pogge, ''World Poverty and Human Rights'', 2nd ed. (Cambridge: Polity Press 2008), pp. 29-30.&lt;/ref&gt;  which allow illegitimate political leaders to sell natural resources and to borrow money in the name of the country and its people.  In Pogge’s analysis, these resource and borrowing privileges that international society extends to oppressive rulers of impoverished states play a crucial causal role in perpetuating [[absolute poverty]].  What is more, Pogge maintains that these privileges are no accident; they persist because they are in the interest of the wealthy states. [[The International Resource Privilege|The resource privilege]] helps guarantee a reliable supply of raw materials for the goods enjoyed by the members of wealthy states, and the borrowing privilege allows the financial institutions of wealthy states to issue [[usury|lucrative loans]].  It may seem that such loans are good for developing states too, but Pogge argues that, in practice, they typically work quite to the contrary:

Local elites can afford to be oppressive and corrupt, because, with foreign loans and military aid, they can stay in power even without popular support.  And they are often so oppressive and corrupt, because it is, in light of the prevailing extreme international [[social inequality|inequalities]], far more lucrative for them to cater to the interests of foreign governments and firms than to those of their impoverished compatriots.&lt;ref&gt;''World Poverty and Human Rights'', 2nd ed. 2008, p. 295, n. 238&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Realizing Rawls'' (1989)===
In ''Realizing Rawls'', Pogge defends, criticizes and extends John Rawls’s ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' (1971).  Pogge insists that Rawls has been importantly misunderstood by his most influential critics, including the [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] [[Robert Nozick]]  and the communitarian [[Michael Sandel]]. According to Pogge, Rawls’ reluctance to disagree sharply with his critics has helped these (mis)understandings to become widespread, and has also induced Rawls in his more recent work to dilute the moral statement of his central Rawlsian ideas:  first, that moral deliberation must begin from reflection upon the justice of our basic social [[institution]]s; and second, that the justice of an institutional scheme is to be assessed by how well its least advantaged participants fare.  From these starting points, Pogge develops his own specification of Rawls’s principles of justice, discussing the relative importance of different [[fundamental rights]] and liberties, the ideal constitution of the political process, and the just organization of educational, health-care, and economic institutions.  In the last part of the book, Pogge argues for extending the Rawlsian criterion of justice to the international arena,  and identifies those features of the present global order that this criterion would single out as principal targets for institutional reform.

==Other projects==

===Giving What We Can===
[[Giving What We Can]] is an international society for the promotion of poverty relief, in particular in the developing world. The aims of the organisation are to encourage people to commit to long-term donation to those charities that provide the most cost-effective poverty relief.  Giving What We Can conducts extensive research into the relative effectiveness of charities, and provides a list of those it most highly recommends. Currently this includes charities that work to treat [[neglected tropical diseases|neglected diseases]] (NTDs), [[malaria]] and [[micronutrient]] deficiency.

===Incentives for Global Health (IGH)===
IGH is a non-profit organization dedicated to developing market-based, systemic solutions to health challenges faced by the world’s poor. Its flagship proposal is the Health Impact Fund.

===Academics Stand Against Poverty (ASAP)===
[[File:2014-01-08 Thomas Pogge 4737-cropped.JPG|thumb|upright|Thomas Pogge speaking in Munich about ''Academics Stand Against Poverty'' (2014)]]
[[Academics Stand Against Poverty]] is an organization meant to help academics have a greater impact on world poverty. “The group lies between academia and activism. Like the latter, it aims primarily at persuading and motivating people to change their behavior. Like the former, it does so by moral and political argument, using the distinctive skills of academics.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/macmillan/globaljustice/ASAP.html   “Global Justice Program: Academics Stand Against Poverty,”]&lt;/ref&gt;

This project is still in its beginning stages.  It has three central aims:
# To disseminate accessible versions of arguments for taking action against world poverty to the public;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crop.org/storypg.aspx?id=296 CROP - Academics Stand Against Poverty (ASAP)]&lt;/ref&gt;
# To disseminate responses to standard objections to such arguments to the public; 
# To distribute discussion of what individuals and states in developing countries should do in response to world poverty to the public.

===Poverty and gender equality measurement===
Various indices - the [[United Nations Development Programme]]'s Human and Gender‐Related Development Indices, and the [[World Bank]]’s Poverty Index - are used to track poverty, development, and [[gender equity]] at the population level. Pogge argues that these prominent indices are deeply flawed and therefore distort our moral judgments and misguide resource allocations by governments, international agencies, and [[non-governmental organizations]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Pogge, “How ''Not'' to Count the Poor” (Sanjay Reddy and Thomas Pogge), in Sudhir Anand, Paul Segal and Joseph Stiglitz, eds.: ''Debates in the Measurement of Global Poverty'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

“This project will work toward new indices ‘of poverty and of gender equity’ applicable both at the national and supranational levels, and to smaller groups affected by specific policies and programs. Both indices will draw on a holistic measure of individual (dis)advantage that reflects all relevant aspects of a person’s situation.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://globaljustice.macmillan.yale.edu/ Global Justice Program: Poverty and Gender Equity Measurement], Yale.edu. Accessed July 28, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pogge has pursued similar themes in ''Politics as Usual: What Lies Behind the Pro-Poor Rhetoric'' (2010).&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Pogge, ''Politics as Usual: What Lies Behind the Pro-Poor Rhetoric'' (Cambridge, Polity Press, 2010) {{ISBN|9780745638935}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illicit financial flows===
This project focuses on the [[illicit financial flows]] out of developing countries, the lack of transparency in the [[global financial system]], and the impact these conditions have on human rights.  The driving idea behind this project is that “‘human rights and international financial integrity are intimately linked’” and that poverty increases when money flows out of nations illicitly instead of being invested in the basic needs of people in their countries.”&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Baker, Thomas Pogge, and Arvind Ganesan, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/raymond-baker/financial-integrity-meets_b_414740.html "Financial Integrity Meets Human Rights,"] ''[[Huffington Post]]'', March 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forced Labor and Human Trafficking===
The Forced Labor and Human Trafficking project aims “to bring public, official, and mainstream media attention to the global crisis of [[human trafficking]] and [[unfree labour|labor abuse]] towards children and adults.” The non-profit organization Art Works Projects is a contributor to this project.

==Sexual harassment allegations==

In 2010, Pogge was accused in a high-profile [[sexual harassment]] case by a recent Yale graduate student.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.buzzfeed.com/katiejmbaker/yale-ethics-professor Ethics and the Eye of the Beholder]&lt;/ref&gt; As a professor at [[Columbia University]] in the mid-1990s, Pogge had been disciplined by the school following allegations of sexual harassment.&lt;ref name = NYT&gt;Noah Remnick, [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/09/nyregion/a-yale-professor-is-cleared-of-sexual-harassment-but-concerns-linger.html "After a Professor Is Cleared of Sexual Harassment, Critics Fear 'Cultural Silence' at Yale], ''New York Times'' (July 8, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, after new allegations were made by a graduate of [[Yale University]], an internal review concluded only that Pogge had "inappropriately used Yale stationery in vouching for [the accuser's] employment."&lt;ref name = NYT /&gt; After articles appeared on several websites, hundreds of professors, including the chair of Pogge's department at Yale, signed an open letter criticizing Pogge.&lt;ref name = NYT /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fernanda Zamudio-Suaréz, [http://chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/fellow-philosophers-criticize-yale-scholar-for-alleged-sexual-harassment/112312 Fellow Philosophers Criticize Yale Scholar for Alleged Sexual Harassment], ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'', (June 20, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Rodrigues, Monica Wang and Victor Wang, [http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2016/06/20/philosophy-community-signs-open-letter-in-striking-rebuke-of-pogge/ Philosophy community signs open letter in striking rebuke of Pogge], ''[[Yale Daily News]]'' (June 20, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Pogge wrote a detailed defense.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomaspogge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Response-to-the-Allegations-by-Fernanda-Lopez-Aguilar.pdf Response to the Allegations], thomaspogge.com.

{{Modern persecutions of the Catholic Church}}
'''Titus Brandsma''' (23 February 1881 - 26 July 1942), was a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[Carmelites|Carmelite]] [[friar]], [[Catholic priest]] and professor of [[philosophy]]. Brandsma was vehemently opposed to [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[ideology]] and spoke out against it many times before the [[World War II|Second World War]].  He was imprisoned in the infamous Dachau concentration camp, where he died. He has been [[beatification|beatified]] by the Roman Catholic Church as a [[martyr]] of the faith.

==Early life==
He was born '''Anno Sjoerd Brandsma''' to Titus Brandsma (died 1920) and his wife Tjitsje Postma (died 1933) at Oegeklooster, near [[Hartwerd]], in the Province of [[Friesland]], in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rees|first=Joseph|title=Titus Brandsma: A Modern Martyr|place=London|publisher=Sidgwick and Jackson|year= 1971|pages=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents, who ran a small dairy farm, were devout and committed Catholics, a minority in a predominantly-[[Calvinist]] region. With the exception of one daughter, all of their children entered religious orders.&lt;ref name=OC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carmelnet.org/brandsma/html/biography.html|work=Carmelites Friars|title=Bl. Titus Brandsma|accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Megen panorama, kerk, latijnse school, klooster, hof van lof.JPG|thumb|left|The grounds of the Franciscan friary in [[Megen]] where Brandsma did his high school studies]]
As a young boy, Brandsma did his secondary studies in the town of [[Megen]], at a [[Franciscan]]-run [[minor seminary]] for boys considering a priestly or religious vocation.&lt;ref name=OC /&gt;

==Carmelite friar==
Brandsma entered the [[novitiate]] of the Carmelite friars in [[Boxmeer]] on 17 September 1898, where he took the [[religious name]] '''Titus''' (in honor of his father) by which he is now known. He professed his first [[Religious vows|vows]] in October 1899.&lt;ref name=OC /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Glueckert|first=Leopold G.|title=Friar Against Fascism|publisher=Carmelite Press|year=2002|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ordained a priest in 1905, Brandsma was knowledgeable in Carmelite [[Christian mysticism|mysticism]] and was awarded a [[doctorate of philosophy]] at Rome in 1909. He then taught in various schools in the Netherlands. From 1916 on, he initiated and led a project to translate the works of St. [[Teresa of Ávila]] into Dutch.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, Joseph.''Titus Brandsma: A Modern Martyr''. 49-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921 Brandsma worked to resolve a controversy concerning Belgian artist [[Albert Servaes]]' depiction of the [[Stations of the Cross]]. From this came his series of meditations on each of the 14 stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Titus|last=Brandsma|first2=Albert|last2=Servaes|title=Ecce Homo: Schouwen van de weg van liefde/Contemplating the Way of the Cross|first3=Jos, ed.|last3=Huls|place=Leuven|publisher=Peeters|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the founders of the Catholic University of Nijmegen (now [[Radboud University]]), Brandsma became a professor of philosophy and the history of mysticism at the school in 1923. He later served as ''[[rector (academic)|Rector]] Magnificus''. He was noted for his constant availability to everyone, rather than for his scholarly work as a professor.

Brandsma also worked as a journalist and was the ecclesiastical adviser to Catholic journalists by 1935. That same year he did a lecture tour of the United States, speaking at various institutions of his Order.&lt;ref name=OC /&gt;

==Imprisonment and death==
After the [[Battle of the Netherlands|invasion of the Netherlands]] by the [[Third Reich]] in May 1940, it was Brandsma's fight against the spread of Nazi ideology and for educational and press freedom that brought him to the attention of the Nazis. In January 1942 he undertook to deliver by hand a letter from the [[Bishops' Conference of the Netherlands|Conference of Dutch Bishops]] to the editors of Catholic newspapers in which the bishops ordered them not to print official Nazi documents, as was required under a new law by the German occupiers. He had visited 14 editors before being arrested on the 19th of that month at the Boxmeer monastery.&lt;ref name=OC /&gt;

After being held prisoner in [[Scheveningen]], [[Amersfoort]], and [[Cleves]], Brandsma was transferred to the [[Dachau concentration camp]], arriving there on 19 June. His health quickly gave way, and he was transferred to the camp hospital. He died on 26 July 1942, from a lethal injection administered by a nurse&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Alban. ''Butler's Lives of the Saints.'' Edited by Bernard Bangley. Paraclete Press: 2005. Record for 26th July (Feast Day).&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Allgemeine SS]], as part of their [[Nazi human experimentation|program of medical experimentation]] on the prisoners.&lt;ref name=OC /&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Nimègue, statue Titus Brandsma.JPG|thumb|upright|Statue of Titus Brandsma on the grounds of Radboud University, Nijmegen]]
Brandsma is honored as a [[martyr]] within the Roman Catholic Church. He was [[beatification|beatified]] in November 1985 by [[Pope John Paul II]]. His [[feast day]] is observed within the Carmelite Order on 27 July.

In 2005 Brandsma was chosen by the inhabitants of [[Nijmegen]] as the greatest citizen to have lived there. A memorial church now stands in the city dedicated to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.titusbrandsmamemorial.nl|work=Titus Brandsma Memorial|title=Home|accessdate=28 February 2013|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Nijmegen, Titus Brandsma Gedachteniskerk-2.jpg|The Titus Brandsma Memorial Church in Nijmegen|thumb|left|210px]]
Brandsma's studies on mysticism was the basis for the establishment in 1968 of the '''Titus Brandsma Institute''' in Nijmegen, dedicated to the study of [[spirituality]]. It is a collaboration between the Dutch Carmelite friars and [[Radboud University Nijmegen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.titusbrandsmainstituut.nl/eng_index.htm|work=Titus Brandsma Institute|title=The Institute|accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his biography of Brandsma, ''The Man behind the Myth'', Dutch journalist Ton Crijnen claims that Brandsma combined some vanity, a short tempered character, extreme energy, political simpleness, true charity, unpretentious piety, thorough decisiveness and great personal courage. His ideas were very much those of his own age and modern as well. He offset contemporary Catholicism's negative theological opinion about Judaism with a strong disaffection for any kind of [[Antisemitism]] in Hitler's Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Titus Brandsma, De man achter de mythe - de nieuwe biografie|last=Crijnen|first=Ton|publisher=Valkhof Pers|place=Nijmegen|year=2008|ISBN=978-90-5625-278-6|url=http://www.valkhofpers.nl/products.php?ISBN9789056252786|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Brandsma was honoured by the city of Dachau with a street adjoining the former camp, albeit one of the narrowest streets in the town.

'''Transactionalism''' is a philosophical approach that addresses the fundamental nature of social exchange or human transaction; that all human exchange is best understood as a set of transactions within a reciprocal and co-constitutive whole. A transactionalist demands that all human exchange, including learning,&lt;ref name="Kolb"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jpbeBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA390&amp;dq=transactionalism+zoology&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj_heb31M_UAhUX3mMKHb2wDMsQ6AEIUzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=interaction%20and%20transaction&amp;f=false|title=Experiential Learning: Experience as the Source of Learning and Development|last=Kolb|first=David A.|date=2014-12-17|publisher=FT Press|isbn=9780133892505|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; is best understood as a transactional whole shaped and defined by a set of experiences in an ecology that are all-at-once biological, socio-linguistic, and intellectual; "man is an information-processing, organizing, open-energy system."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study (paperback)|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2017-03-18|publisher=Independently published|year=|isbn=9781520829319|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=|language=English|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=99|language=English|quote=|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Attention must be paid to organizing acts within, and as-if always, a reciprocal and co-constitutive, exchange whether it be in buying and selling, teaching and learning, in a marital contract, or a social situation in-person or online.

== Definition ==
Stemming from the Latin ''transigere'' ("˜to drive through", "to accomplish"), the root word "transaction" is not restricted to the economic sense of ''buying and selling'' or merely a [[financial transaction]]. A much larger field of exchange is employed such as, "any sort of social interaction, such as verbal communication, eye contact, or touch. A 'stroke' [of one's hand] is an act of recognition of a transaction" as employed in psychology with [[transactional analysis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.disorders.org/relationships/transactional-analysis/|title=Transactional Analysis|work=Disorders.org - Find Therapists, Counselors, and Treatment Centers|access-date=2017-07-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It not only examines exchanges, or "transactions," between borrower and lender, but encompasses any transaction involving people and objects whether it involves "borrowing-lending, buying-selling, writing-reading, parent-child, and husband-wife."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|page=|pages=33|language=English|chapter=Transactionalism Viewed Historically|orig-year=1969|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [https://www.influenceecology.com/distinctionary/transaction/ transaction], then is "a creative act, engaged in by one who, by virtue of his participation in the act – of which he is always an ''aspect'', never an ''entity'' – together with the other participants, be they human or otherwise environmental, becomes [,] in the process [,] modified."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=75|language=English|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

=== The contributions of American philosopher John Dewey ===
While John Dewey is viewed by many transactionalists as a principal architect,&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Knowing and the Known|last=Dewey|first=John|last2=Bentley|first2=Arthur Fisher|date=1949-01-01|publisher=Beacon Press|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=120|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; social anthropologist [[Fredrik Barth]] was among the first to articulate the concept as it is understood in contemporary study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=12|language=English|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political scientists Karl W.

John Dewey offered a sophisticated, yet [[Pragmatism|pragmatic]] approach to understanding man as an organism-environment purposefully designed to correct the "fragmentation of experience" often found in other philosophical approaches found in [[Subjectivism]], [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]], [[Constructivism (philosophy of education)|Constructivism]] and [[Skepticism]].&lt;sup&gt;[[Talk:Transactionalism#cite note-1|[1]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

He asserted that human life is not organized into separate entities, as if the mind (emotions, feelings, creativity, imagination) and the world outside it (raw and manufactured goods as well as social roles and institutions such as family, school, and media) are irreconcilable, leading to the question "How does the mind know the world?"&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://dx.doi.org.remote.baruch.cuny.edu/10.4135/9781506335193.n4|title=Pragmatism and the Philosophical Foundations of Mixed Methods Research1|last=Biesta|first=Gert|pages=95–118|doi=10.4135/9781506335193.n4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Trevor J. Phillips]] (1927–2016), American professor emeritus in educational foundations and inquiry&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bgsu.edu/content/dam/BGSU/Retirees/documents/newsletters/May-2016.pdf|title=BGSU (Bowling Green State University) Retirees Association Newsletter, Vol. 21|last=|first=|date=May 2016|work=|access-date=2016-07-13|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Bowling Green State University]] from 1963 to 1996, wrote a comprehensive review of the historical, philosophical, psychological, and educational development of transactionalism in his 1966 dissertation "Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study" republished in 2013 by Influence Ecology.  Phillips traced transactionalism's philosophical roots to Greek historians [[Polybius]] and [[Plato]], 17th century polymath and architect of the scientific revolution Galileo, as well as the architect of modern western philosophy, [[René Descartes]].

Galileo's contributions to the scientific revolution rested on an understanding of transactionalism from which he argued Aristotelian physics was wrong, as he wrote in ''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems]]'' (1632):&lt;blockquote&gt;"In that case, if it is denied that circular motion is peculiar to celestial bodies, and affirmed to belong to all naturally movable bodies, then one must choose one of two necessary consequences. Either the attributes of generable-ingenerable, alterable-inalterable, divisibleindivisible, etc., suit equally and commonly all world bodies – as much the celestial as the elemental – or Aristotle has wrongly and erroneously deduced, from circular motion, those attributes which he has assigned to celestial bodies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.webexhibits.org/calendars/year-text-Galileo.html|title=Galileo Galilei {{!}} Calendars|website=www.webexhibits.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The philosophy abandons self-actional and interaction-al beliefs or suppositions as problem-solving in an objective world where co-operative exchange creates value in learning,&lt;ref name="Kolb"/&gt; and the foundation of transactional competence, how objects including people behave.  Galileo deviated from the then current Aristotelian thinking, which was defined by mere interactions rather than co-constituetive transacting among people with different interests who may be solving competing intentions or conditions of life.

=== Modern antecedents ===
Trevor Phillips also outlined the philosophy's more recent developments found in the American philosophical works of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], sociologist [[George Herbert Mead]] ([[symbolic interactionism]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|edition=2|location=|pages=54|language=English|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; pragmatist [[William James]], educational philosopher [[John Dewey]],&lt;ref name="Pronko 229–254"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pronko|first=N.

Bentley|Arthur Bentley]].

Several sources credit anthropologist [[Fredrik Barth]] as the scholar first to apply the term 'transactionalism" in 1959.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.anthrobase.com/Dic/eng/pers/barth_fredrik.htm|title=Barth, Fredrik - AnthroBase - Dictionary of Anthropology: A searchable database of anthropological texts|website=www.anthrobase.com|access-date=2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781444332094_chunk_g978144433209423_ss1-50|title=Transactionalism or Transactional Analysis : Concise Dictionary of Social and Cultural Anthropology : Blackwell Reference Online|last=|first=|date=|website=www.blackwellreference.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a critique of structural functionalism, Barth offered a new interpretation of culture that did not portray an overly cohesive picture of society without attending to the "roles, relationships, decisions, and innovations of the individual."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia69.com/eng/d/transactionalism/transactionalism.htm|title=Transactionalism - Dictionary &amp; Encyclopedia|website=www.encyclopedia69.com|access-date=2016-08-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160727225546/http://www.encyclopedia69.com/eng/d/transactionalism/transactionalism.htm|archivedate=July 27, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans are transacting with one another at multiple levels of individual, group, and environment. Barth's study appears to not fully articulate how this is happening all-at-once as opposed to as if separate entities interacting (interactional):&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he "environment" of any ethnic group is not only defined by natural conditions, but also by the presence and activities of other ethnic groups on which it depends. Each group exploits only a section of the total environment [perhaps in keeping with the idea of a "transactional whole"], and leaves large parts of it open for other groups to exploit (p. 1079).&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barth|first=Fredrik|date=1956|title=Ecologic Relationships of Ethnic Groups in Swat, North Pakistan|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=58|issue=6|pages=1079–1089|doi=10.1525/aa.1956.58.6.02a00080|jstor=666295}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Using examples from the people of the [[Swat District|Swat district]] of North [[Pakistan]]&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; and, later, in 1966, organization among Norwegian fishermen, Barth set out to demonstrate that social forms like [[kinship]] groups, economic institutions, and political alliances are generated by the actions and strategies of the individuals who deploy organized acts against a context of social [[Theory of constraints|constraints]]. "By observing how people interact with each other [through experience], an insight could be gained into the [interactional] nature of the competition, values and principles that govern individuals' choices."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

This insight would be interactional at best and not transactional—reciprocal and co-constituetive transactions at the levels of individual, group, and environment (including man-as-organism and its ecological situations).

Some scholars argue transactionalism is a theory rather than philosophical approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L7hEAAAAIAAJ|title=Models of Social Organization|last=Barth|first=Fredrik|date=1966-01-01|publisher=Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barth's contribution was initially criticized for paying insufficient attention to cultural constraints on individualism though it influenced the qualitative method known as [[symbolic interactionism]] used in the social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HsiAAAAAMAAJ|title=Transaction and meaning: directions in the anthropology of exchange and symbolic behavior|last=Kapferer|first=Bruce|last2=Issues|first2=Institute for the Study of Human|date=1976-01-01|publisher=Institute for the Study of Human Issues|isbn=9780915980048|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a pragmatic and philosophical approach, transactionalism is recognizable in the theory of the "[[The Sociological Imagination|sociological imagination]]" by American sociologist [[C. Wright Mills]] (1959), in which personal troubles are linked to public issues. In other words, the ''transactional whole'' is not readily apparent at the level of individuals who at that level operate in a self-actional manner when larger forces of sociality, history, biology, and culture are all-at-once at work as part of a global dynamic. Humans are never outside this dynamic current; operating the system in some self-actional or even interactional way.

=== 21st century applications ===

==== Transactional competence ====
Modern architects of the philosophy are John Patterson and Kirkland Tibbels, co-founders of Influence Ecology, acquired, edited, and published, Phillips' dissertation (as is) in 2013. With a foreword written by Tibbels, a hardback and Kindle version was published under the title ''Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study'' (2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=|language=English|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monograph is an account of how human [[Phenomenon|phenomena]] came to be viewed less as the behavior of static and/or mutually isolated entities, and more as dynamic aspects of events in the process of problem-solving, and thereby becoming or satisfying, the unavoidable and inescapable conditions of human life.

==== Transactional leadership (LAP) ====
In a new model of [[Organizational behavior|organizational management]] known as the "leadership-as-practice" Dewey and Bentley's [[Knowing and the Known]] categories of action—self-action, inter-action, and trans-action brings transactionalism into the C-suite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Bzt-CwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=leadership+as+practice+raelin&amp;ots=9IUtX_wKCX&amp;sig=GAjaBWNFpxZBZeHA99cBSO4_1Co#v=onepage&amp;q=self-actional&amp;f=false|title=Leadership-as-Practice: Theory and Application|last=Raelin|first=Joseph A.|date=2016-01-29|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781317408239|location=|pages=171|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A transactional leadership practice is defined by its "trans-actors" who "enact new and unfolding meanings in on-going trans-actions"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Bzt-CwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=leadership+as+practice+raelin&amp;ots=9IUtX_wKCX&amp;sig=GAjaBWNFpxZBZeHA99cBSO4_1Co#v=onepage&amp;q=self-actional&amp;f=false|title=Leadership-as-Practice: Theory and Application|last=Raelin|first=Joseph A.|date=2016-01-29|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781317408239|location=|pages=167|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; situated in contrast to an older model leadership defined by self-actional (self-actors) and inter-actional (inter-actors) practices. In the latter, actors and situations often remain unchanged. In Leadership-as-Practice, Joseph A. Raelin distinguishes between a "[[Deliberate practice|practice]]" that extends and amplifies the meaning of work and its value vs. "practices" that are habitual and sequential activities evoked to simplify everyday routines. A transactional approach—leadership-as-practice—focuses attention on "existing entanglements, complexities, processes, [while also] distinguishing problems in order to coordinate roles, acts, and practices within a group or organization."  Said another way, "trans-action attends to emergent becoming"—a kind of seeing together--"rather than substantive being (Tsoukas and Chia 2002)" among the actors involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Bzt-CwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=leadership+as+practice+raelin&amp;ots=9IUtX_wKCX&amp;sig=GAjaBWNFpxZBZeHA99cBSO4_1Co#v=snippet&amp;q=inter-action&amp;f=false|title=Leadership-as-Practice: Theory and Application|last=Raelin|first=Joseph A.|date=2016-01-29|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781317408239|location=|pages=160|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metaphysics: transactional (vs. self-actional or interactional) ===
The transactional view of metaphysics—studying the nature of reality or what is real—deals with the inseparability of what is known and how humans inquire into what is known—both ''knowing and the known''.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u6hs208TpWwC|title=Knowing and the Known|last=Dewey|first=John|last2=Bentley|first2=Arthur Fisher|date=1949-01-01|publisher=Beacon Press|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=151|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the age of Aristotle, humans have shifted from one paradigm or system of "logic" to another before a transactional metaphysics evolved with a focus that examines and inquires into solving problems first and foremost based on the relationship of man as a biological organism (with a brain and a body) shaped by its environment. In the book ''Transactionalism'' (2015), the nature of reality is traced historically from ''self-action'' to ''interaction'' to ''transactional'' competence each as its own ''age of knowing'' or [[episteme]]''.''

The pre-Galilean age of knowing is defined by ''self-action'' "where things [and thereby people] are viewed as acting on their own powers."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u6hs208TpWwC|title=Knowing and the Known|last=Dewey|first=John|last2=Bentley|first2=Arthur Fisher|date=1949-01-01|publisher=Beacon Press|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=108|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Knowing and the Known]]'', Dewey and Bentley wrote, "The epistemologies, logics, psychologies and sociologies [of our day] are still largely [understood] on a self-actional basis."&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;

The result of Newtonian physics'', interaction'' marks the second age of knowing; a system marked especially by the "third 'law of motion'—that action and reaction are equal and opposite".&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;

The third [[episteme]] is ''transactional'' competence''.''&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Transactionalism: An historical and interpretive study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=2013|isbn=|location=Ojai, CA.|pages=51–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With origins in the contributions of Darwin, "man's understandings are finite as opposed to infinite. In the same way, his views, goals, commitments, and beliefs have relative status as opposed to absolute."&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=92|language=English|quote=|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Dewey and Arthur Bentley asserted this competence as "the right to see together, extensionally and durationally, much that is talked about conventionally as if it were composed of irreconcilable separates."&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; We tend to avoid considering our actions as part of a dynamic and transactional whole, whether in mundane or complex activities; whether in making an invitation, request, or offer or in the complex management of a program or company. We tend to avoid studying, thinking, and planning our moves and moods for a comprehensive, reciprocal, and co-constitutive—in other words, ''transactional''—whole.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Knowing and the known.|last=Dewey|first=John|last2=Bentley|first2=Arthur F.|publisher=Beacon Press|year=1949|isbn=978-0837184982|location=Boston|pages=104|quote=Referencing Arthur F. Bentley, Inquiry into Inquiries. Boston: The Beacon Press, 1954, p. 210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A transactional whole includes the organized acts including ideas, narratives, people as resources implementing ideas, services, and products, the things involved, settings, and personalities, all considered in and over time. With this competence, that which ''acts'' and is ''acted upon'' become united for a moment in a mutual or ethical exchange, where both are reciprocally transformed&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; contradicting "any absolute separation or isolation"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=74–5|language=English|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; often found in the [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualistic]] thinking and categorization of [[Western thought]].

Dualistic thinking and categorization often lead to over-simplification of the transactional whole found in the convenient but ineffective resorting to "exclusive classifications." Such classifications tend to exclude and reify man as if he has dominion over his nature or the environment.

In his seminal 20th century work ''Physics and Philosophy'', [[Werner Heisenberg|Warner Heisenberg]] reflects this kind of transactionalist thinking: "What we observe is not nature itself, but nature exposed to our method of questioning.” The together-at-once reality of man as organism-environment is often overlooked in the dualistic thinking of even major philosophers like Descartes who is often referenced for his "[[Cogito ergo sum|I think, therefore I am]]" philosophy. Of a transactionalist approach, Heisenberg writes, "This was a possibility of which [[René Descartes|Descartes]] could not have thought, but it makes the sharp separation of the world and I impossible."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZJjuAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=questioning|title=Physics and Philosophy: The Revolution in Modern Science|last=Heisenberg|first=Werner|date=2007-05-08|publisher=HarperCollins|year=|isbn=9780061209192|location=|pages=55|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dualistic thinking prevents man from thinking. "In the spirit of [Charles Sanders] [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]], transactionalism substitutes continuity for discontinuity, change and interdependence for separateness."&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=80|language=English|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in problem solving, whenever we "insert a name instead of a problem," when words like "soul," "mind," "need," "I.Q." or "trait" are expressed as if real, they have the power to block and distort free inquiry into what is known in fact or as fact in the transactional whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=81|language=English|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the nature of change and being, "that which ''acts'' and that which is ''acted upon''" always undergo a reciprocal relationship that is affected by the presence and influence of the other.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  We as human beings, as part of nature as an [[organism]] "integral to (as opposed to separate from, above or outside of) any investigation and inquiry may use a transactionalist approach to expand our personal [[knowledge]] so as to solve life's complex problems.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=45|language=English|quote=|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of ''transactionalism'' is not to discover what is already there, but for a person to seek and interpret senses, objects, places, positions, or any aspect of transactions between one's Self and one's environment (including objects, other people, and their symbolic interactions) in terms of the aims and desires each one needs and wants to satisfy and fulfill. It is essential that one simultaneously take into account the needs and desires of others in one's environment or ecology to avoid the self-actional or self-empowerment ideology of a rugged and competitive individualism. While other philosophies may discuss similar ethical concerns, this co-constitutive and reciprocal element of problem-solving is central to transactionalism.

To put it simply, "to experience is to transact; in point of fact, experience is a transaction of organism-environment."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In other words, what is "known" by the knower (or organism) is always filtered and shaped by both internal and external moods and narratives, mirrored in and through our relationships to the physical affordances and constraints in our environment or in specific ecologies.

The metaphysics of transactional inquiry is characterized in the pragmatic writing of William James who insists that "single barreled terms," terms like "thought" and "thing," actually stop or block inquiries into what is known and how we know it. Instead, a transactional orientation of ‘double-barreledness’ or the "interdependence of aspects of experience" must always be considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=69|language=English|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; James offers his readers insight into the "double-barreledness" of experience with an apt proposition:&lt;blockquote&gt;Is the preciousness of a diamond a quality of the gem [the thing] or is it a feeling in our mind [the thought]? Practically we treat it as both or as either, according to the temporary direction of our thought. The ‘experienced’ and the ‘experiencing,’ the ‘seen’ and the ‘seeing,’ are, in actuality, only names for a single fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Transactionalism-Historical-Interpretive-Trevor-Phillips-ebook/dp/B018EOAAPI/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=70|language=English|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u6hs208TpWwC|title=Knowing and the Known|last=Dewey|first=John|last2=Bentley|first2=Arthur Fisher|date=1949-01-01|publisher=Beacon Press|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=53|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

What is real then, from a transactionist perspective, must be constantly reevaluated relative to man as organism-environment in a co-constituitive and reciprocal dynamic with people, personalities, situations, aims, and given the needs each party seeks to satisfy.

=== Epistemology: truth from inquiry ===
Transactionalists are firmly intolerant of "anything resembling an 'ultimate' truth -- or 'absolute' knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=101|language=English|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the evolution of psychology about the nature of man, transactionalists reject the notion of a mind-body split or anything resembling the bifurcation of what they perceive as the circuitry in which our biological stimulus-response exists. Examples transactionalists reject include the self-acting notions of Aristotle who posited that "the soul -- the psyche -- realized itself in and through the body, and that matter and form were two aspects involved in all existence." Later, the claims of French philosopher René Descartes, recognized as the father of modern Western philosophy, were examined and defined as "interactional". Descartes suggested  stimulus-response as the realm where the mind controls the body and the body may influence the rational mind out of the passion of our emotions.

Transactionalists recognize Cartesian dualism as a form of disintegrating the transactional whole of man "into two complete substances, joined to another no one knows how."&lt;ref name="Maritain 1944 179"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Dream of Descartes|last=Maritain|first=J.|publisher=Philosophical Library|year=1944|isbn=|location=New York|pages=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lokhorst"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2016/entries/pineal-gland/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Lokhorst|first=Gert-Jan|date=2016-01-01|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Summer 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The body as a physical entity, on the one hand, and the soul or thought, on the other, was regarded in a Cartesian mindset as "an angel inhabiting a machine and directing it by means of the pineal gland"&lt;ref name="Maritain 1944 179"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lokhorst"/&gt; This tranactionalists reject.

Man has the propensity to treat the mind and thought or the mind and body as abstractions and this tendency to deny the interrelatedness or coordinated continuity results in misconceptions in learning and inaccurate thinking as humans move and thrive with an ecology.  Accurate thinking and learning begins and is constantly developed through action resulting from thought as a repetitive circuit of experience known in psychology as deliberate practice. Educational philosopher Trevor Phillips, now deceased, frames this tendency to falsely organize our perception: "[W]e fail to realize that we can know nothing about things [or ourselves] beyond their significance to us," otherwise we distort our "reality" and treat things we perceive within it, including our bodies or mind, as if concrete thereby "denying the interconnectedness of realities" (plural).&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=102|language=English|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transactionalists suggest that accurate (or inaccurate) thinking is rarely considered an unintended consequence of our propensity for abstractions.

When an individual transacts through intelligent or consequential actions circumscribed within the constraints and conditions of her/his environment in a reflexive, repetitive arc of learned experience, there is a "transaction between means and ends" (see reference below). This transactional approach features twin aspects of a larger event rather than merely manipulating the means to an end in our circumstances and situations. For instance, a goal can never be produced by abstraction, by simply thinking about or declaring a promise to produce a result. Nor can it be anticipated or foreseen (an abstraction at best) without a significant "pattern of inquiry," as John Dewey later defined and articulated, into the constraints and conditions that happen and are happening given the interdependence of all the people and objects involved in a simple or complex transaction. The nature of our environment affects all these entities within a transaction. Thus, revealing the limiting and reductive notion of manipulating a psychology around stimulus and response found in Aristotilian or Cartesian thought.

A transaction is recognized here as one that occurs between the "means and ends;" in other words, transactional competence is derived from the "distinctions between the how, the what (or subject-matter), and the why (or what for)." This transactional whole constitutes a reciprocal connection and a reflexive arc of learned and lived experience.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=105|language=English|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a transactional approach one can derive a certain kind of value from one's social exchange. Value in knowing how, what, and why the work done with your mind and body fulfill on the kinds of transactions needed to live a good and satisfying life that functions well with others. Truth from actual inquiry is foundational for organism-environment to define and live by a set of workable ethical values that functions with others.

=== Ethics: reciprocal and co-constitutive ===
While ''self-interest'' governs the ethical principles of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]], here the principle is that man as an organism is in a ''reciprocal, constitutive'' relationship with her/his environment. Disabusing the psychological supposition of our "skin-boundedness" (discussed further below), transactionalism rejects the notion that we are apart from our environment or that man has dominion over it. Man, woman, and child must view life and be viewed in the undifferentiated whole of ''organism-environment''. This reciprocal and co-constitutive relationship is what sets Transactionalism apart from other philosophies.

What John Dewey meant by "reciprocal" was that:&lt;blockquote&gt;... consequences have to be determined on the grounds of what is selected and handled as means in exactly the same sense in which the converse holds and demands constant attention if activities are to be intelligently conducted.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/John-Dewey-Arthur-Bentley-Correspondence/dp/B000OKT5RA/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1473454738&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=ratner+and+altman|title=John Dewey and Arthur F.

Whether the environment is natural or man-made, whether discussing biology, sociology, culture, linguistics, history and memory, or economics and physics, every ''organism-environment'' is ''reciprocal, constitutive, socially-conditioned and'' constantly in flux demanding our ethical attention to conditions and consequences as we live life. [[John Dewey]] and [[Arthur F. Bentley|Arthur Bentley]], like [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] before them, were out to distinguish an ethical "living" logic rather than a static one.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Both rejected the supposition that man had dominion over or governed behavior in his/her environment embracing a presupposition of transactionalism; we are ''reciprocal, co-constitutive, socially-conditioned, and motivated'' "together-at-once" as we seek solutions to living a good life.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IJmuDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT85&amp;lpg=PT85&amp;dq=intradermal+psychological&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TCIe_q8yzG&amp;sig=4yqwJ_qzHyBZ425LEo-G26PNg38&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwieno3d_a_RAhWEZCYKHflKDdEQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=intradermal%20psychological&amp;f=false|title=Beyond Behaviorism|last=Lee|first=Vicki L.|date=2016-07-15|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317247524|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transactionalists reject the "localization" of our psychology as if "skin-bound."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Bentley wrote, "No creature lives merely under its skin." In other words, we should not define and distinguish experience in and from the subjective mind and feelings. Conversely, we cannot rely solely on external circumstances or some static or inherited logic. [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] said of followers of Aristotle in seeking ethical knowledge that one should "come with arguments and demonstrations of your own...but bring us no more texts and naked authorities, for our disputes are about the sensible world and not a paper one."&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Humans are always transacting, "together-at-once,"&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IJmuDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT85&amp;lpg=PT85&amp;dq=%22because+without+the+context,+the+action+would+not+be+the+action+it+is.%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TCIe-h8BEM&amp;sig=8AeBPz3oIbZXhHlQp8t3uZzOU8I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjc0pynpLDRAhVKylQKHVD2BjYQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22because%20without%20the%20context,%20the%20action%20would%20not%20be%20the%20action%20it%20is.%22&amp;f=false|title=Beyond Behaviorism|last=Lee|first=Vicki L.|date=2016-07-15|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317247524|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; part of, shaped by, and shap-ing the experience we call "knowledge" as an ''organism-environment''.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Dewey and Bentley were intrigued by, and ultimately questioned, "the significance of the concept ‘skin’ and its role in philosophical and psychological thought."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; They offered a biological or natural justification that came to define a transactionalist approach. The known and what is known are both a function of man having "evolved among other organisms" within natural selection or evolution.

Man's most intellectual and advanced "knowings" are not merely outgrowths of his own doing or being. The natural evolution of things outside our knowingness creates the very context in which our known and knowings arise. We are not inventing what is known outside or, in a vacuum beyond, who we are and who we are is an organism-environment together-at-once.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  We are not creatures separated by skin with an internal world of the mind and body "in here" separate from an environment of objects and people "out there". Human beings intelligently live, adapt to, and organize life in a reciprocal, co-constitutive experience that is what Dewey and Bentley term "trans-dermal".

A "trans-dermal" experience demands knowledgeable and accurate inquiry into the conditions and consequences of each transaction where the organizing of ideas and acts (knowledge), is itself a transaction which grows out of the problem-solving and creative exploring within the universe of social situations in which we exist. Dewey and Bentley wrote, "truth, or for that matter falsity, is a function of the deliberately striven for consequences arising out of inquiry."&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Our behavior and acts in knowing, or transacting, must be considered "together" and "at-once" with its conditions and consequences for any ambitious movement or fulfillment to occur alone and among other people in any setting with objects and constructd inherited from others known and unknown over time. Transacting demands study, a slowing down of our movement, and the development of a transactional competence in order to fulfill certain needs or solve problems while functioning among others.

In Dewey's final days, wrote Phillips, he emphasized the twin aspects of attending to both the means and the ends of any transaction: "It is…impossible to have an end-in-view or to anticipate the consequences of any proposed line of action." A "trans-dermal" consciousness is, therefore, key to moving ethically. To move, experience life, or transact in a principled manner, considering the reciprocal and co-constituitive nature of organism-environment becomes an [[wikt:object lesson|object lesson]] governing both social behavior as well as in transacting from a trans-dermal view with objects or other bodies.

==== Trans-dermal experience ====
The work of Australian educational philosopher [[Vicki L. Lee]] further elucidates and breaks down what is "trans-dermal" experience—how it works and why it matters—based on her work in the [[philosophy of cognitive science]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://philpapers.org/s/Vicki%20L.%20Lee|title=Works by Vicki L. Lee - PhilPapers|website=philpapers.org|access-date=2017-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[educational philosophy]], and [[radical behaviorism]] about which she has published extensively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Vicki L.|date=1987-01-01|title=The Structure of Conduct|journal=Behaviorism|volume=15|issue=2|pages=141–148|jstor=27759127}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; This complex paradigm is clearly evidenced by Lee in this thickly described example:   &lt;blockquote&gt;Acts are more than movements. ...Our discriminations depend on movements and their contexts seen together-at-once or as an undifferentiated whole. In discriminating watering the garden from hosing the driveway, we see the bodily movements and their occasion and results. We see the garden, the watering implement, and so forth, as much as we see the body's activities. The notion of together-at-once emphasizes that we do not see movements and contexts separately and then infer the action. Rather the context is internal to the action, because without the context, the action would not be the action it is.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;A basic presupposition of the philosophy of transactionalism is to always consider that that which is known about the world (extra-dermal) is "directly concerned with the activity of the knower" which is merely from some sense of "skin-boundedness" (intra-dermal). The known and the knower, as Dewey and Bentley examined in detail in their collaborative publication, must always be considered "'twin aspects of common fact."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Behavior, movement, and acts are not merely a function of the mind, of wishful or positive thinking or belief in external forces, nor can it be determined ethically from the philosophers of the past or knowledge written in a book. It is our ability to transact trans-dermally—to be and become ecologically-fit as an organism-environment—that begets truthful inquiry into living a good and satisying life, functioning well among others.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Philosophy and Women's Studies Professor Shannon Sullivan explores and applies "transactional knowing through embodied and relational lived experience"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/product_info.php?products_id=182842|title=Living Across and Through Skins|last=Sullivan|first=Shannon|date=2001|website=Indiana University Press|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a feminist epistemology developed out of the pragmatist tradition.

=== Politics: Cooperation and knowing-as-inquiry ===
The branch of philosophy recognized as "politics" concerns the governance of community and group interaction, not merely that of the state as conceived when thinking of a local or national government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy|last=Blackburn|first=Simon|date=2016-05-01|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780191799556|edition=3|location=http://www.oxfordreference.com|pages=s.v., "politics, philosophy of"|language=English|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Laws of Motion'' (1920), physicist [[James Clerk Maxwell]] articulated the modern conception of "transaction" used here—one that is not exclusive to an economic context limited to only the opposition of a buyer-seller in a trade or other analougous uses. Unlike its use in commercial affairs, there is a radical departure from any tendency to perceive buyer-seller (as well as organism-environment) as opposing or separate forces. In a transactionalist approach, Maxwell (as well as others) view the former and latter as "two parts of the same phenomenon."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=XXq9qgnWtbMC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=j+maxwell+clerk+1920&amp;ots=0o8xj9QN40&amp;sig=BNp7vIN-FKXs47N2YQHYP6KT96g#v=onepage&amp;q=transaction&amp;f=false|title=Matter and Motion|last=Maxwell|first=James Clerk|date=1920-01-01|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=9780486668956|location=|pages=27|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Dewey and Bentley apply this notion of 'transactional' to learning more than any other context. In the educative process, acting without knowing is a separation of the same phenomenon enjoined in inquiry. Without inquiry acting does not work. Acting and knowing cooperate to provide knowledge to an organism-environment which must essentially involve inquiry into things that have happened and are happening: &lt;blockquote&gt;Knowledge – if the term is to be employed at all – is a name for the product of competent inquiries, and is constituted only as the outcome of a particular inquiry.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;It is not "a process taking place, or as a status located in or at an animal organism."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Knowledge arises from inquiry and the testing of that inquiry to insure the fitness of not only the solution but the organism-environment. While a human being is central or "nuclear" to its organism-environment,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; it must abdicate any sense of dominion over the socio-biological cosmos of which human being is part and never outside of. Each situation—and this transactionalists assert is radical—must be examined and determined by a construction of moves and action based on the capacity of that organism to fulfill its intentions and thrive (or not). Dewey and Bentley later insisted that knowing "as inquiry, [is therefore] a way, or distinct form, of behavior."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Transactionalists define politics in this philosophy as a cooperative, genuine interaction between all participating parties whether buyer-seller, student-teacher, or worker-boss given that we are biological and social subjects&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/JohnDeweyLogicTheTheoryOfInquiry/%5BJohn_Dewey%5D_Logic_-_The_Theory_of_Inquiry_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "[John Dewey] Logic The Theory Of Inquiry"|last=|first=|date=|website=archive.org|publisher=|page=|access-date=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; involved not merely in "transacting" for our own advantage or gain. "[S]ocial phenomena cannot be understood except as there is prior understanding of physical conditions and the laws of their [socio-biological] interactions," wrote [[John Dewey]] in ''[[Logic: The Theory of Inquiry]]''.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; He added further, "Inquiry into [social phenomena], with respect both to data that are significant and to their relations or proper ordering, is conditioned upon extensive prior knowledge of physical phenomena and their laws. This fact accounts in part for the retarded and immature state of social subjects." Thus, cooperation and knowing as inquiry is foundational to governing communal affairs of any kind including economic trade and the educative process.

In our existing models of formal education, we bifurcate what Dewey viewed as indispensable. We, as a rule, segregate "utility and culture, absorption and expression, theory and practice....in any educational scheme"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=165|language=English|quote=|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, progressive educator [[Elsie Ripley Clapp]] distinguished a similar commitment to "cooperative transaction of inquiry" in her vision that enjoined community and school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001449588|title=The use of resources in education|last=Clapp|first=Elsie Ripley.|date=1952-01-01|publisher=Harper|year=|isbn=|location=New York|pages=vii-xi|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intelligence, meaning that which is acquired through inquiry and testing, allows man to foresee consequences and take control of his actions without dogma or beliefs (that might be wrong) derived from past experience or expectations.  If the study of politics in philosophy is a "study of force," of knowing "what actions are permissible" given that man is an organism-environment,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.importanceofphilosophy.com/FiveBranchesMain.html|title=Branches of Philosophy|last=Landauer|first=Jeff|last2=Rowlands|first2=Joseph|date=2001|website=www.importanceofphilosophy.com|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; then transactionalists assert that cooperation and knowing-as-inquiry are vital to functioning among others.

''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' noted that Dewey was critical of the classical neoliberal stance that the asbtract individual precedes a conception of society or social institutions. Dewey maintained that social institutions were not a "means for obtaining something for individuals. They are means for 'creating' individuals" (''Reconstruction in Philosophy'', ''MW''12, 190-192). In this way, classical liberalism seems to exemplify ‘the most pervasive fallacy of philosophical thinking’ (‘Context and Thought’, ''LW''5, 5). Transactionalism is a radical form of governing that resists the tendency to "divide up experienced phenomena, and to take the distinct analysed elements to be separate existences, independent both of the analysis and of each other."&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/dewey-political/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Festenstein|first=Matthew|date=2014-01-01|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Spring 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intelligent thinking is anti-dualistic, accurate, forethought taking into account other people, communities, and cultures that stems from a "deliberate control of what is done with reference to making what happens to us and what we do to things as fertile as possible of suggestions (of suggested meanings)." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Transactionalism.html?id=JbC_nQEACAAJ|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor Joseph|date=1967-01-01|publisher=Xerox University Microfilms|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=175|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, intelligent thinking is a means for trying out the validity of those suggestions. The political governing of thinking towards dualisms and bifurcation as well as the "false conception of the individual" is what Dewey argued limited man's free, meaning "liberal", thought and action. All of this served as the core reasoning behind Dewey's development of an experimental philosophy that offset elite distortions regarding a public and transactional interest in education and learning.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

==== Individual as co-constitutive, organism-environment ====
Transationalist psychologists and educational philosophers reject the ideologies precipitated from Western ideologies of "[[Do It Yourself (disambiguation)|do-it-yourself]]" or the "if it's up to me, it will be" mentality that leads to entitlement and the naiveté of slogans like "follow your passion" that deny any consideration of our trans-dermal condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.influenceecology.com/category/podcast/|title=Podcast Archives – Influence Ecology|last=|first=|date=|website=Influence Ecology|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-07|quote=#20: Joanna Burgraf - Worst Advice Ever: Follow Your Passion by Influence Ecology / December 19, 2016 Joanna Burgraf is a Chicago-based senior lead for an award-winning creative services team managing ten brands at Enova International, a company using technology to develop innovative financial products.

Transactionalist psychologists and philosophers replace once sought-after [[Existentialism]] as a remedy to feelings of alienation with a trans-dermal orientation to living. Rather than applying a theory or approach that emphasizes the individual as a "free and responsible agent determining their own development through acts of the will,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=existentialism&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8|title=existentialism - Google Search|website=www.google.com|access-date=2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; subjects are invited to co-create as an organism-environment functioning among all other organism-environments, including the conditions and consequences of objects and personalities, in order to intelligently structure existence in and amongst it all. The very act of participating in co-creation, according to transactionalists, gives and allows each person her/his unique status and dignity in their environment.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Aesthetics: Value-satisfaction from an assumptive world ===
Distinct from an [[Aesthetic Theory|aesthetic theory]] of [[Taste (sociology)|taste]] or a rationale for the beauty in an object of art,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2015/entries/aesthetic-concept/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Shelley|first=James|date=2015-01-01|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a transactionalist theory of [[aesthetics]] concerns the perceptual judgments we use to define value, purposeful activity or satisfaction in any experience. Based on studies by transactionalist psychologists [[Adelbert Ames Jr.|Adelbert Ames, Jr.]] (known for The Ames Demonstrations&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Weipeng Liu (YouTube Channel)|title=Ames' Window|date=2009-03-12|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tc_LqIaO2b8|accessdate=2017-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[William Howard Ittelson]], [[Hadley Cantril]], along with [[John Dewey]], the biological role of perception is key to understanding transactionalism. Perceiving is viewed as "part of the process of living by which each one of us, from his own particular point of view, creates for himself the world within which he has his life’s experiences and through which he strives to gain his satisfactions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Perception.html?id=yFEAAAAAMAAJ|title=Perception: A Transactional Approach|last=Ittelson|first=William Howard|last2=Cantril|first2=Hadley|date=1954-01-01|publisher=Doubleday &amp; Company|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=23|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sum total of these assumptions was recognized as the "assumptive world."&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=146|language=English|quote=|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The assumptive world stems from all that we [[experience]], all the things and events we assess and assign meaning to, which function as a ''contextual whole'' also known as a ''transactional whole''. Dewey also referred to the assumptive world as a "situation" (where organism and environment are inseparable) or as a "field" in which behavior, stimulus, and response are framed as if a ''reflexive circuit''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/JohnDeweyLogicTheTheoryOfInquiry|title=[John Dewey] Logic The Theory Of Inquiry|last=Dewey|first=John|date=1938-01-01|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=67|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "To the modern transactionalist, experiences alter perceptual processes, and in the act of altering them, the purposing aspect of perception is either furthered or its fulfillment interfered with."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=189|language=English|quote=|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is through action, through movement, that man is capable of bringing forth a value-satisfaction to his or her experience.  Man's capacity to "sense value in the quality of his experience" was registered through his serial expectations and standards stemming from previous transactions throughout life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=144–5|language=English|quote=|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A theory of value is therefore derived from one's behavioral inquiry within an assumptive world. "Knowledge is a transaction that develops out of man's explorations within [that] cosmos."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=102|language=English|quote=|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transactionalists reject the notion that any truth is inherently settled or beyond question. The consequences of any inquiry will be dependent on the ''situation'' or transactional whole in which man as an organism-environment finds him- or her-self.

To clarify the theory of valuation for man, John Dewey wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
To declare something ''satisfactory'' [vs. satisfying] is to assert that it meets specifiable conditions. It is, in effect, a judgment that the thing 'will do'. It involves a prediction; it contemplates a future in which the thing will continue to serve; it ''will'' do. It asserts a consequence the thing will actively institute, it ''will''  do."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/JohnDeweyLogicTheTheoryOfInquiry|title=[ John Dewey] Logic The Theory Of Inquiry|last=Dewey|first=John|date=1938-01-01|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=261|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Transactionalism-Historical-Interpretive-Trevor-Phillips-ebook/dp/B018EOAAPI/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=104|language=English|quote=|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ultimately, transactionalism is a move away from the conclusion that knowledge depends on an independent knower and something to be known.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; The reality of a particular situation depends, transactionally speaking, on the interpretation place[d] upon the situation by a particular person. Interpretation is possible only through the accumulation of experience which, in effect, is what is meant by “assumptions”.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Without the hitches and mistakes one encounters in the welter of daily living, the nature of the assumptive world would never arise into consciousness.  The assumptive world, initially highlighted in the 25 experiments in perception known as The Ames demonstrations, becomes the seeming reality of our world.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Man’s transactions of living involve, in sum, capacities, and aspects of his nature operating together. To transact is to participate in the process of translating the ongoing energies of the environment into one’s own perceptual awareness, and to transform the environment through the perceptual act.  Value-satisfaction arises when the inadequacies of man's assumptive world are revealed or invalidated.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;  Thereby, the consequences of any transactional experience determines what is valuable or what will do vs. that which is satisfying but will not do.  The good life, for the transactionalist, consists of a unity of values, achieved by means of reflective thought, and accepted in the full light of their conditions and consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|location=|pages=106|language=English|quote=|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To transact is to act intelligently with an aim in mind while avoiding the tendency to surrender one's awareness to complacency or indifference that stems from mere information or untested knowledge.

==  Generational significance ==
The importance of the study of transactionalism arose in the late 1960s in response to an "alienation syndrome"&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|asin=B018EOAAPI|title=Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study|last=Phillips|first=Trevor J.|date=2015-11-22|publisher=Influence Ecology|editor-last=Tibbels|editor-first=Kirkland|page=27|language=English|editor-last2=Patterson|editor-first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; among youth of that generation. As the counter-culture challenged and reassessed society's "philosophical-psychological complex, its ''[[Weltanschauung]]'',"&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://utpress.utexas.edu/index.php/books/paltow|title=Toward A Theory of Cultural Linguistics|last=Palmer.|first=Gary B.|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=1996|isbn=|location=|pages=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; their political and social alienation sparked protests against the war and the draft as well as historic racial rebellions in various U.S. cities.  The [[Long hot summer of 1967]] and the counterculture movement named the [[Summer of Love]] also in 1967 reflected the antipathy of young people who questioned everything. American society's norms and values were perceived as denying dignity to all. Riots of the period were studied in a report by the U.S. [[Kerner Commission]] and scholars began to study the patterns of alienation expressed by youth in the sixties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eisner|first=Victor|date=1969-02-01|title=Alienation of Youth|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1746-1561.1969.tb04289.x/abstract|journal=Journal of School Health|language=en|volume=39|issue=2|pages=81–90|doi=10.1111/j.1746-1561.1969.tb04289.x|issn=1746-1561}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zack|first=John J.|date=1970-06-01|title=The Alienation of Youth|journal=Canadian Family Physician|volume=16|issue=6|pages=56–59|issn=0008-350X|pmc=2281733|pmid=20468522}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olsen|first=Marvin E.|date=1969-03-01|title=Two Categories of Political Alienation|url=http://sf.oxfordjournals.org/content/47/3/288|journal=Social Forces|language=en|volume=47|issue=3|pages=288–299|doi=10.2307/2575027|issn=0037-7732}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watts|first=William A.|last2=Lynch|first2=Steve|last3=Whittaker|first3=David|date=1969-01-01|title=Alienation and activism in today's college-age youth: Socialization patterns and current family relationships.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/cou/16/1/1/|journal=Journal of Counseling Psychology|language=English|volume=16|issue=1|pages=1–7|doi=10.1037/h0026683|issn=1939-2168}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Polk|first=Kenneth|date=1969-10-01|title=Class, Strain and Rebellion Among Adolescents|url=http://socpro.oxfordjournals.org/content/17/2/214|journal=Social Problems|language=en|volume=17|issue=2|pages=214–224|doi=10.2307/799867|issn=0037-7791}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Youth sought a kind of [[existentialism]] expressed by a need to be "true to oneself." This current of alienation unfortunately veered away from a relevant understanding of the transactional whole taking into account the reciprocal and co-constitutive nature of man as an organism-environment fulfilling important conditions of life with others all the time. It resembles the famous line from ''[[Devotions upon Emergent Occasions]]'', written by English poet John Donne -- "No man is an island". Transactionalism presented an alternative to the limitation and unintended outcomes of the alienation syndrome.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

==Benefits and applications==
Designed to account for all aspects of experience—subjective and objective—transactionalism requires a slowing down in assessing all the facts involved with the how, what, when, where, and why as we move to transact with others. It demands and requires always considering how a transaction with another and one's self (e.g., a parent or spouse spending additional hours socializing at the gym) is or is not beneficial to all involved in a transaction (e.g., other members of the family). The costs may be in time, attention, or money or in a condition of life (e.g., family, career, sleep). Transactionalism requires an interdependence of thought, study, and action.

A transactionalist must account for one's biology and cognition ([[metaphysics]]); the ways knowing reality ([[epistemology]]); the reciprocal, co-constitutive, relationship (or [[ethics]]) between our social self and the interactions constrained by both our natural and man-made environment. We as human beings live in distinct sociological patterns with people, material and immaterial culture shaped by specific and ever-changing times and places further articulated by increasing migration and globalization. Transactionalism insists that one attend to the political distribution of goods and services along with the ways its value has and is exchanged and changing among people and groups ([[politics]]) as well as how persons are socialized to understand what it means to live a good life as well as fulfill those conditions over time ([[aesthetics]]).

Transactionalism offers more than existentialism offered with its aim of being "true to oneself." The alienation that results from its orientation to the self at the expense of societal norms and values, even in small groups, often leads to naiveté, despair, frustration, agitation, and even indifference, at the expense of consciously organizing one's acts, while functioning among others, to fulfill one's unique and necessary interests in living a good and satisfying life. Transactionalism counters the naive  "do as I see fit" mentality of [[Authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]] regardless of other's needs and concerns, which inevitably leads to negative consequences and outcomes over time. Transactionalism depends upon the "integration of man and his surroundings."&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Phillips' dissertation documented the evolution of a "transactional approach;" one that rests on the fact that we are [[Biological basis of personality|biological]], [[Linguistic performance|linguistic]], and that we must transact considering a trans-dermal experience of our thoughts, behavior, and exchange on every level imagined while ethically functioning with others well.

A series of podcasts exemplify the application of a transactional approach to a diverse array of professionals from various countries .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/influence-ecology/id1146278689|title=Influence Ecology by Influence Ecology on iTunes|website=iTunes|access-date=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tullia d'Aragona''' (c. 1510 – 1556) was a 16th-century Italian poet, author and philosopher. Born in Rome in 1510, Tullia traveled throughout Venice, Ferrara, Siena, and Florence before returning to Rome. Throughout her life Tullia was esteemed one of the best female writers, poets, philosophers, and charmers of her time. Influencing many of the most famous male philosophers, Tullia’s work raised the status (in literature) of women to be on an equal footing as men. Her fame and success made her into the most celebrated of [[Renaissance]] poet-courtesans. With her intellect, literary abilities and social graces, she entertained powerful men and famous poets.

==Early years==
Tullia was born in [[Rome]] around 1510, to Giulia Campana, a courtesan of the time. Also known as Giulia Ferrarese, her mother was lauded as "the most famous beauty of her day". Her father was thought to be Cardinal Luigi d'Aragona, who was himself the illegitimate grandson of [[Ferdinand I of Naples]]. Allegedly in order to cover up the scandal, Campana married Constanzo Palmieri d’Aragona. While it is not confirmed, many researches predict that this was a way for the family to save face, while also allowing Ferdinand to continue to see Campana. The Cardinal provided for Tullia her classical education in the humanities; young Tullia proved to be a [[child prodigy]] who amazed even her mother's 'guests.' Because Tullia's mother was not married to her father, Tullia's life was marked by the stigma of her illegitimate birth to a courtesan mother.

==Years in Rome==
[[File:Joseph Heintz d. Ä. 001.jpg|thumb|318px|left|&lt;center&gt;Tullia d'Aragona]]
Entering into the world as courtesan at age 18, Tullia became successful as a writer and an intellectual. She was often seen in the company of poets, such as [[Sperone Speroni]]. After the Cardinal's death in 1519, Tullia spent seven years in [[Siena]], before she returned to Rome in 1526. Available evidence suggests that she was highly mobile and stayed in [[Bologna]] in 1529, where Pope [[Clement VII]] and Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] were engaged in negotiations after the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome in 1527]].

In 1531, she became involved with [[Filippo Strozzi the Younger|Filippo Strozzi]], a Florentine banking magnate who had been famous for a short-lived affair with Italy's most beautiful courtesan, Camilla Pisana. Strozzi became so enamored with d'Aragona that he shared state secrets with her and had to be recalled to Florence. Other lovers included Emilio Orsini, who founded a Tullia Society of six cavaliers who protected her honor.

In 1535, Penelope d’Aragona was born in Rome. Scholars debate whether Penelope d'Aragona was Tullia's daughter (Tullia at the time was 25 years old), or her sister, as the family claimed.

==Later years==
[[File:1552 d'Aragona Dialogue.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The title page of a 1552 edition of her ''Dialogues on the Infinity of Love''.]]At age 30, Tullia moved to Venice, where she became involved with poet [[Bernardo Tasso]].

In 1537, Battista Stambellino's correspondence to Isabella D'Este suggests she was living in [[Ferrara]]. Ferrara was a capital for arts and culture, and d'Aragona made full use of her skills for singing and sharp-tongued entertainment. Two of Italy's literary giants, [[Girolamo Muzio]] and Ercole Bentivoglio, both fell in love with her. Muzio wrote five ardent [[eclogues]] to her, naming her as "Thalia", while Bentivoglio went so far as to carve her name on every tree on the [[Po River]]. When she left Ferrara four years later, reportedly more than one man had attempted suicide for her.

In 1543, she is recorded to have married Silvestro Guiccardi of Ferrara, whom we do not know anything about. The only evidence of their relationship is a malicious comment that was made by Agnolo Firenzuola who claimed that Tullia let her husband die of hunger. For Tullia, this marriage acted as a way for her to “exempt herself from living in the neighborhood designated for prostitues,” and allowed her to wear clothing that distinguished her as a noble woman. Tullia did, however, have a confirmend son  Celio, who is mentioned in her will, but it is unconfirmed whether or not Guiccardi was the father.

In 1545/6, she was again in Siena, but fled civic unrest there and arrived in [[Florence]], where she became an attendant at the court of [[Cosimo I de Medici]], then Grand Duke of Tuscany.

While there, she composed ''Dialogues on the Infinity of Love'' (1547), which is a [[Neo-Platonist]] assertion of women's sexual and emotional autonomy within exchanges of [[romantic love]]. ''Initially published in Venice, Italy in 1547 (in Italian), the novel has been translated in recent years in English for the first time by Rinaldina Russell and Bruce Merry in 1997. This book of philosophy was the first of its kind, for it cast a female rather than a male as the main commentator/ knowledge holder on the ethics of love. During Tullia's life, all forms of sensual experiences were considered sacrilegious, but Tulia argues in her work that all sexual drives are uncontrollable and blameless, and that they combined with spiritual needs create the only moral form of love. The only way for love to be honorable, according to this piece, is if both males and females accept and acknowledge their sexual and spiritual desires (of their body and soul). This concept not only validated the importance of sexual desires within a society that choose to repress such things, but also vindicated the role and power of women in a society that viewed women as less than. Tullia brings women to an equal level with men in regards to both their sexual nature and their intellect.''&lt;ref&gt;Aragona, Tullia D' Preface. Dialogue on the Infinity of Love. Trans. Rinaldina Russell and Bruce Merry. Chicago: U o&lt;/ref&gt;

During the preceding century, the Medici court had sponsored considerable revival of Neo-Platonist scholarship, particularly [[Marsilio Ficino]], who had also written on the nature of sexual desire and love from this perspective. At the same time, she wrote a series of [[sonnets]] that praised the attributes of prominent Florentine noblemen of her era, or celebrated contemporary literary figures. Her last known work, ''Il Meschino'', is an epic poem, which related the experiences of a captive youth, Giarrino, who was enslaved and journeyed across Europe, Africa and Asia, as well as [[Purgatory]] and Hell, trying to find his lost parents.

As an aging forty-year-old, d'Aragona continued writing sonnets, especially to historian and poet [[Benedetto Varchi]], who inspired her. With his patronage and her intellect, she turned her house into a philosophical academy for the ''[[Connoisseur|cognoscenti]]'', and she continued to thrive as a writer.

After this, d'Aragona returned to Rome from Florence, and little further is known about her life. She died in 1556 in Rome. After her death, there were posthumous editions of her work in Italian, in 1552, 1694, 1864, 1912, 1974, 1975 and 1980. Her work has been discussed in the [[University of Chicago]]'s "The Other Voice in Early Modern Europe" series, which deals with texts from [[Renaissance]] era female authors, as well as male advocates of women's emancipation from that era.

{{Universalism|expanded=all}}
'''Universalism''' is a theological and philosophical concept that some ideas have [[Universal (metaphysics)|universal]] application or applicability.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} A community that calls itself ''universalist'' may emphasize the universal principles of most religions, and accept others in an inclusive manner. It is centered around the belief in a universal reconciliation between humanity and the divine.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} For example, some forms of [[Abrahamic religions]] claim the universal value of their doctrine and moral principles, and "feel inclusive"{{huh|date=January 2018}}&lt;!--"claim universal value" is very different from "feel inclusive". What does the latter even mean?--&gt;.&lt;ref name='Schaff-Herzog'/&gt;

[[Christian Universalism]] is focused around the idea of [[universal reconciliation]]. Also known as universal salvation, it is a doctrine stating that every human soul will ultimately be reconciled to God because of divine love and mercy.&lt;ref&gt;Otis Ainsworth Skinner (1807-1861), ''A Series of Sermons in Defense of the Doctrine of Universal Salvation'', Page 209, It is not part of mainline Christian doctrine either Catholic or Protestant. "Repentance is a means by which all men are brought into the enjoyment of religion, and we do expect any man will be saved while he continues in sin. However, Unitarian Universalism holds a universal salvation, because is, "we expect all men will repent."&lt;/ref&gt;

A belief in one fundamental truth is another important tenet in Universalism.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} The living truth is seen as more far-reaching than the national, cultural, or religious boundaries or interpretations of that one truth. As the [[Rig Veda]] states, "Truth is one; sages call it by various names."&lt;ref&gt;[https://vedanta.org/what-is-vedanta/harmony-of-religions/ Vedanta Society of Southern California ''Harmony of Religions'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Universalism has had an influence on modern day [[Hinduism]], in turn influencing western modern spirituality.{{sfn|King|2002|p=}}{{Page needed|date=August 2017}}

[[Unitarian Universalism]] emphasizes that religion is a universal human quality, and also focuses on the universal principles of most religions. They accept all religions in an inclusive manner.

==Philosophy==
===Universality===
{{Main|Universality (philosophy)}}
In philosophy, universality is the notion that universal facts can be discovered and is therefore understood as being in opposition to [[relativism]].&lt;ref&gt;Bonnett, A. (2005). ''Anti-Racism''. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

In certain religions, universalism is the quality ascribed to an entity whose existence is consistent throughout the universe.

=== Moral universalism ===
{{Main|Moral universalism|Moral particularism}}
Moral universalism (also called ''moral objectivism'' or ''universal morality'') is the [[meta-ethics|meta-ethical]] position that some system of [[ethics]] are applied [[universality (philosophy)|universally]]. That system is inclusive of all individuals,&lt;ref name=PhilPages&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philosophypages.com/dy/u.htm#unvby |title=A Dictionary of Philosophical Terms and Names |work=Philosophy Pages |first=Garth|last=Kemerling |date=November 12, 2011 |quote=According to [http://www.philosophypages.com/ph/kant.htm Immanuel Kant] and [http://www.philosophypages.com/dy/h.htm#hare Richard Mervyn Hare]...moral imperatives must be regarded as equally binding on everyone.}}&lt;/ref&gt; regardless of [[culture]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[sex]], [[religion]], [[nationality]], [[sexual orientation]], or any other distinguishing feature.&lt;ref name=Gowans&gt;{{cite web |quote=Let us say that moral objectivism maintains that moral judgments are ordinarily true or false in an absolute or universal sense, that some of them are true, and that people sometimes are justified in accepting true moral judgments (and rejecting false ones) on the basis of evidence available to any reasonable and well-informed person. |first=Chris|last=Gowans |title=Moral Relativism |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2012 Edition) |editor=Edward N. Zalta, ed |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2012/entries/moral-relativism/ |date=Dec 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moral universalism is opposed to [[moral nihilism]] and [[moral relativism]]. However, not all forms of moral universalism are [[moral absolutism|absolutist]], nor do they necessarily [[value monism]]. Many forms of universalism, such as [[utilitarianism]], are non-absolutist. Other forms such as those theorized by [[Isaiah Berlin]], may [[value pluralism|value pluralist ideals.]]

==Religion==

===Bahá'í Faith===
{{Main|Bahá'í Faith and the unity of humanity|Bahá'í Faith and the unity of religion}}
In Bahá'í belief, a single God has sent all the historic founders of the world religions in a process of [[Progressive revelation (Bahá'í)|progressive revelation]]. As a result, the major world religions are seen as divine in origin and are continuous in their purpose. In this view, there is unity among the founders of world religions, but each revelation brings a more advanced set of teachings in human history and none are syncretic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Paradise and Paradigm: Key Symbols in Persian Christianity and the Bahá'í Faith |location=Albany |publisher=State University of New York Press |year=1999 |page=292 |last=Buck |first=Christopher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within this universal view, the unity of humanity is one of the central teachings of the Bahá'í Faith.&lt;ref name="Stockman"&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert |last=Stockman |title=Sourcebook of the World's Religions |isbn=1-57731-121-3 |publisher=New World Library |year=2000 |editor-first=Joel |editor-last=Beversluis|chapter=The Baha'i Faith |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bahá'í teachings]] state that since all humans have been created in the image of God, God does not make any distinction between people with regard to race, colour or religion.&lt;ref name="Smith138"&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Peter |year=2008 |title=An Introduction to the Baha'i Faith |publisher=Cambridge University Press |place=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-86251-5 |page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, because all humans have been created equal, they all require equal opportunities and treatment.&lt;ref name="Stockman" /&gt; Hence the Bahá'í view promotes the unity of humanity, and that people's vision should be world-embracing and that people should love the whole world rather than just their nation.&lt;ref name="Smith138" /&gt;

The teaching, however, does not equate unity with uniformity; instead the Bahá'í writings advocate the principle of ''unity in diversity'' where the variety in the human race is valued.&lt;ref name="Smith139"&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Peter |year=2008 |title=An Introduction to the Baha'i Faith |publisher=Cambridge University Press |place=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-86251-5 |page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Operating on a worldwide basis this cooperative view of the peoples and nations of the planet culminates in a vision of the practicality of the progression in world affairs towards, and the inevitability of, [[world peace]].&lt;ref name="Smith-peace"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Smith |first=Peter |encyclopedia=A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title=peace |year=2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location=Oxford |isbn=1-85168-184-1 |pages=266–267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
{{Main|Christian Universalism}}
The fundamental idea of Christian Universalism is [[universal reconciliation]] – that all humans will eventually be saved. They will eventually enter God's kingdom in Heaven, through the grace and works of the lord [[Jesus Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auburn.edu/~allenkc/chr-univ.html |title=What Is Christian Universalism? |publisher=Auburn.edu |date=|accessdate=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian Universalism teaches that an eternal [[Hell]] does not exist, and that it was not what Jesus had taught. They point to historical evidence showing that some early fathers of the church were universalists, and attribute the perpetuating idea of hell to eternal mistranslation.&lt;ref name="christianuniversalist.org"&gt;[http://christianuniversalist.org/resources/articles/salvation-conspiracy/ The Salvation Conspiracy: How Hell Became Eternal]&lt;/ref&gt;

Universalists cite numerous Biblical passages which reference the salvation of all beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gary Amirault |url=http://www.tentmaker.org/tracts/TheFateOfTheWicked.html |title=The Fate of the Wicked |publisher=Tentmaker.org |date= |accessdate=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, they argue that an eternal hell is both unjust, and against the nature and attributes of a loving God.&lt;ref&gt;Guild, E.E.

The remaining beliefs of Christian Universalism are generally compatible with the fundamentals of Christianity{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

====History====
{{See also|Universal reconciliation#History|l1=History of Universal Reconciliation}}
Universalist writers such as [[George T. Knight (Universalist)|George T. Knight]] have claimed that Universalism was a widely held view among theologians in [[Early Christianity]].&lt;ref name='Schaff-Herzog'&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/encyc12/Page_96.html [[George T. Knight (Universalist)|George T. Knight]] The Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge, 1953, vol. 12, p. 96; retrieved 30/04/09]&lt;/ref&gt; These included such important figures such as Alexandrian scholar [[Origen]] as well as [[Clement of Alexandria]], a Christian theologian. Origen and Clement both included the existence of a non-eternal Hell in their teachings. Hell was remedial, in that it was a place one went to purge one's sins before entering into Heaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stanrock.net/2015/05/20/purgatorial-hell-faq/ |title=Purgatorial Hell FAQ |publisher=StanRock.net |date= |accessdate=2016-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first undisputed documentations of Christian Universalist ideas occurred in 17th-century England and 18th-century Europe as well as in colonial America. Between 1648-1697 English activist [[Gerrard Winstanley]], writer [[Richard Coppin]], and dissenter [[Jane Leade]], each taught that God would grant all human beings salvation. The same teachings were later spread throughout 18th-century France and America by [[George de Benneville]]. People who taught this doctrine in America would later become known as the [[Universalist Church of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wyatt |first1=Neal |last2=Dwyer |first2=Tierney V |last3=Dwyer |first3=Tierney V |year=2008 |title=Unitarian Universalism: A Research Guide |url=|journal=Reference &amp; User Services Quarterly |volume=47 |issue=3|pages=210–214 |doi=10.5860/rusq.47n3.210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek term ''[[apocatastasis|apocatastas]]'' came to be related by some to the beliefs of [[Christian Universalism]], but central to the doctrine was the restitution, or restoration of all sinful beings to God, and to His state of blessedness.  In early [[Patristics]], usage of the term is distinct.

====Universalist theology====
{{Main|Christian Universalism}}
{{religious text primary|section|date=February 2012}}
Universalist theology is grounded in history, scripture and assumptions about the nature of God. [[Thomas Whittemore (Universalist)|Thomas Whittemore]] wrote the book "100 Scriptural Proofs that Jesus Christ Will Save All Mankind"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tentmaker.org/books/ScripturalProofs.html |title=100 Scriptural Proofs That Jesus Christ Will Save All Mankind |publisher=Tentmaker.org |date= |accessdate=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; quoting both Old and New Testament verses which support the Universalist viewpoint.

Some Bible verses he cites and are cited by other Christian Universalists are:
# 1 Corinthians 15:22&lt;ref name="Tent"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fate of the Wicked|url=http://www.tentmaker.org/tracts/TheFateOfTheWicked.html|work=tentmaker.org|publisher=Tentmaker|accessdate=29 June 2012|author=Tentmaker}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#* "For as in Adam '''ALL''' die, so also in Christ shall '''ALL''' be made alive." ([[English Standard Version|ESV]]; emphasis added)
# 2 Peter 3:9
#* "'''The Lord''' is not slow to fulfill his promise as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, '''not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance'''." (ESV; emphasis added)
# 1 Timothy 2:3–6&lt;ref name="Tent" /&gt;
#* "This is good, and pleases God our Savior, who '''wants all men to be saved''' and to come to a knowledge of the truth. For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for '''ALL''' men—the testimony given in its proper time." (NIV; emphasis added)
# 1 John 2:2
#* "He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world." (NIV)
# 1 Timothy 4:10&lt;ref name="Tent" /&gt;
#* "For to this end we toil and strive, because we have our hope set on the living God, who is the '''Savior of all people, especially of those who believe'''." (ESV; emphasis added)
# Romans 11:32&lt;ref name="Tent" /&gt;
#* "For God has bound all men over to disobedience so that he may have mercy on them all." (NIV)

====Mistranslations====
Christian Universalists point towards the mistranslations of the Greek word αιών (Lit. aion), as giving rise to the idea of Eternal Hell, and the idea that some people will not be saved.&lt;ref name="christianuniversalist.org" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tentmaker1"&gt;[http://www.tentmaker.org/articles/EternalPunishmentNotTrueToGreek.html "Eternal" Punishment (Matthew 25:46) Is NOT Found In The Greek New Testament.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://carm.org/look-word-aionion A look at the word "aionion"]&lt;/ref&gt;

This Greek word is the origin of the modern English word [[aeon]], which refers to a period of time or an epoch.

The 19th century theologian [[Marvin Vincent]] wrote about the word ''aion'', and the supposed connotations of "eternal" or "temporal":
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Aion''', transliterated '''''aeon''''', is a period of longer or shorter duration, having a beginning and an end, and complete in itself. [...] Neither the noun nor the adjective, in themselves, carry the sense of ''endless'' or ''everlasting''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vincent|first=Marvin|title=Note on Olethron Aionion (eternal destruction)|url=http://www.auburn.edu/~allenkc/vincent.html|work=Word Studies in the New Testament|accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dr. Ken Vincent writes that "When it (aion) was translated into Latin Vulgate, "aion" became "aeternam" which means "eternal".&lt;ref name="christianuniversalist.org"/&gt;

====New Thought====
{{Main|New Thought}}
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2012}}
[[Unity Church]], [[Religious Science]], and [[Divine Science]] are denominations within the New Thought movement. Each teaches that there is a common thread of truth at the heart of all religions. New Thought is an ever-evolving belief system which will incorporate ''Truth'' where ever it is found, hence the name ''New Thought''. ''All is God, But God transcends all''.

====Unitarian Universalism====
{{Main|Unitarian Universalism}}
Unitarian Universalism (UU) is a theologically liberal religion characterized by a "free and responsible search for truth and meaning".&lt;ref&gt;(The 4th principle of Unitarian Universalism)[http://www.uua.org/visitors/6798.shtml UUA.org Seven principles]&lt;/ref&gt; Unitarian Universalists do not share a [[creed]]; rather, they are unified by their shared search for [[spiritual growth]] and by the understanding that an individual's theology is a result of that search and not a result of obedience to an authoritarian requirement. Unitarian Universalists draw from all major world religions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html#Rastafarianism |title=Major Religions Ranked by Size |publisher=Adherents.com |date= |accessdate=April 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many different theological sources and have a wide range of beliefs and practices.

While having its origins in Christianity, UU is no longer a Christian church. As of 2006, fewer than about 20% of Unitarian Universalists identified themselves as Christian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ford |first=James Ishmael |title=Zen Master Who? |publisher=[[Wisdom Publications]] |year=2006 |page=187 |isbn=0-86171-509-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary Unitarian Universalism espouses a pluralist approach to religious belief, whereby members may describe themselves as [[Humanism|humanist]], agnostic, [[deist]], [[atheist]], pagan, Christian, [[monotheist]], [[pantheism|pantheist]], [[polytheist]], or assume no label at all.

The [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] (UUA) was formed in 1961, a consolidation of the [[American Unitarian Association]], established in 1825, and the Universalist Church of America,&lt;ref name="harvard1"&gt;Harvard Divinity School: [http://div.hds.harvard.edu/library/bms/merger_timeline_1900s.html Timeline of Significant Events in the Merger of the Unitarian and Universalist Churches During the 1900s]&lt;/ref&gt; established in 1866. It is headquartered in [[Boston]], and mainly serves churches in the United States. The [[Canadian Unitarian Council]] became an independent body in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;CUC-UUA Tradition. Canadian Unitarian Council [http://cuc.ca/who_we_are/cuc-uua_transition.htm Growing Vital Religious Communities In Canada]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Non-religious Universalism=====
Universalism is not only a set of values, but a worldview to which any can subscribe if they observe and believe in the universality of the human experience—and that of all sentient life—and work to uphold the principles, ethics, and actions that safeguard these fundamental things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unitarian Universalism |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/atheism/types/unitarianuniversalism.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, many Universalists may be attracted to the logic of universally applicable principles, rather than any belief or dogma. Human unity, solidarity, and the perceived need for a sustainable and socially conscious global order are among the tendencies of non-religious Universalist thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unitarian Universalism|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/u-u.htm|accessdate=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
Author David Frawley says that Hinduism has a "background universalism" and its teachings contain a "universal relevance."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haindavakeralam.com/pluralism-and-universalism-within-hinduism-david-frawley-hk5500 ''Pluralism and Universalism Within Hinduism''] "Hindu teachings were also denigrated accordingly and the deeper philosophies of Hinduism were often ignored, especially their universal relevance. For conversion purposes it was easier to define Hinduism in a limited way as a local phenomenon only. Yet the universality of Hindu teachings continued, though few outside of India understood this until recent years. This background universalism of Sanatana Dharma affords Hinduism a synthetic tendency, an ability to incorporate within itself a diversity of views and approaches, including at times those from groups outside of Hinduism or even opposed to Hinduism. Because of this syncretic view, sometimes Hinduism is equated with a blind universalism that accepts without discrimination anything that calls itself religious or spiritual, as if differences of spiritual teachings did not matter in any way. While this may be true of some Hindus, the Hindu tradition also contains a lively tradition of free debate on all aspects of theology, philosophy and metaphysics, showing differences as well as similarities, and not simply equating all teachings as they are. A good example of this is the debates between the dualistic and non-dualistic schools of Vedantic philosophy, but many other examples exist as well. The different sects within Hinduism have always been free to disagree, though each sect has its particular guidelines and there is an overall respect for Dharma."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hinduism]] is also naturally [[Religious pluralism|religiously pluralistic]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hafsite.org/hinduism-101/hinduism-basics Hindu American Foundation "Hinduism Basics"]&lt;/ref&gt; A well-known ''[[Rig Veda|Rig Vedic]]'' hymn says: "Truth is One, though the sages know it variously."&lt;ref&gt;Rig Veda 1.164.46&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in the ''[[Bhagavad Gita|Bhagavad Gītā]]'' (4:11), God, manifesting as an incarnation, states: "As people approach me, so I receive them. All paths lead to me."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=56UM3BIvbHYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=easwaran+1586380273&amp;lr=&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=as%20people%20approach%20me&amp;f=false Page 194] in [[Eknath Easwaran]] (2008).

Albany: State University of New York Press, p. 211. {{ISBN|0-87395-831-4}}, which translates the same passage as "They who, in whatever way, take refuge in Me, them I reward."&lt;/ref&gt; The Hindu religion has no theological difficulties in accepting degrees of truth in other religions. Hinduism emphasizes that everyone actually worships the same God, whether one knows it or not.&lt;ref&gt;See Swami Bhaskarananda, ''Essentials of Hinduism'' (Viveka Press 2002) {{ISBN|1-884852-04-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Hinduism has an openness and tolerance towards other religions, it also has a wide range of diversity within it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hafsite.org/hinduism-101/hinduism-basics Hindu American Foundation ''Hinduism Basics'' "It is a richly diverse family of philosophies, traditions, and practices that have been followed primarily throughout Asia for thousands of years."]&lt;/ref&gt; There are considered to be six orthodox Hindu schools of philosophy/theology,&lt;ref&gt;[http://veden-akademie.de/index.php?article_id=154&amp;clang=1 "Shat-darshana: The Philosophical Schools of Sanatana Dharma"]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as multiple unorthodox or "hetrodox" traditions called [[darshanas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clearias.com/indian-philosophy-schools/ ''Indian Philosophy: Orthodox and Heterodox Schools'']&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hindu Universalism====
{{Main|Neo-Vedanta|Hindu reform movements}}
''Hindu Universalism'', also called ''Neo-Vedanta''&lt;ref&gt;[http://bharatabharati.wordpress.com/2012/02/15/neo-vedanta-the-problem-with-hindu-universalism-frank-gaetano-morales/ Frank Morales, ''Neo-Vedanta: The problem with Hindu Universalism'']&lt;/ref&gt; and ''neo-Hinduism'',{{sfn|King|2002|p=93}} is a modern interpretation of Hinduism which developed in response to western colonialism and [[orientalism]]. It denotes the ideology that all religions are true and therefore worthy of toleration and respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=What Is Hinduism?: Modern Adventures Into a Profound Global Faith|year=2007|publisher=Himalayan Academy Publications|isbn=1934145009|page=416|author=Editors of Hinduism Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a modern interpretation that aims to present Hinduism as a "homogenized ideal of Hinduism"{{sfn|Yelle|2012|p=338}} with Advaita Vedanta as its central doctrine.{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}} For example, it presents that:
{{quote|... an imagined "integral unity" that was probably little more than an "imagined" view of the religious life that pertained only to a cultural elite and that empirically speaking had very little reality "on the ground," as it were, throughout the centuries of cultural development in the South Asian region.{{sfn|Larson|2012|p=313}}}}

Hinduism embraces universalism by conceiving the whole world as a single family that deifies the one truth, and therefore it accepts all forms of beliefs and dismisses labels of distinct religions which would imply a division of identity.&lt;ref&gt;(Rigveda 1:164:46) "Ekam sat vipra bahudha vadanti" - Truth is one; sages call it many names&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Maha Upanishad: Chapter 6, Verse 72) "[[Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam]]" - The entire world is a one big family&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Badlani |first=Hiro |title=Hinduism: Path of the Ancient Wisdom |publisher=[[iUniverse]] |year=2008 |page=303 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=8NrQhyxH-GgC |isbn=978-0-595-70183-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}

This modernised re-interpretation has become a broad current in Indian culture,{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}}{{sfn|Sinari|2000}} extending far beyond the [[Dashanami Sampradaya]], the Advaita Vedanta Sampradaya founded by [[Adi Shankara]]. An early exponent of Hindu Universalism was [[Ram Mohan Roy]], who established the [[Brahmo Samaj]].{{sfn|Ghazi|2010}} Hindu Universalism was popularised in the 20th century in both India and the west by [[Vivekananda]]{{sfn|Michaelson|2009|p=79-81}}{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}} and [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]].{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}} Veneration for all other religions was articulated by [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhi]]:
{{quote|After long study and experience, I have come to the conclusion that [1] all religions are true; [2] all religions have some error in them; [3] all religions are almost as dear to me as my own Hinduism, in as much as all human beings should be as dear to one as one's own close relatives. My own veneration for other faiths is the same as that for my own faith; therefore no thought of conversion is possible.&lt;ref&gt;M. K. Gandhi, ''All Men Are Brothers: Life and Thoughts of Mahatma Gandhi as told in his own words'', Paris, UNESCO 1958, p 60.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Western orientalists played an important role in this popularisation, regarding Vedanta to be the "central theology of Hinduism".{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}} Oriental scholarship portrayed Hinduism as a "single world religion",{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}} and denigrated the heterogeneousity of Hindu beliefs and practices as 'distortions' of the basic teachings of Vedanta.{{sfn|King|1999|p=135}}{{Citation not found}}

===Islam===
{{Further|Ummah|Divisions of the world in Islam|People of the Book|Dhimmi|Dawah|}}
{{Original Research|date=June 2018}}
Islam recognizes to a certain extent the validity of the [[Abrahamic religions]], the [[Quran]] identifying Jews, Christians, and "[[Sabians|Sabi'un]]" (usually taken as a reference to the [[Mandaeans]]) as "people of the Book" (''ahl al-kitab''). Later Islamic theologians expanded this definition to include [[Zoroastrians]], and later even Hindus, as the early Islamic empire brought many people professing these religions under its dominion, but the Qur'an explicitly identifies only Jews, Christians, and [[Sabians]] as People of the Book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crone|first=Patricia|title=God's Rule: Government and Islam: Six Centuries of Medieval Islamic Political Thought|year=2005|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-13291-6|page=472}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=November 2015}}&lt;sup&gt;, &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lapidus|first1=Ira M.|title=Ira M.

There are several views within Islam with respect to Universalism. According to the most inclusive teachings, common among the [[liberal Muslim movements]], all monotheistic religions or people of the book have a chance of salvation. For example, Surah 2:62,256 states that:&lt;ref&gt;1. S. A. Rahman, Punishment of Apostasy in Islam, Institute of Islamic Culture, Lahore, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=October 2017}}{{page needed|date=October 2017}} {{quote|Verily! Those who believe and those who are Jews and Christians, and Sabians, whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day and do righteous good deeds shall have their reward with their Lord, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve...let there be no compulsion in religion}}

However, the most exclusive teachings disagree. For example, the [[Salafi]] refer to Surah 9:5,29:{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} {{quote|Then, when the sacred months have passed, slay the idolaters [''mushrikun''] wherever ye find them, and take them, and besiege them, and lay in wait in every stratagem of war. But if they repent and establish worship and pay the ''Zakat'', then leave their way free. Lo!

The interpretation of all of these passages are hotly contested amongst various schools of thought, traditionalist and reform-minded, and branches of Islam, from the reforming [[Quranism]] and [[Ahmadiyya]] to the ultra-traditionalist [[Salafi]], as is the doctrine of abrogation (''[[Naskh (tafsir)|naskh]]'') which is used to determine which verses take precedence, based on reconstructed chronology, with later verses superseding earlier ones. The traditional chronology places Surah 9 as the last or second-to-last surah revealed, thus, in traditional exegesis, it gains a large power of abrogation, and verses 9:5,29,73 are held to have abrogated 2:256&lt;ref name="Ibn Kathir 2000 6608"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ibn Kathir|first=Ismail (1301-1373)|title=Tafsir al-Qur'an al-Aziz (Tafsir Ibn Kathir)|year=2000|publisher=Maktaba Darussalam|location=Riyadh, Saudi Arabia|isbn=978-1-59144-020-8|page=6608|edition=English Abridged|editor=Sheikh Safiur-Rahman Al-Mubarakpuri|language=English, Arabic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ahadith also play a major role in this, and different schools of thought assign different weightings and rulings of authenticity to different hadith, with the four schools of Sunni thought accepting the Six Authentic Collections, generally along with the [[Muwatta Imam Malik]]. Depending on the level of acceptance of rejection of certain traditions, the interpretation of the Koran can be changed immensely, from the Qur'anists and Ahmadiyya who reject the ahadith, to the Salafi, or ''ahl al-hadith'', who hold the entirety of the traditional collections in great reverence.

===Judaism===
{{Main|Jewish views on religious pluralism}}
{{See also|Noahidism}}
Judaism teaches that God [[Jews as the chosen people|chose the Jewish people]] to be in a unique covenant with God, and one of their beliefs is that Jewish people were charged by the [[Torah]] with a specific mission—to be a light unto the nations, and to exemplify the covenant with God as described in the Torah to other nations. This view does not preclude a belief that God also has a relationship with other peoples—rather, Judaism holds that God had entered into a covenant with all humanity as [[Noahidism|Noachides]], and that Jews and non-Jews alike have a relationship with God, as well as being universal in the sense that it is open to all mankind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Polish |first1=David |year=1985 |title=Covenant-Jewish Universalism and Particularism |journal=Judaism |volume=34 |issue=3 |page=284 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An on-line organization, the Jewish Spiritual Leaders Institute founded and led by [[Steven Blane]], who calls himself an "American Jewish Universalist Rabbi", believes in a more inclusive version of Jewish Universalism, stating that "God equally chose all nations to be lights unto the world, and we have much to learn and share with each other. We can only accomplish [[Tikkun Olam]] by our unconditional acceptance of each other's peaceful doctrines."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jewish Universalism|url=http://www.jsli.net/jewish-universalism|work=Jewish Spiritual Leaders Institute|publisher=Google Inc|accessdate=29 June 2012|author=Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manichaeism===
{{main|Manichaeism}}
Manichaeism, like Christian [[Gnosticism]] and [[Zurvanism]], was inherently universalist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Manichaeism in the Early Sasanian Empire|author=Manfred Hutter |date=January 1993|publisher=BRILL|jstor=3270395|volume=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2015}}

===Sikhism===
{{multiple issues|section=yes|
{{refimprove section|date=February 2012}}

}}
In [[Sikhism]], all the religions of the world are compared to rivers flowing into a single ocean. Although the [[Sikh gurus]] did not agree with the practices of [[fasting]], [[idolatry]] and pilgrimage during their times, they stressed that all religions should be tolerated and considered on equal footing. The Sikh scripture, the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], contains the writings of not just the Sikh guru themselves, but the writings of several Hindu and Muslim saints, known as the ''[[Bhagat]]s''. 

The very first word of the Sikh scripture is "Ik", followed by "Oh-ang-kar". This literally means that there is only one god, and that one is wholesome, inclusive of the whole universe. It further goes on to state that all of creation, and all energy is part of this primordial being. As such, it is described in scripture over and over again, that all that occurs is part of the divine will, and as such, has to be accepted. It occurs for a reason, even if its beyond the grasp of one person to understand.

Although Sikhism does not teach that men are created as an [[image of God]], it states that the essence of the One is to be found throughout all of its creation.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} As was said by Yogi Bhajan, the man who is credited with having brought Sikhism to the West:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"If you can't see God in all, you can't see God at all". (Sri Singh Sahib, Yogi Bhajan)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sikhdharma.org/about-the-siri-singh-sahib-yogi-bhajan/|title=About the Siri Singh Sahib – Sikh Dharma International|website=www.sikhdharma.org|access-date=2017-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The First Sikh Guru, [[Guru Nanak]] said himself:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"There is no Hindu, there is no Muslim".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sikhiwiki.org/index.php/There_is_no_Hindu_and_no_Musalman|title=There is no Hindu and no Musalman - SikhiWiki, free Sikh encyclopedia.|website=www.sikhiwiki.org|access-date=2016-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sikhs.org/guru1.htm|title=Sikhism Religion of the Sikh People|website=www.sikhs.org|access-date=2016-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gurmat.info/sms/smspublications/gurunanakforchildren/chapter4/#No%20Hindu,%20and%20no%20Muslim|title=Guru Nanak (for Children) - No Hindu, and no Muslim|last=Munde |first=Amarpreet Singh|website=www.gurmat.info|access-date=2016-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By this, Guru Nanak meant that there is no distinction between religion in God's eyes, whether polytheist, monotheist, [[pantheist]], or even atheist, all that one needs to gain salvation is purity of heart, tolerance of all beings, compassion and kindness. Unlike many of the major world religions, Sikhism does not have [[proselytism|missionaries]], instead it believes men have the freedom to find their own path to [[salvation]].

===Zoroastrianism===
{{main|Zoroastrianism}}
Some varieties of Zoroastrian (such as [[Zurvanism]]) are universalistic in application to all races, but not necessarily universalist in the sense of universal salvation.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Porter Berkey ''The formation of Islam: religion and society in the Near East'' 2003 p28 "This is not to say that there was no universalist dimension to Zoroastrian religious life; but what universalism there was derived directly, and to a greater degree than in the case of Rome and Christianity, from the explicit connection between religion and the state."&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=November 2015}}

==Critics==
In his book ''The Miracle of Theism: Arguments for and against the Existence of God'', the Australian philosopher [[J. L. Mackie]] noted that whilst in the past a miracle performed by Jesus had served as proof to Christians that he was the 'one true God', and that a miracle performed by another religion's deity had served as a (contradictory) proof to its own adherents, the universalist approach resulted in any such miracle being accepted as a validation of all religions, a situation that he characterised as "Miracle-workers of the world, unite!"&lt;ref name="Mackie"&gt;{{cite book |author-last1=Mackie |author-first1=J. L. |title=The Miracle of Theism: Arguments for and against the Existence of God |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |date=November 1982 |isbn=978-0198246824|quote="It is no longer 'The heathen in his blindness…', but rather 'We worship the same god, but under different names and in different ways’. Carried far enough, this modern tendency would allow Christian miracles to support, not undermine, belief in the supernatural achievements of stone-age witch doctors and medicine men, and vice versa. It is as if someone had coined the slogan, Miracle-workers of the world, unite!"|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Warm-glow giving''' is an economic theory describing the emotional reward of giving to others. According to the original warm-glow model developed by [[James Andreoni|Andreoni]] (1989, 1990),&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andreoni|first=James|date=1989|title=Giving with Impure Altruism: Applications to Charity and Ricardian Equivalence|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1833247|journal=Journal of Political Economy|volume=97|issue=6|pages=1447–1458}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andreoni|first=James|date=1990|title=Impure Altruism and Donations to Public Goods: A Theory of Warm-Glow Giving|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2234133|journal=The Economic Journal|volume=100|issue=401|pages=464–477|doi=10.2307/2234133}}&lt;/ref&gt; people experience a sense of joy and satisfaction for "doing their part" to help others. This satisfaction - or "''warm glow"'' - represents the selfish pleasure derived from "doing good", regardless of the actual impact of one's generosity. Within the warm-glow framework, people may be "impurely altruistic", meaning they simultaneously maintain both altruistic and egoistic (selfish) motivations for giving. Whereas "pure altruists" (sometimes referred to as "perfect altruists")&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kohler|first=Stefan|date=2011|title=Altruism and fairness in experimental decisions|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jebo.2011.02.014|journal=Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization|volume=80|issue=1|pages=101–109|doi=10.1016/j.jebo.2011.02.014|issn=0167-2681|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; are motivated solely by the desire to provide for a recipient, impure altruists are also motivated by the joy of giving (warm glow).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Importantly, warm glow is distinctly non-pecuniary,&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Valmont Effect: The Warm-Glow Theory of Philanthropy|last=Elster|first=Jon|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-19-973907-3|location=|pages=67-83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feddersen|first=Timothy|date=2009|title=The Foundations of Warm-Glow Theory|url=https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~mrostek/warm-glowd%2010-08-09.pdf|journal=Working Paper|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning it arises independent of the possibility of financial reward.

The normative theory of [[Ricardian equivalence]] suggests that private spending should be unresponsive to [[fiscal policy]] because forward-looking individuals smooth their consumption,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1048898019|title=Macroeconomics|last=R.,|first=Krugman, Paul|others=Wells, Robin, 1959-|isbn=9781319098759|edition=Fifth edition|location=New York, NY|oclc=1048898019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1027353872|title=Reflections on Ricardian Equivalence|last=J.|first=Barro, Robert|date=1996|publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research|oclc=1027353872}}&lt;/ref&gt; consistent with Modigliani's [[life-cycle hypothesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MODIGLIANI|first=FRANCO|date=1966|title=THE LIFE CYCLE HYPOTHESIS OF SAVING, THE DEMAND FOR WEALTH AND THE SUPPLY OF CAPITAL|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/40969831|journal=Social Research|volume=33|issue=2|pages=160–217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applied to the provision of charities or [[Public good|public goods]], Ricardian equivalence and the classical assumption of pure altruism together support the neutrality hypothesis,&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; implying perfect substitutability between private and public contributions.

Taken together, these findings offered a strong rebuke of the assumption that public grants crowd-out private donations to public goods.&lt;ref name=":242" /&gt;
=== Original model ===
Andreoni's economic model of impure altruism considers a simplistic world with only two goods: a [[private good]] and a [[public good]]. A given individual, endowed with wealth &lt;math&gt;(w_{i}),&lt;/math&gt;faces the [[budget constraint]]: &lt;math&gt;w_{i} = x_{i} + g_{i}, &lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math&gt;x_{i} &lt;/math&gt;represents consumption of a private good, and &lt;math&gt;g_{i}&lt;/math&gt;represents the contribution to the public good. To the extent that &lt;math&gt;g_i &lt;/math&gt;positively contributes to [[utility]], it may be interpreted as the degree of warm glow.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;It follows that the total provision of the public good, G, is simply: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i}^{n} (g_{i}),&lt;/math&gt;and the total contributions to the public good from all other individuals is denoted as: &lt;math&gt;G_{-i} = \sum_{i \ne j}^n(g_{j}).&lt;/math&gt;Thus, the public good is the sum of the &lt;math&gt;i^{th} &lt;/math&gt;person's contribution &lt;math&gt;(g_{i}),&lt;/math&gt;along with the total contributions of all other individuals &lt;math&gt;G_{-i}. &lt;/math&gt;

'''(1) &lt;math&gt;G = g_{i} + G_{-i},&lt;/math&gt;'''where &lt;math&gt;g_i \ge 0.&lt;/math&gt;

All individuals in this naïve economy face the same [[utility function]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, given by:

'''(2)'''&lt;math&gt;U_{i} = U_{i}(x_{i},G,g_{i}),&lt;/math&gt;

where the utility functions represent the utility for private, egoistic consumption &lt;math&gt;U_{i}(x_{i});&lt;/math&gt;the utility derived from the public good &lt;math&gt;U_{i}(G);&lt;/math&gt;and the warm-glow utility of the contribution towards the public good &lt;math&gt;U_{i}(g_{i}).&lt;/math&gt;An altruist should derive no additional utility from the act of giving: &lt;math&gt;U_{altruist} = f(x_i, G),&lt;/math&gt;whereas a pure egoist derives pleasure only from the warm glow of giving, without care for the public good itself, hence &lt;math&gt;U_{egoist} = f(x_i,g_i).&lt;/math&gt;

From the budget constraint and utility function, one can derive the utility maximization function, &lt;math&gt;max U_{i}(w_{i}+G_{-i}-G, G, G - G_{-i}),&lt;/math&gt;which is the original utility function '''(2)''' transformed using the definition of the public good '''(1)'''.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

=== Implications ===
Assuming a strategy of utility maximization, the model of warm glow offers many important economic predictions. Specifically, it presents three contrarian insights to those of classical economics under Ricardian equivalence.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; 

First, warm-glow theory predicts that income transfers will increase net giving only when income is transferred to more altruistic individuals. Second, it suggests that the provision of a public good is dependent upon the distribution of income within a population. Third, it suggests that public fund of public goods through lump-sum taxes will be more effective than relying upon altruism in the private sector.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Individually and collectively, these propositions are in stark contrast to the [[laissez-faire]] doctrine of Ricardian economics.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Following this original model, warm glow has conceptually evolved with new applications across disciplines to explain and encourage [[prosocial behavior]].&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andreoni|first=James|last2=Rao|first2=Justin|last3=Trachtman|first3=Hannah|date=2017|title=Avoiding the Ask: A Field Experiment on Altruism, Empathy, and Charitable Giving|url=|journal=Journal of Political Economy|volume=125|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Background in psychology ==
Many of the advances in warm glow research stem not from economics, but from psychology. In particular, research on motivations and affect have played a key role in defining and operationalizing warm glow for broad application.&lt;ref name=":103"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andreoni|first=James|last2=Rao|first2=Justin|last3=Trachtman|first3=Hannah|date=2017|title=Avoiding the Ask: A Field Experiment on Altruism, Empathy, and Charitable Giving|url=|journal=Journal of Political Economy|volume=125|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== A motivational perspective ===
''"...a millionaire does not really care whether his money does good or not, provided he finds his conscience eased and his social status improved by giving it away..." -George Bernard Shaw.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shaw|first=George Bernard|date=1896|title=Shaw On Socialism (1896)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.14452/mr-002-08-1950-12_5|journal=Monthly Review|volume=2|issue=8|pages=387|doi=10.14452/mr-002-08-1950-12_5|issn=0027-0520|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As illustrated in Shaw's quote, both intrinsic desires of conscience and extrinsic desires of social status may motivate giving.

==== Intrinsic warm glow ====
The most common and classically "correct" interpretation of warm glow is as a solely intrinsic phenomenon.&lt;ref name=":142"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Evren|first=Ozgur|last2=Minardi|first2=Stefania|date=2013|title=Warm-Glow Giving and Freedom to Be Selfish|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2347111|journal=SSRN Electronic Journal|doi=10.2139/ssrn.2347111|issn=1556-5068}}&lt;/ref&gt; Language referring to the "joy of giving",&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andreoni|first=James|date=1989|title=Giving with Impure Altruism: Applications to Charity and Ricardian Equivalence|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1833247|journal=Journal of Political Economy|volume=97|issue=6|pages=1447–1458}}&lt;/ref&gt; "the positive emotional experience from the act of helping others",&lt;ref name=":132"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van der Linden|first=Sander|date=2015|title=Intrinsic motivation and pro-environmental behaviour|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nclimate2669|journal=Nature Climate Change|volume=5|issue=7|pages=612–613|doi=10.1038/nclimate2669|issn=1758-678X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "the moral satisfaction of helping others"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Winterich|first=Karen Page|last2=Barone|first2=Michael J|date=2011|title=Warm Glow or Cold, Hard Cash?

==== Extrinsic warm glow ====
Much of the ambiguity surrounding the motivational processes of warm glow has arisen from the misclassification of extrinsic rewards to intrinsic processes.&lt;ref name=":72"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Valmont Effect: The Warm-Glow Theory of Philanthropy|last=Elster|first=Jon|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-19-973907-3|location=|pages=67-83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":27"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tonin|first=Mirco|last2=Vlassopoulos|first2=Michael|date=2010|title=Disentangling the sources of pro-socially motivated effort: A field experiment|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpubeco.2010.08.011|journal=Journal of Public Economics|volume=94|issue=11-12|pages=1086–1092|doi=10.1016/j.jpubeco.2010.08.011|issn=0047-2727|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While intrinsic desires center upon emotional gains, extrinsic rewards may include recognition, identity signaling, and prestige. Extrinsic motivation may also take the form of punishment (negative warm glow), in the form of censure or blame&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ryan|first=Richard M.|last2=Deci|first2=Edward L.|date=2000|title=Self-determination theory and the facilitation of intrinsic motivation, social development, and well-being.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0003-066X.55.1.68|journal=American Psychologist|language=en|volume=55|issue=1|pages=68–78|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.55.1.68|issn=1935-990X}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Some research has explicitly focused on extrinsic warm glow, such as "relational warm glow".&lt;ref name=":30"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scharf|first=Kimberley|last2=Smith|first2=Sarah|date=2016|title=Relational altruism and giving in social groups|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpubeco.2016.06.001|journal=Journal of Public Economics|volume=141|pages=1–10|doi=10.1016/j.jpubeco.2016.06.001|issn=0047-2727|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One area that has been frequently confused in the literature involves the classification of guilt, which is an introjected form of extrinsic motivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gagné|first=Marylène|last2=Deci|first2=Edward L.|date=2005-04-14|title=Self-determination theory and work motivation|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/job.322|journal=Journal of Organizational Behavior|volume=26|issue=4|pages=331–362|doi=10.1002/job.322|issn=0894-3796}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Importance of motivational classification ====
The classification of warm glow as either intrinsic or extrinsic has important ramifications for policy makers.&lt;ref name=":122"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=D'Amato|first=Alessio|last2=Mancinelli|first2=Susanna|last3=Zoli|first3=Mariangela|date=2014|title=Two Shades of (Warm) Glow: multidimensional intrinsic motivation, waste reduction and recycling|url=http://www.sustainability-seeds.org/papers/RePec/srt/wpaper/2114.pdf|journal=Working Paper|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extensive body of literature on [[Motivation crowding theory|motivational crowding out]] suggests the efficacy of policies promoting altruistic behavior may be a function of whether pre-existing behavior is intrinsically or extrinsically motivated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frey|first=Bruno S.|last2=Jegen|first2=Reto|date=2001|title=Motivation Crowding Theory|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1467-6419.00150|journal=Journal of Economic Surveys|volume=15|issue=5|pages=589–611|doi=10.1111/1467-6419.00150|issn=0950-0804|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Citation|last=Deci|first=Edward L.|title=Conceptualizations of Intrinsic Motivation and Self-Determination|date=1985|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4899-2271-7_2|work=Intrinsic Motivation and Self-Determination in Human Behavior|pages=11–40|publisher=Springer US|isbn=9781489922731|access-date=2018-11-09|last2=Ryan|first2=Richard M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extent to which extrinsic incentives may be substitutes for intrinsic motivations depends upon the motivational classification of the warm glow model. Furthermore, intrinsic warm glow may be more resilient to satiation effects than extrinsic warm glow.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tonin|first=Mirco|last2=Vlassopoulos|first2=Michael|date=2013-03-27|title=An experimental investigation of intrinsic motivations for giving|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11238-013-9360-9|journal=Theory and Decision|volume=76|issue=1|pages=47–67|doi=10.1007/s11238-013-9360-9|issn=0040-5833}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the expected magnitude of a warm glow will be a function of how it is characterized. Models assuming a purely intrinsic warm glow should report lesser warm glows than models also including extrinsic components.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

=== Empathy and the psychological determinants of warm glow ===
[[File:Empathy_-_Design_Thinking.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Empathy_-_Design_Thinking.png|thumb|Empathy - Design Thinking]]
The phenomenon of warm-glow giving was originally introduced as an economic model.&lt;ref name=":110"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andreoni|first=James|date=1989|title=Giving with Impure Altruism: Applications to Charity and Ricardian Equivalence|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1833247|journal=Journal of Political Economy|volume=97|issue=6|pages=1447–1458}}&lt;/ref&gt; It its original form, the warm-glow model lacked a satisfactory explanation for the underlying psychological processes.&lt;ref name=":102"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andreoni|first=James|last2=Rao|first2=Justin|last3=Trachtman|first3=Hannah|date=2017|title=Avoiding the Ask: A Field Experiment on Altruism, Empathy, and Charitable Giving|url=|journal=Journal of Political Economy|volume=125|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early studies of warm glow were deliberately vague in attributing the experience to a cause.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/934199169|title=The economics of philanthropy and fundraising|last=editor.|first=Andreoni, James,|isbn=9781784713232|oclc=934199169}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent body of research has identified several important determinants of warm glow, including social distance,&lt;ref name=":222"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bohnet|first=Iris|last2=Frey|first2=Bruno S|date=1999|title=The sound of silence in prisoner's dilemma and dictator games|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0167-2681(98)00121-8|journal=Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization|volume=38|issue=1|pages=43–57|doi=10.1016/s0167-2681(98)00121-8|issn=0167-2681|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Small|first=Deborah A.|last2=Loewenstein|first2=George|date=2003|title=Help a Victim or Helping the Victim: Altruism and Identifiability|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/a:1022299422219|journal=Journal of Risk and Uncertainty|volume=26|issue=1|pages=5–16|doi=10.1023/a:1022299422219|issn=0895-5646|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; vividness to the beneficiary, and guilt avoidance&lt;ref name=":102" /&gt;.

==== Social distance ====
[[Social distance]] is an important determinant of warm glow, particularly in the framework of empathy.&lt;ref name=":192" /&gt; Prior research has examined the link between emotional arousal and social distance, finding that mutual suffering and shared joy both increase as a function of social similarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krebs|first=Dennis|date=1975|title=Empathy and altruism.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037//0022-3514.32.6.1134|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=32|issue=6|pages=1134–1146|doi=10.1037//0022-3514.32.6.1134|issn=0022-3514}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consistent with the "[[identifiable victim effect]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=JENNI|first=KAREN|last2=LOEWENSTEIN|first2=GEORGE|date=1997|title=Explaining the identifiable victim effect|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/a:1007740225484|journal=Journal of Risk and Uncertainty|volume=14|issue=3|pages=235–257|doi=10.1023/a:1007740225484|issn=0895-5646|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; research has shown that people express a greater willingness to help when others are known, as opposed to statistical.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;
==== Vividness to beneficiary ====
While the vividness of the beneficiary is captured in social distance,&lt;ref name=":222" /&gt; the vividness to the beneficiary refers to a beneficiary's ability to perceive that kindness has been done upon them. As a determinant of warm glow, vividness to the beneficiary operates on two levels. The primary level concerns whether a beneficiary is aware that kindness has been given to them, absent any attribution of the source. The secondary level involves the identifiability of the benefactor. Warm glow should be positively impacted by both levels for vividness.&lt;ref name=":102" /&gt; 

==== Guilt ====
Recent work has identified guilt avoidance as an important component of warm glow.&lt;ref name=":102" /&gt; Some have even compared guilt as the "flip side" of warm glow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Giebelhausen|first=Michael|last2=Chun|first2=HaeEun Helen|last3=Cronin|first3=J.

Resolving this feeling comes either by giving and feeling good or by not giving and feeling guilt."''&lt;ref name=":102" /&gt; In other notable overviews of warm glow, this phenomenon has been characterized as "personal distress"&lt;ref name=":172"&gt;{{Citation|last=Singer|first=Peter|title=What Should a Billionaire Give—and What Should You?|date=2011-01-13|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199739073.003.0002|work=Giving Well|pages=13–24|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199739073|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In surveys of self-reported guilt, people experience roughly as much interpersonal and societal guilt as they do personal guilt. Furthermore, half of the survey respondents prefer to directly address and resolve their feelings of guilt. Taken together, these findings suggest a substantial component of guilt aversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dahl|first=Darren W.|last2=Honea|first2=Heather|last3=Manchanda|first3=Rajesh V.|date=2003|title=The Nature of Self-Reported Guilt in Consumption Contexts|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/a:1027492516677|journal=Marketing Letters|volume=14|issue=3|pages=159–171|doi=10.1023/a:1027492516677|issn=0923-0645|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Business ===

==== Corporate social responsibility ====
Supporting businesses engaged in [[corporate social responsibility]] (CSR) initiatives may give consumers a vicarious warm glow. However, recent research suggests that consumers may expect to overpay when companies engage in CSR due to perceptions of price fairness. The implication that "doing good" carries a financial burden for businesses leads consumers to infer general price markups. This body of research cautions that corporate warm glows may be coupled with "cold prickles" of extra costs.&lt;ref name=":292"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Habel|first=Johannes|last2=Schons|first2=Laura Marie|last3=Alavi|first3=Sascha|last4=Wieseke|first4=Jan|date=2016|title=Warm Glow or Extra Charge?

==== Avoidance behaviors ====
[[File:IYC_Women_Bell_Ringers_2016_(31029903216).jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:IYC_Women_Bell_Ringers_2016_(31029903216).jpg|alt=|left|thumb|"Negative" warm glow may explain why empathetic individuals actively avoid charitable opportunities]]
Common phenomena such as avoiding eye contact with beggars or adjusting one's route to avoid a solicitor may be explained using the warm glow model.

One behavioral consequence of warm glow is strategic avoidance of giving opportunities. According to this hypothesis, individuals anticipate their warm glow upon identifying a future giving opportunity. Assuming a functional form that allows warm glow to be negative (driven by a ''guilt'' of not giving), people may strategically and effortfully avoid giving situations. The strategic incentive is easily understood through the utility function &lt;math&gt;U_i = U_{i}(x_{i},G,g_{i}), &lt;/math&gt;where the warm glow &lt;math&gt;(g_i),&lt;/math&gt;is positive for a donation (joy of giving) and negative for not giving (guilt). For an agent who would suffer a disutility of giving at their desired level &lt;math&gt;(g_i^*)&lt;/math&gt;because the marginal utility of private expenditure &lt;math&gt;(x_i)&lt;/math&gt;exceeds the marginal utility of warm-glow giving, they should prefer to give nothing &lt;math&gt;(g_i^0).&lt;/math&gt;Because giving nothing may be associated with guilt, the utility of &lt;math&gt;(g_i^0)&lt;/math&gt;will be negative. Therefore, for a rational agent who cannot justify giving, &lt;math&gt;U_i(x_i,G,g_i^*) &lt; U_i(x_i,G,g_i^0)       &lt;/math&gt;, can maximize their utility through avoiding a giving situation, effectively dropping the warm glow argument from their utility functions.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Thus, &lt;math&gt;U_i(x_i,G,g_i^*) &lt; U_i(x_i,G,g_i^0) &lt; U_i(x_i, G, 0)&lt;/math&gt;suggests avoidance of giving opportunities is a preferred strategy for individuals who experience guilt as a negative warm glow. Economic models assign a cost of effort to avoidance, and predict that people will incur such effort whenever &lt;math&gt;U_{i0} - c_i &gt; U_{is},&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math&gt;U_{i0}&lt;/math&gt;is the utility of not giving, &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt;is the cost of avoidance, and &lt;math&gt;U_{is}&lt;/math&gt;is the utility of giving to a solicitor, conditional upon not avoiding.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; 

Through this lens, avoidance can be viewed as an economic [[commitment device]], where a person commits to avoiding a situation (being asked to give) in which they are likely to surrender to temptation (giving). Central to this avoidance hypothesis is that individuals can anticipate their behavior in high-empathy "hot states", while in low-empathy "cold states". While this model assumes a high degree of sophistication on the part of the individual, research by Andreoni, Rao, and Trachtman explores this very phenomenon by observing avoidance and donation behavior of customers entering a supermarket during the holidays. Customers often walked to a further entrance to avoid solicitors for the Salvation Army. According to their model, "empathetically vulnerable" individuals who are not be able to give (for budgetary reasons), faced the greatest incentive to avoid collectors because of the guilt they would experience upon saying "no".&lt;ref name=":52"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/934199169|title=The economics of philanthropy and fundraising|last=editor.|first=Andreoni, James,|isbn=9781784713232|oclc=934199169}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==== Grouping behaviors ====
Charities may strategically employ categorical [[Donor recognition wall|donor recognition]]. For example, a charitable organization may distinguish any gift between $500-$999.99 by a title distinct from that awarded for gifts above $1,000. As a consequence, the social signaling component of the warm-glow effect (in extrinsic operationalizations of warm glow) suggests individuals should be motivated to make the minimum donation to acquire their desired categorical status. Consistent with this hypothesis, research has indicated significant grouping behavior of donors around category minimums.&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harbaugh|first=William T|date=1998|title=What do donations buy?|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0047-2727(97)00062-5|journal=Journal of Public Economics|volume=67|issue=2|pages=269–284|doi=10.1016/s0047-2727(97)00062-5|issn=0047-2727|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==== Inefficiency in charitable allocation ====

A majority of those who choose to give some portion of their wealth to charity support multiple different causes. Rather than giving 100% of their cumulative donations to the same source, there exists a widespread preference to distribute funds across charities.&lt;ref name=":173"&gt;{{Citation|last=Singer|first=Peter|title=What Should a Billionaire Give—and What Should You?|date=2011-01-13|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199739073.003.0002|work=Giving Well|pages=13–24|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199739073|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The warm glow model explains this be recognizing that givers receive multiple warm glows by giving to multiple causes, thus supporting the preference to make many smaller contributions. As a consequence, some scholars suggest an efficiency loss due to high volumes of small donations - which are less efficient to process - rather than fewer large donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Null|first=C.|date=2011|title=Warm glow, information, and inefficient charitable giving|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpubeco.2010.06.018|journal=Journal of Public Economics|volume=95|issue=5-6|pages=455–465|doi=10.1016/j.jpubeco.2010.06.018|issn=0047-2727|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moral philosopher [[Peter Singer]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;mentions warm-glow givers in his 2015 book, ''[[The Most Good You Can Do]]''. Singer states that these types of donors "give small amounts to many charities [and] are not so interested in whether what they are doing helps others." He references "empathetic concern" and "personal distress" as two distinct components of warm-glow givers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Most Good You Can Do: How Effective Altruism Is Changing Ideas About Living Ethically.|last=Singer|first=Peter|publisher=New Haven: Yale University Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=pp. 5, 6, 77–80, 90.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Inefficiency in charitable selection ====

Warm glow may offer an explanation for some of the observed inefficiencies in charitable giving. For example, United States citizens directed more than 60% of their total charitable contributions to religious groups, education institutions, art organizations, and foundations in 2017; compared to under 7% in foreign aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://givingusa.org|title=Giving USA {{!}} A public service initiative of the Giving Institute|website=givingusa.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to models of social justice&lt;ref name=":173" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.globalpolicyjournal.com/blog/24/02/2014/donors%E2%80%99-dilemma-charity-social-justice|title='The Donors’ Dilemma' - From Charity to Social Justice {{!}} Global Policy Journal|website=www.globalpolicyjournal.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and economic [[Quality-adjusted life year|QALY]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s,&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; in which human lives are treated with equal dignity and equal respect - regardless of race, gender, or place of origin - the goal of charity should be to fight global poverty. Similarly, economic models, which attempt to place a monetary value on the human life&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobalist.com/the-cost-of-a-human-life-statistically-speaking/|title=The Cost of a Human Life, Statistically Speaking - The Globalist|date=2012-07-21|work=The Globalist|access-date=2018-11-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, highlight the inefficiency of all philanthropy not used to combat global poverty, which offers the highest marginal return.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/987462476|title=Doing good better effective altruism and a radical new way to make a difference|last=VerfasserIn.|first=MacAskill, William,|isbn=9781783350513|oclc=987462476}}&lt;/ref&gt; The warm-glow model accounts for such inefficiency because impure altruists may be insensitive to the actual cause, and more sensitive to the act of giving or size of the gift. Thus, warm-glow may generate philanthropic inefficiencies to the extent that it desensitizes potential donors to the marginal impact of a given charity. In response to this concern, [[William MacAskill|Willian MacAskill]] and colleagues have advanced a process of philanthropic allocation called "[[effective altruism]]".&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; This methodology seeks to leverage logic and responsibility to identify effective charitable opportunities, thus minimizing the effect of warm-glow in the decision-making process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.psychologicalscience.org/publications/observer/obsonline/the-warm-glow-of-giving-may-overshadow-doing-the-greatest-good.html|title=The “Warm Glow” of Giving May Overshadow Doing the Greatest Good|work=Association for Psychological Science|access-date=2018-11-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Doing good better : how effective altruism can help you help others, do work that matters, and make smarter choices about giving back|last=2016|first=MacAskill, William,|publisher=|year=|isbn=1592409660|location=New York, N.Y.|pages=|oclc=932001639}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
=== Ad-hoc ===
A common criticism of the warm-glow paradigm is that it seems ad-hoc. Indeed, Andreoni, the father of the original model, stated that "putting warm-glow into the model is, while intuitively appealing, an admittedly ''ad hoc'' fix".&lt;ref name=":28"&gt;{{Citation|last=Andreoni|first=James|title=Chapter 18 Philanthropy|date=2006|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S1574-0714(06)02018-5|work=Handbook of the Economics of Giving, Altruism and Reciprocity|pages=1201–1269|publisher=Elsevier|doi=10.1016/s1574-0714(06)02018-5|isbn=9780444521453|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the body of research has evolved over nearly 30 years - incorporating philosophical,&lt;ref name=":173" /&gt; psychological,&lt;ref name=":232"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Small|first=Deborah A.|last2=Loewenstein|first2=George|date=2003|title=Help a Victim or Helping the Victim: Altruism and Identifiability|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/a:1022299422219|journal=Journal of Risk and Uncertainty|volume=26|issue=1|pages=5–16|doi=10.1023/a:1022299422219|issn=0895-5646|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and physiological insights&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; - it has become a better descriptive model of behavior.&lt;ref name=":104"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andreoni|first=James|last2=Rao|first2=Justin|last3=Trachtman|first3=Hannah|date=2017|title=Avoiding the Ask: A Field Experiment on Altruism, Empathy, and Charitable Giving|url=|journal=Journal of Political Economy|volume=125|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Self-delusion ===
An obscure criticism of the warm-glow paradigm is that it necessitates self-deception.&lt;ref name=":74" /&gt; This argument states that in order to reap the emotional reward of helping others, one must believe his actions to be motivated altruistically. Yet, the mere existence of a warm glow should then contradict the belief of pure altruism. A question arises as to whether prolonged self-delusion is sustainable and impervious to learning through [[Self-perception theory|self-perception]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bem|first=Daryl J.|date=1967|title=Self-perception: An alternative interpretation of cognitive dissonance phenomena.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/h0024835|journal=Psychological Review|volume=74|issue=3|pages=183–200|doi=10.1037/h0024835|issn=1939-1471}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Zhuangzi''''' (&lt;small&gt;Mandarin:&lt;/small&gt; {{IPAc-cmn|zh|uang|1|.|z|^|3}}; historically romanized '''''Chuang-tzu''''') is an ancient Chinese text from the late [[Warring States period]] (476{{ndash}}221{{sbc}}) which contains stories and anecdotes that exemplify the carefree nature of the ideal [[Daoist]] sage.  Named for its traditional author, "Master Zhuang" ([[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]]), the ''Zhuangzi'' is{{mdash}}along with the ''[[Tao Te Ching]]''{{mdash}}one of the two foundational texts of [[Daoism]], and is generally considered the most important of all Daoist writings.

The ''Zhuangzi'' consists of a large collection of anecdotes, allegories, parables, and fables, which are often humorous or irreverent in nature.  Its main themes are of spontaneity in action and of freedom from the human world and its conventions. The fables and anecdotes in the text attempt to illustrate the falseness of human distinctions between good and bad, large and small, life and death, and human and nature. While other ancient Chinese philosophers focused on moral and personal duty, Zhuangzi promoted carefree wandering and becoming one with "the Way" (''Dào'' 道) by following nature.

Though primarily known as a philosophical work, the ''Zhuangzi'' is regarded as one of the greatest literary works in all of Chinese history, and has been called "the most important pre-[[Qin dynasty|Qin]] text for the study of Chinese literature." A masterpiece of both philosophical and literary skill, it has significantly influenced writers for more than 2000 years from the [[Han dynasty]] (206{{sbc}}{{ndash}}AD{{nbsp}}220) to the present.  Many major Chinese writers and poets in history—such as [[Sima Xiangru]] and [[Sima Qian]] during the Han dynasty, [[Ruan Ji]] and [[Tao Yuanming]] during the [[Six Dynasties]] (222{{ndash}}589), [[Li Bai]] during the [[Tang dynasty]] (618{{ndash}}907), and [[Su Shi]] and [[Lu You]] in the [[Song dynasty]] (960{{ndash}}1279)—were heavily influenced by the ''Zhuangzi''.

==History==
===Authorship and textual history===
The ''Zhuangzi'' is named for and attributed to [[Zhuang Zhou]]{{mdash}}usually known as "Master Zhuang" ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: "Zhuangzi" 莊子){{mdash}}a man generally said to have been born around 369{{sbc}} at a place called Meng ({{lang|zh|蒙}}) in the [[Song (state)|state of Song]] (around modern [[Shangqiu]], [[Henan Province]]), and to have died around 301, 295, or 286{{sbc}}.{{sfnp|Mair|1998|p=21}}{{sfnp|Mair|1994|p=xxxi}}{{sfnp|Knechtges|2014|p=2314}}{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2015|p=697}} Almost nothing is concretely known of Zhuangzi's life.  He is thought to have spent time in the southern [[Chu (state)|state of Chu]], as well as in [[Ancient Linzi|Linzi]], the capital of the [[Qi (state)|state of Qi]].{{sfnp|Mair|1994|p=xxxi}} [[Sima Qian]]'s [[Records of the Grand Historian|''Records of the Grand Historian'' (''Shiji'' 史記)]], the first of China's [[Ershisi shi|24 dynastic histories]], has a biography of Zhuangzi, but most of it seems to have simply been drawn from anecdotes in the ''Zhuangzi'' itself.{{sfnp|Mair|1994|p=xxxi-xxxiii}} The American scholar and ''Zhuangzi'' translator [[Burton Watson]] noted, "Whoever Zhuang Zhou was, the writings attributed to him bear the stamp of a brilliant and original mind."{{sfnp|Watson|2003|p=3}}

Scholars have recognized since at least the [[Song dynasty]] (960{{ndash}}1279) that some parts of the book could not have been written by Zhuangzi himself.{{sfnp|Roth|1993|p=56}}  Since ancient times, however, its first seven chapters{{mdash}}the ''nèi piān'' 內篇 "inner chapters"{{mdash}}have been considered to be the actual work of Zhuangzi, and most modern scholars agree with this view.{{sfnp|Roth|1993|p=56}} How many, if any, of the remaining 26 chapters{{mdash}}the ''wài piān'' 外篇 "outer chapters" and ''zá piān'' 雜篇 "miscellaneous chapters"{{mdash}}were written by Zhuangzi has long been debated.{{sfnp|Knechtges|2014|p=2315}}  It is generally accepted that the middle and later ''Zhuangzi'' chapters are the result of a subsequent process of "accretion and redaction" by later authors "responding to the scintillating brilliance" of the inner chapters.{{sfnp|Mair|1998|p=21}}  All of the 33 surviving chapters are accepted as compositions from the 4th to 2nd centuries BC.{{sfnp|Kern|2010|p=74}}

Details of the ''Zhuangzi''{{'}}s textual history prior to the [[Han dynasty]] (206{{sbc}}{{snd}}AD{{nbsp}}220) are largely unknown.  Traces of its influence in late [[Warring States period]] (475{{ndash}}221{{sbc}}) philosophical texts such as the ''[[Guanzi (text)|Guanzi]]'', ''[[Han Feizi (book)|Han Feizi]]'', ''[[Huainanzi]]'', and ''[[Lüshi Chunqiu]]'' suggest that Zhuangzi's intellectual lineage was already fairly influential in the states of [[Qi (state)|Qi]] and [[Chu (state)|Chu]] in the 3rd century{{sbc}}.{{sfnp|Mair|2000|p=33}} The ''Records of the Grand Historian'' refers to a 100,000-word ''Zhuangzi'' work and references several chapters that are still in the text.{{sfnp|Roth|1993|p=57}}  The [[Book of Han|''Book of Han'' (''Han shu'' 漢書)]], finished in AD 111, lists a ''Zhuangzi'' in 52 chapters, which many scholars believe to be the original form of the work.{{sfnp|Roth|1993|p=58}} A number of different forms of the ''Zhuangzi'' survived into the [[Tang dynasty]] (618{{ndash}}907), but a shorter and more popular 33-chapter form of the book prepared by the philosopher and writer [[Guo Xiang]] around AD 300 is the source of all surviving editions.{{sfnp|Roth|1993|p=58}} In 742, the ''Zhuangzi'' was canonized as one of the [[Chinese Classics]] by an imperial proclamation from [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang]], which awarded it the honorific title ''True Scripture of Southern Florescence'' (''Nanhua zhenjing'' 南華真經),{{sfnp|Mair|1994|p=xxxi}} though most orthodox scholars did not consider the ''Zhuangzi'' to be a true "classic" (''jing'' {{lang|zh|經}}) due to its non-Confucian nature.{{sfnp|Goldin|2001|p=87}}

===Manuscripts===
[[File:Zhuangzi Tian Yun Ms.JPG|upright=1.1|thumb|Tang dynasty ''Zhuangzi'' manuscript preserved in Japan (1930s replica)]]

Portions of the ''Zhuangzi'' have been discovered among bamboo slip texts from Warring States period and [[Han dynasty]] tombs, particularly at the [[Shuanggudui]] and [[Zhangjiashan Han bamboo texts]] sites.{{sfnp|Knechtges|2014|p=2315}}  One of the slips from the [[Guodian Chu slips|Guodian bamboo texts]], which date to around 300 BC, contains what appears to be a short fragment from the "Ransacking Coffers" ("Qu qie" 胠篋) chapter.{{sfnp|Knechtges|2014|p=2315}}

A large number of ''Zhuangzi'' fragments dating from the early Tang dynasty were discovered among the [[Dunhuang manuscripts]] in the early 20th century by the expeditions of Hungarian-British explorer [[Aurel Stein]] and French Sinologist [[Paul Pelliot]].{{sfnp|Roth|1993|pp=61-62}} They collectively form about twelve chapters of Guo Xiang's version of the ''Zhuangzi'', and are preserved mostly at the [[British Library]] and the [[Bibliothèque Nationale de France]].{{sfnp|Roth|1993|p=62}} 

Among the Japanese national treasures preserved in the [[Kōzan-ji]] temple in [[Kyoto]] is a ''Zhuangzi'' manuscript from the [[Muromachi period]] (1338{{ndash}}1573).{{sfnp|Roth|1993|p=62}} The manuscript has seven complete chapters from the "outer" and "miscellaneous" chapters, and is believed to be a close copy of an annotated edition written in the 7th century by the Chinese [[Daoist]] master Cheng Xuanying (成玄英; fl. 630&amp;ndash;660).{{sfnp|Roth|1993|p=62}}

==Content==
{{Asian philosophy sidebar}}
Almost all of the 33 surviving ''Zhuangzi'' chapters contain fables and allegories.{{sfnp|Mair|1998|p=23}} Most ''Zhuangzi'' stories are fairly short and simple, such as "Lickety" and "Split" drilling seven holes in "[[Hundun|Wonton]]" (chapter 7) or Zhuangzi being discovered sitting and drumming on a basin after his wife dies (chapter 18), although a few are longer and more complex, like the story of Master Lie and the [[magus]] (chapter 14) and the account of the [[Yellow Emperor]]'s music (chapter 14).{{sfnp|Mair|1998|p=23}} Unlike the other stories and allegories in other pre-[[Qin dynasty|Qin]] texts, the ''Zhuangzi'' is unique in that the allegories form the bulk of the text, rather than occasional features, and are always witty, emotional, and are not limited to reality.{{sfnp|Mair|1998|p=23}}

Unlike other ancient Chinese works, whose allegories were usually based on historical legends and proverbs, most ''Zhuangzi'' stories seem to have been invented by Zhuangzi himself.  Some are completely whimsical, such as the strange description of evolution from "misty spray" through a series of substances and insects to horses and humans (chapter 18), while a few other passages seem to be "sheer playful nonsense" which read like [[Lewis Carroll]]'s "[[Jabberwocky]]".{{sfnp|Mair|1998|pp=23-24}} The ''Zhuangzi'' is full of quirky and fantastic characters, such as "Mad Stammerer", "Fancypants Scholar", "Sir Plow", and a man who believes his left arm will turn into a rooster, his right arm will turn into a crossbow, and his buttocks will become cartwheels.{{sfnp|Mair|1998|p=24}}

A master of language, Zhuangzi sometimes engages in logic and reasoning, but then turns it upside down or carries the arguments to absurdity to demonstrate the limitations of human knowledge and the rational world.{{sfnp|Mair|1998|p=24}} Some of Zhuangzi's reasoning, such as his renowned argument with his philosopher friend [[Hui Shi|Huizi]] (Master Hui) about the joy of fish (chapter 17), have been compared to the [[Socratic dialogue|Socratic]] and [[Plato|Platonic dialogue]] traditions, and Huizi's paradoxes near the end of the book have been termed "strikingly like those of [[Zeno of Elea]]."{{sfnp|Mair|1998|p=24}}

===Notable passages===
[[File:Zhuangzi-Butterfly-Dream.jpg|thumb|upright=1|''Zhuangzi Dreaming of a Butterfly'', by 18th century Japanese painter [[Ike no Taiga]]]]

===="The Butterfly Dream"====
{{See also|Dream argument}}
The most famous of all ''Zhuangzi'' stories—"Zhuang Zhou Dreams of Being a Butterfly"—appears at the end of the second chapter, "On the Equality of Things".
{{Quote
|quote=&lt;poem&gt;{{nbsp|5}}{{lang|zh|昔者莊周夢為胡蝶，栩栩然胡蝶也，自喻適志與。不知周也。}}
{{nbsp|5}}Once, Zhuang Zhou dreamed he was a butterfly, a butterfly flitting and fluttering about, happy with himself and doing as he pleased.  He didn't know that he was Zhuang Zhou.

{{nbsp|5}}{{lang|zh|俄然覺，則蘧蘧然周也。不知周之夢為胡蝶與，胡蝶之夢為周與。周與胡蝶，則必有分矣。此之謂物化。}}
{{nbsp|5}}Suddenly he woke up and there he was, solid and unmistakable Zhuang Zhou.  But he didn't know if he was Zhuang Zhou who had dreamt he was a butterfly, or a butterfly dreaming that he was Zhuang Zhou.  Between Zhuang Zhou and the butterfly there must be some distinction!  This is called the Transformation of Things.&lt;/poem&gt;
|source = ''Zhuangzi'', chapter 2 (Watson translation){{sfnp|Watson|2003|p=44}}
}}
The well-known image of Zhuangzi wondering if he was a man who dreamed of being a butterfly or a butterfly dreaming of being a man is so striking that whole dramas have been written on its theme.{{sfnp|Mair|1994|p=xl}}  In it Zhuangzi "[plays] with the theme of transformation",{{sfnp|Mair|1994|p=xl}} illustrating that "the distinction between waking and dreaming is another false dichotomy. If [one] distinguishes them, how can [one] tell if [one] is now dreaming or awake?"{{sfnp|Graham|1981|pp=21-22}}

===="The Death of Wonton"====
Another well known Zhuangzi story{{mdash}}"The Death of Wonton"{{mdash}}illustrates the dangers Zhuangzi saw in going against the innate nature of things.{{sfnp|Mair|1994|p=xxxix}}
{{Quote
|quote=&lt;poem&gt;{{nbsp|5}}{{lang|zh|南海之帝為儵，北海之帝為忽，中央之帝為渾沌。儵與忽時相與遇於渾沌之地，渾沌待之甚善。儵與忽謀報渾沌之德，曰：人皆有七竅，以視聽食息，此獨無有，嘗試鑿之。日鑿一竅，七日而渾沌死。}}

{{nbsp|5}}The emperor of the Southern Seas was Lickety, the emperor of the Northern Sea was Split, and the emperor of the Center was Wonton.  Lickety and Split often met each other in the land of Wonton, and Wonton treated them very well.  Wanting to repay Wonton's kindness, Lickety and Split said, "All people have seven holes for seeing, hearing, eating, and breathing.  Wonton alone lacks them.  Let's try boring some holes for him."  So every day they bored one hole [in him], and on the seventh day Wonton died.&lt;/poem&gt;
|source = ''Zhuangzi'', chapter 7 (Mair translation){{sfnp|Mair|1994|p=71}}
}}
Zhuangzi believed that the greatest of all human happiness could be achieved through a higher understanding of the nature of things, and that in order to develop oneself fully one needed to express one's innate ability.{{sfnp|Mair|1994|p=xl}} In this anecdote, Mair suggests that Zhuangzi humorously and absurdly uses "Wonton"{{mdash}}a name for both the [[Hundun|Chinese conception of primordial chaos]] and by physical analogy, [[wonton|wonton soup]]{{mdash}}to demonstrate what he believed were the disastrous consequences of going against things' innate natures. In drawing a connection between wonton soup and primordial chaos, however, [[Wolfram Eberhard|Eberhard]] notes that the earliest mention of wonton soup is attested in sources dating to the Tang dynasty, and possibly the Han dynasty, postdating Zhuangzi by at least a century.&lt;ref&gt;Eberhard, W. "The Local Cultures of South and East China", Brill, 1968, p.440.&lt;/ref&gt;

===="The Debate on the Joy of Fish"====
The story of "The Debate on the Joy of Fish" is a well-known anecdote that has been compared to the [[Socratic dialogue]] tradition of ancient Greece.{{sfnp|Mair|1998|p=24}}
{{Quote
|quote=&lt;poem&gt;{{nbsp|5}}{{lang|zh|莊子與惠子遊於濠梁之上。莊子曰：儵魚出遊從容，是魚樂也。}}
{{nbsp|5}}Zhuangzi and Huizi were enjoying themselves on the bridge over the Hao River. Zhuangzi said, "The minnows are darting about free and easy! This is how fish are happy."

{{nbsp|5}}{{lang|zh|惠子曰：子非魚，安知魚之樂。莊子曰：子非我，安知我不知魚之樂。}} 
{{nbsp|5}}Huizi replied, "You are not a fish. How do you know that the fish are happy?" Zhuangzi said, "You are not I. How do you know that I do not know that the fish are happy?"

{{nbsp|5}}{{lang|zh|惠子曰：我非子，固不知子矣；子固非魚也，子之不知魚之樂全矣。}}
{{nbsp|5}}Huizi said, "I am not you, to be sure, so of course I don't know about you. But you obviously are not a fish; so the case is complete that you do not know that the fish are happy."

{{nbsp|5}}{{lang|zh|莊子曰：請循其本。子曰汝安知魚樂云者，既已知吾知之而問我，我知之濠上也。}}
{{nbsp|5}}Zhuangzi said, "Let's go back to the beginning of this. You said, How do you know that the fish are happy; but in asking me this, you already knew that I know it. I know it right here above the Hao."&lt;/poem&gt;
|source = ''Zhuangzi'', chapter 17 (Watson translation)&lt;ref&gt;Watson (1968), pp. 188-89, cited in {{harvp|Nivison|1999|p=783}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

The exact point made by Zhuangzi in this debate is not entirely clear.{{sfnp|Nivison|1999|p=783}}  The story seems to make the point that "knowing" a thing is simply a state of mind, and that it is not possible to determine if that knowing has any objective validity.{{sfnp|Nivison|1999|p=784}}  This story has been cited as an example of Zhuangzi's linguistic mastery, as he subtly uses reason to make an anti-rationalist point.{{sfnp|Nivison|1999|p=784}}

===="Drumming On a Tub and Singing"====
Another well-known Zhuangzi story—"Drumming On a Tub and Singing"—describes how Zhuangzi did not view death as something to be feared.
{{Quote
|quote=&lt;poem&gt;{{lang|zh|莊子妻死，惠子弔之，莊子則方箕踞鼓盆而歌。惠子曰：與人居長子，老身死，不哭亦足矣，又鼓盆而歌，不亦甚乎。}}
Zhuangzi's wife died.  When Huizi went to convey his condolences, he found Zhuangzi sitting with his legs sprawled out, pounding on a tub and singing. "You lived with her, she brought up your children and grew old," said Huizi. "It should be enough simply not to weep at her death. But pounding on a tub and singing—this is going too far, isn't it?"

{{lang|zh|莊子曰：不然。是其始死也，我獨何能無概然。察其始而本無生，非徒無生也，而本無形，非徒無形也，而本無氣。雜乎芒芴之間，變而有氣，氣變而有形，形變而有生，今又變而之死，是相與為春秋冬夏四時行也。}}
Zhuangzi said, "You're wrong. When she first died, do you think I didn't grieve like anyone else? But I looked back to her beginning and the time before she was born. Not only the time before she was born, but the time before she had a body. Not only the time before she had a body, but the time before she had a spirit. In the midst of the jumble of wonder and mystery a change took place and she had a spirit. Another change and she had a body. Another change and she was born. Now there's been another change and she's dead. It's just like the progression of the four seasons, spring, summer, fall, winter."

{{lang|zh|人且偃然寢於巨室，而我噭噭然隨而哭之，自以為不通乎命，故止也。}}
"Now she's going to lie down peacefully in a vast room. If I were to follow after her bawling and sobbing, it would show that I don't understand anything about fate. So I stopped."&lt;/poem&gt;
|source = ''Zhuangzi'', chapter 18 (Watson translation)&lt;ref&gt;Watson (2003 [1964]), p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;
|qalign = left
|align = center
}}
Zhuangzi seems to have viewed death as a natural process or transformation, where one gives up one form of existence and assumes another.{{sfnp|Mair|1994|p=xxxiv}} In the second chapter, he makes the point that, for all humans know, death may in fact be better than life: "How do I know that loving life is not a delusion? How do I know that in hating death I am not like a man who, having left home in his youth, has forgotten the way back?"&lt;ref&gt;Watson (1968), cited in {{harvp|Nivison|1999|p=789}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His writings teach that "the wise man or woman accepts death with equanimity and thereby achieves absolute happiness."{{sfnp|Mair|1994|p=xxxiv}}

====Zhuangzi's death====
The story of Zhuangzi's death, contained in chapter 32 of the text, exemplifies the colorful lore that grew up around Zhuangzi in the decades after his death, as well as the elaboration of the core philosophical ideas contained in the "inner chapters" that appears in the "outer" and "miscellaneous chapters".{{sfnp|Kern|2010|p=74}}

{{Quote
|quote=&lt;poem&gt;{{lang|zh|莊子將死，弟子欲厚葬之。莊子曰：吾以天地為棺槨，以日月為連璧，星辰為珠璣，萬物為齎送。吾葬具豈不備邪。何以加此。}}
When Master Zhuang was about to die, his disciples wanted to give him a lavish funeral.  Master Zhuang said: "I take heaven and earth as my inner and outer coffins, the sun and moon as my pair of jade disks, the stars and constellations as my pearls and beads, the ten thousand things as my funerary gifts.  With my burial complete, how is there anything left unprepared?  What shall be added to it?"

{{lang|zh|弟子曰：吾恐烏鳶之食夫子也。莊子曰：在上為烏鳶食，在下為螻蟻食，奪彼與此，何其偏也。}}
The disciples said: "We are afraid that the crows and kites will eat you, Master!" Master Zhuang said: "Above ground I'd be eaten by crows and kites, below ground I'd be eaten by mole crickets and ants.  You rob the one and give to the other—how skewed would that be?"&lt;/poem&gt;

[[File:Zhuangzi.gif|right|upright=0.75|thumb|Zhuangzi as an old man]]
The stories and anecdotes of the ''Zhuangzi'' embody a unique set of principles and attitudes, including living one's life with natural spontaneity, uniting one's inner self with the cosmic "Way" (''Dao''), keeping oneself distant from politics and social obligations, accepting death as a natural transformation, showing appreciation and praise for things others view as useless or aimless, and stridently rejecting social values and conventional reasoning.{{sfnp|Kern|2010|p=74}}  These principles form the core ideas of philosophical [[Daoism]].{{sfnp|Kern|2010|p=74}}  The other major philosophical schools of ancient China{{mdash}}such as [[Confucianism]], [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], and [[Mohism]]{{mdash}}were all concerned with concrete social, political, or ethical reforms designed to reform people and society and thereby alleviate the problems and suffering of the world.{{sfnp|Watson|2003|p=3}} However, Zhuangzi believed that the key to true happiness was to free oneself from the world and its standards through the Daoist principle of  "inaction" ([[Wu wei|''wúwéi'' 無為]]){{mdash}}action that is not based on any purposeful striving or motives for gain{{mdash}}and was fundamentally opposed to systems that impose order on individuals.{{sfnp|Watson|2003|p=6}}{{sfnp|Kern|2010|p=75}}

The ''Zhuangzi'' interprets the universe as a thing that changes spontaneously without a conscious God or will driving it, and argues that humans can achieve ultimate happiness by living equally spontaneously.{{sfnp|Puett|2001|pp=76-77}} It argues that because of humans' advanced cognitive abilities, they have a tendency to create artificial distinctions{{mdash}}such as good versus bad, large versus small, usefulness versus uselessness, and social systems like Confucianism{{mdash}}that remove themselves from the natural spontaneity of the universe.{{sfnp|Puett|2001|p=77}} In order to illustrate the mindlessness and spontaneity he felt should characterize human action, Zhuangzi most frequently uses the analogy of craftsmen or artisans.{{sfnp|Watson|2003|p=6}} As Burton Watson described, "the skilled woodcarver, the skilled butcher, the skilled swimmer does not ponder or ratiocinate on the course of action he should take; his skill has become so much a part of him that he merely acts instinctively and spontaneously and, without knowing why, achieves success."{{sfnp|Watson|2003|p=6}} The term "wandering" (''yóu''{{nbsp}}遊) is used throughout the stories of the ''Zhuangzi'' to describe how an enlightened person "wanders through all of creation, enjoying its delights without ever becoming attached to any one part of it."{{sfnp|Watson|2003|p=6}}

The ''Zhuangzi'' vigorously opposes formal government, which Zhuangzi seems to have felt was problematic at its foundation "because of the opposition between man and nature."{{sfnp|Mair|1994|p=xli}} The text tries to show that "as soon as government intervenes in natural affairs, it destroys all possibility of genuine happiness."{{sfnp|Mair|1994|p=xlii}} It is unclear if Zhuangzi's positions were "tantamount to [[anarchy]], and he was by no means in favor of violence."{{sfnp|Mair|1994|p=xli}} The political references in the ''Zhuangzi'' are more concerned with what government should not do rather than what kind of government should exist.{{sfnp|Mair|1994|p=xli}}

Western scholars have long noticed that the ''Zhuangzi'' is often strongly anti-[[rationalism|rationalist]].  Mohism, deriving from Zhuangzi's possible contemporary [[Mozi]], was the most logically sophisticated school in ancient China.  Whereas reason and logic became the hallmark of [[Greek philosophy]] and then the entire Western philosophical tradition, in China philosophers preferred to rely on moral persuasion and intuition.{{sfnp|Mair|1994|p=xliii}} The ''Zhuangzi'' played a significant role in the traditional Chinese skepticism toward rationalism, as Zhuangzi frequently turns logical arguments upside-down to satirize and discredit them.  However, Zhuangzi did not entirely abandon language and reason, but "only wished to point out that overdependence on them could limit the flexibility of thought."{{sfnp|Mair|1994|p=xliii}}

==Influence==
The ''Zhuangzi'' is by far the most influential purely-literary work dating from before China's imperial unification in 221{{sbc}}.{{sfnp|Mair|2000|p=30}} Its literary quality, imagination and creativity, and linguistic prowess were entirely unprecedented in the period of its creation.{{sfnp|Mair|2000|p=30}} Virtually every major Chinese writer or poet in history, from [[Sima Xiangru]] and [[Sima Qian]] during the [[Han dynasty]], [[Ruan Ji]] and [[Tao Yuanming]] during the [[Six Dynasties]], [[Li Bai]] during the [[Tang dynasty]], to [[Su Shi]] and [[Lu You]] in the [[Song dynasty]] were "deeply imbued with the ideas and artistry of the ''Zhuangzi''."{{sfnp|Mair|1998|pp=22-23}}

===Early times===
Traces of the ''Zhuangzi''{{'}}s influence in late Warring States period philosophical texts such as the ''[[Guanzi (text)|Guanzi]]'', ''[[Han Feizi (book)|Han Feizi]]'', ''[[Huainanzi]]'', and ''[[Lüshi Chunqiu]]'' suggest that Zhuangzi's intellectual lineage was already fairly influential in the states of [[Qi (state)|Qi]] and [[Chu (state)|Chu]] in the 3rd century{{sbc}}.{{sfnp|Mair|2000|p=33}}  However, during the [[Qin dynasty|Qin]] and [[Han dynasty|Han dynasties]]{{mdash}}with their state-sponsored [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalist]] and [[Confucianism|Confucian]] ideologies, respectively{{mdash}}the ''Zhuangzi'' does not seem to have been highly regarded.{{sfnp|Mair|2000|p=33}}   One exception is Han dynasty scholar [[Jia Yi]]'s 170{{sbc}} work "''Fu'' on the Owl" (''Fúniǎo fù'' {{lang|zh|鵩鳥賦}}), the earliest definitively known [[fu (poetry)|''fu'' rhapsody]], which does not reference the ''Zhuangzi'' by name but cites it for one-sixth of the poem.{{sfnp|Mair|1998|p=22}}

After the collapse of the Han dynasty in AD 207 and the subsequent chaos of the [[Three Kingdoms period]], both the ''Zhuangzi'' and Zhuang Zhou began to rise in popularity and acclaim.{{sfnp|Mair|2000|p=33}}  The 3rd century AD poets [[Ruan Ji]] and [[Xi Kang]], both members of the famous [[Seven Worthies of the Bamboo Grove]], were ardent ''Zhuangzi'' admirers,{{sfnp|Mair|2000|p=34}} and one of Ruan's essays, entitled "Discourse on Summing Up the ''Zhuangzi''" (''Dá Zhuāng lùn'' 達莊論), is still extant.{{sfnp|Mair|1998|p=23}}  This period saw Confucianism temporarily surpassed by a revival of Daoism and old divination texts, such as the [[I Ching|''Classic of Changes'' (''I Ching'' 易經)]], and many early medieval Chinese poets, artists, and calligraphers were deeply influenced by the ''Zhuangzi''.{{sfnp|Mair|2000|p=34}}

===Daoism and Buddhism===
The ''Zhuangzi'' has been called "the most important of all the Daoist writings",{{sfnp|Idema|Haft|1997|p=90}} and its "inner chapters" embody the core ideas of philosophical [[Daoism]].{{sfnp|Kern|2010|p=74}} In the 4th century AD, the ''Zhuangzi'' became a major source of imagery and terminology for a new form of Daoism known as the [[Shangqing School|"Highest Clarity" (''Shangqing'' 上清)]] school that was popular among the aristocracy of the [[Jin dynasty (265-420)|Jin dynasty]] (AD 265{{ndash}}420).  Highest Clarity Daoism borrowed notable ''Zhuangzi'' terms, such as "perfected man" (''zhēn rén'' {{lang|zh|真人}}), "Great Clarity" (''Tài Qīng'' {{lang|zh|太清}}), and "fasting the mind" (''xīn zhāi'' {{lang|zh|心齋}}), and though they are used somewhat differently than in the ''Zhuangzi'' itself, they still show the important role the ''Zhuangzi'' played at the time.{{sfnp|Mair|2000|p=34}}

The ''Zhuangzi'' was very influential in the adaptation of [[Buddhism]] to Chinese culture after Buddhism was first brought to China from [[India]] in the 1st century AD.{{sfnp|Mair|2000|p=34}} [[Zhi Dun]], China's first aristocratic Buddhist monk, wrote a prominent commentary to the ''Zhuangzi'' in the mid-4th century.{{sfnp|Mair|2000|p=34}}  The ''Zhuangzi'' also played a significant role in the formation of [[Zen Buddhism|Chan ("Zen") Buddhism]], which grew out of "a fusion of Buddhist ideology and ancient Daoist thought."{{sfnp|Mair|2000|p=34}}  Among the traits Chan/Zen Buddhism borrowed from the ''Zhuangzi'' are a distrust of language and logic, an insistence that "the Dao" can be found in everything, even dung and urine, and a fondness for dialogues based on riddles or paradigm-challenging statements known as ''gōng'àn'' ({{lang|zh|公案}}; Japanese ''[[kōan]]'').{{sfnp|Mair|2000|p=34}}

===Medieval and early modern===
The ''Zhuangzi'' retained prominence throughout Chinese history as the preeminent example of core Daoist philosophical ideals.  The 17th century scholar [[Gu Yanwu]] lamented his government's flippant use of the ''Zhuangzi'' on the [[keju|imperial examination]] essays as representative of a decline in traditional morals at the end of the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644).{{sfnp|Li|2010|pp=158–59}}  In the great Chinese novel [[Dream of the Red Chamber|''Dream of the Red Chamber'' (''Hong lou meng'' 紅樓夢)]], the main protagonist, Jia Baoyu, often turns to the ''Zhuangzi'' for comfort amidst his despair over conflicting love interests and relationships.{{sfnp|Shang|2010|p=290}}  The story of Zhuangzi drumming on a tub and singing after the death of his wife inspired an entire tradition of folk music called "funeral drumming" (''sàng-gǔ'' {{lang|zh|喪鼓}}) in central China's [[Hubei]] and [[Hunan]] Provinces that survived into the 18th and 19th centuries.{{sfnp|Idema|2010|p=403}}

===Modern===
Outside of China and the traditional "[[Sinosphere]]", the ''Zhuangzi'' lags far behind the ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'' in general popularity, and is rarely known by non-scholars.{{sfnp|Mair|1994|p=xlii}} A number of prominent scholars have attempted to bring the ''Zhuangzi'' to wider attention among Western readers.  In 1939, the British translator and Sinologist [[Arthur Waley]] described the ''Zhuangzi'' as "one of the most entertaining as well as one of the profoundest books in the world."&lt;ref&gt;Cited in {{Harvp|Graham|1981|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the introduction to his 1994 translation of the ''Zhuangzi'', the American [[Sinology|Sinologist]] [[Victor H. Mair]] wrote: "I feel a sense of injustice that the ''Dao De Jing'' is so well known to my fellow citizens while the ''Zhuangzi'' is so thoroughly ignored, because I firmly believe that the latter is in every respect a superior work."{{sfnp|Mair|1994|p=xliii}}
