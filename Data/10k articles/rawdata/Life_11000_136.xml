In January 2017, a [[Mental disorder#Disability|mentally disabled]] youth in a suburb of [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], was filmed being physically and verbally abused by four individuals. The incident was [[livestream]]ed on [[Facebook]], making the incident a [[Live streaming crimes|live streaming crime]].

The victim met with an acquaintance from high school at a [[McDonald's]] on New Year's Eve, and on January 3 was found by a police officer to appear injured while walking with a suspect on a sidewalk. The four suspects were arrested after the incident was [[livestream]]ed by one of the women on [[Facebook Live|Facebook]], and charged with [[Hate crime laws in the United States|hate crime]]s and other offenses.

==Kidnapping and torture==
On December 31, 2016, the 18-year-old victim was dropped off at a [[McDonald's]] in suburban [[Streamwood, Illinois]], by his parents. The victim knew one of the suspects before the incident had occurred as the two had attended the same school in [[Aurora, Illinois]], and the victim had mistakenly thought that the two were friends. When the victim went to the McDonald's, he had the intention of spending time with this friend. On January 2, 2017, the victim's parents filed a report that he was missing.&lt;ref name = "Chicago Tribune, January 5, 2017"&gt;{{cite web | last=Meisner | first=Jason | last2=Lee | first2=William | last3=Schmadeke | first3=Steve | title=Brutal Facebook Live attack brings hate-crime charges, condemnation from White House | website=chicagotribune.com | date=2017-01-05 | url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-facebook-live-attack-video-20170105-story.html | accessdate=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police noted that one of the male suspects stole a van and, pretending that it was his own van, went to meet the victim. The victim got into the van with the suspect, and they went to one of the suspect's friend's houses on the [[West Side, Chicago|West Side of Chicago]] for a two-day visit. During that time, the victim slept in the van.&lt;ref name = "Chicago Tribune, January 5, 2017"/&gt; On January 3, they went to the residence of two of the other suspects, who were sisters. While at the sisters' apartment, the victim and the male suspect "play-fought", which ended in the sisters getting angry and tying the victim up.&lt;ref name = "Chicago Tribune, January 5, 2017"/&gt;

The younger of the two sisters then turned on a Facebook Live stream to record the following events. The victim was bound, gagged, beaten, taunted, had part of his scalp removed with a knife, and was forced to kiss the floor and drink from a toilet bowl.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38525549 Four charged with hate crime for Chicago Facebook Live attack], BBC, January 5, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Domonoske 2017"/&gt; The attackers are heard shouting "Fuck [[Donald Trump|Trump]]" and "Fuck [[White Americans|white people]]" in the video.&lt;ref name="Domonoske 2017"&gt;{{cite web | last=Domonoske | first=Camila | title=4 Charged With Hate Crimes Over Beating Live-Streamed On Facebook | website=NPR.org | date=2017-01-05 | url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/01/05/508331652/4-people-in-custody-in-chicago-over-beating-live-streamed-on-facebook | accessdate=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2017/01/05/what-makes-a-crime-a-hate-crime-and-would-the-chicago-attack-qualify/ What makes a crime a 'hate crime'?

Police suspected that the attack stopped when neighbors in a downstairs apartment complained about noise levels.&lt;ref name = "Chicago Tribune, January 5, 2017"/&gt;

The victim was an 18-year-old,  mentally-disabled, white youth.&lt;ref name="Domonoske 2017"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://chicago.suntimes.com/news/black-captors-torture-white-victim-rant-against-trump-cpd-says/ 4 face hate crime charges in videotaped attack], Chicago Sun Times, January 4, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suspects and legal proceedings==
Four suspects were arrested and charged with [[aggravated]] [[kidnapping]], aggravated [[False imprisonment|unlawful restraint]], [[aggravated battery]], and [[hate crime]]. Two were 18-year-old males, Jordan Hill and Tesfaye Cooper, and one was Brittany Covington, an 18-year-old female; her sister Tanishia Covington was a 24-year-old female.&lt;ref name="Domonoske 2017"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

On December 8, 2017, Brittany Covington plead guilty to the charges of committing a hate crime, intimidation and aggravated battery. Additional charges, such as kidnapping, were dropped as part of her plea deal. Covington was sentenced to four years of [[probation]] and 200 hours of community service. Cook County Circuit Judge William Hooks said that he could have sentenced her to prison, but did not because "I'm not sure if I did that you'd be coming out any better."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crepeau|first1=Megan|title=Woman pleads guilty to hate crime in beating of disabled teen live on Facebook|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-met-facebook-live-beating-disabled-teen-20171208-story.html|publisher=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=9 December 2017|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20171209071357/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-met-facebook-live-beating-disabled-teen-20171208-story.html|archivedate=2017-12-09|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago-politics/woman-gets-probation-in-facebook-hate-crime-case/ Woman gets probation in Facebook hate-crime case], Chicago Sun-Times, December 8, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath and reactions==
On January 3, at approximately 5:15&amp;nbsp;p.m., Harrison District Officer Michael Donnelly saw the victim walking with the suspect that the victim had gone to high school with. The victim was observed by Officer Donnelly to be wearing summer clothing during winter conditions. Police said the victim appeared "injured" and "confused". After checking the victim's name through police databases it was discovered that he had been reported missing. Donnelly later stated, "I observed him wearing a tank top, inside-out, backwards, jean shorts and sandals on...He was bloodied. He was battered. He was very discombobulated."&lt;ref name = "Chicago Tribune, January 5, 2017"/&gt; Running the victim's name through police databases, Officer Donnelly discovered that the victim was reported as a missing person and brought him to the hospital.&lt;ref name = "Chicago Tribune, January 5, 2017"/&gt;

The live stream was later deleted, but archives still exist.&lt;ref name="Domonoske 2017"/&gt; There was widespread outrage over the beating.&lt;ref name="Yan Zdanowicz 2017"&gt;{{cite web | last=Yan | first=Holly | last2=Zdanowicz | first2=Christina | title=Police: No link between Chicago torture video and Black Lives Matter | website=CNN | date=2017-01-05 | url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/05/us/black-lives-matter-chicago-facebook-live-beating/index.html | accessdate=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its aftermath, the [[hashtag]] #BLMKidnapping was trending on [[Twitter]], implying a connection with the [[Black Lives Matter]] (BLM) movement.&lt;ref name="Yan Zdanowicz 2017"/&gt; None of the attackers specifically mentioned Black Lives Matter in the video and the police found there to be no direct connection.&lt;ref name="Bauer 2017"/&gt; Representatives for Black Lives Matter's Chicago branch denounced the beating and stated that they were uninvolved, and police stated that they found no evidence that Black Lives Matter was the motive of the incident.&lt;ref name="Bauer 2017"&gt;{{cite web | last=Bauer | first=Kelly | title='Ridiculous' To Blame Torture Video On Black Lives Matter, Activist Says | website=DNAinfo Chicago | date=2017-01-05 | url=https://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20170105/hermosa/disabled-man-tortured-facebook-live-chicago-black-lives-matter-blm | accessdate=2017-01-27 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202072956/https://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20170105/hermosa/disabled-man-tortured-facebook-live-chicago-black-lives-matter-blm | archivedate=2017-02-02 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some far right media outlets and conspiracy theorists (including [[Infowars]] and [[Glenn Beck]]) suggested that the rhetoric of Black Lives Matter and its supporters had encouraged the attackers. Other commentators disputed this.&lt;ref name="Yan Zdanowicz 2017"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Glenn Beck Blames Black Lives Matter for Chicago Torture Video | website=The Daily Beast | date=2017-01-05 | url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/cheats/2017/01/05/glenn-beck-blames-blm-for-chicago-torture-video.html | accessdate=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Barack Obama]] released a statement condemning the incident, saying, "What we have seen as surfacing, I think, are a lot of problems that have been there a long time...

"'''A Clockwork Origin'''" is the ninth episode of the [[Futurama (season 6)|sixth season]] of the [[animated]] [[sitcom]] ''[[Futurama]]''. It aired on [[Comedy Central]] on August 12, 2010.  In the episode, [[Professor Hubert J. Farnsworth|Professor Farnsworth]] leaves Earth after being frustrated by anti-evolutionists' belief in "Creaturism", a form of [[Creationism]].  He and the Planet Express crew arrive at a lifeless planet and the Professor introduces [[nanobots]] into the environment.  The nanobots rapidly begin evolving into mechanical organisms, allowing the crew to witness a whole new evolutionary history that unfolds before their eyes.

The episode was written by [[Dan Vebber]] and directed by [[Dwayne Carey-Hill]] and received mostly mixed reviews from critics.

==Plot==
{{plot|date=March 2018}}
{{original research|section|date=March 2018}}
[[Professor Hubert J. Farnsworth|Professor Farnsworth]] finds himself arguing with Dr. Banjo, a hyper-intelligent [[orangutan]] who believes in "Creaturism", a form of [[creationism]].  In an attempt to prove evolution did occur, the Professor excavates the lost [[Transitional fossil#Missing links|missing link]], which Dr. Banjo depicts as ''Homo farnsworth'' anachronistically riding a ''[[Stegosaurus]]'' in an attempt to support his Creaturist beliefs.  The Professor becomes fed up and resolves to leave Earth.  He takes the rest of the crew with him to an abandoned planet to live in solitude. 

After  Professor inserts [[nanorobotics|nanobots]] into the nearby pond to clean the water, the nanobots evolve rapidly into flora and fauna.  Robotic versions of an ''[[Elasmosaurus]]'' and a ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' attack the crew, but a [[solar flare]] short circuits the dinosaur robots, causing a [[mass extinction]] of every robot creature except for "[[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|small mammalian robots]]" that were hiding in caves, including Bender.   

The next day, the crew wakes up to find both [[Leela (Futurama)|Leela]] and [[Amy Wong|Amy]] kidnapped by [[caveman]]-like robots, but the following day, they find that Leela and Amy are free, because the robot cavemen have since evolved into a completely civilized, modern robot society.  The Professor states that he is proud of the nanobots' growth after he dumped their ancestors in a pond a few days ago. The robots, who believe unquestioningly in robot evolution, are angered by Farnsworth, when he shows a picture of a robot (Bender) riding a robotic ''Stegosaurus'' at the start of their creation. Bender represents him in court and in his arguments, states that the Professor is not arguing against evolution, but only claims a small role in beginning it by providing the materials necessary (the nanobots). He also tries to declare Professor insane.  

The following day, the robots have now evolved into a state of [[incorporeal]] [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] [[higher consciousness]].  They are no longer concerned with the Professor any more, finding corporeal beings altogether irrelevant, and sends the crew home.  The Professor and Dr. Banjo reconcile their differences. Dr. Banjo argues that what the Professor witnessed was evolution, but evolution set in motion by an intelligent creator. The Professor agrees that it is possible, however unlikely that Earth evolution was set in motion the same way.

==Cultural references==
&lt;!--Please only add references that are notably sourced by third party reliable resources, not just those that appear in the episode itself.--&gt;The title are references to the books ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' and ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''. It could also be considered a reference to William Paley's [[Watchmaker analogy]], a teleological argument found in his work ''[[Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity|Natural Theology]]''. The episode includes several cultural references related to depictions of evolutionary history and the debate between evolution and creationism.

'''Abantidas''' (in [[Greek language|Greek]] '''Ἀβαντίδας'''), the son of [[Paseas]], became [[Tyranny|tyrant]] of the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[city-state]] of  [[Sicyon]] after murdering [[Cleinias of Sicyon|Cleinias]], the father of [[Aratus of Sicyon|Aratus]], 264 BC.{{r|plut_2_paus_2.8}} After the assassination, Abantidas had the remaining friends and relations of Cleinias banished or put to death; Aratus, who was then only seven years old, narrowly escaped death by fleeing into the house of Soso, Abantidas' sister, who happened to be married to Prophantus, the late Cleinias' brother.&lt;ref&gt;http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/aratus.html&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|plut_2}} Abantidas was fond of literature, and was accustomed to attending the [[Philosophy|philosophical]] discussions of [[Deinias of Argos]] and [[Aristotle the Dialectician|Aristotle, the dialectician]], in the [[agora]] of Sicyon: on one of these occasions, with the complicity of the two [[Rhetoric|rhetors]], he was murdered by his enemies in 252. He was succeeded as tyrant of Sicyon by his father, Paseas, who was later put to death by [[Nicocles (Sicyon)|Nicocles]].{{r|plut_3}}{{clarify|reason=was he killed by Nicocles or did Nicocles have him killed by someone else?|date=November 2018}}

'''Anthony John Spilotro''' (May 19, 1938 – June 14, 1986), nicknamed '''"The Ant"''', was an [[United States|American]] [[mobster]] and [[wikt:thug|enforcer]] for the [[Chicago Outfit]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], during the 1970s and 1980s. His job was to protect and oversee the Outfit's illegal [[casino]] profits (the "[[Skimming (casinos)|skim]]"), when some of the casinos were run by [[Frank Rosenthal]]. Spilotro replaced Outfit member [[Marshall Caifano]] in Las Vegas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Casillo|title=Gangster priest: the Italian American cinema of Martin Scorsese|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dc-Ms8-YMUAC|year=2006|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-0-8020-9403-2|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Dc–Ms8–YMUAC&amp;pg=PA336 336]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spilotro eventually ran afoul of his organized crime overseers who disapproved of his handling Las Vegas affairs, and who arranged his murder in 1986.  Spilotro served as the basis for the character Nicky Santoro in [[Martin Scorsese|Martin Scorsese's]] mafia classic, [[Casino (1995 film)|Casino]]. &lt;ref&gt; [https://www.biography.com/people/tony-spilotro-485958 Biography.com:Tony Spilotro] &lt;/ref&gt; 

==Early life==
The fourth of six children, Anthony John Spilotro was born and raised in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. He attended Burbank Elementary School, and entered [[Steinmetz High School]] in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Enforcer- Spilotro: The Chicago Mob's Man Over Las Vegas|last= Roemer |first= William F., Jr.|year= 1994|publisher=The Ballantine Publishing Group |isbn= 0-8041-1310-6|page= 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father Pasquale "Patsy" Spilotro Sr. had emigrated from [[Triggiano]], [[Province of Bari]], [[Italy]], and had arrived at [[Ellis Island]] in 1914. When Pasquale arrived in the US, however, he had no money, education, or particular skill. Unlike most Italian immigrants who settled in "The Patch", the Spilotros lived at 2152 North [[Streets and highways of Chicago|Melvina Avenue]]. He and his wife Antoinette Spilotro ran Patsy's Restaurant, located at 470 N. Ogden, which was frequented by mobsters such as [[Salvatore Giancana|Salvatore "Sam" Giancana]], [[Jackie Cerone|Jackie "The Lackey" Cerone]], [[Gus Alex]], and [[Frank Nitti|Francesco "Frank the Enforcer" Nitti]]. In 1954, Pasquale suffered a fatal [[aneurysm]] and died at the age of 55, leaving six sons.

Along with four of his brothers, John, Vincent, [[Victor Spilotro|Victor]], and [[Michael Spilotro|Michael]], Tony became involved in criminal activity early in life. The remaining brother, Pasquale Jr., went to college and became a highly respected [[oral surgeon]] in the Chicago area. Tony became a [[made man]] in 1963, during his mid 20s.

He was nicknamed "Tony the Ant" by the media after [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] [[Special Agent]] [[William F. Roemer, Jr.|William Roemer]] referred to Spilotro as "that little [[pissant]]." Since the media couldn't use "pissant," they shortened it to the "Ant."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2184020 ''Slate'' magazine, "Where Do Mob Nicknames Come From?" Feb. 7, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; He was also called "Tough Tony."

==Early career==
Spilotro dropped out of Steinmetz High School in his sophomore year and quickly became known for a succession of petty crimes such as [[shoplifting]] and [[purse snatching]]. His first arrest occurred on January 11, 1955, when he attempted to steal a watch from a [[River Forest, Illinois|River Forest]] store and was charged with [[larceny]]; he was fined $10 and placed on [[probation]].

==The Hole in the Wall Gang==
In 1976, Spilotro formed a Las Vegas-based [[burglary]] ring with his brother Michael and [[Herbie Blitzstein|Herbert "Fat Herbie" Blitzstein]], utilizing about eight associates as burglars. The crew became known as the Hole in the Wall Gang because of its penchant for gaining entry by drilling through the exterior walls and ceilings of the buildings they burglarized. The Hole in the Wall Gang operated out of The Gold Rush, Ltd jewelry store. Other gang members included Peter Basile, [[Frank Cullotta]], Joseph Cusumano, Samuel Cusumano, Joseph D'Argento, Ernesto "Ernie" Davino, Leonardo "Leo" Guardino, Frank DeLegge, Michael LaJoy, Ernest Lehnigg, Wayne Matecki, "Crazy Larry" Neumann, Butch Panczko, Peanuts Panczko, Pops Panczko, Salvatore "Sonny" Romano, Gerald Tomasczek, Carl Urbanotti, and former Las Vegas detective Joseph Blasko, who acted as a lookout and who later worked as a [[bartender]] at the [[Crazy Horse Too]], a [[gentleman's club]]; Blasko died of a heart attack in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2002/Nov-28-Thu-2002/news/20167254.html |title=News: Former detective fired for Mafia link dies at 67 |publisher=reviewjournal.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a botched burglary at Bertha's Household Products on July 4, 1981, Blasko, Cullotta, Davino, Guardino, Matecki, and Neumann were arrested and each charged with burglary, conspiracy to commit burglary, attempted grand larceny, and possession of burglary tools. They were locked into the [[Las Vegas Police Department]]'s holding cell in downtown [[Las Vegas]]. The only members of Spilotro's gang not arrested for the July 4 burglary were Blitzstein, Cusumano, Romano, and Michael Spilotro. By this time, Spilotro's relationship with [[Frank Rosenthal]] had severely deteriorated, as Spilotro had had an affair with Rosenthal's wife, [[Geri McGee]]. Meanwhile, Cullotta had turned [[state's witness]], testifying against Spilotro. But the testimony was insufficient, and Tony was [[acquittal|acquitted]].

==Government informants==
The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] first "[[informant|flipped]]" Charles "Chuckie" Crimaldi, a former associate of [[Sam DeStefano]]. Crimaldi had been a "[[wikt:juice collector|juice collector]]" for DeStefano during the 1950s and 1960s. He gave evidence against Spilotro and DeStefano in the murder of real estate agent-[[loanshark]] Leo Foreman on November 19, 1963; DeStefano and Spilotro were both acquitted. Crimaldi also provided information on his part in murdering another DeStefano loanshark, [[William "Action" Jackson]], to keep him from cutting a deal with the FBI in exchange for a lighter sentence on a [[Truck hijacking|hijacking]] charge. Roemer denied Jackson had cut any deal with the FBI.

Many years later, in 1982, Sal Romano, a member of the Hole in the Wall Gang who specialized in disabling alarm systems, became a government informant. He worked [[counter-surveillance]] during botched Bertha's Las Vegas burglary in 1981. Unknown to the rest of the Wall Gang, Romano had tipped off federal agents and police, who were waiting for the burglars when they were drilling through the roof at Bertha's.

When Spilotro's childhood friend [[Frank Cullotta]] was arrested in the attempted Bertha's burglary, the FBI presented him with a wiretap tape that revealed that Spilotro was out to have him murdered. Cullotta agreed to become a federal witness. In court, he admitted that he had done "muscle work" on Spilotro's behalf for many years, including setting up the infamous Chicago 1962 "M&amp;M Murders" of James Miraglia and Billy McCarthy.&lt;ref name="Freeinfosociety.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freeinfosociety.com/article.php?id=87 |title=Spilotro, Anthony - The Free Information Society |publisher=Freeinfosociety.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spilotro had been ordered by Outfit bosses to track down and kill the two men after they robbed and murdered three people in a suburban Chicago neighborhood territory that was considered off limits since several Outfit members lived there. Cullotta also testified that Spilotro ordered him to murder Las Vegas mob associate Sherwin "Jerry" Lisner in 1979.

Las Vegas authorities and the FBI discovered that Spilotro had ordered Larry Neumann to murder Cullotta and Wayne Matecki. Cullotta, who had publicly admitted to being a killer himself, supplied more information about the M&amp;M Murders. Neumann tried to post [[bail]] for Cullotta so he could murder both him and Matecki, but the police had Cullotta's bail revoked to protect him. Cullotta received eight years in connection with a previous burglary. In September 1983, Spilotro was indicted in Las Vegas on murder and [[racket (crime)|racketeering]] charges based on Cullotta's testimony, but the charges didn't hold up.

Meanwhile, Spilotro was tried before [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]] Circuit Judge [[Thomas J. Maloney (judge)|Thomas J. Maloney]] for the M&amp;M Murders, while Neumann was sentenced to [[life sentence|life in prison]] in 1983. Maloney did not accept Cullotta's statements as evidence or as proof "[[beyond a reasonable doubt]]", and then, in turn, acquitted Spilotro. In 1992, Maloney himself would later be convicted through [[Operation Greylord]] of accepting [[bribe]]s in several related and unrelated cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=UNITED STATES v. MALONEY|opinion=94-2779 |court=United States Court of Appeals, Seventh Circuit. |date=1995 |url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-7th-circuit/1463552.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cullotta testified before the President's Commission on Organized Crime and the [[Florida]] Governor's Commission on Organized Crime, and appeared at a sentencing hearing for Chicago mobster [[Joseph Lombardo]]. He later served as a [[technical advisor]] for the 1995 Martin Scorsese movie ''[[Casino (film)|Casino]]'', in which Cullotta also played a small role as "Curly", one of Remo Gaggi's hitmen, who murders Andy Stone, a union boss, in an icy restaurant parking lot.

==Death==
Spilotro and his brother Michael, 41, disappeared June 14, 1986 when they drove away together from Michael's [[Oak Park, Illinois|Oak Park]] home saying they would return in several hours. Their car, a 1986 Lincoln, was recovered several days later in a motel parking lot near O'Hare Airport. On June 22, their bodies were found, one on top of the other and clad only in undershorts, buried under 5 feet of wet earth in a muddy grave within the 12,000-acre Willow Slough preserve, just 2 miles east of the Illinois-[[Indiana]] state line. The freshly turned earth had been noticed by a farmer who thought that the remains of a deer killed out of season had been buried there by a [[poacher]], and notified authorities. Their decomposing remains were identified by their brother Pasquale, Jr. and dental x-ray records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Roemer |first= William F., Jr. |title= The Enforcer- Spilotro: The Chicago Mob's Man Over Las Vegas |publisher=The Ballantine Publishing Group|year= 1994 |isbn= 0-8041-1310-6 |page= 272}}&lt;/ref&gt; An autopsy determined that the brothers had been savagely beaten.

In January 1986, in the wake of the imprisonment of [[Joseph Aiuppa]] and [[Jackie Cerone|John Cerone]] for skimming Las Vegas casino profits,&lt;ref&gt;The New York Times. ''Joseph Ferriola, 61, Reputed Mobster''. 8 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; a meeting was held at the Czech Lodge in [[North Riverside, Illinois]]. Most of the ‘upper echelon’ were there, including Outfit boss [[Tony Accardo|Tony "Joe Batters" Accardo]]. Accardo had decided to appoint [[Samuel Carlisi]] as the "Street Boss" in charge of Outfit operations to replace Aiuppa. Carlisi told the group that Accardo would stay on as ''[[consigliere]]'' and would have final say, as well as [[Gus Alex]] staying head of the connection guys. He then went on to the first problem: Spilotro, and how things had gone down since he took over Vegas. Mobster and mob enforcer Rocco Infelice said, "Hit him." Everyone else at the meeting agreed.

It was, at the time, suspected that Spilotro and his brother Michael were called by Carlisi to a meeting at a hunting lodge owned by Aiuppa, Spilotro's former mob boss. Original reports stated the Spilotros were buried alive after the beating, in an [[Enos, Indiana]] cornfield.&lt;ref name="Freeinfosociety.com"/&gt; However, in 2007, mob assassin [[Nicholas Calabrese]] testified at the "[[Operation Family Secrets]]" that the brothers were killed in a [[Bensenville, Illinois]] basement where the Spilotros believed Michael would be inducted into The Outfit. According to court testimony, when Tony entered the basement and realized what was about to occur, he asked if he could "say a prayer". It is possible, as the target of the "hit" was Anthony, that Michael was only killed because he was with him, or that the Outfit had decided from the outset that both brothers had to go to prevent any possible future revenge killings.

No arrests were made until April 25, 2005, when 14 members of the Chicago Outfit (including reputed boss [[James Marcello]]) were indicted for 18 murders, including the Spilotros'. The suspected murderers included ''capo'' [[Albert Tocco]] from [[Chicago Heights, Illinois]], who was sentenced to 200 years after his wife Betty testified against him in 1989. She claimed that the day after the Spilotro murders, she was called to pick up Tocco 1&amp;nbsp;mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) from where their bodies would later be found. She said that Tocco was dressed in dirty blue work clothes. Betty Tocco further implicated Nicholas "Nicky" Guzzino, Dominic "Tootsie" Palermo, and Albert "Chic" Roviaro in the murders. Tocco died at the age of 77 in an Indiana prison on September 21, 2005.

Another suspect in the murders was [[Frank Schweihs|Frank "The German" Schweihs]], a convicted extortionist and alleged Chicago assassin who was suspected of involvement in several murders including the Spilotros, [[Allen Dorfman]] (of the Teamster's Pension Fund), and a former girlfriend. Schweihs was arrested by the FBI on December 22, 2005. At the time, he was a fugitive living in a [[Berea, Kentucky|Berea]], [[Kentucky]] apartment complex. Schweihs had slipped away before prosecutors were able to arrest him and 13 others, including Marcello.

On May 18, 2007, the star witness in the government's case against 14 Chicago mob figures, [[Nicholas Calabrese]], pleaded guilty to taking part in a conspiracy that included 18 murders, including the hits on Anthony and Michael Spilotro. Under heavy security, Calabrese admitted that he took part in planning or carrying out 14 of the murders, including the Spilotro killings. He became the key witness against his brother, [[Frank Calabrese, Sr.]], and other major mob figures charged in the government's [[James Marcello#Family Secrets Trial|Family Secrets Trial]]. Calabrese agreed to testify after the FBI showed him [[DNA]] evidence linking him to the murder of fellow hit-man John Fecarotta, who was also allegedly involved in the Spilotro slayings.

In September 2007, Frank Calabrese, Sr. and four other men—Marcello, Joseph Lombardo, Paul "The Indian" Schiro, and former Chicago police officer Anthony "Twan" Doyle—were convicted of mob-related crimes.&lt;ref name="Las Vegas Review"&gt;{{cite web |author=Mike Robinson |title=CHICAGO'S ORGANIZED CRIME FAMILY: Guilty plea entered in Spilotro hits in '86 |url=http://www.lvrj.com/news/7590527.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jzCyLslm?url=http://www.lvrj.com/news/7590527.html |date=19 May 2007 |archivedate=22 September 2009 |work= |publisher=Las Vegas Review-Journal |accessdate=22 September 2009 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-familysecrets.sunjun17,1,7479574.story?coll=chi-news-hed&amp;?track=sto-topstory |title=Topic Galleries |publisher=chicagotribune.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-11}} {{Dead link|date=September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 27, 2007, Marcello was found guilty by a federal jury in the murders of both Spilotro brothers. On February 5, 2009, he was sentenced to life in prison for the murders.

Spilotro was replaced in Las Vegas by [[Donald Angelini|Donald "The Wizard of Odds" Angelini]]. He is survived by his wife Nancy, his adopted son Vincent, and his remaining brothers.

==Suspect in gangland slayings==
By the time of his death in 1986, the FBI suspected Spilotro was responsible for at least 22 murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2005/Apr-26-Tue-2005/news/26374836.html |title=News: CHICAGO MOB TARGETED: Goodman, family pleased wit |publisher=reviewjournal.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was indicted in 1983&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Dorfman Associate Indicted | date=January 28, 1983 | publisher= | url =https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/28/us/dorfman-associate-indicted.html | work =New York Times | pages = | accessdate = 2010-03-15 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; for his role in the murders of Bill McCarthy and James Miraglia, popularized in the press as the "M&amp;M Murders." McCarthy and Miraglia were two young criminals who had robbed and shot two businessmen and a woman in the mobster-populated neighborhood of [[Elmwood Park, Illinois|Elmwood Park]], near Chicago. They were also in debt to Spilotro's old boss, Sam DeStefano. Their bodies were discovered on May 15, 1962, in the trunk of a car dumped on the [[Southwest Side, Chicago|Southwest Side of Chicago]]. Both had been beaten badly and had their throats slit. From McCarthy's injuries, it seems his head was placed in a [[vise (tool)|vise]], popping out his eye, presumably to persuade him to disclose the whereabouts of Miraglia. The murder of Bill McCarthy (renamed "Tony Dogs") is portrayed in [[Martin Scorsese]]'s 1995 film ''[[Casino (film)|Casino]]''. Spilotro would later refer to McCarthy as the toughest man he ever met.

Spilotro may have been involved in the attempted car bombing murder of Lefty Rosenthal on October 4, 1982. He was also incriminated in the murder of his onetime mentor "Mad" Sam DeStefano on April 15, 1973, while DeStefano, his brother [[Mario Anthony DeStefano|Mario]] and Spilotro were all facing trial for the murder of Leo Foreman, a local collector for the mob, who had been tortured to death in Sam DeStefano's basement. Spilotro is further suspected of murdering San Diego real estate heiress Tamara Rand (an event portrayed in the film ''[[Casino (film)|Casino]]''); [[Teamsters Union]] executive [[Allen Dorfman]]; and Danny Siefert, the manager of the International Fiber Glass Company. Siefert was to be a principal witness in the fraud case but was shot in front of his wife and four-year-old son in September 1974. The fiberglass company was later burned to the ground by arsonists, whereupon they claimed the insurance money.

According to former [[Willow Springs, Illinois]], police chief [[Michael Corbitt]], statements by Outfit Capo Sal Bastone implicated Spilotro in the murder of former Chicago Outfit boss [[Sam Giancana]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Corbit (2003), ''Double Deal: The Inside Story of Murder, Unbridled Corruption, and the Cop who was a Mobster'', pages 194-197.&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI believes Spilotro was also involved in the torture murder of loan shark enforcer [[William Jackson (gangster)|William "Action" Jackson]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} who worked for DeStefano in the 1950s and 1960s. The Chicago Outfit mistakenly believed Jackson had become an FBI informant in 1961. A gang led by Sam DeStefano took Jackson to a meat packing plant, where he was tortured. Jackson was left near death for three days before finally succumbing to his injuries. Allegedly, Spilotro was a member of the gang that tortured and murdered him.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Film portrayals==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}
*[[Martin Scorsese]]'s film ''[[Casino (film)|Casino]]'' (1995) is based on the Las Vegas careers of Spilotro and [[Frank Rosenthal|Rosenthal]], on whom the characters Nicholas "Nicky" Santoro (played by [[Joe Pesci]]) and Ace Rothstein (played by [[Robert De Niro]]) were based, and Nicky serves as one of the film's main antagonists. In the film's climax, Nicky and his brother Dominick ([[Philip Suriano]]), based on Tony's brother [[Michael Spilotro]], are shown being beaten with metal baseball bats and buried alive in an Indiana cornfield by their associate Frank Marino ([[Frank Vincent]]), based on Frank Cullotta, and the rest of Nicky's crew.
*In the 1980s NBC series ''[[Crime Story (TV series)#Cast|Crime Story]],'' the character of mobster Ray Luca is based on Anthony Spilotro.

'''Augusto "Totoy" Bautista''' was a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] [[basketball]] player who made it to six [[Philippines men's national basketball team|national teams]] within the span of 11 years. He was one of the best center-forwards in pre-war basketball.

At the young age of 21, Totoy made the [[1919 Far Eastern Games]] in Manila. For five successive FEAA Games, he made the national team: 1921 in Shanghai; 1923 in Osaka; 1925 in Manila; 1927 in Shanghai and 1930 in Tokyo. After completing his primary schooling in Malate, he moved to Paco Elementary then to Manila High. He started his college education at [[Jose Rizal College]].

The best Philippine showing in FEAA Games was in 1925 when the Filipinos swept both rounds. With him were Vicente Avena, [[Dionisio Calvo]], Mariano Filomeno, Joaquin Iñigo, Pedro Robles, Jose Rodriguez, Alfredo Del Rosario, [[Lou Salvador]] and Mariano Sangle. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.inquirer.net/157113/a-golden-era-begging-to-be-remembered |title=A golden era begging to be remembered | work=Inquirer.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his retirement, Bautista served in various capacities in basketball, aside from being assistant coach to Del Rosario in the 1934 FEAA Games, he served in the same year in the defunct PAAF. In 1956, he was team manager of the basketball team in the Melbourne Olympics and again in 1960 Rome Olympics.

Totoy once coached the Ateneo Blue Eagles and San Beda Red Lions, then shifted to officiating in the later forties in the NCAA and UAAP.

A '''banshee''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|æ|n|ʃ|iː}} {{respell|BAN|shee}}; [[Irish language|Modern Irish]] {{lang|ga|bean sí}}, {{lang|ga|baintsí}}, from {{lang-sga|ben síde, baintsíde}}, {{IPA-sga|bʲen ˈʃiːðʲe, banˈtiːðe|pron}}, "woman of the [[Tumulus#Ireland|fairy mound]]" or "fairy woman") is a female [[spirit]] in [[Irish mythology]] who heralds the death of a family member, usually by wailing, shrieking, or [[keening]]. Her name is connected to the mythologically important [[tumulus|tumuli]] or "mounds" that dot the [[Ireland|Irish]] countryside, which are known as [[síd]]e (singular ''síd'') in Old Irish.&lt;ref name=DIL&gt;[[Dictionary of the Irish Language]]: ''[http://www.dil.ie/37441 síd, síth]'' - "a fairy hill or mound" and ''[http://www.dil.ie/5644 ben]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
There are many varying descriptions of the banshee. Sometimes she has long streaming hair and wears a grey [[cloak]] over a green dress, and her eyes are red from continual weeping.&lt;ref name=Briggs&gt;Briggs, Katharine (1976). ''An Encyclopedia of Fairies''. Pantheon Books. pp. 14–16. {{ISBN|0394409183}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She may be dressed in white with red hair and a ghastly complexion, according to a firsthand account by [[Ann, Lady Fanshawe]] in her ''Memoirs''.&lt;ref&gt;Fanshawe, Herbert Charles (1907). ''The Memoirs of Ann, Lady Fanshawe''. London: John Lane. p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lady Wilde]] in ''Ancient Legends of Ireland'' provides another:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Sometimes the banshee assumes the form of some sweet singing virgin of the family who died young, and has been given the mission by the invisible powers to become the harbinger of coming doom to her mortal kindred. Or she may be seen at night as a shrouded woman, crouched beneath the trees, lamenting with veiled face, or flying past in the moonlight, crying bitterly. And the cry of this spirit is mournful beyond all other sounds on earth, and betokens certain death to some member of the family whenever it is heard in the silence of the night.&lt;ref&gt;Wilde, Jane (1887). ''Ancient Legends, Mystic Charms, and Superstitions of Ireland'' (Vol. 1). Boston: Ticknor and Co. pp. 259–60.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;The physical size of the banshee is another physical feature that differs between regional accounts. Though some accounts of her standing unnaturally tall are recorded, the majority of tales that describe her height state the banshee's stature as short, anywhere between one foot and four feet. Her exceptional shortness often goes alongside the description of her as an old woman, though it may also be intended to emphasize her state as a fairy creature.&lt;ref&gt;Chaplin, Kathleen. "The Death Knock." ''New England Review'', vol. 34, no. 1, 2013, p. 135+. ''Literature Resource Center''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Keening==
In Ireland and parts of Scotland, a traditional part of mourning is the [[keening]] woman (''bean chaointe''), who wails a lament - in {{lang-ga|Caoineadh}}, {{IPA-ga|'kɰiːnʲi}} (Munster dialect), {{IPA-ga|ˈkɰiːnʲə|}} (Connaught dialect) or {{IPA-ga|ˈkiːnʲuː|}} (Ulster dialect), ''caoin'' meaning "to weep, to wail". This keening woman may in some cases be a professional, and the best keeners would be in high demand.

Irish legend speaks of a lament being sung by a fairy woman, or banshee. She would sing it when a family member died or was about to die, even if the person had died far away and news of their death had not yet come. In those cases, her wailing would be the first warning the household had of the death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/644410117|title=Celtic culture : a historical encyclopedia|last=T.|first=Koch, John|date=2006-01-01|publisher=ABC CLIO|year=|isbn=9781851094400|location=|pages=189|oclc=644410117|quote=[Its occurrence] is most strongly associated with the old family or ancestral home and land, even when a family member dies abroad. The cry, linked predominantly to impending death, is said to be experienced by family members, and especially by the local community, rather than the dying person. Death is considered inevitable once the cry is acknowledged.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/755062222|title=Encyclopedia of death and the human experience|last=Lysaght|first=Patricia|last2=Bryant|first2=Clifton D.|last3=Peck|first3=Dennis L.|publisher=SAGE|year=|isbn=9781412951784|location=|pages=97|oclc=755062222|quote=Most manifestations of the banshee are said to occur in Ireland, usually near the home of the dying person... but some accounts refer to the announcement in Ireland of the deaths of Irish people overseas... It is those concerned with a death, at family and community levels, who usually hear the banshee, rather than the dying person.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The banshee also is a predictor of death. If someone is about to enter a situation where it is unlikely they will come out of alive she will warn people by screaming or wailing, giving rise to a banshee also being known as a wailing woman.

It is often stated that the banshee laments only the descendants of the pure [[Milesians (Irish)|Milesian]] stock of Ireland,&lt;ref name="DemonologySirWalterScott"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=DyISAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=sir+walter+scott+letters+on+demonology+banshee|title=Letters on Demonology and Witchcraft|last=Scott|first=Walter|date=1836-01-01|publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers|language=en|page=296}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes clarified as surnames prefixed with O' and Mac,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8LvkDAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=banshee+names+irish|title=Packy Jim: Folklore and Worldview on the Irish Border|last=Cashman|first=Ray|date=2016-08-30|publisher=University of Wisconsin Pres|isbn=9780299308902|language=en|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some accounts even state that each family has its own banshee. One account, however, also included the [[FitzGerald dynasty|Geraldines]], as they had apparently become "[[more Irish than the Irish themselves]]," countering the lore ascribing banshees exclusively to those of Milesian stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Sullivan|first=Friar|year=1899|title=Ancient History of the Kingdom of Kerry|url=http://www.corkhist.ie/wp-content/uploads/jfiles/1899/b1899-036.pdf|journal=Journal of the Cork Historical and Archaeological Society|volume=5|issue=44|pages=224–234|via=JCHAS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When several banshees appear at once, it indicates the death of someone great or holy.&lt;ref name="Yeats"&gt;Yeats, W. B. "Fairy and Folk Tales of the Irish Peasantry" in Booss, Claire; Yeats, W.B.; Gregory, Lady (1986) ''A Treasury of Irish Myth, Legend, and Folklore''. New York: Gramercy Books. p. 108. {{ISBN|978-0-517-48904-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tales sometimes recounted that the woman, though called a fairy, was a ghost, often of a specific murdered woman, or a mother who died in childbirth.&lt;ref name=Briggs/&gt;

==Origin==
Most, though not all, surnames associated with banshees have the ''Ó'' or ''Mc/Mac'' prefix - that is, surnames of Goidelic origin, indicating a family native to the Insular Celtic lands rather than those of the Norse, English, or Norman invaders. Accounts reach as far back as 1380 to the publication of the ''[[Cathreim Thoirdhealbhaigh]]'' (''Triumphs of Torlough'') by Sean mac Craith.&lt;ref name="lore" /&gt; Mentions of banshees can also be found in [[Normans|Norman]] literature of that time.&lt;ref name="lore" /&gt;

The Ua Briain banshee is thought to be named [[Aibell]] and the ruler of 25 other banshees who would always be at her attendance.&lt;ref name="lore"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Westropp |first=Thos. J. |title=A Folklore Survey of County Clare |journal=Folklore |volume= 21|issue= 2|pages=180–199 |date=June 1910  |jstor=1254686}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that this particular story is the source of the idea that the wailing of numerous banshees signifies the death of a great person.&lt;ref name="lore" /&gt;

In some parts of [[Leinster]], she is referred to as the ''bean chaointe'' (keening woman) whose wail can be so piercing that it shatters glass. In Scottish folklore, a similar creature is known as the [[bean nighe]] or ''ban nigheachain'' (little washerwoman) or ''nigheag na h-àth'' (little washer at the ford) and is seen washing the bloodstained clothes or armour of those who are about to die. In Welsh folklore, a similar creature is known as the [[hag of the mist]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Elias Owen (Welsh cleric)|Owen, Elias]] (1887). ''Welsh folk-lore: A collection of the folk-tales and legends of North Wales''. Felinfach: Llanerch. p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[computer science]] and [[operations research]], the '''bees algorithm''' is a population-based [[search algorithm]] which was developed by Pham, Ghanbarzadeh and et al. in 2005.&lt;ref name="Pham &amp; al, 2005"&gt;Pham DT, Ghanbarzadeh A, Koc E, Otri S, Rahim S and Zaidi M. The Bees Algorithm. Technical Note, Manufacturing Engineering Centre, Cardiff University, UK, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; It mimics the food foraging behaviour of honey bee colonies. In its basic version the algorithm performs a kind of neighbourhood search combined with global search, and can be used for both [[combinatorial optimization]] and [[continuous optimization]]. The only condition for the application of the bees algorithm is that some measure of distance between the solutions is defined. The effectiveness and specific abilities of the bees algorithm have been proven in a number of studies.&lt;ref name="Pham &amp; Castellani, 2009"&gt;Pham, D.T., Castellani, M. (2009), [http://pic.sagepub.com/content/223/12/2919.short The Bees Algorithm – Modelling Foraging Behaviour to Solve Continuous Optimisation Problems]. Proc. ImechE, Part C, 223(12), 2919-2938.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pham, D.T. and Castellani, M. (2013), [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00500-013-1104-9 Benchmarking and Comparison of Nature-Inspired Population-Based Continuous Optimisation Algorithms], Soft Computing, 1-33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pham, D.T. and Castellani, M.

R., Massah Bavani, A., Teshnehlab, M., (2017), [http://www.mdpi.com/2073-431X/6/1/5 Grouped Bees Algorithm: A Grouped Version of the Bees Algorithm], Computers 2017, 6(1), 5; (doi: 10.3390/computers6010005)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Metaphor ==
A colony of [[honey bees]] can extend itself over long distances (over 14&amp;nbsp;km)&lt;ref name="Tereshko &amp; Loengarov, 2005"&gt;Tereshko V., Loengarov A., (2005) [http://cis.uws.ac.uk/research/journal/V9/V9N3/bees.pdf Collective Decision-Making in Honey Bee Foraging Dynamics]. Journal of Computing and Information Systems, 9(3), 1-7.&lt;/ref&gt; and in multiple directions simultaneously to harvest nectar or pollen from multiple food sources (flower patches). 
A small fraction of the colony constantly searches the environment looking for new flower patches. These scout bees move randomly in the area surrounding the hive, evaluating the profitability (net energy yield) of the food sources encountered.&lt;ref name="Tereshko &amp; Loengarov, 2005"/&gt; When they return to the hive, the scouts deposit the food harvested. Those individuals that found a highly profitable food source go to an area in the hive called the “dance floor”, and perform a ritual known as the [[waggle dance]].&lt;ref&gt;Von Frisch, K. (1967) The Dance Language and Orientation of Bees. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Through the waggle dance a scout bee communicates the location of its discovery to idle onlookers, which join in the exploitation of the flower patch. Since the length of the dance is proportional to the scout’s rating of the food source, more foragers get recruited to harvest the best rated flower patches. After dancing, the scout returns to the food source it discovered to collect more food. 
As long as they are evaluated as profitable, rich food sources will be advertised by the scouts when they return to the hive. Recruited foragers may waggle dance as well, increasing the recruitment for highly rewarding flower patches. Thanks to this autocatalytic process, the bee colony is able to quickly switch the focus of the foraging effort on the most profitable flower patches.&lt;ref name="Tereshko &amp; Loengarov, 2005"/&gt;

== Algorithm ==
The bees algorithm&lt;ref name="Pham &amp; Castellani, 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pham &amp; Ghanbarzadeh et. a. 2006"&gt;Pham D.T., Ghanbarzadeh A., Koc E., Otri S., Rahim S., Zaidi M., The Bees Algorithm, A Novel Tool for Complex Optimisation Problems, Proc 2nd Int Virtual Conf on Intelligent Production Machines and Systems (IPROMS 2006), Oxford: Elsevier, pp. 454-459, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; mimics the foraging strategy of honey bees to look for the best solution to an optimisation problem. Each candidate solution is thought of as a food source (flower), and a population (colony) of ''n'' agents (bees) is used to search the solution space. Each time an artificial bee visits a flower (lands on a solution), it evaluates its profitability (fitness).

The bees algorithm consists of an initialisation procedure and a main search cycle which is iterated for a given number ''T'' of times, or until a solution of acceptable fitness is found. Each search cycle is composed of five procedures: recruitment, local search, neighbourhood shrinking, site abandonment, and global search.

 '''Pseudocode for the standard bees algorithm'''&lt;ref name="Pham &amp; Castellani, 2009"/&gt;
    1 for i=1,…,ns				
        i  scout[i]=Initialise_scout()
        ii flower_patch[i]=Initialise_flower_patch(scout[i])
    2 do until stopping_condition=TRUE		
        i   Recruitment() 	
        ii  for i =1,...,nb
              1 flower_patch[i]=Local_search(flower_patch[i])
              2 flower_patch[i]=Site_abandonment(flower_patch[i])
              3 flower_patch[i]=Neighbourhood_shrinking(flower_patch[i])		
        iii for i = nb,...,ns
              1 flower_patch[i]=Global_search(flower_patch[i])}

In the initialisation routine ''ns'' scout bees are randomly placed in the search space, and evaluate the fitness of the solutions where they land. For each solution, a neighbourhood (called flower patch) is delimited.

In the recruitment procedure, the scouts that visited the ''nb''≤''ns'' fittest solutions (best sites) perform the waggle dance. That is, they recruit foragers to search further the neighbourhoods of the most promising solutions. The scouts that located the very best ''ne''≤''nb'' solutions (elite sites) recruit ''nre'' foragers each, whilst the remaining ''nb''-''ne'' scouts recruit ''nrb''≤''nre'' foragers each. Thus, the number of foragers recruited depends on the profitability of the food source.

In the local search procedure, the recruited foragers are randomly scattered within the flower patches enclosing the solutions visited by the scouts (local exploitation). If any of the foragers in a flower patch lands on a solution of higher fitness than the solution visited by the scout, that forager becomes the new scout. If no forager finds a solution of higher fitness, the size of the flower patch is shrunk (neighbourhood shrinking procedure). Usually, flower patches are initially defined over a large area, and their size is gradually shrunk by the neighbourhood shrinking procedure. As a result, the scope of the local exploration is progressively focused on the area immediately close to the local fitness best. If no improvement in fitness is recorded in a given flower patch for a pre-set number of search cycles, the local maximum of fitness is considered found, the patch is abandoned (site abandonment), and a new scout is randomly generated.

As in biological bee colonies,&lt;ref name="Tereshko &amp; Loengarov, 2005"/&gt; a small number of scouts keeps exploring the solution space looking for new regions of high fitness (global search). The global search procedure re-initialises the last ''ns''-''nb'' flower patches with randomly generated solutions.

At the end of one search cycle, the scout population is again composed of ''ns'' scouts: ''nr'' scouts produced by the local search procedure (some of which may have been re-initialised by the site abandonment procedure), and ''ns''-''nb'' scouts generated by the global search procedure. The total artificial bee colony size is ''n''=''ne''•''nre''+(''nb''-''ne'')•''nrb''+''ns'' (elite sites foragers + remaining best sites foragers + scouts) bees.

== Variants ==
In addition to the basic bees algorithm,&lt;ref name="Pham &amp; Ghanbarzadeh et. a. 2006"/&gt; there are a number of improved or hybrid versions of the BA, each of which focuses on some shortcomings of the basic BA. These variants include (but are not limited to) fuzzy or enhanced BA (EBA),&lt;ref name="Pham &amp; Darwish 008"&gt;Pham D. T., Haj Darwish A., (2008), A. Fuzzy Selection of Local Search Sites in the Bees Algorithm.  Proceedings of Innovative Production Machines and Systems (IPROMS 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; grouped BA (GBA),&lt;ref name="Nasrinpour &amp; Massah &amp; Teshnehlab 2017"/&gt; hybrid modified BA (MBA)&lt;ref name="Pham &amp; Pham &amp; Castellani 2011"&gt;Pham Q.

The pseudo-code for the '''grouped BA (GBA)''' &lt;ref name="Nasrinpour &amp; Massah &amp; Teshnehlab 2017"/&gt; is as follows.

A '''biosensor''' is an analytical device, used for the detection of a chemical substance, that combines a biological component with a [[physical chemistry|physicochemical]] detector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Anthony|title=Biosensors:Fundamentals and Applications|year=1987|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=0198547242|page=770 |author2=Wilson, George |author3=Kaube, Isao}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bănică|first=Florinel-Gabriel|title=Chemical Sensors and Biosensors:Fundamentals and Applications|year=2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Chichester, UK|isbn=9781118354230|page=576}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The ''sensitive biological element'', e.g. tissue, microorganisms, [[organelle]]s, [[cell receptor]]s, [[enzyme]]s, [[antibody|antibodies]], [[nucleic acid]]s, etc., is a biologically derived material or biomimetic component that interacts, binds, or recognizes with the analyte under study.  The biologically sensitive elements can also be created by [[biological engineering]].
The [[Biotransducer|''transducer'']] or the ''detector element'', which transforms one signal into another one, works in a physicochemical way: optical, [[piezoelectric]], electrochemical,
[[electrochemiluminescence]] etc., resulting from the interaction of the analyte with the biological element, to easily measure and quantify.
The biosensor reader device with the associated electronics or signal processors that are primarily responsible for the display of the results in a user-friendly way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cavalcanti A, Shirinzadeh B, Zhang M, Kretly LC |title=Nanorobot Hardware Architecture for Medical Defense |journal= Sensors |volume=8 |issue=5 |pages=2932–2958 |year=2008 |url=http://www.mdpi.org/sensors/papers/s8052932.pdf |doi=10.3390/s8052932|pmid=27879858 |pmc=3675524 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This sometimes accounts for the most expensive part of the sensor device, however it is possible to generate a user friendly display that includes transducer and sensitive element ([[holographic sensor]]). The readers are usually custom-designed and manufactured to suit the different working principles of biosensors.

==Biosensor system==

A biosensor typically consists of a bio-recognition site, biotransducer component, and [[electronic system]] which includes a [[signal amplifier]], processor, and display. Transducers and electronics can be combined, e.g., in [[CMOS]]-based microsensor systems.&lt;ref name="A1"&gt;A. Hierlemann, O. Brand, C. Hagleitner, H. Baltes, "Microfabrication techniques for chemical/biosensors, ''Proceedings of the IEEE'' 91 (6), 2003, 839–863.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A2"&gt;A. Hierlemann, H. Baltes, "CMOS-based chemical microsensors, ''The Analyst'' 128 (1), 2003, pp. 15–28.&lt;/ref&gt; The recognition component, often called a bioreceptor, uses biomolecules from organisms or receptors modeled after biological systems to interact with the analyte of interest. This interaction is measured by the biotransducer which outputs a measurable signal proportional to the presence of the target analyte in the sample. The general aim of the design of a biosensor is to enable quick, convenient testing at the point of concern or care where the sample was procured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.clemson.edu/c3b/biosensorsPrimer.html |title= Biosensors Primer |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |accessdate=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bioreceptors==
In a biosensor, the bioreceptor is designed to interact with the specific analyte of interest to produce an effect measurable by the transducer. High [[binding selectivity|selectivity]] for the analyte among a matrix of other chemical or biological components is a key requirement of the bioreceptor. While the type of biomolecule used can vary widely, biosensors can be classified according to common types of bioreceptor interactions involving: antibody/antigen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2017/tb/c7tb01557g#!divAbstract |title= Highly sensitive electrochemiluminescence detection of a prostate cancer biomarker |year=2017 |last1= Juzgado |first1=A. |last2= Solda |first2=A. |last3=Ostric |first3=A. |last4=Criado |first4=A. |last5=Valenti |first5=G. |last6=Rapino |first6=S. |last7=Conti |first7=G. |last8=Fracasso |first8=G. |last9=Paolucci |first9=F. |last10=Prato |first10=M. |journal= J.

===Antibody/antigen interactions===
An [[immunoassay|immunosensor]] utilizes the very specific binding affinity of [[antibodies]] for a specific compound or [[antigen]]. The specific nature of the [[antibody-antigen interaction]] is analogous to a lock and key fit in that the antigen will only bind to the antibody if it has the correct conformation. Binding events result in a physicochemical change that in combination with a tracer, such as a fluorescent molecules, enzymes, or radioisotopes, can generate a signal. There are limitations with using antibodies in sensors: 1.The antibody binding capacity is strongly dependent on assay conditions (e.g. pH and temperature) and 2. The antibody-antigen interaction is generally irreversible. However, it has been shown that binding can be disrupted by [[chaotropic]] reagents, organic solvents, or even ultrasonic radiation.&lt;ref name=FiberOpticBiosensor&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Marazuela | first1 = M.| last2 = Moreno-Bondi | first2 = M.| doi = 10.1007/s00216-002-1235-9 | title = Fiber-optic biosensors – an overview | journal = Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry | volume = 372 | issue = 5–6 | pages = 664–682 | year = 2002 | pmid =  11941437| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artificial binding proteins===
The use of antibodies as the bio-recognition component of biosensors has several drawbacks. They have high molecular weights and limited stability, contain essential disulfide bonds and are expensive to produce. In one approach to overcome these limitations, recombinant binding fragments ([[Fragment antigen-binding|Fab]], [[Fragment variable|Fv]] or [[scFv]]) or domains (VH, [[VHH]]) of antibodies have been engineered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crivianu-Gaita|first1=V|last2=Thompson|first2=M|title=Aptamers, antibody scFv, and antibody Fab' fragments: An overview and comparison of three of the most versatile biosensor biorecognition elements|journal=Biosens Bioelectron|date=Nov 2016|volume=85|pages=32–45|doi=10.1016/j.bios.2016.04.091|pmid=27155114}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another approach, small protein scaffolds with favorable biophysical properties have been engineered to generate artificial families of Antigen Binding Proteins (AgBP), capable of specific binding to different target proteins while retaining the favorable properties of the parent molecule. The elements of the family that specifically bind to a given target antigen, are often selected in vitro by display techniques: [[phage display]], [[ribosome display]], [[yeast display]] or [[mRNA display]]. The artificial binding proteins are much smaller than antibodies (usually less than 100 amino-acid residues), have a strong stability, lack disulfide bonds and can be expressed in high yield in reducing cellular environments like the bacterial cytoplasm, contrary to antibodies and their derivatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Skrlec|first1=K|last2=Strukelj|first2=B|last3=Berlec|first3=A|title=Non-immunoglobulin scaffolds: a focus on their targets|journal=Trends Biotechnol|date=Jul 2015|volume=33|issue=7|pages=408–418|doi=10.1016/j.tibtech.2015.03.012|pmid=25931178}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jost|first1=C|last2=Plückthun|first2=A|title=Engineered proteins with desired specificity: DARPins, other alternative scaffolds and bispecific IgGs|journal=Curr Opin Struct Biol|date=Aug 2014|volume=27|pages=102–112|doi=10.1016/j.sbi.2014.05.011|pmid=25033247}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are thus especially suitable to create biosensors.&lt;ref name="pmid19945965"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brient-Litzler|first1=E|last2=Plückthun|first2=A|last3=Bedouelle|first3=H|title=Knowledge-based design of reagentless fluorescent biosensors from a designed ankyrin repeat protein|journal=Protein Eng Des Sel|date=Apr 2010|volume=23|issue=4|pages=229–241|doi=10.1093/protein/gzp074|pmid=19945965}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21565483"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miranda|first1=FF|last2=Brient-Litzler|first2=E|last3=Zidane|first3=N|last4=Pecorari|first4=F|last5=Bedouelle|first5=Hugues|title=Reagentless fluorescent biosensors from artificial families of antigen binding proteins|journal=Biosens Bioelectron|date=Jun 2011|volume=26|issue=10|pages=4184–4190|doi=10.1016/j.bios.2011.04.030|pmid=21565483}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enzymatic interactions===
The specific binding capabilities and catalytic activity of [[enzyme]]s make them popular bioreceptors. Analyte recognition is enabled through several possible mechanisms: 1) the enzyme converting the analyte into a product that is sensor-detectable, 2) detecting enzyme inhibition or activation by the analyte, or 3) monitoring modification of enzyme properties resulting from interaction with the analyte.&lt;ref name=FiberOpticBiosensor/&gt; The main reasons for the common use of enzymes in biosensors are: 1) ability to catalyze a large number of reactions; 2) potential to detect a group of analytes (substrates, products, inhibitors, and modulators of the catalytic activity); and 3) suitability with several different transduction methods for detecting the analyte. Notably, since enzymes are not consumed in reactions, the biosensor can easily be used continuously. The catalytic activity of enzymes also allows lower limits of detection compared to common binding techniques. However, the sensor's lifetime is limited by the stability of the enzyme.

===Affinity binding receptors===
Antibodies have a high [[binding constant]] in excess of 10^8 L/mol, which stands for a nearly irreversible association once the antigen-antibody couple has formed. For certain analyte molecules like [[glucose]] affinity binding proteins exist that bind their ligand with a high [[sensitivity and specificity|specificity]] like an antibody, but with a much smaller binding constant on the order of 10^2 to 10^4 L/mol. The association between analyte and receptor then is of [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible]] nature and next to the couple between both also their free molecules occur in a measurable concentration. In case of glucose, for instance, [[concanavalin A]] may function as affinity receptor exhibiting a binding constant of 4x10^2 L/mol.&lt;ref name= SMG1982&gt;{{cite journal | author = J. S. Schultz | author2 = S. Mansouri | author3 = I. J. Goldstein | title = Affinity sensor: A New Technique for Developing Implantable Sensors for Glucose and Other Metabolites | journal = Diab. Care | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 245–253 | year = 1982 | doi=10.2337/diacare.5.3.245}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of affinity binding receptors for purposes of biosensing has been proposed by Schultz and Sims in 1979 &lt;ref name= SSi1979&gt;{{cite journal | author = J. S. Schultz | author2 =  G. Sims | title = Affinity sensors for individual metabolites | journal = Biotechnol. Bioeng. Symp. | volume = 9 | pages = 65–71 | year = 1979 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was subsequently configured into a fluorescent assay for measuring glucose in the relevant [[blood sugar|physiological range]] between 4.4 and 6.1&amp;nbsp;mmol/L.&lt;ref name= BS2000&gt;{{cite journal | author = R. Ballerstadt | author2 = J. S. Schultz | title = A Fluorescence Affinity Hollow Fiber Sensor for Continuous Transdermal Glucose Monitoring| journal = Anal. Chem. | volume = 72 | issue = 17 | pages = 4185–4192 | year = 2000 | doi = 10.1021/ac000215r }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sensor principle has the advantage that it does not consume the analyte in a chemical reaction as occurs in enzymatic assays.

===Nucleic acid interactions===
Biosensors that employ nucleic acid interactions can be referred to as genosensors. The recognition process is based on the principle of complementary [[base pair]]ing, adenine:thymine and cytosine:guanine in [[DNA]]. If the target nucleic acid sequence is known, complementary sequences can be synthesized, labeled, and then immobilized on the sensor. The [[hybridization probe]]s can then base pair with the target sequences, generating an optical signal. The favored transduction principle employed in this type of sensor has been optical detection.&lt;ref name=FiberOpticBiosensor/&gt;

===Epigenetics===
It has been proposed that properly optimized integrated optical resonators can be exploited for detecting epigenetic modifications (e.g. DNA methylation, histone post-translational modifications) in body fluids from patients affected by cancer or other diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Donzella | first1 = V | last2 = Crea | first2 = F | date = June 2011 | title = Optical biosensors to analyze novel biomarkers in oncology | url = | journal = J Biophotonics | volume = 4 | issue = 6| pages = 442–52 | doi = 10.1002/jbio.201000123 | pmid = 21567973 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Photonic biosensors with ultra-sensitivity are nowadays being developed at a research level to easily detect cancerous cells within the patient's urine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vollmer| first1 = F | last2 = Yang | first2 = Lang | date = October 2012 | title = Label-free detection with high-Q microcavities: a review of biosensing mechanisms for integrated devices | url = http://www.degruyter.com/dg/viewarticle.fullcontentlink:pdfeventlink/$002fj$002fnanoph.2012.1.issue-3-4$002fnanoph-2012-0021$002fnanoph-2012-0021.xml?t:ac=j$002fnanoph.2012.1.issue-3-4$002fnanoph-2012-0021$002fnanoph-2012-0021.xml | journal = Nanophotonics | volume = 1 | issue = 3–4| pages = 267–291 | doi = 10.1515/nanoph-2012-0021 | pmid = 26918228 |bibcode = 2012Nanop...1..267V | pmc = 4764104 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Different research projects aim to develop new portable devices that uses cheap, environmentally friendly, disposable cartridges that require only simple handling with no need of further processing, washing, or manipulation by expert technicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glam-project.eu|title=Home - GLAM Project - Glass-Laser Multiplexed Biosensor|author=|date=|website=GLAM Project - Glass-Laser Multiplexed Biosensor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organelles===
Organelles form separate compartments inside cells and usually perform function independently. Different kinds of organelles have various metabolic pathways and contain enzymes to fulfill its function. Commonly used organelles include lysosome, chloroplast and mitochondria. The spatial-temporal distribution pattern of calcium is closed related to ubiquitous signaling pathway. Mitochondria actively participate in the metabolism of calcium ions to control the function and also modulate the calcium related signaling pathways. Experiments have proved that mitochondria have the ability to respond to high calcium concentration generated in the proximity by opening the calcium channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rizzuto | first1 = R. | last2 = Pinton | first2 = P. | last3 = Brini | first3 = M. | last4 = Chiesa | first4 = A. | last5 = Filippin | first5 = L. | last6 = Pozzan | first6 = T. | doi = 10.1054/ceca.1999.0076 | title = Mitochondria as biosensors of calcium microdomains | journal = Cell Calcium | volume = 26 | issue = 5 | pages = 193–199 | year = 1999 | pmid =  10643557| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, mitochondria can be used to detect the calcium concentration in medium and the detection is very sensitive due to high spatial resolution. Another application of mitochondria is used for detection of water pollution. Detergent compounds' toxicity will damage the cell and subcellular structure including mitochondria. The detergents will cause a swelling effect which could be measured by an absorbance change. Experiment data shows the change rate is proportional to the detergent concentration, providing a high standard for detection accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bragadin | first1 = M. | last2 = Manente | first2 = S. | last3 = Piazza | first3 = R. | last4 = Scutari | first4 = G. | title = The Mitochondria as Biosensors for the Monitoring of Detergent Compounds in Solution | doi = 10.1006/abio.2001.5097 | journal = Analytical Biochemistry | volume = 292 | issue = 2 | pages = 305–307 | year = 2001 | pmid =  11355867| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cells===
Cells are often used in bioreceptors because they are sensitive to surrounding environment and they can respond to all kinds of stimulants. Cells tend to attach to the surface so they can be easily immobilized. Compared to organelles they remain active for longer period and the reproducibility makes them reusable. They are commonly used to detect global parameter like stress condition, toxicity and organic derivatives. They can also be used to monitor the treatment effect of drugs. One application is to use cells to determine herbicides which are main aquatic contaminant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Védrine | first1 = C. | last2 = Leclerc | first2 = J.-C. | last3 = Durrieu | first3 = C. | last4 = Tran-Minh | first4 = C. | year = 2003 | title = Optical whole-cell biosensor using Chlorella vulgaris designed for monitoring herbicides | url = | journal = Biosensors &amp; Bioelectronics | volume = 18 | issue = 4| pages = 457–63 | doi=10.1016/s0956-5663(02)00157-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microalgae are entrapped on a quartz [[microfiber]] and the chlorophyll fluorescence modified by herbicides is collected at the tip of an optical fiber bundle and transmitted to a fluorimeter. The algae are continuously cultured to get optimized measurement. Results show that detection limit of certain herbicide can reach sub-ppb concentration level. Some cells can also be used to monitor the microbial corrosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dubey | first1 = R. S. | last2 = Upadhyay | first2 = S.

The respiration activity is determined by measuring oxygen consumption. There is linear relationship between the current generated and the concentration of sulfuric acid. The response time is related to the loading of cells and surrounding environments and can be controlled to no more than 5min.

===Tissue===
Tissues are used for biosensor for the abundance of enzymes existed. Advantages of tissues as biosensors include the following:&lt;ref name=planttissue&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Campàs | first1 = M. | last2 = Carpentier | first2 = R. | last3 = Rouillon | first3 = R. | doi = 10.1016/j.biotechadv.2008.04.001 | title = Plant tissue-and photosynthesis-based biosensors | journal = Biotechnology Advances | volume = 26 | issue = 4 | pages = 370–378 | year = 2008 | pmid =  18495408| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* easier to immobilize compared to cells and organelles
* the higher activity and stability from maintain enzymes in natural environment
* the availability and low price
* the avoidance of tedious work of extraction, centrifuge and purification of enzymes
* necessary cofactors for enzyme to function exists
* the diversity providing a wide range of choice concerning different objectives.

There also exist some disadvantages of tissues, like the lack of specificity due to the interference of other enzymes and longer response time due to transport barrier.

==Surface attachment of the biological elements==
An important part in a biosensor is to attach the biological elements (small molecules/protein/cells) to the surface of the sensor (be it metal, polymer or glass). The simplest way is to [[Surface engineering|functionalize]] the surface in order to coat it with the biological elements. This can be done by polylysine, aminosilane, epoxysilane or nitrocellulose in the case of silicon chips/silica glass. Subsequently, the bound biological agent may be for example fixed by [[Layer by layer]] depositation of alternatively charged polymer coatings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pickup | first1 = JC | last2 = Zhi | first2 = ZL | last3 = Khan | first3 = F | last4 = Saxl | first4 = T | last5 = Birch | first5 = DJ | year = 2008 | title = Nanomedicine and its potential in diabetes research and practice | url = | journal = Diabetes Metab Res Rev. | volume = 24 | issue = 8| pages = 604–10 | doi=10.1002/dmrr.893 | pmid=18802934}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively three-dimensional lattices ([[hydrogel]]/[[xerogel]]) can be used to chemically or physically entrap these (where by chemically entraped it is meant that the biological element is kept in place by a strong bond, while physically they are kept in place being unable to pass through the pores of the gel matrix). The most commonly used hydrogel is [[sol-gel]], a glassy silica generated by polymerization of silicate monomers (added as tetra alkyl orthosilicates, such as [[Tetramethyl orthosilicate|TMOS]] or [[Tetraethyl orthosilicate|TEOS]]) in the presence of the biological elements (along with other stabilizing polymers, such as [[Polyethylene glycol|PEG]]) in the case of physical entrapment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gupta | first1 = R | last2 = Chaudhury | first2 = NK | date = May 2007 | title = Entrapment of biomolecules in sol-gel matrix for applications in biosensors: problems and future prospects | url = | journal = Biosens Bioelectron | volume = 22 | issue = 11| pages = 2387–99 | doi=10.1016/j.bios.2006.12.025 | pmid=17291744}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another group of hydrogels, which set under conditions suitable for cells or protein, are [[Acrylate polymer|acrylate]] hydrogel, which polymerize upon [[radical initiator|radical initiation]]. One type of radical initiator is a [[peroxide]] radical, typically generated by combining a [[Ammonium persulfate|persulfate]] with [[Tetramethylethylenediamine|TEMED]] ([[Polyacrylamide gel]] are also commonly used for [[protein electrophoresis]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Clark | first1 = HA | last2 = Kopelman | first2 = R | last3 = Tjalkens | first3 = R | last4 = Philbert | first4 = MA | date = November 1999 | title = Optical nanosensors for chemical analysis inside single living cells. 2.

==Biotransducer==
{{main|Biotransducer}}
[[File:Biosensors based on biotransducers.png|thumb|Classification of biosensors based on type of biotransducer]]
Biosensors can be classified by their [[biotransducer]] type. The most common types of biotransducers used in biosensors are:

* electrochemical biosensors
* optical biosensors
* electronic biosensors
* piezoelectric biosensors
* gravimetric biosensors
* pyroelectric biosensors

===Electrochemical===
Electrochemical biosensors are normally based on enzymatic catalysis of a reaction that produces or consumes electrons (such enzymes are rightly called redox enzymes). The sensor substrate usually contains three [[electrode]]s; a [[reference electrode]], a working electrode and a counter electrode. The target analyte is involved in the reaction that takes place on the active electrode surface, and the reaction may cause either electron transfer across the double layer (producing a current) or can contribute to the double layer potential (producing a voltage).  We can either measure the current (rate of flow of electrons is now proportional to the analyte concentration) at a fixed potential or the potential can be measured at zero current (this gives a logarithmic response).  Note that potential of the working or active electrode is space charge sensitive and this is often used. Further, the label-free and direct electrical detection of small peptides and proteins is possible by their intrinsic charges using biofunctionalized ion-sensitive field-effect transistors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lud | first1 = S.Q. | last2 = Nikolaides | first2 = M.G. | last3 = Haase | first3 = I. | last4 = Fischer | first4 = M. | last5 = Bausch | first5 = A.R. | year = 2006 | title = Field Effect of Screened Charges: Electrical Detection of Peptides and Proteins by a Thin Film Resistor | url = | journal = ChemPhysChem | volume = 7 | issue = 2| pages = 379–384 | doi = 10.1002/cphc.200500484 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example, the potentiometric biosensor, (potential produced at zero current) gives a logarithmic response with a high dynamic range. Such biosensors are often made by screen printing the electrode patterns on a plastic substrate, coated with a conducting polymer and then some protein (enzyme or antibody) is attached.  They have only two electrodes and are extremely sensitive and robust. They enable the detection of analytes at levels previously only achievable by HPLC and LC/MS and without rigorous sample preparation. All biosensors usually involve minimal sample preparation as the biological sensing component is highly selective for the analyte concerned.  The signal is produced by electrochemical and physical changes in the conducting polymer layer due to changes occurring at the surface of the sensor. Such changes can be attributed to ionic strength, pH, hydration and redox reactions, the latter due to the enzyme label turning over a substrate.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20151222110305/http://www.universalsensors.co.uk/&lt;/ref&gt; Field effect transistors, in which the gate region has been modified with an enzyme or antibody, can also detect very low concentrations of various analytes as the binding of the analyte to the gate region of the FET cause a change in the drain-source current.

Impedance spectroscopy based biosensor development has been gaining traction nowadays and many such devices / developments are found in the academia and industry. One such device, based on a 4-electrode electrochemical cell, using a nanoporous alumina membrane, has been shown to detect low concentrations of human alpha thrombin in presence of high background of serum albumin. &lt;ref&gt;Agnivo Gosai, Brendan Shin Hau Yeah, Marit Nilsen-Hamilton, Pranav Shrotriya,Label Free Thrombin Detection in Presence of High Concentration of Albumin Using an Aptamer-Functionalized Nanoporous Membrane,Biosensors and Bioelectronics,2018,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2018.10.010.&lt;/ref&gt;

of target biological molecules.&lt;ref name=Vockenroth2005&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vockenroth I, Atanasova P, Knoll W, Jenkins A, Köper I |title= Functional tethered bilayer membranes as a biosensor platform |journal=IEEE Sensors 2005 – the 4-th IEEE Conference on Sensors |volume= |issue= |pages=608–610 |year=2005 |doi= 10.1109/icsens.2005.1597772|isbn= 0-7803-9056-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By embedding the ion channels in supported or [[Model lipid bilayer|tethered bilayer membranes]] (t-BLM) attached to a gold electrode, an electrical circuit is created. Capture molecules such as antibodies can be bound to the ion channel so that the binding of the target molecule controls the ion flow through the channel. This results in a measurable change in the electrical conduction which is proportional to the concentration of the target.

An ion channel switch (ICS) biosensor can be created using gramicidin, a dimeric peptide channel, in a tethered bilayer membrane.&lt;ref name=Cornell1997&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cornell BA |title= A biosensor that uses ion-channel switches |journal=Nature |volume=387 |issue=6633 |pages=580–583 |year=1997 |doi=10.1038/42432 |pmid=9177344 |author2=BraachMaksvytis VLB |author3=King LG |display-authors=3 |last4=Osman |first4=P.

The magnitude of the change in electrical signal is greatly increased by separating the membrane from the metal surface using a hydrophilic spacer.

Quantitative detection of an extensive class of target species, including proteins, bacteria, drug and toxins has been demonstrated using different membrane and capture configurations.&lt;ref name=Oh2008&gt;{{cite journal |author=Oh S |title=Rapid detection of influenza A virus in clinical samples using an ion channel switch biosensor |journal=Biosensors &amp; Bioelectronics |volume=23 |issue=7 |pages=1161–1165 |year=2008 |doi=10.1016/j.bios.2007.10.011 |author2=Cornell B |author3=Smith D |display-authors=3 |last4=Higgins |first4=G. |last5=Burrell |first5=C.J. |last6=Kok |first6=T.W. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Krishnamurthy2010&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Krishnamurthy V, Monfared S, Cornell B |title= : Ion Channel Biosensors Part I Construction Operation and Clinical Studies|journal=IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=313–322  |year=2010 |doi=  10.1109/TNANO.2010.2041466|bibcode = 2010ITNan...9..313K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reagentless fluorescent biosensor===
A reagentless biosensor can monitor a target analyte in a complex biological mixture without additional reagent. Therefore, it can function continuously if immobilized on a solid support. A fluorescent biosensor reacts to the interaction with its target analyte by a change of its fluorescence properties. A Reagentless Fluorescent biosensor (RF biosensor) can be obtained by integrating a biological receptor, which is directed against the target analyte, and a solvatochromic fluorophore, whose emission properties are sensitive to the nature of its local environment, in a single macromolecule. The fluorophore transduces the recognition event into a measurable optical signal. The use of extrinsic fluorophores, whose emission properties differ widely from those of the intrinsic fluorophores of proteins, tryptophan and tyrosine, enables one to immediately detect and quantify the analyte in complex biological mixtures. The integration of the fluorophore must be done in a site where it is sensitive to the binding of the analyte without perturbing the affinity of the receptor.

Antibodies and artificial families of Antigen Binding Proteins (AgBP) are well suited to provide the recognition module of RF biosensors since they can be directed against any antigen (see the paragraph on bioreceptors). A general approach to integrate a solvatochromic fluorophore in an AgBP when the atomic structure of the complex with its antigen is known, and thus transform it into a RF biosensor, has been described.&lt;ref name="pmid19945965"/&gt; A residue of the AgBP is identified in the neighborhood of the antigen in their complex. This residue is changed into a cysteine by site-directed mutagenesis. The fluorophore is chemically coupled to the mutant cysteine. When the design is successful, the coupled fluorophore does not prevent the binding of the antigen, this binding shields the fluorophore from the solvent, and it can be detected by a change of fluorescence. This strategy is also valid for antibody fragments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Renard|first1=M|last2=Belkadi|first2=L|last3=Hugo|first3=N|last4=England|first4=P|last5=Altschuh|first5=D|last6=Bedouelle|first6=H|title=Knowledge-based design of reagentless fluorescent biosensors from recombinant antibodies|journal=J Mol Biol|date=Apr 2002|volume=318|issue=2|pages=429–442|doi=10.1016/S0022-2836(02)00023-2|pmid=12051849}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Renard|first1=M|last2=Bedouelle|first2=H|title=Improving the sensitivity and dynamic range of reagentless fluorescent immunosensors by knowledge-based design|journal=Biochemistry|date=Dec 2004|volume=43|issue=49|pages=15453–15462|doi=10.1021/bi048922s|pmid=15581357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the absence of specific structural data, other strategies must be applied. Antibodies and artificial families of AgBPs are constituted by a set of hypervariable (or randomized) residue positions, located in a unique sub-region of the protein, and supported by a constant polypeptide scaffold. The residues that form the binding site for a given antigen, are selected among the hypervariable residues. It is possible to transform any AgBP of these families into a RF biosensor, specific of the target antigen, simply by coupling a solvatochromic fluorophore to one of the hypervariable residues that have little or no importance for the interaction with the antigen, after changing this residue into cysteine by mutagenesis. More specifically, the strategy consists in individually changing the residues of the hypervariable positions into cysteine at the genetic level, in chemically coupling a solvatochromic fluorophore with the mutant cysteine, and then in keeping the resulting conjugates that have the highest sensitivity (a parameter that involves both affinity and variation of fluorescence signal).&lt;ref name="pmid21565483"/&gt; This approach is also valid for families of antibody fragments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Renard|first1=M|last2=Belkadi|first2=L|last3=Bedouelle|first3=H|title=Deriving topological constraints from functional data for the design of reagentless fluorescent immunosensors|journal=J.

A posteriori studies have shown that the best reagentless fluorescent biosensors are obtained when the fluorophore does not make non-covalent interactions with the surface of the bioreceptor, which would increase the background signal, and when it interacts with a binding pocket at the surface of the target antigen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Picciotto|first1=S|last2=Dickson|first2=PM|last3=Traxlmayr|first3=MW|last4=Marques|first4=BS|last5=Socher|first5=E|last6=Zhao|first6=S|last7=Cheung|first7=S|last8=Kiefer|first8=JD|last9=Wand|first9=AJ|last10=Griffith|first10=LG|last11=Imperiali|first11=B|last12=Wittrup|first12=KD|title=Design Principles for SuCESsFul Biosensors: Specific Fluorophore/Analyte Binding and Minimization of Fluorophore/Scaffold Interactions|journal=J Mol Biol|date=Jul 2016|doi=10.1016/j.jmb.2016.07.004|pmid=27448945|pmc=5048519|volume=428|issue=20|pages=4228–4241}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RF biosensors that are obtained by the above methods, can function and detect target analytes inside living cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kummer|first1=L|last2=Hsu|first2=CW|last3=Dagliyan|first3=O|last4=MacNevin|first4=C|last5=Kaufholz|first5=M|last6=Zimmermann|first6=B|last7=Dokholyan|first7=NV|last8=Hahn|first8=KM|last9=Plückthun|first9=A|title=Knowledge-based design of a biosensor to quantify localized ERK activation in living cells|journal=Chem Biol|date=Jun 2013|volume=20|issue=6|pages=847–856|doi=10.1016/j.chembiol.2013.04.016|pmid=23790495|pmc=4154710}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Others===
[[Piezoelectric]] sensors utilise crystals which undergo an elastic deformation when an electrical potential is applied to them.  An alternating potential (A.C.) produces a standing wave in the crystal at a characteristic frequency.  This frequency is highly dependent on the elastic properties of the crystal, such that if a crystal is coated with a biological recognition element the binding of a (large) target analyte to a receptor will produce a change in the resonance frequency, which gives a binding signal. In a mode that uses surface acoustic waves (SAW), the sensitivity is greatly increased. This is a specialised application of the [[quartz crystal microbalance]] as a biosensor

[[Electrochemiluminescence]] (ECL) is nowadays a leading technique in biosensors.&lt;ref name="Forster"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Forster RJ, Bertoncello P, Keyes TE | title=Electrogenerated Chemiluminescence | journal=Annual Review of Analytical Chemistry | year=2009 | pages=359–85| volume=2 | pmid=20636067 |url=http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-anchem-060908-155305 | doi=10.1146/annurev-anchem-060908-155305|bibcode = 2009ARAC....2..359F }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Valenti"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Valenti G, Fiorani A, Li H, Sojic N, Paolucci F | title=Essential Role of Electrode Materials in Electrochemiluminescence Applications | journal=ChemElectroChem | year=2016 | pages=1990–1997| volume=3 | issue=12 | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/celc.201600602/full | doi= 10.1002/celc.201600602 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the excited species are produced with an electrochemical stimulus rather than with a light excitation source, ECL displays improved signal-to-noise ratio compared to photoluminescence, with minimized effects due to light scattering and luminescence background. In particular, coreactant ECL operating in buffered aqueous solution in the region of positive potentials (oxidative-reduction mechanism) definitively boosted ECL for immunoassay, as confirmed by many research applications and, even more, by the presence of important companies which developed commercial hardware for high throughput immunoassays analysis in a market worth billions of dollars each year.

Thermometric and magnetic based biosensors are rare.

==Placement of biosensors==
The appropriate placement of biosensors depends on their field of application, which may roughly be divided into [[biotechnology]], [[agriculture]], [[food technology]] and [[biomedicine]].

In biotechnology, analysis of the chemical composition of [[microbial culture|cultivation]] broth can be conducted in-line, on-line, at-line and off-line. As outlined by the US Food and Drug Administration ([[FDA]]) the sample is not removed from the process stream for in-line sensors, while it is diverted from the manufacturing process for on-line measurements.  For at-line sensors the sample may be removed and analyzed in close proximity to the process stream.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Guidance for Industry: PAT — A Framework for Innovative Pharmaceutical Development, Manufacturing, and Quality Assurance  | editor = US Department of Health and Human Services | editor2 = Food and Drug Administration | editor3 = Center for Drug Evaluation and Research | editor4 = Center for Veterinary Medicine | editor5 = Office of Regulatory Affairs | date = September 2004 | url = http://www.gmp-compliance.org/guidemgr/files/PAT-FDA-6419FNL.PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of the latter is the monitoring of lactose in a dairy processing plant.&lt;ref&gt;Pasco, Neil; Glithero, Nick.

These techniques are mainly used in agriculture, food technology and biomedicine.

In medical applications biosensors are generally categorized as ''[[in vitro]]'' and ''[[in vivo]]'' systems. An ''in vitro'', biosensor measurement takes place in a test tube, a culture dish, a microtiter plate or elsewhere outside a living organism.  The sensor uses a bioreceptor and transducer as outlined above.  An example of an ''in vitro'' biosensor is an enzyme-conductimetric biosensor for [[blood glucose monitoring]]. There is a challenge to create a biosensor that operates by the principle of [[point-of-care testing]], i.e. at the location where the test is needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kling | first = Jim | year = 2006 | title = Moving diagnostics from the bench to the bedside | journal = Nat.

An application of a POCT biosensor can be for the testing of [[HIV]] in areas where it is difficult for patients to be tested.  A biosensor can be sent directly to the location and a quick and easy test can be used.

An ''in vivo'' biosensor is an [[implant (medicine)|implantable device]] that operates inside the body. Of course, biosensor implants have to fulfill the strict regulations on [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilization]] in order to avoid an initial inflammatory response after implantation.  The second concern relates to the long-term [[biocompatibility]], i.e. the unharmful interaction with the body environment during the intended period of use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kotanen | first1 = Christian N. | last2 = Gabriel Moussy | first2 = Francis | last3 = Carrara | first3 = Sandro | last4 = Guiseppi-Elie | first4 = Anthony | year = 2012 | title = Implantable enzyme amperometric biosensors | url = | journal = Biosensors and Bioelectronics | volume = 35 | issue = 1| pages = 14–26 | doi = 10.1016/j.bios.2012.03.016 | pmid=22516142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another issue that arises is failure.  If there is failure, the device must be removed and replaced, causing additional surgery.  An example for application of an in vivo biosensor would be the insulin monitoring within the body, which is not available yet.

Most advanced biosensor implants have been developed for the continuous monitoring of glucose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gough | first1 = David A. | last2 = Kumosa | first2 = Lucas S. | last3 = Routh | first3 = Timothy L. | last4 = Lin | first4 = Joe T. | last5 = Lucisano | first5 = Joseph Y. | year = 2010 | title = Function of an Implanted Tissue Glucose Sensor for More than 1 Year in Animals | journal = Sci.

==Applications==

There are many potential applications of biosensors of various types.  The main requirements for a biosensor approach to be valuable in terms of research and commercial applications are the identification of a target molecule, availability of a suitable biological recognition element, and the potential for disposable portable detection systems to be preferred to sensitive laboratory-based techniques in some situations.  Some examples are glucose monitoring in diabetes patients, other medical health related targets, environmental applications e.g. the detection of [[pesticides]] and river water contaminants such as heavy metal ions,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cheme.utm.my/staff/saharudin/content/view/24/42/ Saharudin Haron]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305044403/http://www.cheme.utm.my/staff/saharudin/content/view/24/42/ |date=5 March 2016  }} and Asim K.

H | isbn=978-3-540-75200-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and detection of toxic metabolites such as [[mycotoxin]]s.

A common example of a commercial biosensor is the [[blood glucose]] biosensor, which uses the enzyme [[glucose oxidase]] to break blood glucose down. In doing so it first oxidizes glucose and uses two electrons to reduce the FAD (a component of the enzyme) to FADH2.  This in turn is oxidized by the electrode in a number of steps.  The resulting current is a measure of the concentration of glucose.  In this case, the electrode is the transducer and the enzyme is the biologically active component.

A [[Domestic Canary#Miner's canary|canary in a cage]], as used by miners to warn of gas, could be considered a biosensor. Many of today's biosensor applications are similar, in that they use organisms which respond to [[toxic]] substances at a much lower concentrations than humans can detect to warn of their presence. Such devices can be used in environmental monitoring,&lt;ref name="MolluSCAN eye"&gt;{{cite web|title=MolluSCAN eye|url=http://molluscan-eye.epoc.u-bordeaux1.fr/index.php?rubrique=accueil&amp;lang=en|website=MolluSCAN eye|publisher=CNRS &amp; Université de Bordeaux|accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; trace gas detection and in water treatment facilities.

Many optical biosensors are based on the phenomenon of [[surface plasmon resonance]] (SPR) techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=S.Zeng|title=Nanomaterials enhanced surface plasmon resonance for biological and chemical sensing applications |journal=Chemical Society Reviews|volume=43 |pages=3426–3452 |year=2014|doi=10.1039/C3CS60479A|last2= Baillargeat|first2= Dominique|last3=Ho|first3=Ho-Pui|last4=Yong|first4=Ken-Tye |pmid=24549396 |issue=10|display-authors=etal|url=http://dr.ntu.edu.sg/bitstream/handle/10220/18851/Nanomaterials%20enhanced%20surface%20plasmon%20resonance%20for%20biological%20and%20chemical%20sensing%20applications.pdf?sequence=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Krupin, O. |author2=Wang, C. |author3=Berini, P.|title=Optical plasmonic biosensor for leukemia detection|journal=SPIE Newsroom|issue=22 January 2016|doi=10.1117/2.1201512.006268|year=2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This utilises a property of and other materials; specifically that a thin layer of gold on a high refractive index glass surface can absorb laser light, producing electron waves (surface plasmons) on the gold surface.  This occurs only at a specific angle and wavelength of incident light and is highly dependent on the surface of the gold, such that binding of a target [[analyte]] to a receptor on the gold surface produces a measurable signal.

Surface plasmon resonance sensors operate using a sensor chip consisting of a plastic cassette supporting a glass plate, one side of which is coated with a microscopic layer of gold.  This side contacts the optical detection apparatus of the instrument.  The opposite side is then contacted with a microfluidic flow system.  The contact with the flow system creates channels across which reagents can be passed in solution.  This side of the glass sensor chip can be modified in a number of ways, to allow easy attachment of molecules of interest.  Normally it is coated in carboxymethyl [[dextran]] or similar compound.

The refractive index at the flow side of the chip surface has a direct influence on the behavior of the light reflected off the gold side.  Binding to the flow side of the chip has an effect on the [[refractive]] index and in this way biological interactions can be measured to a high degree of sensitivity with some sort of energy. The refractive index of the medium near the surface changes when biomolecules attach to the surface, and the SPR angle varies as a function of this change.

Light of a fixed wavelength is reflected off the gold side of the chip at the angle of total internal reflection, and detected inside the instrument. The angle of incident light is varied in order to match the evanescent wave propagation rate with the propagation rate of the surface plasmon plaritons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Homola J |title= Present and future of surface plasmon resonance biosensors |journal= Anal. Bioanal. Chem. |volume=377 |issue=3 |pages=528–539 |year=2003 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/8x2n9xhbkqtp76dq |doi=10.1007/s00216-003-2101-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This induces the evanescent wave to penetrate through the glass plate and some distance into the liquid flowing over the surface.

Other optical biosensors are mainly based on changes in absorbance or fluorescence of an appropriate indicator compound and do not need a total internal reflection geometry. For example, a fully operational prototype device detecting casein in milk has been fabricated. The device is based on detecting changes in absorption of a gold layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hiep | first1 = H.

Technol. Adv. Mater. | volume = 8 | issue = 4| pages = 331–338 |bibcode = 2007STAdM...8..331M }}&lt;/ref&gt; A widely used research tool, the micro-array, can also be considered a biosensor.

Biological biosensors often incorporate a genetically modified form of a native protein or enzyme. The protein is configured to detect a specific analyte and the ensuing signal is read by a detection instrument such as a fluorometer or luminometer. An example of a recently developed biosensor is one for detecting [[cytosol]]ic concentration of the analyte cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate), a second messenger involved in cellular signaling triggered by ligands interacting with receptors on the cell membrane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fan | first1 = F. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2008 | title = Novel Genetically Encoded Biosensors Using Firefly Luciferase | url = http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/cb8000414 | journal = ACS Chem. Biol. | volume = 3 | issue = 6| pages = 346–51 | doi=10.1021/cb8000414| pmid = 18570354 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar systems have been created to study cellular responses to native ligands or xenobiotics (toxins or small molecule inhibitors). Such "assays" are commonly used in drug discovery development by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Most cAMP assays in current use require lysis of the cells prior to measurement of cAMP. A live-cell biosensor for cAMP can be used in non-lysed cells with the additional advantage of multiple reads to study the kinetics of receptor response.

Nanobiosensors use an immobilized bioreceptor probe that is selective for target analyte molecules. Nanomaterials are exquisitely sensitive chemical and biological sensors. Nanoscale materials demonstrate unique properties. Their large surface area to volume ratio can achieve rapid and low cost reactions, using a variety of designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Urban | first1 = Gerald A | year = 2009 | title =  Micro- and nanobiosensors—state of the art and trends| url = | journal = Meas.

Other evanescent wave biosensors have been commercialised using waveguides where the propagation constant through the waveguide is changed by the absorption of molecules to the waveguide surface. One such example, [[dual polarisation interferometry]] uses a buried waveguide as a reference against which the change in propagation constant is measured. Other configurations such as the [[Mach–Zehnder]] have reference arms lithographically defined on a substrate. Higher levels of integration can be achieved using resonator geometries where the resonant frequency of a ring resonator changes when molecules are absorbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Iqbal | first1 = M. | last2 = Gleeson | first2 = M.

Recently, arrays of many different detector molecules have been applied in so called [[electronic nose]] devices, where the pattern of response from the detectors is used to fingerprint a substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UCSB sensor sniffs explosives through microfluidics, might replace Rover at the airport (video) |url=http://www.microfluidicsolutions.com/apps/blog/show/20808263-ucsb-sensor-sniffs-explosives-through-microfluidics-might-replace-rover-at-the-airport-video- |publisher=Microfluidic Solutions |date=8 December 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140704002927/http://www.microfluidicsolutions.com/apps/blog/show/20808263-ucsb-sensor-sniffs-explosives-through-microfluidics-might-replace-rover-at-the-airport-video- |archivedate=4 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Wasp Hound]] odor-detector, the mechanical element is a video camera and the biological element is five parasitic wasps who have been conditioned to swarm in response to the presence of a specific chemical.&lt;ref name=scicentr&gt;{{cite web|title=Wasp Hound |url=http://www.sciencentral.com/articles/view.php3?article_id=218392717 |publisher=Science Central |accessdate=23 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716014856/http://www.sciencentral.com/articles/view.php3?article_id=218392717 |archivedate=16 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Current commercial electronic noses, however, do not use biological elements.

===Glucose monitoring===
{{main|Blood glucose monitoring}}
Commercially available glucose monitors rely on [[Blood glucose monitoring|amperometric sensing of glucose]] by means of [[glucose oxidase]], which oxidises glucose producing hydrogen peroxide which is detected by the electrode. To overcome the limitation of amperometric sensors, a flurry of research is present into novel sensing methods, such as [[fluorescent glucose biosensors]].&lt;ref name="ghoshdastider"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ghoshdastider U, Wu R, Trzaskowski B, Mlynarczyk K, Miszta P, Gurusaran M, Viswanathan S, Renugopalakrishnan V, Filipek S | title = Nano-Encapsulation of Glucose Oxidase Dimer by Graphene | journal = RSC Advances | volume = 5 | issue = 18 | pages = 13570–78 | date = 2015 | doi = 10.1039/C4RA16852F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interferometric reflectance imaging sensor===
The interferometric reflectance imaging sensor (IRIS) is based on the principles of [[Interference (wave propagation)|optical interference]] and consists of a silicon-silicon oxide substrate, standard optics, and low-powered coherent LEDs. When light is illuminated through a low magnification objective onto the layered silicon-silicon oxide substrate, an interferometric signature is produced. As biomass, which has a similar [[index of refraction]] as silicon oxide, accumulates on the substrate surface, a change in the interferometric signature occurs and the change can be correlated to a quantifiable mass. ''Daaboul et al.'' used IRIS to yield a label-free sensitivity of approximately 19&amp;nbsp;ng/mL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Daaboul | first1 = G.G. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2010 | title = LED-based Interferometric Reflectance Imaging Sensor for quantitative dynamic monitoring of biomolecular interactions| url = | journal = Biosens.

Since initial publication, IRIS has been adapted to perform various functions. First, IRIS integrated a fluorescence imaging capability into the interferometric imaging instrument as a potential way to address fluorescence protein microarray variability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reddington | first1 = A. | last2 = Trueb | first2 = J.

===Food analysis===
There are several applications of biosensors in food analysis. In the food industry, optics coated with antibodies are commonly used to detect pathogens and food toxins. Commonly, the light system in these biosensors is fluorescence, since this type of optical measurement can greatly amplify the signal.

A range of immuno- and ligand-binding assays for the detection and measurement of small molecules such as [[water-soluble vitamins]] and chemical contaminants ([[drug residues]]) such as [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamides]] and [[Beta-agonists]] have been developed for use on [[Surface plasmon resonance|SPR]] based sensor systems, often adapted from existing [[ELISA]] or other immunological assay.  These are in widespread use across the food industry.

===DNA biosensors===
In the future, DNA will find use as a versatile material from which scientists can craft biosensors.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} DNA biosensors can theoretically be used for medical diagnostics, forensic science, agriculture, or even environmental clean-up efforts. No external monitoring is needed for DNA-based sensing devises. This is a significant advantage. DNA biosensors are complicated mini-machines—consisting of sensing elements, micro lasers, and a signal generator. At the heart of DNA biosensor function is the fact that two strands of DNA stick to each other by virtue of chemical attractive forces. On such a sensor, only an exact fit—that is, two strands that match up at every nucleotide position—gives rise to a fluorescent signal (a glow) that is then transmitted to a signal generator.

===Microbial biosensors===
Using biological engineering researchers have created many microbial biosensors. An example is the arsenic biosensor. To detect arsenic they use the [[Ars operon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002480000095|title=Construction and use of broad host range mercury and arsenite sensor plasmids in the soil bacterium ''Pseudomonas fluorescens'' OS8 |first1=T.|last1=Petänen|first2=M.|last2=Virta|first3=M.|last3=Karp|first4=M.|last4=Romantschuk|date=|journal=Microbial Ecology|volume=41|issue=4|pages=360–368|doi=10.1007/s002480000095|pmid=12032610}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using bacteria, researchers can detect pollutants in samples.

===Ozone biosensors===
Because [[ozone]] filters out harmful ultraviolet radiation, the discovery of holes in the ozone layer of the earth's atmosphere has raised concern about how much [[ultraviolet light]] reaches the earth's surface. Of particular concern are the questions of how deeply into sea water ultraviolet radiation penetrates and how it affects [[Marine life|marine organisms]], especially [[plankton]] (floating microorganisms) and [[virus]]es that attack plankton. Plankton form the base of the marine food chains and are believed to affect our planet's temperature and weather by uptake of CO&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt; for photosynthesis.

Deneb Karentz, a researcher at the Laboratory of Radio-biology and Environmental Health ([[University of California, San Francisco]]) has devised a simple method for measuring ultraviolet penetration and intensity. Working in the Antarctic Ocean, she submerged to various depths thin plastic bags containing special strains of ''E. coli'' that are almost totally unable to repair ultraviolet radiation damage to their DNA. Bacterial death rates in these bags were compared with rates in unexposed control bags of the same organism. The bacterial "biosensors" revealed constant significant ultraviolet damage at depths of 10 m and frequently at 20 and 30 m. Karentz plans additional studies of how ultraviolet may affect seasonal plankton [[Algal bloom|bloom]]s (growth spurts) in the oceans.&lt;ref&gt;J. G. Black,"Principles and explorations", edition 5th.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metastatic cancer cell biosensors ===

Metastasis is the spread of cancer from one part of the body to another via either the circulatory system or lymphatic system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hanahan | first1 = Douglas | last2 = Weinberg | first2 = Robert A. | year = 2011 | title = Hallmarks of Cancer: The Next Generation | url = | journal = Cell | volume = 144 | issue = 5| pages = 646–74 | doi=10.1016/j.cell.2011.02.013 | pmid=21376230}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike radiology imaging tests (mammograms), which send forms of energy (x-rays, magnetic fields, etc.) through the body to only take interior pictures, biosensors have the potential to directly test the malignant power of the tumor. The combination of a biological and detector element allows for a small sample requirement, a compact design, rapid signals, rapid detection, high selectivity and high sensitivity for the analyte being studied. Compared to the usual radiology imaging tests biosensors have the advantage of not only finding out how far the cancer has spread and checking if treatment is effective, but also are cheaper, more efficient (in time, cost and productivity) ways to assess metastaticity in early stages of cancer.

Biological engineering researchers have created oncological biosensors for breast cancer.&lt;ref name="Atay, Seda 2016"&gt;Atay, Seda, Kevser Pişkin, Fatma Yılmaz, Canan Çakır, Handan Yavuz, and Adil Denizli. "Quartz Crystal Microbalance Based Biosensors for Detecting Highly Metastatic Breast Cancer Cells via Their Transferrin Receptors." Anal. Methods 8.1 (2016): 153-61. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Breast cancer is the leading common cancer among women worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Nordqvist, Christian. "Breast Cancer Cancer / Oncology Women's Health / Gynecology Breast Cancer: Causes, Symptoms and Treatments." Medical News Today. N.p., 5 May 2016. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; An example would be a transferrin- quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). As a biosensor, [[quartz crystal microbalance]]s produce oscillations in the frequency of the crystal’s standing wave from an alternating potential to detect nano-gram mass changes. These biosensors are specifically designed to interact and have high selectivity for receptors on cell (cancerous and normal) surfaces. Ideally this provides a quantitative detection of cells with this receptor per surface area instead of a qualitative picture detection given by mammograms.

Seda Atay, a biotechnology researcher at Hacettepe University, experimentally observed this specificity and selectivity between a QCM and [[MDA-MB 231]] breast cells, [[MCF 7]] cells, and starved MDA-MB 231 cells in vitro.&lt;ref name="Atay, Seda 2016"/&gt; With other researchers she devised a method of washing these different metastatic leveled cells over the sensors to measure mass shifts due to different quantities of transferrin receptors. Particularly, the metastatic power of breast cancer cells can be determined by Quartz crystal microbalances with nanoparticles and transferrin that would potentially attach to transferrin receptors on cancer cell surfaces. There is very high selectivity for transferrin receptors because they are over-expressed in cancer cells. If cells have high expression of transferrin receptors, which shows their high metastatic power, they have higher affinity and bind more to the QCM that measures the increase in mass. Depending on the magnitude of the nano-gram mass change, the metastatic power can be determined.

==== Purpose of nanoparticles ====

When nanoparticles are attached to the QCM surface their simplicity, variability in shape, high surface area, physicochemical malleability, and optional attachment of metals enables for different properties, a change in responses, selectivities and specificities. This transducer’s characteristics in combination with nanoparticles with large surface area to volume ratios makes it a perfect biosensor to particularly determine the metastatic power and malignancy of cancer cells. In Seda Atay’s study, determining the metastatic power of in vitro breast cancer exactly required 58&amp;nbsp;nm sized Poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA) nanoparticles with a surface area of 1899 m2g-1 to effectively adsorb the cells to the QCM surface.

== About COMBREX ==

[http://combrex.bu.edu COMBREX] is a multifaceted project that aims to bring together the computational and experimental communities of biologists in the interest of improving our understanding of microbial gene function and accelerating the annotation of microbial gene function. The COMBREX project was co-founded by Simon Kasif, Richard Roberts and Martin Steffen as an international consortium with a headquarters at Boston University and over 100 experimental and computational collaborators.  The project was inspired by a call for community action published in PLoS Biology by Richard J. Roberts.

== The COMBREX Project currently includes ==

=== [http://combrex.bu.edu A Database of genes and functions] ===

This evolving database consists of experimentally determined and computationally predicted functions for more than three million microbial genes. Searching for a gene or genes of interest may be an end in itself, or it may be a first step toward contributing information to or seeking a grant from COMBREX. The database presently consists of genes from over 1000 completely sequenced bacterial and archaeal genomes, supplemented with a number of individual genes whose biochemical function has been experimentally determined. The genes are organized into sequence-similar, and likely isofunctional, groups determined by NCBI, referred to as Protein Clusters.

A color-coding system is used to identify which genes have experimentally determined functions, which have computationally predicted functions, and which have no known or predicted function [http://combrex.bu.edu/help_center.jsp#glossary (info)]. By necessity, "predicted functions" may encompass a broad range of specificity, and one of our longer range goals is to quantify this specificity. (For example, the predicted function "valine decarboxylase" is significantly more specific, and more readily verifiable, than "lyase", or even "carboxy-lyase".)

Identification of genes whose products have been experimentally verified is also not a trivial task, and so we have embarked on a project to create a comprehensive, manually curated set of all such genes, which we refer to as the [http://combrex.bu.edu/help_center.jsp#gold Gold Standard Gene Database]. This curated set is at present unique to the COMBREX database, and genes belonging to it are color-coded with a gold symbol.

=== [http://combrex.bu.edu/help_center.jsp#predictions Predictions of Gene Function] ===

The COMBREX database serves as a venue for computational biologists to publicize their most informative gene function predictions. A major effort within the bio-informatics field has been the computational prediction of gene function. There have been significant advances in this field over the last decade or so, but many of these efforts have not realized their full potential to advance biological knowledge due to the fact that predictions are rarely experimentally tested, and predicted functions for individual genes made by competing methods are rarely directly compared.

The COMBREX database, besides drawing information from familiar sources such as NCBI and UniProtKB, also displays gene function predictions submitted by individual laboratories. Such predictions may be generated in large scale using computational algorithms, or may be made for individual genes by experimental or computational biologists well acquainted with a particular protein family or biochemical pathway. Thus, predictions made by different methods may be easily compared, contrasted, and examined by experimental biologists. This side-by-side display of function predictions from many sources is the heart of the interaction between computational and experimental communities that COMBREX hopes to foster.

=== Recommendation and prioritization of experiments based on Active Learning principles. ===

COMBREX uses simple principles as well as more sophisticated [[Active learning (machine learning)|Active Learning]] methodologies to recommend the most informative experiments. These are experiments that are most likely to generate the most informative (in the mathematical sense of maximizing information gain) predictions for the largest number of proteins in the database. The most basic recommendations provide ranking of all proteins in a gene cluster in terms of their distance to other proteins.  In the simplest case proteins near the center of a cluster are judged to be most informative because their distance to the other proteins in the cluster is relatively small.  As a result, functional annotation of a "center" of a cluster is likely to result in the most accurate predictions for the other proteins in the cluster.  In evolutionary terms these "cluster centers" are closest to the evolutionary ancestor of all the proteins in the cluster.  Active Learning generalizes this intuition principle to produce recommendations for additional experiments that are likely to either produce accurate predictions or identify proteins that are not annotated correctly.

In addition to evolutionary analysis and Active Learning COMBREX also points to other criteria that might be considered in considering experiments. Such criteria include whether there is a structure available, conservation of the bacterial gene in the human genome (e.g. domain sharing), availability of computational or experimental evidence of gene function, phenotypical considerations (such as presence in a pathogen or relation to antibiotic resistance, pathogenicity or virulence)and others.

=== [http://combrex.bu.edu/help_center.jsp#bid Grants for the Biochemical Characterization of genes within the COMBREX database] ===

One of the missions of COMBREX is to issue small monetary grants for the experimental validation of specific gene predictions. The experimental determination of biochemical function for specific gene products serves to validate (or invalidate) the computational predictions made a priori. Thus, this experimental effort serves three goals: (1) it brings together directly the scientists who make gene function predictions and those who test them, (2) it evaluates computational methods based on how accurate their predictions are so they can be improved, and (3) it broadens the landscape of experimentally validated genes, improving our overall understanding of biology and of sequence-structure-function relationships.

The experimental investigation of the biochemical function of a single gene or small number of genes is often beneath the purview of large funding agencies. COMBREX is set up to issue small grants for exactly this type of work, and such grants are particularly suited for laboratories already familiar with the types of assays required for the intended experiments.

== What COMBREX is working towards ==

=== Improved gene annotation ===

One of the current problems with gene and genome annotation is a lack of transparency with respect to source. It is often difficult to determine which functions have been determined experimentally and which are predicted computationally. Furthermore, for computationally predicted functions, the method used to make the prediction and the strength of the evidence are rarely stated. COMBREX has taken the first steps toward a more transparent system of annotation by (1) color-coding genes to distinguish observed from predicted functions, and (2) for many functions predicted by sequence similarity, identifying the experimentally validated "source gene" on which the prediction was based.

COMBREX is working towards a more completely traceable annotation system, in which every stated functional annotation is either experimentally determined, or is a prediction explicitly linked through a chain of evidence to an ultimate source of information. These sources will in many cases be experimentally validated genes, but in some cases will be annotations from existing databases whose sources are themselves not immediately apparent.

COMBREX is the first database that attempts to "computationally" identify the link to the experimental source of an annotation using homology. Other databases provide two types of evidence, e.g. inferred directly from experiments or inferred computationally. However, the inference cannot be typically traced to the experimental source of the annotation. COMBREX cannot guarantee that  the "traces"  it provides are accurate at this point but it enables biologists to make this determination directly by examining the link.

This system of identifying source genes and functions, and evidential links, will enable a dynamic system of annotation that is automatically updated as experimental evidence for new genes is determined, and as new predictive methods are developed. Such a dynamic system of gene functional annotation may help overcome the relatively high frequency of unannotated and misannotated genes that results from the static system used in many public databases. Furthermore, it will illuminate those genes whose biochemical functions are truly unknown, as opposed to those that are simply insufficiently annotated.

=== Improved predictive accuracy ===

Making gene functional predictions transparent is important, but equally important is making them as accurate as possible. Predictions need to be commensurate with the strength of evidence for them, such that they are as specific as the evidence will allow. Those that are not specific enough do not lend themselves to experimental testing, and those that are too specific for the underlying evidence run a high risk of being inaccurate. COMBREX is actively working on developing algorithms for functional prediction that can identify genes with novel or interesting functions, and whose results can sit beside the high-quality predictions received from collaborating computational groups. COMBREX's relatively [http://combrex.bu.edu/help_center.jsp#propagation conservative BLAST-based propagation of gene function] represents a simple first step towards this goal.

=== Targeted experimental validation ===

Through its funding decisions, COMBREX can help broaden as well as deepen our understanding of biochemical gene function by encouraging experimental investigation of specific genes. The choice of which genes to validate is an important one: little overall new knowledge is gained by validating closely similar relatives of isofunctional genes, and validating experiments for genes with no specific predicted functions are unlikely to succeed. Furthermore, the landscape of what is already known is uneven, with many validated examples of some functions and few or no examples of others.

COMBREX wishes to develop a new, integrative model of research in which experiments are prioritized to close the largest gaps in our overall predictive understanding of gene function. Such a model favors the validation of genes that provide relatively large increases in knowledge, for example because their validated function results in a large number of new predictions for other genes. At an early stage COMBREX will introduce lists of "high priority" genes, which may be identified as being of significant predictive or biomedical value, and to which COMBREX members may nominate candidates. As a longer-term goal, COMBREX is working towards the use of machine learning techniques such as active learning to optimize the selection of such genes.

=== New technologies ===

Finally, COMBREX encourages the development of new technologies and cost-effective assays for gene function determination. The experimental validation effort described above amounts to a massively parallel application of low-throughput experiments via many small-scale grants. High-throughput assays that can analyze many gene products in parallel may result in the determination of function for many genes simultaneously, and may help make large strides in our overall understanding of gene function.

'''David "Dave" John Shaw''' (20 July 1954 &amp;ndash; 8 January 2005) was an [[Australia]]n [[Scuba diving|scuba diver]], [[technical diving|technical diver]], and [[airline pilot]] for [[Cathay Pacific]], flying the [[Lockheed_L-1011_TriStar|Lockheed L-1011 Tristar]], then the 747-400, and then the [[A330-300]], [[A340-300]], and [[A340-600]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Deep Cave|url= http://www.deepcave.com/pages/3/index.htm |title=Deep Cave Diving with Dave Shaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; He flew for Cathay Pacific from 1989 until his death in 2005. Before flying for Cathay Pacific he flew for Missionary Aviation Fellowship in Papua New Guinea and Tanzania. He also flew [[agricultural aircraft]] in [[South Australia]] and [[New South Wales]].

== Dive equipment ==
Shaw's first [[rebreather]] was an Inspiration [[Rebreather#CCR|closed circuit rebreather]],&lt;!-- need to write a stub for Inspiration CCR; direct to section of Rebreather for now --&gt; which he eventually dived to depths beyond the unit's supposed capability. That prompted him to purchase a Mk15.5, which he modified by removing the analogue electronics and replacing them with the Juergensen Marine Hammerhead digital electronics, in a specially modified POD designed to handle extreme pressures. The Mk15.5 was his rebreather of choice for dives deeper than {{convert|150|m|ft|-2}}. Shaw also owned a [[Cis-Lunar]] Mk5P that he used on extended dives in caves shallower than 150&amp;nbsp;m. He believed the Cis-Lunar had greater redundancy capabilities for such dives but could not cope with extreme depths.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

== Diving records ==
On 28 October 2004, Shaw broke the following records at [[Boesmansgat|Bushman's Hole]], [[South Africa]]:
* Depth on a rebreather
* Depth in a cave on a rebreather
* Depth at altitude on a rebreather
* Depth running a line
He used a Mk15.5 with [[Juergensen Marine]] Hammerhead electronics and the following [[Gas blending|gas mixtures]]: [[Trimix (breathing gas)|trimix]] 4/80, 10/70, 15/55, 17/40, 26/25, air, [[Nitrox|nitrox50]], 100% [[oxygen]]. The cave elevation was {{convert|1550|m|ft}} and the dive duration was 9&amp;nbsp;hours 40&amp;nbsp;minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| website=ScubaRecords.com| url=http://www.scubarecords.com/ |title=Scuba Diving World Records - Deepest Longest - Dave Shaw - Nuno Gomes - Verna Van Schaik - Pascal Bernabé - Mark Elyatt - Johan Beukes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On this record-breaking dive, Shaw discovered the body of [[Deon Dreyer]], a South African diver who had died in Bushman's Hole ten years previously. The body was at a depth of {{convert|270|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name=OM&gt;{{cite news|work=Outside Magazine|title=Raising the Dead|author=Zimmermann, Tim|date=August 1, 2005|url=http://www.outsideonline.com/adventure-travel/africa/south-africa/Raising-the-Dead.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deepcave.com/pages/3/index.htm |author=Shaw, David |title=Deepcave.com |accessdate=2008-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Last dive ==
Shaw died on 8 January 2005 while seeking to recover the body of [[Deon Dreyer]].&lt;ref name=OM/&gt;&lt;ref name=DC/&gt;

Shaw recorded his dive with an underwater [[Video camera|camera]], which allowed researchers to determine that he suffered from respiratory issues due to the high pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mitchell SJ, Cronjé FJ, Meintjes WA, Britz HC |title=Fatal respiratory failure during a "technical" rebreather dive at extreme pressure |journal=Aviat Space Environ Med |volume=78 |issue=2 |pages=81–6 |date=February 2007 |pmid=17310877 |doi= |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/asma/asem/2007/00000078/00000002/art00001 |accessdate=2008-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=David Shaw |title=The Last Dive of David Shaw |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF4iFJ-G74o |accessdate=2011-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shaw ran into difficulties when he cut loose Dreyer's harness and the body unexpectedly began to float. Shaw had been advised by various experts that the body would remain negatively buoyant because the visible parts were reduced to the skeleton. However, within his [[wetsuit]], Dreyer's corpse had turned into a soap-like substance called [[adipocere]], which floats. Shaw had been working with both hands, and so had been resting his can light on the cave floor. The powerful underwater lights that cave divers use are connected by wires to heavy battery canisters, normally worn on the cave diver's waist, or sometimes attached to their tanks. Normally he would have wrapped the wire behind his neck, but he was unable to do so; the lines from the body bag appear to have become entangled with the light head, and the physical effort of trying to free himself led to his death. Three days later, both of the bodies floated up to near the surface as the dive team was retrieving their equipment.

The dive on which Shaw died was the 333rd dive of his career.  At the time of his world record setting dive, he had been diving for just over five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Diving into Darkness: A True Story of Death and Survival |first=Phillip |last=Finch |isbn=0-312-38394-0 |lccn=2008024271 |location=[[New York City|New York]] |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |date=2008 |page=295 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RTgh4Hn3TNgC&amp;pg=PA295}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/515/good-guys?act=3|work=This American Life|title=Episode 515: Good Guys, Act 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.npr.org/2014/10/31/360358240/where-no-one-should-go|work=Snap Judgment|title=Where No One Should Go|date=October 31, 2014|publisher=NPR.org|author=Washington, Glynn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Shaw was a devout [[Christian]].  He and his wife, Ann, lived in [[Hong Kong]], where they were members of a small Christian congregation.&lt;ref&gt;''Diving into Darkness'', pp. 2, 25.&lt;/ref&gt;  They have two children, Steven Shaw and Lisa Shaw (now Lisa Moyers).&lt;ref&gt;''Diving into Darkness'', pp. 29-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Death and the Maiden''''' (''Der Tod und das Mädchen'' in German) was a common [[motif (narrative)|motif]] in [[Renaissance art]], especially painting and prints in Germany. The usual form shows just two figures, with a young woman being seized by [[Death (personification)|a personification of Death]], often shown as a skeleton. Variants may include other figures.  It developed from the [[Danse Macabre]] with an added [[eroticism|erotic]] subtext. The German artist [[Hans Baldung]] depicted it several times.&lt;ref&gt;Le Mort dans l'Art&lt;/ref&gt; 

The motif was revived during the [[Romanticism|romantic era in the arts]], a notable example being [[Franz Schubert]]'s [[lied|song]] "[[Der Tod und das Mädchen]]", setting a poem by the German poet [[Matthias Claudius]].  Part of the piano part was re-used in Schubert's famous [[String Quartet No. 14 (Schubert)|String Quartet No. 14]], which is therefore also known by this title, in either English or German.&lt;ref&gt;Le Mort dans l'Art&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''discovery system''' may be an [[artificial intelligence]] system (in the context of computer science, logic, and mathematics) or a [[bibliographic database|bibliographical search system]] (in the context of library and information science).

== [[Artificial intelligence]] ==
A '''discovery system''' is an [[artificial intelligence]] system that attempts to  discover new scientific concepts or laws.

Notable discovery systems have included

*Autoclass
*[[Automated Mathematician]]
*[[DALTON]]
*[[Eurisko]]
*[[Glauber]]
*Machine for Questions and Answers
*Stahl

== [[Bibliographic database|Bibliographical search system]] ==
A '''discovery system''' is a [[bibliographic database|bibliographic search system]] based on [[Search engine (computing)|search engine]] technology. It is part of the concept of [[Library 2.0]] and is intended to supplement or even replace the existing [[Online public access catalog|OPAC]] [[Library catalog|catalog]]s.

=== Typical features of a discovery system ===
* Large search space: A search can search the data from different data sources (the discovery system has a comprehensive central subject index). For example, you can search a journal article or a textbook directly in the discovery system and you do not have to change from a subject database to the library catalog.
* Intuitive usability, like a search engine. The search is basically only a simple form, an advanced search function is not always provided.
* Ranking of the results according to relevance: The "best" hit is displayed first, not necessarily the newest one. A good ranking is important because many hits are often found due to the large search space.
* Search refinement with drill-down menus (facets): For example, a search can be restricted to all matches available online.
* Correction of input errors via a "Did you mean ...?" function.
* [[Autocomplete]]: After input to the search field, a [[drop-down list]] of suggestions appears.
* Exploratory search: One finds results of interest that were not specifically requested. For example, links to similar hits, entries in [[bibliographic database|subject databases]], or [[Wikipedia]] articles are displayed (integration of other web technologies).

=== Examples of Discovery System Products ===
Commercial products:
* [[Summon]] (Serial Solutions)
* Primo Central ([[Ex Libris Group|ExLibris]])

Open Source products:
* VuFind (Villanova University Library)
* Lukida ([[:de:Gemeinsamer Bibliotheksverbund|GBV Common Library Network]])

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28243">'''Fatality statistics in the Western Australian mining industry''' captures the number of people killed in the industry in the [[Australia]]n state of [[Western Australia]]. During the period 2000-2012 (inclusive), a total of 52 fatalities occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Fatal accidents in the Western Australian mining industry 2000-2012 |publisher = Government of Western Australia, Department of Mines and Petroleum|year = 2014|isbn = 978 1 922149 20 6|location = Western Australia|pages = 7|format = PDF|url = http://www.dmp.wa.gov.au/documents/Reports/RP_FatalAccidentsMINING_2000-12.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia commissioned a [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomic]] study to analyse the 306 mining fatalities which occurred between 1970 and 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmewa.com/Resources/Download?id=13 Fatalities in the West Australian Mining Industry 1970 – 2006] The Chamber of Minerals and Energy of WA Inc. website, page: 20, prepared by: Roger Kahler, published: 2006, accessed: 22 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Department of Mines and Petroleum]], later renamed the Department of Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety, the governing authority for the industry in the state, has published statistics for fatalities in mining dating back to 1943 and intends to publish statistics dating back to 1886, though early records are not expected to be exhaustive.&lt;ref name="Data" &gt;[http://www.dmp.wa.gov.au/documents/Magazine/MSH_MineSafe_Dec09v18no3_IndPerform.pdf Historical extension to fatalities database] [[Department of Mines and Petroleum|DMP]] website, published: 2009, accessed: 19 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Categorisation ==
The department lists the fatality statistics categorised by commodity, date, fiscal year, occupation, causes, report status and type of mining (underground or surface).&lt;ref name="Data" /&gt; Records up until 1967 are not categorised by commodity and instead appear as "not categorised" in the listing. Categorisation began in 1967 and almost all fatalities are categorised after 1968.&lt;ref name="Data" /&gt;

=== Omissions ===
The statistics do not include the [[2000 Australia Beechcraft King Air crash]], when a flight to the [[Gwalia Gold Mine]], with seven [[Sons of Gwalia]] employees onboard failed to land, instead continuing on to [[Burketown, Queensland|Burketown]], where it eventually crashed, having run out of fuel. The pilot and the planes seven passengers were all killed.&lt;ref name="Crash"&gt;[http://www.asx.com.au/asx/statistics/displayAnnouncement.do?display=text&amp;issuerId=1167&amp;announcementId=202941 Media Release re: Aircraft Accident] SGW ASX announcement, published: 5 September 2000, accessed: 8 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Sexual orientation}}
'''Heterosexuality''' is [[Romance (love)|romantic]] attraction, [[sexual attraction]] or [[Human sexual activity|sexual behavior]] between persons of the opposite [[sex]] or [[gender]].&lt;!-- NOTE: "Sex" and "gender" are not always the same thing; for example, "sex" may refer to "biological sex" (being male or female), while "gender" may refer to a person's gender identity of being a man or a woman; therefore, like the Sexual orientation, Homosexuality and Bisexuality articles, we have included both in the lead. --&gt; As a [[sexual orientation]], heterosexuality is "an enduring pattern of emotional, romantic, and/or sexual attractions" to persons of the opposite sex; it "also refers to a person's sense of identity based on those attractions, related behaviors, and membership in a community of others who share those attractions."&lt;ref name="apahelp"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual orientation, homosexuality and bisexuality|publisher=[[American Psychological Association]]|accessdate=August 10, 2013|url=http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/sexual-orientation.aspx|archivedate=August 8, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130808032050/http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/sexual-orientation.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brief"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/courts/supreme/highprofile/documents/Amer_Psychological_Assn_Amicus_Curiae_Brief.pdf |title=APA California Amicus Brief |publisher=Courtinfo.ca.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with [[bisexuality]] and [[homosexuality]], heterosexuality is one of the three main categories of sexual orientation within the [[heterosexual–homosexual continuum]].&lt;ref name="apahelp"/&gt; Someone who is heterosexual is commonly referred to as ''straight.''

The term ''heterosexual'' or ''heterosexuality'' is usually applied to [[human]]s, but heterosexual behavior is observed in all [[mammal]]s and in other animals.

== Language ==
{{see also|Terminology of homosexuality}}

=== Etymology ===
''Hetero-'' comes from the Greek word ''ἕτερος'' [héteros], meaning "other party" or "another",&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;p.345, Klein&lt;/ref&gt; used in science as a [[prefix]] meaning "different";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hetero |title=Hetero &amp;#124; Define Hetero at Dictionary.com |website=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2016-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Latin word for sex (that is, characteristic sex or [[sexual differentiation]]). The term "''heterosexual''" was first published in 1892 in [[Charles Gilbert Chaddock|C.G. Chaddock's]] translation of [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing|Krafft-Ebing's]] "[[Psychopathia Sexualis (book)#Psychopathia Sexualis|Psychopathia Sexualis]]". The noun came into use from the early 1920s, but did not enter common use until the 1960s. The colloquial shortening "hetero" is attested from 1933. The abstract noun "heterosexuality" is first recorded in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;p.22, Mills&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''"heterosexual"'' was first listed in Merriam-Webster's ''New International Dictionary'' as a [[Medical terminology|medical term]] for "morbid sexual passion for one of the opposite sex"; however, in 1934 in their ''Second Edition Unabridged'' it is defined as a "manifestation of sexual passion for one of the opposite sex; normal sexuality".&lt;ref&gt;(p.&amp;nbsp;92, Katz)&lt;/ref&gt;
The adjective ''heterosexual'' is used for [[intimate relationship]]s or [[human sexual behavior|sexual relations]] between male and female.

=== Terminology ===

The current use of the term ''heterosexual'' has its roots in the broader 19th century tradition of personality taxonomy. It continues to influence the development of the modern concept of sexual orientation, and can be used to describe individuals' sexual orientation, sexual history, or self-identification. Some reject the term ''heterosexual'', as they feel that the word only refers to one's sexual behavior and does not refer to non-sexual romantic feelings. The term ''heterosexual'' is suggested to have come into use as a [[neologism]] after, and opposite to, the word ''homosexual'' by [[Karl Maria Kertbeny]] in 1868. In [[LGBT]] slang, the term ''[[Breeder (slang)|breeder]]'' has been used as a denigrating phrase to deride heterosexuals. Hyponyms of heterosexual include ''heteroflexible''.&lt;ref&gt;Porn.com: Making Sense of Online Pornography - Page 229, Feona Attwood - 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patience: A Gay Man's Virtue - Page 80, La Lumiere - 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The word can be informally&lt;ref&gt;"hetero." Dictionary.com Unabridged. Random House, Inc. 12 May. 2012. [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hetero Dictionary.com].&lt;/ref&gt; shortened to "hetero".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/hetero |title=hetero |publisher=Merriam-Webster |date= |accessdate=2013-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''straight'' originated as a mid-20th century [[gay slang]] term for heterosexuals, ultimately coming from the phrase "to go straight" (as in "straight and narrow"), or stop engaging in homosexual sex. One of the first uses of the word in this way was in 1941 by author G. W. Henry.&lt;ref name=Henry&gt;Henry, G. W. (1941). ''Sex Variants: A Study of Homosexual Patterns''. New York: Paul B. Hoeber&lt;/ref&gt; Henry's book concerned conversations with homosexual males and used this term in connection with people who are identified as [[ex-gay]]s. It is now simply a colloquial term for "heterosexual", having changed in primary meaning over time. Some object to usage of the term ''straight'' because it implies that non-heteros are crooked.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia Of School Psychology - Page 298, T. Steuart Watson, Christopher H. Skinner - 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symbolism ==
[[File:HeteroSym-pinkblue.svg|140px|thumb|upright|One version of a heterosexuality symbol]]

Heterosexual symbolism dates back to the earliest artifacts of humanity, with [[gender symbols]], ritual fertility carvings, and primitive art. This was later expressed in the symbolism of [[fertility rites]] and [[Polytheism#Historical polytheism|polytheistic worship]], which often included images of human [[Sex organ|reproductive organs]], such as [[lingam]] in [[Hinduism]]. Modern symbols of heterosexuality in societies derived from European traditions still reference symbols used in these ancient beliefs. One such image is a combination of the symbol for [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], the Roman god of war, as the definitive [[male]] symbol of masculinity, and [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], the Roman goddess of love and beauty, as the definitive [[female]] symbol of femininity. The [[unicode]] character for this combined symbol is ⚤ (U+26A4).

The [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition has several scriptures related to heterosexuality. The [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] states that God created man because "it is not good that the man should be alone;  I will make him an help meet for him." ({{lds|Gen|gen|2|18}}) Genesis then contains a commandment stating "Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh" ({{lds|Gen|gen|2|24}}) In [[1 Corinthians]], Christians are advised:

{{quote|Now for the matters you wrote about: It is good for a man not to marry. But since there is so much immorality, each man should have his own wife, and each woman her own husband. The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband. The wife's body does not belong to her alone but also to her husband. In the same way, the husband's body does not belong to him alone but also to his wife. Do not deprive each other except by mutual consent and for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. I say this as a concession, not as a command. (NIV)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%207;&amp;version=NIV |title=1 Corinthians 7; NIV - Concerning Married Life - Now for the |publisher=Bible Gateway |date= |accessdate=2013-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

For the most part, religious traditions in the world reserve [[marriage]] to heterosexual unions, but there are exceptions including certain [[Buddhist]] and [[Hindu]] traditions, [[Unitarian Universalist]], [[Metropolitan Community Church]] and some [[homosexuality and Anglicanism#Anglican Church of Canada|Anglican]] dioceses and some [[Quaker]], [[United Church of Canada]] and [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] and [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative Jewish]] congregations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Religions and Same Sex Marriage|url=http://marriagelaw.cua.edu/publications/wrr.pdf|website=[[Columbus School of Law]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070620162822/http://marriagelaw.cua.edu/publications/wrr.pdf |archive-date=20 June 2007|accessdate=1 April 2018|date=20 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=united&gt;[http://www.united-church.ca/exploring/marriage/affirmingcongregations Affirming Congregations and Ministries of the United Church of Canada] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224005434/http://www.united-church.ca/exploring/marriage/affirmingcongregations |date=February 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost all religions believe that lawful sex between a man and a woman is allowed, but there are a few that believe that it is a sin, such as The [[Shakers]], The [[Harmony Society]], and The [[Ephrata Cloister]]. These religions tend to view all sexual relations as [[sin]]ful, and promote [[celibacy]]. Other religions view heterosexual relationships as being inferior to celibacy. Some religions require [[celibacy]] for certain roles, such as [[Catholic priests]]; however, the [[Catholic Church]] also views heterosexual marriage as sacred and necessary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p2s2c3a7.htm#I] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201031249/http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p2s2c3a7.htm#I |date=February 1, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics ==
The [[demographics of sexual orientation]] are difficult to establish due to a lack of reliable data. However, the [[history of human sexuality]] shows that attitudes and behavior have varied across societies. According to major studies, 89% to 98% of people have had only heterosexual contact within their lifetime;&lt;ref name = Laumann1994&gt;Laumann, E. O., Gagnon, J. H., Michael, R. T., &amp; Michaels, S. (1994). ''The social organization of sexuality: Sexual practices in the United States.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press.{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Wellings1994&gt;Wellings, K., Field, J., Johnson, A., &amp; Wadsworth, J. (1994). ''Sexual behavior in Britain: The national survey of sexual attitudes and lifestyles.'' London, UK: Penguin Books.{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Bogaert2004&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Bogaert AF |title=The prevalence of male homosexuality: the effect of fraternal birth order and variations in family size |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=230 |issue=1 |pages=33–7 |date=September 2004 |pmid=15275997 |doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2004.04.035|ref=harv}} Bogaert argues that: "The prevalence of male homosexuality is debated. One widely reported early estimate was 10% (e.g., Marmor, 1980; Voeller, 1990). Some recent data provided support for this estimate (Bagley and Tremblay, 1998), but most recent large national samples suggest that the prevalence of male homosexuality in modern western societies, including the United States, is lower than this early estimate (e.g., 1–2% in Billy et al., 1993; 2–3% in Laumann et al., 1994; 6% in Sell et al., 1995; 1–3% in Wellings et al., 1994). It is of note, however, that homosexuality is defined in different ways in these studies. For example, some use same-sex behavior and not same-sex attraction as the operational definition of homosexuality (e.g., Billy et al., 1993); many sex researchers (e.g., Bailey et al., 2000; Bogaert, 2003; Money, 1988; Zucker and Bradley, 1995) now emphasize attraction over overt behavior in conceptualizing sexual orientation." (p. 33) Also: "...the prevalence of male homosexuality (in particular, same-sex attraction) varies over time and across societies (and hence is a "moving target") in part because of two effects: (1) variations in fertility rate or family size; and (2) the fraternal birth order effect. Thus, even if accurately measured in one country at one time, the rate of male homosexuality is subject to change and is not generalizable over time or across societies."

===Polling===
According to a 2008 poll, 85% of [[British people|Britons]] have only opposite-sex sexual contact while only 94% of Britons identify themselves as heterosexual.&lt;ref name=guardianpoll&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/oct/26/relationships |title=Sex uncovered poll: Homosexuality |publisher=Guardian |date= 26 October 2008|accessdate=24 August 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a survey by the UK [[Office for National Statistics]] (ONS) in 2010 found that 95% of Britons identified as heterosexual, 1.5% of Britons identified themselves as homosexual or bisexual, and the last 3.5% gave more vague answers such as "don't know", "other", or did not respond to the question.&lt;ref name="more-or-less-2010-10-01"&gt;{{cite web|last=Harford|first=Tim|title=More or Less examines Office for National Statistics figures on gay, lesbian and bisexual people|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00tznbk|publisher=BBC|date=1 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Measuring Sexual Identity : Evaluation Report, 2010|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/ethnicity/measuring-sexual-identity---evaluation-report/2010/index.html|publisher=[[Office for National Statistics]]|date=23 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The neurobiology of the masculinization of the brain is fairly well understood. [[Estradiol]] and [[testosterone]], which is catalyzed by the enzyme [[5α-reductase]] into [[dihydrotestosterone]], act upon [[androgen receptor]]s in the brain to masculinize it. If there are few androgen receptors (people with [[androgen insensitivity syndrome]]) or too much androgen (females with [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]]), there can be physical and psychological effects.&lt;ref&gt;Vilain, E. (2000). Genetics of Sexual Development. Annual Review of Sex Research, 11:1–25&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that both male and female heterosexuality are results of variation in this process.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, G. and Rahman, Q., (2005). Born Gay. Chapter 5. London: Peter Owen Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; In these studies heterosexuality in females is linked to a lower amount of masculinization than is found in lesbian females, though when dealing with male heterosexuality there are results supporting both higher and lower degrees of masculinization than homosexual males.

Most [[sexual reproduction]] in the [[animalia|animal world]] is facilitated through opposite-sex sexual activity, although there are also animals that [[Asexual reproduction|reproduce asexually]], including [[protozoa]] and lower [[invertebrates]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Columbia Encyclopedia'' (Colum. Univ. Press, 5th ed. &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;casebound?&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; 1993 ({{ISBN|0-395-62438-X}})), entry ''Reproduction''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reproductive sex does not necessarily require a heterosexual orientation, since orientation refers to a long-term enduring pattern of sexual and emotional attraction leading often to long-term social bonding, while reproductive sex requires only the basic act of [[sexual intercourse|intercourse]] only to [[Fertilisation|fertile]] the [[ovum]] by [[sperm]], often done one time only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/0116.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 24, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222043503/http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/0116.html |archivedate=December 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanpregnancy.org/preventingpregnancy/pregnancyfaqmyths.html |title=Can Pregnancy Occur &amp;#124; Pregnancy Myths on How Pregnancy Occurs |website=Americanpregnancy.org |date= |accessdate=2016-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawyers Guide to Forensic Medicine SBN 978-1-85941-159-9 By Bernard Knight - Page 188 "Pregnancy is well known to occur from such external ejaculation ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Behavioral studies ====
{{Main|Kinsey Reports}}
[[File:Trash the dress - Wetlook in wedding clothes - Heterosexual couple in sea.jpg|250px|thumb|Intimate heterosexual couple]]

At the beginning of the 20th century, early theoretical discussions in the field of [[psychoanalysis]] posited original [[bisexuality]] in human psychological development. Quantitative studies by [[Alfred Kinsey]] in the 1940s and [[Fritz Klein (sex researcher)|Dr. Fritz Klein]]'s sexual orientation grid in the 1980s find distributions similar to those postulated by their predecessors.

According to ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Male'' by Alfred Kinsey and several other modern studies, the majority of humans have had both heterosexual and homosexual experiences or sensations and are bisexual. Kinsey himself, along with current sex therapists, focused on the historicity and fluidity of sexual orientation. Kinsey's studies consistently found sexual orientation to be something that evolves in many directions over a person's lifetime; rarely, but not necessarily, including forming attractions to a new sex. Rarely do individuals radically reorient their sexualities rapidly—and still less do they do so volitionally—but often sexualities expand, shift, and absorb new elements over decades. For example, socially normative "age-appropriate" sexuality requires a shifting object of attraction (especially in the passage through adolescence). Contemporary [[queer theory]], incorporating many ideas from [[social constructionism]], tends to look at sexuality as something that has meaning only within a given historical framework. Sexuality, then, is seen as a participation in a larger social discourse and, though in some sense fluid, not as something strictly determinable by the individual.

Other studies have disputed Kinsey's methodology. "His figures were undermined when it was revealed that he had disproportionately interviewed homosexuals and prisoners (many sex offenders)."&lt;ref&gt;Tom Bethell (April 2005). "Kinsey as Pervert".&lt;/cite&gt; ''American Spectator'', '''38''', 42–44. {{ISSN|0148-8414}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julia A. Ericksen (May 1998). "With enough cases, why do you need statistics? Revisiting Kinsey's methodology".&lt;/cite&gt; ''The Journal of Sex Research'' '''35''' (2): 132-40, {{ISSN|0022-4499}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexologists have attributed discrepancies in some findings to negative societal attitudes towards a particular sexual orientation. For example, people may state different sexual orientations depending on whether their immediate social environment is public or private. Reluctance to disclose one's actual sexual orientation is often referred to as "being in the closet." Individuals capable of enjoyable sexual relations with both sexes or one sex may feel inclined to restrict themselves to heterosexual or homosexual relations in societies that stigmatize same-sex or opposite-sex relations.

=== Nature and nurture ===

The considerable "[[nature and nurture]]" debate exists over whether predominantly biological or psychological factors produce sexual orientation in humans, or whether both significantly factor into sexual orientation. Candidate factors include [[Biology and sexual orientation#Empirical studies|genes]], the exposure of fetuses to certain [[Biology and sexual orientation#Early fixation hypothesis|hormones]] (or lack thereof) and [[Environment and sexual orientation|environmental factors]].

=== Critique of studies ===

The studies performed in order to find the origin of sexual orientation have been criticized for being too limited in scope, mostly for focusing only on heterosexuality and homosexuality as two diametrically opposite poles with no orientation in between. It is also asserted that scientific studies focus too much on the search for a biological explanation for sexual orientation, and not enough on the combined effects of both biology and psychology.&lt;ref name=CFRG/&gt;

In a brief by the [[Council for Responsible Genetics]],&lt;ref name=CFRG/&gt; it was stated that sexual orientation is not fixed either way, and on the discourse over sexual orientation: "Noticeably missing from this debate is the notion, championed by Kinsey, that human sexual expression is as variable among people as many other [[complex traits]]. Yet just like intelligence, sexuality is a complex human feature that modern science is attempting to explain with genetics. Research on brain size, hormone levels, finger length, and other biological traits have yet to yield evidence for this, however. It is important to note that traits such as these result from a combination of gene expression and developmental and other environmental factors. Well-known biologist and social theorist, Anne Fausto-Sterling advocates in her book Sexing the Body, for what scientists term a “systems approach” to be applied to our understanding of sexual preference. Rather than determining that this results from purely biological processes, a trait evolves from developmental processes that include both biological and social elements."&lt;ref name=CFRG&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.councilforresponsiblegenetics.org/ViewPage.aspx?pageId=66 | title=Brief on Sexual Orientation and Genetic Determinism | publisher=[[Council for Responsible Genetics]] website | date=May 2006 | accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA), there are numerous theories about the origins of a person's sexual orientation, but some believe that "sexual orientation is most likely the result of a complex interaction of environmental, cognitive and biological factors," and that genetic factors play a "significant role" in determining a person's sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jmu.edu/safezone/wm_library/Sexual%20Orientation%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf | title=Fact and Information Sheet About: Sexual Orientation: Taken from "Answers to Your Questions About Sexual Orientation and Homosexuality" by the American Psychological Association. | publisher=[[James Madison University]] | work=Office of Public Affairs, [[American Psychological Association]] | accessdate=24 January 2016 | page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual fluidity===
{{Main|Sexual orientation identity|Sexual fluidity}}
Often, sexual orientation and [[sexual orientation identity]] are not distinguished, which can impact accurately assessing sexual identity and whether or not sexual orientation is able to change; sexual orientation identity can change throughout an individual's life, and may or may not align with biological sex, sexual behavior or actual sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Sinclair"&gt;Sinclair, Karen, About Whoever: The Social Imprint on Identity and Orientation, NY, 2013 {{ISBN|9780981450513}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosario et al."&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosario | first1 = M. | last2 = Schrimshaw | first2 = E. | last3 = Hunter | first3 = J. |last4 = Braun | first4 = L. | year = 2006 | title = Sexual identity development among lesbian, gay, and bisexual youths: Consistency and change over time | url = | journal = Journal of Sex Research | volume = 43 | issue = 1| pages = 46–58 | doi=10.1080/00224490609552298| pmc = 3215279 | pmid=16817067}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Concordance/discordance in SO"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Michael W.|last=Ross|author2=Essien, E.

A 2012 study found that 2% of a sample of 2,560 adult participants reported a change of sexual orientation identity after a 10-year period. For men, a change occurred in 0.78% of those who had identified as heterosexual, 9.52% of homosexuals, and 47% of bisexuals. For women, a change occurred in 1.36% of heterosexuals, 63.6% of lesbians, and 64.7% of bisexuals. The researchers suggested that heterosexuality may be a more stable identity because of its normative status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://midus.wisc.edu/findings/pdfs/1153.pdf | author1 = Mock, S.

A 2-year study by [[Lisa M. Diamond]] on a sample of 80 non-heterosexual female adolescents (age 16-23) reported that half of the participants had changed sexual-minority identities more than once, one third of them during the 2-year follow-up. Diamond concluded that "although sexual attractions appear fairly stable, sexual identities and behaviors are more fluid."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Diamond, L.

In a 2004 study, the female subjects (both gay and straight women) became strongly sexually aroused when they viewed heterosexual as well as lesbian erotic films. Among the male subjects, however, the straight men were more turned on by erotic films with women, the gay ones more by those with men. The study's senior researcher said that women's sexual desire is less rigidly directed toward a particular sex, as compared with men's, and it is more changeable over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the study did note that on average all men, regardless of sexual orientation, showed significantly more genital arousal to their non-preferred sex compared to neutral stimuli. Gay men showed some level of genital arousal to female stimuli and straight men showed some level of genital arousal to male stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~sexlab/files/pubs/Riegeretal2005.pdf |title=Sexual Arousal Patterns of

[[Heteroflexibility]] is a form of a sexual orientation or [[situational sexual behavior]] characterized by minimal homosexual activity in an otherwise primarily heterosexual orientation that is considered to distinguish it from bisexuality. It has been characterized as "mostly straight".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0012-1649.44.1.15 |last1=Thompson |first1=E.M. |last2=Morgan |first2=E.M. |year=2008 |title="Mostly straight" young women: Variations in sexual behavior and identity development |journal=Developmental Psychology |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=15–21 |pmid=18194001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual orientation change efforts===
{{Main|Sexual orientation change efforts}}
Sexual orientation change efforts are methods that aim to change sexual orientation, used to try to convert homosexual and bisexual people to heterosexuality. Scientists and mental health professionals generally do not believe that sexual orientation is a choice.&lt;ref name="Frankowski" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kersey-Matusiak"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gloria Kersey-Matusiak|title=Delivering Culturally Competent Nursing Care|publisher=[[Springer Publishing Company]]|isbn=0826193811|year=2012|page=169|accessdate=January 10, 2016|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X8O_wGedAYoC&amp;pg=PA169|quote=Most health and mental health organizations do not view sexual orientation as a 'choice.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are no studies of adequate scientific rigor that conclude that sexual orientation change efforts work to change a person's sexual orientation. Those efforts have been controversial due to tensions between the values held by some faith-based organizations, on the one hand, and those held by [[LGBT]] rights organizations and professional and scientific organizations and other faith-based organizations, on the other.&lt;ref name="apa2009"&gt;American Psychological Association: [http://www.apa.org/about/governance/council/policy/sexual-orientation.aspx Resolution on Appropriate Affirmative Responses to Sexual Orientation Distress and Change Efforts]&lt;/ref&gt; The longstanding consensus of the behavioral and social sciences and the health and mental health professions is that homosexuality ''per se'' is a normal and positive variation of human sexual orientation, and therefore not a mental disorder.&lt;ref name="apa2009"/&gt;

No major mental health professional organization has sanctioned efforts to change sexual orientation and virtually all of them have adopted policy statements cautioning the profession and the public about treatments that purport to change sexual orientation.

Since the 1960s and 1970s, a large body of research has provided evidence and analysis of the extent to which heterosexuality and homosexuality are socially organized and historically changing.&lt;ref&gt;Social-Historical Construction of Sexuality: Bibliography with Particular Emphasis on Heterosexuality and Homosexuality [http://makehimdesireyou.co/social-historical-construction-sexuality-bibliography/]&lt;/ref&gt; This work challenges the assumption that heterosexuality, homosexuality, and sexualities of all varieties, can be understood as primarily biological and psychological phenomena.

A heterosexual couple, a man and woman in an [[intimate relationship]], form the core of a [[nuclear family]].&lt;ref&gt;"... the core of a family is a heterosexual couple who have children that they raise to adulthood - the so-called nuclear family." [https://books.google.com/books?id=DcLZvQIzTakC&amp;pg=PA429&amp;lpg=PA429#v=onepage&amp;q=heterosexual%20couple%20core%20of%20a%20nuclear%20family. Encyclopedia of family health]&lt;/ref&gt;
Many societies throughout history have insisted that a [[marriage]] take place before the couple settle down, but enforcement of this rule or compliance with it has varied considerably. In some jurisdictions, when an unmarried man and woman [[cohabitation|live together]] long enough, they are deemed to have established a [[common-law marriage]].

=== Social history and terminology ===

There was no real need to coin a term such as "heterosexual" until there was something else to contrast and compare it with.  In “The Invention of Heterosexuality,” Jonathon Ned Katz dates the definition of heterosexuality, as it is used today, to the late 19th century.&lt;ref name="Katz"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Katz|first1=Jonathon Ned|title=The Invention of Heterosexuality|journal=Socialist Review|date=January–March 1990|issue=20|pages=7–34|url=https://english101sp2015.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/jonathan-katz_the-invention-of-heterosexuality.pdf|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Victorian era]], sex was seen as a means to achieve reproduction, relations between the sexes were not believed to be overtly sexual. The body was thought of as a tool for procreation, “human energy, though of as a closed and severely limited system, was to be used in producing children and in work, not wasted in libidinous pleasures.”&lt;ref name="Katz"/&gt; Modern ideas of [[sexuality]] and [[eroticism]] began to develop in America and Germany in the later 19th century. The changing economy and the “transformation of the family from producer to consumer”&lt;ref name="Katz"/&gt; resulted in shifting values. The Victorian work ethic had changed, pleasure became more highly valued and this allowed ideas of human sexuality to change. [[Consumer culture]] had created a market for the erotic, pleasure became [[commoditized]]. At the same time medical doctors began to acquire more power and influence. They developed the medical model of Normal Love in which healthy men and women enjoyed sex as part of a “new ideal of male-female relationships that included.. an essential, necessary, normal eroticism.” &lt;ref name="Katz"/&gt; This ‘Normal Sexual’ ideal also had a counterpart, the Victorian Sex Pervert, anyone who failed to meet the [[Norm (social)|norm]]. The basic oppositeness of the sexes was the basis for normal, healthy sexual attraction. “The attention paid the sexual abnormal created a need to name the sexual normal, the better to distinguish the average him and her from the deviant it.” &lt;ref name="Katz"/&gt; The creation term ‘heterosexual’ consolidated the social existence of the pre-existing heterosexual experience and created a sense of ensured and validated normalcy within it.

[[Heteronormativity]] denotes or relates to a world view that promotes heterosexuality as the normal or preferred sexual orientation for people to have. It can assign strict gender roles to males and females. The term was popularized by [[Michael Warner]] in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Warner, Michael (1991), "Introduction: Fear of a Queer Planet". ''Social Text''; 9 (4 [29]): 3–17&lt;/ref&gt; Many gender and sexuality scholars argue that [[compulsory heterosexuality]], a continual and repeating reassertion of heterosexual norms, is facet of heterosexism.&lt;ref&gt;Rich, Adrienne (1980), "Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence". "Signs"; Pages 631-660.&lt;/ref&gt; Compulsory heterosexuality is the idea that female heterosexuality is both assumed and enforced by a patriarchal society. Heterosexuality is then viewed as the natural inclination or obligation by both sexes. Consequently, anyone who differs from the normalcy of heterosexuality is deemed deviant or abhorrent.&lt;ref name=":0'"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rich|first=Adrienne|title=Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence|year=1980|publisher=Onlywomen Press Ltd|isbn=0-906500-07-9|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Heterosexism]] is a form of [[bias]] or [[discrimination]] in favor of opposite-sex sexuality and relationships. It may include an assumption that everyone is heterosexual and may involve a varied level of discrimination against gays, lesbians, bisexuals, [[heteroflexible]]s, or transgender individuals.

[[Straight pride]] is a slogan that arose in the late 1980s and early 1990s and has been used primarily by [[Social conservatism|social conservative]] groups as a political stance and strategy.&lt;ref name="Massachusetts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.massresistance.org/docs/downloads/romney/CommReport_Making_Colleges_Safe_7-93.pdf|title=Making colleges and universities safe for gay and lesbian students: Report and recommendations of the Governor's Commission on Gay and Lesbian Youth|publisher=Massachusetts.

'''Joseph Patrick Addabbo''' (March 17, 1925 – April 10, 1986) was a [[New York City]] politician who served as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] in the [[United States House of Representatives]] from 1961 until his death from a seizure in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1986. As the chairman of the [[United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense]] in the 1980s, he was a noted critic of President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s massive defense spending increases.

Addabbo was born in [[Queens, New York]] and lived in the borough his entire life. He was a 1946 graduate of St. John's Law School and practiced law in [[Ozone Park, New York]] before his election to Congress in 1960. Addabbo was the Democratic nominee to replace Queens Rep. [[Albert H. Bosch]], a Republican who left Congress to begin a judicial career.

==Defense spending critic==
Addabbo became chairman of the defense spending subcommittee in 1979. In the post, he frequently sparred with President Reagan and was a favorite media source for accounts of the epic military spending battles in the early 1980s. Addabbo created a yearly routine of calling for deep cuts to the administration's budget.  In 1983, he proposed slashing Reagan's defense spending plan by $30 billion. Though Addabbo's efforts were usually unsuccessful, he managed to eliminate funding for [[LGM-118A Peacekeeper|MX]] and [[Pershing II]] missiles in 1982.

==Final campaigns and death==
Although he usually sailed to reelection in his overwhelmingly Democratic and Italian-American Southwestern [[Queens]] district, a reapportionment following the 1980 census spelled trouble for Addabbo in his final two campaigns.  His district absorbed a considerably larger number of African Americans in [[Jamaica, Queens]] than had previously been in the district.  His old district was 35 percent black, while his new district was 65 percent black. Some of his Italian-American base were moved into the district of fellow Democrat [[Charles Schumer]] while others were moved into the district of fellow Italian-American Democrat [[Geraldine Ferraro]], who had won a closer-than-expected election two years earlier.  This left him open to a surprisingly strong primary challenge from black real estate developer Simeon Golar in 1982.  Two years later, Golar ran again with the active backing of then-presidential candidate [[Jesse Jackson]], but Addabbo won again.

Addabbo's health started to fail shortly after his 1984 re-election. In 1985, he spent four months in the Walter Reed Army Medical Center with a cancer-related kidney ailment. After returning to work for two months in early 1986, he fell ill at a luncheon in March and lapsed into a coma on March 12.  He died a month later, aged 61, and was buried in [[Saint John's Cemetery, Queens]].

After Addabbo's death, Queens elected its first African-American congressman after a disputed special election between two black candidates. In 2001, Addabbo's son, [[Joseph Addabbo Jr.|Joseph P. Addabbo Jr.]], was elected as the [[New York City Council]] representative for District 32 in Queens. He was elected to the [[New York State Senate]] in 2008.

Butterfingers, named after Khyrunnisa’s son, Amar, first appeared in 2006 in [[Tinkle]], a popular fortnightly Indian children's magazine, as a regular comic-strip character. The illustrations were by Abhijeet Kini, the Mumbai based illustrator and graphic artist.

The popular Butterfingers series, published by Puffin, began with the novel, ''Howzzat Butterfingers!'' , In 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/books/All-about-Butterfingers/article16191991.ece|title=All about Butterfingers|work=The Hindu|access-date=2017-07-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This humorous cricket-based book was followed in 2012 by ''Goal, Butterfingers!''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/packing-a-punch/article7976594.ece|title=Packing a punch|work=The Hindu|access-date=2017-07-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;'','' a rollicking football-based adventure novel which also includes a socially relevant environmental theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yentha.com/news/view/4/LITERATURE-Author-Profile-Khyrunnisa-A|title=LITERATURE: Author Profile - Khyrunnisa A - Trivandrum News {{!}} Yentha.com|last=yentha.com|website=www.yentha.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third in the series, ''‘Clean Bowled, Butterfingers!'' was published in 2015 and is another cricket-based novel with a hilariously farcical plot in which Amar and his friends invent a variation of cricket called ‘Crack It’ when the school’s cricket gear gets stolen. This game, played without cricket bats and balls, has its own absurd rules and generates immense fun.

''The Misadventures of Butterfingers'', the fourth book in the series, came out in 2016 and is a collection of short stories. It was followed by another collection of delightful short stories'', Run! It’s Butterfingers Again!''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/go-butter-go/article18387112.ece|title=Go, Butter, go!|work=The Hindu|access-date=2017-07-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/thumbs-up-for-indian-writing/article18476520.ece|title=Thumbs up for Indian writing|work=The Hindu|access-date=2017-07-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2017.

The books have received praise from different quarters. The late [[Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi|Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi]], former Indian cricket captain and legend, wrote of ''Howzzat Butterfingers!'': ‘What great fun! It brings back memories of my prep school days.’ The ace cricketer [[V. V. S. Laxman|V.V.S. Laxman]] described ''Clean Bowled Butterfingers'' as an ‘exuberant mix of school, cricket and fun.’ [[Shashi Tharoor]], writer, MP and diplomat, complimented Khyrunnisa ‘not just for creating Butterfingers, but for enriching Indian writing with world-class children’s literature.’

Lady Wonder is said to have helped the [[Massachusetts]] police to find the body of a missing boy, to have predicted that [[Jack Dempsey]] would defeat [[Jack Sharkey]] in 1927 (including two other documented heavyweight bouts), and to have helped discover oil.&lt;ref name="Gardner"&gt;Gardner, Dick. (1962). ''The Impossible''. 1962. Ballantine Books. p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;
Lady Wonder's trainer, C.D. Fonda, raised the horse on a bottle. The horse was trained to operate a device consisting of levers that activated alphabet cards.&lt;ref name="Nickell 2002"&gt;[[Joe Nickell|Nickell, Joe]]. (2002).

The psychical researcher [[Joseph Banks Rhine|J. B. Rhine]] investigated the horse and concluded that there was evidence for [[extrasensory perception]] between human and horse.&lt;ref name="Gardner"/&gt; However, the magician [[Milbourne Christopher]] investigated the horse and noticed that the phenomenon was the result of [[Sensory cue|cueing]] from her trainer, Fonda. He determined that Lady Wonder only answered questions correctly when her trainer was aware of the answer. According to Christopher "Lady was trained to move her head back and forth above the board bearing the letters. When she was over the right lever, a slight movement of Mrs Fonda's stick cued her to lower her head and touch the proper lever."&lt;ref&gt;[[Milbourne Christopher|Christopher, Milbourne]]. (1971). ''ESP, Seers &amp; Psychics''. Crowell. pp. 39-54. {{ISBN|978-0690268157}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skeptical investigator [[Joe Nickell]] wrote that the Lady was "a well-trained animal, not a telepathic one."&lt;ref name="Nickell 2002"/&gt;

{{For|the use of layering in viticulture|Propagation of grapevines}}
[[File:Layer (PSF).png|thumb|Layering]]

'''Layering''' has evolved as a common means of vegetative propagation of numerous species in natural environments. Layering is also utilized by horticulturists to propagate desirable plants.

Natural layering typically occurs when a branch touches the ground, whereupon it produces [[adventitious roots]]. At a later stage the connection with the parent plant is severed and a new plant is produced as a result.

The horticultural layering process typically involves wounding the target region to expose the inner stem and optionally applying [[auxin|rooting compound]]s. In '''ground layering''' or '''simple layering''', the stem is bent down and the target region buried in the soil. This is done in [[plant nursery|plant nurseries]] in imitation of natural layering by many plants such as [[bramble]]s which bow over and touch the tip on the ground, at which point it grows roots and, when separated, can continue as a separate plant. In either case, the rooting process may take from several weeks to a year.

Layering is more complicated than taking [[Cutting (plant)|cuttings]], but has the advantage that the propagated portion continues to receive [[water]] and [[nutrient]]s from the parent plant while it is forming roots.  This is important for plants that form roots slowly, or for propagating large pieces. Layering is used quite frequently in the propagation of [[bonsai]]; it is also used as a technique for both creating new roots and improving existing roots.

==Method==
A low-growing [[Plant stem|stem]] is bent down to touch a hole dug in the ground, then pinned in place using something shaped like a [[clothes hanger]] hook and covered over with soil.  However, a few inches of leafy growth must remain above the ground for the bent stem to grow into a new plant.  Removing a section of skin from the lower-facing stem part before burying may help the rooting process.  If using [[Auxin|rooting hormone]], the stem should be cut just beneath a [[Node (botany)|node]].  The resultant notch should be wedged open with a toothpick or similar piece of wood and the hormone applied before burying.

The buried stem part then grows new roots which take hold in the soil while the above parts grow as individual new plants.  Once the end of the stem has grown long enough the process can be repeated, creating the appearance of a row of plants linked by humped, intermittently buried stems.  Better results can be achieved when the top of the plant is closer to the vertical.

Once the process is completed, the buried section should be kept well-watered until roots begin to form.  The new individual plant may require one to two years before it is strong enough to survive on its own. When it is, the original stem should be cut where it enters the ground, thereby separating the two plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ces.ncsu.edu/depts/hort/hil/hil-8701.html|title=Plant Propagation by Layering: Instructions for the Home Gardener - NC State University|author=Ervin Evans|work=ncsu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010614031022/http://www.hort.purdue.edu/ext/ho-1.pdf New Plants From Layering], Department of Horticulture, [[Purdue University]] Cooperative Extension&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plant types and benefits==
As layering does not involve [[sexual reproduction]], new plants are effectively [[Cloning|clone]]s of the original plant and will exhibit the same characteristics.  This includes flower, fruit and foliage.  Plant selection usually involves plants with a flexible stem.

Simple layering can be more attractive when managing a cascading or spreading plant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/gardens-gardening/your-garden/help-for-the-home-gardener/advice-tips-resources/visual-guides/simple-layering-of-an-indoor-plant-1.aspx Simple Layering of an Indoor Plant Part 1], [[Missouri Botanical Garden]] (In depth practical instructions with detailed photographic illustration, specific to indoor varieties)&lt;/ref&gt;  These plants tend to propagate in this manner anyway, and potting a new limb will give extra plants without having to sow new seed.

Simple layering can also help when a plant has overgrown its pot and is drooping over the side.  The long stem is layered into another pot until it roots, thus bringing it back to soil level.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/gardens-gardening/your-garden/help-for-the-home-gardener/advice-tips-resources/visual-guides/simple-layering-of-an-indoor-plant-2.aspx Simple Layering of an Indoor Plant Part 2], [[Missouri Botanical Garden]] (In depth practical instructions with detailed photographic illustration, specific to indoor varieties)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ground layering==
Ground layering or mound layering is the typical propagation technique for the popular [[Malling series|Malling-Merton]] series of [[Cloning|clonal]] [[apple]] rootstocks, in which the original plants are set in the ground with the stem nearly horizontal, which forces side buds to grow upward{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}. After these are started, the original stem is buried up to some distance from the tip. At the end of the growing season, the side branches will have rooted, and can be separated while the plant is dormant. Some of these will be used for [[grafting]] rootstocks, and some can be reused in the nursery for the next growing season's crop.

Ground layering is used in the formation of visible surface roots, known as "nebari", on bonsai trees. 
&lt;!--cases where they have existing unattractive or one-sided roots.Example are Jasmine, Apple, Gooseberry, Peach, Currants, Quinces.--&gt;

==Air layering==
[[File:Limonium dendroides air layering.jpg|thumbnail|left|Air layering of ''Limonium dendroides'']]
In '''air layering''' (or marcotting), the target region is wounded by an upward 4&amp;nbsp;cm long cut and held open with a toothpick or similar, or a strip of bark is removed. The wound is then surrounded with a lump of moisture-retaining medium such as [[sphagnum moss]] or [[cloth]], and then further surrounded by a moisture barrier such as [[plastic]] film tied or taped to the branch to prevent moisture loss or ingress of too much water as from rain.  [[Rooting hormone]] is often applied to the wound to encourage root growth. When sufficient roots have grown from the wound, the stem is removed from the parent plant and planted, taking care to shield it from too much sun and to protect it from drying out until the new roots take hold. It can take the layer from a few weeks to one or more growing seasons to produce sufficient roots; this is largely dependent on the plant species and the vigor of the parent plant.

In [[New York (state)|New York]] state, there are a number of murder victims in the category of [[unidentified decedent]]s. In these cases, the murderer has never been identified.

==Ulster County John Doe==

A frozen male corpse was found on February 1, 1970 in the [[Ulster County, New York|Ulster County]] town of [[Saugerties (town), New York|Saugerties]], at the bottom of a slope near [[Platte Clove]] Road by two children who were out sledding. He was aged between 35 and 45 and had been shot four times in the back of the head. The victim was approximately {{convert|5|ft|3|in|cm}} tall and weighed about {{convert|155|lb}}. He had dark brown hair, with balding at the crown. He was wearing a tan three-quarter length raincoat over a dark green suit with faint [[Pin stripes|pinstripes]]; beneath was a blue dress shirt and black silk [[Playboy Enterprises]] tie with pajamas underneath. On his feet were gray socks and size 8{{frac|1|2}} black dress shoes covered by black Canadian-made Wings [[galoshes|rubbers]]. In his pocket he had $156 (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|156|1970}}}} in modern dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) in cash, but no identification.&lt;ref name="THR 2016 story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Yakin|first=Heather|title=Unsolved: Police still working West Saugerties case|url=http://www.recordonline.com/news/20160925/unsolved-police-still-working-west-saugerties-case|newspaper=[[Times Herald Record]]|date=September 25, 2016|accessdate=September 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He appeared to be from outside the United States, most likely [[Brazil]]. His suit has been described as "European-style". On his wrist was an Omega Seamaster wristwatch (serial number 16815714) that had been sold in a Portuguese coastal resort town. His other accessory was a gold ring whose stamp indicated it had been made in Brazil, set with an imitation [[ruby]] of Portuguese manufacture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File: 405UMNY|url=http://doenetwork.org/cases/405umny.html|date= 22 January 2012|website=doenetwork.org|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His undershirt was a Brazilian store brand, made in [[Taiwan]]; the bullets used to kill him also appeared to be a Brazilian brand.&lt;ref name="THR 2016 story" /&gt;

The death is believed to be gang-related. Members of local organized crime groups were questioned, but never revealed who the victim was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Noble &amp; Ready|url=http://canyouidentifyme.blogspot.com/2011/09/noble-ready.html|website=canyouidentifyme.blogspot.com|accessdate=4 December 2014|date=27 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, investigators had the body [[exhumation|exhumed]] and sent samples for a [[DNA]] profile; so far there have been no matches to those in any database.&lt;ref name="2016 Freeman story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pineiro-Zucker|first=Diane|title=Police still hope to crack 46-year-old cold case of man found shot to death in West Saugerties|url=http://www.dailyfreeman.com/general-news/20160621/police-still-hope-to-crack-46-year-old-cold-case-of-man-found-shot-to-death-in-west-saugerties|newspaper=[[Daily Freeman]]|date=August 21, 2016|accessdate=September 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chautauqua County Jane Doe==

On the morning of December 6, 1983, a woman's body was found by utility workers in a roadside ditch alongside eastbound [[New York State Route 17|NY 17]] (now [[Interstate 86 (east)|Interstate 86]]) in the [[Chautauqua County, New York|Chautauqua County]] town of [[Ellery, New York|Ellery]]. She had been shot four times: twice in the chest, once in the mouth and once in the back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unsolved cases|url=http://www.sheriff.us/#!form/c21os|publisher=New York State Troopers}}&lt;/ref&gt; The woman carried documents available in European countries and in Canada and had dental work appearing to use European techniques. The victim had brown eyes and graying brown hair, and was also estimated to have given birth to a child within the last 15 years. She was between 33 and 37 years of age when she had died, hours before being found. She was around {{convert|5|ft|4|in|cm}} tall and weighed around {{convert|128|lb}}. It is suspected that she may have been Canadian, as she carried a handwritten note with indecipherable abbreviations that originated from an establishment in [[British Columbia]]. She had some distinct characteristics: a wart was visible above her left eye, a mole was found behind the left ear and a scar was visible on her neck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chautauqua New York Jane Doe December 1983|url=http://canyouidentifyme.org/ChautauquaNewYorkJaneDoeDecember1983|website=canyouidentifyme.org|accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The victim's clothing has caused some issues with determining her social class, as she wore both expensive and inexpensive clothing. The undershirt she wore originated from Italy and was not worth a lot of money. This product had also not been circulated globally. She also wore a multicolored trench coat that was fairly expensive, along with a pullover and a "handmade" skirt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File 193UFNY|url=http://doenetwork.org/cases/193ufny.html|website=doenetwork.org|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 2, 1985, a man's remains were found nearly two years after his death, in Philipstown, Putnam County, New York. He was found with  a dress shirt along with shorts, two pairs of pants with army coloring and corduroy material and work boots. Several pairs of underwear and socks were also found at the scene. A map of [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[New Jersey]], a comb, dental floss and [[playing card]]s were among his possessions. At one time in his life, he received orthodontic care.&lt;ref name=decades&gt;{{cite web| title=Decades Later, Who is this John Doe?| url=http://www.ctcoldcases.com/newyork.html| accessdate=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="New York State Troopers"&gt;{{cite web|title=Unidentified: Philipstown, Putnum County|url=https://www.troopers.ny.gov/Wanted_and_Missing/Unidentified/view.cfm?ID=82a82aa8-c260-4a94-936c-5d0f384b76fa&amp;printer|publisher=New York State Troopers|accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 14, 1988, the "posed" nude body of a woman was found on a street in Mount Vernon, Westchester County, New York. The victim had been dead for approximately six to twelve hours, and was bound at the wrists and ankles and had died from ligature strangulation as well as suffering a beating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Westchester New York Jane Doe February 1988|url=http://canyouidentifyme.org/WestchesterNewYorkJaneDoeFebruary1988|website=canyouidentifyme.org|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was aged 18 to 30, with hazel eyes and with bleached, light brown or blonde hair. She was 5 feet 3 inches tall, weighed 105 pounds, and had pierced ears without earrings. She had numerous freckles and moles (including a large and prominent mole on her neck). Her underarms had not been shaved for approximately two weeks, but her pubic area was recently shaved. This detail has led some investigators to presume she could have been a prostitute. The fact that the rest of the body showed an absence of shaving, it has also been suggested she was foreign to the United States, and could be of South American descent. Her nails were painted pink prior to her death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File: 51UFNY|url=http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/51ufny.html|website=doenetwork.org|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; No clothing was found at or near the scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NamUs UP # 10229|url=https://identifyus.org/cases/10229|website=identifyus.org|publisher=[[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]]|accessdate=28 September 2014|date=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An autopsy found that she had ingested cocaine and broccoli before her murder, which may have been the work of a serial offender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://crimewatchdaily.com/2015/10/19/help-crime-watch-daily-and-carl-koppelman-give-names-to-these-5-murder-victims/ | title=HELP CRIME WATCH DAILY AND CARL KOPPELMAN GIVE NAMES TO THESE 5 MURDER VICTIMS | publisher=Fox | work=Crime Watch Daily | date=10 October 2015 | accessdate=December 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 31, 1988, a skeleton was found in a shallow grave by a boy who was digging at the edge of his family's property in [[Irondequoit]], [[Monroe County, New York]].  No signs of trauma were found, but the cause of death was ruled as a homicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File: 122UFNY|url=http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/122ufny.html|website=doenetwork.org|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unidentified: Town of Irondequoit, Monroe County, NY|url=http://www.troopers.ny.gov/Wanted_and_Missing/Unidentified/view.cfm?ID=6aa9b4ad-8e04-4ece-9f18-4c9fcb642d49|publisher=New york State Troopers|accessdate=18 August 2014|date=4 October 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In all [[bilaterian]] animals, the '''mesoderm''' is one of the three primary [[germ layer]]s in the very early [[embryo]]. The other two layers are the [[ectoderm]] (outside layer) and [[endoderm]] (inside layer), with the mesoderm as the middle layer between them.&lt;ref name="RFB2004Mesoderm" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Langman's Medical Embryology 2010"&gt;Langman's Medical Embryology, 11th edition. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mesoderm forms [[mesenchyme]], [[mesothelium]], non-epithelial blood cells and [[coelomocyte]]s. Mesothelium lines [[coelom]]s. Mesoderm forms the muscles in a process known as [[myogenesis]], septa (cross-wise partitions) and [[Mesentery (zoology)|mesenteries]] (length-wise partitions); and forms part of the [[gonad]]s (the rest being the [[gamete]]s).&lt;ref name="RFB2004Mesoderm"&gt;{{cite book| author=Ruppert, E.E., Fox, R.S., and Barnes, R.D. | title=Invertebrate Zoology | chapter=Introduction to Bilateria | pages=217–218 | publisher=Brooks/Cole| edition=7th | isbn=0-03-025982-7 | year=2004}}{{Unreliable source?|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Myogenesis is specifically a function of [[Mesenchymal Stem Cell|mesenchyme]].

The mesoderm differentiates from the rest of the embryo through [[intercellular signaling]], after which the mesoderm is [[Cell polarity|polarized]] by an [[FGF and mesoderm formation|organizing center]].&lt;ref name="Kimelman-2004-p363"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kimelman, D.  |author2=Bjornson, C. |lastauthoramp=yes |chapter=Vertebrate Mesoderm Induction: From Frogs to Mice|editor=Stern, Claudio D.|title=Gastrulation: from cells to embryo|publisher=CSHL Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0-87969-707-5|page=363|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ljAKtC-iIrIC&amp;pg=PA363}}&lt;/ref&gt; The position of the organizing center is in turn determined by the regions in which [[beta-catenin]] is protected from degradation by GSK-3. Beta-catenin acts as a co-factor that alters the activity of the transcription factor tcf-3 from repressing to activating, which initiates the synthesis of gene products critical for mesoderm differentiation and gastrulation.  Furthermore, mesoderm has the capability to induce the growth of other structures, such as the [[neural plate]], the precursor to the nervous system.

==Definition==
The mesoderm  is one of the three germinal layers that appears in the third week of embryonic development. It is formed through a process called [[gastrulation]]. There are three important components, the paraxial mesoderm, the intermediate mesoderm and the lateral plate mesoderm. The paraxial mesoderm forms the somitomeres, which give rise to mesenchyme of the head and organize into somites in occipital and caudal segments. give, sclerotome (cartilage and bone), and dermatome (subcutaneous tissue of the skin).&lt;ref name="RFB2004Mesoderm" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Langman's Medical Embryology 2010"/&gt; Signals for somite differentiation are derived from surroundings structures, including the notochord, neural tube and epidermis. The intermediate mesoderm connects the paraxial mesoderm with the lateral plate, eventually it differentiates into urogenital structures consisting of the kidneys, gonads, their associated ducts, and the adrenal glands. The lateral plate mesoderm give rise to the heart, blood vessels and blood cells of the circulatory system as well as to the mesodermal components   of the limbs.&lt;ref name="Scott-2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Scott, Gilbert|title=Developmental biology|publisher=Sinauer Associates|edition=ninth|place=USA|year= 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the mesoderm derivatives include the muscle (smooth, cardiac and skeletal), the muscles of the tongue (occipital somites), the pharyngeal arches muscle (muscles of mastication, muscles of facial expressions), connective tissue, dermis and subcutaneous layer of the [[skin]], [[bone]] and cartilage, dura mater, [[endothelium]] of [[blood vessels]], [[red blood cells]], [[white blood cells]], and microglia, the kidneys and the adrenal cortex.&lt;ref name="Dudek-2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dudek, Ronald W.|title=High-yield. Embryology|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|edition= 4th|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of the mesodermal germ layer==
During the third week a process called [[gastrulation]] creates a mesodermal layer between the endoderm and the ectoderm. This process begins with formation of a primitive streak on the surface of the epiblast.&lt;ref name="NCBI-2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10085/|title=Paraxial Mesoderm: The somites and their derivatives|publisher=NCBI|accessdate =April 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cells of the layers move between the epiblast and hypoblast and begin to spread laterally and cranially. The cells of the epiblast move toward the primitive streak and slip beneath it in a process called invagination.  Some of the migrating cells displace the hypoblast and create the endoderm, and others migrate between the endoderm and the epiblast to create the mesoderm. The remaining cells form the ectoderm. After that, the epiblast and the hypoblast establish contact with the extraembryonic mesoderm until they cover the yolk sac and amnion. They move onto either side of the prechordal plate. The prechordal cells migrate to the midline to form the notochordal plate. The chordamesoderm is the central region of trunk mesoderm.&lt;ref name="Scott-2010" /&gt; This forms the notochord which induces the formation of the neural tube and establishes the anterior-posterior body axis. The notochord extends beneath the neural tube from the head to the tail. The mesoderm moves to the midline until it covers the notochord, when the mesoderm cells proliferate they form the paraxial mesoderm.  In each side, the mesoderm remains thin and is known as the lateral plate.  The intermediate mesoderm lies between the paraxial mesoderm and the lateral plate.
Between days 13 and 15, the proliferation of extraembryonic mesoderm, primitive streak and embryonic mesoderm take place. The notochord process occurs between days 15 and 17. Eventually, the development of the notochord canal and the axial canal takes place between days 17 and 19 when the first three somites are formed.&lt;ref name="Drews-1993"&gt;{{cite book|author= Drew, Ulrich|title=Color atlas of embryology|publisher=Thieme|place=German|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paraxial mesoderm==
During the third week, the paraxial mesoderm is organized into segments. If they appear in the cephalic region and grow with cephalocaudal direction, they are called somitomeres. If they appear in the cephalic region but establish contact with the neural plate, they are known as [[neuromere]]s, which later will form the mesenchyme in the head. The somitomeres organize into somites which grow in pairs. In the fourth week the somites lose their organization and cover the notochord and spinal cord to form the backbone. In the fifth week, there are 4 occipital somites, 8 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral and 8 to 10 coccygeal that will form the axial skeleton.  Somitic derivatives are determined by local signaling between adjacent embryonic tissues, in particular the neural tube, notochord, surface ectoderm and the somitic compartments themselves.&lt;ref name="Yusuf-2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yusuf|first=Faisal|title=The eventful somite: Patterning, fate determination and cell division in the somite|journal=Anatomy and embryology|year=2006|pages=21–30|url=http://0search.proquest.com.millenium.itesm.mx/healthcomplete/docview/212010706/abstract/13D9F3D5B371BF5540B/1?accountid=11643}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The correct specification of the deriving tissues, skeletal, cartilage, endothelia and connective tissue is achieved by a sequence of morphogenic changes of the paraxial mesoderm, leading to the three transitory somitic compartments: dermomyotome, myotome and sclerotome. These structures are specified from dorsal to ventral and from medial to lateral.&lt;ref name="Yusuf-2006" /&gt; each somite will form its own sclerotome that will differentiate into the tendon cartilage and bone component. Its myotome will form the muscle component and the dermatome that will form the dermis of the back. The myotome and dermatome have a nerve component.&lt;ref name="RFB2004Mesoderm" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Langman's Medical Embryology 2010"/&gt;

==Molecular regulation of somite differentiation==
Surrounding structures such as the notochord, neural tube, epidermis and lateral plate mesoderm send signals for somite differentiation&lt;ref name="RFB2004Mesoderm" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Langman's Medical Embryology 2010"/&gt; Notochord protein accumulates in presomitic mesoderm destined to form the next somite and then decreases as that somite is established. The notochord and the neural tube activate the protein SHH  which helps the somite to form its sclerotome. The cells of the sclerotome express the protein PAX1 that induces the cartilage and bone formation. The neural tube activates the protein WNT1 that expresses PAX 2 so the somite creates the myotome and dermatome. Finally, the neural tube also secretes neurotrophin 3 (NT-3), so that the somite creates the dermis. Boundaries for each somite are regulated by retinoic acid (RA) and a combination of FGF8 and WNT3a.&lt;ref name="RFB2004Mesoderm" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Langman's Medical Embryology 2010"/&gt; So the retinoic acid is an endogenous signal that maintains the bilateral synchrony of mesoderm segmentation and controls bilateral symmetry in vertebrates. The bilaterally symmetric body plan of vertebrate embryos is obvious in somites and their derivates such as the vertebral column. Therefore, asymmetric somite formation correlates with a left-right desynchronization of the segmentation oscillations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vermot|first1=J.|last2=Gallego Llamas|first2=J.|last3=Fraulob|first3=V.|last4=Niederreither|first4=K.|last5=Chambon|first5=P.|last6=Dollé|first6=P.|title=Retinoic acid controls the bilateral symmetry of somite formation in the mouse embryo|journal=Science|date=April 2005|volume=308|issue=5721|pages=563–566|doi=10.1126/science.1108363|pmid=15731404}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many studies with Xenopus and zebrafish have analyzed the factors of this development and how they interact in signaling and transcription. However, there are still some doubts in how the prospective mesodermal cells integrate the various signals they receive and how they regulate their morphogenic behaviours and cell-fate decisions.&lt;ref name="Yusuf-2006" /&gt; Human embryonic stem cells for example have the potential to produce all of the cells in the body and they are able to self-renew indefinitely so they can be used for a large-scale production of therapeutic cell lines.  They are also able to remodel and contract collagen and were induced to express muscle actin. This shows that these cells are multipotent cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boyd|first1=N.L.|last2=Robbins KR|first2=K.R.|last3=Dhara SK|first3=S.K.|last4=West FD,|first4=F.D.|last5=Stice SL.|first5=S.L.|title=Human embryonic stem cell-derived mesoderm-like epithelium transitions to mesenchymal progenitor cells|journal=Tissue Engineering.

==Intermediate mesoderm ==
The intermediate mesoderm connects the paraxial mesoderm with the lateral plate and differentiates into urogenital structures.&lt;ref name="Kumar-2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kumar, Rani| title=Textbook of human embryology|publisher=I.K. International|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In upper thoracic and cervical regions this forms the nephrotomes, and in caudally regions this forms the nephrogenic cord. It also helps to develop the excretory units of the urinary system and the gonads.&lt;ref name="Scott-2010" /&gt;

==Lateral plate mesoderm==
The lateral plate mesoderm splits into parietal (somatic) and visceral (splanchnic) layers. The formation of these layers starts with the appearance of intercellular cavities.&lt;ref name="Kumar-2008" /&gt; The somatic layer depends on a continuous layer with mesoderm that covers the amnion. The splanchnic depends on a continuous layer that covers the yolk sac. The two layers cover the intraembryonic cavity.  The parietal layer together with overlying ectoderm forms the lateral body wall folds. The visceral layer forms the walls of the gut tube. Mesoderm cells of the parietal layer form the mesothelial membranes or serous membranes which line the peritoneal, pleural and pericardial cavities.&lt;ref name="RFB2004Mesoderm" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Langman's Medical Embryology 2010"/&gt;

'''Mi-Go''' are a fictional race of [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]] created by [[H. P. Lovecraft]] and used by others in the [[Cthulhu Mythos]] setting. The word Mi-Go comes from "Migou", a Tibetan word for [[yeti]]. The aliens are fungus-based lifeforms which are extremely varied due to their prodigious surgical, biological, chemical, and mechanical skill. The variants witnessed by Akeley in "The Whisperer in Darkness" look like winged humanoid crabs, and do not resemble yeti.

Mi-Go are first named as such in Lovecraft's short story "[[The Whisperer in Darkness]]" (1931). However this is considered an elaboration on earlier references in his [[sonnet cycle]] ''[[Fungi from Yuggoth]]'' (1929–30) to descriptions of alien vegetation on dream-worlds.

The Mi-Go have appeared across a range of media set in the Cthulhu Mythos.

==Description==
The "Mi-Go" are large, pinkish, fungoid, [[crustacean]]-like entities the size of a man; where a head would be, they have a "convoluted ellipsoid" composed of pyramided, fleshy rings and covered in antennae. They are about {{convert|5|ft|m|spell=in}} long, and their crustacean-like bodies bear numerous sets of paired appendages. They possess a pair of membranous bat-like wings which are used to fly through the "[[Luminiferous aether|aether]]" of outer space.&lt;ref&gt;The aether concept attempted explain the travel of light through space and is now scientifically discredited, but was widely accepted up to about 1900 and was presumably part of Lovecraft's education.&lt;/ref&gt; The wings do not function well on Earth. Several other races in Lovecraft's Mythos also have wings like these.

In the original short story, the creatures cannot be recorded using ordinary photographic film, due to their bodies being formed from otherworldly matter.
They are capable of going into suspended animation until softened and reheated by the sun or some other source of heat.

The Mi-Go can transport humans from Earth to [[Pluto]] (and beyond) and back again by removing the subject's [[Human brain|brain]] and placing it into a "brain cylinder" as an [[isolated brain]], which can be attached to external devices to allow it to see, hear, and speak.

In "[[The Whisperer in Darkness]]" the Mi-Go are heard to give praise to [[Nyarlathotep]] and [[Shub-Niggurath]], suggesting some form of worship. Their moral system is completely alien, making them seem highly malicious from a human perspective.

One of the moons of [[Yuggoth]] holds designs that are sacred to the Mi-Go; these are useful in various processes mentioned in the ''[[Necronomicon]]''. It is said that transcriptions of these designs can be sensed by the Mi-Go, and those possessing them shall be hunted down by the few remaining on earth.&lt;ref&gt;In "The Whisperer in Darkness", a "black stone with unknown hieroglyphics" from Yuggoth is among the items owned by the narrator that the Mi-Go want to recover as part of their plot to lure him to the Akeley farmhouse.{{clarify|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supposedly, a group known as the Brotherhood of the [[Yellow Sign]] are dedicated to hunting them down and exterminating the fungoid threat, though it is unknown if this is actually true since it was given as a reason for their remaining hidden. [[Hastur]], which is mentioned in passing among several other places and things, was eventually converted into a God-Like alien being by [[August Derleth]] who gave it the title "Him Who is Not to be Named". However, in "The Whisperer in Darkness", a human ally of the Mi-Go mentions "Him Who Is Not to Be Named" in the list of honored entities along with Nyarlathotep and Shub-Niggurath. Lovecraft never made a connection between Hastur and "Him Who Is Not to Be Named", and indeed didn't even imply Hastur was a being; Derleth was the one to do so.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

== Other appearances ==

The Mi-Go appear in the Lovecraft novella ''[[At the Mountains of Madness]]'' (1931), in which they are described as having made war with the [[Elder Things]] long before the existence of humans.

The Mi-Go appeared in [[comic book]]s in the first three issues of ''[[H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu: The Whisperer in Darkness]]'' that featured the [[Miskatonic Project]], created by [[Mark Ellis (American author)|Mark Ellis]].

The Mi-Go are prominent antagonists in [[Pagan Publishing]]'s ''[[Delta Green]]'' sourcebook for the ''[[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Call of Cthulhu]]'' role-playing game. It mentions three castes: scientist, soldier, and worker. The book states that the Mi-Go usually have five pairs of appendages, though the number can vary. Normally, the first pair is designed for grasping and manipulating, but in the scientist caste it is usually the first two pairs. The remaining appendages are used for locomotion. The soldiers may have two or more pairs of wings. Some individuals do not have wings at all if they are deemed unnecessary to their task. The Mi-Go apparently can modify their own bodies. This source suggests that all their external accoutrements are actually extruded at will from the central gelatinous mass similar to the way the [[Shoggoth]] extrude body parts. In the ''Delta Green'' setting, the "[[grey alien|Greys]]" are puppets remotely controlled by the Mi-Go.

They are distinguished by their mastery in various fields of [[science]], especially [[surgery]]. Although they originate from beyond our [[solar system]], they have set up an outpost on [[Pluto]] (known as [[Yuggoth]] in the mythos) and sometimes visit Earth to mine for minerals and other natural resources. The Mi-Go normally communicate by changing the colors of their orb-like heads or by emitting odd buzzing noises. They can also speak any human language upon receiving the appropriate surgical modification.

The Mi-Go are one of the main enemies of humanity in the role-playing game [[CthulhuTech]], which combines Lovecraft's fiction with tropes and themes from [[mecha anime]]. In the game, their name is spelled “Migou” (see below), but they are commonly referred to as ''bugs'' by humans.

They are presented in CthulhuTech much as they are in the original Lovecraft stories, and somewhat similar to that in Delta Green: they are masters of science and genetics, and in particular human genetics. Their hostility to humanity could be seen{{by whom|date=January 2012}} as jealousy that humans had created a technology which they had never thought of, combined with a fear of humanity's growing power. Although it is stated that they have emotions vastly different from our own, their campaign on Earth developed into genocidal hatred of humans.

In ''[[Allan and the Sundered Veil]]'', [[Allan Quatermain]], [[Randolph Carter]], [[John Carter of Mars]], and [[The Time Traveller (character)|the Time Traveller]] encounter the Mi-Go, which are stated to be the same as [[Morlock]]s and the [[Yeti]]s.

In "[[To Mars and Providence]]", the Mi-Go engage in trade with the [[Martian (War of the Worlds)|Martian]]s from ''[[The War of the Worlds]]''.

The Mi-Go appear in the final segment of the movie ''[[Necronomicon (film)|Necronomicon]]'', directed by Brian Yuzna.

A Mi-Go is scripted to walk across the stage during the "Tentacles" number of ''[[A Shoggoth on the Roof]]'', prompting Armitage to say "some horrible creature... I do not even want to know what ''that'' is".

The horror-themed miniatures game [[HorrorClix]], which features Cthulhu as a colossal figure, includes a Mi-Go as a unique figure in its ''The Lab'' expansion.

The Mi-Go also appear as sinister brain collectors in the short story "Boojum", written by [[Sarah Monette]] and [[Elizabeth Bear]].

The computer game ''[[Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead]]'' features the Mi-Go among the numerous different types of monster that assault the earth. This Mi-Go appears to be inspired by, rather than lifted from, the original Lovecraftian creature, since their unique feature in the game is to mimic human speech and other sounds in an attempt to lure people towards them.

== Origin of the word ==
It is possible that Lovecraft encountered the word ''migou'' in his readings. ''Migou'' is the [[Tibet]]an equivalent of the [[yeti]], an ape-like [[cryptid]] said to inhabit the high mountain ranges of that region.&lt;ref&gt;''Mi-Go'' is the compound word for "man-wild" (wild man; Wylie: mi rgod; Tib: མི་རྒོད་) in Tibetan and is pronounced ''me-gö''. (See Goldstein, pp. 251, 792, 794.)&lt;/ref&gt; While the Mi-Go of Lovecraft's mythos is completely unlike the migou of Tibetan stories, Lovecraft seems to equate the two, as can be seen in the following excerpt from "The Whisperer in Darkness":

{{quote|
It was of no use to demonstrate to such opponents that the Vermont myths differed but little in essence from those universal legends of natural personification which filled the ancient world with fauns and dryads and satyrs, suggested the kallikanzarai of modern Greece, and gave to wild Wales and Ireland their dark hints of strange, small, and terrible hidden races of troglodytes and burrowers. No use, either, to point out the even more startlingly similar belief of the Nepalese hill tribes in the dreaded Mi-Go or "Abominable Snow-Men" who lurk hideously amidst the ice and rock pinnacles of the Himalayan summits. When I brought up this evidence, my opponents turned it against me by claiming that it must imply some actual historicity for the ancient tales; that it must argue the real existence of some queer elder earth-race, driven to hiding after the advent and dominance of mankind, which might very conceivably have survived in reduced numbers to relatively recent times—or even to the present.

'''''Monster Tale''''' is a [[Nintendo DS]] [[platformer]] and [[virtual pet]] game developed by [[DreamRift]] and published by [[Majesco Entertainment]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hatfield |first=Daemon |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/05/11/project-monster-evolves |title=Project Monster Evolves |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=May 11, 2010 |accessdate=May 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was only released in North America. It follows the story of a young girl, named Ellie, and her adventures in Monster World with her monster companion, Chomp. Together they must stop the evil Kid-Kings and return Monster World to its rightful inhabitants, the monsters, and also find a way for Ellie to return home.

==Controversy==
According to the game developers, there was pressure from the publisher not to feature a young female lead.
{{quote|text=This choice was actually somewhat controversial with some publishers. Our experience was that many publishers are looking to avert the risk of a main character that hasn’t been proven to capture large audiences. As a result, there was some concern from publishers that Ellie should change to a male or a more mature/sexy female.|sign=[[Peter Ong (game designer)|Peter Ong]]|source=''[[Nintendo Power]]'' issue 263}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9736">The '''Morris–Lecar model''' is a [[biological neuron model]] developed by Catherine Morris and Harold Lecar to reproduce the variety of [[Neural oscillation|oscillatory]] behavior in relation to [[Calcium in biology|Ca&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt;]] and [[Potassium in biology|K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] conductance in the muscle fiber of the [[giant barnacle]] .&lt;ref name = ml81&gt;{{Citation| last = Morris| first = Catherine| last2 = Lecar| first2 = Harold| title = Voltage Oscillations in the barnacle giant muscle fiber| journal = Biophys.

==History==
Catherine Morris (b. 24 December 1949) is a Canadian biologist. She won a Commonwealth scholarship to study at [[Cambridge University]], where she earned her PhD in 1977. She became a professor at the [[University of Ottawa]] in the early 1980s. As of 2015, she is an [[emeritus professor]] at the University of Ottawa. Harold Lecar (18 October 1935 – 4 February 2014) was an American professor of biophysics and neurobiology at the [[University of California Berkeley]]. He graduated with his PhD in physics from [[Columbia University]] in 1963.

==Experimental method==
The Morris–Lecar experiments relied on the [[current clamp]] method established by [[Richard Keynes|Keynes]] ''et al.'' (1973).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last = Keynes  | first = RD  | author-link = Richard Keynes  | last2 = Rojas  | first2 = E  | last3 = Taylor  | first3 = RE  | last4 = Vergara  | first4 = J  | title = Calcium and potassium systems of a giant barnacle muscle fibre under membrane potential control  | journal = The Journal of Physiology  | volume = 229  | pages = 409–455  |date=March 1973  | url = http://www.pubmedcentral.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1350315  | id = | pmid=4724831 | pmc=1350315}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|Large specimens of the [[barnacle]] ''Balanus nubilus'' (Pacific Bio-Marine Laboratories Inc., Venice, California) were used. The barnacle was sawed into lateral halves, and the depressor scutorum rostralis muscles were carefully exposed. Individual fibers were dissected, the incision starting from the tendon. The other end of the muscle was cut close to its attachment on the shell and ligatured. Isolated fibers were either used immediately or kept for up to 30 min in standard artificial seawater (ASW; see below) before use. Experiments were carried out at room temperature of 22 [[Celsius|C]].&lt;ref name = ml81 /&gt; }}

==The principal assumptions underlying the Morris–Lecar model==

Among the principal assumptions are these:

#Equations apply to a spatially iso-potential patch of membrane. There are two persistent (non-inactivating) voltage-gated currents with oppositively biased reversal potentials. The depolarizing current is carried by Na+ or Ca2+ ions (or both), depending on the system to be modeled, and the hyperpolarizing current is carried by K+.
#Activation gates follow changes in membrane potential sufficiently rapidly that the activating conductance can instantaneously relax to its steady-state value at any voltage.
#The dynamics of the recovery variable can be approximated by a first-order linear differential equation for the probability of channel opening.&lt;ref name = scholar&gt;This assumption is never exactly true, since channel proteins are composed of subunits, which must act in concert, to reach the open state. Despite missing delays in the onset of recovery, the model appears to be adequate for phase-plane considerations for many excitable systems.{{Citation| last = Lecar| first = Harold| title = Morris–Lecar model| journal = [[Scholarpedia]]| volume = 2| issue = 10| pages = 1333| year = 2007| doi = 10.4249/scholarpedia.1333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physiological description==
The Morris–Lecar model is a two-dimensional system of [[Nonlinear system|nonlinear]] [[differential equations]].  It is considered a simplified model compared to the four-dimensional [[Hodgkin–Huxley model]].

Qualitatively, this system of equations describes the complex relationship between membrane potential and the activation of ion channels within the membrane: the potential depends on the activity of the ion channels, and the activity of the ion channels depends on the voltage. As bifurcation parameters are altered, different classes of neuron behavior are exhibited. {{math|''τ''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is associated with the relative time scales of the firing dynamics, which varies broadly from cell to cell and exhibits significant temperature dependency.&lt;ref name = scholar /&gt;

Quantitatively:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
  C \frac{dV}{dt} &amp; ~=~ I - g_\mathrm{L} (V-V_\mathrm{L}) - g_\mathrm{Ca} M_\mathrm{ss} (V-V_\mathrm{Ca}) - g_\mathrm{K} N (V-V_\mathrm{K}) \\[5pt]
  \frac{dN}{dt} &amp; ~=~ \frac{N_\mathrm{ss}-N}{\tau_N}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where
&lt;!-- :&lt;math&gt; M_{ss} = (1 + \tanh[(V-V_1)/V_2])/2 &lt;/math&gt; :&lt;math&gt; N_{ss} = (1 + \tanh[(V-V_3)/V_4])/2 &lt;/math&gt; :&lt;math&gt; \tau_N = 1/[\varphi \cosh[(V-V_3)/(2V_4)]&lt;/math&gt; :{{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;ss&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} (1 + tanh[(''V'' − ''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) / ''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]) / 2}} :{{math|''N''&lt;sub&gt;ss&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} (1 + tanh[(''V'' - ''V''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) / ''V''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]) / 2}} :{{math|''τ''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} (''φ''·cosh[(''V'' - ''V''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) / 2''V''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;])&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}} --&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
  M_\mathrm{ss} &amp; ~=~ \frac{1}{2} \cdot \left(1 + \tanh \left[\frac{V-V_1}{V_2} \right]\right) \\[5pt]
  N_\mathrm{ss} &amp; ~=~ \frac{1}{2} \cdot \left(1 + \tanh \left[\frac{V-V_3}{V_4} \right]\right) \\[5pt]
  \tau_N &amp; ~=~ 1 / \left( \varphi \cosh \left[\frac{V-V_3}{2V_4} \right] \right)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;ss&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''N''&lt;sub&gt;ss&lt;/sub&gt;}} equations may also be expressed as {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;ss&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} (1 + exp[−2(''V'' − ''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) / ''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;])&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|''N''&lt;sub&gt;ss&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} (1 + exp[−2(''V'' − ''V''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) / ''V''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;])&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, however most authors prefer the form using the hyperbolic functions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1474">'''Muawiyah bin Al Mugheerah''' was an Arab Pagan during the time of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]]. He was captured during the [[Invasion of Hamra al-Asad]], where Muhammad accused him of being a Meccan spy, he was  the cousin of [[Uthman ibn Affan]], had been captured after Uhud. Uthman gave him shelter. He was given a grace period of three days and arranged a camel and provisions for his return journey to Mecca.  Uthman departed with Muhammad for Hamra-al-Asad, and Muawiyah overstayed his grace. Though he fled by the time the army returned, Muhammad ordered his pursuit and execution. The orders were carried out.&lt;ref name="witness-pioneer.org"&gt;Safiur-Rahman Mubarakpuri, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-ppPqzawIrIC&amp;pg=PA183 The Sealed Nectar], p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Za'd Al-Ma p.242-275"&gt;Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/91-108&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Hisham 2/60-129&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fath Al-Bari 7/345-377&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mukhtasar Seerat Ar-Rasool p.242-275&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maria Colwell''' (26 March 1965 – 6 January 1973) was an English child who was killed by her [[Stepfamily#Stepfathers|stepfather]] in January 1973.&lt;ref&gt;''The Tragedy of Maria Colwell'' Scott, P.D: British Journal of J Criminology.1975; 15: 88-90&lt;/ref&gt; The case was widely reported at the time and resulted in a public enquiry: ''Committee of Inquiry into the Care and Supervision Provided in Relation to Maria Colwell (1974). Report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Care and Supervision provided by local authorities and other agencies in Relation to Maria Colwell and the co-ordination between them.'' (Chairman: T.G. Field-Fisher)

40 years after her death the case of Maria Colwell has remained in collective memory and has often been referred to when similar cases have come to light, such as the death of [[Murder of Victoria Climbié|Victoria Climbié]] in 2000, [[Death of Baby P|Peter Connelly]] in 2007 and [[Murder of Daniel Pelka|Daniel Pelka]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.familylawweek.co.uk/site.aspx?i=ed27934 |title='Baby P effect' causing rise in care applications says Douglas |publisher=Family Law Week |date= |accessdate=22 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gptsw.net/papers/clwlclmbi.pdf |title=From Maria Colwell to Victoria Climbie: Reflections on a generation of public inquiries into child abuse |author=Professor Nigel Parton |publisher=Child Abuse Review |date=July 2003 |accessdate=22 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828175252/http://www.gptsw.net/papers/clwlclmbi.pdf |archivedate=28 August 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maria was one of six siblings and is survived by her three half-brothers and two half-sisters, as well as her [[foster parent]]s Bob and Doris Cooper, with whom she spent six years of her life.

==Life and death==
Maria was born on 26 March 1965.  When she was a few months old her father Raymond Colwell died and as a result Maria and her siblings were all placed in foster care. At three months old she was placed with her aunt and uncle, Doris and Bob Cooper. There she was said to be very happy and well looked after.
&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'', Tuesday, 23 October 1973; pg. 3; Issue 58920; col A Foster-parents not told of decision to move girl&lt;/ref&gt;

Her situation changed drastically&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wavetrust.org/key-publications/articles/tale-10-children-2005 Wave Trust A tale of 10 children]&lt;/ref&gt; when on 22 October 1971 she returned to live with her biological mother Pauline Kepple and her partner William Kepple &lt;ref&gt;The Times, Wednesday, 17 October 1973; pg. 2; Issue 58915; col F ''Criticism of girl's return to her mother''&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[Whitehawk]] [[council estate]] in [[Brighton]], England.

William Kepple had children of his own with Pauline, and the couple favoured those children over Maria without compunction;&lt;ref&gt;The Times, Thursday, 31 May 1973; pg. 2; Issue 58796; col F ''Stepfather's preferential treatment''&lt;/ref&gt; for example, Kepple bought his biological children ice cream and required Maria to watch as they ate it, having refused to buy any for her. Many neighbours and teachers communicated concerns to various agencies.&lt;ref&gt;The Times, Wednesday, 10 October 1973; pg. 4; Issue 58909; col A
''Thirty complaints of ill-treatment were made before Maria died-QC''&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, even though she appeared "almost a walking skeleton", Maria was allowed to remain with the Kepples and her half-siblings.&lt;ref&gt;The Times, Thursday, 11 October 1973; pg. 3; Issue 58910; col A  ''Girl was like a living skeleton, neighbour tells inquiry''&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of 6 January 1973, Kepple arrived home at 11:30pm to find Maria still awake and watching television.  Her mother, fearing her drunk and violent husband, had kept Maria up.  Maria refused to acknowledge him upon his return home and he responded violently. He physically assaulted her, leaving her with severe injuries both internal and external; then he went to bed. The following morning he wheeled Maria in a [[baby transport|pram]] to the [[Royal Sussex County Hospital]] in Brighton with severe internal injuries including [[brain damage]]; she died shortly after arrival. Maria had an empty stomach when she died. Both her eyes were blackened and she had a fractured rib.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/jan/27/childrensservices.childprotection |title=Catalogue of cruelty |publisher=Guardian |date= 27 January 2003|accessdate=22 August 2009 | location=London | first=David | last=Batty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The case captured the public’s attention and the press called for action.&lt;ref&gt;"Social work, child abuse and the press" Wroe, A: Norwich, Social Work Monographs, 1988 {{ISBN|0-946751-49-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the publication of a book urging the tragedy not to be forgotten&lt;ref&gt;"Remember Maria”Howells, JG: London, Butterworth 1974 {{ISBN|0-407-38541-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; it took over thirty years before agencies were required by law to guarantee the free-flow of information.&lt;ref&gt;"Scandal, Social Policy and Social Welfare" Butler, I;Drakefore, M: Bristol Policy, 2005 {{ISBN|1-86134-746-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An inquiry was set up and was chaired by Thomas Gilbert Field Fisher, a [[Recorder (judge)|Recorder]] of the Crown Court. Other members included [[Olive Stevenson]], a social work academic. The ''Report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Care and Supervision Provided in Relation to Maria Colwell'' identified three main contributory factors: the lack of communication between the agencies who were aware of her vulnerable situation; inadequate training for social workers assigned to at-risk children; and changes in the make-up of society.&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is not enough for the State as representing society to assume responsibility for those such as Maria"  ''Fisher''&lt;ref&gt;Great Britain.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1901">'''Philip van Artevelde''' (c. 1340 &amp;ndash; 27 November 1382) was a [[Flemings|Flemish]] patriot, the son of [[Jacob van Artevelde]]. Because of his father's prominence he was godson of English queen [[Philippa of Hainault]], who held him in her arms during his baptism.
[[File:Filips van Artevelde 001.png|thumb|Dead body of Philip van Artevelde at the Battle of Roosebeke]]
Largely due to his father's name and the memory of his godmother, Philip was a leader of [[Ghent]] in 1381 at the head of the burgher's rebellion against [[Louis II of Flanders|Count Louis II of Flanders]]. Early success after the [[Battle of Beverhoutsveld]], led to the capture of [[Bruges]] and most of Flanders by the rebels, but Philip perished in the crush of bodies at the [[Battle of Roosebeke]] in 1382.

His body was displayed before French king [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]] and then hanged from a tree. After his death the command of Ghent was taken up by [[Franz Ackerman]].

His life was commemorated in a tragic play by [[Henry Taylor (dramatist)|Sir Henry Taylor]] in 1834.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16398">In philosophy, '''desire''' has been identified as a philosophical problem since [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]]. In [[Plato]]'s [[The Republic (Plato)|''The Republic'']], [[Socrates]] argues that individual desires must be postponed in the name of the higher ideal.

Within the teachings of [[Buddhism]], [[tanha|craving]] is thought to be the cause of all [[dukkha|suffering]]. By eliminating craving, a person can attain ultimate happiness, or [[Nirvana]]. While on the path to liberation, a practitioner is advised to "generate desire" for skillful ends.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Collins, ''Selfless Persons: Thought and Imagery in Theravada Buddhism''. Cambridge University Press, 1982, page 251: "In the end, the flowing streams of sense-desire must be 'cut' or 'crossed' completely; nevertheless, for the duration of the Path, a monk must perforce work with motivational and perceptual processes as they ordinarily are, that is to say, based on desire ... Thus, during mental training, the stream is not to be 'cut' immediately, but guided, like water along viaducts. The meditative steadying of the mind by counting in- and out-breaths (in the mindfulness of breathing) is compared to the steadying of a boat in 'a fierce current' by its rudder. The disturbance of the flow of a mountain stream by irrigation channels cut into its sides it used to illustrate the weakening of insight by the [[Five hindrances|five 'hindrances']]."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thanissaro Bhikkhu, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/wings/index.html  "The Wings to Awakening,"]. See specifically [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/wings/part2.html#part2-c this section].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Ancient Greece===
In [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[De Anima]]'' the soul is seen to be involved in motion, because animals desire things and in their desire, they acquire locomotion. Aristotle argued that desire is implicated in animal interactions and the propensity of animals to motion. But Aristotle acknowledges that desire cannot account for all purposive movement towards a goal. He brackets the problem by positing that perhaps [[reason]], in conjunction with desire and by way of the [[imagination]], makes it possible for one to apprehend an object of desire, to see it as desirable. In this way reason and desire work together to determine what is a good object of desire. This resonates with desire in the chariots of Plato's ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'', for in the ''Phaedrus'' the soul is guided by two horses, a dark horse of passion and a white horse of reason. Here passion and reason, as in Aristotle, are also together. [[Socrates]] does not suggest the dark horse be done away with, since its passions make possible a movement towards the objects of desire, but he qualifies desire and places it in a relation to reason so that the object of desire can be discerned correctly, so that we may have the right desire. [[Aristotle]] distinguishes desire into two aspects of  '''appetition''', and [[Volition (psychology)|volition]]. Appetition, or appetite, is a longing for or seeking after something.&lt;ref&gt;"Peripatetic philosophy" in

&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle makes the distinction as follows:

:Everything, too, is pleasant for which we have the desire within us, since desire is the craving for pleasure. Of the desires some are irrational, some associated with reason. By irrational I mean those which do not arise from any opinion held by the mind. Of this kind are those known as ‘natural’; for instance, those originating in the body, such as the desire for nourishment, namely hunger and thirst, and a separate kind of desire answering to each kind of nourishment; and the desires connected with taste and sex and sensations of touch in general; and those of smell, hearing, and vision. Rational desires are those which we are induced to have; there are many things we desire to see or get because we have been told of them and induced to believe them good.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]] 1370a18-27, trans. W. Rhys Roberts&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western philosophers===
In ''[[Passions of the Soul]]'', [[René Descartes]] writes of the passion of desire as an agitation of the soul that projects desire, for what it represents as agreeable, into the future. Desire in [[Immanuel Kant]] can represent things that are absent and not only objects at hand. Desire is also the preservation of objects already present, as well as the desire that certain effects not appear, that what affects one adversely be curtailed and prevented in the future. Moral and temporal values attach to desire in that objects which enhance one's future are considered more desirable than those that do not, and it introduces the possibility, or even necessity, of postponing desire in anticipation of some future event, anticipating [[Sigmund Freud]]'s text ''[[Beyond the Pleasure Principle]]''. See also, the [[pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]] in psychology.

In his ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]'', [[Baruch Spinoza]] declares desire to be "the very essence of man," in the "Definitions of the Affects" at the end of Part III.  An early example of desire as an ontological principle, it applies to all things or "modes" in the world, each of which has a particular vital ''"striving"'' (sometimes expressed with the Latin "conatus") ''to persist in existence'' (Part III, Proposition 7).  Different striving beings have different levels of power, depending on their capacity to persevere in being.  Affects, or emotions which are divided into the ''joyful'' and the ''sad'', alter our level of power or striving: joy is a passage "from a lesser to a greater perfection" or degree of power (III Prop. 11 Schol.), just as sadness is the opposite.  Desire, qualified by the imagination and the intellect, is an attempt to maximize power, to "strive to imagine those things that increase or aid the body's power of acting." (III Prop. 12).  Spinoza ends the ''Ethics'' by a proposition that both moral virtue and spiritual blessedness are a direct result of essential power to exist, i.e. desire (Part V Prop. 42).

In ''[[A Treatise on Human Nature]]'', [[David Hume]] suggests that reason is subject to passion. Motion is put into effect by desire, passions, and inclinations. It is desire, along with belief, that motivates action. [[Immanuel Kant]] establishes a relation between the beautiful and pleasure in ''[[Critique of Judgment]]''. He says "I can say of every representation that it is at least possible (as a cognition) it should be bound up with a pleasure. Of representation that I call pleasant I say that it actually excites pleasure in me. But the beautiful we think as having a necessary reference to satisfaction." Desire is found in the representation of the object.

[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] begins his exposition of desire in ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' with the assertion that "self-consciousness is the state of desire ({{lang-de|Begierde}}) in general." It is in the restless movement of the negative that desire removes the antithesis between itself and its object, "...and the object of immediate desire is a living thing...", and object that forever remains an independent existence, something other. Hegel's inflection of desire via [[stoicism]] becomes important in understanding desire as it appears in [[Marquis de Sade]]. [[Stoicism]] in this view has a negative attitude towards "...otherness, to desire, and work."

Reading [[Maurice Blanchot]] in this regard, in his essay ''Sade's Reason'', the libertine is one, of a type that sometimes intersects with a Sadean man, who finds in stoicism, solitude, and apathy the proper conditions. Blanchot writes, "...the libertine is thoughtful, self-contained, incapable of being moved by just anything." [[Apathy]] in de Sade is opposition not to desire but to its spontaneity. Blanchot writes that in Sade, "for passion to become energy, it is necessary that it be constricted, that it be mediated by passing through a necessary moment of insensibility, then it will be the greatest passion possible." Here is stoicism, as a form of discipline, through which the passions pass. Blanchot says, "Apathy is the spirit of negation, applied to the man who has chosen to be sovereign." Dispersed, uncontrolled passion does not augment one's creative force but diminishes it.

In his ''[[Principia Ethica]]'', British philosopher [[G. E. Moore]] argued that two theories of desire should be clearly distinguished.  The [[hedonistic]] theory of [[John Stuart Mill]] states that pleasure is the sole object of all desire. Mill suggests that a desire for an object is caused by an idea of the possible pleasure that would result from the attainment of the object.  The desire is fulfilled when this pleasure is achieved.  On this view, the pleasure is the sole motivating factor of the desire.  Moore proposes an alternative theory in which an actual pleasure is already present in the desire for the object and that the desire is then for that object and only indirectly for any pleasure that results from attaining it.  
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In the first place, plainly, we are not always conscious of expecting pleasure, when we desire a thing.  We may only be conscious of the thing which we desire, and may be impelled to make for it at once, without any calculation as to whether it will bring us pleasure or pain.  In the second place, even when we do expect pleasure, it can certainly be very rarely pleasure only which we desire.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Principia Ethica]]'' (1903), p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; On Moore's view, Mill's theory is too non-specific as to the objects of desire.  Moore provides the following example: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"For instance, granted that, when I desire my glass of port wine, I have also an idea of the pleasure I expect from it, plainly that pleasure cannot be the only object of my desire; the port wine must be included in my object, else I might be led by my desire to take wormwood instead of wine . . . If the desire is to take a definite direction, it is absolutely necessary that the idea of the object, from which the pleasure is expected, should also be present and should control my activity."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Principia Ethica]]'' (1903), pp. 70-71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For [[Charles Fourier]], following desires (like passions or in Fourier's own words 'attractions') is a means to attain [[harmony]].

===Eastern philosophies===
Within the teachings of [[Siddhartha Gautama]] ([[Buddhism]]), [[tanha|craving]] is thought to be the cause of all [[dukkha|suffering]] that one experiences in human existence. The extinction of this craving leads one to ultimate happiness, or [[Nirvana]]. Nirvana means "cessation", "extinction" (of suffering) or "extinguished", "quieted", "calmed";&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de spokensanskrit] dictionary with निर्वन as input&lt;/ref&gt; it is also known as "Awakening" or "Enlightenment" in the West. The [[Four Noble Truths]] were the first teaching of Gautama Buddha after attaining Nirvana. They state that suffering is an inevitable part of life as we know it. The cause of this suffering is attachment to, or craving for worldly pleasures of all kinds and clinging to this very existence, our "[[Atman (Buddhism)|self]]" and the things or people we—due to our delusions—deem the cause of our respective happiness or unhappiness. The suffering ends when the craving and desire ends, or one is freed from all desires by eliminating the delusions, reaches "Enlightenment".

While greed and lust are always unskillful, desire is ethically variable—it can be skillful, unskillful, or neutral.&lt;ref name="David Burton 2004, page 22"&gt;David Burton, "Buddhism, Knowledge and Liberation: A Philosophical Study." Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2004, page 22.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Buddhist perspective, the enemy to be defeated is craving rather than desire in general.&lt;ref name="David Burton 2004, page 22"/&gt;

===Psychoanalysis===
[[Jacques Lacan]]'s ''désir'' follows Freud's concept of ''Wunsch'' and it is central to Lacanian theories. For the aim of the talking cure—psychoanalysis—is precisely to lead the analysand or patient to uncover the truth about their desire, but this is only possible if that desire is articulated, or spoken.&lt;ref name="Fink"&gt;Fink, Bruce, ''The Lacanian Subject: Between Language and Jouissance'' (Princeton University Press, 1996), {{ISBN|978-0-691-01589-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lacan said that "it is only once it is formulated, named in the presence of the other, that desire appears in the full sense of the term."&lt;ref name="seminar_I"&gt;Lacan, J., ''The Seminar of Jacques Lacan: Book I: Freud's Papers on Technique 1953-1954'' "...what is important is to teach the subject to name, to articulate, to bring desire into existence" (W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1991), {{ISBN|978-0-393-30697-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; "That the subject should come to recognize and to name his/her desire, that is the efficacious action of analysis. But it is not a question of recognizing something which would be entirely given. In naming it, the subject creates, brings forth, a new presence in the world."&lt;ref name="seminar_II"&gt;Lacan, J., ''The Seminar of Jacques Lacan: Book II: The Ego in Freud's Theory and in the Technique of Psychoanalysis 1954-1955'' (W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1991), {{ISBN|978-0-393-30709-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[W]hat is important is to teach the subject to name, to articulate, to bring desire into existence." Now, although the truth about desire is somehow present in discourse, discourse can never articulate the whole truth about desire: whenever discourse attempts to articulate desire, there is always a leftover, a surplus.&lt;ref name=Fink/&gt;

In ''The Signification of the Phallus'' Lacan distinguishes desire from need and [[Demand (psychoanalysis)|demand]]. Need is a biological instinct that is articulated in demand, yet demand has a double function, on one hand it articulates need and on the other acts as a demand for love. So, even after the need articulated in demand is satisfied, the demand for love remains unsatisfied and this leftover is desire.&lt;ref name="Phallus"&gt;Lacan, J., 'The Signification of the Phallus' in ''Écrits''&lt;/ref&gt; For Lacan "desire is neither the appetite for satisfaction nor the demand for love, but the difference that results from the subtraction of the first from the second" (article cited). Desire then is the surplus produced by the articulation of need in demand. Lacan adds that "desire begins to take shape in the margin in which demand becomes separated from need." Hence desire can never be satisfied, or as [[Slavoj Žižek]] puts it "desire's ''raison d'être'' is not to realize its goal, to find full satisfaction, but to reproduce itself as desire."

It is also important to distinguish between desire and the drives. Even though they both belong to the field of the Other (as opposed to love), desire is one, whereas the drives are many. The drives are the partial manifestations of a single force called desire (see "[[Four discourses|The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis]]"). If one can surmise that ''[[objet petit a]]'' is the object of desire, it is not the object towards which desire tends, but the cause of desire. For desire is not a relation to an object but a relation to a lack (manque). Then desire appears as a social construct since it is always constituted in a dialectical relationship.

The '''Pokémon Trading Figure Game''' (also referred to as the '''Pokémon TFG''') is a [[collectible miniatures game]] similar to [[HeroClix]]. It is designed by Pokémon USA and based on [[Satoshi Tajiri]]'s ''[[Pokémon]]'' [[media franchise]].

It was released in [[Australia]] in August 2006, followed by releases in [[Europe]] and [[Southeast Asia]] later that year. The trading figures have been released in the [[United States]] and were released in [[Japan]] sometime in 2007.  As of March 18, 2008 Mike Liesik announced that the Pokémon TFG will be included in Pokémon Trading Card Leagues so players can earn their rewards in new ways. The first set released is called "Next Quest". The game seems to be played in a luck/strategy format that resembles the boardgame [[Risk]] with most actions being controlled by a spin mechanism on the figures. The figures are larger than most other figure games, highly detailed, and meant to introduce this type of game to younger players while holding the interest of older fans of the Pokémon series.

On June 2, 2009, the Pokémon Trading Figure Game was confirmed to be discontinued.&lt;ref name="TFGDiscontinued"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pokebeach.com/2009/06/pokemon-tfg-officially-discontinued |title=Pokemon TFG Officially Discontinued | author=Water Pokémon Master | date=June 2, 2008 | work=PokéBeach | accessdate=26 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pokémon Duel]], a [[free-to-play]] digital version of the Pokémon Trading Figure Game, was released for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] devices in April 2016.&lt;ref name="siliconera_ios"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.siliconera.com/2016/04/19/pokmon-comaster-now-available-ios-japan/ | title=Pokémon Comaster Is Now Available For iOS In Japan | work=Siliconera | author=Sato | date=19 April 2016 | accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|align   = right|width   = 25em|If you've played the different Pokémon games, you'll see a strong correlation amongst every part of the Pokémon experience. There will be slight differences—Move Points don't exist in the videogame, but they show up in the TFG as part of its game mechanics, for instance. Our goal is to maintain the spirit of the Pokémon through all the properties—Charizard is still a powerhouse but can be defeated with a solid plan or good luck!|source  = J. C. Smith, the Director of Marketing for Pokémon USA&lt;ref name="ign interview"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/834/834231p1.html | title=Pokemon: Trading Figure Game Interview - Comics Feature at IGN | first=Richard | last=George | date=November 9, 2007 | publisher=IGN }}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
The Pokémon Trading Figure Game was designed by Tsunekaz Ishihara, a general producer for [[Pokémon]] and one of the designers of the [[Pokémon Trading Card Game|trading card game]], with Kouichi Ooyama and Mr. Masayuki Miura. They spent several years preparing the game's look and feel to ensure the best possible trading figure game. They aimed at maintaining the spirit of the Pokémon through all the properties, but realized there would be some differences. The figures are designed and created by [[Kaiyodo]], with help from the game designers.&lt;ref name="ign interview"/&gt;

==Gameplay==
Players take turns moving their Pokémon around the playmat, attempting to get one of their Pokémon on the opponent's Goal. If their Pokémon stops next to an opposing Pokémon, they can choose to battle. In a battle, both players spin their own figures, and the best result wins. A single game can take place on the 3-on-3 playmat or the 6-on-6 playmat. The quick 3-on-3 version lets players explore the basic strategies of the game while the 6-on-6 playmat offers a wider variety of tactics. A player can spin a trainer figure, to use a boost card.&lt;ref name="ign interview"/&gt;

==Next Quest set (International Release)==
The "Next Quest" set is made up of 42 figures and 8 cards. These pieces are divided into four levels of rarity: white star (extremely rare), black star (rare), black diamond (uncommon) and black circle (common).
There are also 2 subsets: the pearl sub-set, which contains all the rare figures and are a pearly colour, and the crystal subset are see through and contains all the EXrare figures. A ref figure is also found in the 9 figure set it would appear it is not part of the nextquest set however as it has the promo symbol underneath.

Two starter sets are available for this collection, entitled "Flamethrower" and "Riptide". Each starter set contains four figures, as well as the following:
*Double-sided play mat (for 3 vs 3 or 6 vs 6 figurine play).
*3 trainer cards (''Max Revive'', ''X Attack'', ''X Accuracy'', or ''Switch'').
*A full-color poster of the 42 figurines in the Next Quest set, with checklist boxes for collectors.
*A rule book.

There are also four different booster packs available; these do not have individual names but are identified by the four different images on each packaging: [[Pikachu]], [[Charizard]], [[Groudon]], and [[Feraligatr]].

==Next Quest set (US release)==
There are several differences between the International and US release.

===Packaging===
The US release offers two types of starter sets and three types of booster packs.  All retail packagings are made of printed cardboard and plastic clamshell.  The 1-figure booster pack has one visible figure-spot.  The 2-figure booster pack has one visible figure-spot, and one secret figure spot.  The 3-figure booster pack has two visible figure-spots, and one secret figure-spot.

The visible figure-spot in the 1-figure booster pack contains either Groudon, Kyogre, Pikachu, Absol, Torchic, or Mudkip.

The visible figure-spot in the 2-figure booster pack and one of the visible figure-spot in the 3-figure booster pack contain either Ho-Oh, Lugia, Eevee, Salamence, or Zangoose.  Scyther was later released as a visible figure in the Target-exclusive 3-figure booster pack.

The second visible figure-spot in the 3-figure booster pack originally contained the ''Pokémon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'' starters.  A Target-exclusive release of the 3-figure booster pack has the starters replaced by crystal variations of the other visible figures.

The secret figure-spots in the 2-figure and 3-figure booster packs contain one random non-promotional figure from the Next Quest set.  Red and Brendan trainer figures from the starter sets appear rarely in the secret figure-spot of the 3-figure booster packs.

===Figure Distribution===
The figures from the US release do not have figure rarity and rarity symbol.

===Packaging Contents===
The secret figure-spots from the US release booster packs always have one trainer card.  All figures from the US release are sold with the spinner base, and the color of the spinner base in the secret figure-spot matches the color of the base in the visible figure-spot of the same pack.

===Figure Construction===
Beedrill figure from the US release has an additional support rod connecting between the Beedrill figure and the figure base.

==Groundbreakers set==
"Groundbreakers" would have been the first expansion set for the Pokémon Trading Figure Game.  The expansion was to feature two starter sets, with one, "Skydive," seeing an early release in Wal-Mart stores in November 2008.  The other, "Whirlwind," also saw a retail release.  The full release of the set was delayed several times before the Pokémon Trading Figure Game was officially discontinued on June 2, 2009, leaving the set unreleased.

{{rape}}
After a [[sexual assault]] or [[rape]], victims are often subjected to [[scrutiny]] and, in some cases, [[Post-assault treatment of sexual assault victims#Post-assault social stigma, mistreatment and abuse|mistreatment]].  Victims undergo medical examinations and are interviewed by police.  If there is a criminal trial, victims suffer a loss of [[privacy]] and their [[credible witness|credibility]] may be challenged.  Victims may also become the target of [[slut-shaming]], abuse, [[social stigma]]tization, [[sexual slur]]s and [[cyberbullying]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Various laws have been created with a motive to protect victims.  During criminal proceedings, [[publication ban]]s and [[rape shield laws]] protect victims from excessive public scrutiny.  Laws may also prohibit defence lawyers from obtaining a victim's medical, psychiatric or therapeutic records.   [[Statutory rape]] laws set the age of legal consent for sexual activity and prohibits perpetrators from alleging the victim consented to the activity.  Victims in some jurisdictions can seek damages from police and institutions if warnings were not issued.  Numerous victims' rights groups operate to improve the treatment of victims.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

The [[Sexual Assault Survivors' Rights Act|Survivors' Bill of Rights Act of 2016]] was enacted by the United States federal government on October 7, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R.5578 - Survivors' Bill of Rights Act of 2016|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/5578/text?resultIndex=3|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=9 October 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act gives victims the right: 
* to request the preservation of sexual assault evidence collection kit or its probative contents.
* to have the sexual assault evidence collection kit preserved, without charge, for the duration of the maximum applicable statute of limitations or 20 years, whichever is shorter
* to be informed of any result of a sexual assault evidence collection kit, including a DNA profile match, toxicology report, or other information collected as part of a medical forensic examination, if such disclosure would not impede or compromise an ongoing investigation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R.5578 - Survivors' Bill of Rights Act of 2016|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/5578/text|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=9 October 2016|location=Chapter 238 - Section 3772|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interview by police===
As part of police investigations, victims are interviewed by police.  The interview is usually recorded, a transcript may be prepared and the interview may be made available to the public.  Discrepancies between the victim's statements to police and other evidence are grounds for the defence lawyer to [[witness impeachment|impeach]] the [[credible witness|credibility]] of the victim.

In investigations involving [[acquaintance rape|acquaintance]] or [[date rape]], the electronic communications between the accused and the victim may be reviewed in order to determine if the victim [[consent]]ed to the sexual activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Justice Zuker|title=R. v. Ururyar - Ontario Court of Justice|url=http://www.canlii.org/en/on/oncj/doc/2016/2016oncj448/2016oncj448.html?autocompleteStr=urur&amp;autocompletePos=1|website=www.Canlii.org|publisher=Ontario Court of Justice|accessdate=19 September 2016|location=Paragraphs 52 to 55|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[People v. Jovanovic]]'', the [[New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division|New York appeals court]] determined that emails from the alleged victim should be included in evidence and that the [[rape shield law]] did not apply.  The alleged victim had written about her sadomasochistic interests and experiences.

In Canada, a defense lawyer may be allowed to obtain copies of the victim's e-mails and other private documents using a legal procedure called a third-party records application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Sarah Boesveld|authorlink1=How did Ghomeshi's defence get hold of 5,000 messages between complainants?|url=http://www.chatelaine.com/news/how-did-ghomehis-defence-get-hold-of-5000-messages-between-complainants/|accessdate=19 September 2016|publisher=Chatelaine|title=How did Ghomeshi's defence get hold of 5,000 messages between complainants?|date=February 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If police believe the reported victim is making a [[false accusation of rape]], they may interrogate that person as a suspect rather than a victim.  In some cases, harsh questioning and social stigmatization has caused even actual victims of rape to recant and then be charged with making a false report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A False Report: A True Story of Rape in America |year=2018 |last=Miller |first=T. Christian |isbn= 978-1524759933}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confidentiality, harassment, smear campaigns and silencing===
{{See also|Nate Parker#1999 rape charges}}
In Canada, pursuant to sections 278.1 to 278.91 of the ''Criminal Code'' defence counsel are not allowed to obtain a victim's medical, psychiatric or therapeutic records .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Section 278.1 - Criminal Code of Canada|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-65.html#docCont|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=9 October 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The prohibition was found to be constitutional by the Supreme Court of Canada even though it limited the accused ability to provide a full answer and defence; see [[R v Mills|''R. v Mills'']].

An accused may hire a private investigator to investigate and harass a victim.  For example, according to the complaint in the civil lawsuit against Penn State University,  [[Nate Parker]] hired a private investigator to investigate and harass an 18-year-old student.  The student alleged she was raped by Parker and another student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Kate Briquelet|author2=M.L.

Institutions may attempt to cover up sexual abuse, as seen in the [[Catholic Church sexual abuse cases]]. The movie ''[[Spotlight (film)|Spotlight]]'' deals with the coverup of sexual abuse by Catholic priests.

[[Dennis Hastert]] allegedly promised to pay $5 million to his victim in exchange for agreeing not to discuss the sexual assaults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Christy Gutowski|title=Judge may rule whether lawsuit filed by Dennis Hastert victim can proceed|accessdate=|agency=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=October 14, 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus sexual assault victims==

In the United States, various legislation, government agencies, and initiatives have been created to deal with [[campus sexual assault]].  These include:

* [[White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault]]
* [[Title IX]] requires schools receiving federal funds to protect students from gender-based violence and harassment – including sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Title IX and Sexual Violence in Schools|url=https://www.aclu.org/title-ix-and-sexual-violence-schools?redirect=womens-rights/title-ix-and-sexual-violence-schools|publisher=American Civil Liberties Union|accessdate=12 October 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Office for Civil Rights]]  investigates [[Title IX]] sexual violence complaints.
* The [[Campus Accountability and Safety Act]] (CASA) is a United States bill to reform the sexual assault investigation process and protect victims.  CASA includes a requirement that colleges and universities publish statistics relating to crime on their campuses.
* The [[Safe Campus Act]] is proposed U.S. legislation that would require schools to report allegations of sexual assault to law enforcement, but only if the victim consents.  However, if the victim does not consent the statute prohibits schools from initiating their own internal disciplinary procedures.

''[[The Hunting Ground]]'' is a critically acclaimed American documentary film about the incidence of sexual assault on college campuses in the United States.  Its creators say college administrations are failing to respond adequately to claims of sexual assault, while its critics have countered that the film was based on misleading statistics and biased against the alleged perpetrator.

==Sexual assault victims in the military==
Sexual Assault in the military is more prevalent than outside of the military and it is frequently under reported. In the United States, [[Sexual Assault Prevention Response]] (SAPR) is a training program designated to educate military service members and provide support and treatment to service members and their families.  Individuals are assigned to a SAPR Advocate to assist them with the different treatment options that are available to them and to educate them about their rights.

==Sexual assault of prisoners==

The [[Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003|''Prison Rape Elimination Act'']] is United States legislation enacted for the purpose of preventing sexual assaults in U.S. prisons.  The legislation requires reporting and information gathering.

{{Main|Prison rape in the United States}}

==Publication bans, duty to warn and self-censorship==

===Publication of victim's name and publication bans===
{{Main|Publication ban}}

In the United States, laws prohibiting the publication of a victim's name have been found to be unconstitutional and struck down.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncjrs.gov/ovc_archives/directions/chap13.htm New Directions from the Field: Victims Rights and Services for the 21st Century] (Chapter 13), accessed October 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''[[Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn]]''  {{ussc|420|469|1975}}, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled a Georgia statute that imposed civil liability on media for publishing a rape victim's name was unconstitutional.  The Court stated: "the First and Fourteenth Amendments command nothing less than that the States may not impose sanctions on the publication of truthful information contained in official court records open to public inspection."  Also see ''[[Florida Star v. B. J. F.]]'', {{ussc|491|524|1989}} and ''State of Florida v. Globe Communications Corp.'', 648 So.2d 110 (Fla. 1994).

In Canada, the [[Canadian Press]] generally does not publish the names of alleged sexual assault victims without their consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Alleged victim in Quebec politician sex assault case speaks|url=http://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/politics/alleged-victim-in-quebec-politician-sex-assault-speaks/ar-AAjeZaj?li=AAggFp5&amp;ocid=mailsignout|accessdate=22 October 2016|agency=The Canadian Press|date=October 21, 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, a court order may operate to prohibit publication.  Pursuant to paragraph 486.4(1)(a) of the ''[[Criminal Code]]'', the court may make an order "directing that any information that could identify the complainant or a witness" not be published, broadcast or transmitted for any sexual offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paragraph 486.4 of Criminal Code of Canada|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-106.html#docCont|website=Department of Justice (Canada)|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=21 September 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The victim has the option of waiving the [[publication ban]].

===Victim may be prohibited from discussing the assault===

In cases where the accused is under 18 years of age, the court may impose a [[publication ban]] to protect the privacy of the offender.

Seventeen-year-old [[Sexual assault of Savannah Dietrich|Savannah Dietrich]] was sexually assaulted by two teenagers.  The court ordered Dietrich not to discuss the case and she was threatened to be found in [[contempt of court|contempt]] when she published the names of the perpetrators on social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Plait |first=Phil |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2012/07/23/savannah_dietrich_outs_her_rapists_on_twitter_and_facebook.html |title=Savannah Dietrich outs her rapists on Twitter and Facebook |publisher=Slate.com |date=2012-07-23 |accessdate=2013-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, the section 110 of the  ''[[Youth Criminal Justice Act]]'' generally prohibits the publication of the name of the offender if the offender was under the age of 18 at the time of the offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Youth Criminal Justice Act|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/y-1.5/page-21.html#h-33|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=29 October 2016|page=Section 110|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{see also|Youth Criminal Justice Act#Privacy}}

===Duty to warn the public===
{{Main|Duty to warn#Criminal Activity and Sexual Assault}}

The police, colleges and universities may be required to warn the public that a sexual assault has occurred.  Women should be warned of the risk they face and have the opportunity to take any specific measures to protect themselves from future attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Justice Macfarland|title=Doe v. Metropolitan Toronto (Municipality) Commissioners of Police, 1998 CanLII 14826 (ON SC)|url=http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/1998/1998canlii14826/1998canlii14826.html?autocompleteStr=jane%20doe&amp;autocompletePos=2|publisher=Ontario Court (General Division)|accessdate=18 October 2016|language=English|date=July 3, 1998|quote=Ms. Doe brings a suit against the Metropolitan Toronto Police Force (hereafter referred to as MTPF) on two bases; firstly she suggests that the MTPF conducted a negligent investigation in relation to the balcony rapist and failed to warn women whom they knew to be potential targets of Callow of the fact that they were at risk. She says, as the result of such conduct, Callow was not apprehended as early as he might otherwise have been and she was denied the opportunity, had she known the risk she faced, to take any specific measures to protect herself from attack.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victims of sexual assault may sue for damages if warnings are not issued.  In 1998, a sexual assault victim successfully sued the Toronto police for their failure to warn her that a serial rapist was active in her neighbourhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jane Doe v.

In the United States, the [[Clery Act]] imposes fines on colleges and universities that fail to warn students of criminal activity on or near campuses.  The law is named after Jeanne Clery, a 19-year-old Lehigh University student who was raped and murdered in her campus hall of residence in 1986.  In relation to the [[Jerry Sandusky]] sexual abuse scandal, U.S. federal investigators are seeking to fine Penn State University $2.4 million for failing to warn of threats to the campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Nick Anderson|title=Feds seek record $2.4 million fine against Penn State in Sandusky scandal|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/feds-seek-record-24-million-fine-against-penn-state-in-sandusky-scandal/2016/11/03/7fbe7bf8-a1cd-11e6-8832-23a007c77bb4_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-more-top-stories_pennstate-250pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory|accessdate=4 November 2016|agency=Washington Post|date=November 3, 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Censorship by travel websites===
[[TripAdvisor]] apologized for repeatedly deleting forum posts about a resort where the victim had been raped by a security guard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Karen Schwartz|title=TripAdvisor to flag hotels where sexual assault occurred|url=https://www.thestar.com/business/2017/11/09/tripadvisor-to-indicate-hotels-where-sexual-assault-occurred.html|publisher=Toronto Star|accessdate=10 November 2017|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-censorship  ===
Self-censorship is when publications or people self-censor themselves in order to withhold information to protect their image or avoid receiving backlash. Some instances include:

* '''Self-censorship because subject is distasteful''' – Newspapers may [[self-censor]], choosing not to publish material about a sexual assault on the grounds that the subject is distasteful.  For example, there were complaints when [[The Des Moines Register]]  published stories about the rape of [[Taking Back My Life: The Nancy Ziegenmeyer Story|Nancy Ziegenmeyer]].  One reader complained: 
::The disgusting and degrading details of Nancy Ziegenmeyer's rape have no place in a family newspaper the caliber of The Register.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|author1=David Margolick|title=A Name, a Face and a Rape: Iowa Victim Tells Her Story|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/25/us/a-name-a-face-and-a-rape-iowa-victim-tells-her-story.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=13 February 2017|agency=New York Times|date=March 25, 1990|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Self-censorship because of ethnicity of the accused''' – Publication of information regarding sexual assaults may be suppressed because of fears of being thought racist.&lt;ref name="BBC News Online"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Katie Hall|title=Real or imagined: Racism 'fear' over Rotherham child abuse|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-28951612|publisher=BBC News Online|accessdate=9 October 2016|language=English|date=August 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2006 report regarding the child sexual assaults in Rotherham, England stated: "It is believed by a number of workers that one of the difficulties that prevent this issue [child sexual exploitation] being dealt with effectively is the ethnicity of the main perpetrators."&lt;ref name="BBC News Online"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Alexis Jay OBE|title=Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Exploitation in Rotherham (1997 – 2013)|url=http://www.rotherham.gov.uk/downloads/file/1407/independent_inquiry_cse_in_rotherham|publisher=Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council|accessdate=9 October 2016|pages=2|language=English|quote=By far the majority of perpetrators were described as 'Asian' by victims, yet throughout the entire period, councillors did not engage directly with the Pakistani-heritage community to discuss how best they could jointly address the issue. Some councillors seemed to think it was a one-off problem, which they hoped would go away. Several staff described their nervousness about identifying the ethnic origins of perpetrators for fear of being thought racist; others remembered clear direction from their managers not to do so.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Main|Rotherham child sexual exploitation scandal#Reactions}}

: With respect to the [[Rochdale child sex abuse ring]], it was suggested that police and social work departments failed to act when details of the gang emerged for fear of appearing racist, and vulnerable white teenagers being groomed by Pakistani men were ignored.

* '''Self-censorship because "women would become hysterical"''' – In 1998, the Toronto police did not issue warnings regarding a serial rapist "because women would become hysterical or panic" and "the rapist would flee and the investigation would be compromised".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Justice MacFarland|title=Doe v.

* '''Self-censorship to avoid deportation and intimidation using "rape trees"''' – Sexual assaults of illegal immigrants are rarely reported as the victims fear they may be deported after coming forward.  Women often seek out birth control methods to prevent pregnancy from anticipated sexual assaults.&lt;ref name="pbs1"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/facing-risk-rape-migrant-women-prepare-birth-control/ | publisher=[[PBS]]| title=Women crossing the U.S. border face sexual assault with little protection | date=31 March 2014 | agency=Fronteras | accessdate=4 July 2015 | last1=Joffe-Block | first1=Jude}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: [[Rape tree]]s are trees or bushes that mark where [[sexual assault]]s have occurred by arranging the victim's undergarments on or around the trees branches or on the ground.&lt;ref name=usnews1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fox|first1=Lauren|title=The Watch|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/07/05/in-south-texas-ranchers-increasingly-fearful-of-immigration|magazine=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Rape trees" are commonly and increasingly found along the [[United States]] and [[Mexico]] border.&lt;ref name=latina1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rosario|first1=Marielo|title="Rape Trees" Found Along Southern US Border|url=http://www.latina.com/lifestyle/news-politics/rape-trees-found-along-southern-us-border|website=[[Latina (magazine)|Latina]]|publisher=LATINA MEDIA VENTURES|accessdate=7 July 2014|date=March 11, 2009|quote='Rape trees' are popping up in Southern Arizona and their significance is horrific.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ST1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wilkinson|first1=Tracy|title=Central American migrants on word-of-mouth exodus to U.S.|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/nationworld/2023988528_migrantstripxml.html?syndication=rss|website=seattletimes.com|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=7 July 2014|date=July 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rape trees serve to intimidate illegal immigrants by suggesting the perpetrators are able to commit acts of violence with impunity.

==Financial costs==
Victims may incur various financial costs because of the sexual assault; for example, costs related to moving (to get away from the perpetrator), a new mattress, legal fees, lost wages, lost tuition fees, new clothing, therapy and medication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Court to hear appeal in Mandi Gray sex assault case|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/crime/2017/03/13/court-to-hear-appeal-in-mandi-gray-sex-assault-case.html|accessdate=14 March 2017|agency=Toronto Star|date=March 14, 2017|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conduct of legal proceedings==
{{Main|Laws regarding rape}}

===Statutes of limitations===
A [[statute of limitations]] law may preclude a victim from pressing criminal charges.  Limitations periods vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.  For example, in Pennsylvania charges must be filed within 12 years of the assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Sydney Ember|author2=Graham Bowley|title=After Bill Cosby, States Shift on Statutes of Limitations in Sexual Assault Cases|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/07/arts/television/after-bill-cosby-states-shift-sexual-assault-statutes-of-limitations.html|accessdate=7 November 2016|agency=New York Times|publisher=New York Times|date=November 7, 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statutory rape===
[[Statutory rape]] is sexual activity in which one of the individuals is below the [[age of consent]].  The age of consent is the age at which a young person is capable of [[consent]]ing to sexual activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Queen v. Omar Abdallah Hajar|url=http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abca/doc/2016/2016abca222/2016abca222.html?searchUrlHash=AAAAAQAPImFnZSBvZiBjb25zZW50AAAAAAE&amp;resultIndex=7|publisher=Alberta Court of Appeal|accessdate=18 November 2016|location=Para. 30|language=English|date=July 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These laws were enacted to recognize the inherent power imbalance between adults and children and that children are incapable of giving true consent to sexual acts with adults.  The laws protect children from undue influence, persuasion and manipulation.

In 2016, the Government of Turkey proposed legislation that would overturn a man conviction for child sex assault if they married their victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=AFP in Turkey|title=Turkish bill to clear men of child sex assault if they marry their victims|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/18/turkish-bill-to-clear-men-of-child-sex-assault-if-the-
marry-their-victims|accessdate=19 November 2016|agency=The Guardian|date=November 16, 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consent===
Defence counsel may argue the victim consented to the sexual activity.  Determining if the victim consented can be problematic when the victim is intoxicated.  A [[Nova Scotia]] court found there was no sexual assault because the prosecution could not prove the sexual activity was non-consensual.  In that case, the sexual activity occurred in the back of a taxi cab between a taxi driver and an intoxicated customer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Michael Gorman|title=Crown appeals acquittal in taxi sex assault case where judge said 'drunk can consent'|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/sex-assault-taxi-drunk-1.4013364|accessdate=7 March 2017|agency=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=March 7, 2017|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Cindy Gladue bled to death from an 11-centimetre cut in her vagina.  At trial, the accused said Ms. Gladue died after a night of consensual, rough sex in an Edmonton motel.  He was acquitted.  The case is being appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Chris Purdy |title=Supreme Court to hear questions in case of Ontario trucker acquitted in death of Edmonton woman |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/supreme-court-cindy-gladue-sexual-assault-1.4855218 |accessdate=13 October 2018 |agency=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=October 9, 2018 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Rape shield laws===
In Australia,&lt;ref&gt;Australian Government: ALRC: [http://www.alrc.gov.au/publications/20.%20Matters%20Outside%20the%20Uniform%20Evidence%20Acts/rape-shield-laws 20. Matters Outside the Uniform Evidence Acts - Rape shield laws]&lt;/ref&gt; Canada and the United States, the prior sexual history of the victim is generally not admissible as evidence during a criminal proceeding.  These laws are referred to as [[rape shield laws]].

In Canada, the constitutionality of the [[rape shield law]] was challenged on the grounds that it hampers a defendant's ability to present a defence.  The law was found to be constitutional by the Supreme Court of Canada: see ''[[R v Darrach]]''.

===Victim representation===
In Canadian criminal proceedings, the Crown prosecutor does not act on behalf of the victim and is not the victim's lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Victim's Guide to the Canadian Criminal Justice System: Questions and Answers|url=https://www.crcvc.ca/docs/A_Victims_Guide_to_the_Canadian_CJS_07.pdf|publisher=Canadian Resource Centre for Victims of Crime|accessdate=19 September 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''29. Who represents the victim during the trial? Should I get a lawyer to ensure that my rights are met during the trial?'''&lt;br /&gt;
Crown counsel is not and can never function as the victim's lawyer. Although the Crown appears to be representing the interests of the victim, the Crown is the lawyer for the Queen and the government during the trial. In Canadian criminal cases, the harm is perceived to have been committed against the State. This is why cases are referred to as Regina v. Smith (or R. v. Smith), Regina being the Queen in Latin. The Crown is truly representing the society, of which you are a part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Victim's Guide to the Canadian Criminal Justice System: Questions and Answers|url=https://www.crcvc.ca/docs/A_Victims_Guide_to_the_Canadian_CJS_07.pdf|publisher=Canadian Resource Centre for Victims of Crime|accessdate=19 September 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Other===
Sexual assault cases commonly involve multiple complainants.  In these cases, the defence is likely to apply for separate trials for each offence.
[[Joinder]] of multiple counts is only permitted in certain circumstances.

The decision to have separate trials is discretionary and is exercised in order to prevent prejudice to the defendant.  The threshold question for holding a joint trial is whether or not each complainant's evidence will be admissible in respect of the charges involving the other complainants (that is, whether such evidence is 'cross-admissible'). Decisions to hold separate trials or refuse to admit relevant tendency or propensity evidence about a defendant's sexual behaviour can be seen as barriers to the successful prosecution of sex offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Family Violence—A National Legal Response|url=https://www.alrc.gov.au/publications/26.%20Reporting%2C%20Prosecution%20and%20Pre-trial%20Processes/joint-or-separate-trial|publisher=Government of Australia - Law Reform Commission|accessdate=19 September 2016|location=Section 26 - Joint or separate trial|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sexual assault charges against [[Jian Ghomeshi]] involved multiple complainants and were dealt with in two separate proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Mark Gollom|title=Jian Ghomeshi found not guilty on choking and all sex assault charges|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/jian-ghomeshi-sexual-assault-trial-ruling-1.3505446|accessdate=29 October 2016|agency=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=March 24, 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second trial did not proceed after Ghomeshi agreed to issue an apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CBC apologizes to Kathryn Borel over handling of Jian Ghomeshi complaint|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/cbc-apology-kathryn-borel-ghomeshi-peace-bond-1.3577223|accessdate=29 October 2016|agency=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=May 11, 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A victim of sexual assault may be subjected to speculative allegations of wrongdoing during [[cross-examination]].  For example, in ''R. v. Sofyan Boalag''&lt;ref name="R. v Sofyan Boalag"&gt;{{cite web|title=R. v Sofyan Boalag|url=http://www.canlii.org/en/nl/nlpc/doc/2016/2016nlpc113/2016nlpc113.html?resultIndex=3|website=www.Canlii.org|publisher=Provincial Court of Newfoundland and Labrador|accessdate=19 September 2016|location=Paragraph 105|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; the defence lawyer asserted during the cross-examination that the victim was in fact asking for money in exchange for sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Rosie Mullaley|title='This man raped me'|url=http://www.thetelegram.com/News/Local/2016-06-13/article-4557844/%26lsquo%3BThis-man-raped-me%26rsquo%3B/1|accessdate=18 September 2016|publisher=The Telegram|date=June 13, 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In that case, the accused was convicted of 13 criminal offences involving six victims including multiple sexual assaults at knife point.&lt;ref name="R. v Sofyan Boalag"/&gt;

A victim's alcohol consumption at the time of the assault may undermine the victim's ability to remember the assault and his or her ability to provide credible [[testimony]].  As noted by Justice Zuker of the Ontario Court of Justice: &lt;blockquote&gt;[414] What makes someone a perfect target in the context of alcohol-facilitated sexual assaults may make that person a poor witness in any ensuing proceedings due to his or her inability to remember part or all of what happened.  
[415] One of the more challenging (and ever-present) issues to evaluate in sexual assault is the question of [[consent]]. Sexual assaults may involve alcohol consumption by one or both parties. Frequently, parties to an incident will have limited or no memory of the events in question, and the court will be required to obtain and evaluate information provided by other witnesses or other corroborating evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=R. v. Ururyar - Ontario Court of Justice 2016 448|url=http://www.canlii.org/en/on/oncj/doc/2016/2016oncj448/2016oncj448.html?autocompleteStr=urur&amp;autocompletePos=1|website=www.Canlii.org|publisher=Ontario Superior Court of Justice|accessdate=20 September 2016|location=Paragraphs 414 and 415}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During cross examination a victim's attire may be scrutinized and they may be accused of wearing revealing clothing.  For example, a Toronto woman, who alleged she was sexually assaulted by three police officers after a party, was asked about her choice of wearing a top described as "really low cut with open sleeves" to a party mostly attended by "young men ... who would be drinking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Trevor Dunn|title=Complainant denies defence's claim she wanted sex with Toronto officers accused of assaulting her|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/trial-tps-cross-examination-1.4151926|accessdate=9 June 2017|agency=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=June 8, 2017|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[cross-examination]], a victim's criminal record may be noted in order to [[witness impeachment|impeach]] their [[Credible witness|credibility]]. This tactic was unsuccessfully used in the trial of [[Daniel Holtzclaw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jury convicts ex-Oklahoma cop Daniel Holtzclaw of rape, sodomy charges; faces life in prison|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/jury-convicts-ex-oklahoma-rape-charges-article-1.2462256|accessdate=10 October 2016|agency=Daily News|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-assault social stigma, mistreatment and abuse==
Victims of sexual assault are often subjected to [[social stigma]]. The victim may be subject to inappropriate post-assault behaviour or language by medical personnel or other organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Campbell R, Raja S |title=Secondary victimization of rape victims: insights from mental health professionals who treat survivors of violence |journal=Violence Vict |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=261–75 |year=1999 |pmid=10606433 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Slut-shaming]] is the practice of [[victim blaming|blaming the victim]] for [[rape]] and other forms of [[sexual assault]].  It rests on the idea that sexual assault is caused (either in part or in full) by the woman wearing revealing clothing or acting in a sexually provocative manner, before refusing consent to sex,&lt;ref name="asking"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McCormack |first1=Clare |last2=Prostran |first2=Nevena |title=Asking for it: a first-hand account from slutwalk |journal=[[International Feminist Journal of Politics]] |year=2012 |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=410–414 |doi=10.1080/14616742.2012.699777 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14616742.2012.699777 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and thereby absolving the perpetrator of guilt.

The [[SlutWalk]] challenges the idea of explaining or excusing rape by referring to any aspect of a woman's appearance.  The [[SlutWalk]] was created in response to comments by a Toronto Police officer who said: "I've been told I'm not supposed to say this – however, women should avoid dressing like [[sluts]] in order not to be victimized."&lt;ref name="asking"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McCormack |first1=Clare |last2=Prostran |first2=Nevena |title=Asking for it: a first-hand account from slutwalk |journal=[[International Feminist Journal of Politics]] |year=2012 |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=410–414 |doi=10.1080/14616742.2012.699777 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14616742.2012.699777 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thestar1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/article/940665--cop-apologizes-for-sluts-remark-at-law-school |title=Cop apologizes for 'sluts' remark at law school |work=Toronto Star |date=February 18, 2011 |accessdate=May 29, 2011 |location=Toronto |first=Curtis |last=Rush}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Indian politicians suggested that women's clothing choices could invite sexual assault.   The comments were made after a number of women were molested at a New Year's Eve party in [[Bangalore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Amy Wang|title=Indian politicians cause outrage after blaming alleged groping on women's 'Western' clothes|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/01/04/indian-politicians-cause-outrage-after-blaming-alleged-groping-on-womens-western-clothes/?hpid=hp_no-name_hp-in-the-news%3Apage%2Fin-the-news|accessdate=4 January 2017|agency=Washington Post|date=January 4, 2017|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the U.S. television program ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'', [[Joy Behar]] referred to [[Bill Clinton sexual misconduct allegations|Bill Clinton's sexual assault accusers]] as "[[Tramp#Tramp as promiscuous woman|tramps]]". Behar apologized for the [[sexual slur]] shortly afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=October 10, 2016 Episode of The View|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLXxWH_DiEY|website=Youtube.com|accessdate=13 October 2016|pages=21:04 Minutes:Seconds and 22:00|language=English|date=October 10, 2016|quote="tramps"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The View host Joy Behar apologises for calling Bill Clinton accusers "tramps" on TV after sparking backlash|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/view-host-joy-behar-apologises-9024867|accessdate=12 October 2016|agency=Mirror (UK)|date=October 12, 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Joy Behar sorry for calling Bill Clinton accusers 'tramps' on 'The View'|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2016/10/11/joy-behar-calls-bill-clinton-accusers-tramps-on-view.html|accessdate=12 October 2016|publisher=FoxNews.com|date=October 11, 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=October 11, 2016 Episode - The View|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3xK0ub1UkI|website=YouTube|accessdate=13 October 2016|pages=0:36 Minutes:Seconds|language=English|date=October 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual assault victims may stay away from work in order to avoid contact with the perpetrator.   For example, Caroline Lamarre, an office worker who was sexually assaulted at work, has not returned to work in order to avoid contact with her assailant.  The assailant was convicted of sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Convicted of sexual assault, Quebec mayor still presides while victim 'becomes the villain'|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/victim-becomes-the-villain-sexually-assaulted-by-quebec-mayor-woman-is-out-of-work-while-he-continues-to-preside|accessdate=28 February 2017|publisher=National Post|date=February 28, 2017|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victims of sexual assault may be subjected to [[cyberbullying]], as in the case of the [[suicide of Audrie Pott]], [[suicide of Rehtaeh Parsons]] and [[sexual assault of Savannah Dietrich]].

The [[Netflix]] documentary ''[[Audrie &amp; Daisy]]'' is about two American high school students who were sexually assaulted by other students.  At the time they were assaulted, [[Audrie Pott]] was 15 and [[Daisy Coleman]] was 14 years old.  After the assaults, the victims and their families were subjected to abuse and [[cyberbullying]].

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Nosheen Iqbal|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/sep/19/audrie-and-daisy-high-school-sexual-assault-netflix-shame-bullying-teenagers-online|accessdate=19 September 2016|publisher=The Guardian|date=September 19, 2016|title=Audrie and Daisy: an unflinching account of high-school sexual assault|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movie ''[[Taking Back My Life: The Nancy Ziegenmeyer Story]]'' is the true story of Nancy Ziegenmeyer, an Iowa resident who was raped in 1991.  Her story was groundbreaking because she spoke openly about her experiences including her interactions with hospital staff, the police, prosecutors, the accused, and the criminal justice system.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chicago Tribune"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Catharine Reeve|title=Taking Back Her Life - Public Disclosure Helps One Victim Of Rape Become A Survivor|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-02-23/features/9201170624_1_nancy-ziegenmeyer-parking-lot-grabbed/2|accessdate=13 February 2017|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=February 23, 1992|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Des Moines Register won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Public Service]] in 1991 for publishing the story of Nancy Ziegenmeyer's sexual assault.  At the time the article was published it was unusual to publish the victim's name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 1991 Pulitzer Prize Winner in Public Service|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/winners/des-moines-register|website=Pulitzer.ort|accessdate=29 March 2017|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ziegenmeyer wrote a book, ''Taking Back My Life'', to encourage women to seek help after they've been victimized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nancy Ziegenmeyer Interview|url=https://charlierose.com/videos/9927|website=CharlieRose.com|accessdate=29 March 2017|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cultures, rape victims are at very high risk of suffering additional violence or threats of violence after the rape. These acts may be perpetrated by the rapist or by friends and relatives of the rapist as a way of preventing the victims from reporting the rape, of punishing them for reporting it, or of forcing them to withdraw the complaint.  In addition, the relatives of the victim may threaten the victim as a punishment for "bringing shame" to the family. This is especially the case in cultures where female [[virginity]] is highly valued and considered mandatory before marriage; in extreme cases, rape victims are killed in [[honor killings]].&lt;ref name="zeenews.india"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/uttar-pradesh/rape-victim-threatened-to-withdraw-case-in-up_694364.html |title=Rape victim threatened to withdraw case in UP |publisher=Zeenews.india.com |date=2011-03-19 |accessdate=2013-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wisemuslimwomen"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wisemuslimwomen.org/currentissues/stigmitizationofrape/ |title=Stigmatization of Rape &amp; Honor Killings |publisher=WISE Muslim Women |date=2002-01-31 |accessdate=2013-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108041415/http://www.wisemuslimwomen.org/currentissues/stigmitizationofrape/ |archivedate=2012-11-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|last=Harter |first=Pascale |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13760895 |title=BBC News - Libya rape victims 'face honour killings' |publisher=BBC News |date=2011-06-14|accessdate=2013-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries, girls and women who are raped are forced by their families to marry their rapist.  A [[arranged marriage|marriage is arranged]] because victims are deemed to have their "reputation" tarnished.  There is extreme [[social stigma]] related to being the victim of rape and the loss of [[virginity]].  Marriage is claimed to be advantageous for both the victim—who does not remain unmarried and doesn't lose social status—and of the rapist, who avoids punishment.

In 2012, the [[Suicide of Amina Filali|suicide of a 16-year-old Moroccan girl]]—who, after having been forced by her family to marry her rapist at the suggestion of the prosecutor, and who subsequently endured abuse by the rapist after they married—sparked protests from activists against the law which allows the rapist to marry the victim in order to escape criminal sanctions, and against this social practice which is common in Morocco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-17379721 |title=BBC News&amp;nbsp;— Morocco protest after raped Amina Filali kills herself |publisher=BBC News |date=2012-03-15 |accessdate=2013-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the government of [[Turkey]] introduced legislation which would overturn a man's conviction for child sex assault if he married his victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fury at Turkish bill to clear men of child sex assault if they marry victims|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/18/turkish-bill-to-clear-men-of-child-sex-assault-if-the-marry-their-victims|accessdate=27 December 2016|agency=The Guardian|date=November 22, 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Victim support==
Victims often receive support from the community and other victims.  For example, when [[Taking Back My Life: The Nancy Ziegenmeyer Story|Nancy Ziegenmeyer]] went public regarding her experience, "she was inundated with letters and phone calls of support, thanks and praise for her courage in going public. Many of the letters were from women who had been raped and had lived with their secrets, often telling no one, often blaming themselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Catharine Reeve|title=Taking Back Her Life - Public Disclosure Helps One Victim Of Rape Become A Survivor|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-02-23/features/9201170624_1_nancy-ziegenmeyer-parking-lot-grabbed/3|accessdate=13 February 2017|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=February 23, 1992|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Victims' rights==
{{Main|Victims' rights}}

In the United Kingdom, the ''[[Giving Victims a Voice]]'' report was published in response to allegations of sexual abuse made against English DJ and BBC Television presenter [[Jimmy Savile]].  The Director of Public Prosecutions described the report as marking a "watershed moment" and apologised for "shortcomings" in the handling of prior abuse claims. The report's publication resulted in some highlighting what could be systemic failure because of the number of complainants and institutions identified, but others criticised it for treating allegations as facts.

In the United States, the [[Crime Victims' Rights Act]] grants rights to victims including the right to be reasonably protected from the accused.  Similarly, in Canada the ''Canadian Victims Bill of Rights'' provides rights to victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canadian Victims Bill of Rights|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-23.7/index.html|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=30 October 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are victims' rights groups. [[Rise (non-governmental organization)|Rise]] is an NGO working to implement a bill of rights for sexual assault victims. The [[Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network]] (RAINN) is an American group which carries out programs to prevent sexual assault, help victims, and to ensure that rapists are brought to justice. The [[Victim Rights Law Center]] is an American non-profit organization that provides free legal services to victims of [[rape]] and [[sexual assault]]. In the United States, the [[Office on Violence Against Women]] works to administer justice and strengthen services for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. In South Africa, People Opposing Women Abuse (POWA) is a women's rights organisation that provides services and engages in advocacy to promote women's rights and improve women's quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=People Opposing Women Abuse website|url=http://www.powa.co.za/POWA/about-us/|accessdate=13 November 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Medieval pig slaughter.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Medieval pig stunning using a mallet]]
'''Stunning''' is the process of rendering animals immobile or unconscious, with or without killing the animal, when or immediately prior to [[Animal slaughter|slaughtering]] them for food.

== Rationale ==
Within the [[European Union]], most animals slaughtered for human consumption are killed by cutting major [[blood vessel]]s in the [[neck]] or [[thorax]] so that rapid blood loss occurs. After a certain degree of blood loss has occurred, the animal will become unconscious, and after a greater blood loss [[death]] will ensue. From the moment of cutting until the loss of consciousness, the animal can experience [[pain]], [[Stress (biology)|stress]] and [[fear]]. Without stunning, the time between cutting through the major blood vessels and insensibility, as deduced from behavioural and [[brain]] response, is up to 20 seconds in [[sheep]], up to 25 seconds in [[pig]]s, up to 2 minutes in [[cattle]], up to 2.5 or more minutes in [[poultry]], and sometimes 15 minutes or more in [[fish]]. If one wants to minimise animal suffering during slaughter, stunning is required. The best stunning method depends on the species of animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Blokhuis |first=et al. |date=15 June 2004 |title=Opinion of the Scientific Panel on Animal Health and Welfare on a request from the Commission related to welfare aspects of the main systems of stunning and killing the main commercial species of animals |url=https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.2903/j.efsa.2004.45 |journal=The EFSA Journal |publisher=[[European Food Safety Authority]] |volume=45 |issue= |pages=1–29 |accessdate=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Richardson's_abattoir.jpg|thumb|right|Blueprint for a humane [[slaughterhouse]] designed by [[Benjamin Ward Richardson]], published 1908.]]
A primitive form of stunning was used in premodern times in the case of [[cattle]], which were [[Pollaxe_(Polearm)#Popular usage|poleaxed]] prior to being bled out. However, prior to [[humane slaughter]] pistols and electric stunners, [[pig]]s, [[sheep]] and other animals (including cattle) were simply struck while fully conscious.

The belief that this was unnecessarily cruel and painful to the animal being slaughtered eventually led to the compulsory adoption of stunning methods in many countries. One of the first campaigners on the matter was the eminent physician, [[Benjamin Ward Richardson]], who spent many years of his later working life developing more humane methods of slaughter. As early as 1853, he designed a lethal chamber that would gas animals to death relatively painlessly, and he founded the Model Abattoir Society in 1882 to investigate and campaign for humane methods of slaughter. He even experimented with the use of electric current at the [[Royal Polytechnic Institution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{DNBSupp|wstitle=Richardson, Benjamin Ward|first=D'Arcy|last= Power}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cattle Market- Everyday Life at Cattle Markets in Kent, England, UK, 1944 D22206.jpg|thumb|left|200x200px|Sheep at [[Maidstone]] cattle market, [[Kent]], 1944]]
The development of stunning technologies occurred largely in the first half of the twentieth century. In 1911, the [[Humane Slaughter Association|Council of Justice to Animals]] (later the Humane Slaughter Association) was created to improve the slaughter of livestock and address the killing of unwanted pets.&lt;ref name=HSANewsletterMarch2011&gt;{{cite web|title=Humane Slaughter Association Newsletter March 2011|url=http://www.hsa.org.uk/downloads/annual-reports-and-newsletters/News%202011.pdf|website=Humane Slaughter Association|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1920s, the HSA introduced and demonstrated a mechanical stunner, which led to the adoption of humane stunning by many local authorities."&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the HSA|url=http://www.hsa.org.uk/about/history-of-the-hsa|website=Humane Slaughter Association|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The HSA played a key role in the passage of the Slaughter of Animals Act 1933. This made the mechanical stunning of cows and electrical stunning of pigs compulsory, with the exception of [[Shechita|Jewish]] and [[Dhabihah|Muslim meat]].&lt;ref name=History /&gt; Modern methods, such as the [[captive bolt pistol]] and electric tongs were required and the Act's wording specifically outlawed the [[poleaxe]]. The period was marked by the development of various innovations in slaughterhouse technologies, not all of them particularly long-lasting.

== Modern methods ==
In modern slaughterhouses a variety of stunning methods are used on livestock. Methods include:
*Electrical stunning
*Gas stunning
*Percussive stunning

===Electrical stunning===
{{main|electronarcosis}}
Electrical stunning is done by sending an electric current through the [[brain]] and/or [[heart]] of the animal before slaughter. Current passing through the brain induces an immediate but non-fatal general [[convulsion]] that produces [[unconsciousness]]. Current passing through the heart produces an immediate [[cardiac arrest]] that also leads shortly to unconsciousness and death. It is a controversial subject however. With chickens for example, overstunning leads to bone fractures and/or electrocution which prevents bleeding of the animal. This negatively affects the quality of the meat, and therefore understunning is an attractive practice for slaughterhouses.

In the [[Netherlands]], for example, the law states that poultry must be stunned for 4 seconds minimum with an average current of 100 mA, which leads to systematic understunning.

The [[Crustastun|CrustaStun]] is a device designed to administer a lethal electric shock to [[shellfish]] (such as [[lobsters]], [[crabs]], and [[crayfish]]) before cooking.  This avoids boiling a live shellfish which may be able to experience [[Pain in crustaceans|pain]] in a way similar to vertebrates.  The device works by applying a 110 [[volt]], 2–5 [[Ampere|amp]] electrical charge to the animal. It is reported the CrustaStun renders the shellfish unconscious in 0.3 seconds and kills the animal in 5 to 10 seconds, compared to 3 minutes to kill a lobster by boiling or 4.5 minutes for a crab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/news/ill-have-my-lobster-electrocuted-please-1824925.html|title=I'll have my lobster electrocuted, please|author=McSmith, A.|publisher=The Independent (Newspaper)|accessdate=June 14, 2013|location=London|date=November 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1324142/CrustaStun-The-humane-gadget-kills-lobsters-single-jolt-electricity.html|title=CrustaStun: The 'humane' gadget that kills lobsters with a single jolt of electricity|author=Anon.|publisher=MailOnline (Newspaper)|accessdate=June 14, 2013|location=London|date=October 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gas stunning===
{{See also|Controlled-atmosphere killing}}
With gas stunning animals are exposed to a mixture of breathing gases ([[carbon dioxide]] for example, but historically [[carbon monoxide]] was used) that produce unconsciousness or death through [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] or [[asphyxia]]. The process is not instantaneous.

===Percussive stunning===
With percussive stunning, a device which hits the animal on the head, with or without [[Penetrating_head_injury|penetration]], is employed.  Such devices, such as the [[captive bolt pistol]], can be either pneumatic, or powder-actuated. Percussive stunning produces immediate unconsciousness through brain trauma.

File:Betäubung.jpeg|Directions for positioning bolt gun to ensure swift stunning

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==United States regulations==
Stunning is regulated by the provisions of the [[Humane Slaughter Act|Humane Methods of Slaughter Act]] (7 U.S.C. 1901), which the [[Food Safety and Inspection Service]] (FSIS) is mandated to uphold under the [[Meat Inspection Act|Federal Meat Inspection Act]] (21 U.S.C. 603 (b)). No similar provision exists in the [[Poultry Products Inspection Act of 1957]] (21 U.S.C. 451 et seq.).

After confirmation of the first U.S. [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|BSE]] case, FSIS issued regulations (69 FR 1887, January 12, 2004) prohibiting the use of the most widely used stunning device (air-injection [[Captive bolt gun|captive bolt stun gun]]) because the compressed air device (in contrast to the blank cartridge-driven or non-penetrating captive bolt) has been shown to force pieces of brain and other central nervous system (CNS) tissue into the bloodstream. Cattle blood is processed primarily for use as a protein supplement in animal feeds and milk replacer for calves, and could transmit BSE if it contained specified risk materials (SRMs include brain and CNS tissue).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/05jun/97-905.pdf CRS Report for Congress: Agriculture: A Glossary of Terms, Programs, and Laws, 2005 Edition - Order Code 97-905] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110212033139/http://ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/05jun/97-905.pdf |date=2011-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theodore Joscelyn Curphey''' (October 25, 1897 – November 27, 1986) was an [[United States|American]] [[coroner]] who was the chief coroner for [[Los Angeles County|Los Angeles]] and [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau]] Counties.

Curphey was elected [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau County]] medical examiner on December 15, 1937 by the Nassau County Board of Supervisors.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1937/12/15/archives/gets-nassau-medioal-post.html|title=Gets Nassau Medioal Post|date=1937-12-15|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2009-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to becoming county medical examiner, Curphey had worked as a [[Pathology|pathologist]] at [[St. John's Hospital (Brooklyn, NY)|St. John's Hospital]] in [[Brooklyn]] &lt;ref name="jimmunol.org"&gt;http://www.jimmunol.org/cgi/content/abstract/28/1/55&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nassau University Medical Center|Meadowbrook Hospital]] &lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; in [[East Meadow, New York]]. As Nassau County's Chief Medical Examiner he oversaw the autopsies of [[Robert L. Bacon]], [[Raymond Fernandez and Martha Beck#Murders|Janet Fay]], [[Owen Davis, Jr.]], and [[William Woodward, Jr.]]. He also worked with the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] to identify the fatalities of [[Northeast Airlines Flight 823]]. While working as Nassau County Medical Examiner, Curphey also served as the Chairman of the New York State Medical Society's Public Health and Education Committee, President of the Nassau County Medical Society, and Chairman of the Nassau County Committee of the [[American Cancer Society]].

On March 19, 1957, Curphey was announced as the first Coroner of Los Angeles County.&lt;ref name="jimmunol.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/458647672.html?dids=458647672:458647672&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;date=Mar+20%2C+1957&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=Coroner+Takes+Over%3B+Plans+No+Early+Changes|title=Coroner Takes Over; Plans No Early Changes|date=1957-03-20|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2009-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first year as coroner, he was involved in a dispute with local morticians over delay in issuing death certificates.&lt;ref name="lat"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/441285202.html?dids=441285202:441285202&amp;FMT=CITE&amp;FMTS=CITE:AI&amp;date=Jan+30%2C+1958&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=CORONER+STRESSES+AUTOPSIES+NEED|title=Coroner Stresses Autopsies Needed|date=1958-01-30|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2009-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1958, Curphey's autopsy procedures were investigated by a grand jury,&lt;ref name="lat" /&gt; which accused him of misconduct. The charges against Curphey were later brought before the Los Angeles County Civil Service Commission, which promised him that no further complaints will be filed against him.&lt;ref name="lat" /&gt;

Curphey was the chief coroner during the investigation into the [[death of Marilyn Monroe]]. On August 7, 1962, two days after her death, Curphey announced that a massive [[overdose of barbiturates]] was the cause of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1fMLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_1YDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5612,1172070&amp;dq|title=Did Accident End Marilyn's Life?|date=1962-08-07|publisher=The Evening Independent|accessdate=2009-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later said she had lethal doses of both [[Pentobarbital|Nembutal]] or [[chloral hydrate]] and she could have been killed by either.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UwAUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=VYoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7120,3131395&amp;dq|title=Marilyn's Death Follows Pattern Of Other Tries|date=1962-08-18|publisher=The Free Lance–Star|accessdate=2009-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Curphey also administered the autopsies of [[Jack Westrope]], [[George Reeves]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eacSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=j_cDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6470,4235251&amp;dq|title=Quotable quotes|date=1959-06-24|publisher=The Bend Bulletin|accessdate=2009-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Davey Moore (1960s)|Davey Moore]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XykNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=KGwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5818,3786520&amp;dq|title=New Report On Moore By Doctors|date=1963-03-26|publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|accessdate=2009-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Red Sanders]],&lt;ref name="SAEXPRESS"&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/29582589/ Red Sanders Ruled Victim of Athlete's Heart] Express and News from San Antonio, Texas, August 16, 1958, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dorothy Dandridge]].

Curphey retired on October 25, 1967 from the [[Los Angeles County Coroner]]’s office. After his retirement he served as consultant in forensic medicine and on the Suicide Prevention Bureau, which he founded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/04/obituaries/dr-theodore-curphey-dies-was-coroner-for-los-angeles.html|title=Dr. Theodore Curphey Dies; Was Coroner for Los Angeles|date=1986-12-04|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2009-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
''Totentanz'' is cast in one continuous [[Movement (music)|movement]] and has a duration of roughly 40 minutes.

===Background===
''Totentanz'' is set to an anonymously authored text that appeared under a 15th-century [[frieze]] in [[St. Mary's Church, Lübeck]], that was destroyed by a British [[Bombing of Lübeck in World War II|air raid]] in [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ross |first=Alex |authorlink=Alex Ross (music critic) |title=Dance of Death: Thomas Adès’s latest work is a meditation on an ancient theme. |work=[[The New Yorker]] |date=March 16, 2015 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/16/classical-dance-of-death |accessdate=June 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Catton |first=Pia |title=Thomas Adès’s Death Comes, With a Whistle: 'Totentanz' comes to the New York Philharmonic |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=March 10, 2015 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/thomas-adess-death-comes-with-a-whistle-1426031127 |accessdate=June 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the score program notes, Adès wrote, "the frieze depicted members of every category of human society in strictly descending order of status, from the [[Pope]] to a baby. In-between each human figure is an image of [[Death (personification)|Death]], dancing and inviting the humans to join him.

The work is scored for baritone, mezzo-soprano, and a large orchestra consisting of three [[Western concert flute|flutes]] (1st and 2nd doubling [[piccolo]]; 3rd doubling piccolo and [[alto flute]]), three [[oboe]]s (3rd doubling [[cor anglais]]), three [[clarinet]]s (1st in B-flat and A, doubling [[E-flat clarinet]]); 2nd in A, doubling [[bass clarinet]]; 3rd in A, doubling bass clarinet with low C), three [[bassoon]]s (2nd doubling [[contrabassoon]]; 3rd doubling [[contraforte]] or contrabassoon with low A), four [[French horn|horns]], three [[trumpet]]s (all doubling [[flugelhorn]]), two [[trombone]]s, [[bass trombone]], [[contrabass tuba]], [[timpani]] (doubling [[rototom]]s), six to eight percussionists, [[Pedal harp|harp]], [[piano]] (doubling [[celesta]]), and [[String section|strings]].&lt;ref name="LAPhil" /&gt;

==Reception==
''Totentanz'' has been highly praised by music critics.  Reviewing the world premiere, Ivan Hewett of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' called it "an immense achievement" and compared it favorably to performances of [[Benjamin Britten]]'s ''[[Sinfonia da Requiem]]'' and [[Witold Lutosławski]]'s [[Cello Concerto (Lutosławski)|Cello Concerto]], writing, "On their own these two performances would have lifted this Prom into a different class. Then came something that raised it higher still; the world premiere of Thomas Adès's ''Totentanz''."&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt;  Helen Wallace of ''[[BBC Music Magazine]]'' similarly opined, "It hurls us into a labyrinth the senior composer would recognise, but which is darker and more manically brutal than anything even he conceived."&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;  The piece was also praised by Andrew Clements of ''[[The Guardian]]'', who wrote:{{quote|In Adès's piece the baritone is death's mouthpiece - declamatory, angular and rather [[Alban Berg|Bergian]] (the opening of the work very much recalls the prologue to ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]''), with just a few moments of insidious quietness, while the mezzo, more lyrical, more vulnerable, represents the victims who vainly try to resist him. Throughout their exchanges the orchestral machine moves relentlessly on, constantly changing tack and inventing new sound-worlds but always keeping its power in reserve, and consuming everything it encounters. In the closing pages death and humanity seem to reach a truce in a passage of almost [[Richard Strauss|Straussian]] lyricism, Adès's most frankly expressive music to date, but it proves only temporary and the work ends in the lowest depths of the orchestra, having worked its way downwards.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;}}

Reviewing the [[United States]] premiere, [[Martin Bernheimer]] of the ''[[Financial Times]]'' remarked, "The 40-minute ''Totentanz'' [...] represents a clever dance of death predicated on harmonic, rhythmic and, occasionally, melodic complexity. The first half emerges essentially raucous, the second predominantly serene (everything, of course, is relative). Adès toys neatly with contrasting images of terror and resignation, manipulating a huge orchestral apparatus with virtuosic clarity amid percussive bombast."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bernheimer |first=Martin |authorlink=Martin Bernheimer |title=New York Philharmonic/Adès, Avery Fisher Hall, New York — review |work=[[Financial Times]] |date=March 15, 2015 |url=https://next.ft.com/content/52c693cc-c96d-11e4-a2d9-00144feab7de |accessdate=June 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  David Allen of ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the work as "a grisly [[symphony]]-[[cantata]] for two singers and a vast orchestra that is his longest, most ambitious and most astounding orchestral composition yet."  He added, "Despite an imprecise performance here, it's clear that with ''Totentanz'', this composer takes a dizzying leap beyond his finest earlier scores — ''[[Asyla]]'' (1997) and ''[[Tevot]]'' (2007) — and adds to a lineage of musical death-dances, including those of [[Totentanz (Liszt)|Liszt]] and [[Danse macabre (Saint-Saëns)|Saint-Saëns]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Allen |first=David |title=Review: Thomas Adès Leads the Philharmonic, and Björk Listens |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 13, 2015 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/14/arts/music/review-thomasades-leads-the-philharmonic-andbjork-listens.html |accessdate=June 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, George Grella of the ''New York Classical Review'' was slightly more critical of the piece.  Despite describing it as Adés's "most fully realized large-scale score to date," Grella nevertheless observed, "''Totentanz'' works musically, is fascinating and powerful throughout, though it’s [''sic''] language still is at one remove from touching the listener intimately. The piece makes clear what Adés is thinking, but while we hear what is in his head, we don’t necessarily feel it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Grella |first=George |title=Adés dances and romances death at Philharmonic |work=New York Classical Review |date=March 13, 2015 |url=http://newyorkclassicalreview.com/2015/03/ades-dances-and-romances-death-at-philharmonic/ |accessdate=June 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lar7 cogniet 001z.jpg|thumb|300px|The White flag of the [[Ancien Régime|French monarchy]] transformed into the Tricolore as a result of the [[July Revolution]], painting by [[Léon Cogniet]] (1830).]]

A '''tricolour''' or '''tricolor''' is a type of [[flag]] or [[banner]] design with a [[Triband (flag)|triband]] design which originated in the 16th century as a symbol of [[classical republicanism|republicanism]], [[liberty]] or indeed [[revolution]].  The [[Flag of France|flags of France]], [[Flag of Italy|Italy]], [[Flag of Romania|Romania]], [[Flag of Mexico|Mexico]], and [[Flag of Ireland|Ireland]] were all first adopted with the formation of an independent [[republic]] in the period of the [[French Revolution]] to the [[Revolutions of 1848]], with the exception of the Irish tricolour, which dates from 1848 but was not popularised until the [[Easter Rising]] in 1916 and adopted in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/tricolor|title=tricolor - definition of tricolor in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2016-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first association of the tricolour with republicanism is the orange-white-blue design of the [[Prince's Flag]] (''Prinsenvlag'', predecessor of the flags [[flag of the Netherlands|of the Netherlands]] and [[flag of Luxembourg|Luxembourg]]), used from 1579 by [[William I of Orange-Nassau]] in the [[Eighty Years' War]], establishing the independence of the [[Dutch Republic]] from the [[Spanish Empire]].
 
Though not the first tricolour flag, one of the most famous, known as ''Le Tricolore'', is the blue, white and red (whence also called ''Le Bleu-Blanc-Rouge'') [[flag of France]] adopted in the [[French Revolution]].

With the formation of [[French client republic]]s after 1795, the revolutionary tricolour was exported and adopted more widely in Europe, by 
the [[Republic of Alba]] 1796 (red-blue-yellow),
the [[Cisalpine Republic]] 1797    ([[Transpadane Republic]], green-white-red),
the [[Cisrhenian Republic]] 1797 (green-white-red),
the [[Anconine Republic]] 1797  (blue-yellow-red),
the [[Roman Republic (18th century)|Roman Republic]] 1798 (black-white-red),
the [[Helvetic Republic]] 1798 (green-yellow-red; [[canton of Neuchatel]] 1848), 
the [[Parthenopean Republic]] 1799 (blue-yellow-red), 
the [[Principality of Lucca and Piombino]] 1805 (blue-white-red). Thus providing the format for most of modern Europe's national flags, from the [[flag of Italy]], to the [[flag of Germany]], [[flag of Ireland]], [[flag of Belgium]], [[flag of Romania]], [[flag of Bulgaria]], [[flag of Moldova]], and others around the World such as the [[flag of Cameroon]], [[flag of Chad]], [[flag of Ivory Coast]], [[flag of Gabon]], [[flag of Guinea]], [[flag of Mali]], and [[flag of Nigeria]].

The green-white-red tricolour remained a symbol of republicanism throughout the 19th century and was adopted as [[national flag]] by a number of states following the [[Revolutions of 1848]]. It was also adopted by the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] (inherited by the [[Kingdom of Italy]] 1861).

The [[flag of Germany]] (black-red-gold) originated as the flag of the revolutionary, anti-monarchist [[Freikorps]] of the 1830s and was later adopted by the republicanist bourgeoisie, at the time known as ''Dreifarb'', a German calque of ''Tricolore''. This flag was a symbol of opposition against the German ''[[Kleinstaaterei]]'' and the desire for [[German Unification]]. It was at first illegal in the [[German Confederation]], but was adopted as the national flag at the [[Frankfurt Parliament]] of 1848/9. The [[flag of Belgium]] was introduced in a similar context, in 1831, its colours taken from the flag used in the [[Brabant Revolution]] of 1789.
The first national flag of the [[New World]] inspired by this symbolism was the [[flag of Mexico]], adopted when the [[First Mexican Empire]] gained [[Mexican War of Independence|independence from Spain]] in 1821.

After 1848, the young republican [[nation state]]s continued to pick triband designs, but now more prevalently expressing the sentiment of [[nationalism]] or [[ethnic identity]] than anti-monarchism, the [[flag of Hungary]] (1848),&lt;!--hard to argue the Hungarian revolution was anti-monarchist as they chose the colours of the old Hungarian royal coat of arms. It was nationalist because they wanted to get rid of the *foreign* (Austrian) monarchs, but their own monarchy was sufficiently removed not to clash with the republican sentiment. Sources needed.--&gt;
the [[flag of Romania]] (1848), &lt;!--apparently also royal colours, of [[Michael the Brave]]--&gt;
the [[Flag of Ireland]] (1848),
the [[flag of Estonia]] (1880s),
the [[flag of Lithuania]] (1905),
and the [[flag of Armenia]] (1918). &lt;!--although this was based on a royal design, of the [[Rubenid Dynasty]]--&gt;
By contrast, the [[flag of Russia]] was adopted by the [[Tsardom of Russia]] in the late 17th century and while it may or may not have been inspired by the Dutch tricolour, it never had any republican implications.

The political ideology of the unification of an ethnic [[nation state]] associated with tricolour flags since the 19th century has resulted in the design of new "tricolours" expressing specific [[nationalism]]s in the 20th century, 
the [[Pan-African colours]] adopted in the 1920s for [[Pan-Africanism]], chosen in numerous African flags during [[Decolonization|decolonisation]] (green-yellow-red, taken from the triband design used by the [[Solomonic dynasty]] for the [[Ethiopian Empire]] since 1897). The [[Pan-Arab colors|Pan-Arab colours]] adopted in [[Arab nationalism]] 1916 are a comparable concept, even though they combine four, not three, colours.
Also in the 20th century, [[Pan-Iranian colours]] for [[Iranian nationalism]] and [[Pan-Slavic colors|Pan-Slavic colours]] for [[Pan-Slavism|Slavic nationalism]] were adopted based on the triband design of the flags used during the 19th century by the [[Qajar dynasty]] and the [[Russian Empire]], respectively.

The [[Indian independence movement]] in 1931 also adopted a tricolour (loan-translated as Hindi, तिरंगा ''Tiraṅgā'') in the traditional symbolism of "national unification" and republican "self-rule" ([[Purna Swaraj]]), adopted as the [[Flag of India|flag of the Indian Republic]] in 1947.

In 1999, a red, green, and blue tricolour was proposed as the [[Flag of Mars]]. The design symbolizes [[liberty]], and also the [[terraforming of Mars]] by [[human]]ity from a red planet to a green one, and eventually an Earth-like blue one.

'''Yonggary''' ({{ko-hhrm|용가리||Yonggari}}) is a [[kaiju|giant monster]] originating from the 1967 [[South Korea]]n film ''[[Yongary, Monster from the Deep]]''. The film and its title character were produced to rival the success of [[Toho]]'s ''[[Godzilla]]'' films during the mid-60s.

==Overview==
===Name and copyright===
The name "Yonggary" is a combination of two Korean words: "[[Yong (Korean name)|Yong]]" (meaning dragon) and "gari" (derived from [[Pulgasari|Bulgasari]]).{{sfn|Ryfle|Song-ho|2016|loc=2:49}} The rights to the character are currently owned by Younggu Art, founded by Korean filmmaker [[Shim Hyung-rae]], director of ''[[Yonggary (1999 film)|Yonggary]]'' (1999).&lt;ref name="Toy"/&gt;

===Development===
====1967 Yonggary====
The 1967 Yonggary was originally conceived as a single-celled organism from space that mutated into a giant monster after exposure from radiation during a nuclear bomb test.{{sfn|Ryfle|Song-ho|2016|loc=28:30}} The 1967 Yonggary was brought to life using a man in a rubber suit. Masao Yagi, who built the [[Gamera]] suit for [[Daiei Film|Daiei]], supervised the construction of the Yonggary suit.{{sfn|Ryfle|Song-ho|2016|loc=32:07}} The character was designed in Korea, while the suit was built in Japan based on the Korean design.{{sfn|Ryfle|Song-ho|2016|loc=32:54}} Director Kim Ki-duk found that the suit lacked terror and was disappointed with the final results but proceeded to film with the suit since there was no time or money to produce a new suit.{{sfn|Ryfle|Song-ho|2016|loc=33:05}} The suit ended up costing ₩1.2 million ($5,000 in USD) to produce.{{sfn|Ryfle|Song-ho|2016|loc=1:07:51}}

Cho Kyoung-min portrayed Yonggary, who was paid ₩100,000 ($400 in USD).{{sfn|Ryfle|Song-ho|2016|loc=1:07:57}} The film and its title character were produced to rival the success of Toho's ''[[Godzilla]]''{{sfn|Ryfle|Song-ho|2016|loc=1:00:58}} and the film was released in Germany as '''''Godzilla's Todespranke''''' (Godzilla's Hand of Death).{{sfn|Kalat|2010|p=92}}

The 1967 Yonggary has a bipedal reptilian design with a long horn on his snout, tusks at the side of his mouth, a single row of dorsal fins, and spikes on the side of his tail. The 1967 Yonggary is capable of breathing fire and his primary food source is oil and gasoline.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yongary, Monster from the Deep]] (1967). Directed by [[Kim Ki-duk (director, born 1934)|Kim Ki-duk]]. Keukdong Entertainment&lt;/ref&gt;

====1999 Yonggary====
In the opening credits of the 2001 upgrade edition of ''Yonggary'', [[Shim Hyung-rae]] (the film's director) is credited as the creator of the 1999 incarnation of Yonggary.&lt;ref name="upgrade"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x98aEHWPRl0&amp;t=5136s Yonggary: 2001 Upgrade Edition] (2001). Directed by [[Shim Hyung-rae]]. Zero Nine Entertainment&lt;/ref&gt; Miniatures and suits for Yonggary and Cyker were produced, but the suits were later replaced with [[Computer-generated imagery]] during post-production, thus the 1999 Yonggary is made nearly entirely out of CG effects. For the film's CG effects, the animators used a technique called the "pipeline method", Park Chang-yong (Younggu Art's Chief of 3D Animation) described it as "A continuous process. It strives for large synergy effects by enhancing efficiency at all stages from 3D computer graphic modeling to rendering." The film ended up utilizing 45 minutes of computer graphics.&lt;ref name="Making of"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuajL6ep48c&amp;t=313s|title=The Making of Yonggary (1999)|work=|date=|accessdate=September 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVEJmKsZe4s&amp;t=3s|title=Yonggary (1999) Behind the Scenes Photos|work=Japanese DVD Special Features|date=|accessdate=September 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1999 Yonggary has a drastically different design from the original 1967 incarnation. The 1999 incarnation sports three horns on his head and the horn on his snout has been decreased to a smaller size. The 1999 Yonggary is also capable of breathing fire (referred to as "fireballs" in the film) and has a diamond-shaped receptor on his forehead that allow the aliens to control him. Under the aliens' control, Yonggary is shown to be aggressive and violent, but when the military breaks the aliens' control over Yonggary, he is shown to be a gentle creature, even going as far as to save people from being crushed by a collapsing building. While the 1967 Yonggary died, the 1999 incarnation is shown to live and is transported by the military to a deserted island to live in peace.&lt;ref name="upgrade"/&gt;

==Merchandise==
In 2000, [[Sonokong]] Korea releasing [[Yonggary (1999 film)|Reptilian]] as a ''DX Yonggary'' figure in as a theater exclusive in marketing the film on South Korea sold that figures. In 2008, graphic designer Hong Gi-hun (founder of South Korea's "Big Monster Club") created "semi-official" toys based on Korean monsters, such as the 1967 Yonggary, [[Pulgasari]], and Wangmagwi. Though semi-official, Shim Hyung-rae still gave his blessing for the Yonggary toy and two sets of the toys were presented by film director [[Kim Ki-duk (director, born 1934)|Kim Ki-duk]], director of the original ''Yongary, Monster from the Deep'' (1967).&lt;ref name="Toy"/&gt;
