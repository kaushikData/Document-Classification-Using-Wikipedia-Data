'''ARP4754''', Aerospace Recommended Practice (ARP) ARP4754A (''Guidelines For Development Of Civil Aircraft and Systems''), is a guideline from [[SAE International]], dealing with the development processes which support [[Type certificate|certification]] of [[Avionics#Aircraft avionics|Aircraft systems]]. Revision A was released in December 2010. It was recognized by the FAA in AC 20-174 published November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite manual

&lt;/ref&gt; [[EUROCAE]] jointly issues the document as ED&amp;ndash;79.

==Objectives of the document==
The Aerospace Recommended Practice (ARP) is a guideline for development of civil aircraft and systems with an emphasis on safety aspects. Revision A is a substantial rewrite of the document which describes the safety process as a part of an Integrated Development Process. A significant new section is devoted to the process of determining Development Assurance Level (DAL) which determines the rigor of complex hardware and software development and verification activities.

It is intended to be used in conjunction with SAE [[ARP4761]] (still under revision in December 2013) and is supported by other aviation standards such as [[RTCA, Incorporated|RTCA]] [[DO-178C]]/[[DO-178B]] and [[DO-254]].

This guideline addresses Functional Safety and design assurance processes. DAL allocation pertaining to functional failure conditions and hazard severity are assigned to help mitigate risks. Functional Hazard Analyses / Assessments are central to determining hazards and assigning DAL, in addition to requirements based testing and other verification methods. This guideline concerns itself with Physical (item) DAL and Functional (software/systems integration behavior) DAL and the Safety aspects of systems for the whole life-cycle for systems that implement [[Avionics#Aircraft avionics|aircraft functions]].

==History==
ARP4754 was defined in the context of [[Type certificate|aircraft certification]], in particular Part&amp;nbsp;25 Sections 1301 and 1309 of harmonized [[civil aviation]] regulations for [[transport category]] [[airplane]]s. These are found in the U.S. [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] [[Federal Aviation Regulations]] (FAR) at 14&amp;nbsp;CFR&amp;nbsp;25.1309 and the corresponding European [[Joint Aviation Authorities|JAA]] [[Joint Aviation Requirements]] (JAR), which have been replaced by [[European Aviation Safety Agency|EASA]] certification standards. FAA Advisory Circular [[AC 25.1309-1]]A, ''System Design and Analysis'', explained certification methodology for Part&amp;nbsp;25 Section&amp;nbsp;1309.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite manual 
 |     author = ANM-110
 |      title = System Design and Analysis
 |    section = 
 | sectionurl = 
 |    version =

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1996, the FAA Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC) was tasked with a review of harmonized FAR/JAR&amp;nbsp;25.1309, AC&amp;nbsp;1309-1A, and related documents, and to consider revision to AC&amp;nbsp;1309-1A incorporating recent practice, increasing complex integration between aircraft functions and the systems that implement them,&lt;ref&gt;ARP4754A, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; and the implications of new technology. This task was published in the Federal Register at 61 FR 26246-26247 (1996-05-24). The focus was to be on safety assessment and fault-tolerant critical systems.

In a parallel effort, SAE published ARP4754 in November 1996. In 2002 ARAC submitted to the FAA a draft Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) and draft revision AC&amp;nbsp;1309-1B (the draft ARSENAL version) recognizing the role of ARP4754 in complex system certification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite manual

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This draft remains unreleased, but ARP4754 became broadly recognized as an appropriate standard for aircraft system development and certification. The corresponding EASA Acceptable Means of Compliance AMC 25.1309 (included as a section of CS-25) does recognize ARP4754/ED&amp;ndash;79.

The FAA and EASA have both subsequently recognized ARP4754/ED&amp;ndash;79 as valid for certification of other aircraft categories, and for specific systems such as avionic databuses.

ARP4754A and ED79A were released by SAE and EUROCAE in December 2010.  The document title has changed to ''Guidelines For Development Of Civil Aircraft and Systems''.  ARP4754A recognizes AMC&amp;nbsp;25.1309 (published in 2003) and AC&amp;nbsp;25.1309-1B-Arsenal draft. This revision expands the design assurance concept for application at the aircraft and system level and standardizes on the use of the term development assurance.  As a consequence, Functional Development Assurance Level (FDAL) is introduced for aircraft and systems concerns and the term Design Assurance Level has been renamed Item Development Assurance Level (IDAL).&lt;ref&gt;ARP4754A, pp. 7-8&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, the addition of definitions for ''Error'', ''Failure'', and ''Failure Condition'' are acknowledge as derived from AMC&amp;nbsp;25.1309.&lt;ref&gt;ARP4754A, pp. 11&lt;/ref&gt;  The qualitative and quantitative classification of failure conditions by severity and probability now used by ARP4754A&lt;ref&gt;ARP4754A, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; and ARP4761&lt;ref&gt;{{cite manual | last = S&amp;ndash;18 | title = Guidelines and methods for conducting the safety assessment process on civil airborne systems and equipment  | publisher = [[Society of Automotive Engineers]] | year = 1996 | url = http://www.sae.org/technical/standards/ARP4761 | id = ARP4761 | page=9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are defined in AMC&amp;nbsp;25.1309/AC&amp;nbsp;25.1309&amp;ndash;1B-Arsenal draft.

'''Afrophobia''' is a perceived fear of the cultures and peoples of [[Ethnic groups of Africa|Africa]], as well as the [[African diaspora]].&lt;ref name="Pwpa"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kivuto Ndeti |author2=Kenneth R. Gray |author3=Gerard Bennaars |title=The second scramble for Africa: a response &amp; a critical analysis of the challenges facing contempory &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93; sub-Saharan Africa|date=1992|publisher=Professors World Peace Academy|isbn=9966835733|page=127|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=ScsDAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Primarily a cultural phenomenon, it pertains to the various traditions and peoples of [[Africa]], irrespective of racial origin.&lt;ref name="Pwpa"/&gt; As such, ''Afrophobia'' is distinct from the historical racial phenomenon ''[[negrophobia]]'', which is a contempt for ''[[Negroid|negro]]'' peoples specifically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Congregational Review, Volume 2|publisher=J.M. Whittemore|page=629|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=LkZKAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposite of Afrophobia is [[Afrophilia]], which is a love for all things pertaining to Africa.&lt;ref name="Pwpa"/&gt;

To overcome any perceived "Afrophobia", writer [[Langston Hughes]] suggested that [[European Americans]] must achieve peace of mind and accommodate the uninhibited emotionality of [[African Americans]]. Author [[James Baldwin]] similarly recommended that White Americans could quash any "Afrophobia" on their part by getting in touch with their repressed feelings, empathizing to overcome their "emotionally stunted" lives, and thereby overcome any dislike or fear of African Americans.&lt;ref name="Washington"&gt;{{cite book|date=2001|title=The Ideologies of African American Literature|author =Washington, Robert E.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PP6DSxXSFhsC|page=272|publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been observed that writing and terminology about racism, including about Afrophobia has been somewhat U.S.-centric.  In 2016, Afrophobia has been used as a term for racism against darker-skinned persons in China. In such usage Afrophobia is an inexact term, because the racism is directed against darker-skinned persons from anywhere, without regard to any connection to Africa. Conversely, Chinese views for lighter-than-average skin are more positive, as reflected in advertising.&lt;ref name=&gt;{{cite news|url=http://africanarguments.org/2016/08/12/claims-of-chinas-afrophobia-show-we-need-new-ways-to-think-about-race-and-racism/ |title=Claims of “China’s Afrophobia” show we need new ways to think about race and racism |date=August 12, 2016 |author=Roberto Castillo }} (posted originally at The Conversation, with title [https://theconversation.com/of-washing-powder-afrophobia-and-racism-in-china-60274 Of washing powder, Afrophobia and racism in China], August 11, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, [[Tess Asplund]] made a viral protest against [[Neo-Nazism]] as part of her activism against Afrophobia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/04/woman-defied-neo-nazis-sweden-tess-asplund-viral-photograph|title=Woman who defied 300 neo-Nazis at Swedish rally speaks of anger|last=Crouch|first=David|date=2016-05-04|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Arabic Speech Corpus''' is a [[Modern Standard Arabic]] (MSA) speech corpus for speech synthesis. The corpus contains phonetic and orthographic transcriptions of more than 3.7 hours of MSA speech aligned with recorded speech on the phoneme level. The annotations include word stress marks on the individual phonemes.&lt;ref name="HALABI2016"&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Halabi |first=Nawar |year=2016 |title=Modern Standard Arabic Phonetics for Speech Synthesis |url=http://en.arabicspeechcorpus.com/Nawar%20Halabi%20PhD%20Thesis%20Revised.pdf |type=PhD Thesis |publisher=[[University of Southampton]], School of Electronics and Computer Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arabic Speech Corpus was built as part of a doctoral project by [[Nawar Halabi]] at the [[University of Southampton]] funded by [http://www.microlinkpc.com/ MicroLinkPC] who own an exclusive license to commercialise the corpus, but the corpus is available for strictly non-commercial purposes through the [http://www.arabicspeechcorpus.com official Arabic Speech Corpus website]. It is distributed under the [[Creative Commons]] Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.&lt;ref name="OX2016"&gt;{{cite |year=2016 |title=Arabic Speech Corpus |url=http://ota.ox.ac.uk/desc/2561 |type=Web Page |publisher=[[University of Oxford]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The corpus was mainly built for speech synthesis purposes, specifically [[Speech Synthesis]], but the corpus has been used for building HMM based voices in Arabic. It was also used to automatically align other speech corpora with their phonetic transcript and could be used as part of a larger corpus for training speech recognition systems.&lt;ref name="HALABI2016"&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Halabi |first=Nawar |year=2016 |title=Modern Standard Arabic Phonetics for Speech Synthesis |url=http://en.arabicspeechcorpus.com/Nawar%20Halabi%20PhD%20Thesis%20Revised.pdf |type=PhD Thesis |publisher=[[University of Southampton]], School of Electronics and Computer Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
The package contains the following:
* 1813 .wav files containing spoken utterances.
* 1813 .lab files containing text utterances.
* 1813 .TextGrid files containing the phoneme labels with time stamps of the boundaries where these occur in the .wav files. These files can be opened using Praat software.
* phonetic-transcript.txt which has the form "[wav_filename]" "[Phoneme Sequence]" in every line.
* orthographic-transcript.txt which has the form "[wav_filename]" "[Orthographic Transcript]" in every line. Orthography is in Buckwalter Format which is friendlier where there is software that does not read Arabic script. It can be easily converted back to Arabic.
* There is an extra 18 minutes of fully annotated corpus (separate from above but with the same structure as above) which was used to evaluated the corpus (see PhD thesis).

The corpus was also used to prove that using automatically extracted, orthography-based stress marks&lt;ref name="HALPERN2009"&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.cjk.org/cjk/arabic/an_paper.pdf |title=Word Stress and Vowel Neutralization in Modern Standard Arabic |first=Jack |last=Halpern |year=2009 |conference=2nd International Conference on Arabic Language Resources and Tools |location= Cairo}}&lt;/ref&gt; improve the quality of speech synthesis in MSA.

The '''Association for Scottish Literary Studies''' (ASLS) is a Scottish educational [[charitable organization|charity]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scottish Charity Register|publisher=Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator|url=http://www.oscr.org.uk/CharityIndexDetails.aspx?id=SC006535|accessdate=16 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded in 1970 to promote and support the teaching, study and writing of [[Scottish literature]].

In 1970, Hey was brought into the Oklahoma-based [[NWA Tri-State]] promotion by [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Book|booker]] [[Bill Watts]]. Watts had intended to create a new tag team comprising Jack Donovan and veteran journeyman Jerry Brown. After Donovan left the promotion following a dispute with Watts, Watts hired Hey in his place. Hey was renamed "Buddy Roberts" and began teaming with Brown as [[The Hollywood Blonds]].&lt;ref name="WattsWilliams2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Bill Watts]]|author2=Scott Williams|title=The Cowboy and the Cross: The Bill Watts Story: Rebellion, Wrestling and Redemption|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AOTLLXwEBXkC&amp;pg=PA97|date=January 2006|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=978-1-55022-708-6|pages=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, [[Oliver Humperdink]] began managing The Hollywood Blonds.&lt;ref name="LapradeHebert2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Patric Laprade|author2=Bertrand Hebert|title=Mad Dogs, Midgets and Screw Jobs: The Untold Story of How Montreal Shaped the World of Wrestling|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ey8bluWM_m4C&amp;pg=PA1940|date=14 March 2013|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=978-1-77090-296-1|pages=1,940}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After splitting from Brown, Roberts joined with [[Michael Hayes (wrestler)|Michael Hayes]] and [[Terry Gordy]] to form [[The Fabulous Freebirds]]. Again, Bill Watts played a major role in this decision. Hayes and Gordy had been teaming together in various promotions in the Mid-South and Southeastern regions of the United States for several years, but Watts was not as impressed with Hayes's in-ring work as he was with his skills on the microphone.&lt;ref name="Klein2014"/&gt; His original plan was to have Gordy and Roberts as the actual tag team, with Hayes as their manager. Except for a high-profile stint in 1980 in Mid-South Wrestling (formed by Watts the previous year after breaking away from NWA Tri-State) with Hayes and Gordy as the Freebirds, Roberts did not work full-time with the team until they joined World Class Championship Wrestling (see below).

Hey later became known as Buddy "Jack" Roberts, due to his penchant for drinking [[Jack Daniel's]] whiskey.&lt;ref name="Birds"&gt;{{cite book | author=Greg Oliver and Steve Johnson | title= The Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame: The Tag Teams | publisher=ECW Press | chapter= Top 20: 7 The Fabulous Freebirds | pages= 46–51 | year=2005| isbn=978-1-55022-683-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====World Class Championship Wrestling/World Wrestling Federation====
The Fabulous Freebirds won several titles and moved on to [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] in late 1982 and began a high-profile feud with the [[Von Erich family]]. They wrestled [[David Von Erich]], [[Kerry Von Erich]], [[Mike Von Erich]] and [[Kevin Von Erich]] numerous times in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wrestlingdata.com/index.php?befehl=bios&amp;wrestler=2095&amp;bild=1&amp;details=7&amp;liga=172&amp;jahr=1986 Buddy Roberts' 1986 WCCW matches, from WrestlingData.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Roberts also had a long-standing feud with Von Erich ally [[Chris Adams (wrestler)|Chris Adams]], which lasted on and off for more than five years.&lt;ref name="Birds"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wrestlingdata.com/index.php?befehl=konst&amp;letter1=B&amp;wrestler1=1917&amp;letter2=C&amp;wrestler2=5134&amp;letter3=&amp;wrestler3=0&amp;letter4=&amp;wrestler4=0&amp;matchtyp=0&amp;anzeige=matches Roberts matches with Chris Adams, from WrestlingData.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Roberts' most famous singles angle came in WCCW in 1983, and involved the invention of what the Freebirds referred to as "Freebird Hair Removal Cream". The angle culminated in a hair match between Roberts and [[Iceman Parsons]] on June 17.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wrestlingdata.com/index.php?befehl=shows&amp;sort=liga&amp;show=55388 WCCW Wrestling Star Wars results, from WrestlingData.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Roberts seemingly won the match via tight-pulling, but the decision was reversed and the match restarted. In the fracas, Roberts' head was lathered in the hair removal cream. At subsequent events, Roberts wore a wig, kept in place by boxing headgear.&lt;ref name="Birds"/&gt;

In 1984, Roberts and the Freebirds had a short stint in the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]], mainly competing in six-man tag matches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wrestlingdata.com/index.php?befehl=bios&amp;wrestler=2095&amp;bild=1&amp;details=7&amp;liga=3&amp;jahr=1984 Roberts' 1984 WWF matches, from WrestlingData.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Here, they were managed by [[Cyndi Lauper]]'s manager, [[David Wolff]]. They left the promotion when WWF officials stated their intention to split the team up. At the AWA's [[SuperClash]] in 1985, Roberts helped Hayes and Gordy defeat [[The Road Warriors]] for the [[AWA World Tag Team Championship]], but the decision was later reversed.&lt;ref name="Birds"/&gt;

====Universal Wrestling Federation====
In early 1986, The Freebirds went to the [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Universal Wrestling Federation]], where Roberts won the UWF Television Championship on September 28. He lost it to Savannah Jack on November 9.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wrestlingdata.com/index.php?befehl=titles&amp;titel=874 UWF Television Title history, from WrestlingData.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UWFTV/&gt;

====Return to World Class Championship Wrestling====
In 1987, The Freebirds split up and reformed. Roberts and Gordy turned on Hayes and teamed with [[Iceman Parsons]] to feud with Hayes and the Von Erichs. Gordy eventually left Roberts to rejoin Hayes. The feud ended in late 1988 when Hayes and Gordy left for the [[National Wrestling Alliance|NWA]]'s [[Jim Crockett Promotions]], and Roberts acted as a manager to the [[Samoan Swat Team]] before he retired from wrestling.&lt;ref name="Birds"/&gt; Roberts also had a short feud with World Class referee David Manning, which included several gimmick matches, such as Roberts wrestling with one arm tied behind his back.  Manning, who was touted as an accomplished amateur wrestler by the promotion to compensate for the obvious size difference between the two, won most of the matches on a fluke.

===Late career===
Roberts managed Hayes and [[Jimmy Garvin]] in one match against [[Steve Armstrong]] and [[Tracy Smothers]] in [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) on September 5, 1990.&lt;ref name="Birds"/&gt; He came out of retirement on April 2, 1993 for the [[Global Wrestling Federation]]'s Kerry Von Erich Memorial Show, and teamed with Michael Hayes (with [[Skandor Akbar]] in their corner), losing to Kevin Von Erich and Chris Adams (with Fritz Von Erich in their corner).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://members5.boardhost.com/barneyspage/msg/1317071238.html| title=Barneys Room Global:1993-Pt.1| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304023227/http://members5.boardhost.com/barneyspage/msg/1317071238.html| archivedate=2016-03-04| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roberts later developed [[Head and neck cancer|throat cancer]], and had surgery to treat it. He was quoted as saying "Don't smoke. I think the reason this happened to me is because I was smoking too much. I recommend to anyone who smokes to quit now. It is hard, but it is worth it."&lt;ref name="DeFino"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/wherearetheynow/roberts|title= Where are they now? "Buddy Roberts" |publisher=[[WWE]]|work=[[WWE]].com|author=DeFino, Lennie|accessdate=January 14, 2017|date=May 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Roberts died on November 26, 2012, at the age of 65, of pneumonia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/264841/Kevin-Von-Erich-Comments-on-Buddy-Roberts/-Passing.htm Kevin von Erich comments on Buddy Roberts' passing]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prowrestling.net/artman/publish/WWE/article10028579.shtml Jim Ross comments on Roberts' death]&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 2, 2016, Roberts was posthumously inducted into the [[WWE Hall Of Fame]] by his son, Buddy "Jack" Roberts Jr. as part of [[The Fabulous Freebirds]].

'''Chilton Company''' (AKA Chilton Printing Co., Chilton Publishing Co., Chilton Book Co. and Chilton Research Services) is a former publishing company, most famous for its trade magazines, and automotive manuals. It also provided conference and market research services to a wide variety of industries. Chilton grew from a small publisher of a single magazine to a leading publisher of business-to-business magazines, consumer and professional automotive manuals, craft and hobby books, and a large, well-known marketing research company.

In the early years, its flagship magazine was ''Iron Age''. In 1955, Chilton's profit reached $1 million for the first time, of which ''Iron Age'' accounted for $750,000. By 1980, ''Iron Age'''s revenue and status had declined due to the reduction in the size of the US metalworking manufacturing industry, and ''Jewelers Circular Keystone'' captured the position of Chilton's most profitable magazine. While Chilton had leading magazines in several different industries, the Chilton name is most strongly associated with the consumer and professional automotive manuals, which [[Cengage Learning]] continues to license or publish.

== History ==
The company's origins go back to July 1896, and the first issue of ''Cycle Trade Journal'', edited by [[James Artman]] who became the first president of the future Chilton Company.   In 1899 the magazine changed its name to ''Cycle &amp; Automobile Trade Journal''. A 1900 magazine masthead listed Musselman &amp; Buzby as the exclusive advertising representatives for ''Cycle &amp; Automobile Trade Journal''.  In 1900 [[George Buzby]], [[C. A. Musselman]], and James Artman merged their companies to form the ''Trade Advertising &amp; Publishing Co''.  The new company expanded into automotive catalogs, booklets, circulars, and posters.

The company selected the name ''Chilton'' from the [[Mayflower]]s passenger list. The earliest known use of the corporate name ''Chilton Company'' was in 1904. It appears on a [[corporate seal]] that reads "Chilton Company of Pennsylvania, incorporated March 31, 1904." In 1907, the three partners purchased a printing company that they renamed the ''Chilton Printing Company'', only publicly adopting the name ''Chilton Company'' in 1910.

In March 1911, Chilton published the first issue of ''Commercial Car Journal''. In February 1912, they renamed the original ''Cycle &amp; Automobile Trade Journal'' to ''Automobile Trade Journal'', and eventually merged it into [[Motor Age]] magazine.

In 1923, the partners sold Chilton to [[United Publishers Corp]] of New York for $1,635,000, and Artman and Buzby retired. In the same year, Chilton opened a new printing plant at 56th and Chestnut Streets in Philadelphia.  This location became the Chilton Company corporate headquarters in the late 1940s.

Shortly after the purchase, United Publishers merged their [[Class Journal]] subsidiary and Chilton into what became known as the ''Chilton Class Journal Co'', with C. A. Musselman as its president.  This merger brought several future flagship magazines (such as [[Iron Age]], [[Motor Age]], [[Dry Goods Economist]], [[Jewelers Circular]], [[Hardware Age]], and [[Automotive Industries (magazine)|Automotive Industries]]) into the Chilton stable of magazines.

In 1934, the company underwent a complete reorganization. [[J. Howard Pew]] provided an infusion of cash that saved the company from bankruptcy, in exchange for a majority of the stock.  All subsidiaries merged into one company and incorporated in the state of [[Delaware]] as ''Chilton Company''. While the cash infusion from J. Howard Pew saved the company, it became the single biggest inhibitor to its growth, as Pew did not permit Chilton to seek outside funding for acquisitions.  As a result, Chilton Company's growth over the next thirty years lagged behind competitors like [[McGraw Hill]] and [[Penton]].

George Buzby's son [[G. C. (Carroll) Buzby]] became president of Chilton in the early 1950s and remained the Chief Executive Officer until he retired in the late 1960s.  George C. Buzby died of cancer in 1970.

In 1979, the [[American Broadcasting Company]] purchased the Chilton Company and made it an operating unit of [[ABC Publishing]].  In 1985, [[Capital Cities Communications|Capital Cities]] purchased ABC, and in 1996 the [[Walt Disney Company]] purchased Capital Cities/ABC.  Over-extended financially by its acquisition of Capital Cities ABC, Disney had to sell assets to reduce its debt—and Chilton, despite its status and recognition as an excellent business-to-business magazine publisher, was not considered a core business.  Disney therefore decided to split up and sell the Chilton Company profit centers to multiple buyers:
* [[Reed Elsevier]] purchased the Chilton building and the magazine, trade show, and research division for $444 million in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0099-9660| last = Service| first = AP-Dow Jones News| title = Reed Elsevier Buys Chilton From ABC for $447 Million| work = Wall Street Journal| accessdate = 2016-07-12| date = 1997-06-23| url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB867056358398821000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research division was sold on to [[Taylor Nelson Sofres|Taylor Nelson AGB]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Cahners+sells+Chilton+Research+Services+to+Taylor+Nelson+AGB.-a020575815 Cahners sells Chilton Research Services to Taylor Nelson AGB]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Hearst Corporation]] purchased the Chilton professional automotive assets. In December 1999, a court injunction, effective for three years, divided those assets and rights between Hearst and Nichols Publishing.
* [[Nichols Publishing]] purchased the Chilton consumer automotive group assets and brand.

In 2001, Nichols sold the do-it-yourself automotive print manuals to [[Haynes Publishing Group]] (publishers of [[Haynes Manual]]s), while retaining licensing rights to the Chilton do-it-yourself brand for print products for 10 years.

In 2003, Nichols sold the remaining automotive assets to [[Thomson Learning]]. In 2007 Thomson Learning became [[Cengage Learning]]. In 2011, Cengage Learning became owner of the Chilton brand for do-it-yourself print manuals as well. Cengage Learning continues to publish or license the professional and consumer automotive products and assets.

== Offices ==

After acquisition by United Publishers in 1923, the corporate office moved to New York City.  In 1955, all former United Publishers magazines and their staffs relocated from New York City to the corporate headquarters at 56th and Chestnut Streets in Philadelphia. In 1968 Chilton moved their corporate offices to Decker Square in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania.  This served as temporary headquarters until 1972 when Chilton moved into its new corporate headquarters building in Radnor, Pennsylvania.

== Automobile repair manuals ==

Chilton currently publishes hundreds of automobile repair manuals that cover thousands of models. Here are some of the manufacturers covered in the Chilton do-it-yourself library:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chilton Online Auto Repair Manuals|url=http://www.chilton.cengage.com|publisher=Cengage Chilton|accessdate=2013-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fiction publishing ==
After many years of publishing business-to-business magazines and automotive manuals, Chilton acquired the trade publisher Greenberg: Publisher in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Gale Research Co| isbn = 978-0-8103-1724-6| pages = 164| editors = Peter Dzwonkoski (ed.)| last = Heininger| first = Joseph| title = American literary publishing houses, 1900-1980. Trade and paperback| chapter = Greenberg: Publisher| location = Detroit, Mich| series = Dictionary of literary biography| date = 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chilton published the celebrated [[science fiction]] novels ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' by [[Frank Herbert]] ([[1965 in literature|1965]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=It's the birthday of Frank Herbert...|work=[[The Writer's Almanac]]|date=October 8, 2013|url=http://writersalmanac.publicradio.org/index.php?date=2013/10/08|publisher=[[American Public Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Witches of Karres]]'' ([[1966 in literature|1966]]) by [[James H. Schmitz]].  Each was nominated for a [[Hugo Award for Best Novel]] in its respective year, and ''Dune'' won the award. ''Dune'' became the first of a series of six novels by Frank Herbert, which were followed by many books, mostly prequels, by his son, [[Brian Herbert]], and [[Kevin J. Anderson]], an unrelated but experienced author. Of these books, Chilton only published the first.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19575">The following tables compare general and technical information for a number of available [[Booting|boot loaders]].

==Features==
Note: The column '''MBR''' (Master Boot Record) refers to whether or not the boot loader can be stored in the first sector of a mass storage device. The column '''VBR''' (Volume Boot Record) refers to the ability of the boot loader to be stored in the first sector of any partition on a mass storage device.

[[File:Cyprianus.jpg|thumb|right|This published ''Cyprianus'' from 1916 calls itself a "dream and fortunetelling book", and it also promises an [[astrology|astrological]] [[almanac]] from [[Tycho Brahe days|Tycho Brahe]].]]
'''''Cyprianus''''' is a name given in [[Scandinavia]]n traditions of [[folk magic]] to the "black book" ("''Svarteboken"''): a [[grimoire]] or manuscript collection of [[spell (magic)|spells]]; and by extension to the magical tradition that these spells form a part of.  There is no standard text called "Cyprianus"; it was a general label given to a collection of spells.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Rustad, ''The Black Books of Elverum'' (Galde Press, 1999; {{ISBN|1-880090-75-9}})&lt;/ref&gt;  

Manuscripts called or referring to Cyprianus had a dark reputation; in some versions, you obtained the text by renouncing your baptism and devoting yourself to [[Satan]].  The common people's opinion of the book was that it was a standard grimoire concerned with the summoning of [[demon]]s and spirits.  [[Christian ministry|Ministers]] were often thought to have obtained it through their studies at university; it is not coincidence that ministers' wives often functioned as [[folk healer]]s in rural communities.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kathleen Stokker]], ''Remedies and rituals: folk medicine in Norway and the New Land'' (Minnesota Historical Society, 2007; {{ISBN|0-87351-576-5}}); ch. 5, "The Pastor as Doctor"&lt;/ref&gt;  Like many such texts, it is bound to its owner and hard to get rid of; it will not burn nor be destroyed by water, and attempting to discard it will only result in its supernatural return.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Salmonsens Konversationsleksikon]]'' (1915-1930), v. 5, pp. [http://runeberg.org/salmonsen/2/5/0387.html 386-387]&lt;/ref&gt;  These compilations nevertheless were widely circulated among the [[cunning folk]] of Scandinavia, who in a rural land with few [[physician]]s were the [[folk healer]]s sought out by ordinary people beset by injury or illness.

==Cyprianus==
"Cyprianus" is the name frequently given to the compiler or author of the spells contained in the tradition.  A variety of stories are told concerning the identity of this Cyprianus.

Saint [[Cyprian and Justina|Cyprian of Antioch]] was a bishop and martyr in early [[Christianity]].  In the Middle Ages, a variety of legends attached to his name, including a tradition that he practiced magic before his conversion, and as such was the author of a magical textbook.  In another medieval tradition, Cyprianus was a sorcerer who sought to seduce St. [[Cyprian and Justina|Justina]], but was foiled and converted when she made the sign of the cross and he followed suit, freeing himself from the power of the devil.  The sorcerer and the historical bishop were likely conflated in later legend.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Radermacher, ''Griechische Quellen zur Faustsage: Der Zauberer Cyprianus'' (Hölder-Pichler-Tempsky, 1927)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosemary Guiley, ''The encyclopedia of Magic and Alchemy''  (Infobase, 2006; {{ISBN|0-8160-6048-7}}), p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=fkc10_zCBv0C&amp;pg=PA38&amp;dq=cyprianus+magic&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=DTMLTu2hGqKqsAKR1eSnAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=cyprianus%20magic&amp;f=false 38]&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Black Books of Elverum'' claim to be a summary of a ''Cyprianus'' by a "Bishop Johannes Sell" from Oxford, England in 1682.  The British bishop [[John Fell (bishop)|John Fell]] may be the person who is meant here; Fell did publish an edition of the works of St. Cyprian.&lt;ref&gt;Rustad, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;  

The actual stories told of Cyprianus in Scandinavia often made no reference to St. Cyprian.  Some made Cyprianus into a typical [[Faust]] figure; some said that Cyprianus was a wicked Norwegian or Dane who learned magic through his dealings with the [[Devil]]; one version makes Cyprianus so evil that the Devil threw him out of [[Hell]]; Cyprianus wrote the text to have his revenge.  A different and strongly contradictory version explains that Cyprianus was a student who discovered he was attending a diabolical "black school", and wrote the text to explain how to undo all the [[witchcraft]] he learned there.&lt;ref&gt;[[Benjamin Thorpe]], ''Northern Mythology: comprising the principal popular traditions and superstitions of Scandinavia, north Germany, and the Netherlands'' (London: Edward Lumley, 1851) v. 2 pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=TTMMAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA186&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 186 et. seq.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Signekjerring.jpg|thumb|''En Signekjerring'', an 1848 painting by [[Adolph Tidemand]].  The elderly woman is performing the ''støyping'' divination ritual to seek the cause of the child's illness.]]An [[anachronism|anachronistic]] tale told in the printed [[Danish language|Danish]] spell collection ''Oldtidens Sortebog'' ("Old Time Magic Book") makes Cyprianus to have been a pious and beautiful [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[nun]] from the fourteenth century.  In a [[gothic novel|gothic]] tale, ''Oldtidens Sortebog'' has Cyprianus cast into a dungeon in 1351.  While imprisoned in the dungeon, Cyprianus rends her clothing and commits her magical knowledge to the rags, written in her own blood.  Her text was then found in an old castle.&lt;ref&gt;Stokker, above; see generally the chapter, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=YfiMGNKxmwUC&amp;pg=PT140&amp;dq=cyprianus+stokker&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=qTkLTuSiE-SosAK3t93GAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=cyprianus%20stokker&amp;f=false The Black Book]"&lt;/ref&gt;

==The spells==
The spells in the Cyprianus tradition are typical Germanic folk magic: a mixed bag of [[folk remedy|folk remedies]], [[prayer]]s, and actual magic.  They resemble the spells of the [[German language]] ''braucherei'', "[[pow-wow (folk magic)|pow-wow]]", and ''[[The Long Lost Friend]]'' traditions.  One typical spell to heal a [[sprained ankle]] went:

:''Jesus rei over ei hei&lt;br&gt;Fållån snåva og foten vrei&lt;br&gt;Jesus steig av og la foten an&lt;br&gt;som den tilforn var&lt;br&gt;i namnet Gud, Fader, Sønn, og Helligånd''

::"Jesus rode over a stony plain.&lt;br&gt;His horse stumbled, its leg it did sprain.&lt;br&gt;Jesus dismounted to cure the pain&lt;br&gt;And made he injury good again.&lt;br&gt;In the name of God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost."&lt;ref&gt;Stokker, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

The methods of [[Infectious disease|contagion]] and [[transference]] are in use here; a sacred personage in an apocryphal story is confronted with a problem similar to that faced by the actual sufferer, who avails himself of their supernatural aid.&lt;ref&gt;Stokker, pp. 90-93&lt;/ref&gt;

An important aspect of the magical tradition was the performance of [[divination]], often by pouring molten [[lead]] through a hole in a piece of [[flatbread]] into cold water, a practice called ''[[molybdomancy|støyping]]''.  Lead scraped from the windows of churches was often used for this purpose.   This was done to divine the cause of [[rickets]], which was often thought to be the result of a [[changeling]], a ''huldrabarn'' or ''bytting'', left in the place of a healthy child by the malicious ''[[huldra|huldra-folk]]''.  The diviner in this ritual was called a ''signekjerring'', a "blessing crone".&lt;ref&gt;Stokker, ch. "Rickets remedies and lore"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inexperienced use of the Black Book==
The Inexperienced Use of the Black Book is a motif in [[Scandinavian folklore]]. In such legends, a servant, maid or someone else unexpectedly happens to find and read the Black Book, thus summoning the devil, while the owner, often a clergyman, is away. The only way to save oneself is to give the devil [[adynaton|a task that he can’t solve]]: to empty a fjord, to untie all knots in a fishing net, to twist a rope of sand, to row against the wind with a boat filled with empty buckets, etc.. The devil is then kept busy until the expert or the owner of the book returns and exorcises the devil away. It is given an ML (Migratory Legend) number of 3020 and is related to [[Aarne-Thompson]] type 325, "Apprentice and Ghost" and type 565, "The Magic Mill".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William F. Hansen|title=Ariadne's thread: a guide to international tales found in classical literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ezDlXl7gP9oC&amp;pg=PA36|year=2002|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-3670-3|pages=36–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6866">'''DNSChanger''' is a [[DNS hijacking]] [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/threats/malware-encyclopedia-description?name=trojan:win32/dnschanger.o Trojan:Win32/Dnschanger.O] – Microsoft&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/fdde13872caa1a0e1b9331188ca93b8fc424fed43d86d5cf53f6965f6a77184e/analysis/ |title=Antivirus scan for fdde13872caa1a0e1b9331188ca93b8fc424fed43d86d5cf53f6965f6a77184e] at 2017-01-30 04:47:37 UTC – VirusTotal|website=www.virustotal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of an Estonian company known as [[Rove Digital]], the malware infected computers by modifying a computer's [[Domain Name System|DNS]] entries to point toward its own [[DNS_hijacking#Rogue_DNS_server|rogue]] [[name server]]s, which then injected its own advertising into Web pages. At its peak, DNSChanger was estimated to have infected over four million computers, bringing in at least [[United States dollar|US$]]14 million in profits to its operator from fraudulent advertising revenue.&lt;ref name="ars-massive"/&gt;

Both [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Mac OS X]] variants of DNSChanger were circulated, the latter taking the form of a related Trojan known as [[RSPlug]]. The FBI raided the malicious servers on November 8, 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/esthost-taken-down-biggest-cybercriminal-takedown-in-history/|title=Esthost Taken Down – Biggest Cybercriminal Takedown in History – TrendLabs Security Intelligence Blog|date=9 November 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they kept the servers up after they captured it to avoid affected users from losing internet access until July 9, 2012.

==Operation==
DNSChanger was distributed as a [[drive-by download]] claiming to be a [[video codec]] needed to view content on a Web site, particularly appearing on rogue [[Internet pornography in the United States|pornography sites]]. Once installed, the malware then modified the system's [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) configuration, pointing them to rogue [[name server]]s operated through affiliates of Rove Digital.&lt;ref name="ars-massive"/&gt; These rogue name servers primarily substituted [[Internet marketing|advertising]] on Web pages with advertising sold by Rove. Additionally, the rogue DNS server [[Clickjacking|redirected links]] to certain Web sites to those of advertisers, such as for example, redirecting the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] Web site to that of a [[tax preparation]] company.&lt;ref name=pcworld-dontlose/&gt; The effects of DNSChanger could also spread itself to other computers within a [[Local area network|LAN]] by mimicking a [[DHCP]] server, pointing other computers toward the rogue DNS servers.&lt;ref name=pcworld-dontlose/&gt; In its indictment against Rove, the [[United States Department of Justice]] also reported that the rogue servers had blocked access to update servers for [[antivirus software]].&lt;ref name=ars-sevencharged/&gt;

==Shutdown and interim DNS servers==
On October 1, 2011, as part of ''Operation Ghost Click'' (a collaborative investigation into the operation), the [[United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York]] announced charges against six Estonian nationals and one Russian national connected to DNSChanger and Rove Digital for [[wire fraud]], [[computer intrusion]], and [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]].&lt;ref name=ars-sevencharged&gt;{{cite web|title=Seven charged in malware-driven click fraud case|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/11/seven-charged-in-botnet-driven-click-fraud-case/|publisher=Ars Technica|accessdate=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arrests were made by Estonian authorities, and servers connected to the malware located in the United States were seized by the [[FBI]].&lt;ref name=ars-massive&gt;{{cite web|title=How the most massive botnet scam ever made millions for Estonian hackers|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/11/how-the-most-massive-botnet-scam-ever-made-millions-for-estonian-hackers/|publisher=Ars Technica|accessdate=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Due to concerns by FBI agents that users still infected by DNSChanger could lose Internet access if the rogue DNS servers were shut down entirely, a temporary [[court order]] was obtained to allow the [[Internet Systems Consortium]] to operate replacement servers, which would serve DNS requests from those who had not yet removed the infection, and to collect information on those still infected in order to promptly notify them about the presence of the malware.&lt;ref name=dnschanger-dark&gt;{{cite web|title=‘DNSChanger’ Malware Could Strand Thousands When Domains Go Dark on Monday|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/07/dns-changer-going-dark/|publisher=Wired|accessdate=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the court order was set to expire on March 8, 2012, an extension was granted until July 9, 2012 due to concerns that there were still many infected computers.&lt;ref name=pcworld-dontlose&gt;{{cite web|title=Don't Lose the Internet in July! FBI Repeats DNSChanger Warning|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2403364,00.asp|publisher=PC World|accessdate=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[F-Secure]] estimated on July 4, 2012 that at least 300,000 computers were still infected with the DNSChanger malware, 70,000 of which were located in the United States. &lt;ref name=pcw-infected&gt;{{cite web|title=Are You Infected With DNSChanger Malware?|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2406720,00.asp|publisher=PC World|accessdate=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interim DNS servers were officially shut down by the FBI on July 9, 2012.&lt;ref name=pcw-impact/&gt;

Impact from the shutdown was considered to be minimal, due in part to major [[Internet service providers]] providing temporary DNS services of their own and support to customers affected by DNSChanger. and informational campaigns surrounding the malware and the impending shutdown. These included online tools that could check for the presence of DNSChanger, while [[Google]] and [[Facebook]] provided notifications to visitors of their respective services who were still affected by the malware.&lt;ref name=pcw-infected/&gt; By July 9, 2012, F-Secure estimated that the number of remaining DNSChanger infections in the U.S. had dropped from 70,000 to 42,000.&lt;ref name=pcw-impact&gt;{{cite web|title=ISPs Report Minimal DNSChanger Impact|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2406855,00.asp|publisher=PC World|accessdate=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[wikisource:Dada Manifesto (1916, Hugo Ball)|Dada Manifesto]]''' (in French, '''Le Manifeste DaDa''') is a short text that was written on July 14, 1916 by [[Hugo Ball]] and read the same day at the ''Waag Hall'' in [[Zurich]], for the first public [[Dada]] party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Motherwell|first1=Robert|title=The Dada painters and poets; an anthology.|date=1951|publisher=Wittenborn, Schultz|location=New York|OCLC=1906000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this [[manifesto]], Hugo Ball expresses his opposition to Dada becoming an artistic movement. He stayed active in the Dada movement for another six months, but the manifesto created conflict with his friends, notably [[Tristan Tzara]].

'''Ephebiphobia''' is the fear of youth.  First coined as the "fear or loathing of teenagers",&lt;ref name="Astroth, K. 1994"&gt;Astroth, K. (1994) Beyond ephebiphobia: problem adults or problem youths? (fear of adolescents). ''Phi Delta Kappan''. January 1, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; today the [[phenomenon]] is recognized as the "inaccurate, exaggerated and sensational characterization of young people" in a range of settings around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, A.M. and Summers, R.W. (2001) ''Teen Violence: A Global View.'' Greenwood Press. p 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of the fear of youth occur in [[sociology]] and [[youth studies]].

==Lexicology==
===Coinage===
The word ''ephebiphobia'' is formed from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἔφηβος}} ''[[ephebos|éphēbos]]'', meaning "[[youth]]" or "[[adolescent]]" and {{lang|el|φόβος}} ''phóbos'', meaning "fear" or "[[phobia]]". The coinage of this term is attributed to a 1994 article by Kirk Astroth published in ''[[Phi Delta Kappan]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gough, P. (2000) "Detoxifying Schools." ''Phi Delta Kappan''. March 1, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, common usage occurs internationally by sociologists, government agencies,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stop-discrimination.info/6423.0.html?&amp;no_cache=1&amp;mc_glossary%5Bcategories%5D=1 European Union's Stop Discrimination website - Glossary on age] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060518000000/http://www.stop-discrimination.info/6423.0.html?&amp;no_cache=1&amp;mc_glossary%5Bcategories%5D=1 |date=May 18, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and youth advocacy organizations that define ephebiphobia as an abnormal or irrational and persistent [[fear]] or loathing of teenagers or [[adolescence]].&lt;ref&gt;Grønnestad-Damur, W. &amp; Pratch, L. (n.d.) [https://web.archive.org/web/20060323044035/http://albertalibraryconference.com/2005/presentations/C4_ephibiphobia2.pdf ''No Ephebiphobia Here!''] Edmonton: Edmonton Public Library.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark, C. (2004) ''Hurt: Inside the World of Today's Teenagers (Youth, Family, and Culture).'' Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Book House.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Similar terms===
The term paedophobia has gained popular acceptance in Europe to describe the aforementioned "fear of youth".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ippr.org/pressreleases/archive.asp?id=2388&amp;fID=173 Childhood is changing, but "paedophobia" makes things worse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070904052625/http://www.ippr.org/pressreleases/archive.asp?id=2388&amp;fID=173 |date=2007-09-04 }} Institute for Public Policy Research. 22 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Waiton, S. (2006) [http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php?/site/article/2032/ ''The Roots of Paedophobia'']. Online.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pediaphobia]] is the fear of infants and children. ''Hebephobia'' (from the Greek {{lang|grc|ἥβη}}, ''hḗbē'', "youth, puberty") has also been proposed{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}. Similar terms include [[adultism]], which is a predisposition towards adults that is biased against children and youth, and [[ageism]], which describes discrimination against any person because of their age.

==History==
The fear of youth, along with fear of [[urban culture|street culture]] and the [[fear of crime]], is said to have been in [[Western culture]] for "time immemorial".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pearson |first=G. |year=1983 |title=Hooligan: A History of Respectable Fears |location=London |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |page=236 |isbn=0-333-23399-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Machiavelli]] is said to have realized that a fear of youth is what kept the city of [[Florence]] from keeping a standing army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Trexler |first=R. C. |year=1980 |title=Public Life in Renaissance Florence |location=Ithaca |publisher=Cornell University Press |page=390 |isbn=0-8014-2694-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient [[Venice]] and [[ancient Greece]] are also said to have had floundering public policy because of their fear of youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Garland |first=Robert |year=1993 |title=Review of ''Ancient Youth: The Ambiguity of Youth and the Absence of Adolescence in Greco-Roman Society'' by M. Kleijwegt |journal=[[Journal of Hellenic Studies]] |volume=113 |issue= |pages=204–205 |jstor=632438 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Strauss |first=B. |year=1993 |title=Fathers and Sons in Athens: Ideology and Society in the Era of the Peloponnesian War |location=London |publisher=Routledge |page=16 |isbn=0-415-04146-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early American [[Puritan]]ism has been seen as reliant on a fear of youth, who were seen as embodying [[adventure]] and enlightenment, and therefore were viewed as susceptible to "decadent [[morality]]".&lt;ref&gt;Meily, C. (1911) ''Puritanism.'' C. H. Kerr &amp; Company. p 118.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Industrial Revolution]],  [[Western Europe]]an and [[North America]]n popular media was particularly driven to propagate the [[fear of children]] and youth in order to further the [[industrialization]] of schooling,&lt;ref&gt;[[John Taylor Gatto|Gatto, J.T.]], (2001) ''The Underground History of American Education.'' Oxford Village Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually to remove young people from the workplace when their [[child labor|labor]] became unnecessary due to [[mechanization]] and the influx of new labor.&lt;ref&gt;Savage, J. (2007) ''Teenage: The Creation of Youth Culture.'' Viking Adult.&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-[[World War II]] [[France]] was said to have been stricken by concern for ''mal de jeunesse'' when they created policies that reflected their fear of youth. "Send them to summer camps, place others in reformatories, the rest should have some fresh air, build some athletic fields...". were the intentions of youth policies in that era.&lt;ref&gt;Jobs, R.I. (2007) ''Riding the New Wave: Youth and the Rejuvenation of France After the Second World War''. Stanford University Press. p 230&lt;/ref&gt; Following World War II the United States military identified the growing number of youth in the [[Deep South]] as a problematic scenario for [[national security]]. Analysts have suggested the upswing in the popular culture's fear of youth may be attributed to defense policies created in response to that threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Angela Davis |first=Angela |last=Davis |chapter=The 'Youth Bulge' in the South |editor-last=Silliman |editor-first=J. |editor2-last=Bhattacharjee |editor2-first=A. |editor3-last=Davis |editor3-first=A.

"In the 1990s public fear of adolescents mounted", caused by the "increased youth access to [[handgun]]s, the [[Syndicate|syndicatization]] of territorial youth [[gang]]s into illegal [[drug cartel]]s, racist [[stereotype|stereotyping]] of urban youth, academic and political pandering, media frenzy, and a spate of high-profile [[school shooting]]s of students by their fellow students".&lt;ref&gt;Rosenheim, M.K., Zimring, F.E. and Tanenhaus, D.S. (2002) ''A Century of Juvenile Justice.'' University of Chicago Press. p 282.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Seattle Weekly]]'' specifically cited the fear of youth as the driving factor behind [[Seattle, Washington]]'s now-defunct [[Teen Dance Ordinance]].&lt;ref&gt;Parrish, G. (1999). [http://www.seattleweekly.com/news/9908/impolitics-parrish.php "Fear of Youth"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515082519/http://www.seattleweekly.com/news/9908/impolitics-parrish.php |date=2013-05-15 }}, ''Seattle Weekly.'' February 29, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The government of Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] introduced the [[Anti-Social Behaviour Order]] in 1998, which has also been attributed directly to a fear of youth.&lt;ref&gt;Street-Porter, J. (2005) "[http://comment.independent.co.uk/columnists_m_z/janet_street_porter/article613.ece The Politicians Fear of Youth Culture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930155733/http://comment.independent.co.uk/columnists_m_z/janet_street_porter/article613.ece |date=2007-09-30 }}", ''The Independent'' April 7, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mass media|Media]], marketers, politicians, [[youth work]]ers and researchers have been implicated in perpetuating the fear of youth.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, A. (2006) ''[http://www.commonaction.org/WYVH.pdf Washington Youth Voice Handbook] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414023902/http://www.commonaction.org/WYVH.pdf |date=2008-04-14 }}''. CommonAction. p 11. Retrieved 6/3/08.&lt;/ref&gt; Since young people in [[developed country|developed countries]] are expected to stay out of the workforce, any role for them outside that of [[consumer]] is potentially threatening to adults.&lt;ref&gt;Sternheimer, K. (2006) ''Kids These Days: Facts and Fictions about Today's Youth''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield. p 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Selling safety to parents and teachers has also been a driving force, as home security systems, cellphones, and [[computer surveillance]] usage is marketed to parents; and [[x-ray]] machines, [[metal detector]]s and [[closed-circuit television]] are increasingly sold to schools on the premise that young people are not to be trusted. These steps are in spite of the fact that experience consistently shows that monitoring youth does little to prevent violence or tragedy: the [[Columbine High School massacre]] occurred in a building with video surveillance and in-building police.&lt;ref&gt;Sternheimer, K. (2006) p 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

The very creation of the terms [[youth]], [[adolescence]] and [[teenager]] have all been attributed to the fear of youth.&lt;ref&gt;Savage, J. (2007) ''Teenage: The Creation of Youth 1875-1945.'' Chatto &amp; Windus.&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[western world]] became more industrialized, young people were increasingly driven from the [[workforce]], including [[child labor|involuntary]] and voluntary positions, and into increasingly [[total institution]]s where they lost personal autonomy in favor of [[social control]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Taylor Gatto|Gatto, J.T.]]. (2001) ''The Underground History of American Education.'' Oxford Village Press. p 306.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Breeding, J. (2002) ''True nature and great misunderstandings: On How We Care for Our Children.'' Virtualbookworm Publishing. p 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Government policies outside of schools have been implicated as well, as over the last forty years [[curfew]]s, anti-[[loitering]] and anti-[[cruising (driving)|cruising]] laws, and other legislation apparently targeted at teenagers have taken hold across the country. Courts have increasingly ruled against [[youth rights]], as well.&lt;ref&gt;Lauter, P. and Howe, P. (1971) ''The conspiracy of the young.'' Meridian. p 304.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, R. (2007) ''The case against adolescence''. Quill Driver Books. p 323.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the 1940s "teenagers" were not listed in newspaper headlines, because as a group they did not exist. The impact of youth since [[World War II]] on western society has been immense, largely driven by marketing that proponents them as the "[[Other (philosophy)|Other]]". In turn, youth are caused to behave in ways that appear different from adults. This has led to the phenomenon of youth, and in turn has created a perpetuated fear of them.&lt;ref&gt;Palladino, G. (1996) ''Teenagers: An American perspective.'' BasicBooks. p 247.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
The fear of youth is thought to exist throughout the entire [[Western world]].&lt;ref&gt;Konopka, G. (1983) ''Social Group Work: A Helping Process.'' Prentice Hall. p 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist [[Ray Oldenburg]] has attributed the [[generation gap]] and the "increasing segregation of youth from adults in [[American society]]" to "adult estrangement and fear of youth".&lt;ref&gt;Oldenburg, R. (1999) ''The Great Good Place: Cafés, Coffee Shops, Bookstores, Bars, Hair Salons.'' Marlowe &amp; Company. p xx.&lt;/ref&gt; 

At least one major economist has proposed that the fear of youth can have grave effects on the economic health of nations.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, D. (1999) [http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9909/15/euro.risks.idg/ ''Negroponte: Europe's Net development held back by fear of youth, risk taking''] CNN. September 15, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; A growing number of researchers report that the fear of youth affects the health of [[democracy]], reporting that the consequential vilification of youth has in the past, and continues to presently undermine public,&lt;ref&gt;Jones, P., Shoemaker, S. Chelton, M. (2001) ''Do It Right! Best Practices for Serving Young Adults in School and Public Libraries'' New York: Neal-Schuman Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; social, political,&lt;ref&gt;[[Lawrence Grossberg]], (2005) ''Caught In The Crossfire: Kids, Politics, And America's Future (Cultural Politics &amp; the Promise of Democracy)'' New York: Paradigm Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; religious,&lt;ref&gt;Rice, W. (1998) ''Junior High Ministry: A Guide to Early Adolescence for Youth Workers.'' Zondervan Publishing. p 15.&lt;/ref&gt; and cultural&lt;ref&gt;Giroux, H. (2004) ''Take Back High Education: Race, Youth, and the Crisis of Democracy in the post-Civil Rights Era'' New York: Palgrave&lt;/ref&gt; participation among current and future generations.

As it affects young people themselves, ephebiphobia has been recognized as a barrier towards successful academic achievement,&lt;ref&gt;Butts, P.M. (2000) ''Beyond Ephebiphobia: Overcoming the Fear of Middle &amp; High School Students; A Program for Public Librarians.'' Macatawa, MI: Macatawa Public Library.&lt;/ref&gt; a barrier to successful social intervention programs,&lt;ref name="Astroth, K. 1994"/&gt; and as an indicator of the ineptitude of many adults to be successful parents.&lt;ref&gt;Coontz, S. (1999) ''The Way We Really Are: Coming to Terms With America's Changing Families.'' New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social discrimination===
"Today citizens as a whole as well as people who work with children live in fear of youth in our homes and schools and on our streets".&lt;ref&gt;Bender, S.J., Neutens, J., Skonie-Hardin, S., et al. (1997) ''Teaching health science: Elementary and middle school.'' Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers. p 7.&lt;/ref&gt; While "society loves their attractive bodies, [[youth]]fulness and commercial firepower", we also "vilify adolescents as a noncontributing drain on the economy and our democracy". In the mainstream media, young people are most often portrayed as self-absorbed and [[Apathy|apathetic]], uninterested in the common good or in advancing social goals.&lt;ref&gt;Jee, K. and Sherman, R. (2006) [http://www.ncl.org/publications/ncr/95-1/fulltext1.pdf "Youth as important civic actors: From the margins to the center"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515151632/http://www.ncl.org/publications/ncr/95-1/fulltext1.pdf |date=2008-05-15 }}, ''National Civic Review. 95'';1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many social programs and social critics view the fear of youth as a condemning force against youth throughout society, particularly when coupled with [[racism]].&lt;ref&gt;Delgado, M. (2001) ''Where are All the Young Men and Women of Color?'' Columbia University Press. p 231.&lt;/ref&gt; Poet [[Gwendolyn Brooks]] was applauded for her consciousness-raising work around the fear of youth, particularly young African-Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Levingston, K. (2001) [http://www.brennancenter.org/content/resource/new_statistics_puncture_myth_of_violent_kids/ "New Statistics Puncture Myth of Violent Kids"], ''Philadelphia Inquirer.'' January 6, 2001. Retrieved 5/9/08.&lt;/ref&gt; Popular contemporary beliefs about adolescents are different from historical narratives; in the past youth were portrayed as "the future" and the "leaders of tomorrow"; today they are seen as "a source of worry, not potential," contributing to a fear of adolescents, especially racial and ethnic minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zeldin |first=S. |year=2002 |title=Sense of community and positive adult beliefs toward adolescents and youth policy in urban neighborhoods and small cities |journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=331–342 |doi=10.1023/A:1015624507644 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In turn this [[racism|racist]] and [[adultism|adultist]] perspective informs urban law enforcement,&lt;ref&gt;Males, M.

(2007) "Ephebiphobia," p 130 in Abram, S. ''Out Front with Stephen Abram: A Guide for Information Leaders.'' ALA Editions.&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologists have suggested that much of the current spread of the fear of youth is due to "adult anxiety over the shifting racial mix in the general population".&lt;ref&gt;Rapping, E. (2003) ''Law and Justice as Seen on TV.'' NYU Press. p 208.&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of [[sexism]] are similarly reported to be amplified by ephebiphobia.&lt;ref&gt;Bromwich, R.J. (2002) ''[http://www.owjn.org/issues/equality/girls.htm#_ftn1 Beyond Villains and Victims: Some Thoughts on Youth and Violence in Canada].'' Toronto, ON: Women's Justice Network.&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[New York University]] professor Pedro Noguera has suggested that the fear of youth extends beyond color boundaries, as "[[skateboard]]ers, [[punk subculture|punks]], even straight-laced [[suburb]]an teenagers can evoke anxiety among adults by congregating in large numbers in places deemed off-limits to youth".&lt;ref&gt;Noguera, P. (2003) ''City Schools and the American Dream: Reclaiming the Promise of Public Education.'' Teachers College Press. p 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability of youth to [[youth participation|participate]] throughout society is seen as compromised because of the fear of youth, and is often disguised as a [[paternalism]] or protectionism among adults.&lt;ref&gt;Fredman, S. and Spencer, S. (2003) ''Age as an Equality Issue.'' Hart Publishing. p 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, scholar [[Henry Jenkins]], "links criticism of new media with fear of adolescents, who are the most eager adopters. [[Youth subculture|Teen culture]] seems meaningless and dangerous without an appreciation of its context".&lt;ref&gt;Tushnet, R. ([http://www.law.virginia.edu/pdf/workshops/0708/tushnet.pdf "Volunteers from the Audience: Audience Interests and the First Amendment,"] Georgetown University Law Center. p 3., footnote 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commercial gain===
Academics specifically acknowledge the force of ephebiphobia in the [[commerce|commercial sector]], where this fear of youth has been extensively exploited for financial gain.&lt;ref&gt;Palladino, G. (1997) ''Teenagers: An American History.'' New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; This is elaborated on by researchers and social critics who claim that popular media, including [[Film|cinema]] and [[television]], specifically exacerbated society's fear of youth for financial gain,&lt;ref&gt;"Studios caught in teen-age dilemmas Multiplex issues," Worcester Telegram &amp; Gazette (MA), July 20, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shary, T. (2002). ''Generation Multiplex: The Image of Youth in Contemporary American Cinema.'' Austin: University of Texas Press. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Giroux, H. (1999) ''The Mouse that Roared: Disney and the End of Innocence''. New York: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; as one study reports, "Extreme fear of youth is an established [[media panic]]".&lt;ref&gt;Hope, A. and Oliver, P. (2005) ''Risk, education and culture.'' Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. p 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pulp novel]]s in the 1950s were mass-produced to specifically cash in on the growing fear of youth that was spreading throughout society.&lt;ref&gt;Shary, T. (2005) ''Teen Movies: American Youth on Screen.'' Wallflower Press. p 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, it has also been said that popular media's effects on young people are not as powerful as the fear of youth, which drives the fear of technology and in turn perpetuates the fear of youth.&lt;ref&gt;Sternhiemer, S. (2003) ''It's Not the Media: The Truth about Pop Culture's Influence on Children.'' Westview Press. p 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governmental policy===
Decision-making by [[government]] agencies, including [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]], [[police|policing]] and [[court]]s, have been found to be driven by the fear of youth.&lt;ref&gt;Giroux, H. (2003) ''The Abandoned Generation: Democracy beyond the culture of fear.'' New York: Palgrave.&lt;/ref&gt; The fear of adolescents has been said to cause a disjunction between what is said about the value of young people and what is done to them in education and social services, and causes them to be seen, "primarily as threats—to persons, to institutions, to [[status quo]]".&lt;ref&gt;Beker, J. and Magnuson, D. (1996) ''Residential Education as an Option for At-Risk Youth.'' Haworth Press. p 60.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of observers have indicated the deliberate perpetuation of mass social ephebiphobia in order to elicit particular public and social responses. [[United States|American]] sociologist [[Mike Males]] has identified trends among politicians and policy-makers of stoking the fear of youth among society in order to make headway in [[political campaign]]s and build popular support for otherwise "generate media sensation and public fear".&lt;ref&gt;Males, M. (2001) [http://www.nospank.net/males2.htm "Lies, Damn Lies, and 'Youth Risk' Surveys"] ''Youth Today''. April 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the fear of youth has been identified as the driving factor behind many governmental programs designed to combat so-called "youth violence," in which the actions of few youth are attributed to the population of youth in general.&lt;ref&gt;Barak, G. (2003) ''Violence and Nonviolence: Pathways to Understanding''. Sage Publications Inc. p 132.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collins, J., Noble, G., and Poynting, B. (2000) ''Kebabs, Kids, Cops and Crime: Youth, Ethnicity and Crime.'' Pluto Press Australia. p 122.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walgrave, L. and Bazemore, B. (1999) ''Restorative Juvenile Justice: Repairing the Harm of Youth Crime.'' Criminal Justice Press. p 192.&lt;/ref&gt; In a specific instance, "In [[Dallas]], fear of youth led to accelerated surveillance and policing, particularly in its poorest area, [[Gaston Park|Gaston]]".&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, D. (2005) ''Inventing Black-on-Black Violence: Discourse, Space, and Representation.'' Syracuse University Press. p 144.&lt;/ref&gt; The fear of adolescents is also said to have caused many governments to lower their [[age of criminal responsibility]] and escalate the detention of young people from childhood through [[adult]]hood.&lt;ref&gt;Susskind, A. (1987) "Issues in Institutional Child Sexual Abuse The Abused, the Abuser, and the System," '' Residential Treatment for Children &amp; Youth. 4'';2. p 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
Examining the [[Black Power]] movement of the 1970s, one researcher wrote, "The common adult dislike and fear of youth is compounded by the teacher's fear—fear of losing control in the classroom, fear of losing one's authority".&lt;ref&gt;Ornstein, A.C. (1972) ''Urban Education: Student Unrest, Teacher Behaviors, and Black Power.'' Charles E. Merrill Publishing Co. p 73.&lt;/ref&gt; A specific increase in the fear of youth in schools following the [[Columbine High School massacre]] of 1999 is seen as a particular cause in evidence suggesting an overall decrease in [[student engagement]] throughout [[high school]]s today.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, N. (2004) ''American Youth Cultures.'' Routledge. p 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Fear of youth has led to the development of [[zero tolerance]] policies in many schools,&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, W. and Drew, J. (2006) ''Punishing Schools: Fear And Citizenship In American Public Education.'' University of Michigan Press. p 4.&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn is attributed as the cause of the increase in arrests for [[Juvenile delinquency|juvenile crime]] on school campuses, which has promoted the fear of youth and led school administrators to call [[police]] for infractions once dealt with internally.&lt;ref&gt;Acland, C.R. (1995) ''Youth, Murder, Spectacle: The Cultural Politics of "youth in crisis".'' Westview Press. p 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Combating ephebiphobia==
The [[American Library Association]] has developed a resource collection for [[library|librarians]] specifically to combat the ephebiphobia by promoting [[customer service]] skills specific to youth.&lt;ref&gt;ALA President's Program. (1994) "Beyond Ephebiphobia: A tool chest for customer service to young adults". American Library Association.&lt;/ref&gt; However, sociologist Mike Males has suggested that ephebiphobia does not analyze the problem deep enough, as the fear of adult [[stereotype]] of [[adolescence]], or kourophobia, is the core challenge facing young people today.&lt;ref&gt;Males, M. (1999) ''Framing Youth: 10 myths about the next generation.'' Common Courage Press. p 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''HMAS ''Onslow'' (SS 60/SSG 60)''' was one of six {{sclass-|Oberon|submarine}}s operated by the [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN). The submarine was named after the town of [[Onslow, Western Australia]], and Sir [[Alexander Onslow]], with the boat's motto and [[ship's badge|badge]] derived from Onslow's family heritage. Ordered in 1963, ''Onslow'' was laid down at the end of 1967 by [[Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company]] in Scotland, launched almost a year later, and commissioned into the RAN at the end of 1968.

Although never involved in war, three major incidents occurred during ''Onslow''{{'}}s career. The first occurred in 1972, when a disgruntled sailor who disobeyed orders caused the submarine to dive to almost twice her [[test depth|safe operating depth]].&lt;ref name=curtispride/&gt; As a result, the RAN changed the [[Royal Australian Navy Submarine Service|Submarine Service]] from being able to "conscript" any sailor for submarine service to volunteer only.&lt;ref name=curtispride/&gt; The second happened in 1981, when [[carbon monoxide]] fumes from one of the diesel generators filled the submarine, resulting in the death of one sailor.&lt;ref name=Sundaynight/&gt; Although changes were made to submarine operating procedures, the boat's company was not provided with any psychological counselling, and the incident report remained classified until 2009.&lt;ref name=Sundaynight/&gt; The third was a controversial [[line-crossing ceremony]] in 1995, which resulted in restrictions being placed on similar ceremonies aboard RAN vessels.&lt;ref name=AAPnoDis/&gt;&lt;ref name=AAMH/&gt; During her career, ''Onslow'' became the first conventionally powered submarine to be fitted with anti-ship missiles, and was successful in wargames: "sinking" a seven-ship flotilla during Exercise Kangaroo 3 in 1980, and the United States supercarrier {{USS|Carl Vinson|CVN-70|6}} at [[RIMPAC]] 1998.&lt;ref name=curtispride/&gt;&lt;ref name=White202/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lind303/&gt;&lt;ref name=jollyroger/&gt;

''Onslow'' was decommissioned in 1999, and was presented to the [[Australian National Maritime Museum]], where she is preserved as a museum ship.

==Design and construction==
''Onslow'' was one of four ''Oberon''-class submarines ordered in 1963.&lt;ref name=Janes96/&gt; The last of this group, ''Onslow'' was laid down by Scotts Shipbuilding &amp; Engineering Co. in Greenock, Scotland on 4 December 1967.&lt;ref name=Janes96/&gt; She was launched by [[Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy]] on 3 December 1968, and commissioned into the RAN on 22 December 1969.&lt;ref name=White199&gt;White, ''Australian submarines'', p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; The boat was named after the coastal town of [[Onslow, Western Australia]], which was in turn named after Sir [[Alexander Onslow]], the third [[Chief Justice of Western Australia]].&lt;ref name=White199/&gt; ''Onslow''{{'}}s motto, ''[[Festina Lente]]'' (Latin for "Hasten Slowly"), is shared with the [[Earl of Onslow|Onslow family]], and the [[ship's badge]] contains a judge's wig.&lt;ref name=White200&gt;White, ''Australian submarines'', p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; Although this was the only use of the name by the RAN, two surface ships of the Royal Navy have previously been named {{HMS|Onslow}}.&lt;ref name=White199/&gt;

[[File:HMAS Onslow nameplate.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A rectangular plaque mounted on a bulkhead. The plaque reads "H.M.A.S. "Onslow". Engine no 798. Scotts' Shipbuilding &amp; Engineering Co Ltd. Greenock. 1969"|The builders' plaque for ''Onslow'']]
The submarine is {{convert|295.2|ft|m}} long, with a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|26.5|ft|m}}, and a [[Draught (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|18|ft|m}} when surfaced.&lt;ref name=Janes96/&gt; At full load [[Displacement (nautical)|displacement]], ''Onslow'' displaces 2,030&amp;nbsp;tons when surfaced, and 2,410&amp;nbsp;tons when submerged.&lt;ref name=Janes96/&gt; The two propeller shafts are each driven by an [[English Electric]] motor providing 3,500&amp;nbsp;[[brake horsepower]] and 4,500&amp;nbsp;[[shaft horsepower]]; the electricity for these is generated by two Admiralty Standard Range supercharged V16 diesel generators.&lt;ref name=Shaw15/&gt; These could propel the submarine at up to {{convert|12|kn}} on the surface, and up to {{convert|17|kn}} when submerged.&lt;ref name=Janes96/&gt; ''Onslow'' had a maximum range of {{convert|9000|nmi}} at {{convert|12|kn}}, and a [[test depth]] of {{convert|200|m|ft}} below sea level.&lt;ref name=Janes96/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shaw15/&gt; When launched, the boat had a company of 8 officers and 56 sailors, but by the time she decommissioned, the number of sailors had increased to 60.&lt;ref name=Janes96/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shaw15/&gt; In addition, up to 16 trainees could be carried.&lt;ref name=Shaw15/&gt;

Unlike other submarines in her class, ''Onslow'' was fitted with a four-man diver access hatch, allowing for easier deployment and recovery of special forces divers.&lt;ref name=Shaw10&gt;Shaw, ''HMAS Onslow'', p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Armament===
The main armament of ''Onslow'' was six {{convert|21|in|cm|adj=on}} bow torpedo tubes, capable of firing torpedoes or releasing sea mines.&lt;ref name=Janes96/&gt; The [[British 21 inch torpedo#21 inch Mark VIII|British Mark 8 torpedo]] was initially carried by the submarine; this was replaced by the [[Wire-guided torpedo|wire-guided]] [[British 21 inch torpedo#21 inch Mark 23 Grog|Mark 23]].&lt;ref name=Shaw21&gt;Shaw, ''HMAS Onslow'', p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; During a refit from 1982 to 1984, ''Oberon'' became the first conventionally powered submarine in the world to be fitted with anti-ship missiles; specifically the [[Boeing Harpoon|UGM-84 Sub Harpoon]].&lt;ref name=White202/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lind303/&gt; At the same time, the Mark 23 torpedoes were replaced by the [[Mark 48 torpedo|United States Mark 48]] wire-guided torpedo.&lt;ref name=White202/&gt; As of 1996, the standard payload of ''Onslow'' was a mix of 20 Mark 48 Mod 4 torpedoes and Sub Harpoon missiles.&lt;ref name=Janes96/&gt; Some or all of the torpedo payload could be replaced by [[Stonefish (mine)|Mark 5 Stonefish]] sea mines, which were deployed through the torpedo tubes.&lt;ref name=Shaw21/&gt;

The submarine's secondary armament consisted of two stern-mounted, short-length {{convert|21|in|cm|adj=on}} torpedo tubes: these were intended for use against pursuing submarines, but the development of steerable wire-guided torpedoes shortly after the boat entered service made these redundant, and they were closed off during the 1982-84 refit.&lt;ref name=Shaw19&gt;Shaw, ''HMAS Onslow'', p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; The aft tubes fired [[Mark 20 Bidder|Mark 20]] anti-submarine torpedoes.&lt;ref name=Shaw19/&gt;

==Operational history==

===1970–1981===
''Onslow'' arrived in Sydney at the conclusion of her delivery voyage to Australia on 4 July 1970.&lt;ref name=White200/&gt; On board was Vice Admiral Sir [[Victor Smith]], at the time the [[Chief of Navy (Australia)|Chief of Naval Staff]], who had embarked at Brisbane.&lt;ref name=White200/&gt; The boat visited [[Pearl Harbor]] later that year; arriving without being detected by the USN until she surfaced in the middle of the harbour.&lt;ref&gt;Pratley, ''Farewell to a quiet achiever'', p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; ''Onslow'' returned to Pearl Harbor in 1971 to participate in the [[RIMPAC]] multinational naval exercise.&lt;ref name=Shaw6&gt;Shaw, ''HMAS Onslow'', p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; During the exercise, a practice torpedo fired by the United States Coast Guard Cutter {{USCGC|Rush|WHEC-723|2}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/110688057|title=Onslow makes repair|date=16 November 1971|work=The Canberra Times|publisher=trove.nla.gov.au|page=3|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; failed to disengage as designed and hit the submarine—the only damage was a small dent near the stern.&lt;ref name=Shaw6/&gt;

In 1972,{{clarify|More specific date appreciated|date=April 2009}} the first major incident of ''Onslow''{{'}}s career occurred. The submarine was performing dive tests off the continental shelf outside [[Sydney Heads]].&lt;ref name=curtispride/&gt; One of the boat's company, transferred to the [[Royal Australian Navy Submarine Service|RAN Submarine Service]] against his will, refused to obey an order to close the valve on forward ballast tank, causing it to overfill with seawater and forcing the submarine into a steep [[crash dive]].&lt;ref name=curtispride/&gt; The dive took ''Onslow'' to a depth of {{convert|366|m|ft}}, well beyond the {{convert|200|m|ft|adj=on}} safe operating depth of the {{sclass-|Oberon|submarine|4}}, before another sailor was able to close the valve.&lt;ref name=curtispride/&gt; Seven tons of water had been taken on by the ballast tank, and with not enough compressed air available to completely empty the tank and allow the submarine to rise, ''Onslow''{{'}}s company had to rely on the submarine's twin propeller screws to help make it to the surface.&lt;ref name=curtispride/&gt; The sailor responsible for the incident was beaten by his comrades and removed from the submarine in a straitjacket upon the boat's return to submarine base {{HMAS|Platypus|naval base|6}}.&lt;ref name=curtispride/&gt; This incident led the RAN to change submarine service to volunteers only.&lt;ref name=curtispride/&gt;

''Onslow'' became the first vessel of the RAN to be assigned to the [[ANZUK]] force in Singapore on 22 July 1972.&lt;ref name=Gillett&gt;Gillett, ''Warships of Australia'', p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; During another ANZUK deployment, in 1974, the boat's attack periscope was damaged when it came in contact with the log probe of the frigate {{HMS|Leopard|F14|6}}.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} The boat returned to Australia on 18 December.&lt;ref name=Gillett/&gt; On 5 May 1975, ''Onslow'' began a two-year refit at [[Cockatoo Island Dockyard]], becoming the first Australian submarine to use the dockyard's new [[slave dock]].&lt;ref name=Jeremy64&gt;Jeremy, ''Cockatoo Island'', p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; This dock had been built specifically for refit work on ''Oberon''-class submarines, and was the main location of all ''Onslow''{{'}}s refits until 1990.&lt;ref name=Jeremy64/&gt; In 1977, ''Onslow'' was presented with the [[Gloucester Cup]], marking her as the most efficient warship in the RAN during the previous year—''Onslow'' was the first submarine to receive the award.&lt;ref name=Shaw6/&gt;

In 1980, ''Onslow'' participated in [[Exercise Kangaroo]] 3 as an [[opposing force|opposing submarine]].&lt;ref name=jollyroger&gt;Richards &amp; Smith, ''Onslow's Jolly Roger'', pp. 11–12&lt;/ref&gt; During the exercise, ''Onslow'' carried out successful simulated attacks on all seven surface ships involved in the exercise without being 'sunk' herself, including a simultaneous 'attack' on two [[United States Navy]] (USN) amphibious warfare vessels and a RAN replenishment ship while they were under escort by the other four warships.&lt;ref name=jollyroger/&gt; To indicate her success, the submarine flew a [[Use of the Jolly Roger by submarines|Jolly Roger]] from her communications mast upon her return to port, which was marked with the silhouettes of her seven targets: the {{sclass-|Perth|destroyer|2}}s {{HMAS|Brisbane|D 41|6}} and {{HMAS|Hobart|D 39|6}}, the {{sclass-|Knox|frigate|2}} {{USS|Lang|FF-1060|6}}, the {{sclass2-|River|destroyer escort|2}} {{HMAS|Yarra|DE 45|6}}, the {{sclass-|Anchorage|dock landing ship|2}} {{USS|Mount Vernon|LSD-39|6}}, the {{sclass-|Newport|tank landing ship|2}} {{USS|Bristol County|LST-1198|6}}, and the {{sclass2-|Tide|replenishment oiler|2}} {{HMAS|Supply|AO 195|6}}.&lt;ref name=jollyroger/&gt;

The second major incident of the boat's career happened on 1 March 1981, when ''Onslow'' was participating in wargames with a [[Royal New Zealand Navy]] frigate off the coast of Sydney.&lt;ref name=Sundaynight&gt;''Seconds from Disaster'' [''Sunday Night'' segment]&lt;/ref&gt; While operating at periscope depth, the submarine spotted an 'enemy' [[P-3C Orion]] aircraft{{verification needed|date=July 2012}} and stopped snorting (the process of taking in air to operate the boat's two diesel generators and expelling the produced exhaust through a [[submarine snorkel|snorkel]]) in preparation to go deep.&lt;ref name=Sundaynight/&gt; Both generators were turned off, but upon diving, it was quickly discovered that the starboard diesel had failed to switch off or had restarted and as the exhaust snorkel was sealed, the [[carbon monoxide]] exhaust filled the submarine.&lt;ref name=Sundaynight/&gt; ''Onslow'' rapidly resurfaced, and the exhaust was pumped from the submarine.&lt;ref name=Sundaynight/&gt; Able Seaman Christopher Passlow, who had been on the lower deck of the submarine at the time, died of [[asphyxiation]] and carbon monoxide poisoning, while another eighteen were rendered unconscious or were convulsing because of blood poisoning.&lt;ref name=Sundaynight/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;White, ''Australian submarines'', p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; Upon returning to base, doctors found that one-third of the 66 survivors had absorbed twice the lethal limit of carbon monoxide into their blood.&lt;ref name=Sundaynight/&gt; The company was given a week's leave, with no further assistance from the RAN; psychological or otherwise.&lt;ref name=Sundaynight/&gt; Two submariners were later awarded [[Orders, decorations, and medals of Australia#Australian Bravery Decorations|decorations for bravery]].&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, ''Sailors washed off submarine as rescue kept quiet''&lt;/ref&gt;

The RAN Board of Inquiry into the incident concluded that the accident was caused by human error—the duty engineer failed to shut down both engines—but members of ''Onslow''{{'}}s complement disagree with this, claiming the problem to be mechanical in origin.&lt;ref name=Sundaynight/&gt; Changes were made to [[Royal Australian Navy Submarine Service|Submarine Service]] operating procedures as a result of the Inquiry, but the investigation and subsequent report remained classified until 2009, when the information was acquired by the ''[[Sunday Night (Australian TV program)|Sunday Night]]'' [[newsmagazine]] program under the [[Freedom of Information Act 1982|Freedom of Information Act]].&lt;ref name=Sundaynight/&gt; When interviewed by ''Sunday Night'' in March 2009, the deputy Chief of Navy, Rear Admiral [[Davyd Thomas]] (who had been Passlow's [[divisional officer (military)|divisional officer]] prior to the incident) promised counselling for the survivors, and claimed that prior treatment of the ''Onslow'' submariners was due to a limited understanding of [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] back in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=Sundaynight/&gt;

===1982–1990===
''Onslow'' underwent a modernisation refit from 1982 until 1984; becoming the third Australian ''Oberon'' to be modernised.&lt;ref name=White202&gt;White, ''Australian submarines'', p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the modernisation, integrated data processing and fire control systems were installed, and the boat was fitted with [[Passive Underwater Fire Control Feasibility System|Micropuffs]] passive ranging sonar.&lt;ref&gt;White, ''Australian submarines'', p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; The torpedo payload was upgraded to the United States [[Mark 48 torpedo|Mark 48 wire-guided torpedo]].&lt;ref name=White202/&gt; In addition to new torpedoes, the modernisation allowed ''Oberon''-class submarines to carry and fire the [[Boeing Harpoon|Harpoon anti-ship missile]] through the torpedo tubes: ''Onslow'' became the first conventionally powered submarine in the world to be fitted with guided anti-ship missiles.&lt;ref name=White202/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lind303&gt;Lind, ''The Royal Australian Navy – Historic Naval Events Year by Year'', p. 303&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HMAS Onslow fin and masts.jpg|right|thumb|''Onslow''{{'}}s fin and equipment masts]]
''Onslow'' was the first Australian submarine to visit the west coast of the United States of America when she arrived in San Diego on 17 July 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Lind, ''The Royal Australian Navy – Historic Naval Events Year by Year'', p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; The boat made goodwill visits to the cities of San Francisco and Seattle during mid-August, before participating in the Royal Fleet Review for the 75th anniversary of the [[Royal Canadian Navy]].&lt;ref name=White200/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Australian Submarine to visit San Francisco'', PR Newswire, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

''Onslow''{{'}}s "safe to dive" certificate ran out just after Christmas 1989.&lt;ref name=nodive&gt;Grigson, ''Nothing doing down under for our subs'', p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian government had been trialling a program whereby refit work was tendered out to the private sector; delays in selecting the winning company and allocating the funds meant that an 18-month refit of the submarine scheduled to begin at the start of 1990 did not commence on time.&lt;ref name=nodive/&gt; [[Australian Defence Industries]] (ADI) was awarded the $100 million refit contract for ''Onslow'' and sister submarine {{HMAS|Otama}} in July.&lt;ref&gt;Grigson, ''$100M submarine refits to stay in Sydney'', p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Cockatoo Island's slave dock was transferred to the ADI facilities at Garden Island in November 1990, and was used for the refit.&lt;ref name=Jeremy64/&gt; It was later found, during arbitration between the Australian Government and Cockatoo Island Dockyard for various issues, that by tendering out the submarine refits to other companies, the government was in breach of contract with the Dockyard; A$17.3 million in compensation was awarded to the dockyard in August 1996 for loss of profits and overhead costs.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy, ''Cockatoo Island'', pp. 52–3&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990–1999===
In the early 1990s, four of ''Onslow''{{'}}s sister boats were decommissioned from service. By 1996, ''Onslow'' and ''Otama'' were the only members of the class in active service.

During 1995, ''Onslow'' was deployed to South East Asia. During this deployment, the personnel of ''Onslow'' were involved in a controversial [[line-crossing ceremony]] while operating near the equator.&lt;ref name=AAMH&gt;Weaver, ''Navy crosses the line with anal antics'', p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; During this particular ceremony, normally intended to induct new sailors into the 'court of King Neptune', the victims were verbally and physically abused, had their pelvises and genitals covered in what was described as a "blistering concoction", then thrown overboard and forced to stay there until the rest of the company permitted them on board.&lt;ref name=AAMH/&gt; When one of the victimised sailors complained to superiors, he became subject to several administrative errors and inconveniences, to the point where he was forced to resign a year later.&lt;ref name=AAMH/&gt; The sailor acquired a copy of a videotape made of the ceremony and presented it to the [[Nine Network]], which broke the story on 6 July 1999.&lt;ref name=AAMH/&gt; An inquiry into the incident aboard ''Onslow'' was held, which found that although guidelines had been developed in the years after the incident to prevent harassment in the Australian Defence Force, disciplinary charges against the sailors involved could not be laid, as more than three years had passed since the offence.&lt;ref name=AAPnoDis&gt;Australian Associated Press, ''Sailors won't be disciplined over videotaped ceremony''&lt;/ref&gt; The inquiry also stated that while line-crossing ceremonies would continue to be held aboard RAN vessels, they would be supervised by a non-involved member of the crew to prevent similar extreme situations developing.&lt;ref name=AAPnoDis/&gt; The deployment ended in December, with ''Onslow'' visiting her namesake town for the last time on her return to Australia.&lt;ref name=SnubSub&gt;Barton, ''Onslow snubbed on sub visit'', p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

On the evening of 16 April 1997, three [[Australian Special Air Service Regiment]] soldiers were injured when they were thrown from their Zodiac boat during launch and recovery exercises with the submarine.&lt;ref&gt;Seymour, ''SAS men hurt in submarine exercise'', p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, in November, ''Onslow'' participated in a joint RAN-[[Royal Australian Air Force|RAAF]] exercise off the coast of Western Australia.&lt;ref name=Fighters&gt;Cusworth, ''Farewell flight for fighters'', p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Over the end of 1997 and the start of 1998, ''Onslow'' and ''Otama'' were used for trials of the Australian-designed Narama [[towed array sonar]].&lt;ref name=janeNI&gt;''Narama Sonar secures first sales'', Jane's Navy International, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; The Narama sonar was one of the towed arrays under consideration for incorporation with the under-development {{sclass-|Collins|submarine}}s,&lt;ref name=janeNI/&gt; and was the array selected.

In mid-1998, the date of ''Onslow''{{'}}s decommissioning was announced for early 1999.&lt;ref name=SnubSub/&gt; Representatives from the town of [[Onslow, Western Australia]] requested that the submarine visit her namesake town before decommissioning, but were informed that the submarine's planned operational schedule could not accommodate such a visit.&lt;ref name=SnubSub/&gt; As part of this schedule, ''Onslow'' participated in the 1998 [[RIMPAC]] exercise.&lt;ref name=curtispride&gt;Curtis, ''Pride of the fleet''&lt;/ref&gt; The submarine had to pull out of the early part of the exercise: a [[resistor]] in the motor room switchboard had begun to smoke, forcing ''Onslow'' to return to Pearl Harbor for repairs.&lt;ref name=StottJaimeson&gt;Stott &amp; Jaumeson, ''Navy sinks Indonesian fishing vessel'', p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; She departed on 12 July, but was forced to return less than 24 hours later when a smouldering smell was noticed.&lt;ref name=StottJaimeson/&gt; The boat's luck changed during the latter part of RIMPAC 98, when on the morning of 10 August, ''Onslow'' located the 'enemy' {{sclass-|Nimitz|aircraft carrier|0}} {{USS|Carl Vinson|CVN-70|6}}, closed to within {{convert|300|m|ft}} without being detected, then released green flares to indicate her location, 'sinking' the supercarrier.&lt;ref name=curtispride/&gt;&lt;ref name=navnews-vinson-sunk&gt;{{cite news |last1=Davis|first1=Graham |title=Submarine will stay in-service |url=http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/Navy_News-October-19-1998.pdf |work=[[Navy News (Australia)|Navy News]] |accessdate=15 February 2015 |page=3 |type=PDF |date=19 October 1998 |volume=41 |number=20 |quote=...

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1360">The '''Imperial Register''' ({{lang-de|Reichsmatrikel}}) was a list of the [[Imperial Estates]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] that specified the precise numbers of troops they had to supply to the [[Army of the Holy Roman Empire|Imperial Army]] and/or the financial support they had to make available to sustain the Army. An entry in the register was often viewed as an important indicator of the [[imperial immediacy]] of an Imperial Estate, although that was not always undisputed. The importance of the register for historical research is that all Estates were recorded in it. However, it also contains obvious errors.

{{Nihongo|'''Isao Okazaki'''|岡崎 功|Okazaki Isao|1920–2006}} was a Japanese right-wing activist who caused the [[Matsue Incident]] in 1945.

==Early years==
He was born {{Nihongo|Isao Okazaki|岡崎 允佐夫|Okazaki Isao}}{{sfn|Hori|1991|p=77}} in [[Shimane Prefecture]] in 1920. He graduated from Matsue Middle School in 1939 (now Shimane Prefectural Matsue Secondary High School). He worked at the [[Shenyang]] branch of [[Mitsui &amp; Co.]], Manchuria for two years and developed an interest in [[Japanese nationalism]]. In November 1942, he returned to Japan and he entered [[Rissho University]] with the objective of becoming a [[monk]].

==Political involvement==
Okazaki became a member of ultra-nationalist group [[Kinno Makotomusubi]]. With his own money, he built a house in [[Meguro, Tokyo]].{{sfn|Maeda|1965|p=456}} He discussed the news of Japanese reverses in the war with his friends. He suggested that the ruling military [[Hideki Tojo]] Cabinet be overthrown.

They tried to obtain weapons for this purpose. When the authorities became aware of the plot in July 1943, Okazaki was arrested. He was given two years of imprisonment with three years of suspension in September{{sfn|Hori|1991|p=77}}{{sfn|Nakagawa|2002|pp=118–119}} He was released from prison in November under the surveillance of [[Tokubetsu Koto Keisatsu]] (political police).

After returning to Matsue, he was employed by the [[National Mobilization Law|Government mobilization office]].{{sfn|Maeda|1965|p=456}} Because Okazaki sympathized with the families of soldiers, he was in frequent conflict with his superiors. He was ordered to select 75 women to work at the [[Kure Naval Arsenal]], but realized that women of higher status were not part of the selection pool, and leaked this fact. He was forced to resign. He then became a member of [[Dai Nippon Genron Hokokukai]], a right-wing party.{{sfn|Inose|1983|pp=192–193}}

==The Matsue Incident==
{{Main|Matsue Incident}}

==After release from prison==
After his release from prison, Okazaki entered the lumber business in Matsue City.{{clarify|on his own, as a businessman, or was he an employee?|date=July 2012}} He took care of those who had been imprisoned for the war. A right-wing organization, ''Seinen Kodotai'' (Young Pro-emperor organization) formed with him as its leader. In December 1956, the National Union (of right wing organizations) was formed with him as the leader of the Shimane Branch. The group never had more than a small following. In 1961, Okazaki established the juridical educational organization, Shona Gakuen, and assumed the post of director.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} In 1968, he ran unsuccessfully for the [[House of Councillors|Upper House]] in the [[Diet of Japan]].{{sfn|Hori|1991|p=77}}

He died in 2006.

'''''Jazz Photo Corp. v. United States International Trade Commission''''', 264 F.3d 1094 ([[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit|Fed. Cir.]] 2001)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Jazz Photo Corp. v. United States International Trade Commission |vol=264 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=1094 |pinpoint= |court=Fed. Cir. |date=2001 |url=https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/774860/jazz-photo-corporation-and-dynatec-international-inc-and-opticolor/ |accessdate=2017-10-23 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, was a case in which the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit]] clarified the law of repair and reconstruction (permitting the owner of a [[patent]]ed item to fix the item when it breaks, but not to essentially build a new item from the parts of an old one), holding that it was not a patent infringement for one party to restore another party's patented "one-use" [[camera]] to be used a second time.

==Facts==

A company called Polytech Enterprise Limited acquired used [[disposable camera]]s which had been manufactured by [[Fujifilm|Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd.]] and sold by Fuji to consumers. Fuji owned several [[patent]]s on the technology used in the cameras. Polytech refurbished the cameras through a process which included fitting the camera with new film, and in some instances with new flash batteries, repairing the camera case to exclude light following the film reloading operation, repackaging, and relabeling under the trademark of Jazz Photo Corp. The cameras were brought to [[China]] to be refurbished, and Jazz Photo then [[Reimportation|reimported]] them into the United States for sale.

The [[United States Customs Service]] intercepted two shipments of these cameras, and sought to prevent their entry into the United States on the grounds that they infringed Fuji's patents. Jazz Photo objected, asserting that the patents were not infringed because, rather than build new cameras incorporating the proprietary technology, Jazz Photo had simply purchased Fuji's own cameras and repaired them.

==Opinion==

The Federal Circuit, in an opinion written by Judge [[Pauline Newman]], concluded that Jazz Photo was correct. The court clarified the line between ''reconstruction'' - building a new copy of a patented invention - and permissible ''repair''.

The court indicated that "[w]hile ownership of a patented article does not include the right to make a substantially new article, it does include the right to preserve the useful life of the original article." &lt;ref&gt;''Jazz Photo Corp.'', 264 F.3d at 1102.&lt;/ref&gt; The opinion then recounted the common law history of repair-reconstruction law, before finally determining that Jazz Photo's actions amounted to repair. The court held that Jazz Photo had legally acquired patented inventions, and, rather than infringe on Fuji's patent by reverse engineering, manufacturing, and selling a new product, it opted to refurbish existing items to extend their useful lives.

==Continued viability questioned==

In April 2014, the Federal Circuit ''sua sponte'' called for briefing and ''amicus curiae'' participation in an ''en banc'' consideration of whether ''Jazz Photo'' should be overruled in light of the recent Supreme Court decision in the [[Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|''Kirtsaeng'']] case&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|volume=568|page=519|pin=|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The court ordered:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In light of ''Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.'', 133 S. Ct. 1351 (2012), should this court overrule ''Jazz Photo Corp. v. International Trade Commission'', 264 F.3d 1094 (Fed. Cir. 2001), to the extent it ruled that a sale of a patented item outside the United States never gives rise to United States patent exhaustion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Lexmark International, Inc. v.

[[Greco-Roman mythology]] features [[male homosexuality]] in many of the constituent myths.  In addition, there are instances of [[cross-dressing]], and of [[androgyny]] which in post-1990s gender terminology has been grouped{{whom|date=April 2015}} under the acronym [[LGBT]].

==Overall==
These myths have been described as being crucially influential on Western [[LGBT literature]], with the original myths being constantly re-published and re-written, and the relationships and characters serving as icons.&lt;ref name="Pequigney1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/literature/classical_myth.html|title=Classical Mythology|page=1|date=2002|publisher=[[glbtq.com]]|accessdate=February 5, 2015|last=Pequigney|first=Joseph|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140415180456/http://www.glbtq.com/literature/classical_myth.html|archivedate=April 15, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, lesbianism is rarely found in classical myths.&lt;ref&gt;Compton, p. 97, "Rome and Greece: Lesbianism"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instances==
===Homosexuality and bisexuality===
Dionysus, a god gestated in the thigh of his father Zeus, after his mother died from being overwhelmed by Zeus's true form, has been dubbed "a patron god of hermaphrodites and transvestites" by Roberto C. Ferrari in the 2002 ''Encyclopedia of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Culture''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glbtq.com/arts/subjects_dionysus.html |title=Subjects in the Visual Arts: Dionysus |first=Roberto C. |last=Ferrari |publisher=glbtq.com |date=September 19, 2002 |accessdate=April 8, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090712090224/http://www.glbtq.com/arts/subjects_dionysus.html |archivedate=July 12, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other gods are sometimes considered patrons of homosexual love between males, such as the love goddess [[Aphrodite]] and gods in her retinue, such as the [[Erotes (mythology)|Erotes]]: [[Eros]], [[Himeros]] and [[Pothos (mythology)#Pothos|Pothos]].&lt;ref name=conner64&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 64, "Aphrodite"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 133, "Erotes"&lt;/ref&gt; Eros is also part of a trinity of gods that played roles in homoerotic relationships, along with [[Heracles]] and [[Hermes]], who bestowed qualities of Beauty (and Loyalty), strength, and eloquence, respectively, onto male lovers.&lt;ref&gt;Conner &amp; Sparks (1998), p. 132, "Eros"&lt;/ref&gt; In the poetry of [[Sappho]], Aphrodite is identified as the patron of lesbians.&lt;ref name=conner64/&gt;

===Transgender and transsexual===
The sex-change theme also occurred in classical mythology. The reason for the transformation varies, as in the case of Sypretes (Συπρετεσ) or [[Siproites]] (Σιπροιτεσ), a hunter from [[Crete]], who was transformed to a woman by [[Artemis]] after having seen the goddess bathing.&lt;ref&gt;[[Antoninus Liberalis]], cited by Francis Celoria. ''The Metamorphoses of Antoninus Liberalis: A Translation with Commentary'', [https://books.google.com.vn/books?id=9_Eolzuv0eQC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;dq=siproites pp.71].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Orion: The Myth of the Hunter and the Huntress'', [https://books.google.com.vn/books?id=tD4lJxC95mEC&amp;pg=PA125&amp;dq=Siproites pp.125-126]. University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also a motif of a woman needing to disguise herself as a male and later being transformed into a biological male by mysterious forces (mainly the [[Greek gods|gods]]). In the cases of [[Iphis (Cretan)|Iphis]] and [[Leucippus (daughter of Galatea)|Leucippus]], the woman's mother was pressured (by her husband) to bear a male child so the protagonist was forced to  impersonate a male from birth. Later in life, manhood was granted through the blessing of a deity ([[Juno (mythology)|Juno]]/[[Hera]] in Iphis' case and [[Leto]] in Leucippus').

[[Caeneus]] and [[Mestra]], each of who was a mate of a god (Caeneus was a rape victim of [[Poseidon]]/[[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] and Mestra was a lover of [[Apollo]]), were granted manhood by the said god. Mestra, however, had the ability to [[shapeshifting|change her shape voluntarily]], instead of staying in male form like Caeneus and other instances above.

[[Tiresias]], on the other hand, became female because he struck a couple of copulating snakes, displeasing [[Hera]], who punished him by transforming Tiresias into a woman. Later the sentence was remitted, due to either trampling on the mating snakes or avoiding them, and she became male again. In another version, Tiresias' sex-change was caused by an argument between [[Zeus]] and Hera, on which they debated whether a male or a female had greater pleasure in [[sex]], so they transformed him to a female to experiment.

*[[Mestra]]
*Siproites
*[[Tiresias]]

===Androgynes and intersex===
[[Aphroditus]] was an androgynous Aphrodite from Cyprus, in later mythology became known as [[Hermaphroditus]] (also the namesake of the word ''[[hermaphrodite]]'') the son of Hermes and Aphrodite.

This annotated list includes 
# major present-day '''Czech-English dictionaries''',
# '''Czech dictionaries''', both contemporary and historical.  

==Czech-English dictionaries==
Notable present-day Czech-English dictionaries are:

*Fronek, Josef. ''Velký česko-anglický slovník = Large Czech-English dictionary.'' 2nd, enlarged ed., Voznice: Leda, 2013. xlvi, 1743 pp. {{ISBN|978-80-7335-322-3}}. &lt;small&gt;A comprehensive dictionary, intended also for English speakers.&lt;/small&gt;
*Poldauf, Ivan. ''Velký česko-anglický slovník = Comprehensive Czech-English dictionary.'' 3rd ed. Čelákovice: W.D. Publications, 1996. 1187 pp. {{ISBN|80-902180-3-2}}. &lt;small&gt;A handy-sized dictionary, albeit somewhat out of date.&lt;/small&gt;

==Czech dictionaries==
There are three dictionaries of current Czech that are of use for native speakers:

*Kroupová, Libuše et al. ''Slovník spisovné češtiny pro školu a veřejnost: s Dodatkem Ministerstva školství, mládeže a tělovýchovy České republiky.'' (SSČ) 4th ed. Praha: Academia, 2005. 647 pp. {{ISBN|80-200-1347-4}}. &lt;small&gt;Basic Czech dictionary, contains 45,366 headwords, intended primarily for use in schools and for laymen. [http://prirucka.ujc.cas.cz/en Online] as part of the ''Internet Language Reference Book''.&lt;/small&gt;
*Havránek, Bohuslav, et al. ''Slovník spisovného jazyka českého.'' (SSJČ) 2nd ed. Praha: Academia, 1989. 8 vols. &lt;small&gt;A dictionary of first choice when reading the classics, the SSJČ contains a total of 192,908 entries and sub-entries. [http://ssjc.ujc.cas.cz/ Online].&lt;/small&gt;
*''Příruční slovník jazyka českého.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22391">The '''List of artists in the Philadelphia Museum of Art handbook of the collections''' is a list of the artists indexed in the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] museum guide. The guide, with an introduction by Anne D'Harnencourt, was produced as a 25th anniversary gift by the Museum Associates in 1995. The museum's collections are spread throughout several locations in Fairmount Park in addition to The Rodin museum and the Neo-classical building at the end of the Benjamin Franklin Parkway.  The entire collection houses over 70,000 objects, thousands of which are on view at any given time. The museum guide has been designed to highlight seven major sections.  In the following list, the artist's name is followed by the location of one of their works and its page number in the guide. For artists with more than one work in the collection, or for works by artists not listed here, see the Philadelphia Museum of Art website or the corresponding [[Wikimedia Commons]] category. Of artists listed, only 9 are women.
For the complete list of artists and their artworks in the collection, see the website.

Die Funktion von Alterität für die Konstitution und Konstruktion von Identität" (Identities and Otherings. The Function of Othering for the Constitution and Construction of Identity). Steinhart investigated [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] and the cultural identity of Greece in Roman times. During this period, he completed his [[habilitation]] in 2001 at Freiburg University. From 2002 to 2005 Steinhart was a research assistant, from 2005 to 2006 was a member of the academic council and since 2006 has been a [[Privatdozent]] at the Archaeological Institute of Freiburg University.

'''Mills College Art Museum''' is a museum and art gallery in [[Oakland, California]].

The originally all-girls' school [[Mills College]] was founded by [[Susan Mills|Susan]] and [[Cyrus Mills]], who were both interested in art and history. Susan's sister [[Jane Tolman]] was an art historian who developed the art history curriculum in 1875. With a Tolman Mills bequest the present museum building was constructed in 1925 called the Mills College Art Gallery. [[Albert M. Bender]], the Mills College Trustee chiefly responsible for the museum's completion, also made a gift of 40 paintings and 75 prints by contemporary San Francisco Bay Area artists, and since then the gallery has become an important public collection of modern art in Northern California. Bender himself later became a principal founder of what is now the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]].

She wears a blue jacket trimmed with fur and a red skirt ; at her right is a wicker cradle. Farther back, to the right of the fireplace, a chambermaid is sweeping the tiled floor. Bright sunlight falls from the window 
high up on the left, and illumines the back wall, on which hangs a picture. Another picture hangs over the fireplace ; below is a chair. In the left foreground is a table with a cloth, upon which is a basket. The open door at the back shows a view of a canal with a stone bridge and a sunlit house.

[[File:KoninklijkeBibliotheek2.jpg|thumb|As the logos on the window show, the RKD shares the same building (located near [[Den Haag Centraal]]) with the {{Interlanguage link multi|Nederlands Letterkundig Museum|nl}} (LM), the [[Huygens Institute for Dutch History|Huygens ING]], the [[Netherlands Music Institute]] (NMI) and the [[National Library of the Netherlands|Koninklijke Bibliotheek]].]]

The '''Netherlands Institute for Art History''' or '''RKD''' (Dutch: '''RKD-Nederlands Instituut voor Kunstgeschiedenis''') is located in [[The Hague]] and is home to the largest [[art history]] center in the world. The center specializes in documentation, archives, and books on [[Western art]] from the late Middle Ages until modern times. All of this is open to the public, and much of it has been digitized and is available on their website. The main goal of the bureau is to collect, categorize, and make art research available, most notably in the field of [[Dutch Masters]].

Via the available databases, the visitor can gain insight into archival evidence on the lives of many artists of past centuries. The library owns approximately 450,000 titles, of which ca. 150,000 are auction catalogs. There are ca. 3,000 magazines, of which 600 are currently running subscriptions. Though most of the text is in Dutch, the standard record format includes a link to library entries and images of known works, which include English as well as Dutch titles.

The RKD also manages the Dutch version of the [[Art and Architecture Thesaurus]], a [[thesaurus]] of terms for management of information on art and architecture. The original version is an initiative of the [[Getty Research Institute]] in [[Los Angeles, California]].

==History==
The collection was started through bequests by [[Frits Lugt]], art historian and owner of a massive collection of drawings and prints, and [[Cornelis Hofstede de Groot]] (1863–1930), a collector, art historian and museum curator. Their bequest formed the basis for both the art collection and the library, which is now mostly housed in the [[Koninklijke Bibliotheek, National Library of the Netherlands|Koninklijke Bibliotheek]] (National Library).
==Open access website==
Though not all of the library's holdings have been digitised, much of its [[metadata]] is accessible online. The website itself is available in both a Dutch and an English user interface.
===Online artist pages===
In the artist database ''RKDartists'', each artist is assigned a record number. To reference an artist page directly, use the code listed at the bottom of the record, usually of the form: https://rkd.nl/en/explore/artists/ followed by the artist's record number. For example, the artist record number for [[Salvador Dalí]] is 19752, so his RKD artist page can be referenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rkd.nl/en/explore/artists/19752 |title=Salvador Dalí |publisher=Netherlands Institute for Art History |date= |accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Wikidata property|P650}}
===Online artworks pages===
In the images database ''RKDimages'', each artwork is assigned a record number. To reference an artwork page directly, use the code listed at the bottom of the record, usually of the form: https://rkd.nl/en/explore/images/ followed by the artwork's record number. For example, the artwork record number for [[The Night Watch]] is 3063, so its RKD artwork page can be referenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rkd.nl/en/explore/images/3063 |title=Civic guardsmen of Amsterdam under command of Banninck Cocq |publisher=Netherlands Institute for Art History |date= |accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Wikidata property |P350 }}
{{commons category|RKDimages}}

===Online thesaurus of art terms===
The Art and Architecture Thesaurus also assigns a record for each term, but these can not be referenced online by record number. Rather, they are used in the databases and the databases can be searched for terms. For example, the painting called "The Night Watch" is a militia painting, and all records fitting this keyword (Dutch: ''algemene trefwoord'') can be seen by selecting this from the image screen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://rkd.nl/en/explore/images#filters%5BRKD_algemene_trefwoorden%5D=militia%20painting All available records for "militia painting"] in RKDimages&lt;/ref&gt;

The thesaurus is a set of general terms, but the RKD also contains a database for an alternate form of describing artworks, that today is mostly filled with biblical references. This is the [[iconclass]] database. To see all images that depict Miriam's dance, the associated iconclass code 71E1232 can be used as a special search term.&lt;ref&gt;[https://rkd.nl/en/explore/images#filters%5Biconclass_code%5D=71E1232  All available records for iconclass code "71E1232"] in RKDimages&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''''obambo''''' is a type of [[ghost]] among certain peoples of [[Central Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spence|first1=Lewis|title=An Encyclopaedia of Occultism|date=1920|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=978-0486426136|page=299|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=nOcoAwAAQBAJ|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obambo

An ''obambo'' initially resides in the [[The Bush|bush]], but eventually gets tired of this and appears to a close relative, requesting that he build a house for him near his own. That night the village women are gathered to dance and sing, and next day the people visit the grave of the deceased and make a rough idol. They then erect a little hut near the house of the person the ''obambo'' visited; then place the [[bier]] on which the deceased was carried to his grave inside the hut, as well as some of the dust from the grave. A white cloth is then draped over the door.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bane|first1=Theresa|title=Encyclopedia of Spirits and Ghosts in World Mythology|date=March 10, 2016|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-1476663555|page=97|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=VSu6CwAAQBAJ|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative meaning is the ghost of somebody who died in the bush and has no grave.

'''''Pocket Ref''''' is a comprehensive, all-purpose [[paperback|pocket-sized]] [[reference book]]/[[handbook]] and how-to guide containing various tips, tables, maps, formulas, constants and conversions by Thomas J. Glover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=im-No5TYyy8C&amp;pg=PA403&amp;lpg=PA403&amp;dq=Gaiam+Real+Goods+solar+living+sourcebook,+by+John+Shaeffer+and+Doug+Pratt+%22pocket+ref%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EkiOE3CbUQ&amp;sig=NFgVSw9MDMIx48_HvUIcnt7Xw6A&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=Gaiam%20Real%20Goods%20solar%20living%20sourcebook%2C%20by%20John%20Shaeffer%20and%20Doug%20Pratt%20%22pocket%20ref%22&amp;f=false | title=Gaiam Real Goods Solar Living Sourcebook: Your Complete Guide to Renewable ... - Google Books | accessdate=September 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is published by Sequoia Publishing, and is currently in its fourth edition at 864 pages in length, released in late 2010.&lt;ref name=glover&gt;{{cite book|last1=Glover|first1=Thomas J.|title=Pocket Ref|date=August 2010|publisher=Sequoia Publishing|location=Littleton, CO|isbn=978-1-885071-62-0|edition=Fourth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It contains references, tables, and instructional guides on such varied subjects as automotive repair; carpentry and construction; chemistry and physics; computers; physical, chemical, and mathematical constants; electronics; money and measurement conversions; advanced first aid; glue, solvents, paints, and finishes; hardware; mine, mill, and aggregate; plumbing; zip codes; rope, cable, and knots; steel and metals; surveying and mapping; and more.&lt;ref name=glover/&gt;

Described as an "oracle of all things [[DIY]]", the ''Pocket Ref'' has been featured on the television series ''[[MythBusters]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://coolmaterial.com/media/pocket-ref/ | title=Pocket Ref | publisher = Cool Material | accessdate=September 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the "[[MythBusters (2005 season)#Episode SP5 .E2.80.93 .22Shop .27til You Drop.22|Shop 'til You Drop]]" episode, [[Adam Savage]] noted that "nearly everyone" had asked him about the little black book.&lt;ref name="mythbusters"&gt;{{Cite episode | title = Shop 'til You Drop | series = MythBusters | serieslink = MythBusters | network = [[Discovery Channel]] | date = 2005 | season = 2005 | number = SP5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Pocket Ref'' is available at many [[hardware store]]s, in addition to book stores and online. The ''Pocket Ref'' is often imprinted with the name of a hardware store or other third party on its front cover.

Although the ''Pocket Ref'' is printed on very thin paper, its page count is still limited by the publisher's desire for it to fit in a standard shirt pocket, so a more comprehensive work, at 1280 pages, ''DeskRef'', has been published.

Glover is also the author of ''Pocket PC Ref'', ''Deskref'', ''Handyman In-Your-Pocket'', ''Pocket Do It Yourself Source'', ''Measure for Measure'' and ''Tech Ref''.

Comparable books include ''AutoRef'' by Glover's sometime-coauthor Richard A. Young, and ''Pocket Partner'' "a comprehensive collection of vital information for law enforcement personnel" by Dennis Evers.

==Reception==
Nick Stockton, writing for ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', included it in their list of favourites,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Gadgets and Gear We Couldn't get Enough of This Month |author=Nick Stockton |journal=Wired |date=29 Aug 2014 |url=https://www.wired.com/2014/08/things-we-love-august/#slide-id-1495961}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|Thomas J. Glover's $12 Pocket Ref refutes the notion that the best way to portably access a world of information is through a touchscreen. Glover has packed gigabytes of analog data into a book that's less than an inch thick and small enough to fit into your front shirt pocket. Inside is everything from the best angle for dumping a truckbed full of ashes (33 degrees) to the proper title for a box full of kittens (kindle).}}

'''Poimandres''' ({{lang-el|Ποιμάνδρης}}; also known as ''Poemandres'', ''Poemander'' or ''Pimander'') is the first tractate in the ''[[Corpus Hermeticum]]''. 

==Etymology==
Originally written in [[Greek language|Greek]], the title was formerly understood to mean "Man-Shepherd" from the words [[wikt:ποιμήν|ποιμήν]] and [[wikt:ἀνήρ|ἀνήρ]], but recent studies on its etymology allege that it is actually derived from the Egyptian phrase '''''Peime-nte-rê''''' meaning "Knowledge of [[Ra|Re]]" or "Understanding of Re".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-fyZRdkzLJEC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;dq=poimandres+re&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=8A8QTuPMJMrb0QHoqfW9CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAQ#v=snippet&amp;q=%22knowledge%20of%20Re%22&amp;f=false ''From Poimandres to Jacob Böhme: Gnosis, Hermetism and the Christian Tradition'', pgs 47, 48]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OVZP6b9cqLkC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=poimandres+understanding+re+coptic&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=58snU9hAqqrIAeOngdgK&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=poimandres%20understanding%20re%20coptic&amp;f=false ''Hermetica: The Greek Corpus Hermeticum and the Latin Asclepius'' in a New English Translation, p 95]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Description==
It is also a sort of [[deity]], or attribute of [[God]] as ''[[nous]]'' or "mind" as expressed in the following translations 

To quote ([[John Everard (preacher)|John Everard]] translation):
:''Then said I, "Who art Thou?"''
:''"I am," quoth he, "Poemander, the mind of the Great Lord, the most Mighty and absolute Emperor: I know what thou wouldest have, and I am always present with thee."''

And in the [[G. R. S. Mead]] translation: 
:''And I do say: Who art thou?''
:''He saith: I am Man-Shepherd ''[Ποιμάνδρης]'', Mind of all-masterhood; I know what thou desirest and I’m with thee everywhere.''

And in the translation by Salaman, Van Oyen and Wharton:&lt;ref&gt;Salaman, Van Oyen, Wharton and Mahé,''The Way of Hermes'', p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;
:''"Who are you?" said I.''
:''He said, "I am Poimandres the [[Nous]] of the Supreme. I know what you wish and I am with you everywhere."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26943">[[File:NewYorkStreetScene-People.JPG|thumb|Polyethnicity in [[New York City]]]]
'''Polyethnicity''' refers to the proximity of people from different [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] backgrounds within a [[country]] or other specific geographic region.&lt;ref name=mcneil85&gt;McNeil 1985, page 85&lt;/ref&gt; It also relates to the ability and willingness of individuals to identify themselves with multiple [[ethnic group|ethnicities]]. It occurs when multiple ethnicities inhabit a given area, specifically through means of [[immigration]], [[Interracial marriage|intermarriage]], [[trade]], [[conquest (military)|conquest]] and post-war land-divisions.&lt;ref name=arabandi&gt;Arabandi 2000, Online&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=smith190&gt;Smith 1998, page 190&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=smith200&gt;Smith 1998, page 200&lt;/ref&gt; This has had many political and social implications on countries and regions.&lt;ref name=safranintro&gt;Safran 2000, Introduction&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=benhabib154-155&gt;Benhabib 1996, pages 154–155&lt;/ref&gt;

Many, if not all, countries have some degree of polyethnicity, with countries like the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] having large levels and countries like [[Japan]] and [[Poland]] having very small levels (and more specifically, a sense of homogeneity).&lt;ref name=usb&gt;U.S. Census Bureau&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=thomson213-215&gt;Thomson 2000, pages 213-215&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Burgess&gt;Burgess 2007, Online&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=safran1-2&gt;Safran 2000, pages 1-2&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of polyethnicity prevalent in some [[Western countries]] has spurred some arguments against it, which include a belief that it leads to the weakening of each society's strengths, and also a belief that political-ethnic issues in countries with polyethnic populations are better handled with different laws for certain ethnicities.&lt;ref name=robertson1-10&gt;Robertson 1992, pages 1-10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=thomson214-215&gt;Thomson 2000, pages 214–215&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conceptual history ==
In 1985, Canadian historian [[William H. McNeill (historian)|William H. McNeill]] gave a series of three lectures on polyethnicity in ancient and modern cultures at the [[University of Toronto]].&lt;ref name=ritzer141&gt;Ritzer 2004, page 141&lt;/ref&gt; The main [[thesis]] throughout the lectures was the argument that it has been the [[Norm (sociology)|cultural norm]] for societies to be composed of different ethnic groups. McNeill argues that the ideal of homogeneous societies may have grown between 1750 and 1920 in [[Western Europe]] due to a growth in the belief in a single [[Nationalism|nationalistic]] base for the political organization of society. McNeill believes that [[World War I]] was the point in time when the desire for homogeneous nations began to weaken.&lt;ref name=dr&gt;Dreisziger 1990, pages 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact on politics ==
Polyethnicity divides nations, complicating the [[politics]] as local and national governments attempt to satisfy all [[ethnic groups]].&lt;ref name=safranintro/&gt; Many [[politician]]s in countries attempt to find the balance between [[ethnic group|ethnic identities]] within their country and the identity of the nation as a whole.&lt;ref name=safranintro/&gt; Nationalism also plays a large part in these political debates, as [[cultural pluralism]] and [[consociationalism]] are the [[democracy|democratic]] alternatives to nationalism for the polyethnic state.&lt;ref name=kellas8&gt;Kellas 1991, page 8&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of nationalism being social instead of ethnic entails a variety of culture, a shared sense of identity and a community not based on descent.&lt;ref name=kellas65&gt;Kellas 1991, page 65&lt;/ref&gt; Culturally plural states vary constitutionally between a decentralized and unitary state (such as [[Great Britain]]) and a federal state (such as Belgium, [[Switzerland]], or Canada).&lt;ref name=kellas180-183&gt;Kellas 1991, pages 180-183&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnic parties in these polyethnic regions are not anti-state but instead seek maximum power within this state.&lt;ref name=robertson1-10/&gt;&lt;ref name=kellas65/&gt; Many polyethnic countries face this dilemma with their policy decisions.&lt;ref name=safran2-3&gt;Safran 2000, pages 2-3&lt;/ref&gt; The following nations and regions are just a few specific examples of this dilemma and its effects:

=== United States ===

&lt;/div&gt;
The [[United States]] is a nation founded by different ethnicities frequently described as coming together in a "[[melting pot]]," a term used to emphasize the degree to which constituent groups influence and are influenced by each other, or a "[[Salad bowl (cultural idea)|salad bowl]]," a term more recently coined in contrast to the "melting pot" metaphor and emphasizing those groups' retention of fundamentally distinct identities despite their proximity to each other and their influence on the overall culture that all of those groups inhabit.&lt;ref name=adams&gt;Adams 2001&lt;/ref&gt; A controversial political issue in recent years has been the question of [[multilingualism|bilingualism]].&lt;ref name=oakland&gt;Navarrette 2007, online&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[immigration|immigrants]] have come from [[Hispanic America]], who are native [[Spanish language|Spanish]] speakers, in the past centuries and have become a significant minority and even a majority in many areas of the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]].&lt;ref name=usb/&gt;&lt;ref name=languages&gt;Hakimzadeh 2007, Online&lt;/ref&gt; In [[New Mexico]] the Spanish speaking population exceeds 40%.&lt;ref name=usb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crawford 1992, page 154&lt;/ref&gt; Disputes have emerged over language policy, since a sizeable part of the population, and in many areas the majority of the population, speak Spanish as a native language.&lt;ref name=oakland/&gt; The biggest debates are over bilingual education for language minority students, the availability of non-English ballots and election materials and whether or not English is the official language.&lt;ref name=oakland/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cromwell 1998, Online&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roache 1996, Online&lt;/ref&gt; It has evolved into an [[ethnic conflict]] between the pluralists who support bilingualism and linguistic access and the assimilationists who strongly oppose this and lead the [[English-only movement|official English movement]].&lt;ref name=young73&gt;Young 1993, page 73&lt;/ref&gt; The United States does not have an [[official language]], but English is the [[de facto|default]] national language, spoken by the overwhelming majority of the country's population.&lt;ref name=mcarthur38&gt;McArthur 1998, page 38&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
[[Canada]] has had many political debates between the [[French language|French]] speakers and [[English language|English]] speakers, particularly in the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province]] of [[Quebec]].&lt;ref name=belanger&gt;Bélanger 2000, online&lt;/ref&gt; Canada holds both French and English as official languages.&lt;ref name=tuohy325&gt;Tuohy 1992, page 325&lt;/ref&gt; The politics in Quebec are largely defined by [[nationalism]] as French [[French-speaking Quebecer|Québécois]] wish to gain independence from Canada as a whole, based on ethnic and linguistic boundaries.&lt;ref name=mcneil86&gt;McNeil 1985, page 86&lt;/ref&gt; The main separatist party, [[Parti Québécois]], attempted to gain sovereignty twice (once in [[Quebec independence referendum, 1980|1980]] and again in [[Quebec independence referendum, 1995|1995]]) and failed by a narrow margin of 1.2% in 1995.&lt;ref name=leyton&gt;Leyton-Brown 2002, page 5&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, in order to remain united, Canada granted Quebec [[Quebec#Statut particulier .28.22special status.22.29|''statut particulier'']], recognizing Quebec as a nation within the united nation of Canada.&lt;ref name=calgary&gt;The Calgary Declaration&lt;/ref&gt; Canada is often described as a [[cultural mosaic]].

=== Belgium ===
The divide between the [[Dutch language|Dutch]]-speaking north ([[Flanders]]) and the [[French language|French]]-speaking South ([[Wallonia]]) has caused the [[parliamentary democracy]] to become ethnically polarized.&lt;ref name=lj39&gt;Lijphart 199, page 39&lt;/ref&gt; Though an equal number of seats in the [[Chamber of Representatives of Belgium|Chamber of Representatives]] are prescribed to the Flemish and Walloons, Belgian [[political parties]] have all divided into two [[Ideology|ideologically]] identical but linguistically and ethnically different parties.&lt;ref name=lj39/&gt; The political crisis has grown so bad in recent years that the [[partition of Belgium]] has been feared.&lt;ref name=sfchronicle&gt;Bryant, Online&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethiopia ===
[[Ethiopia]] is a polyethnic [[nation]] consisting of 80 different [[ethnic group]]s and 84 [[indigenous language]]s.&lt;ref name=levinson131&gt;Levinson 1998, page 131&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ethnologue&gt;Grimes 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the diverse population and rural areas throughout the nation, it was nearly impossible to create a strong centralized state; though it was eventually accomplished through political evolution.&lt;ref name=young147&gt;Young 1993, page 147&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to 1974, nationalism was only discussed within radical student groups, but by the late 20th century the issue had come to the forefront of political debate.&lt;ref name=tiruneh&gt;Tiruneh 1993, page 150&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=young149&gt;Young 1993, page 149&lt;/ref&gt; Ethiopia was forced to modernize their political system to properly handle the nationalism debates.&lt;ref name=young149/&gt; The [[Derg]] military government took control with a [[Marxist–Leninist]] ideology, urging [[self-determination]] and rejecting compromise over any nationality issues.&lt;ref name=young152&gt;Young 1993, page 152&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, Ethiopia suffered a series of famines and after the [[USSR]] broke apart, they lost their aid from the [[Soviet Union]] and the Derg government collapsed.&lt;ref name=young152/&gt; Eventually Ethiopia restabilized and adopted a modern political system that models a [[federal parliamentary republic]].&lt;ref name=kavalski&gt;Kavalski 2008, page 31&lt;/ref&gt; It was still impossible to create a central government holding all power, so the government was torn.&lt;ref name=young159&gt;Young 1993, page 159&lt;/ref&gt; The central federal government now presides over ethnically-based regional states and each ethnic state is granted the right to establish their own government and [[democracy]].&lt;ref name=young209&gt;Young 1993, page 209&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 19th century Spain ===
In [[Spain]] from 1808 to 1814 the [[Peninsular War#Guerrilla war|Spanish War of Independence]] took place amidst a multi-cultural Spain.&lt;ref name=baramendi&gt;Baramendi 2000, pages 80-84&lt;/ref&gt; Spain, at the time, was under the control of [[Joseph Bonaparte|King Joseph]], who was [[Napoleon I of France]]'s brother.&lt;ref name=baramendi/&gt; Because the nation was under the control of French rule, the Spanish formed [[coalition]]s of ethnic groups to reclaim their own political representation, instead of the current French political system in power.&lt;ref name=baramendi/&gt;

=== Southeast Asia ===
[[File:Location Southeast Asia.svg|left|thumb|Southeast Asia countries, 2009-10-10]]
In [[Southeast Asia]] the continental area ([[Myanmar]], [[Thailand]], [[Laos]], [[Cambodia]] and [[Vietnam]]) generally practices [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]].&lt;ref name="hirschman19"&gt;Hirschman 1995 page 19&lt;/ref&gt; Most of [[Island|insular]] Southeast Asia (namely [[Malaysia]], [[Brunei]] and [[Indonesia]]) practices mostly [[Sunni Islam]].&lt;ref name=hirschman20&gt;Hirschman 1995 page 20&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of the insular region ([[Philippines]] and [[East Timor]]) practices mostly [[Roman Catholic|Roman Catholic Christianity]] and [[Singapore]] practises mostly [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]].&lt;ref name=hirschman20/&gt; Significant long-distance labor migration that occurred during the late 19th into the early 20th century provided many different types of ethnic diversity.&lt;ref name=hirschman21&gt;Hirschman 1995 page 21&lt;/ref&gt; Relations between the [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] population of the region arose from regional variations of cultural and linguistic group.&lt;ref name=hirschman21/&gt; During this time immigrant minorities, especially the Chinese, developed as well.&lt;ref name=hirschman21/&gt; Although there were extreme political differences for each minority and religion, they were still legitimate members of political communities and there has been a significant amount of unity throughout history.&lt;ref name=hirschman22&gt;Hirschman 1995 page 22&lt;/ref&gt; This differs from both nearby [[East Asia|East]] and [[South Asia]].&lt;ref name=hirschman22/&gt;

== Impact on society ==
Polyethnicity, over time, can change the way societies practice [[Norm (sociology)|cultural norms]].&lt;ref name=benhabib154-155/&gt;

=== Marriage ===
An increase in intermarriage in the United States has led to the blurring of ethnic lines.&lt;ref name=arabandi/&gt; [[Anti-miscegenation laws]] (laws banning interracial marriages) were abolished in the United States in 1967 and now it is estimated that one-fifth of the population in the United States by 2050 will be part of the polyethnic population.&lt;ref name=lee221-245&gt;Lee 2000, pages 221-245&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, self-identified Multiracial Americans numbered 6.8 million or 2.4% of the population.&lt;ref name=usb/&gt;&lt;ref name=jonessmith&gt;Jones &amp; Smith 2000 Online&lt;/ref&gt;
While the number of interethnic marriages is on the rise, there are certain ethnic groups that have been found more likely to become polyethnic and recognize themselves with more than one ethnic background. Bhavani Arabandi states in his article on polyethnicity that:&lt;blockquote&gt;
Asians and Latinos have much higher rates of interethnic marriages than do blacks, and they are more likely to report polyethnicity than blacks who more often claim a single ethnicity and racial identity. This is the case, the authors [Lee, J &amp; Bean, F.D] argue, because blacks have a "legacy of slavery," a history of discrimination, and have been victimized by the "one drop rule" (where having any black blood automatically labeled one as black) in the US.&lt;ref name=arabandi/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Military ===
[[File:US ARMY AFRICA NF10 0016.jpg|thumb|Maj. Gen. William B. Garrett III, commander of U.S. Army Africa, Gen. Nyakayirima Aronda, Chief of Defense Forces, Ugandan People’s Defense Force and Gen. Jeremiah Kianga, Chief of General Staff, Kenya, render honors during the opening ceremony for Natural Fire 10, Kitgum, Uganda, Oct. 16, 2009.]]
Presently, most armed forces are composed of people from different ethnic backgrounds.&lt;ref name=dr/&gt; They are considered to be polyethnic due to the differences in race, ethnicity, language or background.&lt;ref name="dr2"&gt;Dreisziger 1990 page 1&lt;/ref&gt; While there are many examples of polyethnic forces, the most prominent are among the largest armed forces in the world, including those of the United States, [[Soviet Union|the former USSR]] and [[China]].&lt;ref name=dr/&gt; Polyethnic armed forces are not a new phenomenon; multi-ethnic forces have been in existence since the ancient [[Roman Empire]], [[Middle Eastern Empires]] and even the [[List of Mongol Khans|Mongol Khans]].&lt;ref name=dr2/&gt; The [[United States armed forces|U.S. Military]] was one of the first modern militaries to begin ethnic integration, by order of [[Harry S. Truman|President Truman]] in 1945.&lt;ref name=yang&gt;Yang 2000, page 168&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
There are also arguments against polyethnicity, as well as the assimilation of ethnicities in polyethnic regions. [[Wilmot Robertson]] in ''The Ethnostate'' and [[Dennis L. Thomson]] in ''The Political Demands of Isolated Indian Bands in British Columbia'', argue for some level of [[separatism]].&lt;ref name=robertson1-10/&gt;&lt;ref name=thomson214-215/&gt;

In ''The Ethnostate'', Robertson declares polyethnicity as an ideal that only lessens each culture.&lt;ref name=robertson1-10/&gt; He believes that, within a polyethnic culture, the nation or region as a whole is less capable of cultural culmination than each of the individual ethnicities that make it up.&lt;ref name=robertson10&gt;Robertson 1992 p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, polyethnicity promotes the dilution of ethnicity and thus hinders each ethnicity in all aspects of culture.&lt;ref name=robertson10/&gt;

In ''The Political Demands of Isolated Indian Bands in British Columbia'', Thomson points out the benefits in some level (albeit small) of separatist policies.&lt;ref name=thomson214-215/&gt; He argues the benefits of allowing ethnic groups, like the [[Amish]] and the [[Hutterite]]s in the United States and Canada or the [[Sami people|Sami]] in [[Norway]], to live on the edges of governance.&lt;ref name=thomson214-215/&gt; These are ethnic groups that would prefer to retain their ethnic identity and thus prefer separatist policies for themselves, as they do not require them to conform to policies for all ethnicities of the nation.&lt;ref name=thomson214-215/&gt;

A '''press release''', '''news release''', '''media release''', '''press statement''' or '''video release''' is a written or recorded communication directed at members of the news media for the purpose of announcing something ostensibly newsworthy. Typically, they are mailed, [[fax]]ed, or e-mailed to assignment [[copy editing|editor]]s and [[Journalist|journalists]] at newspapers, magazines, radio stations, online media, television stations or television networks.

==Elements==
[[File:Wikimedia Foundation press release template.pdf|thumb|upright=1.1|An example of a press release, a Wikipedia press release template prepared by the Wikimedia Foundation communications team]]

Technically, anything deliberately sent to a reporter or media source is considered a press release: it is information released by the act of being sent to the media. However, public relations professionals often follow a standard format that they believe is efficient and increases their odds of getting the publicity they desire. The format is supposed to help journalists separate press releases from other PR communication methods, such as pitch letters or media advisories. Generally, a PR body consists of 4 to 5 paragraphs with word limit ranging from 400 to 500. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=James|first1=Geoffrey|title=How To Write a Press Release, with Examples|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-to-write-a-press-release-with-examples/|website=cbsnews.com|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, press releases can be anywhere from 300 to 800 words&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://service.prweb.com/resources/article/editorial-guidelines/|title=Editorial Guidelines for News Releases {{!}} PRWeb|website=PRWeb|access-date=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the internet has gained prevalence, the way journalists like to be approached has also changed. A format suggested by Kristen Nicole, a former [[Mashable]] writer who is now the Senior Managing Editor of SiliconANGLE.com. is sending one sentence as to why this story works for my publication, and 5 bullet points for context. Kristen also recommends pitching writers directly over pitching editors saying: 

"I’d recommend pitching the writer first, with an angle specific to their beat. If a case needs to be made to the editor, it can fare better coming from the writer, who’s already had an opportunity to work out an angle with the PR rep. As an editor, I’m more likely to prioritize emails coming from those I have personal relationships with. These have been built over the years from the days when I was the writer presenting to my editors. Starting a new relationship with me as an editor, the most successful pitches have been those offering high profile interviews (editors that still write columns will want to take these for themselves before passing them off to junior writers) or highly specific content, like an original guest contribution."
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pelt|first1=Mason|title=How to Get Press for Your Startup|url=http://tech.co/get-press-startup-2015-07|website=Tech.co|publisher=Tech.co|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these common structural elements include:

*'''[[Headline]]''' – used to grab the attention of journalists and briefly summarize the news.
*'''[[Dateline]]''' – contains the release date and usually the originating city of the press release. If the date listed is after the date that the information was actually sent to the media, then the sender is requesting a [[news embargo]], which journalists are under no obligation to honor.
*'''Introduction''' – first paragraph in a press release, that generally gives basic answers to the questions of who, what, when, where and why.
*'''Body''' – further explanation, statistics, background, or other details relevant to the news.
*'''Boilerplate''' – generally a short "about" section, providing independent background on the issuing company, organization, or individual.
*'''Close''' – in North America, traditionally the symbol "-30-" appears after the boilerplate or body and before the media contact information, indicating to media that the release has ended. A more modern equivalent has been the "###" symbol. In other countries, other means of indicating the end of the release may be used, such as the text "ends".
*'''Media contact information''' – name, phone number, email address, mailing address, or other contact information for the PR or other media relations contact person.

As the Internet has assumed growing prominence in the news cycle, press release writing styles have necessarily  evolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2009/09/prweb2815314.htm |title=For Businesses Chasing Recognition, The Print Media Is Losing Its Allure | first=Ron | last=Goodden | publisher=PRWeb | date=1 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Editors of online newsletters, for instance, often lack the staff to convert traditional press release prose into more readable, print-ready copy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://newswirenext.com/press-release-to-blog-post/ |title=Transforming a promotional press release to a highly informative post | publisher=NewswireNext | date=5 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution models==
In the traditional distribution model, the business, political campaign, or other entity releasing information to the media hires a publicity agency to write and distribute written information to the [[newswire]]s.&lt;ref name=troyunderwood&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.insideinvestorrelations.com/articles/financial-reporting/16166/wire-industry-feels-heat-self-publishing-tools-launch|title=Wire industry feels the heat as self-publishing tools launch|work=IR Magazine|first=Tim|last=Human|date=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newswire then disseminates the information as it is received or as investigated by a [[journalist]].

An alternative is the ''self-published press release''.  In this approach, press releases are either sent directly to local [[newspapers]] or to free and paid distribution services.&lt;ref name=Socialmarketing&gt;{{cite news|last1=McQuivey|first1=James|title=Social, Content Marketing Strategies, Trends for 2015: EmailWire Press Release Distribution Services Presents Guides, eBooks|url=http://www.cmo.com.au/mediareleases/21244/social-content-marketing-strategies-trends-for/|accessdate=22 December 2014|work=CIO Magazine|date=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distribution service then provides the content, as-is, to their media outlets for publication which is usually online.

==Video news releases==
{{details|video news release}}

Some public relations firms send out video news releases (VNRs) which are pre-taped video programs that can be aired intact by TV stations. Often, the VNRs are aired without the stations' identifying or attributing them as such.

TV news viewers can often detect the use of VNRs within television newscasts; for example, many movie-star "interviews" are actually VNRs, taped on a set which is located at the movie studio and decorated with the movie's logo. Another frequent example of VNRs masquerading as news footage is videotapes of particular medical "breakthroughs," that are really produced and distributed by pharmaceutical companies for the purpose of selling new medicines.

Video news releases can be in the form of full blown productions costing tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands. They can also be in the TV news format, or even produced for the web.

Recently, many broadcast news outlets have discouraged the use of VNRs. Many stations, citing an already poor public perception, want to increase their credibility. Public relations companies are having a tougher time getting their pre-edited video aired.

VNRs can be turned into podcasts then posted onto newswires. Further to this, a story can be kept running longer by engaging "community websites", which are monitored and commented on by many journalists and features writers.

==Embargoing==
Sometimes a press release is distributed early and [[Embargo (journalism)|embargoed]] – that is, news organizations are requested not to report the story until a specified time. For instance, news organizations usually receive a copy of presidential speeches several hours in advance. Product or media [[reviewer]]s are commonly given a sample or preview of a product ahead of its release date.

Unless the journalist has voluntarily agreed to honor the embargo in advance, usually via a legally binding [[non-disclosure agreement]], the journalist is under no obligation to  it.  However, even in the absence of any obligation, news organizations generally do not break the embargo for sources that they wish to cultivate.  If they do, then the agency or client that sent the release may [[blacklist]] them.

== Positives ==
Press release material can be beneficial towards media corporations because releases help decrease costs and improve the amount of material a firm can output in a certain amount of time. Due to the material being pre-packaged, this saves journalists time, not only in writing a story, but also the time and money it would have taken to capture the news firsthand.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewis|first=Justin|last2=Williams|first2=Andrew|last3=Franklin|first3=Bob|date=2008-02-01|title=A Compromised Fourth Estate?|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14616700701767974|journal=Journalism Studies|volume=9|issue=1|pages=1–20|doi=10.1080/14616700701767974|issn=1461-670X}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Negatives ==
Although the utilization of press release material can save a company time and money, it makes the distributed media boring and similar to the output of other firms. In the [[Information Age|digital age]], consumers want to get their information instantly and this puts pressure on media companies to output as much material as possible. This often causes them to heavily rely on the use of press releases in order to create their stories.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Effects of press releases ==
Press releases are crucial from the point of view of public companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Srinivasan|first=Shuba|last2=Pauwels|first2=Koen|last3=Silva-Risso|first3=Jorge|last4=Hanssens|first4=Dominique M|date=2013-05-29|title=Product Innovations, Advertising, and Stock Returns|url=http://journals.ama.org/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.73.1.24?code=amma-site|journal=Journal of Marketing|language=en|volume=73|issue=1|pages=24–43|doi=10.1509/jmkg.73.1.24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[professional certification]], '''trade certification''', or '''professional designation''' (often called simply ''certification'' or ''qualification'') is a designation earned by a person to assure that he/she is qualified to perform a job or task. Certifications, generally, need to be renewed periodically, or may be valid for a specific period of time (e.g. the lifetime of the product upon which the individual is certified). As a part of a complete renewal of an individual's certification, it is common for the individual to show evidence of continual learning &amp;mdash; often termed [[continuing education]] &amp;mdash; or earning [[continuing education unit]]s (CEU).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2398">'''Reuter concession''' was a contract signed in 1872 between [[Paul Reuter|Baron Julius de Reuter]] (born Israel Beer Josaphat), a British banker and businessman, and [[Nasir al-Din Shah]], Qajar king of Persia. The concession gave him control over Persian roads, telegraphs, mills, factories, extraction of resources, and other public works in exchange for a stipulated sum for 5 years and 60% of all the net revenue for 20 years. The concession was so immense that even imperialists like [[Lord Curzon]] characterized it as the most complete grant ever made of control of resources by any country to a foreigner.&lt;ref&gt;Curzon, Persia, p480.&lt;/ref&gt; Local clergy were outraged by the concession and flyers were distributed in [[Tehran]] proclaiming that a Jew, Baron Reuter, will be in charge of country's affairs and that he plans to pass the railroad through the holy shrine in south Tehran. Clergy believed that this railroad plan is the work of Satan and will bring corruption to the Muslim lands.&lt;ref&gt;Iran's Diverse Peoples: A Reference Sourcebook, Massoumeh Price.&lt;/ref&gt; The concession was met with not only domestic outrage in the form of local protests but the Russian government was also hostile towards the concession as well.&lt;ref&gt; Keddie, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  Under immense pressure, [[Nasir al-Din Shah]] consequently canceled the agreement despite his deteriorating financial situation. The concession cancellation was also due to British government refusing to support Reuter's unrealistic ambitions.  While the concession lasted for approximately a year, the entire debacle set the foundation for the [[Tobacco Protest|revolts against the tobacco concession in 1890]] as it demonstrated that any attempt by a foreign power to infringe upon Iranian [[sovereignty]] would infuriate the local population as well as rival European powers, in this case the Russian government, who had their own interests in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Lambton, Ann. ''Qajar Persia''. University of Texas Press, 1987, p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reuter concession cancellation however resulted in the second Reuter concession which led to the formation of [[Imperial Bank of Persia]] by Baron Julius de Reuter.

[[File:Russian museam.JPG|thumb|Entrance of the old Mikhailovsky Palace, guarded by two ''[[Medici lions]]''.]]

The '''State Russian Museum''' ({{lang-ru|Государственный Русский музей}}), formerly the '''Russian Museum of His Imperial Majesty Alexander III''' ({{lang-ru|Русский Музей Императора Александра III}}), located on [[Arts Square (Saint Petersburg)|Arts Square]]  in [[Saint Petersburg]], is the world's largest depository of [[Russia]]n fine art. It is also one of the [[list of largest art museums in the world|largest]] museums in the country.

==Creation==
The [[museum]] was established on April 13, 1895, upon enthronement of [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] to commemorate his father, [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]]. Its original collection was composed of artworks taken from the [[Hermitage Museum]], [[Alexander Palace]], and the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]]. After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], many private collections were [[nationalization|nationalized]] and relocated to the Russian Museum. These included [[Kazimir Malevich]]'s ''Black Square''.

==Architecture==
The main building of the museum is the [[Old Michael Palace|Mikhailovsky Palace]], a splendid [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] residence of [[Grand Duke Michael Pavlovich of Russia|Grand Duke Michael Pavlovich]], erected in 1819-25 to a design by [[Carlo Rossi (architect)|Carlo Rossi]] on Square of Arts in St Petersburg. Upon the death of the Grand Duke the residence was named after [[Elena Pavlovna of Württemberg|his wife]] as the ''Palace of the Grand Duchess Elena Pavlovna'', and became famous for its many theatrical presentations and balls.

Some of the halls of the palace retain the Italianate opulent interiors&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rusmuseum.ru/ru/museum/shtml/16.shtml Italianate opulent interiors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050220012048/http://www.rusmuseum.ru/ru/museum/shtml/16.shtml |date=2005-02-20 }}, Russian Museum, Russia.&lt;/ref&gt; of the former imperial residence. Other buildings assigned to the Russian museum include the [[Summer Palace of Peter I]] (1710–14), the [[Marble Palace]] of [[Count Orlov]] (1768–85), [[St Michael's Castle]] of [[Emperor Paul]] (1797–1801), and the [[Rastrelli]]esque [[Stroganov Palace]] on the [[Nevsky Prospekt]] (1752–54).

==Collection==
Today the collection shows Russian art beginning in the 12th century up to the socialist realism and in the USSR the inofficial art of the 20th century. In 1995 the Ludwig-Museum was funded, which is a substantial collection of contemporary art. The collection holds important masterpieces since 1945, amongst others [[Jasper Johns]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Jeff Koons]], [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], [[Andy Warhol]], [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Ilja Kabakow]], [[Jörg Immendorff]], [[Werner Branz]] and [[Gottfried Helnwein]].

==Exhibits==
[[File:Sankt-Petěrburg 119.jpg|thumb|The [[Russian Museum of Ethnography]].]]

The [[Ethnography|Ethnographic]] Department was originally set up in a building specially designed by [[Vladimir Svinyin]] in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encspb.ru/en/article.php?kod=2804034482 Russian Museum]. Accessed 8 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The museum soon housed gifts received by Emperor's family from representatives of peoples inhabiting various regions of the Russian Empire. Further exhibits were purchased by Nicholas II and other members of his family as State financing was not enough to purchase new exhibits. In 1934, the Ethnographic Department was given the status of an independent museum: the [[Russian Museum of Ethnography]].

==Málaga branch==
The city of [[Málaga]], home to thousands of Russian expats, has signed an agreement to host the first overseas branch of the State Russian Museum. Works displayed in Malaga will range from Byzantine-inspired icons to social realism of the Soviet era. They will be on display in {{convert|2,300|m2|ft2|abbr=off}}yards) of exhibition space in La Tabacalera, a 1920s tobacco factory. The new museum is scheduled to open in early 2015.

The '''smartphone wars''' or '''smartphone patents licensing and litigation''' refers to commercial struggles among [[smartphone]] manufacturers including [[Sony Mobile]], [[Google]], [[Apple Inc.]], [[Samsung Electronics|Samsung]], [[Microsoft]], [[Nokia]], [[Motorola Mobility|Motorola]], [[Huawei]], [[LG Electronics]], [[ZTE]] and [[HTC]], and others, by [[Patent infringement|patent litigation]] and other means. The conflict is part of the wider [[Technology patent wars|"patent wars"]] between technology and software corporations. The patent wars occurred because a finished smartphone might involve hundreds of thousands of patents.

To secure and increase [[market share]], companies granted a [[patent]] can sue to prevent competitors from using the methods the patent covers.

'''''The 50 Greatest Cartoons: As Selected by 1,000 Animation Professionals''''' is a 1994 book by [[animation historian]] [[Jerry Beck]]. It consists of articles about 50 highly regarded animated short films made in North America and other notable cartoons, which are ranked according to a poll of 1,000 people working in the animation industry.

Each cartoon is under 30 minutes long and [[cel animated]] (with the exception of ''[[Gertie the Dinosaur]]''). Seventeen of the selected films were produced for [[Warner Bros.]]'s ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' series, ten of which were directed by [[Chuck Jones]]. All of the selected cartoons were created and released before 1960, except for the 1985 short ''[[The Big Snit]]'' ({{Numero|25}}), the 1988 short ''[[The Cat Came Back (1988 film)|The Cat Came Back]]'' ({{Numero|32}}), the 1969 short ''[[Bambi Meets Godzilla]]'' ({{Numero|38}}), the 1987 short ''[[The Man Who Planted Trees (film)|The Man Who Planted Trees]]'' ({{Numero|44}}), and the 1975 short ''[[Quasi at the Quackadero]]'' ({{Numero|46}}). &lt;ref&gt;[https://mubi.com/lists/the-50-greatest-cartoons-as-selected-by-1000-animation-professionals] The 50 Greatest Cartoons-MUBI&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:The Dorset House, Shelburne Museum, Shelburne VT.jpg|thumb|right|250px|&lt;center&gt;The Dorset House&lt;/center&gt;]]
The '''Dorset House''' is an exhibit building at [[Shelburne Museum]] in [[Shelburne, Vermont]], [[United States]]; it houses the museum's collection of 900 [[Duck decoy (model)|wildfowl decoys]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.shelburnemuseum.org/collections/detail.php?id=5 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-03-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131031907/http://shelburnemuseum.org/collections/detail.php?id=5 |archive-date=2009-01-31 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, [[Shelburne Museum]] purchased Dorset House, dismantled it, and reconstructed it on the Museum grounds to house the collection of decoys, [[punt gun]]s, and prints of sporting scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.shelburnemuseum.org/buildings_and_grounds/detail.php?id=7 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-03-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005011932/http://www.shelburnemuseum.org/buildings_and_grounds/detail.php?id=7 |archive-date=2006-10-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Welcome Allen built Dorset House about 1832 in [[North Dorset, Vermont]]. Like many houses of its period, it reflects the popularity of [[Greek Revival]] architecture, which gained prominence in the United States during the second quarter of the 19th century. While classical design motifs had predominated in American architecture from the late 18th century, by the 19th century American architects began to draw inspiration specifically from Grecian temples. Often considered the first national style, Greek Revival architecture became so pervasive in the United States in part because regional architects could access the classical idiom through publications such as Stuart &amp; Revett’s Antiquities of Athens &lt;ref&gt;Stuart, James and Nicholas Revett. Antiques of Athens. Ayer Co., 1968&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Asher Benjamin]]’s 1797 pattern book The Country Builder’s Companion.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, Asher. The Country Builder's Assistant. 1797&lt;/ref&gt; Vernacular Greek Revival architecture developed across the United States as local builders combined classical elements with local traditions creating distinct regional characteristics within the style.&lt;ref name="Shelburne Museum 1993"&gt;Shelburne Museum. 1993. ''Shelburne Museum: A Guide to the Collections''. Shelburne: Shelburne Museum, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Allen built Dorset House for his children, Florenze and Lucia. Allen’s interpretation of the Greek Revival resulted in Dorset House’s substantial yet unpretentious silhouette. He designed the house with mirroring wings so that his children and their families would have separate living quarters that they could access through individual doors. In combining the two cross-gabled flanking wings with the massive corniced façade, Allen achieved the classical balance and symmetry characteristic of the Greek Revival style.&lt;ref name="Shelburne Museum 1993"/&gt;

Allen, and later his son Florenze, was proprietor of an iron foundry that produced stove plates, plow points, and kettles. Subsequently, unlike most homes of the era, Allen designed Dorset House without open hearths and used closed iron stoves to heat the building instead.&lt;ref name="Shelburne Museum 1993"/&gt;

==Decoys==
[[Wildfowl]] [[duck decoy (model)|decoy]]s, made to lure game birds to within shooting range, have been used by American hunters for centuries. Native Americans originated the idea over a thousand years ago in response to the abundance of the continent’s wild game. The earliest decoys made by white settlers were probably carved in the late 18th century. The idea spread rapidly and by 1840 the wooden [[duck decoy (model)|decoy]] was firmly established in American hunting traditions.

Following the [[American Civil War]], improved transpiration systems, more advanced weapons, and abundant game combined to crate what has been called the greatest wildfowl hunt in history of the world. Professional market gunners worked in most areas supplying game to meet intense public demand. Well-made decoys were among the tools most vital to their trade. To meet the needs of the market gunners and the many well-to-do [[sportsmen]] who traveled from the cities to shoot birds, scores of craftsmen turned to decoy-making full-time. Just before 1900, such firms as mason’s decoy factory of [[Detroit]], which employed a number of carvers working from the same patterns, offered decoys by mail order. Federal conservation legislation brought the market-gunning era to an end just after [[World War I]]. However, sportsmen continued to hunt over wooden decoys until after [[World War II]], when inexpensive molded [[plastic]] decoys took over the marketplace.

[[Shelburne Museum]]’s collection of nearly nine hundred working decoys, housed in '''Dorset House''', is the finest and most comprehensive public collection in the world. It contains superb examples by master craftsmen from all over North America, including an Elmer Crowell- whose wide variety of working decoys, decorative carvings and miniatures prove him to be the most versatile of the old-time masters- and such well kjnown carvers as Bill Bowman, Lee Dudley, [[Nathan Cobb]], Lem Ward, Steve Ward, [[Joseph Lincoln]], Albert Laing, Shang Wheeler, George Warin and John Blair. There is also a small collection of fish decoys, used by ice fishermen to lure pike, muskellunge and other predators within spearing range.

Every major hunting area in North America produced decoys. Differences in hunting methods and water conditions affected local decoy-making traditions, and dozens of regional variations developed. Exhibits in the Dorset House are arranged by region to allow easy comparison of the treatment of like species by carvers from different regions and more subtly within regions. [[Maine]] decoys, for example as seen in the work of [[Gus Wilson]], are typically solid-bodied with wide, flat bottoms and simple paint patterns. By contrast [[Illinois]] decoys such as those made by Robert and Catherine Elliston, are hollow-bodied with rounded bottoms and elaborately detailed paint. Other regional styles, including those of [[Louisiana]], [[Virginia]], the [[Chesapeake Bay]], [[New Jersey]], [[Long Island]], [[Connecticut]], [[Quebec]] and [[Ontario]] are equally distinctive.

In addition to decoys, many carvers also crafted miniatures and decorative birds. Elmer Crowell of [[Cape Cod]] was a pioneer in these areas. He offered his customers what he called a “songless aviary,” producing miniature [[songbird]]s, [[shorebird]]s, and [[duck]]s insets of twenty-five species and also creating many life-sized decorative carvings of birds and fish. A wide variety of Crowell’s work, including a [[heron]] used as a garden ornament, several wall-mounted flying birds and nearly a hundred miniatures, is exhibited in the '''Dorset House'''. Miniatures and decorative carvings by such other masters as Lem Ward, A.J. King and Harold Haertel are also on exhibit.

'''''The State of Things''''' ({{lang-de|'''Der Stand der Dinge'''}}) is a 1982 film directed by [[Wim Wenders]]. It tells the story of a film crew stuck in [[Portugal]] after the production runs out of [[film stock]] and money. The director travels to [[Los Angeles]] in search of his missing producer.

== Plot ==
A film crew in Portugal shoots a black-and-white [[science fiction]] film about the survivors on a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] Earth, titled ''The Survivors''. The shooting stops when the production runs out of film stock and money. In an abandoned hotel, the crew waits for money to arrive or a sign from vanished producer Gordon. As they grow restless and bored, the film depicts some of their philosophical thoughts and emotional reactions. Director Friedrich Munro finally sets off to find Gordon in Los Angeles who hides in a mobile home because of money he owes to the [[American Mafia|Mafia]].

== Cast ==
*[[Patrick Bauchau]] as Friedrich, the Director
*[[Allen Garfield]] (as Allen Goorwitz) as Gordon, the Producer
*[[Isabelle Weingarten]] as Anna
*[[Rebecca Pauly]] as Joan
*[[Jeffrey Kime]] as Mark
*Geoffrey Carey as Robert
*[[Camilla Mora]] as Julia
*[[Alexandra Auder]] as Jane
*[[John Paul Getty III|Paul Getty Jr.]] as Dennis, the Writer
*[[Viva (Warhol superstar)|Viva]] (as Viva Auder) as Kate
*[[Samuel Fuller]] as Joe, the Cameraman
*[[Roger Corman]] as the Lawyer
*[[Janet Rasak]] as Karen
*[[Artur Semedo]] as the Production Manager
*[[Francisco Baião]] as the Soundman
*[[Robert Kramer]] as the Camera operator
*[[Monty Bane]] as Herbert

== Filming ==
The film emerged during the production of Wenders' 1981 ''[[Hammett (film)|Hammett]]'' for [[Francis Ford Coppola]]. Coppola interrupted the shooting to have the screenplay re-written. Wenders returned to Europe for an intermediate film project, which was not realized in the end. He then went to Portugal to help out director [[Raúl Ruiz (director)|Raúl Ruiz]] with film stock during the making of his film ''[[The Territory]]'' (1981). Wenders hired much of the cast and crew to make ''The State of Things'', including lead [[cinematographer]] [[Henri Alekan]], the noted photographer of [[Jean Cocteau]]'s 1946 motion picture ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1946 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]''. After completing the filming in Portugal, Wenders flew to Los Angeles to shoot the final scenes before continuing work on ''Hammett''.&lt;ref&gt;Wim Wenders on the 2005 released German DVD of ''The State of Things'' (''Der Stand der Dinge'').&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background info ==
''The State of Things'' bears many references to other movies and movie makers. Fictitious director Friedrich Munro's name is an homage to silent film director [[F. W. Murnau|Friedrich Murnau]]. The name of his cameraman Joe Corby is an anagram of [[Joe Biroc]]. Other film makers and films referred to are [[Fritz Lang]], ''[[The Searchers (film)|The Searchers]]'', ''[[Body and Soul (1947 film)|Body and Soul]]'', ''[[Thieves' Highway]]'', ''[[He Ran All the Way]]'' and ''[[They Drive by Night]]''.

The soundtrack includes original music from [[Jürgen Knieper]], as well as tracks from [[Joe Ely]], [[X (U.S. band)|X]] and [[The Del-Byzanteens]]. [[Jim Jarmusch]] was a then member of The Del-Byzanteens which often leads to the misinformation that Jarmusch co-wrote the music score. Leftover film stock from ''The State of Things'' was later used on the first third of Jarmusch's 1984 black-and-white film ''[[Stranger Than Paradise]]''.

Although the film ''The Survivors'', which the crew is shooting during the opening of ''The State of Things'', was repeatedly called a remake of either ''[[Day the World Ended]]'' or ''[[Most Dangerous Man Alive]]'' by reviewers and encyclopaedia,&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Maltin's 2008 Movie Guide, Signet/New American Library, New York 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0084725|title=The State of Things}}&lt;/ref&gt; it bears no close resemblance to either except for the post-apocalyptic scenery.

In 1994, Wenders made ''[[Lisbon Story (1994 film)|Lisbon Story]]'', in which the fictitious film director in ''The State of Things'', Friedrich Munro (played again by Bauchau), reappears under the name Friedrich Monroe, having expatriated to Portugal.

== Awards ==
The film won the [[Golden Lion]] at the [[Venice Film Festival]] of 1982. In 1983, it won the [[Deutscher Filmpreis|German Film Award]] in Gold for Cinematography and in Silver for [[German Film Award for Best Feature Film|Best Feature Film]].

The '''Uffizi Gallery''' ({{lang-it|'''Galleria degli Uffizi'''|italic=no}}, {{IPA-it|ɡalleˈriːa deʎʎ ufˈfittsi|pron}}) is a prominent [[art museum]] located adjacent to the [[Piazza della Signoria]] in the [[Historic Centre of Florence]] in the region of Tuscany, Italy. One of the most important Italian museums, and the most visited, it is also one of the largest and best known in the world, and holds a collection of priceless works, particularly from the period of the [[Italian Renaissance painting|Italian Renaissance.]]

After the ruling [[house of Medici]] died out, their art collections were gifted to the city of Florence under the famous ''Patto di famiglia'' negotiated by [[Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici|Anna Maria Luisa]], the last Medici heiress.  The Uffizi is one of the first modern museums. The gallery had been open to visitors by request since the sixteenth century, and in 1765 it was officially opened to the public, formally becoming a museum in 1865.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.florence-museum.com/uffizi-gallery-tickets.php|title=Uffizi Gallery Tickets - Museums Tickets Florence Uffizi Gallery|website=www.florence-museum.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the Uffizi is one of the most popular [[tourist attraction]]s of Florence and one of the most visited art museums in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.beniculturali.it/mibac/export/MiBAC/sito-MiBAC/Contenuti/visualizza_asset.html_2128864006.html|title=L'Esperienza dei primi diretorri dei musei autonom|last=|first=|date=13 November 2017|website=www.beniculturali.it.|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
[[File:Uffizi Gallery - Michelangelo painting "Tondo Doni".JPG|thumbnail|Visitors observing [[Michelangelo]] painting ''[[Doni Tondo]]''. Uffizi is ranked as the 25th on the [[list of most visited art museums in the world|most visited art museums in the world]], with around 2 million visitors annually.]]
The building of Uffizi complex was begun by [[Giorgio Vasari]] in 1560 for [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo I de' Medici]] so as to accommodate the offices of the Florentine magistrates, hence the name {{lang|it|uffizi}}, "offices". The construction was later continued by [[Alfonso Parigi the Elder|Alfonso Parigi]] and [[Bernardo Buontalenti]]; it was completed in 1581. The top floor was made into a gallery for the family and their guests and included their collection of Roman sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uffizi.com/history-uffizi-gallery.asp|title=History of Uffizi Gallery.|website=www.uffizi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''cortile'' (internal courtyard) is so long and narrow, and open to the [[Arno]] at its far end through a [[Doric order|Doric screen]] that articulates the space without blocking it, that architectural historians&lt;ref&gt;[[Sigfried Giedion]], ''Space, Time and Architecture'' (1941) 1962 fig.17.&lt;/ref&gt; treat it as the first regularized streetscape of Europe. Vasari, a painter and architect as well, emphasised its [[perspective (visual)|perspective]] length by adorning it with the matching facades' continuous roof cornices, and unbroken cornices between storeys, as well as the three continuous steps on which the palace-fronts stand. The niches in the piers that alternate with columns of the [[Loggiato degli Uffizi|Loggiato]]  filled with sculptures of famous artists in the 19th century.

[[File:Statues in Niches Outside the Uffizi Gallery, Florence.jpg|thumb|''[[Cosimo de' Medici]]'' by Luigi Magi and ''Andrea Di Cione'' ([[Orcagna]]) by Niccolò Bazzanti]]

The Uffizi brought together under one roof the administrative offices and the Archivio di Stato, the state archive. The project was intended to display prime art works of the Medici collections on the [[piano nobile]]; the plan was carried out by his son, Grand Duke [[Francesco I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Francesco I]]. He commissioned the architect Buontalenti to design the [[Tribuna of the Uffizi|Tribuna degli Uffizi]] that would display a series of masterpieces in one room, including jewels; it became a highly influential attraction of a [[Grand Tour]]. The octagonal room was completed in 1584.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.virtualuffizi.com/tribune.html|title=Tribuna :: Hall n. 18 ► Virtual Uffizi|website=Virtual Uffizi Gallery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, more sections of the palace were recruited to exhibit paintings and sculpture collected or commissioned by the [[House of Medici|Medici]]. According to Vasari, who was not only the architect of the Uffizi but also the author of ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects|Lives of the Artists]]'', published in 1550 and 1568, artists such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Michelangelo]] gathered at the Uffizi "for beauty, for work and for recreation."&lt;ref&gt;Fossi, Gloria. ''The Uffizi.'' (Giuniti, 1999), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years, 45 to 50 rooms were used to display paintings from the 13th to 18th century.&lt;ref name="florence-museum.com"/&gt;

==Modern times==
Because of its huge collection, some of the Uffizi's works have in the past been transferred to other museums in Florence—for example, some famous [[statue]]s to the [[Bargello]]. A project was finished in 2006 to expand the museum's exhibition space some 6,000 metres² (64,000&amp;nbsp;ft²) to almost 13,000 metres² (139,000&amp;nbsp;ft²), allowing public viewing of many [[Work of art|artwork]]s that had usually been in storage.  

The Nuovi Uffizi (New Uffizi) renovation project which started in 1989 was progressing well in 2015 to 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.virtualuffizi.com/new-halls.html|title=Discover the New Halls at Uffizi|website=Virtual Uffizi Gallery}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was intended to modernize all of the halls and more than double the display space. As well, a new exit was planned and the lighting, air conditioning and security systems were updated. During construction, the museum remained open, although rooms were closed as necessary with the artwork temporarily moved to another location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uffizi.org/museum/history/|title=History|work=uffizi.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704205233/http://www.uffizi.org/museum/history/|archivedate=2015-07-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Botticelli rooms and two others with early Renaissance paintings were closed for 15 months but reopened in October 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uffizi.org/2383-the-botticelli-rooms-reopen/|title=New Uffizi: The Botticelli &amp; Early Renaissance Rooms Reopen|date=19 October 2016|work=uffizi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major modernization project, New Uffizi, had increased viewing capacity to 101 rooms by late 2016 by expanding into areas previously used by the Florence State Archive.&lt;ref name="uffizi.org"/&gt;

The Uffizi hosted over two million visitors in 2016, making it the most visited art gallery in Italy.&lt;ref name="beniculturali.it"/&gt; In high season (particularly in July), waiting times can be up to five hours. Tickets are available on-line in advance, however, to significantly reduce the waiting time.&lt;ref name="florence-museum.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.florence-museum.com/uffizi-gallery-tickets.php?gclid=Cj0KEQjwkN3KBRCu2fWmy9LLqN4BEiQANP9-WiEJRersqPn3481j_HwsmJ4uOR1qBGGtITSC0uYlxJYaAlsT8P8HAQ|title=Uffizi Gallery Tickets - Museums Tickets Florence Uffizi Gallery|website=www.florence-museum.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new ticketing system is currently being tested to reduce queuing times from hours to just minutes.&lt;ref name="traveller.com.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.traveller.com.au/uffizi-gallery-florence-queuing-times-cut-from-hours-to-minutes-with-new-system-h16fkx|title=Uffizi gallery, Florence: Queuing times cut from hours to minutes with new system|first=Nick|last=Squires|date=12 October 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum is being renovated to more than double the number of rooms used to display artwork.&lt;ref name="uffizi.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uffizi.org/2383-the-botticelli-rooms-reopen/|title=New Uffizi: The Botticelli &amp; Early Renaissance Rooms Reopen|date=19 October 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incidents==
On 27 May 1993, the [[Sicilian Mafia]] carried out a [[car bomb]] explosion in [[Massacre of via dei Georgofili|Via dei Georgofili]] and damaged parts of the palace, killing five people. The blast destroyed five pieces of art and damaged another 30. Some of the paintings were fully protected by bulletproof glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/28/world/bomb-outside-uffizi-in-florence-kills-6-and-damages-many-works.html|title=Bomb Outside Uffizi in Florence Kills 6 and Damages Many Works|first=Alan|last=Cowell|date=28 May 1993|publisher=|via=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most severe damage was to the [[Niobe]] room and classical sculptures and [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] interior (which have since been restored), although its [[fresco]]es were damaged beyond repair.

In early August 2007, Florence experienced a heavy rainstorm. The Gallery was partially flooded, with water leaking through the ceiling, and the visitors had to be evacuated. There was a much more significant [[1966 Flood of the Arno River|flood in 1966]] which damaged most of the art collections in Florence severely, including some of the works in the Uffizi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/why-florence-still-lives-in-fear-of-the-flood-1350491.html|title=Why Florence still lives in fear of the flood|date=3 November 1996|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ultra''' was the designation adopted by [[United Kingdom|British]] [[military intelligence]] in June 1941 for wartime [[signals intelligence]] obtained by breaking high-level [[encrypt]]ed enemy [[radio]] and [[teleprinter]] communications at the [[Government Communications Headquarters#Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS)|Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS)]] at [[Bletchley Park]].{{sfn|Hinsley|Stripp|1993|p=xx}} ''Ultra'' eventually became the standard designation among the western [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] for all such intelligence. The name arose because the intelligence thus obtained was considered more important than that designated by the highest British [[Classified information|security classification]] then used (''Most Secret'') and so was regarded as being ''Ultra secret''.{{sfn|Lewin|2001|p=64}} Several other [[cryptonym]]s had been used for such intelligence.

The code name ''Boniface'' was used as a cover name for ''Ultra''. In order to ensure that the successful code-breaking did not become apparent to the Germans, British intelligence created a fictional MI6 master spy, Boniface, who controlled a fictional series of agents throughout Germany. Information obtained through code-breaking was often attributed to the [[human intelligence (espionage)|human intelligence]] from the Boniface network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2014/nov/28/imitation-game-alan-turing-us-intelligence-ian-fleming|title=The Imitation Game: how Alan Turing played dumb to fool US intelligence - David Cox|first=David|last=Cox|date=28 November 2014|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=z_CtAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT56&amp;dq=bletchley+boniface&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=bletchley+boniface&amp;f=false|title=The Secrets of Station X: How the Bletchley Park codebreakers helped win the war|first=Michael|last=Smith|date=31 October 2011|publisher=Biteback Publishing|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. used the codename ''[[Magic (cryptography)|Magic]]'' for its decrypts from Japanese sources including the so-called "Purple" cipher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=uccLlgJDk4gC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=code+breaking+WW+II+code+name+magic&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjH06Sxj_DVAhVr_4MKHYyVC7UQ6AEIMDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=code+breaking+WW+II+code+name+magic&amp;f=false|title=Battle of Wits: The Complete Story of Codebreaking in World War II|first=Stephen|last=Budiansky|date=27 June 2018|publisher=Simon and Schuster|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the [[Nazi Germany|German]] cipher traffic was encrypted on the [[Enigma machine]]. Used properly, the German military Enigma would have been virtually unbreakable; in practice, shortcomings in operation allowed it to be broken. The term "Ultra" has often been used almost synonymously with "[[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma|Enigma decrypts]]". However, Ultra also encompassed decrypts of the German [[Lorenz cipher|Lorenz SZ 40/42 machines]] that were used by the German High Command, and the [[C-36 (cipher machine)|Hagelin machine]].{{efn|The Hagelin C-38m (a development of the C-36) was the model used by the Italian Navy,&lt;ref&gt;see: {{citation|url=http://www.cryptomuseum.com/crypto/hagelin/index.htm|title=Crypto AG: Hagelin cipher machines }}&lt;/ref&gt; and other Italian and Japanese ciphers and codes such as [[PURPLE]] and [[JN-25]].{{sfn|Hinsley|Stripp|1993|p=xx}}}}

Many observers, at the time and later, regarded Ultra as immensely valuable to the Allies. [[Winston Churchill]] was reported to have told [[King George VI]], when presenting to him [[Stewart Menzies]] (head of the [[Secret Intelligence Service]] and the person who controlled distribution of Ultra decrypts to the government): "It is thanks to the secret weapon of General Menzies, put into use on all the fronts, that we won the war!"{{efn|The original source for this quote is from Gustave Bertrand's book ''Enigma ou la plus grande énigme de la guerre 1939–1945'', p. 256, at the end of a short passage asserting the importance of Enigma-derived intelligence for Allied victory. The text there is: "Sans parler de cette entrevue historique, la guerre finie, où Sir Winston Churchill, présentant à S.M. George VI le Chef de l'I.S., prononça ces paroles; ''qui m'ont été rapportées par le général Menziès lui-même:'' « C'est grâce à l'Arme Secrète du général Menziès, mise en œuvre sur tous les Fronts, que nous avons gagné la Guerre! » "  This can be translated as: "Not to mention this historic meeting, after the war, in which Sir Winston Churchill, presenting to H.M. George VI the Chief of the I.S., stated these words, ''that were reported to me by General Menzies himself'': 'It is thanks to the secret weapon of General Menzies, put into use on all the fronts, that we won the war!'"  It is not clear when, or on what occasion, Churchill made this statement or when Menzies later related it to Bertrand, who published this in 1973.  In his 1987 book ''"C": The Secret Life of Sir Stewart Graham Menzies'', Anthony Cave Brown rendered this as "Churchill told King George VI in Menzies's presence that 'it was thanks to Ultra that we won the war.'" (p. 671) He sourced this (p. 812n) to the same page of the Bertrand book. Subsequent English-language publications have picked up and repeated Cave Brown's formulation, but the quote related by Menzies and Bertrand was longer and Churchill did not use the term 'Ultra' to the King, who may not have been familiar with it.}} [[F. W. Winterbotham]] quoted the western Supreme Allied Commander, [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], at war's end describing Ultra as having been "decisive" to Allied victory.{{sfn|Winterbotham|1974|pp=154, 191}} [[Harry Hinsley|Sir Harry Hinsley]], Bletchley Park veteran and official historian of British Intelligence in World War II, made a similar assessment of Ultra, saying that while the Allies would have won the war without it,&lt;ref name="hinsley-intro"/&gt; "the war would have been something like two years longer, perhaps three years longer, possibly four years longer than it was."{{sfn|Hinsley|1996}}  However, Hinsley and others have emphasized the difficulties of [[counterfactual history]] in attempting such conclusions, and some historians have said the shortening might have been as little as the three months it took the United States to deploy the [[atomic bomb]].&lt;ref name="hinsley-intro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="richelson"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HohPaIyc5G0C&amp;pg=PA196 | title=A Century of Spies: Intelligence in the Twentieth Century | first=Jeffery T. | last=Richelson | authorlink=Jeffrey T. Richelson | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=New York | date=1997 | page=296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of Ultra was kept secret for many years after the war.  After it was revealed in the middle 1970s, historians have altered the historiography of World War II. For example, Andrew Roberts, writing in the 21st century, states, "Because he had the invaluable advantage of being able to read [General Erwin] Rommel's Enigma communications, [Field Marshall Bernard] Montgomery knew how short the Germans were of men, ammunition, food and above all fuel. When he put Rommel's picture up in his caravan he wanted to be seen to be almost reading his opponent's mind. In fact he was reading his mail."{{sfn|Roberts|2009|p=297}}  Over time, Ultra has become embedded in the public consciousness and Bletchley Park has become a significant visitor attraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/news/v.rhtm/Bletchley_Park_welcomes_2015s_200000th_visitor-908901.html|title= Bletchley Park Welcomes 2015’S 200,000th Visitor|publisher=Bletchley Park|date=26 August 2015|accessdate=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As stated by historian Thomas Haigh, "The British code-breaking effort of the Second World War, formerly secret, is now one of the most celebrated aspects of modern British history, an inspiring story in which a free society mobilized its intellectual resources against a terrible enemy."&lt;ref name="haigh"/&gt;

==Sources of intelligence==
Most Ultra intelligence was derived from reading radio messages that had been encrypted with cipher machines, complemented by material from radio communications using [[traffic analysis]] and [[direction finding]]. In the early phases of the war, particularly during the eight-month [[Phoney War]], the Germans could transmit most of their messages using [[Landline|land lines]] and so had no need to use radio. This meant that those at Bletchley Park had some time to build up experience of collecting and starting to decrypt messages on the various [[radio network]]s. German Enigma messages were the main source, with those of the [[Luftwaffe]] predominating, as they used radio more and their operators were particularly ill-disciplined.

====Enigma====
{{main article|Cryptanalysis of the Enigma}}
"[[Enigma machine|Enigma]]" refers to a family of electro-mechanical [[Rotor machine|rotor cipher machines]]. These produced a [[Polyalphabetic cipher|polyalphabetic substitution cipher]] and were widely thought to be unbreakable in the 1920s, when a variant of the commercial Model D was first used by the [[Reichswehr]]. The [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]], [[Kriegsmarine|Navy]], [[Luftwaffe|Air Force]], [[Nazi party]], [[Gestapo]] and German diplomats used Enigma machines in several variants. [[Abwehr]]  (German military intelligence) used a four-rotor machine without a plugboard and Naval Enigma used different key management from that of the army or air force, making its traffic far more difficult to cryptanalyse; each variant required different cryptanalytic treatment. The commercial versions were not as secure and [[Alfred Dillwyn Knox|Dilly Knox]] of GC&amp;CS, is said to have broken one before the war.

German military Enigma was first broken in December 1932 by the [[Biuro Szyfrów|Polish Cipher Bureau]], using a combination of brilliant mathematics, the services of a spy in the German office responsible for administering encrypted communications, and good luck.{{sfn|Singh|1999|p=145}}{{sfn|Copeland|2004|pp=231, 232}} The Poles read Enigma to the outbreak of World War II and beyond, in France.{{sfn|Kozaczuk|1984|pp=81–92}} At the turn of 1939, the Germans made the systems ten times more complex, which required a tenfold increase in Polish decryption equipment, which they could not meet.{{sfn|Rejewski|1984|pp=242–43}} On 25 July 1939, the Polish Cipher Bureau handed [[Polish Enigma doubles|reconstructed Enigma machines]] and their techniques for decrypting ciphers to the French and British.{{sfn|Copeland|2004|pp=234, 235}} [[Gordon Welchman]] wrote,

{{quotation|Ultra would never have got off the ground if we had not learned from the Poles, in the nick of time, the details both of the German military Enigma machine, and of the operating procedures that were in use.|Gordon Welchman{{sfn|Welchman|1984|p=289}}}}

At Bletchley Park, some of the key people responsible for success against Enigma included mathematicians [[Alan Turing]] and [[Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander|Hugh Alexander]] and, at the [[British Tabulating Machine Company]], chief engineer [[Harold Keen]].&lt;ref name="haigh"/&gt;
After the war, interrogation of German cryptographic personnel, led to the conclusion that German cryptanalysts understood that cryptanalytic attacks against Enigma were possible but were thought to require impracticable amounts of effort and investment.{{sfn|Bamford|2001|p=17}} The Poles' early start at breaking Enigma and the continuity of their success, gave the Allies an advantage when World War II began.{{sfn|Welchman|1984|p=289}}

====Lorenz cipher====
{{main article|Cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher}}
In June 1941, the Germans started to introduce on-line [[stream cipher]] [[teleprinter]] systems for strategic point-to-point radio links, to which the British gave the code-name [[Fish (cryptography)|Fish]].{{sfn|Gannon|2006|p=103}} Several systems were used, principally the [[Lorenz cipher|Lorenz SZ 40/42]] (Tunny) and [[Geheimfernschreiber]] ([[Siemens and Halske T52|Sturgeon]]). These cipher systems were cryptanalysed, particularly Tunny, which the British thoroughly penetrated. It was eventually attacked using [[Colossus computer|Colossus]], which were the first digital programme-controlled electronic computers. In many respects the Tunny work was more difficult than for the Enigma, since the British codebreakers had no knowledge of the machine producing it nor the head-start that the Poles had given them against Enigma.&lt;ref name="haigh"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2017/1/211102-colossal-genius/fulltext | first=Thomas | last=Haigh | title=Colossal Genius: Tutte, Flowers, and a Bad Imitation of Turing | journal=[[Communications of the ACM]] | volume=60 | issue=1 | date=January 2017 | pages=29–35 | doi=10.1145/3018994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the volume of intelligence derived from this system was much smaller than that from Enigma, its importance was often far higher because it produced primarily high-level, strategic intelligence that was sent between Wehrmacht High Command (OKW). The eventual bulk decryption of Lorenz-enciphered messages contributed significantly and perhaps decisively, to the defeat of Nazi Germany.&lt;ref name="Hinsley 1993 8"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hinsley|1993|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brzezinski 2005 18"&gt;{{harv|Brzezinski|2005|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, the Tunny story has become much less well known among the public than the Enigma one.&lt;ref name="haigh"/&gt;  At Bletchley Park, some of the key people responsible for success in the Tunny effort included mathematicians [[W. T. Tutte|W. T. "Bill" Tutte]] and [[Max Newman]] and electrical engineer [[Tommy Flowers]].&lt;ref name="haigh"/&gt;

===Italian===
In June 1940, the Italians were using book codes for most of their military messages, except for the Italian Navy which, in early 1941 had started using a version of the Hagelin [[Rotor machine|rotor-based]] cipher machine [[M-209|C-38]].{{sfn|Hinsley|1993}} This was broken from June 1941 onwards by the Italian subsection of GC&amp;CS at [[Bletchley Park]].{{sfn|Wilkinson|1993|pp=61–67}}

===Japanese===
In the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] theatre, a Japanese cipher machine, called "[[Purple code|Purple]]" by the Americans, was used for highest-level Japanese diplomatic traffic. It produced a polyalphabetic substitution cipher, but unlike Enigma, was not a rotor machine, being built around electrical stepping switches. It was broken by the US Army [[Signal Intelligence Service]] and disseminated as ''[[Magic (cryptography)|Magic]]''. Detailed reports by the Japanese ambassador to Germany were encrypted on the Purple machine. His reports included reviews of German assessments of the military situation, reviews of strategy and intentions, reports on direct inspections by the ambassador (in one case, of Normandy beach defences), and reports of long interviews with Hitler.{{sfn|Hinsley|1993|p=}}

The chief fleet communications code system used by the Imperial Japanese Navy was called [[JN-25]] by the Americans and by early 1942, they had made considerable progress in decrypting Japanese naval messages. The Japanese are said to have obtained an Enigma machine in 1937, although it is debated whether they were given it by the Germans or bought a commercial version which apart from the plugboard and internal wirings, was the German ''Heer/Luftwaffe'' machine. The Japanese did not use it for their most secret communications, having developed a similar machine.

==Distribution==
[[File:Ultra Hut3 Graph.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Average number of daily Ultra dispatches to field commanders during the second World War{{sfn|Bennett|1999|p=302}}]]
Army- and air force-related intelligence derived from [[signals intelligence]] (SIGINT) sources—mainly Enigma decrypts in [[Hut 6]]—was compiled in summaries at GC&amp;CS ([[Bletchley Park]]) Hut 3 and distributed initially under the codeword "BONIFACE",{{sfn|West|1986|p=136}} implying that it was acquired from a well placed agent in Berlin. The volume of the intelligence reports going out to commanders in the field built up gradually. Naval Enigma decoded in [[Hut 8]] was forwarded from Hut 4 to the [[Admiralty]] Operational Intelligence Centre (OIC),{{sfn|Beesly|1977|p=36}} which were distributed initially under the codeword "HYDRO".{{sfn|West|1986|p=136}} The codeword "ULTRA" was adopted in June 1941.{{sfn|West|1986|p=162}} This codeword was reportedly suggested by Commander Geoffrey Colpoys, RN, who served in the RN OIC.

===Army and air force===
The distribution of Ultra information to Allied commanders and units in the field involved considerable risk of discovery by the Germans, and great care was taken to control both the information and knowledge of how it was obtained. Liaison officers were appointed for each field command to manage and control dissemination.

Dissemination of Ultra intelligence to field commanders was carried out by [[MI6]], which operated Special Liaison Units (SLU) attached to major army and air force commands. The activity was organized and supervised on behalf of MI6 by [[Group captain|Group Captain]] [[F. W. Winterbotham]]. Each SLU included intelligence, communications, and cryptographic elements. It was headed by a British Army or RAF officer, usually a major, known as "Special Liaison Officer". The main function of the liaison officer or his deputy was to pass Ultra intelligence bulletins to the commander of the command he was attached to, or to other indoctrinated staff officers. In order to safeguard Ultra, special precautions were taken. The standard procedure was for the liaison officer to present the intelligence summary to the recipient, stay with him while he studied it, then take it back and destroy it.

By the end of the war, there were about 40 SLUs serving commands around the world. {{sfn|Calvocoressi|2001|pp=78}} Fixed SLUs existed at the [[Admiralty]], the [[War Office]], the [[Air Ministry]], [[RAF Fighter Command]], the US Strategic Air Forces in Europe (Wycombe Abbey) and other fixed headquarters in the UK. An SLU was operating at the War HQ in Valletta, Malta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The fortifications of Malta 1530–1945| author=Stephenson, Charles| publisher = Osprey Publishing Ltd| location = Oxford, UK| year = 2004| isbn = 1-84176-693-3| page = 56| series = Fortress| volume = 16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These units had permanent teleprinter links to Bletchley Park.

Mobile SLUs were attached to field army and air force headquarters, and depended on radio communications to receive intelligence summaries. The first mobile SLUs appeared during the French campaign of 1940. A SLU supported the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) headed by [[John Vereker, 6th Viscount Gort|General Lord Gort]]. The first liaison officers were Robert Gore-Browne and Humphrey Plowden.{{sfn|West|1986|p=138}} A second SLU of the 1940 period was attached to the [[RAF Advanced Air Striking Force]] at [[Meaux]] commanded by Air Vice-Marshal [[Patrick Playfair|P H Lyon Playfair]]. This SLU was commanded by Squadron Leader F.W. "Tubby" Long.

===Intelligence agencies===
In 1940, special arrangements were made within the British intelligence services for handling BONIFACE and later Ultra intelligence. The [[MI5|Security Service]] started "Special Research Unit B1(b)" under [[H. L. A. Hart|Herbert Hart]]. In the [[MI6|SIS]] this intelligence was handled by "Section V" based at [[St Albans]].{{sfn|West|1986|p=152}}

===Radio and cryptography===
The communications system was founded by Brigadier Sir [[Richard Gambier-Parry]], who from 1938 to 1946 was head of MI6 Section VIII, based at Whaddon Hall in [[Buckinghamshire]], UK.{{sfn|Pidgeon|2003}} Ultra summaries from Bletchley Park were sent over landline to the Section VIII radio transmitter at Windy Ridge. From there they were transmitted to the destination SLUs.

The communications element of each SLU was called a "Special Communications Unit" or SCU. Radio transmitters were constructed at Whaddon Hall workshops, while receivers were the [[National HRO]], made in the USA. The SCUs were highly mobile and the first such units used civilian [[Packard]] cars. The following SCUs are listed:{{sfn|Pidgeon|2003}} SCU1 (Whaddon Hall), SCU2 (France before 1940, India), SCU3 (RSS Hanslope Park), SCU5, SCU6 (possibly Algiers and Italy), SCU7 (training unit in the UK), SCU8 (Europe after D-day), SCU9 (Europe after D-day), SCU11 (Palestine and India), SCU12 (India), SCU13 and SCU14.{{efn|In addition, there were SCU3 and SCU4, which supported ''Y Service'' radio intercepting and direction finding facilities. These units were formed from assets of the former [[MI8|Radio Security Service]], after it was reassigned to MI6 and they were not involved in Ultra dissemination.}}

The cryptographic element of each SLU was supplied by the RAF and was based on the [[Typex|TYPEX]] cryptographic machine and [[one-time pad]] systems.

RN Ultra messages from the OIC to ships at sea were necessarily transmitted over normal naval radio circuits and were protected by one-time pad encryption.{{sfn|Beesly|1977|p=142}}

===Lucy===
An intriguing question concerns the alleged use of Ultra information by the [[Lucy spy ring|"Lucy" spy ring]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-08-09/books/bk-198_1_german-operations | title=Operation "Citadel"--Kursk and Orel | author=Janusz Piekalkiewicz | date=9 August 1987 | publisher=Los Angeles Times| access-date=8 June 2016 | quote=translated by Michaela Nierhaus}}&lt;/ref&gt; headquartered in [[Switzerland]] and apparently operated by one man, [[Rudolf Roessler]]. This was an extremely well informed, responsive ring that was able to get information "directly from German General Staff Headquarters" – often on specific request. It has been alleged that "Lucy" was in major part a conduit for the British to feed Ultra intelligence to the Soviets in a way that made it appear to have come from highly placed espionage rather than from [[cryptanalysis]] of German radio traffic. The Soviets, however, through an agent at Bletchley, [[John Cairncross]], knew that Britain had broken Enigma. The "Lucy" ring was initially treated with suspicion by the Soviets. The information it provided was accurate and timely however, and Soviet agents in Switzerland (including their chief, [[Alexander Radó]]) eventually learned to take it seriously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The Enemy Within: A History of Spies, Spymasters and Espionage | author=Terry Crowdy | date=2011 | publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing | ISBN=9781780962436 | pages=307–309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of intelligence==
Most deciphered messages, often about relative trivia, were insufficient as intelligence reports for military strategists or field commanders. The organisation, interpretation and distribution of decrypted Enigma message traffic and other sources into usable intelligence was a subtle task.

At Bletchley Park, extensive indexes were kept of the information in the messages decrypted.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Bletchley Park Archives: Government Code &amp; Cypher School Card Indexes | url = http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/edu/archives/gccscoll.rhtm | accessdate = 8 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For each message the traffic analysis recorded the radio frequency, the date and time of intercept, and the preamble—which contained the network-identifying discriminant, the time of origin of the message, the callsign of the originating and receiving stations, and the [[Enigma machine#Indicator|indicator]] setting. This allowed cross referencing of a new message with a previous one.{{sfn|Welchman|1984|p=56}} The indexes included message preambles, every person, every ship, every unit, every weapon, every technical term and of repeated phrases such as forms of address and other German military jargon that might be usable as ''[[Known-plaintext attack|cribs]]''.{{sfn|Budiansky|2000|p=301}}

The first decryption of a wartime Enigma message was achieved by the Poles at [[PC Bruno]] on 17 January 1940, albeit one that had been transmitted three months earlier. Little had been achieved by the start of the [[Allied campaign in Norway]] in April. At the start of the [[Battle of France]] on 10 May 1940, the Germans made a very significant change in the indicator procedures for Enigma messages. However, the Bletchley Park cryptanalysts had anticipated this, and were able—jointly with PC Bruno—to resume breaking messages from 22 May, although often with some delay. The intelligence that these messages yielded was of little operational use in the fast-moving situation of the German advance.

Decryption of Enigma traffic built up gradually during 1940, with the first two prototype [[bombe]]s being delivered in March and August. The traffic was almost entirely limited to ''Luftwaffe'' messages. By the peak of the [[Battle of the Mediterranean]] in 1941, however, Bletchley Park was deciphering daily 2,000 Italian Hagelin messages. By the second half of 1941 30,000 Enigma messages a month were being deciphered, rising to 90,000 a month of Enigma and Fish decrypts combined later in the war.{{sfn|Hinsley|1993}}

Some of the contributions that Ultra intelligence made to the Allied successes are given below.

* In April 1940, Ultra information provided a detailed picture of the disposition of the German forces, and then their movement orders for the attack on the [[Low Countries]] prior to the [[Battle of France]] in May.{{sfn|Winterbotham|1974|pp=27–31}}
* An Ultra decrypt of June 1940 read ''KNICKEBEIN KLEVE IST AUF PUNKT 53 GRAD 24 MINUTEN NORD UND EIN GRAD WEST EINGERICHTET'' ("The Cleves ''Knickebein'' is directed at position 53 degrees 24 minutes north and 1 degree west"). This was the definitive piece of evidence that [[Reginald Victor Jones|Dr R V Jones]] of scientific intelligence in the Air Ministry needed to show that the Germans were developing a radio guidance system for their bombers.{{sfn|Jones|1978|p=92}} Ultra intelligence then continued to play a vital role in the so-called [[Battle of the Beams]].
* During the [[Battle of Britain]], Air Chief Marshal [[Hugh Dowding, 1st Baron Dowding|Sir Hugh Dowding]], Commander-in-Chief of [[RAF Fighter Command]], had a teleprinter link from Bletchley Park to his headquarters at [[RAF Bentley Priory]], for Ultra reports. Ultra intelligence kept him informed of German strategy,{{sfn|Calvocoressi|2001|p=90}} and of the strength and location of various ''Luftwaffe'' units, and often provided advance warning of bombing raids (but not of their specific targets).{{sfn|Lewin|2001|p=83}} These contributed to the British success. Dowding was bitterly and sometimes unfairly criticized by others who did not see Ultra, but he did not disclose his source.
* Decryption of traffic from ''Luftwaffe'' radio networks provided a great deal of indirect intelligence about the Germans' planned [[Operation Sea Lion]] to invade England in 1940.{{sfn|Jones|1978|p=124}}
* On 17 September 1940 an Ultra message reported that equipment at German airfields in Belgium for loading planes with paratroops and their gear, was to be dismantled. This was taken as a clear signal that Sea Lion had been cancelled.{{sfn|Winterbotham|1974|pp=56–58}}
* Ultra revealed that a major German air raid was planned for the night of 14 November 1940, and indicated three possible targets, including London and Coventry. However, the specific target was not determined until late on the afternoon of 14 November, by detection of the German radio guidance signals. Unfortunately, countermeasures failed to prevent the devastating [[Coventry Blitz]]. F. W. Winterbotham claimed that Churchill had advance warning, but intentionally did nothing about the raid, to safeguard Ultra.{{sfn|Winterbotham|1974|pp=60–61}} This claim has been comprehensively refuted by R V Jones,{{sfn|Jones|1978|pp=146–153}} Sir David Hunt,{{sfn|Hunt|1976}} Ralph Bennett{{sfn|Bennett|1999|p=64}} and Peter Calvocoressi.{{sfn|Calvocoressi|2001|p=94}} Ultra warned of a raid but did not reveal the target. Churchill, who had been ''en route'' to [[Ditchley|Ditchley Park]], was told that London might be bombed and returned to [[10 Downing Street]] so that he could observe the raid from the Air Ministry roof.
* Ultra intelligence considerably aided the British Army's [[Operation Compass]] victory over the much larger Italian army in [[Libya]] in December 1940 – February 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Seventy Years Ago This Month at Bletchley Park: December 1940 | publisher = Bletchley Park National Codes Centre | url = http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/content/archive/index/december1940.rhtm | accessdate = 16 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ultra intelligence greatly aided the Royal Navy's victory over the Italian navy in the [[Battle of Cape Matapan]] in March 1941.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry Hinsley|Hinsley]] in {{harvnb|Hinsley|Stripp|1993|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Although the Allies lost the [[Battle of Crete]] in May 1941, the Ultra intelligence that a parachute landing was planned meant that heavy losses were inflicted on the Germans and that fewer British troops were captured.{{sfn|Winterbotham|1974|pp=67–69, 187}}
* Ultra intelligence fully revealed the preparations for [[Operation Barbarossa]], the German invasion of the USSR. Although this information was passed to the Soviet government,  [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] refused to believe it.{{sfn|Lewin|2001|p=104}} The information did, however, help British planning, knowing that substantial German forces were to be deployed to the East.
* Ultra intelligence made a very significant contribution in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]]. Winston Churchill wrote "The only thing that ever really frightened me during the war was the U-boat peril."{{sfn|Churchill|2005|p=529}} The decryption of Enigma signals to the [[U-boat]]s was much more difficult than those of the ''Luftwaffe''. It was not until June 1941 that Bletchley Park was able to read a significant amount of this traffic currently.{{sfn|Budiansky|2000|p=341}} Transatlantic convoys were then diverted away from the U-boat [[Wolfpack (naval tactic)|"wolfpacks"]], and U-boat supply vessels sunk. On 1 February 1942, Enigma U-boat traffic became unreadable because of the introduction of a different [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma#German Navy 4-rotor Enigma|4-rotor Enigma machine]]. This situation persisted until December 1942, although other German naval Enigma messages were still being deciphered, such as those of the U-boat training command at Kiel.{{sfn|Lewin|2001|p=210}} From December 1942 to the end of the war, Ultra allowed Allied convoys to evade U-boat patrol lines, and guided Allied anti-submarine forces to the location of U-boats at sea.
* In the [[Western Desert Campaign]], Ultra intelligence helped [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Wavell]] and [[Claude Auchinleck|Auchinleck]] to prevent [[Erwin Rommel|Rommel's]] forces from reaching Cairo in the autumn of 1941.{{sfn|Winterbotham|1974|p=187}}
* Ultra intelligence from Hagelin decrypts, and from ''Luftwaffe'' and German naval Enigma decrypts, helped sink about half of the ships supplying the Axis forces in North Africa.{{sfn|Hinsley|1993}}
* Ultra intelligence from ''Abwehr'' transmissions confirmed that Britain's Security Service ([[MI5]]) had captured all of the German agents in Britain, and that the ''Abwehr'' still believed in the many [[double agents]] which MI5 controlled under the [[Double Cross System]].{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=129}} This enabled major deception operations.{{sfn|Budiansky|2000|pp=315–316}}
* Deciphered JN-25 messages allowed the U.S. to turn back a Japanese offensive in the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]] in April 1942 and set up the decisive American victory at the [[Battle of Midway]] in June 1942.{{sfn|Lewin|2001|p=237}}
* Ultra contributed very significantly to the monitoring of German developments at [[Peenemünde]] and the collection of [[V-1 and V-2 Intelligence]] from 1942 onwards.{{sfn|Jones|1978|p=336}}
* Ultra contributed to [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Montgomery's]] victory at the [[Battle of Alam el Halfa]] by providing warning of Rommel's planned attack.
* Ultra also contributed to the success of Montgomery's offensive in the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]], by providing him (before the battle) with a complete picture of Axis forces, and (during the battle) with Rommel's own action reports to Germany.
* Ultra provided evidence that the Allied landings in French North Africa ([[Operation Torch]]) were not anticipated.{{sfn|Winterbotham|1974|pp=187–188}}
* A JN-25 decrypt of 14 April 1943 provided details of Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto|Yamamoto's]] forthcoming visit to [[Balalae Island]], and on 18 April, a year to the day following the [[Doolittle Raid]], [[Operation Vengeance|his aircraft was shot down]], killing this man who was regarded as irreplaceable.{{sfn|Budiansky|2000|p=319}}
* The part played by Ultra intelligence in the preparation for the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] was of unprecedented importance. It provided information as to where the enemy's forces were strongest and that the elaborate strategic deceptions had convinced Hitler and the German high command.{{sfn|Lewin|2001|p=278}}
* The success of the [[Battle of North Cape]], in which [[HMS Duke of York (17)|HMS ''Duke of York'']] sank the German battleship [[German battleship Scharnhorst|''Scharnhorst'']], was entirely built on prompt deciphering of German naval signals.{{sfn|Lewin|2001|pp=227–230}} &lt;!--December 1943--&gt;
* US Army Lieutenant Arthur J Levenson who worked on both Enigma and Tunny at Bletchley Park, said in a 1980 interview of intelligence from Tunny {{Quote|Rommel was appointed Inspector General of the West, and he inspected all the defences along the Normandy beaches and send a very detailed message that I think was 70,000 characters and we decrypted it as a small pamphlet. It was a report of the whole Western defences. How wide the V shaped trenches were to stop tanks, and how much barbed wire. Oh, it was everything and we decrypted it before D-Day.{{sfn|Farley|1980|p=39}} }}
* Both Enigma and Tunny decrypts showed Germany had been taken in by [[Operation Bodyguard]], the deception operation to protect [[Operation Overlord]]. They revealed the Germans did not anticipate the [[Normandy landings]] and even after D-Day still believed  Normandy was only a feint, with the main invasion to be in the Pas de Calais.{{sfn|Lewin|2001|p=292}}{{sfn|Budiansky|2000|p=315}}
* Information that there was German ''[[Panzergrenadier]]'' division in the planned dropping zone for the US [[101st Airborne Division]] in [[Operation Overlord]] led to a change of location.{{sfn|Farley|1980|p=40}}
* It assisted greatly in [[Operation Cobra]].
* It warned of the major German counterattack at Mortain, and allowed the Allies to surround the forces at [[Falaise pocket|Falaise]].&lt;!--"destroy" is a bit strong, &amp; operational &amp; command failures played a part more important than Ultra--&gt;
* During the Allied advance to Germany, Ultra often provided detailed tactical information, and showed how Hitler ignored the advice of his generals and insisted on German troops fighting in place "to the last man".{{sfn|Winterbotham|1974|p=180}}
* [[Bomber Harris|Arthur "Bomber" Harris]], officer commanding [[RAF Bomber Command]], was not cleared for Ultra. After D-Day, with the resumption of the strategic bomber campaign over Germany, Harris remained wedded to area bombardment. Historian [[Frederick Taylor (historian)|Frederick Taylor]] argues that, as Harris was not cleared for access to Ultra, he was given some information gleaned from Enigma but not the information's source. This affected his attitude about post-D-Day directives to target oil installations, since he did not know that senior Allied commanders were using high-level German sources to assess just how much this was hurting the German war effort; thus Harris tended to see the directives to bomb specific oil and munitions targets as a "panacea" (his word) and a distraction from the real task of making the rubble bounce.{{sfn|Taylor|2005|p=202}}

==Safeguarding of sources==
The Allies were seriously concerned with the prospect of the Axis command finding out that they had broken into the Enigma traffic. The British were more disciplined about such measures than the Americans, and this difference was a source of friction between them.{{sfn|Winterbotham|1974|pp=86–91}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Bletchley park archives: October 1943 : Not all our own way | url = http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/content/archive/oct1943.rhtm | accessdate = 9 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was a little bit of a joke that in [[Delhi]], the British Ultra unit was based in a large wooden hut in the grounds of Government House. Security consisted of a wooden table flat across the door with a bell on it and a sergeant sitting there. This hut was ignored by all. The American unit was in a large brick building, surrounded by barbed wire and armed patrols. People may not have known what was in there, but they surely knew it was something important and secret.

To disguise the source of the intelligence for the Allied attacks on Axis supply ships bound for North Africa, "spotter" submarines and aircraft were sent to search for Axis ships. These searchers or their radio transmissions were observed by the Axis forces, who concluded their ships were being found by conventional reconnaissance. They suspected that there were some 400 Allied submarines in the Mediterranean and a huge fleet of reconnaissance aircraft on [[Malta]]. In fact, there were only 25 submarines and at times as few as three aircraft.{{sfn|Hinsley|1993}}

This procedure also helped conceal the intelligence source from Allied personnel, who might give away the secret by careless talk, or under interrogation if captured. Along with the search mission that would find the Axis ships, two or three additional search missions would be sent out to other areas, so that crews would not begin to wonder why a single mission found the Axis ships every time.

Other deceptive means were used. On one occasion, a convoy of five ships sailed from [[Naples]] to North Africa with essential supplies at a critical moment in the North African fighting. There was no time to have the ships properly spotted beforehand. The decision to attack solely on Ultra intelligence went directly to Churchill. The ships were all sunk by an attack "out of the blue", arousing German suspicions of a security breach. To distract the Germans from the idea of a signals breach (such as Ultra), the Allies sent a radio message to a fictitious spy in Naples, congratulating him for this success. According to some sources the Germans decrypted this message and believed it.{{sfn|Momsen|2007}}

In the Battle of the Atlantic,  the precautions were taken to the extreme. In most cases where the Allies knew from intercepts the location of a U-boat in mid-Atlantic, the U-boat was not attacked immediately, until a "cover story" could be arranged. For example, a search plane might be "fortunate enough" to sight the U-boat, thus explaining the Allied attack.

Some Germans had suspicions that all was not right with Enigma. Admiral [[Karl Dönitz]] received reports of "impossible" encounters between U-boats and enemy vessels which made him suspect some compromise of his communications. In one instance, three U-boats met at a tiny island in the [[Caribbean Sea]], and a British destroyer promptly showed up. The U-boats escaped and reported what had happened. Dönitz immediately asked for a review of Enigma's security. The analysis suggested that the signals problem, if there was one, was not due to the Enigma itself. Dönitz had the settings book changed anyway, blacking out Bletchley Park for a period. However, the evidence was never enough to truly convince him that Naval Enigma was being read by the Allies. The more so, since ''[[B-Dienst]]'', his own codebreaking group, had partially broken Royal Navy traffic (including its convoy codes early in the war),{{sfn|Mallmann-Showell|2003}} and supplied enough information to support the idea that the Allies were unable to read Naval Enigma.{{efn|Coincidentally, German success in this respect almost exactly matched in time an Allied blackout from Naval Enigma.}}

By 1945, most German Enigma traffic could be decrypted within a day or two, yet the Germans remained confident of its security.{{sfn|Ferris|2005|p=165}} Had they known better, they could have changed systems, forcing Allied cryptanalysts to start again.

==Effect on the war==
The exact influence of Ultra on the course of the war is debated; an oft-repeated assessment is that decryption of German ciphers advanced the [[Victory in Europe Day|end of the European war]] by two years.{{sfn|Kahn|1997|p=}}&lt;ref name="engima_cryptographic_mathematics"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nsa.gov/about/_files/cryptologic_heritage/publications/wwii/engima_cryptographic_mathematics.pdf|title=The Cryptographic Mathematics of Enigma|last=Miller|first=A.

{{quotation|Would the Soviets meanwhile have defeated Germany, or Germany the Soviets, or would there have been stalemate on the eastern fronts? What would have been decided about the atom bomb? Not even counter-factual historians can answer such questions. They are questions which do not arise, because the war went as it did. But those historians who are concerned only with the war as it was must ask why it went as it did. And they need venture only a reasonable distance beyond the facts to recognise the extent to which the explanation lies in the influence of Ultra.|Hinsley&lt;ref name="hinsley-intro"&gt;{{citation |last=Hinsley |first=F.

Winterbotham's quoting of Eisenhower's "decisive" verdict is part of a letter sent by Eisenhower to Menzies after the conclusion of the European war and later found among his papers at the Eisenhower Presidential Library.{{sfn|Winterbotham|1974|p=2}} It allows a contemporary, documentary view of a leader on Ultra's importance:

{{quotation|July 1945

Dear General Menzies:

I had hoped to be able to pay a visit to Bletchley Park in order to thank you, Sir Edward Travis, and the members of the staff personally for the magnificent service which has been rendered to the Allied cause.

I am very well aware of the immense amount of work and effort which has been involved in the production of the material with which you supplied us. I fully realize also the numerous setbacks and difficulties with which you have had to contend and how you have always, by your supreme efforts, overcome them.

The intelligence which has emanated from you before and during this campaign has been priceless value to me. It has simplified my task as a commander enormously. It has saved thousands of British and American lives and, in no small way, contributed to the speed with which the enemy was routed and eventually forced to surrender.

I should be very grateful, therefore, if you would express to each and every one of those engaged in this work from me personally my heartfelt admiration and sincere thanks for their very decisive contribution to the Allied war effort.

Sincerely,

Dwight D. Eisenhower}}

There is wide disagreement about the importance of codebreaking in winning the crucial [[Battle of the Atlantic]]. To cite just one example, the historian Max Hastings states that "In 1941 alone, ultra saved between 1.5 and two million tons of Allied ships from destruction." This would represent a 40 percent to 53 percent reduction, though it is not clear how this extrapolation was made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hastings|first1=Max|title=All Hell Let Loose: The World at War, 1939–45 |date=2011 |publisher=HarperPress |location=London|pages=275–276}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another view is from a history based on the German naval archives written after the war for the British Admiralty by a former U-boat commander and son-in-law of his commander, Grand Admiral [[Karl Dönitz]]. His book reports that several times during the war they undertook detailed investigations to see whether their operations were being compromised by broken enigma code. These investigations were spurred because the Germans had broken the British naval code, and found the information useful. Their investigations were negative and the conclusion is that their defeat "... was due firstly to outstanding developments in enemy radar ... ."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hessler|first1=Günther|title=The U-Boat war in the Atlantic, 1939–1945|date=1989|publisher=Her Majesty's Stationery Office|location=London}}'''2''', p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The great advance was [[centimetric radar]], developed in a joint British-American venture, which became operational in the spring of 1943. Earlier radar was unable to distinguish U-boat conning towers from the surface of the sea, so they could not even locate U-boats attacking convoys on the surface on moonless nights; so the surfaced U-boats were almost invisible while having the additional advantage of being swifter than their prey. The new higher frequency radar could spot conning towers and periscopes could even be detected from airplanes. Some idea of the relative impact of codebreaking and radar improvement can be obtained from [[Battle of the Atlantic|graphs]] showing the tonnage of merchantmen sunk and number of U-boats sunk in each month of the battle. Of course the graphs cannot be interpreted unambiguously, because we are unable to factor in many variables like improvements in code breaking and the numerous other advances in equipment to combat U-boats. Nonetheless the data seems to favor the German view—that radar was crucial.

While Ultra certainly affected the course of the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]] during the war, two factors often argued against Ultra shortening the overall war by a measure of years are the relatively small role it played in the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front conflict between the Germans and the Soviet Union]] and the completely independent development of the U.S.-led [[Manhattan Project]] to create the [[atomic bomb]].  Author [[Jeffrey T. Richelson]] mentions Hinsley's estimate of at least two years, and concludes that "It might be more accurate to say that Ultra helped shorten the war by three months – the interval between the actual end of the war in Europe and the time the United States would have been able to drop an atomic bomb on Hamburg or Berlin – and might have shortened the war by as much as two years had the U.S. atomic bomb program been unsuccessful."&lt;ref name="richelson"/&gt;  Military historian [[Guy Hartcup]] analyzes aspects of the question but then simply says, "It is impossible to calculate in terms of months or years how much Ultra shortened the war."&lt;ref name="hartcup"&gt;{{cite book | first=Guy | last=Hartcup | authorlink=Guy Hartcup | title=The Effect of Science on the Second World War | publisher=Macmillan Press | location=Basingstoke, Hampshire | date=2000 | pages=96–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postwar disclosures==
While it is obvious why Britain and the U.S. went to considerable pains to keep Ultra a secret until the end of the war, it has been a matter of some conjecture why Ultra was kept officially secret for 29 years thereafter, until 1974. During that period the important contributions to the war effort of a great many people remained unknown, and they were unable to share in the glory of what is likely one of the chief reasons the Allies won the war – or, at least, as quickly as they did.

At least three versions exist as to why Ultra was kept secret so long. Each has plausibility, and all may be true. First, as [[David Kahn (writer)|David Kahn]] pointed out in his 1974 ''New York Times'' review of Winterbotham's ''The Ultra Secret'', after the war, surplus Enigmas and Enigma-like machines were sold to [[Third World]] countries, which remained convinced of the security of the remarkable cipher machines. Their traffic was not as secure as they believed, however, which is one reason the British made the machines available.{{sfn|Kahn|1974|p=5}}{{better source|reason=can't tell from source if this is Kahn's conjecture or if he has facts|date=April 2016}}

By the 1970s newer computer-based ciphers were becoming popular as the world increasingly turned to computerised communications, and the usefulness of Enigma copies (and rotor machines generally) rapidly decreased. Switzerland developed its own version of Enigma, known as [[NEMA (machine)|NEMA]], and used it into the late 1970s, while the United States [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) retired the last of its rotor-based encryption systems, the [[KL-7]] series, in the 1980s.

A second explanation relates to a misadventure of Churchill's between the World Wars, when he publicly disclosed information from decrypted Soviet communications. This had prompted the Soviets to change their ciphers, leading to a blackout.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

The third explanation is given by Winterbotham, who recounts that two weeks after [[V-E Day]], on 25 May 1945, Churchill requested former recipients of Ultra intelligence not to divulge the source or the information that they had received from it, in order that there be neither damage to the future operations of the Secret Service nor any cause for the Axis to blame Ultra for their defeat.{{Sfn |Winterbotham|1974| p =1}}

Since it was British and, later, American message-breaking which had been the most extensive, the importance of Enigma decrypts to the prosecution of the war remained unknown despite revelations by the Poles and the French of their early work on breaking the Enigma cipher. This work, which was carried out in the 1930s and continued into the early part of the war, was necessarily uninformed regarding further breakthroughs achieved by the Allies during the balance of the war. In 1967, Polish military historian [[Władysław Kozaczuk]] in his book ''Bitwa o tajemnice'' ("Battle for Secrets") first revealed Enigma had been broken by Polish cryptologists before World War II. Later the 1973 public disclosure of Enigma decryption in the book ''Enigma'' by French intelligence officer [[Gustave Bertrand]] generated pressure to discuss the rest of the Enigma–Ultra story.{{sfn|Bertrand|1973}}

In 1967 David Kahn in ''[[The Codebreakers]]'' described the 1944 capture of a Naval Enigma machine from {{GS|U-505||2}} and gave the first published hint about the scale, mechanisation and operational importance of the Anglo-American Enigma-breaking operation:

{{quotation|The Allies now read U-boat operational traffic. For they had, more than a year before the theft, succeeded in solving the difficult U-boat systems, and – in one of the finest cryptanalytic achievements of the war – managed to read the intercepts on a current basis. For this, the cryptanalysts needed the help of a mass of machinery that filled two buildings.{{sfn|Kahn|1967|p=506}}}}

[[Ladislas Farago]]'s 1971 best-seller ''The Game of the Foxes'' gave an early garbled version of the myth of the purloined Enigma. According to Farago, it was thanks to a "Polish-Swedish ring the British obtained a working model of the 'Enigma' machine, which the Germans used to encipher their top-secret messages."{{sfn|Farago|1974|p=664}} "It was to pick up one of these machines that Commander Denniston went clandestinely to a secluded Polish castle [!] on the eve of the war. Dilly Knox later solved its keying, exposing all Abwehr signals encoded by this system."{{sfn|Farago|1974|p=674}} "In 1941 [t]he brilliant cryptologist Dillwyn Knox, working at the Government Code &amp; Cypher School at the Bletchley centre of British code-cracking, solved the keying of the Abwehr's Enigma machine."{{sfn|Farago|1974|p=359}}

The British ban was finally lifted in 1974, the year that a key participant on the distribution side of the Ultra project, F. W. Winterbotham, published ''The Ultra Secret''. A succession of books by former participants and others followed. The official history of British intelligence in World War II was published in five volumes from 1979 to 1988, and included further details from official sources concerning the availability and employment of Ultra intelligence. It was chiefly edited by Harry Hinsley, with one volume by Michael Howard. There is also a one-volume collection of reminiscences by Ultra veterans, ''Codebreakers'' (1993), edited by Hinsley and Alan Stripp.

A 2012 London [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]] exhibit, "Code Breaker:  Alan Turing's Life and Legacy",&lt;ref&gt;A 16-page pamphlet of that title, summarizing Turing's life and work, is available free at the [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]].&lt;/ref&gt; marking the [[centenary]] of his birth, includes a short film of statements by half a dozen participants and historians of the World War II [[Bletchley Park]] Ultra operations. John Agar, a historian of science and technology, states that by war's end 8,995 people worked at Bletchley Park. Iain Standen, Chief Executive of the Bletchley Park Trust, says of the work done there:  "It was crucial to the survival of Britain, and indeed of the West."  The Departmental Historian at [[GCHQ]] (the Government Communications Headquarters), who identifies himself only as "Tony" but seems to speak authoritatively, says that Ultra was a "major [[force multiplier]]. It was the first time that quantities of real-time intelligence became available to the British military."  He further states that it is only in 2012 that Alan Turing's last two papers on Enigma decryption have been released to Britain's [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|National Archives]]; the seven decades' delay had been due to their "continuing sensitivity... It wouldn't have been safe to release [them earlier]."

==Holocaust intelligence==
Historians and [[Holocaust studies|holocaust researchers]] have tried to establish when the Allies recognized the full extent of Nazi-era extermination of Jews, and specifically, the extermination-camp system. In 1999, the U.S. Government passed the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act ([[Act of Congress|P.L.]] 105-246), making it policy to declassify all Nazi war crime documents in their files; this was later amended to include the Japanese Imperial Government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/cpquery/?&amp;dbname=cp106&amp;sid=cp106uUzJ1&amp;refer=&amp;r_n=hr969.106&amp;item=&amp;&amp;&amp;sel=TOC_161095&amp; Nazi War Crimes and Japanese Imperial Government Disclosure Act of 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, more than 600 decrypts and translations of intercepted messages were disclosed; [[National Security Administration|NSA]] historian Robert Hanyok would conclude that Allied communications intelligence, "by itself, could not have provided an early warning to Allied leaders regarding the nature and scope of the Holocaust."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hanyok|2004|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following [[Operation Barbarossa]], decrypts in August 1941 alerted British authorities to the many massacres in occupied zones of the [[Soviet Union]], including those of Jews, but specifics were not made public for security reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishgen.org/yizkor/poland/pol001.html|title=Poland and her Jews 1941 - 1944|author=|date=|website=www.jewishgen.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Revelations about the concentration camps were gleaned from other sources, and were publicly reported by the [[Polish government-in-exile]], [[Jan Karski]] and the [[World Jewish Congress|WJC]] offices in Switzerland a year or more later.&lt;ref&gt;See: [[Riegner Telegram]]&lt;/ref&gt; A decrypted message referring to "[[Einsatz Reinhard]]" (the [[Höfle Telegram]]), from January 11, 1943, may have outlined the system and listed the number of Jews and others gassed at four death camps the previous year, but codebreakers did not understand the meaning of the message.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hanyok|2004|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; In summer 1944, [[Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.|Arthur Schlesinger]], an [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] analyst, interpreted the intelligence as an "incremental increase in persecution rather than... extermination."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schlesinger|1992|pp=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postwar consequences==
There has been controversy about the influence of Allied Enigma decryption on the course of World War II. It has also been suggested that the question should be broadened to include Ultra's influence not only on the war itself, but also on the post-war period.

[[F. W. Winterbotham]], the first author to outline the influence of Enigma decryption on the course of World War II, likewise made the earliest contribution to an appreciation of Ultra's ''postwar'' influence, which now continues into the 21st century—and not only in the postwar establishment of Britain's [[GCHQ]] (Government Communication Headquarters) and America's NSA. "Let no one be fooled," Winterbotham admonishes in chapter 3, "by the spate of television films and propaganda which has made the war seem like some great triumphant epic. It was, in fact, a very narrow shave, and the reader may like to ponder [...] whether [...] we might have won [without] Ultra."{{sfn|Winterbotham|1974|p=25}}

Debate continues on whether, had postwar political and military leaders been aware of Ultra's role in Allied victory in World War II, these leaders might have been less optimistic about post-World War II military involvements.{{efn|[[Christopher Kasparek]] writes: "Had the... postwar governments of major powers realized ... how Allied victory in World War II had hung by a slender thread first spun by three mathematicians [Rejewski, Różycki, Zygalski] working on Enigma decryption for the general staff of a seemingly negligible power [Poland], they might have been more cautious in picking their own wars." (Review of [[Michael Alfred Peszke]], ''The Polish Underground Army, the Western Allies, and the Failure of Strategic Unity in World War II'', 2005, in ''[[The Polish Review]]'', vol. L, no. 2, 2005, p. 241). A kindred point concerning postwar American [[triumphalism]] is made by British historian [[Max Hastings]], author of ''[[All Hell Let Loose|Inferno: The World at War, 1939–1945]]'', in a [[C-SPAN2]] "After WORDS" interview with [[Toby Harnden]], U.S. editor of London's ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', broadcast 4 December 2011.}}

[[Phillip Knightley|Knightley]] suggests that Ultra may have contributed to the development of the [[Cold War]].{{sfn|Knightley|1986|pp=173–175}} The Soviets received disguised Ultra information, but the existence of Ultra itself was not disclosed by the western Allies. The Soviets, who had clues to Ultra's existence, possibly through [[Kim Philby]] and [[Anthony Blunt]],{{sfn|Knightley|1986|pp=173–175}} may thus have felt still more distrustful of their wartime partners.

The mystery surrounding the discovery of the sunk {{GS|U-869}} off the coast of [[New Jersey]] by divers [[Richie Kohler]] and [[John Chatterton]] was unraveled in part through the analysis of Ultra intercepts, which demonstrated that, although ''U-869'' had been ordered by U-boat Command to change course and proceed to North Africa, near Rabat, the submarine had missed the messages changing her assignment and had continued to the eastern coast of the U.S., her original destination.

'''Wilhelm Martin''' (20 June 1876 - 10 March 1954) was a [[Germany|German]]-[[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Art history|art historian]].&lt;ref name=BWN&gt;R.E.O. Ekkart, 'Martin, Wilhelm (1876-1954)', in Biografisch Woordenboek van Nederland.[http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/bwn1880-2000/lemmata/bwn2/martin] 12 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilhelm Martin was born in 1876 in [[Quakenbrück]], Germany as the son of [[Karl Martin]], a geologist, and Ana Fittica. When his father became a professor at the [[University of Leiden]] in 1877, the family moved to the Netherlands. Wilhelm's two yonger brothers, Herman Martin (1881-1968, director of the [[Fries Museum]]) and Hans Martin (1886-1964, a writer) were both born in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=BWN/&gt;

Wilhelm Martin successfully studied Arts at the University of Leiden between 1894 and 1899, and became a [[Ph.D.]] in 1901 with his study ''Het leven en de werken van [[Gerrit Dou]] beschouwd in verband met het schildersleven van zijn tijd'', the first purely art historical [[doctorate]] in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=BWN/&gt;

Also in 1901, Martin became vice-director of the [[Mauritshuis]] museum in The Hague under [[Abraham Bredius]]. Martin specialized in [[Dutch Golden Age painting]], i.e. 17th-century Dutch painting. In 1904 he started giving private lessons at the University of Leiden.&lt;ref name=BWN/&gt;

[[File:AcademiegebouwLeiden7.JPG|thumb|Stained glass window in honour of Wilhelm Martin (Academy Building Leiden)]]
On 9 August 1906, he married Maria Cornelia Visser. They had three daughters and one son. In 1907, Martin became [[Academic ranks in the Netherlands#Professorship|extraordinary professor]] of art history at the University of Leiden. In 1909, Martin succeeded Bredius as the director of the Mauritshuis, which he remained for 36 years. He published a second book on Gerrit Dou in 1912, together with E. W. Moes two parts of ''Oude Schilderkunst in Nederland'' (Ancient painting in the Netherlands) in 1912 and 1914, and scientific catalogues of the Mauritshuis collection in 1914 and 1915.&lt;ref name=BWN/&gt;

In 1918, Martin published ''Alt-holländische Bilder'' (Old Netherlandic Images), with a revised reprint in 1921. It was aimed at collectors and contained advice on conservation and restoration. Meanwhile, he also published some sorks on 19th-century Dutch painters, including the 1915 ''[[Albert Neuhuys]], zijn leven en zijn kunst'', in 1917 together with [[G. H. Marius]] ''[[Johannes Bosboom]], 1817-1891'', and in 1921 ''[[Thérèse van Duyl-Schwartze]]. 1851-1918. Gedenkboek''.&lt;ref name=BWN/&gt;

He wrote studies on [[Jan Steen]] in 1924, 1926 and 1954. His major work, ''De Hollandsche schilderkunst in de zeventiende eeuw'' (Dutch painting in the seventeenth century), appeared in two parts in 1935-1936.&lt;ref name=BWN/&gt;

In 1934, he also became the director of the [[Museum Mesdag]], which he remained until his death in 1954. In 1935, he became director of the Prentenkabinet (Print cabinet) of the University of Leiden. In 1942, during the German occupation of the Netherlands, he gave his resignation from the University: it was accepted in 1943, although he stayed as director of the Prentenkabinet. He retired as director of the Mauritshuis in 1945, only to return for one year in 1946-1947 when his successor suddenly left. He published a few more works, including a 1947 work on ''[[The Night Watch]]'' and a 1950 picture book on Dutch painting of the second half of the seventeenth century.&lt;ref name=BWN/&gt;

In between his career as an academic, director and writer of art historical books, he contributed to the organisation of exhibitions, was a member of different committess on Dutch Museums and Dutch Heritage, and wrote articles for many magazines, including [[The Burlington Magazine]] and [[Elsevier (magazine)|Elsevier]].&lt;ref name=BWN/&gt;
