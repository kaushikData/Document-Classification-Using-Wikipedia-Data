      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9208">The '''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'apologetic''''&lt;ref name="Graham W. 1977 p.11"&gt;Graham W. (1977) The Scots Word Book,  The Ramsay Head Press, Edinburgh, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; or '''parochial apostrophe'''&lt;ref&gt;Purves D. (1997) A Scots Grammar, The Saltire Society, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; is the distinctive use of [[apostrophe]]s in [[Modern Scots]] [[orthography]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scots-online.org/airticles/AwAeWey.pdf Eagle A. (2008) Aw Ae Wey—Written Scots in Scotland and Ulster]&lt;/ref&gt; Apologetic apostrophes generally occurred where a [[consonant]] exists in the [[Standard English]] [[cognate]], as in ''{{wiktsco|a'}}'' (all), ''{{wiktsco|gi'e}}'' (give) and ''{{wiktsco|wi'}}'' (with).

The practice, unknown in [[Older Scots]], was introduced in the 18th century&lt;ref&gt;Rennie, S. (2001) "The Electronic Scottish National Dictionary (eSND): Work in Progress", Literary and Linguistic Computing 2001 16(2), Oxford University Press, pp. 159&lt;/ref&gt; by writers such as [[Allan Ramsay (poet)|Allan Ramsay]],&lt;ref&gt;Murison d. (1977) The Guid Scots Tongue, Blackwell, Edinburgh, p.31&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Fergusson]] and [[Robert Burns]] as part of a process of [[Anglicisation]]. The 18th-century practice was also adopted by later writers such as [[Walter Scott]], [[John Galt (novelist)|John Galt]] and [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]. It produced an easily understood spurious Scots that was very popular with English readers and on the English stage. It was also sometimes forced on reluctant authors by publishers desirous of a wider circulation for their books.&lt;ref&gt;Scottish National Dictionary, Introduction §18.1 p. xiv Vol. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The custom "also had the unfortunate effect of suggesting that Broad Scots was not a separate language system, but rather a divergent or inferior form of [[English language|English]]".&lt;ref&gt;Corbett, John; McClure, Derrick; Stuart-Smith, Jane (Editors)(2003) The Edinburgh Companion to Scots. Edinburgh, Edinburgh University Press. pp. 12-13&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the apologetic apostrophe became less widespread&lt;ref name="Graham W. 1977 p.11"/&gt; after the appearance of the 'Style Sheet'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electricscotland.com/poetry/purves/Grammer_Style.pdf The Scots Style Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1947 and is now considered unacceptable,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130128131306/http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/freefun/didyouknow/placenames/scotsintro.html Taylor S. (2009) Ordnance Survey: Introduction to Scots origins of place names in Britain]&lt;/ref&gt; the apostrophe-less forms such as ''{{wiktsco|aw}}'' (all), ''{{wiktsco|gie}}'' (give) and ''{{wiktsco|wi}}'' (with) being preferable.

== L-vocalisation ==
{{main|L-vocalization}}
[[Early Scots]] had undergone a process of [[L-vocalisation]] where /l/ was preceded by the [[vowel]]s {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/u̞/}} in closed [[syllable]]s, which was completed by the end of the 14th century.&lt;ref name="A History of Scots to 1700, p.xc"&gt;A History of Scots to 1700,  p.xc&lt;/ref&gt; The cluster {{IPA|/al/}} vocalised to {{IPA|/aː/}} and  {{IPA|/u̞l/}} to {{IPA|/uː/}} hence spellings such as ''a{{'}}'' (all), ''ba{{'}}'' (ball), ''ca{{'}}'' (call), ''sa't'' (salt) and ''ha'd'' (hold),&lt;ref&gt;Scottish National Dictionary, p.xxi, Entry: A&lt;/ref&gt; and ''fu{{'}}'' and ''pu{{'}}'' with the [[Doublet (linguistics)|doublets]] ''full'' {{IPA|[fʌl]}} and ''pull'' {{IPA|[pʌl]}}.&lt;ref&gt;Scottish National Dictionary, p.xxiii-xxiv&lt;/ref&gt; The standard&lt;ref&gt;Scottish National Dictionary, Entry: U, Entry: W&lt;/ref&gt; literary apostrophe-less spellings for {{IPA|/aː/}} (also {{IPA|/ɑː, ɔː/}}) were {{angle bracket|au}} and {{angle bracket|aw}}&lt;ref&gt;Scottish National Dictionary, Entry: A&lt;/ref&gt; with {{angle bracket|au}} generally occurring word initially or medially, and {{angle bracket|aw}} occurring word final.&lt;ref&gt;Scottish National Dictionary, p. xix&lt;/ref&gt; Thus ''aw'' (all), ''baw'' (ball), ''caw'' (call), ''saut'' (salt) and ''haud'' (hold). The standard literary spelling of {{IPA|/uː/}} was {{angle bracket|ou}}, generally preferred in the ''Scottish National Dictionary'',&lt;ref&gt;Scottish National Dictionary, p. xiv, Entry: O&lt;/ref&gt; although the use of {{angle bracket|oo}}, borrowed from Standard English, became popular by the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Scottish National Dictionary, Entry: O&lt;/ref&gt; Thus ''fou'' and ''pou'', but the form ''fu'' functioning as the cognate of the suffix 'ful'. L also vocalised after {{IPA|/o̞/}} in closed syllables&lt;ref name="A History of Scots to 1700, p.xc"/&gt; resulting in a [[diphthong]] which became {{IPA|/ʌu/}} in Modern Scots, for example ''knowe'' (knoll), ''fowk'' (folk), ''gowf'' (golf) and ''gowd'' (gold).&lt;ref&gt;Scottish National Dictionary, p.xxi, xxiii-xxiv&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inflectional endings ==
The consonant clusters in the [[inflection]]al endings {{angle bracket|ing}} and {{angle bracket|and}}, cognate with Standard English {{angle bracket|ing}}, changed to {{IPA|/n/}} in Early Scots,&lt;ref name="A History of Scots to 1700, p.ci"&gt;A History of Scots to 1700,  p.ci&lt;/ref&gt; the modern realisations generally being {{IPA|/ɪn/}} and {{IPA|/ən/}}&lt;ref&gt;Scottish National Dictionary, Entry: -IN(G)&lt;/ref&gt; hence the spelling ''in{{'}}''.

== Consonant clusters ==
The [[Consonant cluster|cluster]] {{angle bracket|mb}} had been [[Cluster reduction|reduced]] to {{IPA|/m/}} in Early Scots&lt;ref name="A History of Scots to 1700, p.ci"/&gt; hence spelling such as ''num'er'' (number), ''cham'er'' (chamber) and ''tim'er'' (timber), the standard literary apostrophe-less spellings being ''nummer'', ''chaumer'' and ''timmer''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Scottish National Dictionary, p. xxii&lt;/ref&gt;

The cluster {{angle bracket|nd}} is reduced to {{IPA|/n/}} in some Scots dialects&lt;ref name="johnston"&gt;Johnston, Paul (1997b). ''Regional variation'' in Charles Jones ed. The Edinburgh History of the Scots Language, Edinburgh University Press, p. 502.&lt;/ref&gt; hence spellings such as ''caun'le'' (candle), ''haun{{'}}'' (hand) and ''staun{{'}}'' (stand)&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; though the {{angle bracket|d}} is generally written in the literary standard, thus ''caundle'', ''haund'' and ''staund''.

The cluster {{angle bracket|ld}} is also reduced to {{IPA|/l/}} in some Scots dialects,&lt;ref name="johnston" /&gt; hence spellings such as ''aul{{'}}'' (old), ''caul{{'}}'' (cold) and ''faul{{'}}'' (fold)&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; though the {{angle bracket|d}} is generally written in the literary standard, thus ''auld'', ''cauld'' and ''fauld''.

== Loss of consonants ==
By the [[Middle Scots]] period, {{IPA|/f/}} and {{IPA|/v/}} [[Deletion (phonology)|deletion]] had occurred intervocalically and between a nasal/liquid consonant and a vowel.&lt;ref name="A History of Scots to 1700, p.ci"/&gt; Hence spellings such as ''de'il'' (devil), ''gi'e'' (give), ''ha'e'' (have), ''lo'e'' (love), ''o{{'}}'' (of), ''o'er'' (over) and ''sil'er'' (silver), the standard literary apostrophe-less spellings being ''deil'', ''gie'', ''hae'', ''lue'', ''o'', ''ower'' and ''siller''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Scottish National Dictionary, p. xxiii&lt;/ref&gt;

Also by that period, word-final {{IPA|/θ/}} had been lost in a number of words.&lt;ref name="A History of Scots to 1700, p.ci"/&gt; Hence spellings such as ''fro'&lt;nowiki/&gt;'' (froth), ''quo'&lt;nowiki/&gt;'' (quoth), ''wi'&lt;nowiki/&gt;'' (with) and ''mou''' (mouth), the standard literary apostrophe-less spellings being ''fro'', ''quo'', ''wi'' and ''mou'',&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; the latter having the doublet ''mooth''.

== Change of vowel ==
In some Scots words the realisation differs from that of the Standard English cognate; hence spellings such as ''bak{{'}}'' (bake), ''mak{{'}}'' (make) and ''tak{{'}}'' (take), the standard literary apostrophe-less spellings being ''bak'', ''mak'' and ''tak''.

== Legitimate use of the apostrophe in Scots ==
Many words in Scots have both a full form and a [[Contraction (grammar)|contracted]] form. In contracted forms, an apostrophe is generally used in place of the [[Elision|elided]] [[grapheme]]s, for example, ''e'en'' and ''even'', ''e'er'' and ''iver'' (ever), ''eneu{{'}}'' and ''eneuch'' (enough), ''lea{{'}}'' and ''leave'', ''ne'er'' and ''niver'' (never), ''ne'er's day'' and ''new year's day'', ''nor'land'' and ''northland''.

In the construction of the [[past tense]] or past [[participle]], Scots often appends the apostrophe to verbs ending with ''ee'' to prevent three ''e''s from occurring in a single word:

*''dee'' (die) &gt; ''dee'd''
*''gree'' (agree) &gt; ''gree'd''

Scots also uses, as does English, the apostrophe to indicate contractions of multiple words: ''A'm'' (I'm), ''wi't'' (with it), ''ye're'' (you're), ''o't'' (of it).

'''Armenian Library and Museum of America''' ('''ALMA'''), located in [[Watertown, Massachusetts|Watertown]], [[Massachusetts]], [[United States]], is an institution that has the largest collection of [[Armenian culture|Armenian]] artifacts in [[North America]].

==History==
In 1971, alarmed by the growing loss and destruction of Armenian books and artifacts brought to this country by immigrants from [[Armenia]], a group of talented [[Greater Boston]] [[Armenian-Americans]] banded together to form ALMA to collect and preserve these books and artifacts. From humble beginnings in two rooms rented in 1972 in a church parish house in [[Belmont, Massachusetts|Belmont]], ALMA grew and expanded into a Watertown church's {{convert|4000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} basement and opened to the public in 1985. 

In 1988, ALMA was able to buy and remodel the former Coolidge Bank and Trust Building at 65 Main Street in Watertown. After being opened to the public as the Armenian Library and Museum of America, the building was dedicated to the memory of [[Stephen P. Mugar]] and Marian G. Mugar, his wife. 

==Building description==
ALMA's present home is a four-story building plus basement containing approximately {{convert|30000|sqft|m2}}.  ALMA occupies all of the basement, the first and second floors, most of the third floor and has its library on the fourth floor. The building also houses the United States offices of the [[Armenia Tree Project]], as well as the Armenian International Women's Association ("AIWA") and Project SAVE Armenian Photographic Archives.

==Museum facilities==
Bedoukian Hall is ALMA's  main exhibit gallery. There are several smaller side galleries as well as the Contemporary Art Gallery and Terjenian-Thomas Art Gallery on the 3rd floor. Other facilities include the research library, studio space, offices, meeting rooms, classrooms, a 220-seat auditorium and a gift shop.

==Museum collections==
Armenian Museum of America (subdivision of ALMA) holds one of the largest and most diverse holding of Armenian cultural artifacts outside of Armenia. The Museum maintains an active program of changing exhibits for the public to provide new experiences for returning visitors and to showcase the wide range of materials in the collection. The museum averages 14 different exhibits annually.

As a repository for heirlooms, the collections now represent a major resource for Armenian studies and for preservation and illustration of Armenian heritage. ALMA is the only independent Armenian museum in the diaspora funded solely through contributions of individual supporters. An active board of trustees and volunteer base augment the museum’s four-member staff.

The collections contain over 20,000 artifacts, including:
* Countless artifacts including prehistoric, Urartian, religious, ceramic, medieval illuminations and various other objects;
* Over 5,000 ancient and medieval Armenian coins;
* Over 3,000 textiles: ALMA has one of the largest Armenian textile collections outside of Armenia.  The trained textile curator, Susan Lind-Sinanian, has acted as a textile consultant to various institutions.  The textiles are housed in climate-controlled space in the basement of the building.  There they are also photographed, documented and cataloged.
* 930 rare books; and
* 170 Armenian rugs, many of which are inscribed in Armenian. The collection includes the [[Arthur T. Gregorian]] collection of Armenian inscribed rugs which he donated in 1992.

==Library==
Armenian Library of America (subdivision of ALMA) is home to the Mersop Boyajian Library. The Library contains over 26,000 cataloged titles on a wide range of Armenian subjects.  The earliest is the Garabed Gospel of AD 1207.  The library has one of the largest collections of important books on oriental rugs, and a very substantial collection, which continues to be expanded, on the [[Armenian Genocide]].  It also holds a significant number of periodicals.

The library is home to the Herbert Offen Oriental Carpet Research Library Collection, one of the most extensive collections of literature on oriental carpets in the United States. The Offen Family's generous gift includes both the books in the Herbert Offen Collection, as well as funding of acquisitions of new, recently published and antiquarian works related to the literature of rugs and carpets. 

The Herbert Offen collection of over 2,500 volumes extends beyond the narrow focus on the types and development of Oriental rugs, and encompasses broader issues including the social implications of rug collecting, symbolism and theory, care and aesthetics, the commercial marketing and business of rugs, economic and domestic structures in carpet production, historical and contemporary use of rugs, and other textile traditions closely related to rugs.

==Oral history collection==
In the early 1970s ALMA embarked on an extensive program of interviewing survivors of the Armenian Genocide, all or most of whom are now deceased.  These tapes are digitized and de-noised.  ALMA's collection consists of over 1,400 hours of recorded oral histories and is a fertile source for research by scholars.

'''Asian Americans''' are Americans of Asian descent. The term refers to a [[Panethnicity|panethnic]] group that includes diverse populations, which have ancestral origins in [[East Asia]], [[South Asia]], or [[Southeast Asia]], as defined by the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]].&lt;ref name="c2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:C2010br-02.pdf |title=Overview of Race and Hispanic Origin: 2010 |author=Karen R.

Although migrants from Asia have been in parts of the contemporary United States since the 17th century, large-scale immigration did not begin until the mid-18th century. Nativist immigration laws during the 1880s–1920s excluded various Asian groups, eventually [[Asian Exclusion Act|prohibiting almost all Asian immigration]] to the continental United States. After immigration laws were reformed during the 1940s–60s, [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965|abolishing national origins quotas]], Asian immigration increased rapidly. Analyses of the 2010 census have shown that Asian Americans are the fastest growing racial or ethnic minority in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2012/03/23/149244806/u-s-census-show-asians-are-fastest-growing-racial-group|title=U.S. Census Show Asians Are Fastest Growing Racial Group|newspaper=NPR.org|access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
As with other [[race (classification of human beings)|racial]] and [[ethnic group|ethnicity]]-based [[ethnonym|terms]], formal and common usage have changed markedly through the short history of this term. Prior to the late 1960s, people of Asian ancestry were usually referred to as ''[[Oriental]]'', ''Asiatic'', and ''[[Mongoloid]]''.&lt;ref name="K.

===Debates===
The definition of ''Asian American'' has variations that derive from the [[use of the word American|use of the word ''American'']] in different contexts. Immigration status, citizenship (by birthright and by naturalization), acculturation, and language ability are some variables that are used to define ''American'' for various purposes and may vary in formal and everyday usage.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Daniel B.

Scholars have grappled with the accuracy, correctness, and usefulness of the term Asian American. The term "Asian" in Asian American most often comes under fire for encompassing a huge number of people with ancestry from (or who have immigrated from) a wide range of culturally diverse countries and traditions. In contrast, leading [[social science]]s and [[humanities]] scholars of race and Asian American identity point out that because of the racial constructions in the United States, including the social attitudes toward race and those of Asian ancestry, Asian Americans have a "shared racial experience."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Geisha of a Different Kind: Race and Sexuality in Gaysian America|last=Han|first=Chong-Suk Winter|publisher=New York University Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=New York|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this shared experience, the term Asian American is still a useful [[Panethnicity|panethnic]] category because of the similarity of some experiences among Asian Americans, including stereotypes specific to people in this category.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Religious Trends====
The percentage of Christians among Asian Americans has declined sharply since the 1990s, chiefly due to largescale immigration from countries in which Christianity is a minority religion (China and India in particular). In 1990, 63% of the Asian Americans identified as Christians, while in 2001 only 43% did.&lt;ref&gt;Leffel, Gregory P.

United States]]'' (1922) and ''[[United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind]]'' (1923), the Supreme Court upheld the racial qualification for citizenship and ruled that Asians were not "white persons." Second-generation Asian Americans, however, could become U.S. citizens due to the [[Birthright citizenship in the United States|birthright citizenship]] clause of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]; this guarantee was confirmed as applying regardless of race or ancestry by the Supreme Court in ''[[United States v.

From the 1880s to the 1920s, the United States passed laws inaugurating an era of exclusion of Asian immigrants. Although the absolute numbers of Asian immigrants were small compared to that of immigrants from other regions, much of it was concentrated in the West, and the increase caused some nativist sentiment known as the "[[yellow peril]]". Congress passed [[Chinese Exclusion Act|restrictive legislation]] prohibiting nearly all Chinese immigration in the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;Takaki, ''Strangers from a Different Shore: A History of Asian Americans'' (1998) pp 370–78&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese immigration was sharply curtailed by a [[Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907|diplomatic agreement]] in 1907.

===Postwar immigration===
World War II-era legislation and judicial rulings gradually increased the ability of Asian Americans to immigrate and become [[United States nationality law|naturalized]] citizens. Immigration rapidly increased following the enactment of the [[Immigration and Nationality Act Amendments of 1965]] as well as the influx of [[refugees#Southeast Asia (Vietnam War)|refugees]] from conflicts occurring in Southeast Asia such as the [[Vietnam War]]. Asian American immigrants have a significant percentage of individuals who have already achieved professional status, a first among immigration groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baylor.edu/content/services/document.php?id=19089

===Asian American movement===
{{main|Asian American movement}}

The Asian American movement refers to a pan-Asian movement in the United States in which Americans of Asian descent came together to fight against their shared oppression and to organize for recognition and advancement of their shared cause during the 1960s to the early 1980s. William Wei described the movement as "rooted in a past history of oppression and a present struggle for liberation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nlue11bhyb4C|title=Race Pride and the American Identity|last=Rhea|first=Joseph Tilden|date=May 1, 2001|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674005761|page=43|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This occurred around the same time as the [[Chicano movement]], [[Civil Rights Movement]], [[American Indian Movement]] and the [[Gay liberation|gay liberation movement]].

===Business===
{{Missing information|section|the history of the subject|date=August 2009}}
When Asian Americans were largely excluded from labor markets in the 19th century, they started their own businesses. They have started convenience and grocery stores, professional offices such as medical and law practices, laundries, restaurants, beauty-related ventures, hi-tech companies, and many other kinds of enterprises, becoming very successful and influential in American society. They have dramatically expanded their involvement across the American economy. Asian Americans have been disproportionately successful in the hi-tech sectors of California's Silicon Valley, as evidenced by the [[Goldsea]] 100 Compilation of America's Most Successful Asian Entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://goldsea.com/Profiles/100/100.html | title=100 Most Successful Asian American Entrepreneurs }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{col-begin}}
{{col-break|width=72%}}
Asian immigrants are also changing the American medical landscape through increasing number of Asian [[health care|medical practitioners]] in the United States. Beginning in the 1960s and 1970s, the US government invited a number of foreign physicians particularly from India and the Philippines to address the acute shortage of physicians in rural and medically underserved urban areas. The trend in importing foreign medical practitioners, however, became a long-term, chronic solution as US medical schools failed to produce enough physicians to match the increasing American population. Amid decreasing interest in medicine among American college students due to high educational costs and high rates of job dissatisfaction, loss of morale, stress, and lawsuits, Asian American immigrants maintained a supply of healthcare practitioners for millions of Americans. It is well documented that Asian American international medical graduates including highly skilled guest workers using the J1 Visa program for medical workers, tend to serve in health professions shortage areas (HPSA) and specialties that are not filled by US medical graduates especially primary care and rural medicine.&lt;ref name="IMGPrimaryCare"&gt;Koehn NN, Fryer GE Jr, Phillips RL, Miller JB, Green LA. (2007) The increase in international medical graduates in family practice residency programs. Journal of Family Medicine, 34(6):468–9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IMGGeoDistribution"&gt;Mick SS, Lee SY. (2007) Are there need-based geographical differences between international medical graduates and U.S. medical graduates in rural U.S. counties? J Rural Health. 1999 Winter;15(1):26–43.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Asian American immigrants play a key role in averting a medical crisis in the US.

A lasting legacy of Asian American involvement in medicine is the forcing of US medical establishment to accept minority medical practitioners. One could speculate that the introduction of Asian physicians and dentists to the American society could have triggered an acceptance of other minority groups by breaking down stereotypes and encouraging trust.&lt;ref&gt;Somnath Saha, MD, MPH; Gretchen Guiton, PhD; Paul F. Wimmers, PhD; LuAnn Wilkerson, EdD. (2008) "Student Body Racial and Ethnic Composition and Diversity-Related Outcomes in US Medical Schools". ''JAMA''. 2008;300(10):1135–1145&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional Asian concepts and practices in health and medicine have attracted greater acceptance and are more widely adopted by American doctors. India's [[Ayurveda]] and traditional [[Chinese medicine]] (which also includes [[acupuncture]]) are two alternative therapy systems that have been studied and adopted to a great extent. For instance, in the early 1970s the US medical establishment did not believe in the usefulness of acupuncture. Since then studies have proven the efficacy of acupuncture for different applications, especially for treatment of chronic pain.&lt;ref name="WHO 2003.3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Acupuncture: Review and Analysis of Reports on Controlled Clinical Trials |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |year=2003 |last=Zhang |first=X |url=http://www.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Js4926e/#Js4926e.5 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420025543/http://www.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Js4926e/ |archivedate=April 20, 2009 |df=mdy }} and&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ernst E, Pittler MH, Wider B, Boddy K |title=Acupuncture: its evidence-base is changing |journal=Am J Chin Med. |volume=35|issue=1 |pages=21–5 |year=2007 |pmid=17265547 |doi=10.1142/S0192415X07004588}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among America's major racial categories, Asian Americans have the highest educational qualifications. This varies, however, for individual ethnic groups. For example, a 2010 study of all Asian American adults found 42% have at least a college degree, but only 16% of Vietnamese Americans and only 5% for Laotians and Cambodians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://education.jhu.edu/PD/newhorizons/strategies/topics/multicultural-education/A%20closer%20look%20at%20asian%20americans%20and%20education/index.html |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20150630114518/http://education.jhu.edu/PD/newhorizons/strategies/topics/multicultural-education/A%20closer%20look%20at%20asian%20americans%20and%20education/index.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 30, 2015 |title=School of Education at Johns Hopkins University-A Closer Look at Asian Americans and Education |author=C.N.

===Bamboo ceiling===
{{Main|Bamboo ceiling}}

This concept appears to elevate Asian Americans by portraying them as an elite group of successful, highly educated, intelligent, and wealthy individuals, but it can also be considered an overly narrow and overly one-dimensional portrayal of Asian Americans, leaving out other human qualities such as vocal leadership, negative emotions, risk taking, ability to learn from mistakes, and desire for creative expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sitemaker.umich.edu/psy457_tizzle/the_model_minority |title=Asian Americans and the Media: Perpetuating the Model Minority |first=Joy|last=Cheng |author2=Charles Hsieh |author3=Scott Lu |author4=Sarah Talog |work=Psychology 457.002 |publisher=University of Michigan |accessdate=February 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Asian Americans who do not fit into the model minority mold can face challenges when people's expectations based on the model minority myth do not match with reality. Traits outside of the model minority mold can be seen as negative character flaws for Asian Americans despite those very same traits being positive for the general American majority (e.g., risk taking, confidence, empowered). For this reason, Asian Americans encounter a "bamboo ceiling", the Asian American equivalent of the [[glass ceiling]] in the workplace, with only 1.5% of [[Fortune 500]] [[Chief Executive Officer|CEOs]] being Asians, a percentage smaller than their percentage of the total United States population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Asians in America: What's Holding Back the "Model Minority?" |author=Sylvia Ann Hewlett |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/sylviaannhewlett/2011/07/28/asians-in-america-whats-holding-back-the-model-minority/ |newspaper=Forbes |date=July 28, 2011|accessdate=February 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bamboo ceiling is defined as a combination of individual, cultural, and organisational factors that impede Asian Americans' career progress inside organizations. Since then, a variety of sectors (including nonprofits, universities, the government) have discussed the impact of the ceiling as it relates to Asians and the challenges they face. As described by Anne Fisher, the "bamboo ceiling" refers to the processes and barriers that serve to exclude Asians and American people of Asian descent from executive positions on the basis of subjective factors such as "lack of leadership potential" and "lack of communication skills" that cannot actually be explained by job performance or qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Piercing the 'Bamboo Ceiling' |author=Anne Fisher |url=http://money.cnn.com/2005/08/08/news/economy/annie/fortune_annie080805/index.htm |newspaper=[[CNN]] |date=August 8, 2005 |accessdate=June 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Articles regarding the subject have been published in ''[[Crains]]'', ''[[Fortune magazine]]'', and ''[[The Atlantic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Training executives to think globally |author=Anne Fisher |url=http://mycrains.crainsnewyork.com/blogs/executive-inbox/2011/11/training-executives-to-think-globally/ |newspaper=Crain's New York Business |date=November 18, 2011 |accessdate=June 14, 2012}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite news|title=Is there a 'bamboo ceiling' at U.S. companies? |author=Anne Fisher |url=http://management.fortune.cnn.com/2011/10/07/asian-americans-promotion-us-companies/ |newspaper=Fortune Magazine |date=October 7, 2011 |accessdate=June 14, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212000635/http://management.fortune.cnn.com/2011/10/07/asian-americans-promotion-us-companies/ |archivedate=February 12, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite news |title=Study of the Day: There's a 'Bamboo Ceiling' for Would-Be Asian Leaders |author=Hans Villarica |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/05/theres-a-bamboo-ceiling-for-would-be-asian-leaders/257135/ |newspaper=[[The Atlantic]] |date=May 15, 2012 |accessdate=June 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the stereotype of Asian Americans being successful as a group and having the lowest crime rates in the United States, illegal immigration is mostly focused on those from Mexico and Latin America while leaving out Asians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://academiccommons.columbia.edu/download/fedora_content/download/ac:124622/CONTENT/pols_w3245_2009_weingarten.pdf |title=Asian American Immigration Status |first=Liza|last=Weingarten |author2=Raymond Arthur Smith |year=2009 |work=Majority Rule and Minority Rights Issue Briefs |publisher=Columbia University |accessdate=March 4, 2012 |quote=Deemed successful as a complete group, the national immigration debate often leaves out Asians focusing instead on South America primarily.

Until the late 20th century, the term "Asian American" was adopted mostly by activists, while the average person of Asian ancestries identified with their specific ethnicity.&lt;ref name="yip"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianweek.com/061397/feature.html |first=Alethea |last=Yip |publisher=Asian Week |title=Remembering Vincent Chin |accessdate=March 14, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070318184237/http://www.asianweek.com/061397/feature.html |archivedate=March 18, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[murder of Vincent Chin]] in 1982 was a pivotal civil rights case, and it marked the emergence of Asian Americans as a distinct group in United States.&lt;ref name=yip/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michigan.gov/documents/ACAPAA_policy_recommendation_159211_7.pdf |format=PDF |author=ACAPAA |publisher=State of Michigan |title=Pilicy Recommendation Document. |accessdate=March 14, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308150132/http://www.michigan.gov/documents/ACAPAA_policy_recommendation_159211_7.pdf |archivedate=March 8, 2007 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stereotypes of Asians have been largely collectively internalized by society and these stereotypes have mainly negative repercussions for Asian Americans and Asian immigrants in daily interactions, [[current events]], and governmental [[legislation]]. In many instances, media portrayals of East Asians often reflect a dominant [[Americentric]] perception rather than realistic and authentic depictions of true cultures, customs and behaviors.&lt;ref name="vanishing"&gt;{{Citation |last=Kashiwabara |first=Amy |url=http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/Amydoc.html |title=Vanishing Son: The Appearance, Disappearance, and Assimilation of the Asian-American Man in American Mainstream Media |publisher=UC Berkeley Media Resources Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asians have experienced [[discrimination]] and have been victims of [[hate crime]]s related to their ethnic stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pearl Harbor and Asian-Americans |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/26/opinion/pearl-harbor-and-asian-americans.html |newspaper=New York Times |date=October 26, 1991 |accessdate=December 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Model minority====
{{Main|Model minority}}
Asian Americans are sometimes characterized as a [[model minority]] in the United States because many of their cultures encourage a strong work ethic, a respect for elders, a high degree of professional and academic success, a high valuation of family, education and religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asian-nation.org/model-minority.shtml |title=The Model Minority Image |last1=Le |first1=C.N. |year=2001 |work=Asian-Nation: The Landscape of Asian America |publisher=C.N.

The implicit advice is that the other minorities should stop protesting and emulate the Asian American work ethic and devotion to higher education. Some critics say the depiction replaces biological racism with cultural racism, and should be dropped.&lt;ref&gt;Chih-Chieh Chou, "Critique on the notion of model minority: an alternative racism to Asian American?", ''Asian Ethnicity'', October 2008, Vol. 9#3 Issue 3, pp 219–229&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Washington Post]], "the idea that Asian Americans are distinct among minority groups and immune to the challenges faced by other people of color is a particularly sensitive issue for the community, which has recently fought to reclaim its place in social justice conversations with movements like #ModelMinorityMutiny."&lt;ref name=YananWang&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wang|first1=Yanan|title=Asian Americans speak out against a decades-old 'model minority' myth|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/10/20/asian-americans-speak-out-against-a-decades-old-model-minority-myth/|accessdate=January 12, 2016|agency=[[Washington Post]]|date=October 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disparity at postgraduate levels is even greater, and the differential is especially notable in fields making heavy use of mathematics. By 2000, a plurality of undergraduates at such elite public California schools as [[UC Berkeley]] and [[UCLA]], which are obligated by law to not consider race as a factor in admission, were Asian American. The pattern is rooted in the pre-World War II era. Native-born Chinese and Japanese Americans reached educational parity with majority whites in the early decades of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Hirschman and Morrison G.

The model minority concept can be emotionally damaging to some Asian Americans, particularly since they are expected to live up to those peers who fit the stereotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Asians Often Burdened as Model Minority |first=Doris |last=Nhan |url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/thenextamerica/education/asians-often-burdened-as-model-minority-20120511 |newspaper=National Journal |date=May 15, 2012 |accessdate=February 19, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130109055547/http://nationaljournal.com/thenextamerica/education/asians-often-burdened-as-model-minority-20120511 |archivedate=January 9, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that some Asian Americans suffer from higher rates of stress, depression, mental illnesses, and suicides in comparison to other races,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hawaii.edu/hivandaids/Mental_Health_and_Depression_in_Asian_Americans.pdf "Mental Health and Depression in Asian Americans"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150121220201/http://www.hawaii.edu/hivandaids/Mental_Health_and_Depression_in_Asian_Americans.pdf |date=January 21, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; indicating that the pressures to achieve and live up to the model minority image may take a mental and psychological toll on some Asian Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Push to achieve tied to suicide in Asian-American women |first=Elizabeth|last=Cohen |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/HEALTH/05/16/asian.suicides/ |newspaper=CNN |date=May 16, 2007 |accessdate=February 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "model minority" stereotype fails to distinguish between different ethnic groups with different histories. When divided up by ethnicity, it can be seen that the economic and academic successes supposedly enjoyed by Asian Americans are concentrated into a few ethnic groups. Cambodians, Hmong, and Laotians (and to a lesser extent, Vietnamese), all of whose relatively low achievement rates are possibly due to their [[refugee]] status, and that they are non-voluntary immigrants;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asian-nation.org/demographics.shtml |title=Socioeconomic Statistics &amp; Demographics : Asian-Nation :: Asian American History, Demographics, &amp; Issues |publisher=Asian-Nation |accessdate=November 11, 2012}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite news |title=Asian Americans to Pew Study: We're Not Your 'Model Minority' |first=Julianne|last=Hing |url=http://www.thehartfordguardian.com/2012/06/22/asian-americans-to-pew-study-were-not-your-model-minority/ |newspaper=The Hartford Guardian |date=June 22, 2012 |accessdate=June 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; additionally, one in five Hmong and Bangladeshi people live in [[Poverty in the United States|poverty]].&lt;ref name="SAddams3MAY12"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4049">The '''BBB Wise Giving Alliance''' ('''WGA''') is a national charity monitoring organization.&lt;ref&gt;It is a charitable affiliate of the Council of Better Business Bureaus.&lt;/ref&gt; Under previous names, it has been reporting on nationally-soliciting charities since the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Wise Giving Guide Anniversary Edition, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.give.org/globalassets/wga/wise-giving-guides/spring-2016-guide-article.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; BBB’s [[Give.org]] evaluates charities, at no charge, using the 20 ''[http://www.give.org/for-charities/How-We-Accredit-Charities/ BBB Standards for Charity Accountability]'' to help donors verify the trustworthiness of soliciting organizations and to strengthen charity practices. Resulting reports are freely accessible to the public at [[Give.org]]. These standards were developed with the help of the charitable community.&lt;ref&gt;Implementation Guide to the ''BBB Standards for Charity Accountability'', &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.give.org/for-charities/How-We-Accredit-Charities/implementation-guide/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Standards for Charity Accountability==
In 2003, the WGA adopted a set of twenty "Standards for Charity Accountability". These standards replaced earlier versions by the PAS and the NCIB.  The WGA developed these standards in conjunction with the [[Better Business Bureau]], professional accounting organizations, charitable organizations, and foundations that fund grants.

The WGA explains that these standards were developed "to assist donors in making sound giving decisions and to foster public confidence in charitable organizations. The standards seek to encourage fair and honest solicitation practices, to promote ethical conduct by charitable organizations and to advance support of philanthropy."&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The standards set a baseline for ethical governance, responsible fundraising, and transparency of financial operations.

Adherence to the Standards for Charity Accountability is voluntary; no charity is legally bound to submit documentation of its operations to the WGA.  The absence of documentation, or the absence of a charity's inclusion in the BBB reporting system, may not necessarily indicate negative or unlawful behavior on the part of the charity.

==Evaluated charities==

A listing of charitable organizations currently evaluated by the WGA is available on its website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://give.org/charity-reviews/national/ National Charity Report Directory, from Give.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

''USA Today'' reported that the WGA’s charity seal program had come under fire.&lt;ref&gt; O’Donnell, Jayne.[https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2012/12/27/better-business-bureau-charity-ratings-donations/1636957/ "BBB's charity ratings, seal of approval under fire,"] USA Today, Dec. 27, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The WGA licenses its seal to charities that meet its 20 standards of accountability at rates from $1,000 to $15,000 annually. This income provides 67 percent of the WGA’s budget.

U.S. Senator [[Richard Blumenthal]] said that this financial relationship raises questions about "credibility and possible conflicts of interest." The [[American Institute of Philanthropy]], another charity rater, criticized the WGA for taking money from the same charities it was rating. The WGA replied that there is "a strict separation between the people who do the accreditations and the ones who work on the seal programs."

'''Barry L. Frankhauser''' is an [[archaeologist]] who has worked in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].

==Works==
Frankhauser's Ph.D. thesis (published 1986) was a study of historical uses of the [[Cabbage tree (Cordyline australis)|cabbage tree]], an important food and fibre source in the [[Māori culture]] for at least 800 years.  The [[Māori Television]] network produced a [[Television documentary|TV documentary]] on the subject, using his thesis as a starting point, which aired in 2004. The documentary includes an interview with Frankhauser.

In 1990 Frankhauser participated in a two-day seminar (''Geochemical Methods for Dating of Rock Art'') held in [[Canberra]], which drew archeologists from three continents to evaluate the scientific soundness of the cation-ratio method of dating ancient rock art specimens.  That seminar concluded that the method had significant drawbacks and should be re-evaluated as a definitive test.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uvm.edu/cosmolab/papers/Bednarik_1990_560.pdf{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Robert G.

'''''Byzantium after Byzantium''''' (''Bizanţ după Bizanţ'' in [[Romanian language|Romanian]]; ''Byzance après Byzance'' in French) is a 1935 book by the [[Romanian people|Romanian]] historian [[Nicolae Iorga]], which gave its name to a national cultural movement. It refers to the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] imperial influence on the political, social, cultural, and intellectual development of the principalities of [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]]. The book deals with the impact of the fall of the [[Byzantine Empire]] on European civilization, the legacy and the continuation of Byzantine institutions and culture.

{{Politics of the Caribbean Community}}
The '''CARICOM Single Market and Economy''', also known as the '''Caribbean Single Market and Economy''' ('''CSME'''), is an integrated development strategy envisioned at the 10th Meeting of the Conference of Heads of Government of the [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM) which took place in July 1990 in Grand Anse, [[Grenada]]. The Grand Anse Declaration&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caricom.org/communications/view/grand-anse-declaration-and-work-programme-for-the-advancement-of-the-integr|title=GRAND ANSE DECLARATION AND WORK PROGRAMME FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE INTEGRATION MOVEMENT, JULY 1989, GRAND ANSE, GRENADA —Caribbean Community (CARICOM) Secretariat|first=CARICOM|last=Secretariat|website=caricom.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; had three key Features:
#Deepening economic integration by advancing beyond a common market towards a Single Market and Economy.
#Widening the membership and thereby expanding the economic mass of the Caribbean Community (e.g. Suriname and Haiti were admitted as full members in 1995 and 2002 respectively).
#Progressive insertion of the region into the global trading and economic system by strengthening trading links with non-traditional partners.

A precursor to CARICOM and its CSME was the [[CARIFTA|Caribbean Free Trade Agreement]], formed in 1965 and dissolved in 1973.

==Single market and economy==
The CSME will be implemented through a number of phases, first being the CARICOM Single Market (CSM). The CSM was initially implemented on January 1, 2006, with the signing of the document for its implementation by six original member states. However the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas establishing the CSME had been provisionally applied by twelve member states of CARICOM from February 4, 2002, under a Protocol on the Provisional Application of the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas.&lt;ref name="Caribbean Integration Law" /&gt; Nine protocols had been drafted to amend the Original Treaty of Chaguaramas and had been consolidated into the Revised Treaty&lt;ref name="Caribbean Integration Law" /&gt; signed at Nassau in 2001,&lt;ref name="Protocol on the Provisional Application"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caricom.org/jsp/secretariat/legal_instruments/revised_treaty_provisional_application.jsp?menu=secretariat|title=Protocol on the Provisional Application of the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a number of the Protocols having been applied in part or in full from their creation in 1997-1998 including the provision on the Free Movement of Skilled Nationals.&lt;ref name="two more members states enact free movement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caricom.org/jsp/pressreleases/pres104_97.jsp?null&amp;prnf=1|title=Two more CARICOM members states enact free movement legislation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of July 3, 2006, it now has [[#Member states|12 members]]. Although the Caribbean Single Market and Economy (CSME) has been established, in 2006 it was only expected to be fully implemented in 2008.&lt;ref name="Ratification of CSM"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622062639/http://www.jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20060131/lead/lead1.html|title=Jamaica Gleaner News - CARICOM Single Market (CSM) ratified! - Caribbean leaders sign formal document - Tuesday - January 31, 2006|date=22 June 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2007 a new deadline for the coming into effect of the Single Economy was set for 2015,&lt;ref name="Single Economy in 2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stabroeknews.com/2007/archives/03/06/caricom-single-economy-in-place-by-2015-girvan-report/|title=Caricom single economy in place by 2015 - Girvan report|date=6 March 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; however following the global [[Financial crisis of 2007-08|2007-08 financial crisis]] and the resulting [[Great Recession]], in 2011, CARICOM Heads of Government declared that progress towards the Single Economy had been put on pause.&lt;ref name="Single Economy on Pause"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/columns/Caricom-in-paralysis--Single-economy-on--pause-_8905424|title=Rickey Singh: Caricom in paralysis as Single Economy put on pause|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The completion of the CSME with the Single Economy will be achieved with the harmonization of economic policy, and possibly a single currency.&lt;ref name="Ratification of CSM" /&gt;

At the eighteenth Inter-Sessional CARICOM Heads of Government Conference in St. Vincent and the Grenadines from 12–14 February 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caricom.org/jsp/pressreleases/pres48_07.jsp|title=Communique of the eighteenth inter-sessional meeting|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was agreed that while the framework for the Single Economy would be on target for 2008, the recommendations of a report on the CSME for the phased implementation of the Single Economy would be accepted.&lt;ref name="Full free movement of Caribbean nationals by the year 2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://old.jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20070216/carib/carib1.html|publisher=Jamaica Gleaner News |title=Full free movement of Caribbean nationals by the year 2009  | date=16 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Single Economy is now expected to be implemented in two phases.

===Phase 1===

Phase 1 was to take place between 2008 and 2009 &lt;ref name="Full free movement of Caribbean nationals by the year 2009"/&gt; with the consolidation of the Single Market and the initiation of the Single Economy. Its main elements would include:
*The outline of the Development Vision and the Regional Development Strategy 
*The extension of categories of free movement of labour and the streamlining of existing procedures, including contingent rights
*Full implementation of free movement of service providers, with streamlined procedures
*Implementation of Legal status (i.e. legal entrenchment) for the CARICOM Charter for Civil Society
*Establishment and commencement of operations of the [[CARICOM Single Market and Economy#CARICOM Development Fund|Regional Development Fund]]
*Approval of the CARICOM Investment Regime and CARICOM Financial Services Agreement, to come into effect by January 1, 2009
*Establishment of the [[Caribbean Community#Caribbean Exchange Network .28CXN.29|Regional Stock Exchange]]
*Implementation of the provisions the ''Rose Hall Declaration on Governance and Mature Regionalism'', including:
**The automatic application of decisions of the Conference of Heads of Government at the national level in certain defined areas.
**The creation of a [[CARICOM Commission]] with Executive Authority in the implementation of decisions in certain defined areas.
**The automatic generation of resources to fund regional institutions.
**The strengthening of the role of the [[Assembly of Caribbean Community Parliamentarians]].
*Further technical work, in collaboration with stakeholders, on regional policy frameworks for energy, agriculture, [[sustainable tourism]], agro-tourism, transport, new export services and small and medium enterprises.

During Phase 1 it is also expected that by January 1, 2009, there would be:
*Negotiation and political approval of the Protocol on Enhanced Monetary Cooperation
*Agreement among Central Banks on common CARICOM currency [[numeraire]]
*Detailed technical work on the harmonisation of taxation regimes and fiscal incentives (to commence on January 1, 2009).&lt;ref name="Towards a Single Economy and a Single
Development Vision"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caricom.org/jsp/single_market/single_economy_girvan.pdf|title=Microsoft Word - Document in Windows Internet Explorer&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Progress and delays====

While progress on the elements of Phase 1 has not resulted in its completion by 2009, a number of its elements have been met, including:

*The outline of the Development Vision and the Regional Development Strategy&lt;ref name="Towards a Single Development Vision"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caricom.org/jsp/single_market/single_economy_girvan.pdf|title=TOWARDS A SINGLE DEVELOPMENT VISION AND THE ROLE OF THE SINGLE ECONOMY by Norman Girvan|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The extension of categories of free movement of labour (to now include to household domestics, nurses, teachers and workers holding [[CARICOM Single Market and Economy#Regional accreditation|specific categories of vocational qualifications]]) and the streamlining of existing procedures, including contingent rights&lt;ref name="Amendment of CARICOM Skills Law"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20130523/business/business1.html|title=Jamaica to amend CARICOM skills law|website=jamaica-gleaner.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Full implementation of free movement of service providers, with streamlined procedures&lt;ref name="Temporary Service Provider Info"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmeonline.org/en/right-to-establish/item/74-temporary-service-provider-info|title=1146 - Error: 1146|website=www.csmeonline.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Establishment of the [[CARICOM Single Market and Economy#CARICOM Development Fund|Regional Development Fund]] and [[Caribbean Community#Caribbean Exchange Network .28CXN.29|Regional Stock Exchange]]

Notable elements that have yet to be completed are; legal entrenchment for the CARICOM Charter for Civil Society,&lt;ref name="CARICOM Civil Society Charter still not 'legal'"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trinidadexpress.com/news/98893554.html|title=CARICOM Civil Society Charter still not 'legal'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; approval of the CARICOM Investment Regime and CARICOM Financial Services Agreement (although in August 2013 Finance Ministers of the member states in a Community Council meeting approved the draft CARICOM Financial Services Agreement and the draft amendment to the Intra-CARICOM Double Taxation Agreement),&lt;ref name="CARICOM Financial Services Agreement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caricom.org/jsp/pressreleases/press_releases_2013/pres175_13.jsp|title=CARICOM FINANCE MINISTERS TACKLE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and implementation of the provisions the ''Rose Hall Declaration on Governance and Mature Regionalism''&lt;ref name="Caricom's painful 'realities'"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guyanachronicle.com/caricoms-painful-realities-pm-anthony-and-the-rose-hall-declaration/|title=CARICOM’s painful ‘realities’ -PM Anthony and the ‘Rose Hall Declaration’ - Guyana Chronicle|first=|last=admin|date=9 November 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phase 2===

Phase 2 is to take place between 2010 and 2015&lt;ref name="Full free movement of Caribbean nationals by the year 2009" /&gt; and consists of the consolidation and completion of the Single Economy. It is expected that decisions taken during Phase 1 would be implemented within this time period, although the details will depend on the technical work, consultations and decisions that would have been taken. Phase 2 will include:
*Harmonisation of taxation systems, incentives and the financial and regulatory environment
*Implementation of common policies in agriculture, energy-related industries, transport, small and medium enterprises, sustainable tourism and agro-tourism 
*Implementation of the Regional Competition Policy and Regional Intellectual Property Regime
*Harmonisation of fiscal and monetary policies
*Implementation of a CARICOM Monetary Union.&lt;ref name="Towards a Single Economy and a Single
Development Vision" /&gt;

Current full members of CARICOM and partial participant of the CSME:
* '''{{HAI}}'''

Haiti’s Parliament ratified the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas in October 2007 and Haitian Foreign Minister Jean Renald Clerisme presented the published Notice of Ratification to the Chairman of the Caribbean Community Council of Ministers, on 7 February clearing the way for the country’s full participation in the CSME&lt;ref name="Haiti, CARICOM, Canada and CSME"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caricom.org/jsp/pressreleases/pres40_08.jsp|title=Haiti, CARICOM and Canada move on CSME project|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 8 February 2008.&lt;ref name="Caribbean Integration Law"&gt;{{cite book |last=Barry |first=David |title=Caribbean Integration Law |edition= |date=January 2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-967007-9 |pages=51–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CARICOM Law: Revised Treaty status"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caricomlaw.org/Details.aspx?EntryId=79|title=Error|website=www.caricomlaw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haiti has not completed its implementation of the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas and is therefore not a full participant in the Single Market and Economy. In keeping with the thrust to rebuild the country following the [[2010 Haiti earthquake|2010 earthquake]] and earlier [[2004 Haitian coup d'état|2004 political crisis]], work has also continued on preparing Haiti to participate effectively in the CSME. It is being assisted in its preparations by the Secretariat, led by the CARICOM Representation Office in Haiti (CROH) which was re-opened in 2007 with funding from the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA).&lt;ref name="Haiti one year later"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caricom.org/jsp/pressreleases/press_releases_2011/pres06_11.jsp|title=HAITI ONE YEAR LATER - CARICOM CONTINUES SUPPORT TO ITS MEMBER STATE |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CROH, in 2007 started the Haiti CSME Project, the objective of which  was to assist the Government of Haiti in accelerating its participation in the CSME as a means of enabling Haiti to fully re-engage in the process of regional integration in the Caribbean Community.&lt;ref name="Haiti CSME Project"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caricomhaiti.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Integrating-With-Haiti1.-THE-REPORT-OF-THE-HAITI-CSME-PROJECT-2007-2011.Rev_.-30.11.2011.-docx.pdf|title=INTEGRATING WITH HAITI: THE REPORT OF THE HAITI CSME PROJECT -2007- 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
As a first step towards the CSME, Haiti was due to enter the trade in goods regime of the Single Market in January 2010 (earlier targets had been for some time in 2009)&lt;ref name="Haiti for CSME in 2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caribbean360.com/index.php/news/14161.html#axzz2sUo6dvfV|title=Page not found - Caribbean360|website=Caribbean360}}&lt;/ref&gt; but could not do so because of the earthquake.&lt;ref name="Haiti one year later" /&gt; Up until that point much work had been done by CROH and its Haitian government counterpart, the Bureau de Coordination et de Suivi or BCS (Office of Coordination and Monitoring), on the technical work necessary to bring the Haitian national tariff in line with the Caricom Common External Tariff (CET). The next step that had to be taken for Haiti to commence full free trade in goods within the CSME was therefore for the Haitian Parliament to pass legislation adopting the Caricom External tariff as Haiti’s national tariff. In mid 2009, the Government of Haiti announced that it would be ready to participate fully in free trade in goods within the CSME by 1 January 2010; and in fact through a revised Custom Act adopted by the Haitian Parliament in late 2009, 20-30% of the Caricom CET was incorporated into the Haitian national tariff. However soon after Haiti's progress towards full adoption of the CET began to stall with the dismissal of the Government of Prime Minister [[Michèle Pierre-Louis]] in November 2009 and was then put on hold as a result of the January 2010 earthquake.&lt;ref name="Haiti CSME Project" /&gt; To assist in stimulating economic activity, the Council for Trade and Economic Development (COTED) in December, approved a request for some Haitian products to be exported within the Single Market on a non-reciprocal preferential basis for three years. Consultations are on-going towards approval of additional items from an original list which Haiti submitted. The concession became effective from 1 January 2011. CARICOM Secretariat officials are continuing their training exercises with Haitian customs officials to facilitate their understanding of the CSME’s trading regime.&lt;ref name="Haiti one year later" /&gt;

In regards to the inclusion of Haitians in the free movement of skilled nationals under the CSME regime and a review of the visa policy towards Haitian nationals by other Caricom states some progress has been made. By early 2009, representation to the Caricom Heads of Government on the issue, particularly arising out of difficulties faced by Government officials travelling to Caricom meetings, led the Conference of Heads of Government to waive visa requirements for Haitian Government officials bearing official Government passports. In 2010 Caricom Heads of Government went a step further to facilitate travel by Haitian businesses persons and agreed that Haitians possessing US and Schengen visas would not require visas to enter other Caricom member states.&lt;ref name="Haiti CSME Project" /&gt; In regards to participation in the free movement of skilled nationals, Haiti has also been included in the relevant legislation of at least some CSME states as a participating member state.&lt;ref name="Skilled Nationals Act - Trinidad &amp; Tobago" /&gt;

* '''{{MSR}}'''

Montserrat was awaiting entrustment (approval) of the United Kingdom with regards to the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas in order to participate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themontserratreporter.com/topstories/regional/view_article.php?id=1056|title=Article from Montserrat reporter 27 January 2006|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but such entrustment was denied in mid-2008, and the CARICOM Heads of Government (including Montserrat) expressed disappointment and urged the United Kingdom to reconsider its position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stabroeknews.com/2008/archives/07/06/caricom-heads-urge-uk-to-reconsider-montserrat%E2%80%99s-case/|title=Caricom Heads urge UK to reconsider Montserrat’s case|date=6 July 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until such time, Montserrat remains a member under the conditions existing immediately prior to the coming into force of the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas and the CSM on 1 January 2006 and as such is legally in a common market relationship with all CSM participating states.&lt;ref name="CARICOM-Montserrat Agreement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caricomlaw.org/Details.aspx?EntryId=89|title=Error|website=www.caricomlaw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that while goods from Montserrat are eligible for CARICOM treatment and free trade (as covered under the old Common Market Annex), service providers in Montserrat are not eligible for CARICOM treatment unless so provided for by the various CSM countries individually in legislation or administratively.&lt;ref name="Consumers in the CSM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caricomcompetitioncommission.com/images/pdf/consumers-in-caricom-csme_booklet.pdf|title=CARICOM Competition Commission: Consumers in the CSME Booklet|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the start of the CSME process and after the denial of entrustment, Montserrat has been treated in the relevant legislation of other member states as being a participant of the CSME&lt;ref name="Skilled Nationals Act - Trinidad &amp; Tobago"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rgd.legalaffairs.gov.tt/Laws2/Alphabetical_List/lawspdfs%20/18.03.pdf|title=Immigration (Caribbean Community Skilled Nationals) Act - Trinidad &amp; Tobago|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Free Movement of Skilled Persons Act - Jamaica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moj.gov.jm/sites/default/files/laws/CCFMSP%20Act.pdf|title=Caribbean Community (Free Movement of Skilled Persons) Act - Jamaica|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CARICOM Skills Qualification - Barbados"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bac.gov.bb/Caricom_Skills_Qualification.htm|title=Certificate of Recognition of CARICOM Skills Qualification - Barbados Accreditation Council|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Montserrat itself implements aspects of the CSME where possible for its own residents&lt;ref name="Issue of Skilled Certificates"&gt;[http://labour.gov.ms/?page_id=26 Issue of Skilled Certificates to Montserrat residents]&lt;/ref&gt; and for nationals of other CSME states&lt;ref name="Regulations for employment in Montserrat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caricom.org/jsp/pressreleases/pres77_98.jsp|title=Regulations for employment in Montserrat|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (or provides more favourable treatment for such nationals where full implementation is not possible).&lt;ref name="Work Permit fees for Montserrat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mnialive.com/articles/new-work-permit-processing-fees-for-montserrat|title=New Work Permit Processing Fees For Montserrat|first=MNI|last=Alive|website=www.mnialive.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These measures include legal provisions for the automatic grant of 6 months stay under the freedom of movement obligations and honouring CARICOM skills certificates in Montserrat&lt;ref name="Montserrat to join CSME"/&gt; (the latter measure the Government of Montserrat had been implemented by way of amendments to existing Statutory Rules and Orders since 1996 in keeping with conformity with the original Conference of Heads of Government decision on the free movement of university graduates).&lt;ref name="February/March 1996 Communique"&gt;[http://www.caricom.org/jsp/communications/communiques/7inthgc_1996_communique.jsp Communique issued at the Conclusion of The Seventh Inter-Sessional Meeting of the Conference of Heads of Government  held in Georgetown, Guyana on 29th February – 1 March, 1996]&lt;/ref&gt; Montserrat also issues land holding licenses to CARICOM nationals as an administrative procedure in seeking to comply with CARICOM’s right of establishment obligations, and intends to remove all impediments except for those related to cost recovery. Montserrat's compliance with the movement of capital obligations under the CSME is already assured within the framework of the East Caribbean Currency Union.&lt;ref name="Montserrat to join CSME"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ms/2014/07/04/montserrat-to-join-caricom-single-market-and-economycsme/|title=Montserrat to join Caricom Single Market and Economy(CSME) » Government of Montserrat|website=www.gov.ms}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the thirty-fifth regular meeting of the Conference of Heads of Government ending on July 4, 2014, Reuben Meade, Premier of Montserrat, announced that Montserrat intends to accede to the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas by the next meeting of the Conference, paving the way for its full participation in the Community and particularly the CSME. Montserrat has been progressively making steps towards accession to the Revised Treaty, including obtaining the necessary instrument of entrustment from the United Kingdom. To this end Montserrat will be engaging with the CARICOM Secretariat and relevant CARICOM Institutions and the Caribbean Court of Justice in preparation for the deposit of its Instrument of Accession at the Twenty-Sixth Inter-Sessional Meeting of the Conference, to be held in February 2015 in The Bahamas.&lt;ref name="Montserrat intends to accede"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caricom.org/jsp/pressreleases/press_releases_2014/pres176_14.jsp|title=Communique issued at the conclusion of the 35th regular meeting of the Conference: Montserrat intends to accede|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Montserratian general election, 2014|September 2014 general elections]] in Montserrat, Reuben Meade's government was replaced by new government led by Donaldson Romeo. Romeo's government remained committed to acceding to the Revised Treaty, although the target date of February 2015 was not achieved. In July 2015, at the 36th Meeting of the Conference of Heads of Government in Bridgetown, Barbados, Romeo gave assurances that Montserrat was continuing efforts to complete the process of accession to the Revised Treaty in a timely manner. He revealed that engagement continued with the government of the United Kingdom and that the necessary legislation was being prepared for submission to the Legislative Assembly of Montserrat. He also stated that Montserrat viewed accession to the Caricom Development Fund and to the original jurisdiction of the Caribbean Court of Justice as being necessary to move Montserrat forwards in its effort to integrated and to safeguard the rules upon which its trade was based.&lt;ref name="Montserrat continuing efforts to accede to RTC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://today.caricom.org/2015/07/04/montserrat-continues-steps-towards-full-implementation-of-revised-treaty/|title=Montserrat continues steps towards full implementation of Revised Treaty|date=5 July 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Caribbean Court of Justice==

The [[Caribbean Court of Justice]] (CCJ) is the Highest regional Court established by the Agreement Establishing in the Caribbean Court of Justice. It has a long gestation period commencing in 1970 when the Jamaican delegation at the Sixth Heads of Government Conference, which convened in Jamaica, proposed the establishment of a Caribbean Court of Appeal in substitution for the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.

The Caribbean Court of Justice has been designed to be more than a court of last resort for Member States of the Caribbean Community of the Privy Council, the CCJ was vested with an original jurisdiction in respect of the interpretation and application of the Treaty Establishing the Caribbean Community (Treaty of Chaguramas) In effect, the CCJ would exercise both an appellate and an original jurisdiction.

In the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction, the CCJ considers and determines appeals in both civil and criminal matters from common law courts within the jurisdiction of Member States of the Community and which are parties to the Agreement Establishing the CCJ. In the discharge of its appellate jurisdiction, the CCJ is the highest municipal court in the Region. In the exercise of its original jurisdiction, the CCJ will be discharging the functions of an international tribunal applying rules of international law in respect of the interpretation and application of the Treaty and so will be the court of arbitration for trade disputes under the CSME.

By 2006, only two countries were full signatories to the Court: Barbados and Guyana, it was expected that by the end of 2010, all 14 member countries would be fully involved. However, only Belize acceded to the appellate jurisdiction in 2010 while all other states were in various stages of moving towards full accession to the court's appellate jurisdiction.  Dominica thereafter acceded to the appellate jurisdiction in March 2015.

==Trade in goods==

All goods which meet the CARICOM rules of origin are traded duty-free throughout the region (except The Bahamas), therefore all goods originating within the region can be traded without restrictions. In addition, most member states apply a Common External Tariff (CET) on good originating from non-CARICOM countries. There are, however, some areas still to be developed:

*Treatment of products made in Free Zones – there is need for regional agreement on how these goods are to be treated since they are usually manufactured at reduced tariff by foreign companies.
*The removal of some specific non-tariff barriers in various member-states.

Another key element in relations to goods is Free Circulation. This provision allows for the free movement of goods imported from extra regional sources which would require collection of taxes at first point of entry into the CSME and for the sharing of collected customs revenue.

==Harmonization of standards==

Complementary to the free movement of goods will be the guarantee of acceptable standards of these goods and services. To accomplish this, CARICOM members have established the Caribbean Regional Organization on Standards and Quality (CROSQ). The Organization will be responsible for establishing regional standards in the manufacture and trade of goods which all Member States must adhere to. This Organization was established by a separate agreement from the CSME.&lt;ref name="JIS website on CSME"/&gt;

As an example of the work of the CROSQ, in conjunction with other regional bodies, on 6 October 2017, COTED approved nine poultry processing plants in Barbados, Belize&lt;ref name="Way cleared for regional trade in poultry products"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://today.caricom.org/2017/10/12/way-cleared-for-regional-trade-in-poultry-poultry-products/#more-24402|title=Way cleared for regional trade in poultry, poultry products|date=12 October 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (including Quality Poultry Products' plant and Caribbean Chicken's plant)&lt;ref name="Belize chicken cleared for Region"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.breakingbelizenews.com/2017/10/13/caricom-clears-belize-chickens-export/|title=CARICOM clears Belize chickens for export|website=www.breakingbelizenews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="CARICOM open to Belize chicken"&gt;[http://www.7newsbelize.com/sstory.php?nid=42238 CARICOM open to Belize chicken]&lt;/ref&gt;, Guyana, Jamaica, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago to trade poultry and poultry products across the region after assessments by Regional Risk Assessment Teams (coordinated by the Caribbean Agricultural Health and Food Safety Agency (CAHFSA) and reviewed and finalized by the CARICOM Committee of Chief Veterinary Officers) proved they met the sanitary requirements (Specifications for Poultry and Poultry Products) developed by CROSQ and approved by COTED in 2013. Additionally the COTED resolved the disagreement on duck meat trade between Trinidad and Tobago and Suriname, with Trinidad and Tobago now willing (by mid-November 2017) to approve Suriname as one of the countries that has met the sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) requirements for exporting duck meat to the country.&lt;ref name="Way cleared for regional trade in poultry products"/&gt;

==Regional accreditation==

Regional accreditation bodies are planned to assess qualifications for equivalency, complementary to the free movement of persons. To this end, the Member States have  concluded the Agreement on Accreditation for Education in Medical and other Health Professions. By this agreement, an Authority (the [[Caribbean Accreditation Authority for Education in Medical and Other Health Professions]]) is established which will be responsible for accrediting doctors and other health care personnel throughout the CSME. The Authority will be headquartered in Jamaica, which is one of among six states (Antigua and Barbuda, Belize, Jamaica, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago) in which agreement is already in force. The Bahamas has also signed on to the Agreement.

Region-wide accreditation has also been planned for vocational skills. Currently local training agencies award National Vocational Qualifications (NVQ)&lt;ref name="Potential and preparation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20051218/lead/lead6.html|title=Jamaica Gleaner News - Potential and preparation - Sunday - December 18, 2005&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or national Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) certification,&lt;ref name="CANTA helping to synchronise Caribbean training standards"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/html/20051022t190000-0500_90846_obs_canta_helping_to_synchronise_caribbean_training_standards.asp|title=CANTA helping to synchronise Caribbean training standards - JAMAICAOBSERVER.COM&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are not valid across Member States. However, in 2003, the Caribbean Association of National Agencies (CANTA) was formed as an umbrella organization of the various local training agencies including Trinidad and Tobago's National Training Agency, the Barbados TVET Council and the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States TVET agency and the HEART Trust/NTA of Jamaica. Since 2005, the member organizations of CANTA have been working together to ensure a uniformed level of certified skilled labour under the Caricom Single Market and Economy (CSME) and CANTA itself has established a regional certification scheme that awards the Caribbean Vocational Qualification (CVQ),&lt;ref name="CANTA helping to synchronise Caribbean training standards" /&gt; which is to replace NVQs and national TVET certifications.&lt;ref name="Potential and preparation" /&gt; The CVQ will be school-based and although based on the certification scheme of CANTA, will be awarded by the Caribbean Examinations Council (CXC) which will be collaborating with CANTA on the CVQ programme.&lt;ref name="New CXC programme in 2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/html/20051029t170000-0500_91362_obs_new_cxc_programme_in_____.asp|title=New CXC programme in 2007 - JAMAICAOBSERVER.COM&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the February 9–10, 2007 meeting of the Regional Coordinating Mechanism for Technical and Vocational Education and Training, officials discussed arrangements for the award of the CVQ which was approved by the Council for Human and Social Development (COHSOD) in October 2006.&lt;ref name="Officials to discuss vocational training"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20070209/news/news4.html|title=Jamaica Gleaner News - Officials to discuss vocational training - Friday - February 9, 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was expected that the CVQ programme may be in place by mid-2007, if all the requirements are met&lt;ref name="Full free movement of Caribbean nationals by the year 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Caricom discusses vocational standards for free movement of skills"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/magazines/business/html/20070213t190000-0500_119067_obs_caricom_discusses_vocational_standards_for_free_movement_of_skills.asp|title=Caricom discusses vocational standards for free movement of skills - JAMAICAOBSERVER.COM&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that provisions were being made for the holders of current NVQs to have them converted into the regionally accepted type (although no clear mandate is yet in place).&lt;ref name="Caricom discusses vocational standards for free movement of skills" /&gt; This deadline was met and in October 2007, the CVQ programme was officially launched. The CVQ now facilitates the movement of artisans and other skilled persons in the CSME. This qualification will be accessible to persons already in the workforce as well as students in secondary schools across the Caribbean region. Those already in the work force will be required to attend designated centres for assessment.&lt;ref name="CVQ launched"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caricom.org/jsp/pressreleases/pres258_07.jsp|title=Launch of the Caribbean Vocational Qualification|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CVQ  is based on a competency-based approach to training, assessment and certification. Candidates are expected to demonstrate competence in attaining occupational standards developed by practitioners, industry experts and employers. Those standards when approved by CARICOM allow for portability across the Region. Currently, CVQs are planned to reflect a Qualification framework of five levels. These are:

* Level 1: Directly Supervised/Entry –Level Worker
* Level 2: Supervised Skilled Worker
* Level 3: Independent or Autonomous Skilled Worker
* Level 4: Specialized or Supervisory Worker
* Level 5: Managerial and/or Professional Worker&lt;ref name="CXC: CVQ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cxc.org/?q=examinations/exams/cvq|title=Caribbean Examinations Council|website=Caribbean Examinations Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CVQ’s are awarded to those candidates who would have met the required standards in all of the prescribed units of study. Statements are issued in cases where candidates did not complete all the requirements for the award of CVQ. Schools that are suitably equipped currently offer Levels 1 &amp; 2.&lt;ref name="CXC: CVQ"/&gt;

By March 2012 up to 2,263 CVQs had been awarded in the workforce across the region and 2,872 had been awarded in schools for a total of 5,135 CVQs awarded up to that time. The breakdown of the agency awarding the over 5,000 CVQs by March 2012 stood at 1,680 having been awarded by the CXC and 3,455 being awarded by the various National Training Agencies (with some being awarded in the workplace and some being awarded in secondary schools).&lt;ref name="CVQ Framework"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soeconferences.com/sites/default/files/PA4%20Caribbean%20Vocational%20Qualifications%20Framework%20-%20Dunn-Smith.pdf|title=Caribbean Vocational Qualifications Framework|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abolition of work permits/permits of stay and the free movement of persons==
{{Seealso|Commonwealth Freedom of Movement Organisation}}
Chapter III of the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas provides for the free movement of skilled Community nationals (article 46) as well as for the free movement of non-wage earners, either as service providers and/or to establish businesses, including managerial, supervisory and technical staff, and their spouses and immediate family members.&lt;ref name="Free Movement in the CSME"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caricom.org/jsp/single_market/skill.jsp?menu=csme|title=Free Movement in the CARICOM Single Market and Economy (CSME)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trade in services and the right of establishment===
Along with the free trade in goods, the Revised Treaty also provides the framework for the establishment of a regime for free trade in services. The main objective is to facilitate trade and investment in the services sectors of CSME Member States through the establishment of economic enterprises. The free trade regime for services grants the following benefits:

{| class="wikitable"
|+Benefits
!Benefit
!Description
|-
|The Right of Establishment
|CARICOM-owned companies will have the right to establish and operate businesses in any CSME member-state under the same terms and conditions as local companies, i.e. without restrictions. Managerial, technical and supervisory staff of these enterprises will be able to enter and work without work permits.
|-
|Region-wide Services
|CARICOM service providers will be able to offer their services throughout the region, again without work permits, usually on a temporary basis, e.g., consultancies.
|}

====Right of establishment====
The right to work as a self-employed person has been provided for in respect of persons wishing to engage in non-wage earning activities of a commercial, industrial, agricultural or artisanal nature.&lt;ref name="CSMEonline - right to establish"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmeonline.org/en/right-to-establish|title=CSME Online Right of Establishment Info|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-Wage Earners are self-employed CARICOM Nationals (juridical as well as natural persons) who have the right to work as self-employed persons in the C.S.M.E. and these persons can move to another Member State to establish a business or to provide a service on temporary basis.&lt;ref name="MFA Guyana - CSME free movement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minfor.gov.gy/tsite/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=41&amp;Itemid=90|title=Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Guyana: CSME - Free Movement of Skills|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such nationals may create and manage economic enterprises, including any type of organization which they own or control (e.g. sole proprietorship, company, etc.) for the production of or trade in goods, or the provision of services.&lt;ref name="CSMEonline - right to establish"/&gt; Service providers may also move to establish businesses under the Companies Act or the Registration of Business Names Act. The procedure in those cases would be the same as those applying to the establishment of business for the provision of goods by a Company.&lt;ref name="Temporary Service Providers Info"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmeonline.org/en/right-to-establish/item/74-temporary-service-provider-info|title=1146 - Error: 1146|website=www.csmeonline.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nationals exercising this right may move to another Member State on a permanent basis.&lt;ref name="CSMEonline - right to establish"/&gt; This category of person is not required to obtain a [[CARICOM Single Market and Economy#Abolition of work permits and the free movement of labour|Free Movement of Skill Certificate]], however Service Providers must obtain a [[CARICOM Single Market and Economy#Temporary provision of services|Certificate of Registration as a CARICOM Service Provider]].&lt;ref name="MFA Guyana - CSME free movement"/&gt;

Affiliated with the right of establishment is the right to move the Technical, Supervisory and Managerial staff of such entities, as well as their spouses and immediate dependent family members. Persons within any of these five (5) named classes are not allowed to move in their own right unless they fall under one of [[CARICOM Single Market and Economy#Abolition of work permits and the free movement of labour|the nine (9) approved categories]] (where the member state recognizes these categories).&lt;ref name="CSMEonline - right to establish"/&gt;

Several procedures have been approved for treatment of persons wishing to establish business enterprises in other member states. These involve:&lt;ref name="CSMEonline - right to establish"/&gt;

* Procedures at Point of Entry whereby Immigration must grant a definite stay of six (6) months, upon the national presenting a valid passport, return ticket and proof of financial resources for personal maintenance.
* Procedures post-entry. This includes the requirement for a migrant CARICOM National to apply to the Competent Authority (usually the Registrar of Companies) of the receiving state, for registration of a business enterprise.

=====Entry procedure at point of entry for right of establishment=====
CARICOM Nationals specifically wishing to move from one Member State to another in exercising the right of establishment will have to present the following at point of entry:&lt;ref name="Entry procedures establishment and services"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caricom.org/jsp/single_market/entry_procedures_establishment_services.pdf|title=Entry Procedures for the Right of Establishment and Provision of Temporary Services|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
* (i) Valid passport; 
* (ii) Return ticket; 
* (iii) Proof of financial resources for personal maintenance, namely credit cards, travelers cheques, cash or combination thereof.

Immigration will then grant the CARICOM National a definite stay of 6 months.&lt;ref name="Entry procedures establishment and services"/&gt;

=====Procedure after entry for right of establishment=====
Each Member State shall designate a Competent Authority for Right of  Establishment. After entry has been granted the CARICOM National must submit to the Competent Authority, relevant proof, such as Police Certificate, Financial Resources, Business Names Certificate / Certificate of Incorporation. The Competent Authority will determine if all requirements to establish the particular business have been satisfied. Once all requirements are satisfied, the Competent Authority will issue a letter of approval to the CARICOM national copied to the Immigration Department. If the business is established within the 6 months period then the CARICOM National must report to the Immigration Department to further regularize his / her stay with the Letter of Approval from the Competent Authority. Immigration will grant the CARICOM National an indefinite stay.&lt;ref name="Entry procedures establishment and services"/&gt;
 
Member States will determine through the national mechanisms which have been established for that purpose, whether the business is operational. If the CARICOM National is no longer operating the business or another business the Competent Authority for Rights of Establishment will inform the Immigration Department, which has the right to rescind the indefinite stay or to indicate to the person 
that he / she needs to apply for a permit of stay and / or a work permit until such time that there is full free movement in the Community.&lt;ref name="Entry procedures establishment and services"/&gt;

=====Extension for right of establishment=====
In the event that the business is not established within the 6-month period, the CARICOM National should present to the Immigration Department or other relevant department so designated by the Member State, evidence from the Competent Authority that concrete steps have been undertaken to establish the business.  Where such evidence is provided, the CARICOM National will be granted an extension 
of 6 months.&lt;ref name="Entry procedures establishment and services"/&gt;

=====Stamps for right of establishment=====
There are specific stamps for the definite entry of 6 months, the extension of 6 months and the indefinite stay with the following text – &lt;ref name="Entry procedures establishment and services"/&gt;

* (i) Right of Establishment – Definite Entry of 6 Months; 
* (ii) Right of Establishment – Extension; and 
* (iii) Right of Establishment – Indefinite Entry.

A CARICOM national whose passport is stamped with one of the above is automatically 
entitled to multiple entry into that Member State.&lt;ref name="Entry procedures establishment and services"/&gt;

=====Integrated Online Registry=====
From 8–10 December 2014, a meeting by Registrars of Companies from the 12 participating CSME member states was held to discuss the development of a complete online registry. The meeting was held in Saint Lucia and was convened by CARICOM Secretariat and funded by  the European Union under the 10th European Development Fund (EDF) as part of the CSME and Economic Integration Programme.&lt;ref name="Regional Company Registrars Consider Integrated Online Registry"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caricom.org/jsp/pressreleases/press_releases_2014/pres271_14.jsp|title=Regional Company Registrars Consider Integrated Online Registry|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Registrars of Companies across the region held the meeting to consider the proposal for the harmonization of online registries in the CSME participating Member States. This harmonization would be facilitated by the web interface and interoperability of the respective systems allowing users access to information from participating Member States. The objective of the initiative is for interested parties to be able to register businesses/companies online across Member States thereby increasing cross-border economic activity. The other issues that are down for discussion are the software and hardware requirements of the systems to be installed as well as training for data entry operators and other relevant users in the registries.&lt;ref name="Regional Company Registrars Consider Integrated Online Registry"/&gt;   
 
The beneficiary Member States under the project are Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, St. Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname and Trinidad and Tobago. Alfa XP Europe Limited is the company undertaking the consultancy.&lt;ref name="Regional Company Registrars Consider Integrated Online Registry"/&gt;

====Temporary provision of services====
While service providers may establish businesses under the right of establishment they may, however, make their services available in other member states using another mode, that is, by moving on a temporary basis.&lt;ref name="Temporary Service Providers Info"/&gt; CARICOM Nationals who wish to move from one CARICOM Member State to another in order to provide such services on a temporary basis are required to register as a service provider in the Member State, where he/she is living and working in order to be issued with a certificate, which will facilitate the entry into another Member State.&lt;ref name="Entry procedures establishment and services"/&gt;  As with the establishment of businesses, there are approved procedures both at points of entry and after entry, regarding treatment of CARICOM nationals wishing to temporarily provide services.&lt;ref name="Temporary Service Providers Info"/&gt;

Critical to this process is the application for and the issuance of a certificate by the Competent Authority within the national’s country, subject to the provision of proof relating to:&lt;ref name="Temporary Service Providers Info"/&gt;

*(a) CARICOM nationality; and
*(b) competency to provide the service, or contract to offer service or letter from relevant association or reputable person or body.

The certificate, the lifetime of which is indefinite, along with a valid passport and the contract to offer service or an invitation letter, must be presented to the Immigration officer at the port of entry, who should then grant the CARICOM National sufficient time to provide the service. A regime has also been approved in respect of the granting of extensions under this regime.&lt;ref name="Temporary Service Providers Info"/&gt;

=====Entry procedure at point of entry for provision of temporary services=====
CARICOM Nationals specifically wishing to move from one Member State to another to provide services on a temporary basis must present their certificate of registration as a CARICOM service provider at the point of entry to the Immigration Officer as proof that the CARICOM National is a service provider who is seeking to enter to provide services on a temporary basis.&lt;ref name="Entry procedures establishment and services"/&gt; 
Other documents required are - &lt;ref name="Entry procedures establishment and services"/&gt; 
* (i) a valid passport; 
*(ii) contract to offer service or invitation letter from a client.
 
The Immigration Officer will grant the CARICOM National sufficient time to provide 
the service.&lt;ref name="Entry procedures establishment and services"/&gt;

=====Procedure for the automatic extension of the stay for provision of temporary services=====
In cases where the temporary service is not completed within the stipulated time period, an automatic extension must be requested from the Immigration Department. The automatic extension will be granted in order to enable the CARICOM National to complete the service once the service provider submits proof that the service is not yet completed.&lt;ref name="Entry procedures establishment and services"/&gt;
 
The automatic extension is based on rights enshrined in the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas, namely non-discrimination (national treatment) and the right to provide a service through mode 4 – the movement of national persons.&lt;ref name="Entry procedures establishment and services"/&gt;

The process to extend the stay should not take longer than ten working days.&lt;ref name="Entry procedures establishment and services"/&gt;

===Abolition of work permits and the free movement of labour===
The Free Movement of Skilled Persons, arises from an agreed CARICOM policy that was originally separate but related to the original Protocol II of the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfabahamas.org/Persaud-Davenport%20Report.htm|title= Implications for the Bahamas of Participation in the CSME|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreed policy, called The Caribbean Community (CARICOM) Free Movement of Persons Act, is now enacted legislation in all the CSME Member States. It provides for the free movement of certain categories of  skilled labour, but according to the policy there is to be eventual free movement of all persons, originally by 2008, but now by 2009.&lt;ref name="Full free movement of Caribbean nationals by the year 2009" /&gt; Under this legislation, persons within these categories can qualify for Skills Certificates (which allow for the free movement across the region).

Since the start of the CSM, eight categories of CARICOM nationals have been eligible for free movement throughout the CSME without the need for work permits. They are: University Graduates, Media Workers, Artistes, Musicians, Sportspersons, Managers, Technical and Supervisory Staff attached to a company and Self-Employed Persons/Service Providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jis.gov.jm/special_sections/caricomnew/applyingForACaricom.html|title=Applying for a CARICOM Skills Certificate|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition the spouses and immediate dependent family members of these nationals will also be exempt from work permit requirements. At the July 2006 CARICOM Summit, it was agreed to allow for free movement of two more categories of skilled persons; tertiary-trained Teachers and Nurses. It was also agreed that higglers, artisans, [[domestic worker]]s and hospitality workers are to be added to the categories of labour allowed free movement at a later date, pending the agreement of an appropriate certification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20060705/lead/lead1.html|title=Teachers and Nurses to have free movement in the CSME|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This envisioned extension for the latter categories of workers such as artisans was achieved in October 2007 with the launch of the Caribbean Vocational Qualification (CVQ).&lt;ref name="CVQ launched"/&gt; In 2009 Antigua and Barbuda was granted a five-year exemption to the extension of free movement to domestic workers, and in 2015 it was seeking the continuation of this exemption for a further 5 years.&lt;ref name="Antigua wants another 5 year exemption"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/latestnews/Antigua-wants-another-stay-on-free-movement-of-domestic-workers|title=Antigua wants another stay on free movement of domestic workers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The freedom to live and work throughout the CSME is granted by the Certificate of Recognition of CARICOM Skills Qualification (commonly called a CARICOM Skills Certificate or just a Skills Certificate). The Skills Certificate essentially replaces work permits and are obtained from the requisite ministry once all the essential documents/qualifications (which varies with each category of skilled persons) are handed in with an application. The issuing ministry varies depending upon the CARICOM Member State. In Antigua and Barbuda, Jamaica and Suriname the Skills Ceritificates are issued by the Ministry of Labour. Grenada, Guyana, St. Lucia and Trinidad and Tobago have Ministries for Caribbean Community Affairs which deal with the Certificates. Meanwhile, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, St. Kitts and Nevis and St. Vincent and the Grenadines issue the Certificates through the Ministries of Immigration. The Skills Certificate can be applied for in either the home or host country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jis.gov.jm/special_sections/caricomnew/jamaicansEncouragedTo.html|title=Jamaicans encouraged to apply for Skills Certificates|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the eighteenth Inter-Sessional CARICOM Heads of Government Conference in February, it was agreed that artisans would not be immediately granted free movement status from January (as was originally envisaged), but would rather be granted free movement by mid-2007. The free movement of artisans will be facilitated through the award of Caribbean Vocational Qualifications (CVQ) based on industrial occupational standards. The conference also agreed that the free movement of domestic workers and hospitality workers could be facilitated in a similar manner to the free movement of artisans and that their cases would be considered after the CVQ model is launched.&lt;ref name="Full free movement of Caribbean nationals by the year 2009" /&gt; The CVQ itself was launched in October 2007, thereby facilitating the free movement of these categories of workers.&lt;ref name="CVQ launched"/&gt;

The Free Movement of Labour is also being facilitated by measures to harmonize social services (health, [[Caribbean Examinations Council|education]], etc.) and providing for [[Caribbean Community#Reciprocal Social Security Agreement|the transfer of social security benefits]] (with the Bahamas also being involved). Regional accreditation will also facilitate the free movement of people/labour.

Although the CARICOM Skills Certificate regime pre-dates the formal inauguration of the CSME (Skills Certificates have been available since 1997, while the CSME was only formally instituted in 2005 following provisional application of the CSME protocols in 2001) the number of Skills Certificates issued to qualifying CARICOM nationals has only really taken off since the CSME was instituted.&lt;ref name="Free Movement working"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caricom.org/jsp/pressreleases/pres159_10.jsp|title=Free Movement working in the CSME - CARICOM Secretary General|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1997 and 2005 only nine Member States had issued certificates of Recognition of Skills on a relatively small scale. Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica and Guyana have issued the bulk of these certificates.&lt;ref name="Caribbean Trade &amp; Investment Report 2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caricom.org/jsp/community/regional_issues/CTIR2005/Chapter%20XII%20CTIR%202005.pdf|title=Caribbean Trade &amp; Investment Report 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By September 2010 approximately 10,000 Skills Certificates had been issued by the 12 member states&lt;ref name="Consultancy on Impact of Free Movement"&gt;[http://www.csmeonline.org/website/images/documents/28/Final%20Report%20Migration%20Study%20CISP%201%205%201%204b%20from%20A-Z%20Information%20Jamaica%20Limited%20-%20September%2020%2020101.pdf A CONSULTANCY TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF FREE MOVEMENT OF PERSONS AND OTHER FORMS OF MIGRATION ON MEMBER STATES]&lt;/ref&gt; with the available data on free movement indicating that more than 6,000 of these skills certificates having been issued between 2006 and 2008.&lt;ref name="Free Movement working"/&gt; At an address to the graduates of the 48th Convocation of the University of Guyana on 8 November 2014,  CARICOM’s Secretary General, Irwin La Rocque, revealed that up to November 2014 a total of 14,000 Skills Certificates had been issued and he urged the graduates to apply for their own Skills Certificates now that they were eligible.&lt;ref name="14,000 Skills Certificates issued"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kaieteurnewsonline.com/2014/11/11/14000-caricom-skills-certificates-issued-says-caricom-secretary-general/|title=14,000 CARICOM Skills Certificates issued – says CARICOM Secretary General|date=11 November 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individually, some countries account for a large percentage of the total Skills Certificates issued. For instance between 1997 and July 2010, Guyana had issued 2,829 skills certificates.&lt;ref name="Guyana issues almost 3,000 Certificates"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kaieteurnewsonline.com/2010/07/17/guyana-issues-almost-3000-free-movement-certificates/|title=Guyana issues almost 3,000 Free Movement certificates|date=17 July 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up to June 2011, Jamaica had issued 2,113 skills certificates.&lt;ref name="Presentation by Ken Baugh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancilleria.gov.co/sites/default/files/pensamiento_estrategico/discursos_funcionarios_visitantes/a.%20Carribbean%20Geopolitics%20-Kenneth%20%20BAUGH%20-%20Premier%20de%20Jamaica.pdf|title=Presentation by Kenneth Baugh  at a Conference on Caribbean Geopolitics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; And as of September 2013, Jamaica had issued 2,893 skills certificates. Data also indicated that the number of verifications and the number of certificates issued by other member states to Jamaicans for 2004 to 2010 amounted to 1,020.&lt;ref name="Jamaican official urges caution on bashing of Caricom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/Jamaican-foreign-ministry-official-urges-caution-on-bashing-of-Caricom_15354375|title=Jamaican foreign ministry official urges caution on bashing of Caricom|first=Jamaica Observer|last=Limited|website=Jamaica Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt; And between 2001 and 2006 Trinidad and Tobago issued 789 Skills Certificates.&lt;ref name="Task Force Report"&gt;[http://www.iadb.org/intal/intalcdi/PE/2009/04051a02.pdf Trinidad and Tobago – Eastern Caribbean States Integration Initiative Task Force Report]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mahabir"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sta.uwi.edu/conferences/salises/documents/Mahabir%20R.pdf|title=Migration of Skilled Personnel in the CSME: The Case of Trinidad &amp; Tobago|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2008, Trinidad and Tobago had issued a total of 1,685 Skills Certificates.&lt;ref name="Belize Chamber of Commerce"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belize.org/bcci/resourcesmodule/download_resource/id/165/src/@random4c745c26deaff/|title=Belize Chamber of Commerce: REVIEW OF THE SCHEDULE OF FREE MOVEMENT OF PERSONS|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey conducted in 2010, found that between 1997 and June 2010 at least an estimated 4,000 persons had moved under the free movement of skills regime. Specialist Movement of Skills/Labour within the CSME Unit, Steven Mc Andrew said “The study proved that persistent fears in member states that they are being flooded under the free movement regime are clearly unfounded.”  He added that another key conclusion was that “free movement has not impacted negatively on the social services in member states. On the contrary it helped to fill critical vacancies in member states with respect to teachers and nurses, thus proving to be very beneficial to maintain a certain level of social services in these countries.”&lt;ref name="Many benefit from free movement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/Study-shows-many-benefit-from-Caricom-free-movement|title=Study: Many benefit from CARICOM free movement|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is expected that by June 2014, all CARICOM nationals will have easier access to participating CSME Member States, and be able to fully exercise their rights to travel, work and seek out other opportunities as provided for under the CARICOM Single Market and Economy (CSME) arrangement.&lt;ref name="Easier Access by June 2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jis.gov.jm/caricom-nationals-should-have-easier-access-by-june-2014/|title=CARICOM Nationals Should have Easier Access by June 2014  - Jamaica Information Service|date=9 October 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is being facilitated through the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA)-funded CARICOM Trade and Competitiveness Project (CTCP), under which a critical electronic database is being established. It will, among other things, provide member countries with aggregated information on the various skill sets available, through a web-based portal being developed by project consultant, A-Z Information Jamaica Limited.&lt;ref name="Easier Access by June 2014"/&gt;

Additionally, the consultant is proposing that the CARICOM National Skills Certificate be standardised across countries, and presented in the form of a stamp in persons’ passports.  This will eliminate the discrepancies in the format of certificates, as well as the need for a physical document and result in ease of processing at the various points of entry across member countries.&lt;ref name="Easier Access by June 2014"/&gt;

Concurrent with (and to some extent pre-dating) the free movement of people is [[Caribbean Community#Hassle Free Travel|the easier facilitation of intra-regional travel]]. This aim is being accomplished by the use of separate Lines identified for CARICOM and Non-CARICOM Nationals at Ports of entry (already in place for all 13 members) and the introduction of a [[Caricom#The CARICOM Common Passport|CARICOM Passport]] and [[Caricom#CARICOM Visa and the Single Domestic Space|Standardized Entry/Departure Forms]].

==Nationality criteria==

In relation to a number of issues such as professional services, residency and land ownership, legislation in the various member states used to discriminate in favour of their individual nationals. This legislation has been amended, as of 2005, to remove the discriminatory provisions. This will allow CARICOM nationals, for example, to be eligible for registration in their respective professions on an equal basis.

However, shortly before signing onto the CSM, the second batch of member states (all in the OECS) negotiated an opt-out agreement with regards to land ownership by non-nationals. As the OECS members of the CSM are all small countries and have limited available land, they are allowed to keep their Alien Land Holding Laws or Alien Landholders Acts (which apply to the ownership of land by non-nationals), but will put in place mechanisms to ensure compliance with the Revised Treaty that will monitor the granting of access to land and the conditions of such access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/caribbean/news/story/2006/06/060629_csmgonzo.shtml|title=BBCCaribbean.com - Kingstown wins single market land deal|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; As it now stands foreign companies or nationals have to seek legal permission to buy land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/cgi-script/csArticles/articles/000005/000501.htm|title=What the business sector should know about the CSM|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; All other laws relating to discrimination in favour of member state nationals only have been amended though. Among the non-OECS members of the CSM, there are no restrictions on private land ownership by CARICOM nationals (although in Suriname, and possibly in the other members as well, restrictions still apply with regards to state-owned land&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/2006/01/10/land.shtml|title=No state-owned land in Suriname for CARICOM nationals|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Harmonization of legislation==

The Revised Treaty also calls for harmonized regimes in a number of areas: Anti-dumping and countervailing measures, Banking and securities, Commercial arbitration, Competition policy, Consumer protection, Customs, Intellectual property rights, Regulation and labelling of food and drugs, Sanitary and phytosanitary measures, Standards and technical regulations &amp; Subsidies.

Draft model legislation is being developed by a CARICOM Legislative Drafting Facility in collaboration with the Chief Parliamentary Counsels of the region

==Free movement of capital==

The free movement of capital involves the elimination of the various restrictions such as [[foreign exchange controls]] and allowing for the convertibility of currencies (already in effect) or a single currency and capital market integration via a regional stock exchange. The member states have also signed and ratified an Intra-Regional [[Double taxation|Double Taxation]] [[Tax treaty|Agreement]].

==Single currency==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Caribbean Community]] --&gt;

Although not expected until between 2010 and 2015,&lt;ref name="Towards a Single Economy and a Single
Development Vision" /&gt; it is intended that the CSME will have a single currency. As it stands a number of the CSME members are already in a [[currency union]] with the [[Eastern Caribbean dollar]] and the strength of most regional currencies (with the exception of Jamaica's and Guyana's) should make any future exchange-rate harmonization between CSME members fairly straightforward as a step towards a monetary union.

The aim of forming a CARICOM monetary union is not new. As a precursor to this idea the various CARICOM countries established a compensation procedure to favour the use of the member states currencies. The procedure was aimed at ensuring monetary stability and promoting trade development. This monetary compensation scheme was at first bilateral, but this system was limited and unwieldy because each member state had to have a separate account for each of its CARICOM trade partners and the accounts had to be individually balanced at the end of each credit period. The system became multilateral in 1977 and was called the [[CARICOM Multilateral Clearing Facility]] (CMCF). The CMCF was supposed to favour the use of internal CARICOM currencies for transaction settlement and to promote banking cooperation and monetary cooperation between member states. Each country was allowed a fixed credit line and initially the CMCF was successful enough that both the total credit line and the credit period were extended by 1982. However, the CMCF failed shortly thereafter in the early 1980s due to Guyana's inability to settle its debts and Barbados being unable to grant new payment terms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sta.uwi.edu/salises/workshop/csme/paper/omanioc.pdf|title=404 Error - Page not found|website=sta.uwi.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the failure of the CMCF, in 1992 the [[CARICOM Heads of Government]] determined that CARICOM should move towards monetary integration and commissioned their central bankers to study the possible creation of a monetary union among CARICOM countries. It was argued that monetary integration would provide benefits such as exchange rate and price stability and reduced transaction costs in regional trade. It was also thought that these benefits in turn would stimulate capital flows, intra-regional trade and investment, improve balance of payments performance and increase growth and employment.

The Central Bank Governors produced a report in March 1992 that outlined the necessary steps and criteria for a monetary union by 2000. The 1992 criteria were amended in 1996 and were known as the 3-12-36-15 criteria. They required that:
* countries maintain foreign reserves equivalent to 3 months of import cover or 80% of central bank current liabilities (whichever was greater) for 12 months;
*the exchange rate be maintained at a fixed rate to the [[US dollar]] (for [[Fixed exchange rate|Fixers]]) or within a band of 1.5% on either side of parity (for [[Floating exchange rate|Floaters]]) for 36 consecutive months without external debt payment arrears and;
*the [[debt service ratio]] to be maintained within 15% of the export of goods and services.

The report envisioned the fulfilment of a monetary union in 3 phases on the basis of grouping the member states into 2 categories, A and B. Category A included the Bahamas, Belize and [[OECS]] states.  Category A countries had already met the original criteria in 1992 and only had to maintain economic stability to begin the monetary union. Category B consisted of Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago (Suriname and Haiti were not yet members and so were not included). These countries had to make the necessary adjustments to meet the entry criteria.

Phase 1 of the monetary union process was scheduled to conclude in 1996. It was to include the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, the OECS states and Trinidad and Tobago and there was to have been a common currency as a unit of account (cf. the [[Euro]] from 1999–2002) amongst these states with the exception of the Bahamas and Belize. This phase would also involve the coordination of monetary policies and the movement towards intra-regional currency convertibility among all member states. Phase 1 would also have seen the formation of a Council of CARICOM Central Bank Governors to oversee the entire process.

Phase 2 was to have occurred between 1997 and 2000 and should have seen a number of initiatives:
*the formation of a [[Caribbean Monetary Authority]] (CMA), which would be accountable to a Council of Ministers of Finance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caricom.org/jsp/communications/communiques/13hgc_1992_communique.jsp|title=Communique Issued at the conclusion of the Thirteenth CARICOM Heads of Government Conference, 1992|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*the issuance and circulation of a physical common currency in all Phase 1 countries except the Bahamas.
*the use of the new currency in the other countries (the Bahamas, Guyana and Jamaica) as a unit of account in settling regional transactions.
*the continued efforts by Guyana and Jamaica to meet the criteria for entry into the monetary union if they had not already done so and achieved economic stability.

Phase 3 was planned to begin in 2000 and had as its ultimate goal to have all CARICOM countries entering into the monetary union and membership of the CMA.

However, the implementation of Phase 1  was put on hold in 1993 as a result of Trinidad and Tobago floating its [[Trinidad and Tobago dollar|dollar]]. In response and in an effort to continue pursuing monetary cooperation and integration, CARICOM Central Bank Governors made their regional currencies fully inter-convertible. A subsequent proposal called for Barbados, Belize and the OECS states to form a currency union by 1997 but this also failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caribank.org/uploads/publications-reports/staff-papers/EXCHANGE%20RATE%20CONVERGENCE%20IN%20CARICOM.pdf|title=Exchange Rate Convergence in CARICOM|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==CARICOM Development Fund==

One of the institutions and regimes created to give life to the regional integration movement through the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas, is the CARICOM Development Fund (CDF). It forms a critical part of the community's aim for equitable engagement among its member states. The idea for the CDF was borrowed substantially from a similar mechanism successfully employed the European Union&lt;ref name="CDF another brick"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caricom.org/jsp/pressreleases/pres422_09.jsp|title=The Caribbean Development Fund: Another Brick in the building of the Caribbean Community|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the EU's [[Cohesion Fund]])&lt;ref name="CDF Vital"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jis.gov.jm/caricom-development-fund-vital-aspect-of-csme/|title=CARICOM Development Fund: Vital Aspect of CSME - Jamaica Information Service|date=7 December 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in helping bring certain of its member states, such as Ireland, up to a certain economic level to assist them in effectively participating and benefiting from the integration process.&lt;ref name="CDF another brick"/&gt;

The CDF was established under Article 158 of the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas “for the purpose of providing financial or technical assistance to disadvantaged countries, regions and sectors.” It is the centre-piece of a regime to address the disparities among the Member States of the Community which may result from the implementation of the CSME. The signing of the Agreement Relating to the Operations of the Fund in July 2008, followed years of negotiations by CARICOM Member States regarding the principles, size and structure of a regional development fund.&lt;ref name="CDF another brick"/&gt;

There was a sense of achievement when the agreement was finally signed and technicians employed by the CDF got down to the task of making the mechanism operational. In an interview, CDF Chief Executive Officer Ambassador Lorne McDonnough said “The CDF start-up team was always confident it would meet the projected launch date....” Despite this confidence he admitted that “...along the way there were always the glitches and frustrating delays that called for an extra dose of perseverance as well as the need to step back and revisit the problem with a fresh resolve”. Ambassador McDonnough noted that heightened expectations and the desire to see the CDF operational in the shortest possible time, meant that Member States sometimes underestimated the work which had to be done to make the CDF ready for full operations.&lt;ref name="CDF another brick"/&gt;

Notwithstanding all the challenges, on 24 August 2009, in keeping with expectations, the CDF officially opened its doors. This was achieved after nine months of feverish effort by the start-up staff to put systems in place to allow for the receipt of requests for loans and grants.&lt;ref name="CDF another brick"/&gt;

The CDF has 12 members: Antigua &amp; Barbuda, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Saint Lucia, Saint Kitts &amp; Nevis, Saint Vincent &amp; the Grenadines, Suriname and Trinidad &amp; Tobago.&lt;ref name="CDF.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caricomdevelopmentfund.org/website/|title=CARICOM Development Fund website|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===CDF governance===

The CDF, as established in the agreement, has its own legal identity but is linked to CARICOM through several Ministerial Councils. The CDF is governed by its own corporate board and is managed by the CEO. Ambassador McDonnough assumed the post of CEO in November 2008 joining Ms. Fay Housty, Senior Advisor, Corporate Governance and Development and Mr. Lenox Forte, Manager, Corporate Development and Programming. These two officers were seconded from the CARICOM Secretariat.&lt;ref name="CDF another brick"/&gt;

The CDF began its existence from three temporary offices within CARICOM’s CSME Unit in the Tom Adams Financial Centre, Bridgetown, Barbados. The team spent the first three months looking for alternative office space, preparing the work plan and budget, seeking funding for the preparation of its governance rules and procedures in addition to beginning the process of recruiting the core executive and administrative staff.&lt;ref name="CDF another brick"/&gt;

The CDF moved into its current temporary office in the renovated Old Town Hall Building in Bridgetown at the end of January 2009. This space was provided by the Government of Barbados as the CDF continued to work with it on acquiring its more permanent premises by middle of 2010.&lt;ref name="CDF another brick"/&gt; The new permanent facilities for the CDF were located in a new building located at Mall Internationale, Haggatt Hall, St. Michael, Barbados. This building also housed the new permanent offices of two departments of the CARICOM Secretariat - the Office of Trade Negotiations (OTN) and the CSME Unit.&lt;ref name="New CARICOM building opens"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barbadosadvocate.com/newsitem.asp?more=loca..&amp;NewsID=28296|title=Barbados Advocate: New CARICOM building opens|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new offices were officially opened on Monday, December 3, 2012 by the Prime Minister of Barbados, Freundel Stuart.&lt;ref name="new home for CARICOM offices"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caricom.org/jsp/pressreleases/press_releases_2012/pres334_12.jsp|title=New Home for CARICOM Offices in Barbados|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Capitalisation ===

All member states are required to contribute to the capital of the fund on the basis of a formula agreed on by the CARICOM heads of government. In 2009 the CDF was capitalised at US$79.9 million. It was envisaged that by the end of the 2009 member states would have contributed approximately US$87 million. The CDF also has the remit to raise a further US$130 million from donors and friendly states.&lt;ref name="CDF another brick"/&gt;

The CDF also benefited in 2009 from technical assistance grants of US$149,000 from the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) and €834,000 from the European Union (EU) Institutional Support Facility in addition to a 2009 contribution of €300,000 signalling the start of a closer relationship between the Government of Finland and CARICOM. The Government of Turkey also provided support to the countries of the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) to assist them in making their contribution to the CDF’s capital fund.&lt;ref name="CDF another brick"/&gt;

By 2011 the CDF was capitalised at US$100.7 million, with the total funds increasing to US$107 million by 2012.&lt;ref name="CDF Annual Report 2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caricomdevelopmentfund.org/website/images/stories/documents/cdf_annual_report_2012.pdf|title=CDF Annual Report 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a meeting of a CDF team with the member states' Technical Working Group (TWG), Ambassador McDonnough made recommendation on the replenishment of the CDF during the Second Funding Cycle. These recommendations were accepted by the CARICOM Conference of Heads of Government in May 2015, it was confirmed that CARICOM member states will provide US$65.84 million in new funding for the CDF in its Second Funding Cycle, due to commence on 1 July 2015. This amount will also be supplemented by US$10.2 million of carry-over funds, bringing a total of US$76 million for the Second Funding Cycle. Trinidad and Tobago, the largest contributor, confirmed that it was providing US$40 million to the CDF.&lt;ref name="CARICOM commits US$65m"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/business/CARICOM-to-commit-US-65-million-to-CDF_18971392|title=CARICOM to commit US$65 million to CDF|first=Jamaica Observer|last=Limited|website=Jamaica Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the governments of Haiti and Montserrat expressed their desire to become members of the CDF during its Second Funding Cycle.&lt;ref name="CARICOM commits US$65m"/&gt;

===Beneficiaries ===

Whilst all members of the CSME contributing to the CDF are eligible to receive financial and technical assistance support from the fund, only the designated disadvantaged countries - the LDCs (OECS and Belize) and Guyana (as a Highly Indebted Poor Country) will have access to resources during the first contribution cycle&lt;ref name="CDF another brick"/&gt; which runs from 2008 to 2014.&lt;ref name="SELA: CDF Perspective"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sela.org/attach/258/EDOCS/SRed/2013/07/T023600005193-0-REGIONAL_COOPERATION_IN_THE_AREA_OF_BORDER_INTEGRATION__The_Perspective_of_the_CARICOM_Development_Fund.pdf|title=Regional Co-operation in the Area of Border Integration: A Perspective from the CARICOM Development Fund|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To identify the needs of the eligible member states and to inform the CDF Board as it signed off on governance rules and regulations, needs assessment consultations were undertaken to the LDCs and Guyana.&lt;ref name="CDF another brick"/&gt;

Informed by these consultations and consistent with its remit to address disparities resulting from the implementation of the CSME, the CDF will focus on disbursing concessionary loans and grants that address objectives related to the implementation of the CSME, preferably small-to-medium size projects of a short implementation period. The details of the criteria for project selection can be found in the CDF Appraisal and Disbursement guidelines on www.csmeonline.org .&lt;ref name="CDF another brick"/&gt;

In an attempt to guarantee the sustainability of the CDF capital fund, the size of direct loans will range between US$500,000 and US$4 million; the minimum size of grants will be US$20,000. In each contribution cycle, the board will earmark up to US$10 million to finance private sector projects that are regional or sub-regional in scope. The CDF will also look to work with its development partners in leveraging the technical assistance it can provide.&lt;ref name="CDF another brick"/&gt;

==Regional Integration Electronic Public Procurement System==

Article 239 of the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas obliges Member States to “elaborate a Protocol relating... to... Government Procurement.”&lt;ref name="regional integration of public procurement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ricg.org/download.php?len=en&amp;id=31&amp;nbre=Sharlene%20Shillingford.pptx&amp;ti=application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.pres&amp;tc=Contenidos|title=Regional integration of Public procurement in the Caribbean|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RTC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caricom.org/jsp/community/revised_treaty-text.pdf|title=Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To date, the Community has undertaken and concluded a significant volume of work regarding the establishment of a Community Regime for Public Procurement.  A project was commissioned in 2003 by the CARICOM Secretariat with a grant from the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA). The object of the project was to support CARICOM in its efforts to establish an effective regional regime for Public Procurement which would facilitate the full implementation of the CSME and to participate effectively in external trade negotiations relating to Public Procurement.  The project comprised three main components.  Component 1 – National Government Procurement Frameworks: Analysis, Comparison and Recommended Improvements; Component 2 – Collection and Analysis of Government Procurement Statistics; and Component 3 – Recommendations for a Regional Best-practice Regime for Government Procurement.&lt;ref name="CSME and Procurement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://roselawcaribbean.com/csme-procurement/|title=CSME and Procurement|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Altogether, the outputs of the project informed the preparation of the first draft of the Framework Regional Integration Policy on Public Procurement (FRIP).&lt;ref name="regional integration of public procurement"/&gt; The First Draft of the Community Policy on Public Procurement was developed and disseminated to Member States for review in 2005. By April 2006 the Second Draft was finalized.&lt;ref name="CSME and Procurement"/&gt;  In 2011, the Fourth Draft, which reflects the recommended amendments to the Third Draft, was adopted.&lt;ref name="regional integration of public procurement"/&gt; The proposed policy now called the Framework for Regional Integration of Public Procurement (FRIPP) is in its fifth draft stage.&lt;ref name="CSME and Procurement"/&gt;

Among the findings of the 2003 project were that:&lt;ref name="CSME and Procurement"/&gt;

*competitive public procurement regimes in the CARICOM Member States are in a disarray and dysfunctional; Public Procurement accounts for a significant percentage of public expenditure
*the current legislation governing procurement in CARICOM Member States is made up of poorly coordinated and outdated enactments, regulations and decrees
*the weakness of legislation and/or their enforcement breeds many abusive and manipulative practices in public procurement
*enforcement of procurement rules is extremely weak and sometimes non-existent due to the absence of a single regulatory authority
*the rights of bidders are not adequately protected; capacity to conduct procurement is extremely weak
*Public Procurement is severely under-developed and rated as high risk
*internal and external procurement controls are inadequate
*procurement related corruption is a major problem
*due to the small size of individual economies, the private sector actively seeks public procurement opportunities, albeit with little or no confidence in the integrity of the public procurement system

The general conclusion was that the present procurement regimes are counter productive towards the efforts of CSME. The dismal picture painted by the findings of the CARICOM research project demonstrated the dire need for comprehensive procurement reform. One of the significant recommendations of the project was that the proposed regional and domestic public procurement legislative and policy reforms should be based on the UNCITRAL Model Law.&lt;ref name="CSME and Procurement"/&gt;

Between April and June 2014, a consultancy conducted by Analysis Mason Ltd. was conducted in 13 Caricom countries (excepting Haiti and the Bahamas)&lt;ref name="CARICOM kicks off govt procurement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caricom.org/jsp/pressreleases/press_releases_2014/pres207_14.jsp|title=CARICOM Kicks Off Government Procurement Consultations |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and provided the CARICOM Secretariat and its Member States with the recommendations on the required Information Technology (IT) infrastructure for the establishment of a fully functioning Regional Integration Electronic Public Procurement System (RIEPPS).&lt;ref name="govt contracts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestkittsnevisobserver.com/2014/09/05/govt-contracts.html|title=New System To Allow Regional Bidding For Gov’t Contracts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new IT-based system is being proposed whereby businesses in Caricom countries can bid on government contracts in member states. The proposed regionally integrated Government Procurement system would bring further life to the CSME single market component, allowing for an effective means for businesses of CARICOM member states to operate in each other’s countries. The arrangement is being structured in such manner as to allow certain contracts to be retained for national businesses, while others are open to regional bidding processes.&lt;ref name="govt contracts"/&gt;

The work plan calls for a common regional IT infrastructure, supported by legislative protocols and a business development component that would help to stimulate the intra-regional procurement activities. All of these components are being undertaken simultaneously with a view towards achieving possible implementation by the end of 2014&lt;ref name="govt contracts"/&gt; but certainly by 2016.&lt;ref name="benefit from regional procurement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/Jamaica-to-benefit-from-regional-procurement-system_17478311|title=Jamaica to benefit from regional procurement system|first=Jamaica Observer|last=Limited|website=Jamaica Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The estimated market for regional procurement is approximately US$17 billion annually among the region of five and a half million people (with the exception of Haiti). The government is one of the biggest single sectors in every economy in Caricom, so one of the possible solutions to the aim of boosting intra-regional trade, and for each country to generate business and create employment, is to open the market for government procurement.&lt;ref name="benefit from regional procurement"/&gt;

A reform of the procurement systems and processes in every country where the project is to be implemented will also be undertaken, as well as the installation of relevant IT hardware and software and the training of required personnel. One of the important hurdles to be overcome for full implementation of the programme will be the need to ensure that every country has legislation that allows transactions of this type to be done electronically.

“Many states up to this point still operate with Finance and Administration Acts, rather than a procurement law. Several of them do have an Electronic Transactions Act, but it may not speak specifically to procurement in the public domain. So, one of the things that CARICOM will be responsible for doing under the project is to prepare the protocol and the supporting implementing law and rules,” explained Ivor Carryl, Programme Manager, Caricom Single Market and Economy, CARICOM Secretariat.&lt;ref name="JIS regional procurement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jis.gov.jm/regional-procurement-system-established/|title=Regional Procurement System To Be Established - Jamaica Information Service|date=4 September 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the CARICOM Regional Integration Electronic Public Procurement System, traders of goods and services will have protection from the Caribbean Court of Justice (CCJ).&lt;ref name="CCJ and public procurement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jis.gov.jm/ccj-provide-protection-new-procurement-regime/|title=CCJ to Provide Protection Under New Procurement Regime - Jamaica Information Service|date=1 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ivor Carryl, a Regional public procurement notice board will be created for member states to post their contracts, and where any player feels that unfairness is involved in the award of the contracts, the CCJ can be called on to adjudicate.&lt;ref name="CCJ and public procurement"/&gt;

“In Article 7, which deals with non-discriminatory, equal treatment and fairness, all of your domestic laws and practices relating to CARICOM, must mirror those provisions,” Carryl told JIS News in an interview.&lt;ref name="CCJ and public procurement"/&gt;

“If a Jamaican company under the protocol submits a bid, and for some reason he feels aggrieved that the process (the tender evaluation) didn’t go right, he would have the right under the Treaty to challenge the procuring entity, and ask them to explain why he did not win the bid; and he has the right to go to court and challenge the decision,” the CARICOM official added.&lt;ref name="CCJ and public procurement"/&gt;

Mr. Carryl explains that under the Regional Procurement Regime, the appeal mechanism has been strengthened, so persons will have easier access in seeking redress.&lt;ref name="CCJ and public procurement"/&gt;

==Single Jurisdiction for Companies==

In August 2014, CARICOM initiated work towards creating a harmonized framework for companies and other businesses can be established and operate within the CSME. This Single Jurisdiction should ensure that the rules for establishing and operating a business in one country apply throughout the CSME.&lt;ref name="CARICOM Moves to Harmonize Business Rules in CSME"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caricom.org/jsp/pressreleases/press_releases_2014/pres205_14.jsp|title=CARICOM Moves to Harmonize Business Rules in CSME|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in June 2015, the CARICOM Secretariat began a series of national consultations to discuss the Draft Framework Policy on the Single Jurisdiction.  The aim of the Single Jurisdiction is to create a seamless space for companies can conduct business. When established it would enable businesses, once registered in one participating member state of the CSME, to operate in any other CSME member state without needing to register in that other member state. Thus in essence it will allow businesses to register anywhere within the CSME and operate throughout the Single Market. The creation of the Single Jurisdiction is seen to be crucial to allow for the proper implementation of the Right Establishment under the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas and should be of significant benefit to those exercising this right.&lt;ref name="CARICOM Convenes National Consultations on Single Jurisdiction for Companies"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caricom.org/jsp/pressreleases/press_releases_2015/pres95_15.jsp|title=CARICOM Convenes National Consultations on Single Jurisdiction for Companies|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Catharsis''' (from Greek {{lang|el|[[wikt:κάθαρσις|κάθαρσις]]}} {{transl|el|''katharsis''}} meaning "purification" or "cleansing") is the purification and purgation of emotions—particularly pity and fear—through art&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eKNK1YwHcQ4C&amp;pg=PA217 |title=catharsis |encyclopedia=Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of Literature |publisher=Merriam-Webster |year=1995 |page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; or any extreme change in emotion that results in renewal and restoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l2XgAAAAMAAJ&amp;q= | last = Berndtson | first = Arthur | title = Art, Expression, and Beauty | publisher = Krieger | year = 1975 | page = 235|isbn=9780882752174 | quote=The theory of catharsis has a disarming affinity with the expressional theory, since it emphasizes emotion, asserts a change in emotion as a result of aesthetic operations, and concludes on a note of freedom in relation to the emotion}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PvZYaJmH6LcC&amp;dq= | title=Looking for an Argument: Critical Encounters with the New Approaches to the Criticism of Shakespeare and His Contemporaries | first=Richard | last=Levin |year=2003 | page=42 | quote=Catharsis in Shakespearean tragedy involves ... some kind of restoration of order and a renewal or enhancement of our positive feelings for the hero.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a metaphor originally used by [[Aristotle]] in the ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]],'' comparing the effects of [[tragedy]] on the mind of a spectator to the effect of a [[cathartic]] on the body.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0056%3Asection%3D1449b 1449b]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/99492/catharsis |title=catharsis (criticism) |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dramatic uses==
Catharsis is a term in [[drama|dramatic art]] that describes the effect of tragedy (or [[comedy]] and quite possibly other artistic forms)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Catharsis in Healing, Ritual, and Drama | first=Thomas J. | last = Scheff | authorlink=Thomas J. Scheff | isbn=0-595-15237-6|publisher=University of California Press | year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; principally on the audience (although some have speculated on characters in the drama as well). Nowhere does [[Aristotle]] explain the meaning of "catharsis" as he is using that term in the definition of tragedy in the ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (1449b21-28). G.&amp;nbsp;F. Else argues that traditional, widely held interpretations of catharsis as "purification" or "purgation" have no basis in the text of the ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', but are derived from the use of catharsis in other Aristotelian and non-Aristotelian contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Catharsis | journal = Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association | first = Leon | last = Golden | volume = 93 | pages = 51–60 | jstor = 283751 | doi = 10.2307/283751}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, a number of diverse interpretations of the meaning of this term have arisen. The term is often discussed along with Aristotle's concept of [[anagnorisis]].

D.&amp;nbsp;W. Lucas, in an authoritative edition of the ''Poetics'', comprehensively covers the various nuances inherent in the meaning of the term in an Appendix devoted to "Pity, Fear, and Katharsis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Aristotle: Poetics|last=Lucas|first=D. W.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1977|isbn=978-0198140245|pages=276–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucas recognizes the possibility of catharsis bearing some aspect of the meaning of "purification, purgation, and 'intellectual clarification'" although his discussion of these terms is not always, or perhaps often, in the precise form with which other influential scholars have treated them. Lucas himself does not accept any one of these interpretations as his own but adopts a rather different one based on "the Greek doctrine of Humours" which has not received wide subsequent acceptance. Purgation and purification, used in previous centuries, as the common interpretations of catharsis are still in wide use today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Catharsis in Psychotherapy | first1=Michael P. | last1=Nichols | first2=Melvin | last2=Zax |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc, New York|year=1977|isbn=978-0470990643}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, in the twentieth century, the interpretation of catharsis as "intellectual clarification" has arisen as a rival to the older views in describing the effect of catharsis on members of the audience.

===Purgation and purification===
In his works prior to the ''Poetics,'' Aristotle had used the term ''catharsis'' purely in its medical sense (usually referring to the evacuation of the ''katamenia''—the [[menstrual]] fluid or other reproductive material).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Belifiore | first = Elizabeth S. | title = Tragic Pleasures: Aristotle on Plot and Emotion | page = 300 | publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, however, he employs it as a medical [[metaphor]].
[[F. L. Lucas]] maintains, therefore, that ''purification'' and ''cleansing'' are not proper translations for ''catharsis''; that it should rather be rendered as ''[[Purgatory|purgation]]''. "It is the human soul that is purged of its excessive passions."&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L. ''Tragedy in Relation to Aristotle's Poetics'', p.&amp;nbsp;24&lt;/ref&gt; Gerald F. Else made the following argument against the "purgation" theory: "It presupposes that we come to the tragic drama (unconsciously, if you will) as patients to be cured, relieved, restored to psychic health. But there is not a word to support this in the "Poetics", not a hint that the end of drama is to cure or alleviate pathological states. On the contrary it is evident in every line of the work that Aristotle is presupposing 'normal' auditors, normal states of mind and feeling, normal emotional and aesthetic experience."&lt;ref&gt;Else, Gerald F. ''Aristotle's Poetics: The Argument'', p. 440. Cambridge, Massachusetts (1957)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]] sidesteps the medical attribution. He translates ''catharsis'' as a purification, an experience that brings pity and fear into their proper balance: "In real life", he explained, "men are sometimes too much addicted to pity or fear, sometimes too little; tragedy brings them back to a virtuous and happy mean."&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L. ''Tragedy in Relation to Aristotle's Poetics'', p.&amp;nbsp;23. Hogarth, 1928&lt;/ref&gt;
Tragedy is then a corrective; through watching tragedy, the audience learns how to feel these emotions at proper levels.

===Intellectual clarification===
In the twentieth century a paradigm shift took place in the interpretation of catharsis with a number of scholars contributing to the argument in support of the intellectual clarification concept.&lt;ref&gt;The following works can be usefully consulted in this regard: L. Golden, "Aristotle on Tragic and Comic Mimesis," Atlanta, 1992; S. Halliwell, "Aristotle's Poetics," London, 1986; D. Keesey, "On Some Recent Interpretations of Catharsis, "The Classical World", (1979) 72.4, 193–205.&lt;/ref&gt; The clarification theory of catharsis would be fully consistent, as other interpretations are not, with Aristotle's argument in chapter 4 of the ''Poetics'' (1448b4-17) that the essential pleasure of [[mimesis]] is the intellectual pleasure of "learning and inference".

It is generally understood that Aristotle's theory of mimesis and catharsis are responses to [[Plato]]'s negative view of artistic mimesis on an audience. Plato argued that the most common forms of artistic mimesis were designed to evoke from an audience powerful emotions such as pity, fear, and ridicule which override the rational control that defines the highest level of our humanity and lead us to wallow unacceptably in the overindulgence of emotion and passion. Aristotle's concept of catharsis, in all of the major senses attributed to it, contradicts Plato's view by providing a mechanism that generates the rational control of irrational emotions. All of the commonly held interpretations of catharsis, purgation, purification, and clarification are considered by most scholars to represent a homeopathic process in which pity and fear accomplish the catharsis of emotions like themselves. For an alternate view of catharsis as an [[Allopathic medicine|allopathic]] process in which pity and fear produce a catharsis of emotions unlike pity and fear, see E. Belfiore, ''Tragic Pleasures: Aristotle on Plot and Emotion.'' Princeton, 1992, 260 ff.

===Literary analysis of catharsis===
The following analysis by [[E. R. Dodds]], directed at the character of [[Oedipus]] in the paradigmatic Aristotelian tragedy, ''[[Oedipus Rex]],'' incorporates all three of the aforementioned interpretations of catharsis: purgation, purification, intellectual clarification:{{quote|...what fascinates us is the spectacle of a man freely choosing, from the highest motives a series of actions which lead to his own ruin. Oedipus might have left the plague to take its course; but pity for the sufferings of his people compelled him to consult Delphi. When Apollo's word came back, he might still have left the murder of Laius uninvestigated; but piety and justice required him to act. He need not have forced the truth from the reluctant Theban herdsman; but because he cannot rest content with a lie, he must tear away the last veil from the illusion in which he has lived so long. Teiresias, Jocasta, the herdsman, each in turn tries to stop him, but in vain; he must read the last riddle, the riddle of his own life. The immediate cause of Oedipus' ruin is not "fate or "the gods"—no oracle said that he must discover the truth—and still less does it lie in his own weakness; what causes his ruin is his own strength and courage, his loyalty to Thebes, and his loyalty to the truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first=E. R. | last=Dodds | authorlink=E. R. Dodds | title=On Misunderstanding the 'Oedipus Rex' | journal=Greece and Rome |volume=13 |issue=1 |year=1966 |pages=37–49 |jstor=642354 | doi=10.1017/s0017383500016144}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Attempts to subvert catharsis===
There have been, for political or aesthetic reasons, deliberate attempts made to subvert the effect of catharsis in theatre.
For example, [[Bertolt Brecht]] viewed catharsis as a pap (pabulum) for the [[bourgeois]] theatre audience, and designed dramas which left significant emotions unresolved, intending to force social action upon the audience. Brecht then identified the concept of catharsis with the notion of identification of the spectator, meaning a complete adhesion of the viewer to the dramatic actions and characters. Brecht reasoned that the absence of a cathartic resolution would require the audience to take political action in the real world, in order to fill the emotional gap they had experienced vicariously. This technique can be seen as early as his [[agit-prop]] play ''[[The Measures Taken]],'' and is mostly the source of his invention of an ''epic theatre'', based on a [[distancing effect]] (Verfremdungseffekt) between the viewer and the representation or portrayal of characters.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht, Bertold]], "La dramaturgie non aristotélicienne", ''Théâtre épique, théâtre dialectique'', éd. Jean-Marie Valentin, Paris, Éditions de L'Arche, 1999, pp. 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

=="Catharsis" before tragedy==
Catharsis before the sixth-century rise of tragedy is, for the [[Western World]], essentially a historical footnote to the Aristotelian conception. The practice of [[Ritual purification|purification]] had not yet appeared in [[Homer]], as later Greek commentators noted:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Walter | last = Burkert | authorlink = Walter Burkert | year = 1992 | title = The Orientalizing Revolution: Near Eastern Influence on Greek Culture in the Early Archaic Age | page = 56 | publisher = Harvard University Press | ref=harv}} This sub-section depends largely on Burkert.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Aithiopis]]'', an [[epic (poetry)|epic]] set in the [[Epic Cycle|Trojan War cycle]], narrates the purification of [[Achilles]] after his murder of [[Thersites]]. Catharsis describes the result of measures taken to cleanse away blood-guilt—"blood is purified through blood",{{sfnp|Burkert|1992|p=56}} a process in the development of [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] culture in which the [[Delphi|oracle of Delphi]] took a prominent role. The classic example—[[Orestes]]—belongs to tragedy, but the procedure given by [[Aeschylus]] is ancient: the blood of a sacrificed piglet is allowed to wash over the blood-polluted man, and running water washes away the blood.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert notes parallels with a bilingual [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]-[[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] ritual text: "the knowledgeable specialist, the sacrificial piglet, slaughter, contact with blood, and the subsequent cleansing with water" {{harvtxt|Burkert|1992|page=58}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The identical ritual is represented, Burkert informs us, on a ''[[krater]]'' found at Canicattini, wherein it is shown being employed to cure the daughters of [[Proetus]] from their madness, caused by some ritual transgression.{{sfnp|Burkert|1992|p=57}} To the question of whether the ritual obtains [[atonement (penal substitution view)|atonement]] for the subject, or just [[healing]], Burkert answers: "To raise the question is to see the irrelevance of this distinction".{{sfnp|Burkert|1992|p=57}}

==Therapeutic uses==&lt;!-- 'Cathartic method' redirects here --&gt;
In [[psychology]], the term was first employed by [[Sigmund Freud]]'s colleague [[Josef Breuer]] (1842–1925), who developed a '''cathartic method'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; of treatment using [[hypnosis]] for persons suffering from intensive [[hysteria]]. While under hypnosis, Breuer's patients were able to recall [[psychological trauma|traumatic]] experiences, and through the process of expressing the original emotions that had been repressed and forgotten, they were relieved of their hysteric symptoms. Catharsis was also central to Freud's concept of [[psychoanalysis]], but he replaced hypnosis with [[Free association (psychology)|free association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Strickland | editor-first=Bonnie | editor-link=Bonnie Strickland | title=Catharsis | publisher=Gale | year=2001 | url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''[[cathexis|catharsis]]'' has also been adopted by modern [[psychotherapy]], particularly Freudian psychoanalysis, to describe the act of expressing, or more accurately, ''experiencing'' the deep emotions often associated with events in the individual's past which had originally been repressed or ignored, and had never been adequately addressed or experienced.

There has been much debate about the use of catharsis in the reduction of anger. Some scholars believe that "blowing off steam" may reduce physiological stress in the short term, but this reduction may act as a reward mechanism, reinforcing the behavior and promoting future outbursts.&lt;ref name="Bushman1999"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.76.3.367 | title = Catharsis, aggression, and persuasive influence: self-fulfilling or self-defeating prophecies? | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | date = March 1999 | first = B.

== Social catharsis ==
Emotional situations can elicit physiological, behavioral, cognitive, expressive, and subjective changes in individuals. Affected individuals often use social sharing as a cathartic release of emotions. Bernard Rimé studies the patterns of social sharing after emotional experiences. His works suggest that individuals seek social outlets in an attempt to modify the situation and restore personal homeostatic balance.

Rimé found that 80–95% of emotional episodes are shared. The affected individuals talk about the emotional experience recurrently to people around them throughout the following hours, days, or weeks. These results indicate that this response is irrespective of emotional valence, gender, education, and culture. His studies also found that social sharing of emotion increases as the intensity of the emotion increases.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Emotion Elicits the Social Sharing of Emotion: Theory and Empirical Review|journal = Emotion Review|year=2009|issn = 1754-0739|pages = 60–85|volume = 1|issue = 1|doi = 10.1177/1754073908097189|first = Bernard|last = Rimé}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stages ===
[[Émile Durkheim]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The elementary forms of the religious life, a study in religious sociology | last = Durkheim | first = Émile |url = https://archive.org/details/elementaryformso00durk | publisher = George Allen &amp; Unwin | translator-first = Joseph Ward | translator-last = Swain | year = 1915}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed emotional stages of social sharing:
# Directly after emotional effects, the emotions are shared. Through sharing, there is a reciprocal stimulation of emotions and emotional communion.
# This leads to social effects like social integration and strengthening of beliefs.
# Finally, individuals experience a renewed trust in life, strength, and self-confidence.

=== Motives ===
Affect scientists have found differences in motives for social sharing of positive and negative emotions.

A study by Langston&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Capitalizing on and coping with daily-life events: Expressive responses to positive events|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|pages = 1112–1125|volume = 67|issue = 6|doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.67.6.1112|first = Christopher A.|last = Langston}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that individuals share positive events to capitalize on the positive emotions they elicit. Reminiscing the positive experience augments positive affects like temporary mood and longer-term well-being. A study by Gable et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = What Do You Do When Things Go Right? The Intrapersonal and Interpersonal Benefits of Sharing Positive Events|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|pages = 228–245|volume = 87|issue = 2|doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.87.2.228|first = Shelly L.|last = Gable|first2 = Harry T.|last2 = Reis|first3 = Emily A.|last3 = Impett|first4 = Evan R.|last4 = Asher|pmid=15301629}}&lt;/ref&gt; confirmed Langston's "capitalization" theory by demonstrating that relationship quality is enhanced when partners are responsive to positive recollections. The responsiveness increased levels of intimacy and satisfaction within the relationship. In general, the motives behind social sharing of positive events are to recall the positive emotions, inform others, and gain attention from others. All three motives are representatives of capitalization.

'''(2) Negative emotion'''

Rimé studies suggest that the motives behind social sharing of negative emotions are to vent, understand, bond, and gain social support. Negatively affected individuals often seek life meaning and emotional support to combat feelings of loneliness after a tragic event.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== The grapevine effect ===
If emotions are shared socially and elicits emotion in the listener then the listener will likely share what they heard with other people. Rimé calls this process "secondary social sharing". If this repeats, it is then called "tertiary social sharing".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Collective catharsis ===
Collective emotional events share similar responses. When communities are affected by an emotional event, members repetitively share emotional experiences. After the 2001 New York and the 2004 Madrid terrorist attacks, more than 80% of respondents shared their emotional experience with others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Social sharing of emotion, post-traumatic growth, and emotional climate: Follow-up of Spanish citizen's response to the collective trauma of March 11th terrorist attacks in Madrid| journal = European Journal of Social Psychology| year=2009|issn = 1099-0992|pages = 1029–1045|volume = 40|issue = 6|doi = 10.1002/ejsp.700|first = Bernard|last = Rimé|first2 = Darío|last2 = Páez|first3 = Nekane|last3 = Basabe|first4 = Francisco|last4 = Martínez}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rimé, every sharing round elicits emotional reactivation in the sender and the receiver. This then reactivates the need to share in both. Social sharing throughout the community leads to high amounts of emotional recollection and "emotional overheating".

Pennebaker and Harber&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Social Stage Model of Collective Coping: The Loma Prieta Earthquake and The Persian Gulf War|journal = Journal of Social Issues | year = 1993 |issn = 1540-4560|pages = 125–145|volume = 49|issue = 4|doi = 10.1111/j.1540-4560.1993.tb01184.x|first = James W.|last = Pennebaker|first2 = Kent D.|last2 = Harber}}&lt;/ref&gt; defined three stages of collective responses to emotional events.

In the first stage, a state of "emergency" takes place in the first month after the emotional event. In this stage, there is an abundance of thoughts, talks, media coverage, and social integration based on the event.

In the second stage, the "plateau" occurs in the second month. Abundant thoughts remain, but the amount of talks, media coverage, and social integration decreases.

In the third stage, the "extinction" occurs after the second month. There is a return to normalcy.

=== Effect on emotional recovery ===
This cathartic release of emotions is often believed to be therapeutic for affected individuals. Many therapeutic mechanisms have been seen to aid in emotional recovery. One example is "interpersonal emotion regulation", in which listeners help to modify the affected individual's affective state by using certain strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Social Regulation of Emotion: An Integrative, Cross-Disciplinary Model|journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=20|issue=1|pages=47–63|year=2016|issn = 1879-307X|pmid = 26564248|doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2015.09.003|first = Crystal|last = Reeck|first2 = Daniel R.|last2 = Ames|first3 = Kevin N.|last3 = Ochsner}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expressive writing is another common mechanism for catharsis. Joanne Frattaroli&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Experimental disclosure and its moderators: A meta-analysis|journal = Psychological Bulletin|pages = 823–865|volume = 132|issue = 6|doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.132.6.823|first = Joanne|last = Frattaroli}}&lt;/ref&gt; published a meta-analysis suggesting that written disclosure of information, thoughts, and feelings enhances mental health.

However, other studies question the benefits of social catharsis. Finkenauer and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Flashbulb memories and the underlying mechanisms of their formation: Toward an emotional-integrative model|journal = Memory &amp; Cognition|year=1998|issn = 0090-502X|pages = 516–531|volume = 26|issue = 3|doi = 10.3758/BF03201160|first = Catrin|last = Finkenauer|first2 = Olivier|last2 = Luminet|first3 = Lydia|last3 = Gisle|first4 = Abdessadek|last4 = El-Ahmadi|first5 = Martial Van Der|last5 = Linden|first6 = Pierre|last6 = Philippot|pmid=9610122}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that non-shared memories were no more emotionally triggering than shared ones. Other studies have also failed to prove that social catharsis leads to any degree of emotional recovery. Zech and Rimé&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Is talking about an emotional experience helpful? effects on emotional recovery and perceived benefits|journal = Clinical Psychology &amp; Psychotherapy|year = 2005|issn = 1099-0879|pages = 270–287|volume = 12|issue = 4|doi = 10.1002/cpp.460|first = Emmanuelle|last = Zech|first2 = Bernard|last2 = Rimé}}&lt;/ref&gt; asked participants to recall and share a negative experience with an experimenter. When compared with the control group that only discussed unemotional topics, there was no correlation between emotional sharing and emotional recovery.

Some studies even found adverse effects of social catharsis. Contrary to the Frattaroli study, Sbarra and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Expressive Writing Can Impede Emotional Recovery Following Marital Separation|url = http://cpx.sagepub.com/content/1/2/120|journal = Clinical Psychological Science|year = 2013|issn = 2167-7026|pmc = 4297672|pmid = 25606351|pages = 120–134|volume = 1|issue = 2|doi = 10.1177/2167702612469801|first = David A.|last = Sbarra|first2 = Adriel|last2 = Boals|first3 = Ashley E.|last3 = Mason|first4 = Grace M.|last4 = Larson|first5 = Matthias R.|last5 = Mehl}}&lt;/ref&gt; found expressive writing to greatly impede emotional recovery following a marital separation. Similar findings have been published regarding trauma recovery. A group intervention technique is often used on disaster victims to prevent trauma-related disorders. However, meta-analysis showed negative effects of this cathartic "therapy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Single session debriefing after psychological trauma: a meta-analysis|journal = Lancet|year = 2002|issn = 0140-6736|pmid = 12241834|pages = 766–771|volume = 360|issue = 9335|doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(02)09897-5|first = Arnold A.

'''Celtic coinage''' was minted by the [[Celts]] from the  late 4th century BC to the late 1st century BC. Celtic coins were influenced by trade with and the supply of mercenaries to the Greeks, and initially copied Greek designs, especially [[Greek_drachma#Ancient_drachma|Macedonian coins]] from the time of [[Philip II of Macedon]] and his son, [[Alexander the Great]].

==Gaulish coinage==
{{Further|Greeks in pre-Roman Gaul}}
[[File:CoinsOfTheParisii.jpg|thumb|Celtic coin designs progressively became more abstract as exemplified by the coins of the [[Parisii (Gaul)|Parisii]].]]
[[File:Veneti coin 5th 1st century BCE.jpg|thumb|Coins of the [[Veneti (Gaul)|Veneti]], 5th-1st century BCE.]]
Greek coinage occurred in three Greek cities of [[Marseille|Massalia]], [[Emporiae]] and [[Roses, Girona|Rhoda]], and was copied throughout southern Gaul.&lt;ref name="Koch"/&gt;

Northern Gaulish coins were especially influenced by the coinage of [[Philip II of Macedon]] and his famous son [[Alexander the Great]].&lt;ref name="Koch"/&gt; Celtic coins often retained Greek subjects, such as the head of [[Apollo]] on the obverse and two-horse [[chariot]] on the reverse of the gold [[stater]] of Philip II, but developed their own style from that basis, allowing for the development of a Graeco-Celtic synthesis.&lt;ref name="Koch"/&gt;

After this first period in which Celtic coins rather faithfully reproduced Greek types, designs started to become more symbolic, as exemplified by the coinage of the [[Parisii (Gaul)|Parisii]] in the Belgic region of northern France.&lt;ref name="Koch"/&gt;

The [[Armorica]]n Celtic style in northwestern Gaul also developed from Celtic designs from the [[Rhine]] valley, themselves derived from earlier Greek prototypes such as the wine scroll and split [[palmette]].&lt;ref name="Koch"/&gt;

[[File:Web Biatec.jpg|thumb|left|[[Biatec]] original coin on the left; a modern 5 [[Slovak koruna|koruna]] on the right.]]
The [[Boii]] gave their name to Bohemia and Bologna; a Celtic coin ([[Biatec]]) from [[Bratislava]]'s mint is displayed on Slovak 5 koruna coin, which was  in use until Slovakia joined the euro zone on January 1, 2009.

The images found on Celtic coins include giants trailing severed heads on rope, horsemen charging into battle, gods and goddesses, skulls and chariot wheels, thunderbolts and lightning, the sun and the moon. They are miniature masterpieces of surreal art.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

A tribe of Celts called [[Eburones]] minted gold coins with triple spirals (a Celtic good luck symbol) on the front, and horses on the back.&lt;ref&gt;'''[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,452724,00.html Cache of Celtic Coins Uncovered in Dutch Cornfield]''' ''[[Associated Press]]'' November 16, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The coins were either 'struck' or 'cast'. Both methods required a substantial degree of knowledge. Striking a blank coin formed in a clay was one way. After forming the blank, it would have been flattened out before striking with a die made from iron or bronze. The tiny details engraved on dies were just a few millimeters in diameter. Casting a coin required a different technique. They were produced by pouring molten alloy into a set of molds which were broken apart when the metal had cooled.

With the Roman invasion of Gaul, Greek-inspired Celtic coinage started to incorporate Roman influence instead, until it disappeared to be completely replaced by Roman coinage.&lt;ref name="Koch"/&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Center versus periphery'''|方言周圏論|Hōgen-Shūken-Ron|lit. "Surrounding-zones dialect theory"}} is a linguistic theory put forward by Japanese folklorist [[Yanagita Kunio]] explaining the usage of certain words in a language used in some regions while not in others. The theory may also explain the existence of other [[culture|cultural]] features, or lack thereof, in differing regions; though it was specifically created to address linguistic differences.

==Overview==

In general, the theory states that new words, often [[synonyms]], are created in influential areas and cultural centers. Over time, these words gradually move outward to less culturally influential areas in a [[Ripple (fluid dynamics)|ripple pattern]]. Over time, the new words may travel a great distance. However, during their slow progression outwards from the cultural center, new words are also being created and gradually moving outwards. New words may not have the "momentum" necessary to propagate to all areas where the language is used. Typically, areas that are farthest away from a cultural center will possess only the oldest form of a word and no others, though the new words often still remain active in the cultural center where they were created, along with other synonym variations.

==Origin==
This theory was postulated by [[Yanagita Kunio]] to explain the existence of some words in cultural centers, such as the capital of [[Japan]], during various stages of the nation's history, and the lack of those such words in non-cultural centers. It is not certain if his postulate was the first to describe such cultural patterns in general; or merely with respect to language.

==Example==

[[Image:Hôgen Shûken-ron theory example.png|thumb|200px|Example word for the Center versus Periphery over time]]

One phenomenon the theory attempts to explain, for example, is the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word for [[snail]], particularly prior to the [[Meiji period]]. In [[Kyoto]], the capital of Japan around the time of the [[Edo period]], there were as many as four different words for snail: ''dedemushi'' (ででむし), ''maimai'' (まいまい), ''katatsumuri'' (かたつむり), and ''tsuburi'' (つぶり). In the areas outside the capital, not all of these words existed. As one traveled farther from the capital, the number of synonyms employed decreased. In the farthest reaches of Japan in the North and the South, typically only one word for "snail" was used. [[Coincidence|Coincidentally]], often the same single word existed in both places (in this case ''tsuburi'' (つぶり)), despite the great distance between the regions. Some [[linguists]] have taken this existence of some words in the farthest regions from cultural centers as an indication of the age of certain of these words.

[[File:Ercolano.JPG|thumb|250px|Ancient [[Herculaneum]] (bottom), modern [[Ercolano]] (center), and [[Vesuvius]] (top)]]
[[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]] were once thriving towns, 2,000 years ago, in the Bay of Naples. Though both cities have rich histories influenced by [[Greeks]], [[Oscans]], [[Etruscans]], [[Samnites]] and finally the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], they are most renowned for their destruction: both were buried in the AD 79 eruption of [[Mount Vesuvius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=Paul|title=Life and Death in Pompeii and Herculaneum|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199987436|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5yHWMgEACAAJ&amp;dq=pompeii+herculaneum+ad+79&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; For over 1,500 years, these cities were left in remarkable states of preservation underneath volcanic ash, mud and rubble. The eruption completely obliterated the towns but ironically was the cause of their longevity and survival over the centuries.

However, for both cities, excavation has brought with it deterioration, as both natural forces and human activity (whether accidental or deliberate) have played their part in the slow disintegration of the sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Amery|first1=Colin|last2=Curran|first2=Brian|title=The Lost World of Pompeii|date=2002|publisher=Getty Publications|isbn=9780892366873|page=35|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dO0mxAefnFEC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=pompeii+herculaneum+excavation+destruction&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjnv-HPlMjWAhWQb1AKHdsWAecQ6AEINjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=pompeii%20herculaneum%20excavation%20destruction&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Problems range from paintings being exposed to light and buildings being worn away by weathering, erosion and water damage to inappropriate excavation and reconstruction methods to outright theft and vandalism. As stated by Henri de Saint-Blanquat:

{{cquote|The city's second existence began with its gradual rediscovery in the 18th century. But just when Pompeii was being rediscovered, it began to die its second death. Not only because the early excavations, carried out over two hundred years ago and again in the 19th century, often turned out to be more of a massacre — what fun to carry off statues and fling around inscribed bronze plaques! — but also because all the remains preserved by the catastrophic explosion, were now exposed to the extremes of the weather, to vegetation and to man... Pompeii suffers from pollution, the worst forms of damage are of human origin.|20px|20px|Henri de Saint-Blanquat|''Science et Avenir''}}

The ancient city was included in the [[1996 World Monuments Watch]] by the [[World Monuments Fund]], and again in [[1998 World Monuments Watch|1998]] and in [[2000 World Monuments Watch|2000]]. In 1996, the organization claimed that Pompeii "desperately need[ed] repair" and called for the drafting of a general plan of restoration and interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;World Monuments Fund, [http://www.wmf.org/sites/default/files/wmf_publication/Watch_Catalog_1996.pdf ''List of 100 Most Endangered Sites - 1996''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130320153209/http://www.wmf.org/sites/default/files/wmf_publication/Watch_Catalog_1996.pdf |date=2013-03-20 }}, New York, NY: 1996, p. 31.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems of conservation==
While the excavation of the cities has led to a wealth of information on the two towns and on Roman life in general, it has also allowed the sites to come under the attack of the elements. Some of this is unpreventable; however, much of it can be slowed or completely stopped through human intervention. Unfortunately, funding is in such a state that not everything can be saved. An estimated US$335 million is needed to carry out all the works necessary in Pompeii alone. 
===Weathering and erosion===
Pompeii and Herculaneum have been excavated for centuries (excavations began in 1738 in Herculaneum, and later in 1748), and all exposed structures have been affected by general deterioration over time. In particular, since the eruption disrupted many of the buildings, excavation has left them unstable and vulnerable to collapse, such as the town wall of Pompeii. In many places, walls have partially collapsed, and much of the site is closed to visitors because of the danger it poses to them.

Many artifacts themselves are also damaged by natural processes. In Herculaneum, the carbonised remains of objects, once exposed to the air, deteriorated within days. Only when a substance ([[lampblack]]) was applied were they able to survive in the open. Also in Herculaneum, the bones of hundreds of victims found at the beach have been left in the open air due to a lack of funding, and are steadily disintegrating.

[[File:Roman fresco Villa dei Misteri Pompeii 011.jpg|left|thumb|250px|This fresco of a girl's initiation into the cult of [[Dionysos]] shows not only damage before and during the eruption, but also a distinct fade in the lustre of the paint caused from exposure after excavation. Flash photography is prohibited to inhibit further deterioration.]]

====Light exposure====
The frescoes, sculptures and paintings prevalent in both towns were highly preserved, retaining a large amount of detail, colour and vibrancy. Unfortunately, on excavation, they began to fade due to exposure to natural light, as well as beginning to crumble and pull away from the walls. However, these issues can be resolved through simple conservation techniques: earlier organic methods of preservation proved effective, and a more modern method using aluminium and plastic has had even better results. In addition, detailed reproductions have been made of many of the artworks, such as the [[Alexander Mosaic]] in the House of the Faun.

Not all actions taken to preserve structures and artefacts have been effective, however, and some have caused more damage. For example, perspex cases have been constructed to protect frescoes and graffiti, however this creates a humidity trap and causes damage to the plaster.

====Plants and animals====
The region of [[Campania]] in which both sites lie is very temperate and fertile, so many plants thrive even inside the archaeological site. Henri de Saint-Blanquat identifies thirty-one parasitic plants in Pompeii, which, after growing in patches of bare earth, grow outward and attack the surrounding buildings, as well as dislodging tiles and mosaics. In particular, ivy grows along the walls, making parts crumble, and the roots undermine the foundations of the buildings. In regions traversed by tourists, their feet trample the plants; in closed-off areas, particularly those closest to unexcavated parts of the cities, this severely damages the buildings.

[[File:Pompeii - Via dell'Abbondanza.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The buildings on the left show signs of decay due to the infestation of various plants, while the debris accumulating on the footpath indicates erosion of the infrastructure. The footpaths and road have also been worn down by pedestrian activity since excavation.]]

Feral dogs were particularly an issue in Pompeii. The dogs which occupied buildings around the Forum in the 1980s have been removed. Hundreds lived on the site, inadvertently damaging footpaths, roads and walls, as well as proving aggressive towards some tourists.

In Herculaneum, pigeons are a particular problem; the acidic nature of their feces wears away the roofs and walls of many structures. Italian law prohibits them from being shot.

=== Human activity ===
====Early excavations====
Particularly in Herculaneum, the earliest excavations revolved around collecting valuable artifacts and antiquities rather than systematic excavation. By merely digging for objects with [[aesthetic]] and commercial value, they were taken from being [[In situ#Archaeology|in situ]] to private collections, and thus much of the information on them was lost. Additionally, other objects not considered worthy by pursuers of [[Antiquarian]]ism were destroyed, or damaged in the process of retrieving other items.

These valuable objects, once discovered, were also disorganised and lost all historical meaning: a collection of bronze letters originally fixed on a wall in Herculaneum, once removed by the [[House of bourbon|Bourbon kings]], were taken out of order without recording the original placement or meaning. Visitors were invited to re-arrange them to form their own messages. A similar usage was made of bones: they would often be arranged together as composites of bones of several individuals, even combining those of children with adults and giving some literally two left feet. These would then be displayed for dramatic effect. Some of these remain today, but there is little hope of re-forming the original skeletons or using them to discover information on the inhabitants of Pompeii or Herculaneum.

====Reconstruction efforts====
[[Amedeo Maiuri]], director of Pompeii and Herculaneum from 1924 to 1961, was intent on re-creating the "atmosphere" of the two towns as they were just prior to the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius. Though some directors before him had taken limited steps towards this, Maiuri was motivated to reconstruct much of the infrastructure of the two towns. This meant rebuilding walls and roofs that had been knocked down by the eruption to reproduce the facade of the towns. This was particularly important in Pompeii, where the roofs and anything more than two metres above ground level were destroyed by the eruption.

Unfortunately, the materials used in this reconstruction were mostly concrete and steel. The mix of the cement was particularly bad in many places, and the alkaline in the masonry reacted with the ancient stones, causing crumbling and erosion to walls of structures such as the House of the Coloured Capitals, as well as peeling off any existing paint.
 
After the 1980s, these materials used in reconstruction were replaced by more modern ones which would not react badly with the original work, and the old reconstructions are being gradually replaced; however, the damage has already been done in most places, and the replacement endeavours will take many more years to complete.

====Tourism====
[[Tourism]] has been a mixed blessing for the site. As there are 2.5 million visitors to both cities every year, their presence allows for education on the conservation issues on the site. Additionally, a law was passed in Italy in 1997, which allowed for all money raised from these tourists to be directly channeled to helping with the conservation of the site.

However, the massive number of tourists also causes many problems. The general movement of them causes the gradual wearing down of the roads and pavements, particularly in the more frequented areas like the Pompeiian [[forum (Roman)|Forum]] complex. Tourists also might take chips of rock or stone from the site, as well as accidentally brushing against the walls and frescoes, further increasing their rate of deterioration. The open nature of both sites to tourists is also a leading cause in vandalism and theft.

[[File:Pompeii - Temple of Venus.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Fencing in the temple of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] in Pompeii prevents vandalism of the site, as well as theft - many tourists obtain small artefacts from both cities as souvenirs.]]

====Vandalism and war====
Vandalism, particularly graffiti, is a problematic issue for Pompeii and Herculaneum. Tourists and others often break off parts of the city's structures to take home as mementos or souvenirs. Graffiti appears inscribed in the walls (often alongside their [[Graffiti#Ancient graffiti|ancient counterparts]]) as well as on paintings and frescoes, particularly the less damaged or unsullied works of art.  The site was also bombed by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] air forces during the [[Second World War]], and many of its buildings needed to be reconstructed in the postwar period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/pompeii/interactives/bombing/index.html The Last Days of Pompeii (Getty Villa Exhibitions)]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Theft====
While both areas are guarded, many artifacts still find their way to the [[illicit antiquities]] market. Often these acts of theft also cause accidental damage to surrounding objects, and the thieved antiquities are no longer [[In situ#Archaeology|''in situ'']] and lose their context and cultural associations.

In 2003, two frescoes were hacked off a wall in the House of the Chaste Lovers in Pompeii. This act of theft also damaged several other frescoes in the house, and, though a camera system exists in Pompeii, it had been out of operation for several months when the event took place. These frescoes were recovered some months later, but many others have disappeared from the site, never to be returned.

==House of the Gladiators collapse==
The 2,000-year-old “House of the Gladiators” in the ruins of ancient Pompeii collapsed on 6 November 2010. Known officially by its Latin name “Schola Armatorum ” the structure was not open to visitors but was visible from the outside as tourists walked along one of the ancient city’s main streets. There was no immediate word on what caused the building to collapse, although reports suggested water infiltration following heavy rains might be responsible. There has been fierce controversy regarding the collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torontosun.com/news/world/2010/11/06/16003236.html |title=Pompeii collapse prompts charges of official neglect }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-News/Pompeii-Gladiator-Centre-Collapses-At-Archaeological-Site-In-Southern-Italy-Cause-Not-Yet-Known/Article/201011115796320?lpos=World_News_First_Home_Page_Feature_Teaser_Region_0&amp;lid=ARTICLE_15796320_Pompeii_Gladiator_Centre_Collapses_At_Archaeological_Site_In_Southern_Italy%2C_Cause_Not_Yet_Known |title=Pompeii Gladiator Training Centre Collapses |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101113083136/http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-News/Pompeii-Gladiator-Centre-Collapses-At-Archaeological-Site-In-Southern-Italy-Cause-Not-Yet-Known/Article/201011115796320?lpos=World_News_First_Home_Page_Feature_Teaser_Region_0&amp;lid=ARTICLE_15796320_Pompeii_Gladiator_Centre_Collapses_At_Archaeological_Site_In_Southern_Italy%2C_Cause_Not_Yet_Known |archivedate=2010-11-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation projects==
There are many conservation projects, endeavours and enterprises associated with both cities in an attempt to prevent further deterioration. These focus on removing the forces that attack the sites, as well as restoring the damaged artefacts and preventing further destruction.

[[File:Pompeii - Conservation Work on Via dell'Abbondanza.jpg|right|thumb|200px|This site of conservation work on the Via dell'Abbondanza (Street of Abundance) is part of a larger project by the Soprintendenza Archaeologica di Pompeii to restore the [[facade]]s and frescoes of many buildings on the street.]]

===Soprintendenza Speciale per i Beni Archeologici di Napoli e Pompeii===
The Soprintendenza Speciale per i Beni Archeologici di Napoli e Pompeii is the major administrative body of both sites and others in the Naples and Vesuvuian area. It has overall responsibility for caring for both ancient cities, managing the sites, conserving them, working towards the removal of plants, providing security to prevent further theft, administering tourist entry into the site and reconstructing various buildings. It also directs many other subsidiary projects, and controls all funding and access to the two cities. Projects such as the restoration of frescoes and sculptures in Pompeii are run by the institute. Additionally, modern technology is used to help in conservation; in 2006, a laser survey was created of the Forum complex, allowing a [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]], digital reconstruction.

===Moratorium===
In 1999, Pietro Giovanni Guzzo declared a [[Moratorium (law)|moratorium]] on all further excavations of both sites. As then superintendent, he decided that all funds should be diverted into preserving the remains of both cities, rather than excavating more when massive amounts of work is still needed on the areas already unearthed. This has caused controversy amongst historians and archaeologists, and has become the centre of the debate on whether to focus on conservation or excavation. Classicists argue that only by continuing excavations can more ancient texts be found to reveal more about ancient Roman life. In particular, they pin their hopes on the unexcavated chamber of the [[Villa of the Papyri]], where over 1,800 carbonised [[Herculaneum papyri|papyrus rolls]] have been discovered containing works of [[Epicureanism|Epicurean philosophy]] by Philodemus. However, those in favour of conservation argue that the texts are much safer underground than exposed and we still have much to draw from what has already been excavated.

Minor excavations, such as that of the House of the Surgeon currently being undertaken by the Anglo-American Project at Pompeii at a cost of 10 million euro a year, are still allowed. However, no new sites are open to be excavated.

===Herculaneum Conservation Project===
As a joint project led by the [[Packard Humanities Institute]] and the Soprintendenza Speciale per I Beni Archaeologici di Napoli e Pompeii with the British School at Rome, the project has worked since 2001 to halt the serious decay conditions which were found at the site. Initially the work focused on an emergency campaign which then transformed into works to ensure the long-term maintenance of the site. A major emphasis has been placed on ensuring that infrastructures work effectively so that when the project is completed, the Soprintendenza will be in a good position to manage the continuous care of the site. In addition scientific research is under way so that suitable methodologies can be identified to conserve Herculaneum's wall paintings, plasters, mosaics, wooden features, structures, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Fall and Rise and Fall of Pompeii|url = http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/fall-rise-fall-pompeii-180955732/?no-ist|accessdate = 2015-07-01|first = Joshua|last = Hammer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anthropology |methods}}

'''Cyber-ethnography''', also known as '''virtual ethnography''',  and most commonly '''online ethnography''', is an [[Online research methods|online research method]] that adapts [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] methods to the study of the communities and cultures created through computer-mediated social interaction. Online ethnography has by far the wider use. As modifications of the term ethnography, cyber-ethnography, online ethnography and virtual ethnography (as well as many other methodological neologisms) designate particular variations regarding the conduct of online fieldwork that adapts ethnographic methodology. There is no canonical approach to cyber-ethnography that prescribes how ethnography is adapted to the online setting. Instead individual researchers are left to specify their own adaptations. [[Netnography]] is another form of online ethnography or cyber-ethnography with more specific sets of guidelines and rules, and a common multidisciplinary base of literature and scholars. This article is not about a particular neologism, but the general application of ethnographic methods to online fieldwork as practiced by anthropologists, sociologists, and other scholars.

== Introduction ==

Traditional ethnography study observes the interactions between individuals who are co-located. Ethnographies of online cultures and communities extend ethnographic study to settings where interactions are technologically mediated, not face-to-face. Cyber-ethnography therefore addresses limitations in the traditional notion of a field site as a localized space. It also understands that [[online community|online communities]] can create a shared culture through digitally mediated interactions.  Although the assertion that ethnographic fieldwork can be meaningfully applied to computer-mediated interactions has been contested,&lt;ref&gt;Clifford, J. (1997). Spatial Practices: Fieldwork, Travel, and the Discipline of Anthropology. In A. Gupta &amp; J. Ferguson (Eds.) Anthropological Locations: Boundaries and Grounds of a Field Science. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 185-222.&lt;/ref&gt;  it is increasingly becoming accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Cora|first2=Angela|last3=Standlee|first3=Alecea I.|last4=Bechkoff|first4=Jennifer|last5=Cui|first5=Yan|year=2009|title=Ethnographic Approaches to the Internet and Computer-Mediated Communication|url=|journal=Journal of Contemporary Ethnography|volume=38|issue=1|pages=52–84|doi=10.1177/0891241607310839|last1=Garcia|first1=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other early internet researchers,  early cyber-ethnographers such as [[Sandy Stone (artist)|Sandy Stone]] and [[Sherry Turkle]] observed that participants in online [[role-playing]] communities enact social performances that can diverge dramatically from their offline personas.&lt;ref name="Robinson3"&gt;Robinson, L., &amp; Schulz, J., "New fieldsites, new methods: New ethnographic opportunities," Ch. 8 In The Handbook of Emergent Technologies in Social Research.&lt;/ref&gt;  This led to the idea that online identities can be segmented from offline ones. Cyber-ethnography was seen as a new kind of methodology that might uncover how the internet would radically change society.  However, as the internet reached the mainstream and cyber-ethnographers sought legitimacy, cyber-ethnography was reframed as adaptation of traditional methods into a new context.  Understanding the degree to which divergent performances in online and offline settings reflect a segmentation of identity or a continuous identity performed differently in different contexts remains an important consideration for cyber ethnographers.&lt;ref name="Robinson3"/&gt;

Many other aspects of online, computer-mediated, or virtual, interaction and community formation are distinct from their in-person, [[real life]], or face-to-face counterparts. Of central importance is that many interactions in online communities are textual.&lt;ref name="Robinson3"/&gt;  While these textual artifacts resemble the traces of interaction, they constitute the interactions of interest to the cyberethnographer.  They are a different kind of interaction in which body language and other kinds of social cues are absent or translated into signs and text.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

The character and level of access available to researchers of online communities are also particular to cyber-ethnography.  Whereas face-to-face interactions are ephemeral as they occur, online social interactions are often automatically saved and archived, creating permanent accurate records. Also, distinctions between private and public spaces are often unclear in online communities.&lt;ref name="Robinson3"/&gt; cyber-ethnography attempts to adapt participant-observation procedures such as making cultural entrée, collecting and analyzing data, and conducting ethical research to these computer-mediated contingencies.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Cyber-ethnography has significantly developed with the emergence of new technologies. Almost since their inception, some researchers have acted as [[lurker]]s and conducted purely observational studies of online cultures and communities  rather than as [[Participant observation|participant observer]]s in an online community.&lt;ref&gt;Del Fresno, Miguel (2011) Netnografía. Investigación, análisis e intervención social. Editorial UOC, 1ª edición, Barcelona, España&lt;/ref&gt; This approach has been criticized by scholars who argue that researchers should fully participate as members of the online community.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, D. (2001). An introduction to cyberculture. New York: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller2"&gt;Miller, D., and Slater, D. (2000). The Internet: An ethnographic approach. Oxford; New York: Berg.&lt;/ref&gt;  These scholars value the traditional ethnographic standards of [[participant observation]], prolonged engagement, and deep immersion. Cyber-ethnography, like traditional ethnography often aims to produce a [[thick description]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Interpretation of Cultures|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|publisher=Basic Books|year=1973|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; that can help an outsider understand the meaning of behavior in a culture or community.&lt;ref name="hine3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Virtual Ethnography|last=Hine|first=Christine |year=2000|publisher=Sage|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Life Online: Researching Real Experience in Virtual Space|last=Markham|first=Anette|publisher=AltaMira Press|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; This focus on participation and immersion makes these approaches quite distinct from qualitative internet research methods like [[online interview]]s, and [[online content analysis]]. Ethnographic methods are also quite different from quantitative Internet research methods like [[web usage mining]] or [[social network analysis]].  However some researchers complementary research methods along with cyber-ethnography in order to [[Triangulation (social science)|triangulate]] their findings.

==The range of methodologies==
Ethnographers have approached the study of the Internet in a range of different ways. A variety of terms refer to various formulations of methodological approaches to cyber-ethnography. Many of these seek to maintain their own dialog with the established tradition of ethnography. Each formulates its relation to the established anthropological tradition in different (and sometimes inconsistent) ways. Some think that ethnographies conducted online involve a distinctive methodological approach. Others think that cyber-ethnography is not a distinctive form of ethnography although researching the Internet ethnographically forces us to reflect on fundamental assumptions and concepts of ethnography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Beaulieu|first2=Anne|last3=Estalella|first3=Adolfo|last4=Gómez|first4=Edgar|last5=Schnettler|first5=Bernt|last6=Read|first6=Rosie|year=2007|title=Virtual Ethnography|url=http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs-texte/3-07/07-3-E1-e.htm|journal=[[Forum Qualitative Social Research|Forum Qualitative Sozialforschung]] / [[Forum Qualitative Social Research]]|volume=8|issue=|page=3|last1=Domínguez|first1=Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methods choices need to be directly adapted to the kind of questions a researcher seeks to answer. The main advantage of cyber-ethnography reside in the scope and scale of the available data.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} Other advantages include seeking input directly from participants. For example, posting raw fieldnotes on a blog and allowing participants to leave comments can provide transparency. Cyber-ethnography also allows for a variety of data collection types and including  audiovisual formats, on various platforms such as websites, social networks and forums.

=== Offline participant observation ===
It is important for cyber-ethnographers to consider whether online interactions are sufficient for them to develop a deep understanding  the community.&lt;ref name="Robinson3"/&gt;  It is not clear whether identity performances in online environments should be thought of as disjoint from offline identities or if they are continuous with offline identities.  When researchers feel that understanding the relationship between the online and offline identities of members is necessary, they may seek to meet with informants face-to-face.

Virtual research ethics: Issues and controversies.

However, other cyber-ethnographers have argued that difference between online and offline selves is similar to the different identity performances that occur in other contexts.&lt;ref name="Robinson3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robinson|first=Laura|date=2007-02-01|title=The cyberself: the self-ing project goes online, symbolic interaction in the digital age|url=http://nms.sagepub.com/content/9/1/93|journal=New Media &amp; Society|language=en|volume=9|issue=1|pages=93–110|doi=10.1177/1461444807072216|issn=1461-4448}}&lt;/ref&gt; This perspective views identity issues in cyber-ethnography as consistent with those of traditional ethnography.  Researchers should thus consider how community members relate their online and offline selves.  If it is normal for community members to bring together their online and offline identities and meet face-to-face then it makes sense that the ethnographer should observe or participate in these offline interactions in order to fully understand the community as was done by [[Sherry Turkle]].&lt;ref name="Robinson3" /&gt;

However, many cyber-ethnographers including Hine and Walstrom believe that participant observation in the offline setting can be biased by asymmetry between the researcher and the member.&lt;ref name="Robinson3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hine3"/&gt;  This is because community members rely on computer mediated communication they may be at a disadvantage to a researcher who understands their online interactions, but also employ face-to-face communication.  As it is often the case that researchers are interested in understanding the interactions in the online context and that comparing online and offline identity is not important, credible ethnographic studies can be done in online-only contexts.&lt;ref name="hine3" /&gt;

=== Limitations ===
One of the main disadvantages of online ethnography is the need for the ethnographer to possess certain technology-based skills. Some studies might only require elementary computer skills, but others may require advanced knowledge of technologies and tools such as web-based applications, analytical tools, and computer programming. The development of such technologies tends to grow faster than the methodology literature thus "there is little consensus on how [to] best collect and analyze new media data".&lt;ref name="Robinson3" /&gt;

The temporal nature of online data can also be an issue. Cyber-ethnographers might ask, "What is data of the present?" Robinson (2011) states that in cases such as YouTube videos and subsequent comments, "the present cyber-reality may be interpreted as a continual accumulation of all past input by members or participants".&lt;ref name="Robinson3" /&gt; Cyber-ethnographers also needs to also think of his/her own identify and how "[it] might become part of a feedback loop with those he/she is studying"&lt;ref name="Robinson3" /&gt; and whether or not it eschews the data collected and the integrity of the study. Thus, there is a need for cyber-ethnographers to be particularly flexible and reflexive in their practice of ethnography.

== Ethics ==

To the extent that cyber-ethnography is similar to [[ethnography]] in a localized space, it will raise similar [[Ethnography#Ethics|ethical considerations]]. However, the nature of the online space does raise new ethical issues, including those related to [[Informed consent#Research|informed consent]] of [[Human subject research|human subjects]], protections of privacy or anonymity of research subjects, and whether  cyber-ethnography might be a form of "electronic eavesdropping."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Peterson|first2=Leighton C.|year=2002|title=The Anthropology of Online Communities|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|publisher=|volume=31|issue=|pages=449–467|doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.31.040402.085436|jstor=4132888|last1=Wilson|first1=Samuel M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of these differences, the [[American Anthropological Association]] has yet to include any specific recommendations regarding cyber-ethnography in its Code of Ethics.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aaanet.org/issues/policy-advocacy/upload/2009-AAA-Ethics-Code.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, there are significant ethical issues around the use of digital tools and data collection from the cyberspace. "Cyberethnographer need to respect privacy in cyberspace".&lt;ref name="Murthy2"&gt;Murthy, D. (2011) "Emergent digital ethnographic methods for social research," Ch. 7 In The Handbook of Emergent Technologies in Social Research.&lt;/ref&gt;  That a website is not password-protected researcher does not necessarily imply that it is open space where the right to anonymity and privacy dissolve. Thus Robinson (2011) insists, "if our identities in cyberspace are extensions of our off-line identities, they must be afforded the same ethical consideration as they would be given in the off-line world".&lt;ref name="Murthy2" /&gt;

[[Institutional review board]]s (IRBs) may not be equipped for ethical dilemmas presented by cyber-ethnography.  Researchers need to make their intentions clear and define properly what data will be collected.    When researcher "lurk" by covertly observes and gathers data they will not gain participants' knowledge and consent. This conflicts with the traditional ethnographic practice of [[informed consent]], in which participants have the right to learn about the study at hand and make an informed decision on whether or not to participate. Cyber-ethnographers face the challenge of informing participants of their presence and research activities without jeopardizing their ability to collect valid data. Scholars recommend including note in the researcher's posts that identifies their research interest and links to more information.&lt;ref name="Murthy2" /&gt;  However, this practice is only possible in some online spaces, such as forums, but not in others.

Another issue is that the technological innovations and possibility for new research outpace the creation of clear and adapted ethical guidelines. Nonetheless, some guidelines do exist and are regularly updated by the [[Association of Internet Researchers]] (AoIR).

Another ethical constraint and a possible disadvantage to cyber-ethnography is the intricate anonymization of the data. Protecting participant anonymity often conflicts with the preservation of the participants' words. Although, consent might be obtained from participants to collect, use and publish textual data, the simple use of pseudonyms is in most cases not enough to guarantee the [[anonymity]] of the data.  Indeed, searching for direct quotes in a Google search is often sufficient to identify participants. anyone can potentially have access to search results revealing the author and their identity. To mitigate this issue, many scholars choose to paraphrase textual data to avoid source identification.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} Thus, "ethical concerns must be reexamined in light of new technologies for both subjects and researchers alike".&lt;ref name="Murthy2" /&gt;

A '''dance double''' is a type of [[stunt double]] who steps in and performs the dangerous or physically difficult dance parts of a character's role in film or television.

These highly trained professionals provide their bodies, their dance technique, their physical expression and their artistry so that an actor/actress can play the role of a dancer convincingly.

'''Dasan and Vijayan''' (or '''Ramadasan and Vijayan''') are two fictional character duo, the protagonists in the ''Nadodikkattu'' film series. The comical characters were created by the duo [[Siddique–Lal]] and are portrayed by [[Mohanlal]] (Dasan) and [[Sreenivasan]] (Vijayan). Dasan and Vijayan are [[detective]]s by profession working in the [[Crime Investigation Department (India)|Crime Investigation Department]] (CID) in [[Tamil Nadu Police]], India. The characters first appeared in the 1987 [[black comedy]] film ''[[Nadodikkattu]]'' and later in its sequels ''[[Pattanapravesham]]'' (1988), and ''[[Akkare Akkare Akkare]]'' (1990).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=K.|first=Rejimon|title=In a new guise|url=http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/fr/2005/09/30/stories/2005093001320200.htm|accessdate=8 February 2017|work=[[The Hindu]]|date=30 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first two films in the series was directed by [[Sathyan Anthikad]] and the later by [[Priyadarshan]], the trilogy was scripted by Sreenivasan. Since the release of ''Nadodikkattu'', the characters have achieved a [[cult status]] in the [[popular culture]] of [[Kerala]], along with some other characters in the film, such as Anandan Nambiar ([[Thilakan]]), Gafoorka ([[Mamukkoya]]), Pavanai ([[Captain Raju]]), Prabhakaran ([[Karamana Janardanan Nair]]) and several dialogues in the film has become [[catchphrase]]s. The characters was first introduced as an unemployed youth.

== Overview ==

The characters were created by [[Siddique–Lal]] in a story they wrote.&lt;ref name=story/&gt; Dasan is shown as more educated than Vijayan, and enjoys teasing Vijayan about the same. The chemistry of Mohanlal-Sreenivasan combo in the film was widely acclaimed, since then they have united for such roles in many films that followed. The series began with ''[[Nadodikkattu]]'' in 1987, directed by [[Sathyan Anthikad]], he directed its sequel ''[[Pattanapravesham]]'' in the following year, in 1990, [[Priyadarshan]] continued the series with his directorial ''[[Akkare Akkare Akkare]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jayaram|first=Deepika|title=Reel friends forever|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/malayalam/movies/news/Reel-friends-forever/articleshow/48314583.cms|accessdate=8 February 2017|work=[[The Times of India]]|date=2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nadodikkattu'' was significant in increasing the demand for comedy films in Malayalam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=George|first=Vijay|title=Siddique speaking|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/siddique-speaking/article4605926.ece|accessdate=8 February 2017|work=[[The Hindu]]|date=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; About its cult following, Anthikad says "the secret of the duo still being alive in the Malayali's consciousness may be because it's a story of two unemployed youngsters told using a humorous narrative. Unemployment was one of the biggest issues and migration to greener pastures was typical of Malayali experience. This has continued to the current decade. So, the audience has no problem relating to Dasan and Vijayan,".&lt;ref name=story&gt;{{cite news|last=Kumar|first=M. K.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2264">The '''effect of reality''' ({{lang-fr|effet de réel}}) is a textual device identified by [[Roland Barthes]] the purpose of which was to establish literary texts as [[Literary realism|realistic]].

==History==
Barthes first suggested this concept in his 1968 essay "The Reality Effect," in which he argues that untheorized descriptive "residues" of the text produce effects of reality through their dissembling of the tripartite sign. In the absence of any signified, Barthes argues, the textual signifiers for "real" objects had for their actual signifieds only the concept of realism itself; further, Barthes suggested that the origins of this textual device came through the development of an "aesthetic finality of language" present in the use of the rhetorical device of [[ecphrasis]] in "Alexandrian neo-rhetoric of the second century" (''The Reality Effect'' in Barthes 1989).

Barthes also showed that this ''effect of reality'' was a key problem of historical analysis and writing in that historical writing proclaimed an unproblematic realism that was in fact just this textual device in action  (''The Discourse of History'' in Barthes 1989).  It was this aspect of the ''effect of reality'' that [[Frank Ankersmit|Ankersmit]] showed helped to explain both the evolution of historical enquiry and the problematic textual nature of history (Ankersmit 1989).

The concern with realism and the constructed nature of historical and literary facts that both [[Roland Barthes|Barthes]] and [[Frank Ankersmit|Ankersmit]] expressed is also to be found in the field of [[Discursive psychology]]; and [[Jonathan Potter]] has analysed similar problems and issues in his "Representing Reality" (Potter 1996).

'''Extremism''' means, literally, "the quality or state of being extreme" or "the advocacy of extreme measures or views".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/extremism |title=Definition of extremism  |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]] |accessdate=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is primarily used in a [[politics|political]] or [[religion|religious]] sense, to refer to an [[ideology]] that is considered (by the speaker or by some implied shared social consensus) to be far outside the [[mainstream]] attitudes of society.&lt;ref name="The Free Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/extremism|title=Extremism – definition of |publisher=[[The Free Dictionary]]|accessdate=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be used in an economic context. The term is usually meant to be [[pejorative]]. However, it may also be used in a more academic, purely descriptive, non-condemning sense.

Extremists are usually contrasted with [[centrism|centrists]] or moderates. For example, in contemporary discussions in [[Western world|Western countries]] of [[Islam]] or of [[political aspects of Islam#20th and 21st century|Islamic political movements]], the distinction between [[Islamic extremism|extremist]] (implying "bad") and [[Moderate Muslim|moderate]] (implying "good") [[Muslim|Muslims]] is typically stressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/attach/106/106950_.pdf |title=The Battle for Hearts and Minds: Moderate vs. Extremist Views in the Muslim World |author=Mogahed, Dalia |publisher=[[WikiLeaks]] |year=2006 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political agendas perceived as extremist often include those from the [[far-left politics]] or [[far-right politics]] as well as [[political radicalism|radicalism]], [[reactionary|reactionism]], [[fundamentalism]] and [[fanaticism]].

== Definitions ==
{{Over-quotation|section|date=June 2017}}
There have been many different definitions of "extremism". [[Evan Dyke Miguel (academic)|Peter T.&amp;nbsp;Coleman]] and Andrea Bartoli give observation of definitions:&lt;ref name="ab" /&gt; Extremism is a complex phenomenon, although its complexity is often hard to see. Most simply, it can be defined as activities (beliefs, attitudes, feelings, actions, strategies) of a character far removed from the ordinary. In conflict settings it manifests as a severe form of conflict engagement. However, the labeling of activities, people, and groups as "extremist", and the defining of what is "ordinary" in any setting is always a subjective and political matter. Thus, we suggest that any discussion of extremism be mindful of the following: Typically, the same extremist act will be viewed by some as just and moral (such as pro-social "freedom fighting"), and by others as unjust and immoral (antisocial "terrorism") depending on the observer's values, politics, moral scope, and the nature of their relationship with the actor. In addition, one's sense of the moral or immoral nature of a given act of extremism (such as Nelson Mandela's use of guerilla war tactics against the South African Government) may change as conditions (leadership, world opinion, crises, historical accounts, etc.) change. Thus, the current and historical context of extremist acts shapes our view of them. Power differences also matter when defining extremism. When in conflict, the activities of members of low power groups tend to be viewed as more extreme than similar activities committed by members of groups advocating the status quo. 

In addition, extreme acts are more likely to be employed by marginalized people and groups who view more normative forms of conflict engagement as blocked for them or biased. However, dominant groups also commonly employ extreme activities (such as governmental sanctioning of violent paramilitary groups or the attack in Waco by the FBI in the U.S.).

Extremist acts often employ violent means, although extremist groups will differ in their preference for violent vs. non-violent tactics, in the level of violence they employ, and in the preferred targets of their violence (from infrastructure to military personnel to civilians to children). Again, low power groups are more likely to employ direct, episodic forms of violence (such as suicide bombings), whereas dominant groups tend to be associated with more structural or institutionalized forms (like the covert use of torture or the informal sanctioning of police brutality).&lt;ref name="ab" /&gt; 

Although extremist individuals and groups are often viewed as cohesive and consistently evil, it is important to recognize that they may be conflicted or ambivalent psychologically as individuals, or contain difference and conflict within their groups. For instance, individual members of Hamas may differ considerably in their willingness to negotiate their differences with the Palestinian Authority and, ultimately, with certain factions in Israel. Ultimately, the core problem that extremism presents in situations of protracted conflict is less the severity of the activities (although violence, trauma, and escalation are obvious concerns) but more so the closed, fixed, and intolerant nature of extremist attitudes, and their subsequent imperviousness to change.&lt;ref name="ab" /&gt;

== Theories of extremism ==
[[Eric Hoffer]] and [[Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.]] were two political writers during the mid-20th century who gave what purported to be accounts of "political extremism". Hoffer wrote ''[[The True Believer]]'' and ''The Passionate State of Mind'' about the psychology and sociology of those who join "fanatical" mass movements. Schlesinger wrote ''The Vital Center'', championing a supposed "center" of politics within which "mainstream" political discourse takes place, and underscoring the alleged need for societies to draw definite lines regarding what falls outside of this acceptability.

[[Seymour Martin Lipset]] argued that besides the extremism of the left and right there is also an ''extremism of the center'', and that it actually formed the base of [[fascism]].&lt;ref&gt;G. M. Tamás: "[http://new.bostonreview.net/BR25.3/tamas.html On Post-Fascism]", ''[[Boston Review]]'', Summer 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Laird Wilcox]] identifies 21 alleged traits of a "political extremist", ranging from behaviour like "a tendency to [[character assassination]]", over [[hate]]ful behaviour like "name calling and [[labelling]]", to general character traits like "a tendency to view opponents and critics as essentially evil", "a tendency to substitute [[intimidation]] for argument" or "[[groupthink]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lairdwilcox.com/news/hoaxerproject.html |title=Laird Wilcox on Extremist Traits |publisher=Lairdwilcox.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joining extremist groups has been seen to arise from beliefs about the acceptability of aggression towards the group's target. For example, in Pakistan, beliefs about the acceptability of aggression against Jews were shown to predict who would join an extremist anti-Semitic group.&lt;ref name=amjad&gt;Amjad, N.; Wood, A.M. (2009). [http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/alex.wood/amjadwood.pdf Identifying and changing the normative beliefs about aggression which lead young Muslim adults to join extremist anti-Semitic groups in Pakistan.] ''Aggressive Behavior'', 35, 514–19&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural differences in acceptability about aggression towards certain groups may explain extremism towards certain targets, and as these beliefs can be easily changed through intervention, this may offer a way in which extremism can be discouraged.&lt;ref name=amjad /&gt;

"Extremism" is not a stand-alone characteristic. The attitude or behavior of an "extremist" may be represented as part of a spectrum which ranges from mild interest through "obsession" to "fanaticism" and "extremism". The alleged similarity between the "extreme left" and "extreme right", or perhaps between different religious "zealots", may mean only that all these are "unacceptable" from the standpoint of a supposed mainstream or majority.

Economist Ronald Wintrobe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economics.uwo.ca/faculty/wintrobe/ |title=Economics at Western |publisher=Economics.uwo.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that many extremist movements, even though having completely different ideologies share a common set of characteristics. As an example, he lists the following common characteristics between "Jewish fundamentalists" and "the extremists of Hamas":&lt;ref&gt;Wintrobe (2006), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|
* Both are against any compromise with the other side.
* Both are entirely sure of their position.
* Both advocate and sometimes use violence to achieve their ends.
* Both are nationalistic.
* Both are intolerant of dissent within their group.
* Both demonize the other side
}}

=== Psychological ===
Among the explanations for extremism is one that views it as a plague.&lt;ref name="ab" /&gt; [[Arno Gruen]] said, "The lack of identity associated with extremists is the result of self-destructive self-hatred that leads to feelings of revenge toward life itself, and a compulsion to kill one's own humanness." Thus extremism is seen as not a tactic, nor an ideology, but as a pathological illness which feeds on the destruction of life.&lt;ref name="ab"&gt;Dr. Peter T. Coleman and Dr. Andrea Bartoli: [http://www.tc.columbia.edu/i/a/document/9386_WhitePaper_2_Extremism_030809.pdf Addressing Extremism], pp. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kathleen Taylor (biologist)|Dr. Kathleen Taylor]] believes [[religious fundamentalism]] is a mental illness and that is "curable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bruxelles |first=Simon de |title=Science ‘may one day cure Islamic radicals' |work=The Times  |location=London |accessdate=2013-05-31 |date=30 May 2013 |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/article3778053.ece}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another view is that extremism is an emotional outlet for severe feelings stemming from "persistent experiences of oppression, insecurity, humiliation, resentment, loss, and rage" which are presumed to "lead individuals and groups to adopt conflict engagement strategies which "fit" or feel consistent with these experiences".&lt;ref name="ab" /&gt;

Extremism is however seen by other researchers as a "rational strategy in a game over power".&lt;ref name="ab" /&gt; See for instance the works of [[Eli Berman]].

== Criticism ==

After being accused of extremism, [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] criticized the mainstream usage of the term in his [[Letter from Birmingham Jail]],
″But though I was initially disappointed at being categorized as an extremist, as I continued to think about the matter I gradually gained a measure of satisfaction from the label. Was not Jesus an extremist for love…Was not Amos an extremist for justice…Was not Martin Luther an extremist…So the question is not whether we will be extremists, but what kind of extremists we will be.  Will we be extremists for hate or for love? Will we be extremists for the preservation of injustice or for the extension of justice?″&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/king-papers/documents/letter-birmingham-jail|title=Letter From a Birmingham Jail - The Martin Luther King, Jr., Research and Education Institute|website=kinginstitute.stanford.edu|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/what-martin-luther-king-taught-me-about-extremism-8788384.html|title=What Martin Luther King taught me about extremism|website=independent.co.uk|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barry Goldwater]], in his 1964 acceptance speech at the [[1964 Republican National Convention]], said, "I would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice. And let me remind you also that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/daily/may98/goldwaterspeech.htm|title=Washingtonpost.com: Goldwater Speech|website=www.washingtonpost.com|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert F. Kennedy]] said "What is objectionable, what is dangerous about extremists is not that they are extreme but that they are intolerant. The evil is not what they say about their cause, but what they say about their opponents."

In [[Russian Federation|Russia]], the [[Russian law|laws]] prohibiting extremist content are used (both by poorly trained officials and as part of an intentional politics to suppress opposition) to suppress the [[freedom of speech]] through very broad and flexible interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.interpretermag.com/fsb-increasingly-involved-in-misuse-of-anti-extremism-laws-sova-says/ |title=FSB Increasingly Involved in Misuse of 'Anti-Extremism' Laws, SOVA Says |website=The Interpreter Magazine |date=29 March 2015 |accessdate=2015-04-01 |author=Paul Goble}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publications classified as "extremist" and thus prosecuted included protests against the court rulings in [[Bolotnaya Square case]] ("calling for illegal action"), criticism of overspending of local governor ("insult of the authorities"), publishing a poem in support of [[Ukraine]] ("inciting hatred"),&lt;ref name="zapretno"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://zapretno.info/?page_id=462 |title=Examples of forbidden content |publisher=Zapretno.info |date=2014 |accessdate=2014-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030004457/http://zapretno.info/?page_id=462 |archivedate=30 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = The Propaganda War: Opposition Sings Kremlin Tune on Ukraine|url = http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/in-moscow-propaganda-war-even-opposition-is-singing-kremlin-tune-a-965487.html|newspaper = Spiegel Online|date = 22 April 2014|access-date = 2015-06-10|first = Christian|last = Neef|first2 = Matthias|last2 = Schepp}}&lt;/ref&gt; an open letter against a war in Chechnya by a writer Polina Zherebcova,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Otkrytoe Pismo Hodorkovskomu o Voyne v Chechne Priznali Ekstremistskim|url = https://meduza.io/news/2015/07/08/otkrytoe-pismo-hodorkovskomu-o-voyne-v-chechne-priznali-ekstremistskim|website = meduza.io|accessdate = 2015-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; the whole [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] movement in Russia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Russian Appellate Court Decision Reverses Ban of JW.ORG Website|url = http://www.jw.org/en/news/legal/by-region/russia/appellate-court-reverses-jw-org-ban/|accessdate = 2015-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Raphael Lemkin]], and articles by initiator of the [[Genocide Convention]] of 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Федеральный список экстремистских материалов дорос до п. 3152|url = http://www.sova-center.ru/racism-xenophobia/news/counteraction/2015/11/d33272/|website = SOVA Center for Information and Analysis|accessdate = 2015-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other terms ==
Since the 1990s, in [[United States]] [[politics]] the term ''[[Sister Souljah moment]]'' has been used to describe a [[politician]]'s public repudiation of an allegedly extremist person or group, statement, or position which might otherwise be associated with his own party.

The term "[[subversive]]" was often used interchangeably, in the United States at least, with "extremist" during the [[Cold War]] period, although the two words are not synonymous.

The '''French Institute of Pondicherry''' ({{lang-fr|Institut français de Pondichéry}}) UMIFRE 21 CNRS-MAEE is a French financially autonomous institution in [[Puducherry]], [[India]], under the joint supervision of the [[Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs (France)|French Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs]] ([[Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs (France)|MAEE]]) and the [[French National Centre for Scientific Research]] ([[CNRS]]). It is a part of the network of 27 research centres connected with the French Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs. It is also part of the research unit 3330 "Savoirs et Mondes Indiens" of the CNRS, along with the [[Centre de Sciences Humaines]] (CSH) in [[New Delhi]]. It is a branch of the [[Institut français en Inde]], based in [[Delhi]].

==History==
Established under the terms of the  [[French India|Treaty of Cession of French Territories in India]], the French Institute of Pondicherry was inaugurated on 21 March 1955 under the name "Institut Français d'Indologie". It was engaged, under the leadership of its first director ([[Jean Filliozat]]), in the study of Indian civilization and culture, and more particularly in the history and the religions of [[South India]].

In the 1960s, a department of ecology was created to collect information on the conditions and evolution of the environment in South India (vegetation, soils, climate changes, etc.) with its focus on the Western Ghats, one of the world’s 34 hotspots for [[biodiversity]].

With the setting up of the department of Social Sciences in the 1980s, the institute extended its interest to the evolution and dynamics of the Indian society.

The Laboratory of Applied Informatics and Geomatics (LAIG) was set up in the 1990s.

The institute has a Centre for Documentary Resources (CDR), which came into being as the result of a major restructuring of three research libraries in Pondicherry. The centre holds data of the research conducted at the IFP, which is augmented every year through an acquisition policy. The CDR is open to the public.

''From Tradition to Modernity'', a document released on the 50th anniversary of the IFP, traces the history of the institute from its inception to the present.

[[Ganapathi Thanikaimoni|Dr. G. Thanikaimoni]], whose scientific contributions have been recognised worldwide in the field of palynology finds mention in ''Eminent Indian Botanists Past and Present''. He directed the [[palynology]] department for over 20 years and assembled one of the largest collection pollen morphology slides in the world. Dr. Thanikaimoni was a proponent for the conservation and protection of mangroves in Asia.

==Fields of research==
* [[Indology]]: Indian Society, History and Culture: Sources and Resources
* Social Sciences: Contemporary Social Dynamics
* Ecology: Environment and [[Sustainable Development]]

==Research departments==
* The Department of Indology (historical department) focuses its attention on classical India, namely its religions, its literature, its languages ([[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Sanskrit]], etc.) to better interpret and study the foundations of modern India.
* The Department of Social Sciences promotes research on the major questions of society and on the relations between human societies and their environment: social management of water, urban development, demography and social mobility, finance and debt, impact of industrialization on rural systems, diffusion of new technologies, traditional health care systems, health problems related to the spread of transmittable diseases, etc. In the framework of the USR 3330, it also engages in research on economics, international relations, and socio-political issues.
* The Department of Ecology concentrates its research on biodiversity and notably on the functioning of fragile ecosystems (forests, [[mangroves]], etc.), by considering man as an important parameter in their evolution. It conducts research that aims to understand and evaluate the biological diversity of natural ecosystems as well as those affected by human impact. This research activity has the related aim of contributing to the establishment of schemes for conservation and sustainable management of natural resources. The high priority accorded to research on palaeoenvironments has yielded a rich and varied collection of pollen.

==Scientific orientations and projects==
The institute hosts research projects spread over ten orientations:
* Indology
**Indian analyses of Sanskrit language and literature
**History of religions
**Tamil studies
* Social Sciences
**Health and societies
**Economy and societies
**Environment and societies
* Ecology
**The palaeo-environments of South India
**Application of new information technologies for strengthening of taxonomic expertise
**Biodiversity elements in the Western Ghats
**Usage of biodiversity and ecosystems modified by human activity

==Support structures for research==
Two "transversal structures" support the research departments:
* A Laboratory of Applied Informatics and [[Geomatics]], which applies its expertise in the following areas: digital mapping, use of satellite imagery, geographic information systems and modeling, [[multimedia]] promotion. It deploys its computer resources and information technologies in the institute. Its documentary collection consists of 3000 maps and several databases.
* A Centre for Documentary Resources. The computerized collection comprises 60000 books; 800 journals, of which 250 are regularly subscribed; 8500 palm-leaf manuscripts (the largest collection of texts on Saivasiddhanta in the world and registered as such in the "Memory of the World" register of the UNESCO, with the IFP being regarded as a "Manuscript Resource Centre" by the National Mission for Manuscripts of the Government of India); 1144 transcripts; and a collection of 140000 photographs, of temples and edifices in South India notably.

==Other missions==
Promotion of knowledge: The scientific knowledge at the IFP is made available in forms including publications, expertise, scientific events, library, information, and exhibits.

Training: In the framework of its research projects, the IFP welcomes PhDs and Masters level trainees of different nationalities (French, Indian, European and others).

==Publications==
The IFP's research results are circulated in publications:
* In journals to supervisory committees and in the proceedings of national and international congresses
* By the institute: book series and multimedia CD-ROM; position reports or evaluations; maps with notices on the soils and vegetation of South India.

The institute publishes a news bulletin ''Pattrika'' in collaboration with the [http://www.csh-delhi.com/ CSH] in Delhi and the EFEO (three issues per year). The institute organizes scientific events.

==The manuscripts==
With respect to its branch of research in Indology, the French Institute of Pondicherry has a collection of 8,600 Hindu religious manuscripts and similar records, forming part of India’s [[National Mission for Manuscripts]]. Comprising 8,187 ancient palm-leaf bundles, 360 paper codices and 1,144 recent paper transcripts, it is the largest collection of manuscripts primarily transmitting texts of the [[Saiva Siddhanta]] tradition of [[Hinduism]].

The collection was started in 1955 by the institute's founder-director, Jean Filliozat, who desired to explain the Hindu temple and what happens in it. The manuscripts were gathered from collections of temples, priests and monasteries across South India and brought to the institute with the intention of preserving, transcribing and translating them. Four volumes of a catalog describing in detail the contents of 4,000 texts transmitted in 475 of the palm-leaf bundles were published in 1986, 1987, 1990 and 2002. Cataloging has continued using flatbed scanning and digital photography technology in conjunction with a computerized database.

===Contents of the collection===
* Canonical texts of [[Saivism]] ([[Saiva Agamas]], also known as Tantras): 1,900 codices
* Mantra/ritual manuals: 1,890
* Devotional hymns and legends of holy places (stotra/mahatmya): 1,360
* Hindu astrology ([[Jyotisha]]): 435
* The literary epic about Rama ([[Ramayana]]): 192
* Other Sanskrit epics, myths and legends ([[Puranas]]): 230
* Traditional South Indian medicine: 198
* [[Vedas]]: 187
* Literary works in Sanskrit: 160
* Tamil devotional literature: 1,350

===Recognitions===
The collection was registered in the [[Memory of the World Programme|World Memories]] of the [[UNESCO]] in July 2005 and was declared a national treasure of India by the Indian government. The institute was declared a "Manuscripts Resource Centre" in 2004.

===Collections===
* Pollen slide collection (Dr. Thanikaimoni [[pollen]] reference slide collection): 22,000 slides in 15,000 tropical plant species.
* [[Library]] collection consists of 60 000 books, 300 theses, over 1000 articles and 800 journals of which 260 are received currently.
* [[Herbarium]] is internationally recognized and indexed index herbariorum [http://sweetgum.nybg.org/ih/herbarium.php?irn=124579] housing nearly 23,000 specimens.
* [[Photographs]] — nearly 136,000 that are a resource for visual information about South India in the second half of the 20th century, particularly its temple art.
* Nearly 3,000 maps on India and South and Southeast Asia, around 1,200 topographic maps of the Anglo-Saxon scale (1&amp;nbsp;inch/1mile) dating from the first half of the 20th century and an equal number of topographic maps at the metric scale (most of them 1/50,000 and nearly 200 sheets at 1/250,000) obtained from the Survey of India and covering most of the Indian subcontinent. Around 500 thematic maps of other South and Southeast Asian countries (vegetation, soil, geology, meteorology, etc.) at highly varying scales, mainly from the 1950s, are preserved.

==Personnel==
The personnel of the IFP consist of about 80 persons:
* Expatriate personnel on temporary assignment from the French Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs (MAEE)
* Indian researchers
* Research assistants (engineers and technicians)
* Administrative and service personnel (archivists, secretariat, maintenance personnel)

The institute welcomes researchers and research assistants on project contract and financed by outside sources, and experienced researchers and students of all nationalities, associated with projects of the institute and carrying out resident study.

==Partnership agreements==
Agreements with French institutions: In addition to the agreements with the CIRAD, the CNEARC, the EFEO, the EHESS, the EPHE, the ENGREF, the INALCO, the INRA, the IRD and the Universities of Aix-Marseille, Bordeaux, Montpellier, Paris (I, III, IV, VI, VII, X, XII), Rennes and Rouen.

Agreements with Indian institutions: There are agreements with universities, research institutes and the technical departments of governments (of forestry and of environment): Calicut University, Indian Space Research Organization, Jawaharlal Nehru University, National Mission for Manuscripts, National Remote Sensing Agency, Physical Research Laboratory, Pondicherry Institute of Linguistics and Culture, etc,

Other cooperation agreements: The IFP works in collaboration with European teams (from Belgium, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, etc.), as with teams from America and South and South-East Asia (Bangladesh, Laos, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Pakistan): [[American Institute of Indian Studies]], [[Washington and Lee University]], University of Jaffna, University of California, University of Michigan; Swarthmore College; Eastern University of Sri Lanka; University of Toronto; Autonomous University of Barcelona; Dartmouth College; Durham University; Facultés Universitaires Saint Louis; Harvard University; Institut Universitaire d’Etudes du Développement; Institut de Ciencia i Tecnologica Ambientals; Kyushu University; National Herbarium Nederland; National University of Laos; Oxford University; Pontifica Universita Gregoriana; Ruhuna University; University College; University of Copenhagen; University of Heidelberg; University of Kent; University of Leiden; University of Minnesota; University of Sussex; and Victory University.

==Means of operation==
Part of the support for research projects is given by external resources: Indian (universities, National Mission for Manuscripts, National Remote Sensing Agency, CEFIPRA); French (universities, IRD, CIRAD, EFEO, CNRS, ANR, ANRS, MEDD); international (European and American universities, European Union, World Bank, ILO, Ford Foundation, AUF).

The budget of the IFP is made up of subsidies (mainly from the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs) and external resources (contracts, etc.). The scientific programmes are in majority self-financed, the basic subsidy being unable to support them anymore. The French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) provides intangible resources (electronic library, lever effect in calls for proposals, etc.).

On a usable area of 3 000 m2 divided between a building dating from the 19th century, which was recently renovated, and a wing constructed in 2002-2003, the institute has 26 offices; three laboratories (computer, palynology, botany); two herbaria; one reading room with 30 seats; one conference room with 40 seats; rooms for the storage of documents, one of which is for the preservation of valuable collections (manuscripts and photos) and one map library; one photographic laboratory; one exhibition hall; four guest rooms.

The IFP has three vehicles; two of them are "cross-country" vehicles.

'''''Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man''''' is a book written by British geologist, [[Charles Lyell]] in 1863.  The first three editions appeared in February, April, and November 1863, respectively.  A much-revised fourth edition appeared in 1873.  '''''Antiquity of Man''''', as it was known to contemporary readers, dealt with three scientific issues that had become prominent in the preceding decade: the age of the human race, the existence of ice ages, and [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]].  Lyell used the book to reverse or modify his own long-held positions on all three issues.  The book drew sharp criticism from two of Lyell's younger colleagues – paleontologist [[Hugh Falconer]] and archaeologist [[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|John Lubbock]] – who felt that Lyell had used their work too freely and acknowledged it too sparingly.  It sold well, however, and (along with Lubbock's 1865 book ''[[Prehistoric Times]]'') helped to establish the new science of [[prehistoric archaeology]] in Great Britain.

== Background==

Lyell had been consistently skeptical of evidence for high [[human antiquity]] since the early 1830s, and distanced himself from the theory of ice ages after a brief flirtation with it in the early 1840s.  He had attacked the evolutionary ideas of [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Lamarck]] in detail in his book ''[[Principles of Geology]]''.  New developments in all three areas forced him to reconsider these positions in the late 1850s and early 1860s, and became the subject matter for ''Antiquity of Man''.

== Content ==

The section about man summed up the evidence for human antiquity that had been brought to light by British geologists in 1858-59, and integrated it with archaeological evidence from the [[Paleolithic]], [[Neolithic]], and [[Bronze Age]].

The section about glaciation integrated continental ice ages into the larger picture of the  [[Quaternary Period]] that Lyell had built up in his earlier works.

The section about evolution recapitulated Darwin's arguments and endorsed them, though not enthusiastically.  It acknowledged that human bodies might have evolved, but left open the possibility of divine intervention in the origins of human intellect and moral sense.

==Controversy ==

Hugh Falconer, a key player in the establishment of human antiquity, charged that Lyell – a minor player in the process – had misleadingly cast himself in the lead while ignoring the contributions of others.  He raised his charges in the pages of the weekly journal ''The Athenaeum'', and pressed them with a vehemence that some of his colleagues found distasteful.

John Lubbock, a young but rising scientific star and a member of Darwin's inner circle, charged that Lyell had incorporated large amounts of material that Lubbock had published in articles and was then reworking into a book of his own.  His criticism was largely private, but well known in the scientific circles in which both moved.

Lyell gradually changed the text of ''Antiquity of Man'' to blunt some of their criticisms, but throughout the process held that he had been wrongly accused.

== Impact ==

''Antiquity of Man'' had its greatest impact in the years immediately after its publication.  Lyell's presentation and endorsement of the new evidence for [[human antiquity]] firmly established the theory as scientific orthodoxy.  His integration of both ice ages and a very old human race into the (geologically) recent history of the Earth was novel for its time, as was his presentation of archaeological data that from continental Europe.  Until the early 1860s, "archaeology" had been synonymous, in England, with the study of antiquity and the Middle Ages through artifacts.  ''Antiquity of Man'' expanded it to include the study of [[prehistory]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Bowdoin Van Riper, ''Men Among the Mammoths'' (Chicago, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

The book's three-part structure meant, however, that it was quickly supplanted by more detailed works that followed in its wake.  Lubbock's ''[[Prehistoric Times]]'' (1865), Darwin's ''[[The Descent of Man]]'' (1871), [[James Archibald Geike]]'s ''[[The Great Ice Age]]'' (1874) and [[William Boyd Dawkins]]' ''[[Early Man in Britain]]'' (1880) became the standard works on the fields to which Lyell had introduced a generation of mid-Victorian readers.

[[Image:Tutanchamon (js) 3.jpg|thumb|The [[gilding|gilded]] [[throne]] of [[Pharaoh]] [[Tutankhamun]] is but one of the treasures found within his tomb.]]
'''Grave goods''', in [[archaeology]] and [[anthropology]], are the items buried along with the body.

They are usually personal possessions, supplies to smooth the deceased's journey into the afterlife or offerings to the gods. Grave goods may be classed as a type of [[votive deposit]]. Most grave goods recovered by archaeologists consist of inorganic objects such as pottery and stone and metal tools but organic objects that have since decayed were also placed in ancient tombs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ian Morris (historian)|Ian Morris]], ''Death-Ritual and Social Structure in Classical Antiquity'' (Cambridge, 1992; {{ISBN|0-521-37611-4}})&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Funerary art]] is a broad term but generally means artworks made specifically to decorate a burial place, such as miniature models of possessions including slaves or servants for "use" in the afterlife.

Where grave goods appear, [[grave robbery]] is a potential problem.  [[Etruscans]] would scratch the word ''śuθina'', [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] for "from a tomb", on grave goods buried with the dead to discourage their reuse by the living.&lt;ref&gt;[[Giuliano Bonfante]] and [[Larissa Bonfante]] ''The Etruscan Language: an Introduction'' (Univ. Manchester Press, 2002. {{ISBN|0-7190-5540-7}}); several examples collected&lt;/ref&gt;  The tomb of [[pharaoh]] [[Tutankhamun]] is famous  because it was one of the few [[Egyptian tombs]] that was not thoroughly looted in ancient times.

Grave goods can be regarded as a [[sacrifice]] intended for the benefit of the deceased in the [[afterlife]]. Closely related are customs of [[ancestor worship]] and offerings to the dead, in modern western culture related to [[All Souls' Day]] ([[Day of the Dead]]), in East Asia the  "[[hell bank note]]" and related customs.
Also closely related is the custom of [[retainer sacrifice]], where servants or wives of a deceased chieftain are interred with the body.
As the inclusion of expensive grave goods and of slaves or retainers became a sign of high status in the [[Bronze Age]], the prohibitive cost led to the development of "fake" grave goods, where artwork meant to ''depict'' grave goods or retainers is produced for the burial and deposited in the grave in place of the actual sacrifice.

==History==

[[File:Urnenbestattung HH-Marmstorf Grab 216 Modell.jpg|thumb|150px|Warrior's burial from Hamburg-Marmstorf Grave]]
There are disputed claims of [[Paleolithic burial|intentional burial]] of [[Neanderthal]]s as old as 130,000 years. Similar claims have been made for early [[anatomically modern humans]] as old as 100,000 years. The earliest undisputed cases of burials are found in modern human sites of the Upper Palaeolithic.

Beads made of [[basalt]] deposited in graves in the [[Fertile Crescent]]
date to the end of the [[Upper Paleolithic]], beginning in about the 12th to 11th millennium BC.&lt;ref&gt;The Earliest Beads, muma.org{{Clarify|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distribution of grave goods are a potential indicator of the [[social stratification]] of a society. Thus, early [[Neolithic]] graves tend to show equal distribution of goods, suggesting a more or less [[classless society]], while in [[Chalcolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] burials, rich grave goods are concentrated in "[[chieftain]]" graves ([[Tumulus|barrows]]), indicating social stratification.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. William A. Haviland, Harald E. L. Prins, Dana Walrath, Bunny McBride, ''Anthropology: The Human Challenge, Cengage Learning, 2010 {{ISBN|978-0-495-81084-1}}, p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible that burial goods indicate a level of concern and consciousness in regard to an [[afterlife]] and related sense of [[spirituality]].

==Famous grave sites==
[[File:Conical loaves of bread, Gebelein, 5th Dynasty c 2400 BC.jpg|thumb|left|[[History of bread|Conical loaves of bread]] as grave goods exactly as laid out in the Great Tomb, North Necropolis, [[Gebelein]], [[5th Dynasty]] (Old Kingdom), 2435-2305 BC. Excavations by [[Ernesto Schiaparelli]], 1911. Egyptian Museum, Turin, S. 14051-14055]]

The expression of social status in rich graves is taken to extremes in the royal graves of the Bronze Age. In the [[Theban Necropolis]] in [[Ancient Egypt]], the [[pyramids]] and the royal graves in the [[Valley of the Kings]] are among the most elaborate burials in human history. This trend is continued into the [[Iron Age]]. An example of an extremely rich royal grave of the Iron Age is the [[Terracotta Army]] of [[Qin Shi Huang]].{{Citation needed|date = March 2017}}

In the sphere of the [[Roman Empire]], [[early Christianity|early Christian]] graves lack grave goods, and grave goods tend to disappear with the [[decline of Greco-Roman polytheism]] in the 5th and 6th centuries. Similarly, the presence of grave goods in the [[Early Middle Ages]] in Europe has often been taken as evidence of [[paganism]], although during the period of conversion in [[Anglo-Saxon England]] and the [[Frankish Empire]] (7th century), the situation may be more complicated.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Geake, ''The use of grave-goods in conversion-period England, c.600-c.850'', British Archaeological Reports, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-86054-917-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the Christian Middle Ages, high-status graves are marked on the exterior, with [[tomb effigy|tomb effigies]] or expensive tomb stones rather than by the presence of grave goods.{{Citation needed|date = March 2017}}

The practice of placing grave goods with the dead body has thus an uninterrupted history beginning in the [[Upper Paleolithic]], if not the [[Middle Paleolithic]], upheld until comparatively recent times, in many regions of the world ceasing only with [[Christianization]].{{Citation needed|date = March 2017}}

==Role in archaeology==
[[File:Copper age grave group stone wristguard copper dagger bone belt fitting sittingbourne british museum.JPG|thumb|right|A [[Copper Age]] grave group including a stone wristguard, copper dagger and bone belt fitting found at [[Sittingbourne]]]]
The importance of grave goods, from the simple behavioural and technical to the metaphysical,  in [[archaeology]] cannot be overestimated.
Because of their almost ubiquitous presence throughout the world and throughout prehistory, in many cases the excavation of every-day items placed in burials is the main source of such artifacts in a given prehistoric culture. 
However, care must be taken to avoid naive interpretation of grave goods as an objective sample of artifacts in use in a culture. Because of their ritual context, grave goods may represent a special class of artifacts, in some instances produced especially for burial. 
Artwork produced for the burial itself is known as [[funerary art]], while grave goods in the narrow sense are items produced for actual use that are placed in the grave, but in practice the two categories overlap.

Grave goods in Bronze Age and Iron Age cemeteries are a good indicator of relative [[social status]]; 
in a 2001 study on an [[Iron Age Italy|Iron Age]] cemetery in [[Pontecagnano Faiano]], Italy, a correlation was found between the quality of grave goods and  [[Forensic science|Forensic]] indicators on the skeletons, showing that skeletons in wealthy tombs tended to show substantially less evidence of biological stress during adulthood, with fewer broken bones or signs of hard labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=John |last=Robb |first2=Renzo |last2=Bigazzi |first3=Luca |last3=Lazzarini |first4=Caterina |last4=Scarsini |first5=Fiorenza |last5=Sonego |title=Social status and biological status: A comparison of grave goods and skeletal indicators from Pontecagnano |journal=[[American Journal of Physical Anthropology]] |volume=115 |issue=3 |pages=213–222 |year=2001 |doi=10.1002/ajpa.1076 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15028">In the 1960s, [[linguistics|linguistic]] [[anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Charles F. Hockett]] defined a set of features that characterize [[human language]] and set it apart from [[animal communication]]. He called these characteristics the design features of language. Hockett originally believed there to be 13 design features. While [[primate]] communication utilizes the first 9 features, the final 4 features ([[displacement (linguistics)|displacement]], [[productivity (linguistics)|productivity]], [[traditional transmission|cultural transmission]], and [[double articulation|duality]]) are reserved for humans.  Hockett later added prevarication, [[reflexiveness]], and learnability to the list as uniquely human characteristics. He asserted that even the most basic human languages possess these 16 features.

== Charles Hockett ==



Charles Hockett was an American linguist and anthropologist, who lived from 1916 to 2000. Hockett graduated from [[Yale University|Yale]] in 1939, and later taught at both [[Cornell University|Cornell]] and [[Rice University|Rice]]. Hockett made significant contributions to [[structural linguistics]], as well as the study of Native American, Chinese, and Fijian languages.  His work focused on detailed linguistic analysis, particularly [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and [[phonology]], and on the concepts and tools that facilitated such analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Kemmer, Suzanne.  Biographical sketch of Charles Hockett. 23 February 2008. Retrieved 12 May 2013 from http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~kemmer/Found/hockettbio&lt;/ref&gt;
Up until the 1950s, language was largely viewed as a social-behavioral phenomenon. Hockett was challenged in this belief by Noam Chomsky, who suggested that language is biologically-based and innately learned.  He believed that humans share a [[universal grammar]] that ties all languages together.  Hockett staunchly opposed this "Chomskyan" concept of the nature of language. However, Hockett is most famous for defining what he called the design features of language, which demonstrate his beliefs about the commonalities between human languages.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Margalit. "Charles Hockett, 84, Linguist With an Anthropological View," The New York Times. 13 November 2000. Retrieved 12 May 2013 from https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/13/arts/charles-hockett-84-linguist-with-an-anthropological-view.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design features of language ==

'''[[Vocal-auditory channel]]'''.
Refers to the idea that speaking/hearing is the mode humans use for language.  When Hockett first defined this feature, it did not take [[sign language]] into account, which reflects the ideology of orality that was prevalent during the time (See, for instance, the argumentation of Christin, 1995) {{citation needed|date=June 2015}}.  This feature has since been modified to include other channels of language, such as tactile-visual or chemical-olfactory.

'''Broadcast transmission and directional reception'''
When humans speak, sounds are transmitted in all directions; however, listeners perceive the direction from which the sounds are coming. Similarly, signers broadcast to potentially anyone within the line of sight, while those watching see who is signing.  This is characteristic of most forms of human and animal communication.

'''Transitoriness'''
Also called rapid fading, transitoriness refers to the idea of temporary quality of language.  Language sounds exist for only a brief period of time, after which they are no longer perceived.  Sound waves quickly disappear once a speaker stops speaking.  This is also true of signs.  In contrast, other forms of communication such as writing and [[Quipu|Inka khipus]] (knot-tying) are more permanent.

[[File:Dfl.jpg|thumb]]

'''Interchangeability'''
Refers to the idea that humans can give and receive identical linguistic signals; humans are not limited in the types of messages they can say/hear. One can say "I am a boy" even if one is a girl.  This is not to be confused with lying (prevarication).  The importance is that a speaker can physically create any and all messages regardless of their truth or relation to the speaker. In other words, anything that one can hear, one can also say.

Not all species possess this feature. For example, in order to communicate their status, [[queen ant]]s produce chemical scents that no other ants can produce (see animal communication below).

'''Total feedback'''
Speakers of a language can hear their own speech and can control and modify what they are saying as they say it. Similarly, singers see, feel, and control their singing.

'''Specialization'''
The purpose of linguistic signals is communication and not some other biological function.  When humans speak or sign, it is generally intentional.

An example of ''non''-specialized communication is dog panting.  When a dog pants, it often communicates to its owner that it is hot or thirsty; however, the dog pants in order to cool itself off. This is a biological function, and the communication is a secondary matter.

'''[[Semanticity]]'''
Specific sound signals are directly tied to certain meanings.

'''[[Arbitrariness]]''' ** languages are generally made up of both arbitrary and iconic symbols.  In spoken languages this takes the form of onomatopoeias.  In English "murmur", in Mandarin "māo" (cat).  In ASL "cup", "me" "up/down", etc.  
There is no intrinsic or logical connection between a sound form (signal) and its meaning.  Whatever name a human language attributes an object is purely arbitrary. The word "car" is nothing like an actual car.  Spoken words are really nothing like the objects they represent.  This is further demonstrated by the fact that different languages attribute very different names to the same object.

Signed languages are transmitted visually and this allows for a certain degree of iconicity. For example, in the [[ASL]] sign HOUSE, the hands are flat and touch in a way that resembles the roof and walls of a house.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. William Vicars.  **This sign can be non-iconic if said house is not shaped like that.  Depicting Verbs (formerly thought to be classifiers and often still are by people who are not up on linguistics) are meant to modify (give more information about) the actual visual appearance or process.  E.g. The sign used for the generic idea of "box" is different from the one used for "PO box" because the latter has specific shapes that often do not conform to other items sharing this label.  The sign and depicting verb for "tree" does not encompass bamboo trees for example.**

American Sign Language University. (n.d.) Retrieved 12 May 2013 from http://lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-signs/h/house.htm&lt;/ref&gt; However, many other signs are not iconic, and the relationship between form and meaning is arbitrary. Thus, while Hockett did not account for the possibility of non-arbitrary form-meaning relationships, the principle still generally applies.  

'''[[Digital infinity|Discreteness]]'''
Linguistic representations can be broken down into small discrete units which combine with each other in rule-governed ways. They are perceived categorically, not continuously. For example, English marks number with the plural [[morpheme]] /s/, which can be added to the end of any noun. The plural morpheme is perceived categorically, not continuously: we cannot express smaller or larger quantities by varying how loudly we pronounce the /s/. 

'''[[Displacement (linguistics)|Displacement]]'''
Refers to the idea that humans can talk about things that are not physically present or that do not even exist. Speakers can talk about the past and the future, and can express hopes and dreams. A human's speech is not limited to here and now. Displacement is one of the features that separates human language from other forms of primate communication.

'''[[Productivity (linguistics)|Productivity]]'''
Refers to the idea that language-users can create and understand novel utterances. Humans are able to produce an unlimited amount of utterances. Also related to productivity is the concept of grammatical patterning, which facilitates the use and comprehension of language.  Language is not stagnant, but is constantly changing. New [[idiom]]s are created all the time and the meaning of signals can vary depending on the context and situation.

'''[[Traditional transmission]]'''
Also called cultural transmission.  While humans are born with innate language capabilities, language is learned after birth in a social setting.  Children learn how to speak by interacting with experienced language users. Language and culture are woven together.

'''[[Duality of patterning]]'''
Meaningful messages are made up of distinct smaller meaningful units (words and [[Morpheme|morphemes]]) which themselves are made up of distinct smaller, meaningless units ([[Phoneme|phonemes]]).

'''[[wikt:prevarication|Prevarication]]'''
Prevarication is the ability to lie or deceive.  When using language, humans can make false or meaningless statements.

'''[[Reflexiveness]]'''
Humans can use language to talk about language.

'''[[Language acquisition|Learnability]]'''
Language is teachable and learnable. In the same way as a speaker learns their first language, the speaker is able to learn other languages. It is worth noting that young children learn language with competence and ease; however, language acquisition is constrained by a [[Critical period hypothesis|critical period]] such that it becomes more difficult once children pass a certain age.

== Design features in animal communication ==

Hockett distinguished language from communication.  While almost all animals communicate in some way, a communication system is only considered language if it possesses ''all'' of the above characteristics.  Some animal communication systems are impressively sophisticated.

=== Ants ===

Ants make use of the chemical-olfactory channel of communication. Ants produce chemicals called [[pheromone]]s, which are released through body glands and received by the tips of the antenna.  Ants can produce up to twenty different pheromone scents, each a unique signal used to communicate things such as the location of food and danger, or even the need to defend or relocate the colony. When an ant is killed, it releases a pheromone that alerts others of potential danger. Pheromones also help ants distinguish family members from strangers. The queen ant has special pheromones which she uses to signal her status, orchestrate work, and let the colony know when they need to raise princesses or drones.&lt;ref&gt;Chemical pheromone communication between ants. antARK, 2010. Retrieved 11 May 2013 from http://www.antark.net/ant-life/ant-communication/pheromones.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Ants will even engage in warfare to protect the colony or a food source. This warfare involves tactics that resemble human warfare.  Marauder ants will capture and hold down an enemy while another ant crushes it. Ants are loyal to their colony to the death; however, the queen will kill her own in order to be the last one standing. This level of "planning" among an animal species requires an intricate communication.&lt;ref&gt;Moffett, Mark W. Battles among ants resemble human warfare, ''Scientific American''. 8 January 2012. Retrieved 13 May 2013 from http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=ants-and-the-art-of-war&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Birds ===

Bird communication demonstrates many features, including the vocal-auditory channel, broadcast transmission/directional reception, rapid fading, semanticity, and arbitrariness. Bird communication is divided into songs and calls. Songs are used primarily to attract mates, while calls are used to alert of food and danger and coordinate movement with the flock.  Calls are acoustically simple, while songs are longer and more complex.&lt;ref&gt;Duhamel, D. (October 2009). Retrieved from http://people.eku.edu/ritchisong/birdcommunication.html&lt;/ref&gt; Bird communication is both discrete and non-discrete. Birds use syntax to arrange their songs, where musical notes act as [[phonemes]]. The order of the notes is important to the meaning of the song, thus indicating that discreteness exists. Bird communication is also continuous in the sense that it utilizes duration and frequency. However, the fact that birds have "phonemes" does not necessarily mean that they can combine them in an infinite way. Birds have a limited number of songs that they can produce.  The male [[indigo bunting]] only has one song, while the [[brown thrasher]] can sing over 2000 songs.&lt;ref&gt;All About Birds: Vocal Development. Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology. (n.d.) Retrieved 11 May 2013 from  http://www.birds.cornell.edu/AllAboutBirds/studying/birdsongs/vocaldev&lt;/ref&gt; Birds even have unique dialects, depending on where they are from.&lt;ref&gt;CJ Kazilek, David Pearson and Pierre Deviche. "Birds and their songs", Ask a Biologist. Arizona State University. (n.d) Retrieved 11 May 2013 from http://askabiologist.asu.edu/explore/birds-and-their-songs&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Honeybees ===

Honeybee communication is distinct from other forms of animal communication.  Rather than vocal-auditory, bees use the space-movement channel to communicate. Honeybees use two kinds of dances to communicate—the round dance and the [[waggle dance]].  They use the round dance to communicate that food is 50–75 meters from the hive.  They use the waggle dance when it is farther than this.  To do the waggle dance, a bee moves in a zig-zag line and then does a loop back to the beginning of the line, forming a figure-eight.  The direction of the line points to the food.  The speed of the dance indicates the distance to the food.&lt;ref&gt;Honeybee Communication. 19 March 2012. Retrieved 11 May 2013 from http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/B/BeeDances.html&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, bee dancing is also continuous, rather than discrete.  Their communication is also not arbitrary.  They move in a direction and pattern that physically points out where food is located.

Honeybee dancing also demonstrates displacement, which is generally considered a human characteristic.  Most animals will only give a food-found call in the physical presence of food, yet bees can talk about food that is over 100 meters away.

It was first published in 2009. The anthology contains an introduction by Cart, 11 short stories, and one novella by acclaimed [[lesbian]] and gay authors.&lt;ref name="Chow"&gt;[http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/article/CA6685844.html Chow, Amy J.

==Contents==
The anthology contains an introduction by editor Michael Cart, and the 12 stories. Cart's six-page introduction declares the theme of the anthology to be "what it might mean to be gay, lesbian, or transgender."&lt;ref&gt;Cart, Michael. "Introduction." In ''How Beautiful the Ordinary: Twelve Stories of Identity.'' Michael Cart, ed. New York: HarperTeen, 2009, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction introduces each author, briefly describes their story entry, and provides a very brief note about how the story confronts the concept of [[sexual identity]]. Three stories feature [[transgender]] characters, and two explore how [[nationality]] and [[language barrier]]s interact with sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Kirkus" /&gt; Most of the stories are written from the perspective of people in their late teens or 20s.&lt;ref name="Kirkus" /&gt;

The title of the anthology is taken from [[David Levithan]]'s short story, "A Word From the Nearly Distant Past," which is the first short story in the book: "He has no idea how beautiful the ordinary becomes once it disappears."&lt;ref&gt;Levithan, David. "A Word From the Nearly Distant Past." In ''How Beautiful the Ordinary: Twelve Stories of Identity.'' Michael Cart, ed. New York: HarperTeen, 2009, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The short stories in the book are:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
*'''"A Word From the Nearly Distant Past" by David Levithan'''—Written as if it were a message from gay men in the past to gay teens today, this story is told in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]. The unnamed narrators (the plural pronoun "we" is used throughout the work) describe how a few young men are seen in the present going to a boyfriend's house, dancing alone, attending an LGBTQ [[prom]], etc. The narrators express knowledge about how these young men feel, and urge them to live life fully. The story is 13 pages long. David Levithan wrote the novel Two Boys Kissing as a full-length version of this story.
*'''"Happily Ever After" by [[Eric Shanower]]'''—This short story is told in [[Comics|comic book]] format. Two high school teenage boys seem to be in love, but their relationship is in trouble because Mark has difficulty accepting he is gay. The two discover a [[genie]] (the comically named Genie-Fouadi-Wadi-Wasr-Ras-Daroun-Boun-Ali-Meht-Ma-Hani-Pal the Perspicacious) in a bottle who grants them each a wish. The unnamed narrator wants Mark to love him, but a horrified Mark demands that the genie remove his homosexuality. The genie grants each teen his wish. Three years pass. Both men (now in college) are miserable, but because "when a genie grants a wish, it comes true"&lt;ref&gt;Shanower, Eric. "Happily Ever After." In ''How Beautiful the Ordinary: Twelve Stories of Identity.'' Michael Cart, ed. New York: HarperTeen, 2009, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; the genie must intervene again. The story is 13 pages long.
*'''"My Life As A Dog" by Ron Koertge'''—At first, this is a [[Fantasy literature|fantasy story]] told in the first-person singular by Noah, a dog with very human emotions and intelligence. But at points throughout the story, the text changes to look like a screenplay. The screenplay describes a teenage boy, Noah, who has apparently been hit by a car. Noah has quarrelsome parents, and his father is particularly [[Homophobia|homophobic]]. The screenplay-like text reveals that Noah is [[closeted]] and has a boyfriend, Robbie, who is not. Noah and Robbie quarrel over whether Noah should [[Coming out|come out]], but Noah refuses because his father already treats him like a dog. The reality of Noah's situation becomes apparent through the story, as well as the truth about Noah's accident. The short story is 26 pages long.
*'''"Trev" by [[Jacqueline Woodson]]'''—Trev Louis Johnson is a six-year-old transgender boy. He is biologically female but already Trev knows he is a boy. Trev knows he is "wrong down there"&lt;ref&gt;Woodson, Jacqueline. "Trev." In ''How Beautiful the Ordinary: Twelve Stories of Identity.'' Michael Cart, ed. New York: HarperTeen, 2009, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; but his father and brother have a great deal of difficulty handling Trev's gender identity. Trev himself struggles to understand his gender as he begins first grade, and learns the story of his great-aunt Dane. This story is nine pages long.
*'''"My Virtual World" by [[Francesca Lia Block]]'''—Primarily written as a series of e-mails from "Boy Blue" to "Ms. R.E." (e.g., misery), this story tells about the growing friendship between Garret and Rebecca, two people who have never met and communicate primarily online. Over the course of the emails, Garret reveals that he is a [[transsexual]] who was born female, and who may have attempted suicide. Rebecca also has a secret (revealed in part at the end of the story), and has engaged in [[Self-harm|cutting]]. The two emotionally troubled people bond, with their future revealed in a traditionally-written narrative text. The short story is 13 pages long.
*'''"A Dark Red Love Knot" by [[Margo Lanagan]]'''—Tom Coyne is an English teenager living in the past (possibly the 17th century). He works as a [[Hostler|stableboy]] at a local inn. The [[first-person narrative]] briefly describes how Tom saw Bess (the innkeeper's daughter) meeting with her lover (a handsome [[highwayman]]) one night in the stables. Tom tells how he recently lost his sexual virginity to a soldier in the King's army. Desiring to see his lover again, Tom tells the innkeeper about his daughter's sexual indiscretion in the hopes this will bring the King's men to the inn. Consumed only by his own desire to see his soldier, Tom does not consider the consequences of his actions (which lead to tragedy). The short story is 29 pages long.
*'''"Fingernail" by [[William Sleator]]'''—Lep is a young [[Thai people|Thai]] with little education who speaks no English. Although he has had homosexual sex with other Thai men, it is unsatisfying to him. He meets Bernard, a French tourist. They make love and spend much time together. Bernard returns to France, and Lep works hard to learn English. Bernard returns to [[Thailand]], but Lep realizes Bernard is insanely [[Jealousy|jealous]]. He accuses Lep of having sex with other men all the time, and one night tries to smother him in bed. Lep forgives Bernard. Bernard's jealousy worsens. After a final act of treachery, Lep refuses to see Bernard any longer. Lep must decided whether his love for Bernard was real, and whether knowing Bernard was worth it. The story is told in [[Non-native pronunciations of English|broken English]], as if written by a non-native speaker of English. The story is 22 pages long.
*'''"Dyke March" by [[Ariel Schrag]]'''—Told in comic book format, this short story depicts the major events that occur every half hour one evening as an unnamed lesbian attends a [[pride parade]]. Various events occur (planning for the parade, [[Text messaging|texting]] friends, dancing, etc.) and she experiences various emotions (eagerness, [[paranoia]], awe, hunger, etc.). Her ability to deal with the things she sees and experiences, conveyed comically and primarily in visual form, is the basis of the story. This story is five pages long, and is the shortest in the book.
*'''"The Missing Person" by [[Jennifer Finney Boylan]]'''—Written in the first-person, the narrator of this story, Jimmy, is a boy who, during the summer between the [[Eighth grade|eighth]] and [[ninth grade]], decides he wants to be a girl. The story describes "Jenny's" first experience as she dresses in girls' clothing that belongs to her older sister and goes to a local [[fair]]. A [[subplot]] about a [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] [[Student exchange program|exchange student]] who becomes trapped in a wall [[Framing device|bookends]] the narrative, providing a [[metaphor]] for what the transsexual narrator feels. The story is 18 pages long.
*'''"First Time" by Julie Ann Peters'''—Jesi and Nicolle are two lesbians about to have their first sexual encounter. The short story is told in the first-person narrative by both people. The text is split into two [[Column (typography)|columns]], with Jesi's narrative on the left and Nicolle's on the right.  Each girl remembers important things which have happened during their relationship (such as the first time they hugged) as they prepare to engage in sex, engage in [[foreplay]], and consummate the sex act.  The text is somewhat sexually explicit (primarily the description of body parts).&lt;ref name="Chow" /&gt; The story is 31 pages long.
*'''"Dear Lang" by [[Emma Donoghue]]'''—This short story is written in the form of a letter from a 40-year-old [[Dyke (slang)|dyke]] (a masculine lesbian) to her 16-year-old daughter, Lang. The woman reveals that she used to be [[Same-sex marriage|partnered]] with Lang's mother, Cheryl. Cheryl received [[artificial insemination]] and gave birth to Lang when the narrator was 24 years old. Two years later, the two women's relationship ended and Cheryl won [[child custody|custody]] of Lang. The narrator reveals much of her own life story and her current situation through the letter, and talks about the hopes she has as a parent for both Lang and for her own child (her current partner is pregnant). The story is 35 pages long.
*'''"The Silk Road Runs Through Tupperneck, N.H." by [[Gregory Maguire]]'''—Faroukh Rahmani is an 18-year-old [[Iranian American]]. In danger of losing his college scholarship after failing a class, he takes a make-up summer course in music at the fictional Tupperneck College in Tupperneck, [[New Hampshire]]. He meets the impossibly handsome, muscular, and talented Blaise D'Anjou, a [[French American]] music student. Faroukh struggles with poverty, family relationships, and his own sexual desire for the emotionally cold, distant Blaise. But the revelation of a tragedy in Blaise's family brings the two men together. This first-person narrative is interspersed with a [[Narrative mode#Third-person view|third-person singular]] narrative, describing events 15 years later as Faroukh brings his two young children to New Hampshire to attend a concert at Tupperneck College. The sacrifices a gay person makes for one's family, in the face of tragedy, and to secure a career form the basis of both narratives, which are tied together at the end of the novella. The story is 117 pages long.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Critical reception==
A review in the ''[[School Library Journal]]'' called the anthology "refreshing" and chose the stories by Lanagan and Maguire.&lt;ref name="Chow" /&gt; The review cited the main character in William Sleator's "Fingernail" as "compelling", and said Ron Koertge's "My Life as a Dog" contained "an ingenious metaphor for coming out".&lt;ref name="Chow" /&gt; ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' concluded that the book contained "&lt;nowiki&gt;[p]&lt;/nowiki&gt;rovocative, quality content."&lt;ref name="Kirkus" /&gt; The journal cited Shanower's "Happily Ever After" and Block's "My Virtual World" as the best stories in the collection.&lt;ref name="Kirkus" /&gt; Reviewer Gillian Engberg, writing in ''Booklist'', found the experimentation in narrative styles "inventive" and the stories "raw &lt;nowiki&gt;[and]&lt;/nowiki&gt; moving", and concluded the anthology was "a groundbreaking addition to young-adult literature".&lt;ref name="Engberg" /&gt; Erin Williams, reviewing the book of the [[Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays|PFLAG]] National Blog, found the collection "unique" because "...the stories vary from spiritually philosophical to personal histories to comic strips—all dealing with teen GLBT experiences."&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.pflag.org/2009/11/book-review-how-beautiful-ordinary.html Williams, Erin. "Book Review: ''How Beautiful the Ordinary''."] [[Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays|PFLAG]] National Blog. November 12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Immigration Reform and Control Act''' ('''IRCA'''), {{USStatute|99|603|100|3445|1986|11|6}}, also known as the '''Simpson–Mazzoli Act''' or the '''Reagan Amnesty''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailysignal.com/2017/10/08/what-trump-could-learn-from-the-reagan-immigration-amnesty/|publisher=[[The Daily Signal]]|date=October 8, 2017|accessdate=January 9, 2018|title=What Trump Could Learn From the Reagan Immigration Amnesty|author=Fred Lucas}}&lt;/ref&gt; signed into law by Ronald Reagan on November 6, 1986, is an [[Law of the United States|Act of Congress]] which reformed [[United States]] [[immigration law]]. The Act&lt;ref&gt;Coutin, Susan Bibler. 2007. Nation of Emigrants. Cornell University Press, Ithaca, NY. pg 179&lt;/ref&gt;

* required employers to attest to their employees' immigration status;
* made it illegal to hire or recruit [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigrants]] knowingly;
* legalized certain seasonal agricultural undocumented immigrants, and;
* legalized undocumented immigrants who entered the United States before January 1, 1982 and had resided there continuously with the penalty of a fine, back taxes due, and admission of guilt; candidates were required to prove that they were not guilty of crimes, that they were in the country before January 1, 1982, and that they possessed at least a minimal knowledge about U.S. history, government, and the English language.

At the time, the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] estimated that about four million illegal immigrants would apply for legal status through the act and that roughly half of them would be eligible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= U.S. Migrant Law Falls Hard On Jobless in Central Mexico |first= William |last= Branigin |work= The Washington Post |date= March 3, 1987 |page= A1 |url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/139205337 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislative background and description==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2010}}
[[Romano L. Mazzoli]] was a Democratic representative from [[Kentucky]] and [[Alan K. Simpson]] was a Republican senator from [[Wyoming]] who chaired their respective immigration subcommittees in Congress. Their effort was assisted by the recommendations of the bipartisan Commission on Immigration Reform, chaired by Rev. [[Theodore Hesburgh]], then President of the [[University of Notre Dame]].

The law criminalized the act of engaging in a "pattern or practice" of knowingly hiring an "[[alien (law)|unauthorized alien]]"&lt;ref&gt;See section 101 of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, amending the Immigration and Nationality Act to create a new section 274A, codified as 8 U.S.C. section 1324a.&lt;/ref&gt; and established [[Fine (penalty)|financial]] and [[criminal punishment|other penalties]] for those employing [[illegal immigrants]] under the theory that low prospects for [[employment]] would reduce undocumented immigration. Regulations promulgated under the Act introduced the [[I-9 (form)|I-9 form]] to ensure that all employees presented documentary proof of their legal eligibility to accept employment in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;8 C.F.R. sec. 274a.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

These sanctions would apply only to employers that had more than three employees and did not make a sufficient effort to determine the legal status of their workers.

The first Simpson–Mazzoli Bill was reported out of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees. The bill failed to be received by the House, but civil rights advocates were concerned over the potential for abuse and discrimination against Hispanics, growers' groups rallied for additional provisions for foreign labor, and the [[U.S. Chamber of Commerce]] persistently opposed sanctions against employers.

The second Simpson–Mazzoli Bill finally passed both chambers in 1985, but it came apart in the conference committee over the issue of cost. The year marked an important turning point for the reform effort. Employer opposition to employer sanctions began to subside, partly because of the "affirmative defense" clause in the law that explicitly released employers from any obligation to check the authenticity of workers' documents.

Also, agricultural employers shifted their focus from opposition to employer sanctions to a concerted campaign to secure alternative sources of foreign labor. As opposition to employer sanctions waned and growers' lobbying efforts for extensive temporary worker programs intensified, agricultural worker programs began to outrank employer sanctions component as the most controversial element of reform.

===Reagan Executive Action===

The Immigration Reform and Control Act did not address the status of children of illegal aliens who were eligible for the amnesty program. In 1987 President Reagan used his executive authority to legalize the status of minor children of parents granted amnesty under the immigration overhaul,&lt;ref name="politifact"&gt;John Kruzel, "[http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/sep/08/al-franken/did-reagan-and-hw-bush-issue-orders-similar-daca-a/ Did Reagan and H.W. Bush issue actions similar to DACA, as Al Franken said?"], Politifact, September 8th, 2017. Retrieved 12 June 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; announcing a blanket deferral of deportation for children under 18 who were living in a two-parent household with both parents legalizing, or with a single parent who was legalizing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/sites/default/files/research/executive_grants_of_temporary_immigration_relief_1956-present_final_0.pdf Executive Grants of Temporary Immigration Relief, 1956-Present], American Immigration Council, October 2014.  Retrieved 12 June 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; This action affected an estimated 100,000 families.

==Impact==

===On labor market===
According to one study, the IRCA caused some employers to discriminate against workers who appeared foreign, resulting in a small reduction in overall Hispanic employment. There is no statistical evidence that a reduction in employment correlated to unemployment in the economy as a whole or was separate from the general unemployment population statistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lowell|first=Lindsay|author2=Jay Teachman|author3=Zhongren Jing|date=November 1995|title=Unintended Consequences of Immigration Reform: Discrimination and Hispanic Employment|journal=Demography|publisher=Population Association of America|volume=32|issue=4|pages=617–628|doi=10.2307/2061678|jstor=2061678}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2007-11-29--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Another study stated that if hired, wages were being lowered to compensate employers for the perceived risk of hiring foreigners.&lt;ref name="Massey"&gt;{{cite book

|chapter= Chapter 4: Building a Better Underclass 
|isbn= 0-87154-585-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hiring process also changed as employers turned to indirect hiring through [[subcontractors]].  "Under a subcontracting agreement, a U.S. citizen or resident alien contractually agrees with an employer to provide a specific number of workers for a certain period of time to undertake a defined task at a fixed rate of pay per worker".&lt;ref name="Massey"/&gt;  "By using a subcontractor the firm is not held liable since the workers are not employees. The use of a subcontractor decreases a worker's wages since a portion is kept by the subcontractor. This indirect hiring is imposed on everyone regardless of legality".&lt;ref name="Massey"/&gt;

===On illegal immigration===
{{expand section|date=February 2014}}
There have been various law changes over the years that encouraged immigrants to enter or exit the United States. With the railroad, World War II, and agricultural work force demands, many immigrants saw the opportunity to come to the United States temporarily for money or a better life. An increase in legal immigrants migrating to the United States also led to an increase of illegal aliens, especially from Mexico. Most of these immigrants searched for and gained jobs where hard labor was needed. As the immigration population increased American citizens started to worry about their impact on the economy. 

The reform did not have a lot of impact on decreasing the immigrant population, "Until 2012, there was virtually no movement in Congress to deal with the problem of the 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States since the passage of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which granted amnesty to many of the 3.2 million illegal immigrants living in the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Immigration Policy|url=http://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/sharpecw/immigration_policy/0?searchId=86d60452-a2cf-11e4-8309-0aea1e24c1ac&amp;result=8|website=credorefernce.com|publisher=Roger Chapman and James Ciment}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1983, the Supreme Court forbade schools and hospitals to deny services based on undocumented immigration status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Orchowski |first1=Margaret |title=How Hispanics Influenced The Law That Changed The Fact Of America |url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1720966131 |website=Proquest.com |publisher=[[The Hispanic Outlook in Higher Education]] |accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== On crime ===
One study finds that the legalization of three million immigrants reduced crime by 3-5%, primarily property crime.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Effects of Immigrant Legalization on Crime †|url = http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.p20151041|journal = American Economic Review|pages = 210–213|volume = 105|issue = 5|doi = 10.1257/aer.p20151041|first = Scott R.|last = Baker}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author finds that this is due to greater job market opportunities for the immigrants.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Elon Musk - The Summit 2013.jpg|thumb|[[Elon Musk]], South-African Founder of [[SpaceX]] and CEO of [[Tesla Motors]]]]
The '''International Entrepreneur Rule''' is a regulation by [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services|U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services]] [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services|(USCIS)]] to increase the presence of foreign entrepreneurship in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Federal Register, Volume 82, number 10|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|date=January 17, 2017|id=RIN 1615-AC04 |pp=5238–5289|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/01/17/2017-00481/international-entrepreneur-rule}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this rule, qualified foreign entrepreneurs are granted temporary parole to the U.S. in order to build and scale their businesses. Foreign entrepreneurs wishing to enter or remain in the country to build their business operations must meet certain criteria that are reviewed on a case by case basis by the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security (DHS).]] Unlike the [[Startup Visa]], this rule does not need to be approved by Congress. The American public was allowed to comment on the proposed rule for 45 days,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/08/31/2016-20663/international-entrepreneur-rule|title=International Entrepreneur Rule|date=2016-08-31|newspaper=Federal Register|access-date=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the final rule was published in January 2017 and implemented in December 2017 after a federal court order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.uscis.gov/news/news-releases/uscis-begin-accepting-applications-under-international-entrepreneur-rule|title=USCIS to Begin Accepting Applications under the International Entrepreneur Rule|newspaper=USCIS|access-date=2018-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Department of Homeland Security estimates that 2,940 entrepreneurs will be granted parole to the U.S. each year.

== Background – The impact of foreign entrepreneurs in the U.S. economy ==
León Rodríguez, Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services at the time the International Entrepreneur Rule was published, stated, “America’s economy has long benefitted from the contributions of immigrant entrepreneurs, from Main Street to [[Silicon Valley]]”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/blog/2016/08/26/obama-administration-announces-new-steps-welcome-international-entrepreneurs|title=Obama Administration Announces New Steps to Welcome International Entrepreneurs {{!}} Homeland Security|website=www.dhs.gov|access-date=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, immigrant entrepreneurs have played a pivotal role in developing the U.S. economy, particularly in the technology sector. In the years of 1998-2006, 14.76% of all [[patent application]]s in the United States had at least one immigrant involved as a lone or co-founder, with the majority of these patents having roots in California and New Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://seipa.edu.pl/s/p/artykuly/90/906/High%20tech%20entrepreneurs%20immigrants.pdf|title=America’s New Immigrant Entrepreneurs|last=Wadhwa|first=Vivek|date=4 January 2007|website=|publisher=|access-date=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all American technology and engineering businesses created in the U.S. between 1995-2005, one-quarter of them had an immigrant as a key founder. In 2012, immigrant tech-founded companies employed over 550,000 people and generated close to 70 billion dollars in sales. Over 40% of current Fortune 500 companies were established by immigrants or children of immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kauffman.org/what-we-do/resources/entrepreneurship-policy-digest/the-economic-case-for-welcoming-immigrant-entrepreneurs|title=The Economic Case for Welcoming Immigrant Entrepreneurs|access-date=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Obama’s last State of the Union Address summarized the importance of international entrepreneurs in the US: “America is every immigrant and entrepreneur from Boston to Austin to Silicon Valley, racing to shape a better world. That’s who we are.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/01/12/remarks-president-barack-obama-–-prepared-delivery-state-union-address|title=State of the Union, 2016.|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Initial parole requirements ==
A foreign entrepreneur that wishes to remain in or enter the U.S. for the first time to establish their business can submit their parole application to USCIS for review. Applications will be reviewed on a case by case basis. Entrepreneurs that meet the criteria may be granted a stay of 30 months to run their companies in the U.S. This temporary legal stay in the country, or "parole," falls under the same umbrella that is already applied to court witnesses and certain other individuals living outside the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/humanitarian-or-significant-public-benefit-parole-individuals-outside-united-states|title=Humanitarian or Significant Public Benefit Parole for Individuals Outside the United States|newspaper=USCIS|access-date=2018-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreigners are allowed to enter the U.S. on “urgent humanitarian” needs, or in the case of “significant public benefit”.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://qz.com/767906/international-entrepreneur-rule-parole-for-foreigners/|title=Silicon Valley may finally get special approval it always wanted for founders to enter the US|last=Coren|first=Michael J.|newspaper=Quartz|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The requirements for the entrepreneurs which will equate to the potential of significant public benefit are as follows:
# Must own at least 10% of the startup and play a prominent role in the startup’s operations.
# The entrepreneur’s startup must have been formed in the U.S. in the preceding five years before applying.
# The startup displays the potential to have accelerated growth and benefit the U.S. economy with the creation of jobs. This potential is indicated by:
* "Receiving significant investment of capital (at least $250,000) from certain qualified U.S. investors with established records of successful investments in the 18 months before applying."
* "Receiving significant awards or grants (at least $100,000) from certain federal, state or local government entities."
* "Partially satisfying one or both of the above criteria in addition to other reliable and compelling evidence of the startup entity’s substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation."&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/humanitarian-parole/international-entrepreneur-parole|title=International Entrepreneur Parole|newspaper=USCIS|access-date=2018-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Re-parole requirements ==
Founders granted the initial 30 months of parole will have the opportunity to extend their stay in the United States for up to 30 additional months. The company’s progress as judged by its investment, job creation and revenue numbers will be the determining factors which will decide whether the additional parole will be granted or not.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;

== Initial limitations of the International Entrepreneur Rule ==
Startups run by immigrant entrepreneurs on a parole status will have hurdles to overcome that startups run by legal U.S. residents will never encounter. Five years (2.5 years of initial parole with the 2.5 years additional granted) is not a very long period of time in terms of startups. [[IPO]]-track startups take typically seven years to exit, with many taking over a decade. The first two years are extremely important and will increase founders’ pressure to achieve high growth in the first two years. This could negatively impact business operations and put these startups at a potential disadvantage to American-founded companies.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/26/newly-proposed-rules-for-foreign-entrepreneurs-will-help-some-but-not-all-found-u-s-startups/|title=Newly proposed rules for foreign entrepreneurs will help some, but not all, found U.S. startups|last=Mannes|first=John|website=TechCrunch|access-date=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investment requirements will also present a potential hurdle for the entrepreneurs. $250,000 is a considerable investment sum. [[Y Combinator (company)|Y Combinator]], which is regarded by [[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]] as the most successful startup accelerator in the world, only provides an investment of $120,000 to the companies that it incubates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ycombinator.com/|title=Y Combinator|website=www.ycombinator.com|access-date=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a company that is accepted into Y Combinator would have to raise an additional $225,000 dollars from “qualified U.S. investors with established records of successful investments,” or satisfy the rule's alternative criteria. The rule also seems to place more importance on investment generated than revenue generated, at least during the initial parole period. Many companies are able to self-fund through revenue, but would likely fall short on the investment side of the rule. Another potential challenge is that currently in the U.S., the fastest growing firms tend to turn to personal savings and banking loans to finance their operations, and these sources of funding are not mentioned explicitly in the rule's criteria.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kauffman.org/blogs/growthology/2016/10/international-entrepreneur-rule|title=International Entrepreneur Rule: The Good, the Bad and the Unknown|access-date=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On another note, as this rule only grants the founder parole status, leaving the country poses the founder at a risk of not being able to reenter the country. The government officials at the border entry point will be responsible for making that decision.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Reactions from the venture capital industry ==
The National Venture Capital Association (NVCA), America’s premier trade association that represents the U.S. venture capital industry&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/national-venture-capital-association#/entity|title=The National Venture Capital Association - NVCA {{!}} crunchbase|website=www.crunchbase.com|access-date=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and speaks for venture capitalists across the U.S., commended the U.S. government for its work on the International Entrepreneur Rule. Bobby Franklin, President and CEO of the NVCA, stated that this rule “will create avenues for foreign entrepreneurs to build great companies in the U.S. and is a solid first step toward our ultimate goal of creating a Startup Visa.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nvca.org/pressreleases/nvca-applauds-international-entrepreneur-rule-recommends-key-improvements/|title=NVCA Applauds International Entrepreneur Rule and Recommends Key Improvements|access-date=2018-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Litigation and implementation ==
The International Entrepreneur Rule was published in the Federal Register at the end of the [[Obama Administration]], three days before [[President Donald Trump]] was inaugurated. The rule was scheduled to go into effect six months later, on July 17, 2017, but on July 11, 2017, USCIS published a new rule with the effect of delaying this effective date until March 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/07/11/2017-14619/international-entrepreneur-rule-delay-of-effective-date|title=International Entrepreneur Rule: Delay of Effective Date|date=2017-07-11|newspaper=Federal Register|access-date=2018-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the lawsuit ''National Venture Capital Assn, et. al. v. Duke, et. al.'', the NVCA and other plaintiffs challenged this delay rule as unlawful under the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]]. On December 1, 2017, the federal district court for the District of Columbia granted summary judgment for the plaintiffs in this case, and ordered USCIS to implement the International Entrepreneur Rule without further delay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/litigation/lawsuit-challenges-postponement-international-entrepreneur-rule|title=Lawsuit Challenges Postponement of the International Entrepreneur Rule|access-date=2018-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks later, USCIS published forms and instructions for founders seeking to apply for entrepreneur parole and began accepting applications, but stated that "[w]hile DHS complies with the court order and implements the IER parole program, DHS is also in the final stages of publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking seeking to remove the IER."&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;

'''Jürgen Stroop''' (born '''Josef Stroop''', 26 September 1895 – 6 March 1952) was a German [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] commander during the [[Nazi era]], who served as [[SS and Police Leader]] in occupied Poland. He led the suppression of the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] in 1943 and wrote the [[Stroop Report]], a book-length account of the operation. Following the defeat of Germany, Stroop was prosecuted during the [[Dachau Trials]] and convicted of murdering nine American [[POWs]]. After his extradition to the [[People's Republic of Poland]], Stroop was tried, convicted, and executed for [[crimes against humanity]].

==Life==
Jürgen Stroop was born in the [[Principality of Lippe]], in the [[German Empire]]. His father, Konrad Stroop, was Lippe's chief of police. His mother, Katherine Stroop, was a full-time homemaker. In conversation with [[Kazimierz Moczarski]] while imprisoned in 1949, Stroop recalled his devoutly religious mother as "a near fanatic,"&lt;ref name="Moczarski 1981, page 10"&gt;Moczarski (1981), ''[[Conversations with an Executioner]]'', Prentice Hall, page 10.&lt;/ref&gt; who subjected him to childhood physical abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Moczarski (1981), page 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Both of his parents were enthusiastic [[Monarchism|monarchist]]s. During parades in Detmold Konrad Stroop often pointed out [[Leopold IV, Prince of Lippe]] and said, "Remember this always. This is our Prince. Obey him and serve him as I have."&lt;ref&gt;Moczarski (1981), page 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stroop's sense of German patriotism was fostered by growing up in the shadow of the ''[[Hermannsdenkmal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Moczarski (1981), pages 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving an elementary education, he became an [[apprentice]] with the [[land register]] in Detmold, where he worked until the outbreak of [[World War I]].

Stroop enlisted in the [[Prussian Army]] in 1914 and served in several infantry regiments along the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. He was [[wounded in action]] near [[La Bassée]] in October 1914.&lt;ref name="Moczarski20"&gt;Moczarski (1981), page 20.&lt;/ref&gt; To the outrage of his devoutly Catholic mother, Stroop married Katharina B., the daughter of a minister from the [[Protestant]] [[Church of Lippe]], on 3 July 1923.&lt;ref name="Moczarski 1981, page 31"&gt;Moczarski (1981), page 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Katharina Stroop remained a loyal and obedient wife despite her husband's many infidelities and visits to ''[[Lebensborn]]'' centers.&lt;ref&gt;Moczarski (1981), pages 58, 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Their marriage produced a daughter, Renate Stroop, who was born in February, 1928.&lt;ref name="Moczarski 1981, page 31"/&gt; Their son, Olaf Stroop, was born in February, 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Moczarski (1981),  page 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 1920s, Stroop joined the ''[[Tannenbergbund]]'' and embraced [[Germanic neo-paganism]] under the influence of General [[Erich Ludendorff]] and his wife [[Mathilde Ludendorff|Mathilde]]. He later recalled that Mathilde Ludendorff 
revealed "the truth about the [[Catholic Church]] in Germany and returned us to the [[Aesir|true Germanic gods]]. By recalling the pure, pre-Germanic ways, she pointed out the rottenness of the [[Judeo-Christian]] [[ethic]] and showed how the organized Church had been strangling the Reich for twelve hundred years." Stroop further recalled, "It was thanks to what I was lucky enough to learn from her books that I was able to rid myself of religious prejudice and mark ''[[Gottgläubig]]'' in the column concerning belief."&lt;ref&gt;Kazimierz Moczarski (1981), pages 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

In another conversation with Moczarski, Stroop called Catholicism "a catch-all of religions, infected with [[Judaism]]."&lt;ref&gt;Moczarski (1981), pages 57-58.&lt;/ref&gt; He further claimed that Christianity was created as a Jewish conspiracy for "the weakening and debasement of man through guilt."&lt;ref&gt;Moczarski (1981), page 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

==SS career==
Stroop joined the [[Nazi Party|NSDAP]] and SS in 1932. In 1933, he was appointed leader of the state [[auxiliary police]]. One year later, he was promoted from the rank of SS-''[[Oberscharführer]]'' to SS-''[[Hauptsturmführer]]''. Subsequently, he worked for the SS administration in [[Münster]] and [[Hamburg]].

[[File:CAvGalenBAMS200612.jpg|thumb|upright|Bishop, later [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]], Count [[Clemens von Galen]].]]
In 1934, Bishop [[Clemens von Galen]] of [[Münster]] began to attack the racist ideologies of the new regime, partly poking fun at it, partly critiquing its ideological basis as published by [[Alfred Rosenberg]]. He declared it as unacceptable to refuse the [[Old Testament]] because of its Jewish authorship, and to limit morality and virtue to the perceived usefulness of a particular race.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Morsey, ''Clemens August Kardinal von Galen – Bischöfliches Wirken in der Zeit der Hitler-Herrschaft.'' Landeszentrale für politische Bildung, Düsseldorf 1987, p.&amp;nbsp;14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In retaliation, Stroop and a von Galen family member who had joined the SS made an official visit to the Bishop. Both were instructed to pressure the Bishop into openly expressing approval of Rosenberg's doctrines. If he refused to do so, they were ordered to threaten him with the confiscation of Church property and an Anti-Catholic propaganda campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Kazimierz Moczarski (1981), page 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

The visit began well, with Bishop von Galen commending Stroop's mother for her devout Catholicism and charitable work in Detmold. Then, however, the Bishop turned the tables on his two visitors. He categorically refused to accept or praise Rosenberg's doctrines of euthanising or forcibly sterilizing the disabled. To Stroop's further shock, the Bishop then denounced the Nazis for trying to introduce [[Germanic neo-paganism]] into his diocese. He scoffed at marriage ceremonies and funerals conducted before altars dedicated to [[Odin|Wotan]]. Stroop, who had attended such a ceremony only days before, was stunned that the Bishop had learned of it so quickly. At the end of the meeting, the Bishop stated that the Church would remain loyal to the State in all lawful matters. He expressed his deep love for Germany and reminded them that he had been the first Bishop to publicly acknowledge the new regime.&lt;ref&gt;Moczarski (1981), pages 56-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stroop later lamented the fact that Bishop von Galen's German patriotism "was tainted by [[Papist]] ideals, which have been harmful to Germany for centuries. Besides, the Archbishop's orders came from outside the Fatherland, a fact which disturbed us. We all know that despite its diverse factions, the Catholic Church is a world community, which sticks together when the chips are down."&lt;ref&gt;Moczarski (1981), page 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1938, Stroop was promoted again, this time to the rank of SS-''[[Standartenführer]]'' ([[colonel]]) and served near Reichenberg ([[Liberec]]), in the [[Sudetenland]]. In conversation with Moczarski, Stroop happily reminisced about his many visits to the hot springs at [[Karlovy Vary|Karlsbad]]. For this reason, their cellmate, Gustav Schielke, expressed disgust that, instead of serving in combat, "''Herr General'' did battle in spas."&lt;ref&gt;Moczarski (1981), page 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
After the [[invasion of Poland]], Stroop served as commander of the SS section in Gnesen ([[Gniezno]]). During the occupation of Poland, Stroop was transferred to [[Poznań]] as head of ''[[Selbstschutz]]'', the notorious "self-defense" formation of the local [[ethnic Germans]].

In May 1941, Stroop changed his name from Josef to Jürgen for [[ideological]] reasons and in honor of his dead infant son. From 7 July to 15 September 1941, Stroop served in combat on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|eastern front]] with the [[infantry regiment]] of the [[3rd SS Division Totenkopf|3rd SS Division ''Totenkopf'']]. He was awarded a [[Iron Cross#Design|Clasp to the Iron Cross 2nd Class]] and an [[Infantry Assault Badge]] in Bronze. On 16 September 1942, he was promoted to SS-''[[Brigadeführer]]'' and assigned as an Inspector of the [[Sicherheitspolizei|SiPo]] and [[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]] of the Higher [[SS and Police Leader]] for [[Russia]] South. In this position, Stroop worked to help secure a key [[logistics|logistical]] route for German forces on the Eastern Front. Beginning in October 1942, Stroop commanded an SS garrison at [[Kherson]], before becoming the SS and Police Leader (SSPF) for Lemberg ([[Lviv]]) in February 1943.

===Suppression of the Warsaw ghetto uprising===
[[Image:Stroop Report - Warsaw Ghetto Uprising 03.jpg|thumb|right|Jürgen Stroop (center, in a field cap) with his men in the burning of [[Warsaw Ghetto]], 1943]]

Stroop's most historically prominent role was the suppression of the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]], an action which cost the lives of over 50,000 people. He was sent to Warsaw on 17 April 1943 by [[Heinrich Himmler]], as a replacement for SS-''[[Oberführer]]'' [[Ferdinand von Sammern-Frankenegg]], who was relieved of duty.&lt;ref name="MA"&gt;Moshe Arens, [http://www.freeman.org/m_online/may03/arens.htm Who Defended The Warsaw Ghetto?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060526200526/http://www.freeman.org/m_online/may03/arens.htm |date=2006-05-26 }} (''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'')&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary.org"&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/Strooptoc.html Jurgen Stroop Diary, including The Stroop Report: Table of Contents] ([[Jewish Virtual Library]])&lt;/ref&gt; Stroop took over from Sammern-Frankenegg following the latter's failure to suppress the uprising at the onset:&lt;ref name="Dor"&gt;Jewish Virtual Library, [https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/sammern.html Ferdinand von Sammern-Frankenegg] Source: Danny Dor (Ed.), ''Brave and Desperate.

{{quote|I had two [[battalion]]s of [[Waffen-SS]], one hundred [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|army men]], units of [[Ordnungspolizei|Order Police]], and seventy-five to a hundred [[Sicherheitspolizei|Security Police]] people. The Security Police had been active in the Warsaw ghetto for some time, and during this program it was their function to accompany SS units in groups of six or eight, as guides and experts in ghetto matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/strooptest.html |title=Statement by Stroop to Investigators About His Actions in the Warsaw Ghetto |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |date=1946-02-24 |accessdate=2012-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Stroop ordered the entire Ghetto to be systematically burned down and blown up building by building. All of the survivors, including men, women, and children were either killed on the spot or deported to [[extermination camp]]s. In conversation with Moczarski, Stroop described the destruction of the Ghetto in great detail. Stroop also disclosed that, unlike the men under his command, he always left the Ghetto at mealtimes and overnight.
[[File:Stroop Report - Warsaw Ghetto Uprising BW.jpg|thumb|right|A [[A Jewish boy surrenders in Warsaw|well-known photograph]] showing the clearing of the Warsaw Ghetto in 1943.]]

Stroop later recalled:

{{quote|May First was memorable for a number of reasons. I witnessed an extraordinary scene that day. A group of prisoners had been herded into the square. In spite of their exhaustion, many of them held their heads high. I stood nearby, surrounded by my escort. Suddenly I heard shots. A young Jew – in his midtwenties I'd guess – was firing a pistol at one of our police officers – one ... two ... three ... fast as lightning. One of the bullets hit the officer's hand. My men sprayed the Jew with fire. I managed to whip out my own pistol and hit him as he fell. As he lay dying, I stood over him, watching his life ebb away.|Jurgen Stroop, ''[[Conversations with an Executioner]]''&lt;ref&gt;Moczarski (1981), pages 148-149.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Stroop expressed confusion that the Ghetto's Jewish combatants, whom he had been taught to view as ''[[Untermenschen]]'', had fought so effectively against his men. He later remarked: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;... if you'd been in our shoes, Herr Moczarski, you'd have been surprised that the fighting ended as soon as it did. It's all history now, and the world's gone topsy-turvy, so why not speak the truth here in our cell? The Jews surprised me and my officers, and even Dr. Hahn, with their determination in battle. And believe me, as veterans of World War I and SS members, we knew what determination in battle was all about. The tenacity of your Warsaw Jews took us completely by surprise. That's the real reason the ''Großaktion'' lasted as long as it did.&lt;ref&gt;Moczarski (1981), page 148.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===SS and Police Leader of Warsaw===
[[File:Wielka Synagoga w Warszawie.PNG|thumb|[[Great Synagogue (Warsaw)|Great Synagogue of Warsaw]], c. 1910]]
After the uprising was suppressed, Stroop ordered the destruction of [[Great Synagogue (Warsaw)|Warsaw's Great Synagogue]]:

{{quote|What a marvelous sight it was. A fantastic piece of theater. My staff and I stood at a distance. I held the electrical device which would detonate all the charges simultaneously. Jesuiter called for silence.  I glanced over at my brave officers and men, tired and dirty, silhouetted against the glow of the burning buildings. After prolonging the suspense for a moment, I shouted: ''[[Hitler salute|Heil Hitler]]'' and pressed the button. With a thunderous, deafening bang and a rainbow burst of colors, the fiery explosion soared toward the clouds, an unforgettable tribute to our triumph over the Jews. The Warsaw Ghetto was no more. The will of Adolf Hitler and Heinrich Himmler had been done.|Jürgen Stroop, ''Conversations with an Executioner''&lt;ref&gt;Moczarski (1981), page 164.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Stroop then formally assumed the position of [[SS and Police Leader]] of Warsaw. Krüger presented an [[Iron Cross|Iron Cross 1st Class]] to him on 18 June 1943 for the Warsaw Ghetto "action" at a gala reception in Warsaw's [[Lazienki Park]]. Stroop's own detailed [[The Stroop Report|75-page report]] on the suppression of the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] was bound in black leather. It included copies of all [[communiqués]] sent to SS Police Leader East [[Friedrich-Wilhelm Krüger]] and many photographs. Originally titled ''The Jewish Quarter of Warsaw is no more!'', it would later be used as evidence at the [[Nuremberg Trials]].

===Occupied Greece===
Stroop was subsequently named the [[Higher SS and Police Leader]] (HSSPF) in [[Greece]] on 8 September 1943.&lt;ref name=Bour/&gt; 
On 16 October, the government of [[Ioannis Rallis]] published a decree which put the [[Security Battalions]], [[Hellenic Gendarmerie]] and [[City Police (Greece)|City Police]] under Stroop's orders.&lt;ref&gt;Gasparinatos (2015), pages 112-113, 261.&lt;/ref&gt; The local civilian administration found his methods and behaviour unacceptable and withdrew cooperation, forbidding the local Order Police from having anything to do with him, which made his position untenable. Consequently, he was removed and replaced by [[Walter Schimana]] and on 9 November was appointed Commander of SS-''Oberabschnitt Rhein-Westmark'' (an SS administrative district named for the [[Rhine]] and [[Gau Westmark]]) in [[Wiesbaden]], serving there until the close of the war.&lt;ref name=Bour&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.axishistory.com/index.php?id=3244 |title=Axis History Factbook: SS-Oberabschnitt Rhein-Westmark |publisher=Axishistory.com |accessdate=2012-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===July 20th plot===
[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1972-025-10, Hitler-Attentat, 20. Juli 1944.jpg|thumb|right|The conference room at the [[Wolf's Lair]] after [[Claus von Stauffenberg]]'s attempt on Hitler's life]]
According to Moczarski, there was never any subject that enraged Stroop more than the [[July 20th Plot]] against the life of Adolf Hitler. Whenever the subject came up, Stroop would curse those involved, "in unprintable terms," as a "murderous band of generals and Jew-ridden civilians."&lt;ref name="Moczarski 1981, page 220"&gt;Moczarski (1981), page 220.&lt;/ref&gt; Stroop blamed Germany's defeat on Germans themselves:

&lt;blockquote&gt;How could they consider harming their Führer? [[Adolf Hitler]] was placed on earth by a higher power, perhaps [[Odin|Wotan]] himself, to fulfil a sacred mission. The July conspiracy was an example of the moral decay that proved to be our undoing. It would have been impossible to defeat Germany without German participation, Herr Moczarski. If it hadn't been for negligence disguised as tolerance, we could have held off the whole world. Instead, we allowed degenerate forces to pollute our healthy masses. A few weaklings poisoned by enemy agents and infected with subversive ideologies were all it took to undermine us. The minute we suffered military defeats, the cancerous elements in our society swung into action, organizing [[Mafia]]s and creating 'patriotic discussion groups.' In the end, they destroyed our nation.&lt;ref name="Moczarski 1981, page 220"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Stroop proudly related his involvement in the purge of Anti-Nazi Germans which followed the Plot's failure. He expressed annoyance that Field Marshal [[Erwin Rommel]] had been allowed to commit suicide rather than being hanged from a meat hook.&lt;ref&gt;Moczarski (1981), page 222.&lt;/ref&gt; He also praised [[Roland Freisler]] of the ''[[Volksgerichtshof]]'' as "a fine judge."&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;Moczarski (1981), page 224.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stroop also boasted about his participation in dealing with Field Marshal [[Günther von Kluge]] for his involvement in the Plot. As General [[Wilhelm Burgdorf]] had done with Rommel, Stroop claimed to have offered the Field Marshal a choice between suicide and a [[show trial]] before Judge Freisler. To Stroop's outrage, Kluge demanded his day in court. Stroop then claimed to have personally shot Kluge in the head. Himmler then announced that the Field Marshal had committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Moczarski (1981), pages 226-234.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Murder of U.S. prisoners of war===
Between October 1944 and March 1945, nine troops of the [[United States Army Air Forces]] were summarily executed after being shot down and captured in Stroop's district. They were Sergeant Willard P. Perry, Sergeant Robert W. Garrison, Private Ray R. Herman, Second Lieutenant William A. Duke, Second Lieutenant Archibald B. Monroe, Private Jimmie R. Heathman, Lieutenant William H. Forman, and Private Robert T. McDonald.&lt;ref&gt;Moczarski (1981), pages 276-277.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Moczarski reminded him that the killing of POWs was defined as criminal under the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague]] and [[Geneva Conventions]], Stroop responded, "It was common knowledge that American flyers were terrorists and murderers who used methods contrary to civilized norms ... We were given a statement to that effect from the highest authorities. It was accompanied by an order from [[Heinrich Himmler]]."&lt;ref&gt;Moczarski (1981), page 250.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, he explained, all nine POWs had been taken to the forest and given "a ration of lead for their American necks."&lt;ref&gt;Moczarski (1981), pages 251-252.&lt;/ref&gt;

===End of war===
In late March 1945, Stroop was forced to retreat from [[Wiesbaden]] as the advancing U.S. Army crossed the Rhine bridgeheads. Upon his arrival in [[Pottenstein, Bavaria]], Stroop received word that [[Heinrich Himmler]] wished to meet him in Berlin. On 14 April Stroop met Himmler in his private train near [[Prenzlau]].

Stroop later recalled, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Adolf Hitler was behaving oddly, he confided, and might even be ill. Heinrich Himmler ... ended our talk by asking if I would join his personal staff and eventually go north with him to [[Lübeck]] and later Denmark. Flattered though I was, I expressed my belief that during this period of temporary reversals, it was essential to organize a central resistance point in the southern Alps, until new weapons were ready.&lt;ref&gt;Moczarski (1981), pages 237-238.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With a pass signed by Himmler, Stroop travelled to the [[Alpine Redoubt]] with a group of teenaged [[Hitler Youth]] members whom he had been training for war. In order to obtain gasoline and other scarce supplies, Stroop showed Himmler's signed order and claimed to be transporting his [[Werwolf]] unit to build an Alpine bastion for the salvation of the Reich.

However, after a secret conference at [[Taxenbach]], Austria, Stroop and his fellow Werwolf commanders decided to change into Wehrmacht uniforms and surrender to the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]]. Soon after, Stroop abandoned his Werwolf unit near [[Kufstein]] and fled north.&lt;ref&gt;Moczarski (1981), pages 243-244.&lt;/ref&gt; On May 10, 1945, Stroop surrendered to the [[United States Armed Forces|American forces]]&lt;ref&gt;Moczarski (1981), page 248.&lt;/ref&gt; in the village of [[Grassau, Bavaria|Rottau]], [[Bavaria]].&lt;ref&gt;Moczarski (1981), page 244.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stroop told Moczarski that he had been carrying a [[cyanide]] tablet which he had intended to take if captured. When Moczarski asked him why he had not used it, Stroop replied, "It's really quite simple. I was afraid."&lt;ref&gt;Moczarski (1981), page 246.&lt;/ref&gt; When he surrendered, Stroop carried forged discharge papers made out to a [[Wehrmacht]] Captain of Reserve Josef Straup. He kept to this story for nearly two months, before admitting to his actual identity on 2 July 1945.

==Trial at Dachau==
[[File:Dachauer Prozess - Richterbank.jpg|thumb|right|Judicial Bench, Dachau Trials.]]
In the case of ''U.S. vs. Jurgen Stroop, et al'',  the former General and his subordinates were prosecuted by the [[Dachau Trials|U.S. Military Tribunal at Dachau]] for the "liquidation" of the nine American POWs who had been summarily shot in his district.&lt;ref&gt;Moczarski (1981), pages 248-256.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.jur.uva.nl/junsv/JuNSVEng/DTRR/DTCasesfr.htm |title=Nazi Crimes on Trial: The Dachau Trials |publisher=.jur.uva.nl |accessdate=2012-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lieutenant Colonel William Dwinnel, a U.S. Army lawyer from [[Brooklyn, New York]] had appeared for the prosecution. Brigadier General [[Emil C. Kiel]] of the [[United States Army Air Forces]] was assigned as the trial's judge. Stroop later called General Kiel "a cunning devil," and expressed a belief that the General was a Jew.&lt;ref name="Moczarski249"&gt;Moczarski (1981), page 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

In conversation with Moczarski, Stroop lamented, "Nearly all of those judges were Jews or Freemasons. I studied them very closely. Most of them had dark hair."&lt;ref name="Moczarski249"/&gt; He further lamented that one of his U.S. Army defense lawyers was wearing a Masonic ring in court.&lt;ref name="Moczarski249"/&gt; According to Gustav Schielke, his cellmate, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Stroop behaved like a swine in the dock. He acted innocent as a lamb, pretending the killings were news to him. Because of his incriminations, several fellow defendants were sentenced to death, as many as thirteen of the twenty-two. As senior commander of the SS and police, ''he'' gave all the orders, Herr Moczarski, yet he stated in court that his underlings had killed the American airmen on their own. How could a top German officer have acted like that?&lt;ref&gt;Moczarski (1981), page 253.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After an eight-week trial, Brigadier General Kiel sentenced Stroop to [[death by hanging]] on 21 March 1947. In November 1947, a death warrant was signed by General [[Lucius D. Clay]]. By then, however, Stroop had been imprisoned in Warsaw for five months.

In late May 1947, Stroop was flown to [[Berlin-Tempelhof Airport]] and extradited to the [[People's Republic of Poland]]. He later recalled, "My heart sank when I saw those Polish officers at Tempelhof. So the Americans were liars after all! They'd promised me time and again that I'd never be given to the Communists and that my death sentence for killing the U.S. airmen would be commuted to life imprisonment."&lt;ref&gt;Moczarski(1981), ''Conversations with an Executioner'', page 258.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imprisonment in Poland==
While awaiting trial in Warsaw's [[Mokotów Prison]], Stroop spent 255 days in the same cell with [[Kazimierz Moczarski]], a former officer in the pre-war [[Polish Army]]. Moczarski, under the codename ''Maurycy'', had served in Poland's anti-Nazi and [[Cursed soldiers|anti-Soviet]] resistance movement, the ''[[Armia Krajowa]]'' (AK) in World War II. By the time they both met, he had already been incarcerated for more than three years, having been sentenced on 18 January 1946.&lt;ref name="SC-MK"/&gt;
[[File:K moczarski.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kazimierz Moczarski]] (1907–1975)]]

Moczarski had been ordered by the AK to assassinate Stroop for crimes against the Polish Nation during his tenure as [[SS and Police Leader]] of Warsaw. Due to the unpredictability of Stroop's movements, Moczarski had been unable to carry out the mission.&lt;ref&gt;Moczarski (1981), pages 182-184.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Soviet-led transformation of Poland into a [[Marxist-Leninist]] [[police state]], Moczarski was arrested and savagely tortured by the [[Ministry of Public Security of Poland|Polish Ministry of State Security]],&lt;ref&gt;Stephane Courtois, ''The Black Book of Communism: Crimes, Terror, Repression'', [[Harvard University Press]], 1999. Pages 377-378.&lt;/ref&gt; spending four years on death row before his release in 1956.&lt;ref name="SC-MK"/&gt;

During their joint incarceration, Stroop opened up in detail about his life, while expressing no remorse. He also shared with Moczarski his letters from his mother, wife, and children in [[West Germany]]. Moczarski later recalled: "The letters from his mother that Stroop gave me to read ... seemed to indicate that Frau Stroop did not view as crimes the acts for which Stroop had been jailed."&lt;ref name="Moczarski 1981, page 10"/&gt;

Stroop also expressed his continuing belief in Nazi race doctrine. According to him, only the European [[Aryan race|Aryan]]s, especially [[Nordicism|Nordics]] like the Germans, were the models of true man.&lt;ref&gt;Moczarski (1981), pages 146-147.&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 November 1949, Stroop and Moczarski were separated by prison authorities. As they left their cell for the last time, Stroop told Moczarski, "Today's your Independence Day, and the thirty-first anniversary of Germany's defeat in [[World War I]]. Goodbye, Herr Moczarski. See you soon at St. Peter's gate." Before parting, the two wartime enemies shook hands.&lt;ref&gt;Moczarski (1981), page 263.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trial in Warsaw===
[[Image:Stroop-1951v.jpg|thumb|upright|Stroop before a Polish court in 1951]]
Stroop's trial began on 18 July 1951 at the Warsaw Criminal District Court and lasted three days. Stroop stood accused of four crimes:
:1. Belonging to the SS, a criminal organization.
:2. Liquidating the Warsaw Ghetto, leading to the murder of more than 50,000 people and deporting hundreds of thousands of other Jews to the death camps.
:3. Ordering the shooting of one hundred Poles on 16 July 1943.
:4. Participating in the mass murder of Polish civilians in the [[Warthegau]].&lt;ref&gt;Moczarski (1981), page 264.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 July 1951, the Court sentenced Stroop and [[Franz Konrad (SS officer)|Franz Konrad]] to [[Hanging|death by hanging]]. In passing sentence, the Court declared,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Since the character and magnitude of Stroop's crimes, his attitude and his twisted explanations not only indicate a total lack of repentance but actually confirm that he retains his Nazi view of the world, the Court is unable to find the slightest extenuating circumstance in the accused Stroop's conduct. His actions show that he is a being devoid of human feeling, a Fascist hangman who tracked his victims with cold and relentless cruelty, an executioner who must be removed from the society of man.&lt;ref name="Moczarski 1981, page 265"&gt;Moczarski (1981), page 265.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Execution===
[[File:Rakowiecka37.jpg|thumb|right|Mokotów Prison, Warsaw, 2007.]]
Jürgen Stroop was hanged at Mokotów Prison at seven o'clock in the evening on 6 March 1952. In 1961, Moczarski wrote to the Procurator General of the Polish Republic and received a letter about Stroop's last moments. According to the Procurator's letter, Stroop was calm, "exhibiting his usual arrogance", in the day before his hanging. He expressed no "last wish". Several days before the hanging the prison director had asked Stroop whether he could reconcile his conscience with the fact that he had personally murdered women and children in the Ghetto, and watched others do so at his orders. He replied that he felt no guilt about killing Jews. Stroop did not utter a word about Germany, Hitler, or future revenge.&lt;ref&gt;Moczarski (1981), page 266.&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Conversations with an Executioner'' ==
[[Kazimierz Moczarski]] began collecting notes and writing a memoir about his 255-day incarceration from 2 March 1949 till 11 November 1949 in one cell with Jürgen Stroop after his release from prison and full rehabilitation in 1956 during the anti-Stalinist [[Polish October]].&lt;ref name="Podgórski/scribd"&gt;Andrzej Szczypiorski (1977), [https://www.scribd.com/doc/80572900/70230112-Moczarski-Kazimierz-Rozmowy-z-Katem  Moczarski Kazimierz, ''Rozmowy z katem''] text with ''Notes'' and ''Biography'' by Andrzej Krzysztof Kunert (PDF 1.86 MB, available from Scribd.com). Retrieved {{nowrap|August 23, 2014.}} {{Pl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; His manuscript was first written in secrecy. Some 15 years after his ordeal had ended, Moczarski published his memoir in instalments in the Polish magazine [[Odra (magazine)|''Odra'' monthly]] in 1972–74. He did not witness the publication of his work in book form. The first shortened book version was released in 1977, two years after Moczarski's death. The full text without [[Censorship in the Polish People's Republic|communist censorship]] was published in 1992 after the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]], by [[Polish Scientific Publishers PWN]]. Moczarski died on 27 September 1975 in Warsaw, already weakened by the years of physical torture endured during his communist police interrogations by the notorious [[Ministry of Public Security (Poland)|UB secret police]] .&lt;ref name="SC-MK"&gt;Stéphane Courtois, Mark Kramer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=H1jsgYCoRioC&amp;pg=PA378&amp;dq=%22Roman+Romkowski%22&amp;cd=8#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Roman%20Romkowski%22&amp;f=false  ''Livre noir du Communisme: crimes, terreur, répression''.] The Black Book of Communism: Crimes, Terror, Repression, ''[[Harvard University Press]]'', 1999, 858 pages. {{ISBN|0-674-07608-7}}.

'''Lohari Ragho''' is a village located in [[Hisar (city)|Hisar]], [[Haryana]], India. It is 55&amp;nbsp;km from Hisar and 178&amp;nbsp;km from [[Chandigarh]].

==Archaeology==
Three mounds belonging to the [[Sothi]]-[[Siswal]] ceramic period were found during excavations in 1980. Archaeological remains were reported first time by Dhoop Singh and Chanderpal Singh from the Department of Archaeology and Museums, Haryana. A lot of Harappan ceramics have been found on the site such as globular jars, vases, bowls, basins and fast wheel pottery made of [[Black and red ware culture|red ware]].&lt;ref&gt;Garge, T., (2010). [http://www.ancient-asia-journal.com/article/view/aa.10203/35 Sothi-Siswal Ceramic Assemblage: A Reappraisal.] Ancient Asia. 2, pp.15–40. DOI: http://doi.org/10.5334/aa.10203&lt;/ref&gt;

==Area around Rakhigarhi==
Bolstering the status of Rakhigarhi as the largest [[Indus Valley Civilization]] metropolis on the banks of [[Drishadvati river]] (current day paleochannel of [[Chautang]]), at least 23 other Indus Valley Civilization sites within 5&amp;nbsp;km (at 4 sites), 10&amp;nbsp;km (at least 10 sites) and 15&amp;nbsp;km (at least 9 sites) radius of Rakhigarhi have been discovered up to 2001. Some of the raw materials were procured from the nodal ''Rakhigarhi'' site and finished products were brought back to the nodal ''Rakhigarhi'' site for marketing.&lt;ref name="ASIR1"&gt;[http://asi.nic.in/pdf_data/rakhigarhi_excavation_report_new.pdf ASI Rakhigarhi Excavation Report for 1997-98 and 199-2001 excavations, Author: Dr. Amrendra Nath, Publisher: Archaeological Survey of India, Published: 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within 5&amp;nbsp;km radius are [[Indus Valley Civilisation#Early Harappan|early Harappan (4600 BCE - 2800 BCE)]] site of [[Gamra]] and [[Indus Valley Civilisation#Mature Harappan|mature Harappan (2600 BCE - 1400 BCE)]] sites of [[Budana]], [[Haibatpur]] and Lohari Ragho 3.&lt;ref name="ASIR1"/&gt;

Within 5&amp;nbsp;km to 10&amp;nbsp;km radius, early Harappan sites are Lohari Ragho 1, Lohari Ragho 2 and [[Kheri Lochab]]-[[Kheri Jalab]]. Mature Harappan small farmstead sites are [[Milakpur]] and [[Gunkali]]. Small farmstead sites of [[Kinnar, Hisar|Kinnar]], [[Nara, Hisar|Nara]] and [[Mirchpur]] have material from both mature and late Harappan period. [[Indus Valley Civilisation#Collapse and Late Harappan|late Harappan (after 1400 BCE)]] sites are [[Sothi|Sotha]] and

The '''Mansfield Cut Underwater Archeological District''' is an {{convert|18.31|acre|m2|sing=on}} area located near the city of [[Port Mansfield, Texas]], [[United States]], in the waters off [[Kenedy County, Texas|Kenedy County]] and [[Willacy County, Texas]].  Located offshore in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] near the Port Mansfield Cut, the site is the location of the Mansfield Cut Wrecks and has been listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] since 1974.

==Mansfield Cut Wrecks==
[[Image:MansfieldCut.JPG|thumb|440px|left|&lt;center&gt;Location of Mansfield Cut Underwater Archeological District&lt;/center&gt;]]
The Mansfield Cut Underwater Archeological District contains three [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] [[shipwreck]]s caused by a 1554 storm off the southern coast of [[Texas]] near the Mansfield Cut.  While the exact location of the site is unpublished, the three shipwrecks were found near the [[Padre Island National Seashore]].  The Mansfield Cut Wrecks are listed in the National Register as part of an [[archaeology|archeological]] district of national significance.&lt;ref name="NRShips"&gt;[http://www.cr.nps.gov/archeology/submerged/NRShips.htm NPS Archeology Program: Abandoned Shipwreck Act Guidelines]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Story===
On April 9, 1554, four Spanish [[Carrack|naos]]&lt;ref name="PINS-N"&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/pais/parknews/upload/BreezeFallfina10l06.pdf Padre Island NS Newsletter (Fall 2006)]&lt;/ref&gt; departed from [[San Juan de Ulúa]] bound for [[Havana]], [[Cuba]], the first leg of a return trip to Spain.&lt;ref name="HOT"&gt;{{Handbook of Texas|id=etpfe|name=Padre Island Spanish Shipwrecks of 1554}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ships were loaded with precious metals and similar cargo.  A storm off the coast of Cuba blew them across the Gulf of Mexico to the coast of Texas.&lt;ref name="PINS-N" /&gt;  On April 29, three of the ships ran aground with approximately 300 people aboard.  The fourth ship, the ''San Andrés'', reached Havana but was too damaged to repair.  Few of the survivors made it back to [[Mexico]] but there are records of a salvage operation during the summer of 1554 which retrieved about half of the cargo.&lt;ref name="HOT" /&gt;

==Remains==

===''Santa Maria de Yciar''===
The scattered remains of the wooden vessel named ''Santa Maria de Yciar'' are buried off Padre Island, Texas near Mansfield.  This vessel, which wrecked in 1554 when part of a treasure flota, lies within the Padre Island National Seashore.&lt;ref name="NRShips" /&gt;  The anchor of the ''Santa Maria de Yciar'' was found when the Mansfield Channel was dredged in the late 1950s.&lt;ref name="PINS-AH"&gt;[http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/pais/adhi9.htm Padre Island National Seashore - Administrative History]&lt;/ref&gt;  The original anchor is located on the campus of [[Texas A&amp;M University–Corpus Christi]].  A life-size replica may be found in the visitor's center of the Padre Island National Seashore.&lt;ref&gt;Sign at the Padre Island National Seashore Visitor's Center, viewed November 24, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Santa Maria de Yciar'' is owned by the State of Texas, Texas Antiquities Committee, and managed by the U.S. Government, National Park Service.&lt;ref name="NRShips" /&gt;

===''Espíritu Santo''===
The scattered remains of the wooden vessel named ''Espíritu Santo'' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "[[Holy Ghost]]") are buried off Padre Island near Port Mansfield.  This vessel, which wrecked in 1554 when part of a treasure flota, lies within the Padre Island National Seashore.&lt;ref name="NRShips" /&gt; The ''Espíritu Santo'' was discovered by Vida Lee Connor while [[scuba diving]] in 1966.  A [[marine salvage|salvage]] operation by a private company in 1967 was the subject of a court case and was responsible for the [[Antiquities Code of Texas]], passed by the [[Texas Legislature|state legislature]] in 1969.&lt;ref name="PINS-AH" /&gt;

===''San Esteban''===
The scattered remains of the wooden vessel named ''[[San Esteban (1554 shipwreck)|San Esteban]]'' are buried off Padre Island, near Port Mansfield.  This vessel, which wrecked in 1554 when part of a treasure flota, lies within the Padre Island National Seashore.&lt;ref name="NRShips" /&gt;  The ''San Esteban'' was discovered in the early 1970s during a magnetometer survey of the area arranged by the Underwater Archeological Research Section of the state Antiquities Committee.&lt;ref name="PINS-AH" /&gt;

'''Masculine virile nouns''' are a class of nouns in some languages, such as [[Polish language|Polish]], which refer to male humans but not male animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lsa.umich.edu/slavic/dept/WebBasedLanguage/Polish/Grammar/NominativePlural/MascVPL/Index.htm|title=Slavic Languages|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are therefore not to be confused with mere [[animacy]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3161">'''Metapragmatics''' is a term from the [[Semiotics|semiotically]]-informed [[linguistic anthropology]] of [[Michael Silverstein]] that describes how the effects and conditions of language use themselves become objects of discourse. Metapragmatic signalling allows participants to construe what is going on in an interaction. Examples include:
* describing the "correct way" of using language ("I before E except after C."),
* specifying under which conditions a specific kind of communication are, or should be, used ("You should never tell a dirty joke at a funeral."),
* signalling, explicitly or implicitly, the type of social event occurring (explicit: "I promise to be there at 3:00 p.m." implicit: "I will be there at 3:00 p.m.")
* linking speech to another event outside the moment of speaking ("Every day she goes jogging." ).

Discussions of linguistic [[pragmatics]]—that is, discussions of what speech ''does'' in a particular context—are meta-pragmatic, because they describe the meaning of speech as action. Although it is useful to distinguish semantic (i.e. denotative or referential) meaning (dictionary meaning) from pragmatic meaning, and thus metasemantic discourse (for example, "Mesa means 'table' in Spanish") from metapragmatic utterances (e.g. "Say 'thank you' to your grandmother," or "It is impolite to swear in mixed company"), meta-[[semantic]] characterizations of speech are a type of metapragmatic speech. This follows from the assertion that metapragmatic speech characterizes speech function, and denotation or reference are among the many functions of speech. Because metapragmatics describes relations between different discourses it relates crucially to the concepts of [[intertextuality]] or [[interdiscursivity]].

In [[linguistic anthropology|anthropology]], describing the rules of use for metapragmatic speech (in the same way that a grammar would describe the rules of use for 'ordinary' or semantic speech) is important because it can aid the understanding and analysis of a culture's [[language ideology]]. Silverstein has also described universal limits on metapragmatic awareness that help explain why some linguistic forms seem to be available to their users for conscious comment, while other forms seem to escape awareness despite efforts by a researcher to ask native speakers to repeat them or characterize their use.

[[Self-reference|Self-referential]], or reflexive, metapragmatic statements are [[Indexicality|indexical]]. That is, their meaning comes from their temporal contiguity with their referent: themselves. Example: "This is an example sentence."

[[Image:Pena-medio-cut.JPG|thumb|300px| [[Pena Palace]] in [[Sintra]], [[Portugal]] one of the points of reference for Neo-Romantic architecture]]
The term '''neo-romanticism''' is used to cover a variety of movements in philosophy, literature, music, painting, and architecture, as well as [[social movement]]s, that exist after and incorporate elements from the era of [[Romanticism]]. It has been used with reference to late-19th-century composers such as [[Richard Wagner]] particularly by [[Carl Dahlhaus]] who describes his music as "a late flowering of romanticism in a positivist age". He regards it as synonymous with "the age of Wagner", from about 1850 until 1890—the start of the era of [[Musical modernism|modernism]], whose leading early representatives were [[Richard Strauss]] and [[Gustav Mahler]] {{harv|Dahlhaus|1979|loc=98–99, 102, 105}}. It has been applied to writers, painters, and composers who rejected, abandoned, or opposed [[Realism (arts)|realism]], [[Naturalism (art)|naturalism]], or avant-garde modernism at various points in time from about 1840 down to the present.

== Late 19th century and early 20th century ==
Neo-romanticism as well as Romanticism is considered in opposition to naturalism—indeed, so far as music is concerned, naturalism is regarded as alien and even hostile {{harv|Dahlhaus|1979|loc=100}}. In the period following German unification in 1871, naturalism rejected Romantic literature as a misleading, idealistic distortion of reality. Naturalism in turn came to be regarded as incapable of filling the "void" of modern existence. Critics such as [[Hermann Bahr]], [[Heinrich Mann]], and [[Eugen Diederichs]] came to oppose naturalism and [[materialism]] under the banner of "neo-romanticism", demanding a cultural reorientation responding to "the soul’s longing for a meaning and  content in life" that might replace the fragmentations of modern knowledge with a holistic world view {{harv|Kohlenbach|2009|loc=261}}.
&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Flying-Dutchman.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Neo-romanticism sample,&lt;br/&gt;by [[George Grie]]]] --&gt;

== Late 20th century ==
"Neo-romanticism" was proposed as an alternative label for the group of German composers identified with the short-lived ''[[New Simplicity|Neue Einfachheit]]'' movement in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Along with other phrases such as "new tonality", this term has been criticised for lack of precision because of the diversity among these composers, whose leading member is [[Wolfgang Rihm]] {{harv|Hentschel|2006|loc=111}}.

===1930–1955===
In British art history, the term "neo-romanticism" is applied to a loosely affiliated school of landscape painting that emerged around 1930 and continued until the early 1950s. It was first labeled in March 1942 by the critic [[Raymond Mortimer]] in the ''New Statesman''. These painters looked back to 19th-century artists such as [[William Blake]] and [[Samuel Palmer]], but were also influenced by French cubist and post-cubist artists such as [[Pablo Picasso]], [[André Masson]], and [[Pavel Tchelitchew]] ({{harvnb|Clark and Clarke|2001}}; {{harvnb|Hopkins|2001}}). This movement was motivated in part as a response to the threat of invasion during World War II. Artists particularly associated with the initiation of this movement included [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]], [[John Piper (artist)|John Piper]], [[Henry Moore]], [[Ivon Hitchens]], and especially [[Graham Sutherland]]. A younger generation included [[John Minton (artist)|John Minton]], [[Michael Ayrton]], [[John Craxton]], [[Keith Vaughan]], [[Robert Colquhoun]], and [[Robert MacBryde]] {{harv|Button|1996}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7574">'''Oppression Olympics''' is a term used to describe verbal banter between [[marginalized]] groups, who are trying to determine the weight of their overall oppression, often by comparing race, gender, socioeconomic status or disabilities, in order to determine who is the worst off, and the most oppressed. The term often arises within debates about the ideological values of [[identity politics]], [[intersectionality]] and [[Privilege (social inequality)|social privilege]].&lt;ref name="QueeringAnarchism"&gt;[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=mk9ZcYHhcfYC&amp;pg=RA1-PA3&amp;lpg=RA1-PA3&amp;dq=oppression+olympics+identity+politics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KI7blAHX9P&amp;sig=z2BQQnqZ28lSL6uQinLv36Mz2xk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiTuqa-j5XMAhVL4mMKHQc2CVg4ChDoAQhDMAo#v=onepage&amp;q=oppression%20olympics%20identity%20politics&amp;f=false ''"Queering Anarchism: Addressing and Undressing Power and Desire"'', edited by C. B. Daring, J. Rogue, Deric Shannon, Abbey Volcano, Oakland, California, AK press, 2012, page 3.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dhamoon"&gt;''"Considerations on mainstream intersectionality"'', Dhamoon, Rita Kaur, Political Research Quarterly, 64(1), March 2011, pages 230-243.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=StoyanFrancis&gt;[http://www.pridesource.com/article.html?article=75091 ''"Oppression Olympics: The Dark Side of the Rainbow"'', Stoyan Francis, Pride Source, 1/28/2016.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dynamics ==
{{rquote|right|"What I received this past conference was new and as surprising as loan forgiveness. I saw people who looked like me, spoke like me, who I shared oppression with, excluding me from shared space. I felt my sisters separating me as a "[[Cisgender|cis]]"-ter and naming me and the rest of our black and brown family as oppressors and conspirators. The Oppression Olympics had started". — Stoyan Francis, "Sexual assault, domestic assault and LGBT of color advocate".&lt;ref name=StoyanFrancis/&gt;}}

The Oppression Olympics have been described as a contest within a group, to "assert who is more authentic, more oppressed, and thus more correct".&lt;ref name=QueeringAnarchism/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dhamoon/&gt; This may be on the basis of one's race, gender, sexuality, among other [[identity politics|stated or ascribed identities]].&lt;ref name=QueeringAnarchism/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dhamoon/&gt;

A person's stated or ascribed identity "become[s] fetishised" within the group and judged in preconceived [[essentialism|essentialist]] terms.&lt;ref name=QueeringAnarchism/&gt; There is a dynamic "of agreeing with the most marginalized in the room".&lt;ref name=QueeringAnarchism/&gt;

Stoyan Francis described "The gold medal of the Oppression Olympics is seen as the commanding spot for demanding change, for visibility and allocation of resources".&lt;ref name=StoyanFrancis/&gt;

== Usage ==
The exact origins of the phrase are unclear. Perhaps the earliest sustained use of the phrase is in the writings and activism of Chicana feminist [[Elizabeth "Betita" Martínez]]. In a 1993 interview, Martínez responded to a question about coalition building as follows: "There are various forms of working together. A coalition is one, a network is another, an alliance is yet another. [...] But the general idea is no competition of hierarchies should prevail. No Oppression Olympics!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ccs.ihr.ucsc.edu/inscriptions/volume-7/angela-y-davis-elizabeth-martinez/|title=''Coalition Building Among People of Color''|website=Inscriptions|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martínez would later write more extensively about the "Oppression Olympics" in her 1998 monograph ''De Colores Means All of Us: Latina Views for a Multi-colored Century''.   

The phrase was the title of an [[Everyday Feminism]] article&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://everydayfeminism.com/2012/11/oppression-olympics/|title=''Oppression Olympics: The Games We Shouldn’t Be Playing''|website=Everyday Feminism|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2012, was in an article by Holly Combe in UK Webzine The F Word in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thefword.org.uk/2010/08/oppression_olym/|title=''Oppression olympics: the privilege paradox?'' -  The F-Word|website=www.thefword.org.uk|access-date=2016-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was used in the title of a presentation to Rutgers University by Ange-Marie Hancock in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Rutgers|title=Dr. Ange-Marie Hancock - Beyond the oppression Olympics|date=2009-06-23|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lvomJnkPq4|accessdate=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Before these examples, however, the term saw use on social media.

== Criticism ==
The dynamics of the Oppression Olympics have been criticised as being "intellectually lazy, lacking political depth", and "leads towards tokenization".&lt;ref name=QueeringAnarchism/&gt;
These dynamics surrounding identity politics have been criticised within [[anarchist]] thought for their social hierarchy building, with anarchists fundamentally being against notions of hierarchy.&lt;ref name=QueeringAnarchism/&gt;

Academic Ange-Marie Hancock has criticised the energy spent upon the Oppression Olympics within progressive circles as being an impediment to wider collective action in furthering social change.&lt;ref name=Ange-MarieHancock/&gt; She opines that "Thanks to the Oppression Olympics and the political complexity facing the twenty-first century, standing in solidarity for wide social transformation is increasingly difficult to begin and challenging to pursue".&lt;ref name=Ange-MarieHancock&gt;Ange-Marie Hancock, "Solidarity Politics for Millennials: A Guide to Ending the Oppression Olympics (The Politics of Intersectionality)", Palgrave Macmillan, 2011, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current hierarchy ==
{{rquote|right|"It had previously been generally agreed that the black and brown [[Muslim]] [[lesbian]]s were the most unprivileged in society; now a group of Caucasian trans-women had challenged this. The Oppression Olympics were in full flow." — Stoyan Francis, "Sexual assault, domestic assault and LGBT of color advocate."&lt;ref name=StoyanFrancis/&gt;}}

Ange-Marie Hancock and other writers have suggested that the previously dominant class of Afro-Caribbean/Asian women are currently being replaced at the top of the hierarchy by [[Transgender|Trans]] men and women and that their subsequent frustration results in the "Oppression Olympics" phenomenon.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11036">In the [[philosophy of language]], the notion of performance conceptualizes what a spoken or written [[Text (literary theory)|text]] can bring about in human interactions.

==Historical development==
In the 1950s the philosopher of language [[J. L. Austin]] introduced the term '[[performative utterance]]' to make clear that 'to say something is to do something'.&lt;ref&gt;Austin (1962)&lt;/ref&gt;  Developing this idea, scholars have theorized on the relation of a spoken or written text to its broader context, that is to say everything outside the text itself. The question whether a performative is separable from the situation it emerged in is relevant when one addresses for example the status of individual intentions or speech as a resource of power. There are two main theoretical strands in research today. One emphasizes the predetermined conventions surrounding a performative utterance and the clear distinction between text and context. Another emphasizes the active construction of reality through spoken and written texts and is related to theories of [[human agency]] and [[discourse]]. The ideas about performance and text have contributed to the [[performative turn]] in the [[social sciences]] and [[humanities]], proving their methodological use for example in the interpretation of historical texts.

==Classical theories==
Early theories acknowledge that performance and text are both embedded in a system of rules and that the effects they can produce depend on convention and recurrence. In this sense, text is an instance of 'restored behaviour', a term introduced by [[Richard Schechner]] that sees performance as a repeatable ritual.&lt;ref&gt;Schechner (2006), p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;  The focus here is largely on individual sentences in the active first person voice, rather than on politics or discourse. The syntactical analyses are firmly anchored in analytical epistemology, as the distinction between the research object and its context is not conceived as problematic.

===Austin===
[[J. L. Austin]] introduced the performative utterance as an additional category to 'constatives', statements that can be either true or false.&lt;ref&gt;Austin (1962), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;  Language not only represents, but also can make something happen. Austin distinguishes between two types of performative speech acts. The illocutionary act is concerned with what an actor is doing in saying something (e.g. when someone says 'hello', he is greeting another person).&lt;ref&gt;Austin (1962), p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;  The perlocutionary act involves the [[unintended consequences]] of an utterance and refers to that what an actor is doing by saying something (e.g. when someone says 'hello' and the greeted person is scared by it).&lt;ref&gt;Austin (1962), p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

Every performative utterance has its own procedure and risks of failure that Austin calls 'infelicities'.&lt;ref&gt;Austin (1962), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;  He sees a sharp distinction between the individual text and the 'total speech act situation' surrounding it. According to Austin, in order to successfully perform an illocutionary act, certain conditions have to be met (e.g. a person who pronounces a marriage must be authorized to do so).&lt;ref&gt;Austin (1962), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;  Besides the context, the performative utterance itself is unambiguous as well. The words of an illocutionary act have to be expressed in earnest; if not, Austin discards them as a parasitic use of language.

===Searle===
Building on Austin's thought, language philosopher [[John Searle]] tried to develop his own account of speech acts, suggesting that these acts are a form of rule-governed behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Searle (1974), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;  On the one hand, Searle discerns rules that merely regulate language, such as referring and predicating.&lt;ref&gt;Searle (1974), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;  These rules account for the 'propositional content' of our sentences. On the other hand, he discerns rules that are constitutive in character and define behaviour (e.g. when we make a promise).&lt;ref&gt;Searle (1974), p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;  These rules are the conventions underlying performative utterances and they enable us not only to represent and express ourselves, but also to communicate.&lt;ref&gt;Searle (1983), p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

This focus on effect implies a conscious actor and Searle assumes that language stems from an intrinsic intentionality of the mind.&lt;ref&gt;Searle (1983), p. vii&lt;/ref&gt;  These intentions set the prerequisites for the performance of speech acts and Searle sets out to map their necessary and sufficient conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Searle (1983), p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;  Like Austin, he thinks in terms of demarcated contexts and transparent intentions, two issues that in the 1970s led him into polemics with [[postmodern]] thinker [[Jacques Derrida]].&lt;ref&gt;In 1972 Jacques Derrida published the article 'Signature Événement Contexte', in which he criticises several aspects of Austin's theory on the performative utterance. The first English translation appeared in 1977 in the first volume of Glyph. In the second volume (1977) Searle published an article called: 'Reiterating the differences: a reply to Derrida', in which he defended Austin's theories. Derrida responded with the essay 'Limited Inc a b c...', (1977).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postmodernist theories==
The second set of theories on performance and text diverged from the tradition represented by Austin and Searle. Bearing the stamp of [[postmodernism]], it states that neither the meaning, nor the context of a text can be defined in its entirety. Instead of emphasizing linguistic rules, scholars within this strand stress that the performative utterance is intertwined with structures of power. Because a text inevitably changes a situation or discourse, the distinction between text and context is blurred.

===Derrida===
The postmodern philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]] holds with Austin and Searle that by illocutionary force, language itself can transform and effect.&lt;ref&gt;Derrida (1988), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; However, he criticizes the notion of 'felicity conditions' and the idea that the success of a performative utterance is determined by conventions. Derrida values the distinctiveness of every individual [[speech act]], because it has a specific effect in the particular situation in which it is performed.&lt;ref&gt;Derrida (1988), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; It is because of this effect or 'breaking force' that Derrida calls the possibility of repeating a text 'iterability', a word derived from Latin ''iterare'', to repeat.

According to Derrida, the effects caused by a performative text are in a sense also part of it. In this way, the distinction between a text and that what is outside it dissolves. For this reason it is pointless to try to define the context of a speech act.&lt;ref&gt;Derrida (1988), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;
Besides the consequential effects, the dissolution of the text-context divide is also caused by iterability. Due to the possibility of repetition, the intentions of an individual actor can never be fully present in a speech act.&lt;ref&gt;Derrida (1988), p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; The core of a performative utterance is therefore not constituted by animating intentions, as Austin and Searle would have it, but by the structure of language.

===Butler===
The philosopher [[Judith Butler]] offers a political interpretation of the concept of the performative utterance. Power in the form of active censorship defines and regulates the domain of a certain discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Butler (1997), p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; Indebted to the work of [[Michel Foucault]], Butler expounds how subjects are produced by their context, because the possibilities of speech are predetermined.

Notwithstanding such social restraints, Butler underscores the possibility of agency. The boundaries of a discourse need continuous re-demarcation and this is where speech can escape its constriction. The emphasis on the limits of what is allowed to be said also frames that what is silenced.&lt;ref&gt;Butler (1997), p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;
Performativity has a political aspect that consists in what Derrida has described as the breaking force, by which an utterance changes its context.&lt;ref&gt;Butler (1997), p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; Butler assigns an important role to what Austin has called infelicities and parasitic uses of language. Quotations, parodies and other deviations from official discourse can become instruments of power that affect society.&lt;ref&gt;Butler (1997), p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical methodology==
===Skinner===
The historian [[Quentin Skinner]] developed classical and postmodern theories on performative texts into a concrete research method. Using Austin's vocabulary, he seeks to recover what historical authors were doing in writing their texts, which corresponds with the performance of illocutionary acts.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner (2003), p. vii&lt;/ref&gt; According to Skinner, philosophical ideas are intertwined with claims of power. Every text is an act of communication that positions itself in relation to the status quo it seeks to change.&lt;ref name="Skinner 2003, p. 115"&gt;Skinner (2003), p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

Skinner agrees with Derrida that contexts in their entirety are irretrievable but nevertheless states that there is a relevant context outside the text that can be described in a plausible way.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner (2003), p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive research is required to relate historical texts to their contemporary discourses. According to Skinner 'there is a sense in which we need to understand why a certain proposition has been put forward if we wish to understand the proposition itself'.&lt;ref name="Skinner 2003, p. 115"/&gt; He values agency over structure and stresses the importance of authorial intentions.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner (2003), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner therefore proposes to study historical sources in order to retrieve the convictions the author held, reflect on their coherence and investigate possible motives for the illocutionary act.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner (2003), p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; This practical method seeks to deal with the blurred distinction between text and context and offer a meaningful way of interpreting historical reality.

"'''President Obama on Death of Osama bin Laden (SPOOF)'''" is [[Iman Crosson]]'s [[parody|spoof]] video posted to the [[YouTube]] video sharing website, including a spoof of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Barack Obama]]'s May 1, 2011 speech announcing the [[death of Osama bin Laden]]. The video is the basis of the [[rapping|rap music]] [[single (music)|single]] "Momentous Day."

The video was produced by actor-impressionist and dancer [[Iman Crosson]] and posted on [[YouTube]] three days after Obama's speech. Crosson's video includes a spoken explanatory introduction followed by a [[parody|spoof]] of Obama's speech. The spoof includes comedic dancing, and presents the speech in [[rapping|rap music]] form, sometimes covering topics from Obama's speech with references to contemporary [[Internet meme|memes]].

Popular and critical reaction focused on the video's humor and on Crosson's impersonation. Additionally, [[CBS News]]' Bailey Johnson said that Crosson's version of the speech "seems to perfectly capture the national mood,"&lt;ref name="CBS20110505"/&gt; and ''[[Al Jazeera English|Al Jazeera]]'' 's "Listening Post" stated that Crosson's satirical interpretation "cuts through the usual diplomatic platitudes and delivers - what seems to be - a more honest ... account of what happened."&lt;ref name="Aljazeera20110514"/&gt;  CQ ''[[Roll Call]]'' Daily Briefing Editor David Hawkings remarked that the video "skewered the president's 'no drama' affect and at the same time captured the mood of the country in the days after the Abbottobad raid."&lt;ref name="CQHawkings20110902"/&gt;

==Content==
Three days after [[Barack Obama]]'s May 1, 2011 speech from the [[East Room (White House)|East Room]] of the [[White House]] announcing the [[death of Osama bin Laden]],&lt;ref name="Obama20110501"/&gt; actor, impressionist, dancer and Internet personality [[Iman Crosson]] posted a YouTube video "President Obama on Death of Osama bin Laden (SPOOF)"&lt;ref name="SPOOFvid"/&gt; that was a [[parody|spoof]] of Obama's speech.

In the video, the [[East Room (White House)|East Room]] spoof followed a spoken-word introduction by Crosson, impersonating Barack Obama sitting at a desk,&lt;ref name="QuotidianoIT20110507"/&gt; explaining that the rest of the video was an "alternative speech" that had not been chosen for broadcast, replaced by the "traditional speech" that Obama in fact delivered.&lt;ref name="Syracuse20110508"/&gt; In character with the spoof, TVGuide.com quipped, "originally, this diss track was supposed to be the nail in Osama's coffin."&lt;ref name="TVGuide20110506"/&gt;  [[CBS News]]' Bailey Johnson echoed that Crosson's version was "an earlier draft of the speech - a draft very different from the one that aired."&lt;ref name="CBS20110505"/&gt;

The spoof was delivered in [[Rapping|rap]] and included comedic dancing in an East Room-appearing backdrop, with ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' saying the video was "works in almost every [[Internet meme|meme]] from the last month."&lt;ref name="HuffPost20110506"/&gt; The video not only included topics relating to bin Laden's killing, but referenced Internet culture&lt;ref name="QuotidianoIT20110507"/&gt; including contemporary [[Internet meme|memes]] such as [[Charlie Sheen]]'s "Duh, Winning", [[Rebecca Black]], [[Antoine Dodson]], ENJ vs. Niks,&lt;ref name="Popdust20110506"/&gt; as well as snuggies, [[Donald Trump]], and [[Google Earth]].&lt;ref name="Syracuse20110508"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Loyal20110505"/&gt; The [[single (music)|single]] "Momentous Day"&lt;ref name="allsongsby20111026"/&gt; is derived from the [[Rapping|rap]] portion of the video.

Crosson ended his speech with "Oh that'll be two terms please, thank you,"&lt;ref name="Popdust20110506"/&gt; referring to Obama's possible 2012 re-election in view of his increased popularity&lt;ref name="TorontoStar20110508"/&gt; following the success of the bin Laden mission.

[[CBS News]]' Bailey Johnson contrasted Crosson's rap and dancing performance with Obama's "model of confidence, restraint, and calm authority," further stating that Crosson's version of the speech "seems to perfectly capture the national mood."&lt;ref name="CBS20110505"/&gt;  The [[San Francisco Chronicle]]'s "City Brights" contributor Zennie Abraham quoted Johnson and added that the video "exactly expresses what you and I both know Barack wanted to say after the Navy Seal Team 6 got to their objective."&lt;ref name="SFChron20110612"/&gt; ''[[Al Jazeera English|Al Jazeera]]'' 's "Listening Post" remarked that Crosson's satirical interpretation "cuts through the usual diplomatic platitudes and delivers - what seems to be - a more honest and rhythmically tuned account of what happened."&lt;ref name="Aljazeera20110514"/&gt; CQ ''[[Roll Call]]'' Daily Briefing Editor David Hawkings remarked that the video "skewered the president's 'no drama' affect and at the same time captured the mood of the country in the days after the Abbottobad raid."&lt;ref name="CQHawkings20110902"/&gt;

==Media coverage and popular response==
The video received substantial media attention within days, with the video's views-per-day actually increasing over the course of its first three days.&lt;ref name="YTfirstThree"/&gt;

Media attention included features from such news outlets and political commentators as 
[[CBS News]]'s Bailey Johnson,&lt;ref name="CBS20110505"/&gt;
''[[The Huffington Post]]''&lt;ref name="HuffPost20110506"/&gt; including Matt Wilstein,&lt;ref name="HuffPost20110804"/&gt;

recognition from comedy video websites such as [[Funny or Die]],&lt;ref name="FunnyOrDie20110510"/&gt;
in addition to mentions in a variety of pop, cultural and celebrity websites such as ''[[TV Guide]]''.&lt;ref name="TVGuide20110506"/&gt;

Within a day of the video's posting on YouTube, ''Excite'' (Italy) reported that ''L'imitatore numero uno del Presidente degli Stati Uniti'' (the number one impersonator of the President of the United States) had turned Obama's speech into [[rapping|rap]].&lt;ref name="ExciteIT20110505"/&gt; The same day, Obama's "comedic [[Doppelgänger|doppelganger]]" was said to have "spit hot fire" ... "with one of his best Obama impressions to date, ... his lyrics (being) pretty tight, especially coupled with his on-point presidential delivery and hitting his [[Teach Me How to Dougie|Dougie]]."&lt;ref name="SoulBounce20110505"/&gt; [[CBS News]]'s Bailey Johnson concluded that Crosson was "one of the best presidential impersonators working today."&lt;ref name="CBS20110505"/&gt; Calling Crosson "master of the interweb airwaves," Infotainment News remarked of the video, "yeah, it's a [[Internet meme|meme]], and the interweb will be full of them soon enough, but this is done with good clean humor."&lt;ref name="Infotain20110505"/&gt; NonAmos.com remarked that "It's difficult to strike a perfect balance between political satire and complete poor taste. But ... actor and impressionist Iman Crosson gets it right."&lt;ref name="Nonamos20110505"/&gt; "Alphacat is a legitimate genius for making this video spoof... Alphacat's touch up on the speech is much more than a comedic approach, it's a mass collection of all 2011 [[Internet meme|memes]], from [[Rebecca Black]]'s Friday, [[Charlie Sheen]]'s winning, to Dougies' [[Teach Me How to Dougie|Dougie]], it's an endless troupe of hilarity.&lt;ref name="Loyal20110505"/&gt;

On the second day after the video's posting on YouTube, ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' said that the video was "fast becoming a viral hit," and that Crosson "doesn't stop at getting the look and sound of the president down, he has created an impression that is almost a parallel worlds version of the man; one who raps or sings his way through every major event while maintaining his signature calm, collectedness.".&lt;ref name="HuffPost20110506"/&gt; [[MSNBC]]'s "The Last Word" linked to the video, remarking that "comedian Iman Crosson does a pretty spot-on impression of our Commander-in-Chief. He's also not half bad at writing political rhymes."&lt;ref name="MSNBC20110506"/&gt; TheRoot called it an "hilarious video" from "the man best known for his Obama impersonations during the 2008 elections."&lt;ref name="Root20110506"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TailorRadio20110506"/&gt; Fanpage Italia (Italy) called it "one of the most anticipated and successful parodies by... one of the most popular political Internet Webstars."&lt;ref name="FanpageIT20110506"/&gt; Crosson's impression of Obama was called "spot-on ... absolutely nailing the hand gestures and uh, vocal, uh, tics of our nation's 44th president."&lt;ref name="Popdust20110506"/&gt;

[[File:2011 Video views President Obama on Death of Osama Bin Laden.png | thumb | 300px | Daily video views after video was posted&lt;ref name=VideoViewArchived&gt;Raw data accessed from [[WebCite]] archives of YouTube video's page ([https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:2011_Video_views_President_Obama_on_Death_of_Osama_Bin_Laden.png details]).&lt;/ref&gt;]]
On the third day, ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine's Amanda Dobbins called Crosson "he of the spot-on YouTube Obama impersonations," saying "he really goes in" during the video&lt;ref name="NYMag20110507"/&gt;  ''Il Quotidiano Italiano'' (The Italian Daily (Newspaper)) wrote that Crosson was "punctual as always"&lt;ref name="QuotidianoIT20110507"/&gt; in his production of the video so quickly after the news event it was spoofing.  "Alphacat, one of the most popular political Internet Webstars... has not missed an opportunity to mount a parody ''ad hoc'' for this historic event."&lt;ref name="QuotidianoIT20110507"/&gt; ''The Moderate Voice'' expressed that "there have been some great spoofs of Obama in the past and this impersonator, Alphacat has been responsible for a good chunk of them. This new video has to be one of his best yet."&lt;ref name="ModVoice20110507"/&gt;

Ten days after the video was posted, ''[[Al Jazeera English|Al Jazeera]]'' 's "Listening Post" named Crosson's video "Internet Video of the Week," remarking "we found a clip of a talented Obama impersonator putting all his acting, singing and dancing skills to work."&lt;ref name="Aljazeera20110514"/&gt;

More than a month after the video was posted, ''The [[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' 's "City Brights" contributor Zennie Abraham commented on the spoof video and its related behind-the-scenes video, calling the spoof video "a work of genius."&lt;ref name="SFChron20110612"/&gt;

Video views were possible through various other websites that had shorter commentaries, but embedded Crosson's video:

'''''Sex to Sexty''''' was a sexually-oriented [[humor magazine]] published in [[Arlington, Texas|Arlington]], [[Texas]] by John W. Newbern, Jr. and Peggy Rodebaugh, with art direction (and cartoons, covers, etc.) by [[Lowell Davis]] (later to become known as a creator of bucolic art)&lt;ref&gt;[http://zombieswithcoffee.com/sex-to-sexty/ Davis, Phillip. "Sex to Sexty" ''Zombies With Coffee'' n.d.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Lowell+Davis%3a+Ozark+artist.-a04472030 Stoddard, Maynard Good. ''Lowell Davis: Ozark artist'' ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'' November 1, 1986]&lt;/ref&gt;), under the respective [[pseudonym]]s of Richard or Dick Rodman, Goose Reardon, and Pierre Davis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vance Randolph|Randolph, Vance]], edited with an introduction by [[Gershon Legman|G. Legman]]. ''Blow the Candle Out: "Unprintable" Ozark Songs and Folklore. Vol. II: Folk Rhymes and Other Lore'' Fayetteville, Arkansas: University of Arkansas Press, 1992; p. 943&lt;/ref&gt; 

The content was a mixture of risqué anecdotes; [[limericks]] (some by [[Gershon Legman]]) and other short humorous sexual poetry; and cartoons, the latter initially by Davis but soon expanding to include artists such as veteran [[good girl art]]ists [[Bill Ward (cartoonist)|Bill Ward]] and [[Bill Wenzel]]. It ran from 1964 to 1983. 

The company which published the magazine also published [[novelty song|novelty records]] and paperback books under the ''Sex to Sexty'' title.

== Critical reception ==
The first serious discussion of the magazine was published by [[Taschen]] in 2008, titled, Sex to Sexty'': The Most Vulgar Magazine Ever Made!'' {{ISBN|9783822852231}} edited by [[Dian Hanson]], with a preface by artist [[Mike Kelley (artist)|Mike Kelley]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2164">The '''sociology of knowledge approach to discourse''' ('''SKAD''') is a social science research programme for studying [[discourse]] developed by [[Reiner Keller]]&lt;ref&gt;Cf.

Reiner Keller: Doing Discourse Research - An Introduction for Social Scientists. London 2013&lt;/ref&gt; in order to analyze knowledge relationships and conditions in society. SKAD stems from the [[sociology of knowledge]] of [[Peter L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2047">The '''South Carolina Institute of Archaeology and Anthropology''', or '''SCIAA''', was founded in 1963 as a research institute at [[University of South Carolina]] and as a State cultural resource management agency. In the latter capacity, SCIAA is part of the Executive Department of the South Carolina State Government and serves as the main State agency concerned with the State's Archaeology (both [[Prehistoric archaeology|prehistoric]] and historic), and its discovery, study, interpretation, publication, and official conservation at its curatorial facilities. As a University research institute, SCIAA both initiates and conducts a wide spectrum of field investigations and collections research throughout [[South Carolina]]. SCIAA participates in numerous university projects, and is a significant part of the University's infrastructure, and the University's publication series.

[[Image:MarquetryOriental.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Oriental marquetry motif]]
'''Straw marquetry''' is a craft very similar to that of wood [[marquetry]], except that straw replaces the [[wood veneer]]. It is thought to have first been practised in the East; examples were brought to England in the 17th century.

To mimic the varying shades of wood veneer, [[wheat]] or [[oat]] straw has to be split, then soaked in cold, warm, or hot water. The strips are then ironed, and there will be a variety of tones from pale gold to deepest dark brown. 

There are accounts of nuns in France and Switzerland making a variety of items using straw marquetry.

The most famous straw marquetry was practised by prisoners of war from the [[Napoleonic wars]]. Dartmoor and other prisons had been built for them; the prison most famous for straw marquetry was Norman Cross, [[Huntingdon]]. 

[[Easter eggs]] are decorated with [[straw]] [[applique]], especially in Eastern European countries. Geometric shapes, stars and flower motifs are the most common themes. There is a slight difference in the way the straw is prepared, however; for marquetry, the straws are soaked, split and ironed; for [[Egg (biology)|egg]] decoration the straw is not ironed.

The '''Tabnit sarcophagus''' is the sarcophagus of the [[Phoenicia]]n king Tabnit of [[Sidon]] (c. 490 BCE),&lt;ref name="HF-Sidon"&gt;{{cite web|title=Middle East Kingdoms Ancient Central Levant States - Sidon|url=http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/KingListsMiddEast/CanaanSidon.htm|publisher=Kessler Associates|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the father of King [[Eshmunazar II sarcophagus|Eshmunazar II]]. The sarcophagus is decorated with two separate and unrelated inscriptions – one in [[Egyptian hieroglyphics]] and one in [[Phoenician script]]. It was created in the early 5th century BC, and was unearthed in 1887 by [[Osman Hamdi Bey]] at the Ayaa Necropolis near [[Sidon]] together with the [[Alexander Sarcophagus]] and other related sarcophagi. Tabnit's body was found floating perfectly preserved in the original [[embalming fluid]].&lt;ref name=Lembke/&gt;{{sfn|Torrey|1902|pp=168–9 (footnote)|ps=: "When the sarcophagus of Tabnit was exhumed, in the year 1887, and the lid was removed, the body of the king was found to be in a very good state of preservation. It was lying in a brownish-colored, somewhat "oily" fluid, which nearly filled the sarcophagus. The eyes were gone; the nose, lips, and the most prominent part of the thorax, which had not been covered by the liquid, had decayed away; in other respects, however, the corpse was like that of a man only recently buried. It was but slightly emaciated; plenty of flesh remained on both face and limbs, and the skin was soft to the touch. The vital organs and viscera had not been removed (a note-worthy circumstance), and were perfectly preserved. Dr. Shibly Abela, of Sidon, a physician of education and experience, remarked that the face showed traces of small-pox; it was not apparent, however, that the king had died of that disease. The color of the skin was described as somewhat "coppery," the tinge being perhaps due to the influence of some substance, or substances, held in solution by the enveloping fluid. The fluid itself may have been partly, or even wholly, rain-water, which finds its way into most of the tombs about Sidon; but in any case it is evident, from the facts just given, that the body of the king had been skilfully embalmed. I do not know that any similar case has ever been observed and reported. After the body had been removed from the sarcophagus and exposed to the sun. it decomposed and shrunk to withered skin and bones in a very short time. My chief authority for these facts is the Rev. William K. Eddy, of Sidon, a keen observer and cautious reporter, who was one of the few who saw and touched the body of Tabnit when it was first exposed to view. Mr. Eddy was positive in his opinion that the king, at the time of his death, had not passed middle life; the face, he thought, was that of a man of less than fifty years of age."}} Both the sarcophagus and Tabnit's decomposed skeleton are now in the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museums]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.istanbularkeoloji.gov.tr/web/33-97-1-1/muze_-_en/museum/museum/history/ İstanbul Archaeological Museums]&lt;/ref&gt;

The sarcophagus, together with the [[Eshmunazar II sarcophagus]], were possibly acquired by the Sidonians following their participation in the [[Battle of Pelusium (525 BC)]],{{sfn|Nitschke|2007|p=71|ps=: "Three of these Egyptian sarcophagi manufactured during the twenty-sixth dynasty were apparently acquired by the Sidonians, perhaps as a result of Phoenician participation in Cambyses’ conquest of Egypt in 525 B.C."}} and served as models for later Phoenician sarcophagi.{{sfn|Nitschke|2007|p=72}}

==Discovery==
[[File:Ayaa Necropolis, Sidon.png|thumb|left|Cross-section of the Ayaa Necropolis. The Tabnit sarcophagus is at the bottom left.]]
The tombs near Sidon were discovered in 1887 by the American [[Presbyterian]] minister William King Eddy (the father of [[William A. Eddy]]). [[William Wright (orientalist)|William Wright]] sent a letter to ''[[The Times]]'' with news of Eddy's discovery and imploring the [[British Museum]] to "take immediate measures to secure these treasures and prevent their falling into the hands of the vandal Turk". This alerted the new curator of the fledgling [[Istanbul Archaeological Museum]], [[Osman Hamdi Bey]], who arranged for a full excavation and the transfer of the sarcophagi to Istanbul.{{sfn|Jessup|1910|p=507a|ps=: "On the 14th of March a letter came from Mr. Eddy of a wonderful discovery in Sidon of ancient tombs, containing some white polished marble sarcophagi of exquisite beauty and marvellous sculpture. Mr. Eddy had been into the tombs hewn in the solid rock thirty feet below the surface and had measured and described all the sarcophagi of white and black marble with scientific exactness. On the 21st Dr. Eddy received from his son an elaborate report on the discovery which was intended to be sent to his brother Dr. Condit Eddy in New Rochelle. I obtained permission to make a copy for transmission to Dr. William Wright of London, and sent it by mail the next day. Dr. Wright sent it to the London Times with a note in which he expressed the hope that the authorities of the British Museum would "take immediate measures to secure these treasures and prevent their falling into the hands of the vandal Turk". The Times reached Constantinople. Now it happened that the department of antiquities at that time as now was under the charge of Hamdi Beg, a man educated in Paris, an artist, an engineer, and well up in archaeology. When he saw that article of Mr. Eddy's in the Times and Dr. Wright's letter, he said to himself (as he afterwards told us), "I'll show what the 'Vandal Turk' can do!"}}

During the excavation, the workmen opened the Tabnit sarcophagus and found "a human body floating in perfect preservation in a peculiar fluid". Whilst Hamdi Bey was at lunch, the workmen overturned the sarcophagus and poured the fluid out, such that the "secret of the wonderful fluid was again hidden in the Sidon sand".{{sfn|Jessup|1910|p=507b|ps=: "One sarcophagus, when the lid was opened, contained a human body floating in perfect preservation in a peculiar fluid. The flesh was soft and perfect in form and colour. But, alas, while Hamdi Beg was at lunch, the over-officious Arab workmen overturned it and spilled all the precious fluid on the sand. The beg's indignation knew no bounds, but it was too late and the body could not be preserved, and the secret of the wonderful fluid was again hidden in the Sidon sand."}}&lt;ref name=Lembke&gt;{{citation|title=Phönizische Anthropoide Sarkophage by Katja Lembke|first=Eric|last=Gubel|journal=Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research|volume=332|year=2003|pages=98–100|jstor=1357812}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamdi Bey noted in 1892 that he had kept a portion of the sludge that remained in the bottom of the sarcophagus.{{sfn|Hamdi Bey|1892|pp=101–103|ps=:"Alors seulement nous pûmes enfin voir l'intérieur du sarcophage. Une couche de sable jaunâtre et humide de laquelle émergeaient la face décharnée, les clavicules, les rotules, ainsi que le bout des pieds auxquels manquaient les doigts, remplissait le fond de la cuve jusqu'à 25 centimètres de ses bords... Débarrassé du couvercle, je fis d'abord tirer de la cuve le corps du roi et j'ordonnai de l'étendre sur une planche pour l'emporter dehors et le confier au docteur Mourad Effendi, médecin municipal de Saïda, que j'avais chargé de le mettre en état d'être transporté à constantinople; car tous les muscles des parties postérieures ainsi que tous les organes internes du thorax et de l'abdomen étaient parfaitement conservés. Apres avoir fait vider la cuve, je conservai une portion de la boue formée de sable et de pourriture qu'elle contenait, et je fis passer le reste à travers un crible quand cette boue eut été, au préalable, délayée dans l'eau. Rien n'y a été trouvé, si ce n'est quelques fragments d'anneaux en argent."}}

==Inscription==
The inscription is known as '''[[Kanaanäische und Aramäische Inschriften|KAI]] 13'''. The [[Egyptian hieroglyphic]] inscription shows that the sarcophagus was originally intended for an Egyptian general named "Pen-Ptah" (pꜣ-n-pth).&lt;ref&gt;[http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/context-of-scripture/the-sarcophagus-inscription-of-tabnit-king-of-sidon-2-56-aCOSB_2_56 Context of Scripture 2.56], P.

==Dating==
[[File:Sarcophagus of Horkhebit2007.jpg|thumb|150px|The sarcophagus of Horkhebit, from [[Saqqara]], is very similar in style.]]
Both the Tabnit sarcophagus and the [[Eshmunazar II sarcophagus]] are thought to originally date from the [[Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt]], which had its capital at [[Sais, Egypt|Sais]].{{sfn|Nitschke|2007|p=72}} This is partially due to their resemblance to similar sarcophagi such as the [[Psamtik II]]-era Horkhebit sarcophagus from [[Saqqara]], now in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].

'''''The Cambridge History of Iran''''' is a multi-volume survey of [[Iranian history]] published by [[Cambridge University Press]]. The seven volumes cover "the history and historical geography of the land which is present-day Iran, as well as other territories inhabited by peoples of Iranian descent, from prehistoric times up to the present.&lt;ref name=EI&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Darke|first=Hubert|title=Cambridge history of Iran|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/cambridge-history-of-iran|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Iranica|volume=vol. 4|isbn=0-939214-78-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The publication started in 1968 and in 1989 the last volume was published. The idea of publishing such a survey of Iranian history and culture was conceived in 1959 by [[Arthur J. Arberry]]. According to the scholar Hubert Darke "The series was planned to be not simply a political history of Iran but to survey the culture which has flourished in the Iranian region and this culture’s contribution to the civilization of the world. All aspects of the religious, philosophical, economic, scientific, and artistic elements in Iranian civilization have been studied, but with some emphasis on the geographical and ecological factors that have contributed to its special character."&lt;ref name=EI/&gt;

The series consists of seven volumes. Volume 3 was published in two parts.&lt;ref name=EI/&gt;

'''''The Great Theatre of Dutch Painters''''', or ''De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen'', as it was originally known in Dutch, is a series of artist biographies with engraved portraits written by the 18th-century painter [[Arnold Houbraken]]. It was published in three volumes as a sequel to [[Karel van Mander]]'s own list of biographies known as the ''[[Schilder-boeck]]''. The first volume appeared in 1718, and was followed by the second volume in 1719, the year Houbraken died. The third and last volume was published posthumously by Houbraken's wife and children in 1721. This work is considered to be a very important source of information on 17th-century artists of the Netherlands. The ''Schouburg'' is listed as one of the 1000 most important works in the [[Canon of Dutch Literature]] from the Middle Ages to today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbnl.org/basisbibliotheek/index.php?c=17 Website of the ''Basic Library'' of the dbnl, the section on the Golden Age] (in Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and influence==
The ''Schouburg'' was not the first sequel to Karel van Mander's work. Various authors had attempted to illustrate Van Mander's work and in 1649, [[Jan Meyssen]] published ''Image de divers hommes'' in imitation of [[Van Dyck|Anthony van Dyck]]'s ''Iconography''. [[Cornelis de Bie]] published his ''[[Het Gulden Cabinet]]'' in 1662, [[André Félibien]] published his ''Entretiens sur les vies et sur les ouvrages des plus excellents peintres anciens et modernes'' in 1666, and these were followed by [[Jacob von Sandrart]]'s illustrated ''Teutsche Akademie'' in 1668. Houbraken was very familiar with ''Inleyding tot de Hooge Schoole der Schilderkonst'', 1678, published by his teacher [[Samuel Dirksz van Hoogstraten|Samuel van Hoogstraten]] for students of art. [[Roger de Piles]] published ''L'Abrégé de la vie des peintres'' in the 1690s followed by [[Florent le Comte]] with his ''Cabinet des singularitez'' in 1699. As a gifted engraver, Houbraken wished to correct mistakes and omissions in these earlier works, while updating biographies with engraved portraits of artists. All of these works were used as sources for Houbraken and he mentions them in the first chapter of his first volume.

The ''Schouburg'' was published in three volumes, the first of which was simply meant as an addendum to Karel van Mander's work, and listed about 200 artists born between 1466 (starting with [[Erasmus]]) and 1613 (ending with [[Jacques van Artois]]) that had been omitted or whose lives extended beyond Van Mander's 1604 publication date. The popularity of this volume was such that a second volume was prepared immediately, while plans were made to continue the project up to the period in which Houbraken was writing at the start of the 18th century.

While leaning heavily on the sources already mentioned, Houbraken also consulted local history books of various cities in the Netherlands. Other, unpublished sources for his material came from various contacts via his professional network, mostly members of [[Guild of St. Luke|St. Luke Guilds]] in Holland. He listed many men who became members of the [[Bentvueghels]] group in [[Rome]] while on their [[Grand Tour]], but he also listed most of the men in a competency list drawn up by [[Vincent van der Vinne]] before he died in 1702. Houbraken kept to a system of importance where capitals meant very important, and lower case were honorable mentions. Though the capitalized names were meant for the index, the index of the first volume was far from complete at the time of publication. A later edition of all three books in 1756 contains an improved index and this book is now available on line in the [[Digital library for Dutch literature]].

===Notable omissions===
The absence from Houbraken's work of several painters who are now much more highly regarded than very many painters he considered noteworthy, is an interesting feature of the work, and reveals changes in taste since his time; the most notorious omission is [[Jan Vermeer]], who is mentioned once in passing.  One must not forget however, that Houbraken himself died before publishing the final work, and he mentions again and again the impossibility of a complete list. In his first volume he includes painters that he complained were oversights by Karel van Mander, who he regarded as his greatest example. He highly respected all artist biographers who came before him, such as Sandrart, de Bie, and de Lairesse. In fact, Houbraken was quite keen to include painters that he thought were overlooked before him, and was quite thorough in his endeavors. Therefore, his omissions are equally the omissions of previous biographers, though it is Houbraken who receives all the blame. Unfortunately we don't know the exact state of his book at the time of his death, but his son Jacob, his daughter Antonina, and his wife all helped to patch things up for publication, and it is quite possible that their own opinions slipped into the finished work. In general, Houbraken tends to follow the contemporary prejudices of the [[hierarchy of genres]] and undervalue [[landscapist]]s, [[marine artist]]s and painters of [[still life]]. One can also speak of certain prejudices of the Houbraken family. These were in order:

* '''Family dynasties''': All painters who made up a family dynasty received extra space in the book. More space was given to the founder of the dynasty than to any other member (note that Houbraken considered himself the founder of his own family dynasty). An example is that though [[Rachel Ruysch]] was the most famous painter of her family, Houbraken devotes more space to her grandfather Pieter Post and his brother Frans. Similarly, though [[Wouter Crabeth II]] was the most famous painter of the family, Houbraken devotes more space to his illustrious heritage in Gouda, the glass painters Dirk and Wouter.
* '''Engravers''': Houbraken had a business of his own in biographical engravings, and his large family probably all helped in the business, with his son and daughter helping with the oval portraits. Houbraken was quick to realize the importance of reprints, and used them whenever possible for art provenance. He highly respected good engravings. Therefore he was heavily prejudiced towards artists who were also good draftsmen and engravers, such as Rembrandt and the Visschers. He includes also notes about various publishers and engravers, who did not paint at all.
* '''Rome''': Houbraken had great respect for all artists who took the trouble and overcame many hardships to travel to Rome. He went to great pains to add entries for the entire list of painters mentioned in a poem about the [[Bentvueghels]].
* '''Flattery''': As a Mennonite, Houbraken would have been against flattery; however, he writes again and again of the importance of flattering one's patrons in his books, and a recurring theme is when an artist fell onto bad times because he failed to flatter his patron. This type of artist is admired by Houbraken as a sort of "martyr to the artist's cause". Examples of flatterers that Houbraken deprecates are Anthony van Dyck  and Sir Peter Lely followers, and his omissions speak for themselves if we note famous portrait painters of his day such as [[Adriaen Hanneman]], [[Johannes Cornelisz Verspronck]] and [[Thomas de Keyser]]. Similarly, though architecture was considered one of the highest genre's, the popular "family portrait with a view of the house or garden" was omitted as a genre entirely from Houbraken's praise, since this just showed off the wealth of the sitters. Thus landscape-portraitists were often omitted or deprecated, such as [[Hendrik van Steenwijk II]] and his wife.
* '''Religion''': Certainly Houbraken included artists of all religions in his book, but we can say that Mennonites are over-represented (see his story on the Mennonite martyr [[Jan Woutersz van Cuyck]]), while Catholics are under-represented. These were the De Grebbers, the De Brays, the Ruisdael family, Jan Vermeer, [[Adriaen Coorte]], Adriaen Hanneman, Johannes Cornelisz Verspronck, [[Hendrick Dubbels]], [[Pieter Anthonisz. van Groenewegen]], [[Meindert Hobbema]], and others.

Other notorious omissions are [[Jan van de Cappelle]], [[Judith Leyster]], [[Jan Wynants]], [[Jacobus Mancadan]],  [[Hendrick Avercamp]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;Vermeer, Ruysch, and Leyster were mentioned, but only briefly.  The subject is dealt with in ''Arnold Houbraken's "Groote Schouburgh" and the Canon of Seventeenth-Century Dutch Painting'', by Bart Cornelis, Simiolus: Netherlands Quarterly for the History of Art, Vol. 26, No. 3 (1998), pp. 144-161, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3780895 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schilderessen==
Translated, the title of the book is ''Theatre of Painters and Paintresses'', indicating that Houbraken wrote about women painters, or ''schilderessen''. However, the list of women he included in the book is really quite short. Though he included short biographies of very many painters who were closely related to women painters, the only paintresses he included by name were: [[Artemisia Gentileschi]], [[Anna Francisca de Bruijns]], [[Mayken Verhulst]], [[Anna Maria van Schurman]], [[Margaretha van Godewijk]], [[Maria de Grebber]] (sister of [[Pieter de Grebber]]), [[Maria Potter]], [[Alida Withoos]], [[Catharina Oostfries]] (from a glaspainting family, married glasspainter [[Claes van der Meulen]]), [[Maria van Oosterwijk]], [[Geertgen Wyntges]] (who he mentions as being the servant of Maria van Oosterwijk), [[Anna Katrina]], [[Catharina Rozee]] (1632–82), [[Adriana Spilberg]] (daughter of [[Johannes Spilberg]]), [[Rachel Ruysch]], the three sisters [[Anna Maria van Thielen]], [[Françoise Katharina van Thielen]], and [[Maria Theresa van Thielen]], [[Marie Duchatel]], [[Diana Glauber]], [[Maria Sybilla Merian]], [[Margaretha Wulfraet]], and [[Johanna Koerten Blok]]. Of these, he included illustrations of only three women: Schurman, Merian, and Koerten-Blok. Houbraken also mentioned two poetesses; [[Gesina Brit]] and [[Catharina Questiers]].

{{nihongo|'''Toro'''|登呂 遺跡|''Toro iseki''}} is an [[archaeological site]] in [[Suruga-ku, Shizuoka|Suruga Ward]] in [[Shizuoka, Shizuoka|Shizuoka City]], {{convert|130|km|mi}} south of [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]].  The remains there date to the 1st century CE, in the late [[Yayoi period]], and was an administrative unit of the area.  Discovered in 1943, it was excavated in 1947–48 and designated a Special Historic Site of Japan in 1952.  Toro is also the name of the area surrounding it in the [[Japanese addressing system]].

==Background==

Toro is notable as the first archaeological site excavated in Japan in which remains of 1st-century CE Yayoi-era wet-rice [[paddy field]]s were found.{{sfnm|1a1=Aikens|1a2=Higuchi|1y=1982|p=226|2a1=Bahn|2y=2001|2p=451}}  The site was discovered in 1943 during construction work on a military munitions plant in [[World War II]], and was excavated in 1947 and 1948. In 1965 an excavation survey was conducted before the construction of [[Tōmei Expressway]] within the planned route.&lt;ref name=hajimeni&gt;{{cite web |title=Hajimeni|trans-title= Introduction |language= ja|url= http://www.city.shizuoka.jp/deps/bunkazai/bunkazai_tyousa_toronews_index.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220072553/http://www.city.shizuoka.jp/deps/bunkazai/bunkazai_tyousa_toronews_index.html |year= |archive-date= 2015-02-20|publisher= Bunkazai-ka Department, Shizuoka City|access-date= 2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as the agricultural remains, archaeological findings included  [[Dugout (shelter)|pit-houses]], refuse pits, and raised-floor buildings. Many artifacts were also unearthed. The preservation at the Toro site was so complete that a large number of 2000-year-old wooden farming tools were excavated.{{sfn|Aikens|Higuchi|1982|pp=235–237}} The site was re-excavated from 1999–2003 (Heisei 11–16),&lt;ref name=hajimeni/&gt; during which time additional artifacts were uncovered.{{sfn|Okamura|date=2002|pp=113-122}}&lt;ref name=tosyokan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tosyokan.pref.shizuoka.jp/data/open/cnt/3/50/6/ssr4-60.pdf|title= Toro iseki no hakkutsu—sengo kōkogaku to shakai ni ataeta kakkisei|trans-title= Excavation of Toro Site—Breakthrough it gave to post WWII archeology and society in Japan|page= 131|publisher= |access-date= 2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The archaeological remains from Toro elicited such an intense interest from Japanese archaeologists that the [[Japanese Archaeological Association]] was formed to study it.{{sfnm|1a1=Aikens|1a2=Higuchi|1y=1982|p=226|2a1=Bahn|2y=2001|2p=451}} Toro has been used as a [[type site]] for Yayoi culture despite the fact that the location of the settlement in the [[Tōkai region]] was peripheral to what has traditionally been considered the Yayoi formation area in northern [[Kyūshū]].{{sfn|Bahn|2001|p=451}}

==Site==

[[File:Shizuoka City Toro Museum.JPG|thumb|alt=|Shizuoka City Toro Museum]]

The total area of the Toro site is {{convert|330000|m2|sqft|sigfig=2|abbr=on}}. Twelve pit-houses were excavated but as the archaeologists were not able to establish the boundaries of the original Yayoi settlement, the true size of the village is unknown and may have been much larger. In addition to the houses, two raised-floor buildings were found. Archaeologists interpret these as storehouses.{{sfn|Brown|1993|pp=80–91}}

The Toro pit-dwellings had a roughly {{convert|6|x|8|m|ft|adj=on}} living area, with a double skirting wall approximately {{convert|30|cm|in|abbr=on}} high around the circumference. Four wooden posts were sunk into the ground, with beams connecting at the top, and rafters radiating down to the ground level. The whole was covered in thatch. Within, the floor level was even with the outside ground, and a hearth was sunk into the floor in the center. The elevated buildings had an entrance ladder carved from a single log of wood. These buildings were apparently built of planks, using a [[mortise and tenon]] joinery method, which indicates that the builders had use of iron tools.{{sfn|Nishi|1996}}{{page needed|date=February 2013}}

Approximately 30 rice paddies were uncovered, along with {{convert|370|m|ft|abbr=on}} of associated narrow [[canal]]s and waterways.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

The site is now preserved as a public park with reconstructed buildings and rice fields,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.shizuoka-toromuseum.jp/around/|title= Shūhen shisetsu no goannai—Toro-iseki kōen annnaizu|trans-title= The park and archaeological site map |language= ja|publisher= Shizuoka City Toro Museum|access-date= 2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Toro-iseki no saisēbi kōji ni tsuite|trans-title= Reconstruction plans for Toro archaeological site area|language= ja|url= http://www.city.shizuoka.jp:80/deps/bunkazai/bunkazai_torosaiseibi.htm|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080216200645/http://www.city.shizuoka.jp/deps/bunkazai/bunkazai_torosaiseibi.htm|archive-date= 2008-02-16|publisher= Shizuoka City|access-date= 2017-10-10|deadurl= yes|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is protected by the Japanese government as a National Historic Monument.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1477">'''Training excavations''' are normally run by university departments or large contractors and employ professional [[archaeologists]] to teach the basics of archaeological methodology, including [[photography]], [[stratigraphy]], [[Archaeological illustration| illustration]] and draughtsmanship as well as survey, and finds treatment.  

The main element of a training excavation is the student or paying volunteer.  Often the [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] site is large and [[rural]], and can be worked on over the summer period for several weeks, with many groups arriving over the period for training.  Many sites are only excavated due to this type of practice, where development is not pressing for completion and more time can be taken in the long term investigation of the site and training of new archaeologists.  The standard of  training on an [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] can be variable though, with some sites run by academic archaeologists who are not up to date with current practice.

A '''vanitas''' is a symbolic work of art showing the transience of life, the futility of pleasure, and the certainty of death, often contrasting symbols of wealth and symbols of ephemerality and death. Best-known are ''vanitas'' [[still life]]s, a common genre in [[Netherlandish art]] of the 16th and 17th centuries; they have also been created at other times and in other [[medium (art)|media]] and [[Genre#Visual arts|genres]].&lt;ref&gt;Search for 'vanitas' at Harvard Art Museums: [https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/?q=vanitas]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

The [[Latin]] noun [[wikt:vanitas#Latin|''vanitas'']] (from the Latin adjective ''vanus'' 'empty') means 'emptiness', 'futility', or 'worthlessness', the traditional Christian view being that earthly goods and pursuits are transient and worthless.&lt;ref&gt;Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0059:entry=vanitas ''s.v.'']&lt;/ref&gt; It alludes to [[Ecclesiastes]] {{bibleref2-nb|Eccl.|1:2; 12:8|VULGATE}}, where ''vanitas'' translates the Hebrew word ''hevel'', which also includes the concept of transitoriness.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel C. Fredericks, ''Coping with Transience: Ecclesiastes on Brevity in Life'', p. 15 and ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Oxford Treasury of Sayings and Quotations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IYOcAQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |first=Susan |last=Ratcliffe |date=October 13, 2011 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press|OUP]] |location=[[Oxford]] |id={{ISBN|0-19960912-8}} |isbn=978-0-199-60912-3 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=IYOcAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA127&amp;dq=%226+Vanitas+vanitatum%22+futility 127]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=From Bonbon to Cha-cha.

==Themes==
[[File:Pier Francesco Cittadini Vanitas-Stillleben.jpg|thumb|245px|[[Pier Francesco Cittadini]] from 17th century school]]

Vanitas themes were common in medieval funerary art, with most surviving examples in sculpture. By the 15th century, these could be extremely morbid and explicit, reflecting an increased obsession with death and decay also seen in the ''[[Ars moriendi]],'' the ''[[Danse Macabre]]'', and the overlapping motif of the ''[[Memento mori]].''  From the Renaissance such motifs gradually became more indirect and, as the still-life genre became popular, found a home there.  Paintings executed in the vanitas style were meant to remind viewers of the transience of life, the futility of pleasure, and the certainty of death. They also provided a moral justification for painting attractive objects
.

==Motifs==
[[File:Harmen Steenwijck - Vanitas.JPG|245px|thumb|left|''Vanitas'' by [[Harmen Steenwijck]]]]

Common vanitas symbols include skulls, which are a reminder of the certainty of death; rotten fruit (decay); bubbles (the brevity of life and suddenness of death); smoke, watches, and hourglasses (the brevity of life); and musical instruments (brevity and the ephemeral nature of life). Fruit, flowers and butterflies can be interpreted in the same way, and a peeled lemon was, like life, attractive to look at but bitter to taste. Art historians debate how much, and how seriously, the vanitas theme is implied in still-life paintings without explicit imagery such as a skull. As in much moralistic genre painting, the enjoyment evoked by the sensuous depiction of the subject is in a certain conflict with the moralistic message.&lt;ref&gt;For more on this topic, see [https://books.google.it/books?id=QkeBswEACAAJ&amp;dq=the+living+dead+ecclesiastes+through+art&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiYx7rVrrDdAhXIKewKHZ9oB1MQ6AEIKTAA ''The Living Dead: Ecclesiastes through Art''], exh. cat. edited by Corinna Ricasoli, Paderborn: Ferdinand Schöningh 2018, and the bibliography therein.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Composition of flowers'' is a  less obvious style of Vanitas by [[Abraham Mignon]] in the [[National Museum, Warsaw]]. Barely visible amid vivid and perilous nature (snakes, poisonous mushrooms), a bird skeleton is a symbol of vanity and shortness of life.

[[File:Religijne symbole0.png|thumb|right|The world religions paradigm selects a small number of religious groups which it classes as 'major'.]]
'''World religions''' is a category used in the [[Religious studies|study of religion]] to demarcate the five—and in some cases six—largest and most internationally widespread religious movements. [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Hinduism]], and [[Buddhism]] are always included in the list, being known as the "Big Five". Some scholars also include another religion, such as [[Sikhism]], [[Zoroastrianism]], or the [[Bahá'í Faith]], in the category. 

The world religions paradigm was developed in the United Kingdom in the 1960s, where it was pioneered by [[phenomenology of religion|phenomenological]] scholars like [[Ninian Smart]]. It was designed to broaden the study of religion away from its heavy focus on Christianity by taking into account other large religious traditions around the world.  
The paradigm is often used by lecturers instructing undergraduate students in the study of religion and is also the framework used by school teachers in the UK and other countries. The paradigm's emphasis on viewing these religious movements as distinct and mutually exclusive entities has also had a wider impact on the categorisation of religion—for instance in censuses—in both Western countries and elsewhere.

Since the late twentieth century, the paradigm has faced critique by scholars of religion like [[Jonathan Z. Smith]], some of whom have argued for its abandonment. Critics have argued that the world religions paradigm is inappropriate because it takes the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] variant of Christianity as the model for what constitutes religion; that it is tied up with discourses of modernity, including modern power relations; that it encourages an uncritical understanding of religion; and that it makes a value judgement as to what religions should be considered "major". Others have argued that it remains useful in the classroom, so long as students are made aware that it is a socially constructed category.

==Definition==

The scholars of religion Christopher R. Cotter and David G. Robertson described the "World Religions Paradigm" as "a particular way of thinking about religions which organizes them into a set of discrete traditions with a supposedly 'global' import."{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016a|p=vii}} It typically consists of the "Big Five" religions: [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]], [[Islam]], [[Hinduism]], and [[Buddhism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Owen|1y=2011|1p=254|2a1=Cotter|2a2=Robertson|2y=2016b|2p=2}} 
As noted by Cotter and Robertson, the "Big Five" religions are often listed in an "Abrahamocentric order" which places the largest three [[Abrahamic religions]]—Christianity, Judaism, and Islam—before the non-Abrahamic religions Hinduism and Buddhism.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=2}} The category is sometimes also extended to include other religious groups, namely [[Sikhism]], [[Zoroastrianism]], and the [[Bahá'í Faith]].{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=254}}

The inclusion of Judaism in the Big Five raises some issues; it is included in the list because of its influence on Christianity and Islam and because of its relevance to traditional Western understandings of Western history.{{sfn|Taira|2016|p=80}} On demographic grounds, it does not fit into the list, for there are far fewer Jews in the world than there are Christians, Muslims, Hindus, and Buddhists.{{sfn|Taira|2016|p=80}} Similarly, it does not fit into the list if the groups are defined by a desire to spread internationally, because Judaism is typically non-proselytizing.{{sfn|Taira|2016|p=80}}

Many scholars have utilised the "World Religions" category alongside other "catch-all" categories such as "[[new religious movements]]" and "[[indigenous religions]]".{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=2}} The scholar Steven J. Sutcliffe compared the relationship between the three categories to the [[English football league system]], with the "world" religions forming a [[Premier League]], the "new" religions forming a [[EFL Championship|Championship]], and "indigenous" religions a [[Football League First Division|First Division]].{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2016|p=26}} That groups that get placed in categories like "indigenous religions" get treated less seriously than the "world religions" by many scholars was noted by the scholar of religion Graham Harvey, who maintained that "indigenous religions should receive similarly respectful treatment to that considered appropriate to the larger 'World Religions'."{{sfn|Harvey|2000|p=3}}

==History==

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=While the World Religions paradigm was brought in to allow the inclusion of non-Christian religions in education, it has instead remodelled them according to liberal Western Protestant Christian values (akin to what the [[Church of England]] promotes), emphasizing theological categories..|source=— Scholar of religion Suzanne Owen, 2011{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=258}} }}

Cotter and Robertson noted that the history of the world religions paradigm is "intimately tied up" with the history of the study of religion as an academic discipline.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=3}} It emerged from within the [[phenomenology of religion]] approach which placed an emphasis on description rather than critical analysis.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=258}} 

The paradigm was integrated throughout the education system through work of scholars like [[Ninian Smart]], who formed the Shap Working Party on World Religions in Education in 1969.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=254}} It was introduced with the intent of moving Western education away from its focus on Christianity.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=254}} However, it took liberal Western Protestantism as its baseline and interpreted these different religious traditions through the framework of liberal Protestant norms and values.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=254}} This included an emphasis on [[theology]] as being central to a given religion.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=254}} It also reflects the post-Enlightenment Christian approach of treating different religious groups as distinct, mutually exclusive categories.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=260}} It thus reflects the socio-political concerns of 1960s Britain, the environment in which it was devised.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=259}}

The paradigm has since gone beyond this academic discipline, and "informs the perception" of many members of different religious groups.{{sfn|Ramey|2016|p=50}} The paradigm for instance frames the teaching about religion in the British education system; at all three [[Key Stage]]s, British teachers are instructed to teach about Christianity, while by the end of key Stage 3 they are also supposed to teach about the other "five principal religions": Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, and Sikhism.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=263}} Similarly, the censuses of many countries for instance reflect the influence of the world religion paradigm by only permitting respondents to describe themselves as adhering to one particular religious tradition, whereas in reality many individuals identify themselves with various different traditions at the same time.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=260}} This idea of mutually exclusive religious identities is not only a Western phenomenon, but can also be found in other socio-cultural contexts; [[Hindu nationalism|Hindu nationalists]] for instance often endorse the idea that Hinduism and Buddhism are mutually exclusive categories despite the fact that many people in South Asia mix Hindu and Buddhist practices.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=260}}
The scholars of religion Tara Baldrick-Morrone, Michael Graziano, and Brad Stoddard stated that "the WRP is neither neutral nor natural, but its social authority derives from appearing as both."{{sfn|Baldrick-Morrone|Graziano|Stoddard|2016|p=38}}

==Criticism==

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=[A 'world religion' is] a tradition that has achieved sufficient power and numbers to enter our history to form it, interact with it, or thwart it. We recognise both the unity within and the diversity among the world religions because they correspond to important geopolitical entities with which we must deal. All 'primitives,' by way of contrast, may be lumped together, as may the 'minor religions,' because they do not confront our history in any direct fashion. From the point of view of power, they are invisible.|source=— Scholar of religion [[J. Z. Smith]], 1998{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=8}} }}

The utility of the  World Religions Paradigm has experienced a sustained and rigorous critique from many scholars of religion.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=7}} In 1978, the scholar of religion [[Jonathan Z. Smith]] for example called it a "dubious category".{{sfn|Smith|1978|p=295}}

One of the major criticisms of the framework is that it is based on a model of 'religion' that is highly reliant on using the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] version of Christianity as its base example.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=7}} A second criticism is that it is rooted in the discourses of modernity, including the [[power relations]] present in modern society.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=7}} Smith observed that it was constructed by Western scholars from a Western perspective. He noted that the only religions that get included in it are those which have "achieved sufficient power and numbers to enter our [i.e. Western] history, either to form it, interact with it, or to thwart it" and represent "important geo-political entities with which we must deal."{{sfn|Smith|1978|p=295}} The framework also includes privileging the literate elites active in particular religious movements by presenting their interpretations of particular traditions as being authoritative, eclipsing alternative interpretations presented by non-literate, marginalised, and localized practitioners.{{sfnm|1a1=Owen|1y=2011|1p=255|2a1=Cotter|2a2=Robertson|2y=2016b|2pp=8–9}} For instance, as noted by the scholar of religion Suzanne Owen, "Hinduism as a World Religion does not include Hinduism as a village religion".{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=255}}

A third criticism of the world religions paradigm is that it encourages an uncritical and ''sui generis'' model of 'religion'.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=7}} It presents each of the 'world religions' in an abstracted and essentialised form, failing to take account of hybridization.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=259}} For instance, in teaching about Christianity it does not refer to [[reincarnation]], because this is not typically regarded as a Christian doctrine, and yet there are Christians who profess a belief in reincarnation.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=259}}
A fourth criticism is that in choosing to focus attention on the "major" religions, it makes a value judgement as to what constitutes "major" and what does not.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=12}} 

===Paradigm in pedagogy===

Many scholars of religion have resisted efforts to challenge the paradigm,{{sfn|Cox|2016|p=xii}} and as of 2016 was reported as still being widespread in university introductory courses to the study of religion.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=10}} Many instructors feel that explaining the critique of the world religions paradigm to undergraduate students would be difficult, as the critique would be too complex for many of them to understand.{{sfn|Ramey|2016|p=49}} Its continued use has also been defended by the claim that it is what undergraduate students expect and that it mirrors what they will have been taught at school.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=254}}

Some scholars have argued for the rejection of the world religions paradigm altogether; Cotter and Robertson presented the argument that "the continued uncritical use of the WRP fosters a breeding ground for relativistic navel-gazing which has no place in the contemporary research university".{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=10}} Owen was of the view that "as long as it continues to employ the World Religions paradigm as a default approach (even after deconstructing it), religious studies will fail in its humanistic task" because it will simply be engaging in "knowledge transfer" and not "critically engaging" with "culture and knowledge".{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=257}} One alternative framework that some scholars use to teach about religion is the "[[lived religion]]" paradigm, which places emphasis not on distinct religious traditions but on individual experiences and practices.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=12}} Another alternative is the "[[material religion]]" framework which focuses on examining religion through [[material culture]] and physical objects.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|pp=12–13}} Owen noted that, in her experience, many students display an "initial resistance to alternatives" as they are expecting the world religions paradigm. She cited the example of her introductory course at [[Leeds Trinity University College]], which was constructed on thematic lines rather than according to the world religions paradigm, and which induced feelings of panic among many undergraduates.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=258}}

Many scholars who are critical of the world religions paradigm find themselves having to teach it as part of introductory courses for undergraduate students.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=258}} Some spent much of a course teaching the concept and then several sessions after this deconstructing it.{{sfn|Owen|2011|p=258}} Some scholars have suggested that even when students are taught using the world religions paradigm, it could be a good means of encouraging them to think critically about category formation.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016b|p=13}} The scholar Steven W. Ramey for instance advocated teaching the paradigm in a manner that makes it clear that it is a "constructed discourse".{{sfn|Ramey|2016|p=48}} Similarly, Baldrick-Morrone, Graziano, and Stoddard suggested that teaching undergraduates about the world religious paradigm helps to explain to students how "classification is a social act".{{sfn|Baldrick-Morrone|Graziano|Stoddard|2016|p=39}} They noted that students could leave such a course not only knowing more about the specific religious traditions included in the world religions category, but that they would also leave "knowing how to better interrogate the world around them".{{sfn|Baldrick-Morrone|Graziano|Stoddard|2016|p=39}} To avoid promoting the paradigm's portrayal of different religious traditions as rigid, homogenous categories, the scholar Teemu Taira suggested introducing [[ethnography|ethnographic]] case studies into the class to better explain the realities of people's lives and uses of religious traditions.{{sfn|Taira|2016|p=82}}
