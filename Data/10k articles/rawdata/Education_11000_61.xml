The '''Arbor Day Foundation''' is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit conservation and education organization founded in 1972 in [[Nebraska]], [[United States]], by John Rosenow. It is the largest nonprofit membership organization dedicated to tree planting.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://panro.org/nonprofitdescriptions.html ''Nonprofit Descriptions'': Arbor Day Foundation]". Professional Association of Nonprofit Reforestation Organizations. panro.org. Retrieved 2017-04-22.&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation's stated corporate mission is "to inspire people to plant, nurture, and celebrate trees."&lt;ref name="ADF-About"&gt;"[https://www.arborday.org/generalinfo/about.cfm About the Arbor Day Foundation]". Arbor Day Foundation. arborday.org. Retrieved 2017-04-22.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Foundation programs are supported by members, donors, and corporate sponsors that share the same vision of a healthier and greener world.&lt;ref name="ADF-About"/&gt;

==History of Arbor Day==
{{see also|Arbor Day#Origins|Arbor Day#United States}}
In 1872, [[Julius Sterling Morton|J. Sterling Morton]] started what would become Arbor Day in [[Nebraska City, Nebraska|Nebraska City]], [[Nebraska]]. This "holiday" is meant to recognize and support the planting of trees. Morton and his wife Caroline challenged people around the country to plant trees.  In 1872, on the first Arbor Day, approximately one million trees were planted in Nebraska alone. Sterling and Caroline Morton lived in Nebraska City on a 72-acre estate, which is now known as '''[[Arbor Lodge State Historical Park and Arboretum]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arbordayfarm.org/] "Arbor Day Farm", Retrieved 2015-10-21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lied Lodge &amp; Conference Center and Arbor Day Farm==
In Nebraska City, Nebraska, the home of Arbor Day, the Arbor Day Foundation built the Lied Lodge and Conference Center, which houses a full service meeting center and 140 guest rooms"&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[http://www.liedlodge.org/] "Lied Lodge and Conference Center", Retrieved 2015-10-21&lt;/ref&gt; for conservation-minded organizations, members, forestry professionals, or other individuals that value the environmental operating practices offered by the facility.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The property is also home to Arbor Day Farm, a National Historic Landmark and an educational visitor attraction; Arbor Day Farm Tree Adventure, including the Lied Greenhouse, Woodland Pavilion, the Tree House Trail, Canopy Tree House, Nature Explore Classrooms, Exploratory Trail, Nature Explore Club Cabin, and the Tree Adventure Discovery Ride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arbor Day Foundation|date=2014 |title=Lied Lodge and Conference Center, Arbor Day Farm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the Arbor Day Foundation took over management of [[Arbor Lodge State Historical Park and Arboretum]] from the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |last=Marek |first=Anthony |date=2014|title=Arbor Day Foundation and Nebraska Game and Parks Commission Reach Cooperative Agreement to Manage Arbor Lodge State Historical Park |url=http://www.arborday.org/|location=Nebraska City, NE|publisher=Arbor Day Foundation|access-date=2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs of the Arbor Day Foundation==

===Tree City USA===

[[Image:Tree City USA.png|thumb|122px|Tree City USA logo]]
The Tree City USA program, which is co-sponsored by the [[National Association of State Foresters]] and the [[USDA Forest Service]], has grown to include more than 3,400 towns, cities, and military bases in all 50 states.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Arbor Day Foundation|date=2014 |title=2014 Annual Report of the Arbor Day Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This program nationally recognizes cities and towns for urban and community forestry and helps provide assistance and public attention to showcase the importance of urban forestry.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Arbor Day Foundation|date=2014 |title=Arbor Day Special Edition Newsletter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation encourages communities across the nation to become Tree City USA by meeting four standards:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arbor Day Foundation|date=2009 |title=Tree City Bulletin #22 Tree City USA: Foundation for Better Tree Management}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The community must have a tree board or department.
* The community must have established a community ordinance for [[tree care]].
* There must be a community forestry program with an annual budget of at least $2 per capita.
* The community must have an Arbor Day observance and proclamation.

===Trees for America&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite book |last=Arbor Day Foundation|date=2015 |title=Plant Trees for America}}&lt;/ref&gt;===

The million members of the Arbor Day Foundation share the same vision to plant, nurture, and celebrate trees.  The trees planted by the members at their homes, businesses, and ranches provide cleaner air and water, shade, increased stormwater management, energy savings, soil protection, and habitat for wildlife.

Members are invited to receive 10 free trees through the Trees for America program.  Between six and seven million trees are sent to members each year that help improve their communities and environment.

Another aspect of the Trees for America program is the Community Tree Recovery program, which brings hope and healing to communities in need by providing trees to replant after natural disasters.

===Replanting Our National Forests&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;===

Through partnerships with the [[U.S. Forest Service]] and the National Association of State Foresters, Foundation corporate sponsors and members have planted more than 45 million trees in America's National Forests to help restore vitality and life to the forest land after devastation to the forests caused by insects, disease, and wildfires.  Forests provide more than beauty to the nation, they provide drinking water to 180 million people, stop erosion around streams and lakes, and assist rain and snowmelt to soak into the soil.  Trees also help mitigate climate change by absorbing carbon dioxide and replacing it with oxygen.  The replanted forests provide a home to wolves, bald eagles, grizzly bears, and other endangered species.

An example of a forest replanting is the [[Shasta-Trinity National Forest]], the largest national forest in California with two million acres.  The summer of 2008 marked the worst fire season in the history of the forest and burned thousands of acres. Through the Replanting Our National Forest program, the Arbor Day Foundation with their partnership with the U.S. Forest Service, has planted more than one million trees to bring life back to the forest and ensure that it continues to thrive.

===Nature Explore&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;===

Daily interactions with the natural world is a big benefit for children. The Arbor Day Foundation's Nature Explore program allows children to make deeper connections with the natural world.

Through a collaboration with Dimensions Educational Research Foundation, the Arbor Day Foundation is taking on the challenge of teaching the importance of nature to children and exposing them to the outdoors through their Nature Explore Classrooms.  These research-based opportunities for learning are taught to school administrators, landscape architects, and families and give educators an opportunity to build and certify a Nature Explore Outdoor Classroom using safe, durable, natural components.  Outdoor classrooms allow children to learn and play outside while they experience the wonder of nature.  There are art stations with pine cones and acorns, allowing children to create their own masterpieces.  Logs allow a natural climb and crawl experience.  Above-ground gardens allow the children to plant flowers and vegetables and watch them grow.  In this nature-based environment, children are allowed to play together, pretending, creating, and learning to care for the space that was built just for them.  These nature-rich environments help kids connect to nature, inspiring the next generation of tree planters.

===Tree Campus USA&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;===

237 colleges and universities are recognized as Tree Campus USA's. Tree Campus USA recognition is obtained by having a program in place that manages the campus tree inventory along with tree care and maintenance.  Managed trees provide beauty to the campus along with a place for students to study, relax, and socialize. Students that have an opportunity to connect with trees and the environment when they are young will carry this on through their lifetime.

===Rain Forest Rescue&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arbor Day Foundation|date=2015 |title=Shade Grown Arbor Day Specialty Coffee}}&lt;/ref&gt;===

The Arbor Day Foundation's Rain Forest Rescue program saves thousands of acres of tropical rain forest each year with contributions from our generous members and sponsors.  This tropical land is crucial to our survival and is home to many of the rarest animals on earth and plants that hold medicinal value and cures.  Working with eight different countries and 59 different projects, preservation, tree-planting, and recovery is under way with on-location partners.

Shade-grown Arbor Day Specialty Coffee is another part of the Rain Forest Rescue program.  The rain forests are not only home to many animals, they are home to millions of people.  Through the Arbor Day Specialty Coffee program, the Foundation helps these people and farmers save and preserve the rain forest using sustainable agroforestry that includes production of coffee beans. Farmers grow coffee plants in the rain forest under the trees, offering a superior coffee bean and saving the rain forest from unwanted destruction.  The Foundation offers education and economic incentives for rain forest restoration and preservation.

===Conservation Trees&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arbor Day Foundation|title=2014 Conservation Trees}}&lt;/ref&gt;===

Land conservation practices help conserve soil, water, wildlife, and the atmosphere.  Through the Conservation Trees program, the Foundation works with ranchers, farmers, and landowners through communication and education encouraging environmental stewardship.

Trees planted for conservation are “working trees.”  They provide many benefits in communities and rural areas.  Other than reducing soil erosion, cleaning waterways and air, trees cut energy costs and sequester carbon dioxide.  They provide beauty to our land all the while providing food for wildlife and people.

===Energy-Saving Trees&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;===

Strategically planting trees in a homeowner's yard lowers utility bills, conserves energy, and lowers peak electricity demand.  The Foundation's Energy-Saving Trees program works with utility partners to plant trees in residential areas.  An on-line tools allows the homeowner to choose a tree for their yard, plot the tree in their yard using satellite imagery to calculate the energy savings over time.  This unique program allows Foundation partners and members to save energy through tree planting.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5115">The '''Council of Australian Postgraduate Associations''' ('''CAPA''') is the [[National postgraduate representative body|peak representative body for postgraduate students]] in [[Australia]]. CAPA's members are 33 postgraduate associations and the National Aboriginal &amp; Torres Strait Islander Postgraduate Association (NATSIPA). CAPA provides [[Student unionism in Australia|member associations]] with representation to the [[Government of Australia|Federal government]], and peak bodies such as the [[Australian Research Council]] and [[Universities Australia]], on issues affecting postgraduate students in Australia. In 2017, Australia had over 400,000 postgraduate students, representing one quarter of all tertiary students in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://docs.education.gov.au/node/39331|title=2015 First half year student summary tables|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Australian Government Department of Education and Training|access-date=25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recognising the dual roles of many postgraduate students, CAPA works in collaboration with the [[National Union of Students of Australia|National Union of Students]] where matters impact on all students (such as [[voluntary student unionism]] and funding for higher education), and with the [[National Tertiary Education Union]] regarding issues of employment in the tertiary education sector, particularly on the casualisation of the academic workforce.

CAPA has an office located at the NTEU National office in [[Melbourne, Victoria]]. Its Annual Council Meeting (ACM), where organisational issues and policy directives are decided, is hosted by a different constituent organisation each year.

== History ==
CAPA was founded in 1979 by a coalition of ten postgraduate organisations in order to protest taxation on postgraduate research scholarships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.capa.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/CAPA_25_years.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304132236/http://www.capa.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/CAPA_25_years.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=4 March 2016|title=Twenty five years of CAPA – the fight is far from over|last=|first=|date=|website=Council of Australian Postgraduate Associations|publisher=|access-date=25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, CAPA has been concerned with lobbying around fees on postgraduate degrees.

In 1998, a separate organisation, the National Indigenous Postgraduate Association (NIPA) was formed within CAPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://natsipa.edu.au/history/|title=About NATSIPA|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=NATSIPA|access-date=25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This association became the National Indigenous Postgraduate Association Aboriginal Corporation (NIPAAC) in 1999, and was later restructured as the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Postgraduate Association (NATSIPA) in 2015.

== Structure ==
CAPA consists of elected representatives on three committees: the governing Executive Committee, the Equity committee, and the Engagement Committee. The NATSIPA Liaison Officer sits on all committees. Each committee meets on a monthly basis. New committee members are elected at the Annual Council Meeting, which is held in November.

==Introduction==
'''Creative education''' is when students are able to use imagination and critical thinking to create new and meaningful forms of ideas where they can take risks, be independent and flexible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gibson |first1=Robyn |title=The ‘art’ of creative teaching: Implications for higher education |journal=Teaching in Higher Education |date=2010 |volume=15 |issue=5 |pages=607-613 |doi=10.1080/13562517.2010.493349}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of being taught to reiterate what was learned, students learn to develop their ability to find various solutions to a problem. Coming up with various out-of-the box solutions is known as '''[[divergent thinking]]''' and there is no one way of cultivating this skill - largely due to the newness of the concept and the limited scientific information on creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/turning-straw-gold/201302/what-type-thinker-are-you|title=What Type of Thinker Are You?|website=Psychology Today|language=en|access-date=2017-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Importance ===

The increasing interest in creative education is due to the need for more critical thinkers in business science, politics and every subject to be able to solve complex problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gibson |first1=Robyn |title=The ‘art’ of creative teaching: Implications for higher education |journal=Teaching in Higher Education |date=2010 |volume=15 |issue=5 |pages=607-613 |doi=10.1080/13562517.2010.493349}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the world becomes more interconnected, it is no longer possible to make linear decisions in business and in politics. Current leaders are looking for people who can bring about new ideas to solve pressing issues. For instance, in a 2010 IBM study, Chief Executive Officers from more than 60 countries and 33 different industries worldwide were surveyed on creativity. Those 1,500 CEOs believe that in order for the industries to keep growing in this increasingly complex world, creative strategies must be implemented in education so that these graduating students and future employees are better prepared for massive shifts in industries once they go to workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=IBM |title=IBM |url=https://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/31670.wss |website=IBM 2010 Global CEO Study: Creativity Selected as Most Crucial Factor for Future Success |accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This soft skill of creativity has been identified as a competency for a successful enterprise in the future. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schmidt |first1=Jacqueline |title=Creativity in the entrepreneurship classroom |journal=Journal of Entrepreneurship Education |date=2012 |volume=15 |pages=123-131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When students have more say in their education, they become more engaged which helps facilitate learning. Plus, the goal of creative education is to challenge each student and encourage originality. Instead of "standardizing" how students approach a problem, different responses would be encouraged. This, in turn, allows more than one type of learner to exist within a classroom.

A growing number of colleges and universities are realizing the needs for more creative students in every field of education. Therefore, they are opening centers, such as Stanford University’s d.school, Harvard University's i-lab, Oklahoma State University’s Institute for Creativity and Innovation and Ball State University's Center for Creative Inquiry, to increase divergent thinking. Those centers are teaching students creative problem solving and design thinking. Creativity is a set of teachable skills and many universities are requiring students to take creativity classes as part of their undergraduate study. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stanford |title=d school |url=https://dschool.stanford.edu/ |accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Harvard |title=Innovation Labs |url=https://innovationlabs.harvard.edu/ |accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Oklahoma State University |title=CIE: The Creativity, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship Learning Community |url=https://business.okstate.edu/entrepreneurship/cw/cie.html |accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ball State University |title=Centers and Institutes |url=https://www.bsu.edu/academics/centersandinstitutes |accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Benefits of Creative Teaching ===

Research has found the following benefits for students using creativity in education:
* Makes learning more fun for students where they can learn faster and can increase their performance &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rinkevich |first1=Jennifer |title=Creative Teaching: Why it Matters and Where to Begin |journal=The Clearing House |date=2011 |volume=84 |doi=10.1080/00098655.2011.575416}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Students’ dislike for science, mathematics, and social studies subjects can be diminished &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rinkevich |first1=Jennifer |title=Creative Teaching: Why it Matters and Where to Begin |journal=The Clearing House |date=2011 |volume=84 |doi=10.1080/00098655.2011.575416}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Improvement in student achievement &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rinkevich |first1=Jennifer |title=Creative Teaching: Why it Matters and Where to Begin |journal=The Clearing House |date=2011 |volume=84 |doi=10.1080/00098655.2011.575416}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Barriers to Creative Teaching ===

* Some teachers may not have the mindset of teaching their students how to be creative &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rinkevich |first1=Jennifer |title=Creative Teaching: Why it Matters and Where to Begin |journal=The Clearing House |date=2011 |volume=84 |doi=10.1080/00098655.2011.575416}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some teachers might view creative work as “extra” and not needed &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rinkevich |first1=Jennifer |title=Creative Teaching: Why it Matters and Where to Begin |journal=The Clearing House |date=2011 |volume=84 |doi=10.1080/00098655.2011.575416}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* There is a “creativity gap” in classrooms where creativity is discouraged &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rinkevich |first1=Jennifer |title=Creative Teaching: Why it Matters and Where to Begin |journal=The Clearing House |date=2011 |volume=84 |doi=10.1080/00098655.2011.575416}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some  studies have found that teachers cannot be creative in classrooms due to pressures by the system, standards, and big classroom size &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rinkevich |first1=Jennifer |title=Creative Teaching: Why it Matters and Where to Begin |journal=The Clearing House |date=2011 |volume=84 |doi=10.1080/00098655.2011.575416}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ways to Increase Creativity in Classroom ===

These are few ways in which creativity in classroom can be increased: 
* Don’t limit assignments to one format. For example, instead of limiting the student to the writing assignment, they can create a podcast, video, role playing, poem, composing songs, etc. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chan |first1=Zenobia |title=Exploring creativity and critical thinking in traditional and innovative problem‐based learning groups |journal=Journal of Clinical Nursing |date=2013 |volume=22 |doi=10.1111/jocn.12186 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Set time aside for creativity. For instance, set aside one hour in a school day to let students explore their ideas &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chan |first1=Zenobia |title=Exploring creativity and critical thinking in traditional and innovative problem‐based learning groups |journal=Journal of Clinical Nursing |date=2013 |volume=22 |doi=10.1111/jocn.12186 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Use technology to broaden your idea of assignments. For example, you can use Google Maps to teach geography and make the class more interactive. 
* Introduce unconventional learning materials into class. Besides using the books in the classrooms, you can use educational podcasts and videos, such as Radiolab and Ted Talks, which can create entertainment with education &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hicks |first1=Kristen |title=Why Creativity in the Classroom Matters More Than Ever |url=http://www.edudemic.com/creativity-in-the-classroom/ |website=Edudemic |accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reward creative ideas, thoughts and products &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gibson |first1=Robyn |title=The ‘art’ of creative teaching: Implications for higher education |journal=Teaching in Higher Education |date=2010 |volume=15 |issue=5 |pages=607-613 |doi=10.1080/13562517.2010.493349}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Encourage risk-taking, allowing mistakes, and imagining from various perspectives &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gibson |first1=Robyn |title=The ‘art’ of creative teaching: Implications for higher education |journal=Teaching in Higher Education |date=2010 |volume=15 |issue=5 |pages=607-613 |doi=10.1080/13562517.2010.493349}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* And finally, teach teachers to be more creative in classrooms and hold creativity workshops for them &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rinkevich |first1=Jennifer |title=Creative Teaching: Why it Matters and Where to Begin |journal=The Clearing House |date=2011 |volume=84 |doi=10.1080/00098655.2011.575416}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research ===

Early research viewed creativity as an intellectual ability possessed by few people. Creativity has been linked to intelligence. However, today creativity is viewed as a set of teachable skills not linked to intelligence. Some of the research that was done in early 2000, indicated that as people grow older, their creativity dampens. According to the Robinson Report, by the age of 5, a child’s potential for creativity is 98%; by the age of 10, this percentage drops to 30%; at age of 15 it is 12%; and by the time we adults, our creativity is no more than 2%. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gibson |first1=Robyn |title=The ‘art’ of creative teaching: Implications for higher education |journal=Teaching in Higher Education |date=2010 |volume=15 |issue=5 |pages=607-613 |doi=10.1080/13562517.2010.493349}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After two decades, employers and universities realized the need to foster creativity in students and eventually in the workforce. 

In [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi|Csikszentmihalyi']]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s five-step process to elicit creative thinking, incubation is a necessary step.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Flow and the psychology of discovery and invention|last=Csikszentmihalyi|first=Mihaly|publisher=Harper Collins|year=1996|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meaning, the use of unconscious thought is needed to solve complex problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhong|first=Chen-Bo|last2=Dijksterhuis|first2=Ap|last3=Galinsky|first3=Adam D.|date=2008-09-01|title=The Merits of Unconscious Thought in Creativity|url=http://pss.sagepub.com/lookup/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02176.x|journal=Psychological Science|language=en|volume=19|issue=9|pages=912–918|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02176.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; A problem such as 2+2 is a linear thought process that can performed in the consciousness. Trying to solve the [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|equation for gravity]] requires more complex connections in the brain which has been seen to require the unconscious thought process. In application to education, this may include requiring more recess time to facilitate the creative thought process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn|title=Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects - University of California, San Diego {{!}} Coursera|website=Coursera|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is limited research on how exactly the creative thought process works and how it can be elicited.

In relevance to education, there is research that emphasizes that students ''and'' teachers need more freedom to allow a more creative education process to take place. Students who can participate in their education show more creativity but for this type of education to work, teachers must also have more control over the curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Radovic-Markovic|first=Mirjana|year=2012|title=Creative education and new learning as means of encouraging creativity, original thinking and entrepreneurship.|url=|journal=The Book of Proceedings Humanities and the Contemporary World, Montenegrin Academy of Sciences and Arts, Podgorica, Montenegro.|volume=|pages=|via=semanticscholar.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may look like the teacher determining the curriculum for the ''entire'' year or determining how much time each students needs to spend on each subject. Instead of the decision making starting from the top-down (state to schools), the decision making starts from the ground-up (teacher to schools). This isn't suggesting there shouldn't be ''some'' national guideline but the idea is to place more trust in the teachers as they are on-the-grounds, engaging with each student.

=== Different methods ===
==== Creative Problem Solving (CPS) ====

The CPS method is a more explicit form of cultivating creativity and uses divergent and convergent thinking skills.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://education.jhu.edu/PD/newhorizons/Journals/spring2010/therelevanceofcreativityineducation/|title=School of Education at Johns Hopkins University-The Relevance of Creativity in Education|last=jcarinci|website=education.jhu.edu|access-date=2017-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students are asked to brainstorm, plan ahead, and find solutions. Instead of changing an entire curriculum to be creative focused, this method is a more obvious way to teach students how to critically approach assignments.

====  The Torrance Incubation Model (TIM) ====

The Torrance Incubation Model (TIM), developed by Paul E. Torrance is made up of three stages: 1) Heighten Anticipation 2) Deepen Expectations 3) Extend the Learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Worwood|first=Matthew|date=2011|title=Torrance Incubation Model of Creative Teaching and Learning (TIM)|url=http://www.teachdigital.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/TIM_PROJECT_Model_DM3_01.pdf|journal=Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences Media and Arts Sequence|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model was created to allow instructors to integrate creativity into their lessons without affecting the subject material.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Instead of having to put aside time to teach creativity, teachers can use the TIM model to address the subject and creativity at the same time. The teaching model also aspiries to help teachers teach better and to increase interest in students.

=== Relating Concepts ===
Creative education is sometimes called '''design education''' but that may be confused with education pertaining to the design industry (i.e. architecture, graphic design, interior design, etc.).

'''[[Design thinking]]''' also explains the process of creatively solving problems in all faucets of life. Though this is very similar, creative education focuses on how classes are taught to oppress or encourage creativity.

== Increased prevalence across nations ==
=== Singapore ===
In [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]]'s [[Programme for International Student Assessment|PISA]] global education survey, Singapore was named for having the best education system in 2015.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/education/singapore-tops-latest-oecd-pisa-global-education-survey.htm|title=Singapore tops latest OECD PISA global education survey - OECD|last=|first=|date=|website=www.oecd.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singapore not only uses technology heavily in their classrooms, but there is emphasis on the idea that the teacher is a facilitator of finding information not the source of information. The argument is that kids are exposed to engaging screens outside of school so expecting them to not use their phones in school makes school boring. By using technology in the classroom, the can use the interest in technology as leverage to maintain student engagement. The technology skills are also more relevant to today's time. Additionally, teachers are encouraged to continually learn and change their teaching strategy by speaking with other instructors and allowing others to weigh-in on their classes - so the teaching method is constantly improving.

=== Finland ===
Finland has also been ranked as hosting one of the top education systems in the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Not only does the country strive to have accessible education, but teachers usually stay with the same students over several years.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ccefinland.org/finland-education-model-c1yvm|title=Council for Creative Education (CCE) Finland|website=Council for Creative Education (CCE) Finland|access-date=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The curriculum in Finland starts from the bottom-up so teachers have more control to change the design of the curriculum. This is partly due to the shift in how tests are viewed. Tests are still used as a means of assessing progress but there is no national testing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== UK ===
From the 1960s through the 80's the UK's primary schools were recognized as innovative&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wyse|first=Dominic|last2=Ferrari|first2=Anusca|date=2015-02-01|title=Creativity and education: comparing the national curricula of the states of the European Union and the United Kingdom|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/berj.3135/abstract|journal=British Educational Research Journal|language=en|volume=41|issue=1|pages=30–47|doi=10.1002/berj.3135|issn=1469-3518}}&lt;/ref&gt; and surrounding around the child as recorded in the [[Plowden Report]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.educationengland.org.uk/documents/plowden/plowden1967-1.html|title=Plowden Report 1967 Volume 1 - full text|last=Gillard|first=Derek|website=www.educationengland.org.uk|access-date=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; A noteworthy school in the UK is [[Summerhill School|A.S.'s Summerhill School]] which is a democratic school where parents, teachers, and students have a say in the education and where the education is designed around the students opposed to kids adapting to a standard school system.

Compared to the European Union, the UK, especially Northern Ireland, have a more frequent usage of creativity across multiple school subjects.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== USA ===
The education system in the United States has been seen as an inhibitor of creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-smirniotopoulos/post_3156_b_1375546.html|title=We Need an Education System that Promotes Creativity, Innovation, and Critical Thinking|last=Smirniotopoulos|first=Peter|date=2012-03-23|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extensive state-wide tests that are required have push educators to follow strict curriculum so there is less freedom among teachers. The tests also create a cyclical pattern in under-performing, poor schools - low performance leads to less funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/19/nyregion/fearing-class-system-classroom-strict-curriculum-but-only-for-failing-schools.html|title=Fearing a Class System in the Classroom; A Strict Curriculum, but Only for Failing Schools, Mostly in Poor Areas of New York|last=Goodnough|first=Abby|date=2003-01-19|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-03-21|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, money buys the quality of education in the United States.

=== Australia ===
The [[MCEETYA|Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs]] (MCEETYA) in Australia has also begun to integrate more creativity within its education model in the Melbourne Declaration on Educational Goals for Young Australians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=2008|title=Melbourne Declaration on Educational Goals for Young Australians|url=http://www.curriculum.edu.au/verve/_resources/National_Declaration_on_the_Educational_Goals_for_Young_Australians.pdf|journal=Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs (MCEETYA)|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advocates of creative education ==

=== Ken Robinson ===
[[Ken Robinson (educationalist)|Ken Robinson]] is an academic specializing in the need for creativity in education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sirkenrobinson.com/about/|title=About me - Sir Ken Robinson|work=Sir Ken Robinson|access-date=2017-03-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He works with governments and education programs to work on creating more innovative education systems. He has a Tedtalk, "Do schools kill creativity?" that gained world recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Robinson|first=Ken|title=Do schools kill creativity?|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity|language=en|accessdate=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Department of Higher Education and Training''' is one of the [[ministry (government department)|departments]] of the [[Government of South Africa|South African government]]. It oversees [[universities]] and other [[post-secondary education]] in [[South Africa]]. It was created in 2009 after the election of [[President of South Africa|President]] [[Jacob Zuma]], when the former [[Department of Education (South Africa)|Department of Education]] was divided.

The political head of the department is the [[Minister of Higher Education and Training (South Africa)|Minister of Higher Education and Training]]; {{asof|2018|2|lc=on}} this is [[Naledi Pandor]]. The department is headquartered in Pretoria in what used to be known as Sol Plaatje House, named after the author and political activist [[Sol Plaatje]]. The name Sol Plaatje House is now used for the new [[Department of Basic Education]] building.

{{anchor|Journals}}The Department issues a [[Journal ranking by country|journal rank]] called "List of Approved South African Journals",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.researchoffice.uct.ac.za/usr/researchoffice/publication/DHET_Policy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; used as a criterion for South African scholars and scientists to receive recognition for their academic publishing productivity and for journal editors and publishers to receive monetary compensation from the government.&lt;ref name="up.ac.za"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.up.ac.za/journals/journalsaccredited.htm|title=Department of Library Services|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://rm.nmmu.ac.za/DHET-Accredited-Journal-Lists-for-publications-i&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="up.ac.za"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.researchoffice.uct.ac.za/usr/researchoffice/publication/PC%20Guide.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Digital Medievalist''' is an [[academic]] project and community-building organization for those who are interested in the use of computers and computational techniques in the academic field of [[medieval studies]], a sub-field of [[digital humanities]].&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Digital Medievalist was established in 2003 as an international collaborative non-profit project based at [[University of Lethbridge]] in [[Canada]], though it has executive board members from a number of other countries.  Although [[University of Lethbridge]] remains the main host and administrative home, the project now has a technical infrastructure which uses donated services from others including the [[University of Kentucky]]. The project grew out of a recognised need for best-practice advice on a disciplinary level in the creation of digital medieval resources.  Although much of the advice and experience of those who would call themselves digital medievalists are applicable to other areas of the [[digital humanities]] and specifically academic research projects in this area, around the time of its creation an increasing need for discipline-based communities of this nature was beginning to be recognised.&lt;ref&gt;See Brogan, M. &amp; Renfrow D. (2005), ''A Kaleidoscope of Digital American Literature'', Digital Library Federation, p. 17: 
[https://books.google.com/books?id=m8QYpR1D58UC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;ots=kDICmd72r3&amp;sig=w09GF9bj5hcIBZBmniY1Hfgh9YY&amp;hl=en#PPA17,M1]
&lt;/ref&gt;  Partly in response to the overwhelming reception the creation of Digital Medievalist received, the [[Digital Classicist]] project was set up shortly after.

== Governance ==

=== Executive Board ===
Digital Medievalist as an organization is overseen by the volunteer efforts of a fully elected international executive board.  Its bylaws state that its 8-member board are elected by the membership for overlapping two-year terms (thus 4 positions come up for election each year), and that the board chooses a director from amongst its members.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/bylaws.html for the full bylaws&lt;/ref&gt;  Eligibility for election to the executive board is simply demonstrable participation in digital medieval activities or board-sanctioned equivalancies.  These bylaws also state its commitment to be a non-profit organization, and its general purposes and objectives.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/bylaws.html#board&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Membership ===
Membership in Digital Medievalist is free and open to all.  The sole criterion for membership is subscription to its free online discussion list 'dm-l'.  Membership conveys the right to vote in Digital Medievalist elections, and if they have contributed in some meaningful manner, eligibility to run for election to the Digital Medievalist executive board.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/bylaws.html#membership&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==
[[Image:Origo Mundi kynsa gwersow.jpg|thumb|right|Opening verses of Mediaeval Cornish manuscript, of the ''Origo Mundi'']] 
Digital Medievalist sees it as its mission to provide a framework to enable members of its community to share information.  These activities include an electronic mailing list, the participation in and organisation of conference sessions or other events, and a website containing an open-access academic journal of record, a wiki/FAQ, and a facility to post news releases.&lt;ref&gt;See printed work: O'Donnell, Daniel P., 'Disciplinary Impact and Technological Obsolescence in Medieval Studies' in ''A Companion to Digital Literary Studies'', ed. by Ray Siemens and Susan Schreibman, (Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, 2007), p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mailing list ===
Digital Medievalist runs an electronic mailing list and discussion forum ([http://listserv.uleth.ca/mailman/listinfo/dm-l dm-l]) where members of the community ask for advice, share problems, and discuss issues that affect them.  The discussion list currently has around 540 members, many of whom are drawn from widely across the [[Humanities Computing]] field.&lt;ref&gt;See https://digitalmedievalist.wordpress.com/mailing-list/&lt;/ref&gt;  The list traffic is low, with occasional bursts of interest in a particular issue, but is primarily used for announcements of interest to digital medievalists.

=== Journal ===
Digital Medievalist runs a free [[peer-reviewed]] [[Open access (publishing)|open-access]] online journal, also called 'Digital Medievalist', which acts as a journal of record for the digital medieval studies field. In many ways this is seen as the most significant output of Digital Medievalist and is where the majority of volunteer effort is directed.  The journal has an entry in the [[Directory of Open Access Journals]] listed under the fields of both [[computer science]] and [[history]].&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=findJournals&amp;hybrid=&amp;query=Digital+Medievalist&lt;/ref&gt;  The Digital Medievalist ISSN number is 17150736, and University of Lethbridge is listed as the official publisher. In May 2017, the journal moved from its previous domain at http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/journal/ to the [[Open Library of Humanities]] platform, at http://journal.digitalmedievalist.org.&lt;ref&gt;http://journal.digitalmedievalist.org, accessed 26 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The journal appears to release about one issue every year since 2005.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/journal/&lt;/ref&gt;  It has experimented with different formats of releases, for example issue 3 is a rolling-release that previously submitted articles are being added to over time, while issue 4 was a thematic issue of articles arising out of the work of a cognate organization [[Digital Classicist]] in memory of a well-known academic in the field of [[digital humanities]], [[Ross Scaife]].  In addition to experimenting with different models of publication, the project has taken an innovative stance on the problems of academic acceptance of research articles published online.  This the use of so-called 'Ostentatious Peer Review', that is, the accepting editor and the recommending reader who reviewed the article have their name listed as doing so.  The theory is that both the editors and reviewers do a better job (since their name is in evidence for everyone to see) and also by attracting big names in the [[medieval studies]] and/or [[digital humanities|humanities computing]] community, the online publication of the article may be taken more seriously by academic hiring and tenure committees.  While there is informal hearsay evidence that this might be beneficial, and certainly leads to a higher editorial standard than some online journals, there is no hard evidence (yet) that this affects hiring committees.&lt;ref&gt;See http://people.uleth.ca/~daniel.odonnell/tag/peer+review/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conferences and events ===
Digital Medievalist as an umbrella group for a community interested in digital methodologies in medieval studies has organized conference sessions many years at the most prestigious academic [[Medieval studies]] conferences in existence.  For example, the International Congress on Medieval Studies&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.wmich.edu/medieval/congress/&lt;/ref&gt; organized by [[Western Michigan University]] and the International Medieval Congress&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.leeds.ac.uk/ims/imc/&lt;/ref&gt; organized by the [[University of Leeds]] amongst other conferences and events.

'''Douglas Kent Hall''' (December 12, 1938 – March 30, 2008) was an American writer and photographer. Hall was a fine art photographer and writer of fiction, poetry, nonfiction, essays, and screenplays. He was in high school when he first published a story, his first published photographs were of [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[Jim Morrison]], and his first exhibition of photographs was at the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]].

He published twenty-five books, including two with [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]. His photographs are of [[rock and roll]] superstars, [[rodeo]], cowboys, prison, [[flamenco]], bodybuilders, the [[U.S.-Mexico border]], the American West, New Mexico, New York City, Japan, Brazil, Mexico, Great Britain, Greece, Russia, Native Americans, writers, and artists. Hall's artistic output included collaborations with [[Larry Bell (artist)|Larry Bell]], [[Bruce Nauman]], [[Terry Allen (country singer)|Terry Allen]], and his son Devon Hall.

At the time of his sudden death in 2008, solo exhibitions of his photographs hung concurrently at the [[Harwood Museum of Art]], Taos, New Mexico; the Riva Yares Gallery, [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]]; and the [[Roswell Museum and Art Center]], Roswell, New Mexico. His book ''In New Mexico Light'' had just been selected for the [[Eric Hoffer Award]].

== Biography ==

===Early years===
Hall was born in [[Vernal, Utah]], to Phyllis Hiatt and Charles William "Peck" Hall; he was the elder of two children. His brother, Wayne Hall, was born eighteen months after Douglas. Although Vernal is a Mormon community, the young Hall family did not practice the faith. While Peck Hall was serving in the Navy during World War II, his marriage to Phyllis broke up and the two small boys started living with their maternal grandmother, Beulah Perry. Hall's elementary and high school years were spent with his grandparents on rural farms in the Vernal area. He raised sheep and cows that he exhibited and sold at County Fairs. During high school Hall was a rodeo contestant.&lt;ref name="Visionary"&gt;Douglas Kent Hall, ''Visionary: An Autobiography with Commentary'' (Santa Fe: Pennywhistle Press, 2002), 27–134.&lt;/ref&gt;

===College years===
At the age of seventeen, Hall entered [[Utah State University#Logan Campus|Utah State University, Logan]], to study creative writing. He was already a published author. He transferred to the [[University of Utah]] in Salt Lake City and then to [[Brigham Young University]] where he earned his bachelor's degree in English in 1960. At BYU Hall started what would become lifelong friendships with [[Alfred L. Bush]] and David Stires. The three enthusiastic writers lived and breathed literature and other creative arts. Bush became the Curator of Western Americana at the Firestone Library, Princeton University, and Stires became a publishing executive. Highlights of Hall's undergraduate years included study of the creative process with [[Brewster Ghiselin]], editor of the landmark book ''The Creative Process''.&lt;ref&gt;Brewster Ghiselin, ''The Creative Process'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1985), {{ISBN|978-0-520-05453-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Between his junior and senior years at BYU, Hall met and married Claire Nicholson, of Boise, Idaho. The two remained married for ten years.&lt;ref name="Visionary"/&gt;
After earning his undergraduate degree at BYU, Hall was accepted into the prestigious [[Iowa Writers' Workshop|Writer's Workshop]] at the [[University of Iowa]], Iowa City. For three years he worked as special assistant to [[Paul Engle]], director of the program.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Sklenicka, ''Raymond Carver: A Writer's Life'' (New York: Scribner, 2009), 95.&lt;/ref&gt; While at the Writer's Workshop Hall befriended, among others, [[Mark Strand]], [[Galway Kinnell]], [[W. S. Merwin]], [[Robert Bly]], and [[Adrian Mitchell]].&lt;ref name="Thomas R. Smith 1993"&gt;Thomas R. Smith, ed., ''Walking Swiftly: Writings in Honor of Robert Bly'' (New York: Harper Perennial, 1993), 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Hall wrote and published extensively while at Iowa.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Kent Hall, "I, Georg Gurko, and Other Stories of Friendship and Love," Master of Fine Arts Thesis, University of Iowa, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===
Hall's master of fine arts degree in Creative Writing from the University of Iowa's Writer's Workshop in 1963 led to a position at the [[University of Portland]] teaching Creative Writing and Literature. Hall and Claire moved to Portland, Oregon, in 1964. During his time at the University of Portland, Hall brought many well-known poets to the school for readings, such as [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[W. H. Auden]], [[Anaïs Nin]], [[Gary Snyder]], [[Robert Duncan (poet)|Robert Duncan]], [[William Stafford (poet)|William Stafford]], and [[Robert Bly]].&lt;ref name="Thomas R. Smith 1993"/&gt; Hall also became active in an organization called [[American Writers Against the Vietnam War]]. At this time a friend lent Hall a camera and he taught himself photography, seriously studying photographic technique and style. He photographed poets and the group of artists he befriended in Portland, including [[Lee Kelly]], Duane Zaloudek, [[Carl Morris (painter)|Carl Morris]], [[Hilda Morris]], Doug Lynch, among others.&lt;ref name="Visionary"/&gt;

Hall's method of teaching creative writing included taking his students on car trips, overseeing student film productions, and having students grade themselves. His increasing interest in photography led to freelance photographic work. He photographed [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[Jim Morrison]] of [[the Doors]] for Sunn Music, makers of amplifiers. He received various other commercial and magazine photographic assignments. Hall realized he could dedicate himself to his writing and photography and left the world of academia.&lt;ref name="Visionary"/&gt;

In 1967 Hall traveled throughout England, France, Italy, Spain, Morocco, and Portugal with his cameras. He shot his first images in the Dark Landscapes series. In 1968 Hall moved from Portland to London and continued work in advertising and on his series of artist and writer portraits and his art photography. He began formulating the idea of Passing, which dominated most of the philosophy behind his personal work.&lt;ref name="Douglas Kent Hall 1989"&gt;Douglas Kent Hall, ''Passing Through'' (Flagstaff, AZ: Northland, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career as an independent writer and photographer===
Hall and his wife moved from London to New York City in 1968. He continued to photograph rock and roll stars, which resulted in the publication of ''Rock: A World Bold as Love'', released later in paperback as ''The Superstars: In Their Own Words''.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Kent Hall, ''Rock: A World Bold as Love'' (New York: Cowles, 1970); Douglas Kent Hall, ''The Superstars: In Their Own Words'' (New York: Music Sales, 1970).&lt;/ref&gt; In New York, Hall continued writing. He published his first novel, ''On the Way to the Sky'', in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Kent Hall, ''On the Way to the Sky'' (New York: McCall Books, 1972).&lt;/ref&gt; This book fictionalized Hall's childhood years in Vernal, Utah, and his renegade Hall relatives. Hall's time spent in the world of rock and roll led to his novel ''Rock and Roll Retreat Blues'', published in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Kent Hall, ''Rock and Roll Retreat Blues'' (New York: Avon, 1974).&lt;/ref&gt;

While driving across the country with his college friend Alfred Bush in 1969 to photograph American Indians, returning to the West of his youth, Hall shot his first Passing series. In 1971 he developed the first negatives for Passing II. The idea of time and the photograph continued to deepen and became the guiding influence behind his total photographic output.&lt;ref name="Douglas Kent Hall 1989"/&gt;

Hall's marriage to Claire dissolved in 1970. He returned briefly to Portland, Oregon, and worked doing commercial photography jobs and writing. He met his future second wife, Dawn Claire Davidson, a fashion coordinator, in May 1971. The following December the two moved to New York and set up residence and studio in a loft on 21st Street and 7th Avenue. As they were moving in, comedian and filmmaker [[Christopher Guest]] was moving out. Of note, when Hall and Dawn moved out of the loft in 1976, the poet [[Mark Strand]], Hall's friend, moved in.&lt;ref name="Visionary"/&gt;

In the 1970s Hall lived in New York but spent much time traveling. His work included writing a book about rodeo titled ''Let Er Buck''; writing and codirecting a feature documentary film about rodeo titled ''The Great American Cowboy'', which won an Academy Award for Best Feature-Length Documentary; and publishing a photography book titled ''Rodeo'', which was followed in the early 1980s by another book about cowboys, this one about ranch cowboys, titled ''Working Cowboys''. [[Mark Strand]] writes, "These cowboys, as opposed to urban cowboys, drugstore cowboys, rodeo cowboy, or movie cowboys, stay on horseback all day long working cattle. And when they stand in front of the camera—in Hall's best photos, they are standing, looking straight into the camera lens—their detached way of life shows."&lt;ref&gt;Mark Strand, "Sure Enough Cowboys," in Douglas Kent Hall, ''Visionary'' (Santa Fe: Pennywhistle Press, 2002), 150.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1970s also saw the publication of Hall's second novel, ''Rock and Roll Retreat Blues''. Significantly, in 1974, Hall exhibited his photographs for the first time, at the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] in New York. The exhibition and accompanying catalog, ''Photography in America'', is where the public first viewed the now iconic photograph ''Mesquite, Texas''.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Doty, ed., ''Photography in America'' (New York: The Whitney Museum of American Art, 1974), 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the latter half of the 1970s and the early 1980s, Hall worked on books collaboratively for the first time in his career. In 1975 Hall's literary agent, Bob Dattila, asked him if he would be interested in working on a project with the bodybuilder Arnold Schwarzenegger. Hall and Schwarzenegger published two books, ''Arnold: The Education of a Bodybuilder'' and ''Arnold's Bodyshaping for Women''. ''Arnold: The Education of a Bodybuilder'' was on the [[New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller list]] for eleven weeks in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The New York Times Best Seller List, April 23, 1978|url=http://www.hawes.com/1978/1978-04-23.pdf|publisher=Hawes Publications |accessdate=18 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, ''Sports Illustrated'' included the Hall/Schwarzenegger collaboration as number 71 on their "Top 100 Sports Books of All Time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Top 100 Sports Books of All Time | publisher=''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' |date=December 16, 2002 |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/si_online/features/2002/top_sports_books/1/}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the writing and photographing of ''Bodyshaping for Women'', Hall became acquainted with the female bodybuilder [[Lisa Lyon]]; the friendship led to the publication of their ''Lisa Lyon's BodyMagic''.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Kent Hall and Lisa Lyon, ''BodyMagic'' (New York: Bantam, 1981)&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Incredible Lou Ferrigno'', with bodybuilder Lou Ferrigno, rounded out Hall's collaborative publishing ventures with bodybuilders.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Kent Hall and Lou Ferrigno, ''The Incredible Lou Ferrigno'' (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977 Hall and his partner Dawn moved from New York to the small village of [[Alcalde, New Mexico]]. After living together for more than six years, they were married in Santa Fe on July 23, 1977. In 1980 their son Devon Douglas was born.
 
Hall traveled throughout the Southwest and along the Mexico-U.S. border in the 1980s gathering material for two photographic books. ''The Border: Life on the Line'' introduced Hall to the varied types of people who live and work on both sides of the border. The book includes many color photographs. "In an ideal marriage of uncompromising photography and compelling prose, Hall transports us to 2,000 miles of borderland, revealing it in all its contradictory dimensions."&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Kent Hall, ''The Border: Life on the Line'' (New York: Abbeville Press, 1988), flap copy.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Frontier Spirit: Early Churches of the Southwest'' also includes many color images. "Photographer-author Douglas Kent Hall takes us to the most celebrated churches as well as to the most obscure, including hauntingly evocative ruins in remote parts of New Mexico."&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Kent Hall, ''Frontier Spirit: Early Churches of the Southwest'' (New York: Abbeville Press, 1990), flap copy.&lt;/ref&gt; Known primarily for his black-and-white work, Hall's two books of color photographs highlight the diversity of his oeuvre.

Most well known for his silver prints, in 1992 Hall began printing with platinum. His classic western images of cowboys and [[Matachines]] make up the suite of prints. Also in the early 1990s, Hall traveled to [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia, to document the [[Hermitage Museum]]'s art school for children. He photographed in the students' homes and at the museum.&lt;ref name="Visionary"/&gt; During this period Hall also traveled to [[Minas Gerais]], Brazil, to document the region's gold and gemstone miners.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Kent Hall, ''Os Brasileiros'' (Santa Fe: Sena Galleries West, 1989) and (Las Vegas: Nevada State Museum, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1990s Hall began producing one-of-a-kind photographic artworks. His Zen Ghost Horses series are images of Peruvian Paso and Clydesdale horses exposed onto handmade paper that was brushed with emulsion. Hall embellished the works with gold leaf, Chinese and Japanese calligraphy, and acrylics.&lt;ref name="Visionary"/&gt; Taking color images shot along the Mexico-U.S. border, Hall created a suite of artes de caja (art boxes). These pieces incorporate color photograph, poems, milagros, objects picked up while traveling the border, and pages from Mexican graphic novelettes into and on hand-painted wooden wine boxes. The Albuquerque Museum showed fifteen of the border boxes for four months as part of a tribute exhibition for Hall in the summer of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;At www.cabq.gov/museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Halls sold their Alcalde home and studio in 2001 and moved to Albuquerque, where they built a studio and wet and dry darkrooms onto an existing round house. Hall's New Mexico cohort included artists [[Larry Bell (artist)|Larry Bell]], [[Terry Allen (artist)|Terry Allen]], [[Bruce Nauman]], [[Susan Rothenberg]], Tom Palmore, [[Kenneth Price|Ken Price]], Bill Barrett, Paul Pletka, Charles Strong, Ron Cooper, Gus Foster, and others.

Writer and photographer Hall was not only a novelist, photographer, writer of nonfiction, and film script author, he was also a poet. In 2002 his first collection of poems was published in ''Visionary''. The book also contains an extended automemoir/poem.&lt;ref name="Visionary"/&gt;

===Martial arts===
Hall began studying and practicing Kaju Kenpo karate in Santa Fe in 1986, receiving his Nidan black belt in 1998. He taught karate in Española, New Mexico until 2002. While continuing to practice karate, Hall also incorporated Tai Chi into his daily spiritual practice. When photographer [[Joyce Tenneson]] selected Hall in 2004 for inclusion in her book ''Amazing Men'', she photographed him working with martial arts weapons.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce Tenneson, ''Amazing Men'' (New York: Bulfinch, 2004), 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
Hall died suddenly, unexpectedly, at his home in Albuquerque on March 30, 2008; the cause of death was described as "a cardiac incident." He was survived by his wife, Dawn, and son, Devon Hall, a composer and pianist.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/santafenewmexican/obituary.aspx?n=douglas-kent-hall&amp;pid=107326861&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.santafenewmexican.com/Local%20News/douglas-kent-hall---1938-2008-A-career-full-of-diversity--insig|archive-url= https://archive.is/20120913075910/http://www.santafenewmexican.com/Local%20News/douglas-kent-hall---1938-2008-A-career-full-of-diversity--insig|dead-url= yes|archive-date= September 13, 2012|title= Douglas Kent Hall, 1938–2008: A career full of diversity, insight|last1= Craig|first1= Smith,|date= March 31, 2008|work= The Santa Fe New Mexican|accessdate= May 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2011 review of an exhibition of Hall's platinum photographic prints, art critic Wesley Pulkka wrote, "He died suddenly . . . like a perfectly tuned race car with a hidden flaw whose engine implodes two-thirds down the straightaway while well in the lead."&lt;ref&gt;Wesley Pulkka, "A Life Lived with Eyes Wide Open," ''Albuquerque Journal'', November 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writing ==
Hall's first writing was fiction. His first novel, ''On the Way to the Sky'', is set in [[Utah]] and explores themes that surface frequently in his work: small-town life, surviving a broken home, [[Mormonism]], hunting and fishing, music, and [[rodeo]]. Writer Mag Dimond asked Hall in 1997 which of his books were his favorite and why. "His first choice was ''On the Way to the Sky'', the book he wrote when he was about twenty-one, a steely, sweet autobiographical novel he didn't publish until almost six years later. About this book he simply says, 'I was able to define my past, get it behind me where it belongs.' . . . This stunning little novel is rich in characters suggested by real people . . . written in startlingly original language."&lt;ref&gt;Mag Dimond, ''Douglas Kent Hall—A Borderless Vision'' (Belmont, CA: Wiegand Gallery of the College of Notre Dame, 1997), 10.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[New York Times Book Review]]'' noted, "Mr. Hall invents distinctive family backgrounds for his three heroes and arranges them into an impressionistic chronicle."&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times Book Review'', May 7, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Rock and Roll Retreat Blues'', his second novel, the humor is sardonic; it is a commentary on the world of [[rock and roll]] and the culture it creates and drives. According to a ''Publisher's Weekly'' review, "The book is chock-full of familiar contemporary figures—[[Hell's Angels]], revolutionaries, people spaced out on religion or brown rice or drugs, even such exotics as the "plaster casters." Yet Hall is fresh and funny, and he makes Artie's [the protagonist's] search for his own psyche very real and very much a part of our times. (Excerpts ran in ''Penthouse'')."&lt;ref&gt;''Publisher's Weekly'', October 7, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; The third novel, ''The Master of Oakwindsor'', set in 1908 England, explores the clash between rural England and a new and darker industrial Britain and between two families. ''Bestseller'' magazine writes, "After three successful novels and an Academy Award–winning screenplay, it is no surprise that Hall's novel brings a fresh outlook to the overworked genre of historical romance. ''The Master of Oakwindsor'' is a diverse and brilliantly colored portrait of England and Europe at the turn of the century, bristling with event and detail."&lt;ref&gt;''Bestsellers'', September 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

Hall's numerous books of nonfiction, which include his photographs, treat various subjects, including rock and roll, rodeo, [[cowboy]] life, [[bodybuilding]], [[prison]], the historic churches of the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]], and the border between the United States and [[Mexico]]. "''The Border'', about desperate lives lived on both sides of the United States–Mexico border, is at once a compelling piece of work, a lucid and personal rendering of Hall's own border experiences both in words and 'pictures.'"&lt;ref&gt;Mag Dimond, ''Douglas Kent Hall—A Borderless Vision'' (Belmont, CA: Wiegand Gallery of the College of Notre Dame, 1997), 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Let 'Er Buck'' is "a really deep look at rodeo and some rodeo people. Most of us have seen what goes on in the arena; this book mostly deals with the rest of it. . . . What [Hall] has said with his typewriter and his camera is bound to be controversial."&lt;ref&gt;''Western Horseman'', December 1973, 74.&lt;/ref&gt; About Hall's book ''In New Mexico Light'', [[Bill Richardson]], governor of New Mexico, wrote: "the thoughtful text in this book [is] testimony to the work of an artist who has dedicated his life to observing the rich cultural texture of New Mexico."&lt;ref&gt;Bill Richardson, in ''In New Mexico Light'' (Santa Fe: Museum of New Mexico Press, 2007), back jacket.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[New Mexico Magazine]]'', Jon Bowman writes, "Hall accompanies the images [in ''In New Mexico Light''] with some of the most lucid, engaging essays on the photographic process you'll ever read. He's a straight-shooter all the way. There's no mention of f-stops or arcane technical knowledge, but rather some fine storytelling, mixing in roughly equal doses of the sacred and the profane."&lt;ref&gt;Jon Bowman, "Books: Guest Review by Jon Bowman," ''New Mexico Magazine'' (January 2008): 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Photographs ==
Many of Hall's images have become known as icons of Americana, such as [[Mesquite, Texas 1973]], and [[Jim Morrison]], Portland. Princeton University curator [[Alfred L. Bush]] writes: "Unlike the majority of the photographic explorers, who are continually clicking away at the [[American West]], Douglas Hall's camera is firmly rooted in the region's very center."&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Bush, Introduction, in Douglas Kent Hall, ''Passing Through'' (Flagstaff, AZ: Northland, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt; Hall's photographs are mainly of people; the protagonist in the [[Sam Shepard]] story "San Juan Bautista" says: "I'm more into faces—people; Robert Frank, Douglas Kent Hall, guys like that."&lt;ref&gt;Sam Shepard, "San Juan Bautista," in ''Day out of Days'' (New York: Vintage, 2010), 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Hall finds his subjects worldwide, from New York to the Southwest, from Russia to Japan, Brazil to Mexico, as well as in places like Morocco and the Outer Hebrides Islands. On the occasion of the exhibition  in Santa Fe of ''Os Brasileiros (The Brazilians)'', David Bell notes, "Hall, who has recently made several trips to Brazil and the Amazon, takes as his subjects not only the miners who were his first objective but families, farmers . . . and students, too. The result is a composite portrait of a people who in most cases appear to give themselves with equal abandon to the camera and to life."&lt;ref&gt;David Bell, ''Journal North'', December 14, 1989, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to work in film and branched into digital imagery, shooting both color and black-and-white. Hall crossed the digital photography boundary by moving into fine art color photographs printed on handmade watercolor paper. [[Mark Strand]] noted in Vogue Magazine, "There is nothing provisional about Hall's enterprise; it is both broad and, in individual photographs, scrupulously resolved. His pictures have an edge, a magical certainty about them that not only justifies but also honors their subjects, no matter how odd or how exploited."&lt;ref&gt;Mark Strand, ''Vogue Magazine'', "People Are Talking About," March 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing about Hall's 2007 book ''In New Mexico Light,'' Dave Gagon notes, "A filmmaker and poet, as well as a photographer, Hall has photographed and written about New Mexico's unique mix of places and people, a broad representation including ancient sites and Spanish churches, Indian ceremonial dances, portraits of artists and writers, viejos and vagabonds. He invigorates his 182 black and white photographs with descriptive prose—something most visual artists have difficulty achieving."&lt;ref&gt;Dave Gagon, ''Deseret Morning News,'' January 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In his Foreword to ''In New Mexico Light'' actor/playwright [[Sam Shepard]] writes, "The photographs in this book are naked impressions of the mind and spirit just waiting for somebody as lucky and gifted as Douglas Kent Hall to hunt them down and seize them with a little black box."&lt;ref&gt;Sam Shepard, Foreword, ''In New Mexico Light,'' photographs by Douglas Kent Hall (Santa Fe: Museum of New Mexico Press, 2007), 12.&lt;/ref&gt; When discussing the complex relationship of a photograph to history, Hall noted to the author of ''Photography: New Mexico'', Kristin Barendsen, "that a photograph imparts the illusion of permanence, when in fact the scene depicted no longer exists. What's more, he said, the photograph does not represent exactly what its maker saw. It takes on a life of its own, and because each viewer experiences it differently, the image reflects an essence of the viewer. 'That's not my photograph,' he said, pointing to his most famous image, ''Mesquite, TX'', hanging in his studio. 'It belongs to the viewer.'"&lt;ref&gt;Kristin Barendsen, ''Photography: New Mexico'' (Albuquerque: Fresco Fine Art Publications, 2008), 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transition to digital photography===
Hall started out with a 35mm camera, added a 2{{fraction|1|4}} square format camera, and kept working with those two formats using [[Nikon]]s, [[Leica Camera]]s, and [[Hasselblad]]s. In the mid-1990s he added digital cameras to his arsenal. In a Rangefinder magazine article, Hall said to author/photographer Paul Slaughter: "I am using a Nikon D70s digital SLR and I always carry a Nikon point-and-shoot that fits into my pocket. It does interesting things to the color (which I like). I also use an Olympus C-5050 digital camera that has a wonderful f/1.8 lens. My new series, ''Travel'', is all digital color and I am fascinated by the images because they are different from anything I've done before. The creative part is the same, the tools are the tools—the cameras."&lt;ref name="Paul Slaughter 2009"/&gt; Hall had five external hard drives full of images and did his best to keep them organized. He said to Slaughter, "I am a bit haphazard in my approach to work. I am more intuitive than anything else. That is part of my imagery evolvement."&lt;ref name="Paul Slaughter 2009"&gt;Paul Slaughter, "Douglas Kent Hall, 21st Century Renaissance Artist," ''Rangefinder'' (March 2009): 96–101.&lt;/ref&gt; Hall used the Adobe  [[Photoshop]] and [[Lightroom]] software programs for after-capture processing and did his own printing, both digital and traditional. He had four [[Epson]] inkjet printers. For digital printing he favored watercolor papers as they render a softer image. He told Slaughter: "I am often upset that I can no longer readily find traditional printing supplies. . . . That concerns me more than thinking about where photography is going. I look at the photographs being done and feel that the new digital work is less convincing than film work. But I feel certain that photographers such as [[Edward Weston]] would have brought a special look to digital. I hope I am doing the same. In the end, with either digital or film, I choose what pleases my eye. I think the world of professional photography is much like it has always been, full of challenge."&lt;ref name="Paul Slaughter 2009"/&gt;

==Quotations==
*The camera, the split-second blink of the shutter, taught me that time does not pass. It is we who pass. We pass through time and we waste only ourselves. Time is indifferent to us and to our folly. Time remains the one certainty we have, the fixed and constant factor-more concrete than life, more permanent than space.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Kent Hall, ''3 / Photographers'' (Roswell: Roswell Museum and Art Center, 1986), p.&amp;nbsp;3.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Artist statement
:Art is my beginning and my end.
:It is everything I do—my morning, my noon, and my night.
:Art is my confessor and my salvation.
:It is each photograph I shoot, each novel, poem, and film I write.
:Art defines what the photograph is, just as the photograph defines who I am; in the same way the words I craft tell the secrets of my heart.
:Art is my Bible, my Constitution.
:Art is my God and my devil.
:Art is everything I am, all I want to be.
:It will be my epitaph.&lt;ref name="Visionary"/&gt;

The organization is chiefly focused on sustaining and enhancing the major transformation and reorganization of the previously failing [[New_Orleans_Public_Schools#Reorganization_of_school_system_following_Hurricane_Katrina|public school system in New Orleans]].

Educate NOW! has become a useful tool that provides in-depth information regarding education such as school governance, facilities, academics and enrollment.  In addition to providing current news, the website also has an extensive archive of relative articles.

'''Estonian Business School''' is a private, higher-education institution situated in [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]]. EBS offers business-related higher education in bachelor-, master- and doctoral levels. Estonian Business School also has a high school part, named EBS Gümnaasium which offers high school education from 10th to 12th grade and a Management Training Centre (EBS Juhtimiskoolituse Keskus) that offers different trainings and development programs.

== History ==
The Estonian Business School (EBS) was founded in 1988. The founders of the university were Professor Madis Habakuk (Estonia), Professor Marshall Fitzgerald (USA), Professor Rein Peterson (Canada) and Ilmar Martens (Canada). It was the first higher-education institution in the Soviet Union that offered an English language-based business education. The need for the creation of a new business-oriented curriculum was imminent during those times, in the light of [[perestroika]].

== Today ==
[[File:Estonian Business School.JPG|thumb|Building of EBS in Tallinn]]
Approximately 1,500 students are currently studying at EBS, and the school has partnership contracts with over 70 universities in Europe, America, Australia, and Asia.

All EBS Bachelor’s, Master’s and Doctoral programmes have been accredited by the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Estonia. EBS is internationally accredited by the Central and East Europe Management Development Association (CEEMAN). Eduniversal (University ranking which provides information on the best Business Schools{{cn|date=February 2018}}) has awarded 4 palms to EBS, which places the school among the top 300 business schools in the world. In 2010, it reached position 141.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.eduniversal-ranking.com/business-school-university-ranking-4palms.html Eduniversal rankings] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623175332/http://www.eduniversal-ranking.com/business-school-university-ranking-4palms.html |date=June 23, 2015 }}, Eduniversal TOP business university rankings - 4 palms.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17678">'''Evidence-based education''' is an approach to all aspects of education—from policy-making to classroom practice—where that is based on randomized trials, as with the testing of new drugs in [[evidence-based medicine]]. When several of these studies are compared, and their conclusions combined, we get a meta-study or [[meta-analysis]]. This is significantly more reliable than the results of individual studies due to the difficulty in controlling variables and individual bias.&lt;ref&gt; Zucker, S. (2004). Scientifically based research: NCLB and assessment. Retrieved from http://images.pearsonassessments.com/images/tmrs/tmrs_rg/ScientificallyBasedResearch.pdf?WT.mc_id=TMRS_Scientifically_Based_Research)&lt;/ref&gt;. "Evidence-based teaching" refers to the teaching aspects.

==Sources of evidence==

There are numerous researchers and institutions that produce analysis of the existing evidence, below are some.

===What Works Clearinghouse===
"What Works Clearinghouse" evaluates educational programs by evidence, rates the quality and quantity of the evidence and estimates the effectiveness. It's operated by the federal National Center for Education Evaluation and Regional Assistance (NCEE). The 10 interventions below are currently the interventions with both the highest effectiveness rating of strong evidence of a positive effect with no overriding contrary evidence.&lt;ref&gt;http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/findwhatworks.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metastudies of Marzano and Hattie===
Two sources of meta-analyses in education include: ''[[Visible Learning]]'' from a team in New Zealand under [[John Hattie]]&lt;ref&gt;Hattie, J (2003) ''Visible Learning'' Oxford:  Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Classroom Instruction that Works'' from a Colorado, USA team under [[Robert Marzano]].&lt;ref&gt;Marzano, R (2001) ''Classroom Instruction that Works'' Alexandria, VA:  ASCD&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Marzano study, there are ten classroom methods which have been shown to work significantly better than many others: 
*using [[Analogy|analogies]] and [[simile]]s
**identifying similarities and differences;
*note making and summarising;
*developing a [[growth mindset]];
*repetition and practice;
*graphical organisers and methods;
*[[cooperative learning]];
*setting goals in advance
**providing feedback ([[formative assessment]]);
*[[hypothesis]] testing;
*activating prior knowledge;
*advance organisers.

Although Hattie's work does not exactly mirror this list, the main reason is that the New Zealand study looks at everything related to education, including family effects and changes to the curriculum, while the Colorado study looked only at classroom methods.  There are, however, no incompatibilities and most of Marzano's top-ten appear high on Hattie's list.

Hattie points out that there is no shortage of effective methods - almost anything you try in education seems to have a small beneficial effect. He therefore uses a scale of ''effect size'' which measures by how much the learning is improved. As an effect-size of 0.4 is the average for all interventions (and also the effect of a hard working, well organised and enthusiastic teacher), he suggests that methods with an effect size above 0.4 should be used as a priority. This ties with Marzano, whose list starts at an effect size of 0.59 for Advance Organisers and increases up the list.

===The Coalition For Evidence-Based Policy Congressional Top Tier Programs===
The Coalition For Evidence-Based Policy, which is a non-partisan, non-profit organization advocating the use of well conducted randomized controlled trials in policy, has recognized three educational programs as "Top Tier". Programs classified as "Top Tier" must have been proven to be effective in randomized controlled trials that were well designed and implemented.&lt;ref&gt;http://toptierevidence.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

|Career Academies
||The intervention happens in learning communities consisting of 150 - 200 students. It combines academic and technical curricula in partnership with local employeers, typically with a specific career theme.
||1 764 students in 9 high schools
||86% of the students in the study sample were Hispanic or African-American and the high schools were in high poverty urban areas.
||11% increase in average annual earnings ($2,460 per year), sustained over the eight years after scheduled high school graduation. The effect was concentrated among men (who experienced a 17% earnings increase), and was not statistically significant for women.
||Approximately $2,300 per student for a three-year Career Academy, or $3,000 per student for a four-year Career Academy.
|-
|Success For All
||A school wide reading program to grades K2 with emphasis on early detection and prevention of reading problems. Key program elements include daily 90-minute reading classes where students are grouped by performance, not age and in addition daily one-on-one tutoring to students with learning problems. First year includes curriculum that focuses on language development and phonemic awareness and second year learning activities that happen in teams or pairs.
||41 schools with a total student population of 2,694 
||56% African-American, 10% Hispanic of whom 72% of students were eligible for federally subsidized lunches.
||Schools that were allocated to the program increased their average reading achievement by 25-30% of a grade-level three years after random assignment. 
||Approximately $220,000 per school (K5) or $510 per student, over the full three-year period.*
|-
|H&amp;R Block College Financial Aid Application Assistance 
||Offering personal assistance in completing a college financial aid application.
||Approximately 1045 students  
||57% female, 55% white, 39% African American who had family income was below average (23,000 $) and average age was 17.7.
||A sizable increase in college attendance and persistence over the 3½-4 years following the intervention, 29% greater likelihood of attending college for two consecutive years.
||Approximately $90 per person to deliver the intervention, in 2012 dollars. $375 per person in federal need-based (“Pell”) grants for college.

==Effective professional development==
For students' results to reflect these high effect-sizes, teachers need to develop the skills of their use. According to several studies,&lt;ref&gt;Joyce.B (2002) ''Student Achievement Through Staff Development'' ASCD&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helen Timperley et al (2007) ''Teacher Professional Learning and Development''&lt;/ref&gt; the time taken to do this lies somewhere between the learning of new facts and the development of a musical or sporting skill. While facts can be learned with a few repetitions, skills may need several hundred hours to develop. The evidence is that teachers start to become skilled with a particular method after about 10 repetitions with improvement plateauing after 6 months to 2 years of use.
[[Continuing professional development]] (CPD) needs to reflect these findings. Teaching staff need the opportunity to learn about and then practice these skills. The role of CPD managers is to ensure that the time is available and the process takes place, not to instruct the teachers to follow directions.
Where staff self-select their training either from external providers or from a range of sessions on a training day, they do not have the chance to develop their skills.  Training, development and discussion of a smaller list of high-effect-size methods will be more effective. This process is sometimes referred to as ''supported experimentation'' or [[peer mentoring#Peer mentoring in the workplace|peer mentoring]].

==Implications for teachers==
Teachers have more effect on the outcomes for their students than anyone else. The difference in outcomes for 2 teachers in the same college is significantly greater than the average of teachers in a 'good' rather than a 'weak' school. The main reason why some schools do better is that they have a higher percentage of teachers who use high effect-size methods.
While individual teachers can improve their students' results using these methods in isolation, it is far more effective if they are adopted department or college-wide so that the discussions, observations and sharing-of-practice can take place easily.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14694">'''ExploraVision''' is a scientific national contest held in the United States and Canada, a joint project by [[Toshiba Corporation]] and the [[National Science Teachers Association]]. Designed for [[K–12]] students of all interest, skill and ability levels, ExploraVision encourages its participants to create and explore a vision of future [[technology]] by developing new ways to apply current [[science]]. Since 1992, more than 360,000 students from across the United States and Canada have competed.

== Requirements ==
Each student is limited to one entry per year. Each team must have no more than 4 students. Students and teachers/mentors complete a Toshiba/NSTA ExploraVision Awards Entry Form, signed by the students, coach and mentor, an abstract of their project, a detailed project description, a list of technology used that is available at present time, a bibliography, and five Web page graphics that will be used later to create an official web page for the project. If a team advances to the national level, they will then be challenged with 3 other tasks: 1. Make a prototype displaying how their project would work. 2. Create a video showing both what your project does and why it would be useful. 3. Make a website based on your webpage graphics that displays everything you submitted originally. There is a 1st and 2nd place for national winners. The 1st-place winners receive $10,000 worth of college funds each, and 2nd-place winners get $5,000. Both teams go on an all expense paid trip to Washington, D.C. where they get to be on live television, receive their awards and participate in many other activities.

The '''extended secondary school''', officially ''twelve-class general educational polytechnic secondary school'', abbreviation EOS, was the standard institution of higher education in the [[Education in East Germany|education system of East Germany]]. It finished with the final examination called ''Reifeprüfung'' /Abitur ([[A-Level]]) at the end of the 12th grade, granting the ''Reifezeugnis'', the certificate of eligibility for university entrance. The school structure was a four-class comprehensive school without any internal or external differentiation. The EOS was established in 1959 to replace the hitherto existing ''Oberschule'' as laid down by the ''Act on Socialistic Development of the School System in the German Democratic Republic'' effective December 2, 1959. The designation [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]] was not common in East Germany.

== Tables of lessons ==

The Ministry of Education determined a table of lessons (''Stundentafel'') which was mandatory for all extended secondary schools. Like for the [[Polytechnic Secondary School]]s there was one uniform, systemic [[curriculum]], also mandatory for all extended secondary schools. One lesson lasted 45 minutes and students went to school six days a week, from Monday to Saturday. On Saturdays, there were approximately five to six lessons.

=== Transitory table of lessons 1959 ===

This table of lessons was effective until the reform of the existing ''Oberschule'' was finished and the newly established extended secondary schools were fully operational under the altered conditions.

=== Standard table of lessons 1961 ===

Compulsory teaching had to follow this standard table of lessons when the transformation process was finished and all requirements could be met by the school, for instance, the number of teachers, number of educators, teaching equipment and so forth.

'''FameLeague''' (Fantasy Market League) is a [[gamification]] technology platform which drives fantasy [[stock market]] [[web applications]] for sports, people and [[show business]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://gametize.com FameLeague official site]&lt;/ref&gt; Licensees can customize FameLeague to create their own fantasy market games. It was the first [[flagship product]] of [http://gametize.com Gametize] (formerly Socialico), a Singapore-based [[startup company|startup]] founded by Keith Ng and Damon Widjaja.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sgentrepreneurs.com/interviews/2009/08/21/in-conversation-with-keith-ng-co-founder-of-fame-socialico/ In Conversation with Keith Ng, co-founder of FAME &amp; Socialico] (Published August 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; It was a simulated [[stock exchange]] and a [[prediction market]] web application with more than 100,000 registered users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://e27.co/fame-facebook-game-stock-exchange/|title=Game For FAME? - The Virtual Stock Exchange|work=e27|access-date=2017-10-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; FameLeague adds [[game|gaming]] mechanics to [[prediction]] speculations, a concept also known as gamification, though that term is not commonly used in 2009.

FameLeague's technology enable users to speculate and purchase shares of predictions, with each potential outcome of a prediction being a [[stock]]. With each accurate prediction stock invested, users stand to earn points. Likewise, users also earn points when the popularity of a prediction increases. The reverse is also true; users will lose points for wrong predictions, or when a dip in popularity occurs for the user's chosen prediction. FameLeague mimics the behaviour of actual [[stock markets]] based on the Zaraba method, but in a highly simplified form.

==History==
FameLeague was a simulated stock exchange and a [[prediction market]] web application integrated with popular social media website, [[Facebook]]. It was inaugurated as a [[Software release life cycle#Beta|beta]] release in April 2009, and went live on November 16, 2009. Prior to its revamp, it had more than 20,000 registered users. It was a top 50 finalist in the fbFund 2009 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=84440649573 fbFund 2009 Top 50 Finalists] (Announced May 29, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; – a $10M seed fund offered to support developers and entrepreneurs working on the Facebook platform. It is the only Singaporean startup, and one of three others in Asia to receive this honour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youngupstarts.com/2010/01/18/socialico-in-a-league-of-its-own/ SOCIALICO – In A League Of Its Own] (Published January 18, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; It has been featured on print media such as [[The Straits Times]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smu.edu.sg/sites/default/files/smu/news_room/smu_in_the_news/2009/sources/ST_20090603_1.pdf|title=Fame Exchange|last=|first=|date=June 3, 2009|website=SMU|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smu.edu.sg/sites/default/files/smu/news_room/smu_in_the_news/2009/sources/TODAY_20090603_1.pdf|title=Remember my name...|last=|first=|date=June 3, 2009|website=SMU|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[ChannelNewsAsia]] and blogs such as SG Entrepreneurs, E27 and Young Upstarts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.youngupstarts.com/2010/01/18/socialico-in-a-league-of-its-own/|title=SOCIALICO – In A League Of Its Own {{!}} Young Upstarts|website=www.youngupstarts.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.techinasia.com/in-conversation-with-keith-ng-co-founder-of-fame-socialico|title=Tech in Asia - Connecting Asia's startup ecosystem|website=[[www.techinasia.com]]|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the FameLeague, the player and the members of his/her social network were listed as stocks that could be purchased by others as shares. Shares on popular [[Media (communication)|media]] such as music, movies and celebrities could also be traded. Like the actual stock exchange, the [[market price]] of a stock was determined by the number of shares traded for that stock. On top of that, prediction stock – or stock that specifies a possible outcome to an ongoing or future event – could also be traded, and their market prices depended on the expected outcome. The objective of the game was to earn as much Silver - the main currency in FameLeague - as possible, by making accurate forecasts while purchasing prediction stocks, and through ability to anticipate which stocks would become more popular on FameLeague when purchasing stock on friends, celebrities or media. 

In May 2010, the management made a strategic decision to segment the broad-based game into individual products such as FameMark, a fantasy game for trading shares of people with a dating angle, and PremierX, a fantasy stock exchange for English Premier League. FameLeague was then developed into a generic technology engine that drives these segmented products upon customization. These three products (FameLeague, FameMark, PremierX) have been stalled in developments.

In February 2012, the company has become a full-fledged cloud-based gamification platform, initially a side project codenamed 'GameMaki' and later branded as [http://gametize.com Gametize]. Along with this, the company also rebranded from 'Socialico' to 'Gametize'.  Today, [http://gametize.com Gametize] is a gamification company that uses game thinking and game psychology to help brands and organizations engage their target audience and motivate for target behaviours, such as in marketing, learning, and training. It engages and motivates behaviors with challenges such as quizzes, photo, QR code challenges. Users can earn rewards, compete, and socialize through a mobile/web experience that can be white-labeled and published in 5 minutes. The technology is used by major brands and enterprises such as Shell, DBS, Samsung, and P&amp;G. It has more than 100,000 users, with more than 10 million challenge completions. Gametize was selected as Singapore's 20 hottest startups by ''Singapore Business Review'' magazine in 2015.

[[File:Frederick Meyer (1872-1961).jpg|right|thumb|Frederick H. Meyer (1872 &amp;ndash; 1961)]]

'''Frederick Heinrich Wilhelm Meyer''' (November 6, 1872 &amp;ndash; January 6, 1961) was a nationally recognized designer and art educator prominent in the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]].  He was a long-time resident of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].&lt;ref name="marquis"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marquis|first1=Albert N., ed.| title= Who’s Who in America: A Biographical Dictionary of Notable Living Men and Women of the United States, vol.21| date=1940–41|publisher=A. N. Marquis Co.| location=Chicago, IL.| page=1811}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Meyer was born near Hamelin, Germany, on November 6, 1872 into a family whose occupations were dominated by furniture craftsmen and weavers.  He apprenticed as a cabinetmaker before he immigrated in 1888 to [[Fresno, California]], where he worked in a large commercial nursery.&lt;ref&gt;Berkeley Daily Gazette, 5 November 1952, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;  In about 1890, he enrolled at the Cincinnati Technical School and two years later transferred to the [[Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art]].  On November 7, 1893 he became a naturalized citizen of the United States of America.  In the spring of 1895 he traveled to Germany, completed the program at the Royal Academy of Berlin for Fine Arts and Mechanical Sciences (aka [[Prussian Academy of Arts]]), and returned to the Pennsylvania Museum School, where he was awarded a master's degree.&lt;ref name="edwards"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=Robert W.| title=Jennie V. Cannon: The Untold History of the Carmel and Berkeley Art Colonies, Vol. 1|date=2012|publisher=East Bay Heritage Project| location=Oakland, Calif.| isbn=9781467545679|pages=79–86, 95–98, 102–103, 252, 518–519, 690}} An online facsimile of the entire text of Vol. 1 is posted on the Traditional Fine Arts Organization website ({{cite web |url=http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/10aa/10aa557.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-06-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160429115613/http://tfaoi.com/aa/10aa/10aa557.htm |archivedate=2016-04-29 |df= }}).&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1898 and 1902 Meyer held the post of Supervisor of Art for the public schools in [[Stockton, California]].  In 1900 he hired as assistant art supervisor [[William S. Rice]], whom he had met in Pennsylvania; Rice was promoted to Meyer's job in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Treseder|first=Roberta Rice|title=William S. Rice: California Block Prints|publisher=Pomegranate Communications, Inc|location=Petaluma, CA|year=2009|pages=8–12|isbn=978-0-7649-4803-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Stockton Meyer met and married in June 1902 the Boston-born Laetitia Summerville.  The couple relocated that fall to [[Berkeley, California]], where he was hired as an “Instructor of Descriptive Geometry” (i.e. mechanical drawing) at the [[University of California]].  A year later was appointed Professor of Applied Arts and head of the Department of Industrial Design at San Francisco's [[Mark Hopkins Institute of Art]], which was administered by U.C. Berkeley.&lt;ref name=edwards /&gt;  In addition, he opened the Craftsman's Shop in San Francisco and designed custom furniture for prestigious clients, including the: [[Phoebe Hearst]] estate at Wyntoon (in association with [[Bernard Maybeck]]), California Building at the 1904 [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition]] in St. Louis, Faculty Club at U.C. Berkeley, and Sequoia Club in San Francisco.&lt;ref name=edwards /&gt;  In October 1905 he was elected president of the California Guild of Arts and Crafts and his wife became its treasurer; they held both positions for two years.&lt;ref&gt;The Courier (Berkeley, CA), 22 December 1906, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;San Francisco Call, 28 April 1907, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;  After the devastating San Francisco earthquake and fine in April 1906, which destroyed the Mark Hopkins Institute, he briefly traveled to Europe.

==Founding of his arts and crafts school==
Meyer expressed his dream of a school that would fuse the practical and ideal goals of craftsmen, designers, and artists, integrated into both theory and practice.  Meyer founded the School of the California Guild of Arts and Crafts in June 1907 with its first location in the [[Studio Building (Berkeley, California)|Studio Building]], one block from the U.C. Berkeley campus.  He had just $45.00 in cash, access to three classrooms and 43 students.  The following year his school was renamed the California School of Arts and Crafts (CSAC) and briefly relocated to the space over a billiard parlor.  In 1910, to accommodate the ever-expanding student body, the CSCA took over the campus of Berkley's old Commercial High School, where they remained until their move in 1923-24 to a larger facility in Oakland on Broadway Avenue.  The school was renamed the California College of Arts and Crafts (CCAC) in 1936 and opened a second campus in San Francisco in 1996.  The school's name was changed for a fourth time in 2003 to the [[California College of the Arts]] (CCA).&lt;ref name=edwards /&gt;  The school developed an international reputation because of Meyer's high standards and the renowned faculty that he hired, including [[Xavier Martinez]], [[William S. Rice]], [[Perham Wilhelm Nahl]], [[Beniamino Bufano]], Isabelle Percy-West, and Hamilton A. Wolf.  Meyer became a popular figure though his many public lectures and sponsorship of exhibitions and charities.  In 1940 he described himself in ''Who’s Who in America'' as a “Progressive Republican . . . and Protestant . . . who specializes in architectural designing, interior decorating and landscape gardening.”&lt;ref name=marquis /&gt;  Meyer remained the CCAC's first president until his retirement in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cca.edu/about/history History of California College of the Arts&lt;/ref&gt;  Frederick Meyer died at the age of 88 on January 6, 1961 in Oakland.

The '''''Jean Bart''''' was a 90-gun [[Suffren class ship of the line|''Suffren'' class ship of the line]] of the [[French Navy]], named in honour of [[Jean Bart]].

She took part in the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854–1855)]] and the [[Battle of Kinburn (1855)]].

In 1856, she was fitted with a [[steam engine]]. From 1864, she was used as a [[training ship]]. She was renamed to ''Donawerth'' in September 1868, and was finally scrapped as ''Cyclope'' in 1886.

[[File:IFSA Network.png|thumb|IFSA Network Logo]]

The '''IFSA Network''' (previously known as the International Finance Students Association&lt;ref name="IFSA Network"&gt;{{cite web |title=IFSA Network Website |url=http://ifsa-network.com/ |website=IFSA Network |publisher=WordPress |accessdate=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a global [[non-profit organization]] entirely run by students. Its main aim is to give students in the fields of finance, economics, management and engineering, a path to enter the professional world of [[finance]] by providing them with lectures, workshops, competitions and connecting them through a global network.

== History ==
The IFSA Network was founded in 2014 in [[Rotterdam]],&lt;ref name="IFSA Network: Letter to Stakeholders"&gt;{{cite web |title=IFSA Network: Letter to Stakeholders |url=http://ifsa-network.com/letter-to-stakeholders-16/ |website=IFSA Network: Letter to Stakeholders |publisher=WordPress |accessdate=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Rotterdam School of Management]]. Its first focus was to regroup people studying Finance, and connect them both between themselves and established financial actors. It quickly spread across Europe and Asia, before opening chapters in South Africa and the Americas.

== Concept ==
The IFSA Network is composed of different chapters throughout the world. The concept is to have semi-independent units,&lt;ref name="IFSA Network: Who Are We"&gt;{{cite web |title=IFSA Network: Who Are We |url=http://ifsa-network.com/who-are-we/ |website=IFSA Network: Who Are We |publisher=WordPress |accessdate=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; each composed of their own board &amp; active members and to create synergy between these in order to provide the best opportunities to their members. The objective of the association is to build a comprehensive network that connects finance students across the globe and enable them to interact and communicate with each other.

== Hierarchy ==
Each chapter has a board, composed of a Chairman, Vice-Chairman, Treasure and General Secretary. This board manages day to day operations locally and supervises its regional activities. Chapters also typically have departments (Finance, Marketing, Events), with a department head managing the analysts.
Chairmen also regularly connect to establish international strategies and overview national operations.

=== Local Venues ===
The various IFSA Network chapters try to offer their communities various local events to connect with the professional world.&lt;ref name="Geneva Students"&gt;{{cite web |title=Geneva students are hungry and getting prepared to face the challenges ! |url=https://www.notzstucki.com/ifsa-event-geneva-students-are-hungry-and-getting-prepared-to-face-the-challenges/ |website=NOTZ STUCKI |publisher=NOTZ STUCKI |accessdate=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, an industry professional will come to the IFSA Network events and meet students. The purpose of those venues is to give students a taste of the professional world, share tips and knowledge, and give an opportunity to network.

=== Boston Consulting Group Case competition ===
In 2018, the IFSA Network in cooperation with the [[Boston Consulting Group]] and InvestSoc, organised the first, three-week long International Cape Town Case Competition. The competition has a unique format where teams consisting of 2 to 4 participants, propose solutions for crises that are presented to them. In their solutions, participants are able to showcase their knowledge, creativity and problem-solving skills on a current macroeconomic issue. 
A jury picks the 15 best international teams and the best local teams, from Cape Town. The selected teams arrive in [[Cape Town, South Africa]], to participate in the second round, and present in front of a select panel of distinguished professors and practitioners. The winning team is awarded a cash prize of 5000 South African Rand.

== Network Creation ==
The IFSA Network is very selective when it comes to opening chapters and selecting board members. Striving for excellency, it will only open chapters in elite universities, and hires only the most ambitious and brightest students. The purpose of this is to ensure smooth operations and maintain a high-level of execution in all of the organisation’s activities. Ultimately, the goal is to have establishments around the world, regrouping all major academic institutions.

== History ==
[[File:Injaz-updated map.pdf|left|thumb|INJAZ Al-Arab's Region Map]]
INJAZ Al-Arab began its work in the Middle East &amp; North Africa ([[MENA]]) region in 1999 and joining [[Junior Achievement]], established its regional office in 2004. Since joining JA, and under INJAZ Al-Arab's founder and former CEO Soraya Salti's leadership, INJAZ grew in program availability, student participation, and reach. Today, it operates in 14 countries as a federation of national operations. INJAZ Al-Arab's network includes Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Kuwait, Lebanon, Morocco, Oman, Pakistan, Palestine, Qatar&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.injaz-qatar.org/|title=INJAZ Qatar|website=www.injaz-qatar.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen.

== Activities ==
INJAZ Al-Arab's programs focus on three core areas of business education which are:

*'''Work Readiness''': The widespread mismatch between the skills attained in school and those demanded by the private sector are feeding current youth unemployment rates. INJAZ Al-Arab programs build teamwork, critical thinking, problem solving, communication, and leadership skills employers look for. 
*'''Financial Literacy''': Teaching young people about responsible money management is key to building their own financial security and an economically prosperous future for themselves.
*'''Entrepreneurship''': Entrepreneurship education prepares youth to be responsible, enterprising individuals. Immersing them in real life learning experiences allows them to take measured risks, manage the results, and learn from the outcomes. This growing number of youth led enterprises creates new jobs and fuels economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jaworldwide.org/ja-works/Pages/JAs-Core-Content.aspx|title=JA's Core Content|website=JA Worldwide|access-date=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Appointed on 22 December 1960 by [[Saud of Saudi Arabia|King Saud]], he succeeded the future king, [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|Faisal bin Abdulaziz Al Saud]] and was succeeded by him again in on 16 March 1961.

In 1648 he was appointed professor of philosophy at the illustrious school of Amsterdam.&lt;ref&gt;''Humanism in an age of science: the Amsterdam Athenaeum in the golden age'', by Dirk van Miert [https://books.google.com/books?id=WkHMkJOMtWMC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;lpg=PA68 pg. 68]&lt;/ref&gt; He taught physics, metaphysics, logic, ethics and politics.

In May 1660, acting on behalf of a consortium of Dutch sugar merchants with plantations in Brazil, he offered the [[Klencke Atlas]] to the King, hoping to gain favourable trade agreements with Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bl.uk/picturing-places/articles/the-klencke-atlas |title=The Klencke Atlas  |publisher=British Museum |author=Tom Harper |date= |accessdate=May 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=barber&gt;Peter Barber. ''The Map Book'', Bloomsbury Publishing USA, 2005. [https://books.google.com/books?id=_tnMJdlgMc4C&amp;pg=PA164 pg. 164]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was made a knight on 19 September 1660.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

In 1669 the "nutty professor" (according to [[Isaac Vossius|Vossius]]) left Amsterdam for Paris and London. In 1672 he died suddenly at Batavia as a notary.

==Relatives==
Ernst van Klenck, a merchant on Russia, married in 1660 a daughter of [[Pieter de Carpentier]]. In 1661 his brother Herman van Klenck was appointed as a [[Governor of Formosa]], but never set a foot on the island when he noticed [[Fort Zeelandia (Taiwan)|Fort Zeelandia]] was occupied by [[Coxinga]]. Coenraad van Klenck, a trader on Russia and member of the Amsterdam [[vroedschap]], was an envoy to Russia in 1675. Their brother-in-law [[William Davidson of Curriehill]] invited [[Mary, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange|Mary Stuart]] into his house in July 1660 and seems to have been a spy for Charles II. In 1660 he was rewarded with an appointment as conservator of the Staple in [[Veere]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgalleries.org/collection/online_az/4:322/result/0/2261?artistId=190&amp;artistName=Abraham%20Lambertsz%20van%20den%20Tempel&amp;initial=T&amp;submit=1 National Galleries Scotland]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Jurassic World Evolution''''' is a [[Business simulation game|business simulation]] [[video game]] developed and published by [[Frontier Developments]]. Based on the 2015 film ''[[Jurassic World]]'', the game was released on 12 June 2018, for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]]. In the game, players construct a dinosaur park on Las Cinco Muertes [[Archipelago]], a group of five islands also known as the "Five Deaths". The game features more than 40 types of dinosaurs; their [[gene]]s can be modified to introduce new features. Players are given contracts to fulfill by three divisions, Science, Security and Entertainment, allowing them to progress. A sandbox mode set on [[Isla Nublar]], the setting of the film, can be unlocked.

The game was created by a development team of approximately 100 people with a budget of around £8 million. Its development began in 2016, after [[NBCUniversal]] approached Frontier Developments about creating a game to accompany the theatrical release of ''[[Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom]]''. To do this, Frontier staff inspected different dinosaur models and reference materials sent by Universal, watched the ''Jurassic Park'' films, read the novels and fan theories. The team consulted paleontologist [[Jack Horner (paleontologist)|Jack Horner]] when they designed the dinosaurs. [[Jeff Goldblum]], [[Bryce Dallas Howard]] and [[B. D. Wong]] reprised their roles from the ''[[Jurassic Park]]'' film series, voicing remarks to players and contributing to the game's narrative.

Announced at [[Gamescom 2017]], the game received a generally mixed critical reception. Critics praised its dinosaur designs and graphics, but the game's contracts, simulation and management gameplay were less well-received. The game's tutorial and learning curve were also criticized. Five weeks after its initial release, the game had sold one million copies through digital and physical sales. The game was supported with free updates and [[downloadable content]] upon release.

==Gameplay==

''Jurassic World Evolution'' is a [[business simulation game]] that allows the player to construct a Jurassic World dinosaur theme park with attractions and research facilities. Players must build an Expedition Center, which sends paleontologists to fossil dig sites to obtain dinosaurs' DNA material.&lt;ref name="IGNPre"/&gt; [[DNA sequencing]] unlocks new dinosaurs and updates their statistics, such as lifespan and resilience. With enough DNA content, players can use the Hammond Research Center to breed and incubate dinosaurs. Players can also improve the dinosaurs' genes by integrating DNA from modern species with that of the dinosaurs to fill their gaps and allow them to evolve. Modifications to the dinosaurs' DNA change their base statistics, as well as everything from their level of aggressiveness to their appearance.&lt;ref name="EuroGPre"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-03-29-jurassic-world-evolution-finds-a-way-to-be-refreshingly-different|title=Jurassic World Evolution finds a way to be refreshingly different|first=Johnny|last=Chiodini|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=29 March 2018|accessdate=29 March 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181024054143/https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-03-29-jurassic-world-evolution-finds-a-way-to-be-refreshingly-different|archivedate=24 October 2018|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game features a terrain tool which allows players to modify the environment by planting trees and creating water sources.&lt;ref name="demo"/&gt;

''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' was one of the first dinosaurs the development team began working on. For the ''T. rex'' roars, the game's sound team obtained audio samples from the films and then altered them for originality. The animation team then altered their ''T. rex'' roaring animations to fit the sound effects. To design the dinosaurs the development team primarily referred to the films for consistency, while incorporating some of the latest scientific discoveries to add to their designs. The team also studied birds and other animals to aid in designing the dinosaurs. In addition to their designs, dinosaur behavior was based on a combination of the films and scientific findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Krupa|first=Daniel|title=How Jurassic World Evolution Made Its T.

Critics praised the dinosaurs featured in the game. Sam Loveridge of ''[[GamesRadar+]]'' liked the variety as well as the [[cutscene]] that was displayed when a dinosaur is released from the incubation center. He enjoyed being able to control the jeep and the ACU helicopter from a third-person perspective, a mechanic he applauds for allowing players to relate to the dinosaurs. He added that he "lost entire evenings to [the game] without even thinking" due to its relaxing nature.&lt;ref name="GRadarRev"/&gt; [[Game Revolution]]{{'}}s Paul Tamburro praised the dinosaurs' design, in particular, Frontier's attention to detail and the dinosaurs' animation.&lt;ref name="GameRevRev"/&gt; James Swinbanks of ''[[GameSpot]]'' agreed, praising the dinosaurs. He also enjoyed the need to learn each dinosaur's personality, requirements and behaviors, adding the process is "surprisingly satisfying".&lt;ref name="GSpot"/&gt; ''[[Game Informer]]'' {{'}}s Daniel Tack liked that players can experiment with different genes, though he commented that it was not a "freeform experience".&lt;ref name="GIRev"/&gt; Dan Stapleton of ''[[IGN]]'' disagreed and felt that unlocking genes was tedious, describing the process as a series of "mandatory robotic actions".&lt;ref name="IGNRev"/&gt; While he liked the dinosaur variety, he lamented the lack of ''[[pterosaurs]]'' and aquatic prehistoric reptiles at launch. ''[[Destructoid]]''{{'}}s Dam Roemer commended the inclusion of lesser- known dinosaurs species, singling out ''[[Giganotosaurus]]'' and ''[[Deinonychus]]''.&lt;ref name="DestructRev"/&gt; 

The simulation aspect of the game received mixed reviews. Loveridge held a positive opinion regarding dinosaur management, as each species has their own needs and niches that players must fulfill. He felt the park management aspect, including the construction of facilities and utilities, was "minimal".&lt;ref name="GRadarRev"/&gt; Tamburro compared the simulation to ''[[RollerCoaster Tycoon]]'' and ''[[Zoo Tycoon]]''. He enjoyed the chaos created when dinosaurs break out, but he was disappointed that dinosaurs did not attack the park's staff carrying out maintenance inside the enclosures.&lt;ref name="GameRevRev"/&gt; Philippa Warr of ''[[PC Gamer]]'' praised the dinosaurs but criticized the lack of attention to missions and individual guests' views and happiness ratings on the park. She also noted the simulation lacked depth, as buildings looked largely the same and the environment soon became stale.&lt;ref name="PCGUSRev"/&gt; Swinbanks felt dealing with natural disasters and dinosaur breakout was exciting initially, but soon became repetitive. He also lamented the lack of new challenges presented in the later stage of the game.&lt;ref name="GSpot"/&gt; Tack criticized the tiresome aspect of simulation and the constant need to wait for objectives to be completed, comparing them to a [[mobile game]].&lt;ref name="GIRev"/&gt; Describing the simulation as "shallow", Roemer criticized the lack of time constraints, cleanliness ratings, and a full day-night cycle. He was also disappointed by the small size of each island, which made park building "unfulfilling".&lt;ref name="DestructRev"/&gt; Stapleton agreed, saying that the small islands limited players' creativity. He noted that players cannot speed up time in the game, a signature feature in many other simulators and builders, and criticized its exclusion as it forced players to wait aimlessly to get enough cash to perform an action.&lt;ref name="IGNRev"/&gt;

The game's contracts garnered mixed opinions. Loveridge believed they helped introduced a structure to the game, though he commented that these missions did not form a cohesive narrative.&lt;ref name="GRadarRev"/&gt; Tamburro enjoyed the process of progressing from one island to the next, as each island has its own unique layout and landscape prompting players to create a new park that is different from the previous ones. He noted that the contracts helped players to unlock new items, but he felt they were not "exciting".&lt;ref name="GameRevRev"/&gt; Warr criticized the lack of variety featured in the missions, with different scenarios only presenting minor modifications and adjusting the difficult slightly. He also disliked the contracts for occasionally forcing players to complete missions that do not make sense, such as releasing a dinosaur to kill guests.&lt;ref name="PCGUSRev"/&gt; Swinbanks also criticized three contract factions, adding that players' need to satisfy and balance all three parties demands as "arbitrary".&lt;ref name="GSpot"/&gt; Roemer praised Goldblum's performance, though he noted the overarching plot "goes nowhere". He described the game's progression system as "awful" and wished to skip them entirely.&lt;ref name="DestructRev"/&gt;

The game's tutorial and guidance to players was criticized. Loveridge noted that certain missions were confusing with some late game objectives being presented too early, forcing him to dismiss them to progress. He singled out the tutorial section for being incompetent, failing to inform players about key aspects of the game such as power distribution and landscaping tools, which often create obstruction. and terrain errors that prevent players from constructing certain buildings and modifying the landscape.&lt;ref name="GRadarRev"/&gt; Warr noted pacing errors with the tutorials, saying that some of them showed up way too late.&lt;ref name="PCGUSRev"/&gt;

Reviewers had mixed opinions of the game as a whole. Loveridge called it an intricate simulation game that fans of the series would enjoy, and he commended the many references to the film featured in the game.&lt;ref name="GRadarRev"/&gt; Tamburro agreed and called it the best ''Jurassic Park''-themed game, though he noted that the game had more constraints than Frontier's previous park builder, ''[[Planet Coaster]]''.&lt;ref name="GameRevRev"/&gt; Initially impressed by the game, Warr was disappointed after extended play time feeling the game was lacking depth.&lt;ref name="PCGUSRev"/&gt; Swinbanks noted that despite its shortcomings, the game was "faithful" to the franchise. He felt that it was "a good park management sim in its own right".&lt;ref name="GSpot"/&gt; Roemer felt that the game's development was rushed, and the lack of depth was problematic.&lt;ref name="DestructRev"/&gt; Stapleton called it a "bad" game for being largely boring.&lt;ref name="IGNRev"/&gt;

===Sales===
Five weeks after its initial release, the game had sold one million copies through digital and physical sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/07/19/jurassic-world-evolution-hits-1-million-copies-sold |title=Jurassic World Evolution Hits 1 Million Copies Sold |first=Shabana |last=Arif |work=IGN |date=19 July 2018 |accessdate=19 July 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180720115530/http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/07/19/jurassic-world-evolution-hits-1-million-copies-sold|archivedate=24 October 2018|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in the United States in 1978, '''Kindermusik''' is an [[early childhood education]] [[music and movement]] program for [[children]] from [[infants]] to 7 years of age (2nd grade in [[Elementary School]]).  It is based on a [[Kindergarten]] music and movement program developed by educational experts in Germany in the 1960s.  When developing Kindermusik's [[curriculum]], the original creative team drew on the works of esteemed musicians and educators from Europe and Asia, including [[Shinichi Suzuki (violinist)|Shinichi Suzuki]], [[Maria Montessori]], [[Zoltán Kodály]], [[Emile Jaques-Dalcroze]] and [[Carl Orff]].

Within a few years, Kindermusik programs had expanded into Canada, and, from there, around the world.  More than 1 million families in at least 60 countries have attended Kindermusik classes in programs worldwide.

The Kindermusik curriculum is based on the research of the original creators, but has been revised as the curriculum development team examines emerging research in child development, music and education.  The program uses high-quality recordings, instruments, and award-winning literature books along with traditional nursery rhymes, fingerplays and songs to build a strong foundation of not only music education, but other areas of development, including cognitive, emotional, social, physical, and language development.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kindermusik.com/about/&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase derives from the German for ''Children's Music''.&lt;ref&gt;https://translate.google.com/#de|en|kindermusik&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kindermusik International]] is a company based in the [[United States]] that develops the curricula and materials used by Licensed Kindermusik Programs around the world.

"[[Kindermusik (Demo)]]" is the name of a five song demo tape independently released by New York City based industrial metal band [[Hanzel und Gretyl]] in 1994.

{{Hindu philosophy}}

'''Swami Krishnananda Saraswati''' (25 April 1922 – 23 November 2001) was a disciple of [[Sivananda Saraswati]] and served as the General Secretary of the [[Divine Life Society]] in [[Rishikesh]], India from 1958 until 2001. Author of more than 40 texts, and lecturing extensively, on [[yoga]], [[religion]], and [[metaphysics]], Krishnananda was a prolific theologian, saint, yogi and philosopher.

Krishnananda was President of the Sivananda Literature Research Institute and the Sivananda Literature Dissemination Committee.  He served as editor of the Divine Life Society’s monthly paper, ''Divine Life'', for 20 years.

==Life==
Subbaraya, rechristened Swami Krishnananda by his mentor Swami Sivananda Saraswati, was born on 25 April 1922 into an orthodox [[Shivalli Brahmins|Madhva]] family. He learnt Sanskrit at an early age and took to reading and memorising Sanskrit works. His understanding of Hindu scriptures predisposed him towards [[Advaita Vedanta|Advaita philosophy]]. He yearned for spiritual learning and renunciation, however, his father persuaded him into accepting a government job at Hospet Government Training School in Bellary in 1943. He fell ill there and returned home. In 1944, he left his home to visit [[Sivananda Ashram]] in Rishikesh. He worked as an editor in the ''[[Ashram]]'' and in 1948, on Sivananda’s request, he wrote his first book ''Realisation of the Absolute''.&lt;ref name="JonesRyan2006"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Constance|last2=Ryan|first2=James D.|title=Encyclopedia of Hinduism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OgMmceadQ3gC&amp;pg=PA245|year=2006|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-0-8160-7564-5|pages=244–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; (note: the year 1948 in the preceding sentence is incorrect. Swami Krishnananda's Preface to The Realization of the Absolute is dated 1 August 1947. Swami Sivananda's Foreword is dated 8 September 1947).&lt;ref&gt;The Realization of the Absolute, Fourth Edition, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, he became the general secretary of Divine Life Society. He spent his life in the Ashram giving lectures and writing over 40 books on philosophy, Hindu scriptures, yoga, meditation, mysticism and poetry till his death on 23 November 2001.

'''Mary Adaline Edwarda Carter''' was an American industrial art instructor and designer from the [[U.S. state]] of [[Vermont]].

==Early years and education==
Mary Adaline Edwarda Carter was born in [[Hinesburg, Vermont]]. She was the oldest child of Edward H. and Mary Adaline Kellogg Carter. Her parents were natives of Vermont, descended from the early [[New England]] settlers, of English and Scotch origin. Her early education was chiefly from nature and object study. At the age of eight, she attended private and public schools in [[Burlington, Vermont]], and in [[Vineland, New Jersey]], where her family removed in 1866. The years of country life spent in [[southern New Jersey]] during her youth were filled with formative influences that laid a broad and sound basis for her lifework.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1897|p=157}}

Circumstances and environments led Carter to finding occupations for herself, or to having them given her, that promoted inventive and executive powers and stimulated love for science and art. Thirst for larger opportunities and higher education developed, but adversities came, overwork, intense mental strain, then long and severe illness. After health was restored, she was by degrees led to [[industrial art]] as her [[vocation]]. Though beset by obstacles that would have turned aside one of less resoluteness, her course was progressive and largely successful. With simply the intention of becoming proficient as a teacher of drawing, she entered the Woman's Art School, [[Cooper Union]], [[New York City]].{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1897|p=157}}

==Career==
After graduating with highest honors, in 1876, her services were immediately required as a designer for [[embroidery]]. While thus engaged, part of her time was still devoted to art study, and throughout her years of working, she was a constant student in art and other educational subjects.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1897|p=157}}

In the [[Centennial Exhibition]], in 1876, she made a special study of the needlework, art embroideries and textiles of all countries. Not long after, her [[watercolor]] studies from nature attracted the notice of [[John Bennett (painter)|John Bennett]] (1840-1907), the English painter of art-pottery, and she became his pupil and assistant. In 1879, a number of pieces of [[faience]] decorated by her were sent by invitation to the exhibition of [[Howell James &amp; Co.]], [[London]], England. One of her vases was presented to Sir [[Frederic Leighton]], president of the [[Royal Academy]], and others were sold to art museums in England, to be kept as examples of American art pottery. The same year, some of her work in faience was shown in New York, and won much praise.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1897|p=157}}

When the [[Candace Wheeler#Associated Artists|Associated Artists]] began their united enterprise which did much in revolutionizing and elevating household taste and interior decoration of American home and public buildings, Carter's services were secured by [[Louis Tiffany]], and she was connected with them several years. At first having to do with all the kinds of work undertaken, glass, mosaics, metals, wood, embroideries, hangings, wall and ceiling coverings, painting or anything else decoratively used in buildings, she was the first woman thus employed. Later, having developed marked ability in plastic art, she had special charge of their pottery and modeling department. Her ornamental relief-work, panels and friezes were often used with heads and figures by [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]], and combined with work by [[Charles Caryl Coleman]], [[Maitland Armstrong]] and other well known artists in the decoration of public and private buildings in New York and different parts of the country. Her designs for memorial and other windows, for decoration of interiors and for different purposes were used in churches and homes, on both [[East Coast of the United States|east]] and [[West Coast of the United States|west]] coasts.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1897|p=157}}

===Instructor===
Frequently, artists, [[draughtsmen]], teachers and others sought instruction from her in special subjects. At different times, she taught classes of children in drawing, and in the Woman's Art School one in [[porcelain painting]]. Since 1886, she was instructor of the free classes in clay-modeling, applied design and normal training in form-study and drawing for the [[YWCA USA|Young Woman's Christian Association of New York]]. The courses of study in those classes and all accessories were planned and carried out by her.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1897|p=157}}

==Personal life==
From about 1880, Carter resided with her family in the upper suburban part of New York City. She was a staunch member of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1897|p=157}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4672">The '''mercury beating heart''' is an [[electrochemistry|electrochemical]] redox reaction between the elements [[mercury (element)|mercury]], iron and chromium. The reaction causes a blob of mercury in water to oscillate.

The observeable reaction demonstrates an effect of a non-homogeneous [[electrical double layer]].&lt;ref&gt;Mercury Beating Heart: Modifications to the Classical Demonstration  Najdoski, Metodija; Mirceski, Valentin; Petruševski, Vladimir M.; Demiri, Sani. [[J. Chem. Educ.]] '''2007''', 84, 1292. [http://jchemed.chem.wisc.edu/Journal/Issues/2007/Aug/abs1292.html Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Avnir, David | title=Chemically induced pulsations of interfaces: the mercury beating heart | journal=Journal of Chemical Education | publication-date=1989-03-01 | publisher=American Chemical Society Division of Chemical Education | volume=v66 | issue=n3 | pages=211 (2) | issn=0021-9584 | bibcode=1989JChEd..66..211A | doi=10.1021/ed066p211 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often used as a classroom demonstration.

==The experiment==
[[File:Gallium beating heart.webm|thumb|Mercury beating heart is similar to gallium beating heart (shown on video).]]
In the experiment a droplet of mercury is placed in a [[watch glass]], immersed in an [[electrolyte]] such as [[sulfuric acid]] which contains an [[oxidizing agent]] such as [[hydrogen peroxide]], [[potassium permanganate]], or potassium dichromate. The tip of an iron nail is positioned almost touching the mercury. If the position of the nail tip is just right, the mercury blob begins to oscillate, changing shape.

==The explanation==
In one variation the mechanism is thought to be the following: The dichromate oxidizes the mercury, forming a layer of mercury oxide.  In the process the dichromate is reduced to the chromium(III) ion.  The oxidized layer on the mercury reduces the surface tension of the blob and the blob flattens out coming in contact with the iron nail.  Then the mercury sulfate oxidizes the iron to the iron(II) ion, and in the process is reduced back to metallic mercury. Once there is no oxide coating left on the mercury blob, the surface tension increases and the blob rounds up and loses contact with the nail, to start the process over again.

The net reaction is that the dichromate oxidizes the iron.  This favorable reaction drives the mercury oxidations/reductions and the oscillations in shape.  When the dichromate is all reduced, the reaction stops.

There may be other mechanisms involved, however.  Lin et al. appear to report that the oscillations occur without the presence of the oxidizing agent, though the mercury does not appear to get an oxidizing layer on it and the oscillations are much weaker.

An [[electrical double layer]] forms between the surface of the mercury droplet and the electrolyte solution. At rest this layer is uniform. When the iron tip is introduced a [[redox reaction]] starts in which iron is oxidized to the [[ferric]] ion. At the same time the oxidizing reagent is spent for instance when hydrogen peroxide together with [[hydronium]] ions is reduced to water. Because the oxidation only takes place in the vicinity of the tip and the reduction process covers the whole droplet surface the [[surface tension]] is no longer homogeneous resulting in oscillations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Although this reaction is mediated by changes in surface tension, it is very similar in mechanism to other chemical oscillators such as the [[Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction]], which has several intermediate redox reactions driven by the oxidation of malate by bromine.

The mercury beating heart was first observed by Carl Adolf Paalzow in 1858. [[Jöns Jakob Berzelius]] is reported to have used [[electrode]]s.

'''National Council for Teacher Education Act, 1993''' is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of India]] which gave statutory recognition to the [[National Council for Teacher Education]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/lsdeb/ls10/ses5/16241192.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently passed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://india.gov.in/sectors/education/national_council.php]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objective==
The objective of the bill, according to the government, was to "provide for the establishment of a [[National Council for Teacher Education]]" as a separate body rather than as just an advisory department, a role the council had held since its inception in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;[http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/lsdeb/ls10/ses6/24140593.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National University of the Patagonia San Juan Bosco''' (Spanish: ''Universidad Nacional de la Patagonia San Juan Bosco'') is a [[higher education]] establishment in [[Patagonia]], southern [[Argentina]]. It was created on February 25, 1980, by law 22.713, as the merge of two national universities: the "Universidad de San Juan Bosco" and "Universidad Nacional de la Patagonia". It is named after [[John Bosco|San Juan Bosco]], patron saint of the area.

The university has four schools - [[Engineering]], [[Economy]], [[Humanities]], [[Legal]], and [[Natural Sciences]], spread over several cities in Patagonia: [[Puerto Madryn]], [[Trelew]], [[Esquel]], [[Comodoro Rivadavia]], and [[Ushuaia]]. The central faculty is located in Comodoro Rivadavia.
The University has {{As of|2005|lc=on}} 14,000 students, with 5000 in the main school.

In 2015, the university opened to the inhabitants of the [[Falkland Islands]]. The academic program was translated into English, language courses were designed and a system of special scholarship was established. Thus, National University of the Patagonia San Juan Bosco became the first Argentine university to extend their academic offer to [[Falkland Islanders]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elpatagonico.com/con-la-presencia-filmus-la-universidad-presenta-su-oferta-academica-los-habitantes-islas-malvinas-n1288000&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22936">'''Online learning''' involves courses offered by postsecondary institutions that are 100% virtual, excluding [[massively open online course]]s (MOOCs). In the domain of higher education there are two distinct methods in which a learner can engage with an academic institution; the traditional method of brick-and-mortar facilities and the virtual method through online learning. This article will focus on the virtual platform of online learning. Today's online learning is the newest development in [[distance education]] that began in the mid-1990s with the spread of the internet. Learner experience is typically asynchronous, but may also incorporate synchronous elements. The vast majority of institutions utilize a Learning Management System for the administration of online courses. As theories of distance education evolve, digital technologies to support learning and pedagogy continue to transform as well.

== History ==

The first correspondence courses began in the 1800s using parcel post to reach students who couldn't be on a university campus.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By the early 1900s, communication technologies improved and distance education took to the radio waves. In 1919 professors at the University of Wisconsin began an amateur radio station, becoming the first licensed radio station dedicated to educational broadcasting.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kentor|first=H.|year=2015|title=Distance education and the evolution of online learning in the United States|url=|journal=Curriculum and Teaching Dialogue|volume=17|pages=21–34|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, access to higher education was again expanded through the invention of the television; giving birth to what was known as the telecourse. The University of Iowa began to experiment with television for educational purposes in the 1930s. It was not until the 1950s, when the FCC began to reserve television frequencies for educational purposes, that telecourses caught the attention of the public. The value of television for education was furthered by the establishment of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) in 1967. The CPB mission was "to encourage the growth and development of public radio and television broadcasting, including the use of such media for instructional, educational, and cultural purposes" (as cited in,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;27).

Online learning emerged in 1982 when the Western Behavioral Sciences Institute in La Jolla, California opened its School of Management and Strategic Studies. The School employed computer conferencing to deliver a distance education program to business executives.&lt;ref&gt;See Rowan, Roy (1983). Executive Ed. at Computer U. Fortune, March 7, 1983; Feenberg, Andrew (1993). "Building a Global Network:  The WBSI Experience," in L. Harasim, ed., Global Networks:  Computerizing the International Community, MIT Press,  pp. 185-197. &lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 the University of Phoenix began offering education programs through the internet. In 1993 with the debut of the first Internet web browser, created by the University of Illinois, online learning began to flourish.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Leading the e-learning transformation of higher education|last=Miller|first=Gary|last2=Benke|first2=Meg|last3=Chaloux|first3=Bruce|last4=Ragan|first4=Lawrence C.|last5=Schroeder|first5=Raymond|last6=Smutz|first6=Wayne|last7=Swan|first7=Karen|publisher=Stylus|year=204|isbn=978-1-57922-796-8|location=Sterling, Virginia|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, the first fully online programs were founded: New York University Online, Western Governor's University, the California Virtual University&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; and Trident University International.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=36058432|title=Company Overview of Trident University International|website=www.bloomberg.com|language=EN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbb.org/sdoc/business-reviews/schools-academic-colleges-and-universities/trident-university-international-llc-in-cypress-ca-13166646|title=Trident University International LLC Overview|website=www.bbb.org|language=EN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 only 8% of students were enrolled in an online course, but by 2008 enrollment had increased to 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2012154|title=Learning at a Distance: Undergraduate Enrollment in Distance Education Courses and Degree Programs|last=Radford|first=A.W.|date=2011|website=nces.ed.gov|publisher=|language=EN|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expansion of online education has not slowed either; by the fall of 2013 nearly 30% of all postsecondary students were enrolled in some kind of distance education course.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=80|title=Digest of education statistics, 2014|last=National Center for Education Statistics|first=|date=2016|website=nces.ed.gov|publisher=U.S. Department of Education|language=EN|others=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the data on online course and program completion are complex,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usnews.com/|title=Experts debate graduation rates for online students|last=Haynie|first=D.|date=January 30, 2015|work=U. S. News &amp; World Report|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; researchers have noted high rates of attrition (ranging from 20%-50%) among students enrolled in online courses compared to those who take traditional face-to-face courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.facultyfocus.com/|title=Online student retention strategies: A baker's dozen of recommendations|last=Jazzar|first=M.|date=December 7, 2012|website=Faculty Focus|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of learner experiences (methods of delivery) ==

Given the improvements in delivery methods, online learning environments provide a greater degree of flexibility than traditional classroom settings.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Giesbers|first=B.|last2=Rienties|first2=B.|last3=Tempelaar|first3=D.|last4=Gijselaers|first4=W.|date=2014-02-01|title=A dynamic analysis of the interplay between asynchronous and synchronous communication in online learning: The impact of motivation|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcal.12020/abstract|journal=Journal of Computer Assisted Learning|language=en|volume=30|issue=1|pages=30–50|doi=10.1111/jcal.12020|issn=1365-2729}}&lt;/ref&gt; Online platforms can also offer more diverse representations of student populations as learners prepare for working in the twenty-first century.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stewart, Anissa R., Harlow, Danielle B., &amp; DeBacco, Kim|year=2011|title=Students' experiences of synchronous learning in distributed environments|url=|journal=Distance Education|volume=32 |issue=3|pages=357–381|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diversity comes from interacting with students outside of one's geographical location, possibly offering a variety of perspectives on course content.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Courses offered completely online are primarily delivered in an asynchronous learning or synchronous learning format.

[[Asynchronous learning]] environments are described as online spaces where work is supported through the use of digital platforms in such a way that participants are not required to be online at the same time.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hrastinski|first=Stefan|year=2008|title=Asynchronous and synchronous e-learning|url=|journal=Educause Quarterly|volume=4|pages=51–55|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=147 practical tips for teaching online groups|last=Hanna, Donald E., Glowacki-Dudka, Michelle, &amp; Conceicao-Runlee, Simone|publisher=Atwood Publishing|year=2000|isbn=|location=Madison, Wisconsin|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Threaded discussions, e-mail, and telephone calls are options of asynchronous delivery.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lieblein|first=Edward|year=2000|title=Critical factors for successful delivery of online programs|url=|journal=Internet and Higher Education|volume=3|pages=161–174|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gives meaning to the anytime-anywhere appeal of online learning. A benefit of asynchronous learning is the learner having more time to generate content-related responses to the instructor and peer postings; they have time to find facts to back their written statements.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The additional time provides an opportunity to increase the learner's ability to process information.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The spelling and grammar within postings of an asynchronous environment are like that found in formal academic writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Ho, Chia-Huan  |author2=Swan, Karen|year=2007|title=Evaluating online conversation in an asynchronous environment: An application of Grice's Cooperative|url=|journal=Internet and Higher Education|volume=10 |issue=1|pages=3–14|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, one of the main limitations of this delivery method is the greater potential for a learner to feel removed from the learning environment. Asynchronous learning is viewed as less social in nature and can cause the learner to feel isolated.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Providing the student a feeling of belonging to the university or institution will assist with feelings of isolation; this can be done through ensuring links to university support systems and the library are accessible and operable.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

[[Synchronous learning]] environments most closely resemble face-to-face learning.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Synchronous learning takes place through digital platforms where the learners are utilizing the online media at the same time. When compared to asynchronous learning, synchronous online environments provide a greater sense of feeling supported, as the exchange of text or voice is immediate and feels more like a conversation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; If platforms such as web conferencing or video chat are used, learners are able to hear the tone of voice used by others which may allow for greater understanding of content.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; As in a traditional classroom environment, online learners may feel a need to keep the conversation going, so there is a potential for focusing on the quantity of responses over the quality of content within the response.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However the synchronous environment, with real-time responses, can allow for students or instructors to provide clarity to what was said, or alleviate any possible misconceptions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Learning management systems ==

Most online learning occurs through a college's or university's [[learning management system]] (LMS). A LMS is a software application for maintaining, delivering, and tracking educational resources. According to the Educause Center for Analysis and Research (ECAR) use of a LMS is nearly ubiquitous as 99% of colleges and universities report having one in place.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://library.educause.edu/resources/2014/9/the-current-ecosystem-of-learning-management-systems-in-higher-education-student-faculty-and-it-perspectives|title=The current ecosystem of Learning Management Systems in Higher Education: Student, faculty, and IT perspectives|last=Dahlstrom|first=Eden|last2=Brooks|first2=D. Christopher|date=September 17, 2014|website=Educause|publisher=|access-date=|last3=Bichsel|first3=Jacqueline}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among faculty, 87% report using a LMS and find them useful for "enhancing  teaching (74%) and student learning (71%)" &lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;(p.&amp;nbsp;10). Similarly, 83% of students use an LMS in their courses, with the majority (56%) using them in most or all courses.

Most institutions utilize LMSs by external vendors (77%), Blackboard currently dominates the LMS environment with an adoption rate of  31.9%, followed by Moodle at 19.1%, and Canvas at 15.3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://edutechnica.com/2016/03/20/lms-data-spring-2016-updates/|title=LMS data – Spring 2016 updates|date=March 20, 2016|website=edutechnica|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the last year Canvas, by Instructure, has gained an increasing amount of the market share (see graphic).[[File:LMS market share graphic 2016.jpg|thumb|The graphic shows the market share of LMS across U.S. and Canadian higher education institutions]] Reflecting these changes the ECAR reported that 15% of institutions are in the process of updating and/or replacing their LMS; the main reasons cited were the need to "upgrade functions (71%), replace legacy systems (44%), and reduce costs (18%)"  &lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;(p.&amp;nbsp;6).

ECAR's survey of institutions found that generally, both faculty and students are satisfied with the LMS; with three-quarters satisfied with the LMS for posting content (faculty) and accessing content (students).&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  In contrast, the lowest levels of satisfaction with the LMS reported by faculty were with features that allow for "meaningful" interaction between students and their instructor, students and other students, and for study groups or collaborating on projects (p.&amp;nbsp;12). Similarly, just under half of the students surveyed reported satisfaction of the LMS for "engaging in meaningful interactions with students" (p.&amp;nbsp;12).

While LMSs are largely being used as a repository for course materials (e.g. syllabus, learning content, etc.) and platforms for the assessment of learning, recent developments are making them more customizable through [[Learning Tools Interoperability|LTI]] standards.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; According to a report by the Educause Learning Initiative the ''Next Generation Digital Learning Environment'' will be more responsive to students' needs creating a more customizable experience. The functional characteristics of the next generation of digital learning environments include: "interoperability and integration; personalization; analytics, advising, and learning assessments; collaboration; and, accessibility and universal design"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://library.educause.edu/resources/2015/4/the-next-generation-digital-learning-environment-a-report-on-research|title=The next generation digital learning environment: A report on research|last=Brown|first=M.|last2=Dehoney|first2=J.|date=April 27, 2015|website=Educause|publisher=|access-date=|last3=Millichap|first3=N.}}&lt;/ref&gt; (p.&amp;nbsp;4)

== Theory ==

The well-known educational theorist [[John Dewey]] argued that learning occurs in collaboration with knowledgeable others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Democracy and education: An introduction to the philosophy of education|last=Dewey|first=John|publisher=The Free Press|year=1997|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|quote=|orig-year=1916|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, psychologist [[Jean Piaget]] noted that in order for learning to occur, the content must be meaningful to the student. [[Jean Piaget|Piaget's]] constructivist theory of learning highlighted the importance of engaged learning where meaningful discussions were held between peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The mechanisms of perception|last=Piaget|first=Jean|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=|location=Abingdon, OX|pages=|quote=|orig-year=1969|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The sociologist [[Lev Vygotsky]] also emphasized the importance of social interaction in learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The genesis of higher mental functions|last=Vygotsky|first=L. S.|work=The collected works of L.S. Vygotsky|publisher=Springer|year=1997|isbn=|editor-last=Rieber|editor-first=R. W.|location=New York, NY|pages=97–119|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, in formal education this interaction occurs largely between the student and the teacher, but as students and teachers become distanced from each other in the virtual classroom, creative strategies for instruction continue to be developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Engaging the online learner|last=Conrad|first=R.-M.|last2=Donaldson|first2=J. A.|publisher=Jossey-Bass|year=2004|isbn=|location=San Francisco, CA|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While early approaches to online learning were merely an extension of independently-driven correspondence courses, today's approach to online learning focuses on engagement and [[active learning]].

Theories of distance education are relatively new to the scene. These theories can be placed into four main categories: 1) theories of independent study (e.g. Charles Wedemeyer, Michael Moore); 2) theories of the industrialization of teaching (e.g. Otto Peters); 3) theories of interaction and communication (e.g. Borje Holmberg); and 4) a synthesis of existing theories of communication and diffusion and philosophies of education (e.g. Hilary Perraton).&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Teaching and learning at a distance|last=Simonson|first=M.|last2=Smaldino|first2=S.|last3=Albright|first3=M.|last4=Zvacek|first4=S.|publisher=Pearson|year=203|isbn=|edition=2nd|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the equivalency theory of distance education posits that all students should have learning experiences of equal value and that it is the responsibility of the instructional designer to create learning experiences for the distance learner that will be successful in meeting the course objectives.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; As online education has become the dominant form of distance education, new theories are emerging that combine elements of constructivism and technology. Siemens' ''Connectivism'' "is the integration of principles explored by chaos, network, and complexity and self-organization theories".(p.&amp;nbsp;5&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Siemens|first=George|year=2005|title=Connectivism: A learning theory for the digital age|url=http://itdl.org/index.htm|journal=International Journal of Instructional Technology &amp; Distance Learning|volume=2 |issue=1|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Connectivism places knowledge in "diversity of opinions" (p.&amp;nbsp;5) and that learning is aided through creating and nurturing connections of "fields, ideas, and concepts". (p.&amp;nbsp;5&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;)

== Pedagogy ==

[[Transformative learning]] or Transformative pedagogy "encourages students to critically examine their assumptions, grapple with social issues, and engage in social action" ( p.&amp;nbsp;219&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Myers|first=Steven A|year=2008|title=Using transformative pedagogy when teaching online|url=|journal=College Teaching|volume=56 |issue=4|pages=219–224|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Five suggestions for preparing the online environment for transformative pedagogy are: "(a) create a safe and inviting environment; (b) encourage students to think about their experiences, beliefs, and biases; (c) use teaching strategies that promote student engagement and participation; (d) pose real-world problems that address societal inequalities; and (e) help students implement action-oriented solutions" (p.&amp;nbsp;220&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;). There are four fundamental characteristics that may assist with the success of online instruction: (1) the learner should be actively engaged throughout the course; (2) group participation can assist with meeting course objectives; (3) frequent student-student and student-teacher interaction can alleviate the feelings of isolation; and (4) the course content should relate to the real world to enhance meaning for participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McFarlane|first=Donovan A|year=2011|title=Are there differences in the organizational structure and pedagogical approach of virtual and brick-and-mortar schools?|url=|journal=The Journal of Educators Online|volume=8 |issue=1|pages=1–43|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Participation and interaction between participants and instructors involves significant and continuous preparation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Online educators are often members of a larger team consisting of instructional and graphic designers and information technology specialists; being open to becoming a member of the team will assist in a smooth transition to online teaching.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Expectations of learners to be self-motivated, able to manage their time effectively, contribute to course discussions and have a willingness to teach others is not unlike what is expected in a traditional classroom. The instructor's role is to encourage learners to evaluate and analyze information, then connect the information to course content which may assist in learner success.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; With the potential for learners to feel disconnected from peers within the course, the instructor will need to work to create spaces and encounters which promote socialization. A few recommendations are to create a "student lounge" as an informal space for socialization not related to coursework.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Also, incorporating team projects can help alleviate feelings of isolation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Online instructors should be cognizant of where participants are physically located; when members of the course span two or more time zones, the timing of the course can become problematic.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Initial preparation of an online course is often more time consuming than preparation for the classroom. The material must be prepared and posted, in its entirety, prior to the course start.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In addition to preparation, faculty experienced in online instruction spend about 30% more time on courses conducted online.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The mentoring of novice online educators from those with experience can assist with the transition from classroom to the virtual environment.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Online credentials ==
{{Main|Online credentials for learning}}

Online credentials for learning are digital credentials that are offered in place of traditional paper credentials for a skill or educational achievement. Directly linked to the accelerated development of internet communication technologies, the development of [[digital badge]]s, [[electronic passport]]s and [[massive open online course]]s (MOOCs) have a very direct bearing on our understanding of learning, recognition and levels as they pose a direct challenge to the status quo. It is useful to distinguish between three forms of online credentials: Test-based credentials, online badges, and online certificates.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002428/242887e.pdf|title=Level-setting and recognition of learning outcomes: The use of level descriptors in the twenty-first century|last=Keevy|first=James|last2=Chakroun|first2=Borhene|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100138-3|location=|pages=129–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Paper Project''' is a fusion project that blends art, science, and technology into engaging 2D and 3D experiences.

==About the project==

The Paper Project is a multidimensional art and science project exploring the microscopic structure of paper using a [[Confocal laser scanning microscopy|scanning-laser confocal microscope]]. Created by artist and scientist Charles Kazilek and printer and paper maker Gene Valentine in 1999 the project has been exhibiting works in various formats including 2D and virtual 3D images. The 3D [[anaglyphic]] images make use of inexpensive red-blue [[Anaglyph 3D|3D glasses]] first introduced to movie goers in the 1950s. When wearing 3D glasses, it is as if the viewer has been reduced to the size of a period at the end of a sentence and is able to explore the invisible structure and beauty of paper.

In 2002, the project expanded to dance, collaborating with costume designers Jacqueline Benard and Galina Mihaleva and dance choreographer Jennifer Tsukayama.  The result of the collaboration was ''Paper Interiors: a dance exploration of real and virtual dimensions'' that debuted at the American College Dance Festival. In 2004, Jennifer Tsukayama became a member of the Paper Project and the group created a traveling 3D immersive room based on the earlier dance performance. The first installation of the room was at the Arizona Museum for Youth.

Since its creation, images from the Paper Project have been viewed around the world in museums, science centers, and on the Web. In addition to exhibits the Paper Project has developed educational content that can be used to engage students in art, history, biology, chemistry, and physics.

'''Peggy Feury''' (30 June 1924 — 20 November 1985) (born '''Margaret Feury''') was an actress on Broadway, in films, and on television. She became a highly regarded acting teacher in New York and then in Los Angeles.  Throughout her career, she taught many notable students.

== Education ==
Feury was born in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]].  Her father was Richard Feury; her mother, born in Ireland, was also Margaret Feury; and her younger sister was Elinor Feury.&lt;ref&gt;[https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.3.1/TH-1942-27904-861-17?cc=2000219 1940 U.S. Federal Population Census]&lt;/ref&gt; She graduated from [[Barnard College]], then attended the [[Yale School of Drama]], later studying with [[Lee Strasberg]] at the [[Actors Studio]], and with [[Sanford Meisner]] at the [[Neighborhood Playhouse]].&lt;ref name="Acting Now 202"&gt;Vilga, Edward.

Rutgers University Press (1997) page 202. {{ISBN|9780813524030}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT 112685"/&gt;

While at Yale, Feury met and then married her first husband, playwright [[Louis S. Peterson]].&lt;ref name=GM&gt;Gussow, Mel. [https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/01/arts/louis-peterson-76-playwright-who-opened-doors-for-blacks.html "Louis Peterson, 76, Playwright Who Opened Doors for Blacks"] ''The New York Times''. 1 May 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref| Peterson first came to prominence in 1953 with the production of his play, the coming-of-age tale, ''Take a Giant Step''.  Peterson would go on to write scripts for TV and film.&lt;ref name=GM/&gt;|group=lower-alpha}} Less than a decade later, following their divorce and Feury's remarriage, Peterson's semi-autobiographical play ''Entertain a Ghost'' was produced, chronicling a deteriorating marriage between a fictional playwright and actress with obvious parallels to Peterson and Feury.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Emmanuel Sampath.

Page 350. {{ISBN|9780313322334}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play received from the ''[[Village Voice]]'' a positive and detailed review that expressed the feeling that the production should have run longer. It described it as "a daring and deeply exploratory new play, the best damned failure I've seen in years".&lt;ref&gt;Tallmer, Jerry.

Between 1956 and 1969, the Actors Studio undertook a project to record and archive work that was being done there, including performances of scenes from dramatic literature. These recordings have been archived as part of the University of Wisconsin Digital Collections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi/f/findaid/findaid-idx?c=wiarchives;cc=wiarchives;view=text;rgn=main;didno=uw-whs-audi00339a Actors Studio Recordings, 1956–1969: summary]. University of Wisconsin Digital Collections.&lt;/ref&gt; Feury participated in this project from its inception until her relocation to Los Angeles in December 1968.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi/f/findaid/findaid-idx?c=wiarchives&amp;cc=wiarchives&amp;idno=uw-whs-audi00339a&amp;type=simple&amp;rgn=Entire+Finding+Aid&amp;q1=Feury&amp;Submit=Search University of Wisconsin Digital Collections]&lt;/ref&gt;

Feury appeared in a number of television dramas beginning in the [[Golden Age of Television]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0275443/ IMDb]&lt;/ref&gt; including, in 1961, a significant role she played in “Murder is a Face I Know”, an episode from ''[[Naked City (TV series)|The Naked City]]'', which can be found on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS1igBdVIdE "Murder is a Face I Know"].

In November 1961, an early draft of the first scene of [[Edward Albee]]’s play, ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]]'', was presented on the public television program ''Playwright at Work''. The characters George and Martha – which would later be originated on stage by [[Arthur Hill (actor)|Arthur Hill]] and [[Uta Hagen]], and on screen by [[Richard Burton]] and [[Elizabeth Taylor]] – were portrayed by [[Shepperd Strudwick]] and Feury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=|first1=Otis L|last1=Guernsey, editor|first2=Terence, introduction|last2=McNally|title=Broadway Song &amp; Story: Playwrights / Composers / Lyricists Discuss Their Hits|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_6MqAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22peg+feury%22&amp;dq=%22peg+feury%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BhkaVenrCYGwggSpsYNY&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAw|year=1985|publisher=Dodd, Mead|location=New York|isbn=|page=92|chapter=Author!

On October 2, 1977, Feury appeared in "Iowa," the second season premiere of ''Visions'', [[PBS]]'s [[Peabody Award]]-winning dramatic anthology series; it was also playwright [[Murray Mednick]]'s television debut.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=21xNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0voDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4694%2C661123 "'Visions' Series Begins New Season"]. ''The Lakeland Ledger''. October 2, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; The critical reaction was disappointment,&lt;ref name=JW-IV&gt;Wolcott, James.

"TV: New 'Iowa' Taps Roots Theme". ''The Hartford Courant''. October 1, 1977. "No doubt 'Iowa' is far superior to most TV fare. But 'Visions' isn't to be judged by that sort of pathetic measure. The Peabody-Award-winning series has to be judged by its own very high standards of excellence."&lt;/ref&gt; but the actors fared better, Feury in particular. As the unwilling nursing home resident whose disjointed recollections provide her granddaughter an invaluable connection to her Iowa roots, Feury's portrayal was judged "[b]y far the best acting performance" by ''[[The Hartford Courant]]''.&lt;ref&gt;McNally, Owen. "TV: New 'Iowa' Taps Roots Theme". ''The Hartford Courant''. October 1, 1977. "By far the best acting performance is turned in by Peggy Feury as the grandmother. She makes the old woman's recollections of Iowa credible and displays a fine, irascible edge whenever she comes on strong like a harridan or a Hamlet feigning madness."&lt;/ref&gt; Her performance, as the character veers "from family feeling to suspicion to self-absorbed recollection" – was noted by ''[[The Boston Globe]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Henry 3rd, William A.. "'Iowa' Play Leads Series". ''The Boston Globe''. October 1, 1977. "If, as Yeats once suggested, every play is written for the sake of a single scene, 'Iowa' was written for the tender scene between a sensitive girl recovering from a breakdown and her tough, addled grandmother. The old woman veers from family feeling to suspicion to self-absorbed recollection of her girlhood - recollection from which the granddaughter somehow draws a sense of her own continuity and place. [...] The performances, however, are remarkable, particularly by Carol Fox as the girl and Peggy Feury as the grandmother."&lt;/ref&gt; with ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' citing her "almost effortless grace" and "marvelous ferocity."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Cecil. "Dramas Mark the Greene-ing of Sunday Eve". ''The Los Angeles Times''. September 28, 1977. pp.  "Under Rick Benewitz's direction, it is performed with an almost effortless grace, most memorably in the fury of Peggy Feury. [...] Grandma's not dead; she's been moved to a rest home, where she lives amid other blank-eyed old people waiting for death. She's played with marvelous ferocity by Peggy Feury, a snarling whirlwind of an old woman with an Irish brogue in a wheelchair, hiding the chocolates she lives on under her shawl."&lt;/ref&gt; Critic [[James Wolcott]] writes: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;One scene teems with unruly life: Eileen visits her grandmother (Peggy Feury) in the nursing home, and the grandma's semi-senile outbursts have a crazy, cawing theatricality. "This is a cattle yard," says Feury's crone as the camera stares down the discarded people. "Bellowing, constant bellowing." Another patient – babbling "Operator, operator, operator" – is wheeled across the screen and grandma, like an Alice-in-Wonderland queen, issues a command: "Choke her!" This disreputably funny scene is capped when a nurse happens by and – perfect joke – turns out to be a Lily Tomlin lookalike.&lt;ref name=JW-IV/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1982, Feury appeared as "Colonel Buckholtz," a perfectionist colonel who inspects [[Margaret Houlihan]] and the nurses in "Hey, Look Me Over," the opening episode of [[M*A*S*H (season 11)|M*A*S*H Season 11]].

Feury's film credits include [[Matt Cimber]]'s ''[[The Witch Who Came from the Sea]]'' (1976),&lt;ref name="NYT 112685"/&gt; [[Richard C. Sarafian]]'s ''[[The Next Man]]'' (1976) starring [[Sean Connery]], [[Elia Kazan]]'s [[The Last Tycoon (1976 film)|film]] of ''[[The Last Tycoon]]'' (1976), starring [[Robert De Niro]],&lt;ref name="Acting Now 202"/&gt; [[Carl Reiner]]'s [[All of Me (1984 film)|''All of Me'']] (1984), starring [[Steve Martin]] and [[Lily Tomlin]], [[Ken Russell]]'s [[Crimes of Passion (1984 film)|''Crimes of Passion'']] (1984), and Feury's final screen performance, in ''[[1918 (1985 film)|1918]]'' (1985), written by Horton Foote.&lt;ref name=HF:ALB/&gt;&lt;ref name=HFP&amp;M/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/65/1918/cast "'1918 (1985)': Full Acting Credits". The New York Times.]&lt;/ref&gt;  A brief appearance in [[Donald Shebib]]'s [[Heartaches (film)|''Heartaches'']] (1981) was singled out by [[New York Times]] critic [[Vincent Canby]]: "That very fine actress Peggy Feury appears in a tiny but important scene as the doctor who advises Bonnie about a possible abortion."&lt;ref&gt;Canby, Vincent.

By far Feury's most substantial film role (in terms of both sheer size and importance to a film's narrative) came in a little seen low-budget psychological horror film – John Ballard's ''Friday the 13th: The Orphan'' (1979), based on the short story ''[[Sredni Vashtar]]'' by [[Saki]].&lt;ref&gt;Albright, Brian.

"Eventually I began working with Peggy Feury, of the Loft Studio. I was, at 30, the oldest person in her novice class. For the next couple of years, every day, five days a week, I drove from my house to her studio on La Brea."&lt;/ref&gt; Feury was "a revelation," with "a vast knowledge of playwrights" and "an extraordinary gift for making one feel understood."&lt;ref&gt;Huston, Anjelica.

On the other hand, notes Huston, Feury was "extremely intelligent and mordant, Irish, with certain very visceral preferences", and yet had "a way of commenting on a scene that was never destructive. [Even when] you knew she thought it was pretty terrible, she had a way of translating it positively to actors – her process was very reinforcing, I think."&lt;ref name=RK-SP60/&gt;

Feury was occasionally called upon to coach an individual actor in a role, as she did Michelle Pfeiffer in [[Brian De Palma]]'s ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'' (1983)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/de/palma/blog/index.blog/1432189/stone-others-talk-scarface/ "Stone and Others Talk 'Scarface': Article in December Issue of 'Playboy' Covers the Making of De Palma Classic"]. De Palma a la Mod. December 8, 2011. "[Steven] Bauer says, De Palma 'made Michelle feel like a scared, lonely little girl in a world of men. He did the right thing, but it was hard to watch. That poor girl was always alone, always on edge, very vulnerable, brave but alone in her performance. She lived on the phone with her acting coach Peggy Feury.

"[A]t the end I had begun studying with Peggy Feury who was a studio actress who had come out to the West Coast to found the West Coast chapter of The Studio. She and I were in “All of Me” together, and we just became great friends. And I was sort of possessive of her; I could hire her privately and she would work with me and we became like girlfriends. And then I’d feel so self-conscious and pig-like when I’d see her in class sometimes, because I felt like I was so close to her. And everybody revered her. They adored her."&lt;/ref&gt; The evolution of Tomlin's show formed the basis of a 1986 documentary in which Feury appeared posthumously;&lt;ref&gt;Canby, Vincent.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="63501">'''College and university rankings in the United States''' are rankings of [[Higher education in the United States|US colleges and universities]] ordered by contributing factors which vary depending on the organization performing the ranking. Rankings have most often been conducted by magazines, newspapers, websites, or academics.  In addition to ranking entire institutions, specific programs, departments, and schools can be ranked.  Some rankings consider measures of wealth, research excellence and/or influence, selectivity, student options, eventual success, demographics, and other criteria. There is [[Criticism of college and university rankings (North America)|much debate]] about rankings' interpretation, accuracy, usefulness, and appropriateness. The expanding diversity in rating methodologies and accompanying criticisms of each indicate the lack of consensus in the field.

===''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' College and University rankings===
{{main|U.S. News &amp; World Report Best Colleges Ranking}}
{{summarize|from|U.S. News &amp; World Report Best Colleges Ranking|section=y|brevity=y|date=August 2017}}

The magazine U.S. News &amp; World Report's rankings are based upon information they collect from educational institutions via an annual survey and school websites. It also considers opinion surveys of university faculty and administrators outside the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = | last = | title = America's Best Colleges | publisher = [[U.S. News and World Report]] | year = 2007 | url= https://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/college/rankings/rankindex_brief.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their college rankings were first published in 1983 and have been published in all years thereafter, except 1984.

The US News listings have gained such influence that some Universities have made it a specific goal to reach a particular level in the US News rankings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1917590,00.html Time.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Belmont University president Bob Fisher stated in 2010, "Rising to the Top 5 in U.S. News represents a key element of Belmont’s Vision 2015 plan."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/nashville/stories/2010/08/16/daily12.html Bizjournals.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Clemson University]] made it a public goal to rise to the Top 20 in the US News rankings, and made specific changes, including reducing class size and altering the presentation of teacher salaries, so as to perform better in the statistical analysis by US News.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/06/03/rankings Insidehighered.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  At least one university, [[Arizona State]], has actually tied the university president's pay to an increase in the school's placement in the US News rankings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2007/03/19/usnews Insidehighered.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The following are elements in the 2017 U.S. News rankings of national universities and liberal arts colleges.

* Retention: six-year graduation rate and first-year student retention rate (22.5%)
* Peer assessment: a survey of the institution's academic reputation among presidents, provosts, and admissions deans of other institutions (15%)
* Guidance Counselor assessment: a survey of the institution's reputation among approximately 1,800 high school guidance counselors (7.5%)&lt;!--100 - the other weights--&gt;
* Faculty resources: class size, average faculty salary adjusted for cost of living, student-faculty ratio, proportion of faculty with terminal degrees, proportion of full-time faculty (20%)
* Student selectivity: [[standardized test]] scores of admitted students, proportion of admitted students in upper percentiles of their high school class, and proportion of applicants accepted (12.5%)
* Financial resources: per-student spending on academic support, institutional support, public service, research and student services.  (10%)
* Graduation rate performance: comparison between actual six-year graduation rate and a predicted rate that is determined by entering class and school characteristics.  (7.5%)
* Alumni giving rate (5%)

''U.S. News'' determined the relative weights of these factors and changed them over time. The [[National Opinion Research Center]] reviewed the methodology and stated that the weights "lack any defensible empirical or theoretical basis". The first four of the listed factors account for the great majority of the ''U.S. News'' ranking (80%, according to ''U.S. News's'' 2005 methodology), and the "reputational measure" (which surveys high-level administrators at similar institutions about their perceived quality ranking of each college and university) is especially important to the final ranking (accounting by itself for 25% of the ranking according to the 2005 methodology).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2000/norc.html |title=A review of ''US News'' ranking by NORC |access-date=2011-04-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605162423/http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2000/norc.html |archive-date=2011-06-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--conflicts with the listed weights above--&gt;

A ''New York Times'' article reported that, given the ''U.S. News'' weighting methodology, "it's easy to guess who's going to end up on top: the [[Big Three (colleges)|Big Three]], Harvard, Yale and [[Princeton University|Princeton]] round out the first three essentially every year. When asked how he knew his system was sound, Mel Elfin, the rankings' founder, often answered that he knew it because those three schools always landed on top. When a new lead statistician, Amy Graham, changed the formula in 1999 to one she considered more statistically valid, the [[California Institute of Technology]] jumped to first place. Ms. Graham soon left, and a modified system pushed Princeton back to No. 1 the next year."&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Nicholas (2003): [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/03/education/the-best-the-top-the-most.html "The Best, The Top, The Most"]; The New York Times, August 3, 2003, Education Life Supplement, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 study by the [[University of Michigan]] found that university rankings in the United States significantly affect institutions' applications and admissions.&lt;ref name="umich.edu"&gt;Bowman, Nicholas and Michael Bastedo,"Getting on the Front Page: Organizational Reputation, Status Signals, and the Impact of U.S. News &amp; World Report Rankings on Student Decisions." [http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bastedo/papers/BowmanBastedo.ResHE2009.pdf personal.umich.edu] Retrieved June 29, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
The research analyzed the effects of the U.S. News &amp; World Report rankings, showing a lasting effect on college applications and admissions by students in the top 10% of their class.&lt;ref name="umich.edu"/&gt; In addition, they found that rankings influence survey assessments of reputation by college presidents at peer institutions, such that rankings and reputation are becoming much more similar over time.&lt;ref name="umich2.edu"&gt;Bastedo, Michael N. and Nicholas A. Bowman. "The U.S. News &amp; World Report College Rankings: Modeling Institutional Effects on Organizational Reputation." [http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bastedo/papers/BastedoBowman.AJE2010.pdf personal.umich.edu] Retrieved June 29, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 study published in ''Research in Higher Education'' removed the mystique of the ''U.S. News'' ranking process by producing a ranking model that faithfully recreated ''U.S. News'' outcomes and quantified the inherent “noise” in the rankings for all nationally ranked universities. The model developed provided detailed insight into the ''U.S. News'' ranking process. It allowed the impact of changes to ''U.S. News'' subfactors to be studied when variation between universities and within subfactors was present. Numerous simulations were run using this model to understand the amount of change required for a university to improve its rank or move into the top 20. Results show that for a university ranked in the mid-30s it would take a significant amount of additional resources, directed in a very focused way, to become a top-ranked national university, and that rank changes of up to +/- 4 points should be considered “noise”.&lt;ref&gt;Gnolek et al. (2014): [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11162-014-9336-9?sa_campaign=email/event/articleAuthor/onlineFirst "Modeling Change and Variation in U.S. News &amp; World Report College Rankings: What would it really take to be in the Top 20?"]; Research In Higher Education, May 18, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Economist'''s "Best Colleges. The Value of University"===
''[[The Economist (magazine)|The Economist]]'''s college rankings [[The Economist Magazine's List of America's Best Colleges]] focuses on comparable economical advantages defined as 'the economic value of a university is equal to the gap between how much its students subsequently earn, and how much they might have made had they studied elsewhere'. Based on set of strict criteria sourced from U.S. Department of Education ('College Scorecard") with relevant 'expected earnings' and multiple statistics applied in calculation of 'median earnings' conclusive evaluation method has been applied to run the scorecard's earnings data through a multiple regression analysis, a common method of measuring the relationships between variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Economist |url=https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21677231-new-federal-data-reveal-which-colleges-do-most-their-graduates-pay-packets-they-are|title=The Economist:  List of America's Best Colleges |publisher=The Economist |date=2015 |accessdate=October 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Forbes'' college rankings===
In 2008, [[Forbes|Forbes.com]] began publishing an annual list of "America's Best Colleges".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = America's Top Colleges|publisher = Forbes|url = https://www.forbes.com/top-colleges/|accessdate = 29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Post-graduate success''' (self-reported salaries of alumni from [[PayScale]], and data from the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]]) constitutes 35% of the score. '''Student debt loads''' constitute 20% of the score. '''Student experience''' ([[retention rate]]s reported by the Department of Education, and data from [[Niche (company)|Niche]]) constitutes 20% of the score. '''Graduation rates''' constitute 12.5% of the score. '''Academic success''' (using both the percentage of a school's student body that goes on to obtain doctorate degrees, and those students who have won one of a diverse array of prestigious academic awards) constitutes 12.5%. Public [[reputation]] is not considered, which causes some colleges to score lower than in other lists. A three-year [[moving average]] is used to smooth out the scoring. The 2018 ranking puts Harvard University at the top, followed by Yale University, Stanford University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Princeton University.

===Revealed Preference Rankings===
Avery ''et al.'' pioneered the use of [[choice modelling]] to rank colleges. Their methodology used a statistical analysis of the decisions of 3,240 students who applied to college in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ssrn=601105 |title=A Revealed Preference Ranking of U.S. Colleges and Universities |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; MyChances.net adopted a similar approach starting in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://college.mychances.net/college-rankings.php?thisYear=2009&amp;thisCategory=National |title=2009–2010 College Rankings: National Universities |format= |work= |accessdate=2010-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that its method is based on this approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mychances.net/blog/2009/07/10/new-college-rankings/ |title=New College Rankings |format= |work= |accessdate=2010-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study analysed students admitted to multiple colleges. The college they attended became the winner, and the others became the losers. An [[Elo rating system]] was used to assign points based on each win or loss, and the colleges were ranked based on their Elo points. A useful consequence of the use of Elo points is that they can be used to estimate the frequency with which students, upon being admitted to two schools, will choose one over the other. The most recent preference ranking by Parchment placed MIT at the top, followed by Williams, Stanford, US Air Force Academy, and Claremont McKenna College.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Parchment Rankings |url=http://www.parchment.com/c/college/college-rankings.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social Mobility Index (SMI) rankings===
The SMI rankings are a collaborative publication from CollegeNet and PayScale.  The rankings aim to provide a measure of the extent to which colleges provide upward economic mobility to those that attend.  The rankings were created in response to the finding in Science magazine which showed that among developed nations, the United States now provides the least economic opportunity and mobility for its citizens.  The rankings were also created to combat the rising costs of tuition, much of which is attributed to the efforts of some colleges to increase their own fame and wealth in ways that increase their rank in media periodicals that put an emphasis on such measures. In 2014, according to the SMI, the top five colleges are Montana Tech, Rowan University, Florida A&amp;M, Cal Poly Pomona, and Cal State Northridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://socialmobilityindex.org/ |title=Social Mobility Index |publisher=CollegeNet and Payscale |accessdate=October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Top American Research Universities===
[[Center for Measuring University Performance|The Center for Measuring University Performance]] has ranked American research universities in the Top American Research Universities since 2000. The methodology is based on data such as research publications, citations, recognitions and funding, as well as undergraduate quality such as SAT scores. The information used can be found in publicly accessible materials, reducing possibilities for manipulation. The methodology is generally consistent from year to year and changes are explained in the publication along with references from other studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mup.asu.edu/research.html | title=The Top American Research Universities | publisher=The Center for Measuring University Performance | accessdate=2009-08-23 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617210050/http://mup.asu.edu/research.html | archivedate=2012-06-17 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TrendTopper MediaBuzz College Guide===
[[TrendTopper MediaBuzz College Guide]] is an American-college guide based on what it calls "Internet brand equity" based on data collected from the Internet and global media sources. It ranks the Top 300 United States colleges and universities.  The guide includes specialty and for profit schools including Art, Business, Design, Music, and Online Education.  The TrendTopper MediaBuzz College Rankings are produced twice a year by the [[Global Language Monitor]] of [[Austin]], [[Texas]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

[[Time Magazine]] described internet brand equity as "a measure of who's talking about you online, based on Internet data, social media, blogs and the top 75,000 print and electronic media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/01/05/the-most-buzzed-about-university-wisconsin/ The Most Buzzed-About University?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/12/30/us-universities-topbrands-idUSTRE6BT41J20101230/ Harvard, Yale Beaten]&lt;/ref&gt;

GLM ranks the schools "according to their online presence -- or internet brand equity ... By focusing on online presence, the Monitor hopes to avoid the biases that characterize other rankings, which commonly rely on the opinions of university officials and college counselors rather than that of the greater public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/10/buzzworthy-schools-which-_n_806809.html#s221586&amp;title=University_of_WisconsinMadison/ The Most Buzz Worthy Schools]&lt;/ref&gt;" GLM believes the rankings provide an up-to-date perspective on which schools have the most popular brand.  The resulting rankings gauge the relative value of the various institutions and how they change over time.

The Global Language Monitor publishes other lists relating to the English language including: the [[TrendTopper MediaBuzz College Guide]] rankings of the top 425 U.S. colleges and universities according to their internet [[brand equity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.languagemonitor.com/category/top-colleges/# |title=Trendtopper MediaBuzz 2016 University Rankings |access-date=2016-03-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811175548/http://www.languagemonitor.com/category/top-colleges/# |archive-date=2014-08-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These factors are normalized for the university student undergraduate population using standard statistical practices. From this data the difficulty of the curriculum, intelligence, competitiveness, faculty recognition and research prowess are determined. The universities are ranked by these individual categories. The relative overall rank of the student population and academic quality of the university is derived from the average of the rankings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://universitybenchmarks.com UniversityBenchmarks 2016 University Academic Rankings]&lt;/ref&gt;

===University Entrepreneur Report===
The University Entrepreneur Report lists the top six American universities in terms of venture capital investments in businesses started by a university's alumni.  According to a CB Insights study of deals from 2007-2011, Stanford alumni secured 203 venture capital or [[angel investor|angel]] investments, totaling $4.1 billion, more than any other university studied.  Harvard was second with 112 deals, totaling $3.8 billion.  Excluding the Facebook deal, Harvard alumni secured $1.8 billion, less than half of Stanford's total. UC Berkeley, NYU, UPenn and MIT each brought in over $1.0 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B0UT39PD5h2OVzBfMjJqWjJRMnM/preview?pli=1] The University Entrepreneur Report

===The Wall Street Journal / Times Higher Education College Rankings===
The [[Wall Street Journal]] and Times Higher Education in late 2016 released their inaugural 2017 ranking of U.S. colleges and universities. It is a ranking of US colleges and universities that puts student success and learning—based on 100,000 current student voices—at its heart. The ranking includes clear performance indicators designed to answer the questions that matter the most to students and their families when making one of the most important decisions of their lives – who to trust with their education:  Does the college have sufficient resources to teach me properly? Will I be engaged, and challenged, by my teacher and classmates? Does the college have a good academic reputation? What type of campus community is there? How likely am I to graduate, pay off my loans and get a good job? The ranking includes the results of the US Student Survey, which examines a range of key issues including students’ engagement with their studies, their interaction with their teachers and their satisfaction with their experience. The rankings adopt a balanced scorecard approach, with 15 individual performance indicators combining to create an overall score that reflects the broad strength of the institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/wall-street-journal-times-higher-education-college-rankings-methodology |title=Methodology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Washington Monthly'' national universities rankings===
''[[The Washington Monthly]]'s '' "National Universities Rankings", most recently published in 2016, began as a research report in 2005, with rankings appearing in the September 2006 issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2006/0609.collegeguide.html "The ''Washington Monthly's'' Annual College Guide"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070718083449/http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2006/0609.collegeguide.html |date=2007-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It ranks colleges on academic quality, faculty, and alumni outcome. It also offers American university and college rankings based upon "contribution to the public good in numerous categories.

The following are elements in the Washington Monthly rankings.
* Academic quality: a survey of the institution's academic structure, and general program
* Retention: first year retention rate, and graduation rate of the institutions
* Faculty resources: average class size, faculty degree level, student-faculty ratio, and proportion of full-time faculty
* Social Mobility: recruiting and graduating low-income students
* Research: producing cutting-edge scholarship and [[Thesis|PhD]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s
* Service: encouraging students to give something back to their country

==="What will they Learn?" Report - American Council of Trustees and Alumni===
In 2009, the [[American Council of Trustees and Alumni]] (ACTA) began grading colleges and universities based on the strength of their general education requirements. In ACTA's annual [[What Will They Learn?]] report, colleges and universities are assigned a letter grade from "A" to "F"  based on how many of seven subjects are required of students. The seven subjects are composition, mathematics, foreign language, science, economics, literature and American government or history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whatwilltheylearn.com/criteria |title= What Will They Learn? |author= ACTA |accessdate=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011-2012 edition of [[What Will They Learn?]] graded 1,007 institutions.&lt;ref name=aquinas&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thomasaquinas.edu/news/acta-gives-college-highest-possible-academic-ranking|title=ACTA Gives College Highest Possible Academic Ranking|publisher=[[Thomas Aquinas College]]|date=September 1, 2011|accessdate=May 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2011-2012 edition, 19 schools received an "A" grade for requiring at least six of the subjects the study evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204394804577010080547122646|title=What's Your Kid Getting From College?  |author=McGurn, William|date=November 1, 2011 |publisher=[[Wall Street Journal]]

===Other rankings===
Other rankings include the ''Fiske Guide to Colleges'' and ''[[College Prowler]]'', now called Niche (see above). Many specialized rankings are available in guidebooks, considering individual student interests, fields of study, geographical location, [[Student financial aid (United States)|financial aid]] and affordability.  In addition to best overall colleges ranking shown above, [[Niche (company)|Niche]] also publishes dozens of specialized rankings such as Best Academics, Best Campus Food, Most Conservative Colleges, and Best Technology.

Among the rankings dealing with individual fields of study is the [[Philosophical Gourmet Report]] or "Leiter Report",&lt;ref&gt;Founded by [[Brian Leiter]] then of the [[University of Texas at Austin]], {{As of|2010|alt=now}} [[University of Chicago]]&lt;/ref&gt; a ranking of [[philosophy]] departments. This report has attracted criticism from different viewpoints. Notably, practitioners of [[continental philosophy]], who perceive the Leiter report as unfair to their field, have compiled alternative rankings.

The [[Gourman Report]], last published in 1996, ranked the quality of undergraduate majors and graduate programs.

The Higher Education Rankings, developed and managed by the New York City consulting company IV Research, is a commercial product that provides both general rankings as well as personalized rankings based on a complicated assessment of 6 criteria and 30 indicators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://herank.com/?q=node/18 |title=Overview &amp; Methodology |author=IVRI |accessdate=10 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905225316/http://herank.com/?q=node%2F18# |archive-date=2015-09-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
{{Main|Criticism of college and university rankings (North America)}}

American college and university ranking systems have drawn criticism from within and outside higher education in [[Canada]] and the United States. Institutions that have objected include [[Reed College]], [[Alma College]], [[Mount Holyoke College]], [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]], [[Earlham College]], [[MIT]], [[Stanford University]], [[University of Western Ontario]], and [[Queen's University]].

Critics charged that ''U.S. News'' intentionally changed its methodology every year so that the rankings change and they can sell more magazines. A ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' article argues that "almost all of ''US News'' factors are redundant and can be boiled down to one characteristic: the size of the college or university's endowment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/09/03/ED28864.DTL&amp;hw=rojstaczer&amp;sn=001&amp;sc=1000 | title=College rankings are mostly about money | publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |date=2001-09-03 | first=Stuart | last=Rojstaczer | accessdate = 2006-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some higher education experts, like Kevin Carey of Education Sector, have argued that ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'''s college rankings system is merely a list of criteria that mirrors the superficial characteristics of elite colleges and universities. According to Carey, "[The] ''U.S. News'' ranking system is deeply flawed. Instead of focusing on the fundamental issues of how well colleges and universities educate their students and how well they prepare them to be successful after college, the magazine's rankings are almost entirely a function of three factors: fame, wealth, and exclusivity." He suggested more important characteristics are how well students are learning and how likely students are to earn a degree.&lt;ref name="educationsector.org"&gt;Carey, Kevin. "College Rankings Reformed". [http://www.educationsector.org/usr_doc/CollegeRankingsReformed.pdf educationsector.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090823184901/http://www.educationsector.org/usr_doc/CollegeRankingsReformed.pdf |date=2009-08-23 }} Retrieved July 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2007 movement===
{{Main|Criticism of college and university rankings (2007 United States)}}
On 19 June 2007, during the annual meeting of the [[Annapolis Group]], members discussed [[Criticism of college and university rankings (2007 United States)#Presidents Letter|a letter to college presidents]] asking them not to participate in the "reputation survey" section of the ''U.S. News'' survey (this section comprises 25% of the ranking). As a result, "a majority of the approximately 80 presidents at the meeting said that they did not intend to participate in the U.S. News reputational rankings in the future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first =Scott  | last =Jaschik | title =More Momentum Against ‘U.S. News’|publisher = [[Inside Higher Ed]] | date = 20 June 2007 | url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2007/06/20/usnews}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the decision to fill out the reputational survey was left to each individual college.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web | first = | last =| title =Annapolis group statement on rankings and ratings |publisher = [[Annapolis Group]] | date = 19 June 2007 | url= http://www.collegenews.org/x7131.xml}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement stated that its members "have agreed to participate in the development of an alternative common format that presents information about their colleges for students and their families to use in the college search process."&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; This database was outlined and developed in conjunction with higher education organizations including the''[[National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities]]'' and the ''[[Council of Independent Colleges]].''

''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' editor Robert Morse issued a response on 22 June 2007, stating:&lt;blockquote&gt;"in terms of the peer assessment survey, we at ''U.S. News'' firmly believe the survey has significant value because it allows us to measure the "intangibles" of a college that we can't measure through [[Statistics|statistical data]]. Plus, the [[reputation]] of a school can help get that all-important first job and plays a key part in which grad school someone will be able to get into. The peer survey is by nature [[Subjectivity|subjective]], but the technique of asking industry leaders to rate their competitors is a commonly accepted practice. The results from the peer survey also can act to level the playing field between [[Private university|private]] and [[Public university|public colleges]]."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web| first =Robert| last =Morse| title =About the Annapolis Group's Statement| publisher =[[U.S. News and World Report]]| date =22 June 2007| url =https://www.usnews.com/blogs/college-rankings-blog/2007/6/22/about-the-annapolis-groups-statement.html#read_more| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070702061309/http://www.usnews.com/blogs/college-rankings-blog/2007/6/22/about-the-annapolis-groups-statement.html#read_more| archivedate =2 July 2007| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In reference to the alternative database discussed by the Annapolis Group, Morse argued:&lt;blockquote&gt;"It's important to point out that the Annapolis Group's stated goal of presenting college data in a common format has been tried before [...] ''U.S. News'' has been supplying this exact college information for many years already. And it appears that NAICU will be doing it with significantly less comparability and functionality.''U.S. News'' first collects all these data (using an agreed-upon set of definitions from the Common Data Set). Then we post the data on our website in easily accessible, comparable tables. In other words, the Annapolis Group and the others in the NAICU initiative actually are following the lead of ''U.S. News''."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1996, according to [[Gerhard Casper]], then-president of [[Stanford University]], ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' changed its formula to calculated financial resources:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Knowing that universities—and, in most cases, the statistics they submit—change little from one year to the next, I can only conclude that what are changing are the formulas the magazine's number massagers employ. And, indeed, there is marked evidence of that this year. In the category "Faculty resources," even though few of us had significant changes in our faculty or student numbers, our class sizes, or our finances, the rankings' producers created a mad scramble in rank order [...data...].  Then there is "Financial resources," where Stanford dropped from #6 to #9, Harvard from #5 to #7. Our resources did not fall; did other institutions' rise so sharply?  I infer that, in each case, the formulas were simply changed, with notification to no one, not even your readers, who are left to assume that some schools have suddenly soared, others precipitously plummeted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/dept/pres-provost/president/speeches/961206gcfallow.html |title=Criticism of College Rankings – September 23, 1996 |publisher=Stanford.edu |date=1996-09-23|accessdate=2010-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Known for his [[Lewis and Clark Expedition|Lewis and Clark]] studies, he is the author of ''In Full View.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=His colorful past helps author track Lewis and Clark |author=Dean Baker |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-23219983.html |newspaper=[[The Columbian]] |date=December 6, 2002 |accessdate=April 27, 2012|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; After careful study of the expedition's journals and of the geography of the [[Columbia River]] [[estuary]], Ziak discovered the previously unknown fact that from November 7, 1805 to December 6, the Lewis and Clark expedition stayed in what is now [[Pacific County]], along the [[Long Beach Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Long Beach is discovering its historic place along the Lewis and Clark trail |author=Jon Hahn |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-92558776.html |newspaper=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] |date=August 30, 2001 |accessdate=April 27, 2012|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=On the money trail 200 years later hoping to reap benefits, Long Beach peninsula plays up ties to Lewis and Clark |author=Claudia Rowe |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-112866543.html |newspaper=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] |date=February 2, 2004 |accessdate=April 27, 2012|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; This finding took six years for Ziak to piece together, using the comments in the expedition's journals to find the locations the explorers stopped at on their trip. A controversy arose between Oregon, long considered the end of the expedition, and Washington's historians over Ziak's findings, with many historians in Washington and elsewhere supporting his discovery and many in Oregon opposing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Controversy blurs path of Lewis, Clark |author=Thomas W.

In addition, that year, [[United States House of Representatives|US Representative]] [[Brian Baird]] had an amendment passed that changed the "federal designation of the Lewis and CLark National Historic Trail as ending not in Oregon but in Oregon and Washington."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Dollars, pride at stake in Lewis and Clark history debate |author=[[Staff writer]] |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HgEgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lhMFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6291,4642322&amp;dq=rex-ziak&amp;hl=en |newspaper=[[Associated Press]] |date=March 15, 2000 |accessdate=April 27, 2012|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next year he published a fold-out map and guide to the route taken by the expedition.&lt;ref&gt;''Lewis and Clark: Down and Up the Columbia River'' (Moffitt House Press, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

As a documentarian and cinematographer, his work under assignment from [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC Television]] received an [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] in 1993 for cinematography in the documentary ''Tall Ship: High Sea Adventure''. He was also involved in the filming of the 2003 [[Discovery Channel]] documentary, ''Marine Corps Survival School'', where Ziak had to film at "high altitudes and in low temperatures" in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rex on ice: Local cinematographer's latest adventure airs Friday |author=Nancy Butterfield |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CKOR&amp;p_multi=CKOB&amp;p_theme=ckor&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=11620D132D4C40A0&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |newspaper=Chinook Observer |date=November 6, 2002 |accessdate=April 27, 2012|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a local activist and regional historian, he has served as a consultant to the City of [[Long Beach, Washington|Long Beach]] and as a board member of the Pacific County Friends of Lewis and Clark.

The '''School Without Walls''' ('''SWOW''') was a [[public alternative school]] in [[Canberra]], the capital of Australia, which operated from 1974 to 1997.

In 1973, a group of students, teachers and parents voluntarily met to establish the school to cater for educational needs they considered were not being met by the mainstream public education system in the Australian Capital Territory.&lt;ref name="review"&gt;{{cite web|title=Report on the inquiry into the implications of the proposed restructure of the School without Walls (SWOW) for the alternative education needs of secondary students in the ACT.|url=http://www.parliament.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/378602/Rpt3SWOW.pdf|publisher=Government of the Australian Capital Territory|accessdate=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school's original location was on Childers Street within the campus of the [[Australian National University]], where the meetings to establish the school were held. Later in 1974, the school relocated to what is now St Patrick’s Church in Braddon, which had previously housed the Catholic schools St Patrick's School and St Mary's School–Our Lady of Mercy. In 1980, the school moved to what was formerly the infants building at Ainslie School in Braddon (now the Ainslie Arts Centre), where it was co-located with the [[Questacon]] science centre.&lt;ref name="review" /&gt;

In 1996, the ACT Education Department conducted a review which recommended the School Without Walls be restructured, and in 1997, SWOW was relocated and merged into [[Dickson College]].&lt;ref name="hansard"&gt;{{cite web|title=Report on School Without Walls – Government Response|url=http://www.hansard.act.gov.au/hansard/1997/week09/2900.htm|website=Legislative Assembly Hansard|publisher=ACT Legislative Assembly|accessdate=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''secondary school''' is both an organization that provides [[secondary education]] and the building where this takes place. Some secondary schools can provide both '''lower secondary education''' and '''upper secondary education''' (levels 2 and 3 of the [[ISCED]] scale), but these can also be provided in separate schools, as in the American middle school- [[High school (North America)| high school system]].

Secondary schools typically follow on from [[primary schools]] and lead into vocational and tertiary education. Attendance is [[compulsory education|compulsory]] in most countries for students between the ages of 11 and 16.  The [[#Names for secondary schools by country|organisations, buildings, and terminology]] are more or less unique in each country.&lt;ref name=ISCED&gt;{{cite web|title=International Standard Classification of EducationI S C E D 1997|url=http://www.unesco.org/education/information/nfsunesco/doc/isced_1997.htm|website=www.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Iwamoto|first1=Wataru|title=Towards a Convergence of Knowledge Acquisition and Skills Development|url=http://www.uis.unesco.org/Education/Documents/isced-2011-en.pdf|website=uis.unesco.org|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=11 March 2017|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology: descriptions of cohorts==
Within the English speaking world, there are three widely used systems to describe the age of the child. The first is the 'equivalent ages', then countries that base their education systems on the 'English model' use one of two methods to identify the year group, while countries that base their systems on the 'American [[K-12]] model' refer to their year groups as 'grades'. This terminology extends into research literature. Below is a convenient comparison &lt;ref name=ward&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ward|first1=Ken|title=British and American Systems (Grades)|url=https://trans4mind.com/personal_development/writing/Readability_software/briishAmericanComparison.htm|website=trans4mind.com|accessdate=30 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical framework==
[[File:Gymnázium Grösslingová.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|right|High school in [[Bratislava]], [[Slovakia]] ([[Gamča]])]]
School building design does not happen in isolation. The building (or school campus) needs to accommodate:
* Curriculum content
* Teaching methods
* Costs
* Education within the political framework
* Use of school building (also in the community setting)
* Constraints imposed by the site
* Design philosophy
Each country will have  a different education system and priorities.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Liew Kok-Pun|first1=Michael|title=Design of secondary schools:Singapore a case study|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0004/000443/044397EB.pdf|website=Educational Building reports|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=3 April 2017|page=37|date=1981|location=Voume 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Schools need to accommodate students, staff, storage, mechanical and electrical systems, storage,  support staff, ancillary staff and administration. The number of rooms required can be determined from the predicted roll of the school and the area needed.

According to standards used in the United Kingdom, a general classroom for 30 students needs to be 55&amp;nbsp;m², or more generously 62&amp;nbsp;m². A general art room for 30 students needs to be 83&amp;nbsp;m², but 104&amp;nbsp;m² for 3D textile work. A drama studio or a specialist science laboratory for 30 needs to be 90&amp;nbsp;m². Examples are given on how this can be configured for a 1,200 place secondary (practical specialism).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baseline designs: 1,200 place secondary (practical specialism) - GOV.UK|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/baseline-designs-1120-place-secondary-practical-specialism|website=www.gov.uk|publisher=GOV.UK|accessdate=4 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1,850 place secondary school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baseline design: 1,850 place secondary school - GOV.UK|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/baseline-design-1850-place-secondary-school|website=www.gov.uk|publisher=gov.uk|accessdate=4 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Building design specifications ==
[[File:First school.jpg|thumb|The first taxpayer-funded public school in the United States was in Dedham.]]
The building providing the education has to fulfil the needs of: The students, the teachers, the non-teaching support staff, the administrators and the community. It has to meet general government building guidelines, health requirements, minimal functional requirements for classrooms, toilets and showers, electricity and services, preparation and storage of textbooks and basic teaching aids.
&lt;ref name=za&gt;{{cite web|title=Guidelines relating to planning for public school infrastructure|url=http://www.education.gov.za/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=cWhHzzzCo1w%3D&amp;tabid=93&amp;mid=2598|accessdate=3 April 2017|date=2012|publisher=Department of Basic Education, Republic of South Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An optimum secondary school will meet the minimum conditions and will have:

* adequately-sized classrooms;
* specialised teaching spaces;
* a staff preparation room;
* an administration block;
* multipurpose classrooms;
* a general purpose school hall;
* laboratories for science, technology, mathematics and life sciences, as may be required;
* adequate equipment;
* a library or library stocks that are regularly renewed; and
* computer rooms or media centres.&lt;ref name=za/&gt;

Government accountants having read the advice then publish minimum guidelines on schools. These  enable environmental modelling and  establishing building costs. Future design plans are audited to ensure that these standards are met but not exceeded.  Government ministries continue to press for the 'minimum' space and cost standards to be reduced.

The UK government published this downwardly revised space formula in 2014. It said the floor area should be 1050m² (+ 350m² if there is a sixth form) + 6.3m²/pupil place for 11- to 16-year-olds + 7m²/pupil place for post-16s. The external finishes were to be downgraded to meet a build cost of £1113/m².

==Secondary schools by country==
{{main|List of secondary education systems by country}}
A '''secondary school''' locally may be called  '''high school''' or '''senior high school'''. In some countries there are two phases to secondary education (ISCED 2) and (ISCED 3), here the '''junior high school''', intermediate school, lower secondary school, or middle school occurs between the [[primary school]] (ISCED 1) and high school.

'''Taking Children Seriously''' ('''TCS''') is a [[parenting]] movement and [[Philosophy of education|educational philosophy]] whose central idea is that it is possible and desirable to raise and educate children without either doing anything to them against their [[Will (philosophy)|will]], or making them do anything against their will.

==Overview==
It was founded in 1994 as an on-line mailing-list by the [[libertarians]] Sarah Fitz-Claridge and [[David Deutsch]]. Deutsch is also a theoretical [[physicist]] at [[Oxford University]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.takingchildrenseriously.com/node/136 Origins of TCS.]"&lt;/ref&gt;

TCS begins with the observation that most traditional interactions between adults and youth are based on [[coercion]]. The TCS model of [[parenting]] and [[education]] rejects this coercion as infringing on the will of the child, and also rejects parental or educator "self-sacrifice" as infringing on the will of the adult. TCS advocates that parents and children work to find a common preference, a solution all parties genuinely prefer to all other candidate solutions they can think of.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.takingchildrenseriously.com/common_preferences_and_non_coercion Taking Children Seriously common preferences and non-coercion.]"&lt;/ref&gt;

The TCS philosophy was inspired by the [[epistemology]] of [[Karl Popper]]. Popper was a professional educator himself before he started to do philosophy. In fact, philosophy was only a second option for him at that time, to be able to emigrate to escape the imminent [[Anschluss]]. He was active in the ''Wiener Schulreform'' (Vienna school reform) movement,&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl R. Popper]] (1925) "Über die Stellung des Lehrers zu Schule und Schüler," ''Schulreform'' '''4'''(4): 204–208.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Popper, K. R. (1927) "Zur Philosophie des Heimatgedankens," ''Die Quelle'' '''77'''(10): 899–908.&lt;/ref&gt; and there are connections between the [[psychology of learning]], on which he did his doctoral thesis,&lt;ref&gt;Popper, K. R. (1928) ''Zur Methodenfrage der Denkpsychologie''. Wien (unpublished dissertation).&lt;/ref&gt; and his philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[[William W. Bartley]] (1970) "Die österreichische Schulreform als die Wiege der modernen Philosophie" in Gerhard Szcesny, ed., ''Club Voltaire IV''. Hamburg: 360. {{ISBN|3-499-65086-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as a philosopher, he did not advocate any concrete [[pedagogy]], although he had some general views on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;Champion, Rafe (1987) "[http://www.the-rathouse.com/RC_PopperEdu.html Popper on Education.]"&lt;/ref&gt; TCS views Popper's epistemology, as did Popper, as a universal theory of how [[knowledge]] grows, and tries to work out its profound implications for [[Philosophy of education|educational theory]].

'''The Architect and his Office''' was a landmark report about the state of the British architectural profession in the early 1960s. It was commissioned by the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] in 1960 and the report was published in February 1962 with an introduction by [[William Holford, Baron Holford|William Holford]], then President of the Institute. Running to more than 250 pages, the report examined architectural education, fees and salaries, and management and technical competence. It was based on extensive fieldwork including a questionnaire survey and visits to nearly 70 architects' offices of various kinds. Funding of slightly more than £11,000 was provided for the study by the [[Leverhulme Trust]]. 

According to [[Frank Duffy (architect)|Frank Duffy]], in his book ''Architectural Knowledge: the Idea of a Profession'', the study stands as one of the best studies of a profession ever carried out anywhere in the world (page 173). Duffy considers that the study did much to reform architectural practices in Britain, particularly by contributing to the development of the RIBA Plan of Work, a set of discrete stages of the architect's work from inception to completion. As well as each stage being precisely described, the stages also had a precise fraction of the total architect's fee associated with them. However, as Duffy also comments, the identification of the usual work pattern as 'normal services' also implied that many activities known as 'other services' (management, surveying, engineering) lay outside the work of the architect, and architects lost market share as a consequence of such exclusivity (page 179).

'''The Gardeners of America/Men's Garden Clubs of America''' ('''TGOA/MGCA''') is a national organization with 31 affiliated [[garden club]]s located in 14 states (2018) across the United States. The organization is also known as '''Gardeners of America''' (TGOA) or '''Men’s Garden Clubs of America''' (MGCA). It has its headquarters in [[Johnston, Iowa]], a  business suburb of [[Des Moines]].  It is a non-profit organization incorporated in the state of [[Illinois]], and registered with the [[IRS]] as a [[501(c)3]] non-profit group.  Most clubs include men and women members,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goupstate.com/article/20031104/NEWS/311040323 Spartanburg Herald-Journal, ''Men's Garden Clubs leader likes what she sees'', November 4, 2003.] Retrieved 4/15/2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and concentrate on [[gardening]] education (for members and nonmembers), and community [[beautification]] and enhancement.  At one time the organization had about 10,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;Pittman, E. Henry. ''And the Trees Remain''. The Spartanburg Men's Garden Club, 2010, {{ISBN|978-0-615-38818-2}}, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Men's Garden Clubs of America organization was founded in 1932, and grew rapidly as a unique organization of male gardeners.  By 1993 the organization had grown greatly, and the bylaws were changed.  The organization became The Gardeners of America with two divisions: The Gardeners of America and Men’s Garden Clubs of America.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[http://www.tgoa-mgca.org/History.htm More on organization history.]&lt;/ref&gt;  While local clubs may feel more closely affiliated with one division, all are members of '''TGOA/MGCA'''. Today many clubs include both men and women, although some all-male clubs still exist.

== Objective ==
The mission statement of TGOA/MGCA as stated on the organization website is

&lt;blockquote&gt;The mission of TGOA/MGCA is to promote gardening education and related environmental issues to its membership and the gardening public through charitable, educational and scientific means.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[http://www.tgoa-mgca.org/MissionStatement.htm The mission statement and list of organization objectives.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It works towards this objective by providing activities that help member clubs develop and publicize new or improved gardening techniques. People living in a location without local garden clubs can become a member-at-large&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[http://www.tgoa-mgca.org/MembersatLarge.htm Member-at-large membership.]&lt;/ref&gt; and participate in TGOA/MGCA programs.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[http://www.tgoa-mgca.org/Benefits.htm A list of national programs.]&lt;/ref&gt;  TGOA/MGCA operates in partnership with the [[American Horticultural Society]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ahs.org/horticulture_internet_community/garden_clubs.htm American Horticultural Society.] Retrieved 4/15/2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and optional membership in AHS includes the publication [http://www.ahs.org/publications/the_american_gardener/  The American Gardener], which cites TGOA/MGCA activities.

TGOA/MGCA is listed as a gardening resource on various websites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dir.gardenweb.com/directory/tgoamgc1/ iVillage GardenWeb.] Retrieved 4/15/2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hfrr.ksu.edu/p.aspx?tabid=897 Kansas State University Horticulture Forestry and Recreation Resources.] Retrieved 4/15/2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== National programs ==
In addition to the programs and projects of local garden clubs, TGOA/MGCA sponsors the following national programs.

* Gardening From The Heart&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[http://www.tgoa-mgca.org/GFTH.htm The Gardening From The Heart program.]&lt;/ref&gt; provides community services for projects that benefit disadvantaged and aging gardeners.
* Big Pumpkin, Giant Sunflower, and Container Garden Contests encourages kids to grow plants.
* Youth Gardening provides national funding for gardening projects that engage youth.
* Scholarships&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[http://www.tgoa-mgca.org/Scholarships.htm The Scholarship program.]&lt;/ref&gt; of $1,000 are awarded annually to horticulture students based on local club applications.
* Photography Contest&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[http://www.tgoa-mgca.org/PhotoCompet.htm The Photography Contest program.]&lt;/ref&gt; rewards members by publishing their photographs in the Gardener's Calendar, and by displaying them on the Internet.  They are shown during  presentations at each year’s national convention.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[http://www.tgoa-mgca.org/PhotoAlbum.htm Past winning plant and landscape photographs.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Gardener's Calendar is published annually using photographs from the Photography Contest.  Many clubs use the calendar for fundraising, or present it as a speaker gift or other award.
* Website www.TGOA-MGCA.org provides up-to-date information for members and officers.  Although there is a members-only section of the website, much useful information about gardening and club activities is available to the general public as part of the organization's education mission.  For example, Gardening and Horticulture Publications is a wide-ranging collection of articles that are posted online, and available to anyone.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[http://www.tgoa-mgca.org/Publications.htm Club gardening and horticulture publications.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Botanist [[Liberty Hyde Bailey]] was awarded the first Johnny Appleseed Memorial Medal by Men's Garden Clubs of America in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0315.html New York Times, ''Liberty H. Bailey, Botanist, Is Dead'', December 27, 1954.] Retrieved 4/15/2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Local clubs ==
Affiliated clubs are located across the United States, with most located in mid-America. Specific details about each club (such as club name, location, and contact information) are available at the TGOA/MGCA website.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[http://www.tgoa-mgca.org/ClubContacts.htm Information about each local club.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Many garden club websites specifically cite their club's current or past affiliation with TGOA/MGCA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dirtdaubers.org/History.html Spartanburg Men's Garden Club.] Retrieved 4/15/2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gardenersofgreatercleveland.org/Gardeners_of_Greater_Cleveland/Welcome.html Gardeners of Greater Cleveland.] Retrieved 4/15/2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minneapolismensgardenclub.org/MGCM/Welcome.html Men's Garden Club of Minneapolis.] Retrieved 4/15/2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ohiogardeners.org/ Gardeners of Greater Akron.] Retrieved 4/15/2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omaha-mens-garden-club.com/About_Us.html Men's Garden Club of Omaha.] Retrieved 4/15/2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes affiliation with TGOA/MGCA leads to the formation of a more narrowly focused garden club, as is the case with the Corvallis Rose Society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://corvallisrosesociety.org/About.html Corvallis Rose Society.] Retrieved 4/15/2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accomplishments ===
Club members engage in a wide range of activities.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[http://www.tgoa-mgca.org/ClubActivities.htm Specific activities at local clubs.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The table that follows shows conservative estimates of total annual contributions made by all TGOA/MGCA clubs to their communities.  This information is based on a 2007 survey where 45% of member clubs responded.

== Meetings and conventions ==
There are several occasions when members gather into groups on a regular basis: local club meetings, regional meetings, national planning and business meetings, and national conventions.

=== Local meetings ===
Arrangements for local club meetings vary based on the needs of individual clubs and their communities, but they generally are held monthly, and include an educational program on gardening techniques, community enhancement, or other topics. They also review current and future club projects and present awards to club members,  Time is included for sharing gardening or project problems and solutions, and socializing.

=== Regional meetings ===
The 36 clubs in 14 states are grouped into 11 geographic regions (2016), as shown in the following table.  If a state has more than one club, then that number is shown in parenthesis after the state name.  Missouri has clubs in two regions.

Each region is formally chartered by the national organization, adopts its own bylaws using the TGOA/MGCA bylaws as a guide, and assists in carrying out national programs.  Each club elects a National Director to the TGOA/MGCA board, to represent the club at board and region meetings and to provide direct club communications with the National office and officers.

Other activities that take place by region include gardening workshops and seminars, tours of local gardens, business meetings, annual regional conferences, and the presentation of region awards to club members.

The '''Thiel Fellowship''' (originally named '''20 under 20''') is a [[Scholarship|fellowship]] created by [[Peter Thiel]] through the [[Thiel Foundation]]. The fellowship is intended for students under the age of 23 and offers them a total of $100,000 over two years, as well as guidance and other resources, to drop out of school and pursue other work, which could involve scientific research, creating a startup, or working on a social movement. Selection for the fellowship is through a competitive annual process, with about 20–25 fellows selected annually. It has a selection rate below 1%.

===Documentary series following some recipients===

The Thiel Fellowship launched a website called "20 Under 20 Documentary Series" that features an online documentary series of four Thiel Fellowship recipients. The students featured in the series are [[Laura Deming]], Chris Rueth, Sujay Tyle, and Alex Kiselev.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.20u.org/about|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018012917/http://www.20u.org/about|archive-date=18 October 2013||date=2012|publisher = The [[Thiel Foundation]] |title = About the Series: 20 under 20|accessdate = 2013-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eduinreview.com/blog/2012/08/20-under-20-documentary-highlights-entrepreneurial-excellence/|title=20 Under 20 Documentary Highlights Entrepreneurial Potential of Education Dropouts|date=23 Aug 2012|website=eduinreview.com|publisher=Education in Review|access-date=8 Jun 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Initial reception===

Thiel's announcement of the Thiel Fellowship met with a diverse array of responses. Some, such as [[Jacob Weisberg]], criticized Thiel's proposal for its utopianism and attack on the importance of education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2010/10/18/what-s-wrong-with-silicon-valley-libertarianism.html |last = Weisberg|first = Jacob|title=What's Wrong with Silicon Valley Libertarianism |publisher=Newsweek |date= 2010-10-18|accessdate=2010-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as [[Vivek Wadhwa]], expressed skepticism about whether the success or failure of the Thiel Fellowship would carry any broader lessons regarding the value of higher education or the wisdom of dropping out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/04/12/friends-don%E2%80%99t-let-friends-take-education-advice-from-peter-thiel/|last = Wadhwa|first = Vivek|title = Friends Don’t Let Friends Take Education Advice From Peter Thiel|date = 2011-04-12|publisher = [[TechCrunch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, shortly after the announcement of the first batch of Thiel Fellows, the admissions office at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] congratulated two MIT students for receiving the Thiel Fellowship. Both students would need to drop out of MIT to receive the fellowship, but would be able to return to MIT to resume their studies after completing the two-year term of the fellowship if they so desired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/incentive_to_drop_out|title = Incentive to Drop Out|publisher = MIT Admissions Blog|date = 2011-05-26|last = McGann|first = Mike|accessdate = 2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later reception===

A year after the announcement of the first batch of Thiel Fellows, opinions on the program ranged from the skeptical and critical to the laudatory and optimistic, as seen in the answers to a [[Quora]] question about the achievements of the first batch of Thiel Fellows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quora.com/Peter-Thiel/What-were-the-results-of-the-first-Thiel-Fellowship-Class|title = What were the results of the first Thiel Fellowship Class?|publisher = Quora}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eric Markowitz offered a mixed review of the Thiel Fellowship in ''[[Inc. (magazine)|Inc.]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inc.com/eric-markowitz/examing-the-thiel-fellowship-is-it-worthwhile.html|title = Examining the Thiel Fellowship: Is It Worthwhile?|last = Markowitz|first = Eric|publisher = Inc Magazine|date = 2012-10-16|accessdate=2012-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2013, an article by Richard Nieva for ''[[PandoDaily]]'' took a close look at how the first batch of Thiel Fellows had fared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pandodaily.com/2013/04/24/examining-the-thiel-fellowship-where-are-they-now/|title = Examining the Thiel Fellowship: Where are they now?|last = Nieva|first = Richard|publisher = ''[[PandoDaily]]''|date = 2013-04-24|accessdate = 2013-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Thiel Fellowship aimed to remove the gender diversity gap.&lt;ref&gt;http://women2.com/2014/07/25/thiel-fellowship-and-gender-diversity-gap/?hvid=44VJU&lt;/ref&gt;

A Quora question asked in 2013 about the final results for the Thiel fellows had received one response as of September 2013, attempting to trace each of the Thiel Fellows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quora.com/Thiel-Fellows/What-were-the-results-of-the-first-Thiel-fellowship-class-as-of-2013|title = What were the results of the first Thiel fellowship class as of 2013?|publisher = Quora|accessdate = 2013-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, [[Vivek Wadhwa]] wrote that the Thiel Fellowship had failed to produce any notable successes to date, and even its limited successes were instances where the Thiel Fellows were working in collaboration with more experienced individuals.&lt;ref name=wadhwa-reprise&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/singularity/2013/09/11/peter-thiel-promised-flying-cars-instead-we-got-caffeine-spray/|title = Billionaire's Failed Education Experiment Proves There's No Shortcut To Success|last = Wadhwa|first = Vivek|date = 2013-09-11|accessdate = 2013-09-15|publisher = ''[[Forbes]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 10, 2013, former [[Harvard University]] President [[Larry Summers]] was reported as having said at the [[Nantucket Project]] conference: "I think the single most misdirected bit of philanthropy in this decade is Peter Thiel's special program to bribe people to drop out of college." His remarks were reported on by many media outlets, ranging from ''[[TechCrunch]]'' to [[Valleywag]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/10/thiel-fellows-program-is-most-misdirected-piece-of-philanthropy-says-larry-summers/|title = Thiel Fellows Program Is 'Most Misdirected Piece Of Philanthropy', Says Larry Summers|last = Ferenstein|first = Gregory|date = October 10, 2013|accessdate = April 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://valleywag.gawker.com/summers-thiel-fellows-is-most-misdirected-piece-of-ph-1443939868/all|title = Summers: Thiel Fellows Is 'Most Misdirected Piece Of Philanthropy'|last = Tiku|first = Nitasha|date = October 11, 2013|accessdate = April 14, 2014|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140415062417/http://valleywag.gawker.com/summers-thiel-fellows-is-most-misdirected-piece-of-ph-1443939868/all|archivedate = April 15, 2014|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/10/14/summers-thiel-misdirected/|title = Summers: Thiel Fellowship 'The Single Most Misdirected Bit of Philanthropy in This Decade'|last = Weinstock|first = Samuel Y.|date = October 14, 2013|accessdate = April 14, 2014|publisher = ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 13, ''TechCrunch'' published a response to Summers co-written by a Thiel Fellow and a mentor for the Thiel Fellowship program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/13/of-course-larry-summers-hates-the-thiel-fellowship/|title = Of Course Harvard’s Larry Summers Hates The Thiel Fellowship|last = Silver|first = Darrell|last2 = Friedman|first2 = Dan|date = October 13, 2013|accessdate = April 14, 2014|publisher = ''TechCrunch''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late December 2013, Thiel Fellow Delian Asparouhov published a lengthy article giving advice on how to select a project and present it to maximize one's chances with the Thiel Fellowship application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://delian.io/thiel-fellowship-application-advice|title = Thiel Fellowship Application Advice|last = Asparouhov|first = Delian|date = December 26, 2013|accessdate = April 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5415">'''Vishwa Jit Gupta''' (sometimes spelt '''Vishwajit Gupta''') is an Indian paleontologist from Punjab University who became infamous for large-scale scientific fraud. His publishing record based on work purportedly made over 20 years consisting of more than 400 research papers came under scrutiny after an Australian geologist, John Talent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/338613a0|title=The case of the peripatetic fossils|journal=Nature|volume=338|issue=6217|pages=613|year=1989|last1=Talent|first1=John A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; researched his claims and work for nearly nine years so as to make a clear case of fraud. The discovery of the fraud began with John Pickett and John Talent who visited a road cut site in Nepal where Gupta had reported prolific numbers of Devonian conodont fossils. They found no fossils at nearly all the twenty sites he had mentioned but they found one site which yielded a fossil of a Silurian age. They subsequently chanced on his use of the same image in two papers and initially considered the possibility of error by adding the wrong photograph. A more detailed examination showed them that Gupta had used illustrations of fossils that were similar to specimens collected near New York by George Hinde in 1879. They interviewed coauthors, talked to Gupta on several occasions and made a detailed accusation on the wilful nature and scale of fraud after nine years of research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.earscirev.2011.12.001|title=Geological fakes and frauds|journal=Earth-Science Reviews|volume=111|pages=224|year=2012|last1=Ruffell|first1=Alastair|last2=Majury|first2=Niall|last3=Brooks|first3=William E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1017/S002233600003331X|title=An evaluation of the V.

The case unravelled with several co-workers realizing that they had been misled and having assumed good faith with a colleague and overlooked obvious contradictions and paradoxical results arising from assuming that Gupta had collected the fossils where he claimed they had been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF02989519|title=Statement concerning a paper on Devonian allegedly Himalayan ammonoids|journal=Paläontologische Zeitschrift|volume=63|issue=3–4|pages=335|year=1989|last1=Erben|first1=H.

John Talent received death threats from Gupta. In an interview to ABC he went on record to note that a technician in Gupta's department who threatened to reveal details of the fraud was reportedly killed in hit-and-run accident. Talent reported that Gupta had offered money to hitmen to inflict injury on his enemies. The aged mother of one of the Indian co-authors of the report by Talent published by the Senckenberg Museum was hit in a road accident and was seriously injured and broke several ribs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20050911052826/http://www.abc.net.au/rn/science/ss/stories/s1451250.htm |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|title=What happens to the Whistleblowers?|date=3 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A four-year enquiry was conducted and Gupta was suspended from the post of director of the Institute of Paleontology at the Panjab University in Chandigarh but reinstated subsequently following a court order and retired "normally" with super-annuation benefits in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s11948-015-9677-6|pmid=26197864|title=Scientific Misconduct in India: Causes and Perpetuation|journal=Science and Engineering Ethics|volume=22|issue=4|pages=1245–9|year=2015|last1=Patnaik|first1=Pratap R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
