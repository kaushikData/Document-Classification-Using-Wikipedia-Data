The Hon '''Abraham Elias''' '''"Abe" Issa''' CBE OJ (October 10, 1905 – November 29, 1984) was a Jamaican businessman, entrepreneur and hotelier acclaimed as “The Father of Jamaican Tourism”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/09/travel/09JamaicaWebSidebar.html|title=Jamaica’s Golden Age|last=Allan|first=David|date=7 November 2008|website=nytimes.com|publisher=The New York Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the first President of the Jamaica Tourist Board he guided the rise and boom in Jamaican tourism of the late 1950s.

His business accomplishments include the founding of Jamaica's first modern department store (Issa's of King Street), the country's first shopping plazas (Tropical Plaza at Half-Way-Tree and Liguanea Plazas), Jamaica's first supermarket (Hi-Lo at Cross Roads in Kingston), Jamaica's modern horse-racing track  ([[Caymanas Park]]) and being a guiding force behind the development of New Kingston, now the island's commercial center. He built Tower Isle Hotel, Jamaica's first all-season resort later evolving it into Couples Hotel, Jamaica's first all-inclusive resort and first couples only resort.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah, Barbara Makeda Blake. “Abe Issa, Mr. Jamaica.” The Gleaner, November 5, 2015, sec. Hospitality Jamaica.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Abe Issa was born in [[Kingston, Jamaica]] to Mary Brimo (died 1953), daughter of Damascus, Syria merchant Joseph Brimo, and Elias Abraham Issa (May 29, 1876 - September 1, 1969), son of Bethlehem, Palestine merchant Abraham Issa who immigrated to [[Kingston, Jamaica]] in 1894 with his son Elias.  Abe's parents Elias and Mary were married on Feb 25, 1900 and the union gave birth to four children, Bertha, Abe, Joseph, and Annie.

The Issa family struggled to establish itself in Kingston. A small notions shop, opened at 32 Princess Street in 1894, failed and Abe's father and grandfather were reduced to peddling goods door to door until they could open a new shop at [https://www.google.com/maps/place/Orange+St,+Kingston,+Jamaica/@17.9788752,-76.7939349,239m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x8edb3f88ca4fecd5:0xd3907cf03f553ca!8m2!3d17.9788752!4d-76.7933374 27 Orange Street].  By 1900 they succeeded in bringing Abe's grandmother Sara and his father's brothers John, Antonio and Joseph to Jamaica.

In 1901 Abe's father Elias formed a partnership with his brothers as [[E.A. Issa &amp; Bros]]. The enterprise thrived and in 1905 moved to 132 Harbour Street.  The shop was destroyed in the January 14, [[1907 Kingston earthquake]] which also took the life of Abe's Uncle Joseph.

With their goods only half insured and their books destroyed the brothers strove to recover and managed to reopen business at Penchon and Barry streets on April 4, 1907.  The business flourished and in 1911 moved to the more advantageous 135 Harbour Street then, as business grew, to the larger 153-157 Harbour Street.

Abe Issa began his elementary education at St. Aloysius School in 1910 then went on to high school studies at [[St. George's College, Kingston, Jamaica|St. George's College]] from 1918-1922.  Following a nine-month stint teaching English to South American students, he departed for Worcester, Massachusetts to begin his university education at [[College of the Holy Cross]].  In 1926 he graduated Summa Cum Laude and delivered his valedictory address in Latin.&lt;ref&gt;Issa, Suzanne. ''Mr. Jamaica Abe Issa'' Suzanne Issa, 1994. p. 8-24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

Abe returned to Kingston in 1926 and entered the family business.  On Dec. 1930 he opened the family's first retail store, Issa's of King Street, that featured international luxury goods. By force of his personality and his insistence on quality service the business thrived.  He and his family would go on to expand their retail business opening three more shops on King Street while expanding the original store from two to four stories and introducing the first escalator in Jamaica.  In 1958 he would purchase Nathan's, the leading competitor department store.

In the early 1930s Abe traveled extensively on the business’ behalf to North America and Europe. In 1934 he traveled Japan via Russia and the [[Trans-Siberian Railroad]] and worked 14 months in [[Yokohama]] operating a factory that manufactured rubber-soled shoes.&lt;ref&gt;Issa, Suzanne. ''Mr. Jamaica Abe Issa'' Suzanne Issa, 1994. p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

Abe's international experiences and knowledge of luxury quality merchandise combined with his outgoing and effusive personality served him well in the family's first move outside the retail trade. On March 14, 1943 the Issa's bought the [[Myrtle Bank Hotel]] and a next door laundry from [[United Fruit Company]] for £35,000. Under Abe's guidance the hotel gained renown as a favored gathering spot of celebrities and distinguished visitors. Its guests included actor [[Errol Flynn]], jazz great [[Louis Armstrong]], actress [[Joan Crawford]], [[Walt Disney]], future Jamaican prime minister [[Norman Manley]], future United States presidential candidate [[Adlai Stevenson II]] and British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]].&lt;ref&gt;Issa, Suzanne. ''Mr. Jamaica Abe Issa'' Suzanne Issa, 1994. p. 61-85 Pictures of the above mentioned luminaries with Abe Issa appear on these pages.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abe rose to become the Vice President of Kingston's Chamber of Commerce. In 1942 he was heralded as "Man of the Year" by Kingston's ''[[Spotlight Magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Issa, Suzanne. ''Mr. Jamaica Abe Issa'' Suzanne Issa, 1994. p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;  The following year he made a foray into politics by forming the Jamaica Democratic Party. While the party failed to win any legislative seats in the 1944 election it began Abe's long involvement in the affairs of the soon-to-be independent nation.&lt;ref&gt;Issa, Suzanne. ''Mr. Jamaica Abe Issa'' Suzanne Issa, 1994. p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

Abe's boldest move came in 1948 when he built Jamaica's first all-season resort outside the then undeveloped fishing port town of Ocho Rios.  Built on a north coast cove with a small barrier reef island Tower Isle Hotel became an immediate sensation and a destination for the well-heeled and glitterati of those days.  Abe was pictured with actress [[Ava Gabor]], boxing champion [[Joe Louis]], actresses [[Debbie Reynolds]], [[Jane Russell]] and [[Mary Martin]], playwright [[Noël Coward]], film director [[Cornel Lumiere]], Britain's [[Princess Margaret]], singer [[Lena Horne]], travel writer [[Eugene Fodor (writer)|Eugene Fodor]], actor [[Errol Flynn]] and comedian [[Norman Wisdom]].  Tower Isle's success triggered the explosion of tourist destinations on Jamaica's north coast.&lt;ref&gt;Issa, Suzanne. ''Mr. Jamaica Abe Issa'' Suzanne Issa, 1994. p. 87-97 Pictures of Abe Issa with the above mentioned celebrities appear in these pages.&lt;/ref&gt; Frequently ahead of his time Abe rebranded Tower Isle as Couples Hotel in 1978 converting it from an all-comers hotel to Jamaica's first all-inclusive and couples-only resort, creating a business model that would be widely imitated.  The hotel remains a part of the Issa family properties as Couples Tower Isle and became the foundation property of [[Couples Resorts]]. The barrier reef island upon which a tower stands and from which the property's name derives serves as the resort's [[au naturel]] beach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://couples.com/about-us|title=Learn More about Couples Resort - A Luxury Resort in Jamaica }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955 Abe became the first President of the newly formed [[Jamaica Tourist Board]] serving in that post until 1963.  He led an aggressive international marketing campaign. Jamaican tourism grew from 86,000 tourists and £4 million in revenue in 1955 to 227,000 tourists with £38 million in revenue in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;Jamaica Tourist Board "Come to Jamaica 1955-1963.” Jamaicans.com, October 27, 2014. http://www.jtbonline.org/jtb/come-to-jamaica/&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958 he was appointed to Jamaica's legislative council on approval by the Queen.&lt;ref&gt;“Abe Issa Appointed to Jamaica Post.” Pittsburgh Press, June 29, 1958, sec. 5, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959 he was elected President of the [[Caribbean Tourist Association]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

During this time he led his family's business expansion with the opening of the Hi-Lo at Cross Roads in Kingston, Jamaica's first super market, [[Caymanas Park]], Jamaicas first modern horse-racing track and was a key figure in the development of New Kingston that today is Kingston's commercial and business center.  In 1961 Abe became Chief Executive of the [[House of Issa]], the successor family entity to E.A. Issa &amp; Bros.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} In 1969 the family's patriarch Elias Issa passed at age 93 leaving behind a great legacy and a memorable quote,  “Nothing shortens life like worry… my worries don’t last. I do something about them.”

On August 6, 1962 Jamaica became an independent nation and Abe played several key roles in the young nation's economic development. He served as a director of the Jamaica Industrial Development Corporation, headed the Development Finance Corporation, and its successor Jamaica Development Bank and as director of the Urban Development Corporation where he outlined plans for cruise ship access to Kingston's harbor. He served as Chairman of Jamaica Unit Trust Services Ltd. the managing company of the Jamaica Investment Fund and in 1974 served as chairman of Free Zone Promotional Council. From 1965-1972 he served as a Board Member of Air Jamaica. In 1968 he took over and turned around of the troubled assets of Runaway Bay Golf and Country Club and Runaway Bay Golf Course from Sunley Hotels Ltd. In 1973 he obtained the Hertz car rental franchise for Jamaica.&lt;ref&gt;Issa, Suzanne. ''Mr. Jamaica Abe Issa'' Suzanne Issa, 1994. p. 160-168&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==

In 1960 Abe Issa was made a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) for his contributions in the field of tourism.&lt;ref&gt;Issa, Suzanne. ''Mr. Jamaica Abe Issa'' Suzanne Issa, 1994. p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[Order of Jamaica]] (OJ) in 1980 in recognition of his pioneering role in the development of the tourism industry in Jamaica.&lt;ref&gt;Issa, Suzanne. ''Mr. Jamaica Abe Issa'' Suzanne Issa, 1994. p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984 he was awarded Norman Manley Award For Excellence in the Field of Tourism.&lt;ref&gt;Issa, Suzanne. ''Mr. Jamaica Abe Issa'' Suzanne Issa, 1994. p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 he was posthumously honored by being placed on a Jamaican postage stamp being hailed as “the Father of Jamaican tourism” for his role in the creation of the Jamaican Tourist Industry.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Rebecca. “Postage Sheetlets Honor Issa Family.” Holy Cross Magazine 39, no. 1 &amp; 2 (Winter / Spring 2005): p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

While on 1931 business trip to [[New York City]], Abe met Lorraine Shaouy, daughter of Adele Massabni and Elias Shaouy of Beirut, Lebanon,  a designer who had moved to New York in 1898 and opened design school and was later a real estate investor.  Abe and Lorraine married in Bethlehem, Palestine on Feb. 1, 1937. The couple would have six children, Carole, Brenda, the twins Suzanne and Lee (Elias), Jackie, Paul.

Abe excelled in sports as a cricketer, footballer (soccer) and tennis player.  Broadly read and widely traveled he acquired the ''savoir faire'' that provided him with the sophistication, social ease and grace that would charm and induce cooperation with the cast of celebrities, royalty, politicians and business colleagues who crossed his path in life.&lt;ref&gt;Issa, Suzanne. ''Mr. Jamaica Abe Issa'' Suzanne Issa, 1994. p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==

Abe Issa died on November 29, 1984 following a period of terminal illness.  His life would encompass his family's rise from the death and destruction of the 1907 earthquake to its establishment of as a world renowned Jamaican business empire. It would witness Jamaican independence and economic development in which he would play the leading role in the development of the nation's most important economic asset of tourism.

His House of Issa continues on encompassing retail and hospitality industry assets led by his sons Lee Issa and Paul Issa.  His famed Tower Isle Hotel has become the anchor property of the award-winning all-inclusive resort chain [[Couples Resorts]].  His daughter Susanne authored a pictorial biography of him with the fitting title of “Mr. Jamaica Abe Issa”.&lt;ref&gt;Issa, Suzanne. ''Mr. Jamaica Abe Issa'' Suzanne Issa, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alexander Nesis''' (born December 19, 1962, [[Leningrad]], [[USSR]]) is the founder, president and CEO of the [[ICT Group (Russia)|ICT Group]], a private equity firm headquartered in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], which invests mainly in the [[finance]], [[precious metals]] and [[engineering]] sectors.

==Biography==
Born in Leningrad in 1962, Nesis studied [[radiochemistry]] at the prestigious Lensovet [[Leningrad Institute of Technology]]. After graduation he worked as master supervisor at the [[Baltic Shipyard|Baltic Shipbuilding Yard]] (the largest and one of the oldest in Russia, est. 1856), which produced a variety of ships including nuclear icebreakers and submarines.&lt;ref name="Job"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orielresources.com/nonexecutive_209.asp |title=Alexander Nesis |publisher=Oriel Resources Ltd |accessdate=2012-05-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402170618/http://www.orielresources.com/nonexecutive_209.asp |archivedate=2012-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baltic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bz.ru/en/about.html|title=Baltiysky Zavod|publisher=Baltiysky Zavod Joint Stock Company|accessdate=2012-05-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510181548/http://www.bz.ru/en/about.html|archive-date=2012-05-10|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1990s, Nesis left the shipyard to set out as an entrepreneur, opting to work for himself rather than for the state.&lt;ref name="Forbes Russians"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/finance/lists/75/2004/LIR.jhtml?passListId=75&amp;passYear=2004&amp;passListType=Person&amp;uniqueId=SN3U&amp;datatype=Person|title= Russia's 100 Richest 2004|publisher=Forbes|year= 2004|accessdate=2012-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with a small group of business partners, he first concentrated on the production of materials derived from uranium deposits located in the deserts of [[Uzbekistan]].&lt;ref name="The Telegraph"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/industry/mining/8612140/Billionaire-Alexander-Nesis-reveals-why-Polymetal-is-listing-in-London.html|title=Billionaire Alexander Nesis reveals why Polymetal is listing in London|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|date= 2011-07-03|accessdate=2012-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, the same group of entrepreneurs embarked upon a new venture to invest in the shipbuilding and metals industries.&lt;ref name="Forbes 2010"&gt;{{cite news|title= Forbes - The World's Billionaires|url= https://www.forbes.com/lists/2010/10/billionaires-2010_Alexander-Nesis_SN3U.html|work= [[Forbes]]|date= 2010-03-03|accessdate=2012-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, their company became known as the ICT Group. In the same year, having made his fortune, Nesis returned to the Baltic Shipbuilding Yards as its controlling shareholder and Head of Board of Directors.

==ICT Group==
{{main|ICT Group (Russia)}}
The ICT ('Investments, Construction, Technologies') Group, founded by Nesis in the early 1990s, is now one of the largest privately owned investment and industrial companies in [[Russia]]. It is headquartered in [[Moscow]] and has a large office in [[St. Petersburg]]. It invests in, develops and manages assets in wide range of industries, including the banking and financial industry, metals and [[mining]], precious metal production, heavy engineering, [[logistics]], [[construction]] and development.&lt;ref name="The Telegraph"/&gt;

At present, the portfolio of assets under the Group's management includes such recognized leaders in their respective industries as NOMOS-BANK, Khanty-Mansi Bank, Polymetal and Tikhvin Freight Car Building Plant. The Group also holds large equity stakes in the potash producer Uralkali and Baltic Leasing.&lt;ref name="RBC Daily"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rbcdaily.ru/2011/04/20/industry/562949980108028|title=RBC Daily|publisher=RBC Website|accessdate=2012-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group's assets are located primarily in Russia, but it also has interests in Kazakhstan. According to ICT's website, the total value of its assets under management stands at $8 billion.&lt;ref name="The Telegraph"/&gt;

== Business Approach ==
Nesis and the ICT Group's preferred business strategy is to set up a project and grow it until it can be run independently. ICT has been described as a kind of incubator, which holds on to investments while they are in the design or technical research stage before spinning them out separately when they have reached a critical mass.&lt;ref name="The Telegraph"/&gt; In terms of engineering, he places a strong emphasis on the design stage: "If you make a mistake at the design stage, that's very difficult to repair. If you make a mistake at the construction page, it's easier to repair [...] it's very important to find the right technology solution."&lt;ref name="Metal Bulletin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metalbulletin.com/Article/2868075/The-unassuming-billionaire-MB-meets-Polymetal-founder-Alexander-Nesis.html|title=The unassuming billionaire: MB meets Polymetal founder Alexander Nesis|publisher=Metal Bulletin|date= 2011-07-20|accessdate=2012-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Corporate Governance Roles ==
*President of the ICT Group
*Nesis served as Chairman of the Board of Directors at OAO Baltiysky Zavod between 1993 and 1998 and 2002-2005
*Acted as General Director and a member of the Board of Directors at Polymetal, 1998–2003
*Serves as Member of the Board of Directors at OAO Uralkali, 2010–present

== Personal Wealth ==
As of March 2012, ''[[Forbes Magazine|Forbes]]'' put Nesis's personal wealth at approximately $3.1 billion, putting him at No.367 in its list of billionaires and making him No.31 in Russia.&lt;ref name="Forbes 2012"&gt;

'''Aras Iskenderovich Agalarov''' ({{lang-az|Araz İsgəndər oğlu Ağalarov}}; {{lang-ru|link=no|Ара́з Исканде́рович Агала́ров}}; born 8 November 1955) is an Azerbaijani-Russian [[billionaire]] businessman, property developer, public figure, and author.

==Early life==
Born in [[Baku]], Agalarov was educated at the [[Azerbaijan Polytechnical Institute]]. There, he studied computer engineering and was a member of the [[Communist Party of Azerbaijan]] and Baku City Committee.&lt;ref name=NYT17july17&gt;{{cite news |last1=MacFarquhar |first1=Neil |authorlink1=Neil MacFarquhar |title=A Developer and Kremlin Fixer With a Web of Trump Contacts |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/16/world/europe/aras-agalarov-trump-kremlin.html |accessdate=18 July 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=17 July 2017 |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He moved with his family to Moscow in 1998, where he co-founded [[Crocus International]] alongside his father-in-law, [[Iosif Yevgenevich]], which specializes in [[trade fair]]s, where he still makes most of his money.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

==Career==
Agalarov then opened the first Crocus Inter store, which became a retail business that includes malls offering housewares.&lt;ref name=forbes /&gt; This moved him into [[property development]], where he built the [[Crocus City Mall]], the largest shopping centre in Moscow. Adjacent to this he then built the largest trade center in Russia on the outskirts of Moscow, [[Crocus Expo]], and has since developed a luxury housing development.  He has partnered with [[Robert De Niro]] in [[Nobu Matsuhisa]]'s two Moscow restaurants.&lt;ref name=NYT17july17/&gt;

In 2012, the {{ill|Crocus Group|ru}} built a new campus for the [[Far Eastern Federal University]] outside [[Vladivostok]].&lt;ref name=NYT11july17 /&gt; Agalarov says he had to buy a larger Gulfstream jet to visit the site, where he spent $100&amp;nbsp;million of his own money on cost overruns on the $1.2&amp;nbsp;billion campus of 70 new building on [[Russky Island]] overlooking the [[Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref name=NYT17july17 /&gt; He then won projects for a Moscow superhighway and two stadiums for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref name=NYT17july17 /&gt;

In January 2013, Agalarov and his son visited [[Las Vegas]], Nevada, after [[Donald Trump]], the beauty pageant's owner, announced at [[Miss Universe 2012]] that the next competition would be hosted by Agalarov in Moscow.&lt;ref name=NYT11july17&gt;{{cite news |last1=Twohey |first1=Megan |last2=Eder |first2=Steve |title=How a Pageant Led to a Trump Son's Meeting With a Russian Lawyer |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/10/us/politics/rob-goldstone-russia-trump.html |accessdate=11 July 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=11 July 2017 |page=A16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He paid Trump $20&amp;nbsp;million to host the pageant.&lt;ref name=NYT17july17/&gt; In November 2013, President [[Vladimir Putin]] awarded Agalarov the Russian [[Order of Honour (Russia)|Order of Honor]].&lt;ref name=NYT11july17/&gt; That month, Agalarov hosted [[Miss Universe 2013]] at his [[Crocus City Hall]].&lt;ref name=NYT11july17/&gt;&lt;ref name="buzz"/&gt; Moreover, Agalarov's wife acted as a judge on the panel while his son was one of the performers.&lt;ref name="snyder103"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Snyder|first1=Timothy|authorlink=Timothy Snyder|title=[[The Road to Unfreedom: Russia, Europe, America]]|date=2018|publisher=The Bodley Head|location=London, U.K.|isbn=978-1-847-92526-8|page=103|quote=He did the work for the Miss Universe pageant: it was hosted on his property, his wife was a judge, his son sang.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herman Gref]], who runs [[Sberbank of Russia]], Agalarov and his son hosted a dinner for Trump on the night of the pageant.&lt;ref name=NYT11july17/&gt; While in Moscow, [[Phil Ruffin]], who is a partner in [[Trump International Hotel Las Vegas]], and Trump met with the Agalarov and his son at the Ritz-Carlton.&lt;ref name=NYT11july17/&gt; Trump then appeared in a music video with Agalarov's son alongside many of the contestants.&lt;ref name=NYT11july17/&gt; Trump and Agalarov planned on a $3&amp;nbsp;billion project, with state-owned Sberbank agreeing to provide 70% of the financing.&lt;ref name=NYT17july17/&gt;

Agalarov has served as a liaison between Trump and Putin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=17 June 2016 |title=Inside Trump's financial ties to Russia and his unusual flattery of Vladimir Putin |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/inside-trumps-financial-ties-to-russia-and-his-unusual-flattery-of-vladimir-putin/2016/06/17/dbdcaac8-31a6-11e6-8ff7-7b6c1998b7a0_story.html |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |access-date=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an interview, they once discussed the construction of [[business projects of Donald Trump in Russia|a Trump Tower in Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Pismennaya |last2=Kravchenko |last3=Baker |first1=Evgenia |first2=Stepan |first3=Stephanie |title=The Day Trump Came to Moscow: Oligarchs, Miss Universe and Nobu |url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-21/the-day-trump-came-to-moscow-oligarchs-miss-universe-and-nobu |website=[[Bloomberg LP]] |accessdate=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agalarov had also reportedly tried to set up a meeting between the two, but this was canceled due to Putin having to meet the Dutch royal couple at the time. Putin instead sent Trump a [[fedoskino miniature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2017/03/21/donald-trumps-kremlin-connecties-7466490-a1551176 |title=Interactief: zo lopen de lijnen van Trump naar Poetin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, [[Kyrgyzstan]] signed a treaty with Russia that named Crocus Group as the single supplier of services to integrate into the [[Eurasian Economic Union]], avoiding competitive bidding on the $127&amp;nbsp;million deal.&lt;ref name=NYT17july17/&gt;

Agalarov's son, [[Emin Agalarov|Emin]], helped arrange Russian lawyer [[Natalia Veselnitskaya]]'s [[Trump campaign–Russian meeting|June 9, 2016 meeting]] with [[Donald Trump Jr.]], [[Jared Kushner]], and [[Paul Manafort]] in [[Trump Tower]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Apuzzo |first1=Matt |last2=Becker |first2=Jo |last3=Goldman |first3=Adam |last4=Haberman |first4=Maggie |date=10 July 2017 |title=Trump Jr. Was Told in Email of Russian Effort to Aid Campaign |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/10/us/politics/donald-trump-jr-russia-email-candidacy.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=11 July 2017 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mcall.com/news/nationworld/ct-russia-lawyer-donald-trump-jr-20170711-story.html |title=Natalia Veselnitskaya, the lawyer who met with Donald Trump Jr., defends herself |first=Amanda |last=Erickson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the meeting, Agalarov wired $1.2 million to a bank in [[New Jersey]] controlled by Emin, a transfer which is being investigated by American law enforcement.&lt;ref name="buzz"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/anthonycormier/trump-tower-meeting-suspicious-transactions-agalarov |title=A Series Of Suspicious Money Transfers Followed The Trump Tower Meeting |first=Anthony |last=Cormier |first2=Jason |last2=Leopold |date=September 12, 2018 |publisher=[[BuzzFeed News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emin said that after Trump won the [[United States presidential election, 2016|United States presidential election in 2016]], Trump sent them a handwritten note, saying he does not forget his friends.&lt;ref name=NYT11july17/&gt;

As of June 2017, he had an estimated net worth of US$1.91&amp;nbsp;billion, most of which is derived from his real estate ventures.&lt;ref name="forbes"/&gt; In January 2017, ''[[Forbes]]'' listed him as the 51st [[List of Russian people by net worth|richest Russian]].&lt;ref name=forbesRU&gt;{{cite news |title=Араз Агаларов |url=http://www.forbes.ru/profile/aras-agalarov |accessdate=10 June 2017 |work=[[Forbes]] |language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Agalarov is married and has two children. His son [[Emin Agalarov]] is a businessman and singer/songwriter. Emin was married to [[Leyla Aliyeva]], the daughter of the current [[President of Azerbaijan]], [[Ilham Aliyev]], until they divorced in May 2015. Agalarov has twin grandsons from his son's marriage. In July 2017, Agalarov put his mansion in [[Alpine, New Jersey]] up for sale for $7 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Russian Oligarch With Ties to Trump Meeting Is Selling New Jersey Mansion |url=https://www.realtor.com/news/trends/aras-agalarov-selling-new-jersey-mansion/ |website=realtor.com News |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mansion eventually sold in November 2017 for $5.8 million.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2121">'''Baldur Ágústsson''' is an [[Icelanders|Icelandic]] businessman, who ran for [[president of Iceland]] in [[Icelandic presidential election, 2004|2004]] and [[Icelandic presidential election, 2016|2016]].

Baldur started his career as a [[wireless operator]] on board a [[fishing boat]], and later became an [[air traffic controller]] at [[Reykjavík Airport]]. Meanwhile, he set up Iceland´s first security firm, Varði. In the early 2000s he lived in [[Britain (country)|Britain]] where he was engaged in real estate business. He was the main challenger against incumbent [[Olafur Ragnar Grimsson]] in the [[Icelandic presidential election, 2004|2004 Icelandic presidential election]] where he got 12.5% of the vote. It was only the second time a sitting president had been challenged and the first time a challenger got more than 6% of the vote.

His motivation for running was dissatisfaction with the President [[veto]]ing a media bill, which was the first use of a presidential veto in the history of Iceland. 

''"I personally believe that Ólafur Ragnar should not have used it on a smallish issue such as media bill. It is a bit like a lifeboat. You don’t use it when you want to go on a trip, you use it when there is an emergency and this was not an emergency."''&lt;ref&gt;http://grapevine.is/mag/feature/2004/06/25/baldur-agustsson/&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016 he announced his decision to run for president once more aiming to "restore respect for the presidency, to promote a better service to the sick, the elderly and the disabled, to promote friendship with foreign nations and operate the presidency within the framework of the budget."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mbl.is/frettir/innlent/2016/05/01/baldur_bydur_sig_fram/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7717">The '''Bihari brothers''', Lester, Jules, Saul and Joe, were American businessmen of Hungarian Jewish origins.&lt;ref name = "NYT"/&gt; They were the founders of [[Modern Records]] in [[Los Angeles]] and its subsidiaries, such as [[Meteor Records]], based in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]. The Bihari brothers were significant figures in the process that transformed rhythm and blues into [[rock and roll]], which appealed to white audiences in the 1950s.&lt;ref name = "NYT"/&gt;

==Origins==
The brothers' parents were [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] [[Judaism|Jewish]] emigrants from [[Austria-Hungary]] to the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stanford.edu/~siegelr/schoentree.html Schoenbrun Family Tree&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Bihari (1882–1930) was born in [[Budapest]]. Esther "Esti" Taub (1886–1950) was born in [[Homonna]], [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] (now [[Humenné]], [[Slovakia]]). They were married in [[Philadelphia]] (U.S.) in 1911. They had four sons:
:'''Lester Louis Bihari''' (May 12, 1912, [[Pottstown, Pennsylvania]] – September 9, 1983)
:'''Julius Jeramiah Bihari''' (September 9, 1913,&lt;ref&gt;Most sources state that Julius was the eldest brother, but from the genealogical evidence cited here, this appears to be an error&lt;/ref&gt; Pottstown – November 17, 1984, [[Los Angeles]]) 
:'''Saul Samuel Bihari''' (March 9, 1918, [[St. Louis, Missouri]] – February 22, 1975) 
:'''Joseph Bihari''' (May 30, 1925, [[Memphis, Tennessee]] – November 28, 2013, Los Angeles)&lt;ref name = "NYT"&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/12/arts/music/joe-bihari-who-put-early-rb-on-record-dies-at-88.html?_r=0| title = Joe Bihari obituary| author = Yardley, William| date = December 11, 2013| accessdate = December 29, 2013| publisher = ''The New York Times''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://articles.latimes.com/2013/dec/07/local/la-me-1208-passings-20131208| title = Joe Bihari obituary| date = December 7, 2013| accessdate = December 29, 2013| publisher = ''Los Angeles Times''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to their four sons, they had four daughters: Florette, Rosalind and Maxine, all of whom worked in the Bihari brothers' business, and Serene, who did not. Serene married the New York real estate developer [[Irving M. Felt]].

==Careers==

After living for a period in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], the Bihari family moved to Los Angeles in 1941. 
Jules got a job servicing and operating jukeboxes in the [[Watts, Los Angeles, California|Watts]] district, and found difficulty in locating and stocking the blues records his customers wanted to hear. He and his younger brothers, Saul and Joe, founded a new label, Modern Records, in 1945. They built Modern into a major blues and R&amp;B label, their first success coming with "Swingin' the Boogie", by [[Hadda Brooks]]. They bought a pressing plant and divided tasks among themselves, with Jules responsible for talent spotting and recording, Saul for manufacturing, and Lester for distribution. Joe worked with [[Ike Turner]] as a talent scout in the Memphis area, discovering [[Johnny "Guitar" Watson]], among others.

In the early 1950s the Biharis launched several subsidiaries: [[RPM Records (USA)|RPM Records]], [[Flair Records]] and [[Meteor Records]], which was set up in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] in 1952 and was headed by Lester Bihari.  Successful artists on the Biharis' labels included [[B.B. King]], [[Elmore James]], [[John Lee Hooker]], [[Etta James]], [[Lightnin' Hopkins]], [[Lowell Fulson]], [[Rufus Thomas]], [[Donna Hightower]] and [[Charlie Feathers]].

The companies always remained small and personally run. B.B. King has said that he always felt the brothers were accessible: "The company was never bigger than the artist. I could always talk to them."&lt;ref name="shaw"&gt;{{cite book

| publisher=Macmillan Publishing Company 
| location= New York
| isbn= 0-02-061740-2
| page= 223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later they launched more subsidiaries: [[Crown Records]] (featuring artists like [[Johnny Cole]], [[Vic Damone]], [[Trini Lopez]] with [[Johnny Torres]], [[Jerry Cole]], the [[Dave Clark Five]]) and [[United/Superior Records]]. In the sixties they launched a subsidiary, [[Yuletide Records]], which specialized in [[Christmas]] records (mostly with [[Johnny Cole and the Robert Evans Chorus]]).

In the mid 1960s Modern Records went bankrupt and stopped operating, but the catalogue went with the management into what would become [[Kent Records]]. After the deaths of Saul, Lester and Jules Bihari, the label's catalogue was licensed to [[Ace Records (UK)]] in the mid-1980s and purchased by Ace in the 1990s.

==Pseudonyms and royalties==
Though they were not songwriters, the Biharis often purchased or claimed co-authorship of songs that appeared on their own labels, thus securing songwriting [[royalties]] for themselves, in addition to their other sources of income.

Sometimes these songs were older [[Standard (music)|standards]] renamed. B.B. King's rendition of "[[Rock Me Baby (song)|Rock Me Baby]]" was such a tune; anonymous jams, as with "B.B.'s Boogie" or songs by employees, such as [[bandleader]] Vince Weaver. The Biharis used a number of [[pseudonym]]s for songwriting credits: Jules was credited as '''Jules Taub''', Joe as '''Joe Josea''', and Saul as '''Sam Ling'''. One song by [[John Lee Hooker]], "Down Child" is solely credited to "Taub", with Hooker receiving no credit for the song whatsoever. Another, "Turn Over a New Leaf" is credited to Hooker and "Ling". Taub was the Biharis' mother's maiden name.

Commonly known among music circles but not publicly acknowledged is that Jules and the Bihari brothers would effectively steal music from up and coming black artists by taking advantage of the artists financial situation. The Biharis would have their name added to writing credits when they had nothing to do with the creation of the music in any way.

B.B. King has said: "The company I was with knew a lot of things they didn’t tell me, that I didn’t learn about until later... Some of the songs I wrote, they added a name when I copyrighted it,"..."Like 'King and Ling' or 'King and Josea.' There was no such thing as Ling, or Josea. No such thing. That way, the company could claim half of your song."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Catherine Samba-Panza''' (born 26 June 1956) was [[List of heads of state of the Central African Republic and Central African Empire|interim President]] of the [[Central African Republic]] from 2014 to 2016. She was the first woman to hold the post of head of state in that country, as well as the eighth woman in Africa to do so. Prior to becoming head of state, she was Mayor of [[Bangui]]&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-25811250 |title=Central African Republic MPs elect Catherine Samba-Panza |publisher=BBC World News |date=2014-01-20 |accessdate=2014-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 2013 to 2014.

==Early life==
Samba-Panza was born in [[N'Djamena|Fort Lamy]], [[Chad]], to a mother from the [[Central African Republic]] (CAR) and a Cameroonian father.&lt;ref name="lamy"&gt;{{cite news|last=Duhem|first=Vincent|title=Centrafrique : 5 choses à savoir sur Catherine Samba Panza, la nouvelle présidente de transition|url=http://www.jeuneafrique.com/Article/ARTJAWEB20140120155950/centrafrique-cnt-conseil-national-de-transition-crise-centrafricaine-crise-centrafricaine-centrafrique-5-choses-a-savoir-sur-catherine-samba-panza-la-nouvelle-presidente-de-transition.html|newspaper=Jeune Afrique|date=20 January 2014|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to politics, she was a businesswoman and corporate lawyer.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; She moved to the CAR at the age of 18.&lt;ref name="lp"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ngoupana|first=Paul-Marin|title=Une femme élue à la présidence en Centrafrique|url=http://www.lepoint.fr/fil-info-reuters/une-femme-elue-a-la-presidence-en-centrafrique-20-01-2014-1782418_240.php|newspaper=Le Point|date=20 January 2014|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was trained in law at [[Panthéon-Assas University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Perrin|first=Olivier|title=Une "maire courage" pour réconcilier ses enfants de République centrafricaine|url=http://www.lesoir.be/407253/article/actualite/monde/2014-01-21/une-maire-courage-pour-reconcilier-ses-enfants-republique-centrafricaine|newspaper=Le Soir|date=21 January 2014|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
She was appointed [[Mayor of Bangui|Mayor]] of [[Bangui]], the capital of the CAR, by the National Transitional Council (CNT) during the [[Central African Republic conflict (2012–13)|2012–13 conflict]] on 14 June 2013.&lt;ref name="lamy"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiondekeluka.org/societe/item/15873-la-nouvelle-pr%C3%A9sidente-de-la-d%C3%A9l%C3%A9gation-sp%C3%A9ciale-de-la-ville-de-bangui,-madame-catherine-samba-panza,-a-pris-officiellement-ses-fonctions-de-maire-ce-14-juin-2013-la-c%C3%A9r%C3%A9monie-a-eu-lieu-au-palais-de-justice-%C3%A0-bangui.html|title=Catherine Samba Panza prête serment à Bangui|publisher=Radio Ndeke Luka|date=2013-06-14|accessdate=2014-01-31|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her appointment was accepted by both sides in the conflict,&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; as well as by French President [[Francois Hollande]].&lt;ref name="lp"/&gt; She is a non-partisan.&lt;ref name="lamy"/&gt;

Following the [[Central African Republic conflict under the Djotodia administration]] and President [[Michel Djotodia]]'s resignation after a [[Economic Community of Central African States|CEEAC]] summit on 10 January 2014, [[Alexandre-Ferdinand Nguendet]] served as acting president until the CNT [[Central African Republic presidential election, 2014|elected]] Samba Panza as interim President&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul-Marin Ngoupana |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/01/11/uk-centralafrican-idUKBREA090O220140111 |title=Central African Republic's capital tense as ex-leader heads into exile |publisher=Uk.reuters.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; from a list of eight candidates who had to prove they had no links to either the [[Séléka]] or the [[Anti-balaka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2014/01/car-2014120133557833528.html |title=CAR appoints Bangui mayor as interim leader |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date= |accessdate=2014-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was to lead the country to the [[Central African general election, 2015–16|2015 election]]. Of the MPs who voted in the election, 129 of the 135 MPs were in parliament. After beating [[Désiré Kolingba]] in a second round ballot, she said:&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"I call on my children, especially the anti-balaka, to put down their arms and stop all the fighting. The same goes for the ex-Séléka – they should not have fear. I don't want to hear any more talk of murders and killings. Starting today, I am the president of all Central Africans, without exclusion."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Her call for talks between both sides to the conflict was welcomed by the parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2014/01/car-leader-pledges-talks-with-armed-groups-201412285543966125.html |title=CAR leader pledges talks with armed groups |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date= |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was sworn in as President on 23 January 2014.&lt;ref name=aje&gt;{{cite news|first=|last= |title=New CAR leader sworn in as tensions escalate  |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2014/01/new-car-leader-sworn-as-tensions-escalate-2014123162736447639.html |work=[[Al Jazeera English]] |date=2014-01-23 |accessdate=2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[André Nzapayeké]] was appointed as Prime Minister to serve during her tenure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2014/01/new-car-pm-says-ending-atrocities-priority-2014126124325498176.html|title=New CAR PM says ending atrocities is priority|publisher=|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She presided over a period that was said to be without law, functioning police or courts. Comparisons were drawn in asking if this would be the "next [[Rwandan Genocide|Rwanda]];" although ''[[Al Jazeera]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s [[Barnaby Phillips]] suggested the [[Bosnian Genocide]]'s aftermath may be more apt as people were moving into religiously cleansed neighbourhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.aljazeera.com/blog/africa/deep-divisions-car-violence-continues|title=Deep divisions as CAR violence continues|work=Al Jazeera Blogs|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samba-Panza suggested poverty and a failure of governance was the cause of the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/video/africa/2014/02/political-manipulation-blamed-car-unrest-201429235449737704.html|title=Politics blamed for CAR divisions|publisher=|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''concession''' or '''concession agreement''' is a grant of rights, land or property by a government, local authority, corporation, individual or other legal entity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-concession-agreement.htm#did-you-know What is a concession agreement?], wisegeek.com&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Public services]] such as [[water supply]] may be operated as a concession. In the case of a public service concession, a private company enters into an agreement with the government to have the exclusive right to operate, maintain and carry out [[investment]] in a public utility (such as a [[water privatisation]]) for a given number of years. Other forms of contracts between public and private entities, namely [[lease contract]] and [[management contract]] (in the water sector often called by the French term ''affermage''), are closely related but differ from a concession in the rights of the operator and its remuneration. A lease gives a company the right to operate and maintain a public utility, but investment remains the responsibility of the public. Under a management contract the operator will collect the revenue only on behalf of the government and will in turn be paid an agreed fee.

A grant of land or property by a government may be in return for services or for a particular use, a right to undertake and profit by a specified activity, a lease for a particular purpose. A concession may include the right to use some existing [[infrastructure]] required to carry out a business (such as a water supply system in a city); in some cases, such as [[mining]], it may involve merely the transfer of exclusive or non-exclusive [[easement]]s.

In the private sector, the owner of a concession &amp;mdash; the ''concessionaire'' &amp;mdash; typically pays either a fixed sum or a percentage of revenue to the owner of the entity from which it operates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/concessionagreement.asp Definition of concession agreement] investorpedia.com&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of concessions within another business are [[concession stand]]s within sporting venues and movie theaters and concessions in [[department stores]] operated by other [[retailer]]s. Short term concessions may be granted as promotional space for periods as short as one day.

Depending on what the law that is related to a sector states, concession can either allow the authority to retain or keep ownership of the assets, turning over to the concessionaire and reverting the ownership back to an authority once the duration of their concession ended, or both the authority and concessionaire own the facilities.

==Early history==
[[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]] used contracts called concessions to build cheap infrastructure - dams and railroads - whereby foreign European companies would raise capital, build projects, and collect most of the operating revenue but would provide Ali's government with a portion of that revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Zachary|last=Karabell|title=Parting the desert: the creation of the Suez Canal|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|p=34,36|date=2003|isbn=0-375-40883-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; For other examples of concessions, see ''[[Gibbons v. Ogden]]'' and [[History of rail transport in the United States|United States railroad policy]].

==European Union regulation==
Within the [[European Union]], the granting of concessions by public bodies is subject to regulation. Works concessions have been subject to award rules for some time as Directive 2004/18/EC of the [[European Parliament]] and of the [[European Council]] on [[Government procurement in the European Union|public procurement]] applied to works concessions, and the award of services concessions with a cross-border interest has been subject to the principles of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]]. However, the European Parliament and the European Council issued a further Directive 2014/23/EU on the award of concession contracts &lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014L0023&amp;from=EN Directive 2014/23/EU of the European Parliament of the Council on the award of concession contracts]&lt;/ref&gt; on 26 February 2014 which required EU member states to introduce national legislation covering the award of concession contracts in excess of EUR 5,186,000 awarded on or after 18 April 2016.

In the UK, the threshold for concession contracts is £4,104,394.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1913">[[File:Bolivia Consular Inv 1951.jpg|right|thumb|A Bolivian [[revenue stamp]] of 1951 to collect the fee on consular invoices.]]
In [[international law]], '''consularization''' is the act of [[authentication|authenticating]] any legal document by the [[consul (representative)|consul]] office, by the consul signing and affixing a red ribbon to the document. International trade shipments often require consular invoices and other documents that may need to be consularized include travel documents (such as a parental consent letter for persons under 18 traveling without a parent), [[Letter of credit|letters of credit]], and [[Power of attorney|powers of attorney]].

==Consular invoices==
A consular invoice is  a document, often in triplicate, submitted to the consul or embassy of a country to which goods are to be exported before the goods are sent abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Hinkelman, Edward G. (2006) ''Dictionary of international trade''. 7th edn. Petaluma, Calif. World Trade Press, p. 41. {{ISBN|1885073739}}&lt;/ref&gt; The completed documents then travel with the goods and enable the customs officials in the destination country to verify the quantity, value and nature of the goods on arrival. A fee may be charged by the consulate for the checking and approval of the documents.

At the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] round in 1952, it was proposed that consularization of commercial invoices be abolished. In 2005, the United States and Uganda submitted a proposal to the [[World Trade Organization]] to abolish consularization.

Alternative terms include ''konsularfaktura'' (German), ''facture consulaire'' (French), ''factura consular'' (Spanish), ''fattura consolare'' (Italian) and ''fatura consular'' (Portuguese Br.).&lt;ref&gt;Hinkelman, pp. 676-677.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3449">A '''cost driver''' is the unit of an activity that causes the change in activity's cost.

{{quote|cost driver is any factor which causes a change in the cost of an activity|[[Chartered Institute of Management Accountants]]}}

"Cost drivers are the structural determinants of the cost of an activity, reflecting any linkages or interrelationships that affect it".&lt;ref&gt;"Competitive Advantage", by [[Michael Porter]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore we could assume that the cost drivers determine the cost behavior within the activities, reflecting the links that these have with other activities and relationships that affect them.

The [[Activity Based Costing]] (ABC) approach relates [[indirect cost]] to the activities that drive them to be incurred. 
Activity Based Costing is based on the belief that activities cause costs and therefore a link should be established between activities and product. The cost drivers thus are the link between the activities and the cost.

Generally, the cost driver for short term indirect [[variable costs]] may be the volume of output/activity; but for long term indirect variable costs, the cost drivers will not be related to volume of output/activity.

In traditional costing the cost driver to allocate indirect cost to cost objects was volume of output. With the change in business structures, technology and thereby cost structures it was found that the volume of output was not the only cost driver. 
John Shank and Vijay Govindarajan list cost drivers into two categories:&lt;ref&gt;''Strategic Cost Management: The New Tool for Competitive Advantage'' by Shank and Govindarajan&lt;/ref&gt;
Structural cost drivers that are derived from the business strategic choices about its underlying economic structure such as scale and scope of operations, complexity of products, use of technology, etc., and
Executional cost drivers that are derived from the execution of the business activities such as [[capacity utilization]], plant layout, work-force involvement, etc.
Resource cost Driver is measure of quantity of resources consumed by an activity. It is used to assign cost of a resource to activity or cost pool.
Activity Cost Driver is measure of frequency and intensity of demand placed on activities by cost object. It is used to assign activity costs to cost objects.

To carry out a [[value chain]] analysis, ABC is a necessary tool. To carry out ABC, it is necessary that cost drivers are established for different cost pools.

==Examples==
Some examples of indirect costs and their drivers are: indirect costs for maintenance, with the possible driver of this cost being the number of machine hours; or, the indirect cost of handling raw-material cost, which may be driven by the number of orders received; or, inspection costs that are driven by the number of inspections or the hours of inspection or production runs. In marketing, cost drivers are  Number of advertisements, Number of sales personnel etc. In Customer service, cost drivers are Number of service calls attended, number of staff in service department, number of warranties handled, Hours spent on servicing etc..

== Biography ==
Hawk received a B.Arch in Engineering from [[Iowa State University]] in 1971, a M.Arch. and a M.C.Planning in Fine Arts from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1974, and a Ph.D. in [[Systems Sciences]] in Corporate Planning from the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia in 1979. His dissertation ''Regulation of Environmental Deterioration'' was Chaired by [[Russell L. Ackoff]] and supervised by [[Eric Trist]].&lt;ref name= "DH 2010"&gt;[http://davidhawk.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/CV-for-David-Hawk-October-2010.pdf David L. Hawk, Resume]. 2010. Accessed Jan 22, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D.L. Hawk. (2008) "[http://isss.org/world/en/20080717-0905-isss-hawk The Business Educators Dilemma: Teaching Analytics to those who Strive to Manage Systems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927101024/http://isss.org/world/en/20080717-0905-isss-hawk |date=2011-09-27 }}", in: ''Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Conference of ISSS''. July 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Its research basis was on the 1975 US Legal Order system of regulation leading to climate change and other unmitigated consequences. The research proposed "Negotiated Order" as a more viable way to avoid ethical cynicism found in US trained lawyers and lead to serious reduction in the human impact on the larger environment of the world. Twenty major companies and ten nations helped with the research done via the Stockholm School of Economics. Sweden's Prime Minister presented the results to OECD. 

Before starting his academic career in 1974 Hawk worked in industry after serving in the U.S. Army in the Republic of Vietnam from 1966 to 1968. From 1968 to 1974 he had a series of jobs such as design engineer for ACCO Loudon; architectural designer in Darmstadt, Germany; farm manager in Brighton, Iowa; Civic designer and planning officer at Westminster City Council, London, England in 1971-72; and designer and corporate researcher for multiple public and private organizations in the Philadelphia region from 1972 to 1974.&lt;ref name="DH 2012"/&gt;

Hawk started working as research associate at the Wharton School in 1974. He was a visiting researcher and faculty member at the Stockholm School of Economics from 1975 to 1977, then a visiting faculty member until 1996. From 1978 to 1981 he was an assistant Professor at Colleges of Engineering and Design of the Iowa State University, where he coordinated the graduate studies in Architecture. In 1981 he started at the [[New Jersey Institute of Technology]], was an associate dean in 1983-85 while designing several graduate programs. He became NJIT's only dual professor in 1991 in management at the School of Management,&lt;ref&gt;[http://som.njit.edu/people/hawk.php David L. Hawk profile at the School of Management, NJIT]&lt;/ref&gt; and in architecture at the College of Architecture and Design at NJIT.&lt;ref&gt;[http://design.njit.edu/people/hawk.php David L. Hawk profile at the College of Architecture and Design at NJIT] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110701201421/http://design.njit.edu/people/hawk.php |date=2011-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2006 to 2008 he also served as Dean at the School of Management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.njit.edu/news/2006/2006-251.php NJIT Newsroom, Jun 6 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1989 to 1991 he was on leave from NJIT and back at the Institute of International Business of the [[Stockholm School of Economics]], and from 1998 to 1999 was on another leave and with the [[Helsinki University of Technology]]&lt;ref name="DH 2012"/&gt;

From 1994 to 1996 Hawk was at Bell Labs AT&amp;T as an Industrial Ecology Fellow developing new models for reduced pollution via industrial redesign.&lt;ref name="DLH 1996"/&gt; In 2001, he was honored as a Master Teacher at NJIT.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.njit.edu/provost/teachingandresearch/master-teachers.php Master Teachers], NJIT Office of the Provost. Accessed Jan 22, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; He serves as Senior Adviser to one of China's largest firms, [[China State Construction Engineering|China State Construction]]. In 2003 hawk began serving two years on the Congressional Commission set up to study the role of business in government leadership: ''Committee on Business Strategies for Public Capital Investment'', for the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GSThaCgH1VwC&amp;pg=PT4&amp;lpg=PT4&amp;dq=%22david+l+hawk%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22david%20l%20hawk%22&amp;f=false Investments in federal facilities: asset management strategies for the 21st century]&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 2010 Hawk was formally fired by NJIT's President Altenkirch for being 1) "non-collegial" to faculty missing their classes, for 2) opposing the President's initiative to get students to pay for bringing NCAA to NJIT, 3) for Hawk developing close ties to Tsinghua University in Beijing, which the President had never heard of, 4) for hiring a friend that was one of the world's leading researchers into international entrepreneurship thus attracting $2 million for a Chair in NJ Entrepreneurship that Hawk refused to use for an athletics expansion on campus, 5) for spending $415 on mini bar expenses in a Beijing Hotel, that turned out to be $30 and was for bottles of coke and Evian Water, not any alcohol. NJIT legal team continued to argue that Evian is French Liquor, not water, and that China uses US Dollars as its currency, not Yuan. NJIT pressed another 20 charges like these against Hawk, then resorted to "hiring" a NJ judge via the NJ Judicial Code to review the charges at $500/hour for 18 months and "objectively" find Hawk guilty of 1 of the 25 charges.  The judge was very nice and quite smart, but could not work his way from a Faustian Dilemma. 

Hawk continued to advise a number of foreign corporate leaders on US investments. Since 2008 they stopped investing in New Jersey based on the NJIT vs. Hawk case being on a cloud website in Chinese and German. Based on his familiarity with Donald Trump and how a growing number of Hawk's white male students liking the Donald Style, although the female students did not, Hawk initiated the Eternal Feminine Foundation in 2015.  It now manages around $700 million where it supports young poor girls in college attendance (not NJIT) via 6%/year.  Its investments take in about 10%/year.  Wealthy businessmen with daughters continue to donate money to the Foundation's objective of keeping men like Trump from inheriting leadership positions while also preparing females to manage the consequences of failure in this objective.  The 2015 beginning of the Foundation seems like a long way in the past. 

Hawk is also Director of Center of Corporate Rehabilitation on his farm in Iowa.

Margaret Stroebe and Henk Schut studied [[grief]] in "The Dual Process Model of Coping with Bereavement: A Decade On".  In this study, the models of [[Coping (psychology)|coping]] were examined and how it could be of benefit compared to others.  They came up with a dual process model to represent human grief. They explain coping with [[Grief|bereavement]], a state of loss can be a combination of accepting and confronting it. It informs on how the combination of healthy emotional [[catharsis]] and changing perspective can be a good and healthy process to cope.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stroebe|first=Margaret|last2=Schut|first2=Henk|date=1999|title=The Dual Process Model of Coping with Bereavement: Rationale and Description|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/074811899201046|journal=Death Studies|volume=23|issue=3|pages=197–224|doi=10.1080/074811899201046|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being able to confront the situation and also deal with everyday life events allows the person to live their lives with desired states of stability in a subjective post-loss world in which bereaved persons find themselves (Parkes, 1993){{Full citation needed|date=April 2018}}.

==Coping==
Bereavement and the adjective bereaved derive from a verb, 'reave', which means "to despoil, rob, or forcibly deprive" according to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]]. Thus, a bereaved person is one who has been deprived, robbed, plundered, or stripped of someone or something that they valued. Reaction to this state or impact of loss is called grief. According to Lazarus and Folkman (1984),{{Full citation needed|date=April 2018}} coping strategies are the "constantly changing cognitive and behavioural efforts to manage specific external and/or internal demands that are appraised as taxing on or exceeding the resources of the person". People vary in the ways that they grieve and also in the way that they cope. But, acknowledging it and allowing themselves to go through the motions will allow them to cope in a healthy way. To cope with the loss, the person requires to relearn the world around them and simultaneously make a multifaceted transition from loving in presence to loving in absence (Attig, 2001).{{Full citation needed|date=April 2018}} A healthy relocation of the deceased internally and maintaining a healthy dynamic connectedness/relationship is observed to provide solace to the grieving, but the weightage differed in [[Cultural pluralism|pluralistic]] cultural settings. Grievers will go through times of extreme sadness and also times where they are numb to what has happened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t6ISrB6wpb0C&amp;pg=PA71|title=Loss, Bereavement and Grief: A Guide to Effective Caring|author1=Spall|first=Bob|author2=Callis|first2=Stephen|date=January 1997|publisher=Nelson Thornes|year=|isbn=978-0-7487-3322-4|location=|pages=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of appropriate coping can bring many ailments to a person including mental and physical ailments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Richardson|first=Virginia E.|date=2010-12-01|title=The Dual Process Model of Coping with Bereavement: A Decade Later|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.2190/OM.61.4.a|journal=OMEGA - Journal of Death and Dying|volume=61|issue=4|pages=269–271|doi=10.2190/OM.61.4.a|via=SAGE Journals}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coping through mourning in a state of bereavement is advised in the [[Bible]] as "Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted."&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 5:4, NRSV&lt;/ref&gt; Because it helps to achieve growth through thorough acceptance of loss, the transforming capacity of profound human experiences. Freud in 1959 through an article called this as a process of "working through" the grief. Healthy coping is achieved when the bereaved person is enabled to go forward with healthy, productive living by effortfully developing "new normals" to guide that living which is characterized by lesser stressful demands compared to initial phase of grief.

Greenblatt has reviewed spousal mourning is essential for transition. He describes 4 phases of mourning: the initial reaction of shock, numbness, denial and disbelief; followed by pining,  yearning,  depression then in a healthy environment resolution phase begins with emancipation from the loved one and readjustment to the new environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greenblatt|first=M.|date=1978-01-01|title=The grieving spouse|url=https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/ajp.135.1.43|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=135|issue=1|pages=43–47|doi=10.1176/ajp.135.1.43|issn=0002-953X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dual process model==
===Loss oriented===
The loss oriented process focuses on coping with bereavement, the loss itself, recognizing it and accepting it. In this process a person will express feelings of grief with all the losses that occur from losing their loved one. There will be many changes from work to family and friendships. There might also be demographic changes and even economic ones. During this time, people either acknowledge these changes head or [[Rumination (psychology)|ruminate]] on feelings of lose which might lead to distorted, [[Complicated grief disorder|complicated]] or [[Prolonged grief disorder|prolonged]] grief. The loss oriented process will bring on a lot of yearning, irritability, despair, anxiety and depression. During this process they are only concentrated on their pain that this loss has caused. Lack or denial of early adaptive acknowledgement that they will no longer speak to deceased or see them again might instigate compulsive and self-destructive behaviors. People attached with the deceased have to reconfigure their identity as an autonomous being. These process in a non-resilient griever can appear overwhelming, and associated guilt can be exported over friends and family in an assumptive effort which might affect interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fasse|first=Léonor|last2=Zech|first2=Emmanuelle|date=2015|title=The Dual Process Model of Coping with Bereavement in the test of the subjective experiences of bereaved spouses.

===Restoration oriented===
In restoration-oriented process, the loss of the loved one is accepted and attachments with the deceased are relinquished. These include focusing on the new roles in their post loss reality and responsibilities in lives. The restoration-oriented process incorporates endurance through reconstruction of perspective by taking over grief, grieving thoughts are adjusted adaptively by creating new meanings with the deceased. The restoration process is a confrontation process, that allows the person to adjust with the world without the deceased. People in this process can feel subjective oscillations of pride and grief related stressors in the avoidance [[mentalization]]. This process allows the person to live their daily life as a changed individual without being consumed by the grieving they are facing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bennett|first=Kate M.|last2=Gibbons|first2=Kerry|last3=MacKenzie-Smith|first3=Suzanna|date=2010-12-01|title=Loss and Restoration in Later Life: An Examination of Dual Process Model of Coping with Bereavement|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.2190/OM.61.4.d|journal=OMEGA - Journal of Death and Dying|volume=61|issue=4|pages=315–332|doi=10.2190/OM.61.4.d|via=SAGE Journals}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jeffreys2004"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jrr1eB4lsuEC&amp;pg=PA46|title=Helping Grieving People: A Handbook for Care Providers|author=Jeffreys|first=J.

Rando calls the letting go process as emancipation from bondage due to the strength required for change and recovery.

==Conclusion==
The dual process model of coping takes into consideration that everyone will have stressful life events, while they are coping with bereavement. Their lives will continue and so will the problems associated with it. There will be many situations that will take them away from grieving. These situations can either benefit them or affect them negatively if they allow them to. Being aware and prepared to change can allow them to continue and deal with post loss life events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stroebe|first=Margaret|last2=Schut|first2=Henk|date=2010-12-01|title=The Dual Process Model of Coping with Bereavement: A Decade on|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2190/OM.61.4.b|journal=OMEGA - Journal of Death and Dying|volume=61|issue=4|pages=273–289|doi=10.2190/OM.61.4.b|via=SAGE Journals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Emilio Estefan Gómez''' (born March 4, 1953) is a Cuban-American musician and producer of Lebanese heritage. Emilio has won 19 Grammy Awards. Estefan first came to prominence as a member of the [[Miami Sound Machine]]. He is the husband of singer [[Gloria Estefan]], father of son Nayib Estefan and daughter [[Emily Estefan]], and the uncle of Spanish-language television personality [[Lili Estefan]].

==Background==
Emilio Estefan Gómez was born on March 4, 1953 in Santiago de Cuba, Cuba to Emilio Estefan, Sr. (c. 1920–2003)&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2003/scene/people-news/emilio-estefan-sr-1117883638/|title=Emilio Estefan Sr.|last=Staff|first=Variety|date=March 26, 2003|work=Variety|access-date=October 9, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Carmen Maria Gómez (1921–2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9F0LAAAAYAAJ&amp;q|title=Who's who in Florida's Latin Community: Biographical Dictionary of the Hispanics in Florida|date=1986|publisher=Worldwide Reference Publications|isbn=9780921261001|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carmen's parents Antonio Gómez and Carmen Vasquez were Spanish immigrants who met while the latter was working for the [[Bacardi]] family. Cuban-born Emilio Sr. was the second-to last child in his family (which consisted of eleven siblings), and he had Lebanese ancestry from his paternal side—many of whom were textile traders that traveled throughout Cuba and the Caribbean. Emilio Sr. was raised by his widowed mother Julia, as his father had died when he was still a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oKdtdvvoAukC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq|title=The Rhythm of Success: How an Immigrant Produced his Own American Dream|last=Estefan|first=Emilio|date=January 5, 2010|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9781101159750|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1967, at the age of fourteen, Estefan and his father Emilio Sr. fled Cuba for Spain due to the [[Cuban Revolution]]. The Estefan family planned to reunite in the United States and, as a result, Carmen chose to remain behind because she did not want to abandon her parents. In addition, Estefan's older brother José (b. 1945) was drafted in the military and could not leave Cuba until 1980.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For about a year, Estefan and his father lived an impoverished life in Spain before relocating permanently in Miami, Florida. Although circumstances were far better in Miami, Estefan and Emilio Sr. still struggled as they lived in a cramped house with Estefan's aunt and 8 cousins.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aarp.org/entertainment/music/info-08-2013/gloria-emilio-estefan-aarp-magazine-story.html|title=Latin Pop Icon Gloria Estefan and Emilio Estefan, Multilingual CD The ...|last=Nash|first=Alanna|work=AARP|access-date=October 9, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estefan did not reunite with his mother until 1971 when she was finally able to immigrate to the United States. 

It was during his formative years that Estefan cultivated his musical sensibilities, as he had often used his accordion-playing skills to earn enough tips to support his father and family.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/gloria-and-emilio-estefan-build-a-music-empire-and-a-family-compound-1448988567|title=Gloria and Emilio Estefan Build a Music Empire and a Family Compound|date=December 1, 2015|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=October 9, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional career==

=== Early music ===
{{further|Miami Sound Machine|Gloria Estefan}}
In 1975, Gloria and her cousin Mercedes "Merci" Navarro (1957–2007)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/alt.obituaries/NoP1roy_xFA/TXIR2gsE7hcJ|title=Mercedes Navarro Murciano, 50, original member of Miami Sound Machine dead|last=|first=|date=|website=groups.google.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; met Estefan while performing at a church ensemble rehearsal. Estefan, who had formed the band the Miami Latin Boys earlier that year, learned about Gloria through a mutual acquaintance. While the Miami Latin Boys were performing at a Cuban wedding at Hotel Dupont, Gloria and Merci (who were wedding guests) performed two Cuban standards impromptu. They impressed the Miami Latin Boys so much that they were invited to join the band permanently with the band's name changing to [[Miami Sound Machine]]. Gloria, who was attending the University of Miami at the time, only agreed to perform during the weekends so that her studies would not be interrupted.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/gloria-and-emilio-estefan-build-a-music-empire-and-a-family-compound-1448988567|title=Gloria and Emilio Estefan Build a Music Empire and a Family Compound|date=December 1, 2015|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=October 9, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Eventually, [[Miami Sound Machine]] would perform with Gloria Estefan (née Fajardo) as the lead singer and headliner.

=== Producer ===
As a producer, Estefan has shaped the careers of several music superstars. He has also produced various events for both general market and Hispanic market television. These events include the [[Latin Grammys]], Hispanic Heritage Awards, Nuestra Navidad, and some high-profile productions on HBO and Showtime. He has also produced many musical events at the White House.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/emilio-estefan-20th-television-latino-drama-series-361830|title=Emilio Estefan to Develop Latino-Themed Drama Series Under New Pact With 20th TV|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=October 10, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Estefan produced and directed his first full-length documentary ''90 Millas'' to showcase the history and pioneers of Cuban music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.emilioestefanjr.com/director|title=Emilio Estefan – Director|last=FCab|first=Estefan Enterprises|website=Emilio Estefan|language=en|access-date=October 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Estefan gathered dozens of [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]] entertainers in 2010 to record [[Michael Jackson]]'s "[[We Are The World]]" in Spanish. The [[Spanish language]] version, already written by Estefan and approved by [[Quincy Jones]], became "[[Somos El Mundo]]". It premiered during ''[[El Show de Cristina#El Show de Cristina|El Show de Cristina]]'' on March 1, 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/viral-videos/959197/somos-el-mundo-video-premieres-stars-pitbull-shakira-juanes|title='Somos El Mundo' Video Premieres, Stars Pitbull, Shakira, Juanes, David Archuleta, Daddy Yankee – Viral Videos|author=|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=November 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the funds went to the [[Humanitarian response by non-governmental organizations to the 2010 Haiti earthquake|Haiti relief]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thesilvertongueonline.com/?p=9635t|title=Latino Celebrities Join Together for "Somos El Mundo" Recording|author=|date=February 20, 2010|publisher=Thesilvertongueonline.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160222013634/http://thesilvertongueonline.com/?p=9635t|archive-date=February 22, 2016|dead-url=yes|accessdate=November 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/959303/50-latin-stars-gather-to-record-somos-el-mundo|title=50 Latin Stars Gather To Record 'Somos El Mundo'|date=September 14, 2009|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=November 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, in 2010, Estefan released his book ''The Rhythm of Success – How an Immigrant Produced his own American Dream.'' The following year, Estefan presented the book ''The Exile Experience: A Journey to Freedom'' in collaboration with writer [[Carlos Pintado]] and journalist [[Carlos Alberto Montaner]], which included the personal testimonials from different generations of exiles.

''The Exile Experience: Journey to Freedom'' is published in three separate editions – each tailor-made for those who arrived through Operation Pedro Pan, the Freedom Flights and the Mariel boatlift. Each edition features the names of every Cuban who arrived via one of those three exoduses, and there has been an accumulation of 400,000 and more names amongst the three editions published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://shop.booksandbooks.com/emilio_estefan_exile_experience|title=Emilio Estefan – The Exile Experience – Gables {{!}} Books &amp; Books|website=shop.booksandbooks.com|language=en|access-date=October 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He partnered with the Nederlander Group in 2013 to produce the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical extravaganza, ''[[On Your Feet!]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadway.com/buzz/177119/gloria-and-emilio-estefans-on-your-feet-sets-broadway-dates-theater/|title=Gloria and Emilio Estefan's on Your Feet!

''On Your Feet!'' premiered on Broadway in October 2015.

Estefan also became an [[AARP]] Life Reimagined ambassador&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aarp.org/work/experts/emilio-estefan/|title=Emilio Estefan, Life Reimagined Ambassador – AARP|work=AARP|accessdate=December 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2013. In his new role, Emilio shares his expertise on a variety of subjects, including his passion for living, [[mentoring]], [[entrepreneur]]ship, [[philanthropy]], and much more.

In February 2014, Estefan directed and produced the documentary film ''An Unbreakable Bond'' about the real''-''life story of father-son duo Marc and Nick Buoniconti's undying commitment towards finding a cure for paralysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.miamiherald.com/living/health-fitness/article177562581.html|title=Marc Buoniconti — paralyzed at 19 — says hit on the football field ‘saved my life’|work=miamiherald|access-date=October 10, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film premiered at National &amp; International film festivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themiamiproject.org/unbreakablebond|title=An Unbreakable Bond – The Buoniconti Fund|publisher=Themiamiproject.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219233946/http://www.themiamiproject.org/unbreakablebond|archivedate=December 19, 2014|deadurl=yes|accessdate=December 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Gloria Estefan and Emilio Estefan at 2014 MIFF.jpg|thumb|[[Gloria Estefan|Gloria]] &amp; Emilio Estefan at the 2014 [[Miami International Film Festival]] premiere of ''An Unbreakable Bond'']]
In early 2014, in a decision unanimously approved by the County Commission, Estefan was appointed Miami-Dade Special Ambassador&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miamidade.gov/district02/releases/2013-12-19-emilio-ambassador.asp|title=Miami-Dade County – District 2 –  News Release|publisher=Miamidade.gov|accessdate=December 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Miami-Dade County Commissioner [[Jean Monestime]]. In his unpaid
four-year non-partisan role, Emilio was set to represent the Miami-Dade community at an international level to encourage and promote the diversity of business and trade. During the same year, Estefan and Botrán Rum created a strategic marketing alliance including a personal endorsement by Estefan. Through his role, Estefan will help promote the brand throughout the U.S., leading a multi-channel marketing campaign with the mantra "The Night Begins with Botran."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2014/02/emilio-estefan-fronts-new-botran-rum-campaign/|title=Emilio Estefan fronts new Botran Rum campaign|access-date=October 10, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Estefan sits as the second vice-chair to the Commission for the [[National Museum of the American Latino]], a bi-partisan commission charged with exploring the possibility of creating a National Latino Museum in Washington D.C.

'''Eric Harrison Broadley''' [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] (22 September 1928 – 28 May 2017) was a British entrepreneur, engineer, and founder and chief designer of [[Lola Racing Cars|Lola Cars]], the motor racing manufacturer and engineering company. He was arguably one of the most influential automobile designers of the post-war period, and over the years Lola had a hand in many high-profile projects in [[Formula One]], [[Champ car|IndyCar]], and [[sports car racing]]. Broadley sold Lola to [[Martin Birrane]] in 1999.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Eric Broadley trained as an architect in the late 1940s, and after completing his studies took a job as a [[quantity surveyor]].&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;Williams (2017)&lt;/ref&gt; In his spare time Broadley was heavily involved in motor racing with the [[750 Motor Club]]. In common with the majority of other competitors – including [[Colin Chapman]], [[Frank Costin]] and [[Brian Hart]] – he built his own cars around [[Austin 7]] chassis, using home-made and [[Property|proprietary]] parts. His first car, the ''Broadley Special'')&lt;ref&gt;Twite, Mike, "Lola: A prolific racing builder", in Northey, Tom, ed. ''World of Automobiles'' (London: Orbis, 1974), Volume 11, p.1213, calls her ''Lola Special''.&lt;/ref&gt; was built in 1956&lt;ref name="Twite, p.1213"&gt;Twite, p.1213.&lt;/ref&gt; to comply with rules governing the "Ford Ten Special" (or "1172 Special"&lt;ref name="Twite, p.1213"/&gt;) class, using an 1172cc (72ci) [[Flathead engine|side valve]] engine, originally introduced for the pre-war [[Ford Model C Ten|Ford Model C]].

The Broadley Special was an instant success, winning a number of local and national events in the UK. On the back of this record Broadley, at the request of a number of drivers seeking something besides a [[Lotus Eleven|Lotus XI]],&lt;ref name="Twite, p.1213"/&gt; immediately began to design a chassis to accept a more powerful 1098cc&lt;ref name="Twite, p.1213"/&gt; (67ci) [[Coventry Climax]] engine and [[British Motor Corporation|BMC]] [[BMC A-Series engine|A-series]] [[gearbox]].&lt;ref name="Twite, p.1213"/&gt; This car, with its up-to-the-minute [[space frame]] chassis, was to become the [[Lola Mk1]], named after the song "[[Whatever Lola Wants]]" from the contemporary musical ''[[Damn Yankees]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/cref-broeri.html |title=People: Eric Broadley|work=grandprix.com|accessdate=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although, as Broadley freely admits, the Mk1 was too powerful for his level of driving skill [http://www.lolaheritage.co.uk/history/story.htm], in 1958 he became the first man ever to lap the [[Brands Hatch]] Indy circuit in under one minute. Once she was sorted, she beat the XIs "with monotonous regularity" (notably in the hands of [[Peter Ashdown]], who racked up at least a score of wins, including a class win and sixth overall at the 1959 [[RAC Tourist Trophy|Tourist Trophy]].&lt;ref name="Twite, p.1213"/&gt; Her success soon attracted the interest of other [[Privateer (motorsport)|privateer]]s, so Broadley and his cousin were prevailed upon in 1958 to build three further copies. [[Lola Racing Cars|Lola Cars Ltd.]] was born.

Staying largely at [[Bromley]],&lt;ref name="Twite, p.1213"/&gt; Broadley set up shop in [[West Byfleet]], Surrey, using [[pound sterling|£]]2000 of his own savings, producing thirty-five&lt;ref name="Twite, p.1213"/&gt; more Mk1s through 1962,&lt;ref name="Twite, p.1214"&gt;Twite, p.1214.&lt;/ref&gt; all with the Coventry-Climax.&lt;ref name="Twite, p.1214"/&gt; with ever-improving results on the track. Despite its limited experience, in 1960 Lola produced its first single-seat [[Open wheel car|open-wheeled]] model: the [[Lola Mk2|Mark 2]], for [[Formula Junior]]. Performance was promising rather than outstanding, and its front engine was a mistake, as the formula was soon to become dominated by rear and mid-engined cars.&lt;ref name="Twite, p.1214"/&gt; Despite these drawbacks, and only scoring one win in the 1960 season, forty-two examples were sold.&lt;ref name="Twite, p.1214"/&gt; Redesigned for 1961,&lt;ref name="Twite, p.1214"/&gt; the [[mid-engine]]d [[Lola Mk3|Mk3]] consistently finished behind contemporary Lotuses and [[Cooper Car Company|Cooper]]s.

===Formula One and international fame===

On the back of his initial success, and despite his inexperience (and the failure of the Mark 2), in 1961 Broadley was approached by [[Reg Parnell]] to design and build a [[Formula One]] chassis for his [[Bowmaker-Yeoman Racing Team]]. The [[Lola Mk4]] featured the usual [[superleggera|tubular]] spaceframe, with an innovative front [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] using lower [[Control arm|wishbone]]s and upper [[transverse link]]s with [[radius arm]]s, while the rear had upper and lower transverse links and radius arm; Broadley's idea continued to be used into the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Twite, p.1214"/&gt; The Mark 4 originally used the common Coventry-Climax four, while a 1.5-litre&lt;ref&gt;Twite, p.1217 caption.&lt;/ref&gt; (91ci) [[V8 engine|V8]] later became available. Though [[John Surtees]] and [[Roy Salvadori]] proved quick in them,&lt;ref name="Twite, p.1214"/&gt; and a one was put on the [[pole position|pole]] in its first ever race, the [[1962 Dutch Grand Prix]], by Surtees, the car failed to finish. Surtees went on to win the [[2000 Guineas (motor racing)|2000 Guineas]] at [[Mallory Park]], and placed second at the [[1962 British Grand Prix|British]] and [[1962 German Grand Prix|German]] [[Formula One|Grands Prix]].&lt;ref name="Twite, p.1214"/&gt;

Bowmaker-Yeoman got out of Grand Prix at the end of 1962, selling their Mark 4s to the [[Tasman Series|Tasman Racing Series]]; here, Surtees and teammate [[Tony Maggs]] did quite well, with Surtees winning the [[New Zealand Grand Prix]]&lt;ref name="Twite, p.1214"/&gt; (not a [[World Championship]] event). For 1963, Parnell sold one to [[Bob Anderson (racing driver)|Bob Anderson]] and ran another for [[Chris Amon]], who was rarely successful, though he ran seventh in the British Grand Prix; Anderson did better, winning the (non-championship) [[Rome Grand Prix]] as a privateer.&lt;ref name="Twite, p.1214"/&gt; 

Efforts on a Formula Junior car, Mark 5, through 1962 led to nine sales but only limited success; an improved Mark 5A gave [[Richard Attwood]] a win in the [[Monaco Grand Prix]] Junior event.&lt;ref name="Twite, p.1214"/&gt; 

The 1963 Racing Car Show debuted the sensational Mark 6 (Lola GT), a trendsetter into the '70s. It featured a [[Ford]] 4.2-litre (255ci) V8 and [[Valerio Colotti|Colotti]] four-speed box under a sleek [[fiberglass]] body, showing good handling and "a remarkable turn of speed"&lt;ref name="Twite, p.1215"&gt;Twite, p.1215.&lt;/ref&gt; for only 250&amp;nbsp;hp (186&amp;nbsp;kW), enough to put it in the running for the 1963 [[24 Hours of Le Mans|''Vingt-Quatre Heurs du Mans'']] until the gearbox balked and [[David Hobbs (racing driver)|David Hobbs]] crashed.&lt;ref name="Twite, p.1215"/&gt;

This performance attracted the attention of Ford, who were looking for a way to win Le Mans, and offered Broadley a two-year deal to redesign the GT, setting up Ford Advanced Vehicles, in a factory on the [[Slough Trading Estate]]; it produced the [[Ford GT-40|GT-40]], which differed in many respects from the Mark 6, not least in using a steel chassis rather than the aluminium of the Mark 6. This was one of many points at which Broadley found himself at odds with his American employers.&lt;ref name="Twite, p.1215"/&gt;

Broadley, used to being his own boss, quit after 12 months, and as the FAV factory was in the name of Lola Cars, retained the plant forcing Ford to move to a different factory on the estate.&lt;ref&gt; Wyer, John "The Certain Sound" (Lausanne: Automobile Year, 1981) p.128&lt;/ref&gt; The first cars from the newly independent company were the new Mark 5As for [[Midland Racing Partnership]] (as used by Attwood), now redesignated Mark 53. The derivative Mark 54 [[Formula Two]] single-seater, also used by Midlands, gave Attwood seconds at [[Pau Grand Prix|Pau]], [[Albi]], and the [[Nürburgring]], while Maggs came second at [[Aintree]].&lt;ref name="Twite, p.1215"/&gt; A [[monocoque]] single-seater for F2 and [[Formula Three|F3]], the T60, was introduced in 1965; five were built, but were not a success, and the development models, T61 and T62, bought by Midlands and six other customers, were no better.&lt;ref name="Twite, p.1216"&gt;Twite, p.1216.&lt;/ref&gt; The other 1965 debut, the T70, was just the opposite, "destined to become one of the most successful and long lived of sports cars".&lt;ref name="Twite, p.1215"/&gt; Offered with 5.4 or 6.2-litre (327ci or 377ci) [[Chevrolet]] and [[Hewland]] four-speed or [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] five-speed, and patterned on the Mark 6 and GT-40, it was nevertheless fresh, and was almost as big a revelation as its older sibling.&lt;ref name="Twite, p.1215"/&gt; [[FIA]] created Group 9 (later [[Can-Am|Group 7]]) just for the T70, while Surtees drove one in British races, including a [[Guards Trophy]] victory at [[Brands Hatch]] in a [[Factory-backed|works]] car.&lt;ref name="Twite, p.1216"/&gt; Fifteen were sold in 1965, as well as thirty-two of the improved Mk2, introduced in 1966.&lt;ref name="Twite, p.1216"/&gt;

In his first venture at [[Indy 500|Indianapolis]], Broadley's Type 80, with the 4.2-litre Ford, were unsuccessful. For 1966, team owner [[John Mecom]] ordered three improved T90s for [[Jackie Stewart]], [[Graham Hill]], and [[Rodger Ward]]; Stewart's fell out in the lead on Lap 190, giving Hill the win. A heavily modified T90 would put [[Al Unser]] in second in 1967.&lt;ref name="Twite, p.1216"/&gt;

Improving the T70 in 1967, Broadley came up against the [[McLaren (racing)|McLaren]] juggernaut in [[Can-Am]] and scored only one win, Surtees' at [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]. To qualify for European [[prototype]] racing, Broadley designed a [[coupe|coupé]] body for the heavy, unreliable [[Aston Martin]] [[camshaft|twin cam]] engine. This led to retirements at the Ring and LeMans, so Surtees switched to the reliable 5.7-litre (350ci) Chevrolet, revealing fragility in the suspension. Even so, Hawkins/Epstein took the [[1000km Spa|Spa 1000km]] and Hawkins/Love second at the [[Kyalami]] [[Kyalami Nine Hours|Nine Hours]] in privateers.&lt;ref name="Twite, p.1216"/&gt; Finally [[homologation|homologated]] as a [[Group 4 (racing)|Group 4]] coupé with Chevy engine in 1968, and despite poor performance in the World Championship due to lack of works support, it sold over one hundred copies to privateers. Prime among them was [[Denny Hulme]], winning the [[RAC Tourist Trophy|Tourist Trophy]] that year, for starters.&lt;ref name="Twite, p.1216"/&gt; Developed as the Mk3B (officially T76) in 1969, with new bodywork and lighter weight, it went to private buyers such as [[Frank Gardner (driver)|Frank Gardner]], [[Trevor Taylor (racing driver)|Trevor Taylor]], [[Paul Hawkins (racing driver)|Paul Hawkins]], and [[Mike de Udy]], who picked up wins in [[SCCA]] events during 1969–70, as well as its first World Championship sports car race, in the hands of [[Mark Donohue]] and [[Chuck Parsons]] at the [[24 Hours of Daytona]] (a one-two Lola finish), plus second by [[Jo Bonnier]] and [[Herbert Müller (racing driver)|Herbert Muller]] at the [[Austrian 1000km]], giving Lola third in the championship.&lt;ref name="Twite, p.1216"/&gt;

[[File:Lola T142 Chevrolet of Brenton Griguol.jpg|thumb|Lola T142 [[Formula 5000]]]]
Nor did Broadley neglect single-seaters. In 1967, he created an all-new monocoque, the F2 T100, only to waste considerable effort and money on the problematic [[BMW]] radial-valve engine; after a switch to the [[Cosworth|Cosworth FVA]], it was a competitor, giving Surtees wins at [[Zolder]] and Mallory Park and second at [[Reims]]. It would later be revised as the T102 and supplied to BMW. The same year, Broadley's new [[Formula One]] T110, jointly with Surtees, was abandoned. The chassis for [[Honda]]'s F1 car, also in 1967, came out a touch overweight, but light enough to win the [[Italian Grand Prix]]. Making use of the American 5-litre [[stock block]]s and T70 suspension for [[Formula A]], Broadley built the spaceframe T140 once-seater; it became T142 for the British equivalent, [[Formula 5000]].&lt;ref name="Twite, p.1216"/&gt; 

In 1968, Broadley returned to Indianapolis with the T150, suitable for either two- or four-wheel-drive; four-wheel-drive proved preferable, but even the greater traction could not prevent Unser from crashing.&lt;ref name="Twite, p.1216"/&gt; He also prepared the T160, to replace the outclassed T70, for Can-Am, providing several to American privateers, while Surtees, who planned to run a Chevy-powered [[Weslake]]-prepared car, broke with Lola and was uncompetitive.&lt;ref name="Twite, p.1216"/&gt;

For 1969, Broadley's T162 Can-Am car was run over by the dominant McLarens, and only seven were built. The subsequent T163 was little better, though Parsons earned one second and two-thirds.&lt;ref name="Twite, p.1216"/&gt; Additionally, the new T190 FA/F5000 car had a [[monocoque]], more advanced than the T142, but a handful to drive.&lt;ref name="Twite, p.1216"/&gt; Partly in response, Frank Gardner was brought on board, perfecting the T190 so it was competitive, scoring wins at [[Thruxton Circuit|Thruxton]] and [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]], and getting Broadley's attention. Broadley stretched it further, into the T192, and asked Gardner to oversee development testing from then on.&lt;ref name="Twite, p.1217"&gt;Twite, p.1217.&lt;/ref&gt;

Offerings in Formula Two, [[Formula Three]], [[Formula Ford]], [[Formula Vee]], [[Formula Super Vee]], [[Formula Atlantic]], and Can-Am kept Broadley very busy in the '70s.&lt;ref name="Twite, p.1217"/&gt; By 1972, Lola were virtually alone in providing customer cars. They were as quick as ever, as the T280 (built by request of Jo Bonnier) demonstrated, but they were still hampered by the absence of a dedicated development team,&lt;ref name="Twite, p.1218"&gt;Twite, p.1218.&lt;/ref&gt; despite Gardner's presence. For all that, and for all the "bewildering variety", few Lolas were real failures.&lt;ref name="Twite, p.1218"/&gt;

Globally, [[India]] ranks as the 2nd largest freelance workforce after the US with over 15 million people working independently in various sectors such as [[Information technology|IT]] and [[Programming language|programming]], finance, sales and marketing, designing, animation, videography, content and [[academic writing]]. By 2020, 50% of workers are expected to go freelance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/60-of-freelancers-in-india-are-under-30/articleshow/64743696.cms|title=Infographic: 60% of freelancers in India are under 30 - Times of India|website=The Times of India|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Government  ==
There has not been much effort from India's government towards assisting freelancers until recently when it set up the ''Digital India Platform'' (DIP), an initiative to digitalize all government documents and where freelancers would be hired to help carry out the task. Anyone with a knowledge of computers, has access to the Internet and owns a valid Aadhar card would be eligible to apply for this freelance opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Miles. The Principles Of Successful Freelancing. 1st ed., Collingwood, Vic., Sitepoint, 2008,.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economic contributions ==
India has about 15 million freelancers&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mbopartners.com/uploads/files/state-of-independence-reports/2016_MBO_Partners_State_of_Independence_Report.pdf. America's Independents: A Rising Economic Force]. MBO Partners, Inc, Herndon, Virginia, 2016,&lt;/ref&gt; and they have been significantly boosting the growth of start-ups. While fostering the start-up economy in the country, Indian freelancers are also increasingly providing expertise to top-drawer corporations as business environments and needs evolve.&lt;ref&gt;Indian Companies Say I Do To The Freelance Economy. FlexingIt, New Delhi, 2016,.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Female Indian freelance workers ==
There are numerous highly educated women armed with masters and doctorate degrees in India who cannot pursue a regular occupation due to family and social obligations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/jobs/heres-why-freelancers-are-in-great-demand/articleshow/54538358.cms|title=Here’s why freelancers are in great demand - The Economic Times|newspaper=The Economic Times|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rather than cutting short their professional careers, these women seek out freelancing options.

Despite freelancing providing a viable career option for women looking for flexibility and control the number of Indian women taking up freelancing is still small as compared to their male counterparts. In a survey conducted by Payoneer, a payments services provider based in New York in 2015, only 22 per cent of Indian freelancers are women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/tech/tech-internet-combine-to-create-unconventional-career-options/story-1kHKXGcYpUiEMgyTYT9nNO.html|title=Thanks to internet, India has most freelance professionals after US|last=|first=|date=2015-12-07|work=|newspaper=Hindustan Times|language=en|access-date=2017-01-31|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only this but the same report reveals that women are paid lesser than the men who freelance. While a male freelancer earns $19 per hour on an average, a female freelancer apparently earns $17 per hour for the same project.&lt;ref name="Scroll.in"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://scroll.in/article/720242/work-more-earn-less-four-charts-sum-up-the-economics-of-freelancing-in-india|title=Work more, earn less: four charts sum up the economics of freelancing in India|last=Jain|first=Mayank|newspaper=Scroll.in|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Companies and freelancers ==
The distinct shifts in areas like technology, culture, demographics and professional needs and goals have driven companies to reassess their human resource policies in order to accommodate the burgeoning freelance economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/jobs/heres-why-freelancers-are-in-great-demand/articleshow/54538358.cms|title=Here’s why freelancers are in great demand - The Economic Times|newspaper=The Economic Times|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; It comes as no surprise that the start-ups in India are hiring 50 per cent of the total freelancing workforce. These companies are not only hiring freelancers or independent consultants at lower management. In fact, freelance CFO’s are also getting on board in order to help streamline a company’s finances. According to industry estimates, hiring their services of an outsourced CFO can result in operational savings of 30 to 70 per cent and depending upon the nature of the job, fees charged can range from Rs 30,000 to a few lakhs per month.&lt;ref&gt;Nilika Mehrotra (2013), Disability, gender and caste intersections in Indian economy, in Sharon N.

'''Humanist Counseling in the Dutch Armed Forces''' is a task in the [[Armed forces of the Netherlands]]. [[Humanism|Humanist]] counsellors, sometimes called humanist chaplain, contribute to the (mental) well-being of military personnel, those related to them, and veterans. They do this through visible presence at the workplace, personal contact and guidance. They hold conversations, give advice and offer support. Issues concerning meaning and ethics are central to their work.&lt;ref&gt;http://humanistischverbond.nl/humanistische-geestelijke-begeleiding-defensie&lt;/ref&gt;

==Task description==

The work of humanist counsellors in the armed forces consists of:
*Presence at the workplaces, training locations and during deployments
*Individual guidance to (former) military personnel and those related to them
*Informal training for groups
*Education/training in e.g. ethics
*Philosophical/spiritual meetings
*Contribution to military ceremonies
*Identification of, and advice and counselling on issues that concern the well-being of people (humanization)
*Participation in Social Medical Teams (SMT’s), together with other aid and care workers.

Humanist counsellors are appointed as civil servants, though for carrying out their work they are viewed equivalent to the military ranks (captain, major or lieutenant colonel). They are employed in the military, not by the military, and work outside the military hierarchy. Professionally they are not accountable to the [[Ministry of Defence (Netherlands)|Ministry of Defence]] or the military authority, but to the agency that sends them, the Dutch Humanist Society (Humanistisch Verbond). This service exists primarily for the people, not for the military apparatus. Humanist counsellors thus like to call themselves (positively) critically involved. 
	
Humanist counsellors give support, but also maintain a critical distance. It means being part of the (military) unit, befriending them and gaining access to their world, while at the same time being able to pose the critical question, keeping sufficient distance to be able to see things from a different perspective, to remain the involved outsider.

Wherever the soldiers are stationed, humanist counsellors are active, working for the benefit of the mental well-being of personnel in the armed forces. Humanist counsellors are thus, also stationed outside the Netherlands, for example at [[Curaçao]], and join missions abroad as well as longer naval operations. 
 
A humanist counsellor works together with the unit they're stationed with. A counsellor goes along once in a while on patrol, helps out in the kitchen sometimes, sits with the guards at another time, or visits someone at the military field hospital. They are a member of the unit, while holding an independent position as well. They also join the deployments abroad, so they live and work in the same circumstances as the soldiers.

The humanist counseling department in the armed forces was introduced on 1 September 1964, in order to serve secular and non-religious soldiers. The department started with five counsellors. Over the years however, it has developed into one of the major counseling departments of the armed forces, with a current total of thirty eight humanist counsellors. The counsellors adopt the humanist philosophy in their work, not imposing one’s ideas onto others. In this form of counselling, the person asking for help and his own views and ways of thinking are central. But the counsellors do try to contribute to the humanization of the armed forces, by creating a more dignified, humane atmosphere.

Humanism is a life stance in which the human being is central. Humanists want to determine their life-choices themselves, assuming self-responsibility, and living autonomously, but in connection with others and the world around them.&lt;ref&gt;http://humanistischverbond.nl/humanisme&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jean Van Milders''' (13 November 1924 – 20 June 2011&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humo.be/humo-dossiers/32102/jean-van-milders-overleden. Artikel over zijn overlijden in [[Humo]]], 20 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;) was a Belgian businessman and the president of soccer team [[AA Gent]] for ten years.

==Business career==
Born in [[Geel]], Van Milders was a talented entrepreneur. He managed to develop the Brewery Van Milders situated in Geel, which he had inherited together with his brothers from his parents, to a sound company and he introduced the abbey beer Tongerlo. 1970, The brothers sold their brewery and started bottling [[Coca-Cola]]. As from 1976, they were catering Carestel-road restaurants.

Van Milders sometimes proclaimed very strange expressions about his entrepreneurial management. A good one-liner of his was: "As a child, what did we know about money? Nothing at all! And now, I've got grandchildren playing with their money on the stock markets."

==President of AA Gent==
As from July 1988 to 1998, Van Milders was he president of [[AA Gent]]. This soccer team was just degraded out of [[ Belgian First Division]] and the team had a heavy burden. Van Milders used his rich bank account to help the team financially.

In soccer, this meant a large difference at AA Gent. He transferred some well-known players to the team, making the way of playing more attractive. After a number of years, the team played European games again. In 1992, AA Gent reached the quarter finals of the [[UEFA Cup]]. This was the best European result under his guidance. In the Belgian competition, it did not work out so well the next years, but the foundations of the successes were laid. Those were achieved under his successor [[Ivan De Witte]].

Van Milders died in [[Knokke-Heist]].

'''Captain John Black''' (31 October, 1778– c. May 1802), was an English-born ship's officer who had many adventures in his short career. His best remembered adventure concerned the mutiny on {{ship||Lady Shore|1794 ship|2}} in August 1797, a ship that had been sailing with a cargo of soldiers and female [[convict]]s to Sydney, Australia. In 1798 his father, the Reverend John Black (1753–1813), a prolific writer of [[prose]] and [[poetry]], published his son's letters which gave an account of the [[mutiny]] on board the ship, when his son had been put into a small boat and left to find his way to safety with several other members of the crew. The book was dedicated as a ''“small testimony of gratitude to the Portuguese nation”'' for the ''“unequalled hospitality”'' extended to his son and his fellows in the Portuguese colonies that are now part of [[Brazil]].

John Black was also [[privateer]] (state-sanctioned pirate) for part of his naval career. He was engaged twice on privateers, once as the ship’s captain. That is, during the time of the English-Spanish war of 1795-1801, he was twice engaged on private warships authorized by the English government to attack and rob the enemy’s shipping. During both engagements he was involved in the successful capture of a Spanish vessel.

In 1798 the 19-year-old sailed into Sydney Harbour, where, after meeting the convict girl [[Mary Hyde]] (1779–1864), he made Sydney his base of operations. In between his [[whaling]] operations, voyages of exploration, and capturing Spanish vessels, he and Mary had two children. In 1802, in what became his final voyage, the then 23-year-old ship's captain sailed from Sydney to India: to [[Mumbai]] (then Bombay) and then onto [[Kolkata]] (then Calcutta) before being lost at sea as he sailed for home.

==Early life==
Captain John Black was born on 31 October 1778 in [[Great Yarmouth]], [[Norfolk]], England, the eldest son of [[Scottish people|Scottish]] parents the Reverend John Black (1753–1813) and May Logie (1747-?). His parents moved to [[Woodbridge, Suffolk]] the next year, and it is here that he spent his childhood, and where his father, who had been a deacon when he was born, was ordained a priest in 1783.

In about 1795, at the age of 17 years and looking for adventure, John Black joined the ship the ''Walpole'', an [[East Indiaman]] trader. Nothing more is known about his naval career until May 1797.

===Account of the Mutiny on the ''Lady Shore''===
On 1 May 1797, John Black wrote to his father that he was at [[Torbay]], [[Devon]], England on board ''Lady Shore''. John Black was the purser and navigating officer, and ''Lady Shore'' was bound for Sydney (then known as [[Port Jackson]]) with soldiers for the [[New South Wales Corps]]; [[Lieutenant]] [[William Minchin]] commanding officer of the detachment; a consignment of 69 female convicts; one male convict; and much needed supplies of food and farm implements for the Colony of [[New South Wales]]. Black also informed his father that the soldiers were ''“the most disagreeable, mutinous set of villains that ever entered into a ship”''. With good reason: mutinous because an attempt had already been made to seize the ship to avoid it arriving at its destination; and disagreeable villains because two of the Sergeants had already needed to be placed in irons. Many of the soldiers in the detachment being sent to New South Wales were not there from choice, and one of the attempted mutineers had stated that he had been ''“sent on board by force from a police officer”''. The detachment of troops included [[French people|French]] and [[Irish people|Irish]] prisoners of war, [[deserters]] avoiding the military discipline of a [[court-martial]], and prisoners from the Savoy Palace in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A020203b.htm William Minchin - ensign and adjutant of the New South Wales Corps]&lt;/ref&gt;

A month later on 8 June 1797, when the ''Lady Shore'' was at [[Falmouth, Cornwall]], England, she sailed out into the Atlantic Ocean in company with the West-India Fleet. 10 days later she was withdrawn from that fleet, and ''Lady Shore'' fell in with the 64-gun {{HMS|Intrepid|1770|6}} and the East-India Fleet. The threat of mutiny appeared to be in the past, and the soldiers, being very quiet in general, were allowed the possession of firearms and ammunition.

Now sailing on her own, and eight weeks after ''Lady Shore'' had sailed from Falmouth, the mutiny began. In the early morning on 1 August 1797, when ''Lady Shore'' was about four days sail from [[Rio de Janeiro]] the soldiers, and several of the sailors, mutinied. During the fray John Black fired his pistol which took one of the mutineer’s hats off, but was not able to do more damage. The mutineers quickly took over the ship killed Captain Willcocks and the Chief Mate, Lambert. All those not in the mutiny, including the soldiers' officers and some privates, were imprisoned below decks.

Two weeks later, during the late afternoon of Monday 15 August 1797, John Black and 28 others were released from their imprisonment, put in a longboat with their luggage and some provisions, and cast astern. The others, men, women and children, were: the second and third mates, the steward, the cabin boy, the commanding officer of the company of soldiers on board and his wife, five other officers, two privates, four wives, three children, one male passenger with his wife and two children, three female convicts, and the only male convict Major [[James George Semple Lisle]]. For provisions they were given ''"three small casks of water, containing about ninety gallons, four bags of bread and three pieces of salt beef”'' and managed to smuggle aboard ''“two hams, two cheeses, and a small keg containing about four gallons of rum”'', and for [[navigation]] a [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]], and a small pocket [[compass]]. The ''Lady Shore'' mutineers (soldiers and sailors) then sailed away with the ship’s surgeon, and 66 female convicts. The 29 castaways in the longboat hoisted sail and headed for [[Rio Grande, Brazil]], the nearest settlement on the Portuguese coast of South America, about 300 miles away.

Nearly exactly two days later, on 17 August 1797, after being battered by heavy seas, drenching rain, and contrary seas, they finally, with the assistance of a boat of people who had seen them from the shore, made landfall near to Rio Grande, Brazil. It was a ''“miraculous escape”'' as the locals could not believe that a boat could have survived in such weather. The castaways were hospitably received by the locals, and the Governor of Port St. Pedro promised them a passage to [[Rio de Janeiro]] by the first available ship.

After a frustrating wait of seven weeks, many false starts, and the loss of all his luggage and journals, Black decided to travel north overland to Rio de Janeiro. It was arranged for him to instead travel north overland to the Portuguese settlement on the island of St. Catharine (the island on which modern day [[Florianópolis]] is situated), and catch a ship from there. He left by horseback on 4 October 1797 with Major J.G. Semple Lisle, the male convict who had proved himself trustworthy back in Torbay when he had reported the first attempted mutiny. Also on the journey, and provided by the Portuguese, were: two servants; two Portuguese dragoons as guides, and an Indian to take care of the baggage horse. It was not an arduous journey with many stops to rest, eat and be feted by the local population along the way.

On 16 October 1797, after travelling overland by horse about {{convert|770|km|mi|abbr=on}}, Black and Major Semple caught a whaleboat to St Catharine’s, where they found part of the Portuguese Squadron of ships anchored. They were well entertained during their stay, and left the island for Rio de Janeiro three and a half weeks later on 9 November 1797 in separate ships. Semple was on the Portuguese Admiral Antonia Januario’s ship, and Black was on board a Portuguese warship commanded by the English Captain Thompson. It was to take 10 days for the ships to sail north the {{convert|1100|km|mi|abbr=on}} north to Rio de Janeiro, and they arrived on 19 November 1797.

Before travelling north to Rio de Janeiro, Black had learnt that ''Lady Shore'' had arrived in the enemy Spanish port of [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]] about {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of Rio Grande. The men had been jailed, and the female convicts placed in different homes throughout the town. He later learnt that only the pretty girls were in the homes, and the rest of the women had been imprisoned. ''Lady Shore'' was sold in Montevideo for forty thousand dollars. What happened to the seventy soldiers (the mutineers of the New South Wales Corps), or what happened to the remainder of the sixty six, not so pretty, female convicts who were not taken into homes of the amorous Spanish is not known.

As the convey of English ships in the port of Rio Janeiro would not reach England before eight months, and sick at the thought of being idle for so long a time, Black instead decided to join as navigator Captain William Wilkinson’s ship ''[[Indispensable (1791 ship)|Indispensable]]'', a ship with 14 guns and a crew of 32, that was being used as a [[privateer]], but could also be used as a whaler. Black on the ''Indispensable'' was under sail two months after arriving in Rio de Janeiro. The ''Indispensable'' sailed down the coast of South America from Rio Janeiro on 20 January 1798. Looking for adventure and riches, they were hoping to capture a Spanish ship and take it over to the [[Cape of Good Hope]].

===John Black’s later adventures===
Writing to his father from the [[Cape of Good Hope]] on 15 April 1798 John Black disclosed that he had just arrived at the Cape after captaining the 10 gun Spanish vessel the ''La Union'' from [[Málaga]] in Spain, which Captain William Wilkinson of ''Indispensable'' and his crew (including Black) had captured. The Spanish ship had been on a voyage from the [[Río de la Plata|Plata River]] ([[Buenos Aires]]) in [[Argentina]] to [[Lima]] in [[Peru]], and had been captured on 19 February 1798, one month after Black had sailed from Rio de Janeiro. He also mentions [[Cape Horn]] in his account, but does not specify when he may have been near there.

Over the next two months the cargo of the captured ''La Union'' was sold, and the ship disposed of. Among the cargo was tallow, candles, and dried beef, sought after commodities in the port. 19 year old Black invested his share of the windfall in cargo to be sold in Sydney, and wrote to his father on 7 June 1798 ''“I have laid in a considerable investment for Port Jackson”'' (Sydney)''”, which I hope to turn to good account, and I expect to sail to-morrow night.”''

It would have been easy for Captain Wilkinson of ''Indispensable'' to convince Black to invest in a trip to the port of Sydney. ''Indispensable'' had previously visited Sydney twice before: in May 1794 departing for [[Bengal]] in July 1794, and then in April 1796 when Wilkinson delivered 131 female convicts. On the second trip ''Indispensable'' had lingered in the port until 21 September 1796, giving Captain Wilkinson an insight as to the type of cargo that would raise the most money in Port Jackson.

With the strong westerlies along the southern coast of Australia it would have taken about 2 months for ''Indispensable'' to sail from the Cape of Good Hope to Sydney, and it should have arrived in early August 1798. It was a stormy passage across the Indian Ocean and then around the south of [[Tasmania|Van Diemens Land]], when the ship lost two boats and one man overboard. The same storm stove in two boats and carried away several spars. On 8 September 1798, after he had been in port long enough to assess the situation, Black wrote to his father:&lt;ref&gt;Reprinted by his father Rev. John Black in the ''St. James Chronicle'' of 31 October 1799.&lt;/ref&gt;
''"I am still amongst the living. By my last letter I informed you of having laid in an investment at the Cape for this place"'' (Sydney) ''". The market is very bad. The ''[[Barwell (1782 ship)|Barwell]]'' brought a large cargo from England, a vessel from Bengal and an American vessel with cargo of tabasco and spirits. These vessels have drained the place of all cash…Wheat, corn, beans, cabbages and fruit trees flourish, the cattle are of an uncommon size, and very fierce. An old horse, which in England would be valued at five pounds for dog's meat, sells here for 100 guineas."''

Black went on to say that he chased a flock of [[black swan]]s {{convert|15|mi|km|spell=in}} down the river, but as they were shy never got a shot at them. He mentioned that the Governor ([[John Hunter (New South Wales)|John Hunter]]) was a pleasant, sensible old man. John Black also informed his father of the doubtful monetary dealings in the Colony; and described the agricultural and natural aspects of the country. He also described the harbour as "one of the best in the known world", and that he expected in a fortnight to sail on a cruise for two months to fish (catch whales). This was the first time that Black was to go [[whaling]], the most dangerous and masculine of sea trades.&lt;ref name="distance"/&gt;

What he didn’t mention in his letter was that he had met a girl, and made her pregnant, but then it is highly possible that he didn't yet know that he was to become a father. In August 1798, when they were both 19 years old, John Black met [[Mary Hyde]], a [[convict]] girl and who the month before had arrived in Sydney on board the ''Britannia II''. Mary came under John’s "protection" and fell pregnant almost immediately.

John Black, however, wasn’t long in port. As planned, in late September 1798 his boat the ''Indispensable'' left to do some "fishing" (whaling). Governor [[John Hunter (New South Wales)|John Hunter]] wrote on 25 September 1798 that some of the whalers that were in the harbour (including the ''Britannia II'' on which Mary Hyde had arrived) had proceeding on their fishing, and the town had been freed from the nuisance of the seamen who could not resist the two temptations of spirits and women. The ship di dn’t return until 27 October 1798, and left again "immediately" on a second "fishing" trip, not returning again until 29 December 1798. ''Indispensable'' returned from this second trip with 54 tons of sperm whale oil from whaling within a range of {{convert|125|mi|km}} above and below Sydney, and within {{convert|90|mi|km}} of the coast. ''Indispensable'' then needed a refit, and John Black needed to stay in port for a considerable time.

In March 1799 Governor Hunter granted a lease of land to ''“Mr. John Black, late purser of the ''Lady Shore'' transport”''. This allotment is shown on surveyor [[James Meehan]]’s map of Sydney on the eastern side of George Street, between Hunter Street and Martin Place, where De Mestre Place is today. This land was later held in trust by for John Black’s two children, and became the land on which Black’s son-in-law [[Prosper de Mestre]] resided and ran his business from.

From then on, while John Black sailed in and out of Sydney, Mary Hyde resided on this allotment backing onto the [[Tank Stream]]. Black's family was fending for itself whilst John was often away for months at a time, or even longer, either whaling or otherwise working his trade as a ship's officer.

On 31 May 1799 John Henry Black, son of John Black and Mary Hyde, was born at home. Fortunately John was home at the time to see his new-born son. But three days later he sailed again.

It was reported that ''Indispensable'' sailed for "fishing" about 3 June 1799. [[David Collins (governor)|David Collins]] wrote ''“About this time the ''Indispensable'' sailed on her fishing voyage. This ship had been careened and completely repaired in the Cove.”'' There is no record of her return to port, but it had to have been before the baptism of Black's son on 2 September 1799. It was not long after that Black again left his family and sailed back to Cape Town from Sydney in what was then regarded as the shortest passage (time-wise). It was a long tedious voyage up the east coast of Australia, above New Guinea, and through the islands of Indonesia using the more favourable winds of the south-east monsoon (as compared to the adverse strong westerlies along the southern coast of Australia) before [[sailing|sailing upwind or beating]] across the Indian Ocean down to Cape Town.&lt;ref name="distance"/&gt;

After arriving in Cape Town some months later, John Black became engaged in adventure that continued to keep him away from his family. The Englishman was engaged for the first time as a Captain on the [[privateer]] ''Chance'' owned by [[Michael Hogan (shipowner)|Michael Hogan]]. As Spain was then at war with England Black was engaged to sail from Cape Town seeking Spanish ships. His mission was successful as on 8 July 1800 a Spanish Brig of 70 tons arrived in Cape Town carrying prize colours.

After taking his share of the spoils from the sale of the Spanish brig and its cargo, Black took command of the brig ''[[Norfolk (1797 brig)|Harbinger]]'' also owned by Michael Hogan. Carrying a cargo of 2,800 gallons of spirits and 3,000 gallons of wine, in November 1800 Black began to sail back to Sydney, and his family.

As an aside, in 1800 it was recorded that ''‘’Mary Hide''(sic) ''and her son were off the’’'' (government) ''‘’stores’’''. This was because Mary ''"living on the lease of Mr. Black; and owing 7 sheep, 4 pigs and 3 goats’’'' had been able to meet a level of self-sufficiency, something the government greatly encouraged in an effort to cut costs.

Heading east across the Indian Ocean for Sydney, with instructions to take the short cut through the newly discovered [[Bass Strait]] (which separated Australia from [[Van Diemens Land|Tasmania]]), he followed in the wake of the brig {{HMS|Lady Nelson|1798|6}}, the first ship to sail eastward through the new-found Bass Strait. ''Harbinger'' embarked on an investigation of the strait tracking around [[Cape Otway]], Cape Danger and Cape Patten down to the northern part of King Island, and around [[Wilsons Promontory]]. Black had sheltered near two small islands which he named the [[New Year Island (Tasmania)|New Year Isles]], and then sailed on and named the larger island [[King Island (Tasmania)|King Island]] after [[Philip Gidley King|Governor Philip Gidley King]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/travel/travel-factsheet/king-island--culture-and-history-20081121-6dsf.html Guide to King Island]&lt;/ref&gt; He also named the Harbinger Rocks,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kingisland.org.au/Default.asp?ID=2 King Island]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Hogan Group]] of islands. A chart drawn later by Governor King shows John Black's course through Bass Strait. Governor King's report on the voyage reads: ''"A small [[brig]] from the Cape of Good Hope, commanded by Mr. Black (a person of good abilities as a surveyor and navigator) passed thro and keeping more to the Southward made Cape Albany Otway and standing to the southward made an island lying in the centre of the west entrance of the strait which he named King Island and afterwards passed thro the centre of the strait unadvisable to attempt from the east only from the west."'' A copy of Black's writing on the passage through Bass Strait in ''Harbinger'' was sent to England with Governor King's letter.

Black arrived back in Sydney on 11 January 1801 after having been away for 14 months, at which time his partner Mary Hyde promptly became pregnant with their second child. This was the beginning of his longest time in port and with his family, and lasted nearly 12 months.

Black discharged his cargo of rum and wines in Sydney into the warehouse that the businessman [[Simeon Lord]] had built specifically for this purpose. (Coincidentally Simeon Lord was later to be the step-father to Black’s children.) In selling his cargo Black had entered Sydney’s liquor trade, and established a shop on his leased land. It was reported "[[Simeon Lord]] sells rum at 32/- a gallon, Capt. Cox ditto, Black his gin at 10 gns”''(guineas) ''“a case, etc. these are Governor King’s regulations for the benefit of the Colony while American ships who would be glad to sell their liquor at 5/-, 6/- or 7/- per G.”''(gallon) ''“are turned away! Why!"

Black also negotiated with Governor King to sell ''Harbinger'' to the Governor on behalf of its owner. On 1 May 1801 the Governor wrote to the Duke of Portland, stressing the old age of vessels used by the Government and the need for replacements. ''“The Master of the brig Harbinger, recently arrived from the Cape, has offered her for sale. As a vessel is needed to go between Norfolk Island to carry supplies and bring salt port from thence, I directed a survey to be taken of that vessel, also an inventory of her masts, rigging and furniture. The sum demanded by the owner was 1500 pounds and the offer I made him was 700 pounds, though much less than her real value.”'' Because of money shortage in Sydney, there was no other bidder for ''Harbinger'', so Black was compelled to accept the Governor's 700 pounds.

The documents relating to ''Harbinger''{{'}}s sale were signed by John Black in June 1801 where he described himself as a resident of Sydney, and receipted by him on 3 August 1801.

On 7 September 1801 Governor [[Philip Gidley King]] granted Mary Hyde an Absolute Pardon 18 months before her sentence would have expired. From the wording of the pardon, it would appear that John Black used his credit with the Governor King to obtain this Absolute Pardon for his partner.

John Black's and Mary Hyde's second child, [[Mary Ann Black]], was born on 1 October 1801.&lt;ref&gt;It has been suggested that John and Mary might have married about this time, but no record of this marriage has been found; she is shown as Mary Hide(sic) on the 1811 muster, and she married as Mary Hyde in 1814.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was on 1 January 1802 that 23-year-old John Black next left Sydney. His partner Mary Hyde was left at home as the sole parent of two children under the age of three, and one only 3 months old. John Black was employed as Captain of the Campbells &amp; Co. [[brig]] ''[[Fly (brig)|Fly]]'' sailing for [[Mumbai]] (then Bombay) and then [[Kolkata]] (then Calcutta) to pick up goods from India for the Sydney warehouses of [[Robert Campbell (Australian merchant &amp; politician)|Robert Campbell]]. Black managed to make the voyage up the east coast of Australia, above New Guinea, through the islands of Indonesia, and across to Mumbai and then Kolkata&lt;ref name="distance"/&gt; in very good time. In April 1802 the ''Fly'' departed Kolkata for the return voyage to Sydney. ''Fly'' left the [[Maritime pilot|pilot]] on 14 May 1802 to continue sailing south across the Indian Ocean, along the bottom of Australia, through the Bass Strait above Tasmania, and then up the east coast to Sydney,&lt;ref name="distance"&gt;''The Tyranny of Distance'', Geoffrey Blainey, 1966, Sun Books Pty Ltd&lt;/ref&gt; or so was the plan. However, sometime after 14 May 1802 the ship was lost at sea with all hands, if not on its passage across the Indian Ocean then somewhere in the stormy and ice-berg strewn ocean below southern Australia.

News did not reach Sydney until nearly 12 months later that Black's ship was missing. News of the probable loss of ''Fly'' was reported by Captain Allan M'Askell of ''Castle of Good Hope'' when it arrived in Sydney in February 1803 to find that ''Fly'' had never arrived. The Ship News in the ''Sydney Gazette &amp; New South Wales Advertiser'' of 5 March 1803 reported the loss ''"we have been informed of the more than probable loss of the Fly, a vessel of about 100 tons burthen, laden with piece and other valuable goods, also bound for this place"'' (Sydney)''", and belonging to the House of Campbells, at Calcutta" (Kolkata) ". She left Calcutta in the month of April last"'' (1802) ''", and has not since been heard of; was commanded by Mr. John Black, a young man much esteemed here by all who knew him."''&lt;ref&gt;

Black's death was not publicly confirmed until April 1804 when the Ship News in the ''Sydney Gazette &amp; New South Wales Advertiser'' of 15 April 1804 reported: ''“The brig ''Fly'', Captain Black, that sailed from Calcutta for this colony in April 1802 has never been heard of.”''&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3439">In the [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]], the '''Ladenschlussgesetz''' or "Shop Closing Law" (abbreviated: '''LadSchlG''') is the federal law regulating at which times retail stores were forced to be closed to the public. The ''Ladenschlussgesetz'' in its current form was first enacted on 28 November 1956 following pressure from Germany's trade unions; in its last revision (of 2 June 2003), points of sale ''(Verkaufsstellen)'' must be closed at any of the following times:

# On Sundays and public [[holiday]]s;
# On working days (Monday through Saturday) before 06:00 and after 20:00;
# On December 24 before 06:00 and after 14:00 if that date falls on a working day

The law provides differing regulations for pharmacies, petrol stations, shops at train stations and airports, etc. 

On 30 June 2006, as part of the ''Föderalismusreform'' ("Federalism Reform"), the regulatory responsibility for this area was devolved to the [[States of Germany|German states]].  The net effect, although the Federal law technically remains in force, the states are free to determine the opening hours of retail stores in their areas. Meanwhile, all states - with the exception of the more conservative Bavaria - made use of that option.

==German states with varying shop opening hours==
The states have each adopted individual regulations concerning opening hours on Sundays and public holidays.  Some continue to observe the existing Federal rules, while others have liberalized them somewhat, although the general Federal ban concerning opening on Sundays and holidays remains in effect, owing to a provision in the German constitution recognizing Sunday as a day of rest and a corresponding decision of the Federal Constitutional Court ''([[Bundesverfassungsgericht]])'' on 9 June 2004.

'''Lamar Hunt''' (August 2, 1932 – December 13, 2006) was an American businessman notable for his promotion of [[American football]], [[soccer]], [[basketball]], [[tennis]] and [[ice hockey]] in the United States and for his efforts in conjunction with his brothers, [[William Herbert Hunt]] and [[Nelson Bunker Hunt]], to corner the silver market in the late 1970s and early 1980s. 

He was the principal founder of the [[American Football League]] (AFL) and [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS), as well as MLS's predecessor, the [[North American Soccer League (1968–84)|North American Soccer League]] (NASL), and co-founder of [[World Championship Tennis]]. He was also the founder and owner of the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL), the [[Kansas City Wizards]] of MLS, and at the time of his death owned two other MLS teams, [[Columbus Crew]] and [[FC Dallas]].  In [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], Hunt also helped establish the [[Worlds of Fun]] and [[Oceans of Fun]] theme parks.

The oldest ongoing national soccer tournament in the United States, the [[Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup|U.S. Open Cup]] (founded 1914), now bears his name in honor of his pioneering role in that sport stateside. He was inducted into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 1972; into the [[National Soccer Hall of Fame]] in 1982; and into the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]] in 1993. The National Soccer Hall of Fame bestowed upon Hunt their Medal of Honor in 1999, an award given to only three recipients in history thus far. He was married for 42 years to his second wife Norma, and had four children, Sharron, [[Lamar Hunt Jr.|Lamar Jr.]], Daniel, and [[Clark Hunt]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
Hunt was born in [[El Dorado, Arkansas]], the son of oil [[tycoon]] [[H. L. Hunt]] and younger brother of tycoons [[Nelson Bunker Hunt]] and William Herbert Hunt. Lamar was raised in [[Dallas, Texas]]. He attended [[Culver Military Academy]] and graduated from [[The Hill School]] in [[Pennsylvania]] in 1951 and [[Southern Methodist University]] in Dallas in 1956, with a B.S. degree in [[geology]]. Hunt was a [[college football]] player who rode the bench but was still an avid sports enthusiast during his time in college and throughout his entire childhood. While attending SMU in 1952, Hunt joined the [[Kappa Sigma]] fraternity. In 1972, he was selected as Kappa Sigma's Man of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Kappa Sigma Mourns Loss of Brother Lamar Hunt, Sports Industry Legend|journal=The Caduceus of Kappa Sigma|date=November 2006|issue=Winter 2006–2007|page=22|url=http://www.kappasigma.org/pdf/Caduceus_Winter_2006-2007.pdf|accessdate=2013-06-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007033103/http://www.kappasigma.org/pdf/Caduceus_Winter_2006-2007.pdf|archivedate=2008-10-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Founding of the American Football League===
On the strength of his great inherited oil wealth, Hunt applied for a [[National Football League]] expansion franchise but was turned down. In 1959, professional football was a distant second to [[Major League Baseball]] in popularity, and the thinking among NFL executives was that the league must be careful not to "oversaturate" the market by expanding too quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|publisher=Dallas Morning News
|title=Hunt remembered for energy, integrity
|accessdate=2006-12-14
|first=Brad|last= Townsend}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hunt also attempted to purchase the NFL's [[Chicago Cardinals]] franchise in 1959 with the intent to move them to Dallas, but was again turned down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John A. |last=Drobnicki|title=Hunt, Lamar|work=The Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives| volume= VIII: 2006–2008|publisher=Scribner's|year= 2010|page= 228}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, Hunt approached several other businessmen who had also unsuccessfully sought NFL franchises, including fellow [[Texas|Texan]] and oil man [[Bud Adams|K. S. "Bud" Adams]] of [[Houston]], about forming a new football league, and the [[American Football League]] was established in August 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Drobnicki, pp. 228-229&lt;/ref&gt;  The group of the eight founders of the AFL teams was referred to as the "Foolish Club."  Hunt's goal was to bring professional football to Texas and to acquire an NFL team for the Hunt family. Hunt became owner of the [[Dallas Texans (AFL)|Dallas Texans]] and hired future hall-of-famer [[Hank Stram]] as the team's first head coach.

===Ownership and NFL merger===
{{Peacock|date=January 2009}}
As a response to the newly formed league and the presence of an AFL franchise in Dallas, the NFL quickly placed a new franchise of their own in Dallas, the Dallas Cowboys. As a result, the Dallas Texans, despite being one of the more successful AFL teams in the league's early days, failed to draw fans in large numbers, as the Texans had to compete with the [[Dallas Cowboys]] for fans. In one popular, though probably apocryphal, story, a reporter informed Hunt's father that the Texans had lost $1 million in their first season. In response, H.L. Hunt supposedly said, "At that rate, he can only last another 100 years." Lamar himself later said that the numbers mentioned in the story were "overly flattering." In 1963 Hunt began to consider moving the team. [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] became one of the contending cities for the franchise. In order to convince Hunt to move the team to Kansas City, mayor [[H. Roe Bartle]] promised Hunt home attendance of 25,000 people per game.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Hunt finally agreed to move the team to Kansas City, and in 1963 the Dallas Texans became the [[Kansas City Chiefs]].

In the Chiefs' first two seasons attendance did not match the levels Mayor Bartle had promised, but in 1966 average home attendance at Chiefs games increased and reached 37,000. By 1969 Chiefs' average home attendance had reached 51,000. In 1966 the Chiefs won their first AFL Championship (after having previously won it as the Dallas Texans) and reached the first ever [[Super Bowl I|Super Bowl]], which the Chiefs lost to the [[Green Bay Packers]]. The Chiefs remained successful through the 1960s, and in 1970 the Chiefs won the AFL Championship and [[Super Bowl IV]] (the last Super Bowl played when the AFL was a separate league prior to it being absorbed into the NFL as the [[American Football Conference]]) over the heavily favored [[Minnesota Vikings]].

Hunt insisted that he be listed in the team media guide as the ''founder'' of the Chiefs rather than the ''owner''. He publicly listed his telephone number in the phone book until his death.&lt;ref&gt;Drobnicki, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coinage of the term "Super Bowl"===

In 1966, the NFL and AFL agreed to merge, with a championship game between the two leagues to be played after that season. In a July 25, 1966, letter to NFL commissioner [[Pete Rozelle]], Hunt wrote, "I have kiddingly called it the 'Super Bowl,' which obviously can be improved upon." Hunt would later say the name was likely in his head because his children had been playing with a [[Super Ball]] toy. Although the leagues' owners decided on the name "AFL-NFL Championship Game", the media immediately picked up on Hunt's "Super Bowl" name, which would become official beginning with the [[Super Bowl III|third annual game]], which was won by the AFL's [[New York Jets]] over the NFL's [[Baltimore Colts]].&lt;ref&gt;MacCambridge, Michael. ''America's Game''. New York: Random House, 2004, p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The NASL: ownership and battles with the NFL===
In 1967 Hunt helped promote professional soccer in the United States. Hunt's interest in soccer began in 1962 when he accompanied his future wife, Norma, to a [[Shamrock Rovers]] game in [[Dublin]], Ireland.&lt;ref name="go"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=394199&amp;root=us&amp;cc=5739 |title=Hunt a quiet pioneer of U.S. soccer – ESPN FC|publisher=soccernet.espn.go.com|accessdate=2014-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, he viewed the [[FIFA World Cup]] in England, and then attended nine of the next 11 World Cup tournaments.

In 1967, Hunt founded the [[Dallas Tornado]] as members of the [[United Soccer Association]]. In 1968 the league merged with the [[National Professional Soccer League (1967)|National Professional Soccer League]] to form the [[North American Soccer League (1968–84)|North American Soccer League]]. Hunt was an active advocate for the sport and the league and the [[Dallas Tornado]] won the NASL championship in 1971 and were runners-up 1973.

The NFL owners were not happy with Hunt's ownership in and promotion of pro soccer.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}  The NFL attempted to force legal requirements that would disallow team ownership in more than one sport for owners of NFL franchises. This strategy backfired on the NFL, and the NASL won an anti-trust case against the NFL. A primary benefactor of this outcome was Lamar Hunt.&lt;ref name='dellapa_soccernet'&gt;{{cite news

|accessdate=2006-12-14
|first=Frank|last= Dell'apa
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, after 15 seasons and losses in the millions, Hunt and his Dallas Tornado partner Bill McNutt decided to merge their team with the [[Tampa Bay Rowdies (1975–93)|Tampa Bay Rowdies]] franchise, while retaining a minority stake in the Florida club. Two years later, along with Rowdies principal [[George W. Strawbridge, Jr.|George Strawbrige]], they sold the Rowdies to local investors. The move effectively ended Hunt's ties to the NASL a year before the league itself finally collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=MacCambridge | first=Michael | date=2012 | title=Lamar Hunt: A Life in Sports | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9jI5GTaAjZMC&amp;dq=rowdies+tornado+merge&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|location= | publisher=[[Andrews McMeel Publishing]] | page=262 | isbn=9781449423391 | accessdate=2014-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1346&amp;dat=19830914&amp;id=YqpNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=o_sDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6683,4875862 | title=Rowdies sold to Bay area investors | first=Randy | last=Miranda | date=September 14, 1983 | work=[[The Ledger]] | location=[[Lakeland, Florida]] | via=Google News Archive Search | publisher=news.google.com | accessdate=2014-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Major League Soccer===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Major League Soccer]] --&gt;
Hunt returned to soccer as one of the original founding investors of Major League Soccer, which debuted in 1996. He originally owned two teams: the [[Columbus Crew SC|Columbus Crew]] and the Kansas City Wizards (now [[Sporting Kansas City]]). In 1999, Hunt financed the construction of the venue now known as [[Mapfre Stadium]], the second, and first since 1913, of several large [[soccer-specific stadium]]s in the USA. In 2003, Hunt purchased a third team, the Dallas Burn (now [[FC Dallas]]), after announcing that he would partially finance the construction of their own [[Toyota Stadium (Texas)|soccer-specific stadium]]. On 31 August 2006, Hunt sold the Wizards to a six-man ownership group led by [[Cerner Corporation]] co-founders Neal Patterson and Cliff Illig.

===Other sports===

====Basketball====
Hunt was one of the founding investors of the [[Chicago Bulls]] of the [[National Basketball Association]]. He remained a minority owner until his death.

====Tennis====
In 1968, Hunt co-founded the [[World Championship Tennis]] circuit, which gave birth to the Open Era of tennis. He was inducted into the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]] in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hunt to Enter Another Hall|url=http://www.itftennis.com/procircuit/tournaments/men's-tournament/info.aspx?tournamentid=1010002317|accessdate=2012-09-20|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 10, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hockey====
Hunt and [[John H. McConnell]] formed Columbus Hockey Limited, L.L.C. (CHL) in an effort to obtain a [[National Hockey League]] franchise for [[Columbus, Ohio]]. Following disagreements over the financing for an arena, McConnell accepted an offer to lease a new arena from Nationwide Insurance Enterprise. McConnell froze out CHL and Hunt and was awarded the NHL [[Columbus Blue Jackets]] franchise. See ''McConnell v. Hunt Sports Enterprises'', 132 Ohio App.3d 657, 725 N.E.2d 1193 (1999), a lawsuit that Lamar Hunt lost and thus granted McConnel sole ownership of the [[Columbus Blue Jackets]].

==Business ventures outside sports==

===Amusement parks and caves===
Hunt was the founder of two theme parks in Kansas City: [[Worlds of Fun]] and [[Oceans of Fun]], which opened in 1973 and 1982 respectively. The two parks were an outgrowth and adjoined a vast industrial park he developed in the bluffs above the [[Missouri River]] in [[Clay County, Missouri]].

Immediately south of the Hunt-founded parks is the Hunt-developed [[SubTropolis]], a 55,000,000 square foot (5,060,000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), {{convert|1100|acre|km2|sing=on}} manmade [[limestone]] cave which is claimed to be the ''World's Largest Underground Business Complex (TM).''  Hunt's extensive business dealings in Clay County were to contribute to the Chiefs having their [[NFL Training Camp]] at [[William Jewell College]] in [[Liberty, Missouri]] until 1991.

===Silver speculation===
During the 1970s and early 1980s, Hunt and his brothers [[Nelson Bunker Hunt]] and [[William Herbert Hunt]] attempted to corner the silver market. They began buying silver in the early 1970s. By the end of 1979 their ownership of one-third of the silver market{{which?|reason=United States or world?|date=November 2018}} caused the price to rise from $11 an ounce in September 1979 to $50 an ounce in January 1980. In the last nine months of 1979, the brothers profited by an estimated $2 billion to $4 billion. However, on March 27, 1980, subsequently referred to within the precious-metals industry as [[Silver Thursday]], the price collapsed. In September 1988, the Hunt brothers filed for bankruptcy under United States Bankruptcy Code Chapter 11.

==Personal life==
Lamar Hunt had two brothers, Nelson Bunker and William Herbert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nelson Bunker Hunt|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Bunker_Hunt}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was married twice. His first marriage to Rosemary Carr, ended in a divorce. He had two children from his first marriage. He remarried later to Norma Lynn Knobel, who he was married to until his death.

==Death and succession==
Lamar Hunt died December 13, 2006, at Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas of complications related to [[prostate cancer]]. Upon his death, Cowboys owner [[Jerry Jones]] called Hunt "a founder of the NFL as we know it today," adding "He's been an inspiration for me."&lt;ref name="wfaa_simnacher"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.wfaa.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/localnews/stories/121406dnmethuntobit.90f04cf.html | date=2006-12-13 | accessdate=2006-12-14 | first1=Joe|last1= Simnacher |first2=Brad |last2= Townsend | title=Sports innovator Lamar Hunt dies | publisher=WFAA |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061229024845/http://www.wfaa.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/localnews/stories/121406dnmethuntobit.90f04cf.html |archivedate = 2006-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Said [[Dan Rooney]], chairman of the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]: "Lamar Hunt was one of the most influential owners in professional football over the past 40-plus years, He was instrumental in the formation of the American Football League and in the AFL-NFL merger, which helped the [[National Football League]] grow into America's passion." The Mayor of [[Kansas City, Missouri]], [[Kay Waldo Barnes]], requested that all city flags fly at half-staff the following Thursday and Friday after Hunt's death.

Upon Hunt's death, his son [[Clark Hunt|Clark]] was named chairman of the Kansas City Chiefs and FC Dallas, having been elected by Hunt's other children, Lamar Hunt Jr., Sharron Munson, and Daniel Hunt. Though Hunt's wife and children share legal ownership of the Chiefs, Clark represents the team at all league owner meetings and handles the day-to-day responsibilities of the team.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

'''Lillian Stokes Bostwick Phipps''' (July 9, 1906 &amp;ndash; November 27, 1987) was an [[United States|American]] [[socialite]] and owner of [[Thoroughbred]] [[steeplechase (horse racing)|steeplechase]] [[horse racing|racehorses]].

==Early life==
Lillian Stokes Bostwick was born in [[New York City]], the daughter of Mary Stokes and [[Albert Carlton Bostwick]] (1876-1911), her wealthy grandfather, [[Jabez A. Bostwick]] (1830–1892), was one of [[John D. Rockefeller|John D. Rockefeller's]] founding partners in the [[Standard Oil|Standard Oil Company]].

Lillian Bostwick was raised in a [[Fifth Avenue (Manhattan)|Fifth Avenue]] mansion in [[New York City]] and as a young woman was listed in the 1930 New York [[Social Register|Social Blue Book]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bklyn-genealogy-info.com/Directory/Blue/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; Her father was a horseman and [[polo]] player whose influence on her and brothers [[George Herbert Bostwick]], [[Dunbar Bostwick|Dunbar]] and [[Albert C. Bostwick, Jr.|Albert Jr.]] led to them becoming involved with the sport of [[horse racing]]. In 1942, her only sister, [[Dorothy Stokes Bostwick|Dorothy]] (1899-2001), became the first American woman to hold a [[helicopter]] pilot's license.

==Career==
In the 1930s, Lillian Bostwick and brothers Pete and Dunbar built and operated Bostwick Field in [[Old Westbury, New York]] where they hosted international polo matches.

While her husband successfully invested in Thoroughbred horses for [[flat racing]], Lillian Bostwick Phipps purchased and raced a number of [[Steeplechase (horse racing)|steeplechase]] racers. She owned  [[Neji (horse)|Neji]] and [[Oedipus (horse)|Oedipus]], two very prominent horses that were voted [[Eclipse Award for Outstanding Steeplechase horse|American Steepchase Champion]]s five times in all, and who were both inducted into the [[National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame|U.S. Racing Hall of Fame]]. Mrs. Phipps won the [[American Grand National]] eight times with Oedipus (1951), Neji (1955, 1957, 1958), Mako (1965), Top Bid (1973), Straight and True (1976), and Le Ronceray (1987).

* [[Ogden Mills Phipps]] (1940-2016)
* [[Cynthia Phipps]] (1945-2007), who died as a result of injuries sustained in a fire in her Manhattan apartment.

Phipps and her husband maintained residences in New York City, Saratoga Springs, Florida and at [[Summerville, South Carolina]] where she died in 1987. Lillian was buried in the [[Bostwick Mausoleum]], in [[Woodlawn Cemetery, Bronx|Woodlawn Cemetery]], [[Bronx, New York]].

The '''London Metal Exchange''' ('''LME''') is the futures exchange with the world's largest market in options and  [[futures contract]]s on [[base metal|base]] and other [[metal]]s. As the LME offers contracts with daily expiry dates of up to three months from trade date, weekly contracts to six months, and monthly contracts up to 123 months,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Futures Contract Specifications |url=https://www.lme.com/en-gb/metals/non-ferrous/aluminium/contract-specifications/futures/ |publisher = London Metal Exchange |accessdate=7 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; it also allows for cash trading. It offers [[Hedge (finance)|hedging]], worldwide reference pricing, and the option of physical delivery to settle contracts. Since 2012 it has been owned by [[Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing]], after LME's shareholders voted in July 2012 to approve the sale of the exchange for a price of £1.4 billion.

==History==
The London Metal Market and Exchange Company was founded in 1877, but the market traces its origins back to 1571 and the opening of the [[Royal Exchange, London]]. Before the exchange was created, business was conducted by traders in London [[coffee house]]s using a makeshift ring drawn in chalk on the floor.&lt;ref name=Today&gt;BBC Radio 4 ''[[Today (BBC Radio 4)|Today]]'', broadcast 25 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

At first only [[copper]] was traded. [[Lead]] and [[zinc]] were soon added but only gained official trading status in 1920. The exchange was closed during [[World War II]] and did not re-open until 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Richard|last=Northedge|title=130 years of the LME|year=2007|publisher=Newsdesk Communications|url=http://www.henrybath.com/assets/_files/documents/apr_11/HENRYBATH__1303997757_LME_130_Supplement.pdf|work=LME 130th Anniversary Supplement|accessdate=31 October 2014|format=PDF|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031150533/http://www.henrybath.com/assets/_files/documents/apr_11/HENRYBATH__1303997757_LME_130_Supplement.pdf|archive-date=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The range of metals traded was extended to include [[aluminium]] (1978), [[nickel]] (1979), [[tin]] (1989), aluminium alloy (1992), [[steel]] (2008), and minor metals [[cobalt]] and [[molybdenum]] (2010). The exchange ceased trading [[plastics]] in 2011.  The total value of the trade is around $US 11.6 trillion annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=LME achieves another year of record volume |url=http://lme.com/6935.asp |date=5 January 2009 |publisher=London Metal Exchange |accessdate=29 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401031016/http://www.lme.com/6935.asp |archivedate=1 April 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many deals are made for commodities to be delivered in three months' time. The custom stems from the time that copper cargoes originally took in 1877 on their voyage from the ports of [[Chile]].&lt;ref name=Today/&gt;

The LME was owned by its members until 2012, when it was sold to Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing for £1.4 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first=Henry |last=Sanderson |title=London Metal Exchange debates its future |url=https://www.ft.com/video/157a944e-caaf-3f3d-90a8-e7487d1a8e7f |publisher=Financial Times|  | date=24 March 2017 |accessdate=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commodities traded==
The LME offers futures and options contracts for aluminium, aluminium alloy, NASAAC (North American Special Aluminium Alloy), cobalt, copper, lead, molybdenum, nickel, steel billet, steel rebar, steel scrap, tin and zinc.

==Facilities==
[[File:LME Entrance.jpg|thumb|Main entrance to the former premises of the LME, at 56 [[Leadenhall Street]] in the [[City of London]]]]
To trade contracts in copper, tin, or any other metal listed on the LME, one has to trade through an LME member. Purchasers of contracts, which are then left to reach maturity, will receive a warrant for a specific LME approved warehouse to take delivery of the metal if required.

The LME issues, each day, detailed figures on how many tonnes of each metal is in its warehouses, which helps producers and consumers make correct business decisions.

==Ring trading==
Trading Times: 11:40 — 17:00, London Time

[[Open-outcry]] is the oldest way of trading on the exchange, though nowadays the majority of trades are placed electronically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=LME Select |url=https://www.lme.com/trading/venues-and-systems/systems/lmeselect/ |publisher = London Metal Exchange |accessdate=7 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is central to the process of [[price discovery]], the way LME official prices are established.  Prices are derived from the most liquid periods of trading; the short open-outcry ring trading sessions, and are most representative of industry [[supply and demand]].  The official settlement price, on which contracts are settled, is determined by the last offer price before the bell is sounded to mark the end of the official ring.

There is constant inter-office trading. A relatively small yet important portion of trading is still done by open-outcry in the Ring. There are a morning and an afternoon trade, where each of the nine metal contracts are traded in two blocks with a five-minute session for each contract (the sessions last from 11.40 until 13.10 and from 14.55 until 16.15, each session includes a 10-minute break). The second trading block in the morning is key to setting the Daily Official Exchange rates. After the official trades of sessions one and two, there are 85 and 45 minutes of "kerb" trading respectively. Trades are in futures, options and TAPOs (traded average-price options, a form of [[Asian options]]).

Whilst the price discovery mechanism used by the exchange is post-trade transparent it is not pre-trade transparent. Pre-trade transparency is required for many securities under the Market in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFiD) to achieve fair markets by reducing such illegal abuse as market manipulation.

The LME is the last exchange in Europe where open-outcry trading takes place.&lt;ref name=Today/&gt;

Ring Dealing Members are entitled to trade in the Ring during the ring-trading sessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Category 1 – Ring Dealing |url=http://lme.com/membership_ringdealing.asp |publisher=London Metal Exchange |accessdate=29 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322061843/http://www.lme.com/membership_ringdealing.asp |archivedate=22 March 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They may also operate a 24-hour market by trading inter-office. All Ring Dealing Members, as members of the LME Clear, are authorised under the [[Financial Services and Markets Act 2000]], and are regulated by the [[Financial Conduct Authority]]. 

Ring Dealing Members are [[Clearing (finance)|Clearing]] Members, who hold the exclusive right to trade in the ring;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ring Dealing Members |url=https://www.lme.com/trading/membership/category-1-ring-dealing/ |publisher = London Metal Exchange |accessdate=7 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the 9 companies that have exclusive rights to trade in the Ring, around 100 companies are involved in the LME in total.

==Precious metals==
Contrary to popular belief, the precious metals, [[gold]] and [[silver]], are not traded on the London Metal Exchange, but on the [[over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]] market usually referred to as the [[London bullion market|London Bullion Market]], by the members of the [[London Bullion Market Association]]. [[Platinum]] and [[palladium]] are traded on the [[London Platinum and Palladium Market]]. Both members of the LBMA and LPPM trade the precious metals spot market on [[Electronic Broking Services|EBS]] (Electronic Broking Systems)—acquired by [[ICAP (company)|ICAP]] in June 2006. Many companies involved in minor metals are members of the [[Minor Metal Trade Association]].

The LME used,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lme.com/~/media/Files/Notices/2014/2014_09/14%20269%20A261%20Precious%20Metals%20Price%20Data%20and%20Matching%20and%20Clearing%20Services.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; however, to provide trade matching and clearing services to the London bullion market and distributes gold, silver, and gold IRS ([[interest rate swap]]s) forward rates on behalf of the LBMA.

==Electronic trading==
The LME launched an electronic platform called LME Select launched in February 2001.[5] This was developed by a [[Sweden|Swedish]] software house called [http://www.cinnober.com Cinnober]. The platform is a FIX-based trading platform, and now handles a majority of the total LME business.

==Delivery points==
As a market of “last resort”, industry can use the LME’s delivery option to sell excess stock in times of oversupply and as a source of material in times of extreme shortage.  In reality, physical delivery occurs in a very small percentage of cases on the LME as most organizations use the LME for hedging purposes. The small percentage which does result in delivery, however, plays a vital role in creating price convergence.

==Warehouses==
To support this mechanism, the LME approves and licenses a network of warehouses and storage facilities around the world. Controversy arose in 2013 because the LME took action to limit the use of its warehouses for the hoarding of aluminium. In March 2014, England's [[High Court]] found for [[Rusal]], the Russian aluminium company, striking down these rules.

In [[economics]], a '''margin''' is a set of [[Constraint (mathematics)|constraint]]s conceptualised as a ''border''.&lt;ref name="wicksteed"&gt;[[Philip Wicksteed|Wicksteed, Philip Henry]]; ''The Common Sense of Political Economy'' (1910),] Bk I Ch 2 and elsewhere.&lt;/ref&gt;  A ''marginal change'' is the change associated with a relaxation or tightening of constraints — either change ''of'' the constraints, or a change ''in response to'' this change of the constraints.&lt;ref name="wicksteed" /&gt;

==Early life==
Minos Kyriakou is the son of Xenophon Kyriacou and Athina Revidies.&lt;ref name="Publications2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Europa Publications|title=The International Who's Who 2004|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sR4Ch1dMe8IC&amp;pg=PA942|accessdate=3 July 2017|year=2003|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-1-85743-217-6|page=942}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated in France, Switzerland and at [[Columbia University]] in the US, from where he has a bachelor's degree.&lt;ref name="Publications2003"/&gt;

==Career==
Kyriakou was the founder and owner of [[ANT1 Group]], a media company which owns most notably [[ANT1]], one of the oldest and one of the first private television channels in Greece.

He also owned the Greek [[sports club|multi-sports club]] [[Panellinios GS]], and the [[Greek Basket League]] club [[Panellinios BC|Panellinios]].&lt;ref name="zoominfo.com"/&gt;

Kyriakou's links to the sporting world saw him later become president of the Greek Olympic Committee after Athens hosted the Olympic Games of 2004. He continued as president before stepping down in 2009. &lt;ref&gt;https://hellenicnews.com/greek-owner-minos-kyriakou-dies-aged-75/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems with the law==
Kyriakou owned four acres of land in [[Athens]] that are in violation of Areos Park, as some of the [[Panellinios Athens]] complexes are illegally on the premises of the [[Athens Municipality]] and the [[Athens Prefecture]]. In February 2007, a penalty of 48 months imprisonment without suspension, and a fine of [[Euro sign|€]]15,000 [[euros]] was placed on Kyriakou for the arbitrary construction of a cottage property in San Aimilianos in [[Porto Heli]]. Namely, the construction of a harbor that was in violation of not only the winter tide, but also the future expansion of the coastline. As a result of this, Kyriakou appealed the ruling of the court and he was then asked to pay a fee of €100,000 euros in financial security costs until the appeal trial could be held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paron.gr/v3/new.php?id=12473&amp;colid=&amp;catid=28&amp;dt=2007-02-11%200:0:0|title=TO ΠΑΡΟΝ ΤΗΣ ΚΥΡΙΑΚΗΣ|publisher=|accessdate=10 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.kathimerini.gr/4dcgi/_w_articles_ell_2_29/03/2008_264467 News.kathimerini.gr - Εγγύηση Κυριακού μέχρι τη δίκη. {{el icon}}] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120711110713/http://news.kathimerini.gr/4dcgi/_w_articles_ell_2_29/03/2008_264467 |date=11 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galera.gr/magazine/modules/articles/article.php?id=715|title=Account Suspended|publisher=|accessdate=10 September 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303025657/http://www.galera.gr/magazine/modules/articles/article.php?id=715|archivedate=3 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In December 2004, Kyriakou married the Greek actress Mari Konstantatou (b. 1971).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicheaven.gr/html/modules.php?name=Blog&amp;file=page&amp;op=viewPost&amp;pid=19573|title=Μίνως Κυριακού ο φασίστας - Βιογραφία - Νεοέλληνας..|publisher=|accessdate=10 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They announced their divorce in March 2017.&lt;ref name="athens-times1"&gt;{{cite web|author=A.I. |url=http://www.athens-times.com/greece/minos-kyriakou-what-kind-of-diet-will-give-to-marie-after-the-divorce/ |title=Minos Kyriakou: What kind of diet will give to Marie after the divorce? |publisher=Athens Times |date=9 March 2017 |accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Simpson |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/billionaires-wife-fled-on-private-jet-with-a-stash-of-family-jewels-mvrsv88gd |title=Billionaire’s wife ‘fled on private jet with a stash of family jewels’ &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; The Times &amp; The Sunday Times |publisher=Thetimes.co.uk |date=20 March 2017 |accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He had two sons, [[Xenophon Kyriakou|Xenophon]] and [[Theodore Kyriakou|Theodore]], and a daughter, Athina, from his first marriage.&lt;ref name="mlahanas.de"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/NewEnterprise/MinosKyriakou.html|title=Minos Kyriakou|publisher=|accessdate=10 September 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304202231/http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/NewEnterprise/MinosKyriakou.html|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="athens-times1"/&gt;

'''Patricia Helen "Pat" Kennedy Lawford''' (May 6, 1924 – September 17, 2006) was an American socialite and the sixth of nine children of [[Rose Kennedy|Rose]] and [[Joseph P. Kennedy Sr.]] She was a sister of President [[John F. Kennedy]], Senator [[Robert F. Kennedy]], and Senator [[Ted Kennedy]]. Pat wanted to be a film producer, a profession not readily open to young women in her time. She married English actor [[Peter Lawford]] in 1954, but they experienced a serious culture-clash and divorced in 1966.

==Early life==
Patricia Helen Kennedy was born in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]]. She attended Roehampton Sacred Heart Convent School in London and Maplehurst Sacred Heart Convent School in [[Bronxville, New York]]. In 1945, she received a bachelor of arts degree from [[Rosemont College]], where she was active in both directing and acting in theatrical productions.&lt;ref name="jfk"&gt;{{cite web|title=Patricia Kennedy Lawford|url=https://www.jfklibrary.org/JFK/The-Kennedy-Family/Patricia-Kennedy-Lawford.aspx|website=John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum|accessdate=1 September 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170901192321/https://www.jfklibrary.org/JFK/The-Kennedy-Family/Patricia-Kennedy-Lawford.aspx|archivedate=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was considered the most sophisticated, yet also the most introverted, of her parents' five daughters. Since childhood she had a fascination with travel and [[Classical Hollywood cinema|Hollywood]]. In time she would become a world traveler, so much so that as a young girl she was given assignments by the independent and foreign press to write of her travels. Her ongoing fascination with Hollywood was fueled by her father's stories and adventures there as a movie mogul heading [[RKO Pictures]]. After graduating from Rosemont College, she moved to Hollywood in hopes of becoming a movie producer and director like her father.

Her father apparently believed that she could do as much, once saying, "Pat is the one with head for business. She could really run this town if she put her mind to it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalarchitectsguide.com/library/Patricia-Kennedy-Lawford.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119054410/http://www.globalarchitectsguide.com/library/Patricia-Kennedy-Lawford.php |archivedate=January 19, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because she was a woman in the very conservative 1950s,{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} she was restricted{{how|date=June 2016}} to working as a production assistant on patriotic and religious productions such as singer [[Kate Smith]]'s radio program and Father Peyton's ''[[Family Rosary Crusade]]''.&lt;ref name=jfk/&gt;

When she was 22 years old, Lawford was the producer of ''[[I Love to Eat]]'', on [[NBC]]-TV; it was the first cooking program on network television.&lt;ref name="rbf"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robertson|first1=Patrick|title=Robertson's Book of Firsts: Who Did What for the First Time|date=2011|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA|isbn=9781608197385|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2TEEaCrPiWsC&amp;pg=PT802&amp;dq=%22I+Love+to+Eat%22+NBC&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj1mbK8gIPWAhWl1IMKHWIaDbIQ6AEIOjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=%22I%20Love%20to%20Eat%22%20NBC&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
She met English actor [[Peter Lawford]] through her sister [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver|Eunice]] in the 1940s. They met again in 1949, and again in 1953. They courted briefly and officially announced their engagement in February 1954. They married on April 24, 1954,&lt;ref group=note&gt;Her page on the website of the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum says that she and Lawford married on April 23, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jfk/&gt; at the [[Roman Catholic Church]] of St. Thomas More in New York City, twelve days before her thirtieth birthday. They settled in [[Santa Monica, California]], and often socialized with actress [[Judy Garland]] and her family. Garland gave birth to her son Joseph at the same hospital and on the same day Kennedy gave birth to her son Christopher.

The couple had four children, all born in [[Santa Monica, California]]: [[Christopher Lawford|Christopher Kennedy Lawford]] (1955-2018), Sydney Maleia Lawford (b. 1956), Victoria Francis Lawford (b. 1958), and Robin Elizabeth Lawford (b. 1961).

Despite the glamorous persona Lawford presented, their relationship suffered strains as early as their brief engagement. Lawford had difficulty adjusting to Kennedy's steadfast Catholicism and her family's larger-than-life image. Kennedy could not tolerate Lawford's heavy drinking, extramarital affairs, and gradual addiction to drugs. Shortly after [[assassination of John F. Kennedy|her brother Jack's death]], she filed for a legal separation, and the couple was officially divorced in February 1966. She never remarried.

== Later years ==
[[File:KennedyGorbi.jpg|right|thumb|With Lawford (far right) are Senator [[Ted Kennedy]], [[Jean Kennedy Smith]], [[Raisa Gorbachyova]], and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].]]

After her divorce, Kennedy battled alcoholism and suffered from [[tongue cancer]]. She worked with the [[John F. Kennedy Library|John F. Kennedy Library and Museum]], as well as with the National Center on Addiction, and was a founder of the National Committee for the Literary Arts, for which she arranged a series of author lectures and scholarships.

==Death==
Kennedy died of [[pneumonia]] at age of 82 on September 17, 2006 in her [[Manhattan]] home.  She was buried in [[Southampton Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Patricia Kennedy Lawford Dies at 82  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/18/us/18lawford.html | work=[[New York Times]] |date=September 18, 2006 |accessdate=2008-10-16 | first=Andrew | last=Jacobs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Prison Tycoon''''' is a [[business simulation game|business simulation]] [[computer game]] developed by Virtual Playground and published by [[ValuSoft]] in [[2005 in video gaming|July 2005]] that puts the user in charge of a [[prison]]. Objectives are to keep the prison running, keep the staff happy, keep the prisoners in line, all while trying to make money.

Users are allowed to choose between a [[New England]] prison, a modern [[Southwestern United States|U.S. Southwestern]]-style prison, and a [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]-style prison modelled after [[San Quentin State Prison|San Quentin]].

A sequel, ''Prison Tycoon 2: Maximum Security'', was released on September 8, 2006, followed by ''Prison Tycoon 3: Lockdown'' in 2007 and ''Prison Tycoon 4: Supermax'' in 2008, then ''Prison Tycoon: Alcatraz'' in late 2010.

Also, [[THQ Wireless]] released a version of Prison Tycoon for the [[iPhone]] in May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/prison-tycoon/id313348437?mt=8|title=iPhone App|publisher=Apple|accessdate=2010-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

''Prison Tycoon'' has generally received poor grades from critics. ''[[X-Play]]''{{'}}s Time Stevens gave the game only one star out of five, concluding his review by writing that "Prisons aren't supposed to be fun, so maybe it shouldn't be a surprise that a game about prisons isn't either."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://g4tv.com/xplay/reviews/1239/Prison_Tycoon.html|title=Prison Tycoon|publisher=G4tv.com|accessdate=2009-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; GameZone gives the game a score of 5/10, praising the idea and concept but complaining about clunky graphics, dysfunctional camera angles and lack of instructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pc.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r27725.htm|title=Prison Tycoon Review|publisher=GameZone|accessdate=2009-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of common complaints of the game include bad camera angles, lackluster graphics, choppy or slow framerates, annoying music and sound, and limited help for players; while most players agreed the concept was neat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/prisontycoon/player_review.html?id=235832&amp;tag=player-reviews|title=Prison Tycoon Player Reviews|publisher=Gamespot|accessdate=2010-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==

The premise of the game is to create a functional prison complete with walls, guard towers, housing wings, dining, workout and medical facilities. The objective of the game is ultimately to turn your low security incarceration facility into a profitable maximum security prison. Funding is collected by the player through state funding, charitable donations and inmate labor depending on a myriad factors, such as employee satisfaction and inmate happiness and rehabilitation. You have the option to start with a completely blank slate in a free-play mode or with the basic layout of an existing prison with several problems that need to be addressed in the challenge mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prisontycoon.com/pages/features.htm |title=Prison Tycoon Features |publisher=ValuSoft |accessdate=2010-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330061234/http://www.prisontycoon.com/pages/features.htm |archivedate=March 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The challenges range from rehabilitating a certain number of inmates, reducing the number of riots and fights within the prison or simply to reaching a certain level of security.  To create a prison the player places buildings or walls along a grid system  by selecting which building they would like and placing it somewhere within the boundaries of the map.  There are over 100 different buildings that can be constructed.  Within certain buildings the player can build different rooms from over 100 to choose from, such as rooms with multiple beds within one cell or solitary confinement cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prisontycoon.com/pages/features.htm|title=Prison Tycoon Features|publisher=ValuSoft|accessdate=2010-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Buildings come with their appropriate staffing, for example guard towers come with guards already positioned in the tower and medical facilities come with medical staffing.

Once a player has constructed sufficient housing and basic amenities, prisoners begin arriving on buses depending on the capacity of the prison.  Prisoners continue to arrive as long as there is sufficient capacity to hold them and depart as they complete their sentences.  As the number of inmates increases the prison upgrades to a higher security level, beginning at low security until it becomes a maximum security prison.  With higher levels of security the player has access to more advanced facilities and upgraded walls and guard towers.

Players are able to click on both inmates and staff to get a basic description of their levels of satisfaction, fatigue, productivity, as well as misconduct for prisoners.  Players are also able to assign prisoners to cells, jobs and activities by clicking on one of these things with the prisoner selected.  Also, players can drag and drop guards to areas of high misconduct or to break up riots which occur within the prison if prisoners become too dissatisfied.

===Inmates===
[[Image:Prisontycoonriot.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Rioting prisoners being subdued by the guards.]]

The game designers created 96 different looking inmates capable of over 100 different animations to allow for a varied prison population.  Inmates have various meters above their heads which the player can monitor by clicking on the prisoners.  They have levels of satisfaction, fatigue, productivity and misconduct.  If inmates do not have activities, such as working out, playing basketball or performing work they will become dissatisfied and their misconduct meter will increase.  Having high misconduct will result in decreased productivity and an increase in fights and riots breaking out within the prison.

Ultimately, it is important to monitor inmate morale and keep it high to increase profits, as high inmate morale and sufficient rooming will result in more inmates arriving.  Also, the player has the ability to suggest inmates to the parole board, for possible early dismissal.  The approval or rejection of a prisoner is based upon the number of fights he has been in, the number of gangs he is affiliated with, the number of rehabilitation projects he has completed as well as his misconduct rating.

'''Robert Edward Lee''' (January 19, 1807&amp;nbsp;– October 12, 1870) was an American and Confederate soldier, best known as a commander of the  [[Confederate States Army]]. He commanded the [[Army of Northern Virginia]] in the [[American Civil War]] from 1862 until his surrender in 1865. A son of Revolutionary War officer [[Henry Lee III|Henry "Light Horse Harry" Lee III]], Lee was a top graduate of the [[United States Military Academy]] and an exceptional officer and [[military engineer]] in the [[United States Army]] for 32 years. During this time, he served throughout the United States, distinguished himself during the [[Mexican–American War]], and served as [[Superintendent of the United States Military Academy]].

When Virginia declared its secession from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] in April 1861, Lee chose to follow his home state, despite his desire for the country to remain intact and an offer of a senior Union command.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/robert-e-lee%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%9Cseverest-struggle%E2%80%9D|first=Elizabeth Brown|last=Pryor|title=Robert E. Lee's 'Severest Struggle'|publisher=American Heritage|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the first year of the Civil War, Lee served as a senior military adviser to [[President of the Confederate States of America|Confederate President]] [[Jefferson Davis]]. Once he took command of the main field army in 1862 he soon emerged as a shrewd tactician and battlefield commander, winning most of his battles, all against far superior Union armies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Josiah|last=Bunting|title=Ulysses S.

Grant]] at [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|Appomattox Court House]] on April 9, 1865. By this time, Lee had assumed supreme command of the remaining Southern armies; other Confederate forces swiftly capitulated after his surrender. Lee rejected the proposal of a sustained insurgency against the Union and called for reconciliation between the two sides.

In 1865, after the war, Lee was paroled and signed an [[Loyalty oath|oath of allegiance]], asking to have his [[citizenship of the United States]] restored. Lee's application was misplaced; as a result, he did not receive a pardon and his citizenship was not restored.&lt;ref name="Parole"&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2005/spring/piece-lee.html General Robert E. Lee's Parole and Citizenship], ''Prologue'', Spring 2005, Vol. 37, No. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1865, Lee became president of Washington College (later [[Washington and Lee University]]) in [[Lexington, Virginia]]; in that position, he supported reconciliation between North and South.&lt;ref name="Romero"&gt;Simon Romero, [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/22/us/lee-family-confederate-monuments-legacy.html 'The Lees Are Complex': Descendants Grapple With a Rebel General's Legacy], ''New York Times'' (August 22, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Lee accepted "the extinction of slavery" provided for by the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], but publicly opposed [[racial equality]] and granting [[African American]]s the right to vote and other political rights.&lt;ref&gt;John McKee Barr.

In 1975, the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] posthumously restored Lee's citizenship effective June 13, 1865.&lt;ref name="Parole"/&gt;

Lee opposed the construction of public memorials to Confederate rebellion on the grounds that they would prevent the healing of wounds inflicted during the war.&lt;ref name="Romero"/&gt; Nevertheless, after his death, Lee became an icon used by promoters of "[[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|Lost Cause]]" mythology, who sought to romanticize the Confederate cause and strengthen [[white supremacy]] in the South.&lt;ref name="Romero"/&gt; Later in the 20th century, particularly following the [[civil rights movement]], historians reassessed Lee; his reputation fell based on his failure to support rights for [[Freedman|freedmen]] after the war, and even his strategic choices as a military leader fell under scrutiny.&lt;ref name="Foner"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2017/05/19/the-truth-about-confederate-gen-robert-e-lee-he-wasnt-very-good-at-his-job/ |title= Analysis {{!}} The truth about Confederate Gen.

==Early life and career==
{{double image|right| Stratford hall habs 1.jpg|220| Lee Fendall House from the street.JPG |205|&lt;center&gt;[[Stratford Hall (plantation)|Stratford Hall]], Westmoreland County&lt;br /&gt;the family seat, Lee's birthplace&lt;/center&gt;|&lt;center&gt;Oronoco Street, Alexandria, Virginia&lt;br /&gt;"[[Lee Corner]]" properties &lt;/center&gt;}}

Lee was born at [[Stratford Hall Plantation]] in [[Westmoreland County, Virginia]], to [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Henry Lee III]] (Light Horse Harry) (1756–1818), [[Governor of Virginia]], and his second wife, [[Anne Hill Carter Lee|Anne Hill Carter]] (1773–1829). His birth date has traditionally been recorded as January 19, 1807, but according to the historian [[Elizabeth Brown Pryor]], "Lee's writings indicate he may have been born the previous year."&lt;ref&gt;Pryor, Elizabeth Brown (October 29, 2009). [http://encyclopediavirginia.org/Lee_Robert_Edward_1807-1870 "Robert E. Lee (ca. 1806–1870)"]. [http://encyclopediavirginia.org/ Encyclopedia Virginia]. Retrieved February 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Lee's great grandparents, [[Henry Lee I]], was a prominent [[History of Virginia#Colonial period|Virginian colonist]] of [[English descent]].&lt;ref&gt;William Thorndale, "The Parents of Colonel Richard Lee of Virginia," ''National Genealogical Society Quarterly'' 76 (December 1988): 253–68&lt;/ref&gt; Lee's family is one of [[First Families of Virginia|Virginia's first families]], descended from [[Richard Lee I]], Esq., "the Immigrant" (1618–64), from the county of [[Shropshire]] in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freeman|1934}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee's mother grew up at [[Shirley Plantation]], one of the most elegant homes in Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;His maternal great-great grandfather, [[Robert "King" Carter]] of [[Corotoman]], was the wealthiest man in [[Thirteen Colonies|the colonies]] when he died in 1732.&lt;/ref&gt; Lee's father, a tobacco planter, suffered severe financial reverses from failed investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=William C.|last1=Davis|last2=Pohanka|first2=Brian C.|last3=Troiani|first3=Don|title=Civil War Journal, The Leaders|publisher=Rutledge Hill Press|year=1997|isbn=978-0-517-22193-8|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Little is known of Lee as a child; he rarely spoke of his boyhood as an adult.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fellman|2000|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing is known of his relationship with his father who, after leaving his family, mentioned Robert only once in a letter. When given the opportunity to visit his father's Georgia grave, he remained there only briefly; yet, during his time as president of Washington College, he defended his father in a biographical sketch while editing Light Horse Harry's memoirs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fellman|2000|pp=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Coat of Arms of the Lee Family.svg|thumb|upright|left|Coat of Arms of Robert E. Lee]]

In 1809, Harry Lee was put in [[debtors prison]]; soon after his release the following year, Harry and Anne Lee and their five children moved to a small house on Cameron Street in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], both because there were then high quality local schools there, and because several members of her extended family lived nearby.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1995|pp=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1811, the family, including the newly born sixth child, Mildred, moved to a house on Oronoco Street, still close to the center of town and with the houses of a number of Lee relatives close by.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1995|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1812, Harry Lee was badly injured in a political riot in Baltimore and traveled to the [[West Indies]]. He would never return, dying when his son Robert was eleven years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1995|pp=32–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Left to raise six children alone in straitened circumstances, Anne Lee and her family often paid extended visits to relatives and family friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1995|pp=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Lee attended school at Eastern View, a school for young gentlemen, in [[Fauquier County, Virginia|Fauquier County]], and then at the Alexandria Academy, free for local boys, where he showed an aptitude for mathematics. Although brought up to be a practicing Christian, he was not confirmed in the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] until age 46.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1995|pp=38–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anne Lee's family was often supported by a relative, [[William Henry Fitzhugh]], who owned the Oronoco Street house and allowed the Lees to stay at his home in [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]], [[Ravensworth (plantation)|Ravensworth]]. When Robert was 17 in 1824, Fitzhugh wrote to the [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]], [[John C. Calhoun]], urging that Robert be given an appointment to the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point. Fitzhugh wrote little of Robert's academic prowess, dwelling much on the prominence of his family, and erroneously stated the boy was 18. Instead of mailing the letter, Fitzhugh had young Robert deliver it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fellman|2000|pp=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1824, Robert Lee received his appointment to West Point, but due to the large number of cadets admitted, Lee would have to wait a year to begin his studies there.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freeman|1991|pp=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation not found}}

Lee entered West Point in the summer of 1825. At the time, the focus of the curriculum was engineering; the head of the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] supervised the school and the superintendent was an engineering officer. Cadets were not permitted leave until they had finished two years of study, and were rarely allowed off the Academy grounds. Lee graduated second in his class, behind only [[Charles Mason (Iowa judge)|Charles Mason]],&lt;ref name="Davis21" /&gt; (who resigned from the Army a year after graduation). Lee did not incur any demerits during his four-year course of study, a distinction shared by five of his 45&amp;nbsp;classmates. In June 1829, Lee was commissioned a [[brevet (military)|brevet]] second lieutenant in the Corps of Engineers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1995|pp=48–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduation, while awaiting assignment, he returned to Virginia to find his mother on her deathbed; she died at Ravensworth on July 26, 1829.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1995|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military engineer career==
[[File:Robert E Lee 1838.jpg|thumb|upright=.8|right|Lee at age 31 in 1838, as a Lieutenant of Engineers in the U.S. Army]]
On August 11, 1829, Brigadier General [[Charles Gratiot]] ordered Lee to [[Cockspur Island]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The plan was to build a fort on the marshy island which would command the outlet of the [[Savannah River]]. Lee was involved in the early stages of construction as the island was being drained and built up.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1995|pp=57–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1831, it became apparent that the existing plan to build what became known as [[Fort Pulaski]] would have to be revamped, and Lee was transferred to [[Fort Monroe]] at the tip of the [[Virginia Peninsula]] (today in [[Hampton, Virginia]]).&lt;ref name="bunker"&gt;{{harvnb|Freeman|1997|pp=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation not found}}

While home in the summer of 1829, Lee had apparently courted [[Mary Anna Custis Lee|Mary Custis]] whom he had known as a child. Lee obtained permission to write to her before leaving for Georgia, though Mary Custis warned Lee to be "discreet" in his writing, as her mother read her letters, especially from men.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1995|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Custis refused Lee the first time he asked to marry her; her father did not believe the son of the disgraced Light Horse Harry Lee was a suitable man for his daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fellman|2000|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; She accepted him with her father's consent in September 1830, while he was on summer leave,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1995|pp=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the two were wed on June 30, 1831.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1995|pp=64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee's duties at Fort Monroe were varied, typical for a junior officer, and ranged from budgeting to designing buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freeman|1997|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation not found}} Although Mary Lee accompanied her husband to [[Hampton Roads]], she spent about a third of her time at Arlington, though the couple's first son, [[George Washington Custis Lee|Custis Lee]] was born at Fort Monroe. Although the two were by all accounts devoted to each other, they were different in character: Robert Lee was tidy and punctual, qualities his wife lacked. Mary Lee also had trouble transitioning from being a rich man's daughter to having to manage a household with only one or two slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fellman|2000|pp=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1832, Robert Lee had a close but platonic relationship with Harriett Talcott, wife of his fellow officer [[Andrew Talcott]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1995|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{double image|left|Fort Monroe Map.jpg |150|Lee ft dm rapids 1837.jpg|200|&lt;center&gt;[[Fort Monroe]], Hampton&lt;br /&gt;Lee's early duty station&lt;/center&gt;|&lt;center&gt;[[Montrose, Iowa|Fort Des Moines]], Montrose&lt;br /&gt;Lee's hand-drawn sketch&lt;/center&gt;}}

Life at Fort Monroe was marked by conflicts between artillery and engineering officers. Eventually the War Department transferred all engineering officers away from Fort Monroe, except Lee, who was ordered to take up residence on the artificial island of [[Rip Raps]] across the river from Fort Monroe, where [[Fort Wool]] would eventually rise, and continue work to improve the island. Lee duly moved there, then discharged all workers and informed the War Department he could not maintain laborers without the facilities of the fort.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1995|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1834, Lee was transferred to Washington as General Gratiot's assistant.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1995|pp=74–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee had hoped to rent a house in Washington for his family, but was not able to find one; the family lived at Arlington, though Lieutenant Lee rented a room at a Washington boarding house for when the roads were impassable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freeman|1997|pp=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation not found}} In mid-1835, Lee was assigned to assist Andrew Talcott in surveying the southern border of Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1995|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; While on that expedition, he responded to a letter from an ill Mary Lee, which had requested he come to Arlington, "But why do you urge my ''immediate'' return,&lt;!-- comma in original before ampersand --&gt; &amp; tempt one in the ''strongest'' manner&lt;nowiki&gt;[?]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&amp;nbsp;... I rather require to be strengthened &amp; encouraged to the ''full'' performance of what I am called on to execute."&lt;ref name="bunker" /&gt; Lee completed the assignment and returned to his post in Washington, finding his wife ill at Ravensworth. Mary Lee, who had recently given birth to their second child, remained bedridden for several months. In October 1836, Lee was promoted to first lieutenant.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1995|pp=83–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee served as an assistant in the chief engineer's office in Washington, D.C. from 1834 to 1837, but spent the summer of 1835 helping to lay out the state line between [[Ohio]] and [[Michigan]]. As a [[First Lieutenant (United States)|first lieutenant]] of engineers in 1837, he supervised the engineering work for [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] harbor and for the upper [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] and [[Missouri River|Missouri]] rivers. Among his projects was the mapping of the [[Des Moines Rapids]] on the Mississippi above [[Keokuk, Iowa]], where the Mississippi's mean depth of {{convert|2.4|ft|m|1}} was the upper limit of steamboat traffic on the river. His work there earned him a promotion to [[Captain (United States O-3)|captain]]. Around 1842, Captain Robert E. Lee arrived as [[Fort Hamilton]]'s post engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723015836/http://www.nad.usace.army.mil/fh.htm|archivedate=July 23, 2011|url=http://www.nad.usace.army.mil/fh.htm |title=Welcome to Fort Hamilton |publisher=United States Army Corps of Engineers |accessdate=October 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and family==
[[File:Robert E Lee 1845.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Robert E. Lee, around age 38, and his son [[William Henry Fitzhugh Lee]], around age 8, c.1845]]
While Lee was stationed at Fort Monroe, he married [[Mary Anna Custis Lee|Mary Anna Randolph Custis]] (1808–73), great-granddaughter of [[Martha Washington]] by her first husband [[Daniel Parke Custis]], and step-great-granddaughter of [[George Washington]], the first president of the United States. &lt;!-- This is a confusing sentence; until it can be clarified, it is being omitted. Among his wife's ancestors were Charles II through Lady Charlotte Lee and (as supposed) of George I from Melusina von der Schulenburg, an illegitimate daughter of George I who may have been the mother of Henry Swingate Calvert, illegitimate son by the 5th Baron Calvert whose daughter Eleanor Calvert married George Washington's step-son, John Parke Custis. --&gt; Mary was the only surviving child of [[George Washington Parke Custis]], George Washington's stepgrandson, and [[Mary Lee Fitzhugh Custis]], daughter of [[William Fitzhugh]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=William Fitzhugh |url=http://www.nps.gov/frsp/fitzchm.htm |publisher=[[Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park]], [[National Park Service]] |accessdate=July 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ann Bolling Randolph Fitzhugh|Ann Bolling Randolph]]. Robert and Mary married on June 30, 1831, at [[Arlington House, The Robert E. Lee Memorial|Arlington House]], her parents' house just across from Washington, D.C. The 3rd U.S. Artillery served as honor guard at the marriage. They eventually had seven children, three boys and four girls:{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Lee distinguished himself in the [[Mexican–American War]] (1846–48). He was one of [[Winfield Scott]]'s chief aides in the march from [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]] to Mexico City. He was instrumental in several American victories through his personal reconnaissance as a staff officer; he found routes of attack that the [[Mexico|Mexicans]] had not defended because they thought the terrain was impassable.

He was promoted to [[brevet (military)|brevet]] major after the [[Battle of Cerro Gordo]] on April 18, 1847.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freeman|1934|p=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also fought at [[Battle of Contreras|Contreras]], [[Battle of Churubusco|Churubusco]], and [[Battle of Chapultepec|Chapultepec]] and was wounded at the last. By the end of the war, he had received additional brevet promotions to lieutenant colonel and colonel, but his permanent rank was still captain of engineers, and he would remain a captain until his transfer to the [[cavalry]] in 1855.

For the first time, Robert E. Lee and [[Ulysses S. Grant]] met and worked with each other during the Mexican–American War. Close observations of their commanders constituted a learning process for both Lee and Grant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vahistorical.org/collections-and-resources/virginia-history-explorer/lee-and-grant/war?legacy=true|title=Lee and Grant &amp;#124; Before the War|publisher=Virginia Historical Society|accessdate=October 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mexican–American War concluded on February 2, 1848.

After the Mexican War, Lee spent three years at [[Fort Carroll]] in [[Baltimore]] harbor. During this time, his service was interrupted by other duties, among them surveying and updating maps in Florida. Cuban revolutionary [[Narciso López]] intended to forcibly liberate Cuba from Spanish rule. In 1849, searching for a leader for his [[Filibuster (military)|filibuster]] expedition, he approached Jefferson Davis, then a United States senator. Davis declined and suggested Lee, who also declined. Both decided it was inconsistent with their duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1995|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Early 1850s: West Point and Texas==
The 1850s were a difficult time for Lee, with his long absences from home, the increasing disability of his wife, troubles in taking over the management of a large slave plantation, and his often morbid concern with his personal failures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Thomas Lawrence|last=Connelly|title=The Marble Man: Robert E. Lee and His Image in American society|location=New York|publisher=[[Alfred A. Knopf]]|year=1977|isbn=978-0-394-47179-2|pages=176–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1852, Lee was appointed Superintendent of the [[United States Military Academy|Military Academy at West Point]].&lt;ref name=Davis111&gt;{{harvnb|Davis|1999|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was reluctant to enter what he called a "snake pit", but the War Department insisted and he obeyed. His wife occasionally came to visit. During his three years at West Point, Brevet Colonel Robert E. Lee improved the buildings and courses and spent much time with the cadets. Lee's oldest son, George Washington Custis Lee, attended West Point during his tenure. Custis Lee graduated in 1854, first in his class.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1995|pp=152–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee was enormously relieved to receive a long-awaited promotion as second-in-command of the [[5th Cavalry Regiment|2nd Cavalry Regiment]] in Texas in 1855. It meant leaving the Engineering Corps and its sequence of staff jobs for the combat command he truly wanted. He served under Colonel [[Albert Sidney Johnston]] at [[Camp Cooper]], Texas; their mission was to protect settlers from attacks by the [[Apache Tribe|Apache]] and the [[Comanche]].

==Late 1850s: Arlington plantation and the Custis slaves==
{{double image|right|Arlington House pre-1861.jpg|210|Interior, Christ Church, Alexandria, Virginia.png|210|&lt;center&gt;[[Arlington House, The Robert E. Lee Memorial|Arlington House]], Arlington&lt;br /&gt;Mary Custis's inheritance in 1857&lt;/center&gt;|&lt;center&gt;[[Christ Church (Alexandria, Virginia)|Christ Church]], Alexandria, where the Lees worshiped&lt;/center&gt;}}

In 1857, his father-in-law [[George Washington Parke Custis]] died, creating a serious crisis when Lee took on the burden of executing the will. Custis's will encompassed vast landholdings and hundreds of slaves balanced against massive debts, and required Custis's former slaves "to be emancipated by my executors in such manner as to my executors may seem most expedient and proper, the said emancipation to be accomplished in not exceeding five years from the time of my decease."&lt;ref name="nathanielturner.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nathanielturner.com/willofgeorgewashingtonparkecustis.htm|title=Will of George Washington Parke Custis|publisher=ChickenBones: A Journal for Literary &amp; Artistic African-American Themes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The estate was in disarray, and the plantations had been poorly managed and were losing money.&lt;ref name="McElya2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Micki McElya|title=The Politics of Mourning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iHbEDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT24|date=August 15, 2016|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-97406-7|pages=24–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Lee tried to hire an overseer to handle the plantation in his absence, writing to his cousin, "I wish to get an energetic honest farmer, who while he will be considerate &amp; kind to the negroes, will be firm &amp; make them do their duty."&lt;ref name=Fellman65&gt;{{harvnb|Fellman|2000|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Lee failed to find a man for the job, and had to take a two-year leave of absence from the army in order to run the plantation himself.

Lee's cruelty on the Arlington plantation nearly led to a slave revolt, since many of the slaves had been given to understand that they were to be made free as soon as Custis died, and protested angrily at the delay.&lt;ref name=Blassingame467to468&gt;Wesley Norris, [http://fair-use.org/national-anti-slavery-standard/1866/04/14/robert-e-lee-his-brutality-to-his-slaves interview] in ''National Anti-Slavery Standard'' (April 14, 1866) 4, reprinted in {{harvnb|Blassingame|1977|pp= 467–468}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1858, Lee wrote to his son Rooney, "I have had some trouble with some of the people. Reuben, Parks &amp; Edward, in the beginning of the previous week, rebelled against my authority—refused to obey my orders, &amp; said they were as free as I was, etc., etc.—I succeeded in capturing them &amp; lodging them in jail. They resisted till overpowered &amp; called upon the other people to rescue them."&lt;ref name=Fellman65 /&gt; Less than two months after they were sent to the [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] jail, Lee decided to remove these three men and three female house slaves from Arlington, and sent them under lock and key to the slave-trader William Overton Winston in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], who was instructed to keep them in jail until he could find "good &amp; responsible" slaveholders to work them until the end of the five-year period.&lt;ref name=Fellman65 /&gt;

Lee ruptured the Washington and Custis tradition of respecting slave families and by 1860 he had broken up every family but one on the estate, some of whom had been together since Mount Vernon days.&lt;ref name="Elizabeth Brown Pryor"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Reading_the_Man.html?id=8oLT37IFiIQC|title=Reading the Man: A Portrait of Robert E.

===The Norris case===
In 1859, three of the Arlington slaves—Wesley Norris, his sister Mary, and a cousin of theirs—fled for the North, but were captured a few miles from the [[Pennsylvania]] border and forced to return to Arlington. On June 24, 1859, the anti-slavery newspaper ''[[New York Tribune|New York Daily Tribune]]'' published two anonymous letters (dated June 19, 1859&lt;ref&gt;[http://fair-use.org/new-york-tribune/1859/06/24/letter-from-a-citizen Letter from "A Citizen,"] ''New York Tribune'', June 24, 1859. {{harvnb|Freeman|1934|p= 393}}&lt;/ref&gt; and June 21, 1859&lt;ref&gt;[http://fair-use.org/new-york-tribune/1859/06/24/some-facts-that-should-come-to-light "Some Facts That Should Come To Light,"] ''New York Tribune'', June 24, 1859. {{harvnb|Freeman|1934|pp= 390–393}}&lt;/ref&gt;), each claiming to have heard that Lee had the Norrises whipped, and each going so far as to claim that the overseer refused to whip the woman but that Lee took the whip and flogged her personally. Lee privately wrote to his son Custis that "The N. Y. Tribune has attacked me for my treatment of your grandfather's slaves, but I shall not reply. He has left me an unpleasant legacy."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freeman|1934|pp= 390–392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wesley Norris himself spoke out about the incident after the war, in an 1866 interview printed in an abolitionist newspaper, the ''[[National Anti-Slavery Standard]]''. Norris stated that after they had been captured, and forced to return to Arlington, Lee told them that "he would teach us a lesson we would not soon forget." According to Norris, Lee then had the three of them firmly tied to posts by the overseer, and ordered them whipped with fifty lashes for the men and twenty for Mary Norris. Norris claimed that Lee encouraged the whipping, and that when the overseer refused to do it, called in the county constable to do it instead. Unlike the anonymous letter writers, he does not state that Lee himself whipped any of the slaves. According to Norris, Lee "frequently enjoined [Constable] Williams to 'lay it on well,' an injunction which he did not fail to heed; not satisfied with simply lacerating our naked flesh, Gen. Lee then ordered the overseer to thoroughly wash our backs with [[brine]], which was done."&lt;ref name=Blassingame467to468 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wesley Norris, [http://fair-use.org/wesley-norris/testimony-of-wesley-norris "Testimony of Wesley Norris"], ''National Anti-Slavery Standard'', April 14, 1866.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Norris men were then sent by Lee's agent to work on the railroads in Virginia and [[Alabama]].  According to the interview, Norris was sent to Richmond in January 1863 "from which place I finally made my escape through the rebel lines to freedom."  But Federal authorities reported that Norris came within their lines on September 5, 1863, and that he "left Richmond...with a pass from General Custis Lee."&lt;ref&gt;''War of the Rebellion:  Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies'', Series 1, Volume 29, part 2, pp.158–159 (Meade to Halleck, September 6, 1863--4 p.m.).

Biographers of Lee have differed over the credibility of the account of the punishment as described in the letters in the ''Tribune'' and in Norris's personal account. They broadly agree that Lee had a group of escaped slaves recaptured, and that after recapturing them he hired them out off of the Arlington plantation as a punishment; but they disagree over the likelihood that Lee flogged them, and over the charge that he personally whipped Mary Norris. In 1934, [[Douglas S. Freeman]] described them as "Lee's first experience with the extravagance of irresponsible antislavery agitators" and asserted that "There is no evidence, direct or indirect, that Lee ever had them or any other Negroes flogged. The usage at Arlington and elsewhere in Virginia among people of Lee's station forbade such a thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freeman|1934|p= 390}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Michael Fellman, in ''[[The Making of Robert E. Lee]]'', found the claims that Lee had ''personally'' whipped ''Mary'' Norris "extremely unlikely," but found it not at all unlikely that Lee had ordered the runaways whipped: "corporal punishment (for which Lee substituted the euphemism 'firmness') was (believed to be) an intrinsic and necessary part of slave discipline. Although it was supposed to be applied only in a calm and rational manner, overtly physical domination of slaves, unchecked by law, was always brutal and potentially savage."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fellman|2000|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Bernice-Marie Yates's ''The Perfect Gentleman'', cited Freeman's denial and followed his account in holding that, because of Lee's family connections to George Washington, he "was a prime target for abolitionists who lacked all the facts of the situation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bernice-Marie Yates|first=|title=The Perfect Gentleman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MZqqkgDWiUAC&amp;pg=PA181|year=2003|publisher=Xulon Press|pages=181–83|isbn=9781591604525}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee biographer Elizabeth Brown Pryor concluded in 2008 that "the facts are verifiable," based on "the consistency of the five extant descriptions of the episode (the only element that is not repeatedly corroborated is the allegation that Lee gave the beatings himself), as well as the existence of an account book that indicates the constable received compensation from Lee on the date that this event occurred."&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Brown Pryor, Reading the Man: A Portrait of Robert E. Lee Through His Private Letters (New York: Penguin, 2008), chapter 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ariel Burriss, [http://www.crossroadsofwar.org/wp-content/uploads/CWS_Robert-E.-Lees-Slaves.pdf "The Fugitive Slaves of Robert E. Lee: From Arlington to Westminster"].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Michael Korda wrote that "Although these letters are dismissed by most of Lee's biographers as exaggerated, or simply as unfounded abolitionist propaganda, it is hard to ignore them. [...] It seems incongruously out of character for Lee to have whipped a slave woman himself, particularly one stripped to the waist, and that charge may have been a flourish added by the two correspondents; it was not repeated by Wesley Norris when his account of the incident was published in 1866. [...] [A]lthough it seems unlikely that he would have done any of the whipping himself, he may not have flinched from observing it to make sure his orders were carried out exactly."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Korda|2014|p=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lee's views on race and slavery===
Several historians have noted the paradoxical nature of Lee's beliefs and actions concerning race and slavery. While Lee protested he had sympathetic feelings for blacks, they were subordinate to his own racial identity.&lt;ref name="Fellman73–74"&gt;{{harvnb|Fellman|2000|pp=73–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Lee held slavery to be an evil institution, he also saw some benefit to blacks held in slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, R. David. The Religious Life of Robert E. Lee 2017, {{ISBN|978-0-8028-7482-5}}, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; While Lee helped assist individual slaves to freedom in Liberia, and provided for their emancipation in his own will,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McCaslin|2001|pp=57–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; he believed the enslaved should be eventually freed in a general way only at some unspecified future date as a part of God's purpose.&lt;ref name="Fellman73–74"/&gt; Slavery for Lee was a moral and religious issue, and not one that would yield to political solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Korda|2014|p=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emancipation would sooner come from Christian impulse among slave masters before "storms and tempests of fiery controversy" such as was occurring in "[[Bleeding Kansas]]".&lt;ref name="Fellman73–74"/&gt; Countering southerners who argued for slavery as a positive good, Lee in his well-known analysis of slavery from an 1856 letter called it a moral and political evil. While both Robert and his wife Mary Lee were disgusted with slavery, they also defended it against [[Abolitionism |Abolitionist]] demands for immediate emancipation for all enslaved.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fellman|2000|pp=72–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Washington, Lee's father-in-law [[George Washington Parke Custis|G. W. Parke Custis]] freed his slaves in his will.&lt;ref name="McCaslin 2001 57"&gt;{{harvnb|McCaslin|2001|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same tradition, before leaving to serve in Mexico, Lee had written a will providing for the [[manumission]] of the only slaves he owned.&lt;ref name="McCaslin 2001 58"&gt;{{harvnb|McCaslin|2001|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parke Custis was a member of the [[American Colonization Society]], which was formed to gradually end slavery by establishing a free republic in [[Liberia]] for African-Americans, and Lee assisted several ex-slaves to emigrate there. Also, according to historian Richard B. McCaslin, Lee was a gradual emancipationist, denouncing extremist proposals for immediate abolition of slavery. Lee rejected what he called evilly motivated political passion, fearing a civil and servile war from precipitous emancipation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McCaslin|2001|pp=58–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Elizabeth Brown Pryor offered an alternative interpretation of Lee's voluntary manumission of slaves in his will, and assisting slaves to a life of freedom in Liberia, seeing Lee as conforming to a "primacy of slave law". She wrote that Lee's private views on race and slavery,
: "which today seem startling, were entirely unremarkable in Lee's world. No visionary, Lee nearly always tried to conform to accepted opinions. His assessment of black inferiority, of the necessity of racial stratification, the primacy of slave law, and even a divine sanction for it all, was in keeping with the prevailing views of other moderate slaveholders and a good many prominent Northerners."&lt;ref&gt;Pryor, Elizabeth Brown. [https://www.amazon.com/Reading-Man-Portrait-Through-Private/dp/0143113909 Reading the Man: A Portrait of Robert E. Lee through his private letters] (2008), p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

On taking on the role of administrator for the Parke Custis will, Lee used a provision to retain them in slavery to produce income for the estate to retire debt.&lt;ref name="McCaslin 2001 57"/&gt; Lee did not welcome the role of planter while administering the Custis properties at Romancoke, another nearby the Pamunkey River and Arlington; he rented the estate's mill. While all the estates prospered under his administration, Lee was unhappy at direct participation in slavery as a hated institution.&lt;ref name="McCaslin 2001 58"/&gt;

Even before what Michael Fellman called a "sorry involvement in actual slave management", Lee judged the experience of white mastery to be a greater moral evil to the white man than blacks suffering under the "painful discipline" of slavery which introduced Christianity, literacy and a work ethic to the "heathen African".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fellman|2000|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Columbia University historian&amp;nbsp;[[Eric Foner]] notes that:
: Lee "was not a pro-slavery ideologue. But I think equally important is that, unlike some white southerners, he never spoke out against slavery"&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/18/us/robert-e-lee-slaves.html |title= What Robert E.

Pryor notes in describing Lee's public silence on controversial sectional issues such as slavery, that the regular army "was an apolitical institution, which discouraged displays of partisan sentiment and muted any parochialism in its officers. At the military academy a cadet was 'taught that he belongs no longer to section or party but, in his life and all his faculties, to his country'."&lt;/ref&gt; and Lee did not speak out publicly on the subject of slavery prior to the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, Eric quoted in Fortin, Jacey.

"Lee believed in God's time, not man's, and God's disposition, not human politics. So when it came to grappling with the issue of slavery, he could not comprehend why men could not leave well enough alone....on major public conflicts, Lee had no active position."&lt;/ref&gt; Before the outbreak of the War, in 1860, Lee voted for [[John C. Breckinridge]], who was the extreme pro-slavery candidate in the 1860 presidential election, not [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]], the more moderate Southerner who won Virginia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Foner writes that "Lee's code of gentlemanly conduct did not seem to apply to blacks" during the War, as he did not stop his soldiers from kidnapping free black farmers and selling them into slavery.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Princeton University historian [[James M. McPherson]] noted that Lee initially rejected a [[American Civil War prison camps#Prisoner exchanges|prisoner exchange between the Confederacy and the Union]] when the Union demanded that black Union soldiers be included.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Lee did not accept the swap until a few months before the Confederacy's surrender.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In December 1864 Lee was shown a letter by Louisiana Senator [[Edward Sparrow]], written by General [[St. John Richardson Liddell|St. John R. Liddell]], which noted Lee would be hard-pressed in the interior of Virginia by spring, and the need to consider [[Patrick Cleburne]]'s plan to emancipate the slaves and put all men in the army who were willing to join. Lee was said to have agreed on all points and desired to get black soldiers, saying "he could make soldiers out of any human being that had arms and legs."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|Liddell|1997|pp= 192–193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the War, Lee told a congressional committee that blacks were "not disposed to work" and did not possess the intellectual capacity to vote and participate in politics.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Lee also said to the committee that he hoped that Virginia could "get rid of them," referring to blacks.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While not politically active, Lee defended Lincoln's successor, [[Andrew Johnson]]'s approach to Reconstruction, which according to Foner, "abandoned the former slaves to the mercy of governments controlled by their former owners."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/18/us/robert-e-lee-slaves.html |title=What Robert E.

In the generation following the war, Lee, though he died just a few years later, became a central figure in the [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|Lost Cause]] interpretation of the war. The argument that Lee had always somehow opposed slavery, and freed his wife's slaves, helped maintain his stature as a symbol of Southern honor and national reconciliation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Douglas Southall Freeman]]'s Pulitzer prize-winning four-volume ''R. E. Lee: A Biography'' (1936), which was for a long period considered the definitive work on Lee, downplayed his involvement in slavery and emphasized Lee as a virtuous person. Eric Foner, who describes Freeman's volume as a "[[wiktionary:hagiography|hagiography]]", notes that on the whole, Freeman "displayed little interest in Lee's relationship to slavery. The index to his four volumes contained 22 entries for 'devotion to duty', 19 for 'kindness', 53 for Lee's celebrated horse, [[Traveller (horse)| Traveller]]. But 'slavery', 'slave emancipation' and 'slave insurrection' together received five. Freeman observed, without offering details, that slavery in Virginia represented the system 'at its best'. He ignored the postwar testimony of Lee's former slave [[Wesley Norris]] about the brutal treatment to which he had been subjected."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Harpers Ferry and Texas, 1859–1861==
Both [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry|Harpers Ferry]] and the [[Texas in the American Civil War|secession of Texas]] were monumental events leading up to the Civil War. Robert E. Lee was at both events. Lee initially remained loyal to the Union after Texas seceded.

===Harpers Ferry===
[[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] led a band of 21 abolitionists who seized the [[Harpers Ferry Armory|federal arsenal]] at [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry]], Virginia, in October 1859, hoping to incite a slave rebellion. President [[James Buchanan]] gave Lee command of detachments of militia, soldiers, and [[United States Marines]], to suppress the uprising and arrest its leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freeman|1934|pp= 394–395}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time Lee arrived that night, the militia on the site had surrounded Brown and his hostages. At dawn, Brown refused the demand for surrender. Lee attacked, and Brown and his followers were captured after three minutes of fighting. Lee's summary report of the episode shows Lee believed it "was the attempt of a fanatic or madman". Lee said Brown achieved "temporary success" by creating panic and confusion and by "magnifying" the number of participants involved in the raid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/FTRIALS/johnbrown/leereport.html|title=Col.

===Texas===
In 1860, Lt. Col. Robert E. Lee relieved Major [[Samuel P. Heintzelman|Heintzelman]] at [[Fort Brown, Texas|Fort Brown]], and the Mexican authorities offered to restrain "their citizens from making predatory descents upon the territory and people of Texas...this was the last active operation of the [[Cortina War]]". [[Rip Ford]], a [[Texas Rangers Division|Texas Ranger]] at the time, described Lee as "dignified without hauteur, grand without pride...he evinced an imperturbable self-possession, and a complete control of his passions...possessing the capacity to accomplish great ends and the gift of controlling and leading men."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ford|first=John Salmon|title=Rip Ford's Texas|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Austin|year=1963|pages=305–306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Texas seceded from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] in February 1861, General [[David E. Twiggs]] surrendered all the American forces (about 4,000 men, including Lee, and commander of the Department of Texas) to the Texans. Twiggs immediately resigned from the U.S. Army and was made a Confederate general. Lee went back to Washington and was appointed Colonel of the First Regiment of Cavalry in March 1861. Lee's colonelcy was signed by the new President, Abraham Lincoln. Three weeks after his promotion, Colonel Lee was offered a senior command (with the rank of Major General) in the expanding Army to fight the Southern States that had left the Union. [[Fort Mason (Texas)|Fort Mason, Texas]] was Lee's last command with the United States Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Texas Forts Trails|magazine=Texas Monthly|date=June 1991|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil War==

===Resignation from United States Army===
Unlike many Southerners who expected a glorious war, Lee correctly predicted it as protracted and devastating.&lt;ref name="pryor20110419"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/19/the-general-in-his-study | title=The General in His Study | publisher=The New York Times | website=Disunion | date=April 19, 2011 | accessdate=April 19, 2011 | author=Pryor, Elizabeth Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt; He privately opposed the new [[Confederate States of America]] in letters in early 1861, denouncing secession as "nothing but revolution" and an unconstitutional betrayal of the efforts of the [[Founding Fathers]]. Writing to George Washington Custis in January, Lee stated:
{{bquote|The South, in my opinion, has been aggrieved by the acts of the North, as you say. I feel the aggression, and am willing to take every proper step for redress. It is the principle I contend for, not individual or private benefit. As an American citizen, I take great pride in my country, her prosperity and institutions, and would defend any State if her rights were invaded. But I can anticipate no greater calamity for the country than a dissolution of the Union. It would be an accumulation of all the evils we complain of, and I am willing to sacrifice everything but honor for its preservation. I hope, therefore, that all constitutional means will be exhausted before there is a resort to force. Secession is nothing but revolution. The framers of our Constitution never exhausted so much labor, wisdom, and forbearance in its formation, and surrounded it with so many guards and securities, if it was intended to be broken by every member of the Confederacy at will. It was intended for "perpetual union," so expressed in the preamble, and for the establishment of a government, not a compact, which can only be dissolved by revolution, or the consent of all the people in convention assembled.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://loa-shared.s3.amazonaws.com/static/pdf/Lee_Evils_of_Anarchy.pdf | title=Robert E. Lee to George Washington Custis Lee | publisher=The Library of America, 2011 | website=The Civil War: The First Year Told By Those Who Lived It | date=1906 | accessdate=19 November 2016 | author=[[J. William Jones]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Robert E Lee in 1863.png|thumb|Lee in uniform, 1863]]

Despite opposing secession, Lee said in January that "we can with a clear conscience separate" if all peaceful means failed. He agreed with secessionists in most areas, such as dislike of Northern anti-slavery criticisms and prevention of expanding slavery to new territories, and fear of its larger population. Lee supported the [[Crittenden Compromise]], which would have constitutionally protected slavery.{{r|test}}

Lee's objection to secession was ultimately outweighed by a sense of personal honor, reservations about the legitimacy of a strife-ridden "Union that can only be maintained by swords and bayonets", and duty to defend his native Virginia if attacked.&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt; He was asked while leaving Texas by a lieutenant if he intended to fight for the Confederacy or the Union, to which Lee replied, "I shall never bear arms against the Union, but it may be necessary for me to carry a musket in the defense of my native state, Virginia, in which case I shall not prove recreant to my duty".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freeman|1934|p= 425}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|test}}

Although Virginia had the most slaves of any state, it was more similar to Maryland, which stayed in the Union, than the Deep South; a convention voted against secession in early 1861. Scott, commanding general of the Union Army and Lee's mentor, told Lincoln he wanted him for a top command, telling Secretary of War [[Simon Cameron]] that he had "entire confidence" in Lee. He accepted a promotion to colonel of the [[1st Cavalry Regiment (United States)|1st Cavalry Regiment]] on March 28, again swearing an oath to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freeman|1934|pp=431–447}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|test}} Meanwhile, Lee ignored an offer of command from the Confederacy. After Lincoln's call for troops to put down the rebellion, a second Virginia convention in Richmond voted to secede{{r|kearns}} on April 17, and a May 23 referendum would likely ratify the decision. That night Lee dined with brother [[Sydney Smith Lee|Smith]] and cousin [[Samuel Phillips Lee|Phillips]], naval officers. Because of Lee's indecision, Phillips went to the War Department the next morning to warn that the Union might lose his cousin if the government did not act quickly.{{r|test}}

In Washington that day,{{r|pryor20110419}} Lee was offered by presidential advisor [[Francis P. Blair]] a role as major general to command the [[Civil War Defenses of Washington DC|defense of the national capital]]. He replied:
{{bquote|Mr. Blair, I look upon secession as anarchy. If I owned the four millions of slaves in the South I would sacrifice them all to the Union; but how can I draw my sword upon Virginia, my native state?&lt;ref name="kearns"&gt;{{cite book|first=Doris Kearns|last=Goodwin|title=Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CqjBCWV6Eu4C&amp;pg=PA350|year=2005|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=New York|page=350|isbn=9781416549833}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Lee immediately went to Scott, who tried to persuade him that Union forces would be large enough to prevent the South from fighting, so he would not have to oppose his state; Lee disagreed. When Lee asked if he could go home and not fight, the fellow Virginian said that the army did not need equivocal soldiers and that if he wanted to resign, he should do so before receiving official orders. Scott told him that he had made "the greatest mistake of your life".{{r|test}}

Lee agreed that to avoid dishonor he had to resign before receiving unwanted orders. While historians have usually called his decision inevitable ("the answer he was born to make", wrote [[Douglas Southall Freeman]]; another called it a "no-brainer") given the ties to family and state, an 1871 letter from his eldest daughter, Mary Custis Lee, to a biographer described Lee as "worn and harassed" yet calm as he deliberated alone in his office. People on the street noticed Lee's grim face as he tried to decide over the next two days, and he later said that he kept the resignation letter for a day before sending it on April 20. Two days later the Richmond convention invited Lee to the city. It elected him as commander of Virginia state forces before his arrival on April 23, and almost immediately gave him George Washington's sword as symbol of his appointment; whether he was told of a decision he did not want without time to decide, or did want the excitement and opportunity of command, is unclear.&lt;ref name=Davis21&gt;{{harvnb|Davis|1999|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|test}}{{r|pryor20110419}}

A cousin on Scott's staff told the family that Lee's decision so upset Scott that he collapsed on a sofa and mourned as if he had lost a son, and asked to not hear Lee's name. When Lee told family his decision he said "I suppose you will all think I have done very wrong", as the others were mostly pro-Union; only Mary Custis was a secessionist, and her mother especially wanted to choose the Union but told her husband that she would support whatever he decided. Many younger men like nephew [[Fitzhugh Lee|Fitzhugh]] wanted to support the Confederacy, but Lee's three sons joined the Confederate military only after their father's decision.{{r|test}}{{r|pryor20110419}}

Most family members like brother Smith reluctantly also chose the South, but Smith's wife and Anne, Lee's sister, still supported the Union; Anne's son joined the Union Army, and no one in his family ever spoke to Lee again. Many cousins fought for the Confederacy, but Phillips and John Fitzgerald told Lee in person that they would uphold their oaths; [[John H. Upshur]] stayed with the Union military despite much family pressure; [[Roger Jones (Inspector General)|Roger Jones]] stayed in the Union army after Lee refused to advise him on what to do; and two of [[Philip Richard Fendall II|Philip Fendall]]'s sons fought for the Union. Forty percent of Virginian officers stayed with the North.{{r|test}}{{r|pryor20110419}}

===Early role===
At the outbreak of war, Lee was appointed to command all of Virginia's forces, but upon the formation of the Confederate States Army, he was named one of its first five [[Full General (CSA)|full generals]]. Lee did not wear the insignia of a Confederate general, but only the three stars of a Confederate colonel, equivalent to his last U.S. Army rank.&lt;ref name=Davis49&gt;{{harvnb|Davis|1999|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not intend to wear a general's insignia until the Civil War had been won and he could be promoted, in peacetime, to general in the Confederate Army.

Lee's first field assignment was commanding Confederate forces in western Virginia, where he was defeated at the [[Battle of Cheat Mountain]] and was widely blamed for Confederate setbacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fellman|2000|loc=§&amp;nbsp;6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was then sent to organize the coastal defenses along the Carolina and Georgia seaboard, appointed commander, "Department of South Carolina, Georgia and Florida" on November 5, 1861. Between then and the fall of [[Battle of Fort Pulaski|Fort Pulaski]], April 11, 1862, he put in place a defense of Savannah that proved successful in blocking Federal advance on Savannah. Confederate fort and naval gunnery dictated night time movement and construction by the besiegers. Federal preparations required four months. In those four months, Lee developed a defense in depth. Behind Fort Pulaski on the Savannah River, [[Fort James Jackson|Fort Jackson]] was improved, and two additional batteries covered river approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Fort Pulaski's masonry was impervious to round shot, but it was penetrated in 30 hours by [[Parrott rifle]] guns, much to the surprise of senior commanders of both sides. In the future, Confederate breast works defending coastal areas were successfully protected against rifle-fired explosive projectiles with banks of dirt and sand such as at Fort McAllister. Later, holding the City of Savannah would allow two additional attempts at breaking the Union blockade with ironclads [[USS Atlanta (1861)|''CSS Atlanta'']] (1862) and [[CSS Savannah (ironclad)|''CSS Savannah'']] (1863).&lt;/ref&gt; In the face of the Union superiority in naval, artillery and infantry deployment, Lee was able to block any Federal advance on Savannah, and at the same time, well-trained Georgia troops were released in time to meet McClellan's Peninsula Campaign. The City of Savannah would not fall until [[Sherman's March to the Sea|Sherman's approach from the interior]] at the end of 1864.

At first, the press spoke to the disappointment of losing Fort Pulaski. Surprised by the effectiveness of large caliber Parrott Rifles in their first deployment, it was widely speculated that only betrayal could have brought overnight surrender to a [[Seacoast defense in the United States|Third System Fort]]. Lee was said to have failed to get effective support in the Savannah River from the three sidewheeler gunboats of the Georgia Navy. Although again blamed by the press for Confederate reverses, he was appointed military adviser to [[President of the Confederate States|Confederate President]] [[Jefferson Davis]], the former [[United States Secretary of War|U.S. Secretary of War]]. While in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], Lee was ridiculed as the 'King of Spades' for his excessive digging of trenches around the capitol. These trenches would later play a pivotal role in battles near the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;''Foot Soldier: The Rebels.'' Prod. A&amp;E Television Network. Karn, Richard. The History Channel. 1998. DVD. A&amp;E Television Networks, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commander, Army of Northern Virginia (June 1862 – June 1863)===
In the spring of 1862, in the [[Peninsula Campaign]], the Union [[Army of the Potomac]] under General [[George B. McClellan]] advanced on Richmond from [[Fort Monroe]] to the east. McClellan forced Gen. [[Joseph E. Johnston]] and the Army of Virginia to retreat to just north and east of the Confederate capital.

Then Johnston was wounded at the [[Battle of Seven Pines]], on June 1, 1862. Lee now got his first opportunity to lead an army in the field&amp;nbsp;– the force he renamed the [[Army of Northern Virginia|Army of ''Northern'' Virginia]], signalling his confidence that the Union army would be driven away from Richmond. Early in the war, Lee had been called "Granny Lee" for his allegedly timid style of command.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freeman|1934|p= 602}}&lt;/ref&gt; Confederate newspaper editorials objected to him replacing Johnston, opining that Lee would be passive, waiting for Union attack. And for the first three weeks of June, he did not attack, instead strengthening Richmond's defenses.

[[File:General R. E. Lee and Traveler.jpg|thumb|left|Lee mounted on [[Traveller (horse)|Traveller]] (September 1866)]]

But then he launched a series of bold attacks against McClellan's forces, the [[Seven Days Battles]]. Despite superior Union numbers, and some clumsy tactical performances by his subordinates, Lee's attacks derailed McClellan's plans and drove back part of his forces. Confederate casualties were heavy, but McClellan was unnerved, retreated {{convert|25|mi}} to the lower [[James River (Virginia)|James River]], and abandoned the Peninsula Campaign. This success completely changed Confederate morale, and the public's regard for Lee. After the Seven Days Battles, and until the end of the war, his men called him simply "Marse Robert", a term of respect and affection.

The setback, and the resulting drop in Union morale, impelled Lincoln to adopt a new policy of relentless, committed warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McPherson|2008|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McPherson|2008|pp=106–107}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Seven Days, Lincoln decided he would move to emancipate most Confederate slaves by executive order, as a military act, using his authority as commander-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McPherson|2008|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; But he needed a Union victory first.

Meanwhile, Lee defeated another Union army under Gen. [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]] at the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]]. In less than 90 days after taking command, Lee had run McClellan off the Peninsula, defeated Pope, and moved the battle lines from {{convert|6|mi}} outside Richmond, to {{convert|20|mi}} outside Washington.

Lee now invaded Maryland and Pennsylvania, hoping to collect supplies in Union territory, and possibly win a victory that would sway [[United States elections, 1862|the upcoming Union elections]] in favor of ending the war. But McClellan's men found a lost Confederate dispatch, [[Special Order 191]], that revealed Lee's plans and movements. McClellan always exaggerated Lee's numerical strength, but now he knew the Confederate army was divided and could be destroyed in detail. However, McClellan moved slowly, not realizing a spy had informed Lee that McClellan had the plans. Lee quickly concentrated his forces west of Antietam Creek, near Sharpsburg, Maryland, where McClellan attacked on September 17. The [[Battle of Antietam]] was the single bloodiest day of the war, with both sides suffering enormous losses. Lee's army barely withstood the Union assaults, then retreated to Virginia the next day. This narrow Confederate defeat gave President [[Abraham Lincoln]] the opportunity to issue his [[Emancipation Proclamation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McPherson|2008|p=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; which put the Confederacy on the diplomatic and moral defensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McPherson|2008|pp=104–105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disappointed by McClellan's failure to destroy Lee's army, Lincoln named [[Ambrose Burnside]] as commander of the Army of the Potomac. Burnside ordered an attack across the [[Rappahannock River]] at [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]]. Delays in bridging the river allowed Lee's army ample time to organize strong defenses, and [[Battle of Fredericksburg|the Union frontal assault]] on December 13, 1862 was a disaster. There were 12,600 Union casualties to 5,000 Confederate; one of the most one-sided battles in the Civil War.&lt;ref name="Fellman124-125"&gt;{{harvnb|Fellman|2000|pp=124–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this victory, Lee reportedly said "It is well that war is so terrible, else we should grow too fond of it."&lt;ref name="Fellman124-125" /&gt; At Fredericksburg, according to historian Michael Fellman, Lee had completely entered into the "spirit of war, where destructiveness took on its own beauty."&lt;ref name="Fellman124-125" /&gt;

After the bitter Union defeat at Fredericksburg, President Lincoln named [[Joseph Hooker]] commander of the Army of the Potomac. In May 1863, Hooker maneuvered to attack Lee's army via [[Chancellorsville, Virginia]]. But Hooker [[Battle of Chancellorsville|was defeated]] by Lee's daring maneuver: dividing his army and sending [[Stonewall Jackson]]'s corps to attack Hooker's flank. Lee won a decisive victory over a larger force, but with heavy casualties, including Jackson, his finest corps commander, who was accidentally killed by his own troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/surgeon-stonewall-jackson-death-likely-pneumonia-0|title=Surgeon: Stonewall Jackson death likely pneumonia|last=Zongker|first=Brett|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=June 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of Gettysburg===
The critical decisions came in May–June 1863, after Lee's smashing victory at the Battle of Chancellorsville. The western front was crumbling, as multiple uncoordinated Confederate armies were unable to handle General [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s campaign against Vicksburg. The top military advisers wanted to save Vicksburg, but Lee persuaded Davis to overrule them and authorize yet another invasion of the North. The immediate goal was to acquire urgently needed supplies from the rich farming districts of Pennsylvania; a long-term goal was to stimulate peace activity in the North by demonstrating the power of the South to invade. Lee's decision proved a significant strategic blunder and cost the Confederacy control of its western regions, and nearly cost Lee his own army as Union forces cut him off from the South.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen W. Sears, "'We Should Assume the Aggressive': Origins of the Gettysburg Campaign," ''North and South: The Official Magazine of the Civil War Society'', March 2002, Vol. 5#4 pp. 58–66; Donald Stoker, ''The Grand Design: Strategy and the U.S. Civil War'' (2010) p. 295 says that "attacking Grant would have been the wiser choice" for Lee.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thure de Thulstrup - L. Prang and Co. - Battle of Gettysburg - Restoration by Adam Cuerden.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.4|Battle of Gettysburg, by [[Thure de Thulstrup]]]]

In the summer of 1863, Lee invaded the North again, marching through western Maryland and into south central Pennsylvania. He encountered Union forces under [[George G. Meade]] at the three-day [[Battle of Gettysburg]] in Pennsylvania in July; the battle would produce the largest number of casualties in the American Civil War. With some of his subordinates being new and inexperienced in their commands, [[J.E.B. Stuart]]'s cavalry being out of the area, and Lee being slightly ill, he was less than comfortable with how events were unfolding. While the first day of battle was controlled by the Confederates, key terrain that should have been taken by [[Richard S. Ewell|General Ewell]] was not. The second day ended with the Confederates unable to break the Union position, and the Union being more solidified. Lee's decision on the third day, against the judgment of his best corps commander [[General Longstreet]], to launch a massive frontal assault on the center of the Union line turned out to be disastrous. The assault known as [[Pickett's Charge]] was repulsed and resulted in heavy Confederate losses. The general rode out to meet his retreating army and proclaimed, "All this has been my fault."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docsouth.unc.edu/imls/fremantle/fremantle.html#p135|last=Fremantle|first=Arthur James Lyon|title=Three Months in the Southern States|publisher=University of North Carolina|accessdate=October 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee was compelled to retreat. Despite flooded rivers that blocked his retreat, he escaped Meade's ineffective pursuit. Following his defeat at Gettysburg, Lee sent a letter of resignation to President Davis on August 8, 1863, but Davis refused Lee's request. That fall, Lee and Meade met again in two minor campaigns that did little to change the strategic standoff. The Confederate Army never fully recovered from the substantial losses incurred during the 3-day battle in southern Pennsylvania. The historian [[Shelby Foote]] stated, "Gettysburg was the price the South paid for having Robert E. Lee as commander."

===Ulysses S. Grant and the Union offensive===
In 1864 the new Union general-in-chief, Lt. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]], sought to use his large advantages in manpower and material resources to destroy Lee's army by [[attrition warfare|attrition]], pinning Lee against his capital of Richmond. Lee successfully stopped each attack, but Grant with his superior numbers kept pushing each time a bit farther to the southeast. These battles in the [[Overland Campaign]] included the [[Battle of the Wilderness|Wilderness]], [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House|Spotsylvania Court House]] and [[Battle of Cold Harbor|Cold Harbor]].

Grant eventually was able to stealthily move his army across the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]]. After stopping a Union attempt to capture [[Petersburg, Virginia]], a vital railroad link supplying Richmond, Lee's men built elaborate trenches and were besieged in Petersburg, a development which presaged the [[trench warfare]] of [[World War I]]. Lee attempted to break the stalemate by sending [[Jubal A. Early]] on a raid through the [[Shenandoah Valley]] to Washington, D.C., but Early was defeated early on by the superior forces of [[Philip Sheridan]]. The [[Siege of Petersburg]] lasted from June 1864 until March 1865, with Lee's outnumbered and poorly supplied army shrinking daily because of desertions by disheartened Confederates.

===General in Chief===

On February 6, 1865, Lee was appointed [[General in Chief of the Armies of the Confederate States]].

As the South ran out of manpower the issue of arming the slaves became paramount. Lee explained, "We should employ them without delay ... [along with] gradual and general emancipation." The first units were in training as the war ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nolan|1991|pp= 21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Davis61&gt;{{harvnb|Davis|1999|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Confederate army was devastated by casualties, disease and desertion, the Union attack on [[Petersburg, Virginia|Petersburg]] succeeded on April 2, 1865. Lee abandoned Richmond and retreated west. Lee then made an attempt to escape to the southwest and join up with Joseph E. Johnston's Army of Tennessee in North Carolina. However, his forces were soon surrounded and he surrendered them to Grant on April 9, 1865, at the [[Battle of Appomattox Court House]].&lt;ref name=Davis233&gt;{{harvnb|Davis|1999|p=233}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Confederate armies followed suit and the war ended. The day after his surrender, Lee issued his [[Lee's Farewell Address|Farewell Address]] to his army.

Lee resisted calls by some officers to reject surrender and allow small units to melt away into the mountains, setting up a lengthy guerrilla war. He insisted the war was over and energetically campaigned for inter-sectional reconciliation. "So far from engaging in a war to perpetuate slavery, I am rejoiced that slavery is abolished. I believe it will be greatly for the interests of the South."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nolan|1991|p= 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postbellum life==
[[File:Levin C. Handy - General Robert E. Lee in May 1869.jpg|thumb|left|Lee in 1869 (photo by [[Levin Corbin Handy|Levin C. Handy]])]]

After the war, Lee was not arrested or punished (although he was indicted{{hsp}}&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|1=hOTK_dvNzf8&amp;t=4m|2=The Lost Indictment of Robert E. Lee: The Forgotten Case against an American Icon}}, lecture given by historian John Reeves at the [[U.S. National Archives and Records Administration]] on June 13, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;), but he did lose the right to vote as well as some property. Lee’s prewar family home, the [[Arlington House, The Robert E. Lee Memorial|Custis-Lee Mansion]], was seized by Union forces during the war and turned into [[Arlington National Cemetery]], and his family was not compensated until more than a decade after his death.&lt;ref&gt;In December 1882, the U.S. Supreme Court returned the property to Lee’s son because it had been confiscated without due process of law. In 1883, the government paid the Lee family $150,000. {{cite web|accessdate=May 20, 2008|url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.mil/History/Facts/ArlingtonHouse.aspx|title=Arlington House, The Robert E. Lee Memorial|publisher=[[Arlington National Cemetery]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee somewhat supported President Johnson’s plan of [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} In 1866 Lee counseled southerners not to resume fighting, of which Grant said Lee was “setting an example of forced acquiescence so grudging and pernicious in its effects as to be hardly realized”.&lt;ref name=serwer&gt;{{cite news|last1=Serwer|first1=Adam|title=The Myth of the Kindly General Lee|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/06/the-myth-of-the-kindly-general-lee/529038/|accessdate=August 27, 2017|work=The Atlantic|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee joined with Democrats in opposing the Radical Republicans who demanded punitive measures against the South, distrusted its commitment to the abolition of slavery and, indeed, distrusted the region’s loyalty to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fellman|2000|pp=265–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1995|pp=380–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee supported a system of free public schools for blacks, but forthrightly opposed allowing blacks to vote. “My own opinion is that, at this time, they [black Southerners] cannot vote intelligently, and that giving them the [vote] would lead to a great deal of demagogism, and lead to embarrassments in various ways,” Lee stated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fellman|2000|p=268}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emory Thomas]] says Lee had become a suffering Christ-like icon for ex-Confederates. President Grant invited him to the White House in 1869, and he went. Nationally he became an icon of reconciliation between the North and South, and the reintegration of former Confederates into the national fabric.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1995|pp=391–92, 416}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Robert E Lee with his Generals, 1869.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|General Lee and his Confederate officers in their first meeting since Appomattox, August 1869. This is the only from life photograph of Lee with his Generals in existence, during the war or after.]]

Lee hoped to retire to a farm of his own, but he was too much a regional symbol to live in obscurity. From April to June 1865, he and his family resided in Richmond at the [[Stewart-Lee House]].&lt;ref name=VAnom&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Cities/Richmond/127-0064_Stewart-Lee_House_1972_Final_Nomination.pdf|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Stewart-Lee House|author=Virginia Historic Landmarks Commission Staff|date=October 1971|publisher=Virginia Department of Historic Resources|access-date=December 31, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927041441/http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Cities/Richmond/127-0064_Stewart-Lee_House_1972_Final_Nomination.pdf|archive-date=September 27, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He accepted an offer to serve as the president of Washington College (now [[Washington and Lee University]]) in [[Lexington, Virginia]], and served from October 1865 until his death. The Trustees used his famous name in large-scale fund-raising appeals and Lee transformed Washington College into a leading Southern college, expanding its offerings significantly, adding programs in commerce and journalism, and incorporating the [[Washington and Lee University School of Law|Lexington Law School]]. Lee was well liked by the students, which enabled him to announce an "[[honor system]]" like that of West Point, explaining that "we have but one rule here, and it is that every student be a [[Gentleman#Robert E. Lee|gentleman]]." To speed up national reconciliation Lee recruited students from the North and made certain they were well treated on campus and in town.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1995|pp=374–402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several glowing appraisals of Lee’s tenure as college president have survived, depicting the dignity and respect he commanded among all. Previously, most students had been obliged to occupy the campus dormitories, while only the most mature were allowed to live off-campus. Lee quickly reversed this rule, requiring most students to board off-campus, and allowing only the most mature to live in the dorms as a mark of privilege; the results of this policy were considered a success. A typical account by a professor there states that “the students fairly worshipped him, and deeply dreaded his displeasure; yet so kind, affable, and gentle was he toward them that all loved to approach him. ... No student would have dared to violate General Lee’s expressed wish or appeal; if he had done so, the students themselves would have driven him from the college.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Franklin Lafayette|last=Riley|title=General Robert E. Lee After Appomattox|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oydCAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA18|year=1922|publisher=Macmillan|pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While at Washington College, Lee told a colleague that the greatest mistake of his life was taking a military education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/transcript/lee-transcript/|title=Robert E.

===President Johnson’s amnesty pardons===
[[File:Robert E Lee's Amnesty Oath 1865.gif|thumb|Oath of [[amnesty]] submitted by Robert E. Lee in 1865]]

On May 29, 1865, President [[Andrew Johnson]] issued a Proclamation of [[Amnesty]] and [[Pardon]] to persons who had participated in the [[rebellion]] against the United States. There were fourteen excepted classes, though, and members of those classes had to make special application to the President. Lee sent an application to Grant and wrote to President Johnson on June 13, 1865:

{{Quote|Being excluded from the provisions of amnesty &amp; pardon contained in the proclamation of the 29th Ulto; I hereby apply for the benefits, &amp; full restoration of all rights &amp; privileges extended to those included in its terms. I graduated at the Mil. Academy at West Point in June 1829. Resigned from the U.S. Army April ’61. Was a General in the Confederate Army, &amp; included in the surrender of the Army of N. Virginia 9 April ’65.&lt;ref name="archives.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2005/spring/piece-lee.html |title=General Robert E. Lee's Parole and Citizenship |publisher=United States National Archives |date=August 5, 1975 |accessdate=October 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On October 2, 1865, the same day that Lee was inaugurated as president of [[Washington and Lee University|Washington College]] in [[Lexington, Virginia]], he signed his Amnesty Oath, thereby complying fully with the provision of Johnson’s proclamation. Lee was not pardoned, nor was his citizenship restored.&lt;ref name="archives.gov" /&gt;

Three years later, on December 25, 1868, Johnson proclaimed a second amnesty which removed previous exceptions, such as the one that affected Lee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=72360|title=Proclamation 179 – Granting Full Pardon and Amnesty for the Offense of Treason Against the United States During the Late Civil War|publisher=The American Presidency Project|accessdate=June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postwar politics===
Lee, who had opposed secession and remained mostly indifferent to politics before the Civil War, supported President [[Andrew Johnson]]’s plan of Presidential [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] that took effect in 1865–66. However, he opposed the Congressional Republican program that took effect in 1867. In February 1866, he was called to testify before the [[United States Congress Joint Committee on Reconstruction|Joint Congressional Committee on Reconstruction]] in Washington, where he expressed support for Johnson's plans for quick restoration of the former Confederate states, and argued that restoration should return, as far as possible, to the ''[[status quo ante bellum|status quo ante]]'' in the Southern states' governments (with the exception of slavery).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fellman|2000|p=265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Robert E Lee Edward Caledon Bruce 1865.jpeg|thumb|upright|left|''Robert E. Lee'', oil on canvas, Edward Calledon Bruce, 1865. [[Virginia Historical Society]]]]

Lee told the Committee, "...every one with whom I associate expresses kind feelings towards the freedmen. They wish to see them get on in the world, and particularly to take up some occupation for a living, and to turn their hands to some work." Lee also expressed his "willingness that blacks should be educated, and ... that it would be better for the blacks and for the whites." Lee forthrightly opposed allowing blacks to vote: "My own opinion is that, at this time, they [black Southerners] cannot vote intelligently, and that giving them the [vote] would lead to a great deal of demagogism, and lead to embarrassments in various ways."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fellman|2000|pp=267–268}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Robert_E_Lee_s_Testimony_before_Congress_February_17_1866 Robert E. Lee's Testimony before Congress (February 17, 1866)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview in May 1866, Lee said: "The Radical party are likely to do a great deal of harm, for we wish now for good feeling to grow up between North and South, and the President, Mr. Johnson, has been doing much to strengthen the feeling in favor of the Union among us. The relations between the Negroes and the whites were friendly formerly, and would remain so if legislation be not passed in favor of the blacks, in a way that will only do them harm."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freeman|1934|p=301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1868, Lee’s ally [[Alexander H. H. Stuart]] drafted a public letter of endorsement for the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party's]] [[United States presidential election, 1868|presidential campaign]], in which [[Horatio Seymour]] ran against Lee's old foe Republican [[Ulysses S. Grant]]. Lee signed it along with thirty-one other ex-Confederates. The Democratic campaign, eager to publicize the endorsement, published the statement widely in newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freeman|1934|pp= 375–377}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their letter claimed paternalistic concern for the welfare of freed Southern blacks, stating that “The idea that the Southern people are hostile to the negroes and would oppress them, if it were in their power to do so, is entirely unfounded. They have grown up in our midst, and we have been accustomed from childhood to look upon them with kindness.”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freeman|1934|pp= 375–376}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it also called for the restoration of white political rule, arguing that “It is true that the people of the South, in common with a large majority of the people of the North and West, are, for obvious reasons, inflexibly opposed to any system of laws that would place the political power of the country in the hands of the negro race. But this opposition springs from no feeling of enmity, but from a deep-seated conviction that, at present, the negroes have neither the intelligence nor the other qualifications which are necessary to make them safe depositories of political power.”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freeman|1934|p= 376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his public statements and private correspondence, Lee argued that a tone of reconciliation and patience would further the interests of white Southerners better than hotheaded antagonism to federal authority or the use of violence. Lee repeatedly expelled white students from Washington College for violent attacks on local black men, and publicly urged obedience to the authorities and respect for law and order.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fellman|2000|pp=258–263}}&lt;/ref&gt; He privately chastised fellow ex-Confederates such as [[Jefferson Davis]] and [[Jubal Early]] for their frequent, angry responses to perceived Northern insults, writing in private to them as he had written to a magazine editor in 1865, that “It should be the object of all to avoid controversy, to allay passion, give full scope to reason and to every kindly feeling. By doing this and encouraging our citizens to engage in the duties of life with all their heart and mind, with a determination not to be turned aside by thoughts of the past and fears of the future, our country will not only be restored in material prosperity, but will be advanced in science, in virtue and in religion.”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fellman|2000|pp=275–277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illness and death==
{{double image|right|Robert E Lee deathmask.jpg|110| RobertLeeMonument.jpg|235|Lee's [[death mask]]|"Recumbent Statue" of Robert E. Lee asleep on the battlefield, [[Lee Chapel]], [[Lexington, Virginia]].}}
On September 28, 1870, Lee suffered a stroke. He died two weeks later, shortly after 9 a.m. on October 12, 1870, in [[Lexington, Virginia]], from the effects of [[pneumonia]]. According to one account, his last words on the day of his death, were "Tell [[A. P. Hill|Hill]] he must come up. Strike the tent",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=J. William|title=Personal Reminiscences, Anecdotes, and Letters of Gen. Robert E. Lee|url=https://archive.org/stream/personalreminis00jonegoog#page/n522/mode/2up|publisher=D. Appleton and Company|location=New York|year=1875|page=451}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this is debatable because of conflicting accounts and because Lee's stroke had resulted in [[aphasia]], possibly rendering him unable to speak.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Southerland|first=Andrew|date=April 8, 2014|title=Robert E. Lee's Last Stand: His Dying Words and the Stroke That Killed Him.

At first no suitable coffin for the body could be located. The muddy roads were too flooded for anyone to get in or out of the town of Lexington. An undertaker had ordered three from Richmond that had reached Lexington, but due to unprecedented flooding from long-continued heavy rains, the caskets were washed down the [[Maury River]]. Two neighborhood boys, C.G. Chittum and Robert E. Hillis, found one of the coffins that had been swept ashore. Undamaged, it was used for the General's body, though it was a bit short for him. As a result, Lee was buried without shoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freeman|1934|p= 526}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried underneath [[Lee Chapel]] at [[Washington and Lee University]], where his body remains.

==Legacy==
Among the supporters of the Confederacy, Lee came to be even more revered after his surrender than he had been during the war, when [[Stonewall Jackson]] had been the great Confederate hero. In an address before the Southern Historical Society in [[Atlanta]], Georgia in 1874, [[Benjamin Harvey Hill]] described Lee in this way:

{{quote|He was a foe without hate; a friend without treachery; a soldier without cruelty; a victor without oppression, and a victim without murmuring. He was a public officer without vices; a private citizen without wrong; a neighbour without reproach; a Christian without hypocrisy, and a man without guile. He was a Caesar, without his ambition; Frederick, without his tyranny; Napoleon, without his selfishness, and Washington, without his reward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/73/820.html|title=Benjamin Harvey Hill quotation|publisher=bartleby.com|accessdate=June 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By the end of the 19th century, Lee's popularity had spread to the North.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=May 20, 2008|url=http://www.anb.org/articles/04/04-00622.html|author= Weigley, Russell F.|title=Lee, Robert E|publisher=[[American National Biography]]|date=February 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee's admirers have pointed to his character and devotion to duty, and his brilliant tactical successes in battle after battle against a stronger foe.

{{quote|According to my notion of military history there is as much instruction both in strategy and in tactics to be gleaned from General Lee's operations of 1862 as there is to be found in Napoleon's campaigns of 1796.|Field Marshal [[Garnet Wolseley, 1st Viscount Wolseley|Garnet Wolseley]]&lt;ref&gt;Some sources add "but little studied" before the word "operations".&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Military historians continue to pay attention to his battlefield tactics and maneuvering, though many think he should have designed better strategic plans for the Confederacy. He was not given full direction of the Southern war effort until late in the conflict.

Historian [[Eric Foner]] writes that at the end of his life,
: "Lee had become the embodiment of the Southern cause. A generation later, he was a national hero. The 1890s and early 20th century witnessed the consolidation of white supremacy in the post-Reconstruction South and widespread acceptance in the North of Southern racial attitudes."&lt;ref name="Foner"/&gt;

Robert E. Lee has been commemorated on U.S. postage stamps at least five times, the first one being a commemorative stamp that also honored [[Stonewall Jackson]], issued in 1936. A second "regular-issue" stamp was issued in 1955. He was commemorated with a 32-cent stamp issued in the American Civil War Issue of June 29, 1995. His horse Traveller is pictured in the background. An image of the stamp is available at Arago online at the link in the footnote.&lt;ref&gt;"32c Robert E.

Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia was commemorated on its 200th anniversary on November 23, 1948, with a 3-cent postage stamp. The central design is a view of the university, flanked by portraits of generals George Washington and Robert E. Lee.&lt;ref&gt;Rod, Steven J., "Landing of the Pilgrims Issue", Arago: people, postage &amp; the post, National Postal Museum. Viewed March 19, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Lee was again commemorated on a commemorative stamp in 1970, along with Jefferson Davis and Thomas J. "Stonewall" Jackson, depicted on horseback on the 6-cent Stone Mountain Memorial commemorative issue, modeled after the actual [[Stone Mountain Memorial]] carving in Georgia. The stamp was issued on September 19, 1970, in conjunction with the dedication of the Stone Mountain Confederate Memorial in Georgia on May 9, 1970. The design of the stamp replicates the memorial, the largest high relief sculpture in the world. It is carved on the side of Stone Mountain 400 feet above the ground.&lt;ref&gt;"Stone Mountain Memorial Issue", Arago: people, postage &amp; the post, National Postal Museum online, viewed March 16, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stone Mountain also led to Lee's appearance on a [[Early United States commemorative coins|commemorative coin]], the 1925 [[Stone Mountain Memorial half dollar]].  During the 1920s and '30s dozens of specially designed half dollars were struck to raise money for various events and causes.  This issue had a particularly wide distribution, with 1,314,709 minted.  Unlike some of the other issues it remains a very common coin.

&lt;!-- Is this really notable enough for this article? Items are bought and sold all the time. --&gt;
On September 29, 2007, General Lee's three Civil War-era letters were sold for $61,000 at auction by Thomas Willcox, much less than the record of $630,000 for a Lee item in 2002. The auction included more than 400 documents of Lee's from the estate of the parents of Willcox that had been in the family for generations. [[South Carolina]] sued to stop the sale on the grounds that the letters were official documents and therefore property of the state, but the court ruled in favor of Willcox.&lt;ref name="USA Today"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-09-29-letters_N.htm |title=General Lee letters sold at auction |newspaper=USA Today |date=September 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 30, 1975, Senate Joint Resolution 23, ''A joint resolution to restore posthumously full rights of citizenship to General R. E. Lee'' was introduced into the Senate by Senator [[Harry F. Byrd Jr.]] (I-VA), the result of a five-year campaign to accomplish this.

From its installation in 1884 until its removal in 2017, the most prominent monument in [[New Orleans]] was a {{convert|60|ft|m|0|adj=on}}-tall [[Robert E. Lee Monument (New Orleans, Louisiana)|monument to General Lee]]. A {{convert|16.5|ft|adj=on}} statue of Lee stood tall upon a towering column of white marble in the middle of [[Lee Circle]]. The statue of Lee, which weighs more than {{convert|7000|lb}} faced the north. Lee Circle is situated along New Orleans's famous [[St. Charles Avenue]]. The [[Streetcars in New Orleans|New Orleans streetcars]] roll past Lee Circle and New Orleans's best [[New Orleans Mardi Gras|Mardi Gras]] parades go around Lee Circle (the spot is so popular that bleachers are set up annually around the perimeter for Mardi Gras). Around the corner from Lee Circle is [[Confederate Memorial Hall|New Orleans's Confederate museum]], which contains the second-largest collection of Confederate memorabilia in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History of Confederate Memorial Hall |publisher=[[Confederate Memorial Hall]] |url=http://www.confederatemuseum.com |accessdate=May 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statue of General Lee was removed on May 19, 2017, the last of four Confederate monuments in New Orleans to be taken down.&lt;ref name="guardian-19may2017"&gt;{{cite news|title=New Orleans removes its final Confederate-era statue|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/19/new-orleans-robert-e-lee-statue-removed-confederacy|accessdate=May 22, 2017|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=The Guardian|date=May 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a tribute to Lee Circle (which had formerly been known as Tivoli Circle), former Confederate soldier [[George Washington Cable]] wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In Tivoli Circle, New Orleans, from the centre and apex of its green flowery mound, an immense column of pure white marble rises in the ... majesty of Grecian proportions high up above the city's house-tops into the dazzling sunshine ... On its dizzy top stands the bronze figure of one of the world's greatest captains. He is alone. Not one of his mighty lieutenants stand behind, beside or below him. His arms are folded on that breast that never knew fear, and his calm, dauntless gaze meets the morning sun as it rises, like the new prosperity of the land he loved and served so masterly, above the far distant battle fields where so many thousands of his gray veterans lie in the sleep of fallen heroes. (''Silent South'', 1885, The Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It overlooks the [[Potomac River]] and the [[National Mall]] in Washington, D.C. During the Civil War, the grounds of the mansion were selected as the site of [[Arlington National Cemetery]], in part to ensure that Lee would never again be able to return to his home. The United States designated the mansion as a [[National Memorial]] to Lee in 1955, a mark of widespread respect for him in both the [[Northern United States|North]] and [[Southern United States|South]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Arlington_House|title=Arlington House|website=Encyclopedia Virginia|accessdate=June 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1890 Lee statue unveiling.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Unveiling of the Equestrian Statue of Robert E. Lee, May 29, 1890, Richmond, Virginia]]

In Richmond, Virginia, a large equestrian statue of Lee by French sculptor [[Jean Antonin Mercié]] is the centerpiece of the city's famous [[Monument Avenue]], which boasts four other statues to famous Confederates. This monument to Lee was unveiled on May 29, 1890; over 100,000 people attended this dedication. That has been described as "the day white Virginia stopped admiring Gen. Robert E. Lee and started worshiping him".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Lee's portrayal on a mural on Richmond's Flood Wall on the [[James River]], considered offensive by some, was removed in the late 1990s, but currently is back on the flood wall.

Also in Virginia, the [[Robert Edward Lee (sculpture)]] at [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1997.&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a|dateform=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since there is no historical link between Lee and the city of Charlottesville, the City Council of Charlottesville voted in February 2017 to remove it, along with a statue of Stonewall Jackson, but this was temporarily stayed by court action. They did rename Lee Park, Emancipation Park. The prospect of the statues being removed and the parks being renamed brought many out-of-towners, described as [[white supremacist]] and [[alt-right]], to Charlottesville in the [[Unite the Right rally]] of August, 2017, in which 3 people died. For several months the monuments were shrouded in black. As of October, 2018, the fate of the statue of Lee is unresolved. The name of the park it is located in was changed again by the City Council, to Market Street Park, in July, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In [[Baltimore]]'s Wyman Park, a large double equestrian statue of Lee and Jackson is located directly across from the Baltimore Museum of Art. Designed by Laura Gardin Fraser and dedicated in 1948, Lee is depicted astride his horse Traveller next to Stonewall Jackson who is mounted on "Little Sorrel." Architect John Russell Pope created the base, which was dedicated on the anniversary of the eve of the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Outdoor Sculpture in Baltimore: A Historical Guide to Public Art in the Monumental City|last=Kelly|first=Cindy|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, MD|year=2011|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_sdQNyf4q-IC&amp;lpg=PA198&amp;dq=wyman%20park%20russell%20pope%20lee&amp;pg=PA198#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|pages=198–199|isbn=9780801897221}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Baltimore area of [[Maryland]] is also home to a large nature park called [[Robert E.

One United States college and one junior college are named for Lee: [[Washington and Lee University]] in Lexington, Virginia; and [[Lee College]] in Baytown, Texas, respectively. [[Lee Chapel]] at Washington and Lee University marks Lee's final resting place. Throughout the South, many primary and secondary schools were also named for him as well as private schools such as [[Robert E. Lee Academy]] in Bishopville, South Carolina.

In 1900, Lee was one of the first 29 individuals selected for the [[Hall of Fame for Great Americans]] (the first Hall of Fame in the United States), designed by [[Stanford White]], on the [[The Bronx|Bronx, New York]], campus of [[New York University]], now a part of [[Bronx Community College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=683|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Hall of Fame Complex|date=n.d.|accessdate=January 12, 2011|author=Joan R.

&lt;!-- EDITORS NOTE: Please do not add the position of "General in Chief of the Armies of the Confederate States" (to which Lee was appointed on February 6, 1865) as it would be historically inaccurate. Although "General in Chief..." was the highest command in the Army, he continued to hold the rank of "General" until April 12th, 1865. Thank you. --&gt;

==In popular culture==
Lee is a main character in the Shaara Family novels ''[[The Killer Angels]]'' (1974, ''Gettysburg''), ''[[Gods and Generals (novel)|Gods and Generals]]'' (1988), and ''[[The Last Full Measure (novel)|The Last Full Measure]]'' (2000), as well as the film adaptations of ''[[Gettysburg (1993 film)|Gettysburg]]'' (1993) and ''[[Gods and Generals (film)|Gods and Generals]]'' (2003). He is played by [[Martin Sheen]] in the former and by Lee's descendant [[Robert Duvall]] in the latter. Lee is portrayed as a hero in the historical children's novel ''[[Lee and Grant at Appomattox]]'' (1950) by [[MacKinlay Kantor]]. His part in the Civil War is told from the perspective of his horse in [[Richard Adams]]'s book ''[[Traveller (novel)|Traveller]]'' (1988).

Lee is an obvious subject for [[American Civil War alternate histories]]. [[Ward Moore]]'s ''[[Bring the Jubilee]]'' (1953), Kantor's ''[[If the South Had Won the Civil War]]'' (1960), and [[Harry Turtledove]]'s ''[[The Guns of the South]]'' (1992), all have Lee ending up as President of a victorious Confederacy and freeing the slaves (or laying the groundwork for the slaves to be freed in a later decade). Although ''Bring'' and ''If'' relegate him to a set of passing references, Lee is more of a main character in the ''Guns''. He is also the prime character of Turtledove's "Lee at the Alamo," which can be read on-line,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tor.com/2011/09/07/lee-at-the-alamo/|title=Lee at the Alamo|date=September 7, 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sees the opening of the Civil War drastically altered so as to affect Lee's personal priorities considerably. Turtledove's "[[War Between the Provinces]]" series is an allegory of the Civil War told in the language of fairy tales, with Lee appearing as a [[knight]] named "Duke Edward of Arlington." Lee is also a knight in "The Charge of Lee's Brigade" in ''Alternate Generals'' volume 1, written by Turtledove's friend [[S.M. Stirling]] and featuring Lee, whose [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]] is still a loyal [[British Empire|British]] colony, fighting for the [[Queen Victoria|Crown]] against the [[Russian Empire|Russians]] in [[Crimean War|Crimea]]. In Lee Allred's "East of Appomattox" in ''Alternate Generals'' volume 3, Lee is the Confederate Minister to [[London]] circa 1868, desperately seeking help for a CSA which has turned out poorly suited to independence.  [[Robert Skimin]]'s ''[[Grey Victory]]'' features Lee as a supporting character preparing to run for the presidency in 1867.

The [[Dodge Charger]] featured in the CBS television series ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard]]'' (1979–1985) was named [[General Lee (car)|The General Lee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title="Dukes of Hazzard's" General Lee Tops Edmunds' InsideLine.com's List of 100 Greatest Movie and TV Cars of All Time  | website=edmunds.com | url=http://www.edmunds.com/about/press/dukes-of-hazzards-general-lee-tops-edmunds-insidelinecoms-list-of-100-greatest-movie-and-tv-cars-of-all-time.html  | accessdate=June 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Dukes of Hazzard: Happy Birthday, General Lee  | website=allmovie | url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/the-dukes-of-hazzard-happy-birthday-general-lee-v392976  | accessdate=June 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[The Dukes of Hazzard (film)|the 2005 film based on this series]], the car is driven past a statue of the General, while the car's occupants salute him.

'''''Software Star''''' is a 1985 game released by [[Kevin Toms]] for the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore 64]] and [[ZX Spectrum]].

== Gameplay ==
Essentially a text-based management game.  The player's task is to manage a software house, create new games, manage his publicity and make a profit of £10000. Meanwhile, he must achieve the status of "Software Star" for ten successive months.

Having a large portfolio of games has its advantages by increasing the player's monthly sales. However, money must be spent on promoting aging titles. Each game has its own quality rating, where the quality increases with the amount of time spent on development. Managing the productivity of the player's staff is also key to the game, giving him a snapshot of the last six months. He could decide to either discipline offer incentives or take no action. There are four sales regions where the player's products are sold. These regions are ordered from one to four, depending on how much importance he gives to them by consulting the sales from the previous month. Public relations also needs tweaking by choosing Honesty or [[Media circus|Hype]].  Each decision has an effect on his company image. Finally, the player will have to evaluate his potential market depending on the time of year and decide how many advertising pages to buy. Markets are larger around [[Christmas]] and [[New Year]]. It is then time to sit back and look at the sales figures as the player's game enters the Top 20.  He is then given a sales break even figure and each game climbs the chart if it sells well to the Number One spot.

At the end of the month the player views your monthly statement to check his progress and Stardom rating ranging from Nobody to Software Star. At the end of the year, the directors will check the player's progress. They will either fire him, raise the bar, or give him another chance.

=== Objective ===
To become a software Star and to avoid [[bankruptcy]].

== Trivia ==
*The player can name the games that he is developing.
*This game has some similarities to the video game ''[[Millionaire (video game)|Millionaire]]''.
*A very similar game, ''Software House'' was released by [[Cult Games]] a few years later.

==Reception==
Zzap!64 thought the game was a disappointing follow-up to Football Manager, with too little to do for the player and less feeling of control.  It received a rating of 43%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zzap64.co.uk/cgi-bin/displaypage.pl?issue=001&amp;amp;page=043&amp;amp;thumbstart=0&amp;amp;magazine=zzap&amp;amp;check=1&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5514">In [[collective bargaining]], '''surface bargaining''' is a strategy in which one of the parties "merely goes through the motions," with no intention of reaching an agreement.{{sfn|Caisley|2007|page=170}}{{sfn|Carrell|Heavrin|2001|page=159}} In this regard, it is a form of [[bad faith]] bargaining.{{sfn|Caisley|2007|page=170}}

Distinguishing surface bargaining from [[good faith]] bargaining is extremely difficult.{{sfn|Emerson|2009|page=580}} The entire history of the negotiations must be assessed, including the party's intent, efforts made toward reaching an agreement, and any behavior which may be seen as inhibiting the bargaining process.{{sfn|Caisley|2007|page=171}}{{sfn|Morris|Hardin|LaVaute|O'Reilly|1992|pages=616-632}} Surface bargaining tactics may include making proposals the other party could never accept, taking inflexible or unreasonable stands on issues, and/or refusing to offer alternatives to proposals.{{sfn|Morris|Hardin|LaVaute|O'Reilly|1992|pages=616-632}}{{sfn|Holley|Jennings|Wolters|2009|page=272}} Reneging on agreements already reached during the collective bargaining process, raising new issues late in the negotiations, or failing to follow generally accepted procedures for collective bargaining may also be seen as signs of surface bargaining.{{sfn|Forsyth|Stewart|page=137}}

Based upon the "totality" of a party's actions during collective bargaining, surface bargaining may be found if there was a purposeful effort to avoid or frustrate mutual agreement.{{sfn|Morris|Hardin|LaVaute|O'Reilly|1992|pages=616-632}}  Under U.S. law, it is an [[Unfair labor practice]] and a breach of the duty to bargain in good faith.{{sfn|Morris|Hardin|LaVaute|O'Reilly|1992|pages=616-632}}
 
Surface bargaining is barred under the labor law of many countries. Federal and provincial Canadian labor law bars surface bargaining, and Canadian courts have held that the test for determining surface bargaining is to look at the totality of the negotiations.{{sfn|Willes|1990|page=70}} In New Zealand, surface bargaining is a violation of the [[Employment Relations Act 2000]] (as amended).{{sfn|Rudman|2009|page=102}} A "Code of Good Faith" promulgated by the Employment Relations Authority supplements the legal statute, however, and lays out a number of rules for good faith bargaining.{{sfn|Forsyth|Stewart|page=137}} In the United States, surface bargaining constitutes an [[unfair labor practice]] under the [[National Labor Relations Act]].{{sfn|Morris|Hardin|LaVaute|O'Reilly|1992|pages=616-632}}{{sfn|Voos|1994|page=12}} American courts have held that "hard bargaining" (taking a firmly held and well-explained position), failing to make a concession, and/or failing to reach an agreement do not constitute surface bargaining under federal labor law.{{sfn|Twomey|2010|page=168}} Additional evidence, such as away-from-the-table statements or behavior, is needed to prove surface bargaining in the U.S.{{sfn|Twomey|2010|page=168}}

'''Thomas S. Kaplan''' (born 1962) is an American [[billionaire]] businessman, investor, philanthropist and art collector. An admirer of [[Rembrandt]], Kaplan is known as the world's largest private collector of the [[Dutch master]]'s works.

Kaplan is the chairman and chief investment officer of The Electrum Group LLC, a New York City-based investment, advisory and asset management firm with a focus on the natural resources sector. Since 2017, he has been the chairman of the International Alliance for the Protection of Heritage in Conflict Areas (ALIPH), a Geneva-based foundation established by France and the United Arab Emirates.

==Early life and education==
Born in [[New York City]], Kaplan was raised in a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forbes.co.il/news/new.aspx?0r9VQ=IDMG Forbes Israel: Jewish Billionaires - Profile of Thomas Kaplan] April 14, 2013 (''in Hebrew'')&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Florida]], the son of Lillian Jean and Jason "Jay" Kaplan.

In his youth, he developed a passion for [[wildlife conservation]] and for [[Rembrandt]], which decades later inspired him, respectively, to found the felid conservation group [[Panthera Corporation|Panthera]],&lt;ref name="king"&gt;{{cite news |date=8 October 2013 |title=Tom Kaplan: Billionaire King Of Cats |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ashleaebeling/2013/10/08/tom-kaplan-billionaire-king-of-cats/ |newspaper=Forbes |location= |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to establish The Leiden Collection, the world's largest private grouping of works from the [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch Golden Age]].&lt;ref name="sotheby"/&gt; At [[Oxford University]], Kaplan earned bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in history.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.panthera.org/people/thomas-s-kaplan-phd |title=Thomas S. Kaplan |date= |website= |publisher=Panthera |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote his doctoral dissertation on the Malayan counterinsurgency and the manner in which commodities influence strategic planning.&lt;ref name="Evangelist"&gt;{{cite news |title=Gold's Evangelist |author= |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/10_36/b4193058839907.htm |newspaper=Bloomberg Businessweek |date=26 August 2010 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While earning his PhD, he worked as an analyst covering Israeli companies  publicly traded in the US.&lt;ref name="Evangelist"/&gt; On a business trip, he met his future wife, Dafna  Recanati (the daughter of Israeli investor [[Leon Recanati]]), who had attended the same boarding school as Kaplan.&lt;ref name="Evangelist"/&gt; Dafna's mother, artist Mira Recanati, introduced him to Israeli investor Avi Tiomkin, who hired him as a junior partner in 1991. Kaplan had impressed Tiomkin by correctly predicting [[Saddam Hussein]]'s 1990 [[invasion of Kuwait]] several years before it took place.&lt;ref name="Evangelist"/&gt; When Tiomkin decided to concentrate his investments solely in Israel in 1993, Kaplan moved on to pursue his own entrepreneurial ventures.&lt;ref name="Evangelist"/&gt;

==Career==
Inspired by [[Marc Faber]], who held that precious metals were insurance against the "monetary foolishness" of central governments, Kaplan focused on natural resources investing.&lt;ref name="Evangelist"/&gt; In 1993, he founded [[Apex Silver Mines]] to capitalize on the improving supply/demand fundamentals of metals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Is silver the glitter of yesterday? Or is it the new ingredient of the reasonably prudent portfolio? |author= |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/19/business/markets-market-place-silver-glitter-yesterday-it-new-ingredient-reasonably.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=19 February 1998 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he was chairman and chief executive officer of Apex, his team discovered and financed the San Cristobal deposit in Bolivia, now one of the largest producers of silver and zinc in the world.&lt;ref name="silverstrike"&gt;{{cite news |title=Silver Strike! |author= |url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2000/0807/6604064a.html |newspaper=[[Forbes]] |date=8 July 2000 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=April 2010 |title=The contributions of San Cristobal Mine |url=http://www.sumitomocorp.co.jp/english/business/article/id=232 |agency=Sumitomo Corporation }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaplan retired from Apex Silver at the end of 2004 to focus on his new exploration projects.&lt;ref name="Evangelist"/&gt;

In 2003, a company related to Kaplan became the largest investor in African Platinum Plc (then known as Southern African Resources Plc), enabling it to explore and develop one of the largest platinum group metals projects in South Africa. In 2007, Kaplan sold his position in African Platinum as part of a transaction in which the company was acquired by Impala Platinum Limited, at a valuation of $580 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.investegate.co.uk/article.aspx?id=200309120710516940P |title=Southern African Resources Raises £400,000 Through Private Placing |author= |date=12 September 2003 |website= |publisher=St Brides Media &amp; Finance Ltd |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2003, Kaplan founded [[Leor Energy|Leor Exploration &amp; Production LLC]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanvardi/2012/06/28/the-tragedy-of-guma-aguiar-and-a-2-billion-texas-gas-fortune/#4c7e7fbb23ef|title=The Tragedy Of Guma Aguiar And A $2 Billion Texas Gas Fortune|date=28 June 2012|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which became the fastest-growing privately held [[hydrocarbon exploration]] and production company in the United States. In 2007, Leor’s [[natural gas]] assets were sold to [[EnCana Oil &amp; Gas (USA) Inc.]] for $2.55 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=24 March 2010 |title=Why are Big Hedge Funds Investing with Tom Kaplan? |url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2010/0412/outfront-gold-kaplan-novagold-soros-paulson-golden-boy.html |newspaper=Forbes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=5 November 2007 |title=EnCana to acquire partner Leor Energy's interests in highly prolific Deep Bossier gas fields of East Texas for US$2.55 billion |url=https://www.encana.com/news-stories/news-releases/details.html?release=609913 |agency=Encana Corporation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaplan first began investing heavily in gold in 2000. Since the sales of African Platinum and Leor in 2007, Kaplan has focused on the Electrum Group. Its exploration arm, Electrum Ltd., which he co-founded with Dr. Larry Buchanan, owns a diversified international portfolio of gold exploration assets. Its other entities hold significant interests in several publicly traded companies, including NovaGold Resources Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/novagold-announces-us60-million-financing-with-electrum-strategic-resources-tsx-ng-934256.htm |title=NovaGold Announces US$60 Million Financing with Electrum Strategic Resources |author= |date=2 January 2009 |website= |publisher=Marketwired |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=25 March 2010 |title=This Guy Is The Reason Paulson And Soros Invested In NovaGold |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/this-guy-is-the-reason-paulson-and-soros-invested-in-novagold-2010-3?IR=T |newspaper=Business Insider }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Gabriel Resources Ltd.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gabriel gets help from Wall Street investor |author= |url=http://m.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/gabriel-gets-help-from-wall-street-investor/article39207/?service=mobile |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |date=28 August 2011 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; two companies that own several of the largest proven gold resources in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date= |title=Donlin Gold |url=http://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/ |agency=NovaGold }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date= |title=Projects |url=http://www.gabrielresources.com/site/projects.aspx |agency=Gabriel Resources }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among its private interests, the Electrum Group is the controlling shareholder of Sunshine Silver Mining &amp; Refining Corporation, which owns the [[Sunshine Mine (Idaho)|Sunshine Mine]] in Idaho, the most prolific silver mine in US history,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=12 May 2010 |title=Silver Opportunity Partners LLC Concludes Acquisition of the Assets of Sterling Mining Company |url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20100512006533/en/Silver-Opportunity-Partners-LLC-Concludes-Acquisition-Assets#.VTllZpNt7Ms |agency=Business Wire }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the Los Gatos silver-zinc deposit in Mexico, which it is developing in partnership with Dowa of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=8 June 2016 |title=DOWA acquires a 30% Interest in Los Gatos Project in Mexico |url=http://www.dowa.co.jp/en/ir/news/2016/20160608.html |agency=Dowa Holdings }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a leading investor in gold, Kaplan is credited with correctly predicting that gold prices would increase. His investment strategy and commitment to gold led ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]'' to refer to him as "Gold's Evangelist."&lt;ref name="Evangelist"/&gt;

==Leiden Collection==
[[File:Leiden Collection.1.JPG|thumb|150px|Rembrandt's ''Smell'' in Kaplan's "Leiden Collection"]] 
Kaplan's passion for the Dutch masters began in his early childhood.&lt;ref name="sotheby"&gt;{{cite news |date=28 April 2017 |title=The Leiden Collection of Dutch Golden Age Paintings |url=http://www.sothebys.com/en/news-video/blogs/all-blogs/sotheby-s-magazine--may-2017/2017/04/leiden-collection-dutch-golden-age-paintings-thomas-kaplan.html |newspaper=Sotheby's Magazine }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaplan and his wife, Dafna Recanati Kaplan, began to collect the art of the Dutch Golden Age in 2003. Their Leiden Collection is now among the largest private assemblages of Dutch art in the world, and numbers more than 250 paintings and drawings, most of which are included in a free, high-resolution online catalogue.&lt;ref name="wsj-leiden"&gt;{{cite news |date=17 March 2017 |title=Collectors Lend Out Their Hoard |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/collectors-lend-out-their-hoard-1489775819 |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=30 December 2016 |title=US collectors send Dutch Old Masters on world tour |url=http://theartnewspaper.com/news/news/us-collectors-send-dutch-old-masters-on-world-tour-/ |newspaper=The Art Newspaper }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kaplans' intention was to establish a "lending library for old masters", including loans for special exhibitions as well as loans to bolster long-term installations.&lt;ref name="nyt-leiden"&gt;{{cite news |date=8 May 2017 |title=Billionaire's Spending Spree Creates 'Lending Library for Old Masters' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/08/arts/thomas-kaplan-leiden-collection-old-masters.html?_r=0 |newspaper=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Collection focuses on Rembrandt and his School, illuminating the personalities and themes that shaped the Golden Age over five generations. How the Collection developed is explained in Kaplan's personal account of the journey: "A Portrait in Oil".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date= |title=A Portrait in Oil |url= |agency=The Leiden Collection }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the core of the Collection is a group of fourteen paintings and two drawings by Rembrandt himself, and key members of his circle including his teacher, [[Pieter Lastman]], and studio-mate [[Jan Lievens]].&lt;ref name="about-leiden"&gt;{{cite news |date= |title=About The Leiden Collection |url=https://www.theleidencollection.com/about/ |agency=The Leiden Collection }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2017/01/11/het-voelde-alsof-rembrandt-tot-me-sprak-6159077-a1540667 Arjan Ribbens, ''Honderden Hollandse meesters in handen van deze Amerikaanse miljardair''], [[NRC Handelsblad]], 11 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; It includes arounds 250 paintings and drawings, mainly by 17th-century artists based in [[Leiden]]. This includes thirteen paintings from all phases of the career of [[Gerard Dou]], as well as ''[[A Young Woman Seated at the Virginals]]'' (1670–1672) by [[Johannes Vermeer]] and ''Hagar and the Angel'' by [[Carel Fabritius]].

===''The Five Senses'' by Rembrandt van Rijn===
At a 2015 auction in [[Bloomfield, New Jersey]] a European bidder bought ''The Fainting Patient'' or ''Smell'' for $870,000, though its pre-auction estimate had only been $800. This was identified as an early work by [[Rembrandt]], dating to 1624 and belonging to his ''[[The Senses (Rembrandt)|The Five Senses]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;Ilona van Tuinen, 'A newly discovered painting by Rembrandt van Rijn: The unconscious patient (smell)', in: ''Jordaens.

==History==
The University of Maryland at Baltimore was founded in 1807 as the Maryland College of Medicine. In 1812, it was rechartered as the University of Maryland and given the authority to establish additional faculties in law, divinity, and arts and sciences. The faculty of law was founded in 1816, though it operated intermittently until 1868. The faculty of arts and sciences known as the [[Baltimore College]] for undergraduates also operated intermittently in the early 19th century. From 1907 to 1920, [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]] functioned as the University of Maryland's faculty of arts and sciences; this loose federation was dissolved in 1920 when the [[University of Maryland, College Park|Maryland State College]], (the former [[Maryland Agricultural College]]), founded 1856, as the state's [[land grant college]], became part of a larger University of Maryland with the graduate level professional schools on the westside of downtown Baltimore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cordell|first1=Eugene Fauntleroy|title=Historical Sketch of the University of Maryland, School of Medicine (1807-1890)|date=1891|publisher=I.

* [[University of Maryland at Baltimore]] (UMAB), (professional graduate level schools);
* [[University of Maryland Baltimore County]] (UMBC), (between [[Arbutus, Maryland|Arbutus]] and [[Catonsville, Maryland|Catonsville]] in southwest [[Baltimore County]]);
* [[University of Maryland, College Park]] (UMCP), flagship campus; 
* [[University of Maryland Eastern Shore]] (UMES),  (at [[Princess Anne, Maryland|Princess Anne]] in [[Somerset County, Maryland|Somerset County]]); and the 
* [[University of Maryland University College]] (UMUC), (extension and foreign programs)

with a system-wide president located in College Park and a chancellor in charge of each campus; in 1988 this institution was merged with the State University and College System of Maryland (of former [[normal school|normal]] and state teachers colleges, now wider liberal arts schools since the 1960s)  to form the new [[University System of Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usmd.edu/usm/overview/Timeline.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150421041300/https://www.usmd.edu/usm/overview/Timeline.html|archivedate=April 21, 2015|accessdate=July 14, 2018|title=USM Timeline|publisher=University System of Maryland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional schools==

===University of Maryland School of Dentistry===
{{main|University of Maryland School of Dentistry}}
The University of Maryland School of Dentistry was the first dental school in the world.&lt;ref name="justfacts" /&gt; Founded in 1840 as the [[Baltimore College of Dental Surgery]] (BCDS), it was chartered by an act of the Maryland General Assembly. Its principal founders were Drs. [[Horace H. Hayden]] and Chapin A. Harris.  It was the first school in the world to offer a science-based curriculum in dentistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dental.umaryland.edu/aboutBCDS/ |title=UMB Dental School About Us |publisher=Dental.umaryland.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It currently ranks among top 10 in the nation to receive NIH research funding. The school moved to a new building in October 2006. The new building, located adjacent to the old one in Baltimore Street, offers some of the newest facilities and technologies in the world for education and patient care. The cost of construction and equipment was over $140 million USD, the highest spent by the state of Maryland on an academic building.

===University of Maryland School of Law===

It is the only law school in the [[United States]] with a famous author buried on its campus. The former restored church building, now known as Westminster Hall is used for campus events and lectures and is often requested for wedding and other social ceremonies.

The University of Maryland School of Law was ranked 48th among law schools according to the 2017 edition of ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' law school rankings and was also ranked among the top 10 programs for health law, clinical law and environmental law. The School of Law's students' undergraduate median [[GPA]] is a 3.47 and median [[Law School Admissions Test]] (LSAT) score is a 158. It admits 52.4% of applicants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://officialguide.lsac.org//SearchResults/SchoolPage_PDFs/ABA_LawSchoolData/ABA5814.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927210854/http://officialguide.lsac.org//SearchResults/SchoolPage_PDFs/ABA_LawSchoolData/ABA5814.pdf|publisher=Law School Admission Council, Inc.|archivedate=September 27, 2007|title=Official ABA Data: University of Maryland School of Law|website=LSAC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law school takes about 225 full-time day students and about 50 evening students per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.umaryland.edu/about/facts.html |title=Facts about UM Carey Law|website=UM Carey Law|accessdate=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2011 article in ''Forbes'' magazine, [[Steven Salzberg]] criticized the school's inclusion of [[pseudoscientific]] subjects such as [[homeopathy]] in the curriculum. According to Salzberg, the school is "mis-training medical students" by teaching courses in [[integrative medicine]].&lt;ref name=Salzberg&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/sciencebiz/2011/04/21/bad-medicine-at-the-university-of-maryland/ |title=Why Medical Schools Should Not Teach Integrative Medicine |work=Forbes |accessdate=18 January 2017 |author=Salzberg, Steven|date=21 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|University of Maryland Graduate School, Baltimore}}

The UMB Graduate School was founded in 1918. It offers 43 degree programs in total and oversees the partnership between UMB and the [[University of Maryland, Baltimore County]] (UMBC) with additional programs that span across both institutions.

==Library facilities==
The University of Maryland, Baltimore has two main libraries on its campus: the Health Sciences &amp; Human Services Library (HS/HSL) and the Thurgood Marshall Law Library.

UMB's '''Health Sciences &amp; Human Services Library (HS/HSL)''' was founded in 1813 from the collection of Doctor John Crawford, a former British naval surgeon. Dr. Crawford's initial donation of books remains within the library's Historical Collections department as the Crawford Collection (comprising some 569 items).  The first location of the library was the Provost's Office within the original medical school building, now known as [[Davidge Hall]]. Under the leadership of its first official library, Dr. Eugene F. Cordell (who served as library director from 1903-1913), the library grew rapidly, incorporating book collections from the schools of pharmacy and dentistry, and moving into its own building, a former church on the southeast corner of Lombard and Green Streets. The church was later razed in 1957 to make way for a new library that began construction in 1958 and opened in 1960. The library has since moved, in 1998, into a large modern building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hshsl.umaryland.edu/about/history.cfm |title=HS/HSL - History of the HS/HSL |publisher=Hshsl.umaryland.edu |accessdate=2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The HS/HSL offers 45 group study rooms, 3 computer classrooms, several conference rooms with the web conferencing capability, and the Presentation Practice Studio, in addition to many study carrels and a number of public computers in a five-story building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hshsl.umaryland.edu/services/reservearoom.cfm |title=HS/HSL - Reservations |publisher=Hshsl.umaryland.edu |accessdate=2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March, 2015, it opened the new Innovation Space designed for innovative and collaborative hands-on learning experience with 3D printers and 3D scanners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hshsl.umaryland.edu/services/ispace/|title=HS/HSL - Innovation Space |publisher=Hshsl.umaryland.edu |accessdate=2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Thurgood Marshall Law Library''', named for Baltimore native and Supreme Court Justice [[Thurgood Marshall]], is the law library for the [[University of Maryland School of Law]]. The Marshall Law Library is found inside the law school's building, accessible through the main entrance. The Thurgood Marshall Law Library contains over 400,000 volumes of Anglo-American legal materials as well as outstanding international and foreign law collections. Extensive collections of both primary sources and secondary materials such as treatises are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.umaryland.edu/marshall/aboutlibrary/collections.html |title=TMLL &amp;#124; Collections |publisher=Law.umaryland.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The library is open to all faculty, staff and students on the campuses of the University System of Maryland; University of Maryland School of Law alumni; attorneys; and members of the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.umaryland.edu/marshall/aboutlibrary/hours.html |title=TMLL &amp;#124; Library Hours |publisher=Law.umaryland.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name of the institution==
The professional schools housed at the University of Maryland, Baltimore, may also simply use the name "University of Maryland" when describing themselves even though the [[University of Maryland, College Park]], also refers to itself simply as the University of Maryland. There is relatively little confusion resulting from the shared name because the University of Maryland, College Park, offers largely research-oriented graduate programs and houses fewer professional schools. The University of Maryland, Baltimore, does not offer [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] sports. Although this university mainly offers graduate and professional study, it also offers a few undergraduate courses, which include nursing, [[dental hygienist|dental hygiene]] and medical technology. By law and tradition each school is entitled to use the "University of Maryland" name in recognition of their shared history.  While both schools are institutions which belong to the University System of Maryland, neither is a part of the other.

The University of Maryland, Baltimore, is also often mistaken for the [[University of Maryland, Baltimore County]] (UMBC), which is a separate University System of Maryland institution located in the town of [[Catonsville, Maryland|Catonsville]], outside the City of Baltimore.

==Campus==

The campus is composed of 58 buildings located near [[Camden Yards]] and Baltimore's famous [[Lexington Market]]. Construction on a new {{convert|114000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} campus center began at the start of 2007 and opened in August 2009 as the [[Southern Management Corporation]] Campus Center (SMC Center).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umaryland.edu/smccampuscenter/index.html |title=SMC Campus Center Home |publisher=Umaryland.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SMC Center contains dining facilities, meeting locations and the campus's gymnasium and recreation facility, URecFit. UMB has also recently undertaken a vast west campus expansion. This {{convert|10|acre|m2|adj=on}} project, known as BioPark, will create ten new buildings containing a total of {{convert|1200000|sqft|m2}} of classroom, lab, and office space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umbiopark.com/ |title=University of Maryland BioPark |publisher=Umbiopark.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, University of Maryland Medical System has cleared a downtown site for the construction of a $329 million ambulatory care center.

The university is served by the University Center/Baltimore Street station of the [[Baltimore Light Rail]] system, which is at the eastern edge of campus. The Orange Route of the free Charm City Circulator provides service to both the BioPark and through the UMB campus to the Inner Harbor and points east.

Starting with the 2012-2013 school year, the University launched a new shuttle bus service for university students, staff, and faculty and University of Maryland Medical Center employees free of charge. The shuttle runs 3 routes from the university to West Baltimore (the new BioPark center), Federal Hill, and Mount Vernon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.umaryland.edu/shuttlebus/index.html |title=UM shuttle |publisher=Umaryland.edu |date=2013-05-30 |accessdate=2013-07-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115193619/http://www.umaryland.edu/shuttlebus/index.html |archive-date=2013-01-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus police==
The university is protected through the University of Maryland, Baltimore Police Department. The UMB Police department is a state- and nationally accredited police agency providing law enforcement services to the UMB campus and surrounding communities.&lt;ref name=police&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umaryland.edu/police/ |title=University of Maryland Baltimore Police Force |publisher=Umaryland.edu |date=2013-06-11 |accessdate=2013-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through an agreement signed between the UMB Police Department and the [[Baltimore Police Department]], UMB Police officers have the same jurisdiction and authority as Baltimore Police officers throughout the campus of the university.&lt;ref name=police/&gt; The UMB police force is composed of both sworn officers and unarmed security guards who are located in university-owned buildings to control access to the buildings and for other security purposes.&lt;ref name=police/&gt; The UMB Police force also provides escort services to students and university personnel throughout the campus, either through an escort vehicle, or a walking escort by an officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umaryland.edu/police/services.html |title=Services |publisher=Umaryland.edu |date=2013-06-11 |accessdate=2013-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2192">'''Venture management''' is a [[business management]] discipline that focuses on being both innovative and challenging in the realm of introducing what could be a completely new product or entering a promising newly emerging market.&lt;ref name="VentureSkiesDawnWhatIsVM"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Dawn M.|title=What is Venture Management?|url=http://www.ventureskies.com/blog/what-is-venture-management|website=www.VentureSkies.com|publisher=VentureSkies|accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discipline is focused on the skills, practices and technology required to manage the rapid growth of new business in highly dynamic environments.&lt;ref name="ScholtenComparinVSandTradVM"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scholten|first1=Ulrich|title=Comparing Venture Management and Traditional Management Methods|url=http://www.ventureskies.com/blog/comparing-venture-management-and-traditional-management-methods|publisher=VentureSkies|accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These environments are often characterized by rapid technology change.

Reacting on more volatile and basically unknown or immature markets, Venture management is by design opportunity driven and reactive on generated [[business intelligence|market data]] and [[consumer behaviour]]. In contrast to [[business plan]]-driven traditional management concepts, venture marketing is iterative and experimental, operating on short recurring cycles of implementation and adaptation.&lt;ref name="ScholtenComparinVSandTradVM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="1000Ventures"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kotelnikov|first1=Vadim|title=Venture Management vs Traditional Corporate Management|url=http://www.1000ventures.com/business_guide/mgmt_corporate_v_venture.html|publisher=Business Coach}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Venture management techniques apply equally well to [[venture capital]]-funded firms, self-financed firms, and [[business entities]] that are managed with a large degree of independence within a large established firm.
