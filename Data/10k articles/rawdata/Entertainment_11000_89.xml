'''ABS-CBN Corporation''', commonly known as '''ABS-CBN''', is a Filipino media and entertainment group based in [[Quezon City]]. It is the Philippines' largest entertainment and [[media conglomerate]] in terms of revenue, operating income, net income, assets, equity, market capitalization, and number of employees.&lt;ref name="gonzales1999"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gonzales&lt;!--couldn't clearly map to David Gonzales (journalist)--&gt;|first=David|date=July 17, 1999|title=Philippines Indie VIVA Music Group|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kAgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=abs-cbn+corporation+media+conglomerate#v=onepage&amp;q=abs-cbn%20corporation%20media%20conglomerate&amp;f=false|department=International &gt; newsline...|journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|volume=|pages=65|accessdate=2018-04-11|quote=...changes at Star, a subsidiary of ABS-CBN Broadcasting, the country's largest media conglomerate.|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-L4PBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT301&amp;vq=%22ABS-CBN%22&amp;dq=abs-cbn%20corporation%20media%20conglomerate&amp;pg=PT301#v=snippet&amp;q=%22ABS-CBN%22&amp;f=false|title=America's Boy: The Marcoses and the Philippines|last=Hamilton-Paterson|first=James|publisher=[[Faber &amp; Faber]]|year=2014|isbn=9780571320196|location=London|page=&lt;!--unknown--&gt;|pages=|type=Snippet view|oclc=922406663|quote=In June 1972, Eugenio Lopez, Sr. ... stood at the apex of Philippine public and social life.

ABS was founded in 1946 by American electronics engineer [[James Lindenberg]] as Bolinao Electronics Corporation (BEC). In 1952, BEC was renamed Alto Broadcasting System (ABS), after [[Antonio Quirino|Judge Antonio Quirino]], brother of [[Elpidio Quirino|President Elpidio Quirino]], purchased the company. The company that would later be merged with ABS was founded in 1956 as Chronicle Broadcasting Network (CBN) by newspaper mogul [[Eugenio Lopez, Sr.]] and his brother [[Fernando Lopez]] (then Vice President of the Philippines). The two companies were merged and incorporated as ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation on 1 February 1967, and renamed ABS-CBN Corporation in 2010 to reflect the company's diversification. The common shares of ABS-CBN were first traded on the [[Philippine Stock Exchange]] in July 1992 under the ticker symbol ABS.&lt;ref name="ir.abs-cbn.com"&gt;{{Citation|title=Shareholders FAQS|date=&lt;!--page has a 2008 copyright date--&gt;|url=http://ir.abs-cbn.com/ir/shareholderfaqs.aspx|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308181935/http://ir.abs-cbn.com/ir/shareholderfaqs.aspx|work=Investor relations|at=ABS-CBN Stock Information &gt; When was the initial public offering?|publisher=ABS-CBN|accessdate=March 27, 2012|archivedate=March 8, 2012}}{{Self-published source|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edge.pse.com.ph/companyPage/stockData.do?cmpy_id=114|title=ABS-CBN Corporation stock data|last=&lt;!--no byline--&gt;|first=|date=April 13, 2018|website=PSE EDGE portal|publisher=[[Philippine Stock Exchange]]|at=Stock Data &gt; Listing Date|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group owns and operates the [[ABS-CBN (TV network)|ABS-CBN]] and [[ABS-CBN Sports and Action|ABS-CBN Sports+Action]] national television networks as well as the [[Radyo Patrol]] and [[My Only Radio]] regional radio networks. The ABS-CBN television network, in particular, is the largest contributor to the group's revenue, generating about 50 to 60 percent of the group's total annual revenue mainly from selling airtime to advertisers. The remaining revenue is generated from consumer sales, mainly from ABS-CBN Global Ltd. which distributes international television channels such as [[The Filipino Channel]] and [[Myx TV]] and from pay TV and broadband internet provider [[Sky (cable company)|Sky]]. Other companies under the ABS-CBN group are motion picture company [[Star Cinema]], music recording label [[Star Music]], publishing firm [[ABS-CBN Publishing]], pay TV content provider and distributor [[Creative Programs]], and talent agency [[Star Magic]]. Among the pay TV networks and channels under the ABS-CBN group are [[ABS-CBN HD]], [[ABS-CBN News Channel]], [[ABS-CBN Sports and Action|ABS-CBN Sports+Action HD]], [[Cinema One]], [[Jeepney TV]], [[Metro Channel]], [[Liga (TV channel)|Liga]], and [[Myx]]. In recent years, ABS-CBN has ventured and diversified in other businesses such as cellular telephony provider [[ABS-CBN Mobile]], video on demand platform [[IWant TV|I Want TV]], digital terrestrial television service [[ABS-CBN TV Plus]], family entertainment center [[Kidzania Manila]], and home shopping network [[O Shopping]]. ABS-CBN is also the principal owner of [[ABS-CBN Philharmonic Orchestra]].

==History==

===Beginnings===
[[File:ABS building.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The ABS building in [[Roxas Boulevard|Dewey Boulevard]], [[Pasay City]], the original headquarters of Alto Broadcasting System.]]
The nucleus of ABS-CBN Corporation began in 1946 with Bolinao Electronics Corporation (BEC). BEC was established by James Lindenberg, one of the founding fathers of Philippine television,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbn.com/headlines/Article/3285/Farewell-to-the-Father-of-Philippine-Television.aspx|title=Farewell to the Father of Philippine Television|last=&lt;!--no byline--&gt;|date=April 30, 2009|publisher=ABS-CBN|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107101034/http://www.abs-cbn.com/headlines/Article/3285/Farewell-to-the-Father-of-Philippine-Television.aspx|archive-date=November 7, 2011|dead-url=|accessdate=May 8, 2011}}{{self-published source|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; an American electronics engineer who went into radio equipment assembly and radio broadcasting. At that time, the largest media company was [[Manila Broadcasting Company|Manila Broadcasting]], with [[DZRH]] as the leading radio station. In 1949, James Lindenberg shifted Bolinao to radio broadcasting with DZBC and masterminded [[Timeline of the introduction of television in countries|the introduction of television to the country in 1953]].&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|last=Anastacio|first=Ellen Joy|last2=Badiola|first2=Janine Natalie|title=The History of Philippine Television|url=http://pinoytv.blogspot.com/|publisher=''[[University of the Philippines|UP-CMC Broadcast Department]]''|date=January 1, 2010|accessdate=March 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, Lindenberg partnered with Antonio Quirino, brother of then Philippine President Elpidio Quirino, in order to try their hand at television broadcasting. In 1952, BEC was renamed as Alto Broadcasting System or ABS (with Alto Sales Corporation as its corporate name). "Alto" was a contraction of Quirino’s and his wife’s first names, Tony and Aleli. Though they had little money and resources, ABS was able to put up its TV tower by July 1953 and import some 300 television sets. The initial test broadcasts began on September of the same year. The very first full-blown broadcast, however, was on 23 October 1953, of a party in Tony Quirino's humble abode. The television station was known as [[DWWX-TV|DZAQ-TV]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

===Merger===

[[File:Abs cbn 1963 logo.jpg|thumb|left|180px|A short-lived logo used by ABS-CBN from 1963 to 1967.]]
In turn, on 24 September, 1956, the Chronicle Broadcasting Network (CBN) was organized. The network was owned by Don Eugenio Lopez, Sr. and the then Philippine Vice President Fernando Lopez, and later on launched its very own TV station, DZXL-TV 9. The following year, Don Eugenio acquired ABS from Quirino and Lindenberg. However, it was only on 1 February 1967, that the corporate name was changed to ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation to reflect the merger (before it was named ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation, the name was reverted to the precursor of the network, Bolinao Electronics Corporation or BEC, but the ABS-CBN brand was first used in 1961). In 1958 the network's new headquarters at Roxas Boulevard was inaugurated, and all radio and television operations were consolidated into its two buildings, the radio stations at the Chronicle Building at Aduana Street, [[Intramuros]], [[Manila]], and the TV operations at the brand new Roxas Boulevard building in [[Pasay City]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

In the late 1950s, Don Eugenio's son, [[Eugenio Lopez, Jr.|Geny Lopez]] saw the potential of TV and radio to reach and link Filipinos across the archipelago. By the mid-1960s, the ABS network was leading the radio industry, with stations like DZXL and DZAQ Radyo Patrol in the Manila area, which featured journalists like [[Ernie Baron]], Bong Lapira, Orly Mercado, [[Joe Taruc]], Mario Garcia, Jun Ricafrente, Bobby Guanzon, and [[Rey Langit]], and various other stations nationwide. ABS also made breakthroughs in the TV industry by achieving the country's first color TV broadcast, first satellite feed (during remarkable events including the Man on the Moon, Ruby Tower collapse, interment of Robert Kennedy and the US Presidential Elections), and first use of videotape, among others. It featured top shows then, such as ''Your Evening with Pilita'' and ''Tawag ng Tanghalan'', the country's first comedy show ''Buhay Artista'', first Philippine game show, ''What's My Living'' and the first noontime show ''[[Student Canteen]]'', among others. It was also pioneering in marathon election coverage in 1967 when the TV &amp; radio stations of the network aired election updates for 36 hours sharp - making it a national first.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

[[File:abscbn60s.svg|150px|thumb|right|ABS-CBN logo (February 1, 1967 – September 21, 1972), still used in ABS-CBN Broadcasting Center's facade.]]
On 15 June 1961, [[Eugenio Lopez, Jr.]] built the first provincial TV station in [[Cebu City|Cebu]] (based in Mandaue) airing 4 hours with the tallest tower (in that time) measuring 216 feet. Within weeks, another TV station in Dagupan opened its doors followed by the first broadcasts in Negros Island (through Bacolod) in 1963. Western Visayas had its first station in Iloilo City in 1964, the Socskargen region then followed up with the opening of its own regional station in 1965 and Baguio and Davao followed suit in 1967.

Two years later, the network's first test color broadcasts began with the help of the [[RCA|Radio Corporation of America]]. Color broadcasts started in November 1966, the first in the Philippines and Southeast Asia as the network was tagged as the ''[[Timeline of the introduction of color television in countries|First in Color Television]]'', with full-color broadcasting beginning in 1971 at all national television stations.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

On 18 December 1968, ABS-CBN opened its new [[ABS-CBN Broadcasting Center|Broadcast Center]] on Bohol Avenue (renamed as Sgt. Esguerra Avenue in 1989), [[Quezon City]], where it still stands today. At the time, it was the most advanced facility of its kind in Asia. The station again made breakthroughs by using the first live satellite transmissions from abroad, foremost of which was the [[first moon landing]] in 1969 and in the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] in [[Mexico]] the year before. The network enjoyed a big portion of the ratings and won various awards and recognitions from different organizations.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; The network pioneered the first all-national news simulcasts also in the same year as well.

{{cquote|Whatever we do and wherever we go, we should be faithful to our commitment of being in the service of the Filipino.|author=Eugenio Lopez Jr. during the inauguration of the ABS-CBN Broadcasting Center}}

By 1972, the ABS-CBN network owned and operated two television stations and 7 radio stations in Manila, 14 radio stations and three television stations in the provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=msUeAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=chronicle+broadcasting+network&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ItkvVNXxE42QuAS0ioHgDQ&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=chronicle%20broadcasting%20network&amp;f=false|title=The Politics of Southeast Asia's New Media|last=Atkins|first=William|date=November 13, 2013|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=|isbn=9781136860621|location=|page=25|accessdate=October 4, 2014|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Martial law era===
The station suffered a setback upon the declaration of [[martial law]]. In the midnight of 22 September 1972, a day after the declaration of Martial Law, ABS-CBN and its affiliate stations were seized. Geny Lopez, the president of the company, was imprisoned and held without trial for five years until he and his cellmate [[Sergio Osmeña III]] launched a daring jailbreak in 1977 and sought asylum in the [[United States]] together with his family. The network itself was taken over by Roberto Benedicto, a presidential crony, who used the Broadcasting Center at Bohol Avenue, then renamed as "Broadcast Plaza", as the home of [[People's Television Network|MBS-4]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; Channel 2 would later be relaunched as the [[Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation|BBC-2]], with a completely new logo, slogan, and a theme song from [[Jose Mari Chan]] entitled "Big Beautiful Country" and sung by various artists. BBC-2 later moved to new headquarters in [[Broadcast City]] (also in Diliman, Quezon City) in 1978. The network's radio stations were also affected with BBC and [[Radio Philippines Network]] operating several of the stations.

===Capture of Broadcast Plaza (MBS-4)===
At the height of the [[People Power Revolution]], military reformists, believing that television would be a powerful tool to aid the revolution, attacked and took over the ABS-CBN Broadcasting Center. On 24 February 1986, former ABS-CBN talents put the station back on the air and televised the drama of the unfolding uprising, thereby contributing to the strength of the revolt.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; BBC-2, on the other hand, ceased operations after reformists shut down its transmitter on the following day as Channel 2 frequency was turned over to the Lopezes on July 16, 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stuartxchange.com/DayFour.html EDSA People Power Revolution Day 4] retrieved October 31, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 February 1986, after the Revolutions, Geny Lopez returned to the country after self-exile in the United States and started rebuilding from what was left of the station. Recovery was difficult and resources were low, hence, former ABS-CBN employees Freddie García, Ben Aniceto and Rolly Cruz was brought in to rework the station's programming. Thus, the channel began to rebroadcast to viewers once again starting September 14 of the same year. Aniceto, who worked as the Program Director for Radio and Television of the network and station manager of Channel 2 in the 1970s, was served as the first Vice President and General Manager of ABS-CBN upon the network's reopening from 1986 to 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/lifestyle/03/21/16/abs-cbns-post-edsa-boss-ben-aniceto-passes-away|title=ABS-CBN's post-EDSA boss Ben Aniceto passes away|publisher=''[[ABS-CBN News]]''|date=March 21, 2016|accessdate=March 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 March 1987, Channel 2 was relaunched with the live musical special, ''The Star Network: Ang Pagbabalík Ng Bituin'' (The Return of the Star) which noted for the then-brand-new numerical white tri-ribbon channel 2 logo with a white rhomboidal star (from 1988 to 1993 the ribbons were tri-coloured in red, green and blue) as a centerpiece of the network's revival. By 1988, ABS-CBN had regained its foothold in Philippine TV ratings from dead last (#5) to being number 1 again nationally - as a result of the rebranding.

Within the year, ABS-CBN also beefed up its news programmes with ''[[TV Patrol]]'', anchored by a team of [[news presenter|newsreaders]] composed of now-former [[Vice President of the Philippines|Vice-President]] [[Noli de Castro]], [[Mel Tiangco]], [[Frankie Evangelista]], and Angelique Lazo, with the late [[Ernie Baron]] telling the daily weather forecast. Other reputable news programmes followed, such as ''[[Magandang Gabi, Bayan]]'' and ''[[Hoy Gising!]]''.  The entertainment programmes of ABS-CBN were also revamped with series that previously aired on [[Radio Philippines Network|RPN 9]] and [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation|IBC 13]]: (''[[Eat Bulaga!]]'', ''[[Okey Ka Fairy Ko!]]'', ''[[The Sharon Cuneta Show]]'', ''[[Coney Reyes on Camera]]'') while producing original content (''The Maricel Soriano Drama Special'', ''[[Palibhasa Lalake]]'', ''[[Home Along Da Riles]]'').  Another feature of its return to the top of the ratings is the introduction of the live-action [[sentai]] and [[tokusatsu]] show formats from Japan (with ''[[Bioman]]'', ''[[Goggle V]]'' ''[[Space Sheriff Gavan|Gavan]]'' and ''[[Shaider]]'', the latter the first ever tokusatsu program to be aired in English and Filipino) to Philippine television full-time (after a brief appearance on RPN). Filipino-dubbed [[anime]] programmes, another network and Philippine television first, would only begin in the transition to the 1990s, and 1987's ''[[Hikari Sentai Maskman]]'', aired by the network, was first ever sentai program to dub in [[Filipino language|Filipino]].

Within months after the relaunch in Manila, the revived network also restarted regional programs and broadcasting starting in Baguio, Cebu, Bacolod, and Davao (and later in Zamboanga and Cagayan de Oro). Within the 1990s, the network also helped open new stations in other parts of the country, while reopening stations used before.

In January 1989, ABS-CBN began shifting to satellite broadcast, enabling the entire country to watch the same programs simultaneously. This was also the very year when the network began international broadcasts to [[Guam]] and [[Saipan]], [[Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands|Northern Marianas]], also via satellite, yet another first for Philippine and Asian television. At the same time, the network began to increase the number of local TV programs being aired and produced.

Slowly, the station inched its way to financial recovery, which it achieved by 1990, regularly garnering around 70% of the market. In 1992, ABS-CBN Talent Center (now [[Star Magic]]) was formed and in 1993, ABS-CBN launched [[Star Cinema]] as the company began to diversify. In 1995, Star Records (now [[Star Music]]) was launched. In that year, ABS-CBN also launched their own website ABS-CBN.com, the first Filipino television network in the World Wide Web and was created by its IT department Internet Media Group (IMG, which later became [[ABS-CBN Interactive]] until its merger in 2015).

On 30 March 1998, ABS-CBN Holdings Corporation was incorporated as Worldtech Holdings Corporation for the primary purpose of issuance of Philippine Depository Receipt (PDR) and the acquisition and holding of shares of ABS-CBN Corporation. Its Philippine depository receipt (PDR) is traded in the Philippine Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ABSP.

Geny Lopez died of cancer on 29 June 1999, in the United States. This happened six months before the network celebrated the millennium by unveiling a new logo and inaugurating its [[Millennium Transmitter]] in the corporation grounds, resulting in a clearer signal for its television and radio stations in Mega Manila.

In 2002, [[Finance Asia]] ranked ABS-CBN as the 8th best-managed company in the Philippines in its "Asia's Best Companies 2002" survey. The survey covers the performance of the top companies in 10 countries in Asia. Finance Asia polled institutional investors and equity analysts for this survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Asia's Best Companies 2002 - Philippines|url=https://www.financeasia.com/News/31542,asias-best-companies-2002---philippines.aspx|date=12 March 2002|accessdate=26 May 2018|publisher=[[Finance Asia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 May 2010, the conglomerate dropped the word "Broadcasting" from its corporate name.

===Expansion===
{{refimprove section|date=February 2017}}
Since the 1990s, ABS-CBN has expanded into various successful media and entertainment ventures such as talent development and management ([[Star Magic]]), film and television production and distribution ([[Star Cinema]]), music and video recording, publishing, and distribution ([[Star Music]]), print publishing ([[ABS-CBN Publishing]]), new media ([[ABS-CBN Digital Media]]), pay TV ([[ABS-CBN Cable Channels]]), international television distribution ([[The Filipino Channel|ABS-CBN Global]]), telecommunications ([[ABS-CBN Convergence]], San Francisco International Gateway, and [[Sky (cable company)|Sky Cable]]), sports programming ([[ABS-CBN Sports]]), post-production ([[RoadRunner (division)|RoadRunner]]; dissolved in 2013), home TV shopping ([[O Shopping]]), and theme park ([[Play Innovations]]).

On 24 September 1994, ABS-CBN signed a historic deal with [[PanAmSat]] to bring the first trans-Pacific Asian programming to some two million Filipino immigrants in United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Jessel|first=Harry|last2=Taishoff|first2=Lawrence|title=Television and Radio|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite]]|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]]|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This deal would later gave birth to [[The Filipino Channel]] which is now available globally.

The company has also syndicated its programs for international audience through its ABS-CBN International Distribution division. Among the programs that gained popularity abroad are ''[[Pangako Sa 'Yo]]'', ''[[Kay Tagal Kang Hinintay]]'', ''[[Lobo (TV series)|Lobo]]'', ''[[Sana Maulit Muli]]'', ''[[Kahit Isang Saglit]]'', and ''[[Be Careful With My Heart]].''

ABS-CBN had a failed venture in online gaming industry in the Philippines through its now-defunct subsidiary ABS-CBN Multimedia, Inc. The subsidiary was the owner of Get Amped and Amped Casual Games, the  Philippine operator of ''[[Tantra Online]], [[War Rock]], [[Cronous]], [[Ragnarok Online]]'', and [[PopCap Games]]. Another failed venture was the 5 million dollar deal with the now defunct social network site [[Multiply (website)|Multiply]].

In 2005, ABS-CBN International acquired the [[Richmond, California]]-based [[telecommunications port]] company San Francisco International Gateway from [[Loral Space &amp; Communications]]. San Francisco International Gateway provides satellite communications services through its 2.5-acre facility consisting of 19 satellite dish antennas and 9 modular equipment buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Customer Showcase: ABS-CBN|url=https://www.asgllc.com/customer-showcase-abs-cbn|publisher=Advanced Systems Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, ABS-CBN International launched [[Myx TV|Myx]], the first and the only Asian-American youth music channel in the United States. It was later reformatted in 2011 to become a general entertainment channel targeted to the Asian-Americans.

In 2008, ABS-CBN International opened its state-of-the-art studio in [[Redwood City, California]].

===The ''Kapamilya'' network===
[[File:ABS-CBN logo.svg|thumb|left|150px|ABS-CBN logo (January 1, 2000 – December 31, 2013)]]
In 2003, during the 50th anniversary of Philippine television, ABS-CBN launched its present brand name, "''Kapamilya''" (literally means "a member of the family").

Its international unit ABS-CBN Global Ltd. plans to undertake an initial public offering (IPO) the following year and might list on the Singapore Stock Exchange to help finance its expansion plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Logata|first=Charo|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryID=63141|title=ABS-CBN confirms IPO for Global|accessdate=April 7, 2007|publisher=''[[ABS-CBN Interactive]]''}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The network celebrated its golden anniversary in 2003. The network held its Kapamilya Homecoming, which gathered over 4,000 former employees and talents for a grand reunion at ABS-CBN’s compound in Bohol Avenue, Quezon City. The network also launched a promo called "Treasure Hunt", where the people were invited to bring their oldest television, radio sets, microphones, and posters. The network also celebrated its 16th-year reign in the TV ratings, with 13 of their shows included in the Top 15 daily programs in TV. ABS-CBN also launched several new shows such as ''[[Meteor Garden]]''. The company also did a nationwide caravan, showcasing the network's talents.

On 19 October 2003, the network held a month-long celebration of ABS-CBN and Philippine TV's  50th year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Vanzi|first=Sol Jose|title=ABS-CBN'S 50TH YEAR CELEBRATES PHILIPPINE TELEVISION|url=http://www.newsflash.org/2003/05/be/be002608.htm|publisher=''Newsflash.org''|date=November 1, 2003|accessdate=March 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The station produced two commemorative documentaries about the station's contribution in news and entertainment. ''Sa Mata ng Balita'' encapsulated some of the most unforgettable, most remarkable, and most celebrated landmarks of the last 50 years as captured by television news. ''50 Taong Ligawan: The Pinoy TV History'', on the other hand, was the first extensive television documentary done about the history of Philippine television and the evolution of Philippine entertainment. For the celebration's finale, the broadcasting giant capped its 50th anniversary with a spectacular extravaganza dubbed as ''Kapamilya: ABS-CBN at 50'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.newsflash.org/2003/05/be/be002608.htm| title = ABS-CBN'S 50th Year Celebrates Philippine Television| author = Sol Jose Vanzi| accessdate = April 7, 2007| date = November 1, 2003| publisher = ''[[The Philippine Star]]''}}
&lt;/ref&gt; held at the [[Philippine International Convention Center]] (PICC) in Pasay City. It was hailed as one of the biggest media events of the year. The Lopez-led network rolled out the red carpet to welcome its high-profile guests from the business, advertising and media sectors, politics, members of the diplomatic community, with many of the society’s luminaries and glitterati. Valued friends and supporters of the network throughout the five decades also attended the grand affair. The network's official 50 Years station ID won an Award for Excellence in the 2004 Golden Quill Festival.

In 2008, ABS-CBN celebrated the 55th year of Philippine television. A new station ID entitled "Beyond Television" was launched.

==Branding==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2017}}
[[File:Alto Broadcasting System 1953-1967 logo.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The logo of Alto Broadcasting System (1953-1967).]]
[[File:CBN_1956_version_2.png|thumb|right|The logo of Chronicle Broadcasting Network (1956-1967).]]
The ABS-CBN logo features three main elements, the vertical line rooted on a horizontal origin, the three extending circles, and the text ABS-CBN. The vertical line or bar represents a tower (broadcasting tower) as well as dignifying the company and representing its core business of broadcasting, with the circles symbolizing a transmitter tower's signals, and representing the red, green and blue or [[RGB]] colors which makes up a [[pixel]] shown on the [[television]]. The 3 divisions of the Philippines, Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao, are also denoted by the three circles, as well as its wide presence, “range for imagination”, and its “pioneering, embracing” spirit.

One unique thing about ABS-CBN's logo is that it has a horizontal version, usually used to save space as the main vertical logo usually takes up more space than the horizontal one. The design of the horizontal version of the logo contains the ABS-CBN text, split into two parts, "ABS" and "CBN", without the dash connecting them, and ABS-CBN's iconic symbol squeezed in between them.

The first logo to have a horizontal version going by this design was the logo launched in 1986, the year they relaunched their operations after 14 years of hibernation under martial law and Marcos' authoritarian rule. From 1986 up until 2014, the elements of the horizontal logo, text, and symbol were evenly sized. In the 2014 version of the horizontal logo, the symbol of ABS-CBN was squeezed in between was slightly larger than the ABS (Alto Broadcasting System) and CBN (Chronicle Broadcasting Network) names.

===Channel 2===
Since 1969, the network has started using a channel logo beginning on DZAQ-TV with the early channel 2 logo for use as a promotion from 1969 to 1972 as ''The Family Channel''. The frequency was later awarded to [[Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] as [[DWWX-TV]] from 1973 to 1986, and had a different logo used. Channel 2 is currently used as the frequency of the flagship station of ABS-CBN in Metro Manila.

ABS-CBN introduced an innovation to the channel 2 logo from 1986 to 1992. At first, the channel 2 logo is introduced into ABS-CBN, after the dissolution of BBC in March. The features of the first channel 2 logo is a wing-shaped blue crest with a white curve at the top and a white line as a tail, the Broadway 2 logo was used from 1986 to 1987. It has a slogan name ''Watch Us Do It Again!'' as the station ID aired since the network's revival.

After six months of carefully selected plans, the first tri-ribbon 2 logo laced with a rhomboidal star came to be on 1 March 1987. The tri-ribbon 2 logo's color is white carried the slogan ''The Star Network'' when it aired as a station ID to reclaim the dominance in TV ratings, using the [[Scanimate]] system that it took over from the private-owned BBC-2. By 1988, the ribbons in the tri-ribbon 2 logo were changed into red, green and blue stripes from the three white stripes it first used. Truly, the tri-ribbon 2 logo was accidentally coming from a shooting star in the form of the number 2 in the idents which came out. Similarly, most numerical channel logos within this slogan have a star and versions came into regional TV channels like 3 ([[DYCB-TV]] in Cebu and [[DZRR-TV|D-3-ZO-TV]] in Baguio), 4 ([[DYXL-TV]] in Bacolod and [[DXAS-TV]] in Davao) and other regional stations. The tri-ribbon 2 was also used on microphone flags until 2000, the celebration of the New Millennium.

===Sarimanok===
The [[Sarimanok]], a legendary bird in Philippine Folklore was first used in 1966 to identify color broadcasts (somewhat similar on how the [[NBC logos|NBC peacock]] has been utilized). In 1993, which happens to be the Chinese Year of the Rooster, ABS-CBN relaunched the Sarimanok with a new station ID featuring the legendary bird. The ''Sarimanok'' ID became utmostly associated with the channel that ABS-CBN opted it to become the station's mascot. ABS-CBN later named its new 24-hour news channel the Sarimanok News Network, the precursor of the [[ABS-CBN News Channel]]. It was revived again in 2004 to promote regional broadcasts nationwide.

===Evolution of ABS-CBN logos===
The logo of pre-merger Alto Broadcasting System had a symbol composed of a transmitter with a circle denoting its signals, a precursor of sorts to ABS-CBN's current logos. The logo of pre-merger Chronicle Broadcasting Network, on the other hand, had three blocks and the CBN letters in them. In 1961, the ABS-CBN brand was introduced and its first logo had a big letter B, unifying the names ABS and CBN, in a box placed between their channel numbers 3 (ABS' DZAQ-TV) and 9 (CBN's DZXL-TV).

A modified version of ABS' symbol was launched in 1963, composed of a triangle denoting a transmitter tower and four circles denoting its signals (in the same vein as the 1953 logo), enclosed in a rounded box and with the ABS-CBN text above, in a form that would evolve over the years. The logo soon after took on its current iteration—a vertical line, denoting a transmitter tower, with three concentric circles signifying Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao, enclosed in a square frame, in 1967. At that time, it was rendered in black and white because color TV (despite the fact that it was ABS-CBN that introduced it the previous year) wasn't common yet and the logo style at that time separated ABS and CBN's names, putting ABS' name on top and CBN's on the bottom.

The network used a colored variation of the 1967 logo when color television introduced and they relaunched operations in 1986, after 14 years of forced closure under martial law. The logo had the three rings detached from the transmitter and colored the three rings in red, green, and blue, and substituted the square frame with an outlined black box. The RGB-colored logo has remained relatively unchanged since then, though two modifications in 1993 (the 40th anniversary of Philippine TV) and 1996 (ABS-CBN's 50th corporate anniversary) saw minor tweaks in the letters and the rings and box.

1 January 2000 (the first day of the new millennium) saw a significantly revamped version of the logo. In this version, the outlined black box that enclosed the three rings and the vertical line (that maintained their 1996 design) was replaced by a grey square (a crystal plane when rendered in 3D) and the ABS and CBN names joined together to form ABS-CBN's name, now situated below the symbol. The ABS-CBN letters were also given a completely revamped look.

The present logo, launched in 2014, is a minimally altered version of the 2000 logo, greatly modifying the "ABS-CBN" text, dropping the once-standard serifs on the letters, giving the three RGB rings thicker width and perfected concentricity, and adopting a white square instead of a black or grey one. The rebranding aims to maintain the iconic structure of ABS-CBN's logo while at the same time giving it a new look suited for a period of popularity for social and digital media.

[[File:Anthonyweiner.jpg|thumb|right|Anthony Weiner, Congressional portrait, {{circa|2007}}]]
[[Anthony Weiner]] is a former member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] from [[New York City]] who has been involved in multiple sex scandals related to [[sexting]].

The first scandal began when Weiner was a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[United States Congress|U.S. Congressman]]. He used the [[social media]] website [[Twitter]] to send a link that contained a sexually suggestive picture of himself to a 21-year-old woman. After initially denying reports that he had posted the image, he admitted that he sent a link to the photo. He also sent additional sexually explicit photos and messages to women before and during his marriage. He denied ever having met or having had a physical relationship with any of the women. On June 16, 2011, Weiner announced his intention to resign from Congress effective June 23.

Weiner returned to politics in April 2013 when he entered the [[New York City mayoral election, 2013|New York City mayoral race]]. After additional pictures of Weiner were released, Weiner admitted sexting at least three women since his resignation from Congress. He remained in the race until the end, placing fifth in the Democratic primary.

Following a report from the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' in September 2016, the [[FBI]] investigated Weiner for sexting with a 15-year-old girl. His laptop was seized and emails related to the [[Hillary Clinton email controversy]] were found on it, causing a controversy late in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|presidential election]]. On May 19, 2017, Weiner pled guilty to one count of transferring obscene material to a minor. His wife, [[Huma Abedin]], filed for divorce prior to Weiner's guilty plea. In September, he was sentenced to 21 months in federal prison. On November 6, 2017, Weiner began his sentence at [[Federal Medical Center, Devens]], in [[Ayer, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/06/us/weiner-reports-to-prison/index.html|title=Anthony Weiner reports to prison|last=CNN|first=Jean Casarez,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; His release date is scheduled for 2019.

==Initial media reports and Weiner's denial==
On May 27, 2011, Weiner used his public Twitter account to send a link to a photo on [[yfrog]].&lt;ref name="nymag photo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nypost_110605"/&gt; The picture of his [[erection|erect penis]] concealed by [[boxer briefs]]&lt;ref name="nymag photo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="troubling tweet"/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated7/&gt;&lt;ref name=nypost_110605/&gt; was sent to a 21-year-old female college student from [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]],&lt;ref name="student embroiled"/&gt; who was following his posts on the [[social media]] website.&lt;ref name="whose crotch"/&gt; Though the link was quickly removed from Weiner's Twitter account, screen shots of Weiner’s original message and of the photo were captured by a user identified as "Dan Wolfe" on Twitter and subsequently sent to blogger [[Andrew Breitbart]] who published them on his [[BreitbartTV|BigGovernment]] website the following day.&lt;ref name=Behind&gt;{{cite web |last1=Muñoz-Temple |first1=Amanda |title=The Man Behind Weiner's Resignation |url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/the-man-behind-weiner-s-resignation-20110616 |website=National Journal |accessdate=January 4, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702002145/http://www.nationaljournal.com/the-man-behind-weiner-s-resignation-20110616 |archivedate=July 2, 2015 |date=June 16, 2011|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; CNN described it as a "lewd photograph" of a "man bulge in ... underwear".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1106/16/cnr.05.html|title=CNN.com - Transcripts|website=edition.cnn.com|accessdate=May 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 1, 2011, Weiner gave a series of interviews in which he denied sending the photo and suggested that someone, perhaps a political opponent, had hacked into his accounts and published the photo.&lt;ref name="emotional apology"/&gt; Weiner also said he could not say "with certitude" that the photo was not of him. He suggested that the image might be doctored, saying, "Maybe it did start being a photo of mine and now looks something different or maybe it is from another account."&lt;ref name="cantor says"/&gt;&lt;ref name="maybe it started"/&gt;&lt;ref name="blitzer interview"/&gt; He did not ask the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] or [[United States Capitol Police|U.S. Capitol Police]] to investigate the incident&lt;ref name = polprobe/&gt; but said he had retained a private security firm to look into this matter because he felt it was a prank, not a crime.&lt;ref name="can't say"/&gt;  Several bloggers accused Wolfe and Breitbart of planting the photo and message as part of a scheme to defame Weiner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationaljournal.com/the-man-behind-weiner-s-resignation-20110616 The Man Behind Weiner's Resignation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130702000000/http://www.nationaljournal.com/the-man-behind-weiner-s-resignation-20110616 |date=July 2, 2013 }}; ''National Journal''; Amanda Muñoz-Temple; June 16, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence later revealed that a group of self-described conservatives&lt;ref name="news" /&gt; had been monitoring Weiner's communications with women for at least three months.  Two false identities of underage girls had been created by unknown parties to solicit communication with Weiner and the women he was contacting.&lt;ref name="news"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/18/nyregion/fake-identities-were-used-on-twitter-to-get-information-on-weiner.html?_r=1 |author=Preston, Jennifer |date=June 17, 2011 |title=Fake Identities Were Used on Twitter in Effort to Get Information on Weiner |work=The New York Times |accessdate=July 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bloggers reported a tweet made in April by a 17-year-old [[Delaware]] girl in which she exclaimed, "Seriously talking to Representative Weiner from New York right now! Like is my life real?" In early June, [[Fox News Channel]], whose reporter "happened to be there when the cops showed up", reported that police went to the girl's house to question her and her parents. The police, who had been "made aware of an alleged contact" between Weiner and the girl, also reviewed content on her computer. Weiner confirmed having communicated with the girl, but denied sending any inappropriate messages. The family of the girl stated the contact was "not salacious or in any manner inappropriate". The police did not find anything wrong in Weiner's communications with the girl.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Anthony Weiner admits contact with girl, 17|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0611/56740.html|date=June 10, 2011|first=Maggie|last=Haberman|work=[[Politico]]|first2=Jonathan|last2=Allen|accessdate=June 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2011/06/12/weiner%E2%80%99s-17-year-old-twitter-contact-responds/ Weiner’s 17-year-old Twitter contact responds]; CNN; June 12, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Weinergate: Cops probe Rep.

===Admission===
On June 6, Breitbart posted a [[Cropping (image)|cropped]], shirtless picture of Weiner that was obtained from a second woman on the Internet,&lt;ref name=Behind /&gt;&lt;ref name="half-naked"/&gt;&lt;ref name="corbett"/&gt; and said that Weiner had sent more pictures of himself, including at least one that was sexually graphic.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2/&gt; After this information had been made public, Weiner held a press conference in New York and apologized, saying, "I have not been honest with myself, my family, my constituents, my friends and supporters, and the media" and that, "to be clear, the picture was of me, and I sent it."&lt;ref name="transcript"/&gt; After being prompted by reporters, he specifically apologized to Andrew Breitbart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Weiner: 'I apologize to Andrew Breitbart'|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/onmedia/0611/Weiner_I_apologize_to_Andrew_Breitbart.html|publisher=Politico|accessdate=July 19, 2014|date=June 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said he had "engaged in several inappropriate conversations conducted over Twitter, [[Facebook]], [[email]] and occasionally on the phone" and had exchanged "messages and photos of an explicit nature with about six women over the last three years". He added he had never met or had a physical relationship with any of them. He said he was "deeply ashamed" of his "terrible judgment and actions", which he called "very dumb."&lt;ref name=pressconftransc/&gt;

When Weiner answered questions, he said that he had the continuing support of his wife Huma Abedin, who was a long-time aide to [[Hillary Clinton]].&lt;ref name="unflappable"/&gt; He had married Abedin in July 2010 in a ceremony officiated by [[Bill Clinton]], and he said that he did not intend to resign his congressional seat.&lt;ref name="admits internet"/&gt; Prior to his marriage, Weiner was known for his "bachelor exploits with some of New York's most eligible women," detailed in a 2011 ''[[Moment (magazine)|Moment]]'' profile of the Congressman.&lt;ref name="live from NY"/&gt; Following the revelations of his inappropriate communications, his reportedly emotional apology to former president Clinton was referred to in the press as highly ironic.&lt;ref name="clintons unhappy"/&gt; Asked about an allegation that he had engaged in [[phone sex]] with a woman in [[Nevada]], Weiner neither confirmed nor denied the statement, saying that though he did not want to impinge the privacy of any of the women, neither would he contradict any of their statements.&lt;ref name = pressconftransc/&gt; At his press conference, Weiner did admit that he had exchanged the reported [[Sexting|sexting messages]] with his accuser.&lt;ref name=pressconftransc/&gt;&lt;ref name="nydnsp"/&gt;

===Later events===
During an appearance on [[Sirius XM]] radio on June 8, 2011, Breitbart showed hosts [[Opie and Anthony]] a photograph of what he claimed to be Weiner's nude genitalia. One of the cameras in the room caught the cell phone's display, and the hosts subsequently leaked the photo by publishing it on Twitter.&lt;ref name="by opie"/&gt; Breitbart stated that the photo was published without his permission, and later told [[KFI]] radio, "These people have admitted that they did this surreptitiously and illicitly and they lied in the process saying that they didn't even have a camera in the place."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/anthony-weiners-genitalia-photo-puts-196386|title=Anthony Weiner's Genitalia Photo Puts Sirius XM in Sticky Situation (Video)|last=Bond|first=Paul|date=June 9, 2011|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=June 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weiner's spokesperson issued the following statement: "As Representative Weiner said on Monday when he took responsibility for his actions, he has sent explicit photos."&lt;ref name="democrats push"/&gt;

News media also reported the identity of other Weiner's social media contacts, Lisa Weiss, a 40-year-old [[blackjack]] dealer in [[Las Vegas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/06/06/2011-06-06_rep_anthony_weiners_sexting_partners_meagan_broussard_lisa_weiss_out_themselves_.html#ixzz1RwtOJCEv|author=Hartenstein, Meena|date=June 6, 2011|title=Rep.

On June 15, Ginger Lee held a press conference during which she said that when she requested advice from Weiner on how to respond to the media, he had advised her on June 2 that if they both stayed quiet the scandal would die down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/15/us-usa-politics-weiner-pornstar-idUSTRE75E3N820110615|title=Porn star says Representative Weiner asked her to lie|agency=Reuters|accessdate=June 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political and constituent reaction===
On the afternoon of June 6, 2011, [[House Minority Leader]] [[Nancy Pelosi]] called for an investigation by the [[House Ethics Committee]] to determine "whether any official resources were used or any other violation of House rules occurred".&lt;ref name="peleth"/&gt; A number of Democratic and Republican congressmen called for Weiner's resignation.&lt;ref name="boehner silent"/&gt; On June 7, [[Republican National Committee Chairman]] [[Reince Priebus]] called for him to resign, and challenged Pelosi to suggest the same. [[House Majority Leader]] [[Eric Cantor]] (R, VA) said he should resign, opining: "The last thing we need is to be immersed in discussion about Congressman Weiner and his Twitter activities."&lt;ref name="repres"/&gt; House Democrats who called for him to resign on June 8 included Representatives [[Allyson Schwartz]] (PA), [[Mike Ross (politician)|Mike Ross]] (AR), [[Mike Michaud]] (ME), [[Niki Tsongas]] (MA), [[Larry Kissell]] (NC) and [[Joe Donnelly]] (IN).&lt;ref name="democrats step"/&gt; 

On June 11, Nancy Pelosi, [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee|DCCC]] [[Steve Israel]], and [[Democratic National Committee|DNC]] Chair [[Debbie Wasserman Schultz]] called for Weiner's resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2011/06/nancy_pelosi_i_urge_weiner_to.html|title=Weiner Enters 'Treatment Center' As Pelosi, Top Dems Urge Him to Quit|work=New York|accessdate=June 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailycaller.com/2011/06/11/dnc-chairwoman-debbie-wasserman-schultz-calls-on-weiner-to-resign|author=Nelson, Steven|date=June 11, 2011|title=Wasserman Schultz, Pelosi call on Weiner to resign|publisher=The Daily Caller|accessdate=July 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weiner requested and was granted a short leave of absence from the House to obtain professional treatment of an unspecified nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/11/anthony-weiner-treatment_n_875422.html?icid=maing-grid7%7Cmaing6%7Cdl1%7Csec1_lnk2%7C70084|title=Anthony Weiner To Seek Treatment|work=The Huffington Post|date=June 11, 2011|accessdate=June 12, 2011|first=Elyse|last=Siegel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two June 6 surveys of New York City adult residents provided conflicting results. A TV station [[NY1]] and [[Marist College]] poll indicated that 51% believed Weiner should remain in Congress, 30% thought he should step down, and 18% were unsure.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3/&gt; A WABC-TV/SurveyUSA automated survey found the city divided, with 46 percent who thought he should resign and 41 percent who thought he should stay in office.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost1"/&gt; On June 9, a NY1-Marist Poll showed that 56% of registered voters in Weiner's [[New York's 9th congressional district|Congressional District]] wanted him to stay in Congress, and 33% thought he should resign, with 12% uncertain. In the same poll, 73% said he acted unethically, but not illegally.&lt;ref name="nypost1"/&gt;

On June 13, [[White House]] spokesman [[Jay Carney]] said "The president feels... this is a distraction, as Congressman Weiner has said himself, his behavior was inappropriate; dishonesty was inappropriate."&lt;ref name="CNN white house"/&gt; President [[Barack Obama]] said in an interview later that day that if he were Weiner, he would resign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/13/obama-anthony-weiner-resign_n_876327.html|title=Obama On Anthony Weiner: If I Were Him I'd Resign|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=June 13, 2011|first=Elyse|last=Siegel|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623115121/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/13/obama-anthony-weiner-resign_n_876327.html|archivedate=June 23, 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resignation===
On June 16, 2011, Weiner announced he would resign his seat in Congress. He made the announcement at a news conference in Brooklyn, at the same location where he announced his first campaign for New York City Council in 1992.&lt;ref name=hasntofficially/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See:

==2013 mayoral race and second scandal==
In April 2013, the former congressman announced his return to politics as [[New York City mayoral election, 2013|candidate for mayor of New York City]]. He soon became the front runner against Democratic primary-opponent City Council Speaker [[Christine Quinn]].&lt;ref name="wsj-poll_130626"/&gt;

On July 23, 2013, more pictures and sexting allegedly by Weiner were released by the website ''The Dirty''.&lt;ref name="Thedirty.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; They were allegedly sent under the alias "'''Carlos Danger'''" to a 22-year-old woman named with whom Weiner had contact in late 2012, as late as April 2013,&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; more than a year after Weiner left Congress. The woman's identity had yet to be confirmed. At a news conference that same day, with his wife Huma by his side, Weiner responded, "I said that other texts and photos were likely to come out, and today they have."  He also said he would not drop out of the mayoral election for the City of New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Weiner still in NYC race despite improper messages|last=Moore|first=Martha T.|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/07/23/weiner-more-lewd-messages/2579631|work=[[USA Today]]|date=July 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 24 Weiner's sexting partner's identity was confirmed as Sydney Leathers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/07/24/weiner-resists-calls-to-withdraw-as-woman-who-received-messages-is-identified/|title=Weiner resists calls to withdraw as woman who received messages is identified|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; on CNN by a personal friend. Later ''The New York Times'' print edition called for Weiner to withdraw from the mayoral race in an editorial titled "Mr. Weiner and the Elusive Truth".&lt;ref name="elusive"/&gt; In a joint [[NBC 4 New York]]/''[[Wall Street Journal]]''/[[Marist Poll|Marist Institute for Public Opinion]] poll taken that day, Weiner's favorability rating had dropped over 20 points, and he had lost the lead in the primary race to councilor Quinn, now leading him 25 to 16 percent.&lt;ref name="politico"/&gt;

On July 25, the New York ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' reported that, at a news conference in Brooklyn that day, Weiner admitted that he had sexted with three women in the months after his resignation from Congress, and that there had been six to ten women involved in total, not "dozens and dozens".&lt;ref name="NYDN"/&gt; Weiner’s campaign manager Danny Kedem quit the weekend after the news conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Weiner’s Campaign Manager Quits|first=Michael|last=Barbaro|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/28/nyregion/weiners-campaign-manager-quits.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 27, 2013|accessdate=July 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the primary election on September 10, 2013, the press reported that Sydney Leathers, the young woman at the center of the second scandal, attempted to enter Weiner's campaign party that night, without an invitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/election/sydney-leathers-attempts-crash-anthony-weiner-election-party-article-1.1451641|title=Sydney Leathers, former sexting partner of Anthony Weiner, attempts to crash his election night party|accessdate=September 11, 2013|location=New York|work=Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2013/09/11/sydney-leathers-crashes-sexting-partner-anthony-weiner-concession-party|title=Sydney Leathers crashes sexting partner Anthony Weiner's concession party|accessdate=September 11, 2013|work=Fox News|date=September 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weiner lost decisively in the election, finishing in fifth place with 4.9% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/2013/nyc-primary-results|title=Live Results: New York City Primary Elections|work=[[Huffington Post]]|date=September 11, 2013|first=Aaron|last=Bycoffe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal conviction and divorce==
On August 28, 2016, the ''[[New York Post]]'' reported that Weiner had engaged in sexting with another woman, including sending one picture in July 2015 while lying in bed with his toddler son sleeping next to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Anthony Weiner sexted busty brunette while his son was in bed with him|url=https://nypost.com/2016/08/28/anthony-weiner-sexted-busty-brunette-while-his-son-was-in-bed-with-him|date=August 28, 2016|accessdate=August 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported the next day that Weiner and his wife intended to separate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citenews|title=Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin to Separate After His Latest Sexting Scandal|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/30/nyregion/anthony-weiner-sexting-huma-abedin.html?_r=0|date=August 29, 2016|accessdate=August 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weiner had served as a contributor to [[NY1]], which put  him on indefinite leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/08/29/media/weiner-ny1-nydn/index.html|title=NY1 puts Anthony Weiner on indefinite leave|first=Dylan|last=Byers|publisher=CNN.com|date=August 29, 2016|accessdate=August 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 31, 2017, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that federal prosecutors were weighing whether to bring [[child pornography]] charges against Weiner over the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/prosecutors-weigh-child-pornography-charges-against-anthony-weiner-1485894771|title=Prosecutors Weigh Child-Pornography Charges Against Anthony Weiner|first1=Erica|last1=Orden|first2=Nicole|last2=Hong|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=January 31, 2017|accessdate=January 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 19, 2017, the ''[[New York Times]]'' reported Weiner had surrendered to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] that morning, and  under a [[plea bargain]] he intended to plead guilty to a single charge of transferring obscene material to a minor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/19/nyregion/anthony-weiner-guilty-plea-sexting.html|title=Anthony Weiner to Plead Guilty to Resolve ‘Sexting’ Inquiry

==In popular culture==
The first scandal was used as the inspiration for part of the plot line of Season I-II of the Showtime series ''[[Homeland (TV series)|Homeland]]'', where a protagonist, a war hero (played by [[Damian Lewis]]), is invited to run for Congress (and subsequently gets elected) after the political career of "Congressman Dick Johnson" comes to a sudden end after his sexting pictures are publicized. A ''[[Washington Post]]'' article, noting that the Weiner story broke just in time for script purposes, quotes [[Alex Gansa]], co-creator of ''Homeland'': "We were looking for a way that our lead character could become a congressman in a very quick period of time. This presented itself on a platter."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/reliable-source/post/homeland-does-it-get-washington-right/2011/11/15/gIQAAG4dPN_blog.html "'Homeland': Does it get Washington right?"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', November 15, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2016 documentary ''[[Weiner (film)|Weiner]]'' covers his resignation from Congress and his 2013 run for Mayor of New York City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiewire.com/2016/01/sundance-review-weiner-is-the-best-documentary-about-a-political-campaign-ever-made-32414/ Sundance Review: 'Weiner' is the Best Documentary About a Political Campaign Ever Made], Eric Kohn, Indie Wire, January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/24/anthony-weiner-review-huma-abedin-documentary Weiner review: an unsparing portrait of politics], Lanre Bakare, The Guardian, January 24, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Trick-taking game|trick-taking card games]] like [[Contract bridge|bridge]], the '''beer card''' is the seven of diamonds ({{diamonds}}7) [[playing card]] when it is agreed that, if a player wins the last trick of a hand with the {{diamonds}}7, his partner must buy him a [[beer]]. It is not considered as part of the rules of these games, but an optional and informal side-bet between players. This practice is likely originated from Danish [[Tarot card games|Tarot]] or [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] in the middle of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;McLeod, John.

==Requirements==

[[File:Card05.gif|thumb|right|''The Jack holding the 7 &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;♦&lt;/span&gt;'']]

The requirements vary depending on whether the winner of the last trick is the declarer or a defender. In every case, though, the last trick must be won by {{diams}}7.

For declarer, the requirements are generally that:

*He must make the contract (exceptions may be made for a successful {{gcb|sacrifice|sacrifice}})
*Diamonds must not be trumps (though some people play that only diamond {{gcb|partscore|part-scores}}, and not games or slams, are excluded)
*He must take a justifiable line to win as many tricks as possible

For a defender, the requirements are generally that:

*The contract must be defeated
*Diamonds must not be trumps (though some people play that doubled contracts are excluded)
*He and his partner must try to win as many tricks as possible
*His partner must try to stop him winning the last trick with {{diams}}7

If the contract is doubled, then two beers are earned. If the contract is redoubled, then four beers are earned.

To maximize the chance of getting a beer, declarer must discard two top diamond honors and a small heart from dummy.  If the diamonds do not break 4-0, it is straightforward to cash nine winners, ending with the beer card.  If the diamonds don't break, there's a chance that a defender will be pseudosqueezed and choose to discard a diamond.  For declarer to discard three diamond honors risks losing the contract unnecessarily, and so forfeits the beer, even if diamonds turn out to break normally.

Alternately, if North-South only exclude diamond partials from beer card enforcement, then the declarer in six diamonds can easily beer assuming trumps break.  Declarer wins the (say) heart lead in the South hand and cashes one high trump in the North hand.  When they break, declarer cashes two more high trumps, exits a spade, uses the rounded-suit entries to ruff two spades in the North hand, and finally trump the losing heart with the beer card.  When they do not break, the simplest line (ruff a heart in the South hand) forces declarer to use the beer card while drawing trumps.

|} Note that the four notrump bid is the modern Roman Keycard Blackwood with 1430 responses and clubs as trumps.  South won the {{Hearts}}K lead in dummy, drew trumps in three rounds and played a diamond to the ace.  When both minors broke, South ruffed the remaining heart in hand and claimed his doubled grand slam along with the beers.  Plus 2330, two beers, and 14 IMPs.

In theory, South should have interpreted the final double as a Lightner double and removed to seven diamonds.  However, given that his priorities placed the probable doubled beer ahead of trusting the opponents, he should still not redouble.  Since the opponents were non-vulnerable, it just may have occurred to them to remove to seven hearts.  While the sacrifice rates to go down two thousand, there is certainly no hope for even North to score the beer.

'''''Bert &amp; I''''' is the name given to numerous collections of [[humor]] stories set in the "[[Down East]]" culture of traditional [[Maine]]. These stories were made famous and mostly written by the [[humorist]] storytelling team of [[Marshall Dodge]] (1935&amp;ndash;1982) and Bob Bryan in the 1950s and the 1960s and in later years through retellings by Allen Wicken.

The stories communicate the quirkiness of rural [[New England]] and Maine culture, told in the traditional folksy New England storytelling vein with a dry wit akin to that of the [[Lake Wobegon]] stories&lt;ref name=FiftyYearsCD&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; that would begin appearing in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Rob Nelson, [http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/content/printVersion/140853/ "The Long Goodbye -- Garrison Keillor's Prairie makes a fine pasture for Altman"], June 08, 2006. {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130118152325/http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/content/printVersion/140853/ |date=January 18, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The title characters are [[fisherman|fishermen]] by trade, operating a motor vessel named ''Bluebird'' (and later ''Bluebird II''), based out of [[Kennebunkport]]. Many of the longer stories of Bert &amp; I collections involve incidents during a day's work, with careful detail given to the intricacies of the trade (especially through sound effects vocalized by Dodge).

One story, ''Which Way to [[Millinocket, Maine|Millinocket?]]'', adapts the "You can't get there from here" trope of the 19th-century "Arkansas Traveler" tradition to a [[New England accent]]. The similarly titled ''Which Way to [[Vassalboro, Maine|East Vassalboro]]?'' has a different, anti-urbanite theme.{{Relevance-inline|date=August 2012|reason= Avoiding confusion between the confusingly similar titles they've chosen does not help cover the topic; why worthy of mention?}}

The stories spread beyond New England during the 1970s and 1980s and introduced many parts of the country and world to the regionally distinct Maine (or "Yankee") accent. In 1982, Bryan released a ''Bert &amp; I'' mock language tape, ''How To Talk Yankee,'' with fellow Maine humorist [[Tim Sample]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4778">The '''British Columbia Film Classification Office''' is part of the Business Practices and Consumer Protection Authority in the [[Canadian province]] of [[British Columbia]] under the Motion Picture Act (MP Act) of BC. The BCFCO film ratings are also used by [[Saskatchewan]] under the terms of a bilateral agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saskjustice.gov.sk.ca/film_&amp;_video/ |title=Film and Video Classification Board |publisher=[[Saskatchewan Ministry of Justice]] |accessdate=2007-04-30 |quote=On October 1, 1997, an agreement between the province of British Columbia and Saskatchewan came into effect, under which the [http://www.bcfilmclass.com/ British Columbia Film Classification Office] will classify all new theatrical releases and adult videos on behalf of the Saskatchewan Film and Video Classification Board. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070220150000/http://www.saskjustice.gov.sk.ca/film_%26_video/ |archivedate=2007-02-20 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning on January 1, 1997, the BCFCO used the following [[motion picture rating system]] (based on the [[Canadian Home Video Rating System]]) for [[theatrical]] releases:

* '''General'''. Suitable for viewing by persons of all ages. Occasional violence, swearing and coarse language, and the most innocent of sexually suggestive scenes and nudity, are permitted in this category. (Similar to the [[MPAA film rating system|US rating]] or the lower end of the PG rating)
* '''Parental Guidance'''. Parental guidance advised. Theme or content may not be suitable for all children although there is no age restriction. Motion pictures in this category may contain less subtle sexually suggestive scenes and nudity and a more realistic portrayal of violence than in the General category; coarse language may occur more often than in the General category. 
* '''14A'''. Suitable for persons 14 years of age or older. Persons under 14 years of age must view these motion pictures accompanied by an adult. Motion pictures in this category may contain violence, coarse language or sexually suggestive scenes, or any combination of them.
* '''18A'''. Persons under 18 years of age must view these motion pictures accompanied by an adult. Motion pictures in this category will contain horror, explicit violence, frequent coarse language or scenes that are more sexually suggestive than in the 14A category, or any combination of them.
* '''Restricted'''. Restricted to persons 18 years of age and over. Persons under 18 years of age are not permitted to attend under any circumstances. These motion pictures are "adult motion pictures", as defined in the Act, and may contain explicit sexual scenes, violence or scenes referred to in Section 5(3) of the Act, or any combination of them. The director will assign this classification to motion pictures if the director considers that the theme, subject matter or plot of the adult motion picture is artistic, historical, political, educational or scientific. 
* '''Adult''' - Restricted to persons 18 years of age and over. Persons under 18 years of age are not permitted to attend under any circumstances. These motion pictures are "adult motion pictures", as defined in the Act, and may contain explicit sexual scenes or scenes of brutality or torture to persons or animals, or any combination of them, that are portrayed in a realistic and explicit manner; however, the scenes would, in the director's opinion, be tolerable to the community.

Titles in the "Restricted" and "Adult" categories have labelling and/or display restrictions under the Motion Picture Act for home video retailing purposes, but not those rated 18A or below.

The B.C. Film Classification Office originated the ''restricted cougar'' symbol in the 1970s as an icon that audiences could easily associate with the "Restricted" category. The B.C. Film Classification Office ''chose the cougar not only for its dramatic presence but also its significance as the largest wild cat native to BC''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bcfilmclass.com/cougar/index.htm BC Film Classification Office Cougar symbol] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202101847/http://www.bcfilmclass.com/cougar/index.htm |date=February 2, 2007 }} Retrieved 24 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cinemateca Uruguaya''' (''Uruguayan Cinematheque'') is a non-profit [[cinematheque]] in [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]], established in 1952, that aims to support the cultural development of [[Cinematography|cinema]], and of art in general. Since its inception, it has belonged to the [[International Federation of Film Archives]] (FIAF). It is also a founding member of the Latin American Coordinating Committee of Moving Image Archives (CLAIM), and advisory member of the Audiovisual and Film Institute of Uruguay (ICAU).&lt;ref name="webCinemateca"&gt;{{cita web |url = http://www.cinemateca.org.uy/institucional.html |title = Institucional |author = Cinemateca Uruguaya |access-date = 15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the twentieth century, its archive held 11,500 films, including over 2,000 Uruguayan works.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oei.org.co/sii/entrega6/art05.htm Un archivo muy elocuente] {{es icon}} ({{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/62bXwCPAV?url=http://www.oei.org.co/sii/entrega6/art05.htm |date=October 21, 2011 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Cinemateca Uruguaya received the Premio Morosoli, an Uruguayan cultural award. It was designated Cultural Heritage of the City of Montevideo.&lt;ref&gt;Resolución de la Junta Departamental de Montevideo de 10 de agosto de 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1998, its importance as an educational institution was recognized by the Faculty of Humanities and Educational Science of the [[University of the Republic (Uruguay)|University of the Republic]], and it was categorized as an educational and cultural institution by the Ministry of Education and Culture of Uruguay. Its film archive was declared a national historic monument by the Heritage Commission and the ICAU &lt;ref&gt;Resolución del Poder Ejecutivo de 5 de octubre de 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;, and its activities were declared of departmental and cultural interest to the city of Montevideo.&lt;ref&gt;Resolución n.º&amp;nbsp;5339/07 de la Intendencia Municipal de Montevideo de 24 de diciembre de 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="webCinemateca" /&gt;

'''DC Studios Inc.''' was a British-Canadian [[video game developer]] based in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]]. Originally founded in [[Glasgow]], Scotland in December 1999, the company later expanded to Montreal, [[Edinburgh]], Scotland and [[Dublin]], Ireland. In May 2005, the company acquired ''[[State of Emergency 2]]'' from the defunct [[VIS Entertainment]]. The game released to severe financial underperformance, as a result of which all DC Studios operations in the United Kingdom were halted, leaving only the Montreal studio with 55 employees, which in turn shut down in September the following year.

'''''Da Drought 3''''' is a double-disc [[mixtape]] by [[Lil Wayne]], released on April 13, 2007. It is widely regarded as one of the best mixtapes of all time, receiving rave reviews from ''[[Rolling Stone]],'' [[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]], and [[MTV News]].

== Background ==
This is the third in the trilogy of mixtapes in ''Da Drought'' series. Released in 2007, the mixtape was delayed slightly as a result of Wayne's last-minute decision to add songs to the album's second disc. The album is available as a free legal download. It only contains remixes of other songs. It is noted for Lil Wayne's use of [[similes]], liquid [[non sequitur (humor)|non sequiturs]], and [[metaphors]].&lt;ref name=pitchfork/&gt;

When speaking to [[MTV]] about the double mixtape, Lil Wayne stated that he did not plan on two discs being released until he found how many songs he had recorded. He also stated he did not have a preconceived plan on how to choose the songs:

{{cquote|The radio be on and whatever song comes on, add that instrumental to it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtv.com/bands/h/hip_hop_week/2007/hottest/index12.jhtml MTV News: Hottest MCs In The Game 2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316054025/http://www.mtv.com/bands/h/hip_hop_week/2007/hottest/index12.jhtml |date=2008-03-16 }} ''[[MTV]].com'' Accessed November 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Story==
[[Image:Downinthedumps screenshot01.jpg|thumb|140px|left|Game interface]]
The game's storyline is about the Blubs, an [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]] family (father and mother Blub, their son and daughter, the grandparents and their pet Stinkie), who crash with their [[starship|spaceship]] on a [[landfill]] on [[Earth]] after being pursued by the villainous Khan and his criminal associates. After surviving the crash, the Blub family goes on to live on the landfill, while trying to repair their damaged spaceship in order to return home. The player is set out on a mission by grandfather Blub, an inventor and the spaceship's technician, to find the missing parts needed to reconstruct the spaceship. Meanwhile, Khan, whose ship also crashed on the landfill after the pursuit of the Blub family, sends out his minions to frustrate the efforts of the Blubs.

==Style==
[[Image:Downinthedumps screenshot02.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Screenshot showing the visual style and quality of the [[cutscenes]]]]
The game consists of five parts called "toons", all set in the landfill – except for part five which takes place in space – featuring one or two of the Blub family members as playable characters. The five sections are titled "The Blub, the Rat and the Bad Guy", "The Hypnotic Machine", "The Abominable Robin Blub", "The Bum" and "The End". Each has its own distinct visual theme, although the overall visual style is very [[cartoon]]-like. For example, the player visits the head of a [[homeless person]] ("bum") and a society inhabited by [[frog]]s, where a series of events somewhat reminiscent of the [[Robin Hood]] story is triggered.

The player has to solve different puzzles in order to advance the plot by using a [[point and click]] interface. Large portions of the plot are told by [[pre-rendered]] [[Cutscene|cinematic]]s, often triggered at the beginning or the end of a "toon".

'''''Dragon Seed''''' is a 1944 [[war film|war]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] starring [[Katharine Hepburn]]. Based on a best-selling [[Dragon Seed (novel)|book]] by [[Pearl S. Buck]], the film portrays a peaceful village in [[China]] that has been invaded by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] during the [[Second Sino-Japanese war]]. The men in the village choose to adopt a peaceful attitude toward their conquerors; but the headstrong Jade (Hepburn) stands up to the Japanese.

[[Aline MacMahon]] was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for Best Supporting Actress.

==Plot==
A peaceful Chinese village is invaded by the Japanese prior to World War II. The men elect to adopt a peaceful attitude towards their conquerors and it is understood that the women will stoically acquiesce as well. But Jade ([[Katharine Hepburn]]), a headstrong young woman, intends to stand up to the Japanese whether her husband Lao Er ([[Turhan Bey]]) approves or not. She even goes so far as to learn to read and to handle a weapon, so that she may be properly equipped for both psychological and physical combat. Jade's attitude spreads to the rest of the village, convincing even the staunchest of male traditionalists that the Japanese can be defeated only by offering a strong united front; male and female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/dragon-seed-v14685|title=Dragon Seed (1944) - Harold S.

'''''Dungeon Master: Theron's Quest''''' is a modified version of ''[[Dungeon Master (video game)|Dungeon Master]]'' for the [[TurboGrafx]]/[[PC Engine]] video game console.&lt;ref name="making"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.meanmachinesmag.co.uk/upload/media/scans/retrogamer_dungeonmaster.pdf |title=The Making of Dungeon Master|last=McFerran|first=Damien|work=Issue 34 |year=2006 |publisher=[[Retro Gamer]] Magazine |pages=30–31|accessdate=2011-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released on September 18, 1992 in Japan, with a North American release following the next year.&lt;ref&gt;{{moby game|id=/dungeon-master-therons-quest|name=''Dungeon Master: Theron's Quest''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main goal of the game is Theron finding seven parts of a blue [[knight]]'s [[armor]] (Shield Defiant, Taza Poleyn, Tazahelm, Taza Boots, Taza Armor, Soulcage, The Retaliator), each of which is located in one of seven mini dungeons.&lt;ref name="DME"&gt;[http://dmweb.free.fr/?q=node/252 Dungeon Master Encyclopaedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Differences from the original ==
[[image:Dungeon Master - Theron's Quest in-game screenshot (PC Engine).png|thumb|left|In the Hall of Champions]]
It has a different story, but can be considered as a light version of Dungeon Master. Theron's Quest doesn't contain all of the items, spells and monsters featured in Dungeon Master. Theron's Quest contains seven small dungeons instead of one big dungeon, which however are partially identical or inspired by the original dungeons of Dungeon Master and [[Chaos Strikes Back]]. As in the original, the player goes on a quest with a team of up to four champions fighting through dungeons gaining experience and finding items. In contrast to the original, the player takes the role of a character named Theron and three other champions. After successful completion of each dungeon, the whole party loses its collected items and the three champions lose their skills and statistics. Further, the game can only be saved between dungeons. The lack of the original save option during a level has been replaced by many resurrection 'Altars of VI'. There are also fewer monsters to fight which renders the game easier than the original.&lt;ref name="DME" /&gt;

==Reception==
Upon the game's release, all but one of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'''s four reviewers remarked that ''Dungeon Master'', despite having aged badly over the years, remains a solid RPG. The remaining reviewer stated that [[dungeon crawl]]s "just isn't my type of game." The reviewers generally praised the new CD-quality soundtrack and gave the game a score of 6.5 out of 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Review Crew: Dungeon Master|journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=47|publisher=EGM Media, LLC|date=June 1993|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:XMen Flags.jpg|frame|right|A flag dancer at a nightclub: circa 2001.]]
[[File:Exemplo de flagger girando suas bandeiras.jpg|thumb|Example (2011)]]

The art of '''flagging dance''', often called '''flag spinning''', '''flag dancing''', or '''rag spinning''', but more commonly referred to as '''flagging''', is the undulation, spinning and waving of flags in a rhythmic fashion to music.  Practitioners of this form of performance art and dance are usually referred to as "flaggers" and "flag dancers", though until the 1990s this mostly referred to those waving flags to aid transportation professions ([[flag semaphore]]).

== Origins ==
Modern-day flagging in the [[United States]] developed from [[fan dancing]], which was prominent in the [[leather subculture]] and later circuit parties of [[Fire Island Pines, New York|Fire Island]] and [[Manhattan]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Fierce Tribe: Masculine Identity and Performance in the Circuit|last = Weems|first = Mickey|publisher = Utah State University Press|year = 2008|isbn = 978-0-87421-691-2|location = Logan, Utah|pages = 51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rebirth==
The flaggers and fan dancers almost disappeared as AIDS took its toll on the community&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://flowaffair.org/index.html|title=The Evolution of Flag Dancing - Flow Affair, Flagging and Fanning dance|website=flowaffair.org|access-date=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;, but by 1988 a few masters of these arts ensured they passed their tradition onto new members of the community. Adam Wojtowicz (flags) and Jeffrey Reichlin (fans) were two such performance artists in the New York area first seen at The Saint at Large. Three performed for [[Heritage of Pride]] in 1990, four in 1991. In 1996 thirty fan dancers and flaggers from the Northeast where ready to take rotations on stage at the annual Pride Dance on the Pier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gaycenter.org/archive_item/heritage-of-pride-records/|title=Heritage of Pride Records {{!}} The Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual &amp; Transgender Community Center|date=2018-02-14|work=The Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual &amp; Transgender Community Center|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; San Francisco, where this art form began, was still recovering from its loses. Those who had not died, placed their toys away out of significant grief. [[AmfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research|AmFAR]] held a benefit in September 1997 at the [[Trocadero, San Francisco|Trocadero]] returning the dance to its birthplace.

==Contemporary flags==
The origins of flagging started with simple tee-shirts on the dance floor or fabric with a quarter tied in one corner. Today they are made by adding curtain weights sewn onto portions of two sides of fabric make it possible for flaggers to spin their props, or toys, through the air in ways similar to fan dancing. Given their simpler design (and portability), flagging is easier for beginners to start with and one can purchase pre-made flags from a few artisans such as Don Baker. The first such opportunity was advertised in Circuit Noize magazine in 1997– simple gold lame flags of 3 feet by 5 feet that came with a matching bag. Flags can be of almost any fabric, but silk, organza and lamé are preponderant, with silk being the most favored.  Silk flags are usually dyed in vibrant, [[ultraviolet]] [[fluorescent]] colors, creating an almost hypnotic spectacle when spun rhythmically to music.

==Flagging tribes in the USA==
Flagger groups, known as tribes, formed in [[New York City]], [[Boston]], [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Washington, D.C.|DC]], [[Los Angeles]], [[San Francisco]] and [[South Florida]] in the mid 1990s, and were often part of the backdrop of the [[circuit party]] events mostly attended by [[gay men]]. These were soon followed by the formation of troupes in [[Minneapolis]], [[Seattle]], and [[Houston]] in the United States, and in [[Belo Horizonte]], [[Brazil]].  Of these, two chose to commercialize this disco art form and operated as choreographed performance troupes:  Axis Danz in New York the FlyBoys of Flag in Texas. Many tribes continue to perform as atmosphere in clubs and at benefits worldwide.

==Flagging In Brazil==
The origins of this art in Brazil date back to [[Belo Horizonte]], a city of the state of [[Minas Gerais]], 1998 - 1999. Due to the abundance of gay festivities in the country, the culture initially spread to [[Rio de Janeiro]] and later to [[São Paulo]], [[Brasília]] and [[Florianópolis]]. Many users of social networks (Facebook, Orkut, among others) posted their photos with banners (flags) to promote and / or demonstrate the art.
There are some meetings in the park that are held to provide opportunities to practice, similar to those in the USA. Some of them even sponsored by the city (laws to encourage Culture, in Belo Horizonte). These are usually organized by art masters (flag masters) in some cities such as Belo Horizonte or São Paulo. Another city, Florianopolis, has seen an increase of flagging activities at festivals and parties since 2010. These events promote the exchange of experiences among the participants, ensuring the continued maintenance of Art and Culture with Flags on the national scene.
On July 9, 2011, the fourth Minas Gerais flaggers meeting took place in Belo Horizonte, where several members of the country participated. It is the second largest meeting of Flaggers in the world, second only to the community of the city of San Francisco, California. Currently, this art can be seen in electronic culture scenes such as Raves in various parts of the country. The flags are not necessarily manufactured by flag-makers originating in Brazil by the original flaggers, but flags still continue to enter the scene through outside sources.

==Flagger events==
Performances and conferences have begun forming in various cities, including New York, San Francisco and Dallas. Conferences and workshops happen in 2 or 3 full day events, and teach construction and techniques from beginner to advanced. A short list of leaders in the community often travel to many of these events, becoming known internationally as masters in Flag Dancing.

The Texas Flagger Weekend ran from 2003 - 2009. The event consisted of growing number of flaggers from around the world, peaking in 2008 with 80+ participants. The event had various tracks, from beginners to advanced. In later years, the Weekend expanded to include multiple tracks, a [[circuit party]] and a showcase of performances, SpinOut, of their own, inspired by the [[San Francisco]] events of the same name. The [[Texas]] Flagger Weekend was founded by Patric Nast and Phillip Bryan in [[Dallas]] in 2003.

New York hosted the "World Symposium of Fanning and Flagging" in 2005 and included movement classes, creation workshops, and performances, mostly held at [[The Center]].

Flagging In The Park (FITP), started in 1997, is a fundraising gathering of flaggers, flow artists, and their supporters, happening in the [[National AIDS Memorial Grove]] in [[Golden Gate Park]]. The event was started as a celebration of life and an honoring of those who had passed by founder Jeff Kennedy; then held by a few core members of the close-knit SF Tribe; in 2002 - 2003 the event was produced in [[Dolores Park]] by Bryan Hughes; in 2005 the event moved back to the National AIDS Memorial Grove being led by Xavier Caylor; from 2014 to the present the event is being held by a group of flaggers from the Bay Area and beyond. The basic event includes: a live DJ spinning music, a time for reflection, and hat being passed to raise money money for charity. Flaggers, [[Fan dance|Fan Dancers]], [[Poi (performance art)|Poi]], and [[Hoop dancing|Hoop dancers]] are all invited to the event. One of the five events happens the last full weekend of July, on Saturday before the [[Up Your Alley Street Fair]] on Sunday, and is advertised as the (Flagger) SF Destination Weekend. The weekend offers  a tie-dye opportunity (flag creation), FITP, and several opportunities to gather with and without flags; the other 4 dates vary - check www.flagginginthepark.org for more information.

The '''Games and Amusements Board''' ('''GAB''') ({{lang-tgl|Lupon sa mga Laro at Libangan}}) is the government-ran regulatory body of professional sports in the Philippines.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|title=Games and Amusements Board|url=http://gab.gov.ph/games-and-amusements-board/|website=Games and Amusements Board|accessdate=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Games and Amusements Board initially started its operation in 1951 with the issuance of Executive Order No. 392. Through this particular law, the powers, duties and functions previously exercised, and performed by:&lt;ref name="historical"&gt;{{cite web|title=Historical Background|publisher=Games and Amusements Board|url=http://gab.gov.ph/historical-background/|accessdate=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#the city and municipal mayors over fronton and basque pelota games
#the Boxing and Wrestling Commission over boxing and wrestling
#the [[Philippine Racing Commission]] (PRC) over horse racing, were consolidated and transferred to the Board

On March 20, 1974, the authority over horse racing was divided between the Board and the PRC.&lt;ref name="historical"/&gt;

On January 6, 1976, the scope of GAB’s regulatory function over professional sports widened as the agency was tasked to likewise supervise and regulate the professional [[basketball]] and other professional games in the country.&lt;ref name="historical"/&gt;

The Board’s regulatory function was also made more specific against anti-illegal gambling operations with the establishment of Anti-Illegal Gambling Unit (AIGU) in January 17, 1992 – which became one of GAB’s units. AIGU initially was composed of personnel appointed by the Chairman of GAB and detailed staff from the [[Philippine National Police]], the [[National Bureau of Investigation (Philippines)|National Bureau of Investigation]], the Philippine Racing Commission, the [[Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office]], other offices involved in gambling operations, as well as other law enforcement agencies in the country. On December 28, 1993, the board assumed part of the overall functions of the Gamefowl Commission, particularly insofar as international [[cockfight]] derbies are concerned.&lt;ref name="historical"/&gt;

==Leadership==
GAB, as an organization, is headed by a chairman and two commissioners&lt;ref name="historical"/&gt;

A '''graveyard slot''' (or '''death slot''') is a time period in which a [[television]] [[audience]] is very small compared to other times of the day, and therefore [[broadcast programming]] is considered far less important.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaknowall.com/gcse/gcse.php?pageID=TVsched|title=GCSE Media Studies Introduction|publisher=|accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graveyard slots are usually in the early morning hours of each day, when most people are asleep.  Because there is little likelihood of having a substantial viewing audience during this time period, providing useful [[television program]]ming during this time is usually considered unimportant; some broadcast stations go [[off the air]] during these hours, and some [[audience measurement]] systems do not collect measurements for these periods. Some broadcasters may do engineering work at this time. Others use [[broadcast automation]] to pass-through network feeds unattended, with no one outside of broadcasting authority-mandated personnel and emergency anchors/reporters present at the local station overnight. A few stations use "we're always on" or a variant to position their 24-hour operation as a promotional selling point, though as this is now the rule rather than the exception it was in the past, it has now mainly become a selling point for a station's website instead.

==Programming==

The most well-known graveyard slot in most parts of the world is the overnight television slot, after [[late night television]] and before [[breakfast television]]/[[morning show]] (between 2:00{{nbsp}}a.m. and 6:00{{nbsp}}a.m.). During this time slot, most people who are at home are asleep, and most of those who are awake are either [[Shift work|at work]], away from the television, trying to fall asleep, or [[Last call (bar term)|just returning home from a bar]] and too intoxicated to pay attention, leaving only [[insomnia]]cs, intentionally [[nocturnal]] people, and irregular shift workers as potential audiences. Because of the small number of people in those categories, the overnight shift was historically ignored as a revenue opportunity, although increases in irregular shifts have made overnight programming more viable than it had been in the past. In the United States, for example, research has shown that the number of televisions in use at 4:30{{nbsp}}a.m. doubled from 1995 to 2010 (8% to 16%).&lt;ref name="StelterNYT"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/01/business/media/01morning.html|title=TV News for Early Risers (or Late-to-Bedders)|date=1 September 2010|work=The New York Times|accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the advent of home video recording, some programs in this slot may be transmitted mainly with home taping in mind. Among these are the [[BBC]]'s Sign Zone and their former specialist service [[BBC Select]], which were for specialist audiences.&lt;ref name=BBCsign&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/accessibility/on_the_bbc/bsl_signed.shtml|title=BBC – My Web My Way – BSL programmes online|publisher=|accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC 70 years"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cain|first=John|title=The BBC: 70 years of broadcasting|year=1992|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|location=London|isbn=0-563-36750-4|pages=137 and 151}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some channels may carry adult-oriented content in the graveyard slot, although programming of a pornographic nature is restricted to subscription channels in most countries because government communications regulations forbid pornography on over-the-air channels at any time of the day.

The slot is used in the United States by some niche networks to transmit live sports such as [[cricket]], [[Nippon Professional Baseball]], [[Philippine Basketball Association]] matches, and [[Australian rules football]] from [[Australia]], [[India]], [[Japan]], the Philippines, and other nations where the American overnight is the Asian afternoon and evening. Some limited prime-time or noontime general programming from those nations is also transmitted live to the United States, and for [[anime]] sites such as [[Crunchyroll]] which have arrangements with Japanese networks to premiere episodes day-date-and-time, it can be considered that site's official primetime slot.

The United States graveyard slot is often the premiere slot for content [[Video on demand|streaming on demand]]. 12:01{{nbsp}}a.m. in the [[Pacific Time Zone]] (or 3:01{{nbsp}}a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]] and 7:01 or 8:01{{nbsp}}a.m. [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] depending on [[daylight saving time]]), where the streaming provider [[Netflix]] is based, is when that provider often releases and premieres their series and films for the first time worldwide across all time zones, along with [[Amazon Video|Amazon Prime]]. [[Hulu]] chooses to release their series at 12:01{{nbsp}}a.m. Eastern.

Since the 1980s, graveyard slots, once populated by broadcasts of [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] [[rerun]]s and old [[film|movies]], have increasingly been used for program-length [[infomercial]]s or [[simulcasting]] of [[home shopping]] channels, which provide a media outlet with revenue and a source of programming without any programming expenses or the possible malfunctions which might come with going [[off-the-air]]; the graveyard slots can also be used as dumping grounds for government-mandated [[public affairs programming]], or for station groups which are required by their parent companies to carry programming, to air those shows otherwise unpalatable in prime timeslots; for instance with [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]], a public affairs program by political commentator [[Armstrong Williams]] (who has business interests with Sinclair), ''The Right Side'', is required to be aired by all Sinclair stations, but is often seen in graveyard slots on those stations instead of its intended weekend late morning slots as many Sinclair stations choose locally instead to present educational shows and paid programming at that time. The most often seen original programming in the overnight period in the past was daytime talk shows which had failed to find an audience in their original timeslots and are being [[burning off|burned off]], though with cable networks airing the same talk shows, usually a same-day late repeat of a successful talk show or infotainment news program is now carried; this is prevalent in markets with sports teams where coach's shows and team highlight shows preempt primetime infotainment shows before primetime, allowing it to be seen in some form on a station without penalty to the syndicator.

No program that airs during an overnight graveyard slot may be counted toward the three minimum weekly hours of [[E/I|educational programming]] the U.S. government mandates stations carry each week.

In cases where a television station carries an irregularly scheduled sporting event that preempts the network prime time lineup, in many cases the station may air the preempted programming in a graveyard slot during the same broadcast day to fulfill their contractual obligations.

The [[Big Three television networks]] in the United States all offer regular programming in the overnight slot ([[World News Now|ABC]] and [[Up to the Minute|CBS]] use overnight newscasts, with an emphasis on sports scores from West Coast games that typically conclude after 1{{nbsp}}a.m. ET and international financial markets with the ending of the Australasian and beginning of the European trading day, all of which takes place between 2 and 5{{nbsp}}a.m. ET, and NBC, which dropped its [[NBC Nightside|overnight news]] in the late 1990s, replays the [[Today (U.S. TV program)#Today with Kathie Lee and Hoda|fourth hour of ''Today'']]). Each network also produces its early morning newscast at 4{{nbsp}}a.m. local time so that it may be [[broadcast delay|tape-delayed]] to air before local news. Also, since the proliferation of [[digital video recorder]]s, several cable and satellite outlets have begun airing original or rarely seen archival programming in these time slots to make them available to those recording them on DVRs (special restrictions prevent stations from using the overnight graveyard slot for [[E/I]] shows). An emerging trend in the United States is an increasingly early [[local news]]cast, which now begins as early as 4:00{{nbsp}}a.m. in some major [[media market|markets]], targeting those who work early shifts or are returning from late shifts; this early newscast would fit into the overnight daypart rather than [[breakfast television]].&lt;ref name="StelterNYT" /&gt;

The graveyard slots' lack of importance sometimes benefits programs. Producers and program-makers can afford to take more risks, as there is less [[advertising]] [[revenue]] at stake. For example, an unusual or [[niche audience|niche]] program may find a chance for an audience in a graveyard slot (a current day example is [[Adult Swim]]'s ''[[FishCenter Live]]'', which features games projected onto the video image of an [[aquarium]]), or a formerly popular program that no longer merits an important time slot may be allowed to run in a graveyard slot instead of being removed from the schedule completely. However, abusing this practice may lead to [[channel drift]] if the demoted programs were presented as channel stars at some time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2008/01/21/tv-101-channel-drift-or-what-the-hell-happened-to-aande/ |title=TV 101: Channel Drift (or, what the hell happened to A&amp;E?) |publisher=Tvsquad.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another thing to note is the prevalence of cheaply produced local advertisements which allow an advertiser to purchase time on the station for a low cost, advertisements for services of a sexual nature (such as [[Premium-rate telephone number|premium-rate adult rate entertainment services]] and [[sex toy|adult products]] from companies such as [[Adam &amp; Eve (company)|Adam &amp; Eve]]), and [[public service announcements]] airing in this time slot due to the reduced importance of advertising revenue.

Up until 2014, some cable networks would broadcast educational programing that educators can tape as part of [[Cable in the Classroom]] during these hours.

==Examples==
{{original research|date=September 2018}}
===Japan===
Japanese over-the-air stations broadcast [[late night anime]] almost exclusively, starting in the [[Late night television]] slot at 11:00{{nbsp}}p.m., but bridging the graveyard slot and running until 4:00{{nbsp}}a.m.. Because advertising revenue is scant in these time slots, the broadcasts primarily promote DVD versions of their series, which may be longer, uncensored, and/or have added features like commentary tracks, side stories and epilogues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2011/11/19-1/japans-anime-broadcast-ethics-complaints-for-october-2011 |title=Japan's Anime Broadcast Ethics Complaints for October 2011 |publisher=Crunchyroll.com |date=2011-11-19 |accessdate=2011-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, overnight is from 12:30{{nbsp}}a.m. to 6:00{{nbsp}}a.m..
 
[[BBC One]] showed ''Sign Zone'' from 2000 to 2013 during this time before simulcasting with [[BBC World News]] (in a 3 way simulcast between [[BBC One]], [[BBC News Channel]] and [[BBC World News]] for the second part). Nowadays, ''BBC World News'' comes on usually after midnight or 1{{nbsp}}a.m. depending on which films or programmes are broadcast usually followed by Weather for the week ahead [[BBC Two]] shows ''Sign Zone'' and repeats for the first part and then either closes down which is marked in schedules as "This is BBC Two" [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] shows ''[[Jackpot247]]'' (''After Midnight'' on [[STV (TV channel)|STV]]; ''Teleshopping'' on [[UTV (TV channel)|UTV]]) and then a repeats before showing [[ITV Nightscreen]] until 5:05 am on weekdays followed by ''[[The Jeremy Kyle Show]]'', and 6{{nbsp}}a.m. at the weekend. [[Channel 4]] shows repeats and films during these hours apart from Wednesdays where sports including, Motor Racing, Triathlon and Beach Volleyball are shown. During the [[National Football League]] season for [[Gridiron football|American football]], the American [[NBC]]'s ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]'' game, along with playoff games and the [[Super Bowl]], are carried live, which is often also the case with other popular American sports airing in primetime in the UK on [[Sky Sports]] and [[BT Sport]]. [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] shows ''Supercasino'' and some repeats. Most digital channels during this time either go off air or show simulcast with shopping channels and some stay on the air. [[BBC News Channel]] simulcasts with [[BBC World News]] during these hours.

===United States===
Examples of graveyard slots in the United States, outside of the traditional overnight slots, include:
; Weekdays, noon Eastern: This time slot became a "death slot" for network programming as local midday news became more popular in the 1970s. [[CBS]] still offers an option for affiliates to air ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' at noon Eastern, mainly so that Central Time Zone affiliates can air [[local news]] at noon CT; but actual participation in this varies by individual station. Local news in this slot usually consists of the morning newscast's stories repeated with spare updating, [[Agriculture|farm report]]s in mainly rural markets, and community interest segments where organizations are highlighted in an interview setting, along with paid placement [[advertorial]] segments for businesses. Stations that do not carry news in this slot usually air syndicated fare or an infomercial; in numerous cases, [[E/I|educational programs]] can be buried in this slot or any other daytime slot as a form of [[malicious compliance]] with the mandate for such programs. Prior to the 1970s, this slot was a popular "lunch slot", and shows such as ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' were popular in the time slot.
; Weekdays, 4{{nbsp}}p.m. Eastern: When the noon time slot became unfavorable in the late 1970s, networks began doubling up airings of their noon shows at 4{{nbsp}}p.m.. Increases in syndication during the early 1980s led to networks having fewer and fewer affiliates in this time slot as well, and eventually all networks abandoned regularly programming the slot by 1986 (incidentally the same year ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' debuted; Oprah soon came to dominate the time slot), and until 1996, occasional [[afterschool special]]s for children. Since the 1990s, the expansion of local television news has led to stations without major syndicated hits choosing to offer [[local news]] in this hour. By 2012, most networks' daytime programming had ended at 3{{nbsp}}p.m. Eastern, and many stations have begun offering up to three hours of local news, interrupted either by a 4:30 syndicated program or the 6:30 network news.
; [[Friday night death slot]]: In the late 1970s and into the 1980s, several television series emerged that became widely popular among the viewing audiences (such as ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'', ''[[Falcon Crest]]'', and ''[[Miami Vice]]''), and most programs that were scheduled against them were doomed to cancellation because of the competition, which marked the beginning of a phenomenon known as the "Friday night death slot."&lt;ref name="phillips"&gt;Katherine Phillips. "Witty sitcoms scheduled in '''Friday night death slot'''," ''Richmond Times-Dispatch'', March 28, 1986, page 46: ''"ABC is sending two of this season's brightest new sitcoms to certain death at the hands of J.R. Ewing and his ''Dallas'' clan."''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Note: In the 1980s refs, it sounds like the "death" is due to the opposition on that night, not the night itself. --&gt;&lt;ref name="voorhees"&gt;John Voorhees. "ABC reshuffles schedule for ratings but deals only two new shows," ''The Seattle Times'', December 13, 1985, page C5: "''Also being dropped is ''Our Family Honor,'' the ABC series that has had the distinction of being the lowest-rated Nielsen show almost every week since its debut. It is in the '''Friday night death slot''' of 10&amp;nbsp;pm, against ''Miami Vice'' and ''Falcon Crest.''''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spenser"&gt;Knight-Ridder News Service. 'Family Honor' ditched for 'Spenser', ''Lexington Herald-Leader'' (KY), October 19, 1985, page C6: ''"''Spenser: For Hire,'' the above-par detective series starring Robert Urich, is being moved out of the '''Friday-night death slot''' opposite ''Miami Vice'' and ''Falcon Crest.'' ... To make room for "Spenser," ABC is taking "Our Family Honor" off the air [Tuesdays], at least for a while and perhaps permanently.''&lt;/ref&gt; Fewer viewers stayed home to watch television on Friday nights beginning in the mid-1990s, particularly those in the much-sought after 18–49 demographic, which prompted a revival of the phrase in a new context in that a series on Friday was still more likely to lose money and lag in viewership compared to shows on other nights, regardless of its direct competition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A408213 News: Election 2006], ''The Austin Chronicle''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Goodman | first = Tim | title = Saturday night is dead, yes, but Friday, too? |work=San Francisco Chronicle | pages = E1 | date = October 10, 2007| url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/10/09/DDSNSN1BE.DTL | accessdate =February 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, with [[media conglomerate]]s now owning both television networks and film studios, the former must downplay programming by corporate demand to attract moviegoers to theaters on the traditional opening night for major films. As such, programs that air on Friday nights tend to lag behind in viewership compared to those on other weeknights, and networks have since programmed inexpensive [[reality television|reality programming]] or [[news magazine]]s in this slot instead of scripted programs. Scripted programs that end up in Friday night slots have often been moved there from more lucrative Monday-Thursday evening time slots due to poor performance, and this is often an indication that the series is facing cancellation. This was the case with ABC's ''[[8 Simple Rules]]'' in 2004{{ndash}}05, and Fox's ''[['Til Death]]'' in 2009{{ndash}}10 (the latter show kept alive in that time slot to garner enough episodes for [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]]).&lt;br&gt;Since 2005, CBS is the only major network that continues to air a full line-up of first-run scripted programming on Fridays, and has become successful with this time slot in the last 15 years. [[The CW]] has also maintained an entire primetime schedule of scripted programs since 2010, with similar success.&lt;br&gt;Despite being a known graveyard slot, there have been notable exceptions to this rule, such as ''[[The Brady Bunch]]'', ''[[Sanford and Son]]'', ''[[Full House]]'', ''[[Homicide: Life on the Street]]'', ''[[Reba (TV series)|Reba]]'', ''[[Numb3rs]]'', ''[[Ghost Whisperer]]'', ''[[CSI: NY]]'', and ''[[Shark Tank]]''. In addition, a handful of cable channels have also had success with Friday night programming. This includes [[USA Network]], which had a lineup of original programming on Friday evenings from 2002 to 2010 featuring ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]'' as the lineup's centerpiece, and [[Disney Channel]], which since 2006 has successfully maintained a schedule of largely scripted Friday night programming which appeals to pre-teens and young teenagers (including series such as ''[[Wizards of Waverly Place]]'', ''[[Phineas &amp; Ferb]]'', ''[[The Suite Life on Deck]]'', ''[[Jessie (2011 TV series)|Jessie]]'' and most recently ''[[Girl Meets World]]''). Original made-for-TV movies occasionally premiere in the slot several times per year as an attempt to keep potential movie-goers at home. [[ABC Television|ABC]] had notable success on Friday evenings with its ''[[TGIF (ABC)|TGIF]]'' lineup beginning in 1989, but the time slot's ratings began to wane in the late 1990s. ABC made another attempt at Friday success in the 2012{{ndash}}13 season, moving the family-oriented [[Tim Allen]] sitcom ''[[Last Man Standing (U.S. TV series)|Last Man Standing]]'' to Fridays for its sophomore season. Despite this move, the show's ratings held steady from the previous season, when it aired on Tuesdays, and continued to air Fridays for another five seasons.

; Weekend afternoons: Particularly when no sporting events are airing, there is very little incentive to watch television after Saturday morning news programs or [[Sunday morning talk shows]] end, especially with [[National Football League|NFL]] or [[college football]], where most stations refuse outright to put on competitive programming if a local team is playing on another station carrying that game. Most stations air infomercials, movies, or little-watched syndicated fare in this slot. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] airs reality television reruns in the late afternoon slot.
; Saturday nights: Until the 1990s, many popular series aired on Saturdays, including CBS series such as ''[[Have Gun - Will Travel]]'', '' [[All in the Family]]'', ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', ''[[The Bob Newhart Show]]'', ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'', ''[[Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman]]'', ''[[Early Edition]]'' and ''[[Walker, Texas Ranger]]'', as well as [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Golden Girls]]'' and its numerous spin-offs, and most networks maintained a full schedule (though the night was also often used for airing movies). However, in the past decade a similar situation to Friday nights has emerged, with fewer viewers in front of a TV set. The last major efforts to program Saturday nights ended in 2001, when CBS [[Cancellation (television)|canceled]] ''Walker, Texas Ranger'' and NBC failed with the [[XFL]]. Thus, since 2004, the mainstream U.S. networks have largely abandoned original programming on Saturday nights in favor of reruns and sports coverage (with the exception of CBS, which continues a limited first-run presence with ''[[48 Hours (TV series)|48 Hours Mystery]]'' and ''[[Ransom (TV series)|Ransom]]''). In recent years, a new trend has emerged where a show that is considered to be a ratings failure (or is already canceled) is moved to Saturday nights to [[burning off|finish airing its original episodes]]. Examples include NBC's ''[[Crusoe (TV series)|Crusoe]]'' and the [[CBS]] miniseries ''[[Harper's Island]]'' in 2008{{ndash}}09, CBS's ''[[Three Rivers (TV series)|Three Rivers]]'' and ABC's ''[[The Forgotten (TV series)|The Forgotten]]'' in 2009{{ndash}}10, NBC's ''[[Outlaw (TV series)|Outlaw]]'' and ''[[Chase (2010 TV series)|Chase]]'' and CBS's ''[[Chaos (TV series)|Chaos]]'' in 2010{{ndash}}11, and CBS's ''[[How to Be a Gentleman]]'' and NBC's ''[[The Firm (2012 TV series)|The Firm]]'' in 2011{{ndash}}12. Despite being a known graveyard slot, some channels have gained or maintained success in the Saturday night slot. Such exceptions include [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]], which has successfully aired a Saturday primetime lineup of first-run programming aimed at pre-teens and teenagers since August 1992 (which has included popular series such as ''[[Clarissa Explains It All]]'', ''[[All That]]'', ''[[Kenan &amp; Kel]]'', ''[[iCarly]]'', and ''[[Victorious]]''), and [[Syfy]], which has had respectable success with made-for-TV movies that regularly air during Saturday primetime.
; Early weekend mornings (prior to 7{{nbsp}}a.m.): Because people generally stay out later on Friday and Saturday nights than other nights of the week, people also tend to sleep in longer on weekend mornings. The weekend morning 5{{snd}}7{{nbsp}}a.m. time slot is the most common time for stations to air public affairs and (on Sundays) [[televangelism]] programs.
; Sunday nights, 7{{snd}}8{{nbsp}}p.m. and 10{{snd}}11{{nbsp}}p.m.: Because of overruns from [[National Football League]] (NFL) games, [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] (in the earlier slot) and, to a lesser extent, CBS (in the latter slot) have had difficulty launching shows in these time slots. Fox and CBS both use different strategies to handle overruns, with other networks attempting various means of [[counterprogramming]] to meet parity on the night:
*Fox would preempt its programming in the early time slot if an NFL game overran its time slot, often to the frustration of fans of series such as ''[[King of the Hill]]'' and ''[[Malcolm in the Middle]]'', who often had episodes joined in progress or unseen in the Eastern or Central time zones until summer reruns after games ended. Fox has since addressed the issue by clearing out the time slot completely for an NFL [[post-game show]] titled ''The OT'' during the NFL regular season and setting aside a portion for short-run animated series under its ''[[Animation Domination]]'' (later ''[[Sunday Funday (block)|Sunday Funday]]'') block, though mid-season replacement series have still had problems finding an audience in the time slot. 
*CBS protects its acclaimed newsmagazine ''[[60 Minutes]]'' by delaying its entire [[prime time]] [[broadcast programming]] schedule if a game overruns, resulting in the show scheduled for the 10{{nbsp}}p.m. slot being pushed well past its original start time and occasionally being bumped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/cbs-tackles-topic-nfl-overruns-hurt-sunday-lineup-good-wife-mentalist-article-1.1124441|title = CBS tackles topic of NFL overruns &amp; whether they hurt Sunday lineup of 'Good Wife,' 'Mentalist'|date = 30 July 2012|accessdate = 12 January 2015|last = Hinckley|first = David|publisher = New York Dally News}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBS also attempted to stabilize the 10{{nbsp}}p.m. slot by moving its established series ''[[CSI: Miami]]'' from its original Monday night slot to Sunday nights instead of trying to launch a new show in the usually troublesome slot; ''CSI: Miami'' was nonetheless canceled after two seasons in its Sunday time slot, and as of 2018, the last show of the evening, ''[[Madam Secretary (TV series)|Madam Secretary]]'' is pre-empted occasionally if a game runs long to allow local newscasts to air.
*ABC has carried ''[[America's Funniest Home Videos]]'' in the early time slot for most of its history, a relatively low-cost and low-risk program popular for family viewing. ABC has had somewhat greater success later in the evening with scripted dramas (e.g. ''[[The Practice]]'' and ''[[Brothers &amp; Sisters (TV series)|Brothers &amp; Sisters]]''). 
*NBC holds the ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]'' contract that takes up the entire night during the fall and early winter, and carries the pre-game show ''[[Football Night in America]]'' within the 7 p.m.-8 p.m. timeslot, which uses a carousel reporting format to cover early games before NFL action ends, and then transitions to a quick rundown of all games before focusing on the upcoming game within the last twenty minutes before the game starts. After their NFL coverage ends in mid-January, NBC counts on carrying ''[[Dateline NBC]]'' in the slot during the NFL offseason (in the 90's NBC attempted to compete full-force with ''60 Minutes'' with a string of unsuccessful hard newsmagazines before relying on the lighter or [[true crime]]-focused ''Dateline''). 
*[[The CW]] (and in the past [[The WB]]) has had varied scheduling strategies since the network's 1995 launch involving Sunday evenings. From 1995 until 2001, The WB aired new programming (usually sitcoms) in the 7 p.m. slot, and then from 2001 until 2007, aired encore programming (''[[7th Heaven (TV series)|Seventh Heaven]]'', ''[[Gilmore Girls]]'' and ''[[Reba (TV series)|Reba]]'') under the secondary titles ''Beginnings'' and ''Easy View''. In the 2007-08 season it featured [[advertorial]] entertainment programs (''[[CW Now]]'' and ''[[Online Nation]]'') widely considered a failure, with sitcom repeats returning to the slot after the Super Bowl. In 2008-09, the slot carried ''[[In Harm's Way (TV series)|In Harm's Way]]'', a reality series from the timeslot's lessee ([[Media Rights Capital]]) also considered a failure, and after that year, the CW returned Sunday evenings to their affiliates, leaving the night completely until returning in 2018-19. It decided in that schedule form to not program the 7 p.m. slot, starting their programming at 8 p.m. to avert programming around football.
*[[UPN]] generally never programmed Sunday nights, with its only contribution to the night being lower-tier [[XFL]] football games on Sunday evenings during the league's only season in its first iteration. Its ''de facto'' successor [[MyNetworkTV]] has never programmed the night.
; Opposite popular annual programming specials: Programs such as the [[Academy Awards]], [[Super Bowl]], and the [[Olympic Games]]; as well as seasonal airings of popular classic films such as ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', have been known to draw so many viewers that almost all efforts to [[counterprogramming|counterprogram]] against them have failed. As such, broadcasters have traditionally countered these events with either reruns or movies. The [[Super Bowl counterprogramming|Super Bowl]] has historically attracted more unusual fare (such as [[Animal Planet]]'s ''[[Puppy Bowl]]'', a football-themed special consisting of [[puppy|puppies]] at play),&lt;ref name="PB"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/02/arts/television/02bark.html|title='Just Fine as Tackles, but They Can’t Pass |last=Ryzik|first=Melena|date=February 2, 2008|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; with most aiming to counter the halftime show to emulate Fox's success with its live ''[[In Living Color]]'' special in 1992. However, as all four major commercial networks now have some tie to the [[National Football League]]'s television deals (with all but ABC alternating to air the game), major networks have aired little to no new original programming on the night of the Super Bowl under an unsaid [[gentleman's agreement]].&lt;ref name="trib-goalofspectacle"&gt;{{cite news|title=Goal of spectacle colors NFL's thinking about Super Bowl halftime show|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-02-06/business/ct-biz-0206-rosenthal--20110206_1_super-halftime-party-doritos-zaptime-halftime-show|publisher=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=30 January 2013|date=February 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
; Opposite dominant television series: On occasion, a regularly scheduled program may have this kind of dominant drawing power. Notable examples included NBC's ''[[The Cosby Show]]'' for most of the mid- and late-1980s, ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' during its peak in the second half of the 1990s (at the time when NBC's [[Must See TV|Thursday primetime schedule]] represented the [[List of most watched television broadcasts|most watched television programs]] of the decade), and Fox's ''[[American Idol]]'' during its peak in the mid-2000s and early 2010s (at the peak of [[reality television]] in the U.S. during those decades) - each of which was dubbed a "Death Star" by the other networks because of the show's consistent ability to dominate the ratings.

===Australia and New Zealand===
In Australia and New Zealand, overnight is from midnight to 06:00, and this slot generally consists of American sitcoms and dramas which ended up failing in their home market but need [[burning off|to air in some form]] to justify the network's investment, or archived content, along with [[infomercial|teleshopping]] programs, lower-tier American syndicated newsmagazines, and American [[breakfast television]] programmes delayed to fill the remainder of the slot.

==Content requirements==

In [[Television in Canada|Canada]], federal regulations require television channels and radio stations to carry a certain percentage of [[Canadian content]] (or Cancon). It is common for most privately owned television channels to air the bulk of their Cancon in such graveyard slots (especially weekday mornings and Saturday nights), ensuring they can meet their required percentages of Canadian programming while leaving room for more popular foreign programming in other time periods. For over-the-air [[terrestrial television]] stations, the overnight hours are generally ''not'' subject to [[Canadian content]] requirements, allowing some opportunity for niche or experimental programming during those hours, although most commonly infomercials air instead. Canadian radio stations have similar practices regarding broadcasts of Canadian music, known pejoratively as the "[[beaver hour]]". For the most part in modern times however, Cancon requirements are filled easily by television stations throughout the week through local newscasts and magazine programming, along with licensed versions of American programs such as ''[[ET Canada]]''.

Likewise, in the [[United States]], some stations attempt to bury mandated [[E/I]] [[educational television]] programming in graveyard slots, though under current regulations by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC), [[Children's television series]] must air during times when children are awake (current standards state between 7:00{{nbsp}}a.m. and 10:00{{nbsp}}p.m.). Thus, these channels will "bury" E/I programs in the middle of a block of [[infomercial]]s during [[daytime television]] hours, when most children are at school and are unlikely to ever see them.

'''''Horror Express''''' ('''''Pánico en el Transiberiano''''' in Spain and also known as '''''Panic on the Trans-Siberian Express'''''),&lt;ref name=Gordon2013/&gt; is a 1972 Spanish-British [[science fiction film|science fiction]]-[[horror film]], produced by [[Bernard Gordon (writer)|Bernard Gordon]] and Gregorio Sacristan, directed by [[Eugenio Martín]], that stars [[Christopher Lee]], [[Peter Cushing]], [[Alberto de Mendoza]], [[Silvia Tortosa]], and [[Telly Savalas]]. The screenplay was written by [[Arnaud d'Usseau]] and Julian Zimet (credited as Julian Halevy). 

==Plot==
In 1906, Saxton (Lee), a renowned British [[anthropology|anthropologist]], is returning to Europe by the [[Trans-Siberian Express]] from China to Moscow. With him is a crate containing the frozen remains of a primitive humanoid creature that he discovered in a cave in [[Manchuria]]. He hopes it is a [[Transitional fossil#Missing_links|missing link]] in [[human evolution]]. Doctor Wells ([[Peter Cushing]]), Saxton's friendly rival and Royal Geological Society colleague, is also on board but travelling separately. Before the train departs Shanghai, a thief is found dead on the platform. His eyes are completely white, without irises or pupils, and a bystander initially mistakes him for a blind man. A Catholic monk named Father Pujardov ([[Alberto de Mendoza]]), the spiritual advisor to the Polish Count Marion Petrovski ([[George Rigaud]]) and Countess Irina Petrovski ([[Silvia Tortosa]]), who are also waiting to board the train, proclaims the contents of the crate to be evil. Saxton furiously dismisses this as superstition. Saxton's eagerness to keep his scientific find secret arouses the suspicion of Wells, who bribes a porter to investigate the crate. The porter is killed by the defrosted humanoid (Juan Olaguivel) within. It then escapes the crate by picking the lock.

The humanoid finds more victims as it roams the moving train. Each is found with the same opaque, white eyes. Autopsies suggest that the brains of the victims are being drained of memories and knowledge. When the humanoid is gunned down by police Inspector Mirov ([[Julio Peña]]), the threat seems to have been eliminated. Saxton and Wells discover that external images are retained by a liquid found inside the corpses' eyeballs, which reveal a prehistoric Earth and a planetary view as seen from space. They deduce that the real threat is somehow a formless extraterrestrial that inhabited the body of the humanoid and now resides inside the inspector. Pujardov, sensing the greater presence within the inspector and believing it to be that of [[Satan]], renounces his faith, pledging allegiance to the entity.

News of the murders is wired to the Russian authorities. An intimidating [[Cossack]] officer, Captain Kazan ([[Telly Savalas]]), boards with a handful of his men. Kazan believes the train is transporting rebels; he is only convinced of the alien's existence when Saxton switches off the lights and Mirov's eyes glow, revealing him to be the alien's host. It has absorbed the memories of Wells' assistant, a train engineer, and others aboard, and now seeks the Polish count's metallurgical knowledge in order to build a vessel to escape Earth. Kazan shoots and kills Mirov, and the alien transfers itself to the deranged Pujardov.

The passengers flee to the freight car while Pujardov murders Kazan, his men, and the count, draining all of their memories. Saxton rescues the countess and holds Pujardov at gunpoint. Saxton, having discovered that bright light prevents the alien from draining minds or transferring to another body, forces Pujardov into a brightly lit area. The alien Pujardov explains that it is a collective form of energy from another galaxy. Trapped on Earth in the distant past after being left behind in an accident, it survived for millions of years in the bodies of [[protozoa]], fish, and other animals. It cannot live outside a living being longer than a few moments. The alien begs to be spared, tempting Saxton with its advanced knowledge of technology and cures for diseases. While Saxton is distracted by the offer, the alien resurrects the count's corpse and attacks him with it.

Saxton and the countess flee, but the alien resurrects all of its victims as [[zombie]]s. Battling their way through the train, Saxton and the countess eventually reach the [[caboose]] where the other survivors have taken refuge. Saxton and Wells work desperately to uncouple the caboose from the rest of the train. The Russian government sends a telegram to a dispatch station ahead, instructing them to destroy the train by sending it down a dead-end spur. Speculating that war has broken out, the station staff switch the track points.

The alien takes control of the train as it enters the spur. Saxton and Wells finally manage to separate the caboose. The alien tries to find the brakes but fails to slow down the train. It rams through the end of spur barrier and plunges down the deep cliff and is destroyed after it hits bottom. The caboose rolls precariously to the end of the track before stopping, inches away from the cliff. The survivors quickly leave, while Saxton, Wells, and the countess gaze over the ravine and witness an inferno engulfing the train and its unearthly inhabitant.

== Production ==
''Horror Express'' was filmed in [[Madrid]] between 1971 and 1972 and produced on a low budget of $300,000 with the luxury of having three familiar genre actors in the lead roles. The film was co-produced by American screenwriter/producer [[Bernard Gordon (writer)|Bernard Gordon]], who had collaborated with Martin on the 1972 film ''[[Pancho Villa (film)|Pancho Villa]]'' (which featured Savalas in the title role). 

Filming started December 1971.&lt;ref&gt;'Coyle' Next for Monash
Murphy, Mary. Los Angeles Times 10 Dec 1971: j26. &lt;/ref&gt;

Rumors that the train sets were acquired from the production of ''[[Doctor Zhivago (film)|Doctor Zhivago]]''&lt;ref name=Gordon2013/&gt; (or ''[[Nicholas and Alexandra]]'')&lt;ref name=Fangoria/&gt; were refuted by Gordon, who said in a 2000 interview that the model had been constructed for ''Pancho Villa''.&lt;ref name=Gordoninterview/&gt; Filmmakers used the mock-up from ''Pancho Villa'' as the interior for all train cars during production since no further room was available on stage. All scenes within each train car were shot consecutively, the set then modified and shot for the next car.&lt;ref name=Gordoninterview/&gt; The train's departure scene was filmed in Madrid's [[Railway Museum (Madrid)|Delicias railway station]]. The locomotive which pulls the train in that scene is a [[Renfe Operadora|RENFE]] 141F, but later in the film, the locomotive seems to be an unidentified RENFE locomotive whose wheel arrangement is unclear.

Securing Lee and Cushing was a coup for Gordon, since it lent an atmosphere reminiscent of [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer Films]], many of which starred both of the actors. When Cushing arrived in Madrid to begin work on the picture, however, he was still distraught over the recent death of his wife, and announced to Gordon that he could not do the film. With Gordon desperate over the idea of losing one of his important stars, Lee stepped in and put Cushing at ease simply by talking to his old friend about some of their previous work together. Cushing changed his mind and stayed on.&lt;ref name=Gordoninterview/&gt;

Like all the Italian and Spanish films of the period, ''Horror Express'' was filmed mostly without sound, with effects and voices dubbed into the film later. Lee, Cushing and Savalas all provided their own voices for the English market.&lt;ref name=linernotes/&gt;

== Release and reception ==
The film generally received mixed reviews. On the [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a 57% approval rating with an average rating of 6.6 out of 10, based on seven reviews.&lt;ref name=RottenTom/&gt;

This film was first titled ''Pánico en el Transiberiano'' and first released as an officially selected film of the 1972 [[Sitges Film Festival]].&lt;ref name=sitgesff/&gt; Director Eugenio Martín won the Critic's Award Best Script for this film.&lt;ref name=sitgesff2/&gt; According to Martín, his native country of Spain was where the film fared worst, both critically and in terms of box office revenue.&lt;ref name=linernotes/&gt; The film was received more positively in other markets where the audience was more familiar with low-budget horror films, such as Great Britain, the United States, and Australia.

''[[Montgomery Advertiser]]'' film critic Jery Tillotson gave the film a positive review, writing, "Good performances, brisk direction, and fast action moves this thriller a notch above the average shocker".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/257530902/?terms=%22horror+express%22|title=24 Feb 1974, 52 - The Montgomery Advertiser at Newspapers.com|publisher=Newspapers.com|access-date=11 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A special edition [[Blu-Ray]]/[[DVD]] release of the film was issued in 2011 by [[Severin Films]].&lt;ref name=dreadctrl/&gt;

'''ImPulsTanz Vienna International Dance Festival''' is a major [[contemporary dance]] [[festival]] held in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]] each year. It gathers thousands of professional dancers, choreographers and teachers for a five-week program of performance, research projects and workshops. It was started by Karl Regensburger and [[choreography|choreographer]] Ismael Ivo in 1984 as the "Internationale Tanzwochen Wien" with dance teachers including Joe Alegado, [[Germaine Acogny]] and Walter Raines.

In 1988 it took the name "ImPulsTanz Vienna International Dance Festival" with works by Wim Vandekeybus, [[Marie Chouinard]] and [[Mark Tompkins (dancer)|Mark Tompkins]].

It set up [[danceWEB Europe]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dancewebeurope.net/ danceWeb-Europe]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1996, initially as a scholarship program and now facilitating sharing ideas and knowledge, further training and gathering renowned artists

In the history of '''LGBT theatre in Singapore''', it was only in the second half of the 1980s that gay writers started to explore the hitherto taboo area of homosexuality in their works. The licensing authority, however, was not quite ready so that in 1988, three plays with gay themes were banned from being performed. These were [[Eleanor Wong (playwright)|Eleanor Wong]]'s ''Jackson on a Jaunt'', [[Chay Yew]]'s ''As If He Hears'' and [[Russell Heng]]'s ''Lest The Demons Get To Me''. The first two plays were subsequently staged in 1989/1990 after negotiations with the authority. The third was staged in 1992 after Singapore's culture policy was liberalised by its new Prime Minister, [[Goh Chok Tong]].

The following are some of the local theatre productions which have featured [[cross-dressing]] or [[LGBT]] themes:

==Before 2003==

===M Butterfly===

''[[M Butterfly]]'' is an internationally acclaimed theatre piece by [[Chinese-American]] playwright [[David Hwang]] about a [[transvestism|transvestite]] male [[opera]] star’s deceptive seduction of an unsuspecting [[France|French]] male [[diplomat]] in [[China]]. It was staged during the 1990 [[Singapore Arts Festival]] in the wake of the proscription of three gay-themed plays just two years earlier, probably to symbolise newly appointed Prime Minister [[Goh Chok Tong]]'s vision of a "kinder and gentler Singapore". It also marked the first instance of total [[nudity]] in Singapore theatre. The impact was heightened by the local media which, habitually sensitised to the political climate, highlighted members of the political élite seated in the front row taking in the spectacle with cultured nonchalance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://inkpot.com/theatre/99reviews/99revmbutt.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-03-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060323134057/http://inkpot.com/theatre/99reviews/99revmbutt.html |archivedate=2006-03-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Gunung Sayang Association's Peranakan plays===

The [[matriarch]] in most of Gunung Sayang Association's [[Peranakan]] plays is played by a man, akin to theatre in [[Shakespeare]]an times. [[Nyonya]] women were not encouraged to perform in front of an audience.

The most popular male cross-dressing matriarch to have performed in these plays was [[GT Lye]], whose baju panjangs were made by Aljunied Brothers at [[Arab Street]].

[[Kenny Chan]] is a comedic performer from [[Melaka]] who has also played the matriarch role and is known for what some consider rather crude stand-up comedy acts. Chan was most recently seen as Romeo in the [[MediaCorp TV12|TV12]] series, ''The Ways of the Matriarch''.

Examples of [[Peranakan]] plays which featured a male cross-dressing matriarch include:&lt;ref&gt;http://stangee.blogspot.com/2005/09/wayang-peranakan_09.html&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Menyesal'' - Regret
*''Buang Keroh, Pungot Jernih'' - Let bygones be bygones
*''Zaman Sekarang'' - These modern times

==2003==

===Invitation to Treat===
''Invitation to Treat'' was a month-long [[trilogy]] of plays performed at the [[Jubilee Hall, Singapore|Jubilee Hall]], [[Raffles Hotel]] in April 2003. They were penned by acclaimed playwright and academic lawyer [[Eleanor Wong (playwright)|Eleanor Wong]] and produced by [[W!LD RICE]], a professional theatre company founded by well-regarded Artistic Director [[Ivan Heng]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fridae.com/newsfeatures/article.php?articleid=816&amp;viewarticle=1&lt;/ref&gt;

The three plays of ''Invitation To Treat'' spanned 20 years in the life of their protagonist, Ellen Toh, following her journey towards self-discovery and [[self-actualisation]]. She was a smart, ambitious and hardworking lesbian lawyer who married her best friend in a 'marriage of convenience' that presented her with the best of both worlds– a socially respectable position, and a husband who accepted her sexual orientation.

The plays swept the audience along a unique and enjoyable journey, an [[Odyssey]] of insights which recounted the story of one member of an invisible minority who struggled with her [[homosexuality|sexuality]] and, over time, grew increasingly confident and self-aware, with more than a little help from her friends. Heng hoped that the [[LGBT]] community would relate to the plays which included 'insider' jokes and references that could only be fully appreciated by the gay community, with scripts that were not dumbed down to accommodate a straight audience. Owing to its [[lesbian]] theme, the producers experienced great difficulty in securing a corporate sponsor.

''Mergers &amp; Accusations'' and ''Wills &amp; Secession'' ran as a double bill from 2 to 6 April 2003.
*''Mergers &amp; Accusations''. Examined personal choices and living in transition while dreaming of, hoping for, and wanting, the 'perfect' future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://inkpot.com/theatre/01reviews/01revmergaccuwillsece2.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-03-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060323133437/http://inkpot.com/theatre/01reviews/01revmergaccuwillsece2.html |archivedate=2006-03-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Wills &amp; Secession''. Explored the corridors of the past, and unravelled the bonds of family and faith in the face of disease and death.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wildrice.com.sg/articles/pr030122.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Jointly &amp; Severably''. World-premièred from 9 to 26 April 2003, the play laid bare the struggle for commitment, exploded the meaning of family, love and friendship, and the right of a minority to live and love honestly and fearlessly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://inkpot.com/theatre/03reviews/03revinvitreajoinseve2.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-03-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060315175447/http://inkpot.com/theatre/03reviews/03revinvitreajoinseve2.html |archivedate=2006-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2004==

=== Private Parts===
The play ''Private Parts'' was premiered at the 1992 [[Singapore Arts Festival]], generating a buzz that lasted well past its two sell-out seasons, both during the festival and its immediate rerun, when it played to an estimated audience of 20,000.

Many felt that ''Private Parts'' was popular playwright [[Michael Chiang]]’s best play to date; definitely, it was his most politicised. The man who defined Singapore comedy with runaway hits like ''[[Army Daze]], [[Beauty World (musical)|Beauty World]]'' and ''Mixed Signals'', surprised many with this pointed yet poignant piece of writing.

Pushing the envelope the way no other local production had ever done, ''Private Parts'' was a play many agree was ahead of its time. One gets involved with a talk-show host who soon finds out the true meaning of reality TV. One gets a glimpse of the brutality of media competition: how far would one go for higher ratings? Plus, for a nation of gawkers weaned on the night-time beauties of [[Bugis Street]] back in the 60s, here was an up-close peek into that mysterious world of [[drag queen]]s. What more could one want from theatre in the rigid, pre-RA days of Singapore?

Hype aside, ''Private Parts'' made news because it was able to engross even the most conservative of audiences with its bittersweet (and unexpectedly moving) story about 3 [[transsexual]]s trying to find their place in life. Way before [[Hollywood]] was fêted for daring to do the same by putting [[Terence Stamp]], [[Guy Pearce]] and [[Hugo Weaving]] in heels and makeup for ''[[Priscilla, Queen of the Desert]]'' (1994). Not to mention [[Patrick Swayze]], [[Wesley Snipes]] and [[John Leguizamo]] donning even bigger bouffants and bosoms in ''To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything'' (1995).

The story: Briefly, a [[Star Search]] winner fronts a current-affairs talk show to improve ratings. His life turns upside down when he ends up in a sex-change clinic with 3 [[transsexual]]s. After befriending them, he tries to get them on his show.

Private Parts proved to be such an audience favourite that it was revived in 1995 for another run, this time including a Mandarin version (which starred [[Edmund Chen]] and the late comedian [[Hua Liang]]) as well.

And 12 years on, [[Michael Chiang]]’s much-acclaimed play returned to the Singapore stage for a limited season. The new, updated production had its run at the Esplanade Theatre from 28 July to 1 August 2004.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/print/97889/1/.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==2005==

===Boxing Cabaret===
A unique one-woman show on 17 and 18 June 2005 by [[Parinya Charoenphol]], also familiarly known in [[Thai language|Thai]] as Nong Thoom. The famous former [[Muay Thai]] ([[kickboxing]]) champion who stunned the world with her [[gender]] change invited the audience into her colourful world where strength meets beauty, fight meets dance and heart meets mind.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sistic.com.sg/SOPApp/SOPPortal/portal_proxy?uri=,Vz1r!j,3H6Bt2Z4vNL5NaT7m_fnE=Ixx3=9sJFM&lt;/ref&gt;

===Still Flight===
A one-woman monologue written by poet [[Cyril Wong]] and performed by Elizabeth de Roza on 23 June 2005 at [[The Substation]] Dance Studio.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cyrilwong.com/Htms/stillflight.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spirits 'Yao Jing'===
It world-premiered on 3 June 2005 at the [[Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sistic.com.sg/SOPApp/SOPPortal/portal_proxy?uri=g0,s@!xgOKDALBR=IQ_YQce9-7Y_FXEl-KbYAzsJFM{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Written as a special dedication to Toy Factory's 15th anniversary and directed by award-winning director [[Goh Boon Teck]], it recounted a period 5,000 years ago when five ill-fated beauties were impeached for their tramped existence. Spirits unveiled five untold stories of Sai Jing Hua from the Qing dynasty, an infamous prostitute, Bao Si from the Zhou dynasty, the concubine who never smiled, Lu Hou from the Han dynasty, the revengeful empress, Ya Zuan Ji from the Tang dynasty, a poetic priestess and Ke Shi Ming from the Ming dynasty, the Great Madam, all of whom were despised and condemned by Chinese historians.

Goh collaborated with playwright Xu Sheng Liang ([[China]]) and music composer Saidah Rastam ([[Malaysia]]) to reinterpret [[Chinese opera]] and its heritage in a different ensemble. Together, they breathed contemporary life into traditional [[Chinese opera]] whilst retaining its beauty.

It was crafted as a musical, infusing 5 different forms of Chinese opera, namely Yue, Jing, Li Yuan, Huang Mei and Yu, with contemporary funk. No traditional opera musical instruments or props were employed in this unconventional fusion. Instead, there were 4 actors, 5 martial artistes, 7 musicians, 1 saxophonist and 5 genres of opera in this creative mix.

Spirits advanced Chinese opera a step forward, creating a new theatre platform for the younger generation. Multimedia  effects and high-tech neon swords replaced traditional props. An outrageous wardrobe dazzled and a fascinating mobile stage transported the audience to another world.

The constantly challenged notion of masculinity in Asia has unfortunately led to the near extinction of opera female impersonators. Toy Factory proudly featured 5 of these professional 'Nan Hua Dan' from Singapore and China, which made the musical drama all the more gripping.

===Boys===

A project by [[Richard Chua]], after ''Lover's Words'', about heterosexuals in a homosexual society. It was an extension of Chua's belief that life should be led honestly and truthfully. In his quest to further meditate on love between people (in this case, among three boys in their 20s), Chua embarked on this project to push his collaborators to work in a space where they had nowhere to go, but to clean. Cleaning was an essential task that would bring these boys to the next phase of eternity.

The story was about love - love that seemed to be defined differently by different people, with different perspectives, resulting in different outcomes. Each boy had a love story to tell.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Doctor Who'' episodes (2005–present)}}
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;''[[Doctor Who]]'' is a British [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] programme produced by the [[BBC]]. {{Aired episodes|2018|12|2|num={{DW episode count}}|title=Doctor Who|uk=y}} This includes one television movie and multiple specials, and encompasses {{DW episode count|story}} stories over 37 seasons. Additionally, four charity specials and two animated serials have also been aired. The programme's high episode count has resulted in ''Doctor Who'' holding the [[world record]] for the highest number of episodes of a science-fiction programme.&lt;ref name= "record"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5390372.stm |title=Dr Who 'longest-running sci-fi' |date= 28 September 2006| accessdate= 15 December 2007|publisher= BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt; In June 2017, it was announced that due to the terms of a deal between [[BBC Worldwide]] and [[Shanghai Media Group|SMG Pictures]] in [[People's Republic of China|China]], the company has first right of refusal on the purchase for the Chinese market of future series of the programme until and including Series 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2017-06-03/the-bbc-is-already-preparing-for-at-least-five-more-series-of-doctor-who|title=The BBC is already preparing for at least FIVE more series of Doctor Who|publisher=RadioTimes|access-date=2017-06-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/worldwide/2017/doctor-who-china|title=BBC - Doctor Who Gets Brand Boost in China - Media Centre|website=www.bbc.co.uk|publisher=BBC|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Doctor Who'' ceased production in 1989, then [[History of Doctor Who#Ninth Doctor|resumed in 2005]]. The original series (1963–1989), generally consists of multi-episode serials. The 2005 revival trades the earlier serial format for a run of self-contained episodes, interspersed with occasional multi-part stories and structured into loose story arcs.

The story numbers below are not official designations; they are meant as a rough guide to placement in the overall context of the programme. There is some dispute, for instance, about whether to count Season 23's ''[[The Trial of a Time Lord]]'' as one or as four serials,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/trialtimelord1/detail.shtml|title=The Trial of a Time Lord: 1–4 : Details|accessdate= 27 October 2007 |last1 =Howe |first1 = David J.|author1-link=David J.

===Ninth Doctor===
In 2005, the BBC relaunched ''[[Doctor Who]]'' after a 16-year absence from episodic television, with [[Russell T Davies]], [[Julie Gardner]] and [[Mal Young]] as executive producers, [[Phil Collinson]] as producer, and [[Christopher Eccleston]] taking the lead role of the [[Ninth Doctor]].

The revival is a continuation of the original series. The new series is formatted to a [[16:9]] [[widescreen]] display ratio, and a standard episode length of 45 minutes. For the first time since the 1965–1966 season each episode has an individual title, and most stories do not span more than one episode. The show also returned to its traditional Saturday evening slot.

====Series 1 (2005)====
{{Main|Doctor Who (series 1)}}
The 2005 series constitutes a loose story arc, dealing with the consequences of the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]] and the mysterious Bad Wolf.

The '''[[WCW World Television Championship]]''' was a [[professional wrestling]] [[Professional wrestling championship#Gimmick/style championships|world television championship]] owned by the now-defunct [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotion]].

The title was introduced on February 27, 1974 in [[Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling]] (MACW), a territory of the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA). MACW, also known as [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] (JCP), was purchased by [[Turner Broadcasting System]] in 1988, and subsequently renamed WCW. In March 2001, certain assets of WCW were sold by [[AOL Time Warner]] to the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF, now WWE). As such these assets, including the rights to the WCW World Television Championship, inactive since April 10, 2000, were now WWF property.&lt;ref name="wwfbuywcw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.com/SlamWrestlingWCWSale/cyrus_01mar25-sun.html|title=Deal leaves wrestlers out in cold|last=Callis|first=Don|date=2001-03-25|work=SLAM! Sports: Wrestling|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]|accessdate=2009-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before it was known as the WCW World Television Championship (starting in 1991 and continuing until the title's deactivation), it was known as the NWA Mid-Atlantic Television Championship (1974 to 1977), the NWA Television Championship (1977 to 1985), and the NWA World Television Championship (1985 to 1991).

Being a professional wrestling championship, it was won via a scripted ending to a match or awarded to a wrestler because of a [[Narrative thread|storyline]]. All title changes occurred at JCP or WCW-promoted events. The inaugural champion was Danny Miller, who defeated [[Ole Anderson]] on February 27, 1974, in the finals of a tournament. [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]] holds the record for most reigns, with six. [[Ricky Steamboat|Rick Steamboat]]'s second reign ended due to vacancy for unknown reasons. The day on which the reign ended is also unknown, although it is known that the reign began on June 10, 1978, and came to a close sometime in 1980. As such, if the reign ended on January 1, 1980, or any later time during 1980, then Steamboat's second reign is the longest in the title's history, at over 570 days.&lt;ref group="N" name="Vacant1"/&gt; Five different reigns are tied for the record for shortest reign in the title's history, at one day.

[[Jim Duggan]] was the last champion in his only reign. At the time, then-champion [[Scott Hall]] did not want to be champion, and after unsuccessfully trying to give the title to [[Kevin Nash]], he abandoned the title by throwing the championship belt into a trashcan on the November 29, 1999, episode of one of WCW's television programs, ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Nitro]]''.&lt;ref name="Hallbio"/&gt; Duggan later found the championship belt in a dumpster on the February 16, 2000, episode of another of WCW's television programs, ''[[WCW Saturday Night]]'' and named himself champion.&lt;ref name="WCWTVrevived"/&gt; The championship was later retired on the April 10, 2000, episode of ''Nitro'', after a storyline reboot by WCW authority figures [[Eric Bischoff]] and [[Vince Russo]]. Overall, there were 107 reigns shared among 55 wrestlers, with 11 vacancies.

Regal would hold that championship until September 18, 1994, when Johnny B. Badd (Marc Mero) defeated him......By the summer of 1996, Regal had set his sights on regaining the WCW Television title, defeating Lex Luger for the belt on August 20, 1996. Prince Iaukea would upset Regal for the title in February 1997, leading to a short program between the two. Regal would regain the title, but not from Iaukea but from Ultimo Dragon at Slamboree '97 in May.....Regal's fourth and final reign as WCW Television Champion would end with Ultimo Dragon regaining the title on July 22, 1997.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mole''' (in the Czech original called '''Krtek''', or, for little mole, '''Krteček''') is an animated character in a series of [[cartoon]]s, created by Czech animator [[Zdeněk Miler]]. The premiere of the first short film with the Mole was on Venice Film Festival in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0841927/awards?ref_=tt_awd|title=iMDB.com|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its inception, the cartoon won itself an enormous popularity in many [[Central Europe]]an countries, as well as [[India]], [[China]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Croatia]], [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Iraq]] and [[Japan]].

== History ==
Krtek was first seen in 1956 in [[Prague]], when Miler wanted to create a children's cartoon about how [[flax]] is processed. He wanted a strong [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] influence to the cartoon by choosing an animal for the leading role, and decided to pick a [[Mole (animal)|mole]] after stumbling over a molehill during a walk. The first film called ''"Jak krtek ke kalhotkám přišel"'' (''"How the mole got his trousers"'') had premiere on Venice Film Festival in 1957, where it was awarded two Golden Lions. Production for further episodes started in 1963 and since then, around 50 episodes have been created.

The first episode of the cartoon was [[Narrator|narrated]], but Miler wanted the cartoon to be understood in every country of the world, so he decided to use his daughters as [[Voice acting|voice actors]], reducing the speech to short non-figurative exclamations in order to express the mole's feelings and world perception. They also became the [[bottleneck (project management)|bottleneck]] of the creation process as they were the ones who got to see the whole film first, thus Miler was able to decide whether the message of the movie was able to get to children or not.

{{cquote|It took me a long time to realize it, but when I draw Krtek, I was drawing myself.|4=Zdeněk Miler}}

== Recent Developments ==

=== Inclusion on US Space Shuttle flight ===
On May 16, 2011 a [[plush toy]] of Krtek was present on board the [[Space Shuttle Endeavour]] where it accompanied the U.S. astronaut [[Andrew Feustel]], whose wife is of Czech ancestry, on the [[STS-134]] mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.czechspace.cz/cs/into-space-with-mole |title=Into Space with Mole |date=2011-04-03 |author=Halousek, Milan |publisher=[[Czech Space Office]] |accessdate=2012-06-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721213727/http://www.czechspace.cz/cs/into-space-with-mole |archivedate=July 21, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dokosmuskrtkem.cz/wordpress/?page_id=528 |title=Flying to Space with the Little Mole (Do kosmu s Krtkem) |publisher=Do kosmu s Krtkem |accessdate=2012-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703858404576214352915391860 | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Leos | last=Rousek | title=Space Shuttle Stowaway Is a Commie Mole | date=2011-03-22 |accessdate=2012-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== US toy market plans ===
In May 2012 Bloomberg announced that [[Apple Inc.]] is planning to help Krtek enter the $21 billion U.S. toy market for the first time.&lt;ref name=YahooFinance&gt;{{cite news|title=Apple to help Czech cartoon character Krtek enter U.S. market, Bloomberg reports|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-help-czech-cartoon-character-102938086.html|accessdate=2012-05-18|newspaper=Yahoo Finance|date=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bloomberg&gt;{{cite news|title=Apple Helps Czech Mole Enter $21 Billion U.S. Toy Market|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-15/apple-helps-czech-mole-enter-21-billion-u-s-toy-market.html|accessdate=2012-05-18|newspaper=Bloomberg|date=2012-05-16|first=Lenka|last=Ponikelska}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exporting the six-decade-old “Little Mole” through new media is a first step toward establishing the most popular Czech animated icon in America to spur sales of books, movies and toys. Coloring books about the [http://colorkid.net/coloring-pages-cartoons/coloring-pages-krtek Mole] have been very popular with young [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Animation/TheLittleMole children.]

=== Mascot ===
In January 2015 the [[Czech Athletics Federation]] announced that Krtek would be the mascot for the [[2015 European Athletics Indoor Championships]] in [[Prague]], and would subsequently be used to promote the Federation's Athletics for Children programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.praguepost.com/czech-news/43703-thursday-news-briefing-jan-8-2015 |title=Thursday news briefing — Jan.8, 2015 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=8 January 2015 |website=[[Prague Post]] |access-date=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Little Mole on trip around the world ==
Little Mole (aka Krtecek in Czech language), for certain, is a favourite Czech cartoon character. It was selected as a mascot for [http://www.ourtriparoundtheworld.com/ Our trip around the world] project by travellers Pavel Zrzavy and Martina Libricka. Little Mole set out on his world trip together with his new friends on 8 February 2015. He was discovering the world for 527 days. During these days he traveled over 22 countries, visited hundreds of places and got to know many interesting cultures. Travellers decided to take Little Mole with them as a symbol reminding them home.They also wanted Little Mole to continue inspiring children and adults who like him.

== Music ==
Music plays an important role in the cartoons, since the characters almost never utter more than emotional sounds, the most common of which is "Hello!" ("Ahoj" in Czech). The original series' music uses acoustic and electric musical instruments, rather than synthesized ones.

Composers:
* [[Miloš Vacek]]
* [[Vadim Petrov]] (1974–1994, most episodes)

== Filmography ==
* From 2002–2004, a set of 60 DVDs entitled "Nejlepšich večerničků" (Bedtime Stories) were released, some of which included Krtek animations. Included in the list below are the DVD numbers for films in this set.

==Synopsis==
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:mulawin14.jpg|frame|Pirena,Amihan,fanaya and Muros]] --&gt;

[[Aguiluz (Mulawin character)|Aguiluz]] and [[Alwina]]'s plan for a peaceful life as mortals unravels when their boat to Tierra Fuego (the realm of man) is caught in a violent storm.  They wash up on separate shores, a young man and woman living without memories and living separate lives.  Aguiluz is adopted by a humble farmer and Alwina becomes the surrogate daughter of a wealthy family and is engaged to be married to Gabriel.

But a new period in the Mulawin saga unfolds as "Keeper of the Jewel of Fire", Sang'gre [[Pirena]] uses the ''gintong binhi'' to bring Ravenum back to life.  Ravenum summons the [[dragon]] Buwarka and raises an army of Ravenas to wreak havoc on Avila, which barely survives the initial attack. With the power of Mulawin’s Tree of Life dwindling down and the Mulawin race in peril, the [[Diwata]]s and the Tres Aves (a legendary trio of heroes with special abilities) rush to aid the Mulawin.  But ultimately, the fate of Avila and the Mulawin race now hinges on the valor of two of its two greatest champions, Aguiluz and Alwina. The Tres Aves faces the dragon "Buwarka",The Mulawins and the Encantadia's Lireo soldiers led by Ybbarro/Ybrahim faces the Ravenas and Aguiluz and Alwina faces Ravenum. The fight continues as Aguiluz and Alwina goes inside Ravenum's hideout. There they find Dakila and continues their journey. They continue a violent fight with the Ravenas and as they reach Ravenum, Aguiluz's mother (transformed from death) shows up with her husband, Ravenum. Ravenum then forces Aguiluz to transform into a Ravena and complete the family or else he will kill Alwina. Aguiluz agreed, to save the life of Alwina and their child. The Ravenas took away Alwina and Dakila, planning on beheading them. Aguiluz's body was too holy for the darkness because he was blessed and once again turns into a Mulawin. Dakila dies in the hands of the Ravenas and Alwina graviously cries. She returns to Aguiluz but their ugatpak's powers only works for nights. Aguiluz is stabbed by a sword behind. They make a way out of the hideout and at the end, killing Ravenum and comes also the death of Aguiluz. They return to Avila after a victory and a deadly battle. Aguiluz is seen lying in a royal bed in the kingdom of Lireo in Encantadia with Queen Amihan of Lireo putting the gintong binhi to his mouth that can get his life back. Alwina is then seen putting Dakila's ugatpak in the Mulawin's Tree of Life. The last part is Alwina and her son, Almiro flying together with Aguiluz behind them.

Since the movie is a sequel, major characters such as Veronica (played by [[Ara Mina]]) and Rasmus (played by [[Gary Estrada]]) who died in the TV series were not included in the movie version. New characters not in the TV series were also introduced in the movie. Regarding the Encantadia cast, it is said that Robbie Tan of [[Seiko Films]] did not allow his contract stars [[Diana Zubiri]] (''[[Encantadia]]'s'' [[Danaya]]) and [[Alfred Vargas]] (''Encantadia's'' [[Aquil]]) to appear in the movie and because of this, Valerie Concepcion played the role of Danaya in the film while Aquil's character was not included.

==Production ==
GMA Films hired international action choreographer Wong Wai Fai and other [[Hong Kong]] martial arts experts to make the stunts more realistic, the same team hired for the 2005's fantasy-action TV series ''[[Sugo]]''. Wong choreographed stunts in the highly successful foreign films such as [[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]], [[Kung Fu Hustle]], [[Rush Hour 2]] and [[Bulletproof Monk]].

==Critical reception==
The [[Cinema Evaluation Board of the Philippines]] gave the movie the high A Rating, making it the only entry of the MMFF to receive such rating.

Mulawin the Movie is one of three fantasy films entered into the Metro Manila Film Festival (MMFF).

Mulawin: The Movie despite being a graded A film did not win any award in the concluded Metro Manila Film Festival 2005 Awards Night.

The '''newspaper riddle''' is a [[riddle joke]] or conundrum that begins with the question:&lt;ref name=Barrick&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Newspaper Riddle Joke|author=Mac E. Barrick|journal=The Journal of American Folklore|volume=87|issue=345|date=July–September 1974|pages=253&amp;ndash;257|doi=10.2307/538740}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:'''Q''': What is black and white and red all over?
The traditional answer, which relies upon the [[homophone|identical pronunciation]] of the words "[[wikt:red|red]]" and "[[wikt:read|read]]", is:&lt;ref name=Barrick /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Study of Language|author=George Yule|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-56851-X|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:'''A''': A [[newspaper]]

Barrick&lt;ref name=Barrick /&gt; believes this riddle to be "perhaps the most common example of a folk riddle collected in the United States in the twentieth century", pointing out that between 1917 and 1939 it appeared in 15 collections of folk riddles, and in a further six between 1939 and 1974.

Alternative answers to the riddle exist, where red is used as a color, parodying the canonical form of the riddle. Examples include: "an embarrassed zebra", "a penguin with a rash", "a chocolate sundae with ketchup on top", and "a crossword done in red ink".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=New York Folklore Quarterly|author=New York Folklore Society|year=1945|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Portnoy describes these answers as "adequate, but not clever", because they lack the homophonic pun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Remnant: Essays on a Theme in Old English Verse|author=Phyllis Portnoy|page=32|year=2006|publisher=Runetree|isbn=1-898-57710-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translations==

In ''The Language of Jokes'', Delia Chiaro notes that it is, technically, [[Untranslatability|impossible to translate]] this joke into languages other than English, pointing out that, for example, in [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[German language|German]] the words "[[wikt:rouge|rouge]]", "[[wikt:rosso|rosso]]", and "[[wikt:rot|rot]]" have no meaning other than "red" and do not possess homophones.&lt;ref name=Chiaro&gt;{{cite book|title=The Language of Jokes: analysing verbal play|author=Delia Chiaro|pages=92&amp;ndash;93|year=1992|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-03090-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She adds that it is possible to translate the intent of the joke, and to retain the invariant core of the colour red and the reference to a newspaper, by substituting a different riddle that relies upon metaphor, albeit that the homophonic play upon words is lost.  She gives the following example in French, which relies upon the facts that ''[[L'Humanité]]'' is the newspaper of the [[French Communist Party]], and that, as "red" has in English, "[[wikt:rouge|rouge]]" in French has political connotations of Communism:&lt;ref name=Chiaro /&gt;
:'''Q''': Qu'est-ce qui/Quel journal est tout rouge et noir et blanc?
:'''A''': ''L'Humanité''

She also gives a similar example in Italian, this time using the newspaper of the [[Italian Communist Party]] ([[L'Unità]]), noting that in Italian the order of black and white is the reverse of that in English, since "nero e bianco" is a marked form, and that for prosodic naturalness "rosso" must come first:&lt;ref name=Chiaro /&gt;
:'''Q''': Quale giornale è rosso, bianco e nero?
:'''A''': ''L'Unità''

For German, she gives this example, which again, like Italian, requires the colour adjectives to be in a different order:&lt;ref name=Chiaro /&gt;
:'''Q''': Was ist rot, schwarz und weiss?
:'''A''': ''[[Die Tageszeitung]]''

==Famous uses==

On 2009, Jason Jones asked the question to Bill Keller, the editor of The New York Times, and quickly answered back: "Your balance sheet".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/wed-june-10-2009/end-times End Times - The Daily Show with Jon Stewart - 06/10/09 - Video Clip | Comedy Central&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Jimmy Kimmel at the 2012 White House Correspondent's Dinner did this joke and replied: "Nothing anymore", in an allusion to the death of print news.&lt;ref&gt;Jimmy Kimmel at the White House Correspondent's Dinner- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pazhvZ-FnNg&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=September 2012}}
'''Ninja''' is a common [[playground game]], where the objective is to take turns swiping at the opponent's hands to eliminate them. The name originates from the [[Ninja|feudal Japanese assassin]]. It is commonly played at meet-ups and conventions.

== Rules and gameplay ==
The rules of ninja are simple, and have only a few pivotal rules for play. In a game, players will stand in a circle, and place their hands together, the player leading the game will say "Bow to your [[sensei]]". There, the countdown begins, and each player must strike a pose. Players take turns attacking their opponents by swiping at their hands
, and must freeze in place once their attack is finished. Defending players may dodge if they think they will be hit, and must also freeze once the attack is finished. If a player is hit, the hand that is hit is out but the other hand is still in.  If a player misses, they must stop moving immediately.  When both hands have been hit, the player is out and must stand back until there is one player left. The only player left is the winner. However, there have been variations to how children play the game, some exercise optional rules such as, the area that is hit, timed attacks or however the players want to change the game.

== Variations ==
A common "Circle Ninja" variant requires players to move in a [[clockwise]] motion rather than any direction they please.

In "Ultimate Ninja", players position themselves in a circle and take turns in a clockwise motion. This variant however, adds the objective of slapping either the hands or the feet. The players are also able to dodge multiple attacks before their turn. Typically, ultimate ninja has players completing more complex maneuvers such as [[Cartwheel (gymnastics)|cartwheels]], slide kicks, [[jump kick]]s and so on.

Another variation specifies that players have only one life, that is, when one hand is hit, the player is considered out.

Some games have a "lightning round" where two players attack each other and try to not stop until one is hit in the hand. The game is over when a player gets hit in the hand, stops the motion, or becomes confused during his or her turn. Many people play a rapid one-on-one variant where players must stand toe-to-toe throughout the game.

In "Ninja Balance", players can only use one hand and the other is placed behind the back and can not touch anything. The right hands are bound together and the players can not move one foot which is planted outer ankle bone to toe. The players score a hit by touching any part of the opponent with their finger of the bound hand or when they cause the other player to lose balance and move their planted foot. Three hits is a win. Players are disqualified for causing injury or using the dead hand for anything but balance.

Another variation includes the "instant death" rule. The most common version being when a player strikes another in the nose. Other locations such as the neck and forehead may also be used.

{{nihongo|'''''Puyo Puyo! 15th Anniversary'''''|ぷよぷよ!|Puyopuyo!}} is a sub-story of the [[Puyo Puyo (series)|Puyo Puyo]] series, developed by [[Sonic Team]] and published by [[Sega]] for the [[Nintendo DS]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[PlayStation Portable]], and [[Wii]]. As with many other games in the series, it has not been released outside Japan for any consoles. This is the first Puyo Puyo game to be released on the Wii console.

== Plot ==
Ms. Accord, the teacher at the Primp Magic School, informs Sig that there will be a tournament up for play, and everyone's competing; the reward is a medal that will grant anyone's single wish. Another scene shows Amitie and Arle pledging to play by the rules, and Sig, still as clueless as ever, eventually plegdes as well, but not before witnessing six comets fall down onto Earth. Sig, realising that this is a big discovery, decides to ignore it anyhow and goes onto the competition. It turns out that the "comets" are actually six familiar characters from the Madou series, who serve as boss characters in the story modes.

== Characters ==
As ''Puyo Puyo! 15th Anniversary'' was created to commemorate the fifteenth anniversary of Puyo Puyo, it includes most of the ''Fever'' characters plus six of the characters from the ''Madou'' series; they are said to have fallen from the sky into Primp Town, the primary setting of the Fever series games. There are a total of twenty-two characters in this game.

== Gameplay ==
15th Anniversary has a slew of new modes, and also includes modes that emulate the original ''[[Puyo Puyo (video game)|Puyo Puyo]]'', ''[[Puyo Puyo Tsu]]'' and ''[[Puyo Pop Fever]]''. In most cases, players are eliminated when he/she tops out, and the last player (or side) standing wins the round.

;Puyo Puyo
:This mode emulates quite accurately the gameplay of the original ''[[Puyo Puyo (video game)|Puyo Puyo]]''.
;Puyo Puyo 2
:This mode emulates the gameplay of ''[[Puyo Puyo Tsu]]''.
;Puyo Puyo Fever
:This is Fever mode, similar to gameplay of ''[[Puyo Pop Fever]]'' and ''[[Puyo Puyo Fever 2]]'', but with some small updates. The Fever counter is more rigid and actually represents the time that players have - when time expires, that time cannot be extended by the end of a chain. In addition, Fever time is now earned not when the opponent offsets but instead when the player makes a chain that does ''not'' offset.
;Big Puyo
:In this mode, Puyo are twice as large in both directions and the board itself is only 3 by 6 Puyo, a quarter of the normal board size. Less garbage is sent to opponents in this mode. The objective is simply to defeat all opponents.
;Bomber
:In this mode, instead of sending nuisance Puyo, players send bomb blocks, which explode after the user with them makes a certain number of moves and change all surrounding Puyo into Hard Puyo.
;Endless Fever
:In this mode, players start off with a Fever that does not end and a large number of pending Nuisance Puyo. They can't fall, however, so they are only there to be offset until one player finishes offsetting and overflows into the Fever trash galley of the opponents.
;Excavation
:In this mode, players start with a half-filled regular board. Hidden on the bottom row is a star, that, when popped, will send infinite garbage to all other opponents. The goal is to pop the Star Puyo and defeat the opponents. Once one player has popped the star, offsetting is no longer allowed, so if both players happen to get it at the same time, Nuisance Puyo will begin dropping with the next Puyo pair dropped.
;Spinner
:In this mode, the fields will rotate every 15 seconds. The counter acts similar to the Fever counter - when time expires, it waits for players to drop their last Puyo. When all players are idle after time expires, the boards spin 180 degrees and then gravity acts on the Puyos. A special bonus is given to chains that continue after or are started from the spin.
;Ice Blocks
:In this mode, instead of sending nuisance Puyos, players send frozen Puyo blocks, which become unfrozen after the player who has them makes 3 moves. Because of the nature of sending the other player Puyo blocks that have the ability to chain, this mode can turn around if the chain created by the original sender is not large enough to defeat the opponents.
;Mission
:In mission mode, players are given a task which they must complete before their opponents. The first player (or side) that completes 3 tasks before the opponents do wins the round.
;Searchlight
:In this mode, all the players' Puyo boards are only partially visible on the screen at any time (except during Fever mode). The visibility range is a cone, originating from the top of the screen and expanding downward, which is in a constant sway, lampooning a [[searchlight]]. This mode is difficult because it disorients proper placement of Puyos, or causes the player to have to slow down and wait for the searchlight to pass an area unknown to them in order to make proper chains.
;Underwater
:Water mode is a slow moving mode where players place Puyos into a body of water filled up to two Puyo. Puyo float in the water, making the mode in essence the same as placing Puyo at the bottom of a Puyo board. Because of the nature of this mode, Nuisance Puyos only fall in groups of 1 line. This prevents Nuisance Puyo from causing chains due to the unequal descent of the columns.

== DS Version Multiplayer ==
The DS version of 15th Anniversary supports all multiplayer modes that the DS officially supports.

=== Everybody Puyo Puyo ===
In this mode, players without a copy of 15th Anniversary can play along with those that do. The only difference between playing with a copy and without a copy is that the download and play version does not contain voices or battle animations. The game is functionally compatible, for the most part. Therefore, both the DS Download and Play modes and direct connection modes are accessible from here.

Up to 8 players can play and in any mode that the number of players permits. However, for technical reasons (such as alternative drawing methods being used in 8-player mode to keep the game from lagging), you can only play Puyo Puyo, Puyo Puyo TSU, and Puyo Puyo Fever modes in games with more than four players.

=== WiFi ===
In this mode, you can use [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]] to verse players across the internet. WiFi mode supports only 3 modes (Puyo Puyo, Puyo Puyo 2, and Puyo Puyo Fever). You can play games of between two and four players, either with your friends using the Friend Code system or against random opponents. When playing random games, three-player mode and the original Puyo Puyo rules are not available, and you can earn (or lose!) points if playing a two-player game.

== Issues ==
Puyo Puyo! 15th Anniversary for the DS had several issues.

=== Saving ===
In the original release of Puyo Puyo! 15th Anniversary, a bug existed where data would could not be saved more than [[255 (number)|255]] times.&lt;ref name="nds-puyo-apology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sega.jp/topics/061220_1|trans-title=Apology and notice concerning the Nintendo DS Game Software "Puyo Puyo"|title=ニンテンドーDS用ゲームソフト『ぷよぷよ!』に関するお詫びとお知らせ|date=2006-12-20|publisher=Sega Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new version, nicknamed 1.1, was released to solve the problem on January 20, 2007. Information on how to find out the game version and instructions on how to get replacement can be found on [http://sega.jp/topics/070105_1/ Sega's website].

=== WiFi ===
In both of these versions existed yet another bug, this one effecting WiFi. When a player disconnected, both lost points. A new version was released to solve this problem.

=== Fever meter bug ===
While playing multiplayer games, the fever meter will occasionally freeze on 7 points without letting you into fever mode. It will subsequently let you in after your next move, but this may be deadly depending on the circumstances. This bug can also be seen in version 2.00 of the PC version of [[Puyo Pop Fever]].

==Trivia==
*A new garbage symbol was added (comet/1440 garbage). This symbol became staple in future Puyo Puyo games.

==Duty on playing cards==
[[File:Acedutycard.jpg|thumb|100px|Ace with duty legal stamp]]
In England, during the 19th century, under the [[Stamp Act]] playing card manufacturers required a license, a duty legal stamp that incorporated the [[royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom]] to be placed on the ace of spades, known as the "[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/duty_card duty card]" or [[Colloquialism|colloquially]] called the "duty ace" or "[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Old_Frizzle Old Frizzle]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://i-p-c-s.org/faq/ace-of-spades.php The International Playing-Card Society - The Ace of Spades]&lt;/ref&gt; and a regulated label appended to the wrapper of the pack of playing cards.&lt;ref name="PC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.endebrock.de/stamps/st-gb.html History of Playing Card Stamps]&lt;/ref&gt;  The brass duty legal stamps were kept at the office of the Stamp Commissioner and the stamped duty cards with the name of the card maker on them and the same number of labels were delivered to the card marker.&lt;ref name="OB" /&gt;  These laws and regulations were to enforce the excise duty tax levied on every pack of playing cards.&lt;ref name="PC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OB" /&gt;  Card makers faced a monetary penalty for not following the laws under the Stamp Act.&lt;ref name="PC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OB" /&gt; 

A playing card manufacturer without a license could neither obtain a legal stamp for the ace of spades nor a regulated label placed on the wrapper of the pack of playing cards.&lt;ref name="PC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OB" /&gt; An illegal manufacturer of playing cards would have to forge the brass legal stamp placed on the ace of spades and create a counterfeit label for the wrapper.&lt;ref name="PC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OB" /&gt;  In England, forgery and uttering was a [[capital punishment|capital offence]] in 1805.&lt;ref name="PC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OB" /&gt;

==Court case==
Richard Harding was indicted under the [[stamp act|stamp law]]s for two offences.  The indictment charged Harding with having counterfeited the impression of brass duty stamps authorized by the Stamp commissioner for the purpose of denoting the duty on playing cards.  It likewise charged Harding of vending and selling playing cards with these counterfeited impressions, knowing it to be so done.

More specifically, the first count was Harding feloniously did forge, counterfeit and resemble, on the ace of spades the impression of the mark used and denoted on the playing card, with intention to defraud the duty charged on playing cards.&lt;ref name="OB" /&gt;

The second count was Harding feloniously did vend and sell playing cards, with counterfeit impressions of the duty stamp on the ace of spades and Harding knowing the said marks to be counterfeited.&lt;ref name="OB" /&gt;   And thirteen other counts for like offence, only charging them in a different manner.&lt;ref name="OB" /&gt;
[[File:Friz.jpg|left|thumb|180px|"Old Frizzle"]]

The Attorney General, [[Spencer Perceval]], opened the [[legal case]] against Harding and pursued the matter with great vigour.&lt;ref name="PC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OB" /&gt;

The evidence supported that Harding was a licensed card maker and kept two licensed shops, in which he sold playing cards.&lt;ref name="PC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OB" /&gt;   The first shop was in Hereford Street, Oxford Road and the second shop in North Row, [[Grosvenor Square]].&lt;ref name="PC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OB" /&gt;  Harding's print shop was behind the house of Mr. Skelton, a dealer in [[Liquor|spirits]] and groceries, in Green Street, Grosvenor Square.&lt;ref name="PC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OB" /&gt;  This location was where Harding created the spurious ‘duty aces.’&lt;ref name="OB" /&gt; 

Mr. Hockley of the Stamp Office, the official printer of the legal ace of spades, provided evidence to the Court that he bought from Harding and his apprentice packs of playing cards, which contained a [[counterfeit]]ed ace of spades.&lt;ref name="PC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OB" /&gt; 

Harding's apprentice gave testimony that he witnessed Harding manufacturing playing cards using forged brass duty legal stamps to place a duty stamp on the ace of spades and adhering counterfeit labels on the wrapper.&lt;ref name="PC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OB" /&gt;  Harding placed a substance on the labels to give them a gloss like the legal labels.&lt;ref name="PC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OB" /&gt; 

On Saturday, 21 September 1805, at the [[Old Bailey]], London, Harding, was [[Capital punishment|capitally]] indicted, before Mr. Justice Heath and a Jury, on two counts: 
:1st. Forging, fabricating, and counterfeiting the legal stamp on the Ace of Spades. 
:2nd. Selling and [[uttering]] playing-cards with the same, while knowing such stamp to be false.&lt;ref name="PC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OB" /&gt; 

Justice Heath told the Jury ‘there could be no doubt’ of Harding's guilt and they found Richard Harding guilty and he was sentenced to death at the age of 35.&lt;ref name="PC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OB" /&gt;

==Execution==
Contemporary newspapers of the time had made unsuccessful attempts to secure a reprieve&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/reprieve.html Capital Punishment UK - Reprieves, the curse of the system?]&lt;/ref&gt; for Harding.&lt;ref name="PC" /&gt; On {{start date and age|df=yes|1805|11|13}}, Richard Harding's execution took place in the Old Bailey, by the [[Executioner|hangman]], William Brunskill.&lt;ref name="NG" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/early.html Early English hangmen - William Brunskill]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

An account of the Court case against Harding was reported in the ‘Imperial Weekly Gazette’ published at 45, [[Old Bailey]].&lt;ref name="PC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OB" /&gt;  The [[Forgery, Abolition of Punishment of Death Act 1832]] was an Act of Parliament of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], which abolished the death penalty for all offences of forgery, except for forging [[will (law)|will]]s and certain [[Power of attorney|powers of attorney]]. These exceptions were abolished under the [[Forgery Act 1837]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3036">'''''Sarbufis''''', short for '''''Sarekat Buruh Film dan Sandiwara''''' (Film and Theatre Workers Union), was a [[trade union]] in [[Indonesia]]. Sarbufis was affiliated to the trade union centre [[SOBSI]], which was linked to the [[Communist Party of Indonesia]].&lt;ref name="hi"/&gt; As of January 1960, Sarbufis claimed a membership of 6,000.&lt;ref name="hi"&gt;Hindley, Donald.

The organization was founded in 1951, with the name ''Sarekat Buruh Film Indonesia'' (Film Workers Union of Indonesia, abbreviated ''Sarbufi''). It was the first professional organization of the workers of the film industry. The union joined SOBSI immediately after its formation.

{{italic title}}
'''''Soldier of Orange''''' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Soldaat van Oranje'') is a Dutch musical production, based on the true story of resistance hero [[Erik Hazelhoff Roelfzema]]. In the 1970s, he wrote his experiences during [[World War II]] down in a book and director [[Paul Verhoeven]] made it into a [[Soldier of Orange|feature film]], starring actor [[Rutger Hauer]].

The musical premiered on 30 October 2010, in a theatre that was purpose-built for the production: the TheaterHangaar on the former [[Valkenburg air base]] in [[Katwijk]] (in an old [[hangar]]). Queen [[Beatrix of the Netherlands|Beatrix]] attended the premiere together with Erik Hazelhoff Roelfzema's widow, Karin.
''Soldier of Orange'' is produced by [[Robin de Levita]] and NEW Productions, which is a collaboration between investment company Amerborgh Nederland and Volterra, parent company of Montecatini Talent Agency.

==Plot==
Student Erik Hazelhoff Roelfzema and his friends are carefree, until the Germans invade the Netherlands in the early days of May 1940. The war changes everything. They can no longer take friendship and love for granted. Everybody has to make choices. Fight for the country and for freedom? Focus on studying and deny what’s going on? Or join the enemy?

The book of Hazelhoff Roelfzema, with the title Cave of the Rattlesnake (Dutch: Het hol van de ratelslang), was published in 1970. It reappeared a year later under the title Soldier of Orange. Paul Verhoeven created a film version in 1977. Rutger Hauer played the character Erik Lanshoff, based on the resistance hero.

Soldier of Orange – The Musical brings the true story to the theatre. After World War II starts, Erik decides to flee to [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. He smuggles transmitting equipment to the Netherlands and, as a pilot, is involved in bombing Germany. He becomes adjutant for Queen [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Wilhelmina]] and receives the [[Military William Order]] ('Militaire Willems-Orde'), the highest royal honour in the Netherlands, for his contribution to the resistance movement.

==Background==
Producer [[Fred Boot]] obtained the rights to turn the story into a musical in 2005, after meeting Hazelhoff Roelfzema the year before.

Scriptwriter Edwin de Vries wrote the musical script. American duo Tom Harriman and Pamela Philips Oland was responsible for composition and lyrics. Dutch actor and composer Frans van Deursen translated the lyrics from English into Dutch.
In 2008, Boot asked theatre producer Robin de Levita to join him. Director Theu Boermans joined the team in 2009.

==Location==
The show takes place in a former flight hangar, that is converted into a theatre. The location of the so-called TheaterHangaar is former military airport Valkenburg between Wassenaar, Katwijk en Leiden, a suitable, historical place. A foyer with a bar and restaurant is placed in front of the hangar.

==SceneAround==
Producer Robin de Levita invented a new theatrical performance solution for Soldier of Orange – The Musical: a rotating auditorium in the center of a venue with 1100 seats. He named it [[SceneAround]]. The auditorium is placed on a turntable. The audience rotates from scenery to scenery, accompanied by 180 degree projections on panel screens around the auditorium. Both the auditorium and the screens are motorized and automated. The set is built around the auditorium. Almost every scenery has its own set. There is even a ‘sea’ and the runway of the airport is also part of the set.

==Dakota==
Queen Wilhelmina returned to the Netherlands with a Dakota. The [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|Dakota C-47]] was made available for the musical by a Dutch museum and was taken to Valkenburg in August 2010. Shortly after midnight, the plane got stuck in an overpass. It was too damaged to have it repaired on time for the premiere. The Dakota PH-ALR ‘Reiger’ from 1939 that’s being used in the production now, was delivered on 23 September 2010.

'''''Star Search''''' is an American [[television show]] that was produced by T.P.E./[[Rysher Entertainment]] from 1983 to 1995, hosted by [[Ed McMahon]], and created by [[Al Masini]]. A relaunch was produced by [[2929 Entertainment|2929 Productions]] from 2003 to 2004. On both versions of the show, contestants competed in several genres of entertainment. The show was originally filmed at the old [[Earl Carroll Theatre]] (now known as [[Nickelodeon on Sunset]]), at 6230 Sunset Blvd. in [[Hollywood]]&lt;ref name="Gordon"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Ultimate Hollywood Tour Book |last=Gordon |first=William A. |year=1992 |publisher= |location=[[Toluca Lake, CA]] |isbn=0-937813-03-6 |oclc= |page=156 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later at the [[Disney's Hollywood Studios|Disney Hollywood Studios]] in Orlando, Florida.

1983–1995 version
While categories varied slightly from season to season, the ten basic categories&lt;ref&gt;''Star Search,'CBS, 1983-1995.&lt;/ref&gt; during the 1983–1995 version were:

* Female singer
* Male singer
* Junior singer (Second half of the season)
* Teen singer (First half of the season)
* Group vocal
* Dance
* Junior dance (First half of the season)
* Teen dance (Second half of the season)
* Spokesmodel
* Comedy

[[Image:Star Search original logo.png|thumb|150px|left|The original ''Star Search'' logo, used from 1983 to 1994.]]
[[Image:Star Search '95.jpg|thumb|150px|left|The ''Star Search'' logo used from 1994 to 1995.]]
Eight categories were contested per show.  Potential contestants auditioned to be on the show. In each category, two selected contestants would compete, a champion and a challenger. The challenger would usually perform first, while the champion performed second.  In later seasons, the champion performed first.

All acts were judged by a panel of four judges, and each judge could award an act from one to four stars (later changed to five stars).  Once both acts were complete, Ed would reveal the scores, and the best average won. If there was a tie, a studio audience vote broke the tie, in which case the results were revealed at the end of the show.

Any performer must win at least several shows in a row, depending on the number of shows left in the season, to earn an entry into the next round of the competition; usually this was three or four wins in a row.  In later seasons, three-match winners were automatically retired. In this case, two new performers would compete in that category the following week.

In most seasons, two semifinal shows took place, one in the fall, the other in the spring, prior to the championship show.  Each semifinal used five judges.  No scoring was used, and the judges' votes weren't revealed, but the acts that won their semifinals would then compete in the championship show.

On the championship show, winners of Male Vocalist, Female Vocalist, Vocal Group, Comedy, and Dance, were awarded $100,000 but no record contract was guaranteed. Many Star Search winners from the early seasons secured recording contracts within a few weeks of the end of the competition—first season vocal group winner [[Sawyer Brown]], first season male vocalist champion [[Sam Harris (singer)|Sam Harris]] and second season male vocalist champion Durell Coleman were the first three, and were later followed by second season vocal group winner Limited Warranty, third season female vocalist champion [[Linda Eder]], second season junior male vocalist champion Jimmy Salvemini, whose album was produced by [[Luther Vandross]], fourth season male vocalist champion [[David Slater]], and first season (1985) junior female vocalist runner-up [[Tiffany (American singer)|Tiffany]].  Despite not winning her competition (she lost to Melissa Moultrie), Tiffany, performing on ''Star Search'' as 'Tiffany Renee,' was the first Star Search alumnus to land a #1 hit, with her cover of the Top 5 [[Tommy James and the Shondells]] hit "[[I Think We're Alone Now]]" —actually improving on the original single's chart performance.&lt;ref&gt;Chart positions courtesy Billboard Publications, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; The winner of the Spokesmodel category was awarded $100,000 and a contract with a well-known modeling agency.  The first Spokesmodel winner was [[Tracey Ross]], who later became a leading actress on the soap opera [[Passions]].  Winners of Junior Vocalist, Junior Dance, Teen Vocalist, and Teen Dance win $10,000.

In early seasons, before the three match limit rule was adopted, the grand champions were determined by how long a champion held their title.  While it is believed that [[Sam Harris (singer)|Sam Harris]] holds the record for longest championship, at 14 weeks in Season 1, Harris was actually defeated by singer Beau Williams on Harris' 14th attempt. This record is actually held by Singer Durell Coleman (1985), who won the $100,000 on Season 2 with 15 wins and no defeats.

==2003–2004 version==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2012}}
In the wake of ''[[American Idol]]''{{-'}}s success, [[Arsenio Hall]] hosted a new version of ''Star Search'', which ran for two years: 2003 and 2004 on CBS, before ending up in reruns on cable channel [[Game Show Network|GSN]] for one year from 2004 to 2005. This new version was judged by four panelists, including [[Ben Stein]], [[Naomi Judd]], [[Ahmet Zappa]] and a rotating celebrity panelist (which in at least one case was McMahon himself). Among the winners were singer [[Tiffany Evans]], comedian John Roy and singer Mark Mejia.

The revival consisted of four series. For the first series, the categories were Adult and Junior Singer, Comedy, and Modeling. In series two and three, Modeling was replaced with Dance. In the final series, the Comedy category was scrapped altogether and only the singing and dancing categories remained.

For the first three series, two new competitors faced off. The three house judges, along with the one celebrity judge, gave each contestant a score on a scale from one to five stars, making a maximum studio score 20 stars. During each commercial break, the home audience went to www.cbs.com/star to rate the competitors who just performed. Each performer could earn up to another 20 stars from the home audience. In the climactic moment before the score from the home audience was revealed, Hall would often say, "Hit me with the digits!"

When the scores were tallied, the higher scoring performer won. If the score was tied, then Hall would read off each performer's score rounded to the nearest hundredth (the at-home score was initially rounded down to the nearest star, unless there was a tie). That performer would then go on to the next round of competition. The only real exception to this format during the first three series was that three people competed in the semi-final rounds, not two. After the first two series, a special, "Battle of the Best" show took place, where the two Adult Singer, Junior Singer, and Comedian Grand Champions (Modeling was only the first season, and Dance had only been around for one season) were brought back to face off for an additional $100,000.

For the fourth and final series, three contestants in Adult Singer, Junior Singer, and Dance were brought back to initially compete (Comedy was dropped, jokingly because Naomi gave many comics only one star). The three brought back in each category were not necessarily the Grand Champions of their series. The show scrapped the celebrity judge and had three house judges for the entire series: [[Naomi Judd]], [[MC Lyte]], and Matti Leshem (who tried to berate contestants as [[Simon Cowell]] was doing at the time on ''[[American Idol]]'').

As in past series, two new contestants competed. With only three judges, a score of 15 stars was possible, and ties were broken by a majority vote between the three. This is where the former contestants came in. Initially, in each category, these three performers made up the "Winner's Circle". The winning challenger then had the chance to challenge one of the three performers in his or her respective winner's circle. The winner's circle performer then had to beat or tie the bar set by the challenger; ties were automatically given to the Winner's Circle performer. If they couldn't beat the score, they were out of the competition, and the challenger took his or her place in the Winner's Circle.

Halfway through the series, the three performers in each Winner's Circle competed against each other in a special show. The winner in each category not only received a trip home, but a free pass to the final show. From then on, there were only two people who could be challenged in each Winner's Circle. In the final show, the three people in each Winner's Circle competed against each other for $100,000. This, along with the Free Pass show, were the only two shows which re-adopted the at-home voting concept.

* The Adult Singer group was the only group to record a complete shutout. The three performers in the beginning were there in the end as well.
* The free pass was equally important in the other two groups as well. In both the Dance and Junior Singer categories, not only did the free pass save the winner from being challenged in an ever-changing Winner's Circle, but they ended up winning their group finals (Junior Singer Mark Mejia and Dancer Jon Cruz).
* Adult Singer and Series 1 champion Jake Simpson was challenged a record four times during his tenure in the Winner's Circle. He not only went a perfect 4–0, but he also won his group final. The only match he lost that entire season was the Winner's Circle Square-Off Special.

This remake lasted two years before its cancellation in April 2004.

At the same time, a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] called ''Star Search – Das Duell der Stars von Morgen'' was produced and aired in Germany, but with less success than the more popular show ''[[Deutschland sucht den Superstar]]'', the German version of the ''[[Idol series|Idol]]'' series.

'''''Julmahuvi''''' (julma = cruel; huvi = fun) is the name of a group of comedic actors which created several comical TV-series and [[mockumentary|mockumentaries]] for the Finnish TV-channels [[Yle TV1]] and [[MTV3]]. Julmahuvi collectively are [[Tommi Korpela]], [[Jukka Rasila]], [[Janne Reinikainen (actor)|Janne Reinikainen]], [[Petteri Summanen]] and [[Jani Volanen]].

The group first worked together on the sketch-show ''To(i)ni ja Heikki Haaman Show'' which ran from 1995 to -96 on MTV3. After this they produced the mockumentary about a fictional boyband named ''The Joyboys Story'' in 1997.

The group's most famous show was the sketch show ''Studio Julmahuvi'' which ran for 8 episodes on Yle in 1998. The show was a parody of YLE's own programming, squeezing an entire evening's worth of programming into a half-hour show which included everything from news and weather to a children's show and a German police drama, with commercials and TV-spots on the side. The show was created with an impressive budget of 67 000 € per episode which resulted in extremely high production-values (in comparison to low-budget sketch-shows like [[Pulttibois]] and [[Kummeli]]).

Afterwards Julmahuvi made ''Jerico 2000'', a parody topic-show which also reused some of the smaller mockumentaries featured in Studio Julmahuvi. It aired on MTV3 in 1999. The last big production was the mini-series ''[[Mennen Tullen]]'' which featured several characters from Studio Julmahuvi's fictional cop-shows now in the present day. It aired on YLE between 2000 and 2001. Though produced in the fashion of a serious murder-mystery it was essentially a dark comedy with occasional absurd elements.

''The Joyboys Story'' won the [[Rose d'Or|Bronze Rose of Montreux]] in 1997 and ''Studio Julmahuvi'' was awarded with the [[Venla]] (Finland's equivalent to an Emmy) prize for the best comedy show in 1999.

Studio Julmahuvi, The Joyboys Story, Jerico 2000 and Mennen tullen were all released as a box-set on DVD in 2005 with a bonus CD containing voice-clips and songs featured on ''Z-Salamapartio'', one of the fictional cop-shows set in the 1970s.

'''''TV Guide''''' is a bi-weekly [[United States|American]] [[magazine]] that provides [[television program]] [[TV listings|listings information]] as well as television-related news, celebrity interviews and gossip, film reviews, [[crossword puzzle]]s, and, in some issues, [[horoscope]]s. The print magazine is owned by NTVB Media, while its digital properties are controlled by the [[CBS Interactive]] division of [[CBS Corporation]]; the ''TV Guide'' named and associated editorial content from the publication are [[brand licensing|licensed]] by CBS Interactive for use on the website and [[mobile app]] through an agreement with the magazine's parent subsidiary TVGM Holdings, Inc.&lt;ref name="NTVB"&gt;{{cite web|title=TV Guide Magazine Sold to Publishing Firm NTVB|url=https://variety.com/2015/biz/news/tv-guide-magazine-sold-ntvb-1201612343/|author=Todd Spangler|periodical=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|date=October 7, 2015|accessdate=November 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deadline-cbstvguide"&gt;{{cite web|title=It's Official: CBS Takes Full Control Of TVGuide.Com, Acquiring Lionsgate’s 50%|url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/05/its-official-cbs-takes-full-control-of-tvguide-com-acquiring-lionsgate%E2%80%99s-50/|author=Nellie Andreeva|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|date=May 31, 2013|accessdate=March 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Prototype===
The prototype of what would become ''TV Guide'' magazine, was developed by Lee Wagner (1910–1993),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lee Wagner, 83; Founding Owner of TV Guide Magazine|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-09-14/news/mn-34969_1_tv-guide|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=Times Mirror Company|date=September 14, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was the circulation director of [[Macfadden Communications Group#Macfadden Publications|MacFadden Publications]] in [[New York City]] in the 1930s – and later, by the time of the predecessor publication's creation, for [[Cowles Media Company]] – distributing magazines focusing on movie celebrities.

In 1948, he printed New York City area listings magazine ''The TeleVision Guide'', which was first released on local newsstands on June 14 of that year. Silent film star [[Gloria Swanson]], who then starred of the short-lived [[variety show|variety series]] ''The Gloria Swanson Hour'', appeared on the cover of the first issue. Wagner later began publishing regional editions of ''The TeleVision Guide'' for [[New England]] and the [[Baltimore]]–[[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] area. Five years later, he sold the editions to [[Walter Annenberg]], who folded it into his publishing and broadcasting company [[Triangle Publications]], but remained as a consultant for the magazine until 1963.&lt;ref name="prototype"&gt;{{cite news|title=June 14, 1948: TV Guide Prototype Hits N.Y. Newsstands|url=https://www.wired.com/thisdayintech/2010/06/0614tv-guide-launches/|author=Hugh Hart|periodical=[[Wired (website)|Wired]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|date=June 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Annenberg/Triangle era===
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2018}}
The national ''TV Guide''{{'}}s first issue was released on April 3, 1953, accumulating a total circulation of 1,560,000 copies that were sold in the ten U.S. cities where it was distributed. The inaugural cover featured a photograph of [[Lucille Ball]]'s newborn son [[Desi Arnaz, Jr.]], with a downscaled inset photo of Ball placed in the top corner under the issue's headline: "Lucy's $50,000,000 baby".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TV Guide Magazine's 60th Anniversary: How Desi Arnaz Jr. Became Our First Cover Star|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/tv-guide-magazine-60-arnaz-1063463/|author=Michael Logan|website=TV Guide|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|date=April 3, 2013|accessdate=June 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine was published in [[digest size]], which remained its printed format for 52 years. From its first issue until the July 2–8, 1954, issue, listings within each edition of ''TV Guide'' began on Friday and ended on Thursday; the July 9–16, 1954, issue began on a Friday and ended on the following Friday. Then, beginning with the July 17–23, 1954, issue, the listings in each week's issue changed to start on Saturday and end on Friday, which remained the listings format for all local editions until April 2004.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} The formation of ''TV Guide'' as a national publication resulted from Triangle Publications' purchase of numerous regional television listing publications such as ''TV Forecast'' (which was circulated in the [[Chicago]] area and, upon its first publication on May 9, 1948, was the first continuously published television listings magazine), ''TV Digest'' (which was distributed in [[Philadelphia]] and [[Pittsburgh]], and was originally distributed under the title, the ''Local Televiser'', when it was first released on November 7, 1948), and the New York-based ''Television Guide'' (which had its title abbreviated to ''TV Guide'' on March 18, 1950).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1946-1949 "TV Forecast": Telling the Public About What's On the Air|url=http://www.tvhistory.tv/tv_forecast.htm|website=TVHistory.tv|accessdate=June 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pre-National TV-Magazine Launch Dates|url=http://www.tvhistory.tv/Pre%20Nat%20TV%20Guide%20Timetable.htm|website=TVHistory.tv|accessdate=June 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the cities that had their own local TV listings magazine folded into ''TV Guide'' were among the initial cities where the magazine conducted its national launch.

The launch as a national magazine with local listings in April 1953 became an almost instant success; however, the circulation decreased over subsequent weeks, even as the magazine's distribution expanded to five additional cities (Pittsburgh, [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[Detroit]], [[Cleveland]] and [[San Francisco]]) throughout the summer of 1953. By mid-August of that year, sales of the magazine had dropped 200,000 copies below that of the first issue. ''TV Guide''{{'}}s fortunes began to turn around with the September 4–10, 1953, issue – the magazine's first "Fall Preview" issue – when circulation hit 1,746,327 copies; circulation levels increased steadily over time, to the point where ''TV Guide'' eventually became the most read and circulated magazine in the United States by the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National TV Guide -  The First Years|url=http://www.tvhistory.tv/tv_guide1.htm|website=TVHistory.tv|accessdate=June 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial cost of each issue was 15¢ per copy (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|0.15|1953|r=2|fmt=c}} today; the price of each issue has gradually risen over the years, selling for $4.99 per copy as of {{currentyear}}). In addition to [[subscription business model|subscriptions]], ''TV Guide'' was sold at the checkout counters of [[grocery store]]s nationwide. Until the 1980s, the feature pieces included in each issue were promoted in a [[television commercial]]. Under Triangle, ''TV Guide'' continued to grow not only in circulation, but in recognition as the authority on television programming with articles – the majority of which typically appear in the color section – from both staff and contributing writers.

[[File:Historic TV Guide logos.png|345px|thumb|left|Past logos used by the publication (l–r): 1953–1962, 1962–1968, 1968–1988 and 1988–2003.]]
Over the decades, the shape of the ''TV Guide'' logo has changed to reflect the modernization of the [[television set|television screen]], eventually adopting a [[widescreen]] appearance in September 2003, and then to its current flatscreen appearance in September 2016 (different versions of the logo – the only cosmetic difference being the utilization of different typefaces – are currently used respectively for the magazine and the separately owned, CBS-managed digital properties). At first, the logo had various colored backgrounds (usually black, white, blue or green) until the familiar red background became the standard in the 1960s with occasional changes used for special editions.

[[File:TV Guide first issue.png|225px|thumb|right|The first issue of ''TV Guide'' (April 3, 1953), featuring [[Desi Arnaz Jr.]], the oldest of [[Lucille Ball]] (seen at upper right inset) and [[Desi Arnaz]]'s two children; Ball's pregnancy with Arnaz Jr. was incorporated into her ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' character's storyline, with his January 1953 birth coinciding with that of the fictional "Little Ricky" Ricardo.]]
The magazine was first based in a small office in downtown Philadelphia, before moving to more spacious national headquarters in [[Radnor Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Radnor]], [[Pennsylvania]], in the late 1950s. The new facility, complete with a large lighted ''TV Guide'' logo at the building's entrance, based its management, editors, production personnel and subscription processors as well as a vast computer system holding data on every television show and movie available for listing in the popular weekly publication. Printing of the national color section of ''TV Guide'' – which incorporates television-related stories, and select feature columns such as program reviews – took place at Triangle's Gravure Division plant – which was known for performing some of the highest quality printing in the industry, with almost always perfect registration – located adjacent to the company's landmark [[Inquirer Building]] on North [[Broad Street (Philadelphia)|Broad Street]] in Philadelphia. The color section was then sent to regional printers to be wrapped around the local listing sections.

In addition to ''TV Guide'' and its flagship newspaper ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', Triangle Publications also owned the ''[[Philadelphia Daily News]]''; ten radio and six television stations ([[WFIL|WFIL AM]]-[[WBEB|FM]]-[[WPVI-TV|TV]] in Philadelphia, WNHC [[WYBC (AM)|AM]]-[[WPLR|FM]]-[[WTNH|TV]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], KFRE [[KWRU|AM]]-[[KSKS|FM]]-[[KFSN-TV|TV]] in [[Fresno, California]], [[WNBF|WNBF AM]]-[[WHWK|FM]]-[[WBNG|TV]] in [[Binghamton, New York]], [[WFBG|WFBG AM]]-[[WFGY|FM]]-[[WTAJ-TV|TV]] in [[Altoona, Pennsylvania]] and [[WXBU|WLYH-TV]] in [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]]–[[Lebanon, Pennsylvania]]); ''[[The Daily Racing Form]]''; ''The Morning Telegraph''; ''[[Seventeen (American magazine)|Seventeen]]''; and various [[cable television]] interests. It was under Triangle's ownership of WFIL-TV that [[Dick Clark]] and ''[[American Bandstand]]'' came to popularity. Triangle Publications sold its Philadelphia newspapers to [[Knight Ridder|Knight Newspapers]] in 1969, its radio and television stations during the early 1970s to [[Capital Cities/ABC Inc.|Capital Cities Communications]] (the television stations that are now known as KFSN-TV and WPVI-TV were subsequently acquired by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] through its 1986 merger with Capital Cities) and various other interests, retaining only ''TV Guide'', ''Seventeen'' and ''The Daily Racing Form''.

For the magazine's first 52 years of publication, listings information was displayed in a "log" format, a mainly text-based list of programs organized by both start time and channel, which was the sole method – eventually, primary once [[prime time]] [[Grid (graphic design)|grids]] were incorporated, and later secondary for the final two years of its inclusion of local listings – of displaying program information in ''TV Guide'' until the switch to national listings in 2005; this allowed for the display of full titles for each program as well as the inclusion of synopses for movies and most programs. Most listing entries in the log included program genres (and for national news programs, [[news presenter|anchors]]) after the program's title, while its running time (which was mentioned only if a program lasted a minimum of one hour – later 35 minutes – in length) was listed in the synopses.

Originally, the majority of programs listed in the log each issue featured brief synopses, except for local and national newscasts, and programs airing on certain stations in various timeslots. As other [[terrestrial television|broadcast]] [[television station]]s and [[cable channel]]s were added, due to set space requirements for the local listings section, detailed synopses were gradually restricted to series and [[television special|specials]] – usually those airing in evening timeslots – as well as movies airing on broadcast television, while shorter synopses were used for programs seen on broadcast stations outside of the edition's home market and select cable channels; and only the title along with supplementary information (such as genre and/or program length) for most other broadcast and cable programs. In addition, black-and-white ads for programs scheduled to air on broadcast stations – and later, cable channels – during prime time (with local airtimes, and for broadcast stations, information for [[network affiliate|network-affiliated stations]] featured in the edition which were scheduled to air the advertised show) were included within the listings.

A regular feature of the listings section was "Close-Up," which provided expanded reviews of select programs airing each day (various editions of "Close-Up" were eventually used for different types of programs, from premieres of new series to shows airing on cable). Over time, other regular and recurring features (most of them television-related) were included alongside the listings including "Insider" (a television news and interview section in the lead pages of the color section); "Cheers and Jeers" (a critique page about various aspects of television programming); "Hits and Misses" (featuring brief reviews of select programs in the coming week, rated on a score from 0 to 10); "Guidelines" (a half-page daily section featuring highlights of five or six programs of interest); horoscopes; recaps of the previous week's storylines on network daytime [[soap opera]]s; a page reviewing new [[home video]] (and later, [[DVD]]) releases; dedicated pages that respectively listed select sporting events, children's programs and "four-star" movies being broadcast during that week; and crossword puzzles. Although its issues usually focus on different television-related stories week to week, ''TV Guide'' also incorporates recurring issues that appear a few times each year, most notably the "Fall Preview" (an issue featured since the magazine's inaugural year in 1953, which features reviews of new series premiering during the fall television season), "Returning Favorites" (first published in 1996, featuring previews of series renewed from the previous television season returning for the upcoming fall schedule), "Winter Preview" (first published in 1994 and later known as the "(year) TV Preview" from 2006 to 2009, featuring previews of [[midseason replacement|midseason]] series) and "The Best Children's Shows on TV" (first published in 1989 and later renamed the "Parents' Guide to Children's Television" in 1990, and finally as the "Parent's Guide to Kids' TV" in 1993, featuring stories and reviews on family-oriented programs).

Icons used for other means than identifying listed stations were first added to the magazine in 1962, denoting [[television special]]s and programs broadcast in [[color television|color]]. ''TV Guide'' modified all icons incorporated into the local listings section in May 1969, changing the font for the bullets identifying local stations from [[Futura (typeface)|Futura]] to the standard [[Helvetica]] and extending the TV-shaped bullets to denote color programs (replacing the bar/text icons that had been used for the previous seven years); as color programming became more ubiquitous, in August 1972, the magazine opted to instead included identifying programs originating in [[black and white]] (marked under the abbreviation "BW"). In September 1981, listings began to identify programs presented with [[closed captioning|closed or open captions]] or with on-screen [[sign language]] interpretation.

====Addition of cable listings====
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}
The advent of cable television would become hard on ''TV Guide''. Cable channels began to be listed in the magazine in 1980 or 1981, depending on the edition; the channels listed also differed with the corresponding edition. Regional and national [[superstation]]s available on cable systems in the designated market of many editions were the only cable channels listed initially as well as, in certain markets, over-the-air subscription services transmitted over local [[Independent station (North America)|independent stations]] (such as [[ONTV (pay TV)|ONTV]]); local subscription television services were often listed as "STV Programming" or "Subscription Television" for the channel carrying the service, with the service listed separately or, in some editions, not at all. Cable-originated channels – such as [[HBO]], [[CNN]] (both of which the magazine originally promoted mainly in full-page advertisements), the CBN Cable Network (now [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]]), the [[Alpha Repertory Television Service]] (ARTS, since succeeded by [[A&amp;E (TV channel)|A&amp;E]]) and [[Nickelodeon]] – were added gradually between the winter of late 1981 and the first half of 1982, depending on the edition.

To save channel space, ''TV Guide'' incorporated a grid (a rowed display of listings for programs scheduled to air during the evening hours each night, primarily organized by channel) into the listings in September 1981, which was slotted at a random page within each day's afternoon listings. The grid originated as a single-page feature that provided a summary of programs airing during prime time (from 7:00 to 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. or 8:00 to 11:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. depending on the start of prime time within a given [[time zone]]) on the stations mentioned in the corresponding edition; by 1985, it was expanded to a two-page section – which began to take up roughly three-quarters of the two adjoining pages on which it was placed – that included programs airing during the [[dayparting|early access and late fringe]] periods (from 5:00 to 11:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. or 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. to 12:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. local time), with the beginning and end of the magazine-defined prime time daypart (between 7:30 and 11:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. or between 6:30 and 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. local time on Monday through Saturdays, and between 7:00 and 11:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. or between 6:00 and 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. local time on Sundays) delineated by a thicker border. Channels listed in the grid were organized by broadcast stations, basic cable channels, and premium channels.

In August 1982, the magazine expanded its coverage of cable programming with the introduction of two feature sections. The first, the "CablePay Section," was a separate color insert that followed the Friday listings, which provided highlights of programs airing on the national basic and premium cable channels (this feature was discontinued in 1985, at which time, cable program highlights were folded into the "Guidelines" feature). The second feature, the "Cable and Pay-TV Movie Guide" (later renamed the "Pay-TV Movie Guide" in 1984 and "Premium Channels Movie Guide" in 1997), initially followed the "CablePay" insert before being moved to the pages immediately following the Friday listings in May 1985, resulting in the national section – which had been cordoned into two sections, both preceding and following the local section – being consolidated into the first half of the pages comprising each issue. The "Movie Guide," which encompassed the final pages of each edition, provided summaries of films scheduled to air over the next one to two weeks on the cable channels included in both the log ''and'' grid listings (excluding those featured exclusively in the grids) as well as a first-page summary of the films scheduled to premiere that week (arranged by channel and sub-categorized by title). As the years went on, more cable channels were added into the listings of each edition. To help offset this, the May 11–17, 1985, issue introduced a smaller Helvetica font for the log, along with some other cosmetic changes; in particular, a show's length began to be listed after the show's title instead of at the end of its synopsis. That issue also saw advertising for local stations featured in the corresponding edition be restricted to certain special events, with most program promotions being restricted to those for national broadcast and cable networks.

===News Corporation and Gemstar eras===
On August 7, 1988, Triangle Publications was sold to the News America Corporation arm of [[News Corporation]] for $3 billion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Murdoch to Buy ''TV Guide'' in $3B Deal|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8074051.html|author=Robert Lenzner|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|publisher=Affiliated Publications|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|date=August 8, 1988|accessdate=February 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Murdoch To Purchase 3 Publications; $3 Billion Deal Includes TV Guide|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1272310.html|author=Jerry Knight|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[Graham Media Group|The Washington Post Company]]|via=HighBeam Research|date=August 8, 1988|accessdate=February 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the largest media acquisitions of the time and the most expensive publication transaction at the time. The November 3–9, 1990, issue saw the addition of [[Video recorder scheduling code|VCR Plus+]] codes in some of the magazine's regional editions, in order for users with devices incorporating the technology – which was developed by eventual ''TV Guide'' parent Gemstar International Group Ltd. – to input into their VCRs to automatically record television programs. (Two-digit PlusCodes corresponding to the channel airing the program that a user wished to record were listed after each channel in the channel directory page; six- to eight-digit codes for individual programs were listed in the log listings section following the title of each program.) The PlusCodes expanded to all local editions beginning with the September 14–20, 1991, issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Codes for TV Listings|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/25/nyregion/codes-for-tv-listings.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 25, 1990|accessdate=June 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Systems Make It Easier to Program VCR|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-11-16/entertainment/ca-4529_1_vcr-programming-systems|author=Dennis Hunt|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Times Mirror Company]]|date=November 16, 1990|accessdate=June 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=`1-step` Videotaping At Last, A Vcr Even A Complete Idiot Could Program.

On March 7, 1996, ''TV Guide'' launched the iGuide, originally developed by the News Corporation-[[MCI Communications|MCI]] [[joint venture]] Delphi Internet Service Corp. as a [[web portal]], which featured more comprehensive television listings data than those offered by the magazine (with information running two weeks in advance of the present date), as well as news content, ''TV Guide'' editorial content and a search feature called CineBooks, which allowed users to access detailed information on about 30,000 film titles. Later that year, content from the print publication was added to iGuide as well as content from News Corporation's other media properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IGUIDE UNVEILS TV LISTINGS|url=http://adage.com/article/news/iguide-unveils-tv-listings/1684/|periodical=AdAge|publisher=Crain Communications|date=March 8, 1996|accessdate=June 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FULL TV GUIDE AVAILABLE ONLINE|url=http://adage.com/article/news/full-tv-guide-online/1891/|periodical=[[AdAge]]|publisher=[[Crain Communications]]|date=May 8, 1996|accessdate=June 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 13, 1997, shortly before MCI bowed out of the venture, iGuide was relaunched as the TV Guide Entertainment Network (TVGEN), which was renamed TV Guide Online in 2002. The refocused site covered television, music, movies and sports (with content concerning the latter sourced from [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]]), along with wire news and features from [[Reuters]], ''[[Variety (magazine)|Daily Variety]]'' and ''[[The New York Post]]'', free e-mail updates for registered users, and a chat room that was developed to accommodate 5,000 users simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NEWS CORP.

Additional changes to the listings took place with the September 14–20, 1996 edition of the print publication. Starting with that issue, program titles switched from being displayed in all-uppercase to being shown in a mixed case, [[Franklin Gothic]] typeface, film titles – which had previously been displayed within the film description – began appearing before a film's synopsis in an italicized format (replacing the generic "MOVIE" header that had been used to identify films since the magazine's inception), and children's programs that were compliant with the [[Children's Television Act|Children's Television Act of 1990]] began to be designated by a circular "[[E/I]]" icon. In addition, [[infomercial]]s (which had been designated under the boilerplate title "COMMERCIAL PROGRAM[S]" until 1994, and "INFORMERCIAL[S]" thereafter) ceased being listed in the magazine during time periods in which stations aired them. (Time-brokered programs continued to be listed in the magazine, but were primarily restricted to religious programming.) Replacing the text identifiers that had been included within the film synopses, theatrically released films also began to be identified by a black-and-white boxed "M" symbol, accompanied depending on the film by its [[Star (classification)#Films|star rating]] (a formula, on a scale of one [for "poor"] to four [for "excellent"], based on a consensus of reviews from leading film critics, the quality of the film's cast and director, and the film's box office revenue and award wins). Movie icons also were appropriated to identify direct-to-video (marked as "M→V") or made-for-TV (marked as "M→T") releases, which were not assigned star ratings. Beginning with the January 25–31, 1997, issue, the log listings began incorporating content ratings for programs assigned through the newly implemented [[TV Parental Guidelines]] system (the system's content ratings were subsequently added upon their introduction in October 1998).

News Corporation sold ''TV Guide'' to the United Video Satellite Group, parent company of [[Pop (U.S. TV network)|Prevue Networks]], on June 11, 1998, for $800 million and 60 million shares of stock worth an additional $1.2 billion (this followed an earlier merger attempt between the two companies in 1996 that eventually fell apart).&lt;ref name="Gemstar"&gt;{{cite news|title=News Lite: TV Guide Deal Sets Up Broadcast Opportunity|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-83826997.html|newspaper=[[Daily News (Los Angeles)|Los Angeles Daily News]]|publisher=[[MediaNews Group]]|via=HighBeam Research|date=June 12, 1998|accessdate=February 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=United Video, News Corp. call the whole thing off; TV Guide, Preview Guide merger collapses|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18640352.html|author=Richard Tedesco|periodical=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|publisher=[[Reed Business Information|Cahners Business Information]]|via=HighBeam Research|date=September 2, 1996|accessdate=February 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the sale, reports suggested that ''TV Guide'' would remove program listings from the magazine, shifting them entirely to its new sister cable network Prevue Channel, which would be rebranded as a result of United Video's purchase of ''TV Guide'' magazine; News Corporation executives later stated that listings information would remain part of the magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=TV Guide says listings will remain a part of the magazine|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-19756649.html|agency=[[Associated Press]]|via=HighBeam Research|date=June 12, 1998|accessdate=February 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, United Video acquired TVSM Inc. (publishers of competing listings guides ''Total TV'' and ''The Cable Guide'') in a $75 million all-cash acquisition; as a result, ''TV Guide'' merged with ''Total TV'', and began printing a version of the magazine in the latter magazine's full-size format (while retaining the original digest size version) effective with the July 11, 1998, issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The $2 Billion Acquisition of TV Guide|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-53557420.html|author=Tony Silber|periodical=[[Folio (magazine)|Folio]]|publisher=[[American University]]|via=HighBeam Research|date=January 1, 1999|accessdate=February 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='TV Guide' Wraps 'Total TV,' Launches Full-Sized Version|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-50182777.html|author=Jim Forkan|periodical=[[Multichannel News]]|publisher=Cahners Business Information|via=HighBeam Research|date=July 6, 1998|accessdate=February 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because most cable systems published their own listing magazine reflecting their channel lineup, and now had a separate guide channel or an [[electronic program guide]] that can be activated by remote and provide the same information in a more detailed manner – with additional competition coming in the late 1990s from websites that also specialize in providing detailed television program information (such as TVGuide.com, then jointly operated with ''TV Guide Magazine'', and [[Screener (website)|Zap2It]]), a printed listing of programming in a separate magazine became less valuable. The sheer amount and diversity of cable television programming made it hard for ''TV Guide'' to provide listings of the extensive array of programming that came directly over the cable system. ''TV Guide'' also could not match the ability of the [[Cable box (electronics)|cable box]] to store personalized listings. Nevertheless, beginning with the September 12–18, 1998, issue, the magazine added several new channels to many of its editions, including those that had previously been mentioned only in a foreword on the channel lineup page as well as those that were available mainly on [[digital cable]] and satellite; although most of these newly added channels were placed within the prime time grids, only a few (such as [[Animal Planet]] and [[MSNBC]]) were also incorporated into the log listings.

Features in the magazine were also revamped with the additions of "The Robins Report" (a review column by writer J. Max Robins), "Family Page" (featuring reviews of family-oriented programs) and picks of select classic films airing that week, as well as the removal of the "Guidelines" feature in the listings section in favor of the new highlight page "Don't Miss" (listing choice programs selected by the magazine's staff for the coming week) in the national color section. Listings for movies within the log also began identifying [[television film|made-for-TV]] and [[direct-to-video]] films, as well as quality ratings on a scale of one to four stars (signifying movies that have received "poor" to "excellent" reviews).

In 1999, the magazine began hosting the ''[[TV Guide Award]]s'', an awards show (which was telecast on Fox) honoring television programs and actors, with the winners being chosen by ''TV Guide'' subscribers through a nominee ballot inserted in the magazine; the telecast was discontinued after the 2001 event. The July 17–23, 1999, edition saw the evening grids be scaled down to the designated prime time hours, 8:00 to 11:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. (or 7:00 to 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.) Monday through Saturdays and 7:00 to 11:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. (or 6:00 to 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.) on Sundays, to compliment the descriptive log listings for those time periods; this also allowed the grids to be contained to a single page in certain editions that provided listings for more than 20 cable channels.

On October 5, 1999, [[Gemstar-TV Guide International|Gemstar International Group Ltd.]], the maker of the [[Video recorder scheduling code|VCR Plus+]] device and schedule system (whose channel and program codes for [[Videocassette recorder|VCR]]s using the system for timed recordings were incorporated into the magazine's listings in 1988), and which incidentally was partially owned by News Corporation, purchased United Video Satellite Group; the two companies had previously been involved in a legal battle over the [[intellectual property]] rights for their respective interactive program guide systems, VCR Plus+ and [[Guide Plus|TV Guide On Screen]], that began in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Electronic Rival To Buy TV Guide|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-629280.html|author=Bob Tourtellotte|newspaper=The Washington Post|publisher=The Washington Post Company|via=HighBeam Research|date=October 5, 1999|accessdate=February 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tourtellotte"&gt;{{cite news|title=Analyst: IPG fight may soon be over|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-55780634.html|author=Price Colman|periodical=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|publisher=Cahners Business Information|via=HighBeam Research|date=September 6, 1999|accessdate=February 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; That month, ''TV Guide'' debuted a 16-page insert into editions in 22 markets with large [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]] populations titled ''TV Guide en Español'', which provided programming information from national [[Spanish language]] networks (such as [[Univision]] and [[Telemundo]]) as well as special sections with reviews of the week's notable programs. The magazine discontinued the insert in March 2000 due to difficulties resulting from confusion by advertisers over its marketing as "the first weekly Spanish-language magazine," despite its structure as an insert within the main ''TV Guide'' publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=TV Guide Rethinks Spanish-language Insert|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2000-03-29/lifestyle/0003280484_1_tv-guide-latin-tv-latin-america|author=Magaly Morales|newspaper=[[Sun-Sentinel|Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel]]|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|date=March 29, 2000|accessdate=July 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To commemorate the 50th anniversary of ''TV Guide'' as a national magazine, in 2002, the magazine published six special issues:
* "TV We'll Always Remember'' (April 6–12): Our Favorite Stars Share Fifty Years of Memories, Moments and Magic"
* "[[TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time|50 Greatest Shows of All Time]]'' (May 4–10): The Ultimate List of the 50 Best TV Series. (Just Try to Guess What's No. 1!)"
** '''Note''': This was the only one to be presented on television itself (in the form of a two-hour special) and referenced in the book ''TV Guide: Fifty Years of Television'', considering the magazine's purpose to present weekly listings of regularly scheduled series.
* "Our 50 Greatest Covers of All Time (June 15–21): Fabulous Photos of Your Favorite Shows and Stars Plus: Amazing Behind-the-Scenes Stories"
* "50 Worst Shows of All Time (July 20–26): Not Just Bad! Really Awful – And We Love Them That Way!"
* "50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time (August 3–9): Funny! Clever! Drawn to perfection! They're the tops in toons!"
* "50 Sexiest Stars of All Time (September 28–October 4): Charisma, Curves, Confidence, Charm! Could We Be Having Any More Fun?"

By 2003, the number of cable channels that were only listed in the grids expanded, with the addition of channels such as BBC America, [[Soapnet]] and the [[National Geographic Channel]] (some editions also featured a limited amount of broadcast stations – either in-market, out-of-market or both – exclusively in the grids); conversely, sister cable network [[Pop (U.S. TV channel)|TV Guide Channel]] (whose listings were added to the magazine after the Gemstar purchase) was relegated from the log listings to the grids in most editions. From its inception until 2003, ''TV Guide'' had offered listings for the entire week, 24 hours a day. Numerous changes to the local listings took place beginning with the June 21, 2003 issue – in just a few select markets, when the 5:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 5:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. Monday through Friday listings were condensed down to four grids: these ran from 5:00 to 8:00&amp;nbsp;a.m., 8:00 to 11:00&amp;nbsp;a.m., 11:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., and 2:00 to 5:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. If programming differed from one weekday to the next, the generic descriptor "Various Programs" was listed. The weekday grid maintained day-to-day listings for certain cable channels (primarily [[movie channels]] as well as a limited number of basic cable channels such as [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]], [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] and [[USA Network]]), which were organized separately from the other channels. These changes became permanent in all ''TV Guide'' editions beginning with the September 13, 2003, "Fall Preview" issue.

Other changes were made to the magazine beginning with the June 21 issue in select markets and the 2003 "Fall Preview" issue elsewhere. A half-page daily prime time highlights section featuring the evening's notable shows, movies and sports events – similar to the former "Guidelines" feature – was re-added to the listings section; a full-page "Weekday Highlights" page was also added featuring guest and topical information for the week's [[daytime television|daytime]] [[talk show|talk]] and [[breakfast television|morning shows]] as well as picks for movies airing during the day on broadcast and cable channels. In addition, while log listings continued in use for prime time listings, program synopses were added to the grids and log, as well as a "''NEW''" indicator for first-run episodes, replacing the "(Repeat)" indicator in the log's synopses. The "Premium Channels Movie Guide" was also restructured as "The Big Movie Guide," with film listings being expanded to include those airing on all broadcast networks and cable channels featured in each edition (as well as some that were not listed in a particular local edition), as well as movies that were available on [[pay-per-view]] (page references to the films included in this section were also incorporated into the prime time grids and log listings). Beginning in January 2004, the midnight to 5:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. listings (as well as the Saturday and Sunday 5:00 to 8:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. listings) ceased to include any broadcast stations outside of the edition's home market, leaving only program information for stations within the home market and for cable channels.

The magazine's format was changed beginning with the April 11, 2004, issue to start the week's listings in each issue on Sunday (the day in which television listings magazines supplemented in [[newspaper]]s traditionally began each week's listings information), rather than Saturday. In July 2004, the overnight listings were removed entirely, replaced by a grid that ran from 11:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. to 2:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. that included only the broadcast stations in each edition's home market and a handful of cable channels. It also listed a small selection of late-night movies airing on certain channels. The time period of the listings in the daytime grids also shifted from starting at 5:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. and ending at 5:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. to running from 7:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. By this point, the log listings were restricted to programs airing from 7:00 to 11:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. In early 2005, more channels were added to the prime time and late-night grids.

====Format overhaul and conversion to national listings====
[[File:TV Guide Logo.png|thumb|right|165px|Former logo used from 2003 to 2016; the current logo is based on this design.]]
On July 26, 2005, Gemstar-TV Guide announced that ''TV Guide'' would abandon its longtime digest size format and begin printing as a larger full-size national magazine that would offer more stories and fewer program listings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=TV Guide Remaking Itself With Large Format|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-111476865.html|author=Seth Sutel|agency=Associated Press|via=HighBeam Research|date=July 26, 2005|accessdate=February 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; All 140 local editions were eliminated, being replaced by two editions covering the time zones within the [[contiguous United States]]: one for the [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]] and [[Central Time Zone|Central]] time zones, and one for the [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific]] and [[Mountain Time Zone|Mountain]] time zones (which had existed separately from the local editions prior to the change, although their distribution was primarily limited to [[hotel]]s). The change in format was attributed to the increase in the [[internet]], cable television channels (like TV Guide Network), electronic program guides and [[digital video recorders]] as the sources of choice for viewers' program listings. The new version of ''TV Guide'' went on sale on October 17, 2005, and featured ''[[Extreme Makeover: Home Edition]]'' host [[Ty Pennington]] on the cover. The listings format, now consisting entirely of grids, also changed to start the listings in each week's issue on Monday rather than Sunday. As a result of the elimination of the local editions, broadcast stations were replaced by broadcast network schedules with the description "[[Local programming|Local Programming]]" being used to denote time periods in which [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]], locally produced or [[infomercial|paid]] programs would air instead of network shows.

In September 2006, ''TV Guide'' launched a redesigned [[website]], with expanded original editorial and user-generated content not included in the print magazine. On December 22, 2006, ''TV Guide'' introduced the magazine's first ever two-week edition. The edition, which featured [[Rachael Ray]] on the cover, was issued for the period from [[Christmas|December 25]], 2006 to January 7, 2007. In early 2008, the Monday through Friday daytime and daily late night grids were eliminated from the listings section, and the television highlights section was compressed into a six-page review of the week, rather than the previous two pages for each night. By 2007, ''TV Guide''{{'}}s circulation had decreased to less than three million copies from a peak of almost 20 million in 1970.

With the $2.8 billion acquisition of Gemstar-TV Guide by [[Macrovision]] on May 2, 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Macrovision to purchase TV Guide Gemstar fetches $2.8 billion|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-11406880.html|author=Michael Liedtke|newspaper=[[Oakland Tribune]]|publisher=[[Bay Area News Group|ANG Newspapers]]|via=HighBeam Research|date=December 8, 2007|accessdate=February 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; that company, which purchased the former mostly to take advantage of their lucrative and profitable VCR Plus and electronic program guide [[patent]]s, stated it wanted to sell both the magazine and TV Guide Network, along with the company's [[horse racing]] channel [[TVG Network]] to other parties.

====TV Guide Talk====
On May 18, 2005, ''TV Guide Talk'', a weekly [[podcast]] that was available to download for free, was launched. The podcast was headlined by ''TV Guide'' reporter/personality [[Michael Ausiello]], and was co-hosted by his colleagues at the magazine, Matt Webb Mitovich,&lt;ref&gt;[http://community.tvguide.com/blog-entry/TVGuide-News-Blog/Todays-News/Matt-Webb-Mitovich/800018104] {{Dead link |date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Angel Cohn, Daniel Manu and [[Maitland McDonagh]]. Each episode featured commentary from TV Guide staff on the week's entertainment news stories, television programs, and film releases, as well as occasional interviews with actors, producers, and executives. On April 4, 2008 (following Ausiello's move to ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''), it was announced that the podcast would be ending,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080407215150/http://community.tvguide.com/blog-entry/TVGuide-Editors-Blog/Tv-Mattrs/Tv-Guide-Talk/800036873 The TV Guide Talk Podcast Is Signing Off - TV Matt'rs | TVGuide.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and the final episode (Episode No. 139) was released on April 10, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080414173548/http://community.tvguide.com/blog-entry/TVGuide-Editors-Blog/Tv-Mattrs/Tv-Guide-Talk/800037209 TV Guide Talk Episode No. 139 Is Now Live! - TV Matt'rs | TVGuide.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

TV Guide Talk podcasts were released every Friday afternoon and averaged an hour in length. They featured the participants discussing and commenting on the past week in television and the entertainment industry in general. The beginning of each podcast was devoted to in-depth discussion on the week's biggest new story in the entertainment industry, whether it be a television program or something outside the scope of television show or movie (such as the [[Academy Awards]] or the [[Emmys]]). The middle part was devoted to discussion and commentary on individual shows. The podcast emphasized programs that tend to have a large online following even if that following is not necessarily reflected in the programs' Nielsen rating.  Examples include ''[[American Idol]]'', ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]'', ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', ''[[Survivor (US TV series)|Survivor]]'', ''[[Gilmore Girls]]'', ''[[Veronica Mars]]'', and ''[[Project Runway]]'' (the latter three being examples a low-rated shows which nevertheless have sizable online followings). Each podcast also ended with a weekly review of that weekend's new theatrical releases.

===OpenGate Capital era===
On October 13, 2008, Macrovision sold the money-losing magazine (which was reportedly posting revenue losses of $20 million per year by that point) to [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]]-based equity fund [[OpenGate Capital]] for $1, and a $9.5 million loan at 3% interest.&lt;ref name="OpenGate"&gt;{{cite web|title=TV Guide Sold for a Buck|url=http://adage.com/mediaworks/article?article_id=131756|author=Nat Ives|website=[[Advertising Age]]|publisher=[[Crain Communications]]|date=October 15, 2008|accessdate=July 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the sale, however, Macrovision retained ownership of the companion website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TV Guide, Once Master of the Airwaves, Tries to Survive in a Competitive Category|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/08/business/media/08guide.html?_r=1&amp;ref=television|author=Stephanie Clifford|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=December 8, 2008|accessdate=March 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; – which was then sold to equity firm [[One Equity Partners]] for $300 million –&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Macrovision Is Selling TV Guide Network Listings|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/19/business/media/19guide.html|author=[[Brian Stelter]]|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=December 18, 2008|accessdate=November 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Macrovision, Allen Shapiro and One Equity Partners Announce Agreement for Sale of TV Guide Network|url=http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/home/permalink/?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20081218005522&amp;newsLang=en|publisher=Macrovision|via=[[BusinessWire]]|date=December 12, 2008|accessdate=July 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which severed all editorial connections between the magazine and website, including the end of critic Matt Roush's presence on TVGuide.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Where in the World Is Matt (Roush)?|url=http://www.tvguide.com/Roush/Where-Matt-Roush-1000790.aspx|website=TV Guide|publisher=One Equity Partners|date=December 12, 2008|accessdate=April 27, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203105814/http://www.tvguide.com/roush/where-matt-roush-1000790.aspx|archivedate=December 3, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The editorial content of the magazine was launched on a new site, TVGuideMagazine.com, which did not feature ''TV Guide''{{'}}s listings in any form. TVGuideMagazine.com was later shut down on June 1, 2010; ''TV Guide'' magazine and TVGuide.com then entered into a deal to restore content from the magazine to the latter website,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TV Guide Teams with Its Former Website and Network|url=http://adage.com/article/media/tv-guide-magazine-teams-website-network/144025/|author=Nat Ives|periodical=Advertising Age|publisher=Crain Communications|date=May 21, 2010|accessdate=July 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which [[Lions Gate Entertainment|Lionsgate Entertainment]] had bought along with the TV Guide Network in January 2009.&lt;ref name="LionsgateTVGuide"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lions Gate Swallows TV Guide|url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/jan2009/tc2009015_442530.htm|author=Ron Grover|website=[[Bloomberg Businessweek|Businessweek]]|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]]|date=January 6, 2009|accessdate=July 17, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115154140/http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/jan2009/tc2009015_442530.htm|archivedate=January 15, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, the magazine cut several networks from its grid listings – including MTV and [[DIY Network]] – citing "space concerns"; however, two cuts, those of [[The CW]] and TV Guide Network,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TV Guide drops CW, MTV listings|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117998414.html?categoryid=2554&amp;cs=1|author=Michael Schneider|periodical=Variety|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=January 12, 2009|accessdate=July 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dave on Demand: Mentalist showed powers only in ratings|url=http://www.philly.com/inquirer/columnists/20090110_Dave_on_Demand___Mentalist__showed_powers_only_in_ratings.html|author=David Hiltbrand|newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|publisher=Philadelphia Media Holdings, Inc.|date=January 10, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211091955/http://www.philly.com/inquirer/columnists/20090110_Dave_on_Demand___Mentalist__showed_powers_only_in_ratings.html|archivedate=February 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; were seen as suspicious and arbitrary, as the magazine carries several channels which have the same schedule night after night or have low viewership and could have easily been cut, while several [[Fox Entertainment Group|Fox]]-owned networks continued to be listed due to agreements with the former News Corporation ownership. It is likely that TV Guide Network's removal from ''TV Guide''{{'}}s listings was related to the "divorce" of the website and network from the magazine. In early February 2009, The CW and MTV were brought back to the listings after the magazine received numerous emails protesting the move; as a consequence, listings for several low-rated networks were removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TV Guide relists CW, MTV shows|url=https://variety.com/2009/biz/markets-festivals/tv-guide-relists-cw-mtv-shows-1117999586/|author=Michael Schenider|periodical=Variety|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=February 4, 2009|accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other channels previously incorporated into the listings before their removal were slowly re-added, until TV Guide Network's schedule returned to the listings pages in June 2010 with its logo prominent within the grids as part of the deal with Lionsgate's TV Guide division. Under OpenGate ownership, ''TV Guide'' slowly returned to profitability mainly through cost reductions instituted by its venture capital parent, making significant staffing reductions and switching to bi-weekly editions full-time, reducing the number of issues it published to 29 per year.

In March 2013, [[CBS Corporation]] acquired One Equity Partners' stake of their TV Guide assets.&lt;ref name="deadline-cbspoisedtvguide"&gt;{{cite web|title=CBS Poised To Buy Half Of TV Guide, Partner With Lionsgate|url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/03/cbs-acquiring-tv-guide-partner-with-lionsgate/|author=Nellie Andreeva|website=Deadline Hollywood|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|date=March 22, 2013|accessdate=March 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CBS acquisition was finalized later that month for $100 million.&lt;ref name="deadline-cbstvguide"/&gt; On May 31, 2013, CBS bought Lionsgate's share of TV Guide Digital, which includes the website and [[mobile app]]s.&lt;ref name="deadline-cbstvguide"/&gt; On January 31, 2014, OpenGate Capital and [[CBS Interactive]] announced a deal to cross-promote ''TV Guide Magazine'' with TVGuide.com and CBS Interactive's other internet properties (including [[TV.com]], [[Metacritic]] and [[CNET]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Through Two Owners, TV Guide Print and Digital Content Comes Together|url=http://www.minonline.com/news/Through-Two-Owners-TV-Guide-Print-and-Digital-Content-Comes-Together_23673.html|author=Arti Patel|website=MIN|publisher=Access Intelligence, LLC|date=January 31, 2014|accessdate=March 28, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140309103854/http://www.minonline.com/news/Through-Two-Owners-TV-Guide-Print-and-Digital-Content-Comes-Together_23673.html|archive-date=March 9, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Shift towards features====
On June 26, 2014, OpenGate Capital announced that ''TV Guide'' would undergo a major redesign beginning with the August 11 issue; the magazine eliminated 14 pages of listings, with the listings pages that remained displaying programming information for only top-rated broadcast and cable networks. It also added "enhanced editorial features," including recommendation sections focusing on traditional television and online programming – such as additional content from senior critic Matt Roush (an expanded "Roush Review" column and an additional column featuring ten picks for each week's programs as selected by Roush) and several new sections ("Upfront," featuring trending television-related stories, infographics, question-and-answer coluumns and [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] charts; "The Guide," containing expanded highlights for each day's television programming, including sports, daytime programming and content available for [[streaming media|streaming]] online; a monthly television-related technology column; "The TV Guide Interview," an occasional feature featuring celebrity interviews focusing on their career; and "On Demand," a review column of movies premiering through streaming and [[video on demand|on-demand]] services). In addition, the magazine's size was reduced from 7³/₈×10¼ inches to 7×10 inches in a cost-saving measure; it also began to be distributed in airport newsstands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Changes in store for TV Guide|url=https://nypost.com/2014/06/26/changes-in-store-for-tv-guide/|author=Keith J.

===Sale to NTVB Media===
On October 8, 2015, OpenGate Capital sold the magazine and co-owned website TVInsider.com to [[Troy, Michigan]]-based publishing company NTVB Media for an undisclosed amount, marking ''TV Guide''{{'}}s third ownership transaction in eight years (OpenGate managing partner Andrew Nikou stated that the purchase price was for "more than $1 and less than $3 billion," while estimates from other industry sources stated that the magazine sold for a price within the range of $12 million). TVGM Holdings [[chief executive officer]] David J. Fishman and [[chief financial officer]] Joe Clemente as well as the remainder of the magazine's 62-person staff will remain with the company; the magazine's corporate offices in New York City, Los Angeles and [[Newtown Square, Pennsylvania]] will also remain in operation – the former two of which also continue to base the magazine's editorial staff.&lt;ref name="NTVB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Troy company buys TV Guide magazine|url=http://www.freep.com/story/money/business/michigan/2015/10/07/tv-guide-sold/73514710/|author=Frank Witsil|newspaper=[[Detroit Free Press]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|date=October 8, 2015|accessdate=November 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The acquisition made NTVB Media the largest owner of consumer television publications in the United States, with a combined reach of more than 20 million readers. NTVB already owned ''TV Weekly'' and ''Channel Guide'', both of which provide national editorial content and – through syndication agreements with 160+ newspapers throughout the country, in which they are distributed as supplementary publications incorporated within each paper's Sunday editions – listings customized for individual regions (the company began distributing its listings magazines in this manner in 2008, as newspapers began to cease publication of their proprietary television listings magazines due to cost-cutting measures spurred by declining circulation and revenue); it also publishes listings publications for pay television providers such as [[Comcast]], [[Time Warner Cable]] and [[Dish Network]]. As such, it is undetermined whether NTVB will reach deals to distribute ''TV Guide'' to newspapers on a separate basis or extend the name to its existing television publications. Staff with ''TV Guide'' and NTVB's other titles will collaborate on feature content included in the respective magazines, while the company will fold advertising sales for the magazine with its existing television magazine titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TV Guide has been sold, yet again|url=http://www.medialifemagazine.com/tv-guide-has-been-sold-yet-again/|author=Bill Cromwell|periodical=Media Life Magazine|date=October 8, 2015|accessdate=November 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TV Guide Magazine Sold to NTVB Media|url=https://www.thewrap.com/tv-guide-magazine-sold-to-ntvb-media/|author=Jordan Chariton|website=The Wrap|publisher=The Wrap Media, LLC|date=October 7, 2015|accessdate=November 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TV Guide Magazine is sold for the third time in less than 10 years to NTVB Media|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-tv-guide-magazine-sale-ntvb-media-20151007-story.html|author=Stephen Battaglio|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=October 7, 2015|accessdate=November 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editions==
{{main|List of TV Guide editions}}
From the magazine's inception until the October 2005 conversion to national listings based on time zone, ''TV Guide'' maintained a local-national hybrid format with local editions tailored to a specific region or individual [[media market|market]]. Each regional edition generally served either a single city or a designated region (comprising the largest market[s] served by the edition and one or more smaller, adjacent markets, or a single or multiple neighboring [[U.S. state|states]] or [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]]). [[South Dakota]], [[Delaware]] and the [[Territories of the United States|U.S. territories]] did not have their own editions during the local listings era. In the case of the two U.S. states, [[Rapid City, South Dakota|Rapid City]] and [[Sioux Falls, South Dakota]] (which had their corresponding television stations listed in the Northern Colorado and Nebraska statewide editions, respectively), were presumably both considered too small to have their own editions and were located too far away from one another to be included in one edition; Delaware is split between two markets – [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle]] and [[Kent County, Delaware|Kent]] counties are part of the Philadelphia market (which comprised two editions, the regional Southeast Pennsylvania edition and a market-specific edition for the Philadelphia area), while [[Sussex County, Delaware|Sussex County]] is part of the [[Salisbury, Maryland]], market (which had its stations listed in the Washington-Baltimore edition until 1994, and the Baltimore edition thereafter). Some editions that once provided statewide listings were eventually split off into separate editions that only provided listings for a specific region; in addition, certain markets have been added or dropped from some editions.

By the mid-1990s, nearly 150 editions of the magazine were published; during that decade, ''TV Guide'' began to diversify its editions from those for individual cities and multiple media markets within a given state or multi-state region to include editions for certain cable providers in larger television markets&lt;ref name="moss"&gt;{{cite web|title=TV Guide launches Continental editions. (cable-system-specific editions for Continental Cablevision Inc.).|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18691818.html|author=Linda Moss|periodical=Multichannel News|publisher=Cahners Business Information|via=HighBeam Research|date=August 5, 1996|accessdate=February 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; – which were later branded as "Ultimate Cable" editions – as well as editions for [[direct broadcast satellite|satellite]] providers such as [[DirecTV]] and Dish Network (which were published in addition to the listings magazines that both providers produced themselves).

}}
Each channel in the listings section was designated by a [[Bullet (typography)|bullet]], which, like the magazine's logo, appeared in the shape of a television screen. Bullets used for broadcast stations contained a channel number, which had a different layout depending on the identified channel, and were often used in network promotional ads included to identify local affiliates carrying the advertised program. Filled black bullets with a white number overlaid on them designed local broadcast stations located in one of the primary market areas served by a specific edition; white bullets with a black screen outline indicated stations in outlying secondary markets covered by the corresponding edition. Out-of-market stations featured an alphanumeric identifier (with a letter next to the channel number) to disambiguate it from a local station, particularly in feature pages preceding the main listings (such as in the Northern Wisconsin edition, in which "6M" was used to disambiguate [[WLUC-TV]] in [[Marquette, Michigan]], from [[WITI (TV)|WITI]] in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]], which only used a "6" as its identifier).

There were some exceptions to this formatting. For example, the [[Hawaii]] edition had the primary [[Honolulu]]-based stations listed first, followed by their satellite sister stations, while the [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], edition had that market's primary stations listed first, followed by the out-of-market outlets; the latter being unique with having the other stations listed below [[WPGH-TV|WPGH]] (channel 53) when it listed a show during non-network hours, and during a network-scheduled lineup – in this case, NBC – the primary station and channel being listed first – [[WPXI]] (11), followed by [[WJAC-TV]]/[[Johnstown, Pennsylvania|Johnstown]] (6), [[WTOV-TV]]/[[Steubenville, Ohio|Steubenville]] (9), [[WBOY-TV]]/[[Clarksburg, West Virginia]] (12) and [[WFMJ-TV]]/[[Youngstown, Ohio]] (21) – instead of by order of over-the-air channel number for all stations. If a certain edition featured more than one station that transmitted on the same channel but served different markets, the primary station in the edition was designated by a black bullet with a white number, while the other was indicated by a white bullet with a black number; some editions have also used a split (half for stations broadcasting on frequencies from channel 10 and up; three split with the channel number in the middle) or vertical channel bullet if it covered a large area. At times, several editions with out-of-market channels would have the bullets changed, like the Memphis Edition, where stations outside the primary area (especially the original channels in [[WBBJ|Jackson, Tennessee]], [[KAIT-TV|Jonesboro, Arkansas]], and [[WTVA|Tupelo, Mississippi]] that became part of the lineup since the 1960 inception) that was listed in black bullet/white numbers was reconfigured to white bullet/black numbers after more stations were added in 1980.

Upon the incorporation of those channels into the listings section in 1979–80, out-of-market superstations were first identified [[alphanumeric]]ally, indicating them by a combination of their over-the-air channel number and a letter representing their originating market city ([[WKBD-TV]] in [[Detroit]], which effectively served as the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate for most of [[Michigan]] until December 1994 via cable, was listed as "50D", for instance). By 1984, the three major national superstations at the time, [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]], [[WGN America|WGN]] and [[WWOR EMI Service|WOR]] (which were respectively identified as "17A", "9C" and "9N"), were given conventional abbreviated letter designations used by other cable channels. Alphanumeric identifiers were also used in some regional editions to disambiguate broadcast stations with identical channel numbers – usually for an out-of-market station, with the numeric identifier used for either a local or out-of-market station – in genre-based listings pages (such as the sports guide), crossreferences in the pages preceding the local listings and within the listings section for stations serving as default network affiliates (via cable) in markets without a local major network outlets. (One notable exception was the [[New Mexico]] edition, which from 1984 until 2005, listed [[Los Angeles]] stations [[KTLA]], [[KTTV]] and [[KCOP-TV]], which were available via cable in some parts of the state at certain points during that period, under the codes "TLA," "COP" and "TTV" rather than "5L," "11L" and "13L".)

The outlined bullets that were originally used only for out-of-market television stations were also assigned to cable-originated channels when those began to be incorporated into the listings section in 1981, indicating those services by a three-letter abbreviation in a condensed typeface: for example, "ESN" represented ESPN, "DSC" represented [[Discovery Channel|The Discovery Channel]] and "NIK" represented Nickelodeon/[[Nick at Nite]]. ([[E!]] and [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] later became exceptions, as those channels were identified by two-character abbreviations.) In certain cases, the abbreviation used (such as "AMC" for [[AMC (TV channel)|American Movie Classics]], "TNT" for "[[TNT (U.S. TV network)|Turner Network Television]]" and "[[MTV]]" for "Music Television") was that which the channel had already branded by ([[The Nashville Network]] [now the [[Paramount Network]]] is a noted exception, as it was originally assigned the abbreviation "NSH," rather than its network-assigned initialism "TNN"). Following that group's launch in September 1998, in editions in which one or more smaller markets served by said edition had local affiliates of the primarily cable-only service, affiliates of [[The WB 100+ Station Group]] were also identified in the same manner as conventional cable channels (under the abbreviation "WB") for brevity. Some [[PBS]] state or regional member networks were listed similarly in certain editions (such as Mississippi ETV [now [[Mississippi Public Broadcasting]]], which was listed in the Memphis edition under the code "E"). Two [[pay television|pay cable]] networks, [[Cinemax]] and [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] eventually [[rebrand]]ed in 1997 so that their respective ''TV Guide'' abbreviations – "MAX" and "SHO" – became the focal point of their logos. Some of the channels that were added to the prime time grids beginning with the September 12–18, 1998, issue were identified by four character abbreviations (such as "BBCA" for [[BBC America]] and "HBOS" for HBO Signature). In cable-specific editions, a bullet indicating a broadcast or cable channel's local cable assignment (except where a broadcast station's cable channel assignment is the same as its over-the-air channel or where smaller cable systems are listed) appeared alongside the specific station or network indicator.

Some cable channels – mainly premium channels – had an [[asterisk]] displayed by them in that edition's channel directory, which meant that it was only listed in the evening grid (and later the "Pay-TV Movie Guide"). Cable channels like Cinemax and [[Disney Channel|The Disney Channel]] initially had their programming listed exclusively within the prime time program grids in some editions of the magazine, but were later expanded to have their full daily schedules included in the log listings as well. In some larger markets where the local ''TV Guide'' edition maintained a regionalized format, [[pay-per-view]] services (such as [[Request TV]] and [[In Demand|Viewer's Choice]]) were also included in the prime time grids. By the mid-1990s, most editions of ''TV Guide'' provided program listings for nearly all cable channels featured in each issue within both the grids and the log listings, although some editions continued to list at least one channel, such as [[The Movie Channel]] (the only premium service that was excluded from the log listings in many editions by that point – though its inclusion in the log, as with select other cable channels, varied by market – until the September 1998 additions of [[Starz]], [[Starz Encore|Encore]], and HBO [[HBO#Channels|multiplex channels]] HBO Plus (now HBO2) and HBO3 (now HBO Signature) to the listings), exclusively in the grids. (Starz and Encore were listed in select markets where either network was available prior to being expanded to all local and regional editions with the 1998 "Fall Preview" issue.)

If the same program or episode was scheduled to air in the same timeslot on more than one channel, two or more bullets identifying each channel would precede the program title listed in a particular time entry. The usage of multiple bullets to denote stations airing the same program was a more common occurrence in instances where multiple broadcast stations aired the same [[television network|network]] program or their respective local news programs at the same time, although this also applied to broadcast and/or cable channels carrying the same episode of a syndicated program; separate time entries would only be used in this situation if the program had differing running times between channels (the grouping of bullets based on a station's affiliated network was later applied to the prime time grids beginning in September 2003). Another example would involve the synopsis or topic of the program listed; if the same description from the program aired on different channels later on in the day or during that week when it had aired first on another station listed in the edition, readers will notice “See ch.(xx) at (day/time) for details” below the program.

===Channel directory===
For much of the log listings era, the listings section was preceded by a channel directory, which listed the broadcast stations – and later, cable channels – whose program information was provided in each edition. The listed channels were organized numerically for broadcast stations and alphabetically (by abbreviation) for cable channels. Until cable-originated channels were added to the magazine, the directory exclusively listed broadcast television stations serving the individual markets serviced by the corresponding edition. Each station was listed in a separate entry corresponding to their [[city of license]], and in some cases, one or more stations serving a particular media market were broken out from competing stations serving the same market based on their primary city of service (for example, in the Oklahoma City/Oklahoma State and North Texas editions, ABC affiliate [[KSWO-TV]] in [[Lawton, Oklahoma]] – which was designated under a black bullet until the Oklahoma City and Tulsa editions were consolidated into a singular Oklahoma State edition in November 2003, when it began being identified by the outlined bullets assigned to its same-market competitors – was listed as serving "Lawton/Wichita Falls," appearing in a separate entry from the three stations serving the primary city of that station's home market, [[Wichita Falls, Texas]], NBC affiliate [[KFDX-TV]], CBS affiliate [[KAUZ-TV]] and independent station-turned-Fox affiliate [[KJTL]]).

The directory originally appeared in the lower one-quarter of the listings section's first page; from the May 11–17, 1985, issue onward, it became a full-page insert that directly preceded the listings. Until the May 31–June 6, 1969, issue, the directory also included studio addresses for each of the listed stations. Beginning with the June 7–13, 1969, issue, a foreword was included in the directory to denote that all [[public broadcasting|public television stations]] listed in the corresponding edition broadcast [[distance education|instructional programs]] for classroom use during the academic year.

Additional forewording was added below the listed channels in the lineup page beginning with the September 10–16, 1983, "Fall Preview" issue (in select markets; expanded nationwide with the May 11–17, 1985, issue) that provided descriptions of channels that were not included in each issue; this foreword was removed beginning with the September 12, 1998, issue, as the magazine began adding many of the channels mentioned in that paragraph. If any broadcast television stations listed in a particular edition operated [[Broadcast relay station#Satellite stations|satellite stations]] to cover adjacent areas not adequately covered by the main signal, a notation listing each repeater – identified only by channel number – was included directing readers living in those areas to view programs on those station in correspondence to their originating station (for example, readers of the Northern Wisconsin edition would be guided to the following, "for programs on [[WJMN-TV|3]] [[Escanaba, Michigan|Escanaba, Mich.]], see [[WFRV-TV|5]]; on 28 [[Eau Claire, Wisconsin|Eau Claire]], 31 [[La Crosse, Wisconsin|La Crosse]] and 55 [[Ellison Bay, Wisconsin|Ellison Bay, Wis.]], see [[Wisconsin Public Television|38]]; on [[WLWK-CD|22]] [[Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin|Sturgeon Bay]], see [[WGBA-TV|26]].")

From the magazine's incorporation of cable-originated channels in its local editions in 1982 until 1984/85, nationally distributed basic cable channels (such as ESPN, Nickelodeon, [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]] and CNN) were typically separated from out-of-market stations distributed to area cable providers in the channel lineup page, under the heading "Satellite Program Services," while premium channels (like HBO and Showtime) were categorized as "Pay-TV Services"; all cable channels listed in each edition were listed in alphabetical order thereafter, with premium services only being categorized separately from other cable channels in the prime time grids. Notations were also included in some editions, starting with the September 14–20, 1985 "Fall Preview" issue, to outline programming offered on certain local stations not listed in that edition. In some editions, particularly the "Ultimate Cable" and satellite editions, the channel lineup was diagrammed in the form of a conversion chart that listed each channel's assigned placement on cable and satellite providers as well as their VCR Plus+ code number; the lineup pages in some of the local editions switched to these charts beginning in 2003, listing channel slots for major cable providers within the local edition's home market (or in more regionalized editions, the largest markets served by that edition). The channel lineup page was dropped in June 2004 in most local editions.

====TV Guide Channel/Network====
{{main|Pop (U.S. TV channel)}}
In June 1998, the ''TV Guide'' brand and magazine were acquired by [[Gemstar-TV Guide International|United Video Satellite Group]],&lt;ref name="Gemstar"/&gt; the parent company of the Prevue Channel – a channel first launched in 1981 as the Electronic Program Guide network, that was carried by cable and some satellite television providers and was originally formatted to feature a [[electronic program guide|scrolling program guide]], short segments featuring previews of upcoming programs, and [[Promo (media)|promos]] and short-form [[Trailer (promotion)|film trailers]] for programs airing on various channels. Its new owners promptly rebranded Prevue as the '''TV Guide Channel''' on February 1, 1999. With the rebranding, some of the hourly segments featured on the channel at that point were renamed after features in the magazine, including ''TV Guide Close-Up'', ''TV Guide Sportsview'' (which was formatted more similarly to the listings section's sports guide than the color column of that name) and ''TV Guide Insider''. After Gemstar's acquisition of ''TV Guide'', the channel began to shift towards airing full-length programs featuring celebrity gossip and movie-focused talk shows alongside the program listings; the channel was rebranded as the '''TV Guide Network''' in 2007.

Following the respective sales of TV Guide's magazine and cable channel by Macrovision to OpenGate Capital and Lionsgate,&lt;ref name="OpenGate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LionsgateTVGuide"/&gt; the magazine and TV Guide Network became operationally separate, although the two properties still collaborated on content for TVGuide.com. After CBS Corporation bought stakes in TV Guide's properties in March 2013,&lt;ref name="deadline-cbstvguide"/&gt; TV Guide Network was rebranded under the abbreviated name TVGN that April to de-emphasize its ties to ''TV Guide'' magazine, as part of a transition into a general entertainment format while the channel gradually decommissioned its scrolling listings grid. The network was relaunched as Pop on January 14, 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Pop Network to Debut on Wednesday January 14, 2015|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/11/17/pop-network-to-debut-on-wednesday-january-14-2015/328642/|website=[[TV by the Numbers]]|publisher=[[Tribune Media|Tribune Digital Ventures]]|date=November 17, 2014|accessdate=January 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with its programming focus shifting towards shows about [[popular culture|pop culture]] and its [[fandom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=TVGN Rebrands as Pop, Shifts Focus on Fans|url=http://deadline.com/2014/09/tvgn-rebrand-pop-focus-on-fans-836044/|author=Nellie Andreeva|website=Deadline Hollywood|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|date=September 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=TV Guide Network to Relaunch In Early 2015 As POP|url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/news/cables-tvgn-to-relaunch-in-early-2015-as-pop-1201308419/|author=Brian Steinberg|periodical=Variety|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|date=September 18, 2014|accessdate=November 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Parents' Guide to Children's Entertainment''====
'''''TV Guide's Parents' Guide to Children's Entertainment''''' was a quarterly spin-off publication, which was first released on newsstands on May 27, 1993. The magazine featured reviews on television shows, home videos, music, books and toys marketed to children ages 2 to 12, as well as behind-the-scenes features centering on children's television shows and films. To limit confusion among readers, the ''Parents' Guide'' issues were printed as a standard-size magazine instead of the digest scale then applied by the parent ''TV Guide'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Best in Books, Videos and Computer Games for Kids|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-11-04/news/ls-58544_1_computer-games|author=Paul D.

==Other usage of the ''TV Guide'' name==
* A [[TV Guide (Canada)|Canadian edition]] of ''TV Guide'', which followed the same format as the U.S. magazine but published editorial content directed from Canada, was launched in 1977 (prior to this, beginning in 1953, the U.S. edition was published in Canada with appropriate localized television listings). It continued as a print publication until November 2006 (with only special editions being printed thereafter), after which it was replaced by the website tvguide.ca, which operated until December 2012, at which point it was incorporated into the entertainment and lifestyle website The Loop by Sympatico. The Canadian publication's owner [[Transcontinental Media]] discontinued ''TV Guide''{{'}}s online editorial content on July 2, 2014, ceasing the Canadian edition's existence after 61 years; its listings department, which distributes programming schedules to newspapers and The Loop owner [[Bell Canada]]'s pay television services ([[Bell TV]], Bell Aliant TV and [[Bell Fibe TV]]) remains operational.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=After 6 decades, TV Guide Canada ends editorial content|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/1428703/after-6-decades-tv-guide-canada-fades-to-black/|author=Jamie Sturgeon|website=[[Global News]]|publisher=[[Shaw Media]]|date=July 2, 2014|accessdate=July 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Transcontinental ends 61-year-run for TV Guide Canada, digital listings to continue|url=http://business.financialpost.com/2014/07/03/transcontinental-ends-61-year-run-for-tv-guide-canada-digital-listings-to-continue/|agency=[[Canadian Press]]|newspaper=[[Financial Post]]|publisher=[[Postmedia Network]]|date=July 3, 2014|accessdate=July 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

National television listings magazines using the ''TV Guide'' name (verbatim or translated into the magazine's language of origin) are also published in other countries, but none of these are believed to be affiliated with the [[North America]]n publication:

Television in Hong Kong is primarily in Cantonese and English.  It is delivered through analogue and digital [[Terrestrial_television|terrestrial]], [[Cable_television|cable]], [[IPTV]], and the Internet. [[Satellite_television|Satellite TV]] is not common, although many housing estates have dishes and re-distribute a limited number of free channels through coaxial cables.  The dominant broadcaster is [[TVB]].

==History==
Hong Kong's television history began with the launch of [[Rediffusion Television|Rediffusion Television (RTV)]] on 29 May 1957 (later renamed as [[Asia Television|Asia Television (ATV)]]). RTV started off as a cable subscription service but became a free-to-air broadcaster in 1973, with Cantonese and English channels. In April 2016 the [[Executive Council of Hong Kong|Executive Council]] decided not to renew ATV's broadcast licence and its channels closed. 

[[Television Broadcasts Limited|Television Broadcasts Limited (TVB)]] was the territory's first [[free-to-air]] commercial station (launching in 1967) and remains the predominant TV broadcaster today with multiple Cantonese channels and one English channel, on analogue and digital. 

A short-lived network, known as [[Commercial Television (Hong Kong TV station)|Commercial Television]], opened in 1975 and operated for about three years until its bankruptcy (see [[1970s in Hong Kong#Domestic entertainment|1970s in Hong Kong]]). 

Government owned [[Radio Television Hong Kong|Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK)]] (a radio broadcaster from 1949) starting making TV programmes in 1976 - to be aired on TVB and ATV and later on [[Cable TV Hong Kong|Cable TV]] and [[Now TV (Hong Kong TV channel)|Now TV]]. In 2016, RTHK took over the analogue frequency of ATV and now also has its own digital channels

[[HK Television Entertainment|HKTVE]], commonly known as [[ViuTV]] started broadcasting in 2016, on digital only, with a Cantonese channel and an English channel.

In May 2017, Fantastic Television started free-to-air broadcasting, on digital only, initially with a Cantonese channel.

There is also an [[Internet television]] and [[Video on demand|VOD]] channel called [[Hong Kong Television Network]] (HKTV, owned by [[City Telecom (Hong Kong)|City Telecom]]) which was launched in 2014 and can be viewed on [[smart TV]]s, [[set-top box]]es, personal computers, smartphones and tablet computers.

==Subscription networks==
* ''[[Cable TV Hong Kong]] (Hong Kong Cable Television Ltd)'': controlled by [[Wharf Holdings]], operates over 100 channels with programmes broadcast in [[English language|English]], [[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]], [[Standard Mandarin|Putonghua]] and other languages.
* ''[[Now TV (Hong Kong TV channel)|Now TV]] (PCCW-HKT Interactive Multimedia Services Ltd)'': provides 25 free channels and over 200 pay channels with programmes broadcast in [[English language]] (Supreme Sports Pack, World Entertainment Pack 1 &amp; 2, Movies Pack 1 &amp; 2, International News Pack, Kids Pack, Knowledge Pack), [[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]], [[Standard Mandarin (linguistics)|Putonghua]], Japanese and Korean (These Channel Available On Chinese Movies Pack &amp; Asian Entertainment Pack), Pinoy (Filipino Pack), French (French Pack) and Indian (Indian Pack 1-3).
* ''[[TVB]]'s MyTV Super''

==Satellite TV==
* ''[[Phoenix Television]]'': also broadcast in [[Greater China]]

==Programming==
Hong Kong's soap drama, comedy series and [[variety show]] productions reach mass audiences throughout the Cantonese-speaking, and even Mandarin-speaking, world. 

==Regulatory control==
Television in Hong Kong is not subject to China's regulatory or 'content' control and is under the purview of the [[Communications Authority]] in Hong Kong.

== Digital terrestrial television ==
Hong Kong was not required to follow China's DTT standard,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cedb.gov.hk/ctb/eng/broad/pdf/DTT.pdf|title= The Statement of the Secretary for Commerce, Industry and Technology on The Implementation Framework for Digital Terrestrial Television Broadcasting|page=3|accessdate= 11 February 2008}}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(90.5&amp;nbsp;KB)}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the Hong Kong government nevertheless opted to use DMB-T/H (now known as [[Digital Terrestrial Multimedia Broadcast|DTMB]]) as the digital terrestrial television broadcast standard in 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | language =Chinese| publisher =[[香港特別行政區政府]]工商及科技局 | title =工商及科技局局長政策聲明：數碼地面電視推行框架 | url =http://www.digitaltv.gov.hk/chi/pdf/DTT.pdf | date =2004-07-09 | accessdate =2016-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (hence rejecting the [[DVB-T]] standard originally proposed in 1998 and trialled in 2000).&lt;ref name="con2000"&gt;{{cite web | language =Chinese| publisher =[[香港特別行政區政府]]資訊科技及廣播局 | title =香港的數碼地面廣播諮詢文件（第一次） | url =http://www.digitaltv.gov.hk/chi/general/pdf/DTT-c-paper-1Dec00_C.pdf | date =2000-12-01 | accessdate =2016-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The official start of DTT broadcasting was at 7pm on 31 December 2007 as the first digital TV signal transmitter in [[Tsz Wan Shan]] went online.

In October 2007, both broadcasting companies agreed to use the [[MPEG2]] video standard for broadcasting free-to-air channels (TVB Jade, ATV Home, TVB Pearl and ATV World); the [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC|H.264]] video codec was implemented for all DTT-only channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr07-08/english/panels/itb/papers/itb1112cb1-203-3-e.pdf |title=Paper: "Legislative Council Panel on Information Technology and Broadcasting on Progress in the Implementation of Digital Terrestrial Television Broadcasting" }}, retrieved 28 November 2007&amp;nbsp;{{small|(41.9&amp;nbsp;KB)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the audio codec, usual DTMB [[set-top box]]es would support [[MPEG-1 Audio Layer II]] (MP2) for [[stereo]] audio tracks, and [[Dolby Digital#Dolby Digital|Dolby AC-3]] for 5.1 [[surround sound]] audio tracks. The official specification defines standard-definition broadcasting as [[576i]] at 50 fields per second and high-definition broadcasting in [[720p]] at 50[[Hertz|Hz]] or [[1080i]] at 50Hz.

All major transmitters were completed by 2008, covering at least 75 percent of the Hong Kong population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.digitaltv.gov.hk/general/pdf/coverage.pdf |title=Estimated Coverage of Digital Terrestrial Television (7 transmitting stations) }}, retrieved 30 May 2008&amp;nbsp;{{small|(2.08&amp;nbsp;MB)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current coverage reaches 99% of the population&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.digitaltv.gov.hk/general/index.htm |title=Digital Terrestrial TV}}. Retrieved 6 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Digital switchover]] is expected to take place in 2020, postponed from the originally planned date in 2015.

'''''The Beautiful Country''''' is a 2004 Norwegian-American [[Vietnam]]-related drama film set in 1990. It is directed by [[Hans Petter Moland]] and starring [[Damien Nguyen]], [[Nick Nolte]], [[Bai Ling]], [[Chau Thi Kim Xuan]], [[Tim Roth]], [[Anh Thu]], [[Temuera Morrison]] and [[John Hussey (actor)|John Hussey]].  The screenplay was written by [[Sabina Murray]], a writer who teaches at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]]'s [[MFA Program for Poets &amp; Writers]].

== Plot summary ==
The film tells the story of Binh, a Vietnamese boy who is often referred to as a "[[bui doi]]" (a derogatory term which has come to refer to a Vietnamese-born child fathered by an American soldier during the [[Vietnam War]]). After a life of prejudice and servitude, Binh decides to leave his tiny Vietnamese village and search for his mother in [[Saigon]]. Binh finds his mother, Mai, and discovers he has a younger brother, energetic and precocious Tam.  Mai is employed by Mrs. Hoa, the cruel mistress of a [[great house]]. After getting a job at the house with his mother, Binh discovers that she is sexually harassed constantly by Mrs. Hoa's son.

While dusting with his mother, Binh lifts a red glass statue of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], a precious family heirloom, to allow his mother to dust. As Binh lifts the statue to see it glow in the sun, the mistress walks in and charges Binh, calling him a thief. As Binh tries to keep the Buddha safe in his arms, the mistress slips on a wet patch of the floor, falling to her death. Binh and his mother quickly escape the house back to their apartment. They frantically pack the belongings of Binh and Tam. His mother gives them American money, the address of Binh's American father, and passage on a boat.

Binh and Tam both make it onto a boat bound for the United States, but a storm knocks them off course and instead takes them to [[Malaysia]]. Stuck in a [[refugee camp]], Binh and Tam adapt to their new circumstances and meet Ling, a [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] prostitute whose passage to America was also detoured to Malaysia. Binh and Ling seem to develop feelings for each other, kissing after Ling sings a ballad in [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] and dances for him.

Ling had been selling sexual favors for some time (though she dreams of a life as a singer) and had managed to buy herself, Binh, and Tam's way out of the refugee complex and onto a barge captained by the [[United Kingdom|British]] Captain Oh. During the voyage Binh, Ling, and Tam suffer shortages of food and fresh water. A gambling game (two contenders shout off American brand names in succession) threatens the other passengers by unfairly winning their food, water, and money. Several people succumb to the conditions, as does little Tam. A heartbroken Binh and Ling give him a funeral at sea.

The immigrants finally reach the United States, but are quickly rushed into transport trucks, bound for [[Chinatown]] in [[New York City]]. Binh works at a [[American Chinese cuisine|Chinese restaurant]] as a delivery boy and Ling works in a Chinatown [[cabaret]], though she still keeps prostitution as her main source of income. Ling eventually meets a wealthy businessman to support her. Binh's feelings for Ling go unanswered. Binh sends a letter explaining Tam's death to his mother, along with all the money he had saved thus far.

Binh finds out (over a poker game with his friends) that Vietnamese children born to American fathers are allowed free airplane passage to the United States and granted citizenship. Angry because he didn't have to lose his brother, he promptly leaves his job and hitch hikes toward [[Houston, Texas]], meeting amputee [[Vietnam War]] veterans and a Hispanic family along the way. Upon reaching the address Binh finds a woman, his father's ex-wife. His father had relocated after their divorce, working as a handyman at a ranch in [[Sweetwater, Texas]]. Binh is finally confronted with his father, blinded after opening a crate filled with explosives he thought was beer during the war. While Binh doesn't confess that he's his son, his father realizes it and the film ends with Binh and his father joking and laughing as he cuts his father's hair.

'''''The Hours''''' is a 2002 British-American [[drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Stephen Daldry]] and starring [[Meryl Streep]], [[Nicole Kidman]], and [[Julianne Moore]]. Supporting roles are played by [[Ed Harris]], [[John C. Reilly]], [[Stephen Dillane]], [[Jeff Daniels]], [[Miranda Richardson]], [[Allison Janney]], [[Toni Collette]], [[Claire Danes]], and [[Eileen Atkins]]. The screenplay by [[David Hare (playwright)|David Hare]] is based on [[Michael Cunningham]]'s 1998 [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning [[The Hours (novel)|novel of the same title]].

The plot focuses on three women of different generations whose lives are interconnected by the novel ''[[Mrs Dalloway]]'' by [[Virginia Woolf]]. These are Clarissa Vaughan (Streep), a New Yorker preparing an award party for her [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]]-stricken long-time friend and poet, Richard (Harris) in 2001; Laura Brown (Moore), a pregnant 1950s California housewife with a young boy and an unhappy marriage; and Virginia Woolf (Kidman) herself in 1920s England, who is struggling with depression and mental illness while trying to write her novel.

The film was released in Los Angeles and New York City on [[Christmas|Christmas Day]] 2002, and was given a [[limited release]] in the United States and Canada two days later on December 27, 2002. It did not receive a [[wide release]] in North America until January 2003, and was then released in British cinemas on [[Valentine's Day]] that year. Critical reaction to the film was largely positive, with nine [[Academy Award]] nominations for ''The Hours'' including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], and a win for [[Nicole Kidman]] for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]].

==Plot==
With the exception of the opening and final scenes, which depict the 1941 [[suicide]] by drowning of [[Virginia Woolf]] in the [[River Ouse, Sussex|River Ouse]], the action takes place within the span of a single day in three different decades and alternates between them throughout the film. In 1923, Virginia has begun writing the book ''[[Mrs Dalloway]]'' in her home in the town of [[Richmond, London|Richmond]] outside [[London]]. In 1951, troubled [[Los Angeles]] housewife Laura Brown escapes from her conventional life by reading ''Mrs Dalloway''. In 2001, [[New York City|New Yorker]] Clarissa Vaughan is the embodiment of the novel's title character, as she spends the day preparing for a party she is hosting in honor of her former lover and friend Richard, a poet and author living with [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] who is to receive a major literary award.  Richard tells Clarissa that he has stayed alive for her sake and that the award is meaningless because he didn't get it sooner, until he was on the brink of death.  She tells him that she believes that he would have won the award regardless of his illness.  Richard often refers to Clarissa as "Mrs. Dalloway" – her namesake – because she distracts herself from her own life the way that the Woolf character does.

Each story in chronological order, not the order as presented in the movie:

1923 -- Virginia, who has experienced several [[Mental breakdown|nervous breakdown]]s and suffers from [[bipolar disorder]], feels trapped in her home. She is intimidated by servants and constantly under the eye of her husband, [[Leonard Woolf|Leonard]], who has begun a publishing business, [[Hogarth Press]], at home to stay close to her. Virginia both welcomes and dreads an afternoon visit from her sister [[Vanessa Bell|Vanessa]] and her children. Virginia passionately kisses her sister on the lips. After their departure, Virginia flees to the railway station, where she is awaiting a train to central London, when Leonard arrives to bring her home. He tells her how he lives in constant fear that she will take her own life. She says she fears it also but argues that if she is to live, she has the right to decide how and where.

1951 -- Pregnant with her second child, Laura spends her days in her [[Tract housing|tract home]] with her young son, Richie. She married her husband, Dan, soon after [[World War II]]. On the surface they are living the [[American Dream]], but she is nonetheless deeply unhappy. She and Richie make a cake for Dan's birthday, but it is a disaster. Her neighbor Kitty drops in to ask her if she can feed her dog while she's in the hospital for a procedure. Kitty reveals that the procedure is related to the fact that she has been unable to conceive, and may portend permanent infertility, and that she really feels that a woman is not complete until she is a mother. Kitty pretends to be upbeat, but Laura senses her sadness and fear and boldly kisses her on the lips; Kitty laughs it off as if it didn't happen. Laura and Richie successfully make another cake and clean up, and then she takes Richie to stay with Mrs. Latch. Richie runs after his mother as she leaves, fearing that she will never come back. Laura checks into a hotel, where she intends to commit suicide. Laura removes several bottles of pills and ''Mrs. Dalloway'' from her purse and begins to read it. She drifts off to sleep and dreams the hotel room is flooded. She awakens with a change of heart and caresses her belly. She picks up Richie, and they return home to celebrate Dan's birthday.

2001 -- Clarissa appears equally worried about Richard's depression and the party she is planning for him. Clarissa, who is bisexual and has been living with Sally Lester for 10 years, had been in a relationship with Richard during their college days. She meets with Richard's ex-lover Louis Waters, who has returned for the festivities. Clarissa's daughter, Julia, comes home to help her prepare. Richard has taken a combination of [[Alprazolam|Xanax]] and [[Methylphenidate|Ritalin]] and tells Clarissa that she is the most beautiful thing that he ever had in life, before he commits suicide in front of her. Later that night, Richard's mother, Laura (the same character from the middle story), arrives at Clarissa's apartment. It is clear that Laura's abandonment of her family was deeply traumatic for Richard, but Laura reveals that it was a better decision for her to leave the family after the birth of her daughter than to commit suicide. She has led an independent, happier life as a librarian in Canada. She does not apologize for the hurt that she caused to her family (Dan and their daughter are also both dead) and suggests that it's not possible to feel regret for something over which she had no choice. She acknowledges that no one will forgive her, but she offers an explanation: "It [her life] was death. I chose life." When Julia visits Laura in her bedroom, she treats her with kindness and sensitivity that Laura does not expect to receive.

The film ends with a voice-over in which Virginia thanks Leonard for loving her: "Always the years between us. Always the years. Always the love. Always the hours."

==Critical reception==
''The Hours'' has an 80% "fresh" rating on the film review aggregator site [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 192 reviews and an average rating of 7.4/10. The consensus says that "the movie may be a downer, but it packs an emotional wallop. Some fine acting on display here."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hours/|title=''The Hours''|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=July 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film holds an average score of 80 out of 100, based on 40 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/video/titles/hours|title=''The Hours''|publisher=Metacritic|accessdate=July 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four main cast members were praised, especially Nicole Kidman who won numerous awards for her portrayal of Virginia Woolf including the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]].

[[Richard Schickel]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' criticized the film's simplistic characterization, saying, "Watching ''The Hours'', one finds oneself focusing excessively on the unfortunate prosthetic nose Kidman affects in order to look more like the novelist. And wondering why the screenwriter, David Hare, and the director, Stephen Daldry, turn Woolf, a woman of incisive mind, into a hapless ditherer." He also criticized its overt politicization: "But this movie is in love with female victimization. Moore's Laura is trapped in the suburban flatlands of the '50s, while Streep's Clarissa is moored in a hopeless love for Laura's homosexual son (Ed Harris, in a truly ugly performance), an AIDS sufferer whose relentless anger is directly traceable to Mom's long-ago desertion of him. Somehow, despite the complexity of the film's structure, this all seems too simple-minded. Or should we perhaps say agenda driven? This ultimately proves insufficient to lend meaning to their lives or profundity to a grim and uninvolving film, for which Philip Glass unwittingly provides the perfect score — tuneless, oppressive, droning, painfully self-important."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1003931,00.html|title='&amp;#39;Time'&amp;#39; review|author=RICHARD SCHICKEL Monday, December 23, 2002|date=December 23, 2002|accessdate=July 19, 2010|publisher=Time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephen Holden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film "deeply moving" and "an amazingly faithful screen adaptation" and added, "Although suicide eventually tempts three of the film's characters, ''The Hours'' is not an unduly morbid film. Clear eyed and austerely balanced would be a more accurate description, along with magnificently written and acted. Mr. Glass's surging minimalist score, with its air of cosmic abstraction, serves as ideal connective tissue for a film that breaks down temporal barriers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Holden |first=Stephen |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/27/movies/27HOUR.html |title='&amp;#39;New York Times'&amp;#39; review |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=December 27, 2002 |accessdate=July 19, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091204232423/http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/27/movies/27HOUR.html |archivedate=December 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mick LaSalle]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' observed, "Director Stephen Daldry employs the wonderful things cinema can do in order to realize aspects of ''The Hours'' that Cunningham could only hint at or approximate on the page. The result is something rare, especially considering how fine the novel is, a film that's fuller and deeper than the book ... It's marvelous to watch the ways in which [David Hare] consistently dramatizes the original material without compromising its integrity or distorting its intent ... Cunningham's [novel] touched on notes of longing, middle-aged angst and the sense of being a small consciousness in the midst of a grand mystery. But Daldry and Hare's [film] sounds those notes and sends audiences out reverberating with them, exalted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Mick LaSalle |author2=Chronicle Movie Critic |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2002/12/27/DD114138.DTL |title='&amp;#39;San Francisco Chronicle'&amp;#39; review |publisher=Sfgate.com |date=December 27, 2002 |accessdate=July 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' awarded the film, which he thought "sometimes stumbles on literary pretensions," three out of four stars. He praised the performances, commenting, "Kidman's acting is superlative, full of passion and feeling ... Moore is wrenching in her scenes with Laura's son (Jack Rovello, an exceptional child actor). And Streep is a miracle worker, building a character in the space between words and worlds. These three unimprovable actresses make ''The Hours'' a thing of beauty."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/the-hours-20030124 ''Rolling Stone'' review]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philip French]] of ''[[The Observer]]'' called it "a moving, somewhat depressing film that demands and rewards attention." He thought "the performances are remarkable" but found the Philip Glass score to be "relentless" and "over-amplified."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Phillip French |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2003/feb/16/7 |title='&amp;#39;The Observer'&amp;#39; review |publisher=Guardian |date= February 16, 2003|accessdate=July 19, 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steve Persall of the ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'' said it "is the most finely crafted film of the past year that I never want to sit through again. The performances are flawless, the screenplay is intelligently crafted, and the overall mood is relentlessly bleak. It is a film to be admired, not embraced, and certainly not to be enjoyed for any reason other than its expertise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/01/16/Weekend/_The_Hours__drags_on_.shtml |title='&amp;#39;St. Petersburg Times'&amp;#39; review |publisher=Sptimes.com |date= |accessdate=July 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Bradshaw]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' rated the film three out of five stars and commented, "It is a daring act of extrapolation, and a real departure from most movie-making, which can handle only one universe at a time . . . The performances that Daldry elicits . . . are all strong: tightly managed, smoothly and dashingly juxtaposed under a plangent score . . . Part of the bracing experimental impact of the film was the absence of narrative connection between the three women. Supplying one in the final reel undermines its formal daring, but certainly packs an emotional punch. It makes for an elegant and poignant chamber music of the soul."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Peter Bradshaw |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2003/feb/14/artsfeatures |title='&amp;#39;The Guardian'&amp;#39; review |publisher=Guardian |date=February 14, 2003 |accessdate=July 19, 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Queen of the Tambourine''''' is a 1991 [[epistolary novel]] by English author [[Jane Gardam]], it won the [[1991 Whitbread Awards|Whitbread Prize for Best Novel]] that year.&lt;ref name=whitb/&gt;

==Plot introduction==
Set in a wealthy Surrey suburb of South London, the novel takes the form of a series of increasingly bizarre letters written by Eliza Peabody, an interfering neighbour and hospice volunteer. The letters are written to Joan who has left her husband and fled the country, and tell of Emily's own marital and later mental breakdown, as the barriers between truth and fiction break down.

==Reception==
Reviews are positive :
*[[Kirkus Reviews]] explains that the novel "sardonically traces the steady fall (or is it rise?) into madness of a suburban wife with too little to do and too many horrors to shut out of her mind...her neighbors have begun to treat her with the wary kindness one reserves for the near- psychotic, but at least she's lost her self-righteous edge. As her letters move from stilted lectures to multiple-paged flights of glorious fancy, the roots of her misery begin to emerge, until all her inventions seem a perfectly rational response to the events that prefaced her destruction. A loony, funny tale and an author with a refreshing take on the familiar.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/jane-gardam/the-queen-of-the-tambourine/ THE QUEEN OF THE TAMBOURINE by Jane Gardam | Kirkus Reviews] Retrieved 27-03-2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' also praises the author: "Gardam knits together antic humor, a complex narrator and a sophisticated narrative form, all the while showing an admirable trust in the reader's ability to perceive the intricate pattern she has woven."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-312-13151-7 www.publishersweekly.com] Retrieved 2016-03-27.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Anita Brookner]] in ''[[Spectator Magazine|Spectator]]'' concludes that "The tone is unified throughout; manic delusions were never so persuasive. And it is very moving when it is not being exceedingly funny".&lt;ref&gt;''The Best Novels of the Nineties'' by Linda Parent Lesher, page 139, {{ISBN|0786407425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Search for Santa Paws''''' is an American-Canadian adventure-fantasy-film released on November 23, 2010 ([[direct to video]]). The movie is the tenth film in the ''[[Air Bud]]'' franchise and is also a [[prequel]] to ''[[Santa Buddies]]'', as well as a spin-off from the ''[[Air Buddies]]'' film franchise.

==Plot==
Santa Claus ([[Richard Riehle]]) receives a gift stuffed animal dog when his dear friend, Mr. Hucklebuckle who owned a toy store in New York City, passes away. To help cheer Santa up, they bring the stuffed dog to the magic icicle which turns it into a real puppy, whom Santa names Paws ([[Zachary Gordon]]) and tells him that they will be the best of friends for all eternity. Meanwhile, Mr. Hucklebuckle's grandson James and his wife Kate are gifted the toy store and are told by Mr. Stewart ([[Bill Cobbs]]) as long as they run it for a Christmas season with a profit. James is a CPA from [[Los Angeles]] and plans to sell the store once they have ownership. Kate and James are unable to have children and are sad to face another Christmas without children of their own.

Meanwhile, a young orphaned girl named Quinn ([[Kaitlyn Maher]]) arrives at an orphanage run by a evil and bad-tempered woman named Ms. Stout ([[Wendi McLendon-Covey]]) who does not approve of anything that children love: toys, Christmas decorations, singing, and even pets. She has a furnace which she uses to burn all the toys which she confiscates from the girls who rightfully own them. Despite the strict rules she has to respect while staying at the foster home, Quinn eventually befriends the girls, including Janie ([[G. Hannelius]]), Meg, Taylor, Mary and Willamina "Will" ([[Madison Pettis]]) who has lost her love of the holiday after the death of her parents years ago.

By the suggestion of Mrs. Claus, Eli ([[Danny Woodburn]]) and Eddy ([[Richard Kind]]) the elf dog, Santa travels to New York City with Paws to visit ambassadors for the Santa cause and after running into Ms. Stout he gets hit by a cab and loses his memory, Paws sees a small person he presumes is an elf and begs for help, only leading him and Santa to become separated. A homeless man named Gus takes his crystal that keeps him eternal and his bag. Paws also gets separated from Santa and can't find him. The following day he meets three stray dogs named Haggis, Rasta and T-Money who get caught by a dog catcher named Franklin. Using his crystal, he helps save them which makes them believe he is Santa's dog. They vow to help him so they can get off the naughty list. Santa comes across the Hucklebuckle Toy Store, where James and Kate are in search of a store Santa to help them turn a profit for the store. They hire Santa, who still has a memory loss and assumes his name is "Bud" likely due to Gus referring to him earlier. However, Santa is so popular with the children, word of the store spreads and Santa makes the store very popular. While Ms. Stout is gone, Will shows Quinn the store and the bike in the window she wishes she could have. Quinn goes into the store where Kate leads her to Santa, whom she asks for a puppy for the children of the orphanage to brighten their spirits and that Will could have the bike she wants. After returning to the foster home, they are caught by Ms. Stout, and Quinn inadvertently reveals an insult Will said earlier about Ms. Stout. Ms. Stout then punishes Will by leaving her to spend the night in the basement without dinner, an upset Will is disheartened that little kids always get her in trouble.

Meanwhile, the reindeer are still waiting in Central Park with the sled for Santa and Paws to return, since they are unable to fly without Santa's magic. A cub scout named Jimmy ([[Jonathan Morgan Heit]]), comes across them and vows to help find the real Santa Claus and give him the message that the reindeer are in Central Park waiting for him. He searches among all the store Santas in New York City trying to find the real Santa. He comes across Gus who is posing as a Santa with Santa's bag, ringing a bell to ask for money from passersby. He eventually finds the real Santa in Hucklebuckle Toy Store, who gives Jimmy his pin to thank him for his perseverance, even if Santa doesn't remember if he is the real Santa. In order to save Christmas, Eli and Eddy conclude they must go to New York City themselves in order to save Santa and Paws.

That evening, Paws wanders around the foster home desperately lost, calls for help. Quinn hears his distress and believes he was Santa's gift in response to her request. Paws explains his situation and Quinn agrees to hide him in the janitors closet for the night promising to take Paws to Hucklebuckles the next morning, believing that Santa is there. The next morning Will finds Quinn and Paws but cannot hear Paws speak since her Christmas spirit has subsided. Quinn then takes Paws to Hucklebuckles, unfortunately Paws wanders in at the one time Santa went for a break and James took over for him, they both head back with Quinn being hesistant to believe that Will was right. Janie discovers Quinn and Paws as they return to the orphanage and that night, Janie, Meg, Taylor and Mary discover that Paws can communicate with them too, but Will still cannot understand. Paws explains and the girls sing a musical number to make Will believe in Christmas again. 

Later, without his crystal, Santa becomes ill and passes out. Kate and James bring him to the hospital and are unable to find any of his family or anyone who knows him. Meanwhile, Eli and Eddy track down Santa's crystal and find Gus in the park, who admits to taking it and feels remorse. Eli then realizes the severity of the situation knowing without the magic crystal Santa could become mortal and eventually die. Gus vows to make things right and joins Eli and Eddy find Santa and save Christmas. The trio find the reindeer who are getting weak from lack of food, so Gus searches for Christmas food for their nourishment while Eli and Eddy track down Paws' crystal, who is now at the orphanage where Quinn found him.

When Ms. Stout finds Paws in the orphanage, she takes his crystal and puts him in the basement with Will for punishment, also seizing Quinn's mothers Christmas ornament from her. During the night Will finally regains her Christmas spirit and hears Paws' voice, however by dawn the next morning without the crystal, Paws turns back into a stuffed animal. When Ms. Stout finds him, she thinks he's a toy and throws him into the incinerator. After she leaves to go on a date with Franklin and leaves the children alone, Eli and Eddy arrive and help them search for Paws and the crystal. Quinn finds Paws and manages to save him before he can fall into the incinerator. After finding them and placing the crystal back on Paws, he turns back into a real puppy.

Jimmy runs to tell the reindeer he thinks he found the real Santa and gave him the message. Gus returns with Christmas food for the reindeer. Both find they are helping as Santa Ambassadors to help save Christmas. Gus takes Jimmy to the orphanage where Eli and Eddy went. Eddy recognizes the pin Jimmy is wearing, which Santa gave him, which proves he knows where he is. Jimmy tells them where to find the real Santa at the Hucklebuckle Toy Store. Will and Quinn know where that is and take them there. Eli tells Jimmy to keep the pin and dubs him an official Santa's helper for his perseverance, before Jimmy heads home. Haggis, Rasta and T-Money arrive and join in as well determined to keep their promise to Paws.

When Kate and James tell them he's in the hospital, they work together to rescue him and give him back the crystal. But the crystal is too weak to revive Santa. Paws tells Eli to put his crystal next to Santa to help, sacrificing himself as he'll turn back into a stuffed animal. Santa wakes up to find Paws as a stuffed animal. Gus drives the reindeer sled to the toy store, so that they could rush back to the North Pole to save him with the magic icicle. With Christmas around the corner, the icicle doesn't have enough power to spare. Santa sheds a tear over the loss of his best friend, which caused the magic to flow and turn Paws back into a full-grown dog named Santa Paws ([[Mitchel Musso]]) and Christmas is back on. Since Ms. Stout left the children alone and Will and Quinn are missing, Eli had informed Mrs. Gibson from Child Services, who then fires Ms. Stout for her cruelty towards the girls and takes over the orphanage.

Kate and James bring Will and Quinn back to the orphanage and decide to adopt them, with them all finally getting the family they always wanted. Later that night, Mrs. Gibson, Janie, and the other girls welcome Gus who brought them Santa's bag full of money he collected while posing as a store Santa. Back at the North Pole, everyone is helping to get ready for Christmas, including Haggis, Rasta and T-Money, who caught a ride with Eli and Eddy back to the North Pole and become official dog elves. 

On Christmas Eve, Santa and Santa Paws visit Quinn, Will, James and Kate and Santa Paws returns Quinn's ornament to her. Kate thanks Santa for bringing them all together before they depart. Mr. Stewart returns on Christmas day and sees that due to the toy store's success as well as donating toys to children in need as Santa had earlier suggested, James turned a profit of one cent, which his grandfather had done every previous year. This allows him and Kate to receive the deed to the store, which they decide to keep and continue the tradition through the Hucklebuckle legacy. As Mr. Stewart leaves the store he looks up and speaks to Mr. Hucklebuckle's spirit, bidding him a merry Christmas and that his wish has been fulfilled.
