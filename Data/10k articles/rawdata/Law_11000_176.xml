The '''1994 amendment to the Constitution of Argentina''' was approved on 22 August 1994 by a Constitutional Assembly that met in the twin cities of [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]] and [[Paraná, Argentina|Paraná]]. The calling for elections for the Constitutional Convention and the main issues to be decided were [[Pacto de Olivos|agreed in 1993]] between [[President of Argentina|President]] [[Carlos Menem]], and former president and leader of the opposition, [[Raúl Alfonsín]].

==Ratification==
On August 22, 1994, after three months of deliberations in the cities of [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]] (traditional seat of constitutional conventions) and [[Paraná, Argentina|Paraná]], the reform of 43 articles was finally approved in Santa Fe. The deliberations did not end without altercations; for instance, [[Monsignor]] [[Jaime de Nevares]] resigned his seat, claiming the convention to be "vitiated with absolute nullity".

==Main points==
Amongst the most important points of the reform are:
* Argentina ratifies its legitimate and non-prescribing sovereignty over the Islas Malvinas ([[Falkland Islands]]) under Temporary Provisions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitution|url=http://www.biblioteca.jus.gov.ar/Argentina-Constitution.pdf|publisher=Argentina Government}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The international legislation on [[human rights]], and every other [[Treaty|International Treaty]] ratified or to be ratified by Argentina, was deemed to hold an equal status to the Constitution as supreme law.
*The length of the [[President of Argentina|presidential]] term was shortened from six to four years. The reelection of the president and the vice-president was allowed once consecutively, and the requirement for the president to be a [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] was removed.
*The [[elections in Argentina|presidential elections]], formerly by the indirect vote of an [[electoral college]] became a direct election, with a modified [[Ballotage in Argentina|two-round ballotage]] system.
*The terms of [[Argentine Senate|senators]] were also shortened, from nine to six years. It was also established that every district was to elect three senators (up from the previous two) by direct elections (instead of being elected by provincial legislatures).
*The capital city, [[Buenos Aires]], was given the special status of [[Autonomous City]] (''Ciudad Autónoma''), and its population was given the right to elect a ''[[Chief of Government of Buenos Aires|Chief of Government]]'' (i.e. ''Mayor'').
*The [[De facto government doctrine|doctrine of ''de facto'' government]] was repealed, and it was established that any further attempt at breaking the constitutional order was to be deemed illegal, as severe penalties were to be established for the perpetrators and the right to resist a ''[[coup d'état]]'' was validated.
*The office of [[Chief of the Cabinet of Ministers]] was established, with the intention of attenuation the strong Presidentialist character of the Argentine government
*An independent institution, called the ''Judiciary Council'' ({{lang-es|Consejo de la Magistratura}}), was established with mandate to administer, regulate and control the functioning of the judiciary, to select the candidates for Federal Justicies, and to initiate [[impeachment]]s to depose them. It is composed of members from both houses of the National Congress, officials selected by the President, and representatives from the legal profession, judges and the academics.
*The issuing of [[Necessity and Urgency Decree]]s was regulated.
*An independent office, that of [[ombudsman]], was created.

==Other specific provisions==

In order to provide an effective protection to individual rights, the 1994 amendment has introduced actions called: "[[amparo (law)|amparo]]" (injunctions), "[[habeas corpus|hábeas corpus]]", and "[[habeas data|hábeas data]]". "Amparo" gives the possibility to any person to request that a judge declare the unconstitutionality of an act or ruling on which an action or omission of public authorities or private individuals is based that, in an actual or imminent manner, causes damage or restrains a right recognized by the Constitution, the law, or an international treaty. This action requires that no other effective judicial means be available. "Hábeas corpus" is an action that can be filled to protect the right of physical freedom when it is threatened, limited, modified, or injured, or in case of illegitimate aggravation of conditions of detention. "Hábeas data" is an action that can be filled by any individual to take notice of any information referred to him, registered in public or private registers, and to request its suppression, rectification, confidentiality, or updating.

Another innovation introduced by the 1994 amendment is the right of citizens to introduce bills before the House of Deputies that must be considered by Congress within the next twelve months. A further innovative provision is the recognition of the right of every inhabitant to a healthy environment in article 41 that establishes that

{{cquote|all inhabitants are entitled to the right to a healthy and balanced environment fit for human development in order that productive activities shall meet present needs without endangering those of future generations; and shall have the duty to preserve it. As a first priority, environmental damage shall bring about the obligation to repair it according to law. The authorities shall provide for the protection of this right, the rational use of natural resources, the preservation of the natural and cultural heritage and of the biological diversity, and shall also provide for environmental information and education. The Federal Government shall regulate the minimum protection standard, and the provinces those necessary to reinforce them, without altering their local jurisdictions. The entry into the national territory of present or potential dangerous wastes, and of radioactive ones, is forbidden.}}

Additionally, there are precise provisions referring to protection of consumers rights, defense of competition, control of natural or legal [[monopoly|monopolies]], and of public services' quality and efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;From the fuller article; see this article's talk page.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6245">{{nihongo|'''Administrative Scrivener'''|行政書士|Gyōsei shoshi}} is a legal profession in Japan which files government licenses and permits, drafts documents, and provides legal advice around such interactions. They are also known as '''Immigration Lawyers''', '''Gyosei-shoshi Lawyers''' or '''Certified Administrative Procedures Legal Specialists'''.

==Occupation==
Administrative Scriveners prepare legal documents such as filings with the national and local government. Administrative Scrivener are found in a variety of roles. Many specialize in [[immigration]] matters, [[Will (law)|wills]], [[inheritance]]s, motor vehicle registrations, Development approvals, articles of incorporation, company minutes, etc. Under the Administrative Scrivener Law, the types of documents that such professionals are authorised to prepare extends into the thousands, involving the aforementioned as well as attachments to administrative applications and contractual documents between corporate and private persons. The exception is when certain laws expressly designate a person in another capacity to prepare a legal document. 

Administrative Scriveners may also give advice on the preparation of such documents, one of the few exceptions to the [[attorney at law (Japan)|attorney at law]]'s monopoly on giving "legal advice" for compensation.

The work of an Administrative Scriveners bears certain overlaps with that of Attorney at Law or Scrivener in American or Common Law jurisdictions. Beside barristers, prosecutors, justices and judicial scriveners, they form an important part of the legal landscape in Japan.

South Korea has a similar occupation known as Haeng-jeong-sa (Hangul: 행정사, Hanja: 行政士).

==Purpose==
The 1997 amendment to the Administrative Scrivener Law has clarified the purpose of the qualification and monopoly.

1. This law determines the system of Administrative Scriveners. Such will allow greater precision in the work, (the scrivener) facilitates the smooth execution of administrative procedures. In all, the aim is to provide convenience to the citizenry.

==Qualification==

[[Attorney at law (Japan)|Attorneys at law]], [[certified public accountant]]s, [[patent attorney]]s and [[tax attorney]]s are automatically qualified to register as administrative scriveners. Any person who has worked in an "administrative position" at a government agency for 20 years is also entitled to the qualification. Otherwise, one must take the national examinations held every year as mentioned below.

==Reasons for Revocation of the Registration==
The registration of Administrative Scriveners can be revoked lawfully if the person belongs to the following.
#Underage persons,
#protected persons,
#undischarged bankrupts,
#convicted persons within three years of their conviction,
#dismissed civil servants within three years of dismissal,
#persons having received disciplinary removal under section 6 of the law within three years of such action,
#persons barred from work under section 14 within three years of such action,
#and persons having their names removed from the Bar Association for disciplinary reasons within three years of their removal.

==Registration==

Administrative Scrivener must maintain a membership in the Administrative Scrivener Association ( 行政書士会, gyōsei shoshi kai ) for the prefecture in which they work. The membership will cost approximately 300,000 yen. Member are also expected thereafter to pay 60,000 yen annually. There exists slight differences in the various prefectures and administrative districts pertaining to the cost.

If it is not done, one will not be allowed to perform work naturally, besides not being allowed to present him or herself as an administrative Scrivener. Nonetheless, in actuality, there is an increasing trend of members not paying their dues. As disciplinary action, after a request from the prefectural leaders, names of scriveners who do not pay will be released on the website of the Japan Federation of Gyoseishoshi Lawyers, with effect from 20 April 2011. The problem has begun to surface as such. As of March 2009, there are 39,846 registrants with 156 corporate bodies.

==Duty to declare==

The administrative Scrivener must record his name and impress his professional seal on documents that he prepares (under Execution Procedures of the Administrative Scrivener Law, section 9, subsection 2).

==National Qualification Examinations for Administrative Scriveners==

All in general are qualified to take the exam. The exam is customarily held throughout the nation on the second Sunday of each November. The prefectural authority designates the civil body, The Corporate Person of the Administrative Scrivener Examinations and Research Centre as its sole executor.

Subjects tested include laws relating to the work of a scrivener such as Constitutional Law, Civil Law, Administrative Law, Companies Law and basic legal knowledge. The aptitude of a person to do such work, such as general knowledge in politics, economics and society, knowledge pertaining to the safe transmission of Information, protection of personal information and comprehension of written passages. The syllabi of each exam is based on the current law as of the first of April every year. To pass, one must gain more than 60% of the total score, 50% in legal subjects and 40% in general knowledge subjects. The passing mark may be adjusted depending on the difficulty of the questions.

An '''assassination market''' is a [[prediction market]] where any party can place a bet (using anonymous [[electronic money]] and [[pseudonymous remailer]]s) on the date of death of a given individual, and collect a payoff if they "guess" the date accurately. This would incentivise assassination of individuals because the assassin, knowing when the action would take place, could profit by making an accurate bet on the time of the subject's death. Because the payoff is for accurately picking the date rather than performing the action of the [[Assassination|assassin]], it is substantially more difficult to assign criminal liability for the assassination.&lt;ref name="Harkin 2009"&gt;{{cite book | title = Lost in Cyburbia: How Life on the Net Has Created a Life of Its Own | last = Harkin | first = James | year = 2009 | page = 239 | publisher = Knopf Canada | isbn = 978-0-307-37398-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Assassination market.jpg|thumbnail|right|A screenshot from the Tor Assassination Market of [[Ben Bernanke]], former chairman of the US [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]] and the price money of the equivalent of about 1.7 million US dollars (as of December 2017)]]
Early uses of the terms "assassination market" and "market for assassinations" can be found (in both positive and negative lights) in 1994's "The [[Cyphernomicon]]"&lt;ref name="Cyphernomicon"&gt;{{cite web | title = The Cyphernomicon: Cypherpunks FAQ and More, Version 0.666 | last = May | first = Timothy C. | date = 1994-09-10 | url = https://cypherpunks.to/faq/cyphernomicron/cyphernomicon.html | pages = Sections 4 &amp; 16 | work = Cypherpunks.to | accessdate = February 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Timothy C. May]], a [[cypherpunk]]. The concept and its potential effects are also referred to as '''assassination politics''', a term popularized by [[Jim Bell]] in his 1995-96 essay of the same name.&lt;ref name="Bell 1997"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://jrbooksonline.com/PDF_Books/AP.pdf | title = Assassination Politics | last = Bell | first = Jim | work = Infowar | date = 1997-04-03 | accessdate = February 28, 2011 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110127224301/https://jrbooksonline.com/PDF_Books/AP.pdf | archivedate = 27 January 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; | deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McCullagh 2000"&gt;{{cite news|first=Declan |last=McCullagh |title=Crypto-Convict Won't Recant |url=https://wired.com/politics/law/news/2000/04/35620 |work=[[Wired (website)|Wired News]] |date=2000-04-14 |accessdate=January 14, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024203641/https://wired.com/politics/law/news/2000/04/35620 |archivedate=October 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in part 1, Jim Bell describes the idea as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.outpost-of-freedom.com/jimbellap.htm | title=Assassination Politics | author=Jim Bell }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The organization set up to manage such a system could, presumably, make up a list of people who had seriously violated the NAP (Non-aggression Principle), but who would not see justice in our courts due to the fact that their actions were done at the behest of the government. Associated with each name would be a dollar figure, the total amount of money the organization has received as a contribution, which is the amount they would give for correctly "predicting" the person's death, presumably naming the exact date. "Guessers" would formulate their "guess" into a file, encrypt it with the organization's public key, then transmit it to the organization, possibly using methods as untraceable as putting a floppy disk in an envelope and tossing it into a mailbox, but more likely either a cascade of encrypted anonymous remailers, or possibly public-access Internet locations, such as terminals at a local library, etc.

In order to prevent such a system from becoming simply a random unpaid lottery, in which people can randomly guess a name and date (hoping that lightning would strike, as it occasionally does), it would be necessary to deter such random guessing by requiring the "guessers" to include with their "guess" encrypted and untraceable "digital cash," in an amount sufficiently high to make random guessing impractical.}}

Bell then goes on to further specify the protocol of the assassination market in more detail. In the final part of his essay, Bell posits a market that is largely non-anonymous. He contrasts this version with the one previously described. Carl Johnson's attempt to popularise the concept of assassination politics appeared to rely on the earlier version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://parrhesia.com/cj/ | title = CJ files | last1 = Broiles | first1 = Greg | date = 1999-08-27 | accessdate = August 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There followed an attempt to popularise the second in 2001 that is ongoing today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wired.com/politics/law/news/2001/05/43771 |title=Online Cincy Cop Threats Probed |last1=McCullagh |first1=Declan |publisher=''[[Wired (website)|Wired News]]'' |date=2001-05-15 |accessdate=August 22, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105040401/https://wired.com/politics/law/news/2001/05/43771 |archivedate=November 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lair.xent.com/pipermail/fork/2003-July/023219.html | title = Online threats target Denver investigators | last1 = Hettinga | first1 = R.

Technologies like [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] and [[Bitcoin]] have enabled online assassination markets as described in parts one to nine of ''Assassination Politics''.

'''Bootleggers and Baptists''' is a concept put forth by regulatory economist [[Bruce Yandle]],&lt;ref name=BB&gt;{{cite journal | last = Yandle | first = Bruce | author-link = Bruce Yandle | title = Bootleggers and Baptists: the education of a regulatory economist | journal = [[Regulation (magazine)|Regulation]] | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 12–16 | publisher = [[American Enterprise Institute]] | date = May–June 1983 | url = http://www.cato.org/regulation/archives | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://news.heartland.org/sites/default/files/v7n3-3.pdf Pdf.]

For much of the 20th century, [[Baptists in the United States|Baptists]] and other [[Evangelicalism in the United States|evangelical Christians]] were prominent in political activism for [[Blue laws in the United States|Sunday closing laws]] restricting the sale of alcohol. [[Rum-running|Bootleggers]] sold alcohol illegally, and got more business if legal sales were restricted.&lt;ref name=BB /&gt; "Such a coalition makes it easier for politicians to favor both groups. ... [T]he Baptists lower the costs of favor-seeking for the bootleggers, because politicians can pose as being motivated purely by the public interest even while they promote the interests of well-funded businesses. ... [Baptists] take the moral high ground, while the bootleggers persuade the politicians quietly, behind closed doors."&lt;ref name=GW&gt;{{cite journal | last = Yandle | first = Bruce | last2 = Buck | first2 = Stuart | author-link = Bruce Yandle | title = Bruce, bootleggers, Baptists, and the global warming battle | journal = [[Social Science Research Network|SSRN]] | publisher = [[Social Science Research Network]] | doi = 10.2139/ssrn.279914 | ssrn = 279914 | date = 14 August 2001 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.279914 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic theory==
The mainstream economic theory of regulation treats politicians and administrators as brokers among interest groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Baldwin | first1 = Robert | last2 = Cave | first2 = Martin | last3 = Lodge | first3 = Martin | title = The Oxford handbook of regulation | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 2010 | isbn = 9780199655885 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lasswell | first = Harold | title = Politics: who gets what, when, how? | publisher = McGraw-Hill | location = New York | year = 1950 | origyear = 1936 | oclc = 21939663 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bootleggers and Baptists is a specific idea in the subfield of regulatory economics that attempts to predict which interest groups will succeed in obtaining rules they favor. It holds that coalitions of opposing interests that can agree on a common rule will be more successful than one-sided groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kahn | first = Alfred E. | title = The economics of regulation : principles and institutions | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1988 | isbn = 9780262610520 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baptists do not merely agitate for legislation, they help monitor and enforce it (a law against Sunday alcohol sales without significant public support would likely be ignored, or be evaded through bribery of enforcement officers). Thus bootleggers and Baptists is not just an academic restatement of the common political accusation that shadowy for-profit interests are hiding behind public-interest groups to fund deceptive legislation. It is a [[Rational expectations|rational]] theory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bryner | first = Gary | title = Bureaucratic discretion: law and policy in federal regulatory agencies | publisher = Pergamon Press | location = New York | year = 1987 | isbn = 9780080344935 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to explain relative success among types of coalitions.&lt;ref name=BB /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Tullock | first = Gordon | contribution = Rent seeking as a negative sum game | editor-last1 = Buchanan | editor-first1 = James M. | editor-last2 = Tollison | editor-first2 = Robert D. | editor-last3 = Tullock | editor-first3 = Gordon | title = Toward a theory of the rent-seeking society | pages = 16–38 | publisher = Texas A &amp; M University | location = College Station | year = 1980 | isbn = 9780890960905 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Wagner | first = Richard E. | title = Reviewed work: ''The Logic of Collective Action'' by Mancur Olson, Jr. | journal = [[Public Choice (journal)|Papers on Non-Market Decision Making]] | volume = 1 | pages = 161–170 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | date = December 1966 | jstor = 25122288 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another part of the theory is that bootleggers and Baptists produce suboptimal legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Buchanan | first = James M. | contribution = Rent seeking and profit seeking | editor-last1 = Buchanan | editor-first1 = James M. | editor-last2 = Tollison | editor-first2 = Robert D. | editor-last3 = Tullock | editor-first3 = Gordon | title = Toward a theory of the rent-seeking society | pages = 3–15 | publisher = Texas A &amp; M University | location = College Station | year = 1980 | isbn = 9780890960905 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although both groups are satisfied with the outcome, broader society would be better off either with no legislation or different legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Sutter | first = Daniel | title = The democratic efficiency debate and definitions of political equilibrium | journal = [[The Review of Austrian Economics]], special issue: Austrian Economics and Public Choice | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 199–209 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | doi = 10.1023/A:1015766621802 | date = June 2002 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1015766621802 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a surtax on Sunday alcohol sales could reduce Sunday alcohol consumption as much as making it illegal. Instead of enriching bootleggers and imposing policing costs, the surtax could raise money to be spent on, say, property tax exemptions for churches and alcoholism treatment programs. Moreover, such a program could be balanced to reflect the religious beliefs and drinking habits of everyone, not just certain groups. From the religious point of the view, the bootleggers have not been cut out of the deal, the government has become the bootlegger.&lt;ref name=GW /&gt;

Although the bootleggers and Baptists story has become a standard idea in regulatory economics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schneider | first1 = Mark | last2 = Teske | first2 = Paul | title = Toward a theory of the political entrepreneur: evidence from local government | journal = [[American Political Science Review]] | volume = 86 | issue = 3 | pages = 737–747 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press|Cambridge Journals]] | doi = 10.2307/1964135 | jstor = 1964135 | date = September 1992 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1964135 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has not been systematically validated as an empirical proposition. It is a catch-phrase useful in analyzing regulatory coalitions rather than an accepted principle of economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Breyer | first = Stephen | title = Regulation and its reform | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1982 | isbn = 9780674753761 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global warming==
Legislation and treaties to reduce [[global warming]] often command support of both polluters and environmentalists. While there are several possible interpretations of that (for example, polluters could be trying to forestall stronger legislation, or to involve themselves in the process to insert specific protections; environmentalists could be unaware of industry support or fooled by it) it has been held up as an example of bootleggers and Baptists. In this version of the story, the polluters are looking for taxes and regulations to reduce competition, hoping to gain more from ability to charge higher prices than it costs them to pay taxes and comply with regulations. Environmentalists don’t care that some users of carbon are paying more money to some carbon emitters, as long as total carbon emissions go down and society takes a public stance in favor of the environment.&lt;ref name=GW /&gt;

==Literal example==
"Arkansas liquor stores have allied with religious leaders to fight statewide legalization of alcohol sales. The stores in wet counties don’t want to lose customers. The churches don’t want to lose souls. Larry Page, a Southern Baptist pastor and director of the Arkansas Faith and Ethics Council, which traces its roots to the Anti-Saloon League of Arkansas in 1899, [also recalled]...when his group joined with feminists to oppose pornography and cooperated with Mississippi casinos to fight gambling in Arkansas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Deprez | first1 = Esmé E. | last2 = Hogue | first2 = Millie | title = Arkansas liquor stores join churches to save dry counties | url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-10-27/arkansas-liquor-stores-join-churches-to-save-dry-counties.html | work = [[Bloomberg News#Bloomberg Politics|Bloomberg Politics]] | publisher = [[Bloomberg News]] | date = October 27, 2014 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150114075546/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-10-27/arkansas-liquor-stores-join-churches-to-save-dry-counties.html | archivedate = January 14, 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2007 [[Dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy|Congressional investigation of the dismissal of eight U.S. attorneys]], it was discovered that administration officials had been using a private Internet domain, called gwb43.com, owned by and hosted on an email server run by the [[Republican National Committee]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Guardian]]''. [https://www.theguardian.com/worldlatest/story/0,,-6506360,00.html White House Says It Still Backs Gonzales]. 25 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; for various official communications. The domain name is an abbreviation for "[[George W. Bush]], 43rd" [[President of the United States]]. The use of this email domain became public when it was discovered that [[J.

Congressional requests for administration documents while investigating the dismissals of the U.S. attorneys required the Bush administration to reveal that not all internal [[White House]] emails were available.

''[[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]] (CREW),'' 15 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Waxman sent a formal warning to the RNC, advising them to retain copies of all emails sent by White House employees.

On April 12, 2007, White House spokesman [[Scott Stanzel]] stated that White House staffers were told to use RNC accounts to "err on the side of avoiding violations of the [[Hatch Act of 1939|Hatch Act]], but they should also retain that information so it can be reviewed for the [[Presidential Records Act]]," and that "some employees ... have communicated about official business on those political email accounts."&lt;ref name="gaggle4-12"&gt;[http://www.tpmmuckraker.com/archives/002993.php White House - April 12, 2007 Press Gaggle by Scott Stanzel] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070415034406/http://www.tpmmuckraker.com/archives/002993.php |date=April 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stanzel also said that even though RNC policy since 2004 has been to retain all emails of White House staff with RNC accounts, the staffers had the ability to delete the email, themselves.

On December 14, 2009, CNN reported&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/12/14/white.house.emails/ CNN Politics]&lt;/ref&gt; that all 22 million missing emails had been found on backup tapes, and that the Obama Administration reached a settlement with two watchdog groups who had sued to obtain the emails.

White House deputy Jennifer Farley told [[Jack Abramoff]] not to use the official White House system "because it might actually limit what they can do to help us, especially since there could be lawsuits, etc."&lt;ref name="wp1"/&gt; Abramoff responded, "Dammit. It was sent to Susan on her RNC pager and was not supposed to go into the WH system."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Financial Times]]''.

* At least eighty-eight Republican National Committee email accounts were granted to senior Bush administration officials, not "just a handful" as previously reported by the White House spokesperson Dana Perino in March 2007. Her estimate was later revised to "about fifty." Officials with accounts included: [[Karl Rove]], the President’s senior advisor; [[Andrew Card]], the former White House Chief of Staff; [[Ken Mehlman]], the former White House Director of Political Affairs; and many other officials in the Office of Political Affairs, the Office of Communications, and the Office of the Vice President.
* The RNC has 140,216 emails sent or received by Karl Rove. Over half of these emails (75,374) were sent to or received from individuals using official ".gov" email accounts. Other users of RNC email accounts include former Director of Political Affairs [[Sara Taylor]] (66,018 emails) and Deputy Director of Political Affairs Scott Jennings (35,198 emails). These email accounts were used by White House officials for official purposes, such as communicating with federal agencies about federal appointments and policies.
* Of the 88 White House officials who received RNC email accounts, the RNC has preserved no emails for 51 officials.
* There is evidence that the Office of White House Counsel under [[Alberto Gonzales]] may have known that White House officials were using RNC email accounts for official business, but took no action to preserve these presidential records.
*The evidence obtained by the Committee indicates that White House officials used their RNC email accounts in a manner that circumvented these requirements. At this point in the investigation, it is not possible to determine precisely how many presidential records may have been destroyed by the RNC. Given the heavy reliance by White House officials on RNC email accounts, the high rank of the White House officials involved, and the large quantity of missing emails, the potential violation of the Presidential Records Act may be extensive.

The '''Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier''' (CSSF) is responsible for the [[financial regulation]] in [[Luxembourg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cssf.lu/|title=Home: Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF)|website=www.cssf.lu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CSSF is responsible for the supervision of credit institutions, experts in the financial sector, investment companies, pension funds, regulated securities markets and their operators, multilateral trading facilities and payment institutions. The CSSF is the competent authority for the public auditor oversight.

== History ==
The CSSF took over the duties of the former Commissariat aux Bourses and of the Institut Monétaire Luxembourgeois (IML), which on 1 June 1998, became the [[Central Bank of Luxembourg|Banque centrale du Luxembourg]] (BCL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cssf.lu/fileadmin/files/Lois_reglements/Legislation/Lois/L_231298_cssf_upd210712.pdf|title=404: Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF)|website=www.cssf.lu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
Beside the board the CSSF consists of:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cssf.lu/nc/fr/la-cssf/structure-et-organisation/|title=Organisation générale: Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF)|website=www.cssf.lu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Board Secretariat
* Secretariat
* Law Department
* Department of Human Resources, Administration and Finance
* Department of Information Systems
and 10 departments, including 8 are responsible for the supervision of the financial sector, a section for general supervision and control of the Department of the profession:
* General Supervision
* Supervision of UCI
* Supervision of Management Companies of UCI
* Supervision of banks
* Supervision of investment firms
* Specialised care of PFS
* Information Systems and Supervision of Support PFS
* Supervision of pension funds, and securitization SICAR organisms
* Monitoring of the securities markets
* Public Auditor Oversight
* Investor Protection

== Responsibilities ==

=== Supervision ===
The CSSF supervision of the financial sector aims at the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cssf.lu/fr/la-cssf/mission-et-competences/|title=Mission et compétences: Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF)|website=www.cssf.lu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Promotion of a considered and prudent business policy in accordance with regulatory requirements
* Protect the financial stability of the regulated entities and the financial sector as a whole
* Monitoring the quality of the organization and internal control systems
* Strengthening the quality of risk management
The CSSF monitors all financial activities in Luxembourg, which require the approval of the Minister responsible for the CSSF. It is only in the public interest, ensure that the laws and ordinances are enforced on the financial sector and respected and that international conventions and EU directives in the areas under their responsibility to be implemented. The CSSF is authorized to require all necessary information to perform their duties of companies under its supervision. The CSSFübernimmt at Community and international level negotiations on the financial sector and coordinate the implementation of government initiatives and measures about an orderly expansion of the activities of the financial sector.

=== Public auditor oversight ===
The CSSF is the public auditor oversight. In this regard, the CSSF is thus responsible for the granting of the professional qualifications of the "Independent Auditor" (auditors) and "cabinet de Revision" (audit) for the approval and registration of statutory auditors and audit firms. The CSSF is also responsible for the implementation of auditing standards and professional ethics standards and internal quality control of audit firms and approved for continuing education.

=== Investor protection ===
The CSSF is directly responsible for investor protection related queries.  As part of the FIN-NET programme, the CSSF is the sole recourse for investors who seek compensation or complaints handling.  Unlike some jurisdictions, there is no separate or independent ombudsman.  There have been a number of high-profile cases, including Madoff, where the CSSF's ability to enforce customer complaints has come into question.  To date, the general response has been unsatisfactory and there are increasing concerns over the capabilities of the CSSF to carry out their duties effectively.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2011/cr11148.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Financial risk types}}

'''Concentration risk''' is a [[bank]]ing term describing the level of risk in a bank's portfolio arising from concentration to a single counterparty, sector or country. 

The risk arises from the observation that more concentrated portfolios are less [[Diversification (finance)|diverse]] and therefore the returns on the underlying assets are more correlated.  

Concentration risk can be calculated for a single bank loan or whole portfolio using a "concentration ratio". For a single loan, the concentration ratio is simply the proportion of the portfolio the loan represents (e.g. a $100 loan in a $1000 portfolio would have a ratio of 0.1 or 10%) 

For a whole portfolio, a [[herfindahl index]] is used to calculate the degree of concentration to a single name, sector of the economy or country.  Separate concentratio ratios must be calculated for each type of concentration. 

To illustrate, a portfolio with 10 equally sized loans would have a concentration ratio of 0.1 or 10%, whereas a portfolio of 10 loans - 9 equally sized and 1 equal to half the value of the portfolio would have a concentration ratio of 0.27 or 27%.

The ratio is useful for bankers or investors at large to identify when a portfolio may be excessively exposed to the risk that a [[recession]] or downturn in one sector of the economy or another country may cause a high proportion of the bank's outstanding loans to [[Default (finance)|default]]. 

Concentration risk is usually monitored by risk functions, committees and boards within commercial banks and is normally only allowed to operate within proscribed limits.  It is also monitored by banking regulators and generally attracts a higher [[Risk-weighted asset|capital charge]] in banking regulation. 

==Types==
There are two types of concentration risk. These types are based on the sources of the risk. Concentration risk can arise from uneven distribution of exposures (or loan) to its borrowers. Such a risk is called ''name concentration risk''. Another type is ''sectoral concentration risk'', which can arise from uneven distribution of exposures to particular sectors, regions, industries or products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visibleequity.com/creditrisksoftware/Learn/concentration-risk-methodology.jsp|title=Concentration Risk|work=Visible Equity|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206112845/http://www.visibleequity.com/creditrisksoftware/Learn/concentration-risk-methodology.jsp|archivedate=December 6, 2013|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monitoring and management==
Most financial institutions have policies to identify and limit concentration risk. This typically involves setting certain thresholds for various types of risk. Once these thresholds are set, they are managed by frequent and diligent reporting to assess concentration areas and identify elevated thresholds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mfsa.com.mt%2Fpages%2Freadfile.aspx%3Ff%3D%2Ffiles%2FLegislationRegulation%2Fregulation%2Fbanking%2FcreditInstitutions%2Frules%2FBR_12_14%2FAnnex%25202G%2520-%2520Principles%2520for%2520the%2520Management%2520of%2520Concentration%2520Risk.pdf|title=Principles for the Management of Concentration Risk|publisher=Malta Financial Services Authority|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A key component to the management of concentration risk is accurately defining thresholds across various concentrations to minimize the combined risks across concentrations.

The '''Confederate States Constitution''', formally the '''Constitution of the Confederate States of America''', was the supreme [[law]] of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate States]], as adopted on March 11, 1861, and in effect from February 22, 1862, through the conclusion of the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref name="en.wikisource.org"&gt;&lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[[s:Constitution of the Confederate States of America|Constitution of the Confederate States of America – Wikisource, the free online library]]&lt;/span&gt;.

==Comparing constitutions==
*The Preambles of both the U.S. and Confederate Constitution do have some similarities, though it seems that the Confederate Constitution authors set out to give a different feel to the new preamble. Both preambles are provided here. The bold text shows the differences in the two. The Confederate constitution's preamble includes references to a religious deity, a perpetual government, and the sovereignty and independence of each state.
**The Preamble to the U.S. Constitution: "We the People of the '''United''' States, in Order to form a '''more perfect Union''', establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, '''provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare''', and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the '''United''' States of America."&lt;ref name="usconstitution.net"/&gt;
**The Preamble to the Confederate Constitution: "We, the people of the '''Confederate''' States, '''each state acting in its sovereign and independent character,''' in order to form a '''permanent federal government''', establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity — '''invoking the favor and guidance of Almighty God''' — do ordain and establish this Constitution for the '''Confederate''' States of America."&lt;ref name="en.wikisource.org"/&gt;

===Article summaries===
The Confederate Constitution followed the U.S. Constitution for the most part in the main body of the text with some changes.

'''Article I''' '''Differences''':
*Amended '''Article I Section 2(1)''' to prohibit persons "of foreign birth" who were "not a citizen of the Confederate States" from voting "for any officer, civil or political, State or Federal."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;&lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[[s:Constitution of the Confederate States of America#a2-s1|Constitution of the Confederate States of America – Wikisource, the free online library]]&lt;/span&gt;. Retrieved July 10, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Article I Section 2(3)''' is essentially the same. Although, the clause still only counts "three-fifths of all slaves"&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;&lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[[s:Constitution of the Confederate States of America#a1-s2|Constitution of the Confederate States of America – Wikisource, the free online library]]&lt;/span&gt;.

Retrieved July 10, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Amended '''Article I Section 2(5)''' to allow the state legislatures to impeach federal officials who live and work only within their state with 2/3 vote in both houses of the state legislature.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;
*Concerning the appointment of Senators '''Article I Section 3(1)''' adds "at the regular session next immediately preceding the commencement of the term of service."&lt;ref&gt;&lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[[s:Constitution of the Confederate States of America#a1-s3|Constitution of the Confederate States of America – Wikisource, the free online library]]&lt;/span&gt;. Retrieved July 10, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The State Legislature, who was responsible for the appointment of Senators at the time, must wait until the seat was vacant.
*'''Article I Section 4(1)''' deals with elections and adds "subject to the provisions of this Constitution"&lt;ref&gt;&lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[[s:Constitution of the Confederate States of America#a1-s4|Constitution of the Confederate States of America – Wikisource, the free online library]]&lt;/span&gt;. Retrieved July 10, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; to the U.S. Constitution Clause. This means that each State Legislature is free to make their own decisions except where the Constitution has laid out other rules. The fore mentioned '''Article I Section 2(1)''' and '''Article I Section 3(1)''' clauses would fall into that category.
*Amended '''Article I Section 6(2)''' to allow the House of Representatives and Senate the ability to grant seats to the heads of each Executive Department in order to discuss issues involving their departments with Congress. This Clause is the same as the one from the U.S Constitution and adds:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:''But Congress may, by law, grant to the principal officer in each of the Executive Departments a seat upon the floor of either House, with the privilege of discussing any measures appertaining to his department.''&lt;ref&gt;&lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[[s:Constitution of the Confederate States of America#a1-s6|Constitution of the Confederate States of America – Wikisource, the free online library]]&lt;/span&gt;. Retrieved July 10, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*Amended '''Article I Section 7(2)''' to provide the President of the Confederate States of America with a [[line item veto]] but also required any bill which the president used the veto in to be resubmitted to both houses for a possible override vote by 2/3 of both houses.
* In an attempt to prevent the Confederate Congress from protecting industry the framers add to '''Article I Section 8(1)'''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:''The Congress shall have power – To lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises for revenue, necessary to pay the debts, provide for the common defense, and carry on the Government of the Confederate States; but no bounties shall be granted from the Treasury; '''nor shall any duties or taxes on importations from foreign nations be laid to promote or foster any branch of industry; and all duties, imposts, and excises shall be uniform throughout the Confederate States'''.''&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;&lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[[s:Constitution of the Confederate States of America#a1-s8|Constitution of the Confederate States of America – Wikisource, the free online library]]&lt;/span&gt;.

Retrieved July 10, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
'''Article I Section 8(3)''' adds quite a bit to the U.S. Constitution in an attempt to block the Confederate Congress from passing law to "facilitate commerce"&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; with some exceptions allowing for safety and improvement to waterways.
::'''Article I Section 8''' of the U.S. Constitution

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*There are changes and additions to '''Article 1 Section 9 Clauses (1), (2),''' and '''(4)''' that are covered in the '''Slavery''' section below.
* The first twelve amendments to the U.S. Constitution, including the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], were directly incorporated into the Confederate Constitution. This was done primarily in '''Article I Section 9'''  of the Confederate Constitution with the first Eight Amendments to the U.S Constitution becoming clauses '''(12)''' to '''(19)'''.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;&lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[[s:Constitution of the Confederate States of America#a1-s9|Constitution of the Confederate States of America – Wikisource, the free online library]]&lt;/span&gt;.

*In addition to these there are three altogether new clauses in the Confederate Constitution for Article I Section 9.
*'''Article I, Section 9(9)'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:''Congress shall appropriate no money from the treasury except by a vote of two-thirds of both Houses, taken by yeas and nays, unless it be asked and estimated for by some one of the heads of Department, and submitted to Congress by the President; or for the purpose of paying its own expenses and contingencies; or for the payment of claims against the Confederate States, the justice of which shall have been judicially declared by a tribunal for the investigation of claims against the government, which it is hereby made the duty of Congress to establish.''

*'''Article I, Section 9(20)''' was added to limit new bills to contain only one subject when presented.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:''Every law or resolution having the force of law, shall relate to but one subject, and that shall be expressed in the title.''&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Then in Section 10:
* '''Article I Section 10(3)''' Confederate States do not have the ability to tax ships and negotiate treaties concerning water ways with other States without the consent of Congress. This Clause limits the Confederate States in their ability to keep troops or engage in war as well, though they would have the ability to enter compacts for the improvement of shared rivers.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:''No State shall, without the consent of Congress, lay any duty on tonnage, except on sea-going vessels, for the improvement of its rivers and harbors navigated by the said vessels; but such duties shall not conflict with any treaties of the Confederate States with foreign nations; and any surplus revenue, thus derived, shall, after making such improvement, be paid into the common treasury. Nor shall any state keep troops or ships of war in time of peace, enter into any agreement or compact with another state, or with a foreign power, or engage in war, unless actually invaded, or in such imminent danger as will not admit of delay.

*Though Article I Section 9(1) of both constitutions are quite similar in banning the importation of slaves from foreign nations the Confederate Constitution permits the C.S. to import slaves from the United States and specifies the "African race" as the subject. The importation of slaves into the United States, including the South, had already been illegal since 1808.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[[African slave trade#Abolition|Slavery in Africa – Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia]]&lt;/span&gt;.

:While the U.S. Constitution has a clause that states "No bill of attainder or ex post facto law shall be passed"&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; the Confederate Constitution adds a phrase to explicitly protect slavery.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
:'''Article I Section 9(4)'''
:''No [[bill of attainder]], ex post facto law, or law denying or impairing the right of property in negro slaves shall be passed.''&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

*The U.S. Constitution states in Article IV Section 2 that "The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States." The Confederate Constitution adds that a state government cannot prohibit the rights of a slave owner traveling or visiting from a different state with his or her slaves.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
:'''Article IV Section 2(1)'''
:''The citizens of each State shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States; and shall have the right of transit and sojourn in any State of this Confederacy, with their slaves and other property; and the right of property in said slaves shall not be thereby impaired.''&lt;ref&gt;&lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[[s:Constitution of the Confederate States of America#a4-s2|Constitution of the Confederate States of America – Wikisource, the free online library]]&lt;/span&gt;.

*The Confederate Constitution added a clause about the question of slavery in the territories (the key Constitutional debate of the 1860 election) by explicitly stating that slavery is legally protected in the territories.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
:'''Article IV Section 3(3)'''
:''The Confederate States may acquire new territory; and Congress shall have power to legislate and provide governments for the inhabitants of all territory belonging to the Confederate States, lying without the limits of the several states; and may permit them, at such times, and in such manner as it may by law provide, to form states to be admitted into the Confederacy. In all such territory, the institution of negro slavery as it now exists in the Confederate States, shall be recognized and protected by Congress, and by the territorial government: and the inhabitants of the several Confederate States and Territories, shall have the right to take to such territory any slaves lawfully held by them in any of the states or territories of the Confederate states.''&lt;ref&gt;&lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[[s:Constitution of the Confederate States of America#a4-s3|Constitution of the Confederate States of America – Wikisource, the free online library]]&lt;/span&gt;.

Retrieved July 10, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; feel that the Confederate Constitution's Preamble including the phrase "each State acting in its sovereign and independent character" focuses the new Constitution on the rights of the individual States.
*The Preamble to the Confederate Constitution begins : "We, the people of the Confederate States, each State acting in its sovereign and independent character..."&lt;ref name="en.wikisource.org"/&gt;

The Confederate States gain several rights that the U.S. states did not have. For example, they gained the right to impeach federal judges and other federal officers if they worked or lived solely in their state.&lt;blockquote&gt;
:'''Article I Section 2(5)'''
:''The House of Representatives shall choose their speaker and other officers; and shall have the sole power of impeachment; except that any judicial or other federal officer, resident and acting solely within the limits of any state, may be impeached by a vote of two-thirds of both branches of the Legislature thereof. ''&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*The Confederate Constitution omits the phrase “emit [[Bill of credit|Bills of Credit]]” from Article 1 Section 10 of the U.S. Constitution, granting the Confederate States the right to issue such bills of credit.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:'''Article I Section 10(1)'''
:''No State shall enter into any treaty, alliance, or confederation; [[Letter of marque|grant letters of marque and reprisal]]; coin money; make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts; pass any bill of [[attainder]], or [[ex post facto law]], or law impairing the obligation of contracts; or grant any title of nobility.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
:''No State shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation; grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal; coin Money; '''emit Bills of Credit'''; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts; pass any Bill of Attainder, ex post facto Law, or Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts, or grant any Title of [[Nobility]].''&lt;ref&gt;&lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[http://www.usconstitution.net/const.html#A1Sec10 The United States Constitution – The U.S. Constitution Online – USConstitution.net]&lt;/span&gt;.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*The Confederate States gain the ability to tax ships by omitting the phrase from the U.S. Constitution that prohibits it.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:'''Article I Section 9(7)'''
:''No preference shall be given by any regulation of commerce or revenue to the ports of one State over those of another. ''&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
:While the U.S. Constitution reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:''No Preference shall be given by any Regulation of Commerce or Revenue to the Ports of one State over those of another: '''nor shall Vessels bound to, or from, one State, be obliged to enter, clear, or pay Duties in another.''' ''&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
:The ability to tax ships to raise revenue for the Confederate States is reinforced in '''Article 1 Section 10(3)'''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:'''Article I Section 10(3)'''
:''No State shall, without the consent of Congress, lay any duty on tonnage, except on seagoing vessels, for the improvement of its rivers and harbors navigated by the said vessels; but such duties shall not conflict with any treaties of the Confederate States with foreign nations; and any surplus revenue thus derived shall, after making such improvement, be paid into the common treasury.''&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*Also in '''Article I Section 10(3)''' the Confederate States would have the power to make treaties between each other concerning waterways.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:''Nor shall any State keep troops or ships of war in time of peace, enter into any agreement or compact with another State, or with a foreign power, or engage in war, unless actually invaded, or in such imminent danger as will not admit of delay. But when any river divides or flows through two or more States they may enter into compacts with each other to improve the navigation thereof.''&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Confederate States '''lose''' a few rights that the U.S. states retained.

*States lose the right to determine if foreigners can vote in their States: '''Article I Section 2(1)''' as mentioned above.
*Confederate States also lose the ability to restrict the rights of traveling and sojourning slave owners. : '''Article IV Section 2(1)''' as mentioned above (Note:  Many Southerners were already of the opinion that the U.S. Constitution already protected the rights of sojourning and traveling slave owners, thus the Confederate Constitution merely made this explicit).
*The ability for Confederate Congress to determine taxes between States.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:'''Article I Section 9(6)'''
:''No tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported from any State, except by a vote of two-thirds of both Houses.''&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*The U.S. Constitution contained many of the phrases and clauses which had led to disagreement among the states in the original Union, including a [[Supremacy Clause]], a [[Commerce Clause]], and a [[Necessary and Proper Clause]]. The Supremacy Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause are nearly identical in both Constitutions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[http://www.usconstitution.net/const.html#Article6 The United States Constitution – The U.S. Constitution Online – USConstitution.net]&lt;/span&gt;.

==Judicial review==
Although the Confederate States Supreme Court was never constituted, the supreme courts of the various Confederate states issued numerous decisions interpreting the Confederate Constitution.  Unsurprisingly, given that the Confederate Constitution was based on the United States Constitution, the Confederate State Supreme Courts often used United States Supreme Court precedents.  The jurisprudence of the Marshall Court, thus, influenced the interpretation of the Confederate Constitution.  The state courts repeatedly upheld robust powers of the Confederate Congress, especially on matters of military necessity.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred L. Brophy, [http://blurblawg.typepad.com/files/necessity-knows-no-law.pdf "Necessity Knows No Law:" Vested Rights and the Styles of Reasoning in the Confederate Conscription Cases, Mississippi Law Journal] (2000) 69: 1123–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
According to an 1861 speech delivered by Alabamian politician [[Robert Hardy Smith]], the [[Alabama in the American Civil War|State of Alabama]] declared its secession from the U.S. in order to preserve and perpetuate the practice of slavery, the debate over which he referred to as the "Negro quarrel". In the speech, Smith praised the Confederate constitution for its un-euphemistic and succinct protections of the right to own "Negro" slaves:

{{quotation|We have dissolved the late Union chiefly because of the negro quarrel. Now, is there any man who wished to reproduce that strife among ourselves? And yet does not he, who wished the slave trade left for the action of Congress, see that he proposed to open a Pandora's box among us and to cause our political arena again to resound with this discussion. Had we left the question unsettled, we should, in my opinion, have sown broadcast the seeds of discord and death in our Constitution. I congratulate the country that the strife has been put to rest forever, and that American slavery is to stand before the world as it is, and on its own merits. We have now placed our domestic institution, and secured its rights unmistakably, in the Constitution. We have sought by no euphony to hide its name. We have called our negroes 'slaves', and we have recognized and protected them as persons and our rights to them as property.|[[Robert Hardy Smith]]|''An Address to the Citizens of Alabama on the Constitution and Laws of the Confederate States of America''|1861.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.openthought.org/summa/confederate.html |title=An Address to the Citizens of Alabama on the Constitution and Laws of the Confederate States of America |date=1861 |last=Smith |first=Robert Hardy |location=Mobile |page=19 |quote=We have dissolved the late Union chiefly because of the negro quarrel.

Georgia Democrat [[Alexander H. Stephens]], who would become the Confederacy's vice president, also stated that the Confederate constitution was "decidedly better than" the American one, as it "put at rest, forever, all the agitating questions relating to our peculiar institution. African slavery as it exists amongst us; the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization. This was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution. Jefferson in his forecast, had anticipated this, as the 'rock upon which the old Union would split.' He was right."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/document/cornerstone-speech/ |authorlink=Alexander H.

A '''construction contract''' is a mutual or legally binding [[Contract|agreement]] between two parties based on policies and conditions recorded in document form. The two parties involved are one or more [[owner]]s, and one or more [[General contractor|contractor]]s. The owner has full authority to decide what type of contract should be used for a specific development to be constructed and to set forth the legally-binding terms and conditions in a [[contractual agreement]].&lt;ref name="Contracts"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://civilengineerlink.com/common-types-construction-contracts/ | title=Main types of contracts | accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
`
==Types==
The six types of contracts are:
*Lump sum contract
*Percentage Rate Contract
*Item rate contract/unit price contract 
*Lump sum and scheduled contract&lt;ref name="Common types of construction contracts"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://construction.about.com/od/Construction-Management/a/Types-Of-Construction-Contracts.htm | title=Common types of construction contracts | accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
PERCENTAGE RATE CONTRACT:
when the lowest rate and comparative position among the contractors are already specified prior to the opening of the tender, then the percentage rate contract is used. In this type of contract there is no possibility of unbalanced tender. 
*Cost plus fixed fee contract
*Cost plus percentage of cost contract
*Special contracts&lt;ref name="A text book of Production Planning and Management"&gt;{{cite book | title=A text book of Production Planning and Management | author=Dr. B.C Punmia | year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lump sum contract===

In a lump sum contract an owner agrees to pay a contractor a specified lump sum after the completion of work without a cost breakdown.&lt;ref name="Business dictionary1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://m.businessdictionary.com/definition/lump-sum-contract.html | title=Business dictionary | accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="Lump sum contract"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://construction.about.com/od/Procurement-Process/a/Lump-Sum-What-Is-A-Lump-Sum.htm | title=Lump sum contract | accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After work no detailed measurements is required.

===Lump sum and scheduled contract===
In lump sum contract the complete work as per plan and specifications is carried out by contractor for certain fixed amount as per agreement. The owner provides required information and contractor charges certain amount. This contract is suitable when the number of items are limited or when it is possible to work out exact quantities of work to be executed. The detailed specifications of all items of work, plans and detail drawings, security deposit, penalty, progress and other condition of contract are included in agreement.Though it is lump sum and scheduled contract, contractor will be paid at regular interval of 2-3 months as per progress of work on the basis of certificate issued by engineer in charge. A scheduled of rate is included in agreement for making payment of extra items.

===Cost plus fixed fee contract===

In cost plus fixed fee, the owner pays the contractor an agreed amount over and above the documented cost of work.&lt;ref name="India study"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.indiastudychannel.com/projects/2054-Various-types-of-Civil-Engineering-Contracts.aspx | title=India study channel | work=by Owais Khursheed | accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cost plus percentage of cost contract===
In cost plus percentage, the owner pays greater than 100 percent of the documented cost, usually requiring detailed expense accounting.&lt;ref name="Business dictionary2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://m.businessdictionary.com/definition/cost-plus-percentage-contract.html. | title=Cost plus percentage of cost contract | work=by Owais Khursheed | accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In this type of contract, contractor is paid the actual cost of work plus certain percentage as profit. Various contract documents, drawing, specifications are not necessary at the time of signing the agreement.Contractor has to keep all records for cost of material and labour and contractor will be paid accordingly to engineer incharge.This type of contract is suitable for emergency work like difficulties in foundation conditions, construction of expensive structure etc.

===Special contracts===
{{expand section|date=August 2016}}
Special contracts are further classified into five types:
*Turn key contract

*Negotiated  contract
*Package contract
*Continuing contract
*Running contract&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Production Planning and Management | author=Dr. B.C. Punmia | date=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''death of Alberto Nisman''', an [[Argentina|Argentine]] lawyer who specialized in international [[terrorism]], became known in the early hours of Monday, January 19, 2015. He was found shot in the head in his apartment in the Torre del Parque building in the upscale Le Parc Puerto Madero development in the neighborhood of [[Puerto Madero]] in [[Buenos Aires]].

In September 2017, the [[Argentine National Gendarmerie|National Gendarmerie]] issued a report concluding that Nisman had been murdered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Argentinian lawyer Alberto Nisman was murdered, police report finds |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/06/argentinian-lawyer-alberto-nisman-was-murdered-police-report-finds|website=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eldia.com/nota/2017-9-20-19-44-0-para-gendarmeria-el-fiscal-alberto-nisman-fue-asesinado--el-pais «Para Gendarmería, el fiscal Alberto Nisman fue "asesinado"»], published 20 September 2017 ''El&amp;nbsp;Día'' (Buenos Aires).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.clarin.com/politica/justicia-rechazo-anular-pericia-gendarmeria-sostiene-nisman-asesinado_0_Hk0Co1Np-.html|title=La Justicia avaló la pericia de Gendarmería que sostiene que Nisman fue asesinado|work=Clarín}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.infobae.com/sociedad/policiales/2017/09/20/las-pericias-de-gendarmeria-confirmaron-que-el-fiscal-alberto-nisman-fue-asesinado-los-detalles-del-informe/|title=Las pericias de Gendarmería confirmaron que el fiscal Alberto Nisman fue asesinado: los detalles del informe|work=Infobae}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==
[[Alberto Nisman|Natalio Alberto Nisman]] had been the Special Prosecutor in charge of the 1994 [[AMIA bombing]] investigation since 13 September 2004. The case had been marked by [[judicial misconduct]], and had reached an impasse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mundo/noticias/2014/07/140716_argentina_amia_cronologia_nc|title=Cronología del caso AMIA a 20 años del atentado|work=BBC News|date=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013 signing of a [[Memorandum of understanding between Argentina and Iran|Memorandum of Understanding]] with Iran to facilitate the investigation led to a breach between Nisman and President [[Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner]]. Nisman alleged that the signing of the memorandum with Iran was part of an effort to cover-up alleged Iranian complicity in the AMIA bombing in exchange for improved trade relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2015/02/05/argentina-to-question-ex-spy-in-probe-nisman-death/|title=Argentina to question ex-spy in probe of Nisman's death|work=Fox News Latino|date=5 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The accusation was based on Nisman's belief that the administration had petitioned [[Interpol]] to lift [[Interpol notice|Red Notices]] against numerous Iranian officials during the negotiations. The Secretary General of Interpol at the time, [[Ronald Noble]], said on 15 January 2015 that no such requests had been made, and that Foreign Minister [[Héctor Timerman]] had stated on each occasion the case was discussed that Interpol should keep the red notices effective,&lt;ref name=5key&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buenosairesherald.com/article/179953/five-key-days-from-accusations-to-tragedy|title=Five key days: from accusations to tragedy|work=Buenos Aires Herald|date=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that "Prosecutor Nisman's assertion is false."&lt;ref name=noble&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/subnotas/264222-71187-2015-01-18.html|title=Former Secretary General of Interpol Ronald Noble talks about the complaint: "What Nisman says is false"|work=Página/12|date=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nisman's body was found 19 January. The discovery of the body came hours before the prosecutor was to present his complaint to the Criminal Law Committee of the Chamber of Deputies;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1760054-el-fiscal-alberto-nisman-ira-al-congreso-para-informar-sobre-la-imputacion-a-cristina-kirchner-y-timerman «El fiscal Alberto Nisman irá al Congreso para informar sobre la imputación a Cristina Kirchner y Timerman»], 20.1.2015 [[La Nación (Buenos Aires)|''La Nación'']] (Buenos Aires).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lanacion&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1761272-quien-era-el-fiscal-natalio-alberto-nisman «Quién era el fiscal Nisman»], 19.1.2015 ''La Nación'' (Buenos Aires)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Le_Parc&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1761336-como-son-las-torres-le-parc-y-el-departamento-donde-murio-nisman «Cómo son las torres Le Parc y el departamento donde murió Nisman»], 19.1.2015 ''La Nación'' (Buenos Aires).&lt;/ref&gt; Nisman had already submitted his complaint and wiretap transcripts to Judge Ariel Lijo on 14 January.&lt;ref name=5key/&gt; The Nisman death is under investigation by Federal Judge Emma Palmaghini and Special Prosecutor Viviana Fein. It is unknown if the death was a suicide, a forced suicide, or a murder.&lt;ref name="cert"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1763001-certezas-vs-incognitas |title=Certezas vs. Incógnitas |trans-title=Certainties vs. unknown things |language=Spanish |date=January 25, 2015 |work=La Nación |accessdate=January 27, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6WTKgf8VK?url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1763001-certezas-vs-incognitas |archivedate=2015-02-20 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Federal Judge Daniel Rafecas dismissed the Nisman complaint, which had been resubmitted to the courts by Federal Prosecutor Gerardo Pollicita, on 26 February. Judge Rafecas held in his ruling that "none of the two hypotheses of a crime put forward by prosecutor Pollicita in his writ stand up to the minimum level of scrutiny".&lt;ref name=judge&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buenosairesherald.com/article/182999/judge-rafecas-dismisses-amia-coverup-charge-against-president-cristina-fern%C3%A1ndez-de-kirchner|title=Judge Rafecas dismisses AMIA cover-up charge against President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner|work=Buenos Aires Herald|date=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pollicita did not succeed Nisman as chief AMIA prosecutor; this office was headed as of 13 February by a prosecution task force led by coordinator Juan Murray.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buenosairesherald.com/article/181980/four-prosecutors-to-probe-%E2%80%9994-bombing|title=Four prosecutors to probe ’94 bombing|work=Buenos Aires Herald|date=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Complaint ==
In a complaint issued on Tuesday January 13, 2015, Nisman accused President [[Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner]], Minister of Foreign Relations [[Héctor Timerman]], deputy Andrés Larroque and the ''[[piquetero]]s'' [[Luis D'Elia]] and Fernando Esteche of [[obstruction of justice|concealment]]. According to Nisman, they had guaranteed impunity of Iran with the memorandum to unblock relations with this country and impute some called "local fascists".&lt;ref name=Wikileaks&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telam.com.ar/notas/201501/91973-wikileaks-estados-unidos-nisman-amia.html|title=Según cables de Wikileaks, EEUU orientaba a Nisman en la investigación del atentado|work=Télam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The complaint was based on eavesdropping on an alleged Iranian spy who spoke on different occasions to D'Elia, Esteche, and Larroque, and on Nisman's stated belief that the administration had petitioned [[Interpol]] to lift [[Interpol notice|Red Notices]] against numerous Iranian officials during said negotiations.&lt;ref name=5key/&gt; The Secretary General of Interpol at the time, [[Ronald Noble]], noted on 15 January 2015 however that no such requests had been made, and that “on each occasion that [Foreign Minister [[Héctor Timerman]]] and I spoke about the Interpol red notices issued in connection to the AMIA case, [Timerman] stated that Interpol should keep the red notices effective.” &lt;ref name=5key/&gt; Noble added on 18 January that "Prosecutor Nisman's assertion is false."&lt;ref name=noble/&gt;

Nisman claimed that Cristina Fernandez had ordered an agent of the "[[SIDE]]" (Secretariat of Intelligence) she trusts or Andrés Larroque, and both delivered that to Esteche or to  D'Elia.  D'Elia communicated to the alleged Iranian agent Alejandro Yussuf Khalil, who telephoned [[Mohsen Rabbani]] (one of the parties accused of the 1994 bombing). According to Nisman, the reasons for the orders were intended to overcome "the Argentina energy crisis through an exchange of [Iranian] oil with [Argentine] grains" and "even sell arms [to Iran]". Nisman claimed that to finalize the memorandum, the condition that [[Interpol]] red notices against several officials of Iran be rescinded was included,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com.uy/mundo/cfk-acusada-encubrir-iran-amia.html|title=CFK acusada de encubrir a Irán en el caso AMIA|work=El País|date=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; an assertion discredited by Interpol director Ronald Noble.&lt;ref name=noble/&gt; [[United States diplomatic cables leak|Wikileaks]] cables also revealed that the [[United States Ambassador to Argentina|U.S. Embassy in Argentina]] had given Nisman direct orders not to investigate any local connections to the AMIA bombing as well as any [[Syrian]] links to same. He was instead to assume guilt on the part of the Iranian suspects in the case regardless of evidence.&lt;ref name=Wikileaks/&gt;

Nisman was found next to a [[Bersa]] gun, .22 caliber, in his 13th-floor apartment in the Torre del Parque building within the upscale Le Parc Puerto Madero development located in [[Puerto Madero]], Buenos Aires.&lt;ref name=cert/&gt; At 3 a.m. on Monday, 19 January 2015, after Nisman's mother tried, with no success, to open the door, a locksmith could open the service door of his house, which was locked from inside. When they managed to get inside, Nisman's body was found lifeless in the bathroom, along with a pistol and a cap bullet.&lt;ref name=berni&gt;[http://www.minseg.gob.ar/deceso-del-fiscal-nisman «Deceso del Dr. Nisman»], artículo en el sitio web del Ministerio de Seguridad (Buenos Aires).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the autopsy, Nisman died the previous afternoon and had an entry bullet wound on the right parietal (temple) of his head, two inches above the ear; the bullet remained inside the head with no exit wound. His body was found inside the bathroom and blocking the door, and there were no signs of forced entry or robbery in the apartment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/officials-argentine-prosecutor-died-in-locked-apartment/|title=Officials: Argentine prosecutor died in locked apartment|work=Times of Israel|date=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paraffin test did not reveal any [[gunshot residue]] on Nisman's hands, suggesting that he may not have fired the gun himself.&lt;ref name="cert"/&gt; The results of such a test, however, may not be conclusive, as the gun involved is of small caliber and may leave no trace.&lt;ref name=dna&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/181660/judge-confirms-dna-profile-different-to-nismans-found|title=Judge confirms DNA profile different to Nisman's found|work=Buenos Aires Herald|date=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His body did not have signs of physical attack, and Prosecutor Fein commented that there were no items suggesting the presence of other people at the crime scene.&lt;ref name="cert"/&gt; Fein announced on 9 February, however, that DNA from a second person was found on a coffee cup in the kitchen sink.&lt;ref name=dna/&gt; Nisman had made numerous cryptic comments shortly before his death, including a [[WhatsApp]] message that said "I'm better than ever and sooner than later the truth will prevail".&lt;ref name="cert" /&gt;

The gun found did not belong to Nisman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1761395-el-arma-no-era-propiedad-de-alberto-nisman-dijo-la-fiscal-del-caso|title=El arma no era propiedad de Alberto Nisman|work=La Nación}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was registered in the name of an employee of the prosecutor, computer repair technician Diego Lagomarsino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ellitoral.com/index.php/id_um/108984-solicitaron-nuevo-peritaje-del-arma|title=Solicitaron nuevo peritaje del arma|work=El Litoral}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lagomarsino was a frequent guest at the Nisman residence, and is the last person known to have seen him alive. He last visited Nisman at around 8 p.m. on the day of Nisman's death, and according to Le Parc security records, stayed there as late as 12:54&amp;nbsp;a.m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/1-265071-2015-01-30.html|title=Cámaras vs. registros|work=Página/12|date=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the .22 caliber weapon that fired the fatal shot belonged to Lagomarsino, he could not explain how no fingerprints of his were present on the weapon, as would be expected.&lt;ref name=nego&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ellitoral.com/index.php/id_um/110232-lagomarsino-nego-una-relacion-homosexual-con-nisman|title=Lagomarsino negó una relación homosexual con Nisman|work=El Litoral|date=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed to have brought it to the apartment upon request, because Nisman distrusted his own custody.&lt;ref name=nego/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perfil.com/politica/El-asesor-de-Nisman-entre-la-decepcion-y-la-custodia-de-Gendarmeria-20150123-0933.html|title=El asesor de Nisman entre la decepción y la custodia policial|work=Perfil}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, Nisman's 10-man security detail were not at home watching when Nisman died.&lt;ref name=reuters&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/02/06/us-argentina-prosecutor-idUSKBN0LA1S620150206?rpc=401|title=Dead prosecutor was a 'soldier' of ex-Argentine spy boss|work=Reuters|date=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lagomarsino earned an unusually large salary as Nisman's personal computer technician (40,000 pesos a month during 2014; US$5,000 at the time).&lt;ref name=nego/&gt; He was asked in a 5 February press conference if he had a [[homosexual]] relationship with Nisman as well as a professional one, which he denied.&lt;ref name=nego/&gt; Senator Salvador Cabral stated on 25 February that he had proof to that effect, and was subpoenaed by prosecutor Fein to provide an affidavit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urgente24.com/237019-crimen-pasional-fein-cito-al-senador-k-que-dice-que-tiene-mas-pruebas |title="Crimen pasional": Fein citó al senador K que dice que tiene más pruebas |date=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Senior [[Secretariat of Intelligence]] officer Antonio "Jaime" Stiusso, who conducted many of the wiretaps ordered by Nisman, had been dismissed in a December 2014 agency shakeup and had persuaded Nisman to dismiss his 10-man security detail days before his death.&lt;ref name=reuters/&gt; Stiusso presented himself on 18 February for questioning by Special Prosecutor Fein after initially evading the subpoenas. Facing unrelated charges of [[smuggling]], he reportedly fled the country for neighboring [[Uruguay]] a week later in a black pickup registered to one of the companies allegedly involved in the smuggling operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/24/argentina-spy-tax-fraud-kirchner|title=Argentinian ex-spy accused of tax fraud as allegations swirl in Fernández scandal|work=The Guardian|date=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nisman's death caused an international stir and appeared in many news media worldwide.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/20/world/americas/alberto-nisman-found-dead-argentina-amia.html|title=Puzzling Death of a Prosecutor Grips Argentina|work=New York Times|date=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The death generated more than a million [[Twitter|tweets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com.uy/mundo/caso-nisman-genero-millon-tweets.html|title=Caso Nisman generó 1 millón de tweets|work=El País}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prosecutor in the case said: "There are no witnesses, and no neighbors who could provide data on what happened".&lt;ref name=Le_Parc/&gt; It remains unknown if the death was a suicide, a forced suicide, or a murder.&lt;ref name="cert"/&gt; Following his death there were [[18F (demonstration)|massive protests]] across the country demanding justice and uncovering the cause of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/18/buenos-aires-march-alberto-nisman-president-kirchner|title=Buenos Aires marches to honour deceased prosecutor Alberto Nisman|work=The Guardian|date=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official report released in 2017, concluded that Nisman was murdered which contradicts previous government claims that he committed suicide. It states he was assaulted by two people, beaten and shot.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.algemeiner.com/2017/10/02/official-report-death-of-argentine-prosecutor-in-1994-buenos-aires-jewish-center-bombing-case-was-result-of-murder-not-suicide/&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 18 February 2015, there was a silent demonstration, convened by the Attorney congregation and federal attorney, in various cities in Argentina and abroad, in order to commemorate the death of Nisman a month earlier.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15106">'''Devocalization''' (also known as '''ventriculocordectomy''' or '''vocal cordectomy''' and when performed on [[dog]]s is commonly known as '''debarking''' or '''bark softening''') is a [[surgery|surgical]] procedure performed on [[dog]]s and [[cat]]s,&lt;ref name="Humane Society"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsvma.org/assets/pdfs/devocalization-facts.pdf|title=Devocalization fact sheet|publisher=Humane Society Veterinary Medical Association|accessdate=2 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; where tissue is removed from the animal's [[vocal cords]] to permanently reduce the volume of its vocalizations.

==Indications and contraindications==
Devocalization is usually performed at the request of an animal owner (where the procedure is legally permitted). The procedure may be forcefully requested as a result of a court order. Owners or breeders generally request the procedure because of excessive animal vocalizations, complaining neighbors, or as an alternative to euthanasia due to a court order.

Contraindications include negative reaction to anesthesia, infection, bleeding, and pain. There is also the possibility of the removed tissue growing back, or of scar tissue blocking the throat, both requiring further surgeries, though with the incisional technique, the risk of fibrosis is virtually eliminated.&lt;ref name=mushing /&gt;

==Effectiveness==

===Canine===
The devocalization procedure does not take away a dog's ability to bark. Dogs will normally bark just as much as before the procedure. After the procedure the sound will be softer, typically about half as loud as before, or less, and it is not as sharp or piercing. So while the procedure does not stop barking or silence the animal completely, it is effective in reducing the sound level and sharpness of the dog's bark.&lt;ref name=noisehelp&gt;[http://www.noisehelp.com/debarking-dogs.html Debarking Dogs: Bark Softening Surgery], April, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Most devocalized dogs have a subdued "husky" bark, audible up to 20 metres.&lt;ref name=dpi&gt;[http://www.dpi.vic.gov.au/dpi/nreninf.nsf/LinkView/1722EE167DB67390CA256C19000EFD4A4E532A5FF42FDB794A256DEA0027A696 Code of practice for debarking of dogs], Bureau of Animal Welfare, Attwood, [[Victoria, Australia]], October, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surgical procedure==
The procedure may be performed via the animal's mouth, with a portion of the vocal folds removed using a biopsy punch, cautery tool, scissor, or laser. The procedure may also be performed via an incision in the throat and through the larynx, which is a more invasive technique.&lt;ref name="Humane Society" /&gt; All devocalization procedures require general anesthesia.&lt;ref name=mushing&gt;[http://www.mushing.com/articles/content.php?vw=2,,0,487 Ventriculocordectomy (“Debarking”)], by Dawn Brown DVM, April 12, 2009, Mushing magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons for excessive vocalization==
Chronic, excessive vocalization may be due to improper socialization or training, stress, boredom, fear, or frustration.&lt;ref name=ida&gt;[http://www.idausa.org/facts/cossurgery.html Cosmetic Surgery for Dogs and Cats], [[In Defense of Animals]]&lt;/ref&gt; Up to 35% of dog owners report problems with barking, which can cause disputes and legal problems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vin.com/VINDBPub/SearchPB/Proceedings/PR05000/PR00017.htm Declawing and Debarking: What are the Alternatives?]: [[World Small Animal Veterinary Association]], World Congress – Vancouver 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The behavior is more common among some breeds of dog, such as the [[Shetland Sheepdog]], which are known as loud barkers, due to the nature of the environment in which the breed was developed.

==Less invasive interventions==
Vocalizations are a natural [[Ethology|behavior]] of animals which they use widely in intra-specific and inter-specific [[Animal communication|communication]].  As such, devocalization should generally be considered only as a last resort.  Prior to this surgical intervention, there are other, less invasive interventions which can be considered to overcome excessive vocalizations.

===Training===
Training can be one of the most effective techniques to help combat excessive barking in dogs. Acquiring the help of a professional dog trainer can often help reduce an animal's barking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Millan|first=Cesar|title=Mr|url=http://www.cesarsway.com/tips/problembehaviors/5-tips-for-handling-nuisance-barking|accessdate=29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corrective collars===
The use of automatic and manual corrective collars can be useful as a training aid when used correctly;{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} however, the use of corrective collars, particularly [[shock collars]], is controversial and banned in some countries.  Types of corrective collars include&lt;ref name=PetSafe&gt;{{cite web|last=Anon|title=PetSafe Products|url=http://www.petsafe.net/products/training-systems/remote-trainers|publisher=PetSafe|accessdate=29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; vibration, citronella spray, ultrasonic and electrostatic/shock collar.

===Accommodation===
Because dogs often bark excessively due to stress, boredom, or frustration, changing aspects of an animal's environment to make them more content is a suitable way to quiet them down, rather than forcibly silencing a distressed animal. Spending more time with an animal, such as playing, walking, and other bonding activities, will keep them occupied and make them feel more at ease. If the animal is stressed, it is best to remove the object that is causing them discomfort.

==Controversy and legislation==

===Reasons opposing===
*In some regions of the US and in the UK, convenience devocalization is considered a form of surgical mutilation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.humanesociety.org/assets/pdfs/hsvma/devocalization-fact-sheet-1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
*Most vets and the [[RSPCA]] offer information to behavioral schools on how to train dogs not to bark.

===Reasons favoring===
*After surgery, dogs are allowed to bark more freely, which is a natural behavior.
*The dog is no longer subject to constant disapproval for its barking. 
*Breeds and individual animals known for excessive barking/vocalizing have a higher chance of being adopted/rescued and not being repeatedly re-homed if/when training fails.
*After debarking, dogs that previously had to be kept indoors to avoid antagonizing neighbors can be allowed outdoors.&lt;ref name=noisehelp/&gt;

===Context===
Dr. Kathy Gaughan points out that "the surgery stops the barking, but it doesn't address why the dog was barking in the first place."&lt;ref name=ua&gt;[http://www.understandinganimals.com/news/8 Debarking surgery won't take away dog's motivation to bark], Understanding Animals&lt;/ref&gt;  Gaughan notes that visitors to her clinic who request debarking are usually looking for a "quick fix".&lt;ref name="ua"/&gt;  Gaughan states that, commonly, those who seek debarking live in apartments, or have neighbors who complain. Gaughan also counts "breeders with many dogs" among those who most often seek convenience devocalization.  However, Dr. Gaughan does not agree with those who claim the procedure is cruel, stating: "Recently, some animal advocates have asserted this surgery is cruel to the animal; some countries have even outlawed the procedure. I do not believe the surgical procedure is cruel; however, failing to address the underlying factors is inappropriate."&lt;ref name=kstate&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediarelations.k-state.edu/WEB/News/Webzine/0201/debarking.html |title=Opinion: The pros and cons of debarking |author=K-State Perspectives |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070523000336/http://www.mediarelations.k-state.edu/WEB/News/Webzine/0201/debarking.html |archivedate=May 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some breeders seek the surgery in order to limit or diminish noise levels for personal reasons ranging from convenience to prevention; some breeders even seek the surgery for puppies prior to going to new homes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

===Opinions of animal welfare societies===
Multiple animal medicine and animal welfare organizations discourage the use of convenience devocalization, recommending that it only be used as a last resort. However, organizations such as the [[American Veterinary Medical Association]], [[American Animal Hospital Association]] and the [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]], oppose laws that would make devocalization illegal.

The [[American Veterinary Medical Association]]'s official position states that "canine devocalization should only be performed by qualified, licensed veterinarians as a final alternative after behavioral modification efforts to correct excessive vocalization have failed." &lt;ref name=avma&gt;[http://www.avma.org/issues/policy/animal_welfare/devocalization.asp AVMA policy: Canine Devocalization] (Approved by the AVMA Executive Board June 2002; reaffirmed April 2008; oversight: Animal Welfare Committee)&lt;/ref&gt;

The AVMA's position was later adopted by the [[American Animal Hospital Association]].&lt;ref name=aaha&gt;[http://student.aahanet.org/eweb/DynamicPage.aspx?site=resources&amp;webcode=referenceDetail&amp;postKey=aeb28db3-a4f3-48fa-97b7-f36055863b4a Canine Devocalization Position Statement], [[American Animal Hospital Association]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=javmanews&gt;[http://www.avma.org/onlnews/javma/dec03/031215e.asp New AAHA position statement opposes cosmetic ear cropping, tail docking]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Canadian Veterinary Medical Association]]'s position statement on devocalization of dogs states: “The Canadian Veterinary Medical Association (CVMA) discourages “devocalization” of dogs unless it is the only alternative to euthanasia, and humane treatment and management methods have failed."&lt;ref name="CVMA"&gt;{{cite web|author=Canadian Veterinary Medical Association|title = CVMA: Devocalization of Dogs – Position Statement|url=https://www.canadianveterinarians.net/documents/devocalization-of-dogs|accessdate=November 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] (ASPCA) recommends that animal caretakers first attempt to address animal behavior problems with humane behavior modification techniques and/or with a treatment protocol set up by an animal behavior specialist. The ASPCA recommends surgery only if behavior modification techniques have failed, and the animal is at risk of losing its home or its life.&lt;ref name=aspca&gt;[http://www.aspca.org/about-us/policy-positions/surgical-procedures-for-resolving-behavior-problems.html Position Statement on Surgical Procedures for Resolving Behavior Problems], [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal restriction and banning===
The legality of convenience devocalization varies by jurisdiction.

The procedure is outlawed as a form of mutilation in the [[United Kingdom]] and all countries that have signed the [[European Convention for the Protection of Pet Animals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European Convention for the Protection of Pet Animals|url=http://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/rms/090000168007a67d|website=Council of Europe|publisher=Council of Europe|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[United States]], devocalization is illegal in [[Massachusetts]], [[New Jersey]], and [[Warwick, Rhode Island]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

====United Kingdom====
Debarking is specifically prohibited in the [[UK]], along with [[ear cropping]], [[tail docking]], and [[declawing]] of cats.&lt;ref name=hastings&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hastings.gov.uk/animal_welfare/ |title=Animal Welfare Charter |accessdate=2008-07-20 |publisher=Hastings Borough Council |quote=It is now illegal for ear cropping and debarking of dogs as well as the [[declawing]] of cats to take place. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121004101/http://www.hastings.gov.uk/animal_welfare/ |archivedate=2008-11-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  By law, convenience devocalization is considered a form of surgical mutilation.

====United States====
In the United States, laws vary by state. In 2000, anti-debarking legislation was proposed in California, New Jersey, and Ohio.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} The California and New Jersey bills failed, partially due to opposition from groups who predicted the ban would lead to similar bans on ear cropping and other controversial cosmetic surgical procedures on dogs.  The Ohio bill survived, and was signed into law by Governor Robert Taft in August 2000.&lt;ref name=apn&gt;[http://www.animalpeoplenews.org/02/5/animalcontrol0502.html Animal control is people control], ''Animal People News'', May 2002&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ohio Revised Code 955.22 only outlawed debarking of dogs considered "vicious".&lt;ref&gt;[http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/955.22 Confining, restraining, debarking dogs.], Ohio Revised Code&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, 15-year-old Jordan Star of [[Needham, Massachusetts]], filed a bill to outlaw performing convenience devocalization procedures upon cats and dogs.&lt;ref name=bostonherald&gt;"[http://www.bostonherald.com/news/regional/view.bg?articleid=1149346 Teen Files Bill to Make Vocal Surgery Illegal]: Putting a Bite into Debarking", ''[[Boston Herald]]''. February 02, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was co-sponsored by Senator [[Scott Brown (politician)|Scott Brown]], with the title ''Logan's Law'', after a debarked sheepdog. Star said of convenience devocalization: "To take a voice away from an animal is morally wrong." The bill became state law on April 23, 2010.

Devocalizing cats and dogs became illegal in Massachusetts by state law in 2010&lt;ref&gt;Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Session Laws, Chapter 82, An Act Prohibiting Devocalization of Dogs and Cats: http://www.malegislature.gov/Laws/SessionLaws/Acts/2010/Chapter82&lt;/ref&gt; and in Warwick, Rhode Island, by city ordinance in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;City of Warwick, RI, Chapter 4 Animals and Fowl, Article IV, Animal Care; Spaying and Neutering Dogs and Cats, Sec. 4-132. Devocalization prohibited: http://www.warwickri.gov/pdfs/cityclerk/2010/PCO-29-10.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Legislation to ban devocalization of dogs and cats in New York State is underway.

'''Electronic Frontier Finland''' ('''Effi''') is a Finnish [[on-line]] [[civil rights]] organization founded in 2001 by Herkko Hietanen, Ville Oksanen and Mikko Välimäki. It had about 1&amp;nbsp;600 members at the end of 2014.&lt;ref name="toimintakertomus-2014"&gt;{{cite web|title=Effi ry:n toimintakertomus 2014|url=https://effi.org/yhdistys/kokoukset/toimintakertomus2014|publisher=Electronic Frontier Finland ry|date=May 23, 2015|accessdate=May 24, 2015|language=fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; While not formally affiliated with the U.S.-based [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], the two organizations share many of their goals.  Effi is a member of the Global Internet Liberty Campaign and a founding member of [[EDRI|European Digital Rights (EDRi)]].

Effi's stated aim is to protect and promote [[freedom of speech]] and [[privacy]] on the [[Internet]] as well as in Finnish society in general.  Among other things, Effi has lobbied for effective [[anti-spam]] legislation and against [[software patent]]s.  Effi has also assumed a leading role on certain [[consumer rights]] issues such as [[CD copy protection]], in part due to the reluctance of traditional Finnish [[consumer protection]] agencies to address them.

Effi presents the annual Finnish [[Big Brother Awards (Finland)|Big Brother Awards]] in cooperation with [[Privacy International]].

Board members include Tapani Tarvainen, Leena Romppainen and Timo Karjalainen as chairman.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8943">The '''Ephebic Oath''' was an [[oath]] sworn by young men of [[Classical Athens]], typically eighteen-year-old sons of Athenian citizens, upon induction into the military academy, the [[Ephebos#In_Greece|Ephebic College]],&lt;ref&gt;John Wilson Taylor, 'The Athenian ephebic oath', ''Classical journal'' (1918), 495-501.&lt;/ref&gt; graduation from which was required to attain status as [[Athenian_democracy#Citizenship_in_Athens|citizens]].  The applicant would have been dressed in full armour, shield and spear in his left hand, his right hand raised and touching the right hand of the moderator.&lt;ref&gt;John Wilson Taylor, p.497.&lt;/ref&gt;  The oath was quoted by the [[Attic orators|Attic orator]] [[Lycurgus of Athens|Lycurgus]], in his work ''Against Leocrates'' (4th century BCE), though it is certainly [[Archaic Greece|archaic]] (5th century BCE).&lt;ref&gt;Josiah Ober, ''Fortress Attica: defense of the Athenian land frontier, 404-322 B.C.'', Brill, 1985, p.91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosalind Thomas, ''Oral tradition and written record in classical Athens'', Cambridge University Press, 1991, p.85&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Ephebate'', an organization for training the young men of Athens, chiefly in military matters, had existed since the 5th century but was reorganized by Lycurgus. The oath was taken in the temple of [[Aglaulus, daughter of Cecrops|Aglaurus]], daughter of [[Cecrops I|Cecrops]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Demosthenes]], ''On the False Embassy'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Dem.%2019.303&amp;lang=original 19.33]&lt;/ref&gt; probably at the age of eighteen when the youth underwent an examination ([[Greek language|Greek]]: δοκιμασία&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Ddokimasi%2Fa δοκιμασία], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;) and had his name entered on the [[deme]] register.

=== English translation ===
I will not bring dishonour on my sacred arms nor will I abandon my comrade wherever I shall be stationed. I will defend the rights of gods and men and will not leave my country smaller, when I die, but greater and better, so far as I am able by myself and with the help of all. I will respect the rulers of the time duly and the existing ordinances duly and all others which may be established in the future. Furthermore, if anyone seeks to destroy the ordinances I will oppose him so far as I am able by myself and with the help of all. I will honor the cults of my fathers. Witnesses to this shall be the gods Agraulus, Hestia, Enyo, Enyalius, Ares, Athena the Warrior, Zeus, Thallo, Auxo, Hegemone, Heracles, and the boundaries of my native land, wheat, barley, vines, olive-trees, fig-trees...&lt;ref&gt;[[Lycurgus of Athens|Lycurgus]], ''Against Leocrates'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0152%3Aspeech%3D1%3Asection%3D77 1.77], English translation&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alternative English translation ===
I will never bring reproach upon my hallowed arms, nor will I desert the comrade at whose side I stand, but I will defend our altars and our hearths, single-handed or supported by many.  My native land I will not leave a diminished heritage, but greater and better than when I received it.  I will obey whoever is in authority, and submit to the established laws and all others that the people shall harmoniously enact.  If anyone tries to overthrow the constitution or disobeys it, I will not permit him, but will come to its defence single-handed or with the support of all.  I will honour the religion of my fathers.  Let the gods be my witness: Agraulus, Enyalius, Ares, Zeus, Thallo, Auxo, Hegemone.&lt;ref&gt;John Wilson Taylor, ''op. cit.'' p.499.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern use==
The oath has been revived for use in educational institutions worldwide as a statement of civic virtue.

=== Examples ===
{{quote box|quote=''We will ever strive for the ideals and sacred things of the city, both alone and with many; We will unceasingly seek to quicken the sense of public duty; We will revere and obey the city’s laws; We will transmit this city not only not less, but greater, better and more beautiful than it was transmitted to us.''|source=-found in the foyer of the [[Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs]]}}

{{quote box|quote=''I will not disgrace these sacred arms, nor ever desert a comrade in the ranks. I will guard the Temples and the Centers of Civic Life, and uphold the ideals of my Country, both alone and in concert with others. I will at all times obey the Magistrates and observe the Laws as well those at present in force as those the Majority may hereafter enact. Should any one seek to subvert those laws or set them aside, Him I will oppose either in common with others or alone. In these ways it shall be my constant aim not only to preserve the things of worth in my Native Land, but to make them of still greater worth.''|source=-inscribed on a bronze plaque at the [[Thacher School]], and given the title "Oath of the Young Men of Athens"}}

{{quote box|quote=''I shall never bring disgrace to my city, nor shall I ever desert my comrades in the ranks: but I, both alone and with my many comrades, shall fight for the ideals and sacred things of the city.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9451">A '''foreign legal opinion''' (or '''foreign law opinion''') is an opinion of a [[law firm]] issued in cross-border commercial transactions certifying the effectiveness of the transaction under the applicable foreign law.&lt;ref&gt;"In most important international business transactions ... opinions of counsel are required as a condition precedent to the consummation or 'closing' of the transaction."{{cite book|title=Legal Opinions in International Transactions|author=Michael Gruson, Stephan Hutter and Michael Kutschera|publisher=Kluwer Law International|page=8|isbn=9041109447}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Foreign legal opinions have become highly standardised over time, and most foreign legal opinions follow a fairly regimented format.  The issuance of such opinions has become something of a sub-legal specialisation in itself, and books&lt;ref name=gruson&gt;{{cite book|title=Legal Opinions in International Transactions|author=Michael Gruson, Stephan Hutter and Michael Kutschera|publisher=Kluwer Law International|isbn=9041109447}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Offshore Legal Opinions in Loan and Security Transactions|author=Andrew Bridgeford|publisher=[[Sweet &amp; Maxwell]]|isbn=0421507705}}&lt;/ref&gt; and articles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fuld |first=James J. |title=Foreign Legal Opinions in American Business Transactions |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/ibl3&amp;div=9&amp;id=&amp;page= |journal=Int'l Bus Law |volume=3(i) |page=15 |accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; are written on the subject of foreign legal opinions.  A number of organisations issue template format opinions to indicate issues which are intended to be covered by such opinions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.citysolicitors.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;id=162&amp;Itemid=471| title=Draft Foreign Legal Opinion on Transactions Relating to Property In England and Wales| publisher=City of London Law Society| accessdate=18 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or standard form checklists for contents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.practicallaw.com/5-238-3952 |title=Contents of a foreign legal opinion on security: checklist| publisher=Thompson Reuters (Practical Law)| accessdate=18 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==

The original purpose of foreign legal opinion is grounded in the historical doctrine of ''[[ultra vires]]''.  The concern was that when doing business with a [[corporation]] formed in a foreign country, proper due diligence required that a legal opinion be sought to ensure that the relevant foreign company had the necessary [[Capacity (law)#Business entities|capacity and power]] to enter into the transaction, and that it would be binding upon it.&lt;ref&gt;''Banco de Bilbao v Sancha''; ''Banco de Bilbao v Rey'' [1938] 2 KB 176, CA&lt;/ref&gt;  Over time opinions expanded to cover related aspects of foreign law, such as whether payments might be subject to [[Foreign exchange controls|exchange controls]] or [[Usury#Usury law|usury laws]], whether it was necessary for any of the other parties to hold any licences or permits under the [[Regulation|regulatory laws]] of the foreign country, whether there would be adverse [[tax]] consequences under the laws of the foreign country, whether foreign judgments were recognised and enforced in that country other collateral matters.

During the 1970s and 1980s with the expansions in cross-border lender by financial institutions, [[bank]]s became increasingly concerned to ensure that foreign companies to whom they lent money provided a foreign legal opinion certifying the legal validity of the [[loan agreement|loan transaction]] and the enforceability of the banks' rights (including any [[security interest]]s).&lt;ref name=gruson/&gt;  In time these requires came to be reflected in the [[Basel Accords|Basel capital adequacy requirements]] for banks, resulting in different, more favourable, capital weighting for loans supported by opinions.

==Format==

Foreign legal opinions are now highly standardised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=International Loans, Bonds, Guarantees, Legal Opinions |author=Philip R. Wood |url=https://books.google.vg/books?id=Lu3Hkc348loC&amp;pg=PT487&amp;lpg=PT487&amp;dq=foreign+legal+opinions&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MB--J7F85y&amp;sig=IUV2jlMhQps6a29eoZVpnU9Nzac&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cGXyU_GzLq3KsQSqhYHQDw&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=foreign%20legal%20opinions&amp;f=false |at=26-094|isbn=1847032087}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Typically such opinions will confirm the jurisdiction which they relate to, confirm the documents that they reviewed, list certain assumptions of fact, and then set out various opinion statements.  After the opinion statements, they will typically make certain standard, generally applicable qualifications.

The opinion will ordinarily state the conclusions of law, but will not provide reasoning.  This reflects the role of the foreign law opinion as a risk assessment tool.  The opinion is normally issued in the format of an unqualified favourable statement of the effectiveness of the transaction (hedged in by appropriate assumptions of fact and general qualifications of law).&lt;ref name=gruson/&gt;  Where there are areas of legal uncertainty, or issues which require clarification and analysis, the foreign legal opinion will often remain in the standardised format, but will be supplemented with a second, reasoned, opinion.  In cross border transactions the negotiation and discussion of the format of the foreign law opinions elucidates areas of legal stress or risk in relation to the proposed transaction and foreign legal systems.&lt;ref name=gruson/&gt;

Standard assumptions normally include assuming that documents and records reviewed by the law firm giving the opinion are accurate, that all copies they review are true copies, and that no provision of any other law (i.e. the laws of any country other than the country on whose laws the opinion is being given) adversely affects the opinion being expressed.  In certain countries it is also standard to assume the genuineness of signatures and [[company seal|seals]], but in other countries the foreign law firm may be expected to verify the accuracy of such signatures.

The substantive opinion statements a foreign legal opinion will make will ordinarily include:
# that the relevant obligations be recognised as constituting valid and binding obligations of the foreign party;
# which person or organ has power on behalf of the foreign entity to enter into the transaction;
# the proper method of execution of documents by the foreign party;
# that the transaction does not breach the constitutional documents of the foreign entity, or the laws of the foreign country (and, sometimes, any agreements which are binding upon the foreign entity and its assets);
# that no approvals or licences are required in the foreign country in relation to the transaction;
# that the transaction documents are not subject to stamp duty or registration requirements in the foreign country;
# that no withholding or other taxes apply to the transaction in the foreign country;
# that the foreign entity does not have [[sovereign immunity]] under the laws of the foreign country;
# that there are no exchange control regulations in the foreign country which would affect the transaction;
# that the foreign entity is in good standing, and is not subject to winding-up or dissolution;
# to what extent judgments or [[arbitral award]]s from another country would be recognised and enforced in the foreign country (without re-examination of the merits);
# the efficacy of [[choice of law clause]]s and [[jurisdiction clause]]s in the foreign jurisdiction;
# whether any terms of the transaction contravene [[public policy]] in the foreign country; and
# whether any of the other parties to the transaction (other than the foreign entity) would be treated as carrying on business or subject to tax in the foreign country by entering into the transaction.

Standard qualifications are usually matters of general law which it is impractical to advise upon in the abstract, but which might undermine the effectiveness of the enforceability of the transaction.  For example most opinions will indicate that if the foreign party goes into bankruptcy that will limit the ability to enforce obligations against it.  Similarly, rights may be lost when statutory [[limitation period]]s expire.  In certain countries enforcement of obligations may be subject to obligations of good faith and fair dealing, and the foreign legal opinion will normally point this out by way of qualification.

==Conflicts of laws==
The foreign legal opinion will typically express opinions on various issues which might not ordinarily be governed by the laws of the foreign country under its own [[conflict of laws]] system.  Because a cross border transaction might end up being considered by the courts of any of a number of countries, the addressee(s) of the opinion will wish to be assured that all relevant issues, if determined by that foreign law, would likely be resolved satisfactorily.  The courts of a third country may apply different choice of law rules to determine the ''[[lex causae]]'' of a particular issue to the courts of the foreign country.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21629">The French '''HADOPI law''' or '''Creation and Internet law''' ({{lang-fr|Haute Autorité pour la Diffusion des Œuvres et la Protection des droits d'auteur sur Internet}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senat.fr/dossierleg/pjl07-405.html|title=Projet de loi favorisant la diffusion et la protection de la création sur Internet|language=French|publisher=[[French Senate]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, loosely in English, "Supreme Authority for the Distribution and Protection of Intellectual Property on the Internet") was introduced during 2009, providing what is known as a [[graduated response]] as a means to encourage compliance with [[copyright law]]s.  HADOPI is the [[acronym]] of the government agency created to administer it.

The part of the ''HADOPI law'' that allowed for suspension of internet access to a repeat infringer  was revoked on 8 July 2013 by the French government because that penalty was considered to be disproportionate. The power to impose fines or other sanctions on repeat infringers remains in effect.

==Legislative passage==
Despite strong backing from President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], the bill was rejected by the [[French National Assembly]] on 9 April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7992262.stm|title=French reject internet piracy law'|work=BBC News Online|date=9 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Lizzy|last=Davies|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/apr/09/france-illegal-downloads-state-surveillance|title=French MPs reject controversial plan to crack down on illegal downloaders|work=Guardian Unlimited|date=9 April 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Charles|last=Bremner|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article6067641.ece|title=Setback for Sarkozy as French parliament rejects controversial internet law|work=Times Online|location=London|date=2 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[French government]] asked for reconsideration of the bill by the French National Assembly and it was adopted on 12 May 2009 by the assembly,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20090512-lawmakers-adopt-internet-anti-piracy-bill-illegal-downloading-France|title=Lawmakers adopt Internet anti-piracy bill|work=France 24|date=12 May 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515105835/http://www.france24.com/en/20090512-lawmakers-adopt-internet-anti-piracy-bill-illegal-downloading-France|archivedate=15 May 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 13 May 2009 by the [[French Senate]].

Debate included accusations of dubious tactics made against the promoters of the bill. There were complaints that the government's official website misrepresented the bill,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=French|url=http://www.pcinpact.com/actu/news/47012-jaimelesartistesfr-partenaires-christine-albanel-riposte.htm|title=Jaimelesartistes.fr, Albanel explique pourquoi ca-va-couper.fr|work=PC Inpact|date=31 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the French Wikipedia pages on it were falsified by the Ministry of Culture on 14 February 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marianne2.fr/Comment-Albanel-arrange-Hadopi-dans-Wikipedia_a179590.html|title=Comment Albanel "arrange" Hadopi dans Wikipedia|date=11 May 2009|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a "petition of 10,000 artists" in support of the bill was questioned as allegedly fraudulent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/high-tech/hadopi-couacs-autour-de-la-petition-des-10-000-artistes_754193.html|title=Hadopi: couacs autour de la pétition des 10 000 artistes|work=L'Express|language=French|first=Julie|last=Saulnier|date=15 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Timeline===
*The bill was presented to the [[French Senate]] by the government on June 18, 2008.
*On October 23, 2008, the government shortened the debate by making the bill a ''matter of urgency'', meaning it could be read only once in each chamber, under art. 45 of the [[French constitution]].
*The bill was adopted by the Senate on October 30, 2008.
*The bill was presented to the [[French National Assembly|Assembly]] on March 11, 2009 where it was amended and the amended version adopted on April 2, 2009.
*Since the two legislative chambers had now adopted different versions, a parliamentary commission (seven members of the Senate and seven members of the Assembly) was constituted on April 7, 2009, mandated to produce a common text to be voted on by both chambers without further debate.
*The resultant bill was unanimously adopted by the Senate on April 9, 2009. On the same day, it was defeated in the Assembly (21-15), a consequence of absenteeism on the part of [[French socialist party]] MPs who later explained themselves in an open letter to the newspaper ''[[Libération]]''.&lt;ref&gt;(French) [http://www.liberation.fr/medias/0101564207-on-ne-s-excuse-pas-d-avoir-rejete-hadopi ] '' [[Libération]]'' April 27, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; published on April 27, 2009; coauthored by [[Jean-Marc Ayrault]], [[Patrick Bloche]], [[François Brottes]], [[Corinne Erhel]], [[Michel Françaix]], [[Jean-Louis Gagnaire]], [[Didier Mathus]], [[Sandrine Mazetier]], [[Christian Paul (politician)|Christian Paul]]
*The bill was re-presented to the National Assembly on April 29 when 499 amendments were moved, most of which were rejected&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090311024823/http://recherche.assemblee-nationale.fr/amendements/resultats2.asp?NUM_INIT=1240&amp;LEGISLATURE=13 (French)] &lt;/ref&gt;
*The amended bill was adopted by the Assembly on May 12, 2009  (296-233).  All present [[French socialist party]] members voted against it except [[Jack Lang (French politician)|Jack Lang]]
*The Senate voted in favor of the bill on May 13, (189-14), all senators of the socialist party abstaining, except [[Samia Ghali]].
*On May 17, members of the National Assembly contested the constitutionality of the law and submitted it to the Constitutional Council for examination.
*On June 10, the Constitutional Council declared the main part of the bill unconstitutional, therefore making it useless. The council found that the law violated the 1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]], and in particular presumption of innocence, separation of powers and freedom of speech.&lt;ref&gt;see Lucchi, N., Access to Network Services and Protection of Constitutional Rights: Recognizing the Essential Role of Internet Access for the Freedom of Expression (February 6, 2011).

* On 22 October 2009, the Constitutional Council approved a revised version of HADOPI, requiring judicial review before revoking a person's internet access, but otherwise resembling the original requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/23/technology/23net.html|work=New York Times|title=France Approves Wide Crackdown on Net Piracy|first=Eric|last=Pfanner|date=22 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details of the law==

===Government agency===
The law creates a government agency called ''Haute Autorité pour la Diffusion des Œuvres et la Protection des Droits sur Internet'' (HADOPI) (English: ''Supreme Authority for the Distribution and Protection of Intellectual Property on the Internet''); replacing a previous agency, the ARMT (Regulation of Technical Measures Authority) created by the [[DADVSI law]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000274482&amp;dateTexte= (French)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The new government agency is headed by a board of nine members, three appointed by the government, two by the legislative bodies, three by judicial bodies and one by the ''[[Conseil supérieur de la propriété littéraire et artistique]]'' (Superior Council of Artistic and Literary Property), a government council responsible to the [[French Ministry of Culture]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cspla.culture.gouv.fr/ (French)]&lt;/ref&gt; The agency is vested with the power to police Internet users.

===Mandate===
To ensure that internet subscribers "screen their internet connections in order to prevent the exchange of copyrighted material without prior agreement from the copyright holders" (Art. L. 336-3 of the bill). HADOPI also retains mandates previously attributed to the ARMT.

===Enforcement===
On receipt of a complaint from a copyright holder or representative, HADOPI may initiate a 'three-strike' procedure:

*(1) '''An email message''' is sent to the offending internet access subscriber, derived from the [[IP address]] involved in the claim.  The email specifies the time of the claim but neither the object of the claim nor the identity of the claimant.

The [[ISP]] is then required to monitor the subject internet connection. In addition, the internet access subscriber is invited to install a filter on his internet connection.

If, in the 6 months following the first step, a repeat offense is suspected by the copyright holder, his representative, the ISP or HADOPI, the second step of the procedure is invoked.

*(2) A certified letter is sent to the offending internet access subscriber with similar content to the originating email message.

In the event that the offender fails to comply during the year following the reception of the certified letter, and upon accusation of repeated offenses by the copyright holder, a representative, the ISP or HADOPI, the third step of the procedure is invoked.

*(3) The HADOPI can send the offender case to the court which can return a verdict of a maximum fine of 1500 euros. Until its abrogation in 2013, the court could add an additional sentence of suspending internet access for one month maximum. By the law, it was impossible to suspend internet access without, first, sentence the fine.

Offender can seek recourse against the HADOPI, before case transmission, and against the court.

The internet access subscriber was blacklisted and other ISPs were prohibited from providing an internet connection to the blacklisted subscriber. The service suspension did not, however, interrupt billing, and the offending subscriber was liable to meet any charges or costs resulting from the service termination.

According to the [[CNIL]], action under the HADOPI law does not exclude separate prosecution under the [[French code of Intellectual Property]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCode.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006069414&amp;dateTexte=20080129 (French)]&lt;/ref&gt; particularly its articles L331-1 or L335-2, or limit a claimant's other remedies at law. (See [[HADOPI law#CNIL opinion|CNIL opinion, below]]).

====Enforcement in practice====
Since the law was approved in 2009 until abrogation of the suspension of access to a communication service in 2013, only one user has been sentenced to suspension (for 15 days) plus fined for EUR 600.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57593000-93/french-three-strikes-law-no-longer-suspends-net-access/&lt;/ref&gt; The sentence never applied because of the abrogation some days after.

=== Abrogation of the suspension of access to a communication service ===

On 9 July 2013, the French Ministry of Culture published official decree No. 0157, removing from the law "the additional misdemeanor punishable by suspension of access to a communication service."&lt;ref&gt;http://torrentfreak.com/three-strikes-and-youre-still-in-france-kills-piracy-disconnections-130709/&lt;/ref&gt; allegedly because "the three strikes mechanism had failed to benefit authorized services as promised".  The Minister explained that the stricter copyright policy of the French Government would be revised from going after the end-user to taking punitive sanctions against companies who provide web hosting and telecom infrastructure services which allow copyright infringement to occur. Nevertheless, the fines against users found to be sharing unauthorized content remained standing ("up to EUR 1500 in cases of gross negligence"), and ISPs are still required to provide details to identify them.

The French Culture Minister Aurélie Filippetti explained that the financial costs to the French Government in applying the Hadopi Law was not sound. She disclosed that it cost her Ministry 12 million Euros and 60 civil servants to send 1 million e-mails to copyright infringers and 99,000 registered letters, with only 134 cases examined for prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;http://the1709blog.blogspot.com.br/2012/08/hadopi-failure-warning-for-uk.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Implementation of the [[European Copyright Directive]] resulted in the French [[DADVSI law]] which has been in force since 2007, creating the crime of ''lack of screening of Internet connections in order to prevent  exchange of copyrighted material without prior agreement from the copyright holders'' (art. L335.12).&lt;ref&gt;(French) [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do;jsessionid=63A46FAE0F679E2D1ACE0496FE9334BF.tpdjo09v_1?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006069414&amp;idArticle=LEGIARTI000006279242&amp;dateTexte=20090513&amp;categorieLien=id Article L335-12] Code de la propriété intellectuelle, Legifrance&lt;/ref&gt; The DADVSI law did not prescribe any punishment.
It has been partially invalidated by the [[Constitutional Council of France]]'s rejection of the principle of escalation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/francais/les-decisions/depuis-1958/decisions-par-date/2006/2006-540-dc/decision-n-2006-540-dc-du-27-juillet-2006.1011.html (French)]&lt;/ref&gt; and retains only the crime of copyright-infringement, punishable by up to 3 years' prison and a fine of up to €300,000.

The HADOPI law is supposed to address the concerns of the Constitutional Council of France, in addition to replacing the DADVSI law, which has yet to be enforced.

===Olivennes report and Élysée agreement===
On September 5, 2007, the [[Minister of Culture (France)|French Minister of Culture]], [[Christine Albanel]] asked the CEO of the major French entertainment [[Retailing|retailer]] ([[Fnac]]), [[Denis Olivennes]], to lead a [[task force]] to study a three-strike sanction, to conform with the ruling of the French Constitutional Council. After consulting representatives of the entertainment industry, internet service providers and consumer associations, the Olivennes committee reported to the Minister on November 23.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/actualites/conferen/albanel/rapportolivennes231107.pdf (French)]&lt;/ref&gt; The report was signed by 40 companies at the [[Élysée]] and presented as the "Olivennes agreement". It was later renamed the "Élysée agreement".

The HADOPI law is the implementation of the Olivennes report, supported by the Olivennes agreement, in which representatives of the entertainment and media industries gave their assent to the law's enforcement procedures. Nevertheless, some companies, notably the ISPs [[Orange (telecommunications)|Orange]] and [[Free (ISP)|Free]], later dissented from the agreement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clubic.com/actualite-171490-fai-free-orange-denonce-projet-hadopi.html (French)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lobbying for the bill==
Owing to its controversial nature, the bill became a subject of intense campaigning in various media, which was redoubled after its parliamentary defeat on April 9, 2009.

===President Sarkozy's Brussels Intervention===
On October 4, 2008, the then French President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], a personal supporter of the law, interceded with the president of the [[European Commission]] regarding an amendment to the EU Telecoms Package that targeted the HADOPI law and the lack of a judicial ruling in the original drafting of it.&lt;ref name="Horten, M, "&gt;[http://www.palgrave.com/products/title.aspx?PID=526246 Horten, M, The Copyright Enforcement Enigma – Internet Politics and the Telecoms Package] page 166-174.&lt;/ref&gt; This was Amendment 138 to the Framework directive as adopted by the European Parliament in the First Reading of the  [[Telecoms Package]].  The European Commission's response to Sarkozy was that it supported Amendment 138. That remained its position until the Telecoms Package was finally adopted with the so-called Freedom Provision (Directive 2009/140/EC, Article 1.3a).

===Government===
The French government created a promotional website in support of the country's entertainment industry. The content of the website was criticised as misleading.&lt;ref&gt;(French) [http://www.pcinpact.com/actu/news/47012-jaimelesartistesfr-partenaires-christine-albanel-riposte.htm Jaimelesartistes.fr, Albanel explique pourquoi ca-va-couper.fr] at PCINpact.com&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also alleged that French Wikipedia pages relative to HADOPI were edited by the Ministry of Culture on February 14, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;(French) [http://www.marianne2.fr/Comment-Albanel-arrange-Hadopi-dans-Wikipedia_a179590.html Comment Albanel «arrange» Hadopi dans Wikipedia] at [[Marianne|Marianne2]], 11 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Entertainment industry===
[[Société des auteurs, compositeurs et éditeurs de musique|SACEM]] and other entertainment industry players mounted a petition of  "10,000 artists" in support of the HADOPI law. The list has been challenged on several grounds:
*Many signatories are said to be unconnected with artistic activities ascribed to them.
*Some signatories are bogus or fictitious, an example being [[Paul Atreides]].&lt;ref&gt;(French) [http://www.pcinpact.com/actu/news/50333-liste-10000-signataires-creation-internet.htm La liste des 10 000 signataires] at pcinpact.com, 15 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
*Some artists listed as signatories have denied that they support it.&lt;ref&gt;(French) [http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/high-tech/hadopi-couacs-autour-de-la-petition-des-10-000-artistes_754193.html Hadopi: couacs autour de la pétition des 10 000 artistes] at L'Express, 15 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consumer associations===
The leading French consumer association [[UFC Que Choisir]] has positioned itself against the law and has set up a website to support opposition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca-va-couper.fr/ (French)]&lt;/ref&gt;

A group called ''[[La Quadrature du Net]]'' is a strong lobbyist against the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laquadrature.net/en/search/node/HADOPI Items on HADOPI]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following an open letter in the newspaper  [[Libération]] signed by [[Chantal Akerman]], [[Christophe Honoré]], [[Jean-Pierre Limosin]], [[Zina Modiano]], [[Gaël Morel]], [[Victoria Abril]], [[Catherine Deneuve]], [[Louis Garrel]], [[Yann Gonzalez]], [[Clotilde Hesme]], [[Chiara Mastroianni]], [[Agathe Berman]] and [[Paulo Branco]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liberation.fr/culture/0101560675-lettre-ouverte-aux-spectateurs-citoyens (French)]&lt;/ref&gt; which was published on April 7, 2009, and co-authored notably by [[Victoria Abril]] and [[Catherine Deneuve]], an informal group has been constituted under the name  ''Creation Public Internet''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://creationpublicinternet.fr/blog/index.php?post/2009/04/22/Qui-sommes-nous Qui sommes nous?]&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 12, 2009, the British [[Featured Artists Coalition]] publicised its opposition to the principle of the HADOPI law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/its-not-a-crime-to-download-say-musicians-1643217.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=It's not a crime to download, say musicians | first=Arifa | last=Akbar | date=2009-03-12 | accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political groups' positions==
With the exception of the [[French Green Party]] who campaigned against the law, other political groups represented in the legislative chambers were not active lobbying for or against the law, though individual members did so. The [[French Socialist Party]] was probably the most divided. While it initially favored the law  (voted ''yes'' in the Senate's first reading), it was chiefly responsible for the surprise rejection of the bill after the first reading in the National Assembly, as well as requesting the [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]]'s ruling. The [[Pirate Party (France)]] although not represented in the legislative chambers also campaigned against the law.

==Logo incident==
Shortly after HADOPI's agency logo was presented to the public by Minister of Culture and Communication [[Frédéric Mitterrand]], it was revealed that the logo used an unlicensed font. The font was created by typeface designer [[Jean François Porchez]], and is owned by [[France Télécom]]. The design agency that drew the logo, Plan Créatif, admitted to using the font by mistake and the logo was redone with another font.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/6974249/Anti-piracy-agencys-logo-broke-copyright.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Anti-piracy agency's logo broke copyright | date=2010-01-12 | accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Incapacity Benefit''' is a British social security benefit that was introduced in 1995 in an attempt to control the rising number of people on out-of-work sickness benefits. In 2008, the government began to phase it out by making it unavailable to new claimants.

Between 2011 and 2016 a compulsory reassessment programme moved most pre-2008 Incapacity Benefit recipients onto [[Employment and Support Allowance]], so that by May 2017 fewer than 3000 people were still receiving the full rate of the old benefit (another 70,000 were receiving National Insurance credits).&lt;ref&gt;NOMIS - May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

By rooting out weak claims and encouraging people with moderate disabilities to find suitable jobs, this reassessment programme was supposed to have saved seven billion pounds a year from the welfare budget by 2018.&lt;ref name="Hutton unveils benefits shake-up"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4641588.stm |title=Hutton unveils benefits shake-up |publisher=BBC News |date=24 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, this major Whitehall project failed to generate any savings for the [[Exchequer]].&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=BBC|date=13 October 2016|title=Welfare reforms not made expected savings, says OBR|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37648864}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of Incapacity Benefit==

=== 1911 and 1945 ===
In Britain, sickness benefits were introduced by [[David Lloyd George]], [[Winston Churchill]] and other [[liberal welfare reforms|reformers]] as one of a number of changes to social security brought about by the [[National Insurance Act 1911]]. These Edwardian-era reforms were incorporated into the [[Welfare State]] after the Second World War — although until the early 1970s, the post-war National Insurance scheme treated everyone who became eligible for benefits after losing their job in largely the same way, regardless of whether or not they were disabled.&lt;ref name="lse.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/6490/1/The_Evolution_of_Disability_Benefits_in_the_UK_Re-weighting_the_basket.pdf|title=The Evolution of Disability Benefits in the UK: Re-weighting the basket|author=Tania Burchardt|format=pdf|date=June 1999|publisher=Centre for Analysis of Social Exclusion at the London School of Economics|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long-term illness and disability were also addressed to some extent through [[National Assistance]] and, from 1966, [[Supplementary Benefit]].

===1971===
The prime minister [[Edward Heath]] and his secretary of state at the [[DHSS]], [[Keith Joseph]], brought in a raft of new social security payments including Invalidity Benefit, which was introduced in 1971 to go some way towards replacing the wages of people who had been 'invalided out' of their occupation after developing a long-term illness or a disability. It was worth more than [[unemployment benefit]] that was paid to people without disabilities.

Tania Burchardt from the London School of Economics has described the 1970s and 1980s as decades that were notable for an "improvement of the coverage of earnings-replacement benefits".&lt;ref name="lse.ac.uk"/&gt;

===1995===
In 1995, the Conservative Secretary of State for Social Security, [[Peter Lilley]], abolished Invalidity Benefit and replaced it with Incapacity Benefit after the Prime Minister of the day, [[John Major]], had complained about the burgeoning caseload, saying: "Frankly, it beggars belief that so many more people have suddenly become invalids, especially at a time when the health of the population has improved".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199293/cmhansrd/1993-06-15/Orals-2.html|title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 15 Jun 1993|first=Department of the Official Report (Hansard), House of Commons,|last=Westminster|website=www.publications.parliament.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new feature of Incapacity Benefit was that officials could ask for claimants' disabilities to be confirmed using a bespoke testing procedure – the All Work Test – carried out by doctors working for the government. Another feature was that claimants would be assessed on their ability to do any job, not just their old trade. And unlike its predecessor, Incapacity Benefit was taxable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Social security benefits: incapacity benefit: summary |author=| publisher = www.hmrc.gov.uk| url = http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/eim76180.htm|accessdate = 2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the caseload continued to rise.

After 2000, some recipients underwent a Personal Capability Assessment to establish whether their condition had improved: if it had, benefit payments could be withdrawn; otherwise, a Capability Report was drawn up by the examining doctor and used by Job Centre staff to plan ways to boost recipients' employability, in the hope of returning them to work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nypolfed.org.uk/assets/uploads/PDFs/incapacity2.pdf|title=A guide to Incapacity Benefit – The Personal Capability Assessment|format=pdf|publisher=Jobcentre Plus|accessdate=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new test was also used to assess some fresh claims for Incapacity Benefit.

In 2004, the caseload peaked at just under 2,500,000 then began to fall slowly.

===2008===
In late 2008, New Labour replaced Incapacity Benefit with [[Employment and Support Allowance]] (ESA) for new claims and yet another eligibility test was introduced: the Work Capability Assessment. At the same time, capacity was boosted by bringing in nurses to carry out the bulk of the medical assessments using a new semi-structured interview technique, with the findings recorded in digital format. This meant that from 2008, most new claims were scrutinised by a healthcare professional; those whose claims reached the threshold for eligibility were granted ESA - either shortly after the initial assessment, following an internal review of the initial decision, or after an external appeal.

After the introduction of ESA, the number of remaining Incapacity Benefit recipients dwindled (largely as people came off the benefit for reasons such as reaching the State Pension age): by early 2011, the Incapacity Benefit caseload had shrunk by more than 500,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/477328/dwp-stats-summary-nov-2015.pdf|date=May 2015|title=DWP Quarterly Benefits Summary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011 to 2016===
The [[Coalition government]] decided to implement the plan to reassess most remaining Incapacity Benefit recipients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Coalition: our programme for government|url=http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/409088/pfg_coalition.pdf|page=23|accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reassessment programme, which began in early 2011 and was effectively completed in 2016, used an updated version of the [[Work Capability Assessment]]. Recipients confirmed as having 'limited capability for work' – often colloquially, but not technically accurately, referred to as being 'unfit for work' – were transferred onto ESA; any found fully capable of work would, in theory, have had their Incapacity Benefit payments stopped and then been invited to consider applying for [[Jobseekers Allowance]] (JSA).

In practice, many Incapacity Benefit recipients declared 'fit for work' formally appealed against the decision, at which stage 40% of decisions challenged were overturned and the claimant moved onto ESA, not JSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/appeals-against-dwp-fit-to-work-decisions-more-successful-than-ever-before-10495119.html|title=Appeals against DWP 'fit to work' decisions more successful than ever before|author=Jon Stone|date=10 September 2015|newspaper=The Independent|accessdate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, some people taken off Incapacity Benefit after their reassessment claimed ESA successfully at a later date when their illness worsened.

By May 2017, fewer than 3000 people were still receiving the old payment — although the number of people on Employment and Support Allowance had grown from zero to more than 2.4 million over the preceding nine years.

==Criticisms of Incapacity Benefit==

=== The number of claimants was "out of control" ===
The number of claimants of sickness benefits increased rapidly from the mid-1980s. The trend was investigated in a series of studies commissioned by the government in 1991 and published in 1993. Several possible causes were identified:
* A higher level of background unemployment; a decline in manual work; less accommodating workplaces
* An increased readiness by GPs to issue sick-notes; longer hospital waiting times; changing patterns of illness
* The relative generosity of the different out-of-work benefit payments
* Changes specific to [[Unemployment Benefit]], with more conditions being attached to it
* More women working and paying National Insurance contributions, and so qualifying for benefits
* More claims being made by people who had not previously claimed, despite being entitled to
* Administrative changes to the benefits system in general, which tended to deter people from changing their status

The House of Commons research paper that summarised the studies' findings in the 1990s concluded that the number of new claims and their general pattern had not changed significantly; what had changed was the rate at which recipients were coming ''off'' the benefit to move back into work (after their illness had begun to improve, for instance, or by finding a job ''despite'' their disability) - it had fallen.

The bulk of the rise in the caseload occurred during the late 1980s, the 1990s and the first years of the 21st century. In 2004, the caseload began to ''fall'' slowly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niesr.ac.uk/blog/welfare-savings-and-incapacity-benefits#.Vof3rhH8Hx5|title=Welfare savings and incapacity benefits|author=Jonathan Portes|date=16 Apr 2015|publisher=National Institute of Economic and Social Research|accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eligibility testing procedures were lax ===
Ministers complained about a "sick-note culture" that allowed people to drift onto Incapacity Benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7253577.stm|title=Bid to tackle 'sick-note culture'|date=20 February 2008|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A medical certificate from a GP is the first step onto sickness benefits; although a government-run eligibility test was brought in alongside Incapacity Benefit in 1995, critics said that officials still accepted too many claims using information supplied by the claimants themselves and their GPs without asking for an All Work Test to be performed, partly because the pool of medical assessors was relatively small and partly because doctors' time was costly - which was why large numbers of nurses were brought in to perform the new test introduced in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4632810.stm|date=23 January 2006|publisher=BBC News|title=Doctors facing benefits dilemma}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Claimants were "trapped" on benefits ===
Welfare reformers said that once claimants had been granted Incapacity Benefit they became "[[Welfare trap|trapped]]" in the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/455533/Millions-are-trapped-in-Benefits-Street-ghettos|title=Millions are trapped in ‘Benefits Street’ ghettos|author=Macer Hall|date=23 January 2014|newspaper=Daily Express|accessdate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, there was nothing in the regulations that inherently trapped people on Incapacity Benefit: recipients were free to relinquish their payments and seek work if they felt able to, although the meagre gains from moving into a poorly paid and insecure job were thought to act as a deterrent to doing so - a phenomenon that [[Tax credits|Working Tax Credits]] and [[Universal Credit]] were designed to mitigate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jrf.org.uk/blog/does-universal-credit-make-work-pay|title=Does Universal Credit make work pay?|author=Donald Hirsch|date=11 July 2013|publisher=Joseph Rowntree Foundation|accessdate=15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The cost was unaffordable===
In 2011, out-of-work sickness benefits had an annual cost of £13{{nbsp}}billion: the Chancellor, George Osborne, called this "a very large budget".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Andrew Porter|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/7858141/Millions-face-incapacity-benefit-cuts-as-welfare-reforms-speed-up.html|title=Millions face incapacity benefit cuts as welfare reforms speed up|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=10 September 2011|accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total annual budget of the [[Department for Work and Pensions]] in 2011 was £180 billion, with the largest slice by far - almost half - being spent on the State Pension, followed by Housing Benefit at slightly under £30 billion. Tax Credits, administered by the Treasury, cost roughly the same as Housing Benefit.

If out-of-work sickness benefits costs were combined with those of the other disability benefits - the bulk of which go to the elderly - the total would be around £33 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/214340/dwp-annual-report-and-accounts-2011-2012.pdf|title=Department for Work and Pensions Annual Report &amp; Accounts 2011-12|publisher=The Stationery Office|format=pdf|date=2012|accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== People who could work were putting in claims ===
DWP data on the outcomes of new claims - ''not'' reassessments of existing Incapacity Benefit recipients - drawn from the first two years of ESA's availability showed the following:
* Only 7% of new claimants were found at assessment to be both severely disabled and unfit for work
* Another 17% were also found to be unfit for work after their assessment, but were less disabled and so were judged likely to work ''in the future'', once they had received tailored support
* 39% were found to be able to work there and then, and so were not entitled to ESA
The remaining 37% ceased claiming for unspecified reasons in the course of the 13-week application and assessment process; some might have abandoned a weak claim as the assessment approached, others might have recovered from their illness, injury or recent surgery or found a new job - the proportions are unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kirsty Walker|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2018874/Incapacity-benefit-Just-1-14-sickness-claimants-unfit-work.html|title=The shirking classes: Just 1 in 14 incapacity claimants is unfit to work|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=27 July 2011|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the unassessed 37% are removed from the equation, the results were:
* 38% were assessed as being unfit for work at the time of their assessment
* 62% were assessed as being fit for work (before any appeal)

=== Some recipients were no longer incapacitated ===
Commentators and policy-makers suspected that a large chunk of people on Incapacity Benefit had got better but had kept this quiet and were still receiving payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/comment/expresscomment/225267/Hard-workers-should-no-longer-support-shirkers|title=Hard workers should no longer support shirkers|author=|date=26 January 2011|newspaper=Daily Express|accessdate=15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another, more charitable, view was that recent disability legislation and changes in the workplace might have removed some of the barriers to disabled people returning to work.

In two pilot studies of the [[Work Capability Assessment]] as a tool for judging the fitness for work of long-term Incapacity Benefit recipients – when 1,347 disabled people living in [[Aberdeen]] and [[Burnley]], who had been on their benefit for at least two years, were assessed in late 2010 – provisional results suggested that:
* 30% of existing Incapacity Benefit recipients were actually able to work, according to the new test's more stringent criteria
* 39% were unfit for work but, with extra help, were likely to return to the world of work at some point in the future
* 31% were both unfit for work and unlikely to benefit from rehabilitation or training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Neil O'Brien|url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/neilobrien1/100082434/why-its-time-to-end-incapacity-benefit/|title=Why it's time to end Incapacity Benefit|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=4 April 2011|accessdate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/initial-reassessments-of-those-on-ib-in-aberdeen-and-burnley-show-large-numbers-of-claimants-with-the-potential-to-return-to-work|title=Initial reassessments of those on IB in Aberdeen and Burnley show large numbers of claimants with the potential to return to work|publisher=Department for Work and Pensions|date=10 February 2011|accessdate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reliability of this provisional data has been challenged, since many of those categorised as 'fit for work' subsequently won their appeals against the initial decision, suggesting that the results of the pilot studies overstated the percentage of claimants who were capable of finding a job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ilegal.org.uk/thread/7258/serious-flaws-governments-statistics?page=11&amp;scrollTo=21055|title=More 'sick' propaganda via BBC – Hereby corrected....|date=25 January 2014|author=nickd|website=www.ilegal.org.uk|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the passage of time, experience showed that the vast majority of Incapacity Benefit recipients also met the more stringent criteria for ESA as well, and the combined total of people on these benefits hardly changed between 2008 and 2015. Furthermore, the generic rehabilitation programme for those on ESA who were considered to be able to work in the future – the [[Work Programme]] – proved largely ineffective in returning them to work.

==Incapacity Benefit Reassessment==
In February 2005, the BBC analysed New Labour's record on welfare reform:
{{quote| Thinking the unthinkable on the welfare state has been one of the New Labour mantras since before the party was elected in 1997. So it has been a disappointment to many [...] on the Labour benches that, eight years later, the thinking has still to produce any concrete results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2 February 2005|title=Blair thinks the unthinkable?|publisher=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4228645.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The following year [[Tony Blair]] appointed [[David Freud]], a former vice-chairman of investment banking at [[UBS]], as an advisor on out-of-work benefit reform. Freud's 2007 report called for the greater use of private sector companies who would be paid by results, and for substantial resources to be made available to help people on Incapacity Benefit back into work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Freud Report|url=https://www2.learningandwork.org.uk/sites/default/files/policy_downloads/freud_review.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 a Green Paper was published, which [[James Purnell]] said was "inspired by the reforms proposed by David Freud". It declared that "between 2009 and 2013, all Incapacity Benefit claimants will be reassessed using a medical assessment called the Work Capability Assessment (WCA)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| date=July 2008|title=No one written off: reforming welfare to reward responsibility|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/238741/7363.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Raising expectations and increasing support: reforming welfare for the future|publisher=DWP|date= December 2008|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/238683/7506.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a decision later that year to overhaul the test's criteria delayed the start of the reassessment programme.

In the autumn of 2010, with Freud now a government minister responsible for welfare reform, two [[pilot studies]] took place. 1347 people who had been on Incapacity Benefit for more than two years were assessed against the new criteria that would be used to gauge the fitness for work of more than two million such people from the spring of the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/initial-reassessments-of-those-on-ib-in-aberdeen-and-burnley-show-large-numbers-of-claimants-with-the-potential-to-return-to-work|title=Initial reassessments of those on IB in Aberdeen and Burnley show large numbers of claimants with the potential to return to work|publisher=Department for Work and Pensions|date=10 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experts raise concerns===
In 2010, the new Conservative Secretary of State for Work and Pensions asked Professor Malcolm Harrington, an occupational medicine specialist, to review the operation of the WCA. ''The Guardian'' summarised Professor Harrington's opinion as being that the test was "impersonal", it "lacked empathy" and it was too reliant on "computer systems and drop-down menus".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/nov/23/incapacity-benefit-test-review |title=Incapacity benefit tests face overhaul after damning report |first=Randeep |last=Ramesh |work=The Guardian |date=23 November 2010|accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the executive summary of his report, he wrote that the "WCA is not working as well as it should. There are clear and consistent criticisms of the whole system and much negativity surrounding the process...[but] I do not believe the system is broken or beyond repair. I am proposing a substantial series of recommendations to improve the fairness and effectiveness of the WCA. If adopted, I believe these changes can have a positive impact on the process."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harrington Review 2010|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/70071/wca-review-2010.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Government response to 2010 Harrington Review|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/70077/wca-review-2010-response.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before the Incapacity Benefit reassessment programme began, Professor [[Paul Gregg (academic)|Paul Gregg]], an economist and one of the original architects of ESA, warned that the WCA was "badly malfunctioning" and urged further pilot studies before the new version was used to retest existing sickness benefit recipients.&lt;ref name="Guardian 22Feb2011"&gt;{{cite news|author=Amelia Gentleman |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/feb/22/new-disability-test-is-a-complete-mess |title=New Disability Test is a Complete Mess |publisher=Guardian |date= 22 February 2011|accessdate=30 January 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three months later, six experts in mental health — including the chief executive of MIND, who was already a senior advisor to the DWP on the WCA — wrote to ''The Guardian'' to say that the test was "deeply flawed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=31 May 2011|publisher=The Guardian|title=Fatal consequences of benefit changes|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/may/31/consequences-benefit-changes-mental-health}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Harrington asked MIND, Mencap and the National Autistic Society to "provide recommendations on refining the mental, intellectual and cognitive descriptors" but the DWP's own doctors were not convinced by the evidence presented.&lt;ref name="auto6"&gt;{{cite web|title=Harrington review 2011|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/70102/wca-review-2011.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The department decided to set up an 'evidence-based review' to look in more detail at the proposed changes, which concluded that the existing criteria "produced consistent results on the whole" and that the WCA was already "an accurate indicator of work capability as compared with expert opinion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=December 2013|publisher=gov.uk|title=Evidence-based review of the WCA|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/331582/wca-evidence-based-review.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; DWP ministers replaced Professor Harrington once he had submitted his third annual report in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harrington review 2012|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/70123/wca-review-2012.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19046447 | work=BBC News | title=Reviewer of fitness-to-work benefit tests to stand down | date=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As his successor they appointed [[Paul Litchfield]], a doctor who had played a key part in designing the WCA's mental and cognitive function descriptors in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/hoban-committed-to-further-improvements-to-the-work-capability-assessment |title=Hoban – committed to further improvements to the Work Capability Assessment – Press releases |publisher=GOV.UK |date=2013-02-26 |accessdate=2015-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, ''The Guardian'' quoted Professor Harrington as saying: "I would have preferred to do a roll-out [the IB reassessment] in the second year [2012]" and as having told the DWP this before the Incapacity Benefit reassessment programme began. The DWP told the newspaper it had no record of a warning of this kind being given by Professor Harrington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The Guardian|author=Patrick Butler|date=16 December 2013|title=Ministers 'ignored advice on inhumane fit-for-work tests'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/dec/16/ministers-ignored-advice-fit-for-work-tests}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the minister who had formally initiated the 'roll out' had said in Parliament that beforehand Professor Harrington had told him: "I believe the system is in sufficient shape for you to proceed with Incapacity Benefit reassessment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Hansard|date=1 February 2012|title=work capability assessments|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201212/cmhansrd/cm120201/halltext/120201h0001.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked later about this discrepancy, Professor Harrington replied:
{{quote|Can I clarify this once and for all? In my first year — before the first report, that is — I said to [the minister] that, left to my own devices, I would prefer it if they would postpone the IB migration until I had got at least one review in, so they could just deal with the new claimants and would not be confused by another group of people coming in — a completely different group of people, as you well know. He did not say no; it was just obvious that it was a political done deal and they were going to go ahead and do the IB migration whatever.&lt;ref name="data.parliament.uk"&gt;{{cite web|title=Professor Harrington: evidence to work and pensions committee|date=14 May 2014|url= http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/work-and-pensions-committee/employment-and-support-allowance-and-work-capability-assessments/oral/9582.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Atos leaves prematurely===
In June 2013, all established [[Atos]] WCA assessors were unexpectedly retrained as part of a "quality improvement plan" revealed by the DWP the following month, which resulted in longer assessments for the same fee and a shortage of assessors willing and able to carry them out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/hoban-taking-action-to-improve-the-work-capability-assessment|title=Hoban – taking action to improve the Work Capability Assessment|work=www.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; By July, Atos had decided not to bid for a contract to carry out the test on the [[Isle of Man]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=23 May 2013|publisher=Isle of Man Today|title=Atos doctor claims 'fitness for work' tests were unfair|url=http://www.iomtoday.co.im/news/isle-of-man-news/atos-doctor-claims-fitness-to-work-tests-were-unfair-1-5694343}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=29 July 2013|publisher=Manx Radio|title=Atos didn't tender for contract|url=http://www.manxradio.com/news/isle-of-man-news/atos-didnand39t-tender-for-contract/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, the Minister for Disabled People told a parliamentary committee that top level talks had been taking place with Atos:
{{quote|I can't go into too much detail [but] there are global contract negotiations going on with Atos to do with their contract...Certainly, the conversations I've had at board level with Atos, we've taken it to a level where they had to realise just how bad this was for their reputation in the UK — with other contracts and with other ''departments'' as well&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Work and pensions select committee|publisher=Parliamentlive.tv|date=11 December 2013|url=http://www.parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/21fdbe11-127f-4087-b34c-a9affc1feed9}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In February 2014, ''The Guardian'' was sent a document that purported to outline the future of the DWP's relationship with Atos. The newspaper described the document in terms that suggested that ministers were preparing to "oust" Atos from the WCA contract. In response to this apparent leaking of confidential information to the press, Atos told the newspaper that the contract wasn't working for ''either'' party and it defended its employees in the face of the pressure they were under, saying the "constant flow of criticism" endured by the company "inevitably has an impact on our staff, who diligently endeavour to carry out assessments as laid out in DWP guidelines".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The Guardian|date=17 February 2014|title=Atos may lose fit-for-work tests contract as ministers line up rival firms|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/feb/17/atos-fit-for-work-tests-contract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few days later, as disabled people staged protests outside Atos assessment centres nationwide, the French contractor told ''The Financial Times'' that it had been trying to get out of the WCA contract since 2013. The firm said: "For several months now, we have been endeavouring to agree an early exit from the work capability assessment contract" and said that one reason it wanted to quit was that the WCA was "not working".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5abc8d36-9a28-11e3-8232-00144feab7de.html#axzz3AqVFhyaB|title=Outsource group seeks exit from UK £500m benefits contract after death threats|work=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC said its Whitehall sources were "furious" that the company had unilaterally announced its intention to end the contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Atos seeks early exit from fit-to-work tests contract|date=21 February 2014|publisher=BBC|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-26287199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following month, the Disabilities Minister confirmed in Parliament that the contract with Atos was in the process of being brought to a premature close, with Atos paying a "substantial financial settlement" to the DWP as part of a mutual agreement to terminate the WCA contract early (although it would be another year before a new company — Maximus — began to carry out WCAs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140327/wmstext/140327m0002.htm|title=House of Commons Hansard Ministerial Statements for 27 Mar 2014  (pt 0002)|work=parliament.uk|accessdate=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DWP continued to employ the French firm to assess most claims for the [[Personal Independence Payment]] and Atos IT staff continued to run the computer system used in the WCA, even after Maximus had taken over the rest of the testing process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atoshealthcare.com/pip|title=Personal Independence Payment (PIP) Assessment|work=atoshealthcare.com|accessdate=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2014, the DWP called a halt to reassessments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The Independent|date=25 February 2014|title=Atos quietly dropped from carrying out repeat assessments by DWP, internal memo shows|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/atos-quietly-dropped-from-carrying-out-repeat-reassessments-by-dwp-internal-memo-shows-9151893.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer, the BBC reported a backlog of more than half a million ''new'' ESA claims. Both were the result of a [[Bottleneck (production)|bottleneck]] caused by longer assessments and the departure (while Atos still held the WCA contract) of hundreds of medical assessors — unintended consequences of the "quality improvement programme" announced by the DWP the previous summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-27796739 |title=Hundreds of thousands hit by benefits backlog |work=BBC News |date=11 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maximus struggles to retain assessors===
Maximus Inc. took over a revised version of the WCA contract on 1 March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-29815425 |title=US firm Maximus 'awarded contract to assess fitness-to-work' |work=BBC News |date=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.maximusuk.co.uk/health-programmes/independent-health-assessments |title=Health Programmes: Independent Health Assessments|publisher=[[Maximus Inc.]]|accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DWP hoped that a new contract and a new outsourcing partner would mean the start of a new chapter for the reassessment process. However, executives from Atos complained that their firm had been lambasted for doing nothing other than "applying the legislation the government had laid out", adding that it was "massively over-simplistic" to think that choosing a different outsourcer would, in itself, deal with the flaws in the DWP-designed process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/replacing-atos-with-another-private-provider-will-not-solve-flaws-in-disability-benefits-system-mps-warn-9621942.html|title=Replacing Atos with another private provider will not solve flaws in the WCA|author=Andrew Grice|date=22 July 2014|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27767779|title=Atos was 'lightning rod' for anger over benefit changes|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maximus said it would improve evidence-gathering prior to a face-to-face assessment, introduce specialist assessors for particular types of disability and communicate more effectively with claimants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/maximus-appointed-to-carry-out-health-assessments-for-the-department-for-work-and-pensions|title=MAXIMUS appointed to carry out health assessments for the Department for Work and Pensions|work=www.gov.uk|accessdate=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jan/18/after-hated-atos-quits-will-maximus-make-work-assessments-less-arduous|title=After hated Atos quits, will Maximus make work assessments less arduous?|author=Amelia Gentleman|work=the Guardian|accessdate=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm acknowledged that hundreds more healthcare professionals would have to be recruited again in order to clear the backlog of ESA claims and hit the contract's new target of one million assessments a year.&lt;ref name="auto11"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-31590017 | work=BBC News | title=Work capability assessments: One million disability checks planned | date=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of October 2015, the DWP's director-general of finance was bullish about hitting this higher target when he appeared before a parliamentary committee, saying: "We are confident that [Maximus] will over-achieve the amounts of work over and above the forecast that was set".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/6425a881-cdea-4c6c-b71c-9fa53dd10bdd|title=Work and Pensions Committee|date=28 October 2015|website=parliamentlive.tv|accessdate=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; But at the start of November, Maximus's senior management team warned&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/3680366-maximus-mms-ceo-rich-montoni-on-q4-2015-results-earnings-call-transcript?page=1|title=MAXIMUS' (MMS) CEO Rich Montoni on Q4 2015 Results – Earnings Call Transcript|author=SA Transcripts|date=12 November 2015|work=Seeking Alpha|accessdate=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
its shareholders that volume targets were not being met. The company stated that although recruitment of healthcare professionals had improved, their training and retention was still a problem, with a shortfall of assessors expected to last until the autumn of 2016. On the same day, the price of shares in the company fell sharply, losing more than 20% of their value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/11/12/why-maximus-inc-fell-22-on-thursday.aspx|title=Why Maximus Inc. Fell 22% on Thursday|author=Daniel Sparks|date=12 November 2015|work=The Motley Fool|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, the [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]] (NAO) published its evaluation of the DWP's health and disability assessment contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=National Audit Office|title=DWP Contracted-Out Health and Disability Assessments|url=https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Contracted-out-health-and-disability-assessments-Summary.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It said the cost of each WCA had risen from £115 under Atos to £190 under Maximus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/08/maximus-miss-fitness-to-work-test-targets-despite-spiralling-costs|title=Maximus miss fitness-to-work test targets despite spiralling costs|author=Rajeev Syal|date=8 January 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report went on to say that Maximus was facing "significant challenges with staff failing to complete training requirements" and revealed that in July 2015 — less than six months into the new contract — the DWP had been obliged to draw up a 'performance improvement plan' with Maximus because "volume targets were not being met". The NAO also declared that the DWP had "allowed bidders to make assumptions about staff training that it knew were overly optimistic and difficult to achieve" and implied that the target set by the DWP of one million assessments a year was too ambitious, saying: "One experienced bidder withdrew from the process because it could not meet the required number of assessments".

In April 2016, sources close to the new Welfare Secretary, [[Stephen Crabb]], told ''The Sunday Times'' that a contract with Maximus was "under scrutiny", which the newspaper implied was the WCA contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=3 April 2016|publisher=The Sunday Times|title=New welfare secretary to sack disability assessment firms|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/article1684378.ece}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early May, Maximus senior executives admitted that the target of one million WCAs a year had been "very, very challenging" then revealed that government planners had lowered their expectations after a spending review. The executives said:
{{quote|The contract was modified to put a greater emphasis on carrying out face-to-face assessments at a reduced level. This will achieve DWP's service goals, while at the same time delivering greater value for money overall.
There has also been speculation within the investment community that the contract was under review for cancellation or significant changes. I want to dispel that myth today...We've had personal reassurances from DWP that the Secretary of State has not expressed concern over the continuity of the contract. Further, there's no current plan on making substantial changes or terminating the contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=5 May 2016|publisher=SA Transcripts|title=Maximus CEO on Q2 2016 results|url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/3971854-maximus-mms-ceo-rich-montoni-q2-2016-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At the beginning of October 2016, the recently appointed Work and Pensions Secretary, [[Damian Green]], said it was "pointless" to reassess claimants if it was clear that their clinical condition had no realistic prospect of improvement or would only get worse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=BBC News|date=1 October 2016|title=Damian Green on ESA|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37528568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of October 2016, the government published a [[Green Paper]] asking for ideas on how to reform ESA and its eligibility test in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Daily Telegraph|date=30 October 2016|title=Theresa May dismantles Iain Duncan Smith's legacy on benefits|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/29/theresa-may-dismantles-iain-duncan-smiths-legacy-on-benefits/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37810701 Work capability assessment overhaul for disabled] ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reforms fail to make savings===
The Incapacity Benefit reassessment programme had originally been expected to save seven billion pounds a year from the welfare budget.&lt;ref name="Hutton unveils benefits shake-up"/&gt;

In 2015 the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) found that no savings had been made to date: the sickness benefit budget remained at more than £13billion a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/welfare-trends-report-october-2014/|title=Office for Budget Responsibility|work=Office for Budget Responsibility|accessdate=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, because many more claimants than forecast were being placed in the Support Group, the government's fiscal watchdog ''raised'' its estimate for spending on sickness benefits by one billion pounds a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://cdn.budgetresponsibility.independent.gov.uk/Executive_summary_Welfare_trends_2015.pdf|format=pdf|publisher=Office for Budget Responsibility|website=budgetresponsibility.org.uk|title=Welfare trends report (Executive summary)|date=2015|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 the OBR said that the reforms had still made no impact on the level of welfare spending — although a simple freezing of benefit payments, so that they did not rise with inflation, had made some savings for the Treasury.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

Professor [[Jonathan Portes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04mc1hv |title=BBC Radio 4 – Analysis, Inside Welfare Reform |publisher=bbc.co.uk |date=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; formerly the chief economist at the DWP and later the director of the [[National Institute of Economic and Social Research]], has described the Incapacity Benefit reassessment programme as "the biggest single social policy failure of the last fifteen years".&lt;ref name="niesr.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niesr.ac.uk/blog/welfare-savings-and-incapacity-benefits#.VVxfDqZH3x4|title=Welfare savings and incapacity benefits|work=niesr.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In law, '''individual capacity''' is a ''[[Jargon|term of art]]'' referring to one's status as a [[natural person]], distinct from any other role. For example, an officer, employee or agent of a [[corporation]], acting "in their individual capacity" is acting as himself, rather than as an agent of the corporation. Thus, their actions, in their capacity as an individual would not generally incur a liability on the part of the corporation (this concept is also known as a [[corporate liability]]), nor would they have any protection from liability for their own actions as an individual.

In general, a person may be said by a second party to be acting in their capacity as an individual, whenever the person's actions are the result of their own decisions, rather than being actions to which they are obligated in their capacity as an agent of another person or agency.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="812">'''Interlineation''' is a [[legal]] term that signifies writing has been inserted between earlier language. &lt;ref&gt;''Black's Law Dictionary'' interlineation (9th ed. 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly used to indicate the insertion of new language between previous sentences in a [[contract]], though it may also be used in other contexts. &lt;ref&gt;71 C.J.S. Pleading § 437 ("Mode of making amendment—By interlineation"); 3B C.J.S. Alteration of Instruments § 87.&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, interlineations can help to clarify specific points of a legal contract, and are useful if some of the terms of a contract become unclear later. They are typically initialed and dated, so as to make a record of changes and agreements to a particular contract.

'''James Braidwood''' (1800–1861) was a Scottish [[firefighter]] who founded of the world's first municipal fire service in [[Edinburgh]] in 1824. He was the first director of the ''London Fire Engine Establishment'' (the [[fire brigade|brigade]] which was eventually to become the [[London Fire Brigade]]).&lt;ref name="LFB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/ |title=London Fire Brigade website |publisher=London Fire Brigade |date=30 April 2008 |accessdate=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is credited with the development of the modern municipal fire service.&lt;ref name="GlosFire"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041128234033/http://www.glosfire.gov.uk/sections/schools/school_rc_modern.html The foundations of the modern fire service, Gloucestershire Fire and Rescue Service]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
He was born in [[Edinburgh]] the tenth child of Janet Mitchell and Francis James Braidwood, a cabinetmaker. He was educated at the [[Royal High School (Edinburgh)|Royal High School]]. He learned about the construction of buildings after joining his father's building firm as an apprentice, knowledge he was later to put to good use.
[[File:Edinburgh fire engine, 1824.JPG|thumb|220px|left|One of Edinburgh's first [[Fire apparatus|fire engines]] from 1824]]
Appointed Master of Fire Engines at the age of 24, two months prior to the [[Great Fire of Edinburgh (1824)|Great Fire of Edinburgh]], Braidwood established principles of fire-fighting that are still applied today. His training as a surveyor gave him exceptional knowledge of the behaviour of building materials and housing conditions in the Old Town of Edinburgh. He recruited to the service expert tradesmen – slaters, carpenters, masons and plumbers – who could apply their various fields of expertise to [[fire fighting]]. He also recruited experienced mariners for an occupation that required heavy manual work in hauling engines and trundling wheeled escape ladders up and down Edinburgh's steep streets, as well as nimble footwork when negotiating rooftops and moving through partially destroyed buildings. His many original ideas of practical organisation and methodology, published in 1830, were adopted throughout Britain. He was, however, resistant to the introduction of steam-driven engines. In 1833 he left Edinburgh to lead the London Fire Engine Establishment. The London Fire Engine Establishment had to fight a blaze at the [[Burning of Parliament|Palace of Westminster]], on 16 October 1834, that destroyed almost all of the Palace. 

Braidwood was distinguished for his heroism on the occasion of great fires in Edinburgh (1824) and London (1830). He also undertook a pastoral role, introducing visits to ordinary firemen and their families by the [[London City Mission]].

As a strange curiosity, Braidwood was the first witness at the trial of William Burke of [[Burke and Hare]] fame. He gave evidence on Christmas Eve of 1828, in his capacity as an Edinburgh builder, who had been commissioned by the authorities to draw scale plans of the notorious lodging house on Tanners Close where the murders took place. His evidence was simply to state that the plans were an accurate representation of the building.&lt;ref&gt;''The Infamous Burke and Hare: Serial Killers and Resurrectionists of 19th Century Edinburgh'', by R. Michael Gordon p. 103 {{ISBN|978-0-7864-4403-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death at Tooley Street Fire==
[[File:The Tooley Street fire of 1861.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|The [[Tooley Street]] fire of 1861 on its first day]]
[[File:The Tooley Street fire by the end of the second day.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|The Tooley Street fire by the end of the second day]]

On 22 June 1861 he died in the [[1861 Tooley Street fire|Tooley Street fire]] at [[Cotton's Wharf]] near [[London Bridge station]] when a falling wall crushed him, three hours after the fire began.&lt;ref name="tooley street fire"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/TheTooleyStreetFire.asp |title=Tooley Street Fire |publisher=London Fire Brigade |accessdate=18 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117182240/http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/TheTooleyStreetFire.asp |archivedate=17 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It took two days to recover his body and his heroism led to a massive funeral on 29 June where his funeral cortege stretched one and a half miles behind the hearse, a public spectacle equal almost to the Tooley Street fire itself.&lt;ref name="GEO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/people/famousfirst925.html |title=Edinburgh University profile of James Braidwood |publisher=Scottish-places.info |accessdate=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fire, which continued to burn for a fortnight, caused £2,000,000 worth of damage. A London [[fireboat]] was named in his honour in the 1930s.

Braidwood is buried at [[Abney Park Cemetery]], [[Stoke Newington]], London, not far from the Stoke Newington Fire Station. The grave lies on a path edge towards the south, rendering it relatively easy to see in this congested and overgrown cemetery. His wife, Mary Ann Jane Braidwood (1806–1871) was buried with him.

The grave was long lost to public view and in 1981, following much research by the then Stoke Newington Fire Station White Watch Station Officer, Liam Hackett, the precise location of the grave was found. Hackett then spent the rest of the Summer clearing the site and restoring the lettering on the monument.&lt;ref&gt;Wood Paul.

==National memorial==
[[File:The grave of James Braidwood, Abney Park Cemetery, London.jpg|thumb|Headstone of James Braidwood at Abney Park Cemetery in 2015]]
The death of James Braidwood, whilst engaged in fire fighting duties, is recorded on the [[National Firefighters Memorial]] which is located adjacent to [[St Paul's Cathedral]] in the City of London.

==Remembered, 2004==
A group of former London Firefighters decided to form a new Masonic Lodge. They chose to remember the life and death of this famous fireman by naming the Lodge after him. Consecrated in 2005 this is now known as the Braidwood Lodge Number 9802 in the Province of West Kent.

Recognising the lack of publications on fire engines in the English language, Braidwood published what is regarded as one of the first text books on the science of [[Fire protection engineering|fire engineering]] in 1830: ''On the Construction of Fire Engines and Apparatus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FxYbmpY3cJsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=On the Construction of Fire Engines and Apparatus by James Braidwood, 2nd edition, 2004. Preface by Brian Allaway |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although many historical (Public domain) books often are re-published, Braidwood's book was officially re-published as a second edition in 2004. Braidwood also authored ''Fire prevention and fire extinction'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AI8BAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Fire prevention and fire extinction |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; published posthumously in 1866.

==New memorial, 2008==
On 5 September 2008, the James Braidwood memorial statue in [[Parliament Square, Edinburgh]] was unveiled by Professor [[Timothy O'Shea|Sir Timothy O'Shea]], Principal of the [[University of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref name="father of firefighting"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.scotsman.com/scotland/No-bells-and-no-whistles.4328264.jp |title='No bells and no whistles for 'father of firefighting' |newspaper=The Scotsman |date=26 July 2008 |accessdate=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fund had been established for a £75,000 memorial to Braidwood, to be created by the Glasgow sculptor, Kenneth Mackay, led by Dr Frank Rushbrook CBE, 93-year-old former Firemaster at [[Lothian &amp; Borders Fire Brigade]]. The statue stands around the corner from the site of the original main fire station in the High Street. The bronze plaque below it reads:

{{cquote|''James Braidwood&lt;br /&gt;
''1800 – 1861&lt;br /&gt;
''Father of the British Fire Service &lt;br /&gt;
''This statue is dedicated to the memory of James Braidwood, a pioneer of the scientific approach to fire-fighting. It also recognises the courage and sacrifice of fire-fighters, not only in Lothian &amp; Borders Fire and Rescue Service, but all over the world.}}

Dr Rushbrook was also the benefactor of the Fire Laboratory that lies at the heart of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20130329001154/http://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/fire/ BRE Centre for Fire Safety Engineering], in the  School of Engineering at the University of Edinburgh. His gift was motivated by a desire to promote education in applied fire science, and is routinely used for experimental classes on the undergraduate and taught postgraduate fire programmes at the University, together with PhD/post-doctoral research and also on occasion by fire service personnel. The laboratory was officially opened in 2003, and has since been expanded to two floors.

The '''Jedi''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|ɛ|d|aɪ}} are the main protagonists in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' universe. They are depicted as an ancient [[monastic]], academic, [[meritocratic]] and [[paramilitary]] organization whose origin dates back approximately 25,000 years before the events of the [[Star Wars (film)|first film]] released in the franchise.

The '''Jedi Order''' mostly consists of [[polymath]]s: teachers, philosophers, scientists, engineers, physicians, diplomats and warriors.  The Jedi value knowledge and wisdom, adhere to [[slave morality]], and serve others through acts of [[Charity (practice)|charity]], [[citizenship]], and [[volunteerism]]; this ideology is a recurring theme in the ''Star Wars'' universe. The Jedi denounce emotions as the root of mortal suffering; they believe fear, anger and love cause sentient beings to lash out in conflict and impede rational action to do what is right. Their traditional weapon is the [[lightsaber]], a device which generates a blade-like [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] powered by a [[kyber crystal]]. The fictional organization has inspired a real-world [[new religious movement]], [[Jediism]].&lt;ref name=nrm&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LgvvaMgTsZ0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=jediism&amp;f=false|title=Historical Dictionary of New Religious Movements|first=George D. |last=Chryssides|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|year=2011| isbn= 978-0-810-87967-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences and parallels==
===Origin of the word ''Jedi''===
The word ''Jedi'' is said to have been adapted by [[George Lucas]] from Japanese 時代劇 ([[jidaigeki]]) (meaning "period drama" motion pictures about [[samurai]]),&lt;ref name="docu"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Star Wars: The Legacy Revealed |network= [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] |airdate=2007-05-28 |minutes=about 90}}&lt;/ref&gt; or perhaps inspired by the words ''Jed'' (King) and ''Jeddak'' (Emperor) in the [[w:Barsoom|Barsoom]] series by [[w:Edgar Rice Burroughs|Edgar Rice Burroughs]], a series that Lucas considered adapting to film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/26/movies/the-names-came-from-earth.html|title=The Names Came From Earth|date=1997-01-26 |accessdate=2010-01-22|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scifinow.co.uk/cinema/john-carter-versus-star-wars/|title=john carter versus starwars|work=SciFiNow}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The film ''[[Rogue One]]'' suggests that it relates to the planet [[Jedha]], source of the [[kyber crystal]]s used in [[lightsaber]]s.

The term ''padawan'', which is used to refer to the fictional Jedi apprentices, appears to originate in [[Sanskrit]] and can be understood as "learner", both in Sanskrit and by contemporary native speakers of [[Indo-Aryan languages|Sanskrit-based languages]].&lt;ref name="Klaus Glashoff"&gt;{{cite web|author=Klaus Glashoff |url=http://spokensanskrit.org/index.php?tran_input=pAThavat&amp;direct=se&amp;script=hk&amp;link=yes&amp;mode=3 |title=Sanskrit Dictionary for Spoken Sanskrit |publisher=Spokensanskrit.de |date= |accessdate=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Klaus Glashoff 4"&gt;{{cite web|author=Klaus Glashoff |url=http://spokensanskrit.org/index.php?tran_input=pATava&amp;direct=se&amp;script=hk&amp;link=yes&amp;mode=3 |title=Sanskrit Dictionary for Spoken Sanskrit |publisher=Spokensanskrit.de |date= |accessdate=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A.

===Influences from real world culture and mythology===
[[George Lucas]] acknowledged Jedi, [[Sith]], and other [[the Force|Force]] concepts have been inspired by many sources. These include: [[knighthood]] [[chivalry]], [[paladin]]ism, [[samurai]] [[bushido]], [[Shaolin Monastery]], [[Feudalism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Qigong]], [[Greek philosophy]], [[Greek mythology]], [[History of Rome|Roman history]], [[Roman mythology]], parts of the [[Abrahamic religions]], [[Confucianism]], [[Shintō]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Taoism]], not to mention countless cinematic precursors.  The works of philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]], especially his book ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'' (1949), directly influenced Lucas, and was what drove him to create the 'modern myth' of ''Star Wars''.&lt;ref name="swmyth"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.films.com/id/11017/The_Mythology_of_Star_Wars_with_George_Lucas_and_Bill_Moyers.htm | title=The Mythology of Star Wars with George Lucas and Bill Moyers | publisher=Films Media Group | work=films.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasm.si.edu/exhibitions/StarWars/sw-unit1.htm |title=Star Wars @ NASM, Unit 1, Introduction Page |publisher=Nasm.si.edu |date=1999-01-31 |accessdate=2010-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100408195115/http://nasm.si.edu/exhibitions/StarWars/sw-unit1.htm |archivedate= 8 April 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
As depicted in the [[canon (fiction)|canon]], the Jedi study and utilize [[the Force]], in order to help and protect those in need. The Jedi members, known as Jedi Knights, respect all life by defending and protecting those who cannot do it for themselves, striving for peaceful and non-combative solutions to any altercations they encounter and fighting only in self-defense and for the defense of those they protect. Like their evil counterparts, the [[Sith]], their main weapon is the lightsaber. By training the mind and the body, the Jedi seek to improve themselves by gaining unfettered access to the Force while also seeking to improve those individuals and groups they come in contact with.

===Fictional backstory===


====The Lost Twenty====
The Lost Twenty was the name given to a group of Jedi Masters—numbering twenty in total—who left the Jedi Order throughout its history.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihwejpqmVAM Star Wars - Attack of the Clones - Deleted Scenes&lt;/ref&gt; The first twelve of these ‘Lost Twenty’ left the Jedi Order before the Third Great Schism; these twelve Masters later became "Dark Jedi" who eventually founded the first [[Sith Empire]]. In the [[Year|standard years]] preceding the [[Clone Wars (Star Wars)|Clone Wars]], Jedi Master [[Dooku]] left the Jedi Order as a result of differences with his fellow Jedi, becoming the twentieth Jedi Master in the history of the Order to do so. To commemorate these former Jedi, memorial statue busts were displayed at the Jedi Temple on [[Coruscant]].

====Twilight of the Old Republic====
{{further|Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace}}
The [[Star Wars prequel trilogy|prequel films]] depict the Jedi in their prime, dealing with the rising presence of the dark side of the Force and determined to fight their mortal enemies, the Sith. In ''Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace'' (1999), Jedi Master [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] ([[Liam Neeson]]) discovers nine-year-old Anakin Skywalker ([[Jake Lloyd]]), whom he believes to be the "Chosen One" of a Jedi prophecy who is destined to bring balance to the Force; the boy is eventually paired with Qui-Gon's apprentice, the young Obi-Wan Kenobi ([[Ewan McGregor]]), who promises to train him. The sequel, ''Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones'', establishes that the Jedi forswear all emotional attachments, including romantic love, which proves problematic when Anakin, now a young adult ([[Hayden Christensen]]), falls in love with [[Padmé Amidala]] ([[Natalie Portman]]), whom Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi had served ten years before. In ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith|Revenge of the Sith]]'', [[Palpatine]] ([[Ian McDiarmid]]), who is later revealed to be [[Darth Sidious]], the Dark Lord of the Sith, manipulates Anakin's love for Padmé and distrust of the Jedi in order to turn him to the dark side and become his Sith apprentice, Darth Vader. Once corrupted, Vader helps Palpatine hunt down and destroy nearly all of the Jedi, leaving very few left, such as Jedi Masters Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Anakin’s former Padawan, [[Ahsoka Tano]].

====Order 66====
{{further|Clone Wars (Star Wars)}}
In accordance with Order 66, for crimes of "sedition and high-treason" against the Galactic Republic, the Jedi are nearly exterminated by the Clone Army and [[Sith Lord]] Darth Sidious; only Obi-Wan Kenobi and [[Yoda]], who were amongst a handful of a hundred survivors, avoided the initial purge.&lt;ref name=Stafford&gt;{{cite book|last=Stafford|first=Nikki|title=Finding Lost|year=2009|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=1554905591|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_tn2MUyKUmcC&amp;pg=PT178&amp;dq=%22Great+Jedi+Purge%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Great%20Jedi%20Purge%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first person to be issued this order was [[Clone trooper#Commander Cody|Clone Commander Cody]] (who until then was under the command of Jedi General Kenobi). Darth Vader led '''''Operation: Knightfall''''' against the Jedi Temple with the [[501st Legion]] while the rest of the clone army around the galaxy carried out Order 66. Palpatine convinced the people of the Republic that Jedi were corrupted warmongers responsible for prolonging the Clone Wars; the Jedi became universally hated with huge bounties placed on them. Darth Vader continued to hunt and execute nearly every surviving Jedi during the first 10 years of the Empire's history;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcJimSrZthU |title=What Happened To Jedi that Survived Order 66 - Star Wars Explained |publisher=YouTube |date=2016-07-22 |accessdate=2016-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; only [[Yoda]] survived long enough to die of old age.

====Rebellion Against the Galactic Empire====
{{further|Galactic Civil War}}
The Jedi are first introduced in the 1977 motion picture ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' as an order of warrior monks who serve as "the guardians of peace and justice in [[Star Wars galaxy|the galaxy]]" and embrace the mystical Force. Obi-Wan Kenobi ([[Alec Guinness]])
explains that the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] had all but exterminated the Jedi some twenty years before the events of the film, and seeks to train [[Luke Skywalker]]  ([[Mark Hamill]]) to be the Jedi Order's last hope. [[Darth Vader]] ([[David Prowse]]/[[James Earl Jones]]) is also established as the Jedi's main enemy. By the end of the film, Luke is on the path to becoming a Jedi. In the sequel, ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', Luke receives extensive Jedi training from the elderly (and only surviving) Jedi Master Yoda ([[Frank Oz]]), even as he learns that Vader is, in fact, his father, former Jedi Knight [[Anakin Skywalker]]. The third film in the [[Star Wars original trilogy|original trilogy]], ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'', ends with Luke redeeming Vader and helping to destroy the Empire, thus fulfilling his destiny as a Jedi.

====Fall of the New Jedi Order====
{{further|Star Wars: The Force Awakens}}
In the ''sequel''-trilogy film series however, Luke's attempts to restore the Jedi Order took a turn for the worse instead when one of his apprentices, his nephew [[Kylo Ren|Ben]], is drawn to the Dark side by [[Supreme Leader Snoke]] and becomes Kylo Ren. He is convinced to destroy all that Luke has built, murdering most of Luke's apprentices in the occasion. After Ren's fall and the destruction of the New Jedi Order, Luke goes into a self-imposed exile on Ahch-To, believing himself and the Jedi to be a negative influence on the galaxy as a whole.

In the sequel ''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi]]'', the scavenger [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]] discovers Luke on Ahch-to and convinces him to train her in the ways of the Force. During her training, Luke describes the hubris of a full-fledged Jedi order, one that allowed [[Palpatine|Darth Sidious]] [[Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith|to rise to power and eliminate nearly all of them]]. She also discovers several ancient Jedi texts hidden away in a tree. Rey learns the truth about Ben's fall to the Dark Side and believes herself to be his only chance of redemption. Luke does not go with her, staying on Ahch-To. Luke attempts to burn the tree down, but cannot bring himself to do so. However, Yoda appears as a Force Ghost to mentor Luke one more time, burning the tree and teaching him that failure is just as important as success, and that Masters are defined by those who surpassed them. When the [[First Order (Star Wars)|First Order]] launches an attack on the [[Resistance (Star Wars)|Resistance]] on Crait, Luke appears to stall the oncoming forces. He and Kylo Ren engage in a duel on the battlefield, Ren apparently striking him down. Luke reveals to Ren that he has been projecting an image of himself across the galaxy. On Ahch-To, an exhausted Luke meditates, facing the sunset. He hallucinates a binary sunset and fades away, becoming one with the Force. Rey has stolen the Jedi texts and loads them onto the Millennium Falcon to continue her training.

===Fictional members===
The exact size of the [[Great Jedi Purge|Pre-Purge]] Jedi's membership and operations are never specified. However, in the ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'' episode [[Star Wars Rebels#Season 1 (2014–15)|"Path of the Jedi"]], Kanan Jarrus stated: "''...There were around 10,000 Jedi Knights defending the galaxy. Now, we are few. But in those days, we had small outposts, temples spread throughout the stars. The Empire sought out these temples and destroyed many of them...''"

==== Yoda ====
{{main|Yoda}}
[[Yoda]] was a wise, experienced, and powerful Grand Master of the Jedi of an unknown species and the oldest known prophet (at least 900+ years) in existence, considered the wisest and most powerful Jedi Master within the ''Star Wars'' universe. He was knighted at age 100, and spent the next eight centuries mentoring several generations of Jedi, about 20,000 of which he took as Padawans. During this period, the green Jedi Master formed good relations with the [[Wookies]] of Kashyyyk on numerous occasions, such as when he saved their [[List of Star Wars species (P-T)#Terentatek|Terentatek]].

==== Mace Windu ====
{{main|Mace Windu}}
[[Mace Windu]] was a male human Jedi Weapons Master of the High Council and one of the last members of the Order's upper echelons before the fall of the [[Galactic Republic]]. Born into a tribe of nomads on the planet Haruun Kal, Windu was offered to Jedi anthropologists as a blessing to regain his people's connection to the Force when he was 6 months old, sometime after his parents died in the bordering jungle. He was taken as a Padawan by [[List of Star Wars species (K-O)#Mirialan|Mirialan]] Jedi Master Cyslin Myr, and began using a unique talent of seeing "shatterpoints", or [[Fault (geology)|faultlines]] in the Force that could affect the [[destiny|destinies]] of certain individuals, and indeed the [[Star Wars galaxy|galaxy]] itself. Knighted early in his career, the esteemed Windu progressed up the Jedi ranks until reaching his place on the Council, from which he was known as one of the most powerful Jedi and possibly the greatest swordsman of his time.&lt;ref name="Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He first appeared in ''[[Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace]]'', where he expressed doubt regarding Qui-Gon Jinn's conclusion about Darth Maul (who attacked him on Tatooine during the mission to escort Queen Amidala of Naboo from her Trade Federation-blockaded homeworld), but nonetheless assured the Council that their full resources would be utilized to verify the theory that the Sith could have returned. The weapons master was even the most reluctant to train young Anakin Skywalker (who Jinn believed was the prophesied Chosen One) at Jinn's request. In ''[[Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones]]'',  he led a party of 200 Jedi on a mission to rescue Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker and Padme Amidala from Separatist captivity on Geonosis, where he was able to defeat and kill the [[bounty hunter]] [[Jango Fett]] in the battle that followed. In the Clone Wars, he served the Republic as an overseer of the war effort and advisor to Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine as well as taking part in such conflicts such as the Battles of Malastare and Dantooine.

==== Qui-Gon Jinn ====
{{main|Qui-Gon Jinn}}
[[Qui-Gon Jinn]] was a wise and powerful male human Jedi Master, and the Master of Obi-Wan Kenobi. Unlike other, more conservative Jedi, he values living in the moment as the best way to embrace the Force. While other Jedi respect him highly, they are frequently puzzled by his unorthodox beliefs and ultimately deny him a seat on the Jedi Council, despite him being among the wisest and most powerful of the Jedi.&lt;ref&gt;Obi-Wan Kenobi, ''Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace'', 1999 ("If you would just follow the Code, you would be on the Council.")&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Obi-Wan Kenobi ====
{{main|Obi-Wan Kenobi}}
[[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] was a male human Jedi Master who initiated Anakin and Luke Skywalker to the Jedi arts and served as a central character during the events of the Clone Wars. Obi-Wan proved himself an adept strategist, duelist, and spy, as his leadership style heavily favored subterfuge and misdirection while commanding clone troopers, or wielding the Force.

==== Anakin Skywalker ====
{{main|Anakin Skywalker}}
[[Anakin Skywalker]] was a human male Jedi Knight and main protagonist of the prequel trilogy. He was apprenticed to Obi-Wan Kenobi and proved to be a very gifted duelist and Force user, being appointed to the Jedi High Council at the age of 23, though being denied the rank of Master. He secretly married Padme Amidala and had two children. He eventually fell to the Dark Side and became Darth Vader. While he was not technically a Jedi Master, he was a member of the Old Jedi Council, and trained a Padawan of his own, [[Ahsoka Tano]] during the [[Clone Wars (Star Wars)|Clone Wars]], who dutifully called him "Master".

====Kanan Jarrus====
{{main|Kanan Jarrus}}
Kanan Jarrus was a human male Jedi who fought for the Rebellion during its formation.  First introduced as a principle character of the animated television series ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'', Jarrus is known to be the leader of a small rebel cell called the Spectres, operating on the planet [[Lothal (Star Wars)|Lothal]].  As a survivor of Order 66, Jarrus is forced to break certain Jedi traditions to avoid being detected by Imperial forces that continue their mission to eliminate any Jedi on sight, such as eschewing traditional Jedi robes or occasionally using a blaster, a weapon typically shunned by Jedi.  After the Spectres rescued the young Ezra Bridger, Jarrus discovered his Force potential and successfully trains him to become a Jedi.  As he trains Bridger and battles Imperial forces, Jarrus' actions draw the attention of the Imperial Inquisitorius, a special task force of Force-attuned individuals who are specialized in hunting and eliminating Jedi, and he occasionally crosses paths with them.  Jarrus later earned the title of Jedi Knight during his conflict with the Inquisitors, but shortly after the last of them were defeated at the Sith temple on Malachor, he was betrayed and blinded by the former Sith Lord known only as Maul, who assisted in eliminating them solely to pursue his own goals.  Kanan then continued serving the Rebellion as it faced the Imperial tactician [[Grand Admiral Thrawn]], before sacrificing his own life to help his fellow cell members succeed in rescuing one of their own, while simultaneously disrupting production of the Imperial TIE Defender, a powerful starfighter that could have doomed the growing Rebellion.

====Ezra Bridger====
Ezra Bridger is a human male who was born on the planet Lothal precisely on the day the Galactic Empire was established.  He witnessed many injustices of the Imperial occupation of his homeworld for much of his childhood and was separated from his parents from a very early age.  He was able to survive alone using street smarts and skills, but was discovered by Kanan Jarrus to have potential Force sensitivity after he encounters the Spectres for the first time.  After discovering how much of a team player he could be during a rescue operation, they recruit Bridger, tasking Jarrus to begin training him in the ways of the Jedi, a task made difficult by the premature death of Jarrus' master, Depa Bilaba, executed after the Clone Wars.  It would be weeks before Bridger would lay his hands on a lightsaber, which was uniquely designed to accommodate his early inability to deflect projectiles with a built-in knuckle guard and mini-blaster, and even so, he was more skilled at battling stormtroopers, rather than the Inquisitors or Darth Vader, the latter who easily bested him in combat and disarmed him.  After a dangerous mission to the planet Malachor to discover the key to defeating the Sith, Bridger recovers a Sith holocron believed to hold the answers he sought, becoming the first ever known Jedi to open a Sith holocron, but soon fell under its sway for some time as he improved his combat skills and was even promoted to commander in the Rebel ranks.  It is not until after some encounters with the former Sith Lord Maul does Bridger discover that Obi-Wan Kenobi holds the key to the Sith's undoing, as he will train Luke Skywalker to confront his corrupted father.  

Bridger continued taking part in the Rebellion's war against the Empire, even as they faced the Imperial strategist Grand Admiral Thrawn.  Throughout his service, Bridger also discovered that in spite of his early combat troubles, he could uniquely develop an ability to communicate with animals, using the Force, and command them to do his bidding.  This skill would prove useful several times, including a moment when Bridger uses it to finally drive out Thrawn's forces from Lothal once and for all through the strength of purgills, large interstellar creatures. This brought a long-awaited end to the Imperial occupation of his homeworld, but at the cost of being unable to continue being with the Spectres or see his people enjoy their hard-won freedom.

==== Luke Skywalker ====
{{main|Luke Skywalker}}
[[Luke Skywalker]] was a male human Grand Master of the Jedi and the protagonist of the ''Star Wars'' original trilogy. As the last Padawan of Obi-Wan Kenobi, he became an important figure in the [[Rebel Alliance]]'s struggle against the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]]. Luke is heir to a family deeply rooted in the Force, being the twin brother of Rebellion leader Princess Leia Organa of the planet [[Alderaan]], the son of former Queen of [[Naboo]] and Republic Senator [[Padmé Amidala]] and Jedi turned Sith Lord Darth Vader (Anakin Skywalker), and the maternal uncle of [[Kylo Ren|Ben Solo]].  After redeeming his father from the Dark Side of the Force, Luke set out to train a new generation of Jedi to rebuild the Order, only to have them wiped out by Ren.  Skywalker then spent the rest of his life in [[exile]] on [[Ahch-To]], with a final heroic act of using Force Projection to distract Ren and help the [[Resistance (Star Wars)|Resistance]] flee the planet [[Crait]].

====Rey====
{{main|Rey (Star Wars)}}
[[Rey (Star Wars)]] was a human female Jedi Padawan and Scavenger and one of the main protagonists of the sequel trilogy. She is allied with the [[Resistance (Star Wars)|Resistance]] and helped to find [[Luke Skywalker]]. She found him on the planet of [[Ahch-To]] where he spent the rest of his life.  She is also the pilot of the [[Millennium Falcon]] with [[Chewbacca]]. As the Padawan of Luke Skywalker, She proved that she is powerful with the force and good at dueling.  She is now currently the Last Living Jedi since Skywalker joined [[The Force]].

{{See also|Star Wars#Themes.2C comparisons and influences on other franchises}}

===The Jedi Code===
The Jedi Code was a set of rules that governed the behavior of the Jedi Order. It taught its followers to not give in to feelings of anger toward other lifeforms, which would help them resist fear and prevent them from falling to the dark side of the Force.&lt;br&gt;
{{quote|'''The Code:'''&lt;br&gt;
When there is no emotion, there is peace.&lt;br&gt;
When there is no ignorance, there is knowledge.&lt;br&gt;
When there is no passion, there is serenity.&lt;br&gt;
When there is no chaos, there is harmony.&lt;br&gt;
When there is no death, there is the Force.

===The Four Councils===
The Four Branches of the Jedi Council are fictional institutions from the ''Star Wars'' universe. They serve the Jedi Order as an organized administrative body that governed the Order's academies, temples, interests and organizations.

====Jedi High Council====
The Jedi High Council is the main ecclesiastical leadership of the Jedi Order, which is a spiritual, philosophical and paramilitary organization. The Jedi High Council is made up of some of the strongest, wisest and most experienced members of the Jedi Order. They are elected to lead the Jedi.

====Council of First Knowledge====
The Council of First Knowledge administered the Temple-based academy and its curriculum, and funded scholar's scientific research. To this end, the Council guarded and maintained the Temple Archives and its holocron vaults, as well as the "Shadow program" at the Jedi Temple: [[Jedi Sentinel]]s tasked with hunting down Sith artifacts.&lt;ref name="JediPath"&gt;The Jedi Path: A Manual for Students of the Force&lt;/ref&gt;

====Council of Reconciliation====
The Council of Reconciliation dealt with the [[Galactic Senate]] and the Republic Diplomatic Corps in order to help bring diplomatic resolutions to conflicts and end political standoffs. The "first face" of the Republic presented to worlds interested in joining the Republic, this Council would dispatch Jedi diplomats and ambassadors to moderate debate and hammer out treaties&lt;ref name=" JediPath" /&gt;

====Council of Reassignment====
The Council of Reassignment administered the Jedi Service Corps and each of its branch councils. Organizing work for those Initiates who failed out of the academy and Knights with special talents, the Reassignment Council oversaw this branch's missions and assignments.&lt;ref name="JediPath" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Daniel Wallace |url=http://beckermayer.com/titles/star-wars-the-jedi-path-deluxe-edition/ |title=Star Wars: The Jedi Path Deluxe Edition &amp;#124; becker&amp;mayer!

===Ranks of authority and educational progress===
Members of the Order progress through four [[educational stage]]s, at times referred to as levels:

====Initiate====
Initiation is the first part of Jedi training; they are mentored by Jedi Masters in rudimentary control over the Force and basic self-defense techniques.

Most Initiates were typically Youngling (a child Jedi-in-training) receiving early and first-class education. When Jedi Sentinels discover or test a suitable "force-sensitive" candidate, they are taken to the Jedi Academy at the age of 5 (depending on the species and arbitrary years) with the parent's permission. Jedi scholarship educations are considered prestigious, as most parents are portrayed as either happy or proud of the opportunity, but sad since they are unlikely to see their child again before adulthood. Younglings were portrayed training under Jedi Master Yoda in a scene on ''Attack of the Clones'' and hiding during the assault on the Jedi Temple in ''Revenge of the Sith''.

The “Young Jedi” story arc&lt;ref&gt;Season 5 - Star Wars: The Clone Wars&lt;/ref&gt; and the episode “Path of the Jedi”&lt;ref&gt;Season 2, Star Wars: Rebels&lt;/ref&gt;  explored the Jedi tradition called "The Gathering"; where initiates traveled to the "Crystal Caves" to harvest [[kyber crystal]]s, which they would use to build their first lightsabers. Crystals were attuned to individual Jedi and lacked color. The Force spoke to each of the younglings through their crystals. To find their crystal, each initiate had to learn a lesson: courage, hope, patience, trust, confidence, and selflessness.

====Padawan{{anchor|Padawan}}====
An Initiate who successfully completes "fundamental training" is given a second-class education and then undergoes Padawan training under the tutelage of Mentor (usually a Jedi Knight or Jedi Master). They are also called "Apprentices" and "Padawan learners". As a rite of passage and the final test before the trials to knighthood, Padawans must build their own lightsabers. In the Old Republic, Padawans usually wore a hair braid on the right side of their head which was removed with a lightsaber upon attaining knighthood. They also served as Commanders in the Clone Wars. The term "padawan" appears to originate in [[Sanskrit]] and can be understood as “learner," both in Sanskrit and by contemporary native speakers of [[Indo-Aryan languages|Sanskrit-based languages]].&lt;ref name="Klaus Glashoff"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Klaus Glashoff 4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada 4"/&gt;

====Knight====
Disciplined and experienced, Jedi Knights become so only when they have completed "the trials" (final tests) and may continue to pursue a third-class education (see below) to obtain the equivalent of a [[habilitation]] or [[post-doctoral degree]]. As the most common rank, it is interchangeably referred to as "Jedi", "Jedi Knight" and "Master Jedi" (although the latter are honorifics used only by Younglings and Padawans when addressing Jedi Knights or above).

The five tests are usually known as ''Trial of Skill'', the ''Trial of Courage'', the ''Trial of the Flesh'', the ''Trial of Spirit'', and the ''Trial of Insight (or Knowledge)''. In ''Return of the Jedi'', Master Yoda gives his apprentice, Luke Skywalker, the trial of confronting Darth Vader for a second time so he might become a full-fledged Knight. Occasionally, performing an extraordinary (usually heroic) act can earn a Padawan learner Jedi status, such as when Obi-Wan Kenobi defeats the Sith Lord [[Darth Maul]]. By the time of the movies distinct "battle classes" were not necessary as the Republic had not seen war in over a thousand years, and the title of Knight was simply a rank once again.

====Master====
Jedi Master is a term of respect used by beings who respect the Jedi. Regarded as among the most accomplished and recognized [[polymath]]s in the ''Star Wars'' galaxy. Upon completion of [[Vocational education|vocational]] or [[postgraduate education]], a Jedi Knight becomes a Jedi Master after successfully training a Padawan learner to Knight status. Though this is the most common manner, there are other ways of attaining the rank.

===Specializations and occupations===
Various careers, occupations, ranks and titles were available to all Jedi. Upon a Padawan's ascension to "''Knighthood''-status", a Jedi pursued higher education or [[vocational education|vocational education and training]] in a field of expertise.  Before the [[Great Jedi Purge]], Knights would choose a career based on preference, personal talents and skills, and were given the opportunity to join the '''''Order of the Guardian''''', the '''''Order of the Consular''''', or '''''Order of the Sentinel'''''. In addition to their specialization, in times of war the High Council could demand that the members of the Order assume military ranks in order to defend the Republic.
* Grand Master of the Jedi: The Grand Master is usually the oldest, most experienced and best trained of all Jedi. A Grand Master is voted unanimously by the Jedi High Council. The Grand Master dictates the organization's general policies while providing direction and guidance to the entire Jedi Order. [[Yoda]] and [[Luke Skywalker]] were Jedi Grandmasters.
* Master of the High Council: The Master of the High Council is elected by the Jedi High Council, which acts as chairman. Its chief responsibilities include; presiding over High Council meetings of the assembled group, conducts Jedi businesses in an orderly fashion, managing the particulars of the day-to-day administration of the Jedi Order, act as representative or spokesperson to the [[Galactic Senate]], and serving as the Grand Master's junior partner. It is believed that Jedi Master [[Mace Windu]] filled this position at the time of the clone wars.
* Chief Librarian of the Archives: The overseer of the ''Jedi Archives'', ''Holocron Vault'', ''Librarian's Assembly'' and the ''Educational Corps''. Second only to the Grand Master in administrative importance, the Chief Librarian worked closely with the ''Council of First Knowledge''. Around the time of the Clone Wars, the Chief Librarian was the elderly Jedi Master [[Jocasta Nu]].
* Jedi General: A title given to those given commanding roles in the [[Grand Army of the Republic]] during the Clone Wars.
* Jedi Commander: This title was given to Jedi Padawans under the leadership of Jedi Knights and Jedi Masters with their roles as Jedi Generals in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars.
* Jedi Guardian: Jedi Guardians focused all aspects of combat as an extension of their being, and trained on combining and perfecting their athletic, aviation and martial art skills with mastery of the Force. The Force skills studied by the Guardians were typically those used for quickly disabling an opponent and aiding in agility and stamina. Many were stationed within Republic planetary or sectoral government's security agencies where they worked as special peacekeepers and law enforcement agents, helping to quell riots and capture terrorists. The highest ranking Jedi Guardians were stationed at the Jedi academies as instructors tasked with passing down their experience to the young students of the Order. Those Jedi who mastered lightsaber-combat techniques (such as Mace Windu) were dubbed Weapon Masters and were among the greatest warriors of the Order.
* Jedi Consular: Jedi Consulars focused on further mastery of the Force and the sharpening of mental faculties, and wielded a lightsaber only for self-defense. Overseen by the Council of Reconciliation, Jedi Consular's were often called upon to act as impartial advisers, diplomats, and historians. Most Consulars specialized as historians, archivists, librarians, archaeologists, geologists, biologists, mathematicians, and astronomists; they contributed to the growth and preservation of the [[Jedi Archives]] as "Lore Keepers" directed by the ''Librarian's Assembly''. Some Consulars worked closely with the Republic bureaucrats to assist in greeting unaligned governments and helping them join the Republic and given the authority to hammer out a compromise or treaty during tense negotiations, backed by the full support of the Senate and Jedi Order. Some Consulars joined the Circle of Jedi Healers (headquartered out of the Coruscant Temple's ''Halls of Healing'') and focused on the medical and humanitarian aspects of the Force, manipulating the Living Force to perform the art of healing. Those Jedi specifically predisposed to receive visions through the Force were known as "Seers", maintaining and updating the Order's holocrons; the most perceptive of these Jedi (such as Yoda) were known as Prophets and foretold the future of the galaxy.
* Jedi Sentinel: Jedi Sentinels focused on diverse disciplines, applying their force abilities as engineers, technicians, intelligence and security experts. Most Sentinels were stationed at numerous locations for decades, to serve as liaison officers between the system or sector and the Republic. The anonymous "Jedi Temple Guard" Sentinels were charged with guarding the Jedi Temple. Some Sentinels aided [[law enforcement agency|police]] as detectives through the use of [[the Force]]. Since Republic law required all newborns undergo "Force-sensitivity" testing, Sentinels who worked as members of the ''Acquisition Division of the Order'' routinely tracked down and identified Force-sensitive children to assess whether they met the qualifications to receive training in the Jedi Order. The most elite Sentinels became "Shadows": the Jedi-[[secret police]] who worked under the supervision of the ''First Knowledge Council'' to destroy all remnants of the Sith.

===Resources and Technology===
Within the ''Star Wars'' universe, the Jedi are usually portrayed wearing simple robes and carrying specialized field gear for their missions. Their philosophical lifestyles mirror those of real-world [[religious vows]] and [[evangelical counsels]], as their personal possessions are provided exclusively by the Jedi Order, and are only meant to allow [[self-sufficiency]].

====Weapons====
{{Main|Lightsaber|Weapons in Star Wars}}
The most notable instrument wielded by a Jedi is the Lightsaber. Both Jedi and Sith use lightsabers, though the former regards one as a tool, the latter, a weapon. The Jedi's lightsabers emit [[cool colors]], usually blue or green blades (sometimes yellow, or purple, as seen in the case of Mace Windu), while the Sith emit [[warm color]]s (red). Lightsabers can be of many different colors depending on the crystal fixture.  Most Jedi use naturally formed crystals, whereas Sith tend to use synthetic crystals, which are usually red in color.

====Vehicles====
{{Main|Jedi starfighter}}

Eta-2 Actis Jedi Interceptors first appeared in ''Revenge of the Sith''. Delta-7B Aethersprite Jedi starfighters appear in ''Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones'' and ''Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith''. In ''Attack of the Clones'', Obi-Wan Kenobi travels via Jedi starfighter to [[Kamino (Star Wars)|Kamino]] to investigate the attempted assassination of [[Padmé Amidala]]; he also flies a Jedi starfighter to Geonosis in an attempt to track down the [[bounty hunter]] [[Jango Fett]].&lt;ref name="jstm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/starship/delta7/|title=Jedi starfighter (The Movies)|work=Star Wars Databank|publisher=[[Lucasfilm]]|accessdate=2007-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lacking a [[hyperdrive]], the starfighter relies on an external sled to propel it through hyperspace.&lt;ref name="jstm" /&gt; Kenobi and [[Anakin Skywalker]] ([[Hayden Christensen]]) fly updated Jedi starfighters (called Jedi Interceptors) in the opening sequence of ''Revenge of the Sith''.&lt;ref name="jstm" /&gt; Later, [[Plo Koon]] ([[Matt Sloan (visual effects)|Matt Sloan]]) flies an ''Revenge of the Sith''-era starfighter when he is shot down by clone troopers carrying out Emperor Palpatine's ([[Ian McDiarmid]]) Order 66.&lt;ref name="jstm" /&gt;

The Jedi starfighter's triangular shape in ''Attack of the Clones'' stems from the shape of [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Imperial]] [[Star Destroyer]]s in the original ''Star Wars'' trilogy.&lt;ref name="jsbts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/starship/delta7/?id=bts|title=Jedi starfighter (Behind the Scenes)|work=Star Wars Databank|publisher=[[Lucasfilm]]|accessdate=2007-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]] designer [[Doug Chiang]] identified the Jedi starfighter as one of the first designs that bridges the aesthetic between the prequel and original trilogies.&lt;ref name="wedgie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://starwars.apple.com/ep2/making_of/x-ep2-wedgie_480.mov |title=Wedgie 'Em Out |publisher=[[Lucasfilm]] |accessdate=2007-12-25 |work=Making Episode II Webdocs |format=QuickTime video |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060112071240/http://starwars.apple.com/ep2/making_of/x-ep2-wedgie_480.mov |archivedate=12 January 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chiang noted that viewers' familiarity with the Star Destroyer's appearance and Imperial affiliation gives added symbolism to the Jedi craft's appearance and foreshadows the Empire's rise to power.&lt;ref name="wedgie" /&gt; The starfighter seen in ''Revenge of the Sith'' is a cross between the previous film's vessel and the Empire's [[TIE fighter]]s from the original trilogy.&lt;ref name="jsbts" /&gt; [[Hasbro]]'s expanding wings in the ''Attack of the Clones'' Jedi starfighter toy inspired the opening wings in the ''Revenge of the Sith'' vessel.&lt;ref name="jsbts" /&gt; The starfighter in the ''Revenge of the Sith'' is called a Jedi Interceptor Starfighter.

====Jedi Archives====
The Jedi Archives, known as The Great Library of Ossus or The Great Library of the Jedi, contained the galaxy's most priceless and ancient of texts sacred to Jedi scholars and archaeologists. Among these were Sith artifacts, considered by the Jedi Order to be the most dangerous artifacts in the galaxy, that were accessible only to those able to control the Dark Side of the Force.&lt;ref&gt;Ultimate Star Wars&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jedi archives of the Jedi Temple in the movie ''Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones'' bear a startling resemblance to the Long Room of the [[Trinity College Library]] in Dublin. This resemblance resulted in controversy as permission had not been sought to use the building's likeness in the film. However, [[Lucasfilm]] denied that the Long Room was the basis for the Jedi archives, and officials from Trinity College Library decided not to take any legal action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/discover/kerry-invaded-by-evil-galactic-empire-in-class-star-wars-mockup-637602.html|title=Kerry invaded by evil galactic empire in class Star Wars mockup|work=Breaking News|accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scyfilove.com/1948/visit-the-jedi-archives-in-real-life-at-trinity-college-dublin/|title=Visit the Jedi Archives in real life – at Trinity College, Dublin|publisher=|accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jedi Academy====
{{Redirect|Jedi Academy|the trilogy by Kevin J. Anderson|Jedi Academy trilogy|the games|Star Wars: Jedi Knight (series)|the Disney attraction|Star Wars Weekends#Jedi Training Academy}}
The Jedi academies were established to train [[Force-sensitive]] beings accepted into the Jedi Order in the ways of the Force. Overseen by the Council of First Knowledge, each academy was governed by an advisory Council appointed by their superiors on Coruscant. Mainstreaming the majority of teachings at the Temple, certain practices were permitted to vary from world to world. However, at all sanctioned academies, a group of Jedi Masters would instruct Initiates to the Order in the ways of the Force. The size of the school varied from world to world; the smallest consisted of a single clan of younglings, and the largest was the main academy housed within the Jedi Temple of Coruscant. Most academies had been established during the Old Sith Wars and were located in the Galactic Rim. Some were located on or near Force-wellsprings or places significant to the Order like crystal caves or nexuses of [[Dark side of the force|dark side energies]] that needed constant monitoring.&lt;ref name="TJP"&gt;''[[Ahsoka Tano#The Jedi Path: A Manual for Students of the Force (Book)|The Jedi Path: A Manual for Students of the Force]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the traditional academies established by the Order, the Exploration Corps maintained several spacefaring mobile academies such as the ''[[Chu'unthor]]'' so that roaming the galaxy and exploring new worlds could be achieved while still teaching traditional doctrine.&lt;ref name="TJP" /&gt;

By the fall of the [[Galactic Republic]] in 19 BBY, many of the ancient academies had been shut down for decades, with the Council of First Knowledge preferring the central teachings of the Coruscant Temple. After the dissolution of the Order during the [[Great Jedi Purge]], all orthodox Temples and academies were routed and burned in order to prevent any more Jedi from learning the secrets of the Force. However, the [[Galactic Empire]]'s chokehold on Force-education did not last and the Order was [[New Jedi Order|reformed]] following the conclusion of the [[Galactic Civil War]]. When [[Grand Master (Jedi)|Grand Master]] [[Luke Skywalker]]'s New Order became a single class of twelve students including his nephew Ben Solo, however it was reduced to only himself when his nephew turned to the darkside and became Kylo Ren.

====Jedi Temple====
In the ''Star Wars'' prequel trilogy saga, the Jedi Temple is located on the capital planet of Coruscant. As the chief administrative headquarters, the Temple served the Order in three capacities: a monastery and library for the Jedi seeking enlightenment and to reflect on the will of the Force; an academy and training center for Jedi younglings and Padawans who endeavored to join the ranks of the Jedi Knights; and government, in which the Masters of the Jedi High Council guided the Order's direction. It was originally built atop an old "dark-side nexus" shrine during the birth of the Republic, so as to be symbolic to the Coruscant people that the tyrannical rule of the Sith was over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/news/hidden-knowledge-5-fascinating-facts-about-the-jedi-temple|title=5 Fascinating Facts About the Jedi Temple - StarWars.com|date=6 November 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Revenge of the Sith'', the Jedi Temple is attacked by clone troopers of the [[501st Legion (Star Wars)|501st Legion]], led by the newly christened Darth Vader, who butchered the Jedi within and set the Temple alight. After the fall of the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic, the Temple became the '''Palace of the Emperor''' and a location for his dark side artifacts. It would serve as Sidious' residence for over two decades until his death at the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY. The Temple is visible in the celebrations on Coruscant at the end of ''Return of the Jedi''. After the destruction of the Sith, Luke Skywalker—the last of the Jedi—recovered fragments of a Force-sensitive tree that was once located at the heart of the Jedi Temple.

''[[Architects' Journal]]'' rated the temple third on its top-ten architecture of ''Star Wars'' list behind the second [[Death Star]] and [[Jabba the Hutt’s palace]] on [[Tatooine]], and ahead of Coruscant, the capital city of the Old Republic.&lt;ref name="architecture"&gt;{{cite web |first=James |last=Pallister |url=http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/story.aspx?storyCode=5203477 |title=Top 10: The Architecture of Star Wars (pt II) |date=15 June 2009 |publisher=Architectsjournal.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The temple is described in the article as adapting "the robust typology of Mayan temples, with durasteel cladding specified for the external stone walls for improved defensive strength" and said to be a [[ziggurat]] that "is built above a Force-nexus and has ample room for training facilities, accommodation and the Jedi Archive."&lt;ref name="architecture"/&gt; The temple has five towers, the tallest is Tranquility Spire, that are stylistically similar to the [[minaret]]s surrounding the [[Hagia Sophia]] in [[Istanbul]].&lt;ref name="architecture"/&gt; ''[[Star Wars Insider]]'' listed it as the one hundredth greatest thing about Star Wars in its one hundredth issue special.

==Other force-sensitive organizations==
Not every "Dark Side"-user is a Sith; nor is every "Light Side"-user a Jedi. Within the ''Star Wars'' Expanded Universe, people of all species have demonstrated varying "force-sensitive" powers and abilities. These "force-wielders" are often depicted with little to no formal Jedi training in the Force and originating from primitive planets.

===The Sith Organization===
{{Further|Sith}}
====Dark Side Adept====
Dark Side Adept is an official term, used to describe someone with the power to use the dark side of the Force outside of the traditions of the Jedi or the Sith. They were often steeped in the lore of the dark side and opposed to those who used the light side, such as Jedi. While all Sith were technically "Dark Side Adepts", the term was not exclusive to them, as non-Sith individuals such as [[Asajj Ventress]], [[Kylo Ren]], and the [[List of Star Wars Rebels characters#Imperial Inquisitors|Grand Inquisitor]] were considered Dark Side Adepts. Dark Side Adepts were referenced in passing in [[James Luceno]]'s canon novel ''Tarkin''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Tarkin-Star-Wars-James-Luceno/dp/0345511522 |title=Tarkin: Star Wars: James Luceno: 9780345511522: Amazon.com: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Force-wielders without affiliation===
Bendu debuted in the Star Wars Rebels season 3 episode, ''"Steps Into Shadow"''. Bendu was a Force-sensitive individual who resided on the remote planet of [[Atollon]] and represented the "center" of the Force, between the light side and the dark side. "Jedi and Sith wield the ''Ashla'' and ''Bogan''. The light and the dark. I'm the one in the middle. The Bendu..." stated Bendu. He is depicted as one who seeks balance, and has been likened to [[Tom Bombadil]] of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]].'' The term "Bendu" first appears in the original script for Star Wars as the name of the Jedi Knights, the "Jedi-Bendu".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hem.bredband.net/wookiee/development/ |title=The Development of Star Wars – As Seen through the Scripts by George Lucas |publisher=Hem.bredband.net |date= |accessdate=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://starwarz.com/starkiller/ |title=Starkiller – The Jedi Bendu Script Site |publisher=Starwarz.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Star Wars: Rough Draft&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Making of Star Wars: The Definitive Story Behind the Original Film&lt;/ref&gt;

Most notably, Anakin Skywalker's padawan Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, and continued to wield the Force, she never affiliated or created any Force sensitive organization.

==''Legends'' non-canonical portrayal of the Jedi Order==
{{Main|Star Wars expanded universe}}

With the 2012 acquisition of [[Lucasfilm]] by [[The Walt Disney Company]], most of the licensed ''Star Wars'' novels and comics produced since the originating 1977 film [[Star Wars (film)|''Star Wars'']] were rebranded as ''Star Wars Legends'' and declared non-canon to the franchise in April 2014.&lt;ref name="THR Legends"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/lucasfilm-unveils-new-plans-star-698973 |last=McMilian |first=Graeme |title=Lucasfilm Unveils New Plans for ''Star Wars'' Expanded Universe |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=April 25, 2014 |accessdate=May 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SW Legends"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/news/the-legendary-star-wars-expanded-universe-turns-a-new-page |title=The Legendary ''Star Wars'' Expanded Universe Turns a New Page |publisher=[[StarWars.com]] |date=April 25, 2014 |accessdate=May 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SW Adult"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://starwars.com/news/disney-publishing-worldwide-and-random-house-announce-relaunch-of-star-wars-adult-fiction-line.html |title=Disney and Random House announce relaunch of ''Star Wars'' Adult Fiction line |publisher=StarWars.com |date=April 25, 2014 |accessdate=May 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Je'daii===
{{further|Star Wars: Dawn of the Jedi}}
The Je'daii Order, precursors to the modern Jedi, studied and used both the light and dark sides of the Force equally. The preview issue of ''Dawn of the Jedi'' states that the Je'daii originated ten thousand years before the saga takes place (approximately 46,453 years [[Yavin|BBY]]). They were more monk than warrior, and their capital was Tython in the Deep Core

===The New Jedi Order===
{{further|The New Jedi Order}}
In novels set after the events of the film series, Luke Skywalker re-established the Jedi High Council as part of his [[The New Jedi Order|New Jedi Order]]. The most notable difference between the format of the new council and the old is that only half of the council are made up of Jedi, while the other half consisted of politicians. Following the [[Yuuzhan Vong War]], the Jedi withdrew their support from any one political entity and relocated to Ossus, where Luke had a full Jedi Council re-established.

In novels set after the events of the ''original''-trilogy film series, The New Jedi Order was the restored and reformed Jedi organization, in the wake of the Great Jedi Purge and subsequent fall of the Galactic Empire. The Jedi Knights, reduced in number to only a handful, were slowly restored, primarily under the leadership of Grandmaster [[Luke Skywalker]]. Luke Skywalker abolished the traditional Master/Padawan system. He believed all Jedi should be both teachers and students; that they should both learn from and mentor each other, and not just from one Master.

Within the Expanded Universe, ''[[The New Jedi Order]]'' indicates that the Jedi Temple on Coruscant is no longer standing but it is rebuilt as a gift to Jedi for their services and achievements during the [[Yuuzhan Vong]] invasion. The new temple is in the form of a massive pyramid made from stone and transparisteel that is designed to fit into the new look of Coruscant, though internally it is identical to the design seen in ''Revenge of the Sith''.

==Real world cultural impact and critical response==
The [[United States Army]] had a group of officers in the early 1980s who promoted [[maneuver warfare]] tactics, and who were derisively referred to as Jedi by more conventional officers who were satisfied with attrition tactics and methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=e_o_Ay6D9vEC&amp;pg=PT314&amp;lpg=PT314&amp;dq=%22maneuver+warfare%22+jedi#v=onepage&amp;q=%22maneuver%20warfare%22%20jedi&amp;f=false |title=Commanders |first=Bob |last=Woodward |authorlink=Bob Woodward |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |date=2012 |accessdate=2014-07-18 |isbn=9781471104749}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&amp;dat=19910317&amp;id=ELAeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ec4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7042,247120|last=Kaplan|first=Fred|title=Schwarzkopf's war plan came from Army's Jedi Knights |newspaper=[[Spartanburg Herald-Journal]] |date=1991-03-17|p=A13 |accessdate=2014-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Analysis ===
In ''Star Wars and Philosophy'', William Stephens compares the Jedi to [[Stoicism]]{{quote|text=To recap, the virtues the Jedi shares with the Stoic sage are patience, timeliness, deep commitment, seriousness (as opposed to frivolity), calmness (as opposed to anger or euphoria), peacefulness (as opposed to aggression), caution (as opposed to recklessness), benevolence (as opposed to hatred), joy (as opposed to sullenness), passivity (as opposed to agitation), and wisdom. Given all these virtues, Yoda certainly resembles what the ancient Stoics described as the sage—the ideal person who has perfected his reason and achieved complete wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stephens |first=William O. |editor1-last=Decker |editor1-first=Kevin S. |editor2-last=Eberl |editor2-first=Jason T. |editor3-last=Irwin |editor3-first=William |date=2013 |title=Star Wars and Philosophy: More Powerful than You Can Possibly Imagine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U7VOAiIvMSUC |chapter=Chapter 2: "Stoicism in the stars: Yoda, the Emperor, and the Force |publisher=Open Court |isbn=0812697014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Media===
Jedi have made their way into certain areas of pop culture, such as [["Weird Al" Yankovic]]'s song "[[The Saga Begins]]", a parody of "[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]". In the film ''[[The Men Who Stare at Goats (film)|The Men Who Stare at Goats]]'' (2009), a reporter follows a former soldier who claimed to be a "Jedi warrior", a nickname for [[psychic]] spies in the US military.

===Religion===
{{Main|Jediism}}
One of the enduring influences the ''Star Wars'' saga has had in popular culture is the idea of the fictional Jedi values being interpreted as a modern philosophical path or religion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Woolley|first = Jamie|title = A New Religion|publisher = BBC News|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2002/05/08/star_wars_a_new_religion_article.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; spawning various movements such as the Jediism (religious) and the [[Jedi census phenomenon]].

'''''Ker v. Illinois''''', 119 U.S. 436 (1886), is a [[U.S. Supreme Court]] case. It held that a fugitive kidnapped from abroad could not claim any violation of the Constitution, laws or treaties of the United States. 

The incident that led to this decision involved a [[Pinkerton Detective Agency]] agent, Henry Julian, was hired by the federal government to collect a larcenist, Frederick Ker, who had fled to [[Peru]]. Although Julian had the necessary extradition papers&amp;mdash;the two governments had negotiated an extradition treaty a decade earlier&amp;mdash;he found that there was no official to meet his request due to the recent Chilean military [[occupation of Lima]]. Rather than return home empty-handed, Julian kidnapped the fugitive, with assistance from Chilean forces, and placed him on a U.S. vessel heading back to the United States.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9406">A '''land contract''' — often described by [[#Other names|other terminology listed below]] — is a contract between the buyer and seller of [[real property]] in which the seller provides the buyer [[credit (finance)|financing]] in the purchase, and the buyer repays the resulting loan in [[Hire purchase|installments]]. Under a land contract, the seller retains the legal [[Title (property)|title]] to the property, while permitting the buyer to take possession of it for most purposes other than legal ownership. The sale price is typically paid in periodic installments, often with a [[balloon payment]] at the end to make the [[timelength]] of payments shorter than in the corresponding fully [[Amortization|amortized]] loan (i.e., a loan without a final balloon payment). When the full purchase price has been paid including any [[interest]], the seller is obligated to [[Conveyancing|convey]] (to the buyer) legal title to the property. An initial [[down payment]] from the buyer to the seller is usually also required.  

The [[land contract law|legal status of land contracts]] varies between jurisdictions.{{vague|date= October 2016|reason = implausible that correlation between "region[s]" and "legal status[es]" is more than — well, let's call it "a vague" — tendency.}}

Since a land contract specifies the sale of a specific item of [[real estate]] between a seller and buyer, a land contract can be considered a special type of [[real estate contract]]. In the usual, more conventional real estate contracts, a seller does not provide a loan to the buyer; the contract either does not specify a loan or includes provisions for a loan from a different "third party" lender, usually a financial institution in practice. When third party lenders are involved, typically a [[lien]], as part of a [[Mortgage law|mortgage]] or [[trust deed (real estate)|trust deed]], is placed on the property, in which the property serves as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] until the loan is repaid.

{{anchor|Other names}}Other terms for a land contract include:
* terms contract&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/sola1962100/s29a.html SALE OF LAND ACT 1962 - Section 29A] (Vic, Australia)&lt;/ref&gt;
* contract for deed
* agreement for deed
* land installment contract
* installment sale agreement

==Installment payments==
It is common for the installment payments of the purchase price to be similar to mortgage payments in amount and effect.  The amount is often determined according to a mortgage [[amortization schedule]]. In effect, each installment payment is partial payment of the purchase price and partial payment of interest on the unpaid purchase price. This is similar to mortgage payments which are part repayment of the principal amount of the mortgage loan and part interest.  As the buyer pays more toward the principal of the loan over time, his(her) equity (equitable title or equitable interest) in the property increases. For example, if a buyer pays a $2000 down payment and borrows $8000 for a $10000 parcel of land, and pays off in installments another $4000 of this loan (not including interest), the buyer has $6000 of equity in the land (which is 60% of the equitable title), but the seller holds legal title to the land as recorded in documentation ([[deed]]s) in a government [[Recorder of deeds|recorder's office]] until the loan is completely paid off.  However, if the buyer defaults on installment payments, the land contract may consider the failure to timely pay installments a [[breach of contract]] and the land equity may revert to the seller, depending on the land contract provisions.

Since land contracts can easily be written or modified by any seller or buyer; one may come across any variety of repayment plans. Interest only, [[negative amortization]]s, short balloons, extremely long amortizations just to name a few.  It is not uncommon for land contracts to go unrecorded. For several reasons, the buyer or seller may decide that the contract is not to be recorded in the register of deeds. This does not make the contract invalid, but it does increase exposure to undesirable side effects.  Some states, such as Minnesota, issue contracts without an [[acceleration clause]], which in the case of a default leaves the seller in a position to either cancel the contract, discharging any principal deficiency, as in the case of deprecation, or to litigate for 18 months or more while letting the buyer, if not a corporation, retain their rights to the property while collection attempts are made, by which time the buyer will often qualify for bankruptcy, making the contract, when lacking said [[acceleration clause]], effectively an installment option, when the buyer has no other lienable assets.  In bankruptcy, some regions will interpret it as an [[executory contract]] that can be rejected, while others will treat it as a debt to be paid out of the bankruptcy trust.  This and a wide variety of other legal ambiguities has led to a trend toward eliminating the use of Land Contracts to remove any incentives, and as a result, the disadvantages that these contracts have compared to the standard note and mortgage, which are more clearly defined in, and regulated by, law.  &lt;ref name="nature of contract"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3736/is_199801/ai_n8759824/pg_19/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100912193027/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3736/is_199801/ai_n8759824/pg_19/ |archivedate=2010-09-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons for a land contract==
Although most land contracts can be used for a variety of reasons, their most common use is as a form of short-term seller financing. Usually, but not always, the date on which the full amount of the purchase price is due will be years sooner than when the purchase price would be paid in full according to the amortization schedule.  This results in the final payment being a large [[balloon payment]].  Since the amount of the final payment is so large, the buyer may obtain a conventional mortgage loan from a bank to make the final payment.  Land contracts are sometimes used by buyers who do not qualify for conventional mortgage loans offered by a traditional lending institution, for reasons of unestablished or poor credit or an insufficient down payment.{{Fact|date=November 2007}}  Land contracts are also used when the seller is eager to sell and the buyer is not given enough time to arrange for conventional financing.

There can be other advantages of using a land contract too.  When a third-party lender, such as a financial institution, provides a loan, this third party has its own interests to protect against the other two parties involved, the seller and buyer.  Establishing the correct title and value of the property to be used as collateral is important to the lender.  Thus, the lender commonly requires title service including title search and [[title insurance]] by an independent title company, [[Real estate appraisal|appraisal]] and termite inspection of the property to ensure it has sufficient value, a [[Cadastre|land survey]] to ensure there are no encroachments, and use of lawyers to ensure the [[closing (real estate)|closing]] is done correctly.  These third party lender requirements add to [[closing costs]] which the lender requires the seller and/or buyer to pay.  If the seller is also the lender, these costs are usually not required by the seller and may result in closing cost savings and fewer complications.  It may also be the seller's position that if the buyer requires any of these services, he could pay for the costs and make arrangements himself.  For properties where only relatively undeveloped land is involved and if the seller is willing to finance, the price of the empty land may be so low that the conventional closing costs are not worthwhile and can be an impediment to a quick, simple sale.  Easy financing and a simple sale transaction may be a good selling point for a seller to offer a buyer.

A land contract is a unilateral contract and cannot be assigned to another buyer without the consent of the seller providing the financing.

== Consumer-protection concerns {{anchor|Concerns Growing}} ==
Because of growing concerns that sales via land contract might violate [[truth in lending]] laws, the [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]] (CFPB) is considering regulating these real estate sales.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/11/business/dealbook/contract-for-deed-lending-gets-federal-scrutiny.html&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015, Texas law was changed to automatically place the legal title to the property with the buyer by filing the contract with the deed records office of the county where the property is located.  While the seller loses title, the seller retains a vendor's lien in the property for the outstanding balance of the contract.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edinburgpolitics.com/2015/06/01/protections-for-low-income-texas-homeowners-including-thousands-who-live-in-colonias-approved-by-the-legislature-says-rep-canales/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MIVILUDES''' (an acronym for the [[French language|French-language]] phrase ''Mission interministérielle de vigilance et de lutte contre les dérives sectaires'', i.e. "Interministerial Mission for Monitoring and Combatting Cultic Deviances") is a [[France|French]] [[government agency]], with responsibility for monitoring groups perceived &lt;!-- perceived by whom exactly ? --&gt; to constitute a threat to public order or that violate French law, coordinating the government response, informing the public about potential risks, and assisting victims. The agency was created in 2002.

==Functions==
The mission of MIVILUDES involves analysing "the phenomenon of movements with a [[cult]]ic character whose actions affront the [[rights of man]] and  fundamental liberties, or which constitute a threat to public order or which are contrary to the laws and regulations".&lt;ref&gt;From the ''[[Journal Officiel de la République Française|Journal Officiel]]'' of 28 November 2002, quoted in [[:fr:Mission interministérielle de vigilance et de lutte contre les dérives sectaires|Mission interministérielle de vigilance et de lutte contre les dérives sectaires]] : ''Sa mission est définie officiellement (dans le Journal Officiel du 28 novembre 2002) comme étant d'analyser « le phénomène des mouvements à caractère sectaire dont les agissements sont attentatoires aux droits de l'homme et aux libertés fondamentales ou constituent une menace à l'ordre public ou sont contraires aux lois et règlements ».''&lt;/ref&gt;

MIVILUDES provides information related to "cultic deviances" to the media, the French government, and individual members of the public. It recommends contacts and other organizations, and produces and archives documentation and discussion papers on groups considered cults.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miviludes.gouv.fr/spip.php?page=plan Mission Interministérielle de VIgilance et de LUtte contre les DÉrives Sectaires&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101013811/http://www.miviludes.gouv.fr/spip.php?page=plan |date=2007-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
===Background===
The French authorities created MIVILUDES as the successor to MILS (''Mission interministérielle de lutte contre les sectes''; English: "Interministerial Mission in the Fight Against Cults"), which itself functioned from 7 October 1998 as the successor to the ''Observatoire interministériel sur les sectes'' established on 9 May 1996. These organisations were in charge of co-ordinating government monitoring of cults. 

In February 1998, MILS, headed by [[Alain Vivien]], released its annual report on their monitoring of cults in France. The operations of MILS, and Alain Vivien's background as the head of an [[Anti-Cult Movement|anti-cult organization]] (he had served as President of the [[Centre Roger Ikor]] from 1997 to 1998&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.ccmm.asso.fr/index.php3 |title=Centre de documentation, d'éducation et d'action Contre les Manipulations Mentales |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070127111947/http://www.ccmm.asso.fr/index.php3 |archivedate=2007-01-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;), had occasionally received criticism from several human-rights organizations, such as the [[International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights]],&lt;ref&gt;

(See also [[About-Picard law#Reactions]]). In January 1999 Vivien requested and received police protection following threats and the burglary of his home.&lt;ref&gt;[[L'Humanité]], January 14, 1999; {{cite web|url=https://www.humanite.fr/journal/1999-01-14/1999-01-14-441385 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050430103350/http://www.humanite.fr/journal/1999-01-14/1999-01-14-441385 |archivedate=2005-04-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vivien resigned in June 2002 under criticism.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.cesnur.org/2002/fr_vivien.htm Alain Vivien Resigns from President of the French Anti-Cult Mission]&lt;/ref&gt;

===MIVILUDES===
MIVILUDES was created by a [[President of the French Republic|president]]ial decree on 28 November 2002. [[Jean-Louis Langlais]], a senior civil-servant at the [[Ministry of the Interior]], served as its president from 2002 to 2005.&lt;ref name="miviludes.gouv.fr"&gt;[http://www.miviludes.gouv.fr/spip.php?article138&amp;iddiv=2 Mission Interministérielle de VIgilance et de LUtte contre les DÉrives Sectaires&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013110316/http://www.miviludes.gouv.fr/spip.php?article138&amp;iddiv=2 |date=2007-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Announcing the formation of MIVILUDES, the French government acknowledged the criticism that MILS had received from outside France for certain activities that could be considered in violation of [[religious freedom]]. The decree establishing MIVILUDES&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miviludes.gouv.fr/spip.php?rubrique162&amp;iddiv=1 Mission Interministérielle de VIgilance et de LUtte contre les DÉrives Sectaires&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026085807/http://www.miviludes.gouv.fr/spip.php?rubrique162&amp;iddiv=1 |date=2007-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
referred to MILS only indirectly in announcing the abrogation (in Article 8) of the decree establishing MILS. 

In an interview in March 2003, Langlais categorised the fight as not against "sects", but against "sectarian deviances". He stated that current French law lacks a definition for a "sect" and, therefore "the law cannot define sectarian deviances". Nevertheless, he portrayed the role of MIVILUDES as contributing to "defining what could simply be an administrative jurisprudence".&lt;ref&gt;'France and "cults": a new orientation' - Interview with Jean-Louis Langlais, by Willy Fautré. ''Compass Direct'', 5 April 2003. [http://www.religioscope.info/article_138.shtml Available online; retrieved 2007-01-28 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2004 report by the [[United States Commission on International Religious Freedom]] concluded with an assessment that the restructuring of the main French agency concerned with this issue — referring to MILS being replaced by MIVILUDES — had improved religious freedoms in France.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Jean-Michel Roulet became president of MIVILUDES in October 2005,&lt;ref name="miviludes.gouv.fr"/&gt; followed by [[Georges Fenech]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miviludes.gouv.fr/-Historique-?iddiv=2 Historique] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507073958/http://www.miviludes.gouv.fr/-Historique-?iddiv=2 |date=2011-05-07 }}//La MIVILUDES&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''messenger-at-arms''' is an officer of the [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Court of Session]], responsible for serving documents and enforcing [[court order]]s throughout Scotland. Messengers-at-arms must have a commission as a [[sheriff officer]] although, unlike sheriff officers, the jurisdiction of a messenger-at-arms is not limited to the area for which they have a commission.&lt;ref&gt;Messengers-at-Arms and Sheriff Officers:  {{cite web|title=Background |url=http://www.smaso.org/background.html |publisher=The Society of Messengers-at-Arms and Sheriff Officers | accessdate=2007-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both messengers-at-arms and sheriff officers are employed by private businesses and charge fees that are set by [[Act of Sederunt]].&lt;ref&gt;Service by messenger-at-arms:  {{cite web|title=Chapter 16 - Part One - Service, intimation and diligence |url=http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/session/rules/chapter16_01.asp |publisher=[[Scottish Court Service]] |accessdate=2007-11-23 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023132332/http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/session/rules/chapter16_01.asp |archivedate=2007-10-23 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Act of Sederunt (Fees of Messengers-at-Arms) 2004 :  {{cite web|title=Scottish Statutory Instrument 2004 No. 515 |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ssi/2004/515/contents/made |publisher=[[Office of Public Sector Information]] | accessdate=2007-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally known as an "Officer of the King", the office of messenger-at-arms dates back several hundred years.  Messengers-at-arms have been under the control of the [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]] since at least 1510, and are still appointed by Lord Lyon, although now on the recommendation of the Court of Session, to execute summonses and letters of diligence connected with the Court of Session and High Court of Justiciary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Message |volume=18 |page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The History of the Profession:  {{cite web|title=

Section 60 of the [[Bankruptcy and Diligence etc. (Scotland) Act 2007]] would have abolished the offices of messenger-at-arms and sheriff officer and replaced them by a new office of "judicial officer". Judicial officers would have held a commission from the [[Lord President of the Court of Session]] under section 57 of the Act, granted on the recommendation of a [[Scottish Civil Enforcement Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;Bankruptcy and Diligence etc. (Scotland) Act 2007:  {{cite web|title=Section 60 - Abolition of offices of messenger-at-arms and sheriff officer |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2007/3/part/3/crossheading/abolition-of-offices-of-messengeratarms-and-sheriff-officer |publisher=[[UK Statute Law Database]]| accessdate=2007-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However on 30 January 2008 the Scottish government announced as part of a package of public service reform that the Scottish Civil Enforcement Commission would not be established and that its functions would be discharged by existing organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Government/PublicServiceReform/simplifyingpublicservices/simplifyannexeB |title=Scottish Government website |publisher=Scotland.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The provisions of the 2007 Act were not brought into force, and are to be repealed by the [[Public Services Reform (Scotland) Act 2010]].&lt;ref&gt;Public Services Reform (Scotland) Act 2010, section 13 and Schedule 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010, the Scottish government issued a consultation on the designation of a professional organisation for officers of court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2010/11/officersofcourt |title=Scottish Government consultation |publisher=Scotland.gov.uk |date=2010-11-16 |accessdate=2013-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Modified Scheme of Elementary Education''' or '''New Scheme of Elementary Education''' or '''Madras Scheme of Elementary Education'''  dubbed by its critics as '''Kula Kalvi Thittam''' (Hereditary Education Policy), was an abortive attempt at education reform introduced by the [[Indian National Congress]] Government of the [[Madras State]], led by [[C. Rajagopalachari]] (Rajaji) in 1953. The scheme proposed the introduction of two shifts or sessions in elementary schools. In one session regular teaching would be done and during the second session, the students would be sent home to learn the occupations of their parents. It became controversial and was accused of being a casteist scheme to perpetuate the caste hierarchy as Hindu Professions were [[Varna (Hinduism)|caste based]].&lt;ref name="Vaasanthi2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Vaasanthi|title=Cut-outs, Caste and Cines Stars|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8ldacEfF58EC&amp;pg=PA144|accessdate=7 October 2015|year=2008|publisher=Penguin Books India|isbn=978-0-14-306312-4|pages=144–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Public opposition and internal dissent within the congress led to the deferment of the scheme. The discontent it triggered among the Congress legislature members forced the resignation of Rajaji as Chief Minister. The scheme was dropped completely by Rajaji's successor [[K. Kamaraj|Kamaraj]] in 1954.

==Background==
According to the 1951 Census of India, the literacy rate in the [[Madras State]] was 20.86%.&lt;ref&gt;Yazali, P.172&lt;/ref&gt; During fiscal year 1950-51, the Madras State Government spent 6.87 crore Rupees (6,870,000) - about 11.5% of total revenues for the state - for Elementary education. The enrollment rate for children of school-going age was around 47.8%.&lt;ref name=B&gt;[http://www.education.nic.in/cd50years/g/12/28/12280V01.htm Appendix Q : Modified Scheme of Elementary Education, Madras] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927150034/http://www.education.nic.in/cd50years/g/12/28/12280V01.htm |date=27 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Directive Principles in India|Directive Principles of the Indian Constitution]] require the Indian state to provide education to all citizens. In accordance to this directive, in 1950 the Madras State's Directorate of Public Instruction prepared a ten-year plan to provide education to all children of school-going age. This plan called for an allocation of one crore Rs (1,00,00,000) per year for enrolling 500,000 additional students for the next ten years. Against this, the actual allocation in 1950-51 was only Rs. 500,000. The cost of educating a student was estimated to be around Rs.22.80 per year, out of which the government's contribution was Rs.16.30.&lt;ref name="B"/&gt; Out of the 12,22,775 students who had enrolled in standard I in 1946-47, only 4,61,686 (37%) had reached the Standard V in 1950-51. It was against this background, the Congress party with [[Rajaji]] as chief minister took power on 10 April 1952.

The opposition to the scheme was largely based on social background. Hindu professions are based on [[Varna (Hinduism)|Varna or Caste]] with the [[Brahmins]] the highest in the order and studied while [[Kshatriya]] and [[Vaishya]] traders received some education. [[Shudra]] were denied education. [[Dalits]] were considered untouchables and did manual work and also denied education. When the [[Justice Party (India)|Justice Party]] came to power in 1920, Brahmins disproportionately occupied over 70% of the high level posts in government, judiciary and in education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://archive.tehelka.com/story_main17.asp?filename=Ne042206superiority.asp | title=Superiority in Numbers | publisher=Tehelka | accessdate=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Justice Party (India)|Justice Party]] introduced caste based reservation and this gradually reversed this trend and allowed non-Brahmins to rise in the government and education in [[Madras Presidency]].  The first generation of [[Dalits]], [[Scheduled Castes and Tribes]] and [[Backward Classes]] also started getting educated and their children had just begun to attend school after centuries of denial of educational opportunities under the rigid Hindu caste system. As per this policy schools were to work in the morning and students had to compulsorily learn the family vocation in the afternoon. This was seen as a ploy to ensure the domination and monopoly of Brahmins. The ulterior motive behind the scheme was understood to be that the children of non-Brahmins should undertake only the manual jobs of their ancestors such as washerman, barber, scavenger, cobbler etc. and they should not aspire for any higher education or for any white collar employment, which only Brahmins could claim as their exclusive privilege. They should follow their parents' professions and remain in their low status and lowly paid professions. Such a step would maintain caste hegemony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Kumaradoss  |first=Y. Vincent |title=

==Earlier attempts at change==
In 1939, during [[Rajaji]]'s first term as Chief Minister of the [[Madras Presidency]], the girl students of standards III to V and those belonging to Scheduled Castes had been allowed to attend school for only three hours a day and spend the rest of the day helping their parents. In the academic year 1949-50, during the Chief ministership of [[P. S. Kumaraswamy Raja]], an experimental shift system had been introduced in ten [[Tehsil|taluks]] and later expanded to other areas as an optional measure. Schools which adapted this system functioned in two shifts or sessions. Teachers who worked during both sessions were paid an additional allowance of 10 Rupees per month. However this system was not widely adopted and by 1951 only 155 elementary schools (out of a total 38,687) in the state were functioning in shifts.&lt;ref name=B/&gt;

==Reasons stated for the reform attempt==
* The cost of educating all children in the 6-12 age group would be enormous. Besides enrollment, more than half of the elementary schools lacked proper infrastructure. The reform attempted to increase the number of school-going children within the financial limitations faced by the Government.&lt;ref name=C&gt;[http://www.education.nic.in/cd50years/g/12/28/12281301.htm Appendix T : Modified Scheme of Elementary Education, Madras] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927150114/http://www.education.nic.in/cd50years/g/12/28/12281301.htm |date=27 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* There was an acute shortage of teachers. The state had an average of less than three teachers for five standards per school. There were 4,108 single-teacher schools and more than 60% of the schools with five standards had less than four teachers.&lt;ref name="B"/&gt;&lt;ref name="C"/&gt;
* This poor student-teacher ratio was putting a strain on the teachers and led to students being made to stay in school for longer hours. This directly contributed to the high drop out ratio. This plural teaching had to be stopped without hiring new teachers.&lt;ref name="B"/&gt;
* Rajaji favoured [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhi]]'s Basic Education Scheme over the existing elementary education system. He stated that he wanted to reduce the unemployment amongst educated people.&lt;ref name=D&gt;Bakshi, P.323&lt;/ref&gt; The Basic education system called for learning through living and training in self-reliance.&lt;ref name="B"/&gt;
* The retention rate of 37% (between 1947 and 1951) had to be improved by making schools attractive to students of poorer sections.&lt;ref name="B"/&gt;&lt;ref name="C"/&gt;

==Proposals in the new scheme==
The Modified Scheme of Elementary education proposed the following changes in the school system:&lt;ref name="B"/&gt;&lt;ref name="C"/&gt;

* Reduction of School hours from five hours per day to three.
* Introduction of shifts -the students were to be divided into two batches and the school would function in two sessions. Each session will be of three hours duration, consisting of four periods of 40 minutes each, with not less than two intervals totaling 20 minutes. The sessions will be arranged to suit local conditions. One batch will attend only one session a day. There were to be six working days per week.
* No dilution of the previous syllabus and no reduction in duration for subjects like Language, Elementary Mathematics, Nature Study, Drawing, History, Geography, Hygiene, Civics, Moral Instruction and Singing.
* The second session in which the students would be out of school was to be utilised for obtaining the objectives of the basic education system - learning through living and training in self-reliance.
* During the out of school session, the girl students were to learn house keeping from their mothers in their home environment. The boys were supposed to learn farming or other crafts from their respective fathers.
* Boys whose parents did not belong to occupational groups, were to be sent to work in farms or with other craftsmen in their villages.
* In addition to the learning the students were to be utilised in service to the village like ''building sheds,laying bricks, attending to village sanitation, improving roads, etc.''.
* The out of school session would have no strict attendance or work requirements.

==Implementation==
The Rajaji Government introduced the new elementary education scheme in all schools in the non-municipal (rural) areas for the academic year 1953-54 (from 18 June 1953). It was planned that eventually the scheme would be extended to 35,000 of the total 38,687 schools in the state. However, due to public opposition, it was put on hold on 29 July 1953 and dropped altogether on 18 May 1954.&lt;ref name=E&gt;[http://www.assembly.tn.gov.in/archive/resumes/review_01assly/ch14.pdf Chapter XIV, A Review of Madras Legislative Assembly(1952-57)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition==

From the beginning, the scheme attracted heavy opposition from the Dravidian movement led by [[Periyar E. V. Ramasamy]]. The [[Dravidar Kazhagam]] organised a conference in [[Erode]] protesting the scheme's introduction.&lt;ref name=I/&gt; The teachers' unions also opposed their move as they were not consulted before implementation. They also resented the increase in working hours without any increase in pay.&lt;ref name=Y/&gt; The [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam|DMK]] seized the opportunity and started a campaign against the scheme. They dubbed the scheme as the ''Kula kalvi thittam'' (Hereditary/Caste Education Scheme) and as the ''Acharyar Education Scheme''.&lt;ref&gt;Ryerson, P.89&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=F/&gt; The Dravidian movement viewed the scheme as an attempt to preserve and perpetuate caste based discrimination through official means. They used Rajaji's notions about caste and village craftsmen to depict the scheme as a "Brahminist conspiracy". Rajaji had earlier expressed his opinion about castes and crafts as:

{{cquote|The food is grown, the cloth is woven, the sheep are shorn, the shoes are stitched, the scavenging is done, the cartwheels and the ploughs are built and repaired because, thank God, the respective castes are still there and the homes are trade schools as well and the parents are masters as well, to whom the children are automatically apprenticed.&lt;ref&gt;Gandhi. p.245&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After the scheme was announced, Rajaji gave a speech to the washermen at the [[Adyar River|Adyar]] riverbank. In it he referred to ''Kuladharma'', the social obligation of each clan or caste. The opposition used such incidents to lend credence to their "casteist motive" accusation.&lt;ref&gt;Gandhi. p.248&lt;/ref&gt; Rajaji and his education minister [[Mandali Venkata Krishna Rao|MV Krishna Rao]] responded with a counter campaign in the scheme's defense. They gave speeches and made broadcasts in the All India Radio explaining their position.&lt;ref&gt;Indian Review Vol.54, P.332&lt;/ref&gt; The month of June 1953 saw aggressive propaganda efforts by both the proponents and opponents of the scheme. On 13 July 1953, the DMK executive committee met and decided to conduct a ''marial'' (blockade) agitation outside the Chief Minister's residence. [[E. V. K. Sampath|EVK Sampath]] was nominated to lead the agitation.&lt;ref name=F&gt;[http://www.sangam.org/2009/09/Anna_Centennial_3.php?print=true Anna's Birth Centennial Anthology]&lt;/ref&gt; This agitation was part of a three pronged attack on the Government's policies by the DMK. On 14 July 1953, a possession led by [[Satyavani Muthu]] was organised to protest the scheme. Its destination was Rajaji's official residence at Bazullah road, [[T. Nagar]]. It was stopped by the police as it was unlicensed.&lt;ref name=F/&gt; The next day (15 July 1953) the confrontation heated up with the Government introducing a motion in the Legislative Assembly for implementing the scheme from the academic year 1953-54. On the same day another DMK procession was stopped before it could reach T Nagar. In the next fifteen days as many as twenty such processions were attempted by the DMK.&lt;ref name=F/&gt;

==Deferment==
By the end of July, public opinion started to turn against the scheme and at least four public petitions were tabled in the Legislative Assembly about the scheme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assembly.tn.gov.in/archive/Resumes/review_01assly/table17.pdf Table XVII, A Review of Madras Legislative Assembly(1952-57)]&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 July 1953, M.V Krishna Rao, the minister for education moved a motion for considering the new scheme. After a discussion, [[Communist Party of India|Communist]] leader [[K. P Gopalan]] moved a motion to drop the scheme. The house was deadlocked with 138 ayes to 138 noes on dropping the scheme. The speaker of the assembly [[J. Shivashanmugam Pillai]] used his casting vote to defeat the motion. A second motion to defer the scheme and refer it to a committee of experts was moved by [[K. R. Viswanathan|K.R Viswanatham]]. This motion passed with 138 ayes against 137 noes.&lt;ref name=E/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assembly.tn.gov.in/archive/Resumes/review_01assly/table16.pdf Table XVI, A Review of Madras Legislative Assembly(1952-57)]&lt;/ref&gt; The Scheme was stayed&lt;ref&gt;The word "stay" in the motion was interpreted by Rajaji and C. Subramaniam as "keep the status quo" as on the day of the vote. In other words, the scheme would be kept in place in the schools where it was already introduced and it won't be extended to other schools. They disregarded the oppositions demands to cancel the scheme in all the schools. Gandhi. p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; and the Parulekar Committee was commissioned to review the scheme.

==Parulekar committee==
On 20 August 1953, the Government passed an order (Education G.O # 1888) to constitute a committee of experts for reviewing the scheme.&lt;ref name=H&gt;[http://www.education.nic.in/cd50years/g/t/HJ/0THJ0509.htm Report, Director of Information and Publicity]&lt;/ref&gt; The committee was composed of Prof. RV. Parulekar, Director of Indian Institute of Education Bombay, as the Chairman; Dr.B.B. Dey, Retired Director of Public Instruction, Madras; Prof. Mohammad Mujeeb, Vice-Chancellor of the [[Jamia Millia Islamia|Jamia Millia University]] as members and S. Govindarajulu Naidu, the former Director of Public Instruction, Madras, and the then Director of Public Instruction, [[Andhra Pradesh]], as the Member Secretary.&lt;ref name=C/&gt; The Parulekar committee submitted its report on 23 November 1953. It found the scheme to be sound and endorsed the Government's position. It made additional recommendations including extending the scheme to rural areas, opening as many as 4000 new schools, revising the existing curriculum, providing training and remuneration to the craftsmen involved.&lt;ref name=H/&gt;

==Cancellation==
The opposition campaign was successful in creating doubts about the scheme in the minds of the general public. There was dissent within the Congress party and [[K. Kamaraj|Kamaraj]] wanted Rajaji to withdraw the scheme as it was unpopular amongst the public and with the party members.&lt;ref name=Z&gt;Subramaniam, p.205&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 October 1953, forty Congress Legislative Assembly members led by [[P. Varadarajulu Naidu]], sent a memorandum to Nehru objecting to Rajaji's unilateral conduct. Among the issues they raised was his refusal to budge on the education scheme issue.&lt;ref&gt;Nehru Vol24, p.288&lt;/ref&gt; But Rajaji refused to drop the scheme. On 8 November 1953, Congress lost the by election for the [[Kangayam (State Assembly Constituency)|Kangayam constituency]] by a narrow margin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eci.nic.in/eci_main/ByeElection/Bye-ele-results%2052-95.xls|title=By election results 1952-1995|work=Election Commission of India|accessdate=10 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gazette of India, p.88&lt;/ref&gt; Pressure mounted from within the party to drop the scheme. On 9 March 1954, Congress leader and former Chief Minister [[O. P. Ramaswamy Reddiyar]] made an open appeal to Rajaji in the legislature:

{{Cquote|Please give up the scheme without any more ado. It is a new handle to the Blackshirts [Dravidar Kazhagam]. Persistence will sound only the death knell of the party.&lt;ref name=gandhi251&gt;Gandhi. pp.250-251&lt;/ref&gt;}}

But Rajaji did not relent and his education minister [[Chidambaram Subramaniam|C Subramaniam]] upped the ante by announcing that the scheme would be extended to urban areas in June 1954. This spurred the Congress legislators into open revolt. They scheduled a meeting of the Congress Legislative Party on 21 March. Faced with certain defeat in the leadership election that was bound to happen in that meeting, Rajaji tried a last minute compromise - he would quit if C. Subramaniam was chosen as his successor and the scheme was kept. But Kamaraj, the leader of the anti-Rajaji camp, refused to accept the deal.&lt;ref name=gandhi251/&gt; The meeting was postponed by a week and when it happened on March 31, C. Subramaniam was defeated by Kamaraj.&lt;ref&gt;Kandaswamy, p51-52&lt;/ref&gt; Rajaji resigned and Kamaraj took over as chief minister on 13 April 1954. This effectively ended the prospects of the new education scheme. On 18 May 1954, C Subramaniam announced in the assembly that the scheme was being dropped. The reason stated for the dropping was ''that the necessary acceptance, support and cooperation of the people were not forthcoming for the scheme and the atmosphere was not propitious for the success of the scheme''.&lt;ref name=A&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2004/05/19/stories/2004051900240903.htm The Hindu report on 19 May 1954 : Scheme dropped]&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the composite Madras State had been reorganised along linguistic lines. The state of [[Andhra Pradesh|Andhra]] had split from Madras on 1 October 1953. The Andhra Government constituted an Elementary Education Committee with Dr. B. Kuppuswamy as chairman to review the elementary education situation. The Kuppuswamy committee report recommended the rejection of the Modified Elementary Education Scheme. In 1954 the Andhra state cancelled the scheme.&lt;ref name=X&gt;Indian Review Vol.55, p.284&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

The main arguments made against the Modified Scheme of Elementary Education were :
*That the scheme was casteist by design. It aimed to preserve and perpetuate the caste hierarchy by ensuring that children took up their parents' profession. It was designed to help Brahmins corner positions of authority .&lt;ref name=I&gt;Vasantha Kandaswamy p.262-6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=F/&gt;
*That it intended to reduce the schooling imparted to children by not monitoring them during out of school sessions.&lt;ref&gt;Bakshi, p.325&lt;/ref&gt;
*That it would increase the workload of teachers as it would increase their working hours and force them to handle more children without the appointment of new teachers and without an increase in their pay.&lt;ref name=Y&gt;Balratnam, P.91&lt;/ref&gt;
*That it was undemocratic and dictatorial as Rajaji had not consulted his cabinet or the assembly in his decision to implement the scheme (In Rajaji's own words - ''This is an executive matter, no law is involved'' and'' Did [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]] and [[Ramanuja]] announce their philosophy after consulting others''?).&lt;ref name=Y/&gt;&lt;ref name=F/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kannan p.203&lt;/ref&gt;
*That it was deliberately targeted at rural children alone to keep them from getting an education.&lt;ref&gt;Vashisht, p.52&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in ''Viduthalai'' on 17 November 1953, [[Periyar E. V. Ramasamy|Periyar]] denounced the scheme as a Brahiminical conspiracy:

{{Cquote|This educational policy is a casteist educational policy. This has to be opposed and abolished...Is this educational scheme not a reconstruction and protection of varnashrama?...who physically labours and slaves in the name of caste? Only we, who are called sudras...should we keep doing the caste occupation while brahmins alone get positions,employment, authority and go higher and higher?...is this justified?..we don't think physical labour is disgraceful, but why should we alone do that work?....

...How much of opposition to Rajaji’s minister post? Though the situation is such that his post can topple any day. If he can manage all that and still have a tight grip, what is it for? Only to save his race, only for the protection of the Brahmin society. As long as he is in power, he wants to fill up Brahmins in all the places. He wants to repress the Sudras, and with that motive alone he remains in power. Among us we do not have this mind, this feeling, this racial fanaticism! He fights for the welfare of the Brahmin race...&lt;ref name="I"/&gt;}}

In another ''Viduthalai'' article written on 26 February 1954, he vowed to destroy the scheme by any means:

{{Cquote|Rajaji says that people in the villages do not need education.He has said that the student in the village should cut hair, he should wash clothes, and he should make pots and pans. The village school is only for three hours duration, the rest of the time our children should graze donkeys, this is called the New Primary Education Scheme. We organized a conference in Erode only to oppose this educational scheme. Can we keep looking at law and democracy in such a situation? The work will be successful only through a great revolution. Though 100, 1000 of us will have to be sacrificed, we need to be prepared. That is why even I gave a three months notice; and said that if they want to shoot, let them shoot. I am going to start a struggle. This educational scheme has to be destroyed by all means.&lt;ref name="I"/&gt;}}

He kept up his harangue even after Rajaji resigned and C Subramaniam became the new Education minister. On 17 April 1954 he wrote:

{{Cquote|Rajaji did this only because of the fear that the position of his society will disappear. If the Vanaan washes clothes, if the Paraiyan beats the drums, if the Chakkili stitches shoes, if the Ambattan shaves, only then they will get the feeling that they are a low caste. If they also get educated and come ahead, the highness of the upper castes will disappear. So, Rajaji interfered in the basics by introducing a 3-hour occupational education...

...The servant of this Rajaji, C. Subramanian was the one who raised his hand to say that Sudras don’t need communal representation. Those who had gone on the merit of our votes were sitting there like the five Pandavas during Draupadi’s disrobing. All this takes place in this country. If it had been another country, four or five (death) anniversaries would have been observed for such people. When it is so, how can we fight legally?&lt;ref name="I"/&gt;}}

The Andhra Elementary Education Committee Report also rejected the Modified Scheme and recommended an approach similar to the one eventually adopted by the Kamaraj Government.&lt;ref name=X/&gt;

==Defense and endorsements==
During and after his tenure as Chief Minister, Rajaji defended his scheme vigorously. He derided the critics as people who did not want to do physical labour:

{{Cquote| The opposition to the scheme comes mainly from those who do not want to do any physical labour. There are others who ask whether there will be any examination in the crafts. That may come or may not come. But I would like you to ponder over one factor. Are not the children of parents with an educational tradition at an advantage now over children whose parents have no education at all? Should an examination in crafts be held, will not the children of illiterate artisans score over the other class of children? In that way will not the handicap of the poor man's children be removed? The new system gives a chance to the backward people to progress. I would, therefore, appeal to you all to support the scheme or at least desist from opposing it.&lt;ref name="J"&gt;Rajagopalachari, P.115&lt;/ref&gt;}}

About the casteist angle of the criticism, he reasoned that it was because of him being the author of the scheme:

{{Cquote| It is indeed regrettable that it should be said that there is a big conspiracy behind the new scheme. Probably because i am its author, some people suspect there is something behind it..If some other person would have done it, by God's grace, everyone might have accepted it and the scheme might have worked successfully...I made similar suggestions over 30 years ago.&lt;ref name="D"/&gt;}}

After the Kamaraj Government scrapped the scheme, he again defended it as :

{{Cquote| My plan was based on the conviction - which was confirmed by educational officers of highest rank and experience - that three hours attendance was quite adequate for the purpose and would leave nothing out of the present elementary school instruction.&lt;ref name="K"&gt;Bakshi, P. 168&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Replying to [[Papanasam (State Assembly Constituency)|Papanasam]] MLA Swayam Prakasam's concerns over the scheme, then Prime Minister, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] offered his endorsement to the scheme:

{{Cquote| As for the education policy which Rajaji has sponsored, I cannot speak for conditions in Madras. But that policy is an aspect of Basic Education which is the proved policy of our Government. The Madras proposals, as you know, were referred to a special High-powered Committee of Educationists. They expressed their approval of them. ...At the Governors' Conference recently, the Madras proposals were not directly discussed, but the present system was discussed and thoroughly disapproved of and generally the basic system was approved.&lt;ref&gt;Nehru Vol25, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt;}}

India's President [[Rajendra Prasad]] offered his support in a letter written to the Governor of Madras - [[Sri Prakasa]] - on 9 June 1953:

{{Cquote| I have read with great interest both the speech of Rajaji and the scheme of education in primary schools in rural areas. I have felt great dissatisfaction with the present scheme of things so far as education is concerned... with the large number of graduates and under graduates we are turning out from year to year are without any employment...most of them are unemployable...

This scheme fits them at any rate for their parents' work or for the work people have been doing in their own place. With education it may be hoped that they would be able to do that work better. I there look forward with great hope and enthusiasm to this experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Rajendra Prasad, P. 72&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Central Advisory Board of Education, passed a resolution endorsing the scheme during its 21st Meeting held in February 1954:

{{Cquote|  "The Central Advisory Board of Education has given careful consideration to the Modified Scheme of Elementary Education formulated by the Madras Government. It is of the opinion that the Scheme represents a welcome attempt to bring education within the reach of a large majority of children and thus help in the achievement of the constitutional directive about the provision of universal Primary Education. The Board is also satisfied that the reduction of school hours from five to three will not necessarily affect the education of children adversely, provided the out-of-school activities which are an integral part of the education of children are implemented under controlled conditions. The Board also appreciates the attempt made in the Scheme for bringing education into closer contact with the life of the community and this gives it a practical bias which is at present lacking in ordinary Primary Schools.

The Board would, however, like to point out that the arrangements made for the out-of-school activities of the children need to be carefully supervised on the lines suggested by the Parulekar Committee and their success critically assessed from time to time. Further, the Board would like to place on record its definite opinion that this Scheme is valuable as an interim measure only, because, sufficient funds are not at present available for providing education to all the children and that the proper pattern of education for the country is Basic Education which would offer full-time co-related education to children in which teaching of craft as well as of other school subjects will be provided under proper educative conditions in the school itself, which will serve as a community centre where the school and the community are brought into an organic relationship.

The Board would also recommend that other States may conduct similar experiments under controlled conditions. (The Madras Government have since intimated their decision to discontinue their modified scheme of Elementary Education)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.education.nic.in/cd50years/g/12/28/12280202.htm Central Advisory Board of Education - Proceedings of the 21st Meeting, Item IV]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Legacy==
The Modified Scheme of Elementary Education even after being dropped had the unintended consequence of bringing primary education to hundreds of thousands of school children in [[Tamil Nadu]]. Rajaji's successor Kamaraj was ever mindful of the fact that it was the issue of primary education that caused his predecessor's downfall. Knowing the public opposition to Rajaji's scheme he took the diametrically opposite approach in providing education to Tamil Nadu's children - imparting free and compulsory education till the age of 14. He set up a commission&lt;ref name="L"&gt;Kandaswamy, P. 65&lt;/ref&gt; under R.M. Alagappa Chettiar to examine the means for providing compulsory primary education. Instead of sending children away from the school, the committee recommended active Government intervention to bring more children into the schooling system by building new schools and abolishing school fees.&lt;ref name=H/&gt; This approach was successful and by the end of Kamaraj's tenure as Chief Minister in 1963, enrollment in primary schools had been doubled.&lt;ref name="L"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24384">This article discusses the [[nationality]] of the composer [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] (1756–1791).

The two main labels that have been used to describe '''Mozart's nationality''' are "Austrian" and "German".&lt;ref&gt;For details and citation, see section "Scholarly practice", below.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in Mozart's own time, these terms were used differently from the way they are used today, because the modern [[nation state]]s of [[Austria]] and [[Germany]] did not yet exist.&lt;ref&gt;See discussion and references below. Modern Austria came into being in 1918; Germany in 1871.&lt;/ref&gt; Any decision to label Mozart as "Austrian" or "German" (or neither) involves political boundaries, history, language, culture, and Mozart's own views. Editors of modern encyclopedias and other reference sources differ in how they assign a label to Mozart (if any) in light of conflicting criteria.

==Salzburg==
[[File:Archbishopric of Salzburg, c. 1715.jpg|right|thumb|A 1715 map showing (in purple) the Archbishopric of Salzburg. Click to enlarge.]]
[[File:Sigismund von Schrattenbach prince archbishop of Salzburg.jpg|thumb|[[Sigismund von Schrattenbach]] was the ruling archbishop at Salzburg when Mozart was born and during his youth. He was a generous patron of the Mozart family.]]
Mozart was born in [[Salzburg]],&lt;ref&gt;Abert (2007, 1)&lt;/ref&gt; the capital of a small, essentially sovereign&lt;ref&gt;For discussion of the independence of Salzburg see Beales (2006a, 31) and below.&lt;/ref&gt; state called the [[Archbishopric of Salzburg]].&lt;ref&gt;Sadie (2006, 3–4)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus in one sense Mozart's nationality could be said to be "Salzburgian",&lt;ref&gt;In French, "salzbourgeois" was, and still is, fairly common. The German equivalent is quite common.&lt;/ref&gt; though English-language biographers do not generally use this term to designate his nationality.&lt;ref&gt;No sources consulted in preparing "Scholarly practice" (section below) employed this term.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mozart scholar [[Otto Erich Deutsch]] suggested that Mozart was actually not a citizen of Salzburg, but of [[Augsburg]]. Discussing Mozart's baptismal record, he writes that Mozart's father [[Leopold Mozart|Leopold]], born and raised in Augsburg ({{ill|Mozarthaus Augsburg|de}}), "remained a citizen of that town, so that [[Maria Anna Mozart|Nannerl]] and Wolfgang, though born at Salzburg, were actually Augsburg citizens" (Deutsch 1965, 9). At the time Augsburg was, like Salzburg, a small independent state; i.e. a [[Free imperial city]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Holy Roman Empire==
The Archbishopric of Salzburg was but one of more than 300 similarly independent states in the part of Europe that was populated by German speakers.&lt;ref name="Beales199"&gt;Beales (2006b, 199)&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these states, Salzburg included, were included in a larger political entity, the [[Holy Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Beales (2006a, 33)&lt;/ref&gt; The Holy Roman Empire was German in various ways: most of its population was German-speaking,&lt;ref&gt;For the exceptions see Beales (2006b, 200).&lt;/ref&gt; its official full name was the "Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation" (German: ''Heiliges Römisches Reich Deutscher Nation''),&lt;ref name="Beales199" /&gt; it conducted most of its business in German,&lt;ref name="Beales199" /&gt; and one of the titles held by its emperor was "King in Germany."&lt;ref&gt;Beales (2006b, 200)&lt;/ref&gt; Beales adds, "[the emperor] and the Empire were foci of German patriotism. Even in [[Hamburg]], Protestant and remote from his court [in Vienna], prayers were regularly said for him and his birthday was celebrated."&lt;ref&gt;Beales (2006b, 200). The Habsburgs, who generally served as emperor (see below) and most of their lands they ruled were Roman Catholic.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, although the Holy Roman Empire was largely German, it was hardly a nation state, but only a very loose confederation, the feeble residue of an empire that had been robust centuries earlier.&lt;ref&gt;The history of the empire and its centuries of decline are related in detail in the article "Germany", ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 1988 edition, vol 20, pp. 47–79.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', the princes whose states comprised the empire "legislated at will, levied taxes, concluded alliances, and waged wars against each other&amp;nbsp;... The imperial [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Diet]] meeting in [[Regensburg]] had degenerated into a debating society without authority or influence. The splendid [imperial] coronation ceremony in [[Frankfurt am Main]] could not disguise the fact that the office conferred on its holder little more than prestige."&lt;ref&gt;"Germany", ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 1988 edition, vol 20, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, although the phrase "Mozart was German" can be given a ''cultural'' interpretation (see below), it cannot be taken to mean that Mozart was a citizen of Germany. During his time, there was no German nation-state that he could have been a citizen of.

==Austria==
According to [[Derek Beales|Beales]] (2006a, 30–31), in Mozart's time the word "Austria" (German: ''Österreich'') had several meanings.

The original Austria was the [[Archduchy of Austria]], a rather small state centered around [[Vienna]], roughly coextensive with the modern Austrian states of [[Upper Austria]] and [[Lower Austria]].&lt;ref name="Beales30"&gt;Beales (2006a, 30)&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1282 this core area was ruled by the [[Habsburg]] dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 1988 edition, "Habsburg", p. 515&lt;/ref&gt; Over the centuries, the Habsburgs accreted ever more lands to their holdings, both inside and outside the Holy Roman Empire, and both German and non-German speaking.&lt;ref&gt;Beales (2006a, 30–31) enumerates the Habsburg lands thus: "the present-day Austrian republic (except the province of Salzburg); [[Bohemia]] (including [[Moravia]]), now the [[Czech Republic]]; greater [[Hungary]] (which embraced, as well a modern Hungary, [[Slovakia]], [[Croatia]] and the south-western tip of modern [[Ukraine]]); [[Transylvania]] and the [[banat of Temesvar]] (both for a time treated as part of Hungary and now mostly part of [[Romania]]); the duchy of [[Carniola]] (now [[Slovenia]]n); [[south Tyrol]], much of [[Lombardy]] and certain other lands now withint [[Italy]]; small and scattered possessions in southern Germany; the '[[Austrian Netherlands]]' (that is [[Luxembourg|Luxemburg]] and the greater part of modern [[Belgium]]); [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] after 1772 (now divided between [[Poland]] and Ukraine) and, after 1775, the [[Bukovina]] (now divided between Romania and Ukraine)."&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this expansion, the Habsburg dynasty retained an Austrian identity, maintaining their capital in Vienna and referring to their aggregated lands as "the Austrian Monarchy".&lt;ref name="Beales30" /&gt; The word "Austria" was sometimes used as an informal cover term for all of the lands ruled by the Habsburgs.&lt;ref name="Beales30" /&gt;
The power of the Habsburgs was such that they came to dominate the emperorship of the Holy Roman Empire:&lt;ref name="Brit517" &gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 1988 edition, "Habsburg", p. 517&lt;/ref&gt; starting in 1452,&lt;ref name="Brit517" /&gt; the "Electors" (the handful of princes who held the right to elect the next emperor) virtually always chose the Habsburg monarch for the emperorship whenever the office became vacant.&lt;ref&gt;Beales (2006a, 32). A three-year exception occurred when [[Maria Theresa]] inherited the Habsburg titles but—as a woman—could not legally serve as Emperor. During the crisis of the [[War of Austrian Succession]], the emperorship was voted (1742) to her enemy [[Charles VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles Albert]] of Bavaria. Following the revival of Habsburg fortunes and the death of Charles Albert (1745), the emperorship became Habsburg property again with [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]]; see main text.&lt;/ref&gt; The emperors who served in Mozart's time were [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], and [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]].&lt;ref name="Beales 32"&gt;Beales (2006a, 32)&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, the latter two were Habsburg descendants; Francis I was the husband of the Habsburg ruler [[Maria Theresa]], who held the emperorship on her behalf since as a woman she could not legally serve.&lt;ref name="Beales 32" /&gt;

For administrative purposes, the Holy Roman Empire was divided into "[[Imperial Circle|circles]]".&lt;ref name="Beales30" /&gt; The [[Austrian Circle]] included the original Archduchy of Austria, as well as a number of other areas now part of modern Austria.&lt;ref name="Beales30" /&gt; Salzburg was not included; it was part of the [[Bavarian Circle]].&lt;ref name="Beales30" /&gt;

In sum, "Austria" in Mozart's time could mean (in increasing order of size), the Archduchy of Austria, the Austrian Circle, and the Habsburg-ruled lands. None of these included Salzburg.

Although Mozart was not born in Austria (as then defined), he had close connections there. He made three extended visits to Vienna in his youth,&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch (1965) gives the following dates: September–December 1762, September 1767-January 1769, July–September 1773.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1781 moved to Vienna to pursue his career; he remained there to the end of his life (1791).&lt;ref&gt;Branscombe (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maps==
The map below (click twice to enlarge) portrays the Holy Roman Empire as of 1789, surrounded by a red dashed line. The Prince-Archbishopric of Salzburg, shaped somewhat like a thick inverted capital T, is shown in lavender in the southern portion of the map, sandwiched between the extensive Habsburg territories (shown in orange-brown) and [[Bavaria]] (pale green).&lt;ref&gt;The perils that Salzburg faced as a small buffer state between two larger neighbors are discussed in Heartz (1995, 485–487)&lt;/ref&gt; The great number of small independent states that are now mostly part of Germany can also be seen. The extensive territories ruled by the Habsburgs but outside of the Holy Roman Empire are not indicated on the map.

==Later developments==
The political situation that prevailed in Mozart's lifetime did not long endure, with radical changes resulting from the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Holy Roman Emperor [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]] first decreed (1804) a new [[Austrian Empire]], consisting solely of the lands ruled directly by the Habsburgs.&lt;ref name="Beales 32" /&gt; Two years later (1806), he allowed the Holy Roman Empire to lapse, ending its centuries-long existence.&lt;ref name="Beales 32" /&gt;

[[Image:Hieronymus Graf von Colloredo 01.jpg|right|thumb|[[Hieronymus von Colloredo]], the last archbishop to exercise temporal power in Salzburg]]
The wars also had drastic consequences for Salzburg. In 1800 it was occupied by Napoleon's troops; the reigning prince-archbishop [[Count Hieronymus von Colloredo|Hieronymus von Colloredo]] (Mozart's old employer) had to flee.&lt;ref&gt;Halliwell (2006, 99)&lt;/ref&gt; He never again exercised political rule, though he retained his ecclesiastical title.&lt;ref&gt;Clive (1993, 40)&lt;/ref&gt; In the negotiated settlements that followed, Salzburg was first made into an independent secular state (the [[Electorate of Salzburg]], 1803),&lt;ref&gt;Halliwell (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; then unified with the Austrian Empire (1805),&lt;ref&gt;By the [[Peace of Pressburg (1805)|Peace of Pressburg]]; Roman (2009, 541)&lt;/ref&gt; then awarded to Bavaria (1809),&lt;ref&gt;By the [[Treaty of Schönbrunn|Treaty of Vienna]]; Leger (1889, 647)&lt;/ref&gt; and finally returned again to the Austrian Empire (1816).&lt;ref&gt;By the Treaty of Munich; Leger (1889, 647)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Austrian Empire underwent further political evolution, ultimately disintegrating in 1918 at the end of the First World War, at which time the small residual nation of [[Austria]]—including the old territory of Salzburg—was created.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 1988 edition, article "Austria", p. 516.&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Germany" as cultural concept==
As noted above, there was no country called "Germany" in Mozart's day; rather, there were hundreds of independent or quasi-independent German-speaking states. Of these, [[Prussia]] (blue on the map) was already on the rise, expanding its territory, and it was under Prussian leadership that Germany was ultimately [[Unification of Germany|unified in 1871]].&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 1988 edition, article "Germany", p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; It was only as of that year that one could speak of a German nation-state.

However, the word "German" (in German: "deutsch") was in use well before this time, designating the people of central Europe who shared German language and culture.&lt;ref&gt;For extended discussion on this point see Beales (2006b).&lt;/ref&gt; To give an example, when in 1801 Mozart's old colleague [[Emanuel Schikaneder]] opened the [[Theater an der Wien]] in Vienna, a Leipzig music journal praised the new theater as "the "most comfortable and satisfactory in the whole of Germany".&lt;ref&gt;The journal was the ''[[Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung]]''; quotation from Honolka (1990, 187).&lt;/ref&gt; The city of Salzburg, owing to its fine ecclesiastical architecture, was sometimes called "the German Rome".&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 1988 edition, "Salzburg"&lt;/ref&gt;

Mozart himself used the word "German" in this sense, and apparently felt a sense of national or ethnic pride in being German. The following passage, from a letter to his father [[Leopold Mozart|Leopold]], attests to this:

{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;I believe I am capable of bringing honor to any court—and if Germany, my beloved Fatherland, of which, as you know, I am proud, will not take me up—well, let France or England, in God's name become the richer by another talented German—and that to the disgrace of the German nation!&lt;ref&gt;Letter of 17 August 1782, quoted from Mersman (1972). The original reads: "Ich glaube so viel im Stande zu seyn, daß ich jedem Hofe Ehre machen werde. Will mich Teutschland, mein geliebtes Vaterland, worauf ich (wie Sie wissen) stolz bin, nicht aufnehmen, so muß in Gottes Namen Frankreich oder England wieder um einen geschickten Teutschen mehr reich werden,&amp;nbsp;– und das zur Schande der teutschen Nation." (taken from Hermann Abert's Mozart biography, available on line in German ([http://www.zeno.org/Musik/M/Abert,+Hermann/W.A.+Mozart.+Neubearbeitete+und+erweiterte+Ausgabe+von+Otto+Jahns+Mozart/Erster+Teil/Verlobung,+Braut-+und+Ehestand])&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A series of similar recorded utterances from Mozart is given by Kerst (1906).&lt;ref&gt;Kerst (1906, [https://archive.org/details/mozartmanartista00mozauoft/page/68 pp. 69–74])&lt;/ref&gt; From this evidence, it is clear that Mozart considered himself to be German.&lt;ref&gt;Rushton (2006, 2), Beales (2006b, 200)&lt;/ref&gt; However, for the reasons just given, the relevant sense is necessarily a linguistic or cultural one, there being no country of "Germany" of which Mozart could have been a citizen. Roselli (1998, 10) asserts that "Mozart was born into a part of Europe where nationality in the modern sense did not exist."

==Summary==
As can be seen, evidence is available to support a variety of opinions about Mozart's nationality. Thus, he was Austrian because the town in which he was born and raised is now in Austria, and because he made his career in Vienna, the Austrian capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.f1db.com/forums/showpost.php?p=242635&amp;postcount=1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130410191003/http://www.f1db.com/forums/showpost.php?p=242635&amp;postcount=1 |archivedate=2013-04-10 |df= }}, [http://www.emersonkent.com/history_notes/wolfgang_amadeus_mozart.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; He was German because he felt himself to be German, and because the residual and moribund empire that included Salzburg was labeled as and felt to be German.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/11/opinion/l-letter-on-mozart-a-german-not-austrian-composer-878092.html], [http://www.zaped.info/Talk:Germany/Archive_11] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107141736/http://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/11/opinion/l-letter-on-mozart-a-german-not-austrian-composer-878092.html |date=November 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was neither Austrian nor German because Salzburg was independent, neither part of the Habsburg Austrian possessions nor part of a (yet to exist) German nation-state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.audioasylum.com/audio/music/messages/11/116323.html], [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3131333.stm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarly practice==
The scholars who prepare biographies and reference works have made varying choices in assigning Mozart a nationality.

The widely consulted ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' calls Mozart an Austrian composer,&lt;ref&gt;Cited from the [[Grove Music Online]] edition of this work&lt;/ref&gt; as do the ''Houghton Mifflin Dictionary of Biography'' (2003), the ''Oxford Concise Dictionary of Music'' (Bourne and Kennedy 2004) and the ''NPR Listener's Encyclopedia of Classical Music'' (Libbey 2006). The practice of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''&lt;ref&gt;Discussion here refers to the 1988 edition.&lt;/ref&gt; is split: the brief anonymous summary ("Micropedia") article calls him Austrian, but the main article ("Macropedia"), written by [[H. C. Robbins Landon]], makes no mention of a nationality.

Sources describing Mozart as German are more abundant in earlier work, particularly before the founding of the modern nation-state of Austria in 1918. A London newspaper, reporting the composer's death in 1791, referred to him as "the celebrated German composer".&lt;ref&gt;Eisen (2007) (introduction to Niemetschek 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; In Lieber et al. (1832, 78), Mozart is introduced as "the great German composer"; Ferris (1891) included Mozart in a book called ''The Great German Composers''. Other descriptions of Mozart as German appear in Kerst (1906, 3), Mathews and Liebling (1896), and MacKey and Haywood (1909); also (much later) Hermand and Steakley (1981).

Sources sometimes have changed their practice over time. The Grove dictionary did not always call Mozart "Austrian"; the designation appears to have added with the first edition of the "New Grove" in 1980. Similarly, ''[[Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Musicians]]'' did not originally offer a nationality but added the word "Austrian" to its opening sentence for the 8th edition (1992) and has retained it since.&lt;ref&gt;Slonimsky (1984, 1992) and Kuhn (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', now an "Austrian" source, long ago listed Mozart as a German composer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart In the famous 11th edition (1910–11); available on line at] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123081729/http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart |date=2013-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Branscombe]]'s brief biography (2006, 304) begins with the description "composer and keyboard player"—in an encyclopedia that otherwise always specifies the nationality of composers, suggesting the omission of nationality may have been deliberate. Other authors who say nothing about Mozart's nationality (whether deliberately or not) are [[Hermann Abert]],&lt;ref&gt;Abert (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maynard Solomon]],&lt;ref&gt;Solomon (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; and Robbins Landon, mentioned above; and among encyclopedias the ''Riemann Musik Lexicon'' (1961), and the ''International Cyclopedia of Music and Musicians'' (1985). The prestigious German music encyclopedia ''[[Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart]]'' lists no nationality, but this follows the policy it applies to all composers.

Some sources mention both nationalities: the ''Brockhaus Riemann Musik Lexikon'' (1975) begins its article "composer, on the father's side of Augsburg-south German ancestry; on the mother's side Salzburg-Austrian".&lt;ref&gt;Original German "Komponist, vom Vater her augsburgisch-süddeutscher, von der Mutter her salzburgisch-östr. Abstammung".&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julian Rushton]], in his Mozart biography, summarizes many of the facts given above and concludes: "Mozart, by modern criteria Austrian, counted himself a German composer."&lt;ref&gt;Rushton (2006, 2)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''No-fault divorce''' is a [[divorce]] in which the dissolution of a marriage does not require a showing of wrongdoing by either party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/n/no-fault-divorce/|title=No Fault Divorce Law &amp; Legal Definition|work=uslegal.com|accessdate=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wex"&gt;{{cite web|title=No-fault divorce|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/no-fault_divorce|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell University Law School|accessdate=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laws providing for no-fault divorce allow a [[family court]] to grant a divorce in response to a petition by either party of the marriage without requiring the [[petitioner]] to provide evidence that the [[defendant]] has committed a breach of the marital contract.

==History==
The first modern no-fault divorce law was enacted in [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russia]] in December 1917 following the [[October Revolution]] of the same year. Regarding marriage as a bourgeois institution, the new government transferred divorce jurisdiction from the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] to the state courts, which could grant it on application of either spouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schachner |first=Jill |url=http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/and_then_there_was_none/ |title=And Then There Was None |publisher=Abajournal.com |date=2010-11-01 |accessdate=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Atlantic"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1926/07/the-russian-effort-to-abolish-marriage/306295/ |title=The Russian Effort to Abolish Marriage |publisher=The Atlantic |date=July 1926 |accessdate=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new family code was passed in 1926.&lt;ref name="Atlantic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bolas"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bolas|first1=Donald M.|title=No-Fault Divorce: Born in the Soviet Union?|journal=J.

With a law adopted in 1969, California became the first U.S. state to permit no-fault divorce.&lt;ref name=Kay&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/facpubs/1220/ |title=Equality and Difference: A Perspective on No-Fault Divorce and Its Aftermath |first=Herma Hill |last=Kay |volume=56 |number=1 |year=1987 |journal=University of Cincinnati Law Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;  California's law was framed on a roughly contemporaneous effort of the non-governmental organization [[National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws]], which began drafting a model of no-fault divorce statute for states to consider in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;''A Reminiscence About The Uniform Marriage and Divorce Act-and Some Reflections About Its Critics and Its Policies'', Robert J. Levy, 44 BYU L. Rev. 43 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Australia]] established no-fault divorce in 1975, with the only ground for divorce being irretrievable breakdown of marriage, evidenced by a twelve-month separation. [[Canada]] effectively permitted no-fault divorce in 1986 by reducing the separation period to one year.

==Controversy==

===Arguments for no-fault divorce===
Several studies have looked at the effect of no-fault divorce on divorce rates in the United States. The studies typically find an increase in the short-term rate, but little long-term causal relationship. The most frequent explanation given is that the older laws were ineffective and not followed anyway, though there are some differing viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Katz|first1=Sanford N.|title=Historical Perspective and Current Trends in the Legal Process of Divorce|journal=Children and Divorce|date=1994|volume=4|issue=1|url=https://www.princeton.edu/futureofchildren/publications/journals/article/index.xml?journalid=63&amp;articleid=410&amp;sectionid=2795}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KatzEekelaar2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sanford N.

[[Stephanie Coontz]], a professor of history at [[Evergreen State College]], states that "in the years since no-fault divorce became well-nigh universal, the national divorce rate has fallen, from about 23 divorces per 1,000 married couples in 1979 to under 17 per 1,000 in 2005."&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt; She adds that "once you permit the courts to determine when a person's desire to leave is legitimate, you open the way to arbitrary decisions about what is or should be tolerable in a relationship, made by people who have no stake in the actual lives being lived."&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;

A 2010 ''[[New York Times]]'' editorial said that New York was "the only state where a court must find fault before granting a divorce unless the spouses have lived apart for a full year under a formal separation agreement — a proven formula for inviting false testimony, endless litigation and generally making divorce far more painful than it needs to be."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/19/opinion/19sat4.html | work=The New York Times | title=New York's Moment for Divorce Reform | date=2010-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, New York became the final state to allow no-fault divorce. Lawyer L.M. Fenton states that "Feminist holdouts against New York's new [no-fault divorce] bill don't understand how family law affects women today", adding: "It also mystifies me that spouses could still, even in 2010, be forced to stay married to someone who refused to let go."&lt;ref name="salon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/life/broadsheet/2010/06/17/no_fault_divorce_new_york_open2010|title=No-fault divorce? It's about time|date=18 June 2010|work=salon.com|accessdate=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She adds:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Fault-based grounds usually include mental cruelty, but true mental cruelty has a psychological component that can make it very difficult for the abused spouse to articulate that abuse. More to the point, the abused spouse may be terrified to describe the relationship on paper and testify about it in a court. And of course, a controlling partner will always choose the path of most resistance to whatever it is that the other spouse wants.&lt;ref name="salon" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The state adopted no-fault divorce later that year.

===Arguments against no-fault divorce===

The [[National Organization for Women]] opposed the introduction of no-fault divorce in New York State because it would allow a party who actually is at fault to obtain a divorce in which "alimony, maintenance [and] property division" would be determined without the judge considering "the facts, behavior and circumstances that led to the break-up of the marriage".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nownys.org/leg_memos_2010/no_fault_divorce.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A paper published in the ''[[Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy]]'', written by Douglas Allen, on the economics of same-sex marriage, argues that the introduction of no-fault divorce led to a six-fold increase in just two years, after a century of rather stable divorce rates. Also, the law increased the rate at which women entered the workforce, increased the number of hours worked in a week, increased the [[feminization of poverty]], and increased the age at which people married.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Allen |first=Douglas |title=An economic assessment of same-sex marriage laws |journal=Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Public Policy |date=22 June 2006 |volume=29 |url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/jlpp/Vol29_No3_Allen.pdf |accessdate=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephen Baskerville]], a political scientist at [[Howard University]], argues that no-fault divorce rewards wrongdoers, reduces the need of marital binding agreement contracts at the public's expense, and helps women take custody of their children at the husbands' expense in many cases where the man has done nothing wrong. He also adds that a ban on divorce will not work, because people will separate themselves and be in a permanent state of adultery, or they will create a hostile home environment for the children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Baskerville |first=Stephen |editor-last=Wilson |editor-first=Mike |chapter=No-Fault Divorce Is Harmful |title=Divorce |year=2009 |series=Opposing Viewpoints |publisher=Greenhaven Press |location=Detroit |isbn=978-0-7377-4204-6 |chapter-url=http://ic.galegroup.com.webproxy3.columbuslibrary.org/ic/ovic/ViewpointsDetailsPage/ViewpointsDetailsWindow?failOverType=&amp;query=&amp;prodId=OVIC&amp;windowstate=normal&amp;contentModules=&amp;mode=view&amp;displayGroupName=Viewpoints&amp;limiter=&amp;currPage=&amp;disableHighlighting=true&amp;displayGroups=&amp;sortBy=&amp;source=&amp;search_within_results=&amp;action=e&amp;catId=&amp;activityType=&amp;scanId=&amp;documentId=GALE%7CEJ3010571218&amp;userGroupName=cmlweb&amp;jsid=cff244269fd7f0a1db0131c459bfd581 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Baskerville |first=Stephen |title=The No-Blame Game: Why No-Fault Divorce Is Our Most Dangerous Social Experiment |date=1 March 2005 |work=[[Crisis Magazine]] |url=https://www.crisismagazine.com/2005/the-no-blame-game-why-no-fault-divorce-is-our-most-dangerous-social-experiment |accessdate=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laws by country==

===Australia===
{{Main|Australian family law}}
Australia's laws on divorce and other legal family matters were overhauled in 1975 with the enactment of the [[Family Law Act 1975]], which established no-fault divorce in Australia. Since 1975, the only ground for divorce is irretrievable breakdown of marriage, evidenced by a twelve-month separation. However, a residual "fault" element remains in relation to [[child custody]] and [[property settlement]] issues.

===Canada===
Prior to 1968, the only [[grounds for divorce]] were adultery or cruelty. However, in 1968, the [[Divorce Act (Canada)|Divorce Act]] was amended to permit divorce for other reasons, including physical and mental cruelty and separation for at least 3 years. The Divorce Act was amended in 1986 to reduce the separation period to one year, with no requirement to prove "fault" by either spouse. The fault grounds for divorce are also available.

===China===
China has allowed no-fault divorce since the adoption of the [[New Marriage Law]] in 1950. No-fault divorce has become much more common since the 1980s. The current marriage law provides that divorce shall always be granted if sought by both husband and wife. Divorce is also granted if one party can present evidence of incompatibility, such as separation for at least 2 years.

Divorce may be granted either by court or by a marriage registration office. The latter can only do so when both parties have reached an agreement on child custody and property settlement.

===Malta===
A Maltese law permitting no-fault divorce went into effect in October 2011, following a [[Maltese divorce referendum, 2011|national referendum]] on the subject. This was the first Maltese law permitting any kind of divorce.&lt;ref name="Mangion"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mangion|first1=Ann Marie|title=The Financial Aspect of Family Law|journal=Bank of Valletta Review|date=Spring 2012|issue=45|page=112|url=https://www.bov.com/documents/bov-review-45-paper-3-}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===
In [[Mexico City]], this type of divorce is legally known as ''[[:es:Divorcio#Tipos de divorcio|divorcio incausado o sin expresión de causa]]'' and colloquially as ''divorcio exprés''. The law was passed for the first time in Mexico City in 2008 and held constitutional by the Supreme Court, which in 2015 established that any state law requiring to prove the case for a divorce was unconstitutional.{{fact|date=July 2016}}

===Russia===
No-fault divorce was introduced by the [[Bolsheviks]] following the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]].&lt;ref name="Bolas" /&gt; Before the Revolution, religious institutions tended to define family life. It was the ecclesiastical law of the various denominations that controlled the family, marriage, and divorce. For example, the official registration of birth, death, marriage, and divorce was the responsibility of the parish church. Under these non-secular laws, divorce was highly restricted (but always somewhat available, as no major religion in Russia completely disallowed divorce).

The 1918 Decree on Divorce eliminated the religious marriage and the underlying ecclesiastical law, replacing them with civil marriage sanctioned by the state. Divorce was obtained by filing a mutual consent document with the Russian Registry Office, or by the unilateral request of one party to the court. The divorce law under the Bolsheviks did not penalize the husband with [[alimony]], [[child support]], or [[debtor's prison]] for non-payment, as every individual was to be provided for by the state anyway. The two partners were entirely free of legal obligations to each other after divorce.

===Spain===
In [[Spain]], this type of divorce is legally known as ''[[:es:Divorcio#Divorcio_incausado|divorcio incausado]]'' or ''divorcio unilateral'' and colloquially as ''divorcio exprés''.

===Sweden===
Swedish law does not include a showing-of-fault requirement for divorce. The couple can file for divorce together or one party can file alone. If one party does not wish to get divorced or if they have children under 16 living at home, there is a required contemplation period of 6 to 12 months. During this period, they stay married and the request must be confirmed after the waiting period for the divorce to go through.&lt;ref name="dom.se"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dom.se/templates/DV_InfoPage____2413.aspx |title=Divorce |date=2007-03-07|publisher=Sveriges Domstolar – Domstolsverket, Swedish National Courts Administration|accessdate=2008-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before no-fault divorce was available, spouses seeking divorce would often allege false grounds for divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Glaberson |first1=William |title=New Divorce Law Would Allow Couples to Tell the Truth |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/17/nyregion/17divorce.html |accessdate=25 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Removing the incentive to perjure was one motivation for the no-fault movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Trotta|first1=Daniel|title=Proposed NY law could soon bring no-fault divorce|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/newyork-divorce/proposed-ny-law-could-soon-bring-no-fault-divorce-idUSN2515029920100625|accessdate=20 December 2017|agency=Reuters|date=25 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the States of Wisconsin, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Nebraska, Montana, Missouri, Minnesota, Michigan, Kentucky, Kansas, Iowa, Indiana, Hawaii, Florida, Colorado and California, a person seeking a divorce is not permitted to allege a fault-based ground (e.g. adultery, abandonment or cruelty).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://info.legalzoom.com/states-nofault-divorce-states-20400.html|title=Which States Are No-Fault Divorce States?|access-date=2017-05-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Requirements for divorce prior to the enactment of no-fault divorce====

Prior to the advent of no-fault divorce, a divorce was processed through the [[adversarial system]] as a civil action, meaning that a divorce could be obtained only through a showing of fault of ''one'' (and ''only'' one) of the parties in a marriage. This required that one spouse plead that the other had committed adultery, abandonment, felony, or other similarly culpable acts. However, the other spouse could plead a variety of defenses, like [[recrimination]] (essentially an accusation of "so did you"). A judge could find that the respondent had not committed the alleged act or the judge could accept the defense of recrimination and find ''both'' spouses at fault for the dysfunctional nature of their marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stein|first1=David D.|title=Technical Info About Divorce in the U.S|url=http://www.liaisesolutions.com/technical-info-about-divorce-in-the-u-s/|publisher=Liaise Divorce Solutions|accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Either of these two findings was sufficient to defeat an action for divorce, which meant that the parties remained married.&lt;ref&gt;''De Burgh v. De Burgh'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/C2/39C2d858.htm 39 Cal. 2d 858] (1952). In ''De Burgh'', the trial judge found both spouses guilty of cruelty against each other which had been provoked by the acts of the other. Therefore, both spouses were guilty of recrimination and neither was entitled to a divorce. The [[Supreme Court of California]] took advantage of this case to invalidate the defense of recrimination through the expansive application of equitable doctrines like clean hands, and remanded for a new trial.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some states, requirements were even more stringent.  For instance, under its original (1819) constitution, [[Alabama]] required not only the consent of a court of [[Court of Chancery|chancery]] for a divorce (and only "in cases provided for by law"), but equally that of two-thirds of both houses of the state legislature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislature.state.al.us/aliswww/history/constitutions/1819/1819_6.html |title=Constitution of Alabama (1819), Article 6, Section 13 |publisher=Legislature.state.al.us |date= |accessdate=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This requirement was dropped in 1861, when the state adopted a new constitution at the outset of the [[American Civil War]].  The required vote in this case was even stricter than that required to overturn the governor's veto in Alabama, which required only a simple majority of both houses of the General Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislature.state.al.us/aliswww/history/constitutions/1819/1819_4.html |title=Constitution of Alabama (1819), Article 4, Section 16 |publisher=Legislature.state.al.us |date= |accessdate=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Methods for bypassing the showing-of-fault requirements for divorce====

These requirements could be problematic if both spouses were at fault or if neither spouse had committed a legally culpable act but both spouses desired a divorce by mutual consent. Lawyers began to advise their clients on how to create legal fictions to bypass the statutory requirements. One method popular in New York was referred to as "collusive adultery", in which both sides deliberately agreed that the wife would come home at a certain time and discover her husband committing adultery with a "mistress" obtained for the occasion.&lt;ref name="friedman"&gt;{{cite book |last=Friedman |first=Lawrence M. |title=American Law in the Twentieth Century |location=New Haven |publisher=Yale University Press |year=2002 |pages=435–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wife would then falsely swear to a carefully tailored version of these facts in court (thereby committing [[perjury]]). The husband would admit a similar version of those facts. The judge would convict the husband of adultery, and the couple could be divorced.

In many other states, especially California, the most popular allegation for divorce was cruelty (which was then unavailable in New York). For example, in 1950, wives pleaded "cruelty" as the basis for 70 percent of San Francisco divorce cases.&lt;ref name="friedman"/&gt; Wives would regularly testify to the same facts: their husbands swore at them, hit them, and generally treated them terribly.&lt;ref name="friedman"/&gt; This procedure was described by [[Supreme Court of California]] Associate Justice [[Stanley Mosk]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Every day, in every superior court in the state, the same melancholy charade was played: the "innocent" spouse, generally the wife, would take the stand and, to the accompanying cacophony of sobbing and nose-blowing, testify under the deft guidance of an attorney to the spousal conduct that she deemed "cruel."&lt;ref&gt;''In re: Marriage of McKim'', 6 Cal. 3d 673 (1972) (Mosk, J., dissenting) [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C3/6C3d673.htm opinion available online at online.ceb.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An even simpler practice for people living in states where divorce was difficult to obtain was to go "forum shopping." This meant one of the parties would move to another state where no-fault divorce was available, stay there long enough to become a resident, then file for divorce there. Nevada was extremely popular for this purpose as its residency period was only six weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Clint McCullough, ''Nevada'', 1987. Chapter 28. "Divorce was big business in Nevada. Hotels and a dozen dude ranches around Reno catered to the women who arrived almost daily to put a quick end to their marriages. It was even quicker for Nevadans, who didn’t have to wait out the six‑week residency requirement. A couple could fight at breakfast and be divorced by dinner time."&lt;/ref&gt; For some couples, if there really was no problem in settling the issues of their marriage, a weekend trip to Mexico was also an option. Or in some cases, a party deciding they wanted to marry someone else could combine a filing for divorce and a new marriage in one trip to Mexico. As no-fault became near-universal, the need to use Nevada or Mexico to evade restrictive divorce laws became less and less necessary.

====Advocates for eliminating the showing-of-fault requirements for divorce====

Many American lawyers and judges objected to the legal fictions used to satisfy the requirements for divorce, which were effectively rendering oaths meaningless and threatening to wreck the integrity of the American justice system by making perjury into a commonplace occurrence.  As early as the 1930s, a treatise on American family law complained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In divorce litigation it is well known that the parties often seek to evade the statutory limitations and thus there is great danger of perjury, collusion, and fraud . . . . In many cases no defense is interposed, and often when the case is contested the contest is not waged with vigor or good faith.&lt;ref&gt;Vernier, Chester. [https://books.google.com/books?id=2nKmAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA93 Section 80, "Proctors" of ''Divorce and Separation,'' Vol. 2 ''American Family Laws: A Comparative Study of the Family Law of the Forty-eight American States, Alaska, the District of Columbia, and Hawaii''], (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1932), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In addition, advocates for no-fault divorce argued that the law should be changed to provide a straightforward procedure for ending a marriage, rather than forcing a couple who simply couldn't get along to choose between living together in "marital hell" or lying under oath in open court.  The most prominent advocate of this position was feminist law professor [[Herma Hill Kay]] (who later became dean of [[University of California, Berkeley School of Law|UC Berkeley School of Law]]).&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, Katherine. "Sweet Victory for Feminist Pioneer at Law School." ''[[The New York Times]]'', 3 April 1992, sec. A, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

At its convention in 1947, the National Association of Women Lawyers (NAWL) voted to draft and promote a bill that would embody the ideal of no-fault divorce and describes its efforts to promote the passage of no-fault divorce laws as "the greatest project NAWL has ever undertaken."&lt;ref name="Taken Into Custody 234"/&gt;

Other states were slower to adopt no-fault divorce. For example, [[Pennsylvania]] did not introduce no-fault divorce until around 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vosky|first1=Denese Ashbaugh|last2=Monroe|first2=Pamela A.|title=The Effective Dates of No-Fault Divorce Laws in the 50 States|journal=Family Relations|date=Oct 2002|volume=51|issue=4|pages=317–324|url=http://content.csbs.utah.edu/~fan/fcs5400-6400/studentpresentation2009/04DivorceReadingVinsky.pdf|accessdate=31 May 2017|doi=10.1111/j.1741-3729.2002.00317.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====California's Family Law Act of 1969====

[[California]] adopted no-fault divorce with the [[Family Law Act of 1969]], which became effective January 1, 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Sharon. "No-Fault Divorce: 10 Years Later, Some Virtues, Some Flaws." ''[[New York Times]]'', 30 March 1979, sec. A, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; The Act abolished California's action for divorce and replaced it with a proceeding for dissolution of marriage on the grounds of irreconcilable differences.

At about the same time that California adopted no-fault divorce, the [[National Conference of Commissioners of Uniform State Laws]] (NCCUSL) appointed a committee to draft a uniform marriage and divorce law for consideration by state legislatures, and the [[American Bar Association]]'s Family Law Section was asked to appoint a committee to work with the committee from the NCCUSL.&lt;ref name="ABA vs NCCUSL"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The American Bar Association Family Law Section v NCCUSL: Alienation, Separation and Forced Reconciliation over the Uniform Marriage and Divorce Act |last=Zuckman |first=Harvey L. |publisher=Catholic University Law Review |volume=24:61 |url=http://scholarship.law.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1763&amp;context=scholar |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial draft of the Uniform Marriage and Divorce Law written by the NCCUSL committee would direct judges to grant the petitioner's request to end the marriage if the judge found that the marriage was "irretrievably broken", a term which this draft did not define.&lt;ref name="ABA vs NCCUSL"/&gt; Since the term "irretrievably broken" was not defined, the committee from the American Bar Association (ABA) Family Law Section disapproved of this draft of the Uniform Marriage and Divorce Act.&lt;ref name="ABA vs NCCUSL"/&gt; In response, the NCCUSL committee added a 180-day separation requirement in order for judges to find that the marriage had been irretrievably broken.&lt;ref name="ABA vs NCCUSL"/&gt;  However, the NCCUSL committee also added language to allow judges to grant a petitioner a divorce if "there is serious marital discord adversely affecting one or both parties toward the marriage."&lt;ref name="ABA vs NCCUSL"/&gt;  A further problem with "irretrievably broken" is that it seems to assume that broken pieces are somehow acceptable if they can be retrieved, even though they are not put back together.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Trawick, Florida Pleading and Procedure, at p. _____&lt;/ref&gt;

The committee from the ABA Family Law Section objected to the ability of a petitioner to avoid the 180-day separation requirement by asserting "serious marital discord".&lt;ref name="ABA vs NCCUSL"/&gt; In his letter recommending that the American Bar Association House of Delegates not approve the amended draft proposed by the NCCUSL, Arnold J. Gibbs, the chairman of the ABA Family Law Section, stated that the NCCUSL's proposed draft created a rubber stamp type of divorce procedure. He wrote: "The creation of a mere 'rubber stamp type' of divorce procedure would not be in the best interests of the family, its individual members, and society in general."&lt;ref name="ABA recommendation"&gt;{{cite web|title=American Bar Association Section of Family Law Recommendation |last=Gibbs |first=Arnold J. |date=February 1974 |url=http://www.uniformdivorce.com/Report-Read.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate=2008-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copies of the recommendation to disapprove the NCCUSL's amended draft were provided to the National Conference of Commissioners of Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL), Young Lawyers Section and the National Association of Women Lawyers (NAWL).&lt;ref name="ABA recommendation"/&gt; The committee from the NCCUSL refused to further amend its draft of the Uniform Marriage and Divorce Act.&lt;ref name="ABA vs NCCUSL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ABA recommendation"/&gt;

At the 1974 midwinter meeting of the American Bar Association in Houston, Council members of the Family Law Section indicated dissatisfaction with the public image the section was getting from its opposition to the NCCUSL's draft of the Uniform Marriage and Divorce Act. In a policy statement, the ABA Family Law Section chose "to recognize separation only as conclusive evidence of marital breakdown and not as its unbending test", implying that "other kinds of evidence would be admissible to establish breakdown as well."&lt;ref name="ABA vs NCCUSL"/&gt;

====The adoption of no-fault divorce laws by the other states====

By 1977, nine states had adopted no-fault divorce laws,&lt;ref name="Taken Into Custody 234"&gt;{{cite book |title=Taken Into Custody – The War Against Fathers, Marriage and the Family |last=Baskerville |first=Stephen |publisher=Cumberland House |year=2007 |accessdate=2008-07-29 |page=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by late 1983, every state but [[South Dakota]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] had adopted some form of no-fault divorce (although some forms were not as easy to obtain as that in California).&lt;ref&gt;Gest, Ted. "Divorce: how the game is played now." ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'', 21 November 1983, pp. 39–42.&lt;/ref&gt; South Dakota adopted no-fault divorce in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Layug, Christine. "The No-Fault and At-Fault Process of Divorce," 10 July 2008, {{cite web|url=http://www.articlealley.com/article_573525_18.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013101546/http://www.articlealley.com/article_573525_18.html |archivedate=2008-10-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Until August 2010, New York still lacked a unilateral no-fault divorce statute; under [[New York divorce law]], only if ''both parties'' executed and acknowledged a [[legal separation|separation agreement]] and lived separately for one year could a judge convert it into a divorce. New York governor [[David Paterson]] signed a no-fault divorce bill on August 15, 2010. {{As of|October 2010}}, no-fault divorce is allowed in all fifty states and the District of Columbia.

The {{Nihongo|'''North Kanto Young Girl Serial Kidnapping and Murder Case'''|北関東連続幼女誘拐殺人事件|Kita-Kantou Renzoku Youjo Yuukai Satsujin Jiken}} is a serial kidnapping and murder case that has been going on since 1979 in Japan's [[Tochigi Prefecture|Tochigi]] and [[Gunma prefecture|Gunma]] prefectures. The [[Ashikaga murder case]] is included in this.

== Background ==
Since 1979, there have been five cases of kidnapping and/or murder of young girls between ages four and eight (four kidnappings and murders, one kidnapping where the kidnapped girl was never found) occurring within a 20 kilometer radius near the border between Tochigi and Gunma prefectures. All of these cases took place in [[Ōta, Gunma|Ota]] City of Gunma prefecture or [[Ashikaga, Tochigi|Ashikaga]] city of Tochigi prefecture.&lt;ref&gt;『殺人犯はそこにいる: 隠蔽された北関東連続幼女誘拐殺人事件』 新潮社、2013年、{{ISBN|978-4104405022}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;清水潔日本テレビ報道局『ACTION日本崩壊 五つの難問を徹底追跡する』新潮社、2008年12月、{{ISBN|978-4-10-313331-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovery of the case ==
In 2007, investigative journalist [[Kiyoshi Shimizu]] began investigations into the similarities between the five cases, and came across how the [[Ashikaga murder case]] had already been solved, with the supposed culprit Toshikazu Sugaya having admitted (but not been charged with) two other murders. Shimizu's reporting on the subject led to the discovery that Sugaya was innocent, and the National Police Agency and Prosecutor's Office later acknowledged their wrongdoing and the nature of the five cases as a single serial case,&lt;ref&gt;『殺人犯はそこにいる: 隠蔽された北関東連続幼女誘拐殺人事件』 新潮社、2013年、{{ISBN|978-4104405022}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this was further affirmed by minister [[Kansei Nakano]] in a [[National Diet|Diet]] session.&lt;ref&gt;http://kokkai.ndl.go.jp/SENTAKU/sangiin/177/0014/17703080014004a.html 「横山ゆかりちゃんの事件につきましては、群馬県警において、他の事件との関連も視野に入れて鋭意捜査中であると承知をいたしております。」&lt;/ref&gt;

The statute of limitations is commonly brought up as all but the last of the 5 cases has had it pass. This was addressed in a diet meeting in 2011 in which then-prime minister [[Naoto Kan]] urged the police to catch the true culprit.&lt;ref&gt;http://kokkai.ndl.go.jp/SENTAKU/sangiin/177/0014/17703080014004a.html 有田芳生「ここで総理にお伺いしたいのですが、重要事件、しかも冤罪の事件、真犯人も捕まっていない、しかも連続事件の可能性もある。それを時効と言って言い逃れすることは住民の不安を解消することにはなりません。今、国家公安委員長が語ったように、もし真犯人が海外に逃亡していれば時効は停止するんです。犯人特定しなければ、時効がどうなっているか分からない。そういう意味でも、警察、検察の威信に懸けて更に捜査をするべきだと思いますが、総理の御感想、いかがでしょうか。」 内閣総理大臣（菅直人）「この足利事件については、平成二年、栃木県足利市で当時四歳の女の子が殺害、遺棄されたという大変痛ましい事件であることは仰せのとおりであります。また、犯人でない方が、菅家さんが長期間にわたって刑に服すという冤罪事件でもあります。そういった意味で、今お話のあったように、近隣でも同じような事件が五件もあるということの御指摘もありますので、捜査そのものの一般的な在り方は一般的に一つのルールがあるかと思いますけれども、まさに冤罪事件であり、さらにその後も事件が、類似の事件が続いていることを考えますと、今後のこういう同一、同種類の事件を防ぐという意味からも、必要なことについてはしっかり対応することが警察等においても必要ではないかと、今のお話を聞きながらそのように感じたところであります。」&lt;/ref&gt; The parents of the five girls have also urged the police to continue investigating,&lt;ref&gt;https://japantoday.com/category/crime/parents-of-five-murdered-girls-still-pushing-for-resolution&lt;/ref&gt; as has Sugaya.&lt;ref&gt;http://getnews.jp/archives/148316&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite acknowledging the serial nature of the cases, however, the police have not made any arrests in connection with them, and informed the mother of Mami Matsuda, the victim of the Ashikaga case, that they were no longer investigating her daughter's case due to the statute of limitations.&lt;ref&gt;『殺人犯はそこにいる: 隠蔽された北関東連続幼女誘拐殺人事件』 新潮社、2013年、{{ISBN|978-4104405022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Miscarriage of justice in the Ashikaga case ===
While investigating the Ashikaga murder case, Shimizu discovered, among other things,
* That the events in the confession by Sugaya were impossible (there would not have been enough time to carry out the crime, and the victim's mother stated that her daughter could not have fit into the bicycle's basket like the confession stated)
* That two eyewitness reports regarding the culprit and the kidnapped girl (which contradicted Sugaya's confession) had not been presented in court (the descriptions of the culprit were later found to match security camera footage of the culprit in other cases&lt;ref&gt;http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2009/06/23/national/witness-links-two-missing-girls/&lt;/ref&gt;)
* That there were serious issues with the DNA testing methods, with how much data were taken (no tests were done to determine the DNA of the victim or her parents) as well as contamination
* That the alleged child porn that the police claimed to have found in Sugaya's apartment did not exist (the VHS tapes seized by the police were found to be of movies including one of [[Indiana Jones]], and of porn featuring women with large breasts)

Sugaya also professes that his confession had been beaten out of him by detective Fumio Hashimoto, who had been in charge of the case.

Sugaya had previously been denied new DNA tests and a retrial despite DNA evidence presented by his lawyers and the support of the Japan Federation of Bar Associations.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nichibenren.or.jp/activity/document/statement/year/2008/080213.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nichibenren.or.jp/en/document/statements/year/2009/20090623.html&lt;/ref&gt; Shimizu reported widely on his findings, resulting in a DNA test and Sugaya's release from prison in 2009, and a retrial in 2010 which found him innocent.&lt;ref&gt;里見繁 「DNA鑑定の呪縛 足利事件と飯塚事件」（『冤罪をつくる検察、それを支える裁判所 そして冤罪はなくならない』インパクト出版会、2010年12月、{{ISBN|978-4755402111}}）&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;小林篤『足利事件 冤罪を証明した一冊のこの本』講談社文庫、2009年9月、{{ISBN|978-4062764582}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shimizu won the [[Editors' Choice Magazine Journalism Award]] for exposing this [[miscarriage of justice]].

== Murders and kidnappings included in the case ==
; 1979 murder of Maya Fukushima: On 3 August 1979, five-year-old Maya Fukushima went missing while playing at a shrine near to her house in Ashikaga. Her body was found naked in a rucksack six days later abandoned next to the Watarase river.
; 1984 murder of Yumi Hasebe: On 17 November 1984, five-year-old Yumi Hasebe went missing from a [[pachinko]] parlor. Her body was found on 8 March 1986 in a field 1.7 kilometers away from her home.
; 1987 murder of Tomoko Oosawa: On 15 September 1987, eight-year-old Tomoko Oosawa left her house in Ota and went missing. Her body was found on 27 November 1988 abandoned by the Tone River.
; 1990 murder of Mami Matsuda: The [[Ashikaga murder case]]
; 1996 kidnapping of Yukari Yokoyama: On 7 July 1996, four-year-old Yukari Yokoyama went missing from a pachinko parlor. As the girl was never found, this is treated as a disappearance case.

The following are used as reasoning behind the definition of this as a serial case:
* All cases involved young girls between ages 4 and 8
* In three cases, the victim vanished from a pachinko parlor
* In three cases, the body was found next to a river (the Watarase River in two)
* Four cases happened on a Friday, weekend, or holiday

All five crimes have not been resolved, with the culprit not arrested. The case has been given extensive media coverage, and has been brought up in the Japanese Diet multiple times, and was also addressed by then-prime minister [[Naoto Kan]], who appealed to the police to solve the case.&lt;ref&gt;http://kokkai.ndl.go.jp/SENTAKU/sangiin/177/0014/17703080014004a.html 「この足利事件については、平成二年、栃木県足利市で当時四歳の女の子が殺害、遺棄されたという大変痛ましい事件であることは仰せのとおりであります。また、犯人でない方が、菅家さんが長期間にわたって刑に服すという冤罪事件でもあります。そういった意味で、今お話のあったように、近隣でも同じような事件が五件もあるということの御指摘もありますので、捜査そのものの一般的な在り方は一般的に一つのルールがあるかと思いますけれども、まさに冤罪事件であり、さらにその後も事件が、類似の事件が続いていることを考えますと、今後のこういう同一、同種類の事件を防ぐという意味からも、必要なことについてはしっかり対応することが警察等においても必要ではないかと、今のお話を聞きながらそのように感じたところであります。」&lt;/ref&gt;

Security camera footage of the culprit exists from the 1996 kidnapping case, and eyewitnesses from the Ashikaga case have stated that he strongly resembles the man they saw.

In 2010 and 2011, Shimizu reported strong evidence that the perpetrator had been found, including DNA test results connecting him to the Ashikaga case (a 100% match to the results of new tests of the perpetrator's DNA) and video recordings of him talking to young girls and making them sit on his lap, and gave this information to the police, but no arrest was made. The reasoning given for the refusal to arrest the alleged perpetrator was that his DNA does not match that of the culprit previously found in the Ashikaga case.

Shimizu professes that the DNA testing methods used in the Ashikaga case were flawed, and that arresting the perpetrator would require the prosecutor's office to acknowledge this. However, the same testing methods were also used in the [[Iizuka case]], in which the alleged culprit was executed in 2008 despite requests for new DNA tests and a retrial, and acknowledging that the testing methods were flawed would lead to a massive scandal around that case.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2010/11/28/national/media-national/journalist-wants-ashikaga-murder-case-reopened/&lt;/ref&gt;

Shimizu's investigations into the Iizuka case found the possibility that a large amount of the evidence was doctored, and he concludes that it was the amount, and not quality of the evidence which led to the conviction, and that overturning even one piece of evidence would have caused the prosecutor's case to fall apart.&lt;ref&gt;『殺人犯はそこにいる: 隠蔽された北関東連続幼女誘拐殺人事件』 新潮社、2013年、{{ISBN|978-4104405022}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;里見繁 「DNA鑑定の呪縛 足利事件と飯塚事件」（『冤罪をつくる検察、それを支える裁判所 そして冤罪はなくならない』インパクト出版会、2010年12月、{{ISBN|978-4755402111}}）&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, when the mother of Mami Matsuda was informed by the police that they were no longer investigating her daughter's case due to the statute of limitations, she requested that they return her daughter's belongings, but they refused to return the shirt which has the true culprit's semen stains on it. They refused to give a straight answer as to why, and Shimizu suspects that this is because they are afraid that others might have the DNA of the true culprit tested by modern means, proving that the methods previously used returned wrong results.&lt;ref&gt;『殺人犯はそこにいる: 隠蔽された北関東連続幼女誘拐殺人事件』 新潮社、2013年、{{ISBN|978-4104405022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Outbound content compliance''' or '''outbound content security''' is a relatively new segment of the [[computer security]] field, which aims to detect and prevent outbound content that violates policy of the organization and/or government regulations.&lt;ref&gt;http://security.tekrati.com/research/9409/&lt;/ref&gt; It deals with internal threats, as opposite to more traditional security solutions ([[Firewall (computing)|firewall]], [[anti-virus]], anti-spam etc.), that are dealing with external threats.  Therefore, it is sometimes called inside-out security.

==Business environment==
In the business environment, the purpose is to prevent confidential and/or private data leaks.  The protected information may belong to the company itself or to its customers.  [[US]], [[Canada]], [[Europe]]an and some other countries enacted laws, mandating protection of some types of the computer-based information.  Some of the US laws, including related provisions: [[Sarbanes-Oxley]], [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]], [[Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act]].

The interest to the segment was heated after a string of high-profile data breaches, when personal information of millions of people was stolen or endangered.

The '''Philippine Board of Nursing''' is an administrative body under the [[Professional Regulation Commission]] that regulates the practice of [[nursing]] in the [[Philippines]].

Its three primary purposes are:

# To provide regulatory standards in the practice of Nursing by implementing the [[Nurse Practice Act]] and by lobbying to [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]] any proposed amendment to any laws with direct relationship to the practice of nursing.
# To ensure public safety by administering the [[Philippine Nursing Licensure Exam]] (PNLE) to graduates of nursing schools prior to practice of Registered Nursing in the Philippines.
# To maintain high standards of nursing education by auditing the performance of Philippine Nursing Schools.

The '''Politics-administration dichotomy''' is a theory that constructs the boundaries of [[public administration]] and asserts the normative relationship between elected officials and administrators in a democratic society.&lt;ref name="Svara 51–58"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Svara |first=James |date=Jan–Feb 1998 |title=The Politics-Administration Dichotomy Model as Aberration |journal=Public Administration Review |volume=58 |pages=51–58 |doi=10.2307/976889|jstor=976889 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase ''politics-administration dichotomy'' itself does not appear to have a known inventor, even after exhaustive research, the combination of words that make up the phrase was first found in [[public administration]] literature from the 1940s with no clear originator.&lt;ref&gt;Overeem, Patrick (2012).

== History ==

[[File:Thomas Woodrow Wilson, Harris &amp; Ewing bw photo portrait, 1919.jpg|thumbnail|right|Portrait of Woodrow Wilson 1919]]

[[Woodrow Wilson]] is credited with the politics-administration dichotomy via his theories on public administration in his 1887 essay, "[[The Study of Administration]]". Wilson came up with a theory that politics and administration are inherently different and should be approached as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Stillman, II |first=Richard |date=June 1973 |title=Woodrow Wilson and the Study of Administration |journal=The American Political Science Review |volume=67 |issue=2 |pages=582–588 |doi=10.2307/1958787|jstor=1958787 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson wrote in his essay in regards to [[public administration]]: “The field of administration is a field of business. It is removed from the hurry and strife of politics.... Administration lies outside the proper sphere of politics. Administrative questions are not political questions. Although politics sets the tasks for administration, it should not be suffered to manipulate its offices.”&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, W., 1887, “The Study of Administration”. Political Science Quarterly, Reprinted in 1997 in Classics of Public Administration, 2d ed. Shafritz, J, and Hyde, A, Chicago: Dorsey Press.&lt;/ref&gt; With these words, Wilson started a debate that has been going on for decades and continues to this day. The politics-administration dichotomy is an important concept in the field of public administration and shows no signs of going away because it deals with the policy-makers role as an administrator and the balancing act that is the relationship between politics and administration.&lt;ref&gt;Reza Tahmasebi &amp; Seyyed Mohammad Mahdi Musavi. (2011).
"Politics-Administration Dichotomy: A Century Debate," ''Revista Administratie Si Management Public'', Faculty of Administration and Public Management, Academy of Economic Studies, Bucharest, Romania, vol. 2011(17), pages 130-143, November 27, 2013. http://www.ramp.ase.ro/en/_data/files/articole/2011/17-09.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This essay is considered to be the first source to be analyzed and studied in the public administration field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Link|first=Arthur S.|title=Woodrow Wilson and the Study of Administration|journal=American Philosophical Society|date=December 9, 1968|volume=112|issue=6|pages=431–433}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson was primarily influenced by Richard Ely and Herbert Adams who taught at [[Johns Hopkins University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosser|first=Christian|title=Woodrow Wilson's Administrative Thought and German Political Theory|journal=Public Administration Review|date=July 1, 2010|volume=70|issue=4|pages=547–556|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6210.2010.02175.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Perceived Advantages ==

Woodrow Wilson’s politics-administration dichotomy can potentially be substantial in sustaining a strong productive government. The complexity, difficulty level and ample multiplication of governmental functions can be seen as a main component in the cause to implement the politics-administration dichotomy. Due to Wilson's lack of faith in republican self-government and the overwhelming amount of “selfish, ignorant, timid, stubborn, or foolish” persons whom the “bulk of can vote,” this model provides a solution that would counteract the majority of the incumbent voters. By employing the elite philosophical leaders to improve, shape, condition and sway public opinion, politics-administration dichotomy, if carried out in an unselfish manner leaves little to no room for error. 

Woodrow Wilson’s model created one of the first concepts of checks and balances, which is one of the most predominant systems of democratic accountability used to shape the United States government. Nevertheless “separating the will of the people from politics” could be extremely beneficial and institutionally separating administration from politics could prove valuable in sustaining government accountability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jewison|first=Blayne|date=Feb 1996|title=A Case For Reinterpreted Dichotomy of Politics and Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Woodrow|date=July 1887|title=The Study of Administration|journal=Political Science Quarterly}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Politics-administration dichotomy also leads to political neutrality. The blurring of "politics" and "policy" has cause to the advocations to dismiss "partisan politics" rather than "policy politics."
The importance of neutrality in politics and policy are established within the politics-administration dichotomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Overeem, |first=Patrick|title=THE VALUE OF THE DICHOTOMY: POLITICS, ADMINISTRATION, AND THE POLITICAL NEUTRALITY OF ADMINISTRATORS|journal=Administrative Theory &amp; Praxis (Administrative Theory &amp; Praxis).|date=June 2005|volume=27|issue=2|pages=311–329}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

Standard definition is too narrow . If [[politics]] includes all of what we know as policy making, then the dichotomy would bar administrators, presumably including city managers, from participation. The dichotomy of policy and administration was a conceptual distinction underlying a theory of democratic accountability. It was not intended to guide behavior, it was intended as a behavioral prescription directed against contemporary practices of machine politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Montjoy |first=Robert |last2=Watson |first2=Douglas |date=May–June 1995 |title=A Case for Reinterpreted Dichotomy of Politics and Administration as a Professional Standard in Council-Manager Government  |jstor=3110241  |journal=Public Administration Review |publisher=Wiley |volume=55 |issue=3 |pages=231–239 |doi=10.2307/3110241}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The strict definition is the model. It is not conceptually possible to have a one way dichotomy that keeps elected official out of administration but allows administrators to be active in policy. The dichotomy model standing alone is an aberration.&lt;ref name="Svara 51–58"/&gt;
{{quote|Arguably the father of American political administration, Wilson, in his essay '[[The Study of Administration]]', suggested that in order to have objectivity and progress, the administration must be separate from politics ... The political/administration dichotomy aimed to separate the power between political leaders and the merit-based appointment of professional permanent civil servants in the administrative state ... At the turn of the 20th century, the field focused on making the bureaucracy more effective ... The field’s basic premise was to take a business-like approach to government and its activities.&lt;ref name="blogspot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heydeesmeet.blogspot.com/2011/03/politicaladministrative-dichotomy.html|title=Urban-imagination: The political/administrative dichotomy|publisher=heydeesmeet.blogspot.com|accessdate=2014-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} By Wilson making the statement, "Government should be run like a business," he thereby opened up many loop holes for the capitalist society to exploit the government for things they didn’t actually have. This statement ends in a very dangerous uncharted territory for people now. Based on the fact government could be run like a business. The concept "everyone has a boss" with creating the business like mindset running our country it makes everyone have to answer to someone (higher on the totem pole) than the other, it creates a sense of working for your job when you are supposed to be working for the people whom you represent. So now, instead of implementing policy to help the people, administrators and politicians are more concerned about who is funding/appointing than they are worried about the common man. That isn’t just the biggest problem for Politic administration Dichotomy it is a huge problem for the sustainability of our government and the world.&lt;ref name="blogspot"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sagepub"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aas.sagepub.com/content/16/2/141.short|title=American Public Administration and the Idea of Reform|publisher=aas.sagepub.com|accessdate=2014-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Rector v. Major League Baseball Advanced Media''''',  No. 303630 (N.Y. Sup. Bronx Co. 2014), was a [[New York Supreme Court]] defamation case. Andrew Rector sued [[Major League Baseball]], the [[New York Yankees]], [[ESPN]] and their MLB announcers for broadcasting images of him sleeping at a game at [[Yankee Stadium]] between the New York Yankees and the [[Boston Red Sox]] and allegedly making defamatory comments about him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/new-york/mlb/story/_/id/11190576/sleeping-fan-files-10-million-defamation-lawsuit-espn-announcers |title=Sleeping fan files $10 million defamation lawsuit against ESPN, announcers |publisher=ESPN |date=July 8, 2014 |accessdate=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rector sued for $10 million for "defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress".&lt;ref name=reuters /&gt; The case was dismissed by Judge Julia Rodriguez, who ruled that the statements made were not defamatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Salinger |first=Tobias |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/sleeping-yankees-fan-10m-lawsuit-dismissed-article-1.2379498 |title=Sleeping Yankees fan’s $10M lawsuit dismissed |work=NY Daily News |date=September 30, 2015 |accessdate=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
On April 13, 2014, Rector attended Yankee Stadium to watch the New York Yankees play the Boston Red Sox in a [[Yankees–Red Sox rivalry]] game. During the fourth inning, Rector was filmed by ESPN sleeping in his seat with the footage broadcast to viewers during their live coverage of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/80739847-157.html |title=Sleeping Yankees fan sues ESPN, MLB |work=Los Angeles Times |date= |accessdate=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ESPN New York]] announcers [[Dan Shulman]] and [[John Kruk]] made a number of jokes about him when his image was placed on the stadium [[jumbotron]]. They initially commented that Rector was oblivious to the quality of [[MLB.tv]] that they had been promoting in commentary prior to Rector's image being broadcast and then made comments about Rector, questioning how he could sleep through a [[Carlos Beltran]] [[home run]] and stated that the person who sat next to him did not want to share his food with Rector.&lt;ref name=sl /&gt; They also compared Rector's body size to Kruk's.&lt;ref name=reuters&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-baseball-sleeping-fan/dozing-baseball-fans-10-million-espn-lawsuit-is-thrown-out-idUSKCN0RW23820151002 |title=Dozing baseball fan's $10 million ESPN lawsuit is thrown out |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=March 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; MLB later posted the broadcast video of Rector sleeping online where it was covered by a number of media organizations worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Rohan |last=Smith |url=http://www.news.com.au/sport/sports-life/andrew-rectors-only-crime-was-falling-asleep-at-the-baseball-but-he-was-punished-for-it-mercilessly/news-story/3fa6ed50986be6cb36f259eadf1eba1d |title=Yankee fan falls asleep at baseball and video goes viral - Andrew Rector’s story |location=Sydney |publisher=News.com.au |date=October 6, 2015 |accessdate=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Mark |last=Gollom |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/why-andrew-rector-the-dozing-baseball-fan-has-no-case-against-espn-1.2700270 |title=Why Andrew Rector, the dozing baseball fan, has 'no case' against ESPN |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=2014-07-09 |accessdate=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brennan |first=Christopher |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3253876/Judge-dismisses-10million-lawsuit-against-ESPN-announcers-poked-fun-Yankee-fan-fell-asleep-game.html |title=Judge dismisses $10m lawsuit against ESPN announcers that mocked Yankee fan who fell asleep |location=London |publisher=Daily Mail|date=2015-09-29 |accessdate=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rector filed a defamation lawsuit at the New York Supreme Court in [[The Bronx, New York]] against MLB, ESPN, the Yankees and the ESPN announcers for $10 million alleging that they subjected him to "an unending verbal crusade".&lt;ref name=sl&gt;{{cite web|last=Beekman |first=Daniel |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/man-slept-yankees-game-sues-10-million-article-1.1857671 |title=Man who slept at Yankees game sues for $10 million |work=NY Daily News |date=July 7, 2014 |accessdate=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Legal experts speculated that the challenge would not be successful owing to the statements causing emotional stress rather than damaging reputation and due to defamation cases historically being unsuccessful under [[New York State]] law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Linshi |first=Jack |url=http://time.com/2967510/sleeping-yankees-fan-lawsuit/ |title=Sleeping Yankees Fan's Lawsuit Won't Get Far, Legal Experts Say |work=Time |date=July 8, 2014 |accessdate=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aj&gt;{{cite web|first=A.J. |last=Perez |url=http://www.nj.com/yankees/index.ssf/2014/07/sleeping_yankees_fan_who_filed_defamation_lawsuit_has_a_very_very_difficult_uphill_case.html |title=Here's why sleeping Yankees fan who filed 'idiotic' defamation lawsuit has no shot at winning |publisher=NJ.com |date=July 8, 2014 |accessdate=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Case ==
Rector alleged in his claim, which was reportedly full of [[typographical error|typographical]] and [[grammatical error]]s, that the announcers had called him "a fatty cow", then used words such as ''stupor'', ''unintelligent'' and ''stupid'', and said that he was "not worthy to be a fan."&lt;ref name=sl /&gt; He also alleged that [[MLB.com]] had posted numerous memes, including one of him involved in a homosexual kiss and one with the caption of "Yankee's {{sic}} Fan cares not for your rivalry talk", that implied that he supported what was occurring in the images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://boston.cbslocal.com/2014/07/07/report-fan-who-slept-during-red-sox-yankees-game-now-suing-espn-mlb-for-mockery/ |title=Report: Fan Who Slept During Red Sox-Yankees Game Now Suing ESPN, MLB For Mockery |publisher=CBS Boston |date=July 7, 2014 |accessdate=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that the MLB's posting of the video online "set the stage" for further defamatory comments from online viewers.&lt;ref name=toss /&gt; The MLB's legal team filed a [[motion to dismiss]] on procedural grounds, as Rector had not stated a [[cause of action]], and the statements in question had been loose and hyperbolic and not malicious defamation.&lt;ref name=sg /&gt; The MLB, ESPN and the New York Yankees submitted CD copies of both the incident and the entire broadcast, which they stated showed that the statements alleged by the plaintiff were not made.&lt;ref name=sg&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/fail/judge-boots-sleepy-fan-lawsuit-674502 |title=Yankee Fan's Defamation Suit Is Put To Sleep |publisher=The Smoking Gun |date= |accessdate=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In court, Judge Julia Rodriguez granted the defendants' motions. In her judgement, she stated that the CDs of the broadcasts showed that the announcers did not make the statements alleged in the complaint and that they had been made by other individuals on websites not run by the defendants.&lt;ref name=sg /&gt; While she agreed that comments had been made about Rector's weight and his ability to sleep through a standing ovation, he was only shown and commented on for 31 seconds; the judge ruled the comments made did not meet the legal standard of defamation.&lt;ref name=toss&gt;{{cite web|last=Italiano |first=Laura |url=https://nypost.com/2015/09/30/judge-tosses-sleeping-yankees-fans-lawsuit-against-espn/ |title=Judge tosses sleeping Yankees fan’s lawsuit against ESPN |work=New York Post |date=September 30, 2015 |accessdate=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also stated that ESPN had not broadcast Rector unauthorized, as it was common practice for broadcasters at baseball games to show spectators.&lt;ref name=sg /&gt; Judge Rodriguez stated that with regard to Rector's claim of "emotional distress", none of the alleged comments were attributable to the defendants and they could not be held responsible for alleged defamatory comments made by third parties on third-party websites, as there was no [[duty of care]] to protect him from those statements.&lt;ref name=sg /&gt; As a result, the case was dismissed.&lt;ref name=toss /&gt;

== Aftermath ==
Following Rector's filing of the case being made public, news organisations criticized the action as [[frivolous litigation]].&lt;ref name=aj /&gt;&lt;ref name=db&gt;{{cite web|first=Ben |last=Jacobs |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/sleeping-yankees-fan-files-worst-lawsuit-ever |title=Sleeping Yankees Fan Files Worst Lawsuit Ever |work=The Daily Beast |date=July 8, 2014 |accessdate=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal commentators stated that due to the media attention that the case brought, Rector probably ended up causing more damage to his reputation by bringing the case than the initial broadcast would have.&lt;ref name=iot&gt;{{cite web |first=Joe |last=Baghat |date=July 9, 2014 |url=https://www.internetontrial.com/sports-law/sleeping-yankee-fans-lawyer-should-be-disbarred/ |title=Sleeping Yankee fan's lawyer should be disbarred |publisher=Internet on Trial |accessdate=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rector's lawyer, Valentine Okwara had stated that he had advised his client that "there is room for appeal".&lt;ref name=reuters /&gt; The lawsuit has since been used as a case study on the issue of defamation at sports events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Litigation Paralegal: A Systems Approach |first=James |last=McCord |year=2016 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=1285857151 |page=200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Salazar v. Buono''''', 559 U.S. 700 (2010) was a decision by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] regarding the [[establishment clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. The case concerned the legality of the [[Mojave Memorial Cross]], a [[Latin cross]] which was placed atop a prominent rock outcropping, by the VFW foundation, in 1934 to honor war dead. The location is known as “[[Sunrise Rock]]” in the [[Mojave National Preserve]] in [[San Bernardino County]] in southeastern [[California]]. The Supreme Court ruled that the cross may stay, but also sent the case back to a lower court, making the issue currently unresolved.&lt;ref name="washpost"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/28/AR2010042801949.html High court says Mojave cross in Calif. can stay], Washington Post, 2010-4-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===The cross===
{{main article|Mojave Memorial Cross}}
Currently, there is a cross atop Sunrise Rock that is between {{convert|5|and|8|ft}} tall and is constructed out of {{convert|4|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} metal pipes painted white. Historical records reflect that a wooden cross was built on that location as early as 1934 by the [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]] as a memorial to veterans who died in [[World War I]]. Photographs depict the wooden cross and signs near it stating: “The Cross, Erected in Memory of the Dead of All Wars,” and “Erected 1934 by Members of Veterans of Foreign Wars, [[Joshua Tree]] post 2884.” The wooden signs are no longer present, and the original wooden cross, which is no longer standing, has been replaced by private parties several times since 1934. The cross has been an intermittent gathering place for [[Easter]] religious services since as early as 1935, and regularly since 1984. The current version of the cross was built by Henry Sandoz, a local resident, sometime in 1998. When the [[National Park Service]] (NPS) investigated the history of the cross, Sandoz explained that he drilled holes into Sunrise Rock to bolt the cross in place, making it difficult to remove. Sandoz did not receive a permit from NPS to construct the cross. No sign indicates that the cross was or is intended to act as a memorial for war veterans.

===Action by the National Park Service and Congress===
In 1999, NPS received a request from an individual seeking to build a [[stupa]] (a dome-shaped [[Buddhist]] shrine) on a rock outcropping at a trailhead located near the cross. NPS denied that request, citing 36 C.F.R. § 2.62(a)&lt;ref&gt;The regulation provides that: “The installation of a monument, memorial, tablet, structure, or other commemorative installation in a park area without the authorization of the Director is prohibited.” 36 C.F.R. § 2.62(a).&lt;/ref&gt; as prohibiting the installation of a memorial without authorization. A handwritten note on the denial letter warned that “[a]ny attempt to erect a stupa will be in violation of Federal Law and subject you to citation and/or arrest.” The letter also indicates that “[c]urrently there is a cross on [a] rock outcrop located on National Park Service lands. . . . It is our intention to have the cross removed.”

In 1999, NPS undertook a study of the history of the cross. NPS determined that neither the cross nor the property on which it is situated qualifies for inclusion in the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. Specifically, NPS recognized that the cross itself “has been replaced many times and the plaque that once accompanied it (even though it is not known if it is original) has been removed.” Also, the property does not qualify as an historical site because, among other things, “the site is used for religious purposes as well as commemoration.” Following the announcement by NPS of its intention to remove the cross, the [[United States Congress]] passed a series of laws to preserve the Sunrise Rock cross. The first piece of legislation, enacted in December 2000, provided that no government funds could be used to remove the cross.&lt;ref&gt;Pub. L. No. 106-554 § 133, 114 Stat. 2763A-230 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lawsuit and injunction===
Frank Buono, a former NPS employee, filed suit in March 2001 against the Secretary of the [[Department of the Interior]], the Regional Director of NPS, and the Superintendent of the Preserve. The district court concluded that the presence of the cross in the Preserve violates the [[Establishment Clause]].&lt;ref&gt;Buono I, 212 F. Supp. 2d at 1215-17.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2002, the court entered a permanent [[injunction]] ordering that the “Defendants, their employees, agents, and those in active concert with Defendants, are hereby permanently restrained and enjoined from permitting display of the Latin cross in the area of Sunrise Rock in the Mojave National Preserve.”

===Further Congressional action===
In January 2002, while this matter was pending in district court, Congress passed a defense appropriations bill, which included a section designating the Sunrise Rock cross as a “national memorial.”&lt;ref&gt;Pub.L. No. 107-117 § 8137, 115 Stat. 2278-79 (2002), codified at 16 U.S.C. § 410aaa-56 (note)&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2002, less than three months after the district court’s injunction, in legislation aimed at the Sunrise Rock cross, Congress passed a defense appropriations bill that included a provision barring the use of federal funds “to dismantle national memorials commemorating United States participation in World War I.”&lt;ref&gt;Pub. L. No. 107-248 § 8065(b), 116 Stat.1551 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2003 Congress enacted another defense appropriations bill that included a land exchange agreement regarding the Sunrise Rock cross in which an acre of land containing the cross was conveyed to the Veterans Home of California— Barstow, Veterans of Foreign Wars Post #385E in consideration for {{convert|5|acre}} of land.&lt;ref&gt;Pub. L. No. 108-87 § 8121(a)-(f), 117 Stat. 1100 (2003), codified at 16 U.S.C. § 410aaa-56 (note)&lt;/ref&gt; The government retained a [[Reversion (law)|reversionary interest]] in the property subject to a condition that the recipient maintain the conveyed property as a memorial commemorating United States participation in World War I and honoring the American veterans of that war.

===Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decisions===
In June 2004, the [[Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] affirmed the district court’s permanent injunction, holding that the presence of the cross in the Preserve violates the Establishment Clause. Despite the injunction against display of the cross in the Preserve, the government began moving forward with the mechanics of the land exchange under § 8121. Buono moved to enforce the district court’s prior injunction, or modify it to prohibit the land exchange as a violation of the Establishment Clause. In April 2005, the district court granted Buono’s motion to enforce the injunction, and denied as moot the request to amend the permanent injunction.&lt;ref&gt;Buono v. Norton, 364 F. Supp. 2d 1175, 1177, 1182 &amp; n.8 (C.D. Cal. 2005) (“Buono III”)&lt;/ref&gt; According to the district court, “the transfer of the Preserve land containing the Latin Cross which as [a] sectarian war memorial carries an inherently religious message and creates an appearance of honoring only those servicemen of that particular religion is an attempt by the government to evade the permanent injunction enjoining the display of the Latin Cross atop Sunrise Rock.”&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 1182 (citation and quotation marks omitted).&lt;/ref&gt; The district court deemed the exchange “invalid” and permanently enjoined the government “from implementing the provisions of Section 8121 of Public Law 108-87” and ordered the government “to comply forthwith with the judgment and permanent injunction entered by th[e] court on July 24, 2002.” Id. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. The United States Supreme Court then granted the government's petition for a [[writ of certiorari]].

===United States Supreme Court ruling===
On April 28, 2010, the United States Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the cross may stay but also sent the case back to a lower court.&lt;ref name="washpost"/&gt;  Writing for the plurality of the court, Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote, "The goal of avoiding governmental endorsement [of religion] does not require eradication of all religious symbols in the public realm".&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/Supreme_Court/supreme-court-refuses-ban-mojave-cross/story?id=9536679 Supreme Court Keeps Mojave Cross Case Alive]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath===
Only eleven days after the Supreme Court decision, the cross was stolen during the overnight of May 9–10, 2010; its theft is believed {{by whom|date=November 2011}} to be related to those who opposed the cross, but no arrests have been made to date (as the cross was filled with concrete, it would have been worthless for resale).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/05/11/thieves-steal-mojave-desert-memorial-cross-nighttime-heist/ Caretakers of Stolen Mojave Desert Cross Vow to Replace It]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2010-05-11-mojave-desert-cross_N.htm?csp=34 Vandals tear down cross that justices would not]&lt;/ref&gt; National Park Service spokeswoman Linda Slater said a $25,000 reward has been offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the thieves; the reward was later increased to $100,000. The VFW promised that the memorial will be rebuilt."This was a legal fight that a vandal just made personal to 50 million veterans, military personnel and their families," National Commander Thomas J. Tradewell said.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100511/ap_on_re_us/us_mojave_cross&lt;/ref&gt;  On May 20, a replica cross was discovered to have been erected in place of the original.  Park officials said it was erected overnight, but because of the court ruling park employees would have to remove the replica.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnn.com/2010/US/05/20/mojave.cross.replaced/&lt;/ref&gt; Another lawsuit has since been filed to expedite the land transfer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8720">The '''spaghetti bowl effect''' is the multiplication of [[free trade agreements]] (FTAs), supplanting multilateral [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] negotiations as an alternative path toward [[globalization]]. The term was first used by [[Jagdish Bhagwati]] in 1995 in the paper: “''US Trade policy: The infatuation with free trade agreements''”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/catalog/ac:100125|title=US Trade Policy: The Infatuation with FTAs|first=Jagdish N.|last=Bhagwati|date=24 November 1995|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he openly criticized FTAs as being paradoxically counter-productive in promoting freer and more opened global trades. According to Bhagwati, the too many crisscrossing FTAs would represent a costly complication of World trades, and would allow countries to adopt discriminative trade policies which would, in turns, reduce trade welfare.

== Context ==
In 1947, the most economically prominent nations signed the multilateral [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]]s (GATT), whose main goals were to reduce tariffs and other trade barriers as well as eliminate discriminatory treatments between signatory countries. After gradual rounds of negotiations, more countries were integrated and tariffs were significantly reduced. The [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) was created in 1995 to meet the growing institutional needs of a deepening globalization.

However, because of the increasing number of members and interest diversity, as well as the complication of the topics discussed (subsidies, intellectual property, etc.), liberalization negotiations have slowed down since the 1990s. The last WTO Negotiation Round, the [[Doha Development Round|Doha Round]], launched in 2001, stalled over disagreements on agricultural subsidies and market access, as well as intellectual property issues.

In this way, many countries have been resorting to bilateral and multilateral FTAs as a faster and more flexible way to promote free trades and globalization. Indeed, FTAs require only the consent of a limited number of like-minded countries, as opposed to the general consent of all WTO members necessary to conclude a negotiation round. Such agreements also allow countries to tackle broader issues such as bilateral investments, labor migration and regulations. As a result, the numbers of FTAs in force and in negotiations have exploded since the mid-1990s, passing from 100 agreements in 1990 to more than 400 in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rieti.go.jp/en/papers/contribution/urata/03.html|title=RIETI - FTAs and EPAs Deserve Renewed Recognition for their Roles|website=www.rieti.go.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenges posed by FTAs according to J. Bhagwati ==
This FTA trend has been described by many economists as a more pragmatic way to promote free trade and globalization. Jagdish Bhagwati strongly opposes this opinion, describing the entanglement of hundreds of FTAs with various rules, tariffs and institutional arrangements as a “spaghetti bowl”.

Bhagwati identifies several problems inherent to FTAs, which make them unfit to promote a clear and global trade liberalization with widespread benefits: 
* A founding principle of the GATT, and later the WTO, is the non-discriminatory principle or [[Most favoured nation|“Most Favored Nation Clause]]” (MFN),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/fact2_e.htm|title=WTO - Understanding the WTO - principles of the trading system|website=www.wto.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that GATT country-members cannot discriminate between their trade partners. In this way, any special favor should be granted to all trade partners without distinction. FTAs would constitute a loophole in the MFN clause, enabling states to enforce different level of tariffs and trade barriers.
* [[Rules of origin|Rules of Origins]] (RoO) define traded goods’ eligibility for FTAs’ preferential tariffs regimes. Every FTA sets its own geographical conditions of production for concerned goods. Because of globalization and the development of [[Global value chain|international supply chains]], rules of origins fail to reflect goods’ complex international origins and are often impossible to enforce.
* FTAs are associated with high costs for both governments and firms. To enjoy FTAs’ preferential tariffs, firms need to undergo complex administrative tasks, prove goods’ origins and adapt to FTAs’ many regulations. Thus, FTAs would entail high administrative fixed costs for firms, precluding smaller firms to fully enjoy preferential tariffs, and depleting member-countries’ overall competitiveness.
* While multilateral trade liberalization increases World trades level, FTAs can sometimes be trade-diverting. Bilateral trades surge between two FTAs signatories, however trades with tier-countries are likely to fall. Thus, FTAs lead to both trade creation and diversion.
* Bhagwati, also deplores the lack of political and economic equality characterizing FTA relations. In general, FTAs would be signed between an important economic power, such as the United States or the [[European Union]], with smaller and less powerful countries. The bigger state can use its larger market as a leverage to introduce non-trade related measures concerning regulations, migration, labor standards or the environment. At the opposite, multilateral negotiations would allow for a more equal liberalization since every country can defend its own interests.
* Freer trades are a useful tool for least developed countries to obtain more capital, new technologies and better business practices. However, those countries often offer fewer market and investment opportunities, thus more developed countries will choose to direct their negotiations capacities toward richer regions. In 2017, the European Union had 5 FTAs with Sub-Saharan countries out of a total of 43 FTAs in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/agreements/#_other-countries|title=European Commission Trade Policy|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As developed countries effectively lower trade barriers and tariffs between them, countries at the margin are faced with higher tariffs which are hurtful for their development.
Several empirical studies have been led to determine the Spaghetti Bowl Effect’s true cost on countries’ trade volumes and competitiveness. Japanese Researchers from [[Keio University]], observed 132 countries and established that, even though trade volumes were positively correlated with FTAs, this effect was characterized by diminishing returns.&lt;ref&gt;F. Kimura, A. Kuno, K. Hayakawa. “Does the number of RTAs matter?”, Keio University, 2006. [Online], Available at: https://faculty.washington.edu/karyiu/confer/GJ06/papers/kimura-kuno-hayakawa.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, the increasingly heavy and costly administrative burden caused by the multiplication of FTAs would deter firms to use FTA’s preferential tariffs, thus proving a Spaghetti Bowl Effect.

== The Chow Mein effect ==
Asian countries have seen a dramatic rise in FTAs since the beginning of the 21st century. In 2000, only 3 FTAs were in force, nine years later, 37 FTAs were in force and 72 under negotiations. Important hubs, such as the People’s Republic of China, Japan and the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|Association of South-East Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) emerged. The growing de facto economic integration combined with a lack of common economic institutions has led Asian countries to adopt pro-FTAs trade policies.

As a result, both firms and governments, started to worry about the burden imposed by the Asian trade environment’s growing complication. This phenomenon was nicknamed "''The Noodle Bowl Effect"'' by several newspapers and academics to highlight its endemic Asian nature. In a 2009 survey,&lt;ref&gt;M. Kawai, G. Wignaraja. “The Asian Noodle Bowl: Is it serious for business?”, Working paper serie, Asian Development Bank, 2009. [Online], available at: https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/155991/adbi-wp136.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; only 20.8% of South Korean firms, 29% of Japanese firms and 45.1% of Chinese firms effectively used FTAs . 20% of the surveyed firms across Asia considered multiples rules of origins as costly for their businesses. Smaller firms were also more deterred from using FTAs’ preferential tariffs because of the high and complex administrative burden.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3338">'''Special Needs Tax Credit''' is a proposed addition to the U.S. [[Internal Revenue Service]] tax code, which would enable a $5,000 refundable [[tax credit]] to reimburse family members of adults with [[special needs]] and seniors with [[dementia]] for the legal expenses of guardianship for their loved ones. It would also enable the creation of a [[Special needs trust]] for a person with disabilities. The proposal, initiated by Jaret L. Vogel in 2006, became draft legislation in 2009, and the "Special Needs Tax Credit" Bill was put before the [[United States Congress]] in March 2011.

==Special Needs Adoption Tax Credit==

The [[Adoption tax credit]] has provided tax credits continuously since 1997.  Special needs adoptions qualify for the maximum tax credit even if no qualified adoption expenses are incurred.   Section 36C of the United States [[Internal Revenue Code|Internal Revenue code]] offers a credit for "qualified [[adoption]] expenses" paid or incurred by individual [[taxpayers]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc607.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other special needs tax benefits==

A disabled individual can be claimed as a dependent on the tax return of a family member.  There is no age limit on claiming the disabled individual as an exemption due to the disability.  Head of household status and earned income tax credits are also possible benefits depending on the taxpayers situation.  Medical expenses are also possible itemized deductions available to the taxpayer.

The '''Succession to the Crown Act 1707''' (6 Ann c 41) is an [[Act of Parliament]] of the [[Parliament of Great Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;This Act is chapter 7 in the common printed editions. (See [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/apgb/Ann/6/41/introduction Statute Law Database], "Introduction" note X1.&lt;/ref&gt; It is still partly in force in Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Chronological Table of the Statutes]], 1235–2010. [[The Stationery Office]]. 2011. {{ISBN|978-0-11-840509-6}}. Part I. Page 79, read with pages viii and x.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act was passed at a time when Parliament was anxious to ensure the [[Succession to the British throne|succession]] of a [[Protestant]] on the death of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]. It replaced the [[Regency Act 1705]]. The Act required [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|privy counsellors]] and other officers, in the event of Anne's death, to [[Accession Council|proclaim]] as her successor the next Protestant in the line of succession to the throne, and made it [[high treason]] for any of them to fail to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Section 10&lt;/ref&gt;

If the next monarch was overseas at the time of the succession, the government would be run until he or she returned by between seven and fourteen "Lords Justices." Seven of the Lords Justices were named in the Act, and the next monarch could appoint seven more, who would be named in writing, three copies of which were to be sent to the Privy Council in England.&lt;ref&gt;Sections 12 and 13&lt;/ref&gt; The Act made it treason for any unauthorised person to open these, or to neglect to deliver them to the Privy Council.&lt;ref&gt;Section 14&lt;/ref&gt; The Lords Justices were to have the power to give [[Royal Assent|royal assent]] to bills, except that they would be guilty of treason if they amended the [[Act of Uniformity 1662]] or the [[Protestant Religion and Presbyterian Church Act 1707]].&lt;ref&gt;Section 17&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act also provided that if Parliament was sitting at the time of the monarch's death, then it would be able to sit for a further six months unless dissolved by a new legitimate monarch.&lt;ref name="Constitutional History of the UK"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q-p_mmcOE1IC|title=Constitutional History of the UK|author=Ann Lyon|publisher=Routledge Cavendish|year=2003|pages=279|accessdate=2008-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Section IV&lt;/ref&gt; If the monarch were to die and Parliament was not at that time sitting, then it would immediately convene.&lt;ref&gt;Section V&lt;/ref&gt; These clauses remain in force today (without the six month time limit on Parliament's continued existence, which was repealed in 1878&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/apgb/Ann/6/41/section/IV legislation.org.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;).

The Act also made it treason maliciously, advisedly and directly by writing or printing to maintain and affirm that any person has a right to the Crown otherwise than according to the [[Act of Settlement 1701|Act of Settlement]] and [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]], or that the Crown and Parliament cannot pass statutes for the limitation of the succession to the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;Section 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Treason |volume=27 |page=224 |first=William Feilden |last=Craies}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was [[praemunire]] to say so in speech.&lt;ref&gt;Section 2&lt;/ref&gt; These provisions were extended to Scotland by the [[Treason Act 1708]], and were repealed in 1967 (however see the [[Treason Act 1702]] which makes similar provision).

Anne died on 1 August 1714 and was succeeded as a result of the [[Act of Settlement 1701]] by the Elector of [[Hanover (state)|Hanover]], George Louis, as [[George I of Great Britain|King George I]], who arrived in Great Britain on 18 September 1714.&lt;ref name="Constitutional History of the UK"/&gt;

Sections 1 to 3 were repealed by the [[Criminal Law Act 1967]].&lt;ref&gt;Part I of Schedule 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The whole Act was formally repealed in the [[Republic of Ireland]] by the [[Statute Law Revision Act 2007]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/isbc/preunionbritishstatutes.html|title=Legislation Directory: Statutes of Great Britain (1707–1800)|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=26 February 2015 |quote=1707 (6 Ann.) c. 41 // Succession to the Crown Act 1707 // Repealed // 28/2007, ss. 2, 3 and Schedule 2, Part 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This Act is not to be confused with ''6 Ann. c.14'', which is entitled "An act for the better security of Her Majesty's person and government" but which is not about treason.

The tax legislation of Azerbaijan is comprised by the [[Constitution of Azerbaijan Republic]], the [[Tax code|Tax Code]] and legal standards which are adopted herewith. The taxes levied in Azerbaijan can be generally broken down into 3 main types: state taxes, taxes of autonomy republic and local (municipal) taxes. State taxes include the following: [[personal income tax]], [[corporate tax]], [[Value-added tax|value added tax]], [[Excise Tax|excise tax]], [[property tax]], [[land tax]], [[road tax]], mineral royalty tax and simplified tax. Taxes of autonomy republic are the same as state taxes but levied in Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.taxes.gov.az/modul.php?name=qanun&amp;cat=3&amp;lang=_eng|title=- Legislation|website=Taxes.Gov.Az|language=en|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tax Code of Azerbaijan Republic was approved on 11 July 2000 and consists of two parts. The ''General Part'' indicates the rights and responsibilities of [[taxpayers]], tax agents and tax authorities, procedures of tax registration, tax control and [[audit]]. The second part, also referred to as ''Special Section,'' defines specific taxes and their bases, rates, payment schedules and procedures.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There exist separate taxation procedures for Production Sharing Agreements (PSAs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/taxation/global-forum-on-transparency-and-exchange-of-information-for-tax-purposes-peer-reviews-azerbaijan-2016_9789264266049-en#.WpPkW4NubDc#page1|title=Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes Peer Reviews: Azerbaijan 2016 {{!}} OECD READ edition|website=OECD iLibrary|language=en|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2010, the [[government revenue]]s from taxes started to rise. Thus, in 2014, [[tax revenue]]s as percentage from [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] totaled 14.213%. Highest shares of tax revenues came from [[Value-added tax|value added tax]] and [[Corporate tax|corporate profit taxes]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.taxes.gov.az/modul.php?lang=_eng&amp;name=statistika|title=Data on the receipt of taxes and other payments to the state budget|website=Taxes.Gov.Az|language=en|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, tax revenues as percentage of GDP were equal to 15.6%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/GC.TAX.TOTL.GD.ZS?locations=AZ|title=Tax revenue (% of GDP) {{!}} Data|website=data.worldbank.org|language=en-us|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The central [[executive body]] which provides the implementation and control of [[tax policies]] in the country, collection and transfer of tax payments into the [[government budget]] is Ministry of Taxes of Azerbaijan Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.taxes.gov.az/modul.php?name=haqqinda&amp;lang=_eng|title=History of Ministry of Taxes|website=Taxes.Gov.Az|language=en|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Azerbaijan]], on January 1, 2001, a new tax code went into effect. [[Personal income]] rates remained the same, at rates ranging from 12–35%, as did the corporate tax rate, at 27%. However, as of 2005, the corporate rate was set at 24%. The revised depreciation schedule for corporate assets favors investments in high-tech equipment and oil and gas exploration. Depreciation rates are 10% a year for buildings, 25% a year for equipment and computers, 25% for geological and exploratory costs, and 20% a year for all other assets. However, accelerated depreciation is allowed for capital spending allocated for production purposes at twice the standard rates. Included in this are expenditures on the building of those facilities that are to be used in the actual manufacture of goods. The [[value-added tax]] (VAT) was reduced from 20% to 18%, while the property tax was raised from .5% to 1% of assessed value. A .05% Road Fund Tax on turnover was abolished, but there is a [[highway]] tax imposed on foreign-registered vehicles collected by customs authorities. There are payroll taxes paid by the employer amounting to 32%, 30% going to the Social Protection Fund, and 2% going to the Employment Fund. There are excise taxes, but excise paid for goods used in production can be off set against excise charged for the finished product. In 2001, total government revenue came to an estimated 21.4% of GDP, while total expenditures, including net lending, amounted to only 20% of [[GDP]], producing a positive fiscal balance equal to 1.4% of GDP.

== Tax Regime ==
Currently, Azerbaijan has 3 distinct tax regimes. These are the following: statutory tax regime, tax regime that relates to companies operating under Production Sharing Agreements and tax regime that relates to companies operating under Host Government Agreements.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2017|title=Doing Business and Investing in Azerbaijan|url=https://www.pwc.de/de/internationale-maerkte/assets/doing-business-in-azerbaijan-2017.pdf|journal=PwC|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statutory tax regime is applicable to all companies operating in Azerbaijan, except for those, who are involved into oil and gas industry.

The regime related to Production Sharing Agreements covers the rules for more than twenty existing PSAs. Milli Majlis has ratified these PSAs.

The rules related to Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil export and South Caucasus pipelines are covered by Host Government Agreements tax regime.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The tax declaration has to be filled in and submitted by enterprises no later than 31 March following the [[calendar year]] and users of simplified tax should submit the declaration no later than 20 April. [[Natural person]]s who have stayed in Azerbaijan 182 days in a calendar year are accounted as [[residency (domicile)|residents]] and are responsible for paying the taxes. Residents of Azerbaijan are taxable on their international income, whereas non-residents are taxable on the Azerbaijani source income only.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2297">The '''thick line''' policy ([[Polish language|Polish]]: '''gruba kreska''', ''thick stroke'', or '''gruba linia''', ''thick line'') was the term used by [[prime minister]] of [[Poland]], [[Tadeusz Mazowiecki]], in his first parliamentary speech in [[Sejm]], in 1989.&lt;ref name="americamagazine.org"&gt;Gerald J. Beyer, [http://www.americamagazine.org/content/article.cfm?article_id=4574 "What Ever Became of Solidarity?"] ''[[America (Jesuit magazine)|America]]'' magazine, January 16, 2006.

He said, "We split away the history of our recent past with ''a thick line''. We will be responsible only for what we have done to help extract Poland from her current predicament, from now on". (''Przeszłość odkreślamy '''grubą linią'''. Odpowiadać będziemy jedynie za to, co uczyniliśmy, by wydobyć Polskę z obecnego stanu załamania.'')&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:UN Geneva Human Rights and Alliance of Civilizations Room.jpg|thumb|The meetings of the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] take place in the Human Rights and Alliance of Civilizations Room of the [[Palace of Nations]].]]

'''Special rapporteur''', '''independent expert''', and '''working group member''' are titles given to individuals working on behalf of the [[United Nations]] (UN) within the scope of "special procedure" mechanisms who have a specific country or thematic mandate from the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]]. The term "[[rapporteur]]" is a French-derived word for an investigator who reports to a deliberative body.
 
The mandate by the United Nations has been to "examine, monitor, advise, and publicly report" on human rights problems through  "activities undertaken by special procedures, including responding to individual complaints, psychological operations and manipulation via the controlled media and academia, conducting studies, providing advice on technical cooperation at the country level, and engaging in general promotional activities."&lt;ref name="special-procedures"&gt;"[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/chr/special/index.htm#code Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council]". Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. ohchr.org. Retrieved 2016-10-27.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the manual ''Internal Advisory Procedure to Review Practices and Working Methods'' (25 June 2008) of the Coordination Committee of Special Procedures simply calls these individuals mandate-holders. Other applications of the role include "special representative of the secretary-general" or "independent expert", or a [[working group]] usually composed of five members, one from each region of the planet.

==Appointment authority==
Appointed by the Human Rights Council of the UN, these mandate-holders act independently of governments and as such play an important role in monitoring sovereign nations and democratically elected governments and policies. The earliest such appointment was the 1980 Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances responding to Commission on Human Rights resolution 20&amp;nbsp;(XXXVI). The first Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions reporting to Commission on Human Rights resolution 1982/35 begun work in 1982.
		
They do not receive any financial compensation for their work from the United Nations, though they receive personnel and logistical support from the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] and are often backed by charities and corporations.

To mark [[Human Rights Day]] in 2006, the 37 special rapporteurs, special representatives and independent experts issued a joint statement on the importance of human rights in the fight against poverty.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/SP/Bulletin3.pdf Human Rights Day 2006 (10 December)]". ''Special Procedures Bulletin''. Third issue. September&amp;nbsp;–December 2006. ohchr.org. Retrieved 2016-10-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role description==
Special Rapporteurs often conduct fact-finding missions to countries to investigate allegations of human rights violations. They can only visit countries that have agreed to invite them.

Aside from fact-finding missions, Rapporteurs regularly assess and verify complaints from alleged victims of [[human rights violations]]. Once a complaint is verified as legitimate, an urgent letter or appeal is sent to the government that has allegedly committed the violation. If no complaint has been made, Rapporteurs may intervene on behalf of individuals and groups of people of their own accord.

==Role application==
Thematic special rapporteurs are typically appointed to serve for three years, after which their mandate can be extended for another three years. Country special rapporteurs are appointed to serve for one year, and their term is renewed every year.

==Controversies==
In June 2006, the United Nations Human Rights Council, which replaced the UN Commission on Human Rights, extended the mandates of all special rapporteurs by one year to enable it to conduct a review of the mandates and seek ways of strengthening their roles. However, special rapporteurs for countries which did not approve a special rapporteur came under question and the mandates of the special rapporteurs for Cuba and Belarus were not renewed.

Other controversies between the special rapporteurs and the council include the introduction of a code of conduct which initially disallowed the special rapporteurs from addressing the media. However a compromise was reached and a code of conduct now exists for the special rapporteurs.&lt;ref name="special-procedures"/&gt;

==Current thematic and country mandates==

The HRC oversees 43 thematic and 14 specific country mandates for which it can assign special rapporteurs. Currently there are at least 38 Special Rapporteurs, Special Representatives and Independent Experts who serve under the following country and thematic mandates:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ijrcenter.org/un-special-procedures/ Special Procedures of the UN Human Rights Council] International Justice Resources Center, June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/SP/Pages/Introduction.aspx Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council], United National Human Rights Commission, September 30, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Knight Law Center (University of Oregon).jpg|thumb|right]]
The '''University of Oregon School of Law''' is a public [[law school]] in the U.S. state of [[Oregon]]. Housed in the Knight Law Center, it is Oregon's only state funded law school. The school, founded in 1884, is located on the [[University of Oregon campus]] in [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]], on the corner of 15th and Agate streets, overlooking  [[Hayward Field]].

==History==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2018}}
{{page numbers needed|date= May 2018}}

Oregon Law was founded in 1884 in [[Portland, Oregon]].&lt;ref name=Oregon&gt;Corning, Howard M. (1989) ''Dictionary of Oregon History''. Binfords &amp; Mort Publishing. p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard R. Thornton organized the department that began as a two-year program with three classes per week.&lt;ref name=Horner&gt;Horner, John B. (1919). ''Oregon: Her History, Her Great Men, Her Literature''. The J.K. Gill Co.: Portland. p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, the course of study was expanded to three years, and in April 1915, the school's board of regents ordered that the program be moved to Eugene as part of a consolidation program within the university.&lt;ref name=Horner/&gt; Though the school moved, some of the faculty remained in Portland and started the Northwest College of Law, now the [[Lewis &amp; Clark Law School]].&lt;ref name=Horner/&gt; In 1923, the school was approved by the [[American Bar Association]] (ABA), one of the first 39 schools to earn that distinction in the initial year of the ABA approval of law schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abanet.org/legaled/approvedlawschools/year.html ABA-Approved Law Schools by Year.] American Bar Association. Retrieved on February 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931, [[Wayne Morse]] became dean.&lt;ref name=OL2008&gt;{{cite web|editor-last=Sol|editor-first =Credence|year=2008|url=http://www.law.uoregon.edu/ol/docs/OL2008ann.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526094850/http://www.law.uoregon.edu/ol/docs/OL2008ann.pdf |archivedate=May 26, 2011|title=Oregon Law at 125|work=2008 Oregon Lawyer ANNUAL|pages=16–20|publisher=University of Oregon School of Law|format=PDF|accessdate=2014-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, the law school organized a chapter of the national law school honor society, the [[Order of the Coif]].&lt;ref name=OL2008/&gt; In 1938, the law school moved to Fenton Hall.&lt;ref name=OL2008/&gt; In 1939, the law school graduated [[Minoru Yasui]], who later took his challenge to the military curfew on Japanese Americans during World War II all the way to the [[United States Supreme Court]].&lt;ref name=OL2008/&gt;

In 1941, Orlando John Hollis became acting dean.&lt;ref name=OL2008/&gt; His appointment became permanent in 1945 when Morse resigned to run for the U.S. Senate.&lt;ref name=OL2008/&gt; During the war years, many law students were called to service.&lt;ref name=OL2008/&gt; In 1944, there were no graduating students; in 1945, only one student graduated.&lt;ref name=OL2008/&gt; After the war's conclusion, the school admitted every returning veteran who sought a legal education: out of 26 students who graduated in 1948, 25 had served in World War II.&lt;ref name=OL2008/&gt;

The post-war era was marked by the Oregon legislature's adoption of law professor [[Kenneth O'Connell]]'s Oregon Revised Statutes.&lt;ref name=OL2008/&gt; Professor O'Connell was appointed to the [[Oregon Supreme Court]] in 1958, and later became its chief justice.&lt;ref name=OL2008/&gt;

During the 1960s, Professor (and later dean) Chapin Clark offered the school's first courses in environmental and natural resources law.&lt;ref name=OL2008/&gt; Later that decade, Professor Jon Jacobson founded the school's Ocean and Coastal Law Center.&lt;ref name=OL2008/&gt; In 1968, Eugene Scoles became dean.&lt;ref name=OL2008/&gt;

In 1970, the law school moved into a new building, the Law Center.&lt;ref name=OL2008/&gt; In 1974, the Wayne Morse Chair of Law and Politics was established as a "living memorial" to former dean and U.S. Senator Wayne Morse.&lt;ref name=OL2008/&gt;{{rp|19}} In 1977, Professor [[Hans A. Linde]] was appointed to the Oregon Supreme Court.&lt;ref name=OL2008/&gt; In 1978, the school established the first-in-the-world Environmental Law Clinic.&lt;ref name=OL2008/&gt;

During the 1980s, the Environmental Law Clinic doubled in size and was renamed the Pacific Northwest Natural Resources Clinic.&lt;ref name=OL2008/&gt; In 1981, Professor [[Dave Frohnmayer]] became [[Oregon Attorney General]].&lt;ref name=OL2008/&gt; In 1982, students organized the first [[Public Interest Environmental Law Conference]].&lt;ref name=OL2008/&gt; In 1986, the ''[[Journal of Environmental Law and Litigation]]'' began publication.&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Axline, ''Forward'', 1 {{smallcaps|J. Envtl. L. &amp; Litig.}} vii (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the new century, the school opened the Appropriate Dispute Resolution Program.&lt;ref name=OL2008/&gt; In 2003, the Environmental and Natural Resources Law Program opened a fully staffed office.&lt;ref name=OL2008/&gt; In 2004, the Center for Law and Entrepreneurship opened a Small Business Clinic to assist small and micro-businesses.&lt;ref name=OL2008/&gt; The school also has started a program in Portland, which moved into Portland's [[White Stag Building]] in 2008.&lt;ref name=OL2008/&gt; The Portland Program focuses on business law and related externships.&lt;ref name=OL2008/&gt;

==Public Interest Environmental Law Conference==
The Public Interest Environmental Law Conference (PIELC) is a conference held annually on the first weekend in March at the University of Oregon School of Law in [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]], [[Oregon]], [[United States]].  The conference is a gathering of [[Environmentalism|environmental activists]], advocates, and students from across the United States and the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=PIELC website|url=http://www.pielc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PIELC is organized and hosted by the students involved in the environmental law society "Land Air Water" (LAW). Land Air Water is a student group at the University of Oregon School of Law. It is co-sponsored by Friends of Land Air Water, a University of Oregon/Land Air Water [[alumni]] group that helps advise the student organizers.

The conference has six to ten internationally recognized keynote addresses and over 120 panels. The conference has been held since 1983 and celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=30 Years of PIELC|url=http://www.eugeneweekly.com/2012/03/01/coverstory.html|accessdate=2012-03-03|newspaper=Eugene Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conference is held on the first weekend in March. Early panels start Thursday afternoon, and the official opening is Thursday evening. It closes with a final address Sunday at noon. Typically the conference has around 2,000 attendees.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

The content of the conference is aimed at professional environmental activists, such as people that work in [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]] [[public interest]] organizations such as the [[The Wilderness Society (United States)|Wilderness Society]], the [[Sierra Club]], and the Oregon Natural Desert Association and public interest environmental attorneys like Earthjustice, Natural Resources Defense Council, and private public interest attorneys. [[Continuing Legal Education|CLE]] credits are available.

The conference is also of interest to students of [[environmental law]] and [[environmental studies]], and each year it hosts groups from around a dozen different schools.

The conference is unapologetically pro-public interest, and pro-environment. It does not attempt to persuade the general public that environmental issues matter. It is a forum for the people who are actively enforcing environmental law, and promoting environmental values to talk among themselves, and share experiences, strategies, and news.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

The '''Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974''' (or '''VEVRAA''', {{USC|38|4212}}) is an [[Act of Congress]] in reference to [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]-era veterans, disabled veterans, and any other veterans who served active duty time in a war event that qualifies for a campaign badge.

==Overview==
The law requires that employers with federal contracts or subcontracts of $150,000 or more provide [[equal opportunity]] and [[affirmative action]] for Vietnam-era veterans, special disabled veterans, and veterans who served on active duty during a war or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized.

If covered by the act, a veteran who believes to have been discriminated against may file a complaint, which can be filed with the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs or with a local Veteran's Employment Representative at the local state employment services office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dol.gov/compliance/laws/comp-vevraa.htm U.S. Department of Labor website] - Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act compliance info&lt;/ref&gt;

A Vietnam era veteran is a person who:
* Served on active duty for a period of more than 180 days, any part of which occurred between August 5, 1964 and May 7, 1975, and was discharged or released with other than a dishonorable discharge;
* Was discharged or released from active duty for a service connected disability if any part of such active duty was performed between August 5, 1964 and May 7, 1975; or
* Served on active duty for more than 180 days and served in the Republic of Vietnam between February 28, 1961 and May 7, 1975.

A special disabled veteran is a person who is entitled to compensation under laws administered by the [[US Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] for a disability rated at 30 percent or more. That changes to 10 or 20 percent if it has been determined that the individual has a serious employment disability or for a person who was discharged or released from active duty because of a service-connected disability.

As a part of affirmative action, federal contractors and subcontractors are required to list with the local state employment service all employment openings except for executive and top management jobs, jobs which the contractor expects to fill from within, and jobs lasting 3 days or less.

== Overview ==
Visual Compliance offers modular software-as-a-service [[solution]]s that allow subscribed users to submit names of their trade chain partners - either online, by batches, or integrated into existing business systems - to be screened automatically against mandatory Restricted and Denied Parties lists maintained by the United States Government and its allies (European Union; Japan, etc.), world organizations (United Nations; World Bank, etc.), and law enforcement agencies (Interpol; FBI; Scotland Yard, etc.). These lists prevent business dealings with parties (individuals and organizations) deemed as blocked, restricted, or denied by Governments, world organizations and law enforcement bodies.
In addition, it allows for Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) and United States Munitions List (USML) Determination, License and License Activity Management and travelling employee and visitor compliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Denied Party Screening, BIS, OFAC, USML - eCustoms Visual Compliance|url = http://www.visualcompliance.com|website = www.visualcompliance.com|access-date = 2016-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wiley Blount Rutledge Jr.''' (July 20, 1894&amp;nbsp;– September 10, 1949) was an [[United States|American]] educator and [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|justice]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] (1943–49).

==Early life and education==
Rutledge was born in [[Cloverport, Kentucky]] (more specifically, at nearby Tar Springs) to Wiley Blount Rutledge Sr. (d. 1944), a [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptist]] minister,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Justice Rutledge's Father Dies |author= |newspaper=The New York Times |date=7 July 1944 |page= |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1944/07/07/87457661.pdf |accessdate=21 May 2011 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mary Lou Wigginton Rutledge (d. 1903). After a brother died in infancy, Wiley's sister Margaret was born in 1897. His family moved about while he was young.

He attended [[Maryville College]] and then the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], graduating from there in 1914. Rutledge taught high school in [[Indiana]] while attending the present-day [[Indiana University Maurer School of Law]] part-time. He later moved to [[Colorado]], and received a degree from the [[University of Colorado Law School]] in [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]]. While matriculating at Colorado, Rutledge joined the Pi Chapter of [[Alpha Sigma Phi|Alpha Sigma Phi Fraternity]].

==Marriage and family==
The year he graduated from law school, on August 28, 1917, Rutledge married Annabel Person. The couple had three children: Mary Lou (1922), Jean Ann (1925), and Neal (1927).&lt;ref name=NYTobit&gt;{{Cite news |last=Staff |first= |date=September 11, 1949 |title=Justice Wiley Rutledge Dies of Brain Hemorrhage at 55 |url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1949/09/11/issue.html |newspaper=The New York Times |location=New York |publisher=The New York Times Co. |accessdate=January 18, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rutledge was the great-great-grandson of [[Edward Rutledge]], signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.geni.com/people/Wiley-Blount-Rutledge-Associate-Justice-of-the-U-S-Supreme-Court/6000000013196148439&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Rutledge's brother, [[John Rutledge]], was twice nominated by [[George Washington|President George Washington]] to the United States Supreme Court.

==Career==
Rutledge worked in private practice in Boulder for a few years before deciding to pursue an academic career. He taught law at the [[University of Colorado]] (1924–26) and at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] 1926–30 and was Dean 1930–35, where the Wiley Rutledge Moot Court competition is named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.wustl.edu/TAP/index.asp?id=902 |title=WULS: Trial and Advocacy Program; Moot Court Competitions; Wiley Rutledge Moot Court |publisher=Law.wustl.edu |accessdate=October 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT1939/&gt; He was named Dean of the [[University of Iowa College of Law]] in 1935.&lt;ref name=NYT1939/&gt; From this position, Rutledge was a vocal supporter of [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Franklin Roosevelt's]] plan to [[Judiciary Reorganization Bill of 1937|pack the Supreme Court]].

==Judicial career==
Roosevelt appointed Rutledge to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] in 1939.&lt;ref name=NYT1939&gt;{{Cite news |title=Rutledge Named To Appeals Court |author= |newspaper=The New York Times |date=22 March 1939 |location= |page= |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1939/03/22/archives/rutledge-named-to-appeals-court-roosevelt-sends-iowa-deans-name-to.html?sq=Wiley%2520Rutledge&amp;scp=37&amp;st=cse |accessdate=21 May 2011 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When Supreme Court justice [[James F. Byrnes]] resigned in the fall of 1942 to help supervise wartime mobilization, Roosevelt nominated Rutledge to his position.&lt;ref name=Leuchtenburg220&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Supreme Court Reborn |last=Leuchtenburg |first=William E. |year=1995 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford; New York |isbn=0-19-508613-9 |page=220 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KguJFHdmP6MC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+supreme+court+reborn&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=F4LZTbGaJMHW0QG3x9H7Aw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=21 May 2011 |&lt;!--quote=...when Byrnes left the bench to supervise wartime mobilization, he named the much more liberal Wiley B. Rutledge of Iowa.--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rutledge was significantly less conservative than Byrnes and he remained a steady ally of Roosevelt throughout his court career.&lt;ref name=Leuchtenburg220/&gt;

Rutledge articulated strong liberal positions, particularly in his interpretation of the [[due process]] clause of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. He wrote for the court in 1946 in ''Kotteakos v. United States'' that "our Government is not one of mere convenience or efficiency. It too has a stake, with every citizen, in his being afforded our historic individual protections, including those surrounding criminal trials. About them we dare not become careless or complacent when that fashion has become rampant over the earth."&lt;ref&gt;[http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/328/750/case.html Kotteakos v. United States - 328 U.S. 750 (1946)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rutledge extended this position to dissent from the Court's decision in ''Yamashita v. Styer'', in which Japanese general [[Tomoyuki Yamashita]] filed for ''[[habeas corpus]]'' to appeal his conviction for [[war crime]]s in World War II.  He wrote:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/ihl-nat.nsf/46707c419d6bdfa24125673e00508145/1d4c8a391cc93c38c1256d1700575bb2!OpenDocument Yamashita v. Styer decision.]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|More is at stake than General Yamashita's fate. There could be no possible sympathy for him if he is guilty of the atrocities for which his death is sought. But there can be and should be justice administered according to the law ... It is not too early, it is never too early, for the nation steadfastly to follow its great constitutional traditions, none older or more universally protective against unbridled power than due process of law in the trial and punishment of men, that is, of all men, whether citizens, aliens, alien enemies or enemy belligerents.||W.B. Rutledge}}

According to [[Justice Frankfurter]], Rutledge was part of the more liberal "axis" of justices on the Court, along with Justices [[Frank Murphy|Murphy]], [[William O. Douglas|Douglas]], and [[Hugo Black|Black]]; the group would for years oppose Frankfurter's ideology of judicial restraint.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Howard. ''Hugo L. Black: Cold Steel Warrior''. Oxford University Press. 2006. {{ISBN|0-19-507814-4}}. Page 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas, Murphy, and then Rutledge were the first justices to agree with Black's notion that the Fourteenth Amendment [[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|incorporated the Bill of Rights protection]] into it; this view would later become law.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Howard. ''Hugo L. Black: Cold Steel Warrior''. Oxford University Press. 2006. {{ISBN|0-19-507814-4}}. pp. 212–213.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rutledge served on the court until his death. On August 27, 1949, Rutledge was vacationing in Maine. He had a stroke while driving his car and died two weeks later, aged fifty-five.&lt;ref name=NYTobit/&gt;&lt;ref name=APobit&gt;{{Cite news |last=Staff |first= |agency=[[Associated Press|AP]] |date=September 12, 1949 |title=Justice's Death Blamed on Overwork |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-nxIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=SWoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1290,4353645&amp;dq=wiley+rutledge+dies&amp;hl=en |newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |location=Pittsburgh, PA |publisher= |accessdate=January 18, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His remains are interred at Green Mountain Cemetery in [[Boulder, Colorado]].&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;{{Cite book|editor-last=Hall |editor-first=Kermit L. |title=The Oxford Companion to the Supreme Court of the United States |page=877 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1992 |location=New York |isbn=0-19-505835-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Rutledge's [[law clerk|law]] [[List of law clerks of the Supreme Court of the United States#Wiley Blount Rutledge|clerks]], [[John Paul Stevens]], was appointed to the Supreme Court in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Toobin, [http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/03/22/100322fa_fact_toobin "After Stevens"], ''The New Yorker'', March 22, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; His tenure on the Court influenced Justice Stevens, who had helped Rutledge draft his dissent in ''[[Ahrens v. Clark]]''. In 1948, a 6-3 majority of the Supreme Court ruled that unless detained persons are within the physical jurisdiction of the District Court when they petition for a [[writ of habeas corpus]], that court has no jurisdiction to hear the case. Rutledge dissented, arguing that instead of the jurisdiction deriving from the location of the prisoner, it should instead derive from the custodian, the person responsible for the imprisonment. John Paul Stevens later tracked this case and its application to case law. In 1973, the Supreme Court substantially overturned ''Ahrens'', ruling similarly to how Rutledge would have. Justice Rutledge's views were formally endorsed by the Supreme Court in 2004, when Justice John Stevens ruled in ''[[Rasul v. Bush]]'' that courts were to consider the location of the custodian, rather than the physical location of the prisoner themselves. This ruling allowed detainees in Guantanamo Bay to sue in the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia]] for a writ of habeas corpus.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.oyez.org/cases/2003/03-334&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/335/188/case.html&lt;/ref&gt;

While on vacation in York, Maine, he died of a stroke while driving a car.&lt;ref&gt;https://constitutionallawreporter.com/us-supreme-court-justices/wiley-blount-rutledge/&lt;/ref&gt;

The youth justice system in [[New Zealand]] comprises organs and processes that deal with offending by children aged 10–13 years and young people aged 14–16 years. These differ from general criminal processes, and are governed by different principles.

== Law governing child and youth justice ==

=== Historical context ===
New Zealand has historically focused on a welfare model for youth offenders, which put the child's needs at the forefront. This often involved taking the child away from their family and by putting them into institutions.

The [[Children, Young Persons, and Their Families Act 1989]] (CYPTFA) signified a shift away from this to a family-based process and justice model, which views state intervention as a last resort. The argument supporting this was that the community needed to be kept together, and these ties were important for helping youth.

=== Current domestic context ===
New Zealand legislation differentiates justice processes for under-17-year-olds.
The CYPTFA governs these processes.&lt;ref&gt;Children, Young Persons, and Their Families Act 1989, Part 4 and 5.&lt;/ref&gt; They are diversion-focused, and include the dual aim of rehabilitation and accountability.

Other legislation is also relevant, particularly the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 ([[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990|NZBORA]]). This includes a child's right to be dealt with in a manner that takes into account their age.&lt;ref&gt;New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, s. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Overview of CYPTFA ====
The CYPTFA creates two separate justice processes for children and youth. This differentiation is based on the attitude that younger people are more vulnerable and have a more immature judgment, and this should be accounted for. The different processes recognise the child or youth's offending in a manner that acknowledges their higher needs and vulnerability. Thus, levels of culpability are determined by age group. However, major legislative changes now allow children to be prosecuted if the crime is sufficiently severe.&lt;ref&gt;Children, Young Persons, and Their Families Act 1989, s. 272.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act aims to promote the well-being of children, young persons and their families. The process is aimed to reduce the levels of youth incarceration and constructively deal with issues and problems created by youth and children.&lt;ref&gt;Her Honour Judge Carolyn Henwood "The Children, Young Persons and Their Families Act 1989 (NZ) – A Judicial Perspective in 1997", Address on 22 July 1997 at Judicial Commission of New South Wales Seminar Series, published (1998) TJR 215, 215.&lt;/ref&gt; This is done by holding the child or young person accountable for their behaviour and encouraging them to accept responsibility for their offending, while taking into account their needs and ensuring they are given the chance to develop beneficially from the experience.

==== Principles from CYPTFA ====
Principles governing youth justice reflect different objectives from traditional criminal prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;Children, Young Persons, and Their Families Act 1989, s. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; These are:
*  Avoidance of criminal proceedings when possible;
*  Criminal proceedings are not to be used as a means of delivering welfare;
*  Strengthening family and whanau;
*  Keeping children and young persons in the community;
*  Age as a mitigating factor;
*  Sanctions should promote young person’s development within family and whanau, and be least restrictive in form;
*  Regard for victims interests; and
*  Special provisions to address vulnerability of children and young persons.

==== Definitions – Child and youth ====
A child under the age of ten cannot be convicted of an offence.&lt;ref&gt;Crimes Act 1961, s. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; If the child is aged 10 or 11, they can be prosecuted for murder or manslaughter. If the offender is aged 12 or 13, they can only be prosecuted for an offence if the maximum penalty is 14 years imprisonment or more, or if the maximum penalty is 10 years imprisonment or more if they are a repeat offender and the previous offence had a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment or more.&lt;ref&gt;Children, Young Persons, and Their Families Act 1989, section 272&lt;/ref&gt; All children aged between 10 and 13 have a [[rebuttable presumption]] of incapacity to commit a crime.&lt;ref&gt;Crimes Act 1961, s. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Young persons aged 14 to 16 may be prosecuted for any crime, unless a higher age limit is stated in the specific legislation (e.g. people under 16 cannot be convicted of [[incest]]).

If the child is brought within the court system, the judge has a discretion to not use the criminal process and direct them towards social welfare.&lt;ref&gt;Crimes Act 1961, s. 280(a).&lt;/ref&gt;

When the child offender does not fall into these categories, they are dealt with under the care and protection provisions of CYPTFA, or by the police, which are governed by youth justice principles.&lt;ref&gt;Children, Young Persons, and Their Families Act 1989, s. 280.&lt;/ref&gt;

If between 14 and 17, the court will have regard to the age of the offender.&lt;ref&gt;Crimes Act 1961, s. 9(2)(a).&lt;/ref&gt; If the crime is dealt with in the Youth Court, then the Youth Justice Act and youth principles will apply. However the offender can be sent to the District Court or High Court for sentencing or trial, where the [[Sentencing Act 2002]] applies. Under the Sentencing Act 2002, a child or young person under 17 cannot be sentenced to prison or home detention unless they commit a Category 4 offence (e.g. murder, manslaughter, crimes against the State) or an offence where the maximum penalty is 14 years imprisonment or more.

=== International context ===
There are several international conventions that affect youth justice, most significantly the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child 1990 [[United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child|(UNCROC)]], which New Zealand ratified in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.govt.nz/policy/constitutional-law-and-human-rights/human-rights/international-human-rights-instruments/international-human-rights-instruments-1/united-nations-convention-on-the-rights-of-the-child |title=Archived copy |accessdate=1 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727082125/http://www.justice.govt.nz/policy/constitutional-law-and-human-rights/human-rights/international-human-rights-instruments/international-human-rights-instruments-1/united-nations-convention-on-the-rights-of-the-child |archivedate=27 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This requires New Zealand to submit regular reports on the status of children's rights. The latest UN recommendations in response to this has expressed concern about the low age of criminal responsibility, and that NZ has lowered it from 14 to 12 for grave and repeated offences.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hrc.co.nz/international-human-rights-new/new-zealands-international-obligations/united-nations-convention-on-the-rights-of-the-child/&lt;/ref&gt; There is also concern that CYPTFA only extends youth justice protections to 17 years, where UNCROC has defined a "child" up unto 18 years. Once young people turn 17, they are dealt with in adult courts, although age can be taken as a mitigating factor.&lt;ref&gt;Becroft, Andrew J.'Children and Young People in Conflict with the Law: Asking the Hard Questions' in Juvenile and Family Court Journal, Issue 4 Fall 2006, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Children and young persons justice processes ==
CYPTFA established an alternative system of dealing with child and youth offenders through Family Group Conferences [[Family Group Conference|(FGC)]] and the Youth Court, with the exception of non-imprisonable traffic offences in the case of young persons.
This is combined with various policies employed by the police to decrease the use of the [[District Courts of New Zealand|court system]] when possible.

=== Family Group Conferences ===
The first step is the FGC, which is used as both a pre- and post-charge mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;Children, Young Persons, and Their Families Act 1989, s. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; They are designed to encourage collaborative decision-making by all affected parties, reflecting Maori custom.&lt;ref&gt;McElrea, F. 'Restorative Justice. The New Zealand Youth Court: A Model for Development in Other Courts?' at National Conference of District Court Judges, April 1994, Rotorua.&lt;/ref&gt; Their purpose is to provide recommendation and make decisions that are thought to be "necessary or desirable in relation to the child or young person in respect of whom the conference was convened".&lt;ref&gt;Children, Young Persons, and Their Families Act 1989, s. 260.&lt;/ref&gt; If a unanimous decision is not reached, the case can go to the youth court judge.

Pre-charge FGCs account for 40% of FGCs, and are employed to determine whether prosecution can be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.justice.govt.nz/courts/youth/about-the-youth-court/family-group-conference&lt;/ref&gt; Post-charge, they determine how to deal with cases admitted or proved in the Youth Court.

==== Criticisms ====
There is limited data on the effectiveness of FGCs.

The focus on the family has been criticised as sometimes resulting in a tension between promoting the child’s development while also addressing underlying causes for their offending, such as their family. The system may not work well for those who come from dysfunctional families, as youth justice principles aim to keep the child with their family, but this is on the assumption that the family has the ability and the interest to control young people and believes offending is not acceptable. For young people such as these, the youth justice system may be better able to provide guidance.&lt;ref&gt;Braithwaite, J. 'What is to be Done About Criminal Justice?' in B J Brown &amp; F W M McElrea (eds.) The Youth Court in New Zealand: A New Model of Justice, Legal Research Foundation, Auckland (1993), p. 32-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Police role ===
Police play a major role in youth justice, and such cases are governed by the principle that criminal proceedings should not be used if there is an alternative way of dealing with the offending. This means that most child and youth apprehensions are dismissed by way of police warning, cautions, or diversion. 62% of youth crime is handled by police without moving onward to FGCs or Youth Court. Police have two statutory alternatives to the formal criminal justice process.&lt;ref&gt;Children, Young Persons, and Their Families Act 1989, s. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Police warnings ====
Police officers are able to issue a warning where appropriate and consider that sufficient. There will be written notice of the warning. Warnings may be issued when the police officer is satisfied the person is guilty, but do not need an admission of guilt.

Warnings have been criticised as they may end up on the youth’s record regardless of whether the young person is guilty or not. Additionally, it may label them as acting with criminal behaviour when they did nothing.

==== Formal police cautions ====
These are a more formal alternative to warnings.&lt;ref&gt;Children, Young Persons, and Their Families Act 1989, s. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; This follows the Family Group Conference approach, and is one of the possible outcomes.

==== Diversions ====
This is a possible police option and is widely used for minor child and youth offending. This is a discretionary response and offers a lot of flexibility to the Police Youth Aid who administers it. Practical examples of potential actions are:
* an apology to the victim,
* restitution or reparation,
* possible curfew,
* maintenance of school attendance,
* completing an assignment on the effects of their offending; and
* sometimes permitting the police to take and keep photographs or fingerprints on file.

There is no need for a FGC, and the process considers a number of criteria.
Using identity evidence as a bargaining tool has been questioned, as usually police are not able to hold such information unless the offender has been questioned.

=== Criticisms of the relationship between FGC and the police ===
The relationship between FGC and police diversion has been questioned. Diversion challenges the primacy of FGCs, as 62% of cases do not get to FGCs, and are instead dealt with by the police.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Chong "Youth Justice Statistics in New Zealand: 1992 to 2006" (Prepared for Ministry of Justice) Table 3.12.&lt;/ref&gt; The police refer around 6% of cases to FGCs, and outcomes here are agreed and implemented, typically without referral to the Court. The other 29% of cases involve youths being arrested and directly referred to the Youth Court, who have an obligation to refer all proved cases under its jurisdiction to a FGC for a recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Chong "Youth Justice Statistics in New Zealand: 1992 to 2006" (Prepared for Ministry of Justice) Table 3.12.&lt;/ref&gt; The reasoning for this is unclear, but it is questioned if it is useful to divert and keep the youth out of the system, or if this process is undermining the process and role of the family.

Police motives are also questioned. It is argued that police are avoiding FGCs because either they want to keep people out of the system or they do not trust it as an option.

=== Youth Court ===
The Youth Court is less formal than other courts, and the judge is more active in explaining the procedure as well as gathering data. The punishments are less severe, and are grouped depending on their restrictiveness into seven categories.&lt;ref&gt;Children, Young Persons, and Their Families Act 1989, s. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; The court has a stronger focus on restorative justice, reflected in the involvement of the victims, the young person's understanding and co-operation in the proceedings, acknowledgement of the power imbalanced by proving all young people with a lawyer, and the restorative justice outcomes promoted.&lt;ref&gt;Becroft, A. 'Restorative Justice in the Youth Court: A Square Peg in a Round Hole?' in Restorative Justice Online (May 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Youth Court is a subdivision of the [[District Courts of New Zealand|District Court]] and has the same general status and powers. Youth Court decisions are appealed to the [[High Court of New Zealand|High Court]].&lt;ref&gt;Children, Young Persons, and Their Families Act 1989, section 351&lt;/ref&gt;

== Youth offending trends ==
Youth are over-represented in the criminal justice system. Young people aged 14–16 account for around 15% of all police arrests, which is second only to 17- to 20-year-olds.&lt;ref&gt;Jin Chong, ''Youth Justice Statistics in New Zealand: 1992 to 2006'', table 3.2.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the number of apprehensions is decreasing.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Justice, 'Trends in Child and Youth Prosecutions in New Zealand 2002–2011' (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

The number and rate of youth appearing in court is also declining, with only the most serious cases reaching court. Nearly 80% of child and youth cases are dealt with by FGCs or police alternative actions, including diversions, before reaching court.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Justice, 'Trends in Child and Youth Prosecutions in New Zealand 2002–2011' (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Characteristics of youth offenders ===

==== Gender ====
In line with adult statistics, the majority of youth appearing in court are male. While the rate of males appearing in court has substantially decreased in recent years, they still account for 79% of young people appearing in court.

The rate of females appearing in court has also decreased; however it is less marked that males.

==== Ethnicity ====
While the number of children and young people recorded as Māori has decreased, they are still over-represented in court. Around 20 percent of the youth population is Māori, yet Māori account for 54% of all children and youth in court.

The number of children and young people recorded as European appearing in court has decreased most substantially. Between 2002 and 2011, the rate dropped by 18%.

'''Zigbee''' is an [[IEEE 802.15.4]]-based [[specification (technical standard)|specification]] for a suite of high-level communication protocols used to create [[personal area network]]s with small, low-power [[digital radio]]s, such as for home automation, medical device data collection, and other low-power low-bandwidth needs, designed for small scale projects which need wireless connection. Hence, Zigbee is a low-power, low data rate, and close proximity (i.e., personal area) [[wireless ad hoc network]].

The technology defined by the Zigbee specification is intended to be simpler and less expensive than other [[wireless personal area network]]s (WPANs), such as [[Bluetooth]] or more general wireless networking such as [[Wi-Fi]]. Applications include wireless light switches, [[home energy monitor]]s, traffic management systems, and other consumer and industrial equipment that requires short-range low-rate wireless data transfer.

Its low power consumption limits transmission distances to 10–100&amp;nbsp;meters [[Line-of-sight propagation|line-of-sight]], depending on power output and environmental characteristics.&lt;ref name="specs"&gt;{{cite web|title=ZigBee Specification FAQ|url=http://www.zigbee.org/Specifications/ZigBee/FAQ.aspx|work=Zigbee Alliance|accessdate=14 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627172453/http://www.zigbee.org/Specifications/ZigBee/FAQ.aspx|archivedate=27 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zigbee devices can transmit data over long distances by passing data through a [[Mesh networking|mesh network]] of intermediate devices to reach more distant ones. Zigbee is typically used in low data rate applications that require long battery life and secure networking (Zigbee networks are secured by 128 bit [[Symmetric-key algorithm|symmetric encryption]] keys.) Zigbee has a defined rate of 250&amp;nbsp;kbit/s, best suited for intermittent data transmissions from a sensor or input device.

Zigbee was conceived in 1998, standardized in 2003, and revised in 2006. The name refers to the [[waggle dance]] of honey bees after their return to the beehive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eetimes.com/design/embedded-internet-design/4201087/ZigBee-applications--Part-1-Sending-and-receiving-data/ "ZigBee Wireless Networking"], Drew Gislason (via EETimes)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Zigbee is a low-cost, low-power, [[wireless mesh network]] standard targeted at battery-powered devices in wireless control and monitoring applications. Zigbee delivers low-latency communication. Zigbee chips are typically integrated with radios and with microcontrollers. Zigbee operates in the industrial, scientific and medical ([[ISM band|ISM]]) radio bands: 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz in most jurisdictions worldwide; though some devices also use 784&amp;nbsp;MHz in China, 868&amp;nbsp;MHz in Europe and 915&amp;nbsp;MHz in the USA and Australia, however even those regions and countries still use 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz for most commercial Zigbee devices for home use.  Data rates vary from 20&amp;nbsp;kbit/s (868&amp;nbsp;MHz band) to 250&amp;nbsp;kbit/s (2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz band).

Zigbee builds on the [[physical layer]] and [[media access control]] defined in [[IEEE 802.15.4|IEEE standard 802.15.4]] for low-rate wireless personal area networks (WPANs). The specification includes four additional key components: network layer, application layer, ''Zigbee Device Objects'' (ZDOs) and manufacturer-defined application objects.  ZDOs are responsible for some tasks, including keeping track of device roles, managing requests to join a network, as well as device discovery and security.

The Zigbee [[network layer]] natively supports both [[Star network|star]] and [[Tree network|tree]] networks, and generic [[mesh networks|mesh networking]]. Every network must have one coordinator device. Within star networks, the coordinator must be the central node. Both trees and meshes allow the use of Zigbee [[Routing|routers]] to extend communication at the network level.  Another defining feature of Zigbee is facilities for carrying out secure communications, protecting establishment and transport of cryptographic keys, ciphering frames, and controlling device. It builds on the basic security framework defined in IEEE 802.15.4.

== History ==
Zigbee-style self-organizing [[Wireless ad hoc network|ad-hoc digital radio networks]] were conceived in the 1990s. The IEEE 802.15.4-2003 Zigbee specification was ratified on December 14, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=ZigBee Document 053474r06, Version 1.0, ZigBee Specification |year=2004 |publisher = Zigbee Alliance}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Zigbee Alliance announced availability of Specification 1.0 on June 13, 2005, known as the ''Zigbee 2004 Specification''.

=== Cluster library ===
In September 2006, the ''Zigbee 2006 Specification'' was announced, obsoleting the 2004 stack&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ieee802.org/15/pub/TG4.html |title=IEEE 802.15.4 |publisher= IEEE | accessdate=2012-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2006 specification replaces the Message/[[Key Value Pair]] structure used in the 2004 stack with a ''cluster library''. The library is a set of standardised commands, organised under groups known as clusters with names such as ''Smart Energy'', ''Home Automation'', ''Zigbee Light Link''.&lt;ref name="nxp"&gt;{{Citation | title = User manual | publisher = NXP | format = [[Portable document format|PDF]] | url = http://www.nxp.com/documents/user_manual/JN-UG-3077.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017 Zigbee Alliance renamed the library to ''Dotdot'' and announced it as a new protocol to be represented by an emoticon ''||:'' They also announced it will now additionally run over other network types using [[Internet Protocol]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/01/04/zigbee_announces_dotdot_app_layer/|title=Dotdot.

Yet another IoT app layer|last=Corfield|first=Gareth|last2=|first2=|date=4 Jan 2017|website=[[The Register]]|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and will interconnect with other standards such as [[Thread (network protocol)|Thread]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://electronicdesign.com/communications/zigbee-dotdot-dashes-unify-connectivity-stacks|title=ZigBee DotDot Dashes to Unify Connectivity Stacks|website=electronicdesign.com|language=en|access-date=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Zigbee PRO ===
Zigbee PRO, also known as Zigbee 2007, was finalized in 2007.  A Zigbee PRO device may join and operate on a legacy Zigbee network and vice versa.  Due to differences in routing options, Zigbee PRO devices must become non-routing Zigbee end devices (ZEDs) on a legacy Zigbee network, and legacy Zigbee devices must become ZEDs on a Zigbee PRO network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=zigbee vs zigbee PRO-difference between zigbee and zigbee PRO|url=http://www.rfwireless-world.com/Terminology/zigbee-vs-zigbee-PRO.html|website=rfwireless-world.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It operates on not only the 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz band, but also the sub-GHz band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ZigBee Pro |url=https://www.zigbee.org/zigbee-for-developers/zigbee-pro/ |website=ZigBee |accessdate=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use cases ==
Zigbee protocols are intended for embedded applications requiring [[Low-power electronics|low power consumption]] and tolerating low [[Bit rate|data rates]]. The resulting network will use very little power—individual devices must have a battery life of at least two years to pass Zigbee certification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microcontroller.com/news/atmel_microcontrollers_avr.asp] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061213103105/http://www.microcontroller.com/news/atmel_microcontrollers_avr.asp |date=December 13, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]--&gt;

Zigbee is not for situations with high mobility among nodes. Hence, it is not suitable for tactical ad hoc radio networks in the battlefield, where high data rate and high mobility is present and needed. 

== Standard and profiles ==
Established in 2002, the Zigbee Alliance is a group of companies that maintain and publish the Zigbee standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zigbee.org/About/AboutAlliance/TheAlliance.aspx |title=The ZigBee Alliance |publisher=Zigbee |accessdate=2012-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920003423/http://www.zigbee.org/About/AboutAlliance/TheAlliance.aspx |archivedate=2012-09-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term '''Zigbee''' is a registered [[trademark]] of this group, not a single technical standard. The Alliance publishes [[application profile]]s that allow multiple [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]] vendors to create interoperable products. The relationship between [[IEEE 802.15.4]] and Zigbee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sensor-networks.org/index.php?page=0823123150 |title= Wireless Sensor Networks Research Group |publisher=Sensor networks |date=2008-11-17 |accessdate = 2012-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; is similar to that between [[IEEE 802.11]] and the [[Wi-Fi Alliance]].

=== Zigbee Alliance Membership ===
The Zigbee Alliance has three levels of membership: Adopter, Participant, and Promoter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zigbee.org/zigbeealliance/our-members/ |title=The ZigBee Alliance |publisher = Zigbee |accessdate=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Adopter members are allowed access to completed Zigbee specifications and standards, and the Participant members have voting rights, play a role in Zigbee development, and have early access to specifications and standards for product development.

The requirements for membership in the Zigbee alliance cause problems for Free Software developers because the annual fee conflicts with the [[GNU General Public Licence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = Innovation | publisher = Qi hardware | contribution-url = http://en.qi-hardware.com/wiki/Ben_WPAN#FAQ_and_Innovation | quote = ZigBee is only royalty-free if not used for commercial purposes... | title = FAQ for BEN WPAN}}&lt;/ref&gt; The requirement for the developer to join the Zigbee Alliance similarly conflicts with most other [[free software]] licenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Zigbee, Linux, and the GPL | url= http://freaklabs.org/index.php/Blog/Zigbee/Zigbee-Linux-and-the-GPL.html | publisher= Freak labs | accessdate= 2009-06-14 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100216234546/http://freaklabs.org/index.php/Blog/Zigbee/Zigbee-Linux-and-the-GPL.html | archivedate= 2010-02-16 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zigbee Smart Energy relies on Zigbee IP, a network layer that routes standard IPv6 traffic over IEEE 802.15.4 using [[6LoWPAN]] header compression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ZigBee IP and 920IP |url=http://www.zigbee.org/zigbee-for-developers/network-specifications/zigbeeip/|publisher=[[ZigBee Alliance]]|accessdate=2016-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ZigBee IP: Smart Grid, Meet the Internet of Things |url=http://greentechadvocates.com/2013/04/04/zigbee-ip-smart-grid-meet-the-internet-of-things/|publisher=[[GreenTech Advocates]]|accessdate=2016-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the RF4CE (Radio Frequency for Consumer Electronics) Consortium and Zigbee Alliance agreed to deliver jointly a standard for radio frequency remote controls. Zigbee RF4CE is designed for a broad range of consumer electronics products, such as TVs and set-top boxes. It promised many advantages over existing remote control solutions, including richer communication and increased reliability, enhanced features and flexibility, interoperability, and no line-of-sight barrier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introducing ZigBee RF4CE|url=http://www.daintree.net/downloads/whitepapers/zigbee-rf4ce-intro.pdf|publisher=[[Daintree Networks]]|accessdate=2009-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Zigbee RF4CE specification lifts off some networking weight and does not support all the mesh features, which is traded for smaller memory configurations for lower cost devices, such as remote control of consumer electronics.

With the introduction of the second Zigbee RF4CE application profile in 2012 and increased momentum in MSO market, the Zigbee RF4CE team provides an overview on current status of the standard, applications, and future of the technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ZigBee RF4CE: A Quiet Revolution is Underway (December, 2012)|url=https://docs.zigbee.org/zigbee-docs/dcn/12/docs-12-0629-01-0mwg-zigbee-rf4ce-a-quiet-revolution-is-underway-webinar-slides.pdf|publisher=[[ZigBee Alliance]]|accessdate=2012-12-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118103359/https://docs.zigbee.org/zigbee-docs/dcn/12/docs-12-0629-01-0mwg-zigbee-rf4ce-a-quiet-revolution-is-underway-webinar-slides.pdf|archivedate=2013-01-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ZigBee RF4CE Webinar: A Quiet Revolution is Underway (December, 2012)|url=https://www4.gotomeeting.com/register/595909335|publisher=[[ZigBee Alliance]]|accessdate=2012-12-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625173253/https://www4.gotomeeting.com/register/595909335|archivedate=2013-06-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Radio hardware ==
The radio design used by Zigbee has few [[analog circuit|analog]] stages and uses [[digital circuit]]s wherever possible.

Though the radios themselves are inexpensive, the Zigbee Qualification Process involves a full validation of the requirements of the physical layer. All radios derived from the same validated [[ mask set|semiconductor mask set]] would enjoy the same RF characteristics. An uncertified physical layer that malfunctions could cripple the battery lifespan of other devices on a Zigbee network. Zigbee radios have very tight constraints on power and bandwidth.  Thus, radios are tested with guidance given by Clause 6 of the [[802.15.4]]-2006 Standard. Products that integrate the radio and microcontroller into a single module are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microchip.com/design-centers/wireless-connectivity/embedded-wireless/802-15-4/hardware/zigbit-modules |title=Zigbit Modules MCU Wireless- Microchip Corporation |publisher=Microchip.com |accessdate=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This standard specifies operation in the unlicensed 2.4 to 2.4835&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;Wang et. al. [http://site.ebrary.com/lib/pitt/reader.action?docID=10849540 ZigBee® network protocols and applications]&lt;/ref&gt;[[Hertz|GHz]] (worldwide), 902 to 928&amp;nbsp;[[Megahertz|MHz]] (Americas and Australia) and 868 to 868.6&amp;nbsp;MHz (Europe) [[ISM band]]s.  Sixteen channels are allocated in the 2.4&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|GHz]] band, with each channel spaced 5&amp;nbsp;[[Megahertz|MHz]] apart, though using only 2&amp;nbsp;MHz of bandwidth. The radios use [[direct-sequence spread spectrum]] coding, which is managed by the digital stream into the modulator.  [[Binary phase-shift keying]] (BPSK) is used in the 868 and 915&amp;nbsp;MHz bands, and [[offset quadrature phase-shift keying]] (OQPSK) that transmits two bits per symbol is used in the 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz band.

The raw, over-the-air data rate is 250&amp;nbsp;[[kilobit|kbit]]/[[second|s]] per [[Communication channel|channel]] in the 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz band, 40 kbit/s per channel in the 915&amp;nbsp;MHz band, and 20&amp;nbsp;kbit/s in the 868&amp;nbsp;MHz band. The actual data throughput will be less than the maximum specified bit rate due to the packet overhead and processing delays. For indoor applications at 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz transmission distance may be 10–20&amp;nbsp;m, depending on the construction materials, the number of walls to be penetrated and the output power permitted in that geographical location.&lt;ref&gt;David Egan, [http://www.elp.com/articles/powergrid_international/print/volume-17/issue-12/features/zigbee-propagation-for-smart-metering.html?goback=%2Egde_127437_member_195983370 "ZigBee Propagation for Smart Metering Networks"], Electric Light &amp; Power vol 17 issue12&lt;/ref&gt; Outdoors with [[Line-of-sight propagation|line-of-sight]], range may be up to 1500&amp;nbsp;m depending on power output and environmental characteristics&lt;ref name="specs" /&gt;{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}. The output power of the radios is generally 0-20 [[dBm]] (1-100&amp;nbsp;mW).

== Device types and operating modes ==
Zigbee devices are of three kinds:
* ''Zigbee Coordinator (ZC)'': The most capable device, the Coordinator forms the root of the network tree and might bridge to other networks. There is precisely one Zigbee Coordinator in each network since it is the device that started the network originally (the Zigbee LightLink specification also allows operation without a Zigbee Coordinator, making it more usable for off-the-shelf home products).  It stores information about the network, including acting as the Trust Center &amp; repository for security keys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sensor-networks.org/index.php?page=1010510536 |title=Wireless Sensor Networks Research Group |publisher=Sensor-networks.org |date=2010-04-15 |accessdate=2012-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sensor-networks.org/index.php?page=0903503549 |title=Wireless Sensor Networks Research Group |publisher=Sensor-networks.org |date=2009-02-05 |accessdate=2012-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Zigbee Router (ZR)'': As well as running an application function, a Router can act as an intermediate router, passing on data from other devices.
* ''Zigbee End Device (ZED)'': Contains just enough functionality to talk to the parent node (either the Coordinator or a Router); it cannot relay data from other devices. This relationship allows the node to be asleep a significant amount of the time thereby giving long battery life. A ZED requires the least amount of memory, and, therefore, can be less expensive to manufacture than a ZR or ZC.

The current Zigbee protocols support [[Electric beacon|beacon]] and non-beacon enabled networks. In non-beacon-enabled networks, an unslotted [[CSMA/CA]] channel access mechanism is used. In this type of network, Zigbee Routers typically have their receivers continuously active, requiring a more robust power supply. However, this allows for heterogeneous networks in which some devices receive continuously while others only transmit when an external stimulus is detected. The typical example of a heterogeneous network is a [[wireless light switch]]: The Zigbee node at the lamp may constantly receive, since it is connected to the mains supply, while a battery-powered light switch would remain asleep until the switch is thrown.  The switch then wakes up, sends a command to the lamp, receives an acknowledgment, and returns to sleep.  In such a network the lamp node will be at least a Zigbee Router, if not the Zigbee Coordinator; the switch node is typically a Zigbee End Device.

In beacon-enabled networks, the special network nodes called Zigbee Routers transmit periodic beacons to confirm their presence to other network nodes. Nodes may sleep between beacons, thus lowering their [[duty cycle]] and extending their battery life.  Beacon intervals depend on data rate; they may range from 15.36 milliseconds to 251.65824 seconds at 250&amp;nbsp;[[kbit/s]], from 24 milliseconds to 393.216 seconds at 40&amp;nbsp;kbit/s and from 48 milliseconds to 786.432 seconds at 20&amp;nbsp;kbit/s. However, low duty cycle operation with long beacon intervals requires precise timing, which can conflict with the need for low product cost.

In general, the Zigbee protocols minimize the time the radio is on, so as to reduce power use. In beaconing networks, nodes only need to be active while a beacon is being transmitted.  In non-beacon-enabled networks, power consumption is decidedly asymmetrical: Some devices are always active while others spend most of their time sleeping.

Except for the Smart Energy Profile 2.0, Zigbee devices are required to conform to the IEEE [[802.15.4]]-2003 Low-Rate Wireless Personal Area Network (LR-WPAN) standard. The standard specifies the lower [[protocol layering|protocol layers]]—the [[physical layer]] (PHY), and the [[Media Access Control]] portion of the  [[data link layer]] (DLL).  The basic channel access mode is "carrier sense, multiple access/collision avoidance" ([[Carrier Sense Multiple Access|CSMA/CA]]). That is, the nodes talk in the same way that humans converse; they briefly check to see that no one is talking before he or she start, with three notable exceptions. Beacons are sent on a fixed timing schedule and do not use CSMA.  Message acknowledgments also do not use CSMA. Finally, devices in beacon-enabled networks that have low latency real-time requirements may also use Guaranteed Time Slots (GTS), which by definition do not use CSMA.

The software is designed to be easy to develop on small, inexpensive microprocessors. For more detail, please use one or more of the sources listed in the References section below, or go directly to the Zigbee Alliance web site using the External links provided below.

=== Network layer ===
The main functions of the [[network layer]] are to enable the correct use of the [[MAC address|MAC]] sublayer and provide a suitable interface for use by the next upper layer, namely the application layer. Its capabilities and structure are those typically associated to such network layers, including routing. The Network Layer 's function is exactly as it sounds. It deals with network functions such as connecting, disconnecting, and setting up networks.  It will add a network, allocate addresses, and add/remove certain devices. This layer makes use of star, mesh and tree topologies. It adds an interface to the application layer.

On the one hand, the ''data entity'' creates and manages network layer data units from the payload of the application-layer and performs routing according to the current topology. On the other hand, there is the layer ''control'', which is used to handle configuration of new devices and establish new networks: it can determine whether a neighboring device belongs to the network and discovers new neighbors and routers. The control can also detect the presence of a receiver, which allows direct communication and MAC synchronization.

The routing protocol used by the network layer is [[AODV]], which has similar properties to [[Associativity-Based Routing]] (ABR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/760423/ |title=A review of current routing protocols for ad hoc mobile wireless networks}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike AODV, ABR was a patented routing protocol invented in 1994 at Cambridge University, England. AODV was a working IETF draft, which consistently added features from a variety of suggestions and sources over time.  In AODV, to find the destination device, AODV broadcasts out a route request to all of its neighbors. The neighbors then broadcast the request to their neighbors and onward until the destination is reached. Once the destination is reached, it sends its route reply via unicast transmission following the lowest cost path back to the source. This approach of route discovery is '''exactly similar''' to those of ABR,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-manet-longlived-adhoc-routing-00 |title="Long-lived Ad Hoc Routing based on the Concept of Associativity", IETF Draft 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; except that ABR does not use sequence number or distance vectors. Once the source receives the reply, it will update its routing table for the destination address of the next hop in the path and the path cost.

=== Application layer ===
The application layer is the highest-level layer defined by the specification and is the effective interface of the Zigbee system to its end users. It comprises the majority of components added by the Zigbee specification: both ZDO and its management procedures, together with application objects defined by the manufacturer, are considered part of this layer. This layer binds tables, sends messages between bound devices, manages group addresses, reassembles packets and also transports data. It is responsible for providing service to Zigbee device profiles.

=== Main components ===
The ''ZDO'' (Zigbee Device Object), a protocol in the Zigbee protocol stack, is responsible for overall device management, security keys, and policies. It is responsible for defining the role of a device as either coordinator or end device, as mentioned above, but also for the discovery of new ([[Hop (telecommunications)|one-hop]]) devices on the network and the identification of their offered services. It may then go on to establish secure links with external devices and reply to binding requests accordingly.

The ''application support sublayer'' (APS) is the other main standard component of the layer, and as such it offers a well-defined interface and control services. It works as a bridge between the network layer and the other elements of the application layer: it keeps up-to-date [[binding table]]s in the form of a database, which can be used to find appropriate devices depending on the services that are needed and those the different devices offer. As the union between both specified layers, it also routes messages across the layers of the [[protocol stack]].

=== Communication models ===
[[File:ZigBee node structure.png|thumb|Zigbee, high-level communication model]] An application may consist of communicating objects which cooperate to carry out the desired tasks. The focus of Zigbee is to distribute work among many different devices which reside within individual Zigbee nodes which in turn form a network (said work will typically be largely local to each device, for instance, the control of each household appliance).

The collection of objects that form the network communicates using the facilities provided by APS, supervised by ZDO interfaces. The application layer data service follows a typical request-confirm/indication-response structure. Within a single device, up to 240 application objects can exist, numbered in the range 1-240. 0 is reserved for the ZDO data interface and 255 for broadcast; the 241-254 range is not currently in use but may be in the future.

Two services are available for application objects to use (in Zigbee 1.0):
* The ''[[Associative array|key-value pair]] service'' (KVP) is meant for configuration purposes. It enables description, request and modification of object attribute through a simple interface based on getting/set and event primitives, some allowing a request for a response. Configuration uses compressed [[XML]] (full XML can be used) to provide an adaptable and elegant solution.
* The ''message service'' is designed to offer a general approach to information treatment, avoiding the necessity to adapt application protocols and potential overhead incurred on by KVP. It allows arbitrary payloads to be transmitted over APS frames.

Addressing is also part of the application layer. A network node consists of an 802.15.4-conformant radio [[transceiver]] and one or more device descriptions (basically collections of attributes which can be polled or set, or which can be monitored through events). The transceiver is the base for addressing, and devices within a node are specified by an ''endpoint identifier'' in the range 1-240.

=== Communication and device discovery ===
For applications to communicate, their comprising devices must use a common application protocol (types of messages, formats and so on); these sets of conventions are grouped in ''profiles''. Furthermore, binding is decided upon by matching input and output cluster identifiers, unique within the context of a given profile and associated to an incoming or outgoing data flow in a device. Binding tables contain source and destination pairs.

Depending on the available information, device discovery may follow different methods. When the network address is known, the IEEE address can be requested using [[unicast]] communication. When it is not, petitions are [[broadcast]] (the IEEE address being part of the response payload). End devices will simply respond with the requested address while a network coordinator or a router will also send the addresses of all the devices associated with it.

This extended discovery protocol permits external devices to find out about devices in a network and the services that they offer, which endpoints can report when queried by the discovering device (which has previously obtained their addresses). Matching services can also be used.

The use of cluster identifiers enforces the binding of complementary entities using the binding tables, which are maintained by Zigbee coordinators, as the table must always be available within a network and coordinators are most likely to have a permanent power supply. Backups, managed by higher-level layers, may be needed by some applications. Binding requires an established communication link; after it exists, whether to add a new node to the network is decided, according to the application and security policies.

Communication can happen right after the association. ''[[Direct addressing]]'' uses both radio address and endpoint identifier, whereas indirect addressing uses every relevant field (address, endpoint, cluster, and attribute) and requires that they are sent to the network coordinator, which maintains associations and translates requests for communication. ''[[Indirect addressing]]'' is particularly useful to keep some devices very simple and minimize their need for storage. Besides these two methods, ''broadcast'' to all endpoints in a device is available, and ''[[Multicast|group addressing]]'' is used to communicate with groups of endpoints belonging to a set of devices.

== Security services ==
As one of its defining features, Zigbee provides facilities for carrying out secure communications, protecting establishment and transport of cryptographic keys, cyphering frames, and controlling devices. It builds on the basic security framework defined in IEEE 802.15.4. This part of the architecture relies on the correct management of symmetric keys and the correct implementation of methods and security policies.

=== Basic security model ===
The basic mechanism to ensure confidentiality is the adequate protection of all keying material. Trust must be assumed in the initial installation of the keys, as well as in the processing of security information. For an implementation to globally work, its general conformance to specified behaviors is assumed.

Keys are the cornerstone of the security architecture; as such their protection is of paramount importance, and keys are never supposed to be transported through an [[insecure channel]]. A momentary exception to this rule occurs during the initial phase of the addition to the network of a previously unconfigured device. The Zigbee network model must take particular care of security considerations, as [[ad hoc network]]s may be physically accessible to external devices. Also the state of the working environment cannot be predicted.

Within the protocol stack, different network layers are not cryptographically separated, so access policies are needed, and conventional design assumed. The open trust model within a device allows for key sharing, which notably decreases potential cost. Nevertheless, the layer which creates a frame is responsible for its security. If malicious devices may exist, every network layer payload must be ciphered, so unauthorized traffic can be immediately cut off. The exception, again, is the transmission of the network key, which confers a unified security layer to the grid, to a new connecting device.

=== Security architecture ===
Zigbee uses 128-bit keys to implement its security mechanisms. A key can be associated either to a network, being usable by both Zigbee layers and the MAC sublayer, or to a link, acquired through pre-installation, agreement or transport. Establishment of link keys is based on a master key which controls link key correspondence. Ultimately, at least, the initial master key must be obtained through a secure medium (transport or pre-installation), as the security of the whole network depends on it. Link and master keys are only visible to the application layer. Different services use different [[One-way encryption|one-way]] variations of the link key to avoid leaks and security risks.

Key distribution is one of the most important security functions of the network. A secure network will designate one special device which other devices trust for the distribution of security keys: the trust center. Ideally, devices will have the center trust address and initial master key preloaded; if a momentary vulnerability is allowed, it will be sent as described above. Typical applications without special security needs will use a network key provided by the trust center (through the initially insecure channel) to communicate.

Thus, the trust center maintains both the network key and provides point-to-point security. Devices will only accept communications originating from a key supplied by the trust center, except for the initial master key. The security architecture is distributed among the network layers as follows:
* The MAC sublayer is capable of single-hop reliable communications. As a rule, the security level it is to use is specified by the upper layers.
* The network layer manages routing, processing received messages and being capable of broadcasting requests. Outgoing frames will use the adequate link key according to the routing if it is available; otherwise, the network key will be used to protect the payload from external devices.
* The application layer offers key establishment and transport services to both ZDO and applications.

The security levels infrastructure is based on [[CCM*]], which adds encryption- and integrity-only features to [[CCM mode|CCM]].

According to a German computer magazine website, Zigbee Home Automation 1.2 is using fallback keys for encryption negotiation which are known and cannot be changed. This makes the encryption highly vulnerable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heise.de/-3010287|title=Deepsec: ZigBee macht Smart Home zum offenen Haus|first=heise|last=Security|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Simulation ==
Network simulators, like [[ns (simulator)|ns2]], [[OMNeT++]], [[OPNET]], and [[NetSim]] can be used to simulate IEEE 802.15.4 Zigbee networks.

These simulators come with open source C or C++ libraries for users to modify. This way users can determine the validity of new algorithms before hardware implementation.
