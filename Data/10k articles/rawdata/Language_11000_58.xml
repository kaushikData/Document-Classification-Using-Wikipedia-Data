'''Abstract space''', in [[geography]], is a hypothetical [[space]] characterized by equal and consistent properties; a geographic space that is completely [[homogeneity (physics)|homogeneous]]. All movement and activity would be equally easy or difficult in all directions and all locations within this space. This concept is useful for modeling or analyzing spatial activity and behavior by limiting or eliminating [[extraneous variables]], such as terrain. For example, if researchers want to study the relationship between culture and trade, they don’t want their model to be overwhelmed or influenced by factors such as mountainous barriers and rivers because these would detract from the purpose of modeling how culture alone effects trade.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2937">'''Aed mac Conchbair Mac Aodhagáin''' (1330&amp;ndash;1359) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] [[bard]].

[[Mac Aodhagáin]] was a member of a bardic family who originated from Park, in north [[County Galway]]. He was a [[scribe]] of [[Leabhar Ua Maine]] (The Book of Uí Maine), and based in Dún Daighre, (Duniry), [[County Galway]], and was an [[ollamh]] in law for the [[Clanricarde]]. His genealogy was Aed mac Conchbair mac Gilla na Naem mic Duinn Sleibhe Mac Aodhagáin .

He is notable for, along with [[John Clyn]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 1332&amp;ndash;1349), one of the few Irish chroniclers to leave a personal note of the [[Black Death]]. A marginal note in the book states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''"One thousand three hundred and fifty years from the birth of [[Christ]] to this night and this is the second year since the coming of the [[Black Death|plague]] to [[Ireland]]. I have written this in the twentieth year of my age. I am Aed mac Conchbair Mac Aodhagáin and whoever reads it let him offer a prayer for my soul. This is [[Christmas]] night. On this night I place myself under the protection of the king of [[Heaven]] and [[Earth]], beseeching that he will bring me and my friends safe through this plague and restore us once more to joy and gladness. Aed mac Conchbair Mac Aodhagáin who wrote this in the year of the great plague."''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Beneath the above note is a second, dated a year later, Christmas night 1351:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''"It is just a year tonight since I wroter the lines on the margin below and if it be God's will, may I reach the anniversary of this night many times, amen."''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He is believed to have attended the great poetic festival held in 1351:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''"at Christmas by William, the son of Donough Muimhneach O'Kelly, to the learned of Ireland, travellers, the poor and the indigent, and they were all served to their satisfaction, both good and bad, noble and ignoble, so that they were all thankful to him and his son, Melaghlin."''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Aed died in 1359, and was noted as ''"the best of the [[Brehon]]s of Ireland."''

The '''analysis of competing hypotheses''' ('''ACH''') allegedly provides an unbiased [[methodology]] for evaluating multiple competing hypotheses for observed data. It was developed by [[Richards Heuer|Richards (Dick) J. Heuer, Jr.]], a 45-year veteran of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], in the 1970s for use by the Agency.&lt;ref name=CH8/&gt; ACH is used by analysts in various fields who make judgments that entail a high risk of error in reasoning. It helps an analyst overcome, or at least minimize, some of the cognitive limitations that make prescient [[intelligence analysis]] so difficult to achieve.&lt;ref name=CH8/&gt;

ACH was a step forward in [[Intelligence analysis#Methods of analysis|intelligence analysis methodology]], but it was first described in relatively informal terms. Producing the best available information from [[uncertain data]] remains the goal of researchers, tool-builders, and analysts in industry, academia and government. Their domains include [[data mining]], [[cognitive psychology]] and [[visualization (computer graphics)|visualization]], [[probability]] and [[statistics]], etc. [[Abductive reasoning]] is an earlier concept with similarities to ACH.

==Process==
Heuer outlines the ACH process in considerable depth in his book, ''Psychology of Intelligence Analysis''.&lt;ref name=CH8/&gt; It consists of the following steps:
# Hypothesis – The first step of the process is to identify all potential hypotheses, preferably using a group of analysts with different perspectives to [[brainstorming|brainstorm]] the possibilities. The process discourages the analyst from choosing one "likely" hypothesis and using evidence to prove its accuracy. [[Cognitive bias]] is minimized when all possible hypotheses are considered.&lt;ref name=CH8/&gt;
# Evidence – The analyst then lists evidence and arguments (including assumptions and logical deductions) for and against each hypothesis.&lt;ref name=CH8/&gt;
# Diagnostics – Using a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]], the analyst applies evidence against each hypothesis in an attempt to disprove as many theories as possible. Some evidence will have greater "diagnosticity" than other evidence — that is, some will be more helpful in judging the relative likelihood of alternative hypotheses. This step is the most important, according to Heuer. Instead of looking at one hypothesis and all the evidence ("working down" the matrix), the analyst is encouraged to consider one piece of evidence at a time, and examine it against all possible hypotheses ("working across" the matrix).&lt;ref name=CH8/&gt;
# Refinement – The analyst reviews the findings, identifies any gaps, and collects any additional evidence needed to refute as many of the remaining hypotheses as possible.&lt;ref name=CH8/&gt;
# Inconsistency – The analyst then seeks to draw tentative conclusions about the relative likelihood of each hypothesis. Less consistency implies a lower likelihood. The least consistent hypotheses are eliminated. While the matrix generates a definitive mathematical total for each hypothesis, the analyst must use their judgment to make the final conclusion. The result of the ACH analysis itself must not overrule analysts' own judgments.
# Sensitivity – The analyst tests the conclusions using [[sensitivity analysis]], which weighs how the conclusion would be affected if key evidence or arguments were wrong, misleading, or subject to different interpretations. The validity of key evidence and the consistency of important arguments are double-checked to assure the soundness of the conclusion's [[intelligence analysis#Linchpin analysis|linchpins]] and drivers.&lt;ref name=CH8&gt;{{citation |title=Psychology of Intelligence Analysis |first=Richards J., Jr |last=Heuer |contribution=Chapter 8: Analysis of Competing Hypotheses |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/psychology-of-intelligence-analysis/art11.html |publisher=Center for the Study of Intelligence, [[Central Intelligence Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Conclusions and evaluation – Finally, the analyst provides the decisionmaker with his or her conclusions, as well as a summary of alternatives that were considered and why they were rejected. The analyst also identifies milestones in the process that can serve as indicators in future analyses.&lt;ref name=CH8/&gt;

==Strengths==
There are many benefits of doing an ACH matrix. It is auditable. It is widely believed to help overcome [[cognitive bias]]es, though there is a lack of strong empirical evidence to support this belief.&lt;ref name=Thomason2010&gt;{{citation |title=Field Evaluation in the Intelligence and Counterintelligence Context:  Workshop Summary |first=Neil |last=Thomason |contribution=Alternative Competing Hypotheses |url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12854.html |year=2010 |publisher=National Academies Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the ACH requires the analyst to construct a matrix, the evidence and hypotheses can be [[backtracking|backtracked]]. This allows the decisionmaker or other analysts to see the sequence of rules and data that led to the conclusion.

==Weaknesses==
The process to create an ACH is time consuming. The ACH matrix can be problematic when analyzing a complex project. It can be cumbersome for an analyst to manage a large database with multiple pieces of evidence.

Especially in intelligence, both governmental and business, analysts must always be aware that the opponent(s) is intelligent and may be generating information intended to [[deception|deceive]].&lt;ref name=Elsaesser&gt;{{citation |contribution=Detecting Deception |first1=Christopher |last1=Elsaesser |first2=Frank J. |last2=Stech |pages=101–124 |year=2007 |title=Adversarial Reasoning: Computational Approaches to Reading the Opponent’s Mind |editor1=Kott, Alexander |editor2=McEneaney, William |publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stech&gt;{{citation |title=Deception Detection by Analysis of Competing Hypotheses |first1=Frank J. |last1=Stech |first2=Christopher |last2=Elsaesser |publisher=[[MITRE Corporation]] |url=https://analysis.mitre.org/proceedings/Final_Papers_Files/94_Camera_Ready_Paper.pdf |access-date=2008-05-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807192930/https://analysis.mitre.org/proceedings/Final_Papers_Files/94_Camera_Ready_Paper.pdf |archive-date=2008-08-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }} MITRE Sponsored Research Project 51MSR111, Counter-Deception Decision Support&lt;/ref&gt; Since deception often is the result of a cognitive trap, Elsaesser and Stech use state-based hierarchical plan recognition (see [[abductive reasoning]]) to generate causal explanations of observations. The resulting hypotheses are converted to a dynamic [[Bayesian network]] and [[value of information]] analysis is employed to isolate assumptions implicit in the evaluation of paths in, or conclusions of, particular hypotheses. As evidence in the form of observations of states or assumptions is observed, they can become the subject of separate validation. Should an assumption or necessary state be negated, hypotheses depending on it are rejected. This is a form of [[root cause analysis]].

Evidence also presents a problem if it is unreliable. The evidence used in the matrix is static and therefore it can be a snapshot in time.

According to social constructivist critics, ACH also fails to stress sufficiently (or to address as a method) the problematic nature of the initial formation of the hypotheses used to create its grid.  There is considerable evidence, for example, that in addition to any bureaucratic, psychological, or political biases that may affect hypothesis generation, there are also factors of culture and identity at work. These socially constructed factors may restrict or pre-screen which hypotheses end up being considered, and then reinforce confirmation bias in those selected.&lt;ref&gt;Chapters one to four, {{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=Milo L. and  |last2=Silberzahn |first2=Philippe|year=2013  |title=Constructing Cassandra, Reframing Intelligence Failure at the CIA, 1947-2001|publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=978-0804793360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher and [[Argumentation theory|argumentation theorist]] [[Tim van Gelder]] has made the following criticisms:&lt;ref name=vanGelder2008&gt;{{citation |title=Can we do better than ACH? |url=http://timvangelder.com/2007/12/31/hypothesis-testing-whats-wrong-with-ach/ |journal=AIPIO News |issue=Issue 55 |date=December 2008 |last=van Gelder |first=Tim |publisher=Australian Institute of Professional Intelligence Officers}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ACH demands that the analyst makes too many discrete judgments, a great many of which contribute little if anything to discerning the best hypothesis
* ACH misconceives the nature of the relationship between items of evidence and hypotheses by supposing that items of evidence are, on their own, consistent or inconsistent with hypotheses.
* ACH treats the hypothesis set as "flat", i.e. a mere list, and so is unable to relate evidence to hypotheses at the appropriate levels of abstraction
* ACH cannot represent subordinate argumentation, i.e. the argumentation bearing up on a piece of evidence.
* ACH activities at realistic scales leave analysts disoriented or confused.

Van Gelder proposed ''hypothesis mapping'' as an alternative to ACH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=11 December 2012 |last=van Gelder |first=Tim |title=Exploring new directions for intelligence analysis |url=https://timvangelder.com/2012/12/11/exploring-new-directions-for-intelligence-analysis/ |website=timvangelder.com |accessdate=30 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chevallier |first=Arnaud |date=2016 |title=Strategic Thinking in Complex Problem Solving |location=Oxford; New York |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=9780190463908 |oclc=940455195 |doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190463908.001.0001 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0DhRDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA113 113]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structured analysis of competing hypotheses===
The structured analysis of competing hypotheses offers analysts an improvement over the limitations of the original ACH.{{discuss|April 2008}}&lt;ref name=Wheaton2006&gt;{{citation |title=Structured Analysis of Competing Hypotheses: Improving a Tested Intelligence Methodology |journal=Competitive Intelligence Magazine |volume=9 |issue=6 |date=November–December 2006 |pages=12–15 |url=http://www.mcmanis-monsalve.com/assets/publications/intelligence-methodology-1-07-chido.pdf |author=Wheaton |name-list-format=vanc |author2=Kristan J. |display-authors=2 |author3=&lt;Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.&gt; |access-date=2008-05-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928154654/http://www.mcmanis-monsalve.com/assets/publications/intelligence-methodology-1-07-chido.pdf |archive-date=2007-09-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The SACH maximizes the possible hypotheses by allowing the analyst to split one hypothesis into two complex ones.

For example, two tested hypotheses could be that Iraq has WMD or Iraq does not have WMD. If the evidence showed that it is more likely there are WMDs in Iraq then two new hypotheses could be formulated: WMD are in Baghdad or WMD are in Mosul. Or perhaps, the analyst may need to know what type of WMD Iraq has; the new hypotheses could be that Iraq has biological WMD, Iraq has chemical WMD and Iraq has nuclear WMD. By giving the ACH structure, the analyst is able to give a nuanced estimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Chido |title=Structured Analysis Of Competing Hypotheses: Theory and Application |publisher=[[Mercyhurst College Institute for Intelligence Studies]] Press |year=2006 |page=54 |name-list-format=vanc |author2=Diane E. |display-authors=2 |author3=&lt;Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other approaches to formalism===
One method, by Valtorta and colleagues uses probabilistic methods, adds [[Bayesian analysis]] to ACH.&lt;ref name=Valtorta&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.cse.sc.edu/~mgv/reports/IA-05.pdf |contribution=Extending Heuer's Analysis of Competing Hypotheses Method to Support Complex Decision Analysis |author=Valtorta, Marco |title=International Conference on Intelligence Analysis Methods and Tools |date=May 2005 |display-authors=1 |author2=&lt;Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; A generalization of this concept to a distributed community of analysts lead to the development of CACHE (the Collaborative ACH Environment),&lt;ref&gt;Shrager, J., et al. (2009) Soccer science and the Bayes community: Exploring the cognitive implications of modern scientific communication. Topics in Cognitive Science, 2(1), 53–72.&lt;/ref&gt; which introduced the concept of a Bayes (or Bayesian) community. The work by Akram and Wang applies paradigms from [[graph theory]].&lt;ref name=Akram2006&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.huitfeldt.com/repository/ITW06.pdf |contribution=Investigative Data Mining: Connecting the dots to disconnect them |pages=28–34 |first1=Shaikh Muhammad |last1=Akram |last2=Wang |first2=Jiaxin |title=Proceedings of the 2006 Intelligence Tools Workshop |date=23 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other work focuses less on probabilistic methods and more on cognitive and visualization extensions to ACH, as discussed by Madsen and Hicks.&lt;ref name=Madsen2006&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.huitfeldt.com/repository/ITW06.pdf |contribution=Investigating the Cognitive Effects of Externalization Tools |pages=4–11 |first1=Fredrik H. |last1=Madsen |first2=David L. |last2=Hicks |title=Proceedings of the 2006 Intelligence Tools Workshop |date=23 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; DECIDE, discussed under [[#Automation|automation]] is visualization-oriented.&lt;ref name=Cluxton2005&gt;{{citation |first1=Diane |last1=Cluxton |first2=Stephen G. |last2=Eick |contribution="DECIDE Hypothesis Visualization Tool" |title=2005 Intl conf on Intelligence Analysis |url=https://analysis.mitre.org/proceedings/Final_Papers_Files/119_Camera_Ready_Paper.pdf |access-date=2008-05-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807192605/https://analysis.mitre.org/proceedings/Final_Papers_Files/119_Camera_Ready_Paper.pdf |archive-date=2008-08-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Work by Pope and Jøsang uses [[subjective logic]], a formal mathematical methodology that explicitly deals with uncertainty.&lt;ref name=Pope2005&gt;{{citation |id=ADA463908 |title= Analysis of Competing Hypotheses using Subjective Logic (ACH-SL) |publisher=Queensland University, Brisbane, Australia |last1=Pope |first1=Simon |last2=Josang |first2=Audun |date= June 2005 |url=http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA463908}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This methodology forms the basis of the Sheba technology that is used in Veriluma's intelligence assessment software.

==Automation==
A few online and downloadable tools help automate the ACH process. These programs leave a visual trail of evidence and allow the analyst to weigh evidence.

==History==

===The proposal and interim council (1959–1964)===


In the late 1950s, there was an increasing focus on the global need for anthropological research into 'disappearing cultures'.&lt;ref&gt;''International Social Science Bulletin: Disappearing Cultures'', vol 9, No 3, 1957, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Paris. http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0002/000247/024733eo.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heine-Geldern, R (1959), 'The International Committee on Urgent Anthropological and Ethnological Research', ''American Anthropologist'', 61: 1076–1078. doi: 10.1525/aa.1959.61.6.02a00130&lt;/ref&gt; This trend was also emerging in Australia in the work of researchers of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples,&lt;ref&gt;Berndt, RM (1959), ‘Areas of research in Aboriginal Australia which demand urgent attention’, ''Bulletin of the International Committee on Urgent Anthropological and Ethnological Research'', Vienna, vol. 2, pp 63–9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Strehlow, TGH (1959), ‘Anthropological and ethnological research in Australia’, ''Bulletin of the International Committee on Urgent Anthropological and Ethnological Research'', Vienna, vol 2, pp 70–5&lt;/ref&gt; leading to a proposal by [[William Wentworth (Australian politician)|W.C. Wentworth MP]] for the conception of an Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies (AIAS) in 1959.&lt;ref name="Mulvaney,2008,p58-75"&gt;Mulvaney, DJ (2008), 'WEH Stanner and the foundation of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies, 1959–1964', p 58-75, in: ''An Appreciation of Difference: WEH Stanner and Aboriginal Australia'', Hinkson, Melinda and Beckett, Jeremy (eds), Aboriginal Studies Press, Canberra.&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposal was made as a submission to Cabinet,&lt;ref name="Bryson,Aborigines, film and science, 2002"&gt;Bryson, Ian (2002), ‘Aborigines, film and science’, ''Bringing to Light: a history of ethnographic filmmaking at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies'', Aboriginal Studies Press, Canberra, pp 9–17&lt;/ref&gt; and argued for a more comprehensive approach by the Australian Government to the recording of Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and cultures.&lt;ref name="Wentworth Lecture"&gt;'Wentworth Lectures', Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/news-and-events/events/special-events/wentworth-lectures, retrieved 24 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, a Cabinet sub-committee assessed the proposal&lt;ref name="Chapman,1988"&gt;Chapman, Valerie (1988), 'The Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies', ''Resources for Australian Studies in the ACT'', Biskup, Peter &amp; Goodman, Doreen (eds), Centre for Library and Information Studies, CCAE, pp194-214&lt;/ref&gt; and formed a working party at the [[Australian National University]] (ANU) to consider the viability of the proposal.  One of their first actions was to appoint [[William Edward Hanley Stanner|W.E.H. Stanner]] to organise a conference on the state of Aboriginal Studies in Australia,&lt;ref name="Bryson,Aborigines, film and science, 2002" /&gt; to be held in 1961 at the ANU.

Academics and anthropologists in the field of Aboriginal Studies attended the conference,&lt;ref name="Bryson,Aborigines, film and science, 2002" /&gt; and contributed research papers published in a conference report in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Shiels, H (ed) 1963, ''Australian Aboriginal Studies: A Symposium of Papers at 1961 Research Conference'', Oxford University Press, Melbourne&lt;/ref&gt; No Aboriginal people were present at the conference.&lt;ref name="Mulvaney,2008,p58-75" /&gt;

The Prime Minister, [[Robert Menzies]] appointed an Interim Council in 1961.  The role of the Interim Council was to plan for a national Aboriginal research organisation and establish how this organisation would interact with existing research and scientific bodies.&lt;ref name="Mulvaney,2008,p58-75" /&gt; The Interim Council was also tasked with immediately developing a programme that would identify and address urgent research needs.&lt;ref name="AIAS Details,NAA"&gt;'Australian Institute for Aboriginal Studies Agency Details', National Archives of Australia, www.naa.gov.au, retrieved 28 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Interim Council consisted of 16 members and was chaired by Deputy Vice-Chancellor of the ANU, Professor AD Trendall,&lt;ref name ="Mulvaney,2008,p58-75" /&gt; officially recognised as the first Chair of the institute now known as AIATSIS.&lt;ref name="Chairs and Principals"&gt;'Chairs and Principals of AIATSIS', Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/about-us/governance-and-structure/executive/chairs-and-principals {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316112934/http://aiatsis.gov.au/about-us/governance-and-structure/executive/chairs-and-principals |date=16 March 2015 }}, retrieved 17 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1962, a draft constitution for the institute was submitted to the Menzies government, and rejected. The Interim Council completed a revised constitution in July 1963. Amendments to the document included the change from the title ‘director’ to ‘principal’ of the institute.

This version of the constitution would go on to form the basis for the creation of the new Australian Institute for Aboriginal Studies the following year.&lt;ref name ="Mulvaney,2008,p58-75" /&gt;

===AIAS early years (1964–1970)===
The Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies was established as a [[Statutory authority]]&lt;ref name="Bryson,Aborigines, film and science, 2002" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies: Independent Review', ''Final Report to the Department of Education'', May 2014, p (i), http://aiatsis.gov.au/sites/default/files/docs/about-us/review-of-aiatsis-full-report-2014.pdf, retrieved 17 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; under an Act of Parliament in June 1964.&lt;ref name="Our history"&gt;'Our history', Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/about-us/our-history, retrieved 17 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Interim Council for the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies Agency Details', National Archives of Australia website, www.naa.gov.au,  retrieved 28 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The mission of the Institute at that time has been described as "to record language, song, art, material culture, ceremonial life and social structure before those traditions perished in the face of European ways."&lt;ref name="antiquity.ac.uk"&gt;Mulvaney, D. J. 'Reflections', ''Antiquity'', Vol. 80, no. 308, June 2006, pp 425–434, http://antiquity.ac.uk/Ant/080/0425/ant0800425.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

This notion is also reflected in the Institute’s official functions, as recorded in the Reading of the Bill in Parliament. These were:

:(a)	to sponsor and to foster research of a scientific nature on the Australian Aborigines.

:(b)	to treat as a matter of urgency those studies for which the source materials are disappearing.

:(c)	to establish and conduct a documentation centre on the Aborigines, and a library of books, manuscripts and other relevant material, both for the use of scholars and for public education.

:(d)	to encourage co-operation with and between scholars in universities, museums, and other institutions engaged in studies of the Aborigines, and with appropriate private bodies.

:(e)	to publish and to support the publication of the results of research.

:(f)	to co-operate with appropriate bodies concerning the financing of research, the preservation of sites, and the collection of records.

:(g)	to promote as and when necessary the training of research workers.

:(h)	to establish and maintain relations with relevant international bodies.&lt;ref name="AIAS Details,NAA" /&gt;

AIAS had a twenty-two member Council, composed mainly of academics, and had a foundation membership of one hundred.&lt;ref name="Our history"/&gt; The founding Principal of the newly formed institute was [[Frederick McCarthy]],&lt;ref name="Chairs and Principals"/&gt; a professional anthropologist and graduate of Sydney University who had spent nearly 30 years working in the field.&lt;ref&gt;'Fred McCarthy: the founding principal of AIATSIS', Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) website, {{cite web |url=http://www.aiatsis.gov.au/corporate/mccarthy.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028055915/http://www.aiatsis.gov.au/corporate/mccarthy.html |archivedate=28 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}, retrieved 28 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of the AIAS provided an opportunity for greater cross-discipline interaction in fields relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander studies in Australia.&lt;ref name="Our history"/&gt;

The Institute’s founding principal, Fred McCarthy, was an advocate of film as an important part of research methodology as early as his tenure as curator of anthropology at the Australian Museum in Sydney in the 1940s.&lt;ref name="Bryson,Aborigines, film and science, 2002" /&gt; This was evident in the contributions he made during his involvement in establishing the AIAS and also as its principal, in continuing to support the development of the AIAS Film Unit&lt;ref name="Bryson,Capturing a changing culture,2002"&gt;Bryson, Ian (2002), ‘Capturing a changing culture: The first phase of the Film Unit’ , ''Bringing to Light: a history of ethnographic filmmaking at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies'', Aboriginal Studies Press, Canberra, p 18-19&lt;/ref&gt; and championing ethnographic film in global forums.&lt;ref name="Bryson,Aborigines, film and science, 2002" /&gt;

In the early years of the AIAS, the Film Unit largely outsourced early filmmaking work to other companies,&lt;ref name="Bryson,Capturing a changing culture,2002" /&gt; or worked in collaboration with the [[Commonwealth Film Unit]] (as early as 1962).&lt;ref name="Bryson,Aborigines, film and science, 2002" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Australian Ethnographic Film', Australian Screen Online website, http://aso.gov.au/titles/collections/ethnographic-film-in-Australia/, retrieved 28 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; But over the next 30 years, the Film Unit would go on to produce “one of the largest assembly of ethnographic films created in the world”.&lt;ref&gt;'AIATSIS Collections: Film', Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/about-collections/film, retrieved 17 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In keeping with the AIAS official function “to publish and to support the publication of the results of research”,&lt;ref name="AIAS Details,NAA" /&gt; a publishing arm of the Institute was established in 1964. Publishing under the name Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies, the publishing arm released a range of papers and research findings, including in the fields of linguistics, demography, physical anthropology, history and musicology.&lt;ref&gt;Elkin, AP, 'The Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies: Publications', in Oceania, Vol. 41, No. 1 (Sep. 1970), pp. 52–57, https://www.jstor.org/stable/40329899, retrieved 10 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The early work of the AIAS is credited with increasing interaction between academics in different fields, as well as establishing the foundations for the extensive collections AIATSIS holds today. But before 1970, there had never been an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander member on the AIAS Council.&lt;ref name="Our history"/&gt;

===Self-determination and the Institute (1970–1989)===
&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Money and other resources are in short supply for Aboriginal control of their livelihood, but not, it seems, for discussing it."'' – Eaglehawk and Crow letter, 29 March 1974&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The 1970s marked a period of change for the AIAS. This began with the appointment of the first Aboriginal member of the AIAS Council in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, Jacqueline, ''A History of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies 1959 -1989: An analysis of how Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people achieved control of a national research institute'', thesis submitted for the Doctor of Philosophy, Menzies Library, Australian National University, November 2011, p106&lt;/ref&gt; Phillip Roberts, an Alawa man,&lt;ref&gt;‘Indigenous Rights: Phillip Roberts’, National Museum of Australia website, http://www.nma.gov.au/indigenous/people/pagination/phillip_roberts, retrieved 10 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pilling, A. R. (1963), '‘I, the Aboriginal’, Douglas Lockwood', ''American Anthropologist'', 65: 1152–1153. doi: 10.1525/aa.1963.65.5.02a00280&lt;/ref&gt; served on the Council from September 1970 until June 1972.&lt;ref name="Lambert 2011, p106"&gt;Lambert 2011, p106&lt;/ref&gt;

This was followed in 1971 with a second Aboriginal Council member, [[Neville Bonner|Senator Neville Bonner]], who served on Council until 1974 and for a second term in the late 1970s. And again in 1972, with the appointment of [[Dick Roughsey]] to replace Phillip Roberts at the end of his term.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert 2011, p128&lt;/ref&gt;

The appointment of Phillip Roberts to the Council reflected a growing pressure for an increase in Aboriginal representation within the Institute.&lt;ref name="Lambert 2011, p106"/&gt; But the move did not allay the belief held by some Aboriginal activists that the AIAS was engaging in 'tokenism' in the extent to which Aboriginal people were involved in the administration of Aboriginal Studies.&lt;ref&gt;Widders, Thompson, Bellear &amp; Watson (1974), ''Eaglehawk and Crow: an open letter concerning the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies'', 29 March, AIAS, cited in Lambert 2011, p142&lt;/ref&gt;

The changes to the Institute that would take place in the following decade were also influenced by the shifting social and political landscape in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert 2011, p107&lt;/ref&gt; The Aboriginal rights movement was growing&lt;ref name="Chapman,1988" /&gt; and Aboriginal people were demanding a voice on Council, consultation with communities and an increased focus on projects relevant to the needs of Indigenous people.&lt;ref name="antiquity.ac.uk"/&gt;

In 1972, the Whitlam government was elected. Their policy of [[Self-determination of Australian Aborigines|Self-determination for Aboriginal people]] echoed calls for greater Aboriginal involvement in the administration and functions of the AIAS.&lt;ref&gt;Rolls, Mitchell &amp; Johnson, Murray, ''Historical Dictionary of Australian Aborigines'', Scarecrow Press, Maryland, 2011, p xxv&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aph.gov.au"&gt;Pratt, Angela, 'Make or Break? A Background to the ATSIC Changes and the ATSIC Review', Parliament of Australia website, http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/Publications_Archive/CIB/cib0203/03cib29, retrieved 10 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The new government was also responsible for a significant boost to AIAS funding.&lt;ref name="Bryson,Recording culture in transition"&gt;Bryson, Ian (2002), Recording culture in transition, Bringing to Light: a history of ethnographic filmmaking at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, Aboriginal Studies Press, Canberra, pp 52–73&lt;/ref&gt;

The appointment of Peter Ucko in 1972 as Principal of the AIAS has since been described as the beginning of an increase in involvement of Aboriginal people in the workings of the Institute.&lt;ref name="Peter Ucko Obituary"&gt;Shennan, Stephen, ‘Peter Ucko Obituary’, The Guardian, 9 July 2007, https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/jul/09/guardianobituaries.obituaries, retrieved 10 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In his time as Principal, Ucko was responsible for implementing a policy later labelled “Aboriginalisation”, which was aimed at opening up the Institute to Aboriginal involvement and representation.&lt;ref name="Moser,1995"&gt;Moser, Stephanie, ‘The Aboriginalisation of Archaeology’, in Ucko, Peter J (ed) Theory in Archaeology: A World Perspective, Routledge, London, 1995, p152&lt;/ref&gt; This policy was influenced by a document circulated in 1974, called the Eaglehawk and Crow letter, which criticised the current model of academic research.&lt;ref&gt;Mulvaney, John (2011), Digging Up the Past, University of NSW Press, Sydney, p186&lt;/ref&gt; The letter asserted that anthropologists "should not pretend that their studies are objective when the overwhelming factor in the lives of Aborigines is our oppression by the society of which the anthropologist is, to a greater or lesser extent, a part of." Its authors called for increased participation of Aboriginal people in the running of the Institute and for greater control over commissioning and funding of research into their cultures.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Widder, T et al, ''Open Letter concerning the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies, ''referred to as the "Eaglehawk and Crow letter", 29 March 1974, http://www.50yearjourney.aiatsis.gov.au/stage4/_media/eaglehawk_and_crow_letter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The policy and structural changes to the Institute continued throughout the 1970s.

The Aboriginal Advisory Committee was established in 1975, and consisted of the six Aboriginal members of the AIAS Council.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert 2011, p164&lt;/ref&gt; Early recommendations including increased representation of Aboriginal people on committees and the AIAS Council as well as employment at the Institute.&lt;ref name="Moser,1995" /&gt; The committee was renamed in 1978, to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Advisory Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert 2011, p185&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975–1976, a category of research grants for Aboriginal researchers was introduced.&lt;ref name="Chapman,1988" /&gt; The emergence of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people filling the role of ‘cultural practitioner’, travelling to the AIAS to provide advice on projects and research being undertaken, was also documented from around 1976 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert 2011, p175&lt;/ref&gt;

The time Peter Ucko spent as Principal of the AIAS saw a phase of “rapid expansion”&lt;ref name="Peter Ucko Obituary" /&gt; for the Institute.

The AIAS Film Unit that had operated in Sydney until 1973 was re-established in Canberra in 1975. Prominent American-born [[ethnographic film]]maker David MacDougall was appointed as the Director of this new AIAS Film Unit. With his wife and filmmaking partner Judith, and Kim McKenzie, the Film Unit operated until 1988 when its functions were absorbed back into the Institute.&lt;ref name="Bryson,Recording culture in transition" /&gt;

During the MacDougall/McKenzie era, a new style of ethnographic film was explored.&lt;ref name="Ethno film,ASO"&gt;'Australian Ethnographic Film', Australian Screen Online website, http://aso.gov.au/titles/collections/ethnographic-film-in-Australia/, retrieved 10 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; One that moved away from film as a scientific record in favour of telling the story of individuals lives.&lt;ref name="Bryson,Recording culture in transition" /&gt; The filmmakers also practised a more collaborative approach to their films, and chose to use translations and subtitles to give direct access to the subjects voice and thoughts rather than the dominant ‘voice of god’ narration style.&lt;ref name="Ethno film,ASO" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacDougall, David, 'Subtitling Ethnographic Films: Archetypes into Individualities', Visual Anthropology Review, 11 (1): 83–91&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most notable films produced towards the end of this period was ''Waiting for Harry'', a prize-winning film&lt;ref&gt;‘'Waiting for Harry’', Royal Anthropological Institute website, https://www.therai.org.uk/film/volume-ii-contents/waiting-for-harry {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129024103/https://www.therai.org.uk/film/volume-ii-contents/waiting-for-harry |date=29 November 2014 }}, retrieved 11 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; directed by Kim McKenzie with [[anthropologist]] [[Les Hiatt]] and now considered to exemplify the "style of collaborative filmmaking" the Film Unit favoured in their work.&lt;ref name="Ethno film,ASO" /&gt;

The power of film to "influence opinion"&lt;ref name="Bryson,Recording culture in transition" /&gt; was becoming increasingly recognised and with this, the lack of representation of Aboriginal people telling their own stories. In 1978, a meeting chaired by prominent activist and academic [[Marcia Langton]] expressed these concerns, arguing for greater access to film and video in Aboriginal communities, and training in film production by the AIAS.&lt;ref name="Bryson,Recording culture in transition" /&gt;

By the following year, the AIAS Film Unit had begun to implement a training program&lt;ref name="Bryson,Recording culture in transition" /&gt; and had started employing trainee Aboriginal filmmakers on productions by the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;'A Short History of Indigenous Filmmaking', Australian Screen Online website, http://aso.gov.au/titles/collections/indigenous-filmmaking/, retrieved 10 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The AIAS began presenting a biennial Wentworth Lecture in 1978, named as a tribute to [[William Wentworth (Australian politician)|W.C. Wentworth]] for his role in establishing the Institute.&lt;ref name="Chapman,1988" /&gt; The lecture is presented by prominent person with knowledge or experience relating to issues affecting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in Australia today.&lt;ref name="Wentworth Lecture"/&gt;

The expansion of the Institute continued into the 1980s. The Aboriginal Studies Press began publishing the Australian Aboriginal Studies Journal in 1983,&lt;ref&gt;Australian aboriginal studies: journal of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies, Deaking University Library, http://encore.deakin.edu.au/iii/encore/record/C__Rb2865270, retrieved 17 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; a peer-reviewed journal aimed at  “promoting high-quality research in Australian Indigenous studies.”&lt;ref name="ASJ"&gt;‘Australian Aboriginal Studies online’, Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (AIATSIS) website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/publications/australian-aboriginal-studies-journal, retrieved 17 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, the AIAS established a task force that identified the prevailing need for further ‘Aboriginalisation’ of the Institute’s workforce. At the time, there were four Aboriginal staff members, making up around 7% of the total staff.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert 2011, p280&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed in 1985 with the creation of the role of Aboriginal Studies Coordination Officer within the AIAS, whose responsibilities involved improving access for Aboriginal people to the research and resources of the Institute.&lt;ref name="Chapman,1988" /&gt;

The ‘After 200 Years’ project was launched in 1985, aiming to fill some of the gaps in the AIAS photographic collection; particularly images of daily life in the southern, urban parts of Australia. Aboriginal involvement in selecting subject matter, photographing and documenting the collection was a major part of the project. The three-year project culminated in the publication of a book containing hundreds of photographs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and selected by them to represent their community.&lt;ref name="After 200 Years"&gt;Taylor, Penny.

The Rock Art Protection Program (RAPP) commenced in 1986 following a request for such an initiative by the then Minister of Aboriginal Affairs [[Clyde Holding]]. The aim of the RAPP was to protect Australian Indigenous rock art. Grants were approved by the Institute to fund various projects related to rock art protection.&lt;ref&gt;Ward. Graeme K, 'The role of AIATSIS in research and protection of Australian rock art', in: ''Rock Art Research''. Vol 28, no. 1 (May 2011), p 7-16&lt;/ref&gt;

The collections were also expanding, and by 1987 the AIATSIS library encompassed the print collections, a special Bibliographic Section and the Resource Centre (which contained the Institute’s audiovisual materials).&lt;ref name="Chapman,1988" /&gt;

Between 1987 and 1989, the survival of the AIAS as an independent statutory body was tied to a proposal for a new statutory commission that would take over all aspects of the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert 2011, pp288-308&lt;/ref&gt; This commission would become the [[Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission]] (ATSIC), conceived in an Act of Parliament in 1989.&lt;ref name="aph.gov.au"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Kingsley, 'ATSIC: Origins and Issues for the Future’, A Critical Review of Public Domain Research and Other Materials, AIATSIS Research Discussion Paper # 12, 2004, p5, http://aiatsis.gov.au/sites/default/files/products/discussion_paper/palmerk-dp12-atsic-origins-issues-future-research.pdf, retrieved 17 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The AIAS would not be folded into this commission; instead it would be recreated under a new Act with a new name.&lt;ref name="Our history"/&gt;

===AIATSIS (1989–now)===
The Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) Act was passed by parliament in 1989, replacing the AIAS Act.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies Act 1989, http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/aioaatsisa1989702/, retrieved 20 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The newly established AIATSIS had a reduced Council consisting of nine members,&lt;ref name="Our history"/&gt; with the AIATSIS Act specifying that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people hold a minimum of five of these Council positions.&lt;ref&gt;AIATSIS Act 1989, Section 12, http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/aioaatsisa1989702/s12.html, retrieved 17 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

AIATSIS publishes the Guidelines for Ethical Research in Australian Indigenous Studies (referred to as GERAIS),&lt;ref&gt;''Guidelines for Ethical Research in Indigenous Studies'', Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, Canberra, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; a document considered to be the leading ethics guidelines for conducting research in and with Indigenous communities in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Janke, Terri, ''Writing up Indigenous research: authorship, copyright and Indigenous knowledge systems'',Terri Janke and Co, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The guidelines consist of 14 principles. These principles broadly fit under the following themes:

*rights, respect and recognition
*negotiation, consultation, agreement and mutual understanding
*participation, collaboration and partnership
*benefits, outcomes and giving back
*managing research: use, storage and access, and
*reporting and compliance&lt;ref name="EthicsMedia"&gt;‘Guidelines for Ethical Research in Australian Indigenous Studies’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/research/ethical-research/guidelines-ethical-research-australian-indigenous-studies, retrieved 19 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The GERAIS document is required reading for researchers applying for Ethical Clearance for research sponsored by AIATSIS.&lt;ref name="EthicsApplication"&gt;‘Application process’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/research/ethical-research/application-process, retrieved 19 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Janke, Terri, Writing up Indigenous research:  authorship, copyright and Indigenous knowledge system, Terri Janke and Co, 2009, p15&lt;/ref&gt; However, the guidelines are also intended by AIATSIS to inform all research in the field of Indigenous studies.&lt;ref name=GERAIS /&gt;

Originally published by AIATSIS in 2000, the latest version of the GERAIS document was published in 2012. This update was made to reflect legal and technological developments that had occurred since original publication. In particular, in the area of intellectual property and the rights of Indigenous people in their traditional knowledge and cultural expressions as well as progress in digitisation technologies and data and information management.&lt;ref name=GERAIS /&gt;&lt;ref name=EthicsMedia /&gt;

These changes reflect AIATSIS’ support for the importance of research projects involving appropriate ethical conduct and rights protection for both the way data is collected during research and the findings and materials generated through that research.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Michael. ''Bringing ethics up to date: a review of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies ethical guidelines''. In: Australian Aboriginal Studies. no. 2,2010, p. 10-21&lt;/ref&gt;

The GERAIS document is the first point of reference in the ethical review process researchers must undergo before AIATSIS will sponsor a research project. All research projects are reviewed by the Research Ethics Committee for approval, using the following project documents:

*an ethical clearance proposal, using the GERAIS document as a guide,
*a plain English statement to explain to participants what the project is and how it will be conducted, and
*informed consent forms, that are completed by participants of the research.&lt;ref name=EthicsApplication /&gt;

In 2013, AIATSIS was involved in the review of two [[National Health and Medical Research Council]] research ethics guidelines relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health research.&lt;ref&gt;'Evaluation of NHMRC Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Research Ethics', The Lowitja Institute website, http://www.lowitja.org.au/nhmrc-research-ethics, 20 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Native Title research===
AIATSIS began undertaking Native Title research activities through the Native Title Research Unit in 1993, following the 1992 [[Mabo v Queensland (No 2)|Mabo v Queensland]] [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] decision. Native Title research at AIATSIS is primarily funded through the [[Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (Australia)|Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet]]&lt;ref name="NT main"&gt;'Native title and traditional ownership', AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/research/research-themes/native-title, retrieved 18 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; but research has also been conducted in partnership with other departments and organisations including the [[Australian National University]], the [[Australian Conservation Foundation]] and the [[Federal Court of Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;'Native Title and traditional ownership partners', AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/research/research-themes/native-title/partners, retrieved 18 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The Native Title Research Advisory Committee, the Research Advisory Committee and the AIATSIS Council oversee the work conducted in Native Title and traditional ownership research at AIATSIS.&lt;ref name="NT main" /&gt;

AIATSIS conducts a range of research projects relating to Native Title and traditional ownership, including Native Title and cultural heritage, Native Title and fresh and sea water, and Prescribed Body Corporates.&lt;ref&gt;'Native Title and traditional ownership current projects', AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/research/research-themes/native-title/current, retrieved 18 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of Native Title research at AIATSIS is to monitor outcomes of Native Title and through research and study, provide advice on Native Title policy development.&lt;ref name="NT main" /&gt; The Institute publishes a range of materials relating to Native Title including books, discussion papers, research reports and a Native Title Newsletter.&lt;ref&gt;‘About NTRU Publications’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/research/research-themes/native-title-and-traditional-ownership/native-title-and-traditional-ownership-resources-and-information-services, retrieved 18 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;‘Native Title Corporations’, http://www.nativetitle.org.au/research.html, retrieved 2 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections==

===Overview===
AIATSIS is the only Commonwealth institution responsible for collecting and maintaining materials documenting the oral and visual traditions and histories of Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.&lt;ref name=CDP /&gt; The Institute identifies its collection as a “keeping place for culturally significant objects” that is “a resource for anybody looking to improve their knowledge of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander history and culture.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;‘AIATSIS Collections’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute's holdings represent thousands of years of history and more than 500 Australian Indigenous languages, dialects and groups. This collection supports, and is a result of, research in the fields of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies.&lt;ref name=CDP /&gt;

An independent assessment in 2014 confirmed that AIATSIS holds over 6 million feet of film,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; over 40,000 hours of audio, 12,800 unpublished manuscripts and record series, 653,000 photographs, and 120,000 print and published materials (3,000 of which are rare books) among other miscellanea.&lt;ref&gt;’50 years of culture and collections’, 15 December 2014, http://www.indigenous.gov.au/news-and-media/stories/50-years-culture-and-collections&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of items within the AIATSIS collection that have been both nationally and internationally recognised as significant:

The Audiovisual Archives also holds copies of the first audio recorded in Australia;&lt;ref&gt;‘Musical Connections: The Life and Work of Alice Moyle, AIATSIS Online Exhibition, http://aiatsis.gov.au/archive_digitised_collections/alice/home.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320123750/http://aiatsis.gov.au/archive_digitised_collections/alice/home.html |date=20 March 2015 }}, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; a series of ethnographic wax cylinder recordings made in the Torres Strait Islands in 1898.  The Cambridge Anthropological Expedition to the Torres Strait, led by [[Alfred Cort Haddon]], recorded songs and speech from Mer/Murray Island, Mabuiag/Jervis Island, Saibai Island, Tudu Island and Iama/Yam Island.

The AIATSIS collection is housed and managed through the Library and the Audiovisual Archive,&lt;ref name="Barbara Lewincamp 2003"&gt;Barbara Lewincamp &amp; Julie Faulkner (2003) 'A keyhole to the collection: the AIATSIS Library Digitisation Pilot Program’, ‘’The Australian Library Journal’’, 52:3, 239–245, DOI: 10.1080/00049670.2003.10721551&lt;/ref&gt; and is broadly categorised into the following groups:

'''Art and artefact:''' a collection of items including ritual objects, folk art, children’s art and modern or ‘high art’ and span from the late 19th century to the present day. This sub-collection comprises around 600 artworks and 500 artefacts, acquired either as a result of AIATSIS-sponsored field research or through donation or purchase.&lt;ref&gt;‘Art and artefacts’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/about-collections/art-and-artefacts, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Books and printed material:''' a collection of books, pamphlets, serials including magazines and government reports, reference publications such as dictionaries and other published material.

[[File:Colour slides from the Wright collection containing images of Upper Yule River Rock Art.jpg|thumb|left|Colour slides from the Wright collection (WRIGHT.B02.CS) containing images of Upper Yule River Rock Art]]
'''Manuscripts and rare books:''' a collection of more than 11,700 manuscripts,&lt;ref&gt;‘AIATSIS Collections Highlights’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; 2,600 rare books dating from 1766,&lt;ref&gt;Callander, John, ‘’Terra australis cognita, or, Voyages to the Terra australis’’, Printed for the author and sold by Messrs Hawes, Clark, and Collins, in Pater-noster-Row, London, 1766–1768, call number RB C156.25/T1, AIATSIS library catalogue&lt;/ref&gt; 2,200 rare pamphlets and 1,700 rare serial titles consisting of 14,650 issues held in secure, environmentally controlled storage. Items are included in this classification on the basis of their age, rarity, value or sensitivity of the content for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Among these items are the Sorry Books and the [[William Edward Hanley Stanner|WEH Stanner]] papers.&lt;ref&gt;'Manuscripts and rare books', AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/about-collections/manuscripts-and-rare-books, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pictorial:''' this collection contains roughly 650,000 photographs that date from modern day as far back as the late 1800s, and more than 90% of images in the pictorial collection are unique to AIATSIS, making it the most comprehensive record of its kind relating to Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.&lt;ref&gt;‘Pictorial’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/about-collections/pictorial, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sound:''' a collection of many unique and unpublished sound recordings totalling approximately 40,000 hours of audio.

===Acquisitions===
Since the establishment of the Institute in 1964, the AIATSIS collection has been developed through acquisition by donation, gift and purchase or, through materials created and collected during the work of ethnographic field researchers and filmmakers funded by the AIATSIS grants program. The collection has also been built through deposits of materials, an arrangement which permits the original owners to assign access and use conditions appropriate to the cultural information contained in the items.

AIATSIS’ approach to collection building is based on three primary criteria:

:1.	Comprehensiveness – the aim is to have the collection be as comprehensive as possible. Given limited resources, the Audiovisual Archive focuses primarily on unpublished audio and visual materials and the Library generally on published materials. Other items are collected where possible. 
:2.	Significance – items that meet this criteria are considered to make ‘a lasting contribution to worldwide knowledge’, reflect current AIATSIS research areas, valued by a particular Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander community, are not well represented in other collections, have a link to AIATSIS’ own history. 
:3.	Representativeness – when resources are limited, AIATSIS will focus on collecting items that are ‘representative of a particular class of creativity, research discipline or mode of cultural production.’&lt;ref name=CDP /&gt;

===Collection management===
Once material has been acquired by AIATSIS, the Institute faces the challenges of maintaining a cultural resource collection.&lt;ref&gt;AIATSIS Act 1989, Section 5 (e)&lt;/ref&gt; This is achieved through a collection management plan that involves processes of recording and cataloguing, and appropriate storage and handling to extend the life of physical items and preserving their content through format shifting.

Preservation of physical items in the collection is achieved in two key ways:

:1.	Assessment and monitoring for contaminants, such as insects and mould, as well as any potential deterioration through environmental factors or physical damage.&lt;ref name=CMP&gt;‘’AIATSIS Collection Management Plan 2013–2016’’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/sites/default/files/docs/about-us/collection-management-plan.pdf, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
:2.	Storage of collection items in climate-controlled vaults, to maintain their integrity and to minimise contact with deteriorating agents such as moisture and light. The Institute also follows international archiving guidelines for the storage and preservation of materials.&lt;ref&gt;‘Preservation, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/caring-collection/preservation, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
There are a wide variety of analogue photograph, tape and film formats held in the AIATSIS collection, which pose special preservation and future access risks. The age of some of these formats and materials, combined with the varying conditions in which they were stored prior to their acquisition by AIATSIS, heightens the deterioration of the media. Another preservation issue inherent in these analogue materials is the machines that can play back that particular format, as in some cases the material and the playback device are no longer manufactured. To manage these risks and maintain future access to the collection, preservation of the actual content contained in collection items is also achieved through a program of digitisation.&lt;ref name="Caring collection"&gt;‘Caring for the collection’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/caring-collection, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:An AIATSIS pictorial technician prepares a tin type photograph for scanning.jpg|thumb|An AIATSIS pictorial technician prepares a tin type photograph for scanning]]Due to the potential issues of long-term archiving and storage of digital items, the opposite process is often employed to ensure access and preservation.&lt;ref&gt;'Future Watch: Strategies for Long-Term Preservation of Electronic Records’, Gordon E.J Hoke, CRM, http://content.arma.org/IMM/May-June2012/futurewatchstrategiesforlongtermpreservation.aspx, retrieved 25 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;‘Electronic Records – Problem Solved?: the Victorian Electronic Records Strategy and the future of electronic record keeping in Victoria’, VALA website, http://www.vala.org.au/vala2000/2000pdf/Gib_Hea.PDF, retrieved 25 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of digital publications and manuscripts, the originals will often be printed and incorporated into the print collections as an additional preservation measure.

The AIATSIS collection holds material that is sensitive and/or secret/sacred to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.&lt;ref&gt;‘Using the collection’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/using-collection, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with its founding Act,&lt;ref&gt;AIATSIS Act, Section 41, http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/aioaatsisa1989702/s41.html, retrieved 23 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and as part of their collection management plan, AIATSIS adheres to strict protocols when handling and processing these sensitive items. The Institute also supports and adheres to the protocols developed by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Library, Information and Resource Network (ATSILIRN).&lt;ref name="ATSILIRN" /&gt; Restricted visual media such as photographs and printed items are stored separately to the rest of the collection and audio and moving image items are not played until any cultural requirements are checked. Restricted material must also be carefully handled during digitisation, which means that the work is carried out in secured conditions such as enclosed booths and by staff that can meet the protocols of the item being digitised.&lt;ref name="CAUP"&gt;‘AIATSIS Collection Access and Use Policy’, p 8, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/sites/default/files/docs/about-us/collections-access-use-policy.pdf, retrieved 12 March  2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digitisation program===
AIATSIS launched its Library Digitisation Pilot Program in 2001, before which the Library had no dedicated digitisation equipment or policies for managing digital materials. This two-year program was originally funded by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), and involved the creation of digital collections across the institution.&lt;ref name="Barbara Lewincamp 2003"/&gt;

Since then AIATSIS has continued to incorporate digitisation of the collection into its management plan,&lt;ref name=CMP /&gt; but have publicly stated that an increase in funding is required for the Institute to digitise some of the at risk formats held in the collection before those items are lost.&lt;ref&gt;Barnsley, Warren, 'AIATSIS digitisation funding welcome but still "inadequate"', '’National Indigenous Radio Service'’, 16 May 2014, http://nirs.org.au/blog/NEWS/article/33902/AIATSIS-digitisation-funding-welcome-but-still-inadequate.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raggatt, Matthew, ‘Historic indigenous collection in "severe and catastrophic state"’, ‘’The Canberra Times’’, 6 December 2014, http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/historic-indigenous-collection-in-severe-and-catastrophic-state-20141206-121hl1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Given these limitations, AIATSIS prioritises the selection of materials for digitisation using factors including significance of the item/s, the level of deterioration, cultural protocols, copyright status, and client demand.&lt;ref name=CMP /&gt;&lt;ref name="Caring collection" /&gt; One of the identified priorities of the program is to digitise and preserve all of the audiovisual collection currently on endangered magnetic tape formats by the 2025 deadline set by UNESCO.&lt;ref name=CMP /&gt;

===Access to the collection===
[[File:Library stacks at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, Canberra ACT Australia.tif|thumb|left|Library stacks showing some of the print collection available at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, in Canberra, ACT, Australia]]
The collection is housed in the AIATSIS building on Acton Peninsula and is accessible through a number of resources. The AIATSIS Library is open to the public and holds a range of printed materials including manuscripts, journals, readers in different Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages, dictionaries, published books and rare books, maps, and posters.

Access to AIATSIS' print and manuscript collections can be made through the Library's Stanner Reading Room and the film, sound and pictorial collections by appointment through the Access Unit. These physical access points are open limited hours.&lt;ref&gt;'Visiting the collection', AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/using-collection/visiting-collection, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The AIATSIS Digitisation Program contributes to increased access to the collection; whether access is through on site resources, the provision of copies of materials or the sharing of the collection online. Due to increasing obsolescence of analogue formats, AIATSIS identifies digitisation as the way to preserve those items for future generations  to access.&lt;ref name=CDP /&gt; This is considered to be particularly important for facilitating “remote access by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities” as well as for access by researchers and the general public.&lt;ref name=CMP /&gt;

The AIATSIS Access Unit runs a program called Return of Material to Indigenous Communities (ROMTIC), through which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander clients are provided with up to twenty copies of collection materials that relate to their language group or family. This service is limited to items that have been preserved, so AIATSIS’ digitisation program has allowed an increasing number of digital items available to ROMTIC clients.&lt;ref&gt;‘Return of materials to Indigenous communities’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/using-collection/return-material-indigenous-communities, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

AIATSIS also makes the collection available through a series of online exhibitions and digitised collection material published on their website.&lt;ref&gt;‘Collections online’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/collections-onlinel{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; These showcase different themes or discrete collections of material, including:

Access to the AIATSIS collection is also dictated by legislation governing the Institute and in some instances by legal agreements outlining the terms under which collection materials can be used.

The terms for access to the AIATSIS collection are in the first instance set by the AIATSIS Act, Section 41. This section states:

:1.	"Where information or other matter has been deposited with the Institute under conditions of restricted access, the Institute or the Council shall not disclose that information or other matter except in accordance with those conditions.
:2.	The Institute or the Council shall not disclose information or other matter held by it (including information or other matter covered by subsection (1)) if that disclosure would be inconsistent with the views or sensitivities of relevant Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders."&lt;ref&gt;AIATSIS Act 1989, Section 41, http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/aioaatsisa1989702/s41.html, retrieved 12 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The conditions referred to in Section 41(1) of the AIATSIS Act are usually covered in the agreement that AIATSIS enters into when material is deposited. These agreements, along with the section 41(2) of the Act, can govern the way that unpublished material can be accessed and used.&lt;ref name=CAUP /&gt;

Access to and use of material in the AIATSIS collection is also subject to the terms set out in the [[Australian Copyright Act 1968|Copyright Act (1968)]].&lt;ref&gt;'Ordering collection items', AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/using-collection/ordering-collection-items, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

When a donation or deposit is being made, AIATSIS requests to be made aware of any sensitive items included in the material.&lt;ref&gt;‘Donate to the collection’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/donate-collection, retrieved 12  March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The secret or sacred nature of information contained in many collection items is an important factor in access to the AIATSIS collection. To protect items of high cultural sensitivity and reflect appropriate cultural values, access to items that contain culturally sensitive information are restricted to groups or individuals who have the permission of the relevant Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander community and the depositor if restrictions have been applied by them.&lt;ref&gt;‘AIATSIS Collection Access and Use Policy’, p 7, 9, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/sites/default/files/docs/about-us/collections-access-use-policy.pdf, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

AIATSIS also acknowledges the [[United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] and in particular Article 31's recognition of the right of Indigenous people to "maintain, control, protect and develop their cultural heritage, traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions."&lt;ref name=CMP /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, United Nations, 2000, http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/DRIPS_en.pdf, retrieved 12 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to these complex issues AIATSIS developed an overarching Access and Use Policy in 2014, to “manage legal and cultural rights over material while maximising accessibility.”&lt;ref&gt;AIATSIS Annual Report 2013-2014, p42, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/publications/products/aiatsis-annual-report-2013-2014, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collection resources===
Since its inception, AIATSIS has developed and maintained a range of resources to enhance discoverability of the collection.

One of the most significant of these resources is the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Biographical Index (ABI). The ABI had its beginnings in 1979 as a non-selective biographical register of names, constructed using information on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people from published material in the collection. In the early years of the biographical register, it was hoped it could “provide an important record of the achievements of Aboriginal people, and be a source of pride for generations to come".&lt;ref&gt;Parkes, Laurie and Barwick, Diane. Beginning a national Aboriginal biographical register at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies. Aboriginal history. Vol. 6 pt. 2, 1982. p. 135-138&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the index continues to be updated, now containing over 70,000 records and searchable online through AIATSIS’ collection catalogue.&lt;ref&gt;‘The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Biographical Index’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/research/guides-and-resources/aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-biographical-index, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Other resources available on site include the Perfect Pictures Database, which contains over 140,000 digitised images from the AIATSIS Photographic Collection. This database is added to as more images are digitised and only includes images that are free of secret/sacred access restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;‘Pictures database’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/about-collections/pictorial/pictures-database, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

AIATSIS also hosts or contributes to a number of online resources, aimed at facilitating access to and understanding of the collection. These include:

*'''Mura''' – this is AIATSIS’ collection catalogue, which can be searched online.&lt;ref&gt;‘Search the collection’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/using-collection/search-collection, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Trove''' – the AIATSIS collection can be searched through the National Library of Australia’s Trove.&lt;ref&gt;‘Introduction to Trove’ video, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/sites/default/files/docs/research-and-guides/guides-and-resources/Tutorial-Introduction-to-Trove.swf, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; AIATSIS uses this platform as a means to further enhancing discoverability of and access to its collections.&lt;ref&gt;‘’Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies: Agency resources and planned performance’’, Department of Industry and Science website, http://www.industry.gov.au/AboutUs/Budget/Documents/PortfolioBudgetStatementsAIATSIS2011-12.pdf, retrieved 23 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Thesauri''' – there are three Thesauri that AIATSIS have created and make available through their website. These relate to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages, place names and subject areas of study.&lt;ref&gt;‘AIATSIS Pathways: Gateway to the AIATSIS Thesauri’, AIATSIS website, http://www1.aiatsis.gov.au/thesaurus/language/language.asp, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Library of Congress has approved these thesauri for use in bibliographic records worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;‘Pathways thesauri’, AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/publications/products/pathways-thesauri, retrieved 12 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location of the Institute==
[[File:Institute of Aboriginal Studies, Canberra 2007.JPG|thumb|The west wing of the AIATSIS building designed by [[Ashton Raggatt McDougall]], is a black replica of [[Le Corbusier]]'s iconic [[Villa Savoye]]]]

AIATSIS is located on the [[Acton Peninsula]]&lt;ref&gt;'Contact us', AIATSIS website, http://aiatsis.gov.au/get-involved/contact-us, retrieved 18 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; in a building that was newly built for the Institute and opened in 2001. The building was officially opened by the Honourable [[William Wentworth (Australian politician)|W.C. Wentworth]] and [[Ken Colbung|Mr Ken Colbung]]. As part of the opening the [[Ngunnawal people]], the traditional owners of the land on which the AIATSIS building stands performed a [[Welcome to Country and Acknowledgement of Country|Welcome to Country]] and [[smoking ceremony]], and the Anbarra people from North Central Arnhem Land performed a friendship ceremony, known as Rom.&lt;ref name="Koori Mail building"&gt;'AIATSIS finds a home', The Koori Mail, Issue 261, Wednesday 3 October 2001, p10, http://aiatsis.gov.au/collections/collections-online/digitised-collections/koori-mail/koori-mail-issues&lt;/ref&gt;

The architect, [[Howard Raggatt|Howard Ragatt]] of the firm Ashton Raggatt McDougall designed the building for AIATSIS and for its neighbour on the Acton Peninsula, the [[National Museum of Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;The National Museum of Australia as Danse Macabre' in Healy, C &amp; Witcomb, A (eds), South Pacific Museums: Experiments in Culture, Monash University ePress, Victoria, 2006, p191&lt;/ref&gt; The building cost $13.75 million and was funded by the Commonwealth Government’s Centenary of Federation Grants Program.&lt;ref name="Koori Mail building"/&gt;

The design of the AIATSIS building has been the subject of differing interpretations. The rear of the building has been described as a black copy of pioneer architect [[Le Corbusier]]'s 1920's [[Villa Savoye]] in France.&lt;ref&gt;'The National Museum of Australia as Danse Macabre' in Healy, C &amp; Witcomb, A (eds), South Pacific Museums: Experiments in Culture, Monash University ePress, Victoria, 2006, p198&lt;/ref&gt; The architect, Howard Raggatt, was quoted as confirming this influence&lt;ref&gt;“Letters and Fixes: NMA, AIATSIS and Consultation”, Architecture Australia website, http://architectureau.com/articles/letters-and-fixes-6/, retrieved 5 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt; but has also stated that it is designed to be reminiscent of [[Sidney Nolan]]'s famous paintings of Ned Kelly.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, Dimitry (ed), National Museum of Australia: Tangled Destinies, Images Publishing, Victoria, 2002, p66&lt;/ref&gt;

During design of the AIATSIS building, it was reoriented from original plans to save two [[Eucalyptus bridgesiana|Apple Box trees]] that were identified as significant to the Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Report relating to the proposed new facilities for the National Museum of Australia and the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, Parliament of Australia, 1998, p64&lt;/ref&gt;

The language is closely related to [[Larestani language|Larestani]] and [[Kumzari dialect|Kumzari]] languages, it forms a transitional dialect group to northwestern Iranian [[Balochi language|Balochi]], due to intense areal contact, with South Bashkardi being more divergent from its southwestern Iranian neighbours than North Bashkardi.&lt;ref name=Iranica&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title=Baškardi|author-last=Skjærvø|author-first=Prods Oktor|author-link=Prods Oktor Skjaervo|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]|editor-last=Yarshater|editor-first=Ehsan|editor-link=Ehsan Yarshater|year=1988|publisher=Routledge|place=London and New York|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/baskardi-basakerdi-collective-designation-for-numerous-dialects-spoken-in-southeastern-iran-from-bandar-e-abbas-eastwar|accessdate=July 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bashkir language''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɑː|ʃ|k|ɪər|,_|ˈ|b|æ|ʃ|-}}, башҡорт теле {{IPA-ba|bɑʃˈqort tɘˈlɘ||bashqort_tele.ogg}}) is a [[Turkic language]] belonging to the [[Kypchak languages|Kipchak]] branch.  It is co-official with [[Russian language|Russian]] in the [[Bashkortostan|Republic of Bashkortostan]], [[European Russia]] and has approximately 1.2 million speakers in Russia. Bashkir has three [[dialect]]s: Southern, Eastern and Northwestern.

==Speakers==
[[File:Ареал расселения башкир в Волго-Уральском регионе. По данным Всероссийской переписи населения 2010 года.png|thumb|Bashkirs in Russia by administrative districts ([[raions]]) in 2010]]
Speakers of Bashkir mostly live in the [[Russia]]n republic of [[Bashkortostan]]. Many speakers also live in [[Tatarstan]], [[Chelyabinsk Oblast|Chelyabinsk]], [[Orenburg Oblast|Orenburg]], [[Tyumen Oblast|Tyumen]], [[Sverdlovsk Oblast|Sverdlovsk]] and [[Kurgan Oblast]]s and other regions of [[Russia]]. Minor Bashkir groups also live in [[Kazakhstan]] and other countries.

==Classification==
Bashkir together with [[Tatar language|Tatar]] belongs to the Bulgaric ({{lang-ru|кыпчакско-булгарская}}) subgroups of the [[Kipchak languages]]. They both share the same vocalism and the vowel shifts (see [[#Historical shifts|below]]) that make both the languages stand apart from most other Kipchak and [[Oghuz Turkic]] languages.

However, Baskrir differs from Tatar in several important ways:
* Bashkir has dental fricatives {{IPAslink|θ}} and {{IPAslink|ð}} in the place of Tatar (and other Turkic) {{IPAslink|s}} and  {{IPAslink|z}}. Bashkir {{IPAslink|θ}} and {{IPAslink|ð}}, however, cannot begin a word (there are only two exceptions: ҙур ''zur'' 'big', and the particle/conjunction ҙа/ҙә ''źa/źä''). The only other Turkic language with a similar feature is [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]]. However, in Bashkir {{IPAslink|θ}} and {{IPAslink|ð}} are two independent phonemes, different from {{IPAslink|s}} and {{IPAslink|z}}, whereas in Turkmen {{IPAslink|θ}} and {{IPAslink|ð}} are just two main allophonic realizations of common Turkic {{IPAslink|s}} and {{IPAslink|z}} (there are no {{IPAslink|s}} and {{IPAslink|z}} phonemes in Turkmen). 
* The word-initial and morpheme-initial {{IPAslink|s}} is turned into {{IPAslink|h}}. An example of both features can be Tatar сүз ''süz'' {{IPA-tt|syz|}} and Bashkir һүҙ ''hüź'' {{IPA-ba|hyθ|}}, both meaning "word".
* Common Turkic {{IPAslink|tʃ}} (Tatar {{IPAslink|ɕ}}) is turned into Bashkir {{IPAslink|s}}, e.g., Turkish ''ağaç'' {{IPA-tr|ɑːtʃ|}}, Tatar агач ''ağaç'' {{IPA-tt|ɑˈʁɑɕ|}} and Bashkir ағас ''ağas'' {{IPA-tt|ɑˈʁɑs|}}, all meaning "tree".
* The word-initial {{IPAslink|ʑ}} in Tatar always corresponds to {{IPAslink|j}} in Standard Bashkir, e.g., Tatar җылы ''cılı'' {{IPA-tt|ʑɤˈlɤ|}} and Bashkir йылы ''yılı'' {{IPA-tt|jɤˈlɤ|}}, both meaning "warm". However, the eastern and northern dialects of Bashkir have the {{IPAslink|j}} &gt; /{{IPA link|ʑ}}~{{IPA link|ʒ}}/ shift.

The Bashkir orthography is more explicit. {{IPAslink|q}} and {{IPAslink|ʁ}} are written with their own letters '''Ҡ ҡ''' and '''Ғ ғ''', whereas in Tatar they are treated as positional allophones of {{IPAslink|k}} and {{IPAslink|ɡ}}, written '''К к''' and '''Г г'''.

Labial [[vowel harmony]] in Bashkir is written explicitly, e.g. Tatar тормышым ''tormışım'' and Bashkir тормошом ''tormoşom'', both pronounced {{IPA|[tormoˈʃom]}}, meaning "my life".

==Orthography==
[[File:Inscription in Ufa Airport.jpg|thumb|Trilingual sign in the [[Ufa International Airport|Ufa Airport]] in Bashkir, Russian and English]]
After the adoption of [[Islam]], which began in the 10th century and lasted for several centuries, the Bashkirs began to use [[Turki]] as a written language. Turki was written in a variant of the [[Arabic script]].

In 1923, a writing system based on the [[Arabic script]] was specifically created for the Bashkir language. At the same time, the Bashkir literary language was created, moving away from the older written Turkic influences. At first, it used a modified Arabic [[alphabet]]. In 1930 it was replaced with the [[Unified Turkic Latin Alphabet]], which was in turn replaced with an adapted [[Cyrillic]] alphabet in 1939.

The modern alphabet used by Bashkir is based on the [[Russian alphabet]], with the addition of the following letters: [[Ә|Ә ә]] {{IPAslink|æ}}, [[Ө|Ө ө]] {{IPAslink|ø}}, [[Ү|Ү ү]] {{IPAblink|y}}, [[Ғ|Ғ ғ]] {{IPAslink|ʁ}}, [[Ҡ|Ҡ ҡ]] {{IPAslink|q}}, [[Ң|Ң ң]] {{IPAslink|ŋ}}, [[Ҙ|Ҙ ҙ]] {{IPAslink|ð}}, [[Ҫ|Ҫ ҫ]] {{IPAslink|θ}}, [[Һ|Һ һ]] {{IPAslink|h}}.

==Phonology==
===Vowels===
Bashkir has nine native vowels, and three or four loaned vowels (mainly in Russian loanwords).&lt;ref name="Berta"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Turkic languages|last=Berta|first=Árpád|chapter=Tatar and Bashkir|year=1998|editor-last=Johanson|editor-first=Lars |editor-last2=Csató|editor-first2=Éva Á.|publisher=Routledge|pages=283-300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phonetically, the native vowels are approximately thus (with the Cyrillic letters and the usual Latin romanization in angle brackets; '''R+''' means rounded):

|
|}

The two mid unrounded vowels are always short, in an unstressed position they are frequently elided, as in кеше ''keşe'' {{IPA|[kĕˈʃĕ]}} &gt; {{IPA|[kʃĕ]}} 'person', or ҡышы ''qışı'' {{IPA|[qɤ̆ˈʃɤ̆]}} &gt; {{IPA|[qʃɤ̆]}} '(his) winter'.&lt;ref name="Berta" /&gt; Low back {{IPAslink|ɑ}} is rounded {{IPAblink|ɒ}} in the first syllable and after {{IPAblink|ɒ}}, but not in the last, as in бала ''bala'' {{IPA|[bɒˈlɑ]}} 'child', балаларға ''balalarğa'' {{IPA|[bɒlɒlɒrˈʁɑ]}} 'to children'.&lt;ref name="Berta" /&gt; In Russian loans there are also {{IPAblink|ɨ}}, {{IPAblink|ɛ}}, {{IPAblink|ɔ}} and {{IPAblink|ä}}, written the same as the native vowels: '''ы, е/э, о, а''' respectively.&lt;ref name="Berta" /&gt;
The mid vowels may be transcribed as lowered near-high [{{IPA link|ɪ|ɪ̞}}, {{IPA link|ʏ|ʏ̞}}, {{IPA link|ɯ|ɯ̞}}, {{IPA link|ʊ|ʊ̞}}].

====Historical shifts====
Historically, the Old Turkic mid vowels have [[Raising (phonetics)|raised]] from mid to high, whereas the Old Turkic high vowels have become the Bashkir reduced mid series. (The same shifts have also happened in [[Tatar language|Tatar]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Turkic languages|last=Johanson|first=Lars|chapter=The History of Turkic|year=1998|editor-last=Johanson|editor-first=Lars |editor-last2=Csató|editor-first2=Éva Á.|publisher=Routledge|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bermudian English''' is a [[Regional accents of English|regional accent of English]] found in [[Bermuda]], a British [[British Overseas Territories|overseas territory]] in the [[North Atlantic]]. [[Standard English]] is used in professional settings and in writing, while [[vernacular]] Bermudian English is spoken on more casual occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Thomas, "Notes on Bermudian Language", in "Bermuda connections", ''Smithsonian Folklife Festival. 2001''. Washington, DC: Smithsonian Institution, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Bermudian accent began to develop following settlement in the early 17th century, and retains traits of [[Early Modern English|Elizabethan English]].&lt;ref&gt;Petrone, Kelly.  [http://www.bermudatourism.com/Press/skins/aqua/Cover_Letter.pdf Welcome to the Bermuda Department of Tourism's Media Information Kit] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222084017/http://www.bermudatourism.com/Press/skins/aqua/Cover_Letter.pdf |date=December 22, 2010 }}, Corbin &amp; Associates, Ltd&lt;/ref&gt;

Casual observers tend to have difficulty in placing the Bermudian accent, as it differs from those that are clearly [[British English|British]], [[American English|American]] or [[Caribbean English|Caribbean]]; they also note that the accent tends to vary between individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Weller, Anthony. [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/15/magazine/celebration-bermuda.html Celebration Bermuda], ''The New York Times'', June 15, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  To Americans, it sounds slightly British, while the British find it more American.

==Categorisation==

Bermudian English has been called "one of the most severely underresearched varieties of English".&lt;ref&gt;Cecilia Cutler, Stephanie Hackert and Chanti Seymour, "Bermuda and Bahamas", in Ulrich Ammon (ed.), ''Sociolinguistics. An International Handbook''. 2nd ed. Vol. 3. Walter de Gruyter, 2006. {{ISBN|3-11-018418-4}}. p. 2066.&lt;/ref&gt; It primarily shows a mixture of traits typical of British English and American English, and is generally classified as a form of American (rather than Caribbean) English.&lt;ref&gt;Tom McArthur (ed.), ''Oxford Companion to the English Language''. Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 1992. {{ISBN|0-19-214183-X}}. pp. 116, 352.&lt;/ref&gt; The most detailed scholarly study of Bermudian English, in 1933, stated that this type of speech "would create least remark, if indeed any, between, say, [[Norfolk, Virginia]], and [[Charleston, South Carolina]]";&lt;ref&gt;Harry Morgan Ayres, "Bermudian English", ''American Speech'' 8:1 (1933), p. 4. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3181810 Available online to JSTOR subscribers]&lt;/ref&gt; British-Bermudian actor [[Earl Cameron (actor)|Earl Cameron]] noted that because the Bermudian accent sounded American, he was able to land a speaking role in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Bourne|first=Stephen|title=Black in British frame|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=2005|isbn=978-0-8264-7898-6 |pages =106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large scale West Indian immigration to Bermuda, especially Sandys and Pembroke parishes, began with the expansion of the [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|Royal Naval Dockyard]] (as a result of the lack of cheap, unskilled labour in Bermuda) at the turn of the twentieth century, and affected the dialect of certain demographic groups. Consequently, in certain aspects of vocalization, some Bermudian English dialects are close to some versions of Caribbean English,&lt;ref&gt;Cecilia Cutler, "English in the Turks and Caicos Islands: A look at Grand Turk" in ''Contact Englishes of the Eastern Caribbean'', ed. Michael Aceto and Jeffrey P. Williams. John Benjamins: 2003, pp. 51–80. {{ISBN|90-272-4890-7}}. p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; and some would bracket all these varieties to the broad region of the "English-speaking West Indies".&lt;ref&gt;John Wells, ''Accents of English 3: Beyond the British Isles''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1982. {{ISBN|0-521-29719-2}}. p. 561.&lt;/ref&gt; Azorean Portuguese has also impacted on Bermudian English as a result of immigration since the 1840s.

==Characteristics==

The accent's most evident characteristic is a variation in letter/sound assignment. The switching of {{IPA|[v]}} and {{IPA|[w]}},&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9hM6lBsiHswC&amp;dq=bermudian+english+spelling&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22The+Bermudian+inflection+is+characterized%22 ''Dependents information on Bermuda''], United States. Dept. of the Air Force, 1956, page 3&lt;/ref&gt; characteristic of many dialects in Southern England during the 18th and 19th centuries,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humnet.unipi.it/slifo/articolosantipolo.pdf On the Opposite Sides of the Continuum: Standard British English and Cockney. A Historical Outline of the Parallel Developments of the Two Varieties], Matteo Santipolo, Università degli Studi di Padova, Department of Linguistic and Literary Studies&lt;/ref&gt; and of {{IPA|[d]}} and {{IPA|[dʒ]}} (similarly to the dialects of English speakers of Gaelic heritage), when combined with a [[front vowel]], can both be seen in the title of a humorous glossary, ''Bermewjan Vurds'' (Bermudian Words).&lt;ref&gt;Peter A. Smith and Fred M. Barritt, ''[https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/archive/decouto/bvurds.html Bermewjan Vurds - a Dictionary of Conversational Bermudian]''. Hamilton, Bermuda: Lizard Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of {{IPA|[æ]}} and {{IPA|[ɛ]}} is interchangeable and vowels are often elongated.

'''Big business''' involves large-scale corporate-controlled [[financial market|financial]] or [[business sector|business]] activities. As a term, it describes activities that run from "huge transactions" to the more general "doing big things". The concept first rose in a symbolic sense after 1880 in connection with the combination movement that began in American [[commerce|business]] at that time.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} United States corporations that fall into the category of "big business" {{as of | 2015 | lc = on}} include [[ExxonMobil]], [[Walmart]], [[Google]], [[Microsoft]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[General Electric]], [[General Motors]], [[Citigroup]], [[Goldman Sachs]], and [[JPMorgan Chase]]. The largest German corporations {{as of | 2012 | lc = on}} included [[Daimler AG]], [[Deutsche Telekom]], [[Siemens]], and [[Deutsche Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;Forbes.com. [https://www.forbes.com/lists/2005/183/Rank_1.html "The Largest German Companies."] Accessed 2012-12-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the largest companies in the United Kingdom {{as of | 2012 | lc = on}} are [[HSBC]], [[Barclays]], [[WPP plc]], and [[BP]].&lt;ref&gt;Forbes.com. [https://www.forbes.com/2006/12/02/forbes40-hsbc-hbos-biz-cx_pm_1205uk40_intro.html "The U.K.'s 40 Largest Companies."] Accessed 2012-12-29.&lt;/ref&gt;
The latter half of the 19th century saw more technological advances and corporate growth in additional{{clarify|date=June 2015}} sectors, such as [[Petroleum industry|petroleum]], [[Machinery industry|machinery]], [[Chemical manufacturing|chemicals]], and [[Electrification|electrical equipment]]. (See [[Second Industrial Revolution]].)

==History==
===Early 20th century===
The [[automotive industry]] began modestly in the late-19th century, but grew rapidly following the development of large-scale [[gasoline]] production in the early 20th century.

====Post-World War II====
The relatively stable period of rebuilding after [[World War II]] led to new technologies (some of which were spin-offs from the war years) and new businesses.

=====Computers=====
The new technology of [[computer]]s spread worldwide in the post war years.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Businesses built around computer technology include: [[IBM]], [[Microsoft]], [[Apple Inc.]], [[Samsung]], and [[Intel]].

=====Electronics=====
Miniaturization and [[integrated circuit]]s, together with an expansion of [[radio]] and [[television]] technologies, provided fertile ground for business development. Electronics businesses include [[JVC]], [[Sony]] ([[Masaru Ibuka]] and [[Akio Morita]]), and [[Texas Instruments]] ([[Cecil H. Green]], [[J. Erik Jonsson]], [[Eugene McDermott]], and Patrick E. Chodery), while also the companies in the computer-section above can be considered electronics.

=====Energy=====
[[Nuclear power]] was added to [[fossil fuel]] as the main sources of energy.

==Criticism of big business==
The social consequences of the concentration of economic power in the hands of those persons controlling "big business" has been a constant concern both of [[economist]]s and of [[politician]]s since the end of the 19th century.  Various attempts have been made to investigate the effects of "bigness" upon labor, consumers, and investors, as well as upon prices and [[competition]]. "Big business" has been accused of a wide variety of misdeeds that range from the [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] of the [[working class]] to the [[Political corruption|corruption]] of politicians and the fomenting of [[war]].

===Influence over government===
Corporate concentration can lead to influence over government in areas such as tax policy, trade policy, environmental policy, foreign policy, and labor policy through [[lobbying]]. In 2005, the majority of Americans believed that big business has "too much power in Washington."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.cato.org/research/articles/cpr28n4-1.html

'''Bryges''' or '''Briges''' ({{lang-el|Βρύγοι or Βρίγες}}) is the historical name given to a people of the ancient Balkans. They are generally considered to have been related to the [[Phrygians]], who during classical antiquity lived in western [[Anatolia]]. Both names, ''Bryges'' and ''Phrygians'', are assumed to be variants of the same root. Based on archaeological evidence, some scholars such as [[Nicholas Hammond]] and [[Eugene N. Borza]] argue that the Bryges/Phrygians were members of the [[Lusatian culture]] that migrated into the southern [[Balkans]] during the [[Late Bronze Age]].&lt;ref&gt;Borza, Eugene N. ''In the Shadow of Olympus: the Emergence of Macedon''. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1990, {{ISBN|0-691-00880-9}}, p. 65. "What can be established, despite an extremely slight archaeological record (especially along the slopes of Mt. Vermion), is that two streams of Lusatian peoples moved south in the later Bronze Age, one to settle in Hellespontine Phrygia, the other to occupy parts of western and central Macedonia."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Gordion Excavations 1950-1973: Final Reports Volume 4, Rodney Stuart Young, Ellen L. Kohler, Gilbert Kenneth, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Map of ancient Epirus and environs (English).svg|left|thumb|200px|Ancient tribes in the area with shown Brygian settlements.]] 
The earliest mentions of the Bryges are contained in the historical writings of [[Herodotus]], who relates them to Phrygians, stating that according to the [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonians]], the Bryges "changed their name" to ''Phryges'' after migrating into [[History of Anatolia|Anatolia]],&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus. ''Histories'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Hdt.+7.73 7.73]. "The Phrygian equipment was very similar to the Paphlagonian, with only a small difference. As the Macedonians say, these Phrygians were called Briges as long as they dwelt in Europe, where they were neighbors of the Macedonians; but when they changed their home to Asia, they changed their name also and were called Phrygians. The Armenians, who are settlers from Phrygia, were armed like the Phrygians. Both these together had as their commander Artochmes, who had married a daughter of Darius."&lt;/ref&gt; a movement which is thought to have happened between 1200 BC and 800 BC&lt;ref&gt;Borza, Eugene N. ''In the Shadow of Olympus: the Emergence of Macedon''. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1990, {{ISBN|0-691-00880-9}}, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps due to the [[Bronze Age collapse]], particularly the fall of the [[Hittite Empire]] and the power vacuum that was created. In the Balkans, the Bryges occupied central [[Albania]] and northern [[Epirus]],&lt;ref name=IESE&gt;{{cite book | first= Iorwerth Eiddon Stephen | last= Edwards | title= The Cambridge Ancient History, Part 2, The Middle East and the Aegean Region c.1380-1000 BC | publisher= Cambridge University Press | location= Cambridge, United Kingdom | year= 1973 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=n1TmVvMwmo4C&amp;pg=RA1-PA709&amp;dq=Brygi++Albania&amp;sig=O6XA9tuWVjwbcO4WQfuSVnYAAY4#PRA1-PA709,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], mainly west of the [[Axios River|Axios]] river, but also [[Mygdonia]], which was conquered by the kingdom of [[Macedon]] in the early 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides. ''The Peloponnesian War'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200;query=chapter%3D%23245;layout=;loc=2.98.1 2.99].&lt;/ref&gt; They seem to have lived peacefully next to the inhabitants of Macedonia,&lt;ref&gt;Borza, Eugene N. ''In the Shadow of Olympus: the Emergence of Macedon''. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1990, {{ISBN|0-691-00880-9}}, p. 65. "There is no record of conflict between the Bryges and the local population; they are described as ''synoikoi'' ("fellow inhabitant" or neighbors) of the Macedonians."&lt;/ref&gt; however, [[Eugammon of Cyrene|Eugammon]] in his ''[[Telegony]]'', drawing upon earlier epic traditions, mentions that Odysseus commanded the [[Epirus|Epirotian]] [[Thesprotians]] against the Bryges.&lt;ref name=IESE/&gt; Small groups of Bryges, after the migration to Anatolia and the expansion of the kingdom of [[Macedon]], were still left in northern Pelagonia and around Epidamnus.

Herodotus also mentions that in 492 BC, some Thracian Brygoi or Brygians (Greek: Βρύγοι Θρήικες) fell upon the Persian camp by night, wounding [[Mardonius (general)|Mardonius]] himself, though he went on with the campaign until he subdued them.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus. ''Histories'', [http://www.parstimes.com/history/herodotus/persian_wars/erato.html 6.45]&lt;/ref&gt; These Brygoi were later mentioned in Plutarch's ''[[Parallel Lives]]'', in the [[Battle of Philippi]], as camp servants of [[Marcus Junius Brutus|Brutus]].&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch. ''The Parallel Lives'' ([http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Brutus*.html#note38 Brutus]).&lt;/ref&gt; However, modern scholars state that a historical link between them and the original Bryges cannot be established.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkes, J. J. ''The Illyrians''. Blackwell Publishing, 1992, {{ISBN|0-631-19807-5}}, p. 111. "The presence of Bryges at Epidamnus in the account of Appian seems to be confirmed by other sources, including the ''Coastal Voyage'' attributed to Scymnus of Chios and Stabo's ''Geography''. No later record of their presence in the area survives nor can any link be established with the Bryges of Thrace..."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Thessaloniki area in Antiquity.png|thumb|right|200px|Thessaloniki, location of ancient [[Mygdonia]], Macedonian home of the Bryges.]]

There is no certain derivation for the name and tribal origin of the Bryges. In 1844, Hermann Müller suggested the name might be related to the same Indo-European root as that of [[German language|German]] ''Berg'' (mountain) and [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] ''breg'' (hill, slope, mountain),&lt;ref&gt;Müller, Hermann. ''Das nordische Griechenthum und die urgeschichtliche Bedeutung des Nordwestlichen Europas'', p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. IE 
*''bʰerǵʰ''. It would then be cognate with Western European tribal names such as the Celtic [[Brigantes]] and the Germanic [[Burgundians]],&lt;ref&gt;Kluge, ''Etymologisches Wörterbuch'', Berlin: de Gruyter 1995, v. ''Berg''.&lt;/ref&gt; and semantically motivated by some aspect of the word meanings "high, elevated, noble, illustrious".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Julius|last=Pokorny|title=Indogermanisches Etymologisches Woerterbuch|publisher=University of Leiden|url=http://www.indoeuropean.nl/cgi-bin/startq.cgi?flags=endnnnl&amp;root=leiden&amp;basename=%5Cdata%5Cie%5Cpokorny|pages=140–141|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809064309/http://www.indoeuropean.nl/cgi-bin/startq.cgi?flags=endnnnl&amp;root=leiden&amp;basename=%5Cdata%5Cie%5Cpokorny|archivedate=2011-08-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5746">A '''cultural invention''' is any [[innovation]] developed by people that is not a [[Material culture|material object]].&lt;ref&gt;Saper, Craig J.,(January 1997), ''Artificial Mythologies: A Guide to Cultural Invention'' , University of Minnesota Press  {{ISBN|0-8166-2873-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural inventions include sets of [[behaviour]] adopted by [[Group dynamics|groups]] of [[people]]. They are perpetuated by being passed on to others within the group or outside it. They are also passed on to future groups and [[Generation|generations]].&lt;ref&gt;
Ostherr, Kirsten; Review of ''Artificial Mythologies. A Guide to Cultural Invention'', Fall 1998 http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3709/is_199810/ai_n8821092&lt;/ref&gt; Sources of cultural invention can either come from outside a specific group or from within that group.

[[Allan Hanson]], a [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] anthropologist, believed that the analytical purpose of studying cultural inventions was not to uncover which portions of a culture's belief systems are invented, but rather to study how cultural inventions become accepted as authentic within groups.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Allan 2012 [1989] The Making of the Maori: Culture Invention &amp; its Logic. In Anthropological Theory: An Introductory History. R. Jon McGee and Richard L. Warms, eds. Pp 549-562. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; This notion has been met with criticism from within the anthropological community as well as from outside sources, and has been referred to as both politically revisionist and anti-native.&lt;ref&gt;Jocelyn Linnekin.  American Anthropologist, New Series, Vol. 93, No. 2 (Jun., 1991), pp. 446-449&lt;/ref&gt; The fear is that viewing cultural invention as a process which leads to something authentic and widely accepted may undermine indigenous people's traditions in addition to questioning the authority they have over their own culture.&lt;ref&gt;Jocelyn Linnekin.  American Anthropologist, New Series, Vol. 93, No. 2 (Jun., 1991), pp. 446-449&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Examples of areas where cultural inventions may take place include:
* [[Language]]s
* [[Legal systems of the world|Legal systems]]
* [[Political system]]s
* [[Scientific method]]
* [[Sport]]s
* [[Institution|Social institutions]]
* [[Belief systems]]

[[File:Robley and mokomokai 2.jpg|thumb|Robley and mokomokai 2]]

==Cultural transmission==
One way that cultural inventions can be spread is through [[cultural transmission]].  Cultural transmission refers to the means by which culturally specific ideas and patterns of behavior are shared so that they become cultural reality.&lt;ref&gt;Cultural Sharing and Cultural Theory: Some Findings of a Five-Society Study.  Marc J. Swartz.  American Anthropologist , New Series, Vol. 84, No. 2 (Jun., 1982), pp. 314-338&lt;/ref&gt; According to Marc J. Swartz, people of status within society play an important role in deciding what is understood as cultural reality.&lt;ref&gt;Cultural Sharing and Cultural Theory: Some Findings of a Five-Society Study.  Marc J. Swartz.  American Anthropologist , New Series, Vol. 84, No. 2 (Jun., 1982), pp. 314-338&lt;/ref&gt; Such people have the correct kinds of skills and knowledge within society to help transmit ideas in such a way that they are accepted by society at large, and this is one method by which cultural inventions can become cultural realities.&lt;ref&gt;Cultural Sharing and Cultural Theory: Some Findings of a Five-Society Study.  Marc J. Swartz.  American Anthropologist , New Series, Vol. 84, No. 2 (Jun., 1982), pp. 314-338&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case study: the Maori of New Zealand==
Allan Hanson proposed that several aspects of [[Māori culture|Maori culture]] had been invented by European scholars who were accustomed to analytical frameworks focused on long-distance migration and diffusion.  Because of this, he believed that European scholars constructed the notion that a "[[Great Fleet]]" headed by a man named Kupe from a neighboring island was responsible for the initial discovery and peopling of New Zealand.  Although Maori ancestors most likely did arrive in canoes coming from nearby islands, Hanson believed that the account of the Great Fleet was created in order to simplify various Maori traditions into a single tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Allan 2012 [1989] The Making of the Maori: Culture Invention &amp; its Logic. In Anthropological Theory: An Introductory History. R. Jon McGee and Richard L. Warms, eds. Pp 549-562. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Additionally, in order to make the Maori seem more elevated in European eyes, scholars may have invented a cult to a god named Io. Io was thought to be a supreme being that controlled all the other gods in the Maori pantheon. The story of Io creating the world is very similar to that of the [[Book of Genesis]] in the Bible, so similar that it is believed to be of European invention.&lt;ref&gt;Hiroa, Te Rangi (Peter H. Buck). 1950. The Coming of the Maori. 2nd Edition.  Wellington: Whitecombe and Tombs.&lt;/ref&gt; Hanson asserted that these and other elements of Maori tradition were incorporated and taken to be true by the Maori, and that they have been passed down through generations by way of oral tradition. According to Hanson, "Io and the Great Fleet have been incorporated into Maori lore and are passed down from elders to juniors in storytelling, oratory, and other Maori contexts."&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Allan 2012 [1989] The Making of the Maori: Culture Invention &amp; its Logic. In Anthropological Theory: An Introductory History. R. Jon McGee and Richard L. Warms, eds. Pp 549-562. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dagaare''' is the maternal language of the [[Dagaaba people]] in [[Ghana]] and [[Burkina Faso]]. It has been described as a [[dialect continuum]] that also includes Waale and Birifor.

''Ethnologue'' divides Dagaare into three languages:
*Southern/Central Dagaare language, which is spoken mainly in Ghana
*Northern Dagara language, which is spoken mainly in Burkina Faso
*Dagaari Dioula, which is spoken mainly in Burkina Faso, and has significant influence from the genetically unrelated [[Dioula language]]

In its simplest form, a disease registry could consist of a collection of paper cards kept inside "a shoe box" by an individual physician. Most frequently registries vary in sophistication from  simple spreadsheets that only can be accessed by a small group of physicians to very complex databases that are accessed online across multiple institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acponline.org/clinical_information/journals_publications/acp_internist/sep05/patient.htm#help|title=ACP Observer, September 2005 - Patient registries: a key step to quality improvement&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They can provide health providers (or even patients) with reminders to check certain tests in order to reach certain quality goals.

Registries are less complex and simpler to set up than [[electronic medical record]]s that according to a recent survey are only used by 9% of small offices where almost half of the US doctors work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMsa0802005|title=Electronic Health Records in Ambulatory Care — A National Survey of Physicians|first1=Catherine M.|last1=DesRoches|first2=Eric G.|last2=Campbell|first3=Sowmya R.|last3=Rao|first4=Karen|last4=Donelan|first5=Timothy G.|last5=Ferris|first6=Ashish|last6=Jha|first7=Rainu|last7=Kaushal|first8=Douglas E.|last8=Levy|first9=Sara|last9=Rosenbaum|first10=Alexandra E.|last10=Shields|first11=David|last11=Blumenthal|date=3 July 2008|publisher=|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=359|issue=1|pages=50–60|via=Taylor and Francis+NEJM|doi=10.1056/NEJMsa0802005|pmid=18565855}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An electronic medical record keeps track of all the patients a doctor follows but a registry only keeps track of a small sub population of patients with a specific condition.

==Types of medical conditions tracked==
More than 130 million Americans live with chronic diseases and chronic diseases account for 70% of all deaths in the US. "The medical care costs of people with chronic diseases account for more than 75% of the nation's $2 trillion medical care costs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://cdc.gov/nccdphp/overview.htm|title= Chronic Diseases and Health Promotion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Registries target certain conditions because medical expenses are unevenly distributed: most health care expenses are spent treating patients with a few chronic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahrq.gov/research/ria19/expriach1.htm|title=The High Concentration of U.S. Health Care Expenditures: Research in Action, Issue 19, Chart 1&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|access-date=2008-06-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709085437/http://www.ahrq.gov/research/ria19/expriach1.htm|archive-date=2008-07-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the 2002 expenses with [[diabetes]] in the US was $132 billion, and this was around 12% of the US medical budget. Diabetes accounts for 25% of the Medicare budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dagc.org/diastatsUS.asp|title=DAGC.ORG - Diabetes Statistics - United States&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Given this, diabetes is one of the conditions targeted by registries. Diabetes is also amenable to this because there is a target population that can be defined according to certain rules and there is evidence that certain tests like retina exams, LDL levels, HgbA1c levels can correlate with quality of care in diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/26/suppl_1/s33|title=Standards of Medical Care for Patients With Diabetes Mellitus|first=American Diabetes|last=Association|date=1 January 2003|publisher=|journal=Diabetes Care|volume=26|issue=suppl 1|pages=s33–s50|via=care.diabetesjournals.org|doi=10.2337/diacare.26.2007.S33|pmid=12502618}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the diabetes impact, the New York City created a HbA1C Registry (NYCAR) to help health providers keep track of patients with diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/diabetes/diabetes-nycar.shtml The NYC Hemoglobin A1C Registry (NYCAR) : Diabetes Prevention and Control Program : NYC DOHMH&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609163243/http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/diabetes/diabetes-nycar.shtml |date=June 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of disease registry is the New York State CABG Registry that tracks all cardiac bypass surgery performed in the state of New York &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa040316|title=Long-Term Outcomes of Coronary-Artery Bypass Grafting versus Stent Implantation|first1=Edward L.|last1=Hannan|first2=Michael J.|last2=Racz|first3=Gary|last3=Walford|first4=Robert H.|last4=Jones|first5=Thomas J.|last5=Ryan|first6=Edward|last6=Bennett|first7=Alfred T.|last7=Culliford|first8=O. Wayne|last8=Isom|first9=Jeffrey P.|last9=Gold|first10=Eric A.|last10=Rose|date=26 May 2005|publisher=|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=352|issue=21|pages=2174–2183|via=Taylor and Francis+NEJM|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa040316|pmid=15917382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a survey of 1040 US physician organizations published in Journal of the American Medical Association,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content-nw/full/289/4/434/TABLEJOC21257T5|title=JAMA – The Latest Medical Research, Reviews, and Guidelines|website=jama.ama-assn.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; diabetes registries are used by 40.3%, asthma registries are used by 31.2% of physician organizations, CHF registries are used by 34.8% and depression registries are used by 15.7%.

Other tests like Pap smears are also useful to keep track in registries because there is evidence that when done annually in women of certain ages groups can detect and prevent cervical cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guideline.gov/summary/summary.aspx?doc_id=10713|title=Cervical cancer screening guideline: October 2006. - National Guideline Clearinghouse|website=www.guideline.gov|access-date=2008-06-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928114546/http://www.guideline.gov/summary/summary.aspx?doc_id=10713|archive-date=2008-09-28|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of measures tracked are based on [[evidence-based medicine]] and are defined and standardized  by national organizations like the [[NCQA]].

Patient registries are particularly useful for evaluating the safety of [[orphan drug]] products as well as the safety of drugs in specific populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=McNeil, JJ |author2=Piccenna, L |author3=Ronaldson, K |title= The value of patient-centred registries in phase IV drug surveillance |url=http://adisonline.com/pharmaceuticalmedicine/Fulltext/2010/24050/The_Value_of_Patient_Centred_Registries_in_Phase.2.aspx | journal=Pharm Med |volume=24 |issue=5 |pages=281–288|year=2010 |doi=10.1007/bf03256826|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical devices registries==

Countries like Australia, Britain, Norway, Sweden,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bcg.com/expertise_impact/publications/PublicationDetails.aspx?id=tcm:12-64828 |title=From Concept to Reality: Putting Value-Based Health Care into Practice in Sweden |first1=Stefan |last1=Larsson |first2= Peter |last2= Lawyer |first3= Martin B. |last3= Silverstein |date= November 2010 |accessdate=2011-07-06|publisher=Boston Consulting Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; and America&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = American Joint Replacement Registry - Improving orthopaedic care through data.|url = http://ajrr.net/|website = ajrr.net|access-date = 2016-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; have national a [[joint replacement registry]] that track patients with artificial joints.

"The use of joint registries has proven beneficial abroad. In Australia, regulators use such data to force manufacturers to justify why poorly performing hips or knees should remain available, and products have been withdrawn as a result. In Sweden several years ago, surgeons alerted by their national registry stopped using a badly flawed hip long before their American counterparts did. A few medical organizations in the USA, like Kaiser Permanente, operate their own registries to good effect and the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York has recently set up a registry.
Experts say that the United States wastes billions of dollars annually on medical treatments which may not work. But the financial and human consequences are also large when evidence exists but is not collected." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/29/business/29hip.html?ei=5087&amp;em=&amp;en=20c1a469134f79d6&amp;ex=1217476800&amp;pagewanted=all |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] | first=Barry | last=Meier | title=A call for a warning system on artificial joints | date=2008-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saudi Arabia will be a pioneer to come up with a comprehensive medical device registry(CIMDR), which will ultimately be a national database for most of the permanent implanted medical devices, which stays in the human body, it will be a National program covering all the hospitals doing implants(Cardio, Ortho, Craniofacial, Cosmetic , Spine &amp; Simulators and other implants), The comprehensive database will be a multi-user/multi-institutional and will covering most of the implanted devices. Saudi Food and Drug Authority would hold the flagship for this national initiative. This registry would be one of the its kind in the world holding the data for all the medical devices registries in a single repository and would be a great tool not only for post market surveillance but calculating and deriving clinical outcomes.

==Cost-effectiveness==

The cost-effectiveness of a disease registry is related with the cost-effectiveness of prevention of specific medical conditions. Increasing compliance through a registry with preventive measures like children vaccination or colonoscopy screening can actually be a cost-saving measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMp0708558|title=Does Preventive Care Save Money? Health Economics and the Presidential Candidates|date=14 February 2008|publisher=|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=358|issue=7|pages=661–663|doi=10.1056/NEJMp0708558|pmid=18272889}}&lt;/ref&gt; "A mammogram every 2 years for women aged 50–69 costs only about $9,000 per year of life saved. This cost compares favorably with other widely used clinical preventive services."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdc.gov/nccdphp/overview.htm|title=Chronic Disease - Overview&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pay-for-performance (P4P)==

Registries can be associated with pay-for-performance (P4P) quality based contracts for individual doctors, groups of doctors or even all doctors in a country. For example, the United Kingdom, rewards physicians according to 146 quality measures related with 10 chronic diseases that are tracked electronically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMsa055505|title=Pay-for-Performance Programs in Family Practices in the United Kingdom|first1=Tim|last1=Doran|first2=Catherine|last2=Fullwood|first3=Hugh|last3=Gravelle|first4=David|last4=Reeves|first5=Evangelos|last5=Kontopantelis|first6=Urara|last6=Hiroeh|first7=Martin|last7=Roland|date=27 July 2006|publisher=|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=355|issue=4|pages=375–384|via=Taylor and Francis+NEJM|doi=10.1056/NEJMsa055505|pmid=16870916}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, Medicare also started a 1.5% P4P contract based on health  measures that can be tracked by disease registries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cms.hhs.gov/pqri/|title=Overview|date=11 October 2017|website=www.cms.hhs.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical aspects of data tracking==

The quality of a disease registry is based on the quality of data fed into it and all the processes involved in updating it and keeping its integrity. In every registry there is always a risk of "[[garbage in, garbage out]]". Issues that can affect a registry and its acceptance by a physician group:

* Is the registry only updated centrally or can a physician update or correct it? For example, a physician doesn't want to get reminders from a registry regarding diabetes patients that died, moved to another state or left her/his practice.
* Most frequently, a list of patients with a certain condition (e.g. diabetes) is generated based on certain criteria. In the U.S., [[Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set]] (HEDIS) criteria are set annually by the [[National Committee for Quality Assurance]] (NCQA). These criteria, in order to avoid paper charts reviews are in most cases based on insurance claims. For example, for diabetes, HEDIS selects an eligible population based on '''Age''' (18–75 years), '''continuous enrollment''' with a certain health insurer and certain "'''Events/diagnosis'''" from '''Pharmacy data''' (electronic), Insurance '''Claims data''' (electronic) or from '''medical records'''. Pharmacy data is based on a list of medications prescribed for diabetes &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncqa.org/portals/0/hedisqm/HEDIS2008/Vol2/NDC/CDC+Denominator.xls|title=NCQA &gt; 404error|website=www.ncqa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncqa.org/portals/0/hedisqm/HEDIS2008/Vol2/NDC/Table+CDC-A.doc|title=NCQA &gt; 404error|website=www.ncqa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claims data is based on having '''two''' outpatient visits with a doctor or '''one''' inpatient hospital admission or '''one''' Emergency Room visit with the diagnosis of diabetes. Patients are excluded if they have [[polycystic ovaries]] or just [[gestational diabetes]]. Despite the strict criteria it is possible for physicians to have patients on their registries that are not truly diabetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0895435698001619|title=Redirecting|website=linkinghub.elsevier.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2916">An ''extracorporeal'' is a [[medical procedure]] which is performed outside the body.

==Circulatory procedures==
A procedure in which blood is taken from a patient's circulation to have a process applied to it before it is returned to the circulation. All of the apparatus carrying the blood outside the body is termed the '''extracorporeal circuit'''.
* [[Apheresis]]
* [[Autotransfusion]]
* [[Hemodialysis]]
* [[Hemofiltration]]
* [[Plasmapheresis]]
* [[Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal]]
* [[Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation]]
* [[Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation]] (ECMO)
* [[Cardiopulmonary bypass]] during open heart surgery.

==Other procedures==
[[Extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy]] (ESWL), which is unrelated to other extracorporeal therapies, in that the device used to break up the kidney stones is held completely outside the body, whilst the lithotripsy itself occurs inside the body.

Extracorporeal [[radiotherapy]], where a large bone with a tumour is removed and given a dose far exceeding what would otherwise be safe to give to a patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

'''Flannagan mac Ceallach''', [[Irish people|Irish]] [[poet]], fl. [[9th century in Ireland|879]].

Flannagan appears to be known almost exclusively from three verses of a poem he composed upon the death of King [[Áed Findliath]] in 879. It is preserved in that year's entry in the [[Annals of the Four Masters]]:

* ''Long is the wintry night/with rough gusts of wind/Under pressing grief we encounter it/since the red-speared king of the noble house liveth not.''
* ''It is awful to watch how/the waves heave from the bottom;/To them may be compared all/those who with us lament him.''
* ''A generous, wise, staid man,/of whose renown wide-ruling Teamhair was full/A shielded oak that sheltered/the palace of Milidh's sons.''
* ''Master of the games of the fair-hilled Tailtin/King of Teamhair of an hundred conflicts/Chief of Fodhla the noble/Aedh of Oileach who died too soon.''
* ''Mournful, not forgotten,/the departure from this world;/Stony, not merciful/is the heart of the son of man;''
* ''No greater than small flies/are the kings of Adam's race with him/A yew without any charge of blemish upon him/was he of the long flowing hair.''

He may, or may not, be identical with a namsake King of [[Kings of Brega|Brega]] who was killed at the battle of Oldba in 895.

In [[manufacturing]] and [[mechanical engineering]], '''flatness''' is an important geometric condition for workpieces and tools.

In the manufacture of precision parts and assemblies, especially where parts will be required to be connected across a surface area in an air-tight or liquid-tight manner, flatness is a critical quality of the manufactured surfaces. Such surfaces are usually [[machined]] or [[Grinding operations|ground]] to achieve the required degree of flatness. [[High-definition metrology]], such as digital holographic interferometry, of such a surface to confirm and ensure that the required degree of flatness has been achieved is a key step in such manufacturing processes. Flatness may be defined in terms of least squares fit to a plane ("statistical flatness"), worst-case or overall flatness (the distance between the two closest parallel planes within).

Two parts that are flat to about 1&amp;nbsp;[[helium light band]] (HLB) can be "wrung" together, which means they will cling to each other when placed in contact. This phenomenon is commonly used with [[gage blocks]].

[[Geometric dimensioning and tolerancing]] has provided geometrically defined, quantitative ways of [[operational definition|defining flatness operationally]]. 

==History==
[[Joseph Whitworth]] popularized the first practical method of making accurate flat surfaces during the 1830s, using [[engineer's blue]] and [[hand scraper|scraping]] techniques on three trial surfaces. By testing all three in pairs against each other, it is ensured that the surfaces become flat. Using two surfaces would result in a concave surface and a convex surface. Eventually a point is reached when many points of contact are visible within each square inch, at which time the three surfaces are uniformly flat to a very close tolerance.[http://journals.iranscience.net:800/www.newscientist.com/www.newscientist.com/lastword/article.jsp@id=lw801]

Up until his introduction of the scraping technique, the same three plate method was employed using polishing techniques, giving less accurate results. This led to an explosion of development of precision [[measuring instrument|instrument]]s using these flat surface generation techniques as a basis for further construction of precise shapes.

'''Francesco Antonio Santori''' ([[Arbëresh language|Arbërisht]]: '''Françesk Anton Santori''' or '''Ndon Santori'''; September 16, 1819 &amp;ndash; September 7, 1894) was an Italian writer, poet and playwright of [[Arbëreshë people|Arbëreshë]] descent. His [[play (theatre)|play]] ''Emira'' is considered to be the first original Albanian drama ever written.&lt;ref name="elsie"&gt;{{cite book|author= Robert Elsie (Centre for Albanian Studies)|title=Albanian literature: a short history|publisher=I.B.Tauris|year=2005|pages=54–5|isbn=1-84511-031-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=ox3Wx1Nl_2MC&amp;q=santori#v=snippet&amp;q=santori&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mann"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mann|first=Stuart|title=Albanian literature: an outline of prose, poetry, and drama|publisher=B.

== Life ==
Santori was born on September 16, 1819 in [[Santa Caterina Albanese]], an [[Arbëreshë people|Arbëreshë]] town in the [[province of Cosenza]], modern southern Italy.&lt;ref name="mann"/&gt; In 1835 at the age of sixteen he decided to become a priest and started his training for priesthood. In 1843 he entered the [[Franciscan]] monastery of the Reformed Order in [[San Marco Argentano]]. In 1858 he unsuccessfully tried to found a monastery in [[Lattarico]], and in 1860 he abandoned monastic life.&lt;ref name="elsie"/&gt;

He continued living in Santa Caterina Albanese, where he worked as a teacher and a vendor of a [[spinning jenny]] he had constructed. In 1885 he was assigned as priest in [[San Giacomo di Cerzeto]], a village of [[Cerzeto]] where he worked until his death on September 7, 1894.&lt;ref name="elsie"/&gt;

== Work ==
During his life Santori wrote poetry, novels, plays and short stories. He also adapted 112 of [[Aesop's Fables]] and wrote an [[Albanian language|Albanian]] grammar book.&lt;ref name="elsie"/&gt; Santori wrote and finished his first poetry, titled ''Canzoniere Albanese'' ({{lang-en|Albanian Songbook}}) in the 1830s and published it in 1846. ''Canzoniere Albanese'' is a long [[lyric poem]] dedicated to love and nature. The poem was influenced by [[Girolamo de Rada]]'s ''Song of Milosao''.&lt;ref name="elsie"/&gt; In 1848 he composed a hymn in Albanian titled ''Valle haresë madhe'' ({{lang-en|Dance of great joy}}), published on February 23, 1848 in De Rada's journal ''L'Albanese d'Italia'' ({{lang-en|The Albanian of Italy}}).

In 1848 his bilingual political poem ''Il prigionero politico'' ({{lang-en|The political prisoner}}) written in Albanian and Italian was published in [[Naples]]. The poem recounts the changes of the life of a persecuted family during the [[revolutions of 1848 in the Italian states]].&lt;ref name="elsie"/&gt; During his years in the monastery of the Reformed Order in Cerzeto he wrote two religious works. The first work is a religious verse titled ''Rozhaari i S. Myriis Virgkiyry'' ({{lang-en|Rosary of Virgin Mary}}, written in Albanian and published in 1849 in [[Cosenza]]. The second one is a 230-page collection of prayers, religious texts and translations of religious songs titled ''Kryshten i shyityruory'' ({{lang-en|The Sanctified Christian}}) published in 1855 in Naples. ''The Sanctified Christian'' contains parts of [[Cuneus Prophetarum]] published in 1685 and written by [[Pjetër Bogdani]], one of the most important writers of early Albanian literature. Santori included excerpts of ''Cuneus Prophetarum'' in his book to symbolize the continuity of Albanian religious literature.&lt;ref name="elsie"/&gt;

Santori wrote many plays, including [[melodramatic]] comedies and tragedies some of which remain incomplete.&lt;ref name="cornispope"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cornis-Pope|first=Marcel|author2=John Neubauer|title=History of the literary cultures of East-Central Europe: junctures and disjunctures in the 19th and 20th centuries|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=2004|series=History of the Literary Cultures of East-central Europe|volume=2|pages=285|isbn=90-272-3453-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5pAwqsSyTlsC&amp;pg=PA285&amp;lpg=PA285&amp;dq=anton+santori+melodramatic&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3UtScv7EqO&amp;sig=bAejgt-c_a9Gi4KFHPxmXnNZ0eQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=uMPeS5LMIaOhONmslJcH&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=melodramatic&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; His plays include ''Jeroboam'', a tragedy of biblical content and ''Alessio Dukagino'' a melodrama written between 1855 and 1860, recounting the life of [[Lekë Dukagjini]], an [[Albanians|Albanian]] prince who fought against the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref name="elsie"/&gt; His best-known play, ''Emira'', titled after the name of its central figure, is considered to be the first original Albanian drama ever written.&lt;ref name="elsie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cornispope"/&gt; The drama recounts the adventures of Emira, Kalina, Albenci, and Mirjani during a social revolt in [[Calabria]], and the life in the Arbëreshë communities.&lt;ref name="colorado"&gt;{{cite book|author=University of Colorado (various)|title=East European quarterly|publisher=[[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]]|year=1981|series=East European quarterly|volume=15|pages=478|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R_AXAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Anton+Santori&amp;dq=Anton+Santori&amp;ei=fRjfS6TeLYWOzAS28oHECQ&amp;hl=en&amp;cd=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some parts of the play were published originally in the journal ''Fjamuri Arbërit'' ({{lang-en|The Albanian Flag}}) and later in Jeronim de Rada's ''Albanian Anthology''.&lt;ref name="elsie"/&gt; In modern years, 1,845 lines of [[satirical]] verse written by Santori have been found.

Most of Santori's novels and short stories were published after his death in 1894.&lt;ref name="elsie"/&gt; His novels include ''Sofia Kominiate'', an unfinished novel written in two versions. The first version contains 282 pages and is written in Albanian, while the second version, written in Italian, contains 714 pages. No copies have survived from his novel ''Bija e mallkuar'' ({{lang-en|The Cursed Daughter}}) written in Albanian. He also wrote the novel ''Il soldato albanese'' ({{lang-en|The Albanian soldier}}) in Italian.&lt;ref name="elsie"/&gt; Santori wrote many short stories known by the names of their central figures. His short stories written in Albanian include: ''Brisandi Lletixja e Ulladheni, Emilja, Fëmija Pushtjerote, Filaredo, Gnidhja e Kusari, Kolluqi e Sorofina, Miloshini, Neomenia, Panaini e Dellja, Rosarja'', and ''Virgjinia''.&lt;ref name="elsie"/&gt;

== Influences and style ==
Santori's works are written in an archaic form of [[Tosk Albanian]] and are generally more accessible to the audience despite of his orthographic style.&lt;ref name="elsie"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Obeng|first=Samuel Gyasi|title=Political independence with linguistic servitude: the politics about languages in the developing world|publisher=Nova Publishers|year=2002|pages=202|isbn=1-59033-442-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ynndlzrBQsAC&amp;pg=PA202&amp;dq=Anton+Santori&amp;ei=fRjfS6TeLYWOzAS28oHECQ&amp;hl=en&amp;cd=6#v=onepage&amp;q=Anton%20Santori&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his works he uses his own spelling system without any phonetic accuracy.&lt;ref name="mann"/&gt; Common themes in Santori's works include rural life, the period of the [[League of Lezhë]] of [[History of Albania|Albanian history]] and the customs of Arbëreshë communities.&lt;ref name="elsie"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berend|first=Tibor|title=History derailed: Central and Eastern Europe in the long nineteenth century|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=2003|pages=71|isbn=0-520-23299-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tlKbYdjLZ0wC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=Anton+Santori&amp;ei=fRjfS6TeLYWOzAS28oHECQ&amp;hl=en&amp;cd=7#v=onepage&amp;q=Anton%20Santori&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; His political poems contain [[moralistic]] motifs describing the central ideas and feelings of the characters of each poem.&lt;ref name="qosja"&gt;{{cite book|last=Qosja|first=Rexhep|title=Historia e letërsisë shqipe: romantizmi|publisher=Toena|year=1984|series=Historia e letërsisë shqipe: romantizmi|volume=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=binfS7ykJ4rqywT5gfXmCQ&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;id=obMNAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=e+tyre+artistike+permes+patosit&amp;q=+patosit#search_anchor|language=Albanian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In several of his poems like ''Dance of great joy'' Santori describes fokloric elements of Albanian culture like folk songs and dances.&lt;ref name="qosja"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11341">In [[mathematics]], the '''Gan–Gross–Prasad conjecture''' is a [[restricted representation|restriction]] problem in the [[representation of a Lie group|representation theory of real or p-adic Lie groups]] posed by [[Wee Teck Gan]], [[Benedict Gross]], and [[Dipendra Prasad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Gan | first1=Wee Teck | last2=Gross | first2=Benedict H. | last3=Prasad | first3=Dipendra | title=Symplectic local root numbers, central critical L-values, and restriction problems in the representation theory of classical groups | mr=3202556 | year=2012 | journal=[[Astérisque]] | isbn=978-2-85629-348-5 | volume=346 | pages=1–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem originated from a conjecture of Gross and Prasad for [[orthogonal group|special orthogonal groups]] but was later generalized to include all four [[classical groups]].

and the conjecture describes when the multiplicity is precisely one.
==Motivation==
A motivating example is the following classical branching problem in the theory of [[Compact group#Compact Lie groups|compact Lie groups]]. Let &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; be an [[irreducible representation|irreducible]] finite dimensional representation of the compact [[unitary group]] &lt;math&gt;U(n)&lt;/math&gt;, and consider its restriction to the naturally embedded subgroup &lt;math&gt;U(n-1)&lt;/math&gt;. It is known that this restriction is multiplicity-free, but one may ask precisely which irreducible representations of &lt;math&gt;U(n-1)&lt;/math&gt; occur in the restriction.

By the [[Theorem of the highest weight|Cartan–Weyl theory of highest weights]], there is a classification of the irreducible representations of &lt;math&gt;U(n)&lt;/math&gt; via their [[Weight (representation_theory)#Highest weight|highest weights]] which are in natural bijection with sequences of integers &lt;math&gt;\underline{a} = (a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \cdots \leq a_n)&lt;/math&gt;.
Now suppose that &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; has highest weight &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;. Then an irreducible representation &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;U(n-1)&lt;/math&gt; with highest weight &lt;math&gt;\underline{b}&lt;/math&gt; occurs in the restriction of &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;U(n-1)&lt;/math&gt; (viewed as a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;U(n)&lt;/math&gt;) if and only if &lt;math&gt;\underline{a}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are interlacing, i.e. &lt;math&gt;a_1 \leq b_1 \leq a_2 \leq b_2 \leq \cdots \leq b_{n-1} \leq a_n&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Hermann|last=Weyl|authorlink=Hermann Weyl|title=The classical groups|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1946}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gan–Gross–Prasad conjecture then considers the analogous restriction problem for other classical groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Gan | first=Wee Teck | title=Recent progress on the Gross-Prasad conjecture | year=2014 | journal=Acta Mathematica Vietnamica | doi=10.1007/s40306-014-0047-2 | issn=2315-4144 | volume=39 | issue=1 | pages=11–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statement==
The conjecture has slightly different forms for the different classical groups. The formulation for general [[unitary group]]s is as follows.

===Setup===
Let &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; be a finite-dimensional vector space over a field &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; not of [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt; equipped with a non-degenerate [[sesquilinear form]] that is &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;-symmetric (i.e. &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon = 1&lt;/math&gt; if the form is [[Symmetric bilinear form|symmetric]] and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon = -1&lt;/math&gt; if the form is skew-symmetric. Let &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; be a non-degenerate subspace of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;V = W \oplus W^\perp&lt;/math&gt; of dimension &lt;math&gt;(\varepsilon + 1)/2&lt;/math&gt;. Then let &lt;math&gt;G = G(V) \times G(W)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;G(V)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Unitary group#Indefinite forms|unitary group preserving the form on &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;]], and let &lt;math&gt;H = \Delta G(W)&lt;/math&gt; be the [[diagonal subgroup]] of &lt;math&gt;G(W)&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;\pi = \pi_1 \boxtimes \pi_2&lt;/math&gt; be an irreducible smooth representation of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; be either the [[trivial representation]] (the "Bessel case") or the [[Metaplectic group|Weil representation]] (the "Fourier–Jacobi case").
Let &lt;math&gt;\varphi = \varphi_1 \times \varphi_2&lt;/math&gt; be a generic [[Local Langlands conjectures#Local Langlands conjectures for other groups|L-parameter]] for &lt;math&gt;G = G(V) \times G(W)&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;\Pi_\varphi&lt;/math&gt; be the associated Vogan L-packet.

===Local Gan–Gross–Prasad conjecture===
If &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is a local L-parameter for &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, then
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{\text{relevant } \pi \in \Pi_\varphi} \dim \operatorname{Hom}_H (\pi \otimes \overline{\nu}, \mathbb{C}) = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

Letting &lt;math&gt;\eta_{\mathrm{GP}}&lt;/math&gt; be the "distinguished character" defined in terms of the [[Langlands–Deligne local constant]], then furthermore
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Hom}_H (\pi(\varphi, \eta) \otimes \overline{\nu}, \mathbb{C}) \neq 0 \text{ if and only if } \eta = \eta_{\mathrm{GP}}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Global Gan–Gross–Prasad conjecture===
For a quadratic field extension &lt;math&gt;E/F&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;L_E(s, \pi_1 \times \pi_2) := L_E(s, \pi_1 \boxtimes \pi_2, \mathrm{std}_n \boxtimes \mathrm{std}_{n-1})&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;L_E&lt;/math&gt; is the global L-function obtained as the product of local L-factors given by the [[local Langlands conjectures]].
The following are equivalent:
# The period interval &lt;math&gt;P_H&lt;/math&gt; is nonzero when restricted to &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;.
# For all places &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, the local Hom space &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Hom}_{H(F_v)}(\pi_v, \nu_v) \neq 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L_E(1/2, \pi_1 \times \pi_2) \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;.

==Current status==
===Local Gan–Gross–Prasad conjecture===
In a series of four papers between 2010 and 2012, [[Jean-Loup Waldspurger]] proved the local Gan–Gross–Prasad conjecture for [[tempered representation]]s of orthogonal groups over [[p-adic number|p-adic fields]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Waldspurger | first=Jean-Loup | title=Une Formule intégrale reliée à la conjecture locale de Gross-Prasad. | year=2012 | journal=[[Compositio Mathematica]]| volume=146 | pages=1180–1290}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Waldspurger | first=Jean-Loup | title=Une Formule intégrale reliée à la conjecture locale de Gross-Prasad, 2ème partie: extension aux représentations tempérées. | year=2012 | journal=Astérisque | volume=347 | pages=171-311}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Waldspurger | first=Jean-Loup | title=La conjecture locale de Gross-Prasad pour les représentations tempérées des groupes spéciaux orthogonaux. | year=2012 | journal=Astérisque | volume=347 | pages=103–166}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Waldspurger | first=Jean-Loup | title=Calcul d'une valeur d'un facteur epsilon par une formule intégrale. | year=2012 | journal=Astérisque | volume=347}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, [[Colette Moeglin]] and Waldspurger then proved the local Gan–Gross–Prasad conjecture for generic non-tempered representations of orthogonal groups over p-adic fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Moeglin | first1=Colette | last2=Waldspurger | first2=Jean-Loup | title=La conjecture locale de Gross-Prasad pour les groupes spéciaux orthogonaux: le cas général | year=2012 | journal=Astérisque | volume=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2013 thesis, Raphaël Beuzart-Plessis proved the local Gan–Gross–Prasad conjecture for the tempered representations of unitary groups in the p-adic Hermitian case under the same hypotheses needed to establish the [[local Langlands conjecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Beuzart-Plessis| first=Raphaël | title=La conjecture locale de Gross-Prasad pour les représentations tempérées des groupes unitaires | year=2012 | journal=PhD thesis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a series of papers between 2004 and 2009, David Ginzburg, Dihua Jiang, and [[Stephen Rallis]] showed the (1) implies (2) direction of the global Gan–Gross–Prasad conjecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Ginzburg | first1=David | last2=Jiang | first2=Dihua | last3=Rallis | first3=Stephen | title=On the nonvanishing of the central value of the Rankin–Selberg L-functions. | year=2004 | journal=[[Journal of the American Mathematical Society]] | volume=17 | issue=3 | pages=679-722}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Ginzburg | first1=David | last2=Jiang | first2=Dihua | last3=Rallis | first3=Stephen | title=On the nonvanishing of the central value of the Rankin–Selberg L-functions, II. | year=2005 | journal=Automorphic Representations, L-functions and Applications: Progress and Prospects | publisher=Ohio State Univ.

In the Bessel case of the global Gan–Gross–Prasad conjecture, [[Wei Zhang (mathematician) | Wei Zhang]] used the theory of the [[Arthur–Selberg trace formula|relative trace formula]] by [[Hervé Jacquet]] and the work on the fundamental lemma by [[Zhiwei Yun]] to prove that the conjecture is true subject to certain local conditions in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Zhang | first=Wei | title=Fourier transform and the global Gan–Gross–Prasad conjecture for unitary groups. | year=2014 | journal=Annals of Mathematics | mr=2874638 | volume=180 | issue=3 | pages=971–1049}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Fourier–Jacobi case of the global Gan–Gross–Prasad conjecture, Yifeng Liu and Hang Xue showed that the conjecture holds in the skew-Hermitian case subject to certain local conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Liu | first=Yifeng | title=Relative trace formulae toward Bessel and Fourier–Jacobi periods of unitary groups. | year=2014 | journal=Manuscripta Mathematica | volume=145 | issue=1-2 | pages=1–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Xue | first=Hang| title=The Gan–Gross–Prasad conjecture for U(n) × U(n). | year=2014 | journal=[[Advances in Mathematics]] | volume=262 | pages=1130–1191 | doi=10.1016/j.aim.2014.06.010 | mr=3228451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ifè''' (or '''Ifɛ''') is a [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger–Congo]] language spoken by some 180,000 people in [[Togo]] and [[Benin]]. It is also known as '''Ana''', '''Ana-Ifé''', '''Anago''', '''Baate''' and '''Ede Ife'''. It has a [[lexical similarity]] of 87%–91% with [[Ede Nago language|Ede Nago]].&lt;ref name=e18/&gt;

Written works began to be produced in the language in the 1980s, published by the Comité Provisoire de Langue Ifɛ̀ and [[SIL International|SIL]]. An Ifè–French dictionary (''Oŋù-afɔ ŋa nfɛ̀ òŋu òkpi-ŋà ŋa nfãrãsé''), edited by Mary Gardner and Elizabeth Graveling, was produced in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_work.asp?id=42234 SIL Bibliography] on [[Ethnologue]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Juba Arabic''' ({{lang-ar|عربية جوبا}}), also known since 2011 as '''South Sudanese Arabic''', is a [[lingua franca]] spoken mainly in [[Equatoria|Equatoria Province]] in [[South Sudan]], and derives its name from the town of [[Juba, South Sudan]]. It is also spoken among communities of people from [[South Sudan]] living in towns in [[Sudan]]. The [[pidgin]] developed in the 19th century, among descendants of Sudanese soldiers, many of whom were recruited from southern Sudan. Residents of other large towns in [[South Sudan]], notably [[Malakal]] and [[Wau, Sudan|Wau]], do not generally speak Juba Arabic, tending towards the use of Arabic closer to [[Sudanese Arabic]], in addition to local languages.

==Classification==
Juba derives from a [[pidgin]] based on [[Sudanese Arabic]]. It has a vastly simplified grammar as well as the influence of local languages from the south of the country. DeCamp, writing in the mid-1970s, classifies Juba Arabic as a pidgin rather than a [[creole language]] (meaning that it is not passed on by parents to their children as a first language), though Mahmud, writing slightly later, appears to equivocate on this issue (see references below). Mahmoud's work is politically significant as it represented the first recognition by a northern Sudanese intellectual that Juba Arabic was not merely "Arabic spoken badly" but is a distinct dialect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Abdel Salam &amp; De Waal|2004|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the civil war in southern Sudan from 1983, more recent research on this issue has been restricted. However, the growth in the size of Juba town since the beginning of the civil war, its relative isolation from much of its hinterland during this time, together with the relative collapse of state run education systems in the government held garrison town (that would have further encouraged the use of Arabic as opposed to Juba Arabic), may have changed patterns of usage and transmission of Juba Arabic since the time of the last available research. Further research is required to determine the extent to which Juba Arabic may now be considered a creole rather than a pidgin language. The newly independent government of [[South Sudan]] has selected [[English language|English]] as the new official language of government in [[South Sudan]] in preference to [[Arabic]] and local languages such as Juba Arabic, [[Dinka]], [[Nuer language|Nuer]], [[Shilluk people|Shilluk]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Kevlihan|2007|p=?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Landsforrådt as an adverb in the Norwegian language:''''' 

"Landsforrådt" is a relatively new term in the [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] language. It means "to be betrayed by your [[country of origin]]." Examples of "landsforrådt" are: 
* A person who is denied their [[Natural_and_legal_rights|legal rights]] by their [[Government|government]].
* A person whose existence is not [[Acknowledgment_(law)|acknowledged]] by their [[Country_of_origin|country of origin]].
* A person who is denied entry to or in [[exile]] from their country of origin without proper [[Justification_and_excuse|justification]] and/or notification.
* A person who is deprived by their government, of their identity (and or merits). A person whose property, rights or own [[Physical_body|physical body]] is not protected by the [[Law|law]] of the land, when exposed to danger or injustice.

One or more of these criteria qualifies as a violation of the United Nations [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].

=== The Maria Eriksson series ===
{{Main|Gömda}}
''Gömda'' (''Buried Alive'') is the 1995 literary debut of Swedish author Liza Marklund. It is the first novel in the Maria Eriksson series. The novel is based on a true story and deals with a woman who is abused by her boyfriend and forced into hiding.

=== The Annika Bengtzon series ===
{{Main|Annika Bengtzon}}
The Annika Bengtzon series consists of eleven books. The framework of the Annika Bengtzon series is crime reporter Annika's hectic life, at a bustling tabloid called ''Kvällspressen'' in Stockholm, Sweden.

Marklund placed 22nd on the list of the most influential media personality of 2008 in Sweden, a list established yearly by the  trade magazine for the advertising industry, ''Resumé''.&lt;ref&gt;Öhman, Adam.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2292">A '''morphological pattern''' is a set of associations and/or operations that build the various forms of a [[lexeme]], possibly by [[inflection]], [[agglutination]], [[Compound (linguistics)|compounding]] or [[derivation (linguistics)|derivation]].

==Context==
The term is used in the domain of lexicons and morphology.

==Note==
It is important to distinguish the paradigm of a lexeme from a morphological pattern. In the context of an [[inflecting language]], an inflectional morphological pattern is not the explicit list of inflected forms. A morphological pattern usually references a prototypical class of inflectional forms, e.g. ''ring'' as per ''sing''. In contrast, the paradigm of a lexeme is the explicit list of the inflected forms of the given lexeme (e.g. ''to ring'', ''rang'', ''rung''). Said in other terms, this is the difference between a description in [[intension]] (a morphological pattern) and a description in [[extension (semantics)|extension]] (a paradigm).

[[File:Otfridvonhanstein wsq.jpg|thumb|Otfrid von Hanstein, as pictured in ''Wonder Stories Quarterly'', 1930]]
'''Otfrid von Hanstein''' (1869–1959) was a [[Germany|German]] actor and writer. As a novelist, he was prolific in various genres; his best-known works in English-language translation are [[science fiction]] novels published in various magazines by [[Hugo Gernsback]]. [[John Clute]] describes von Hanstein's science fiction as "technophilic and space-oriented, crude but competent".&lt;ref name=clute&gt;[http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/hanstein_otfrid_von#sthash.PrOXPvu2.dpuf Hanstein, Otfrid von], ''[[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]]''&lt;/ref&gt; [[E. F. Bleiler]] reports that his SF novels were suppressed by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi government]].&lt;ref name=EFB&gt;''Science-Fiction: The Gernsback Years'', [[Kent State University Press]], 1998, pp. 170-72&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translated works==

*''The Hidden Colony'' (1924 as ''Die Farm des Verschollenen'', ''[[Wonder Stories]]'', January–March 1935, tr. [[Fletcher Pratt]]). Clute classifies the novel as [[Utopian]];&lt;ref name=clute/&gt; [[E. F. Bleiler]] noted von Hanstein's focus on "technology as a way of improving efficiency and life" and wrote that "The frame situation is somewhat confusing, and the characterizations are weak, but the technology is at times fascinating. Like Hanstein's other stories, stodgy, but readable".&lt;ref name=EFB2&gt;''Science-Fiction: The Early Years'', [[Kent State University Press]], 1990, pp. 340-43&lt;/ref&gt; He also commented that "a closer reading reveals considerable ambivalence in Hanstein's vision.&lt;ref name=EFB/&gt;
*''Utopia Island'' (1927 as ''Ein Flug um die Welt und die Insel der seltsam Dinge'', ''Wonder Stories'', May–June 1931, tr. Francis M. Currier). Clute characterizes the novel as "another ambivalently-described Utopia";&lt;ref name=clute/&gt; Bleiler writes that "The author is obviously fascinated by his technology, which he describes well. The plot line, as might be seen from the conspiracy, is on the naive side. Hanstein displays a little nationalism, but his science of peace is international".&lt;ref name=EFB2/&gt; He also notes that the identification of the German-language original has been questioned, but that no plausible alternative has been identified.&lt;ref name=EFB/&gt;
*''Electropolis'' (1928, ''[[Wonder Stories Quarterly]]'', Summer 1930, tr. Francis M. Currier). Clute classifies the novel as Utopian;&lt;ref name=clute/&gt; Bleiler described it as "competent work, but with no special appeal. Even so, certainly superior to most of the other longer works in pulp science-fiction of the day".&lt;ref name=EFB/&gt; He also noted that ''Electropolis'' was "Negligible as fiction, but interesting for its extreme faith in technology and technocracy."&lt;ref name=EFB2 /&gt;
[[File:WSQFALL1930.jpg|thumb|[[Frank R. Paul]]'s cover illustration for ''Between Earth And Moon'']]
*''Between Earth And Moon'' (1929 as ''Mond-Rak 1. Eine Fahrt ins Weltall'', ''[[Wonder Stories Quarterly]]'', Fall 1930, tr. Francis M. Currier). Bleiler compares this near-future novel of the early stages of space exploration unfavorably to the similar work of [[Otto Willi Gail]], saying "The development is fairly realistic, based on German rocket research of the time, but not as valid as Gail's comparable work". He finds the novel "On the dull side, although in context, back in 1928, it was probably more exciting".&lt;ref name=EFB/&gt; ''[[Amazing Stories]]'' reviewer C. A. Brandt wrote that "The book is convincingly written, the illustrations [in the German first edition] are good, and the lover of scientific fiction will find a veritable mine of proven and possible inventions, which will stimulate the imagination and provide good entertainment."&lt;ref&gt;"In the Realm of Books", November 1929, p. 756&lt;/ref&gt;
*''In the Year 8000'' (1932, no published German-language original, ''Wonder Stories'', July–September 1932, tr. [[Laurence Manning]] &amp; Konrad Schmidt). Gernsback claimed that ''In the Year 8000'' "was written exclusively for ''Wonder Stories''", in response to American readers' enthusiasm for ''Utopia Island''.&lt;ref&gt;Editorial note to Part 1, ''Wonder Stories'', July 1932, p.7&lt;/ref&gt; Clute classified the story as [[dystopian]]. Bleiler found it "Much less pleasant than the other Hanstein stories, with some elements of early racism", as well as derivative of [[Thea von Harbou]]'s ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)#Pre-production|Metropolis]]''.&lt;ref name=EFB/&gt; He places the novel in the "sentimental stages of [[German Expressionism]]", and comments that "By now Hanstein has moved away from unrestrained enthusiasm for technology, and is working toward humane controls. As in Hanstein's other work, the background detail is more important than the plot or characterizations, which are cliched."&lt;ref name=EFB2/&gt;

The '''Paleo-Balkan languages''' are the various extinct [[Indo-European languages]] that were spoken in the [[Balkans]] in [[ancient times]]. [[Hellenization]], [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanization]] and [[Slavicization]] in the region caused their only modern descendants to be [[Greek language|Modern Greek]] and [[Albanian language|Albanian]], which are descended from [[Ancient Greek]] and one of the [[Thraco-Illyrian]] languages, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/general/ie-lg/Albanian.html|title=Indo-European Languages: Balkan Group: Albanian|last=Simmons|first=Austin|author2=Jonathan Slocum|publisher=Linguistics Research Center of the University of Texas at Austin|accessdate=8 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916055123/http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/general/ie-lg/Albanian.html|archivedate=16 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Languages ==
Ancient Greek and Roman writers report that the following languages were spoken on the Balkan Peninsula, besides Greek:{{cn|date=September 2017}}

Tomic, Balkan Sprachbund Morpho-Syntactic Features, Volume 67, Springer, 2006, {{ISBN|1402044887}}, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Dacian language|Dacian]]
*[[Illyrian languages]]
*[[Liburnian language|Liburnian]]
*[[Messapian language|Messapic]]
*[[Mysian language|Mysian]]
*[[Paeonian language|Paeonian]]
*[[Phrygian language|Phrygian]]
*[[Thracian language|Thracian]]

Although these languages are all members of the [[Indo-European language family]], the relationships between them are unknown. Classification of the languages spoken in the region is severely hampered because they are all scantily attested. Furthermore, many of the individuals who have published studies on these languages have had [[jingoism|strong patriotic or nationalistic interests]], which may [[confirmation bias|compromise]] the scholarly value of their work.

== Subgrouping hypotheses ==
Illyrian is a group of reputedly Indo-European languages whose relationship to other Indo-European languages as well as to the languages of the Paleo-Balkan group, many of which might be offshoots of Illyrian, is poorly understood due to the paucity of data and is still being examined. The Illyrian languages are often considered to be [[centum]] dialects,{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} but this is not confirmed as there are hints of [[satemization]]. Today, the main source of authoritative information about the Illyrian language consists of a handful of Illyrian words cited in classical sources, and numerous examples of Illyrian [[anthroponyms]], [[ethnonyms]], [[toponyms]] and [[hydronyms]].

A grouping of Illyrian with [[Messapian language|Messapian]] has been proposed for about a century, but remains an unproven hypothesis. The theory is based on classical sources, [[archaeology]], as well as [[onomastic]] considerations. Messapian material culture bears a number of similarities to Illyrian material culture. Some Messapian anthroponyms have close Illyrian equivalents.

A grouping of Illyrian with [[Venetic language|Venetic]] and [[Liburnian language|Liburnian]], once spoken in northeastern [[Italy]] and [[Liburnia]] respectively, is also proposed. The consensus now is that Illyrian was quite distinct from Venetic and Liburnian,&lt;ref&gt;Wilkes, J. J. The Illyrians, 1992,{{ISBN|0631198075}}, p. 183,"We may begin with the Venetic peoples, Veneti, Carni, Histri and Liburni, whose language set them apart from the rest of the Illyrians...."&lt;/ref&gt; but a close linguistic relation has not been ruled out and is still being investigated.

Another hypothesis would group Illyrian with [[Dacian language|Dacian]] and [[Thracian]] into a [[Thraco-Illyrian]] branch,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Paglia, Sorin (2002),"Pre-Slavic and Pre-Romance Place-Names in Southeast Europe." 'Proceedings of the 8th International Congress of Thracology', Sofia, Bulgarian Institute of Thracology – Europa Antiqua Foundation - Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, I, 219–229, who states: "According to the available data, we may surmise that Thracian and Illyrian were mutually understandable, e.g. like Czech and Slovak, in one extreme, or like Spanish and Portuguese, at the other."&lt;/ref&gt; and a competing hypothesis would exclude Illyrian from a [[Daco-Thracian]] grouping in favor of [[Mysian]].&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Georgiev (1960), Raporturile dintre limbile dacă, tracă şi frigiană, "Studii Clasice" Journal, II, 1960, 39-58.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[classification of Thracian]] itself is a matter of contention and uncertainty.

The place of [[Paeonian language|Paeonian]] remains unclear.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9057963/Paeonia Paeonia]&lt;/ref&gt; Not much has been determined in the study of Paeonian, and some linguists do not recognize a Paeonian area separate from Illyrian or Thracian. The classification of [[Ancient Macedonian language|Ancient Macedonian]] and its relationship to [[Greek language|Greek]] are also under investigation, with solid sources pointing that Ancient Macedonian is in fact a variation of [[Doric Greek]], but also the possibility of being only related through the local [[sprachbund]].&lt;ref name= OxfordCD1&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Masson | first = Olivier | title=[Ancient] Macedonian language|editor = Hornblower, S. and Spawforth A. (eds.) | encyclopedia = [[Oxford Classical Dictionary|The Oxford Classical Dictionary]] | origyear = 1996 | edition = revised 3rd | year = 2003 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = USA | isbn =0-19-860641-9 |pages =905–906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Phrygian language|Phrygian]], on the other hand, is considered to have been most likely closely related to Greek.&lt;ref&gt;Brixhe, Cl. "Le Phrygien". In Fr. Bader (ed.), ''Langues indo-européennes'', pp. 165-178, Paris: CNRS Editions.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Albanian==
The [[Albanian language]] is considered by current linguistic consensus to have developed from one of the non-Greek, ancient Indo-European languages of the region. Some historians believe it is derived from ancient [[Illyrian languages|Illyrian]], while others hold that it has its roots in the ancient [[Thracian language|Thracian tongue]].&lt;ref&gt;Eastern Europe: An Introduction to the People, Lands, and Culture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25740">In [[linguistics]], a '''relativizer''' ([[list of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] '''{{sc|rel}}''')  is a type of [[Conjunction (grammar)|conjunction]] that introduces a [[relative clause]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schacter|first=Paul|title=Parts-of-speech systems|year=1985|pages=3–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, in English, the conjunction ''that'' may be considered a relativizer in a sentence such as "I have one that you can use."&lt;ref name=Fox&gt;Fox, Barbara A. and Thompson, Sandra A. (2007) "Relative Clauses in English conversation: Relativizers, frequency, and the notion of construction", Studies in Language, 31 (2), p.&amp;nbsp;293-326(34).&lt;/ref&gt; Relativizers do not appear, at least overtly, in all languages; even in languages that do have overt or pronounced relativizers, they do not necessarily appear all of the time. For these reasons it has been suggested that in some cases, a "[[Zero (linguistics)|zero]] relativizer" may be present, meaning that a relativizer is implied in the grammar but is not actually realized in speech or writing.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt; For example, the word ''that'' can be omitted in the above English example, producing "I have one you can use", using (on this analysis) a zero relativizer.

==Analysis==

Since as far back as 1712, people have written about relativizers and what functions they have.  They have been classified as conjunctions in earlier times, and have later been referred to as clause markers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Long|first=Ralph|title=The Sentence and its Parts|year=1961|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago &amp; London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are known today as relativizers. Despite an agreement in nomenclature, there are multiple analyses which attempt to account for the grammatical function and distribution of relativizers.

===Promotional analysis===

The promotional analysis is a transformational analysis from 1973 depicting relative clauses in English, and how relative pronouns are introduced into the embedded clause.  This analysis assumes that there is no overt head noun in the [[deep structure]] of the [[main clause]].  In order to form a relative construction, the noun phrase from the embedded clause is promoted to the empty head of the noun phrase of the main clause.  From there, a corresponding relative pronoun leaves a trace in the space of the vacated noun phrase in the embedded clause.&lt;ref name="Ihalainen 1981 371–375"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ihalainen|first=Ossi|title=Promotion vs Matching: Two Competing Transformational Analyses of English Relative Clauses|journal=English Studies|year=1981|volume=62|issue=4|pages=371–375|doi=10.1080/00138388108598127}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example:
[[File:Figure 1, Tree displaying Promotional Analysis.jpeg|thumb|center|250px|Figure 1:  Tree displaying Promotional Analysis]]

===Matching analysis===
The Matching Analysis is another type of transformational analysis from the 1970s, which was in competition with the Promotional Analysis at that time.  In this analysis the relative pronoun is introduced into the embedded clause by corresponding or matching to the head noun in the main clause.  This is done by taking the noun phrase from the embedded sentence in the deep structure that matches the head noun in the noun phrase of the main clause, and replacing it with a relative pronoun.  The relative pronoun thus co-references the head noun in the main clause.  Finally, the relative pronoun is moved to the clause-initial position.&lt;ref name="Ihalainen 1981 371–375"/&gt;  For example:
[[File:Matching Analysis.jpg|thumb|center|250px|Figure 2: Tree displaying Matching Analysis]]

===Ouhallian analysis===

There are two separate phrasal heads that relativizers can occupy. Cross-linguistically, relativizers may occupy either the head of a [[complementizer]] phrase (C-Type Relativizer) or the head of a determiner phrase (D-Type Relativizer).  C-Type Relativizers can introduce a relative clause as an argument of a noun phrase, or they can introduce a relative clause as an argument of a verb phrase. D-Type Relativizers may only introduce a relative clause as an argument of a noun phrase. English is a language which uses a C-Type Relativizer, that, as a part of its relativization strategy because "that" can introduce a relative clause as either the argument to a [[Noun Phrase]] or the argument to a Complementizer Phrase. The following examples from English shows the same morpheme being used in both syntactic contexts.&lt;ref name="Ouhalla"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ouhalla|first=Jamal|title=Semitic Relatives|journal=Linguistic Inquiry|year=2004|volume=35|issue=2|pages=288–300|doi=10.1162/002438904323019084}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| [[File:DtypeRelativizer.jpg|thumb|center|250px|Figure 4: Tree displaying Relativizer as an argument to the Noun Phrase]]
|}

Conversely, Arabic uses two phonologically distinct morphemes to account for these syntactic phenomena. In the same sentences in a D-Type language like Arabic, each example would employ the use of a different morpheme as shown in examples 1 &amp; 2.&lt;ref name=Ouhalla/&gt;

 1) ''paris '''lli''' bħibba
    ''Paris '''RM''' I.love.it'''''
    The Paris '''that''' I love

 2) ''xabbaret-na laila '''ʔenno''' l-mmaslin mʔadrabiin
    ''told-us laila '''that''' the-actors on.strike''
    Laila told us '''that''' the actors are on strike.''

==In modern English==

There are three types of relativizers used in English to introduce relative clauses: zero or null relativizers, ''wh''-relativizers, and the ''that''-relativizer.&lt;ref name="sag"&gt;Sag, Ivana A. 1997. “[https://www.academia.edu/download/31190371/10.1.1.51.7483.pdf English relative clause constructions]”. Journal of linguistics. 33 (2), p. 431-483. DOI: 10.1017/S002222679700652X&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparative distribution of null and overt relativizers===

'''Relativizers''' have been analyzed to be optional in certain languages and are variably omitted in the English language.  Such relativizer omission, or use of the null or zero variant of relativizers, does not pattern uniformly in English and has been predicted to be conditioned and constrained by a number of linguistic and social factors.&lt;ref name=Levey&gt;Levey, Stephen and Hill, Carolyn. (2013). “Social and Linguistic Constraints on Relativizer Omission in Canadian English”, American Speech, 88 (1), p. 32-62.]&lt;/ref&gt;  These social factors and the potential influence of age, gender, and education have been minimally explored and seem to exhibit a lesser effect on relativizer omission.  [[Linguistics|Linguistic]] constraints, such as sentence structure and [[syntax|syntactic]] position of the relativizer, [[clause|main clause]] construction type, lexical specificity of the head NP, type of antecedent, and the adjacency, length, and grammatical subject of the [[relative clause]] have been implicated as having more significant influence on the patterning of relativizer omission in Canadian English.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;  The omission of relativizers tends to occur more frequently in conversation than in formal writing.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;

====Distribution with subject and object relative clauses====
The syntactic position or function of the relativizer in the relative clause is a major determiner for the choice of relative marker.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;  The null relativizer variant is more common in object than subject relative clauses.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;
 3) ''I have friends '''that''' are moving in together.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;''  (subject)
 4) ''That's one thing '''that''' I actually admire very much in my father.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;''  (direct object)
 5) ''Everyone's kinda used to the age group '''[Ø]''' they work with.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;''  (object of preposition)

====Informational content of the main clause determines distribution====
There is a preference for null relativizers when a [[clause|main clause]] that is informationally light is directly ''adjacent'' to the [[relative clause]].&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;  For example:
 6) ''It's just kinda something '''[Ø]''' I noticed recently.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;''
 7) ''They get values and stuff like that from church '''that''' they might not get at home.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;''
In this example, the main clause 'it's just kinda something' provides little [[semantics|semantic]] information and it is adjacent to the relative clause 'I noticed recently'.  As such, it is thought that the main clause and the relative clause are processed together as a unitary processing chunk that is functioning like a single statement, which results in a null relativizer.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;

====Distribution with empty head noun phrases====
Empty head [[noun phrase]]s, which are not lexically specific and which index generic groups or sets, have been correlated with the use of the null relativizer.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;  Examples of empty noun phrases include words like ''all'', ''way'', ''time'', etc.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;
 8) ''All '''[Ø]''' she wants to do is sleep.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;''
 9) ''She held onto all those jewelry boxes '''that''' everybody made for her when we were kids.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;''

Unique head [[noun phrase]]s, which include [[superlative]]s and [[noun]]s with the words ''only'' and ''first'', also take the null relativizer.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;  For example:
 10) ''That's the only place '''[Ø]''' you can go at night.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;''
 11) ''That's the first compliment '''[Ø]''' I've got in a long time.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;''
 12) ''That was the worst job '''[Ø]''' I ever had.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;''
 13) ''You have a home here '''that''' you could rent.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;''

====Length of the noun phrase determines distribution====
Longer head [[noun phrase]]s often co-occur with an overt relativizer, whereas shorter noun phrases are more likely to co-occur with a null relativizer.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;  For example:
 14) ''This pair of suede pants '''that''' I got.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;''
 15) ''The weight '''[Ø]''' I should be at.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;''
In these examples, the first sentence contains a longer noun phrase ('This pair of suede pants') in comparison to the second sentence, which contains a very short noun phrase ('The weight').  Thus, it is observed that the sentence containing the longer noun phrase also contains the relativizer 'that', whereas the sentence with the shorter noun phrase has a null relativizer.

====Definiteness of the noun phrase determines distribution====
Null relativizers have been found to be correlated to the definiteness of the nominal antecedent.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;  For example:
 16) ''I don't think you have the dedicated teacher '''that''' I had.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;''
 17) ''And it was a guy '''[Ø]''' she worked with for a few years.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;''
The first sentence contains a definite noun phrase, whereas the second sentence contains an indefinite noun phrase which co-occurs with the null relativizer.

====Distribution with relative clause pronominal subjects====
When the grammatical subject of a relative clause is a pronoun, it is more likely that the relativizer will be omitted.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;  When the subject of a relative clause is a full noun phrase, the overt relativizer will be retained.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;  For example:
 18) ''I have two cats '''[Ø]''' I'd like to turn in to the Humane Society.&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;''
 19) ''Do you remember exactly the road '''[Ø]''' I'm talking about?&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;''
 20) ''That was one of the things '''[Ø]''' he did when he was living elsewhere.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;''
 21) ''I always go to my girlfriends 'cause there's stuff '''that''' your parents just don't need to know.&lt;ref name=Levey/&gt;''

===Distribution of overt English relativizers===
{{Main|English relative clauses}}
The overt relativizers of Modern English include the words '''“which”''', '''“what”''', '''“when”''', '''“where”''', '''“who”''', '''“whom”''' and '''“whose”''', and these can be referred to within linguistics as "''wh''-words". These are officially classified as [[relative pronouns]], but can be referred to as “''wh''-relativizers” in instances where their function is to introduce a [[relative clause]].
The other overt relativizer of Modern English is the word '''“that”''', which can be referred to as the “''that''-relativizer” where it introduces a relative clause. There is some debate as to whether to classify it as a relative pronoun - like the wh-words, a [[subordinating conjunction]], or a [[complementizer]].&lt;ref name="sag" /&gt; The distribution of the different types of English relativizers varies depending on several factors.

====Fused relative clauses====
Fused relative clauses, sometimes referred to as “free” relative clauses, are different from most other types of relative clauses in that there is no nominal antecedent to which the relative clause refers. In many cases, the relativizers of English are relative pronouns, meaning that they are in [[coreference]] with a noun that precedes them in the sentence. This nominal function is “fused” with the relative clause in free relatives, and this leaves the relativizer without an overt entity to which it can refer. For example:
 22) ''I wonder '''what''' inspired them&lt;ref name="sag" /&gt;''
 23) ''I wonder '''whose''' dog died&lt;ref name="sag" /&gt;''
There is no noun preceding the relative clause in these cases, and that is why it is said that this noun’s function is “fused” with the relative clause.

====Grammatical function of the relativized nominal determines relativizer case form====
Where there are different [[grammatical case]] forms of a relativizer, the case form that surfaces will depend on the [[grammatical function]] of the noun that appears previously in the sentence to which the relative clause refers, known as the nominal antecedent. The only examples in Modern English of this phenomenon are the forms “who” and “whom”. “Who” surfaces when it refers to a noun that is the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] of the main clause, and “whom” surfaces when it refers to a noun that is an [[object (grammar)|object]] of the main clause. However, speaker judgments vary as to whether it is grammatical for "who" to surface when it is referring to an object of the main clause. Since, depending on speaker judgments, either only "whom" or both "who and "whom" can grammatically introduce a relative clause referring to an object, there is an "m" in brackets on the end of the relativizer in example (21) below.
* Subject antecedent
 24) ''The person '''who''' visited Kim&lt;ref name="sag" /&gt;''
* Object antecedent
 25) ''The chairman listened to the student '''who(m)''' the professor gave a low grade to&lt;ref&gt;Eckman, Fred R. and Bell, Lawrence and Nelson, Diane. "On the generalization of relative clause instruction in the acquisition of English as a second language", Applied Linguistics. (1988), 9 (1), p. 1-20. DOI: 10.1093/applin/9.1.1&lt;/ref&gt;''

====Animacy of the antecedent determines distribution====
Only certain relativizers can introduce clauses that refer to human antecedents, and similarly, only certain relativizers can introduce clauses that refer to non-human antecedents. “Who”, “whom”, and “whose” can only refer to human antecedents, “which”, and “what” can only refer to non-human antecedents. “That”, however, can refer to both human and non-human antecedents. To exemplify: 
* Human antecedent
 26) ''The Pat '''that''' I like is a genius&lt;ref name="sag" /&gt;''
 27) ''The Pat '''who''' I like is a genius&lt;ref name="sag" /&gt;''
 28) ''The only person '''that''' I like '''whose''' kids Dana is willing to put up with is Pat&lt;ref name="sag" /&gt;''
* Non-human antecedent
 29) ''Every essay '''that''' she's written '''which''' I've read is on that pile&lt;ref name="sag" /&gt;''
 30) ''Every essay '''which''' she's written '''that''' I've read is on that pile&lt;ref name="sag" /&gt;''

====Restrictiveness of the relative clause determines distribution====
Restrictive relative clauses add extraneous information that is not vital for the listener or reader’s understanding of which aforementioned noun is being referenced; or in other words, which noun is the nominal antecedent. Both ''wh''-relativizers and the ''that''-relativizer can be used to introduce restrictive relative clauses. Nonrestrictive relative clauses have [[semantic]] properties which make them necessary to prevent the sentence from being ambiguous. They are used in cases where the context that surrounds the sentence is not sufficient for the distinction between the potential nominal antecedents. Commas mark nonrestrictive relative clauses, and only the ''wh''-relativizers can be used to introduce them. To exemplify:
* Restrictive sentences:
 31) ''He has four sons '''that''' became lawyers &lt;ref name="bache"&gt;Bache, Carl and Jakobsen, Leif K. (1980) "On the distribution between restrictive and nonrestrictive relative clauses in modern English", Lingua, 52 (2), p. 243-267&lt;/ref&gt;''
 32) ''The soldiers '''who''' were brave ran forward&lt;ref name="bache" /&gt;''
* Nonrestrictive sentences:
 33) ''He has four sons, '''who''' became lawyers&lt;ref name="bache" /&gt;''
 34) ''The soldiers, '''who''' were brave, ran forward&lt;ref name="bache" /&gt;''

====Finiteness of the relative clause determines distribution====
In non-finite clauses (clauses in which the verb is left unconjugated), the relativizer appears as an object of preposition, or in other words, directly after a preposition in the sentence. These relative clauses appear to be introduced by the preposition itself, but they are actually introduced by both the preposition and the relativizer, since these two grammatical particles form a “prepositional phrase”; and it is this phrase that introduces the clause. For example:
 35) A yard in '''which''' to have a party&lt;ref name="sag" /&gt;
 36) The baker in '''whom''' to place your trust&lt;ref name="sag" /&gt;
 37) A student *'''who''' to talk to us just walked in&lt;ref name="sag" /&gt;
Note that (37) is ungrammatical because the relativizer introduces a non-finite relative clause, but it is not contained within a propositional phrase.

==Examples in other languages==

===Indonesian Teochew===
[[Teochew dialect|Teochew]] is a [[Chinese language]] originating from the [[Chaoshan]] region of the eastern Guangdong province.&lt;ref name="Peng 2012"&gt;{{cite thesis | degree= Ph.D. |first= Annie |last= Peng |title= Aspects of the Syntax of Indonesian Teochew |publisher= University of Delaware |year= 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indonesian Teochew refers to the Teochew dialect spoken in [[Indonesia]]. The most common way to form relative clauses in Indonesian Teochew is to use the relativizer ''kai''. These relative clauses can appear head-finally or head-initially.

====Jambi Teochew====
[[Jambi]] Teochew is a variety of Indonesian Teochew that is spoken in the province of Jambi on the island of [[Sumatra]]. In this language, the relativizer ''kai'' is used to form relative clauses. In these relative clauses, the ''kai'' is obligatory. This relativizer comes from the Chinese language. The relativizer ''yang'' is optional, and is borrowed from [[Malay language|Malaysian]]. The relativizer ''kai'' must always follow the modifying clause. If the optional relativizer ''yang'' is used, it would precede the modifying clause, as shown by example #43. If the relativizer ''kai'' is not present, the sentence becomes ungrammatical, regardless of whether ''yang'' is present or not.&lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt; This is demonstrated in example #45.

 38) ''Aling phaʔ '''kai''' nongkiǎ khau.''
      Aling hit '''REL''' child cry
      ‘The child that Aling hit cried.’ &lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt;

 39) '''''yang''' Aling phaʔ '''kai''' nongkiǎ khau.''
      '''REL''' Aling hit '''REL''' child cry
      ‘The child that Aling hit cried.’ &lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt;

 40) ''*Aling phaʔ nongkiǎ khau.''
      Aling hit child cry
      ‘The child that Aling hit cried.’ &lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt;

 41) ''*'''yang''' Aling phaʔ nongkiǎ khau.''
      '''REL''' Aling hit child cry 
      ‘The child that Aling hit cried.’ &lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt;

Another way of forming relative clauses in Jambi Teochew is through using the classifier. The main difference between the ''kai'' and classifier relative clause is that there is the presence of a classifier in the classifier relative clause.&lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt; The classifier in classifier relative clauses can only appear head-initially.&lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt; The classifier agrees with the head noun type and is in the place of the relativizer ''kai''.

 42) ''ka Aling '''kai''' kau zin tua tsiaʔ.''
       bite Aling '''REL''' dog very big CL.
       ‘The dog that bit Aling is a very big one.’ &lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt;

 43) ''ka Aling '''tsiaʔ''' kau zin tua tsiaʔ.''
       bite Aling CL dog very big CL. 
       ‘The dog that big Aling is a very big one.’ &lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt;

Headless relative clauses do not have a pronounced head.&lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt; It is the equivalent of “the one” in English. Headless relative clauses are formed with the relativizer ''kai''.  The Malaysian relativizer ''yang'' can be used optionally before the modifying clause.

 44) ''[zazik khau '''kai'''] si zi su m ui.''
       yesterday cry '''REL''' COP this CL one.
       ‘The one who cried yesterday is this one.’ &lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt;

The relativizer ''kai'' is obligatory.  In addition, it is not possible to form a headless relative clause with a classifier in the place of the relativizer ''kai''.

 45) ''zi pung phou si [Aling sia '''kai'''].''
       this CL book COP Aling write '''REL'''.
       ‘This book is the one that Aling wrote.’

 46) ''*zi pung phou si [Aling sia pung].''
       this CL book COP Aling write CL
       ‘This book is the one that Aling wrote.’ &lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt;

==== Pontianak Teochew ====
[[Pontianak, Indonesia|Pontianak]] Teochew is a variety of Indonesian Teochew that is spoken in the capital city of Pontianak in the province of [[West Kalimantan]]. The relativizer ''kai'' is used to form relative clauses. It is obligatory in head-final relative clauses. If ''kai'' is not present in the sentence, the sentence becomes ungrammatical, as demonstrated by example #52. Pontianak Teochew does not allow the use of the Malaysian relativizer ''yang''. When this relativizer is present, the sentence becomes ungrammatical. This is shown in example #53.

 47) ''Aling phaʔ '''kai''' nongkiǎ khau.''
       Aling hit '''REL''' child cry
       ‘The child that Aling hit cried.’ &lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt;

 48) ''*Aling phaʔ nongkiǎ khau.''
       Aling hit child cry
       ‘The child that Aling hit cried.’ &lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt;

 49) ''*'''yang''' Aling phaʔ '''kai''' nongkiǎ khau.''
       '''REL''' Aling hit '''REL''' child cry
       ‘The child that Aling hit cried.’ &lt;ref name="Peng 2012"/&gt;

===Ute===
[[Colorado River Numic language|Ute]] is a language that belongs to the Northern Division of the [[Uto-Aztecan]] language family that spans the distance from the Rocky Mountains to Popocatepetl volcano south of Mexico City.

In Ute, relative clauses that modify the subject are introduced in a different manner than those that modify the object. In both cases, there is no overt relativizer morpheme, rather [[nominalization]] and [[Grammatical case|case]] morphology are used to introduce relative clauses.

For example, nominalizing suffixes are attached to verbal elements in subject relative clauses.

 50) '''áapachi 'u [sivaatuchi 'uway paqha-puga-tu]''
      boy.SU 3s.SU  goat.O    3s.O  kill-REM-NOM
      The boy who killed the goat

In relative clauses that are introduced as arguments to an object, the verbal elements are inflected with nominalizing morphology similar to that of their subject relative clause counterparts and the subject of the embedded clause is inflected with the [[genitive]] case.

 51) ''po'oqwatu 'uru [na'achichi 'uway po'o-na]-y punikya-qha-n''
       book.O    the.O girl.GEN  3s.GEN write-NOM-O see-ANT-1s
       I saw the book that the girl is writing

'''Resígaro''' is an [[Arawakan language]] of [[Peru]] believed to be nearly extinct as of 2017 with only one remaining speaker.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.survivalinternational.org/news/11549&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://internacional.elpais.com/internacional/2016/12/20/america/1482271957_900774.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Aikhenvald (1999) classifies it among the Western Nawiki Upper Amazonian languages. Kaufman (1994) had made it a separate branch of Upper Amazonian.

On November 25, 2016 the last female speaker of Resígaro, Rosa Andrade was brutally murdered in a beheading at the age of 67. Her niece reported “She was beheaded. Her head was not found, neither her heart.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://indiancountrymedianetwork.com/news/indigenous-peoples/beheaded-peru-rosa-andrade-last-female-speaker-resigaro-language/|title=Beheaded in Peru: Rosa Andrade, Last Female Speaker of Resigaro Language - Indian Country Media Network|website=indiancountrymedianetwork.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only other remaining speaker known was Andrade's brother, Pablo Andrade, who still lives. He and his late sister had been preparing a project with the [[Ministry of Culture (Peru)|Ministry of Culture]] to document their language since October 2016, and to update books on grammar and an outdated dictionary made in the 1950s by the [[Summer Institute of Languages|Summer Institute of Language]], that promoted the translation of the [[Bible]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The  '''Society of Graphic Designers of Canada''' (GDC®) is Canadaʼs national certification body for graphic and communication design and since 1956 has established standards for design professionals, educators, and leaders. Through our certification program, GDC licenses the unique CGD™ certification mark to members whose services meet rigorous, standardized criteria. The CGD™ certification mark is recognized across Canada as the mark of professional services and ethical business conduct.

GDC is a member-based organization of design professionals, educators, administrators, students, and affiliates in communications, marketing, media and design-related fields. Our members come together via nine chapters across Canada to advocate for the advancement of the design profession.

GDC was Canada’s first distinct group to professionalize graphic design as a distinct field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://modern-canada.blogspot.ca/2011/12/graphic-art-and-design-robert-stacey.html |title=Graphic Art and Design / Robert Stacey |type=Weblog post |author=Duncan |website=Modern Canada |accessdate=July 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1956 a visionary group of designers [Frank Davies, John Gibson, Frank Newfeld, and Leslie (Sam) Smart] met in Toronto to form the Society of Typographic Designers of Canada (TDC).

Due to the rapid evolution of the profession, in 1968 the organization changed its name to the Society of Graphic Designers of Canada (GDC). Thanks to the efforts of a number of dedicated designers and design educators, negotiations between members of the original society, the federal government, and designers from every region of the country culminated in the granting of a Federal Charter in 1976, unifying the country under one national association.

In 1996 GDC’s five Ontario Chapters amalgamated to form the Association of Registered Graphic Designers of Ontario and received provincial legislation granting them authority to use the title of Registered Graphic Designer and the R.G.D. designation within the province of Ontario.

GDC celebrated its 50th Anniversary in 2006 with a commemorative stamp from Canada Post.&lt;ref&gt;https://gdc.design/about&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.canadianpostagestamps.ca/stamps/17670/50-years-of-canadian-graphic-design&lt;/ref&gt;

Today GDC has chapters throughout Canada and proudly boasts representation in every province and territory as well as many international members.

=== Friends and Affiliates of GDC ===
GDC is well-respected internationally. Our organization is a member of the International Council of Design (ico-D), the worldwide non-governmental body representing graphic and communication designers. This allows our members to attain international recognition, professional development, and a global perspective on graphic design. GDC is one of the ten largest association members in ico-D and has been a member since 1974.

GDC is also allied with the Societe des Designers Graphiques du Quebec (SDGQ), representing graphic designers in Quebec, the University and College Designers Association (UCDA), the Canadian Association of Professional Image Creators (CAPIC)and the Australian Graphic Design Association (AGDA).

In September 2010 the GDC adopted membership changes to replace the MGDC and LGDC certifications&lt;ref name="Roodenburg2010"&gt;{{cite mailing list |title=GDC Adopts New Designation for its Professional Members: CGD |url=http://lists.gdc.net/pipermail/gdc/2010-September/011674.html |mailing-list=gdc |date=September 17, 2010 |first=Rod |last=Roodenburg |accessdate=July 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gdc-adopts-new-mark-cgd" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Society of Graphic Designers of Canada |title=GDC Certification |url=http://gdc.net/join/index/articles99.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705084611/http://gdc.net/join/index/articles99.php |archivedate=July 5, 2008 |accessdate=July 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a new CGD™ certification&lt;ref name="gdc-adopts-new-mark-cgd"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gdc.net/article/2010/09/17/gdc-adopts-new-mark-cgd |title=GDC Adopts New Mark: CGD |date=September 17, 2010 |author=Society of Graphic Designers of Canada |accessdate=July 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gdc.net/article/2010/10/19/gdc-adopts-membership-changes-in-historic-meeting |title=GDC Adopts Membership Changes in Historic Meeting |date=October 19, 2010 |author=Society of Graphic Designers of Canada |accessdate=July 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to reduce confusion over the meaning of the MGDC designation.&lt;ref name="Roodenburg2010" /&gt;

==Activities==
The GDC has been an advocate and resource for Canada's graphic and communication design profession since 1956. The GDC maintains a national certified body of graphic and communication designers and promotes high standards of graphic design and ethical business practices for the benefit of Canadian industry, commerce, public service and education.

Through the media, publications, seminars, events, conferences and exhibits, the GDC builds awareness of graphic and communication design and its essential role in business and society.

Since 1960, the GDC has been recognizing as Fellows those designers who make major contributions to Canadian graphic design. Designers who have received the honour include [[Allan Fleming]] (1960), [[Burton Kramer]] (1975), [[Chris Yaneff]] (1983), [[Paul Arthur]] (1996), [[Jim Rimmer]] (2007), and [[Mark Busse]] (2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gdc.net/inspiration/fellows |title=GDC Fellows |author=Society of Graphic Designers of Canada |accessdate=July 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''South African Sign Language''' ('''SASL''') is the primary [[sign language]] spoken by [[Deaf]] in [[South Africa]]. It is an official language of South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pmg.org.za/docs/2007/070216memorandum.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=14 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216084632/http://www.pmg.org.za/docs/2007/070216memorandum.htm |archive-date=16 December 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The South African government added a National Language Unit for South African Sign Language in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eprints.ru.ac.za/2954/1/GANISO-MA-TR12-54.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214195412/http://eprints.ru.ac.za/2954/1/GANISO-MA-TR12-54.pdf |archivedate=14 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; SASL is not the only manual language spoken in South Africa,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://spil.journals.ac.za/pub/article/viewFile/55/80 |title=Archived copy |access-date=14 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214203603/http://spil.journals.ac.za/pub/article/viewFile/55/80 |archive-date=14 December 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.westerncape.gov.za/text/2009/5/sign_language_booklet.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=14 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214204937/http://www.westerncape.gov.za/text/2009/5/sign_language_booklet.pdf |archive-date=14 December 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is the language that is being promoted as the language to be used by all Deaf in South Africa,&lt;ref&gt;Aarons, Debra  and Philemon Aakach. South African Sign Language: one language or many? In ''Language in South Africa'', ed by Rajend Mesthrie, 127-147. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; although Deaf peoples in South Africa historically do not form a single group.

In 1995, the previous South African National Council for the Deaf (SANCD) was transformed into the Deaf Federation of South Africa (DeafSA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deafsa.co.za/about-us/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131218014803/http://www.deafsa.co.za/about-us/ |archivedate=18 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which resulted in a radical policy change in matters for deaf people in South Africa, such as the development and adoption of a single sign language and the promotion of sign language over oralism.  Schools for the deaf have remained largely untransformed, however, and different schools for deaf children in South African still use different sign language systems, and at a number of schools for the deaf the use of any sign language is either discouraged or simply not taught.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spilplus.journals.ac.za/pub/article/download/94/182 PDF page 4, document page 114]&lt;/ref&gt;  There are as many as twelve distinctly different dialects of sign language in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://argief.beeld.com/argief/berigte/beeld/2008/02/13/B1/4/tnjdowes.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140314014814/http://argief.beeld.com/argief/berigte/beeld/2008/02/13/B1/4/tnjdowes.html |archivedate=14 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to South African sign languages, [[American Sign Language]] (ASL) is also used by some Deaf people in South Africa.  Most local sign languages in South Africa show the influence of American sign language.

SASL is the sign language that is used during television news casts in South Africa. Sign language is also used in the South African parliament, but different sign language interpreters are known to use different signs for the same concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scholar.sun.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10019.1/4200/Selzer,%20M.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214203834/http://scholar.sun.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10019.1/4200/Selzer,%20M.pdf |archivedate=14 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are around 40 schools for the Deaf in South Africa, most using a variety of SASL.

Sign language is explicitly mentioned in the South African constitution, and the South African Schools Act permits the study of the language in lieu of another official language at school.&lt;ref name="SASLeducation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1996SAschoolAct"/&gt;

By 2011, there were 84 SASL interpreters on DeafSA's interpreter register, including 43 without any training, 31 who have completed 240 study hours of interpreter training, and 10 who have gained an additional 3 years' experience and completed a further 480 study hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deafsa.co.za/documents/SASLI_policy.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216004151/http://www.deafsa.co.za/documents/SASLI_policy.pdf |archivedate=16 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A total of 7 SASL interpreters have actually been accredited by SATI/DeafSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saslinc.co.za/|title=SASLINC - SOUTH AFRICAN SIGN LANGUAGE INTERPRETING NATIONAL CENTRE|website=www.saslinc.co.za}}&lt;/ref&gt;  SASL interpreters can apply for accreditation without having completed any formal training in SASL.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://translators.org.za/sati_cms/downloads/dynamic/sati_accreditation_for_sasl_interpreting_english.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=15 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006124638/http://translators.org.za/sati_cms/downloads/dynamic/sati_accreditation_for_sasl_interpreting_english.pdf |archive-date=6 October 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Status ==

South African Sign Language is not entirely uniform and continues to evolve. Due to the geographical spread of its users and past educational policies, there are localised dialects of South African Sign Language and signs with many variants. Earlier efforts to create reference material and standardise the language, such as books&lt;ref name="SASLbooks"/&gt; (1980 ''Talking to the Deaf'',&lt;ref name="TalkingToTheDeaf"/&gt; 1994 ''Dictionary of SASL''&lt;ref name="Penn1994"/&gt;), can only be used as historical records of the language. Daily TV broadcasts in sign language give today's South African Sign Language its national cohesion and unity.

=== Official recognition ===
{{see also|Legal recognition of sign languages#South_Africa}}

Sign language is mentioned in four South African laws, namely the Constitution, the Use of Official Languages Act, the South African Schools Act, and the Pan South African Language Board Act.

==== General recognition ====

The Constitution states that a board named the Pan South African Language Board should be established to "promote, and create conditions for, the development and use of ... sign language".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/acts/1996-108.pdf Constitution of the Republic of South Africa section 6.5.8.iii]&lt;/ref&gt;  In terms of the law that establishes the Pan South African Language Board (Act 59 of 1995), the board may establish language bodies to advise it on "any particular language, sign language or augmentative and alternative communication".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=70979 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091111212458/http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=70979 |archivedate=11 November 2009 |df=dmy-all }} Pan South African Language Board Act, Act 59 of 1995 section 8(8)(b)&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of the Use of Official Languages Act, Act No. 12 of 2012, all government departments and government entities must have a language policy that states which languages are considered the official languages of that entity, and each language policy must also specify how that department or entity intends to communicate with people whose language of choice is "South African sign language".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=175746 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019075756/http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=175746 |archivedate=19 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }} Use of Official Languages Act, Act No. 12 of 2012 section 4.2(d)&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither South African Sign Language nor any other sign language is an [[Official languages of South Africa|official language of South Africa]].  In 2008 the SASL Policy Implementation Conference gathered many key role players including scholars, researchers and teachers, policy makers, advocates and governmental bodies to promote South African Sign Language to become recognised as South Africa's twelfth official language.

==== Educational recognition ====

According to the South African Schools Act, Act 84 of 1996, all schools must have a language policy, and that when selecting languages for such a policy, a "recognised Sign Language" should be evaluated as if it has official language status along with the other eleven official languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=70921 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827233329/http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=70921 |archivedate=27 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }} South African Schools Act, Act 84 of 1996 section 6(4)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the "Language in Education" policy in terms of section 3(4)(m) of the National Education Policy Act, Act 27 of 1996, the main aims of the Ministry of Education’s policy for language in education include "to support the teaching and learning of all other languages required by learners or used by communities in South Africa, including languages used for religious purposes, languages which are important for international trade and communication, and South African Sign Language, as well as Alternative and 
Augmentative Communication".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.education.gov.za/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=XpJ7gz4rPT0%3D&amp;tabid=390&amp;mid=1125 "Language in Education" policy in terms of section 3(4)(m) of the National Education Policy Act, Act 27 of 1996]&lt;/ref&gt;

South African Sign Language is accepted as one of the languages of instruction in the education of [[Deaf]] learners.

=== Demographics ===

The number of deaf people in South Africa (600,000 deaf and 1.4 million people with hearing loss)&lt;ref&gt;(2003). DeafSA Information Booklet. South Africa: DeafSA.&lt;/ref&gt; does not give an accurate depiction of the number of people who communicate in South African Sign Language. 
There is currently no estimate for the number of people who communicate in South African Sign Language in South Africa. Estimates vary greatly, from 700,000 to 2 million users.&lt;ref name="SASLguestimate"/&gt; A request was made to the [[Human Sciences Research Council (South Africa)]] to measure this as part of the 2011 census.{{update inline|date=December 2013}}

== Linguistic features ==
{{Expert subject|Deaf|section|reason=the section contains practically nothing about the linguistics of SASL|date=May 2013}}

=== Fingerspelling ===

[[File:SASL-Fingerspelled-Alphabet.png|thumb|240px|right|South African Sign Language one-handed manual alphabet for fingerspelling]]
Fingerspelling is a manual technique of signing used to spell letters and numbers (numerals, cardinals). Therefore, fingerspelling is a sign language technique for ''borrowing'' words from spoken languages, as well as for spelling names of people, places and objects. It is a practical tool to refer to the written word.

Some words which are often fingerspelled tend to become signs in their own right (becoming "frozen"), following linguistic transformation processes such as alphanumeric incorporation and abbreviation. For instance, the sign-name for [[Cape Town]] uses incorporated fingerspelled letters ''C.T.'' ( transition from handshape for letter 'C' to letter 'T' of both wrists with rotation an horizontal axis). The month of July is often abbreviated as 'J-L-Y'.

Fingerspelling words is not a substitute for using existing signs : it takes longer to sign and it is harder to perceive. If the fingerspelled word is a borrowing, fingerspelling depends on both users having knowledge of the oral language (English, Sotho, Afrikaans).  
Although [[proper names]] (such as a person's name, a company name) are often fingerspelled, it is often a temporary measure until the Deaf community agrees on a [[Sign name]] replacement.

=== Sign-names and Idioms ===

[[Sign name]]s are specific signs which are associated with proper names (a location, a person, an organisation). Sign names are often chosen based on a salient physical property. For instance, the sign name for [[Nelson Mandela]] is signed using a flat B-hand that ''follows a hair-line over the head''. The sign name for the bank [[Absa Group Limited|ABSA]] is made with both hands following the movement implied in the company corporate logo.

=== Variation ===

South Africa is one of a few countries to have legal recognition of sign language.&lt;ref&gt;(1987). A Loss for Words: The Story of Deafness in a Family. New York: HarperPerennial. p. 31. {{ISBN|0-06-091425-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is presumably some regional variation, but signers from across the country can readily understand each other, as demonstrated for example at the annual [[Deaf Forum]].

It is commonly believed among South Africans, even among deaf South Africans, that different language communities have different sign languages.  This is evidently the result of the deaf not being able to understand sign-language interpreters from other communities.  However, this is because such "interpreters" do not actually use sign language, but rather Signed English, Signed Xhosa, etc., and only those who have been schooled in these artificial codes can understand them. (See [[manually coded language in South Africa]].)

== History of education of the deaf in South Africa ==

Timeline:&lt;ref name="Penn1994" /&gt;
* 1863 Irish nuns start ''training programmes'' in sign language
* 1874 ''Grimley Institute for the Deaf and Dumb'' established by Bridget Lynne in Cape Town
* 1881 ''De La Bat school'' established in Worcester
* 1920 Adoption of [[oralism]] in deaf schools
* 1934 Separation between ''European'' and ''Non-European'' schools
* 1941 First school "for the Black Deaf" established
* 1984 Medium of education changed from vernacular (native tongue) to English in ''Department Of Education and Training'' schools
* 1996 "Sign language" (but not specifically SASL) mentioned in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa as a language to be promoted

As early as 1863, Irish nuns were involved in training programmes for the Deaf.&lt;ref name="Penn1994"/&gt; [[Irish Sign Language]], ''"originally heavily influenced by [[French Sign Language]]"'' is said to have had a noticeable influence in sign languages in the world, including in South Africa.&lt;ref name="slsociolinguistics"/&gt;

In 1874 in Cape Town, the first institution for the Deaf called ''Grimley Institute for Deaf and Dumb'' was established by an Irish Deaf woman named Bridget Lynne.&lt;ref name="SASLlangpolicy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boner2000"/&gt;

In 1881 in Worcester, ''De La Bat school'' for the Deaf was established.

From 1877, Dominican sisters started to settle near Durban. In 1884, Sister Stephanie Hanshuber, from Germany, introduced the ''oral method'' in South Africa.&lt;ref name="StVincentHistory"/&gt;

In 1888 "King William's Town Convent School for the Education of the Deaf" was formally opened.

''"Since there is little historical evidence, it is presumed that South African Sign Language has a mixture of the Irish influence from the Dominican Irish nuns, and British influence as well as the American influence. (Sign Language is the natural language of the Deaf.)"''&lt;ref name="SASLorigins"/&gt;

The {{nihongo|'''Southern Ryukyuan languages'''|南琉球語群|Minami Ryūkyū gogun}} form one of two branches of the [[Ryukyuan languages]]. They are spoken on the [[Sakishima Islands]] in [[Okinawa Prefecture]]. The three languages are [[Miyako language|Miyako]] (on the [[Miyako Islands]]) and [[Yaeyama language|Yaeyama]] and [[Yonaguni language|Yonaguni]] (on the [[Yaeyama Islands]], of the [[Macro-Yaeyama languages|Macro-Yaeyama]] subgroup). The Macro-Yaeyaman languages have been identified as [[endangered language|"critically endangered"]] by [[UNESCO]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/languages-atlas/en/atlasmap/language-id-1971.html |title=UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in danger |publisher=Unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/languages-atlas/en/atlasmap/language-id-1972.html |title=UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in danger |publisher=Unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Miyako as "definitely endangered".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/languages-atlas/en/atlasmap/language-id-1973.html |title=UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in danger |publisher=Unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2014-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All Ryukyuan languages are officially labeled as dialects of [[Japanese language|Japanese]] by the Japanese government despite mutual unintelligibility. While the majority of Ryukyuan languages have used [[Chinese language|Chinese]] or [[Japanese language|Japanese]] script for writing, the Yaeyama Islands never had a full-featured writing system. Islanders developed the [[Kaidā glyphs]] as a simple method to record family names, items, and numerals to aid in tax [[accounting]]. This system was used until the 19th century introduction of Japanese-language education. Even today, communication in the Yaeyama or Yonaguni languages is almost exclusively oral, and written communication is done in Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

[[File:A lipid micelle.png|thumb|[[Schematic]] diagram of a [[micelle]] of oil in aqueous suspension, such as might occur in an [[emulsion]] of oil in water. In this example, the surfactant molecules' oil-soluble tails project into the oil (blue), while the water-soluble ends remain in contact with the water phase (red).]]

'''Surfactants''' are compounds that lower the [[surface tension]] (or interfacial tension) between two liquids, between a gas and a liquid, or between a liquid and a solid. Surfactants may act as [[detergent]]s, [[wetting]] agents, [[emulsion#Emulsifiers|emulsifiers]], [[foaming agent]]s, and [[dispersant]]s.

==Etymology and definition==
The term ''surfactant'' is a [[Blend word|blend]] of ''surface active agent''.&lt;ref name="Rosen MJ"&gt;{{Cite book |vauthors=Rosen MJ, Kunjappu JT |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Surfactants and Interfacial Phenomena |edition=4th |year=2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1rCdNIzB78AC&amp;printsec=frontcover |isbn=978-1-118-22902-6 |location=Hoboken, New Jersey |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |page=1 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170108051750/https://books.google.com/books?id=1rCdNIzB78AC&amp;printsec=frontcover |archivedate=8 January 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States National Library of Medicine]]'s [[Medical Subject Headings|Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)]] vocabulary, ''surfactant'' is reserved for the meaning [[pulmonary surfactant]]. For the more general meaning, ''surface active agent/s'' is the heading.

[[Image:Micelle scheme-en.svg|thumb|right|[[Schematic]] diagram of a [[micelle]]&amp;nbsp;– the [[lipophilic]] tails of the surfactant ions remain inside the oil because they interact more strongly with oil than with water. The [[Chemical polarity|polar]] "heads" of the surfactant molecules coating the micelle interact more strongly with water, so they form a [[hydrophilic]] outer layer that forms a barrier between micelles. This inhibits the oil droplets, the hydrophobic cores of micelles, from merging into fewer, larger droplets ("emulsion breaking") of the micelle. The compounds that coat a micelle are typically [[amphiphilic]] in nature, meaning that micelles may be stable either as droplets of aprotic solvents such as oil in water, or as protic solvents such as water in oil. When the droplet is aprotic it sometimes is known as a reverse micelle.]]

==Composition and structure==
Surfactants are usually [[organic compound]]s that are [[amphiphilic]], meaning they contain both [[hydrophobic]] groups (their ''tails'') and [[hydrophilic]] groups (their ''heads'').&lt;ref name="The Lipid Chronicles"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bubbles, Bubbles, Everywhere, But Not a Drop to Drink|url=http://www.samuelfurse.com/2011/11/bubbles-bubbles-everywhere-but-not-a-drop-to-drink/|work=The Lipid Chronicles|accessdate=1 August 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426082602/http://www.samuelfurse.com/2011/11/bubbles-bubbles-everywhere-but-not-a-drop-to-drink/|archivedate=26 April 2012|df=dmy-all|date=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a surfactant contains both a water-insoluble (or oil-soluble) component and a water-soluble component. Surfactants will diffuse in water and [[Adsorption|adsorb]] at [[Interface (chemistry)|interfaces]] between air and water or at the interface between oil and water, in the case where water is mixed with oil. The water-insoluble hydrophobic group may extend out of the bulk water phase, into the air or into the oil phase, while the water-soluble head group remains in the water phase.

World production of surfactants is estimated at 15 Mton/y, of which about half are [[soap]]s.  Other surfactants produced on a particularly large scale are linear [[alkylbenzene sulfonates]] (1700 kton/y), [[lignin sulfonate]]s (600 kton/y), [[fatty alcohol]] [[ethoxylate]]s (700 ktons/y), and [[alkylphenol]] [[ethoxylate]]s (500 kton/y).&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Kurt Kosswig "Surfactants" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, 2005, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a25_747}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[file:sodium stearate.png|thumb|Sodium stearate, the most common component of most soap, which comprises about 50% of commercial surfactants]]

===Structure of surfactant phases in water===
In the bulk aqueous phase, surfactants form aggregates, such as [[micelles]], where the hydrophobic tails form the core of the aggregate and the hydrophilic heads are in contact with the surrounding liquid. Other types of aggregates can also be formed, such as spherical or cylindrical micelles or [[lipid bilayer]]s. The shape of the aggregates depends on the chemical structure of the surfactants, namely the balance in size between the hydrophilic head and hydrophobic tail. A measure of this is the HLB, [[Hydrophilic-lipophilic balance]]. Surfactants reduce the [[surface tension]] of water by [[Adsorption|adsorbing]] at the liquid-air interface. The relation that links the surface tension and the surface excess is known as the [[Gibbs isotherm]].

===Dynamics of surfactants at interfaces===
The dynamics of surfactant adsorption is of great importance for practical applications such as in foaming, emulsifying or coating processes, where bubbles or drops are rapidly generated and need to be stabilized. The dynamics of adsorption depend on the [[diffusion coefficient]] of the surfactant. As the interface is created, the adsorption is limited by the diffusion of the surfactant to the interface. In some cases, there can exist an energetic barrier to adsorption or desorption of the surfactant. If such a barrier limits the adsorption rate, the dynamics are said to be ‘kinetically limited'. Such energy barriers can be due to steric or electrostatic repulsions.
The [[surface rheology]] of surfactant layers, including the elasticity and viscosity of the layer, play an important role in the stability of foams and emulsions.

==Characterization of interfaces and surfactant layers==
Interfacial and surface tension can be characterized by classical methods such as the
-pendant or [[spinning drop method]].
Dynamic surface tensions, i.e. surface tension as a function of time, can be obtained by the [[Maximum bubble pressure method|maximum bubble pressure apparatus]]

The structure of surfactant layers can be studied by [[ellipsometry]] or X-Ray reflectivity.

[[Surface rheology]] can be characterized by the oscillating drop method or shear surface rheometers such as double-cone, double-ring or magnetic rod shear surface rheometer.

===Detergents in biochemistry and biotechnology===
In solution, detergents help solubilize a variety of chemical species by dissociating aggregates and unfolding proteins.  Popular surfactants in the biochemistry laboratory are [[Sodium lauryl sulfate|SDS]] and [[Cetyl trimethylammonium bromide|CTAB]]. Detergents are key reagents to [[Liquid-liquid extraction|extract]] protein by lysis of the cells and tissues: They disorganize the membrane's lipidic bilayer (SDS, [[Triton X-100]], [[Triton X-114|X-114]], [[CHAPS detergent|CHAPS]], [[Cholate|DOC]], and [[NP-40]]), and solubilize proteins. Milder detergents such as [[n-Octyl beta-D-thioglucopyranoside|octyl thioglucoside]], [[octyl glucoside]] or [[maltosides|dodecyl maltoside]] are used to solubilize membrane proteins such as [[enzymes]] and [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] without [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturing]] them. Non-solubilized material is harvested by centrifugation or other means. For [[electrophoresis]], for example, proteins are classically treated with [[Sodium lauryl sulfate|SDS]] to denature the native [[protein structure|tertiary and quaternary structures]], allowing the separation of proteins according to their [[molecular weight]].

Detergents have also been used to decellularise organs. This process maintains a matrix of proteins that preserves the structure of the organ and often the microvascular network. The process has been successfully used to prepare organs such as the liver and heart for transplant in rats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nih.gov/researchmatters/june2010/06282010liver.htm|title=Progress Toward an Artificial Liver Transplant&amp;nbsp;– NIH Research Matters|last=Wein|first=Harrison|date=28 June 2010|publisher=National Institutes of Health (NIH)|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120805083144/http://www.nih.gov/researchmatters/june2010/06282010liver.htm|archivedate=5 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pulmonary surfactant]]s are also naturally secreted by type II cells of the lung [[alveoli]] in [[mammals]].

==Classification==
The "tails" of most surfactants are fairly similar, consisting of a [[hydrocarbon]] chain, which can be branched, linear, or aromatic. [[Fluorosurfactant]]s have [[fluorocarbon]] chains. [[Siloxane surfactant]]s have [[siloxane]] chains.

Many important surfactants include a polyether chain terminating in a highly [[Chemical polarity|polar]] anionic group. The polyether groups often comprise ethoxylated ([[polyethylene oxide]]-like) sequences inserted to increase the hydrophilic character of a surfactant. [[Polypropylene oxide]]s conversely, may be inserted to increase the lipophilic character of a surfactant.

Surfactant molecules have either one tail or two; those with two tails are said to be ''double-chained''.

[[File:TensideHyrophilHydrophob.png|thumb|400px|Surfactant classification according to the composition of their head: nonionic, anionic, cationic, amphoteric.]]

Most commonly, surfactants are classified according to polar head group. A non-ionic surfactant has no charged groups in its head. The head of an ionic surfactant carries a net positive, or negative charge. If the charge is negative, the surfactant is more specifically called anionic; if the charge is positive, it is called cationic. If a surfactant contains a head with two oppositely charged groups, it is termed zwitterionic.  Commonly encountered surfactants of each type include:

===Anionic===

====Sulfate, sulfonate, and phosphate esters====
[[Anion]]ic surfactants contain anionic functional groups at their head, such as [[organosulfate|sulfate]], [[sulfonate]], [[phosphate]], and [[carboxylic acid|carboxylate]]s.
Prominent alkyl sulfates include [[ammonium lauryl sulfate]], [[sodium lauryl sulfate]] (sodium dodecyl sulfate, SLS, or SDS), and the related alkyl-ether sulfates [[sodium laureth sulfate]] (sodium lauryl ether sulfate or SLES), and [[sodium myreth sulfate]].

Others include:
*[[Docusate]] (dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate) 
*[[perfluorooctanesulfonic acid|Perfluorooctanesulfonate]] (PFOS)
*[[Perfluorobutanesulfonic acid|Perfluorobutanesulfonate]]
* Alkyl-aryl ether phosphates
* Alkyl ether phosphates

====Carboxylates====
These are the most common surfactants and comprise the carboxylate salts (soaps), such as [[sodium stearate]].  More specialized species include [[sodium lauroyl sarcosinate]] and carboxylate-based fluorosurfactants such as [[perfluorononanoic acid|perfluorononanoate]], [[Perfluorooctanoic acid|perfluorooctanoate]] (PFOA or PFO).

===Cationic head groups===
pH-dependent primary, secondary, or tertiary [[amine]]s; primary and secondary amines become positively charged at pH &lt; 10:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | title = Bordwell pKa Table (Acidity in DMSO) | url = http://www.chem.wisc.edu/areas/reich/pkatable/index.htm | publisher =  | date =  | accessdate = 11 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[octenidine dihydrochloride]].

Permanently charged [[quaternary ammonium salts]]: [[cetrimonium bromide]] (CTAB), [[cetylpyridinium chloride]] (CPC), [[benzalkonium chloride]] (BAC), [[benzethonium chloride]] (BZT), [[dimethyldioctadecylammonium chloride]], and [[DODAB|dioctadecyldimethylammonium bromide]] (DODAB).

===Zwitterionic surfactants===
[[Zwitterion]]ic ([[amphoteric]]) surfactants have both cationic and anionic centers attached to the same molecule.  The cationic part is based on primary, secondary, or tertiary [[amine]]s or quaternary ammonium cations.  The anionic part can be more variable and include sulfonates, as in the [[hydroxysultaine|sultaines]] [[CHAPS detergent|CHAPS]] (3-[(3-Cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate) and [[cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine]]. [[Betaine]]s such as [[cocamidopropyl betaine]] have a carboxylate with the ammonium. The most common biological zwitterionic surfactants have a phosphate anion with an amine or ammonium, such as the [[phospholipids]] [[phosphatidylcholine|phosphatidylserine]], [[phosphatidylethanolamine]], [[phosphatidylcholine]], and [[sphingomyelin]]s.

=== Nonionic ===

Nonionic surfactants have covalently bonded oxygen-containing hydrophilic groups, which are bonded to hydrophobic parent structures. The water-solubility of the oxygen groups is the result of [[hydrogen bonding]]. Hydrogen bonding decreases with increasing temperature, and the water solubility of nonionic surfactants therefore decreases with increasing temperature.

Nonionic surfactants are less sensitive to water hardness than anionic surfactants, and they foam less strongly. The differences between the individual types of nonionic surfactants are slight, and the choice is primarily governed having regard to the costs of special properties (e.g., effectiveness and efficiency, toxicity, dermatological compatibility, biodegradability) or permission for use in food.&lt;ref name="Ullmann" /&gt;

==In pharmacy==
A wetting agent is a surfactant that, when dissolved in water, lowers the advancing contact angle, aids in displacing an air phase at the surface, and replaces it with a liquid phase. Examples of application of wetting to pharmacy and medicine include the displacement of air from the surface of sulfur, charcoal, and other powders for the purpose of dispersing these drugs in liquid vehicles; the displacement of air from the matrix of cotton pads and bandages so that medicinal solutions can be absorbed for application to various body areas; the displacement of dirt and debris by the use of detergents in the washing of wounds; and the application of medicinal lotions and sprays to surface of skin and mucous membranes.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

== Pharmaceutical forms ==
The human body produces different types of surfactant in different parts or organs for different purposes. [[Pulmonary surfactant]] is produced in [[lung]]s in order to facilitate breathing by increasing total lung capacity, TLC, and lung compliance. In respiratory distress syndrome or RDS [[Pulmonary surfactant (medication)|surfactant replacement]] therapy helps patients have normal respiration by using pharmaceutical forms of the surfactants. One of the most important pharmaceutical pulmonary surfactants is Survanta ([[beractant]]) or its generic form Beraksurf produced by [[AbbVie Inc.|Abbvie]] and [[Tekzima]] respectively.

==Current market and forecast==
The annual global production of surfactants was 13 million tonnes in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Market Report: World Surfactant Market | publisher = Acmite Market Intelligence | url = http://www.acmite.com/market-reports/chemicals/world-surfactant-market.html | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100913183019/http://www.acmite.com/market-reports/chemicals/world-surfactant-market.html | archivedate = 13 September 2010 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reznik GO, Vishwanath P, Pynn MA, Sitnik JM, Todd JJ, Wu J, Jiang Y, Keenan BG, Castle AB, Haskell RF Smith TF, Somasundaran P, Jarrell KA."&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reznik |first1=Gabriel O. |last2=Vishwanath |first2=Prashanth |last3=Pynn |first3=Michelle A. |last4=Sitnik |first4=Joy M. |last5=Todd |first5=Jeffrey J. |last6=Wu |first6=Jun |last7=Jiang |first7=Yan |last8=Keenan |first8=Brendan G. |last9=Castle |first9=Andrew B. |last10=Haskell |first10=Richard F. |last11=Smith |first11=Temple F. |last12=Somasundaran |first12=Ponisseril |last13=Jarrell |first13=Kevin A. |title=Use of sustainable chemistry to produce an acyl amino acid surfactant |journal=Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology |volume=86 |issue=5 |pages=1387–97 |year=2010 |pmid=20094712 |doi=10.1007/s00253-009-2431-8|display-authors=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the world market for surfactants reached a volume of more than 33 billion US-dollars. Market researchers expect annual revenues to increase by 2.5% per year to around 40.4 billion US-dollars until 2022. The commercially most significant type of surfactants is currently the anionic surfactant alkyl benzene sulfonate (LAS), which is widely used in cleaners and detergents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceresana.com/en/market-studies/chemicals/surfactants Market Study on Surfactants (2nd edition, April 2015), by Ceresana Research] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320205205/http://www.ceresana.com/en/market-studies/chemicals/surfactants/ |date=20 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health and environmental controversy==
Surfactants are routinely deposited in numerous ways on land and into water systems, whether as part of an intended process or as industrial and household waste. Some of them are known to be toxic to animals, ecosystems, and humans, and can increase the diffusion of other environmental contaminants.&lt;ref name="Metcalfe TL, Dillon PJ, Metcalfe CD"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Metcalfe |first1=Tracy L. |last2=Dillon |first2=Peter J. |last3=Metcalfe |first3=Chris D. |title=DETECTING THE TRANSPORT OF TOXIC PESTICIDES FROM GOLF COURSES INTO WATERSHEDS IN THE PRECAMBRIAN SHIELD REGION OF ONTARIO, CANADA |journal=Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=811–8 |year=2008 |pmid=18333674 |doi=10.1897/07-216.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Emmanuel E, Hanna K, Bazin C, Keck G, Clément B, Perrodin Y"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Emmanuel |first1=E |last2=Hanna |first2=K |last3=Bazin |first3=C |last4=Keck |first4=G |last5=Clement |first5=B |last6=Perrodin |first6=Y |title=Fate of glutaraldehyde in hospital wastewater and combined effects of glutaraldehyde and surfactants on aquatic organisms |journal=Environment International |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=399–406 |year=2005 |pmid=15734192 |doi=10.1016/j.envint.2004.08.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="M.G.

For example, [[PFOS]] is a [[persistent organic pollutant]] as judged by the [[Stockholm Convention]]. Additionally, [[PFOA]] has been subject to a voluntary agreement by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] and eight chemical companies to reduce and eliminate emissions of the chemical and its precursors.&lt;ref&gt;USEPA: [http://www.epa.gov/opptintr/pfoa/pubs/pfoastewardship.htm "2010/15 PFOA Stewardship Program"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081027061359/http://www.epa.gov/opptintr/pfoa/pubs/pfoastewardship.htm |date=27 October 2008 }} Accessed October 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two major surfactants used in the year 2000 were linear alkylbenzene [[sulfonate]]s (LAS) and the alkyl phenol [[ethoxylate]]s (APE). They break down in the [[wikt:aerobic|aerobic]] conditions found in [[sewage treatment]] plants and in soil to the [[metabolite]] [[nonylphenol]], which is thought to be an [[endocrine disruptor]].&lt;ref name="maria"&gt;Mergel, Maria.

Ordinary dishwashing [[detergent]], for example, will promote water penetration in soil, but the effect would last only a few days (many standard laundry detergent powders contain levels of chemicals such as [[alkali]] and [[chelation|chelating agents]] that can be damaging to plants and should not be applied to soils). Commercial soil wetting agents will continue to work for a considerable period, but they will eventually be degraded by soil micro-organisms. Some can, however, interfere with the life-cycles of some aquatic organisms, so care should be taken to prevent run-off of these products into streams, and excess product should not be washed down.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Anionic surfactants can be found in soils as the result of sludge application, wastewater irrigation, and remediation processes. Relatively high concentrations of surfactants together with multimetals can represent an environmental risk. At low concentrations, surfactant application is unlikely to have a significant effect on trace metal mobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hernández-Soriano Mdel |first1=C |last2=Degryse |first2=F |last3=Smolders |first3=E |title=Mechanisms of enhanced mobilisation of trace metals by anionic surfactants in soil |journal=Environmental Pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987) |volume=159 |issue=3 |pages=809–16 |year=2011 |pmid=21163562 |doi=10.1016/j.envpol.2010.11.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hernández-Soriano Mdel |first1=C |last2=Peña |first2=A |last3=Dolores Mingorance |first3=M |title=Release of metals from metal-amended soil treated with a sulfosuccinamate surfactant: effects of surfactant concentration, soil/solution ratio, and pH |journal=Journal of Environmental Quality |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=1298–305 |year=2010 |pmid=20830918 |doi=10.2134/jeq2009.0242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biosurfactants==
[[Sophorolipid#Biosurfactants|Biosurfactants]] are surface-active substances synthesised by living cells.

Biosurfactants enhance the emulsification of hydrocarbons, have the potential to solubilise hydrocarbon contaminants and increase their availability for microbial degradation. The use of chemicals for the treatment of a hydrocarbon polluted site may contaminate the environment with their by-products, whereas biological treatment may efficiently destroy pollutants, while being biodegradable themselves. Hence, biosurfactant-producing microorganisms may play an important role in the accelerated bioremediation of hydrocarbon-contaminated sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rosenberg, E., Ron, E.

In some bacterial species such as ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'', biosurfactants are also involved in a group motility behavior called [[swarming motility]].

== Safety and environmental risks ==
Most anionic and nonionic surfactants are nontoxic, having [[LD50]] comparable to sodium chloride. The toxicity of [[Quaternary ammonium cation|quaternary ammonium compounds]], which are [[antibacterial]] and [[antifungal]], varies. Dialkyldimethylammonium chlorides ([[DDAC]], [[DSDMAC]]) used as [[fabric softener]]s have low [[LD50]] (5 g/kg) and are essentially non-toxic, while the [[disinfectant]] alkylbenzyldimethylammonium chloride has an LD50 of 0.35 g/kg.

Prolonged exposure to surfactants can irritate and damage the skin because surfactants disrupt the [[lipid membrane]] that protects skin and other cells. Skin irritancy generally increases in the series nonionic, amphoteric, anionic, cationic surfactants.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

The biodegradability of a surfactant is determined by its hydrophobic hydrocarbon group.

===Biosurfactants and ''Deepwater Horizon''===
The use of biosurfactants as a way to remove [[petroleum]] from contaminated sites has been studied and found to be safe and effective in the removal of petroleum products from soil. Other studies found that surfactants are often more toxic than the oil that is being dispersed, and the combination of the oil and the surfactant can be more toxic than either alone.  Biosurfactants were not used by [[BP]] after the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill|''Deepwater Horizon'' oil spill]].  However, unprecedented amounts of [[Corexit]] (active ingredient: dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (DOSS), sorbitan monooleate (Span 80), and polyoxyethylenated sorbitan monooleate [[Polysorbate 80|(Tween-80]])),&lt;ref&gt;European Maritime Safety Agency.

==Applications==
Surfactants play an important role as cleaning, [[wetting]], [[Dispersant|dispersing]], [[Emulsifier|emulsifying]], [[foaming agent|foaming]] and [[Defoamer|anti-foaming]] agents in many practical applications and products, including [[detergent]]s, [[fabric softener]]s, 
[[emulsion]]s, [[soap]]s, [[paint]]s, [[adhesive]]s, [[ink]]s, [[anti-fog]]s, [[ski wax]]es, snowboard wax, [[deinking]] of [[recycled paper]]s, in flotation, washing and enzymatic processes, [[laxative]]s. Also agrochemical formulations such as [[Herbicide]]s (some), [[insecticide]]s, [[biocide]]s (sanitizers), and [[spermicide]]s ([[nonoxynol-9]]).

'''UniKey''' is an [[open-source software|open-source]] [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] [[input method editor]] for [[Microsoft Windows]] developed by Phạm Kim Long. {{As of|2014}}, it is the most popular input method editor for Vietnamese.&lt;ref name="VNE Huy An"/&gt; The official [[Linux]] port of UniKey is known as [[X-UniKey]].

==Features==
UniKey supports the three most common Vietnamese input methods: [[Telex (input method)|Telex]], [[VNI#VNI Input Method|VNI]], and [[Vietnamese Quoted-Readable|VIQR]]. Due to the fragmented state of Vietnamese computing during the 1990s, UniKey supports as many as 14 Vietnamese [[character encoding]]s, including TCVN3 ([[VSCII]]), [[VNI#VNI Encoding|VNI]], [[Unicode]], [[VIQR]], VPS, [[VISCII]], and [[Windows-1258]].&lt;ref name="Manual"/&gt;

==History==
Long began developing the software privately in 1994 as ''TVNBK'', short for ''{{lang|vi|Tiếng Việt Nam Bách Khoa}}'', after [[Hanoi University of Science and Technology]] (''{{lang|vi|Trường Đại học Bách khoa Hà Nội}}''), where he was studying. TVNBK was originally written in [[assembly language]] for [[DOS]] systems. In the mid-1990s, he ported it to [[Windows NT 4.0]], renaming it ''LittleVnKey''. In 2000, he released the software publicly for the first time as UniKey and placed it under the [[GNU General Public License]]. Recent versions of the software and its source code are hosted on [[SourceForge]].&lt;ref name="VNE Huy An"/&gt; Long has also developed [[VNG Corporation#Laban Key|Laban Key]], a popular Vietnamese input method editor for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] devices that debuted in 2013.&lt;ref name="VNE Huy An 2"&gt;{{cite news|title='Trận chiến' mới của cha đẻ Unikey|trans-title=A new "battle" for the father of Unikey|author=Huy An|work=VnEconomy|publisher=Vietnam Economic Times|date=26 March 2014|accessdate=30 March 2015|url=http://vneconomy.vn/cuoc-song-so/tran-chien-moi-cua-cha-de-unikey-20140326073532323.htm|language=vi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arabic Dialects.svg|thumb|500px|Different Arabic varieties in the [[Arab world]]]]

There are many '''[[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] of [[Arabic]]''' ([[dialect]]s or otherwise) in existence. Arabic is a [[Semitic languages|Semitic language]] within the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic family]] that originated on the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. It is classified as a [[macrolanguage]] comprising 30 modern varieties, including its standard form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Documentation for ISO 639 identifier: ara|url=http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/documentation.asp?id=ara}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The largest divisions occur between the spoken languages of different regions. Some varieties of Arabic in [[North Africa]], for example, are not easily comprehensible to an Arabic speaker from the [[Levant]] or the [[Persian Gulf]]. Within these broad regions further and considerable geographic distinctions exist, within countries, across country borders, even between cities and villages.

Another major distinction exists between the widely diverging colloquial spoken varieties, used for nearly all everyday speaking situations, and the formal standardized language, found mostly in writing or in prepared speech. The regionally prevalent variety is learned as the speaker's [[first language]] while the formal language is subsequently learned in school. The formal language itself varies between its modern iteration, [[Modern Standard Arabic]] (often called MSA in English) and the [[Classical Arabic]] that serves as its basis, though Arabic speakers typically do not make this distinction.

The largest differences between the classical/standard and the colloquial Arabic are the loss of [[grammatical case]]; a different and [[analytic language|strict]] word order; the loss of the previous system of [[grammatical mood]], along with the evolution of a new system; the loss of the inflected [[passive voice]], except in a few relic varieties; restriction in the use of the [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual number]] and (for most varieties) the loss of the feminine [[plural]]. Many Arabic dialects, [[Maghrebi Arabic]] in particular, also have significant [[vowel shift]]s and unusual [[consonant cluster]]s. Unlike other dialect groups, in the [[Maghrebi Arabic]] group, first person singular verbs begin with a n- (ن).

Further substantial differences exist between [[Bedouin]] and [[sedentism|sedentary]] speech, the countryside and major cities, ethnic groups, religious groups, social classes, men and women, and the young and the old. These differences are to some degree bridgeable. Often, Arabic speakers can adjust their speech in a variety of ways according to the context and to their intentions—for example, to speak with people from different regions, to demonstrate their level of education or to draw on the authority of the spoken language.

==Language mixing and change==
{{See also|Code-switching|Koiné language|Pidgin|Creole language|Communication Accommodation Theory|Prestige (sociolinguistics)|Dialect leveling|}}

Arabic is characterized by a wide number of varieties; however, Arabic speakers are often able to manipulate the way they speak based on the circumstances. There can be a number of motivations for changing one's speech: the formality of a situation, the need to communicate with people with different dialects, to get social approval, to differentiate oneself from the listener, when citing a written text, to differentiate between personal and professional or general matters, to clarify a point, and to shift to a new topic.&lt;ref&gt;Bassiouney, 2009, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

An important factor in the mixing or changing of Arabic is the concept of a [[prestige dialect]]. This refers to the level of respect accorded to a language or dialect within a speech community. The formal Arabic language carries a considerable prestige in most Arabic-speaking communities, depending on the context. This is not the only source of prestige, though.&lt;ref&gt;Abdel-Jawad, 1986, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Many studies have shown that for most speakers, there is a prestige variety of vernacular Arabic. In Egypt, for non-Cairenes, the prestige dialect is Cairo Arabic. For Jordanian women from Bedouin or rural background, it may be the urban dialects of the big cities, especially including the capital Amman.&lt;ref&gt;Bassiouney, 2009, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in certain contexts, a dialect relatively different from formal Arabic may carry more prestige than a dialect closer to the formal language—this is the case in Bahrain, for example.&lt;ref&gt;Holes, 1983, p. 448.&lt;/ref&gt;

Language mixes and changes in different ways. Arabic speakers often use more than one variety of Arabic within a conversation or even a sentence. This process is referred to as [[code-switching]]. For example, a woman on a TV program could appeal to the authority of the formal language by using elements of it in her speech in order to prevent other speakers from cutting her off. Another process at work is "leveling", the "elimination of very localised dialectical features in favour of more regionally general ones." This can affect all linguistic levels—semantic, syntactic, phonological, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Holes 1995: 39, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; The change can be temporary, as when a group of speakers with substantially different Arabics communicate, or it can be permanent, as often happens when people from the countryside move to the city and adopt the more prestigious urban dialect, possibly over a couple of generations.

This process of accommodation sometimes appeals to the formal language, but often does not. For example, villagers in central Palestine may try to use the dialect of Jerusalem rather than their own when speaking with people with substantially different dialects, particularly since they may have a very weak grasp of the formal language.&lt;ref&gt;Blanc, 1960, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; In another example, groups of educated speakers from different regions will often use dialectical forms that represent a middle ground between their dialects rather than trying to use the formal language, to make communication easier and more comprehensible. For example, to express the [[Existential clause|existential]] "there is" (as in, "there is a place where..."), Arabic speakers have access to many different words:
* Kuwait &amp; Iraq: {{IPA|/aku/}}
* Egypt, the Levant, and most of the Arabian peninsula  {{IPA|/fiː/}}
* Tunisia: {{IPA|/famːa/}}
* Morocco and Algeria: {{IPA|/kajn/}}
* Yemen: {{IPA|/peh/}}
* Modern Standard Arabic: {{IPA|/hunaːk/}}

In this case, {{IPA|/fiː/}} is most likely to be used as it is not associated with a particular region and is the closest to a dialectical middle ground for this group of speakers. Moreover, given the prevalence of movies and TV shows in Egyptian Arabic, the speakers are all likely to be familiar with it.&lt;ref&gt;Holes, 1995, p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt; Iraqi ''aku'', Levantine ''fīh'' and North African ''kayn'' all evolve from Classical Arabic forms (''yakūn'', ''fīhi'', ''kā'in'' respectively), but now sound very different.

Sometimes a certain dialect may be associated with backwardness and does not carry mainstream prestige—yet it will continue to be used as it carries a kind of covert prestige and serves to differentiate one group from another when necessary.

==Regional varieties==
The greatest variations between kinds of Arabic are those between [[regional language]] groups. These can be divided many ways, but the following typology is usually used:{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

{{Div col end}}

These large [[Regional language|regional]] groups do not correspond to borders of modern states. In the western parts of the [[Arab world]], varieties are referred to as الدارجة ''ad-dārija'', and in the eastern parts, as العامية ''al-ʿāmmiyya''. Nearby varieties of Arabic are mostly [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]], but faraway varieties tend not to be. Varieties west of Egypt are particularly disparate, with Egyptian Arabic speakers claiming difficulty in understanding North African Arabic speakers, while North African Arabic speakers' ability to understand other Arabic speakers is mostly due to the widespread popularity of Egyptian Standard and to a lesser extent, the Lebanese popular media (this phenomenon is called [[Mutual intelligibility#Asymmetric intelligibility|asymmetric intelligibility]]). One factor in the differentiation of the varieties is the influence from other languages previously spoken or still presently spoken in the regions, such as [[Coptic language|Coptic]] in Egypt, [[French language|French]], [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]], [[Italian language|Italian]],  [[Spanish language|Spanish]],  [[Berber languages|Berber]], [[Punic language|Punic]] or [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] in North Africa, [[Himyaritic language|Himyaritic]], [[Modern South Arabian]] and [[Old South Arabian]] in Yemen and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] in the Levant. Speakers of [[mutual intelligibility|mutually unintelligible]] varieties are often able to communicate by switching to [[Modern Standard Arabic]].

Modern languages have also typically provided a significant number of new words, and have sometimes also influenced pronunciation or word order. Examples are Turkish and English in Egypt, French in North Africa and Syria, English and French in Lebanon, and English and Hebrew in Israel.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} However, a much more significant{{Weasel inline|date=August 2012}} factor for all five dialect groups is, as Latin among [[Romance languages]], retention (or change of meaning) of the form of [[Classical Arabic]] used in the [[Quran]].

===Examples of major regional differences===
The following example illustrates similarities and differences between the literary, standardized varieties, and major urban dialects of Arabic. [[Maltese language|Maltese]], a distantly related [[Siculo-Arabic]] language descended from Maghrebi Arabic is also provided.

''True pronunciations differ; transliterations used approach an approximate demonstration. Also, the [[Arabic phonology|pronunciation]] of [[Modern Standard Arabic]] differs significantly from region to region.''

For the sake of comparison, consider the same sentence in German and Dutch:

# German: Ich lese sehr gerne. Als ich zur Bibliothek ging, fand ich nur dieses alte Buch, obwohl ich ein Buch über die Geschichte der Frauen in Frankreich lesen wollte.
# Dutch: Ik lees zeer graag. Toen ik naar de bibliotheek ging, vond ik slechts dit oude boek, hoewel ik een boek over de geschiedenis van de vrouwen in Frankrijk had willen lezen.

Or in Spanish and Portuguese:

# Spanish (orthography): Me gusta mucho leer. Cuando fui a la biblioteca, encontré solamente este viejo libro. Quería leer un libro sobre la historia de las mujeres en Francia.
# Spanish (pronunciation, [[Valladolid]]): {{IPA-es|me ˈɣusta ˈmutʃo leˈer ‖ ˈkwando ˈfwi a la βiβljoˈteka enkonˈtɾe ˌsolaˈmente ˈeste ˈβjexo ˈliβɾo ‖ keˈɾi.a leˈeɾ un ˈliβɾo ˈsoβɾe la‿jsˈtoɾja ðe laz muˈxeɾes en ˈfɾanθja|}}

Some linguists do argue that the varieties of Arabic are different enough to qualify as separate languages in the way that Spanish and Portuguese or German and Dutch do. However, as Reem Bassiouney points out, perhaps the [[Dialect#Dialect or language|difference]] between 'language' and 'dialect' is [[Pan-Arabism|to some degree political rather than linguistic]].&lt;ref&gt;Bassiouney, 2009, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other regional differences===
"Peripheral" varieties of Arabic – that is, varieties spoken in countries where Arabic is not a dominant language and a [[lingua franca]] (e.g., [[Turkey]], [[Iran]], [[Cyprus]], [[Chad]], and [[Nigeria]]) – are particularly divergent in some respects, especially in their vocabularies, since they are less influenced by classical Arabic. However, historically they fall within the same dialect classifications as the varieties that are spoken in countries where Arabic is the dominant language. Because most of these peripheral dialects are located in Muslim majority countries, they are now influenced by Classical Arabic and Modern Standard Arabic, the Arabic varieties of the Qur'an and their Arabic-speaking neighbours, respectively.

Probably the most divergent non-creole Arabic variety is [[Cypriot Maronite Arabic]], a nearly extinct variety that has been heavily influenced by [[Greek language|Greek]], and written in [[Greek script|Greek]] and [[Latin script|Latin]] alphabets.

[[Maltese language|Maltese]] is descended from [[Siculo-Arabic]]. Its vocabulary has acquired a large number of loanwords from [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and recently [[English language|English]], and it uses only a Latin-based alphabet. It is the only Semitic language among the official languages of the [[European Union]].

Arabic-based [[pidgin]]s (which have a limited vocabulary consisting mostly of Arabic words, but lack most Arabic morphological features) are in widespread use along the southern edge of the Sahara, and have been for a long time. In the eleventh century, the medieval geographer [[al-Bakri]] records a text in an Arabic-based pidgin, probably one that was spoken in the region corresponding to modern [[Mauritania]]. In some regions, particularly around the southern Sudan, the pidgins have [[creole language|creolized]] (see the list below).

Even within countries where the official language is Arabic, different varieties of Arabic are spoken. For example, within Syria, the Arabic spoken in Homs is recognized as different from the Arabic spoken in Damascus, but both are considered to be varieties of "Levantine" Arabic. And within Morocco, the Arabic of the city of Fes is considered different from the Arabic spoken elsewhere in the country.

==Formal and vernacular differences==
Another way that varieties of Arabic differ is that some are formal and others are colloquial (that is, vernacular). There are two formal varieties, or اللغة الفصحى ''al-lugha(t) al-fuṣḥá'', One of these, known in English as ''Modern Standard Arabic'' (''MSA''), is used in contexts such as writing, broadcasting, interviewing, and speechmaking. The other, Classical Arabic, is the language of the Qur'an. It is rarely used except in reciting the Qur'an or quoting older classical texts.&lt;ref&gt;Bassiouney, 2009, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; (Arabic speakers typically do not make an explicit distinction between MSA and Classical Arabic.) Modern Standard Arabic was deliberately developed in the early part of the 19th century as a modernized version of Classical Arabic.

People often use a mixture of both colloquial and formal Arabic. For example, interviewers or speechmakers generally use MSA in asking prepared questions or making prepared remarks, then switch to a colloquial variety to add a spontaneous comment or respond to a question. The ratio of MSA to colloquial varieties depends on the speaker, the topic, and the situation&amp;mdash;amongst other factors. Today even the least educated citizens are exposed to MSA through public education and exposure to mass media, and so tend to use elements of it in speaking to others.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arabacademy.com/faq/arabic_language Questions from Prospective Students on the varieties of Arabic Language – online Arab Academy&lt;/ref&gt; This is an example of what linguistics researchers call ''[[diglossia]]''.

[[File:Arabic diglossia diagram Badawi.svg|thumb|400px|The diagram]]
Egyptian linguist [[El-Said Badawi|Al-Said Badawi]] proposed the following distinctions between the different "levels of speech" involved when speakers of Egyptian Arabic switch between vernacular and formal Arabic varieties:
* فصحى التراث ''fuṣḥá at-turāṯ'', 'heritage classical': The Classical Arabic of Arab literary heritage and the Qur'an. This is primarily a written language, but it is heard in spoken form at the mosque or in religious programmes on television, but with a [[Modern Standard Arabic|modernized pronunciation]].
* فصحى العصر ''fuṣḥá al-ʿaṣr'', 'contemporary classical' or 'modernized classical': This is what Western linguists call [[Modern Standard Arabic]] (MSA). It is a modification and simplification of Classical Arabic that was deliberately created for the modern age. Consequently, it includes many newly coined words, either adapted from Classical Arabic (much as European scholars during the Renaissance coined new English words by adapting words from Latin), or borrowed from foreign, chiefly European, languages. Although it is principally a written language, it is spoken when people read aloud from prepared texts. Highly skilled speakers can also produce it spontaneously, though this typically occurs only in the context of media broadcasts – particularly in [[talk show|talk]] and debate programs on pan-Arab television networks such as [[Al Jazeera]] and [[Al Arabiya]] – where the speakers want to be simultaneously understood by Arabic speakers in all the various countries where these networks' target audiences live. If highly skilled speakers use it spontaneously, it is spoken when Arabic speakers of different dialects communicate each other.Commonly used as a written language, it is found in most books, newspapers, magazines, official documents, and reading primers for small children; it is also used as another version of literary form of the Qur'an and in modernized revisions of writings from Arab literary heritage.
* عامية المثقفين ''ʿāmmiyyat al-muṯaqqafīn'', 'colloquial of the cultured': This is a vernacular dialect that has been heavily influenced by MSA, i.e. [[loanword|borrowed words]] from MSA (this is similar to the literary [[Romance languages]], wherein scores of words were borrowed directly from [[Classical Latin]]); loanwords from MSA replace or are sometimes used alongside native words evolved from Classical Arabic in colloquial dialects. It tends to be used in serious discussions by well-educated people, but is generally not used in writing except informally. It includes a large number of foreign loanwords, chiefly relating to the technical and theoretical subjects it is used to discuss, sometimes used in non-intellectual topics. Because it can generally be understood by listeners who speak varieties of Arabic different from those of the speaker's country of origin, it is often used on television, and it is also becoming the language of instruction at universities.
* عامية المتنورين ''ʿāmmiyyat al-mutanawwarīn'' 'colloquial of the basically educated': This is the everyday language that people use in informal contexts, and that is heard on television when non-intellectual topics are being discussed. It is characterized, according to Badawi, by high levels of borrowing. Educated speakers usually code-switch between ''ʿāmmiyyat al-muṯaqqafīn'' and ''ʿāmmiyyat al-mutanawwarīn''.
* عامية الأميين ''ʿāmmiyyat al-ʾummiyyīn'', 'colloquial of the illiterates': This is very colloquial speech characterized by the absence of any influence from MSA and by relatively little foreign borrowing. These varieties are the almost entirely naturally evolved direct descendants of Classical Arabic.
Almost everyone in Egypt is able to use more than one of these levels of speech, and people often switch between them, sometimes within the same sentence. This is generally true in other Arabic-speaking countries as well.&lt;ref&gt;Badawi, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

The spoken dialects of Arabic have occasionally been written, usually in the [[Arabic alphabet]]. Vernacular Arabic was first recognized as a written language distinct from Classical Arabic in 17th century [[Ottoman Egypt]], when the Cairo elite began to trend towards colloquial writing. A record of the Cairo vernacular of the time is found in the dictionary compiled by [[Yusuf al-Maghribi]]. More recently, many plays and poems, as well as a few other works (even translations of Plato){{Verify source|date=December 2008}} exist in [[Lebanese Arabic]] and [[Egyptian Arabic]]; books of poetry, at least, exist for most varieties. In [[Algeria]], colloquial [[Maghrebi Arabic]] was taught as a separate subject under French colonization, and some textbooks exist. [[Mizrahi Jews]] throughout the Arab world who spoke [[Judeo-Arabic]] dialects rendered newspapers, letters, accounts, stories, and translations of some parts of their liturgy in the [[Hebrew alphabet]], adding diacritics and other conventions for letters that exist in Judeo-Arabic but not Hebrew. The [[Latin alphabet]] was advocated for [[Lebanese Arabic]] by [[Said Aql]], whose supporters published several books in his transcription. In 1944, [[Abdelaziz Pasha Fahmi]], a member of the [[Academy of the Arabic Language in Cairo|Academy of the Arabic Language]] in Egypt proposed the replacement of the [[Arabic alphabet]] with the Latin alphabet. His proposal was discussed in two sessions in the communion but was rejected, and faced strong opposition in cultural circles.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Sawi, 2004, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Latin alphabet is used by Arabic speakers over the [[Internet]] or for sending [[short message service|messages]] via [[cellular phone]]s when the [[Arabic alphabet]] is unavailable or difficult to use for technical reasons;&lt;ref name=Yaghan&gt;Yaghan, M. (2008). "Araby: A Contemporary Style of Arabic Slang". ''Design Issues'' 24(2): 39-52.&lt;/ref&gt; this is also used in Modern Standard Arabic when Arabic speakers of different dialects communicate each other.

==Sociolinguistic variables==
[[Sociolinguistics]] is the study of how language usage is affected by societal factors, e.g., cultural norms and contexts (see also [[pragmatics]]). The following sections examine some of the ways that modern Arab societies influence how Arabic is spoken.

===Urbanization===
{{Expand section|date=April 2011}}

===Geopolitics===
{{Expand section|date=April 2011}}

===Religion===
The religion of Arabic speakers is sometimes involved in shaping how they speak Arabic. Of course, as is the case with other variables, religion cannot be seen in isolation. It is generally connected with the political systems in the different countries. Unlike that which is often the case in the West, religion in the Arab world is not usually seen as an individual choice. Rather, it is matter of group affiliation: one is born a [[Muslim]] (and even either [[Sunni]] or [[Shiite]] among them), [[Christian]] or [[Jew]], and this becomes a bit like one's ethnicity. Religion as a sociolinguistic variable should be understood in this context.&lt;ref&gt;Bassiouney, 2009, p.105.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bahrain]] provides an excellent illustration. A major distinction can be made between the Shiite Bahraini, who are the oldest population of Bahrain, and the Sunni population that began to immigrate to Bahrain in the eighteenth century. The Sunni form a minority of the population. The ruling family of Bahrain is Sunni. The colloquial language represented on TV is almost invariably that of the Sunni population. Therefore, power, prestige and financial control are associated with the Sunni Arabs. This is having a major effect on the direction of language change in Bahrain.&lt;ref&gt;Holes, 1984, p.433-457.&lt;/ref&gt;

The case of [[Iraq]] also illustrates how there can be significant differences in how Arabic is spoken on the basis of religion. (Note that the study referred to here was conducted before the [[Iraq War]].) In [[Baghdad]], there are significant linguistic differences between Arabic Christian and Muslim inhabitants of the city. The Christians of Baghdad are a well-established community, and their dialect has evolved from the sedentary vernacular of urban medieval Iraq. The typical Muslim dialect of Baghdad is a more recent arrival in the city and comes from Bedouin speech instead. In Baghdad, as elsewhere in the Arab world, the various communities share MSA as a prestige dialect, but the Muslim colloquial dialect is associated with power and money, given that that community is the more dominant. Therefore, the Christian population of the city learns to use the Muslim dialect in more formal situations, for example, when a Christian school teacher is trying to call students in the class to order.&lt;ref&gt;Abu-Haidar, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sedentary and nomadic differences==
A basic distinction that cuts across the entire geography of the Arabic-speaking world is between sedentary and nomadic varieties (often misleadingly called [[Bedouin]]). The distinction stems from the settlement patterns in the wake of the Arab conquests. As regions were conquered, army camps were set up that eventually grew into cities, and settlement of the rural areas by [[nomadic]] Arabs gradually followed thereafter. In some areas, sedentary dialects are divided further into urban and rural variants.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

The most obvious phonetic difference between the two groups is the pronunciation of the letter &lt;big&gt;ق&lt;/big&gt; ''[[qaaf|qaf]]'', which is pronounced as a voiced {{IPA|/ɡ/}} in the Urban varieties of the Arabian Peninsula (like the [[Hejazi Arabic|Hejazi dialect]] in the ancient urban cities of [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]]) as well as in the Bedouin dialects across all Arabic-Speaking Countries, but is voiceless mainly in the post-[[Arabization|Arabized]] Urban centers as either {{IPA|/q/}} (with {{IPA|[g]}} being an [[allophone]] in few words mostly in [[Maghreb|North African]] cities) or {{IPA|/ʔ/}} (merging {{angbr|[[Qāf|ق]]}} with {{angbr|[[Hamza|ء]]}}) in the urban centers of [[Egypt]] and the [[Levant]], all of which were mostly [[Arabization|Arabized]] after the [[Early Muslim conquests|Islamic Conquests]].

The other major phonetic difference is that the rural varieties preserve the [[Classical Arabic]] (CA) [[interdental]]s {{IPA|/θ/}} ث and {{IPA|/ð/}} ذ,{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} and merge the CA emphatic sounds {{IPA|/dˤ/}} ض and {{IPA|/ðˤ/}} ظ into {{IPA|/ðˤ/}} rather than sedentary {{IPA|/dˤ/}}.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

The most significant differences between rural Arabic and non-rural Arabic are in syntax. The sedentary varieties in particular share a number of common innovations from CA.{{specify|date=April 2011}} This has led to the suggestion, first articulated by [[Charles A. Ferguson|Charles Ferguson]], that a simplified [[koiné language]] developed in the army staging camps in Iraq, from whence the remaining parts of the modern Arab world were conquered.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

In general the rural varieties are more conservative than the sedentary varieties and the rural varieties within the Arabian peninsula are even more conservative than those elsewhere. Within the sedentary varieties, the western varieties (particularly, [[Moroccan Arabic]]) are less conservative than the eastern varieties.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

A number of cities in the Arabic world speak a "Bedouin" variety, which acquires prestige in that context.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

===Morphology and syntax===
;All varieties, sedentary and nomadic, differ in the following ways from [[Classical Arabic]] (CA):
* The order [[subject–verb–object]] may be more common than [[verb–subject–object]].
* Verbal agreement between subject and object is always complete.
** In CA, there was no number agreement between subject and verb when the subject was third-person and the subject followed the verb.
* Loss of case distinctions (''[[ʾIʿrab]]'').
* Loss of original mood distinctions other than the indicative and imperative (i.e., subjunctive, jussive, energetic I, energetic II).
** The dialects differ in how exactly the new indicative was developed from the old forms. The sedentary dialects adopted the old subjunctive forms (feminine {{IPA|/iː/}}, masculine plural {{IPA|/uː/}}), while many of the Bedouin dialects adopted the old indicative forms (feminine {{IPA|/iːna/}}, masculine plural {{IPA|/uːna/}}).
** The sedentary dialects subsequently developed new mood distinctions; see below.
* Loss of dual marking everywhere except on nouns.
** A frozen dual persists as the regular plural marking of a small number of words that normally come in pairs (e.g., eyes, hands, parents).
** In addition, a productive dual marking on nouns exists in most dialects ([[Tunisian Arabic|Tunisian]] and [[Moroccan Arabic]] are exceptions). This dual marking differs syntactically from the frozen dual in that it cannot take possessive suffixes. In addition, it differs morphologically from the frozen dual in various dialects, such as [[Levantine Arabic]].
** The productive dual differs from CA in that its use is optional, whereas the use of the CA dual was mandatory even in cases of implicitly dual reference.
** The CA dual was marked not only on nouns, but also on verbs, adjectives, pronouns and demonstratives.
* Development of an analytic genitive construction to rival the [[Iḍāfah|constructed genitive]].
** Compare the similar development of ''[[wikt:של|shel]]'' in [[Modern Hebrew]].
** The Bedouin dialects make the least use of the analytic genitive. [[Moroccan Arabic]] makes the most use of it, to the extent that the constructed genitive is no longer productive, and used only in certain relatively frozen constructions.
* The relative pronoun is no longer inflected.
** In CA, it took gender, number and case endings.
* Pronominal clitics ending in a short vowel moved the vowel before the consonant.
** Hence, second singular {{IPA|/-ak/}} and {{IPA|/-ik/}} rather than {{IPA|/-ka/}} and {{IPA|/-ki/}}; third singular masculine {{IPA|/-uh/}} rather than {{IPA|/-hu/}}.
** Similarly, the feminine plural verbal marker {{IPA|/-na/}} became {{IPA|/-an/}}.
** Because of the absolute prohibition in all Arabic dialects against having two vowels in hiatus, the above changes occurred only when a consonant preceded the ending. When a vowel preceded, the forms either remained as-is or lost the final vowel, becoming {{IPA|/-k/}}, {{IPA|/-ki/}}, {{IPA|/-h/}} and {{IPA|/-n/}}, respectively. Combined with other phonetic changes, this resulted in multiple forms for each clitic (up to three), depending on the phonetic environment.
** The verbal markers {{IPA|/-tu/}} (first singular) and {{IPA|/-ta/}} (second singular masculine) both became {{IPA|/-t/}}, while second singular feminine {{IPA|/-ti/}} remained. Mesopotamian dialects in southeastern Turkey are an exception for they retain the ending {{IPA|/-tu/}} for first person singular.
** In the dialect of southern [[Nejd]] (including [[Riyadh]]), the second singular masculine {{IPA|/-ta/}} has been retained, but takes the form of a long vowel rather than a short one as in CA.
** The forms given here were the original forms, and have often suffered various changes in the modern dialects.
** All of these changes were triggered by the loss of final short vowels (see below).
* Various simplifications have occurred in the range of variation in verbal paradigms.
** Third-weak verbs with radical {{IPA|/w/}} and radical {{IPA|/j/}} (traditionally transliterated ''y'') have merged in the form I perfect tense. They had already merged in CA, except in form I.
** Form I perfect ''{{IPA|faʕula}}'' verbs have disappeared, often merging with ''{{IPA|faʕila}}''.
** Doubled verbs now have the same endings as third-weak verbs.
** Some endings of third-weak verbs have been replaced by those of the strong verbs (or vice versa, in some dialects).

;All dialects except some Bedouin dialects of the Arabian peninsula share the following innovations from CA:
* Loss of the inflected passive (i.e., marked through internal vowel change) in finite verb forms.
** New passives have often been developed by co-opting the original reflexive formations in CA, particularly verb forms V, VI and VII (In CA these were derivational, not inflectional, as neither their existence nor exact meaning could be depended upon; however, they have often been incorporated into the inflectional system, especially in more innovative sedentary dialects).
** [[Hassaniya Arabic]] contains a newly developed inflected passive that looks somewhat like the old CA passive.
** [[Najdi Arabic]] has retained the inflected passive up to the modern era, though this feature is on its way to extinction as a result of the influence of other dialects.
* Loss of the indefinite {{IPA|/n/}} suffix ([[tanwiin]]) on nouns.
** When this marker still appears, it is variously {{IPA|/an/}}, {{IPA|/in/}}, or {{IPA|/en/}}.
** In some Bedouin dialects it still marks indefiniteness on any noun, although this is optional and often used only in oral poetry.
** In other dialects it marks indefiniteness on post-modified nouns (by adjectives or relative clauses).
** All Arabic dialects preserve a form of the CA adverbial accusative {{IPA|/an/}} suffix, which was originally a tanwiin marker.
* Loss of verb form IV, the causative.
** Verb form II sometimes gives causatives, but is not productive.
* Uniform use of {{IPA|/i/}} in imperfect verbal prefixes.
** CA had {{IPA|/u/}} before form II, III and IV active, and before all passives, and {{IPA|/a/}} elsewhere.
** Some Bedouin dialects in the Arabian peninsula have uniform {{IPA|/a/}}.
** [[Najdi Arabic]] has {{IPA|/a/}} when the following vowel is {{IPA|/i/}}, and {{IPA|/i/}} when the following vowel is {{IPA|/a/}}.

;All sedentary dialects share the following additional innovations:
* Loss of a separately distinguished feminine plural in verbs, pronouns and demonstratives. This is usually lost in adjectives as well.
* Development of a new indicative-subjunctive distinction.
** The indicative is marked by a prefix, while the subjunctive lacks this.
** The prefix is {{IPA|/b/}} or {{IPA|/bi/}} in [[Egyptian Arabic]] and [[Levantine Arabic]], but {{IPA|/ka/}} or {{IPA|/ta/}} in [[Moroccan Arabic]]. It is not infrequent to encounter {{IPA|/ħa/}} as an indicative prefix in some Persian Gulf states; and, in South Arabian Arabic (viz. Yemen), {{IPA|/ʕa/}} is used in the north around the San'aa region, and {{IPA|/ʃa/}} is used in the southwest region of Ta'iz.
** [[Tunisian Arabic]] (except some rural dialects which use the prefix {{IPA|/ta/}}), and therefore does not have this distinction, along with [[Maltese language|Maltese]] and at least some varieties of [[Algerian Arabic|Algerian]] and [[Libyan Arabic]].{{incomprehensible inline|incomplete sentence|date=October 2017}}
* Loss of {{IPA|/h/}} in the third-person masculine enclitic pronoun, when attached to a word ending in a consonant.
** The form is usually {{IPA|/u/}} or {{IPA|/o/}} in sedentary dialects, but {{IPA|/ah/}} or {{IPA|/ih/}} in Bedouin dialects.
** After a vowel, the bare form {{IPA|/h/}} is used, but in many sedentary dialects the {{IPA|/h/}} is lost here as well. In Egyptian Arabic, for example, this pronoun is marked in this case only by lengthening of the final vowel and concomitant stress shift onto it, but the "h" reappears when followed by another suffix.
*** ''ramā'' "he threw it"
*** ''marama'''hū'''ʃ'' "he didn't throw it"

;The following innovations are characteristic of many or most sedentary dialects:
* Agreement (verbal, adjectival) with inanimate plurals is plural, rather than feminine singular, as in CA.
* Development of a [[circumfix]] [[Negation in Arabic|negative marker]] on the verb, involving a prefix {{IPA|/ma-/}} and a suffix {{IPA|/-ʃ/}}.
** In combination with the fusion of the indirect object and the development of new mood markers, this results in morpheme-rich verbal complexes that can approach [[polysynthetic language]]s in their complexity.
** An example from [[Egyptian Arabic]]:
*** {{IPA|/ma-bi-t-ɡib-u-ha-lnaː-ʃ/}}
*** [negation]-[indicative]-[2nd.person.subject]-bring-[feminine.object]-to.us-[negation]
*** "You (plural) aren't bringing her (them) to us."
** (NOTE: Versteegh glosses {{IPA|/bi/}} as ''continuous''.)
* In [[Egyptian Arabic|Egyptian]], [[Tunisian Arabic|Tunisian]] and [[Moroccan Arabic]], the distinction between active and passive participles has disappeared except in form I and in some Classical borrowings.
** These dialects tend to use form V and VI active participles as the passive participles of forms II and III.

;The following innovations are characteristic of [[Maghrebi Arabic]] (in [[North Africa]], west of Egypt):
* In the imperfect, [[Maghrebi Arabic]] has replaced first person singular {{IPA|/ʔ-/}} with {{IPA|/n-/}}, and the first person plural, originally marked by {{IPA|/n-/}} alone, is also marked by the {{IPA|/-u/}} suffix of the other plural forms.
* [[Moroccan Arabic]] has greatly rearranged the system of verbal derivation, so that the traditional system of forms I through X is not applicable without some stretching. It would be more accurate to describe its verbal system as consisting of two major types, [[triliteral]] and [[quadriliteral]], each with a mediopassive variant marked by a prefixal {{IPA|/t-/}} or {{IPA|/tt-/}}.
** The triliteral type encompasses traditional form I verbs (strong: {{IPA|/ktəb/}} "write"; geminate: {{IPA|/ʃəmm/}} "smell"; hollow: {{IPA|/biʕ/}} "sell", {{IPA|/qul/}} "say", {{IPA|/xaf/}} "fear"; weak {{IPA|/ʃri/}} "buy", {{IPA|/ħbu/}} "crawl", {{IPA|/bda/}} "begin"; irregular: {{IPA|/kul/}}-{{IPA|/kla/}} "eat", {{IPA|/ddi/}} "take away", {{IPA|/ʒi/}} "come").
** The quadriliteral type encompasses strong [CA form II, quadriliteral form I]: {{IPA|/sˤrˤfəq/}} "slap", {{IPA|/hrrəs/}} "break", {{IPA|/hrnən/}} "speak nasally"; hollow-2 [CA form III, non-CA]: {{IPA|/ʕajən/}} "wait", {{IPA|/ɡufəl/}} "inflate", {{IPA|/mixəl/}} "eat" (slang); hollow-3 [CA form VIII, IX]: {{IPA|/xtˤarˤ/}} "choose", {{IPA|/ħmarˤ/}} "redden"; weak [CA form II weak, quadriliteral form I weak]: {{IPA|/wrri/}} "show", {{IPA|/sˤqsˤi/}} "inquire"; hollow-2-weak [CA form III weak, non-CA weak]: {{IPA|/sali/}} "end", {{IPA|/ruli/}} "roll", {{IPA|/tiri/}} "shoot"; irregular: {{IPA|/sˤifətˤ/}}-{{IPA|/sˤafətˤ/}} "send".
** There are also a certain number of quinquiliteral or longer verbs, of various sorts, e.g. weak: {{IPA|/pidˤali/}} "pedal", {{IPA|/blˤani/}} "scheme, plan", {{IPA|/fanti/}} "dodge, fake"; remnant CA form X: {{IPA|/stəʕməl/}} "use", {{IPA|/stahəl/}} "deserve"; diminutive: {{IPA|/t-birˤʒəz/}} "act bourgeois", {{IPA|/t-biznəs/}} "deal in drugs".
** Note that those types corresponding to CA forms VIII and X are rare and completely unproductive, while some of the non-CA types are productive. At one point, form IX significantly increased in productivity over CA, and there are perhaps 50–100 of these verbs currently, mostly stative but not necessarily referring to colors or bodily defects. However, this type is no longer very productive.
** Due to the merging of short {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/i/}}, most of these types show no stem difference between perfect and imperfect, which is probably why the languages has incorporated new types so easily.

;The following innovations are characteristic of [[Egyptian Arabic]]:
* [[Egyptian Arabic]], probably under the influence of [[Coptic language|Coptic]], puts the demonstrative pronoun after the noun ({{IPA|/al-X da/}} "this X" instead of CA {{IPA|/haːðaː l-X/}}) and leaves [[interrogative pronoun]]s [[in situ]] rather than fronting them, as in other dialects.

===Phonetics===
When it comes to phonetics the Arabic dialects differ in the pronunciation of the short vowels ({{IPAslink|a}}, {{IPAslink|u}} and {{IPAslink|i}}) and a number of selected consonants, mainly {{angbr|ق}} {{IPA|/q/}}, {{angbr|ج}} {{IPA|/d͡ʒ/}} and the [[interdental consonant]]s {{angbr|ث}} {{IPA|/θ/}}, {{angbr|ذ}} {{IPA|/ð/}} and {{angbr|ظ}} {{IPA|/ðˤ/}}, in addition to the dental {{angbr|ض}} {{IPA|/dˤ/}}.

====Emphasis spreading====
Emphasis spreading is a phenomenon where {{IPA|/a/}} is backed to {{IPA|[ɑ]}} in the vicinity of emphatic consonants. The domain of emphasis spreading is potentially unbounded; in [[Egyptian Arabic]], the entire word is usually affected, although in [[Levantine Arabic]] and some other varieties, it is blocked by {{IPA|/i/}} or {{IPAslink|j}} (and sometimes {{IPAslink|ʃ}}). It is associated with a concomitant decrease in the amount of pharyngealization of emphatic consonants, so that in some dialects emphasis spreading is the only way to distinguish emphatic consonants from their plain counterparts. It also pharyngealizes consonants between the source consonant and affected vowels, although the effects are much less noticeable than for vowels.
Emphasis spreading does ''not'' affect the affrication of non-emphatic {{IPAslink|t}} in [[Moroccan Arabic]], with the result that these two phonemes are always distinguishable regardless of the nearby presence of other emphatic phonemes.

The main dialectal variations in Arabic consonants revolve around the six consonants; {{angbr|[[ǧīm|ج]]}}, {{angbr|[[Qāf|ق]]}}, {{angbr|[[Ṯāʾ|ث]]}}, {{angbr|[[Ḏāl|ذ]]}}, {{angbr|[[Ḍād|ض]]}} and {{angbr|[[Ẓāʾ|ظ]]}}.

Classical Arabic {{angbr|ق}} {{IPA|/q/}} varies widely from a dialect to another with {{IPAblink|ɡ}}, {{IPAblink|q}} and {{IPAblink|ʔ}} being the most common:

* {{IPAblink|ɡ}} in most of the [[Arabian Peninsula]], [[San'ani Arabic|Northern]] and [[Hadhrami Arabic|Eastern]] Yemen and parts of Oman, Southern [[Mesopotamian Arabic|Iraq]], some parts of the Levant, [[Upper Egypt]], [[Sudan]], [[Libya]], [[Mauritania]] and to lesser extent in some parts (mostly rural) of [[Tunisia]], [[Algeria]], and [[Morocco]] but it is also used partially across those countries in some words.
* {{IPAblink|q}} in most of Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco, [[Ta'izzi-Adeni Arabic|Southern]] and [[Tihamiyya Arabic|Western]] Yemen and parts of Oman, Northern Iraq, parts of the Levant especially [[Druze]] dialects. However, most other dialects of Arabic will use this pronunciation in learned words that are borrowed from Standard Arabic into the respective dialect.
* {{IPAblink|ʔ}} in most of the Levant and [[Lower Egypt]], as well as some North African towns such as [[Tlemcen]] and [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]].

* other variations include {{IPAblink|ɢ}} in [[Sudanese Arabic|Sudanese]] and some forms of [[Yemeni Arabic|Yemeni]], {{IPAblink|k}} In rural [[Palestinian Arabic|Palestinian]], {{IPAblink|d͡ʒ}} in some positions in [[Iraqi Arabic|Iraqi]] and [[Gulf Arabic]], {{IPAblink|ɣ}} or {{IPAblink|ʁ}} in some positions in [[Sudanese Arabic|Sudanese]] and consonantally in the Yemeni dialect of [[Yemeni Arabic|Yafi']], {{IPAblink|d͡z }} in some positions in [[Najdi Arabic|Najdi]], though this pronunciation is fading in favor of {{IPAblink|ɡ}}.

Classical Arabic {{angbr|ج}} {{IPA|/ɟ/}} (Modern Standard {{IPA|/d͡ʒ/}}) varies widely from a dialect to another with {{IPAblink|d͡ʒ}}, {{IPAblink|ʒ}} and {{IPAblink|g}} being the most common:

* {{IPAblink|d͡ʒ}} in most of the Arabian peninsula, Algeria, Iraq, Upper Egypt, Sudan, parts of the Levant and Yemen.
* {{IPAblink|ʒ}} in most of the [[Levant]] and [[North Africa]].
* {{IPAblink|ɡ}} in [[Egyptian Arabic|Lower Egypt]], parts of [[Yemen]] and [[Oman]].
* other variations include {{IPAblink|j}} in the Persian Gulf and southern Iraq and coastal [[Hadhramaut]]. {{IPA|[ɡʲ]}} in some [[Arabia]]n [[Bedouin]] dialects, and parts of [[Sudan]], as the medieval [[Persia]]n linguist [[Sibawayh]] described it.

Classical [[interdental consonant]]s {{angbr|ث}} {{IPA|/θ/}} and {{angbr|ذ}} {{IPA|/ð/}} become {{IPA|/t, d/}} or {{IPA|/s, z/}} in some words in [[Egypt]], Sudan, most of the Levant, parts of the Arabian peninsula (urban [[Hejaz]] and parts of Yemen). In [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]] and other parts of [[North Africa]] they are consonantly {{IPA|/t, d/}}, but remain {{IPA|/θ/}} and {{IPA|/ð/}} in most of the Arabian Peninsula, Iraq, Tunisia, parts of Yemen, rural Palestinian, Eastern Libyan, and some rural [[Algerian Arabic|Algerian]] dialects. In Arabic-speaking towns of Eastern [[Turkey]], (Urfa, Siirt and Mardin) they respectively become {{IPA|/f, v/}}.

* 
* CA {{IPAslink|ʔ}} is lost.
** When adjacent to vowels, the following simplifications take place, in order:
*** V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;ʔV&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → V̄ when V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
*** aʔi aʔw → aj aw
*** iʔV uʔV → ijV uwV
*** VʔC → V̄C
*** Elsewhere, {{IPA|/ʔ/}} is simply lost.
** In CA and [[Modern Standard Arabic]] (MSA), {{IPAslink|ʔ}} is still pronounced.
** Because this change had already happened in Meccan Arabic at the time the [[Qur'an]] was written, it is reflected in the orthography of written Arabic, where a diacritic known as [[hamza]]h is inserted either above an ''ʾalif'', ''wāw'' or ''yāʾ'', or "on the line" (between characters); or in certain cases, a diacritic ʾalif maddah (" ʾalif") is inserted over an ''ʾalif''. (As a result, proper spelling of words involving {{IPAslink|ʔ}} is probably one of the most difficult issues in Arabic orthography. Furthermore, actual usage is in many circumstances.{{incomprehensible inline|date=October 2017}})
** Modern dialects have smoothed out the morphophonemic variations, typically by losing the associated verbs or moving them into another paradigm (for example, {{IPA|/qaraʔ/}} "read" becomes {{IPA|/qara/}} or {{IPA|/ʔara/}}, a third-weak verb).
** {{IPAslink|ʔ}} has reappeared medially in various words due to borrowing from CA. (In addition, {{IPAslink|q}} has become {{IPAblink|ʔ}} in many dialects, although the two are marginally distinguishable in [[Egyptian Arabic]], since words beginning with original {{IPAslink|ʔ}} can elide this sound, whereas words beginning with original {{IPAslink|q}} cannot.)
* CA {{IPAslink|k}} often becomes {{IPAblink|t͡ʃ}} in the Persian Gulf, Iraq, some Rural Palestinian dialects and in some [[Bedouin]] dialects when adjacent to an original {{IPA|/i/}}, particularly in the second singular feminine enclitic pronoun, where {{IPAblink|t͡ʃ}} replaces Classical {{IPA|/ik/}} or {{IPA|/ki/}}). In a very few Moroccan varieties, it affricates to {{IPA|/k͡ʃ/}}. Elsewhere, it remains {{IPAblink|k}}.
* CA {{IPAslink|r}} is pronounced {{IPAblink|ʀ}} in a few areas: [[Mosul]], for instance, and the Jewish variety in [[Algiers]]. In all of northern Africa, a phonemic distinction has emerged between plain {{IPAblink|r}} and emphatic {{IPA|[rˤ]}}, thanks to the merging of short vowels.
* CA {{IPAslink|t}} (but not emphatic CA {{IPA|/tˤ/}}) is affricated to {{IPAblink|t͡s}} in [[Moroccan Arabic]]; this is still distinguishable from the sequence {{IPA|[ts]}}.
* CA {{IPAslink|ʕ}}) is pronounced in [[Iraqi Arabic]] and [[Kuwaiti Arabic]] with glottal closure: {{IPA|[ʔˤ]}}. In some varieties {{IPAslink|ʕ}} is devoiced to {{IPAblink|ħ}} before {{IPAslink|h}}, for some speakers of Cairene Arabic {{IPA|/bitaʕha/}} → {{IPA|/bitaħħa/}} (or {{IPA|/bitaʕ̞ħa/}}) "hers". The residue of this rule applies also in the Maltese language, where neither etymological {{IPAslink|h}} nor {{IPAslink|ʕ}} are pronounced as such, but give {{IPAblink|ħ}} in this context: ''tagħha'' {{IPA|[taħħa]}} "hers".
* The nature of "emphasis" differs somewhat from variety to variety. It is usually described as a concomitant [[pharyngealization]], but in most sedentary varieties is actually [[velarization]], or a combination of the two. (The phonetic effects of the two are only minimally different from each other.) Usually there is some associated lip rounding; in addition, the stop consonants {{IPAslink|t}} and {{IPAslink|d}} are dental and lightly aspirated when non-emphatic, but alveolar and completely unaspirated when emphatic.
* CA {{IPAslink|r}} is also in the process of splitting into emphatic and non-emphatic varieties, with the former causing emphasis spreading, just like other emphatic consonants. Originally, non-emphatic {{IPAblink|r}} occurred before {{IPA|/i/}} or between {{IPA|/i/}} and a following consonant, while emphatic {{IPA|[rˤ]}} occurred mostly near {{IPAblink|ɑ}}.
** To a large extent, Western Arabic dialects reflect this, while the situation is rather more complicated in [[Egyptian Arabic]]. (The allophonic distribution still exists to a large extent, although not in any predictable fashion; nor is one or the other variety used consistently in different words derived from the same root. Furthermore, although derivational suffixes (in particular, relational {{IPA|/-i/}} and {{IPA|/-ijja/}}) affect a preceding {{IPA|/r/}} in the expected fashion, inflectional suffixes do not).
* Certain other consonants, depending on the dialect, also cause pharyngealization of adjacent sounds, although the effect is typically weaker than full emphasis spreading and usually has no effect on more distant vowels.
** The velar fricative {{IPAslink|x}} and the uvular consonant {{IPAslink|q}} often cause partial backing of adjacent {{IPA|/a/}} (and  of {{IPA|/u/}} and {{IPA|/i/}} in [[Moroccan Arabic]]). For [[Moroccan Arabic]], the effect is sometimes described as half as powerful as an emphatic consonant, as a vowel with uvular consonants on both sides is affected similarly to having an emphatic consonant on one side.
** The pharyngeal consonants {{IPAslink|ħ}} and {{IPAslink|ʕ}} cause no emphasis spreading and may have little or no effect on adjacent vowels. In [[Egyptian Arabic]], for example, {{IPA|/a/}} adjacent to either sound is a fully front {{IPAblink|æ}}. In other dialects, {{IPAslink|ʕ}} is more likely to have an effect than {{IPAslink|ħ}}.
** In some [[Gulf Arabic]] dialects, {{IPAslink|w}} and/or {{IPAslink|l}} causes backing.
** In some dialects, words such as {{lang|ar|الله}} {{IPA|/aɫɫaː/}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Allāh}}'' has backed {{IPAblink|ɑ}}'s and in some dialects also velarized {{IPA|/l/}}.

====Vowels====
* Classical Arabic short vowels {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} undergo various changes.
** Original final short vowels are mostly deleted.
** Many [[Levantine Arabic]] dialects merge {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} into a phonemic {{IPAslink|ə}} except when directly followed by a single consonant; this sound may appear allophonically as {{IPA|/i/}} or {{IPA|/u/}} in certain phonetic environments.
** [[Maghreb]] dialects merge {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/i/}} into {{IPAslink|ə}}, which is deleted when unstressed. Tunisian maintains this distinction, but deletes these vowels in non-final open syllables.
** [[Moroccan Arabic]], under the strong influence of [[Berber languages|Berber]], goes even further. Short {{IPA|/u/}} is converted to labialization of an adjacent velar, or is merged with {{IPAslink|ə}}. This schwa then deletes everywhere except in certain words ending {{IPA|/-CCəC/}}.
*** The result is that there is no distinction between short and long vowels; borrowings from CA have "long" vowels (now pronounced half-long) uniformly substituted for original short and long vowels.
*** This also results in consonant clusters of great length, which are (more or less) syllabified according to a sonority hierarchy. For some subdialects, in practice, it is very difficult to tell where, if anywhere, there are syllabic peaks in long consonant clusters in a phrase such as {{IPA|/xsˤsˤk tktbi/}} "you (fem.) must write". Other dialects, in the North, make a clear distinction; they say /xəssək təktəb/ "you want to write", and not */xəssk ətkətb/.
*** In [[Moroccan Arabic]], short {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/i/}} have merged, obscuring the original distribution. In this dialect, the two varieties have completely split into separate phonemes, with one or the other used consistently across all words derived from a particular root except in a few situations.
**** In [[Moroccan Arabic]], the allophonic effect of emphatic consonants is more pronounced than elsewhere.
**** Full {{IPA|/a/}} is affected as above, but {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} are also affected, and are  to {{IPAblink|e}} and {{IPAblink|o}}, respectively.
**** In some varieties, such as in [[Marrakesh]], the effects are even more extreme (and complex), where both high-mid and low-mid allophones exist ({{IPAblink|e}} and {{IPAblink|ɛ}}, {{IPAblink|o}} and {{IPAblink|ɔ}}), in addition to front-rounded allophones of original {{IPA|/u/}} ({{IPAblink|y}}, {{IPAblink|ø}}, {{IPAblink|œ}}), all depending on adjacent phonemes.
**** On the other hand, emphasis spreading in [[Moroccan Arabic]] is less pronounced than elsewhere; usually it only spreads to the nearest full vowel on either side, although with some additional complications.
**{{IPA|/i~ɪ/}} and {{IPA|/u~ʊ/}} in CA completely become {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} respectively in some other particular dialects.
** In [[Egyptian Arabic]] and [[Levantine Arabic]], short {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} are elided in various circumstances in unstressed syllables (typically, in open syllables; for example, in Egyptian Arabic, this occurs only in the middle vowel of a VCVCV sequence, ignoring word boundaries). In Levantine, however, clusters of three consonants are almost never permitted. If such a cluster would occur, it is broken up through the insertion of {{IPAslink|ə}}{{spaced ndash}}between the second and third consonants in Egyptian Arabic, and between the first and second in [[Levantine Arabic]].
* CA long vowels are shortened in some circumstances.
** Original final long vowels are shortened in all dialects.
** In [[Egyptian Arabic]] and [[Levantine Arabic]], unstressed long vowels are shortened.
** [[Egyptian Arabic]] also cannot tolerate long vowels followed by two consonants, and shortens them. (Such an occurrence was rare in CA, but often occurs in modern dialects as a result of elision of a short vowel.)
* In most dialects, particularly sedentary ones, CA {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/aː/}} have two strongly divergent allophones, depending on the phonetic context.
** Adjacent to an emphatic consonant and to {{IPAslink|q}} (but not usually to other sounds derived from this, such as {{IPAslink|ɡ}} or {{IPAslink|ʔ}}), a back variant {{IPAblink|ɑ}} occurs; elsewhere, a strongly fronted variant {{IPAblink|æ}}~{{IPAblink|ɛ}} is used.
** The two allophones are in the process of splitting phonemically in some dialects, as {{IPAblink|ɑ}} occurs in some words (particularly foreign borrowings) even in the absence of any emphatic consonants anywhere in the word. (Some linguists have postulated additional emphatic phonemes in an attempt to handle these circumstances; in the extreme case, this requires assuming that '''every''' phoneme occurs doubled, in emphatic and non-emphatic varieties. Some have attempted to make the vowel allophones autonomous and eliminate the emphatic consonants as phonemes. Others have asserted that emphasis is actually a property of syllables or whole words rather than of individual vowels or consonants. None of these proposals seems particularly tenable, however, given the variable and unpredictable nature of emphasis spreading.)
** Unlike other Arabic varieties, [[Hejazi Arabic]] did not develop allophones of the vowels /a/ and /aː/, and both are pronounced as {{IPAblink|a}} or {{IPAblink|ä}}.
* CA diphthongs {{IPA|/aj/}} and {{IPA|/aw/}} have become {{IPAblink|eː}} or {{IPAblink|e̞ː}} and {{IPAblink|oː}} or {{IPAblink|o̞ː}} (but merge with original {{IPA|/iː/}} and {{IPA|/uː/}} in [[Maghreb]] dialects, which is probably a secondary development). The diphthongs are maintained in [[Maltese language|the Maltese language]] and some urban Tunisian dialects, particularly that of [[Sfax]], while {{IPAblink|eː}} and {{IPAblink|oː}} also occur in some other Tunisian dialects, such as [[Monastir, Tunisia|Monastir]].
* The placement of the stress accent is extremely variable between varieties; nowhere is it phonemic.
** Most commonly, it falls on the last syllable containing a long vowel, or a short vowel followed by two consonants; but never farther from the end than the third-to-last syllable. This maintains the presumed stress pattern in CA (although there is some disagreement over whether stress could move farther back than the third-to-last syllable), and is also used in [[Modern Standard Arabic]] (MSA).
*** In CA and MSA, stress cannot occur on a final long vowel; however, this does not result in different stress patterns on any words, because CA final long vowels are shortened in all modern dialects, and any current final long vowels are secondary developments from words containing a long vowel followed by a consonant.
** In [[Egyptian Arabic]], the rule is similar, but stress falls on the second-to-last syllable in words of the form ...VCCVCV, as in {{IPA|/makˈtaba/}}.
** In [[Maghrebi Arabic]], stress is final in words of the (original) form CaCaC, after which the first {{IPA|/a/}} is elided. Hence {{lang|ar|جَبَل}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ǧabal}}'' "mountain" becomes {{IPA|[ˈʒbəl]}}.
** In [[Moroccan Arabic]], phonetic stress is often not recognizable.

'''VIZ Media LLC''' is an American [[manga]] and [[anime]] distribution and [[entertainment]] company headquartered in [[San Francisco]], California. It was founded in 1986 as VIZ LLC. In 2005, VIZ LLC and ShoPro Entertainment merged to form the current VIZ Media LLC, which is jointly owned by Japanese publishers [[Shueisha]], [[Shogakukan]] and [[Shogakukan-Shueisha Productions]] (ShoPro).&lt;ref name="owners"/&gt; As of 2017, Viz Media is the largest publisher of [[graphic novel]]s and [[comic book]]s in the United States, with a 23% share of the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Magulick|first1=Aaron|title=Viz Manga Sales are Destroying DC, Marvel in Comic Market|url=http://goboiano.com/viz-manga-sales-are-destroying-dc-marvel-in-comic-market/|work=GoBoiano|date=October 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
Seiji Horibuchi, originally from [[Tokushima Prefecture]] in [[Shikoku]], moved to [[California]] in 1975. After living in the mountains for almost two years, he moved to San Francisco, where he started a business exporting American cultural items to Japan, and became a writer of cultural information. He also became interested in publishing Japanese [[manga]] in the United States, though he himself was not a fan of Japanese comics until a visit to Japan in 1985 exposed him to [[Katsuhiro Otomo]]'s single-volume title ''[[Domu: A Child's Dream]]''.  His idea came to fruition after he met Masahiro Ohga, then managing director of [[Shogakukan]], in 1985 and shared his vision. Shogakukan provided Horibuchi with [[United States dollar|$]]200,000 in startup capital, which Horibuichi used in 1986 to found VIZ Communications.&lt;ref name="AsashiViz"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asahi.com/english/Herald-asahi/TKY200709010077.html |title=Weekend Beat: Cashing in on over-the-counter culture |first=Tomohiro |last=Oikawa |publisher=Asahi Shimbun Company |work=Asahi Weekly |date=2007-09-01 |accessdate=2008-03-12 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080316125943/http://www.asahi.com/english/Herald-asahi/TKY200709010077.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Viz Media HQ.JPG|thumb|The exterior of Viz Media's former headquarters in San Francisco, California.]]

VIZ Communications released its first titles in 1987, which included ''[[Legend of Kamui]]'', however sales were mediocre due to the specialist comic market being adverse to venturing into new territory.  To counteract this problem, VIZ expanded into the general publishing business and began publishing various art related books in 1992.  Into these titles, Horibuchi began publishing manga, calling them [[graphic novel]]s so they would be carried by mainstream bookstores. The plan worked and after several years, leading booksellers began to have dedicated shelves for manga titles. Sales also picked up when VIZ Communications acquired the license for the comedy series ''[[Ranma ½]]'', which became an instant hit.&lt;ref name="AsashiViz" /&gt;

The company continued to see success when it expanded into the [[anime]] distribution market, began publishing ''[[Shonen Jump (magazine)|Shonen Jump]]'', an English adaptation of the popular Japanese magazine ''[[Weekly Shōnen Jump]]''. It also acquired another huge selling title, ''[[Inuyasha]]''. In the late 1990s, VIZ began making the push to move into the European and South American markets.&lt;ref name="AsashiViz" /&gt;

===Shueisha co-ownership and mergers: 2000 to present===
When [[Shueisha]] became a joint owner of Viz Media in 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/1679.html|date=2002-08-02|title=Shueisha Buys Equity Interest in Viz|publisher=ICv2|accessdate=2006-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; both Shogakukan and Shueisha began to release manga exclusively through Viz. Shueisha's deal with Viz may have been prompted by competition with [[Raijin Comics]], a rival manga publisher created in 2002 by editors and artists who had split off from Shueisha, taking their properties with them. Some exceptions to this exclusivity exist, however: Shueisha permitted [[DC Comics]]'s subsidiary [[CMX Manga]] to license ''[[Tenjho Tenge]]'' (although it was later re-licensed and re-released by VIZ Media) and ''[[Kamikaze Kaito Jeanne]]'', permitted [[Dark Horse Comics]] to license ''[[Gantz]]'', ''[[Lady Snowblood (manga)|Lady Snowblood]]'', ''[[Shadow Lady]]'', ''[[The Monkey King (manga)|The Monkey King]]'', and recently [[Yasuhiro Nightow]]'s ''Blood Blockade Battlefront'' and [[Clamp (manga artists)|CLAMP]]'s ''[[Gate 7]]''. Shueisha also permitted [[Seven Seas Entertainment]] to license ''[[Hayate X Blade]]'' and will later permit Seven Seas Entertainment to license ''[[Yuuna and the Haunted Hot Springs]]'', and permitted [[Tokyopop]] to license ''[[Kodocha]]'', ''[[Marmalade Boy]]'' and ''[[Digimon Next]]'' and will allow Kodansha USA to license the ''[[Battle Angel Alita]]'' manga in America. Shogakukan permitted Tokyopop to license [[Corrector Yui]], [[Udon Entertainment]] to license the ''[[Infini-T Force]]'' manga (even though Viz Media licensed the anime), the now-defunct [[ComicsOne]] to license ''Wounded Man - The White Haired Demon'', permitted [[Dark Horse Comics]] to license ''[[Crying Freeman]]'' (even though it was previously licensed by VIZ), ''New Lone Wolf and Cub'' (however, this is because Dark Horse has [[Lone Wolf and Cub|the original series]]), ''The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword'' and ''[[Mob Psycho 100]]'', and permitted [[Hachette Book Group]]'s subsidiary [[Yen Press]] to license ''[[Azumanga Daioh]]'', ''[[Silver Spoon (manga)|Silver Spoon]]'', ''[[Karakai Jōzu no Takagi-san]]'', ''[[My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU]]'' and ''[[Cirque du Freak (manga)|Cirque du Freak]]'' (however for ''Cirque du Freak'', this is because [[Little, Brown and Company|their sister company]] publishes the original novels. For ''Azumanga Daioh'', Yen Press's license of the manga was a month before [[Shogakukan]] reprinted the manga in May 2009, resulting in a change of license holders from [[ASCII Media Works]] (when Yen Press announced the license) to [[Shogakukan]] (when Yen Press released it). The Yen Press edition is a newly translated and lettered version of ADV Manga's edition (taken from ASCII Media Works) as opposed to the 3-volume edition by Shogakukan. Yen Press has expressed interest in releasing the 3-volume edition although editor Kurt Hassler said he is not "sure this will be possible.", possibly because of the fact that Shogakukan owns Viz and that they almost exclusively license their titles to them.). In March 2010, Shogakukan began a partnership with [[Fantagraphics Books]] to issue a line of manga to be edited by Matt Thorn. In 2003, possibly in response to Shogakukan and Shueisha's co-ownership of VIZ, Japanese publisher [[Kodansha]] formed a co-venture with [[Del Rey Manga|Del Rey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/2941.html|date=2004-06-23|title=Random House Preps Manga Releases|publisher=ICv2| accessdate=2006-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, VIZ Communications was merged with ShoPro Entertainment, funding company Shogakukan's American distribution division. Horibuchi became the new company's chairman.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} In 2005, Horibuchi started a related division, Viz Pictures, for releasing selected live-action films in the US to theaters and DVD.&lt;ref name="ICv2Interview2" /&gt;

On December 17, 2008, Viz Media announced that starting on April 1, 2009, [[Warner Home Video]] would be handling the distribution of both its new and existing catalog releases. Viz itself is still the licensor and will do all production, while tapping the distribution powerhouse that distributes the works of other major companies such as [[BBC]], [[National Geographic (U.S. TV channel)|National Geographic Channel]], and [[Cartoon Network]]. Viz President and CEO Hidemi Fukuhara stated that he believes the partnership will help the company grow its anime holdings more effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://icv2.com/articles/news/13941.html |title=WHV to Distribute Viz Media Anime |publisher=ICv2 |date=2008-12-17 |accessdate=2008-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 20, 2009, Viz Media laid off an unknown number of employees in order to help be more streamlined to face the current economic climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-02-23/viz-media-restructures-with-some-employee-layoffs|title=News: Viz Media Restructures with Some Employee Layoffs|publisher=Anime News Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 11, 2010, VIZ Media again laid off a number of workers, 60 this time, again in order to try to become more streamlined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2010-05-11/pw/viz-media-lays-off-up-to-60-closes-ny-branch|title=News: PW: Viz Media Lays Off Up to 60, Closes NY Branch (Updated)|publisher=Anime News Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; This time they released a press release claiming that none of their current product lines would be affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2010-05-13/viz/no-product-or-business-line-cancellations-planned|title=News: Viz: No Product or Business Line Cancellations Planned (Updated)|publisher=Anime News Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, it was announced that the Senior Vice-President and General Manager of Viz Media Ken Sasaki would be succeeding executive producer Hidemi Fukuhara as President and CEO; Fukuhara will subsequently take up the position of Vice-President at the end of the month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2012-04-02/viz-media-names-ken-sasaki-president-and-ceo |publisher=Anime News Network |title=Viz Media Names Ken Sasaki President and CEO |accessdate=2012-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manga ratings==
In contrast to similar TV and film ratings, Viz also has set up certain "manga ratings" for their products based on their content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.viz.com/ratings |title=VIZ.com |publisher=VIZ.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''A (All Ages)''': Suitable for readers of all ages. Such titles may contain little or no objectionable content. Some, however, may contain mild language and fantasy violence but no swearing or nudity.

'''T (Teen)''': 13 years or older. May be suitable for early teens and older. Such titles may contain violence, blood, use of strong language, suggestive themes or situations, crude humor, alcohol and/tobacco use, which some people may find inappropriate.

'''T+ (Older Teen)''': 16 years or older. May be suitable for older teens and adults. Such titles may contain intense violence, sexual content, nudity, frequent strong language, alcohol, tobacco and/or other substance use.

'''M (Mature Readers)''': Suitable for 18 years or older. Such titles may contain much more extreme violence, mature themes, and graphic depictions.

Despite its name, Viz's manga ratings were also used on licensed anime titles, though, in the later 2000s, they instead relied on local countries' rating systems.

==Reception==
Viz Media was awarded the Manga Publisher of the Year Gem Award by [[Diamond Comic Distributors]] in 2007. VIZ keeps on publishing many titles, some of the most popular including: ''[[Dragon Ball (manga)|Dragon Ball]]'', ''[[One Piece]]'', ''[[Case Closed|Detective Conan]]'' (as ''Case Closed''), ''[[Bleach (manga)|Bleach]]'', ''[[Inuyasha]]'', and ''[[Naruto]]'' which results a high success of the company as well as a large amount of the North American readers.

Viz also received an award for Manga Trade Paperback of the Year for its release of the fourteenth volume of the ''[[Naruto]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-04-07/viz-wins-two-2007-gem-manga-awards-from-diamond |title=Viz Wins Two 2007 Gem Manga Awards from Diamond |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=2008-04-07 |accessdate=2008-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publication style===
By 2002 VIZ Communications kept some publications in the original right-to-left format, while in other publications it mirrored pages from Japan's right-to-left reading format to fit the Western left-to-right reading style. During that year Dallas Middaugh, the senior marketing manager of VIZ, stated that the left-to-right version of ''Neon Genesis Evangelion'' outsold the right-to-left version of ''Neon Genesis Evangelion'' on a three to one basis; Middaugh concluded that readers wanted "an easy reading experience." [[Akira Toriyama]], creator of ''[[Dragon Ball (manga)|Dragon Ball]]'', requested that his work, which was separated by Viz into ''Dragon Ball'' and ''Dragon Ball Z'', be published in the original right-to-left format. ''[[Vagabond (manga)|Vagabond]]'' was printed in right-to-left to preserve historical accuracy. Middaugh said that younger readers of ''Dragon Ball'' adapted to the right to left format more easily than their parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/1189.html|date=2002-03-08|title=What Manga Right to Left — Will It Fly?|publisher=ICv2|accessdate=2006-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VIZ has [[Censorship|censored]] some of its titles. Some titles, such as ''Dragon Ball'', were published in both censored and uncensored forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/216.html|date=2001-03-11|title=Viz Unleashes Uncensored Dragon Ball|publisher=ICv2|accessdate=2006-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divisions==

===Viz Productions===
Based in [[Los Angeles]], Viz Productions coordinates the licenses of Japanese material (manga, books and film) to American film companies.  Their goal is to involve the Japanese creators in the production and facilitate communication between all parties in the US and Japan. VIZ Productions' first film is the live action adaptation of ''[[All You Need is Kill]]'', ''Edge of Tomorrow'', starring [[Tom Cruise]] and [[Emily Blunt]]. Their second production was the American live-action adaptation to the supernatural thriller manga series: [[Death Note]], which was directed by [[Adam Wingard]] and starred [[Nat Wolff]], as the film's lead. Their third project will be ''Detective Pikachu'', starring [[Justice Smith]] and [[Ryan Reynolds]].

Viz also has many partnerships with various authors and celebrities, perhaps the most famous being the cosplay film that debuted in the 2013 Tokyo Anime Festival with Kirata Uchiha, played by JadexRoyal. Winning multiple awards for the board including Masashi Kishimoto. Others include Full Moon, and Last Quarter.

In November 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Bertschy, Zac|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2007-05-07/seiji-horibuchi-chairman-of-viz-media |title=Seiji Horibuchi, Chairman of Viz Media |publisher=Anime News Network |date=November 30, 1999 |accessdate=July 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; New People was officially formed as a sister company for releasing live-action Japanese films as theatrical releases in selected markets called Viz Pictures.  According to Horibuchi, the company will focus on films that focus on the "Japanese 'kawaii (cute) and cool' pop culture."&lt;ref name="ICv2Interview" /&gt; In 2007, the division released seven films to theaters, including ''[[Train Man: Densha Otoko]]'' and ''[[Honey and Clover]]''. DVD releases for all VIZ Pictures films are distributed exclusively by its parent, VIZ Media.&lt;ref name="ICv2Interview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/10739.html |title=Interview With Viz Media's Seiji Horibuchi On Viz Media's Live Action Initiative |publisher=ICv2 |date=2007-06-13 |accessdate=2008-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viz Pictures renamed themselves to New People and no longer shares office space or employees with Viz Media.  Viz Media no longer distributes DVD and Blu-ray releases of their products.

====Entertainment complex====
In August 2009, Viz Pictures (now known as New People and a separate entity from Viz Media) opened a three-story entertainment complex in San Francisco called New People. The center piece of the complex is a 143-seat movie theater that screens anime and Japanese live-action films.  The center also has a cafe, a store selling anime and manga related items, and clothing stores offering Japanese clothing items.&lt;ref name="ICv2Interview2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-02-22/japanese-newspaper-talks-with-viz-founder |title=Japanese Newspaper Talks with Viz Founder Horibuchi |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=2008-02-22 |accessdate=2008-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newpeopleworld.com/ |title=NEW PEOPLE: San Francisco's Japanese Shopping &amp; Entertainment Center |publisher=Newpeopleworld.com |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2012-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Animerica''====
{{Main|Animerica}}

''Animerica'' is a quarterly anime and manga [[digest size|digest]] that initially started as a monthly [[magazine]] featuring reviews of [[anime]] and [[manga]] titles, as well as related works. After a preview issue was released in November 1992, the magazine's first issue was released in February 1993 with a March 1993 cover date.&lt;ref name="WatchingReading"&gt;{{cite book |title=Watching Anime, Reading Manga |first=Fred |last=Patten |publisher=[[Stone Bridge Press]] |isbn=1-880656-92-2 |chapter=Fifteen Years of Japanese Animation Fandom |page=43 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine originally featured articles and reviews on manga, anime, and related media, as well as manga preview chapters. In 1998, ''[[Animerica Extra]]'' was launched as a manga anthology that eventually focused specifically on ''[[Shōjo manga|shōjo]]'' titles. It was canceled in 2004.

VIZ changed the magazine's format in April 2005, with the new magazine really being two free publications of the same name. One is advertising-oriented and created specially for distribution at anime and manga conventions while the other is more general in scope and distributed through retail stores. Both versions have fewer and briefer articles and a lower page count.&lt;ref name="AnimericaFormat"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2005-04-12/animerica-to-change-format |title=Animerica to Change Format |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=2005-04-12 |accessdate=2008-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The last monthly issue of the original format ''Animerica'' had a cover date of June 2005 (Volume 13, No. 6).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2005-02-17/animerica-to-radically-change-distribution |title=Animerica to Radically Change Distribution |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=2005-02-17 |accessdate=2008-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Animurica'' was one of the first professional anime and manga magazines released in the United States, and one of the most popular in the 1990s. In 2004, it had a circulation of 45,000 readers, but low sales and high competition from ''[[Newtype USA]]'' resulted in the essential cancellation of the original magazine and its reformatting as a free digest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2005-01-26/8 |title=2004 Year in Review: Anime Magazines |first=Mikhail |last=Koulikov |date=2005-01-26 |accessdate=2008-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Game On! USA''====
{{Expand section|date=August 2008}}
''Game On! USA'' was a monthly magazine that focused primarily on Japanese-developed video games, with an emphasis on the import scene. It served as the American counterpart to Shogakukan's ''Game On!'' magazine. It was published in May 1996 and ran for 7 monthly issues before being discontinued that same year in November. The magazine had news and reviews and other articles about classic fighting games like ''[[Street Fighter]]'', ''[[Samurai Shodown]]'' and ''[[Virtua Fighter (arcade game)|Virtua Fighter]]''. Two video game-based manga series, ''[[Cammy|Super Street Fighter II: Cammy]]'' by [[Masahiko Nakahira]], and ''[[Samurai Shodown]]'' by Kyoichi Nanatsuki and Yuki Miyoshi, were serialized in the magazine. A one shot story based on ''[[Battle Arena Toshinden]]'', illustrated by the game's character designer [[Tsukasa Kotobuki]] was published in the magazine as well.

====''Manga Vizion''====
{{Expand section|date=August 2008}}

It ran for four years until it was canceled in 1999.

====''Pulp''====
'''''Pulp''''' was a monthly manga anthology introduced by Viz in 1997. The magazine featured more mature titles, marketed at adults rather than teenage readers. Some of titles serialized in the magazine included: ''[[Uzumaki]]'', ''[[Banana Fish]]'', and ''[[Dance Till Tomorrow]]''. The magazine was canceled in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618231219/http://www.viz.com/news/newsroom/2002/04_pulpcancelled.php|archivedate=June 18, 2010|url=http://www.viz.com/news/newsroom/2002/04_pulpcancelled.php|title=2002 PRESS RELEASES: VIZ DETAILS CANCELLATION OF PULP: THE MANGA MAGAZINE|date=April 29, 2002|accessdate=November 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Shonen Jump''====
{{Main|Shonen Jump (magazine)}}
''Shonen Jump'' is a [[shōnen manga|shōnen]] [[manga]] [[anthology]] that debuted in November 2002, with a January 2003 cover date. Based on the popular Japanese anthology ''[[Weekly Shōnen Jump]]'', published by [[Shueisha]], ''Shonen Jump'' is retooled for English readers and the American audience and is published monthly, instead of weekly. It features serialized chapters from seven manga series, and articles on Japanese language and culture, as well as manga, anime, video games, and figurines. In conjunction with the magazine, Viz launched new imprints for releasing media related to the series presented in the magazine, and other shōnen works. This includes two new manga imprints, an [[anime]] DVD imprint, a fiction line for releasing [[light novel]]s, a label for fan and data books, and a label for the release of art books.

Prior to the magazine's launch, Viz launched an extensive marketing campaign to promote the magazine and help it succeed where other manga anthologies in North America have failed.&lt;ref name="IC Launch"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/1494.html |title=Viz and Shueisha To Launch Mass Market Boys Magazine in US |publisher=ICv2 |date=June 10, 2002 |accessdate=June 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shueisha purchased an equity interest in Viz to help fund the venture,&lt;ref name="IC Equity"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/1679.html |title=Shueisha Buys Equity Interest in Viz |publisher=ICv2 |date=August 2, 2002 |accessdate=July 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cartoon Network]], [[Suncoast Motion Picture Company|Suncoast]], and [[Diamond Comic Distributors|Diamond Distributors]] became promotional partners in the magazine.&lt;ref name="IC Launch"/&gt; The first issue required three printings to meet demand, with over 300,000 copies sold.

====Haikasoru====
In January 2009, Viz Media announced plans to launch a Japanese [[science fiction]] novel line called Haikasoru.

The '''Waldorf Statement''' was a two-page press release issued on December 3, 1947, by [[Eric Johnston]], president of the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], following a closed-door meeting by forty-eight [[motion picture]] company executives at [[New York City|New York City's]] [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]]. The Statement was a response to the [[contempt of Congress]] charges against the so-called "[[Hollywood blacklist#The Hollywood Ten|Hollywood Ten]]".

The names of the forty-eight men who attended the meeting at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel Waldorf were printed in the ''Motion Picture Herald'' and ''[[Variety (magazine)|Daily Variety]]'', the film industry's primary trade publications. The principal participants who formulated the Waldorf Statement included:
*[[Louis B. Mayer]]:  [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]
*[[Harry Cohn]]:  [[Columbia Pictures]]
*[[Spyros Skouras]]:  [[20th Century Fox]]
*[[Nicholas Schenck]]:  [[Loews Theatres]] 
*[[Barney Balaban]]:  [[Paramount Pictures]]
*[[Samuel Goldwyn]]:  [[Samuel Goldwyn |Samuel Goldwyn Company]]
*[[Albert Warner]]:  [[Warner Bros.]]
*[[William Goetz]]:  [[Universal Studios|Universal-International]] 
*[[Eric Johnston]]:  [[Association of Motion Picture Producers]] and [[Motion Picture Association of America]]
*[[Mendel Silberberg]]:  [[lawyer]] for [[Association of Motion Picture Producers]] 
*[[James F. Byrnes]]:  former [[United States Secretary of State]]
*[[Dore Schary]]:  [[RKO Pictures]]


'''The Waldorf Statement:'''

"Members of the Association of Motion Picture Producers deplore the action of the 10 Hollywood men who have been cited for contempt by the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. We do not desire to prejudge their legal rights, but their actions have been a disservice to their employers and have impaired their usefulness to the industry.

We will forthwith discharge or suspend without compensation those in our employ, and we will not re-employ any of the 10 until such time as he is acquitted or has purged himself of contempt and declares under oath that he is not a [[Communist]].

On the broader issue of alleged subversive and disloyal elements in Hollywood, our members are likewise prepared to take positive action.

We will not knowingly employ a Communist or a member of any party or group which advocates the overthrow of the government of the [[United States]] by force or by any illegal or unconstitutional methods.

In pursuing this policy, we are not going to be swayed by hysteria or intimidation from any source. We are frank to recognize that such a policy involves danger and risks. There is the danger of hurting innocent people. There is the risk of creating an atmosphere of fear. Creative work at its best cannot be carried on in an atmosphere of fear. We will guard against this danger, this risk, this fear.

To this end we will invite the Hollywood talent guilds to work with us to eliminate any subversives: to protect the innocent; and to safeguard free speech and a free screen wherever threatened.

The absence of a national policy, established by Congress, with respect to the employment of Communists in private industry makes our task difficult. Ours is a nation of laws. We request Congress to enact legislation to assist American industry to rid itself of subversive, disloyal elements.

Nothing subversive or un-American has appeared on the screen, nor can any number of Hollywood investigations obscure the patriotic services of the 30,000 loyal Americans employed in Hollywood who have given our government invaluable aid to war and peace."

'''William Phileppus Ragsdale'''{{#tag:ref|He was commonly called '''Bill Ragsdale''' or by his [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiianized]] name '''Pila''' or '''Bila'''. His name was also given as Bila Auwana.{{sfn|Ke Alakai o Hawaii|1888}}|group=note}} ({{circa|1837}} – November 24, 1877) was a lawyer, newspaper editor, and translator of the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] and popular figure known famously for being ''luna'' or superintendent of the [[leper colony]] of [[Kalaupapa, Hawaii|Kalaupapa]]. Elements of his life story influenced [[Mark Twain]]'s 1889 novel ''[[A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court]]''.{{sfn|Tayman|2010|pages=100–102}}

==Early life and career==
Ragsdale was born in 1837, a ''[[Hapa|hapa-haole]]'' or half-[[Native Hawaiians|Hawaiian]], half-Caucasian. His father Alexander Ragsdale was an American plantation owner originally from [[Virginia]] who had settled in Hawaii in 1817 and married Kahawaluokalani (Kahawalu), a minor Hawaiian chiefess and a descendant of King [[Kekaulike]] of [[Maui]] and his wife Kahawalu. His siblings were Edward Alexander Ragsdale (1839–1863) and Annie Green Ragsdale Dowsett (1842–1891), who married James Isaac Dowsett.{{sfn|Tayman|2010|pages=101, 343}}{{sfn|Ragsdales of America|1992|page=91}} He was considered a distant relative or cousin of [[Queen Emma of Hawaii|Queen Emma]].{{sfn|Krout|1900|pages=159–160}}

From 1861 to 1865, Ragsdale served as the first editor of ''Ka Nupepa Kūʻokoʻa'' ("The Independent Newspaper") for publisher [[Henry Martyn Whitney]].{{sfn|Kanepuu|1878}} After four years, he was replaced by missionary descendant [[Luther Halsey Gulick, Sr.]] in 1865. His [[Roman Catholic]] faith was a probable reason why he was replaced, since the Hawaiian [[Congregationalists]] wished to have a newspaper more favorable to them.{{sfn|Putney|2003|page=72}} In 1866, Ragsdale was working as a government translator and interpreter for the [[Legislature of the Kingdom of Hawaii|Hawaiian legislature]].{{sfn|Tayman|2010|pages=100–102}} American writer [[Mark Twain]] visited the island kingdom at the time and described the legislative session and Ragsdale'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Bill Ragsdale stands up in front of the Speaker's pulpit, with his back against it, and fastens his quick black eye upon any member who rises, lets him say half a dozen sentences and then interrupts him, and repeats his speech in a loud, rapid voice, turning every Kanaka speech into English and every English speech into Kanaka, with a readiness and felicity of language that are remarkable – waits for another installment of talk from the member's lips and goes on with his translation as before. His tongue is in constant motion from 11 in the forenoon till four in the afternoon, and why it does not wear out is the affair of Providence, not mine. There is a spice of deviltry in the fellow's nature and it crops out every now and then when he is translating the speeches of slow old Kanakas who do not understand English. Without departing from the spirit of a member's remarks, he will, with apparent unconsciousness, drop in a little voluntary contribution occasionally in the way of a word or two that will make the gravest speech utterly ridiculous. He is careful not to venture upon such experiments, though, with the remarks of persons able to detect him. I noticed when he translated for His Excellency [[Kalākaua|David Kalakaua]], who is an accomplished English scholar, he asked, "Did I translate you correctly, your Excellency?" or something to that effect. The rascal.{{sfn|Twain|Day|1975|pages=110–111}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Superintendent of Kalaupapa==
[[File:Jonathan Napela, 1869, photograph taken by Charles R. Savage.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Ragsdale replaced [[Jonatana Napela]] as superintendent of Kalaupapa.]]
In early 1873, Ragsdale was practicing law in [[Hilo]] when he contracted [[leprosy]]. Working late one night, he accidentally knocked over an oil lamp and discovered that he felt no pain in his hands when he caught it before it fell. After the realization, Ragsdale contemplated his choices for a few months, then surrendered himself to the local authority in hope that others would be encouraged to do the same. He was sent to Kalihi Hospital in Honolulu where he was officially diagnosed with leprosy, and sent to the leper settlement at [[Kalaupapa, Hawaii|Kalaupapa]], on the island of [[Molokai]].{{sfn|Tayman|2010|pages=100–102}}{{sfn|Bird|1875|pages=364–365}} Ragsdale arrived at Kalaupapa on June 29, 1873.{{sfn|Tayman|2010|pages=100–102}}

Upon his arrival in the settlement, he worked as a translator and wrote letters to the government in Honolulu and the Board of Health complaining about the negligence of the incumbent ''luna'' (superintendent) [[Jonatana Napela]] in enforcing the Board's demands for rigid segregation of lepers and non-lepers in the settlement. He served as a mediator between the Board and the inmates, and assisted in improving the discipline and economy of the settlement. These actions gained him favors back in Honolulu. In October, 1873, Napela was discharged by the Board, and Ragsdale was promoted to the position of ''luna'' of Kalaupapa.{{sfn|Moblo|1999|pages=36–39}} He was referred to as "Governor", and later posthumous accounts called him "King of the Lepers".{{sfn|Tayman|2010|pages=104, 113}}

Ragsdale's restrictive policies and the limited resources provided by the Hawaiian government angered many of the patients. [[Peter Kaeo|Peter Kaʻeo]], a high-born chief and patient of the settlement, wrote that "since [Ragsdale] has been Luna he has made more Enemyes and less friends".{{sfn|Moblo|1999|pages=36–39}}{{sfn|Kaeo|Queen Emma|1976|page=156}} In Honolulu, the government and press were much more supportive of his policies, with ''The Pacific Commercial Advertiser'' stating that "Ragsdale guides and regulates his little principality in most matters of government, quite as absolutely and undisputedly as the captain of a ship whose word is law".{{sfn|Moblo|1999|page=41}} Except for a few confrontations with disgruntled patients, Ragsdale's tenure as ''luna'' remained relatively peaceful until his final illness.{{sfn|Moblo|1999|pages=41–43}}

==Death and legacy==
In the fall of 1877, Ragsdale's condition worsened, and he died on November 24, 1877.{{sfn|Tayman|2010|pages=113–114}} Ragsdale was buried in an unmarked grave in the cemetery grounds of Saint Philomena Catholic Church, founded by Father Damien.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/KALA.NPS/photos/a.520968264623350.1073741827.111307082256139/1125824734137697/?type=3&amp;theater Kalaupapa National Historical Park]&lt;/ref&gt; He was mourned at home and abroad, with newspapers in Hawaii and the United States reporting on his death. Even ''[[The New York Times]]'' ran a story on the death of the "King of the Lepers".{{sfn|The New York Times|1878}}{{sfn|Tayman|2010|page=113}} His obituary in Honoulu's ''The Pacific Commercial Advertiser'' noted: 
{{quote|The Board of Health,—indeed the Hawaiian government,—has sustained a severe loss in the demise of Ragsdale, who ably and conscientiously governed the leper colony for several years past. We had occasion to note this fact on our visit to Kalawao some three years since. Who will supply his place? is the anxious inquiry of all who take an interest in these matters. Who among the unfortunates there has the ability, the industry, the energy, the intelligence, and love of country displayed by William P. Ragsdale?{{sfn|The Pacific Commercial Advertiser|1877}}}}

[[Father Damien]] (who had been at Kalaupapa as long as Ragsdale) was chosen briefly to replace him, but his unpopularity with the Protestant patients led to his being replaced by [[William Keolaloa Sumner]], who had served as an assistant under Ragsdale.{{sfn|Moblo|1999|pages=42–46}} 

His friend Mark Twain later returned to writing a fictional story based on Ragsdale's life which was never finished, although elements of the story were incorporated into Twain's ''[[A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court]]''.{{sfn|Tayman|2010|pages=113–114}}

'''Women of Honor''' is a term used by [[Ring of Honor]] (ROH) to refer to its [[Women's professional wrestling|female talent]]. The term is applied universally to [[professional wrestling|wrestlers]], backstage interviewers, and [[manager (professional wrestling)|managers/valets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rohwrestling.com/news/view-future-women-honor |title=A View of the Future with the Women of Honor |publisher=ROH Wrestling |date= |accessdate=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rohwrestling.com/product/women-honor-2-disc-set |title=The Women of Honor (2 Disc Set) |publisher=ROH Wrestling |date= |accessdate=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2015/0730/598853/ring-of-honor-adopting-women-division/ |title=Ring Of Honor Adopting Women's Division? |website=WrestlingInc.com |date=2015-07-30 |accessdate=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wrestlingnews.co/major-update-on-ring-of-honor-creating-a-womens-division/ |title=Major update on Ring of Honor creating a women’s division - Wrestling News |website=Wrestlingnews.co |date=2015-08-06 |accessdate=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Promotion==
ROH had its first women's match on June 22, 2002 at its ''Road to the Title'' show. It saw [[Sumie Sakai]] defeat Simply Luscious. Women's wrestling in ROH had been sporadic since then. ROH featured female stars like [[Sara Del Rey]], [[Daizee Haze]], and others on shows, even releasing a DVD featuring Del Rey, Haze, [[Amazing Kong]], [[Mickie James]], [[MsChif]], [[Lacey (wrestler)|Lacey]], and others. Some of these matches were featured on ROH's television program on [[HDNet]] and, later, on its syndicated show, but ROH did not consistently brand women's matches as Women of Honor until 2015.

The popularity of [[Women's professional wrestling|women]] in Ring of Honor has resulted in Ring of Honor taping a pilot for a standalone Women of Honor program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/44io9m/roh_taping_a_women_of_honor_pilot_at_tonights/|title=ROH taping a Women Of Honor pilot at tonight's tapings according to MLW|website=[[Reddit]]|date=February 6, 2016|accessdate=June 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ring of Honor has also made numerous Women of Honor branded merchandise available for purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rohwrestling.com/catalog/apparel/women-honor|title=Women Of Honor apparel|website=ROH Wrestling|date=June 22, 2016|accessdate=June 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pilot aired as a Women of Honor-branded television special the weekend of June 25, 2016 and its success led to a Women of Honor taping that is available on DVD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rohwrestling.com/ippv/my-ppv/7816-women-honor-baltimore-md-vod|title= 7/8/16 Women Of Honor - Baltimore, MD (VOD)|website=ROH Wrestling|date=July 9, 2016|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, Ring of Honor regularly airs and promotes Women of Honor matches on their [[YouTube]], [[Facebook]], and [[Twitter]] platforms. As of June 2018, the only two videos to receive 3 million or more views on Ring of Honor's YouTube page are Women of Honor matches, both featuring regular Women of Honor competitor, "The Gatekeeper" [[Kelly Klein]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/ringofhonor/videos?view=0&amp;shelf_id=5&amp;sort=p|title=Popular Uploads|website=[[YouTube]]|date=December 6, 2016|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matches are called and presented by [[Ian Riccaboni]].  He has been joined by [[Taeler Hendrix]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRbIb-NY_F0&amp;t=1s|title=Women of Honor Wed - KELLY KLEIN vs MARY DOBSON #WoHWed (5/8/16 Chicago)|website=[[YouTube]]|date=June 1, 2016|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mandy Leon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cekJAhsE7xA&amp;t=336s|title=TAELER HENDRIX vs SUMIE SAKAI from Lowell, MA 10-1-16|website=[[YouTube]]|date=October 12, 2016|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Veda Scott]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2M21Ro5KE18&amp;list=PL53kKJBMWATcFGQFDJeUHiV_hWzHb6TJw&amp;index=6|title=#WOHWed - Taeler Hendrix &amp; Jessicka Havok vs. Mandy Leon &amp; Deonna Purrazzo|website=[[YouTube]]|date=October 5, 2016|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Matt Taven]] and [[B.J.

In February 2017, ROH partnered with Japanese promotion [[World Wonder Ring Stardom]] for a Women of Honor tryout camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rohwrestling.com/news/ring-honor-conducting-first-ever-women-honor-tryout-camp | title = Ring of Honor Conducting the First Ever Women of Honor Tryout Camp | date=February 16, 2017 | accessdate=February 16, 2017 | work=[[Ring of Honor]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
