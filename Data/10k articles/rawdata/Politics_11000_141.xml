'''Sheikh Azahari bin Sheikh Mahmud''' (3 September 1928 – 20 April 2002), better known as '''A.M. Azahari''', was a [[Brunei]] politician turned rebel. 

Born of mixed Arab-Malay heritage in [[Labuan Territory|Labuan]], he was educated in [[Java]] and later fought against the Dutch there. He was the leader of the [[Brunei People's Party]] which sought to reduce the power of [[Omar Ali Saifuddin III|Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin III]] to a constitutional monarch during the [[Brunei Revolt]] in 1962.

Azahari's party won all 16 elected seats in the 33-member legislative council and as a [[Left-wing politics|left-leaning]] politician, Azahari strongly objected to the Sultan's idea for Brunei's membership in the [[Federation of Malaysia]], along with [[Crown Colony of North Borneo|British North Borneo]] (which was later renamed to [[Sabah]]), [[Crown Colony of North Borneo|Sarawak]] and [[Singapore]].

The idea of the [[North Borneo Federation|North Kalimantan]] was originally proposed by Azahari, who had forged links with [[Sukarno]]'s nationalist movement, together with [[Ahmad Zaidi Adruce]], in [[Java]] in the 1940s. The idea supported and propagated the unification of all Borneo territories under British rule to form an independent leftist North Kalimantan state. 

Azahari personally favoured Brunei's independence and merging with [[Crown Colony of North Borneo|British North Borneo]] and [[Crown Colony of Sarawak|Sarawak]] to form the federation with the [[Sultan of Brunei]] as the constitutional monarch.

However, the [[Brunei People’s Party]] was in favour of joining Malaysia on the condition it was as the unified three territories of northern Borneo with their own Sultan, and hence was strong enough to resist domination by Malaya, Singapore, Malay administrators or Chinese merchants.&lt;ref&gt;Pocock p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

The North Kalimantan (or Kalimantan Utara) proposal was seen as a post-[[decolonisation]] alternative by local opposition against the Malaysia plan. Local opposition throughout the Borneo territories was primarily based on economic, political, historical and cultural differences between the Borneo states and Malaya, as well as the refusal to be subjected under peninsular political domination.

During the [[Brunei Revolt]], Azahari was in [[Manila]] and managed to avoid capture by [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Commonwealth]] forces that help quell the revolt. He was even involved in the [[Limbang raid]].

==Life in exile and death==
After his defeat, Azahari fled to [[Jakarta]] where he was granted asylum by President [[Sukarno]] in 1963 and lived in Bogor, West Java. A. M. Azahari later died in 2002 in Bogor, Indonesia.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} He was 73.

He is survived by a wife and more than 10 children. Azahari was the strong voice against the proposal by then Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra to merge Malaya, Sabah, Sarawak and Brunei to form Malaysia. 

Instead, Azahari, who led BPP from the time it was formed in 1956 to when the party was disbanded in 1962, proposed the formation of a unified state consisting of Brunei, Sarawak and North Borneo.

'''CasaPound Italy''' ({{lang-it|CasaPound Italia}}, CPI; "House of [[Ezra Pound|Pound]]") is a [[Neo-fascism|neo-fascist]] [[List of political parties in Italy|political party in Italy]] born as a political movement arising from the [[squatting]] of a state-owned building in the neighbourhood of [[Esquilino]] in [[Rome]] on 26 December 2003.  

Subsequently, the phenomenon spread with other instances of squatting, demonstrations, and various initiatives, becoming a [[political movement]]. 

In June 2008, CasaPound therefore constituted an "association of social promotion" and assumed the current name '''CasaPound Italy – CPI'''; the party's symbol is the "Arrowed Turtle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.casapounditalia.org/p/il-simbolo.html?m=1|title=Il Simbolo|website=www.casapounditalia.org|accessdate=20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first illegal occupation made using the name CasaPound was on 26 December 2003 in Rome, by a group of young people referring to the ONC/OSA area (acronym for "Non-Compliant Occupations and Occupations with a Housing Purpose"), and coming from previous experience of CasaMontag at the gates of Rome. The building, a former government building in via Napoleone III, later became the national headquarters of the movement and the association.  In 2010, 23 families and a total of 82 people lived in CasaPound.&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} Mario Bernardi Guardi, [http://www.iltempo.it/2010/10/22/1211007-mario_bernardi_guardi.shtml?refresh_ce "Sono fascisti i ragazzi di Casa Pound e del Blocco Studentesco? È da qualche anno che politici, giornalisti, sociologi si pongono la domanda ed è da qualche anno che non riescono a dare e a darsi una risposta convincente,"] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120804135310/http://www.iltempo.it/2010/10/22/1211007-mario_bernardi_guardi.shtml?refresh_ce# |date=2012-08-04 }} Il Tempo (22/10/2010). Retrieved 14-12-2013.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Previously, CasaPound was associated with [[Tricolour Flame]] until 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.casapounditalia.org/p/la-storia.html|title=CasaPound Italia - La storia|language=it|access-date=2017-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; but now has its own movement, CasaPound Italy, extending all over Italy with many social centres. While CPI does not recognize the classic definitions of right and left,&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.ideodromocasapound.org/?p=674 "Manifesto dell’Estremocentroalto"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531102414/http://www.ideodromocasapound.org/?p=674# |date=2013-05-31 }} (18 October 2011). Retrieved 14-12-2013.&lt;/ref&gt; it is commonly placed in the view of the political groups and movements of the Italian [[Radical right (Europe)|radical right]]. Casapound is generally self-defined by its followers [[Third Position]], however.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ilgiornale.it/news/basta-destra-e-sinistra-meglio-etica-epica-ed-estetica.html|title=&amp;quot;Basta con destra e sinistra Meglio etica, epica ed estetica&amp;quot;|work=ilGiornale.it|access-date=2018-03-03|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 it was estimated that CasaPound Italy had 5,000 members, while in 2017 they reached 6,000.&lt;ref name="Kington-guardian-06-11-2011"&gt;Tom Kington, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/06/italy-fascists-true-mussolini-ideology "Italy's fascists stay true to Mussolini's ideology],"[[The Guardian]] (6 November 2011). Retrieved 14-12-2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 November 2017, Simone Di Stefano was elected secretary and Prime Minister candidate for the [[Italian general election, 2018|2018 general election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.casapounditalia.org/2017/11/elezioni-di-stefano-diventa-il.html|title=Elezioni: Di Stefano diventa il segretario di CasaPound e lancia il programma per le politiche|website=www.casapounditalia.org|accessdate=20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ideology ==
One feature of this movement, according to sociologist Emanuele Toscano, is to present a different interpretation of [[fascism]] aimed at overcoming the dichotomy of right-left.&lt;ref&gt;Emanuele Toscano &amp; Daniele Di Nunzio [http://isa2010.aimit.se/146470/Paper "Can We Still Speak about Extreme Right Movements? Casapound in Italy between Community and Subjectivation Drives,"] XVII World Congress of Sociology (14 July 2010). Retrieved 14-12-2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The political position of CasaPound is based on the fascist [[Third Position]], definited as "extreme-upper-centre" by the movement itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|URL=http://www.ilgiornale.it/news/basta-destra-e-sinistra-meglio-etica-epica-ed-estetica.html|title="Basta con destra e sinistra Meglio etica, epica ed estetica"|newspaper=[[il Giornale]]|date=April 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name, inspired by the poet [[Ezra Pound]], refers to his ''[[The Cantos|Cantos]]'' against usury, criticisms of the economic positions of both [[capitalism]] and [[Marxism]], and his membership of the [[Italian Social Republic]]. It also gives particular attention to the [[Congress of Verona (1943)|Manifesto of Verona]], the [[Labour Charter of 1927]] and social legislation of fascism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|URL=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2017/06/21/saluti-romani-e-un-tocco-di-glamour-ecco-la-casapound10.html|title=Saluti romani e un tocco di glamour ecco la nuova strategia di CasaPound|author=Paolo Berizzi|newspaper=[[la Repubblica]]|date=June 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been collaboration with the [[identitarian movement]] which propagates a [[White people|white]], [[Christianity|Christian]] Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Eleonora Vio, [http://www.dagospia.com/rubrica-3/politica/arrivano-nazi-pop-austria-movimento-ultradestra-identitare-129453.htm  "Arrivano i Nazi-Pop"], dagospia.com, 07/26/2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The movement also claim the legacy of far-left figures, like [[Che Guevara]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|URL=https://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2017/10/17/casapound-e-la-volta-di-porro-scontro-su-che-guevara-per-voi-e-un-modello-ma-a-me-ha-rotto-le-palle-tutta-linfanzia/3918323/|title=Casapound, è la volta di Porro.

[[File:Blocco Studentesco.png|thumb|right|150px|Logo of ''Blocco Studentesco'', the youth wing of CasaPound.]]
In 2006, the movement that arose around the first community centre was endowed with its student organization, under the name Students' Block ({{lang-it|Blocco Studentesco}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libcom.org/library/casa-pound-new-radical-right-italy|title=Casa Pound and the new radical right in Italy|website=libcom.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Francesco Polacchi is the General Secretary of Students' Block.

==International meetings==
Over the years the leaders of CasaPound Italy have been invited to explain its “political model” in many of the major European capitals ([[Paris]], [[Madrid]], [[London]], [[Lisbon]], [[Brussels]])&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.agenziastampaitalia.it/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4975:casapound-italia-in-1500-alla-festa-nazionale&amp;catid=4:politica-nazionale&amp;Itemid=34 "CasaPound Italia: in 1.500 alla festa nazionale"] (21 September 2011).

==Symbolic figures==

The party's choice of American poet [[Ezra Pound]] as a symbol of the movement has caused controversy with his daughter, [[Mary de Rachewiltz]], who claimed it distorts the meaning of Pound's work and represents a "misappropriation" of his image,&lt;ref&gt;Tom Kingtom, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/14/ezra-pound-daughter-fascism "Ezra Pound's daughter fights to wrest the renegade poet's legacy from fascists,"] The Observer (14 January 2012).

[[File:Deforestation in Borneo.jpg|thumb|300px|upright|Trees being felled in [[Kalimantan]], the Indonesian part of Borneo, in 2013, to make way for a new coal mining project]]
Deforestation in Borneo has taken place on an industrial scale since the 1960s. [[Borneo]], the [[List of islands by area|third largest island]] in the world, divided between [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Brunei]], was once covered by dense [[tropical rainforest|tropical]] and [[subtropical rainforest]]s.

In the 1980s and 1990s the forests of Borneo were leveled at a rate unprecedented in human history, burned, logged and cleared, and commonly replaced with agriculture. The [[deforestation]] continued through the 2000s at a slower pace, alongside the expansion of [[oil palm|palm oil]] plantations. Half of the annual global [[tropical timber]] procurement is from Borneo. Palm oil plantations are rapidly encroaching on the last remnants of primary rainforest. Much of the forest clearance is illegal.

The [[World Wildlife Fund]] divides Borneo into a number of distinct [[List of ecoregions (WWF)|ecoregions]] including the [[Borneo lowland rain forests]] which cover most of the island, with an area of {{convert|427500|km2}}, the [[Borneo peat swamp forests]], the ''[[Kerangas]]'' or Sundaland heath forests, the Southwest Borneo freshwater swamp forests, and the [[Sunda Shelf]] [[mangroves]]. The [[Borneo montane rain forests|Borneo mountain rainforests]] lie in the central highlands of the island, above the {{convert|1000|m}} elevation. These areas represent habitat for many [[endangered species]]; for example, [[Bornean orangutan|orangutans]], [[Borneo elephant|elephants]] and rare [[Endemic (ecology)|endemics]] such as the elusive [[Hose's civet]]. The Bornean orangutan has been a [[critically endangered]] species since 2016.

As well as Borneo's importance in [[biodiversity]] conservation and as a [[carbon sink]], the forests have significance for [[water security]] and [[food sovereignty]] for local communities of indigenous peoples.&lt;ref name= "localvalue"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theborneopost.com/2013/11/20/claims-over-mount-sadong-to-be-probed-says-awg-tengah/|title= Claims over Mount Sadong to be probed, says Awg Tengah |publisher= The Borneo Post |date=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Malaysian Borneo==
[[File:Malayasia iko 2002169.jpg|thumb|250px|upright|left|Satellite image of rainforest converted to [[oil palm]] plantations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=40139|title= Deforestation in Malaysian Borneo|year= 2009|publisher= NASA|accessdate=7 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The Malaysian states of [[Sarawak]] and [[Sabah]] ([[East Malaysia]]), in the north, occupy about 26% of the island. The forested area here shrank rapidly due to heavy [[logging]] for the Malaysian plywood industry. Two forestry researchers&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forest.sabah.gov.my/ Sabah Forestry Department]. Forest.sabah.gov.my. Retrieved on 22 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; of [http://www.forest.sabah.gov.my/frc/English/index.html Sepilok Research Centre], Sandakan, Sabah in the early 1980s identified four fast-growing hardwoods and a breakthrough on seed collection and handling of ''[[Acacia mangium]]'' and ''[[Gmelina arborea]]'', fast-growing tropical trees were planted on huge tract of formerly logged and deforested areas primarily in the northern part of Borneo Island.

[[Indigenous peoples]] of Malaysia have been impacted by [[logging]] without their [[free, prior and informed consent]] in their [[ancestral domain|ancestral]] forests. They have used [[Demonstration (people)|peaceful demonstrations]] &lt;ref name= localvalue/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theborneopost.com/2013/11/20/claims-over-mount-sadong-to-be-probed-says-awg-tengah/|title= Claims over Mount Sadong to be probed, says Awg Tengah |publisher= The Borneo Post |date=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and social media [[advocacy]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theborneopost.com/2013/11/20/campaign-to-save-mt-sadong-goes-online/|title= Campaign to save Mt Sadong goes online |publisher= The Borneo Post |date=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; to raise awareness of their [[Indigenous land rights|rights]] to the forest, with some success. Questions about how and why logging licenses were granted without community consent remain unaddressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theborneopost.com/2013/11/21/problem-solved-logging-licence-at-mount-sadong-revoked-assures-manyin/|title=Problem solved, logging licence at Mount Sadong revoked, assures Manyin |publisher= The Borneo Post |date=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rainforest was also greatly destroyed from the forest fires of 1997 to 1998, which were started by the locals to [[slash-and-burn|clear the forests for crops]] and perpetuated by an exceptionally dry [[El Niño]] season during that period. During the great fire, hotspots could be seen on [[Satellite imagery|satellite images]] and the [[haze]] thus created affected the surrounding countries of [[Brunei]], [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Singapore]]. In February 2008, the Malaysian government announced the [[Sarawak Corridor of Renewable Energy]] plan&lt;ref name= score&gt;{{cite web |publisher= RECODA |title= SCORE Plan|accessdate= 14 December 2008 |year= 2008 |url= http://www.sarawakcore.com.my/}}&lt;/ref&gt; to harvest the virgin hinterlands of northern Borneo. Further deforestation and destruction of the biodiversity are anticipated in the wake of logging commissions, hydroelectric dams and other mining of minerals and resources.

==Indonesian Borneo==
[[File:Logging road East Kalimantan 2005.jpg|thumb|250px|Logging road and impacts in East Kalimantan: logged forest on the left, primary forest on the right]]
Approximately 73% of the island is Indonesian territory; the Indonesian name for the island, [[Kalimantan]], is used in English to refer to the Indonesian-controlled territory.

To combat overpopulation in [[Java (island)|Java]], the Indonesian government started a massive transmigration ([[transmigrasi]]) of poor farmers and landless peasants into Borneo in the 1970s and 1980s, to farm the logged areas, albeit with little success as the fertility of the land has been removed with the trees and what soil remains is washed away in tropical downpours.

The [[Mega Rice Project (Kalimantan)|Mega Rice Project]] was initiated in 1996 in the southern sections of Kalimantan. The goal was to turn one million hectares of "unproductive" and sparsely populated [[peat swamp forest]] into [[rice paddies]] in an effort to alleviate Indonesia's growing food shortage. The government made a large investment in constructing irrigation canals and removing trees. The project did not succeed, and was eventually abandoned after causing considerable damage to the environment.

The peat swamp forest in the south of Kalimantan is an unusual ecology that is home to many unique or rare species such as orangutans, as well as to slow-growing but valuable trees. The peat swamp forest is a dual ecosystem, with diverse tropical trees standing on a 10 to 12&amp;nbsp;m layer of [[peat]] - partly decayed and waterlogged plant material – which in turn covers relatively infertile soil. Peat is a major store of carbon.  If broken down and burned it contributes to [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] emissions, considered a source of [[global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110715014349/http://www.orangutantrop.com/research/researchsite/catchment.html Sabangau Forest]. orangutantrop.com&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Satellite image of 2015 Southeast Asian haze - 20150924.jpg|upright=1.2|thumbnail|left|A [[NASA]] satellite image showing the extent of [[2015 Southeast Asian haze]] on 24 September 2015.]]

The water channels, and the roads and railways built for legal forestry, opened up the region to illegal forestry. In the MRP area, forest cover dropped from 64.8% in 1991 to 45.7% in 2000, and clearance has continued since then. It appears that almost all the marketable trees have now been removed from the areas covered by the MRP.

It turned out that the channels drained the peat forests rather than irrigating them.  Where the forests had often flooded up to 2m deep in the rainy season, now their surface is dry at all times of the year. The government has therefore abandoned the MRP, but the drying peat is vulnerable to fires which continue to break out on a massive scale.&lt;ref&gt;Boehm, H-D.V. and Siegert, F. [http://www.crisp.nus.edu.sg/~acrs2001/pdf/126boehm.pdf Ecological Impact of the One Million Hectare Rice Project in Cantral Kalimantan, Indonesia, Using Remote Sensing and GIS]. (PDF) . Retrieved on 22 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

After drainage, fires ravaged the area, destroying remaining forest and wildlife along with new agriculture, filling the air above Borneo and beyond with dense smoke and [[1997 Southeast Asian haze|haze]] and releasing enormous quantities of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into the atmosphere. The destruction had a major negative impact on the livelihoods of people in the area. It caused major smog-related health problems amongst half a million people, who suffered from respiratory problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Pearce | first = Fred | title = Borneo fires may intensify 'Asian brown haze' | journal= New Scientist | date = 12 August 2002| url =https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn2660-borneo-fires-may-intensify-asian-brown-haze.html| accessdate = 11 April 2010|quote=The smog from fires killed "as many as a million people a year from respiratory diseases" according to UNEP director Klaus Toepfer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peat forest destruction is causing [[sulphuric acid]] pollution of the rivers. In the rainy seasons, the canals are discharging acidic water with a high ratio of [[Pyrite|pyritic sulphate]] into rivers up to 150&amp;nbsp;km upstream from the river mouth. This may be a factor contributing to lower fish catches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Effect of sulphuric acid discharge on river water chemistry in peat swamp forests in central Kalimantan, Indonesia |doi=10.1007/s10201-007-0206-4|year=2007|last1=Haraguchi|first1=Akira|journal=Limnology|volume=8|issue=2|pages=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A joint UK-Indonesian study of the timber industry in Indonesia as a whole in 1998 suggested that about 40% of the throughput of timber was illegal, with a value in excess of $365 million.&lt;ref&gt;Indonesia-UK Tropical Forestry Management Programme (1999) Illegal Logging in Indonesia. ITFMP Report No. EC/99/03&lt;/ref&gt; More recent estimates, comparing legal harvesting against known domestic consumption plus exports, suggest that 88% of logging in the country is illegal in some way.&lt;ref&gt;Greenpeace (2003) ''Partners in Crime: A Greenpeace investigation of the links between the UK and Indonesia’s timber barons''. See http://www.saveordelete.com&lt;/ref&gt; Malaysia is the key transit country for illegally logged wood products from Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Investigation Agency and Telepak (2004) ''Profiting from Plunder: How Malaysia Smuggles Endangered Wood''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logging==
[[File:Logging trucks in Sarawak.jpg|right|thumbnail|250px|A logging truck in [[Sarawak]], [[Borneo]].]]
Deforestation in Borneo was historically low due to infertile soils, unfavourable climate, and the presence of disease. Deforestation only began in earnest during the mid-twentieth century. Industrial logging rose in the 1970s as Malaysia depleted its peninsular forests, and former Indonesian strongman President [[Suharto]] distributed large tracts of forest to cement political relationships with army generals. Thus, logging expanded significantly in the 1980s, with logging roads providing access to remote lands for settlers and developers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mongabay.com/borneo.html |title= Deforestation : Forest Loss in Borneo |work= Mongabay : Borneo |accessdate= 14 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Logging in Borneo in the 1980s and 1990s was some of the most intensive the world has ever seen, with 60–240 cubic meters of wood being harvested per hectare versus 23 cubic meters per hectare in the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]]. In Kalimantan for example, some 80% of lowlands went to timber concessions, including virtually all its mangrove forests.  By the late 1980s, it became clear that Indonesia and Malaysia were facing a problem of timber crisis due to over-logging. Demand from timber mills was far-outstripping log production in both Malaysia and Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mongabay.com/borneo.html |title= Logging and Transmigration |work= Mongabay : Borneo |accessdate= 14 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fires==
{{see also|1997 Southeast Asian haze|2015 Southeast Asian haze}}
Most fires in Borneo are set for land-clearing purposes. While the Indonesian government has historically blamed small-scale swidden agriculturalists for fires, [[World Wildlife Fund]] notes that satellite mapping has revealed that commercial development for large-scale land conversion – in particular oil palm plantations – was the largest single cause of the infamous 1997–1998 fires. Today fires are still set annually for land clearing in agricultural areas and degraded forests. When conditions are dry, these fires can easily spread to adjacent forest land and burn out of control. Increasingly, the frequency and intensity of fires is causing political tensions in the region. Neighbouring countries, in particular Malaysia and Singapore, blame Indonesia for failing to control the fires. In turn, Indonesia accuses Malaysian firms of starting many of the fire for land-clearing process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mongabay.com/borneo.html |title= Fires |work= Mongabay : Borneo |accessdate= 14 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a need for a sustainable management of the forest’s resources, in particular the aspect of logging. But in order for that to materialise, there is a need to recognise that protection and conservation of the forest do not solely lie in the hands of Indonesia and/or Malaysia. It is unreasonable to assume that the few highly indebted countries that contain the majority of remaining rain forest should be responsible for single-handedly providing this global public good.&lt;ref&gt;Todaro, M. P., &amp; Smith S. C. (2009). The Environment and Development. In Todaro, M. P., &amp; Smith S. C. (10th Ed) Economic Development (pp. 483–529). Essex: Pearson Education Limited.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a global effort to protect the rainforest which in turn, will then help to solve the development problems Indonesia and Malaysia face with regards to the Borneo rainforest.

==Reforestation==
Recently a [[reforestation]] project in [[East Kalimantan]] has reported some success. The [[Borneo Orangutan Survival|Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation]] (BOS), founded by Dr [[Willie Smits]], bought up nearly 2000 ha of [[Deforestation|deforested]] degraded land in East Kalimantan that had suffered from mechanical logging, drought and severe fires and was covered in alang-alang grass ([[Imperata cylindrica]]).  The intention was to restore the rainforest and provide a safe haven for rehabilitated orangutans while at the same time providing a source of income for local people. The project was given the name [[Samboja Lestari]], which roughly translates as the "everlasting conservation of Samboja". {{coord|1|2|44|S|116|59|15|E|display=inline}} &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orangutans.com.au/Orangutans-Survival-Information/Samboja-Lestari-128959069771931264.aspx BOS Australia website]. Orangutans.com.au. Retrieved on 22 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Reforestation and rehabilitation is the core of the  project, with hundreds of indigenous species planted. By the middle of 2006 more than 740 different tree species had been planted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sambojalodge.com/AboutBOSFoundation/BOSSambojaLestari/ Samboja Lodge website]. Sambojalodge.com.

'''Distributed computing '''is a field of [[computer science]] that studies distributed systems. A ''distributed system'' is a system whose components are located on different [[computer network|networked computers]], which then communicate and coordinate their actions by [[message passing|passing messages]] to one another.&lt;ref name="Coulouris"&gt;{{cite book|last=Coulouris|first=George|author2=Jean Dollimore|author3=Tim Kindberg|author4=Gordon Blair|title=Distributed Systems: Concepts and Design (5th Edition)|publisher = Addison-Wesley|year=2011|location=Boston|isbn=0-132-14301-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The components interact with one another in order to achieve a common goal. Three significant characteristics of distributed systems are: concurrency of components, [[clock synchronization|lack of a global clock]], and independent failure of components.&lt;ref name="Coulouris" /&gt; Examples of distributed systems vary from [[service-oriented architecture|SOA-based systems]] to [[massively multiplayer online game]]s to [[peer-to-peer|peer-to-peer applications]].

A [[computer program]] that runs within a distributed system is called a '''distributed program''' (and distributed programming is the process of writing such programs).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Andrews|2000}}. {{harvtxt|Dolev|2000}}. {{harvtxt|Ghosh|2007}}, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many different types of implementations for the message passing mechanism, including pure HTTP, [[remote procedure call|RPC-like]] connectors and [[message-oriented middleware|message queues]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Magnoni|first=L.|date=2015|title=Modern Messaging for Distributed Sytems|url=http://stacks.iop.org/1742-6596/608/i=1/a=012038|journal=Journal of Physics: Conference Series|language=en|volume=608|issue=1|pages=012038|doi=10.1088/1742-6596/608/1/012038|issn=1742-6596}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

''Distributed computing'' also refers to the use of distributed systems to solve computational problems. In ''distributed computing'', a problem is divided into many tasks, each of which is solved by one or more computers,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Godfrey|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which communicate with each other via message passing.&lt;ref name="Andrews 2000"&gt;{{harvtxt|Andrews|2000}}, p. 291–292. {{harvtxt|Dolev|2000}}, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
The word ''parallel'' in terms such as "parallel system", "distributed programming", and "[[distributed algorithm]]" originally referred to computer networks where individual computers were physically distributed within some geographical area.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lynch|1996}}, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The terms are nowadays used in a much wider sense, even referring to autonomous [[Process (computing)|processes]] that run on the same physical computer and interact with each other by message passing.&lt;ref name="Andrews 2000"/&gt;

While there is no single definition of a distributed system,&lt;ref name="harvtxt|Ghosh|2007"&gt;{{harvtxt|Ghosh|2007}}, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; the following defining properties are commonly used:
* There are several autonomous computational entities (''computers'' or ''[[Node (networking)|nodes]]''), each of which has its own local [[Memory (computers)|memory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Andrews|2000}}, pp. 8–9, 291. {{harvtxt|Dolev|2000}}, p. 5. {{harvtxt|Ghosh|2007}}, p. 3. {{harvtxt|Lynch|1996}}, p. xix, 1. {{harvtxt|Peleg|2000}}, p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The entities communicate with each other by [[message passing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Andrews|2000}}, p. 291. {{harvtxt|Ghosh|2007}}, p. 3. {{harvtxt|Peleg|2000}}, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

A distributed system may have a common goal, such as solving a large computational problem;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ghosh|2007}}, p. 3–4. {{harvtxt|Peleg|2000}}, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; the user then perceives the collection of autonomous processors as a unit. Alternatively, each computer may have its own user with individual needs, and the purpose of the distributed system is to coordinate the use of shared resources or provide communication services to the users.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ghosh|2007}}, p. 4. {{harvtxt|Peleg|2000}}, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other typical properties of distributed systems include the following:
* The system has to [[Fault tolerance|tolerate failures]] in individual computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ghosh|2007}}, p. 4, 8. {{harvtxt|Lynch|1996}}, p. 2–3. {{harvtxt|Peleg|2000}}, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The structure of the system (network topology, network latency, number of computers) is not known in advance, the system may consist of different kinds of computers and network links, and the system may change during the execution of a distributed program.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lynch|1996}}, p. 2. {{harvtxt|Peleg|2000}}, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Each computer has only a limited, incomplete view of the system. Each computer may know only one part of the input.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ghosh|2007}}, p. 7. {{harvtxt|Lynch|1996}}, p. xix, 2. {{harvtxt|Peleg|2000}}, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parallel and distributed computing==
[[File:Distributed-parallel.svg|thumb|right|300px|(a), (b): a distributed system.&lt;br/&gt;(c): a parallel system.]]
Distributed systems are groups of networked computers, which have the same goal for their work.
The terms "[[concurrent computing]]", "[[parallel computing]]", and "distributed computing" have a lot of overlap, and no clear distinction exists between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ghosh|2007}}, p. 10. {{harvtxt|Keidar|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The same system may be characterized both as "parallel" and "distributed"; the processors in a typical distributed system run concurrently in parallel.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lynch|1996}}, p. xix, 1–2. {{harvtxt|Peleg|2000}}, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Parallel computing may be seen as a particular tightly coupled form of distributed computing,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Peleg|2000}}, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; and distributed computing may be seen as a loosely coupled form of parallel computing.&lt;ref name="harvtxt|Ghosh|2007"/&gt; Nevertheless, it is possible to roughly classify concurrent systems as "parallel" or "distributed" using the following criteria:
* In parallel computing, all processors may have access to a [[shared memory architecture|shared memory]] to exchange information between processors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Papadimitriou|1994}}, Chapter 15. {{harvtxt|Keidar|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In distributed computing, each processor has its own private memory ([[distributed memory]]). Information is exchanged by passing messages between the processors.&lt;ref&gt;See references in [[#Introduction|Introduction]].&lt;/ref&gt;
The figure on the right illustrates the difference between distributed and parallel systems. Figure (a) is a schematic view of a typical distributed system; the system is represented as a network topology in which each node is a computer and each line connecting the nodes is a communication link. Figure (b) shows the same distributed system in more detail: each computer has its own local memory, and information can be exchanged only by passing messages from one node to another by using the available communication links. Figure (c) shows a parallel system in which each processor has a direct access to a shared memory.

The situation is further complicated by the traditional uses of the terms parallel and distributed ''algorithm'' that do not quite match the above definitions of parallel and distributed ''systems'' (see [[#Theoretical foundations|below]] for more detailed discussion). Nevertheless, as a rule of thumb, high-performance parallel computation in a shared-memory multiprocessor uses parallel algorithms while the coordination of a large-scale distributed system uses distributed algorithms.&lt;ref name="BetalebParallel16"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~rahul/allfiles/cs6234-16-pds.pdf |format=PDF |title=Parallel and Distributed Algorithms |author=Bentaleb, A.; Yifan, L.; Xin, J. et al. |publisher=National University of Singapore |year=2016 |accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The use of concurrent processes that communicate by message-passing has its roots in [[operating system]] architectures studied in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Andrews|2000}}, p. 348.&lt;/ref&gt; The first widespread distributed systems were [[local-area networks]] such as [[Ethernet]], which was invented in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Andrews|2000}}, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[ARPANET]], the predecessor of the [[Internet]], was introduced in the late 1960s, and ARPANET [[e-mail]] was invented in the early 1970s. E-mail became the most successful application of ARPANET,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Peter|2004}}, [http://www.nethistory.info/History%20of%20the%20Internet/email.html The history of email].&lt;/ref&gt; and it is probably the earliest example of a large-scale [[distributed application]]. In addition to ARPANET, and its successor, the Internet, other early worldwide computer networks included [[Usenet]] and [[FidoNet]] from the 1980s, both of which were used to support distributed discussion systems.&lt;ref name="BanksOnThe12"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1J78hiHKaPoC&amp;pg=PT67 |title=On the Way to the Web: The Secret History of the Internet and its Founders |author=Banks, M. |publisher=Apress |pages=44–5 |year=2012 |isbn=9781430250746}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of distributed computing became its own branch of computer science in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The first conference in the field, [[Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing]] (PODC), dates back to 1982, and its counterpart [[International Symposium on Distributed Computing]] (DISC) was first held in Ottawa in 1985 as the International Workshop on Distributed Algorithms on Graphs.&lt;ref name="TelIntro00"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vlpnS25qAJQC&amp;pg=PA35 |title=Introduction to Distributed Algorithms |author=Tel, G. |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=35–36 |year=2000 |isbn=9780521794831}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architectures==
Various hardware and software architectures are used for distributed computing. At a lower level, it is necessary to interconnect multiple CPUs with some sort of network, regardless of whether that network is printed onto a circuit board or made up of loosely coupled devices and cables. At a higher level, it is necessary to interconnect [[Process (computing)|processes]] running on those CPUs with some sort of [[communication system]].&lt;ref name="OhlídalEvo06"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Evolutionary Design of OAB and AAB Communication Schedules for Interconnection Networks |title=Applications of Evolutionary Computing |author=Ohlídal, M.; Jaroš, J.; Schwarz, J. et al. |editor=Rothlauf, F.; Branke, J.; Cagnoni, S. et al. |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |pages=267–78 |year=2006 |isbn=9783540332374}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Distributed programming typically falls into one of several basic architectures: [[Client–server model|client–server]], [[Three-tier (computing)|three-tier]], [[Multitier architecture|''n''-tier]], or [[peer-to-peer]]; or categories: [[loose coupling]], or [[Computer cluster|tight coupling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Real Time And Distributed Computing Systems |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2950/37ee46ac281590f67435380cebc385ac9749.pdf |issn= 2278-0661 |access-date=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Client–server model|Client–server]]: architectures where smart clients contact the server for data then format and display it to the users. Input at the client is committed back to the server when it represents a permanent change.
* [[Three-tier (computing)|Three-tier]]: architectures that move the client intelligence to a middle tier so that [[Stateless_protocol|stateless]] clients can be used. This simplifies application deployment. Most web applications are three-tier.
* [[Multitier architecture|''n''-tier]]: architectures that refer typically to web applications which further forward their requests to other enterprise services. This type of application is the one most responsible for the success of [[application server]]s.
* [[Peer-to-peer]]: architectures where there are no special machines that provide a service or manage the network resources.&lt;ref name=Vigna20150127&gt;Vigna P, Casey MJ. ''The Age of Cryptocurrency: How Bitcoin and the Blockchain Are Challenging the Global Economic Order'' St. Martin's Press January 27, 2015 {{ISBN|9781250065636}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|227}} Instead all responsibilities are uniformly divided among all machines, known as peers. Peers can serve both as clients and as servers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/663093862|title=Peer-to-peer computing : principles and applications|last=Hieu.|first=Vu, Quang|date=2010|publisher=Springer|others=Lupu, Mihai., Ooi, Beng Chin, 1961-|year=|isbn=9783642035135|location=Heidelberg|pages=16|oclc=663093862}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Another basic aspect of distributed computing architecture is the method of communicating and coordinating work among concurrent processes. Through various message passing protocols, processes may communicate directly with one another, typically in a [[Master-slave (technology)|master/slave]] relationship. Alternatively, a [[Database-centric architecture|"database-centric" architecture]] can enable distributed computing to be done without any form of direct [[inter-process communication]], by utilizing a shared [[database]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |vauthors=Lind P, Alm M |title=A database-centric virtual chemistry system |journal=J Chem Inf Model |volume=46 |issue=3 |pages=1034–9 |year=2006 |pmid=16711722 |doi=10.1021/ci050360b |postscript=. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Reasons for using distributed systems and distributed computing may include:
# The very nature of an application may ''require'' the use of a communication network that connects several computers: for example, data produced in one physical location and required in another location.
# There are many cases in which the use of a single computer would be possible in principle, but the use of a distributed system is ''beneficial'' for practical reasons. For example, it may be more cost-efficient to obtain the desired level of performance by using a [[Cluster (computing)|cluster]] of several low-end computers, in comparison with a single high-end computer. A distributed system can provide more reliability than a non-distributed system, as there is no [[single point of failure]]. Moreover, a distributed system may be easier to expand and manage than a monolithic uniprocessor system.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Elmasri|Navathe|2000}}, Section 24.1.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Models===
Many tasks that we would like to automate by using a computer are of question–answer type: we would like to ask a question and the computer should produce an answer. In [[theoretical computer science]], such tasks are called [[computational problem]]s. Formally, a computational problem consists of ''instances'' together with a ''solution'' for each instance. Instances are questions that we can ask, and solutions are desired answers to these questions.

Theoretical computer science seeks to understand which computational problems can be solved by using a computer ([[Computability theory (computer science)|computability theory]]) and how efficiently ([[computational complexity theory]]). Traditionally, it is said that a problem can be solved by using a computer if we can design an [[algorithm]] that produces a correct solution for any given instance. Such an algorithm can be implemented as a [[computer program]] that runs on a general-purpose computer: the program reads a problem instance from [[Information|input]], performs some computation, and produces the solution as [[output (computing)|output]]. Formalisms such as [[random access machine]]s or [[universal Turing machine]]s can be used as abstract models of a sequential general-purpose computer executing such an algorithm.&lt;ref name="ToomarianNeural92"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CKTsCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA214 |chapter=Neural Networks for Real-Time Robotic Applications |title=Parallel Computation Systems For Robotics: Algorithms And Architectures |author=Toomarian, N.B.; Barhen, J.; Gulati, S. |editor=Fijany, A.; Bejczy, A. |publisher=World Scientific |page=214 |year=1992 |isbn=9789814506175}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SavageModels98"&gt;{{cite book |title=Models of Computation: Exploring the Power of Computing |author=Savage, J.E. |publisher=Addison Wesley |page=209 |year=1998 |isbn=9780201895391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The field of concurrent and distributed computing studies similar questions in the case of either multiple computers, or a computer that executes a network of interacting processes: which computational problems can be solved in such a network and how efficiently? However, it is not at all obvious what is meant by "solving a problem" in the case of a concurrent or distributed system: for example, what is the task of the algorithm designer, and what is the concurrent or distributed equivalent of a sequential general-purpose computer?{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The discussion below focuses on the case of multiple computers, although many of the issues are the same for concurrent processes running on a single computer.

Three viewpoints are commonly used:
; Parallel algorithms in shared-memory model
* All processors have access to a shared memory. The algorithm designer chooses the program executed by each processor.
* One theoretical model is the [[parallel random access machine]]s (PRAM) that are used.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Cormen|Leiserson|Rivest|1990}}, Section 30.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the classical PRAM model assumes synchronous access to the shared memory.
* Shared-memory programs can be extended to distributed systems if the underlying operating system encapsulates the communication between nodes and virtually unifies the memory across all individual systems.
* A model that is closer to the behavior of real-world multiprocessor machines and takes into account the use of machine instructions, such as [[Compare-and-swap]] (CAS), is that of ''asynchronous shared memory''. There is a wide body of work on this model, a summary of which can be found in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Herlihy|Shavit|2008}}, Chapters 2-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lynch|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Parallel algorithms in message-passing model
* The algorithm designer chooses the structure of the network, as well as the program executed by each computer.
* Models such as [[Boolean circuits]] and [[sorting network]]s are used.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Cormen|Leiserson|Rivest|1990}}, Sections 28 and 29.&lt;/ref&gt; A Boolean circuit can be seen as a computer network: each gate is a computer that runs an extremely simple computer program. Similarly, a sorting network can be seen as a computer network: each comparator is a computer.
; Distributed algorithms in message-passing model
* The algorithm designer only chooses the computer program. All computers run the same program. The system must work correctly regardless of the structure of the network.
* A commonly used model is a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] with one [[finite-state machine]] per node.

In the case of distributed algorithms, computational problems are typically related to graphs. Often the graph that describes the structure of the computer network ''is'' the problem instance. This is illustrated in the following example.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===An example===
Consider the computational problem of finding a coloring of a given graph ''G''. Different fields might take the following approaches:
; Centralized algorithms{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}
* The graph ''G'' is encoded as a string, and the string is given as input to a computer. The computer program finds a coloring of the graph, encodes the coloring as a string, and outputs the result.
; Parallel algorithms
* Again, the graph ''G'' is encoded as a string. However, multiple computers can access the same string in parallel. Each computer might focus on one part of the graph and produce a coloring for that part.
* The main focus is on high-performance computation that exploits the processing power of multiple computers in parallel.
; Distributed algorithms
* The graph ''G'' is the structure of the computer network. There is one computer for each node of ''G'' and one communication link for each edge of ''G''. Initially, each computer only knows about its immediate neighbors in the graph ''G''; the computers must exchange messages with each other to discover more about the structure of ''G''. Each computer must produce its own color as output.
* The main focus is on coordinating the operation of an arbitrary distributed system.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

While the field of parallel algorithms has a different focus than the field of distributed algorithms, there is a lot of interaction between the two fields. For example, the [[Cole–Vishkin algorithm]] for graph coloring&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Cole|Vishkin|1986}}. {{harvtxt|Cormen|Leiserson|Rivest|1990}}, Section 30.5.&lt;/ref&gt; was originally presented as a parallel algorithm, but the same technique can also be used directly as a distributed algorithm.

Moreover, a parallel algorithm can be implemented either in a parallel system (using shared memory) or in a distributed system (using message passing).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Andrews|2000}}, p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional boundary between parallel and distributed algorithms (choose a suitable network vs. run in any given network) does not lie in the same place as the boundary between parallel and distributed systems (shared memory vs. message passing).

===Complexity measures===
In parallel algorithms, yet another resource in addition to time and space is the number of computers. Indeed, often there is a trade-off between the running time and the number of computers: the problem can be solved faster if there are more computers running in parallel (see [[speedup]]). If a decision problem can be solved in [[polylogarithmic time]] by using a polynomial number of processors, then the problem is said to be in the class [[NC (complexity)|NC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Arora|Barak|2009}}, Section 6.7. {{harvtxt|Papadimitriou|1994}}, Section 15.3.&lt;/ref&gt; The class NC can be defined equally well by using the PRAM formalism or Boolean circuits—PRAM machines can simulate Boolean circuits efficiently and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Papadimitriou|1994}}, Section 15.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the analysis of distributed algorithms, more attention is usually paid on communication operations than computational steps. Perhaps the simplest model of distributed computing is a synchronous system where all nodes operate in a lockstep fashion. This model is commonly known as the LOCAL model. During each ''communication round'', all nodes in parallel (1)&amp;nbsp;receive the latest messages from their neighbours, (2)&amp;nbsp;perform arbitrary local computation, and (3)&amp;nbsp;send new messages to their neighbors. In such systems, a central complexity measure is the number of synchronous communication rounds required to complete the task.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lynch|1996}}, p. 17–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

This complexity measure is closely related to the [[Diameter (graph theory)|diameter]] of the network. Let ''D'' be the diameter of the network. On the one hand, any computable problem can be solved trivially in a synchronous distributed system in approximately 2''D'' communication rounds: simply gather all information in one location (''D'' rounds), solve the problem, and inform each node about the solution (''D'' rounds).

On the other hand, if the running time of the algorithm is much smaller than ''D'' communication rounds, then the nodes in the network must produce their output without having the possibility to obtain information about distant parts of the network. In other words, the nodes must make globally consistent decisions based on information that is available in their ''local D-neighbourhood''. Many distributed algorithms are known with the running time much smaller than ''D'' rounds, and understanding which problems can be solved by such algorithms is one of the central research questions of the field&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Peleg|2000}}, Sections 2.3 and 7. {{harvtxt|Linial|1992}}. {{harvtxt|Naor|Stockmeyer|1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt;. Typically an algorithm which solves a problem in polylogarithmic time in the network size is considered efficient in this model.

Another commonly used measure is the total number of bits transmitted in the network (cf. [[communication complexity]])&lt;ref name="SchneiderTrading11"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dT6nwpXvES4C&amp;pg=PA51 |chapter=Trading Bit, Message, and Time Complexity of Distributed Algorithms |title=Distributed Computing |author=Schneider, J.; Wattenhofer, R. |editor=Peleg, D. |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |pages=51–65 |year=2011 |isbn=9783642240997}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The features of this concept are typically captured with the CONGEST(B) model, which similarly defined as the LOCAL model but where single messages can only contain B bits.

===Other problems===
Traditional computational problems take the perspective that we ask a question, a computer (or a distributed system) processes the question for a while, and then produces an answer and stops. However, there are also problems where we do not want the system to ever stop. Examples of such problems include the [[dining philosophers problem]] and other similar [[mutual exclusion]] problems. In these problems, the distributed system is supposed to continuously coordinate the use of shared resources so that no conflicts or [[deadlock]]s occur.

There are also fundamental challenges that are unique to distributed computing. The first example is challenges that are related to ''fault-tolerance''. Examples of related problems include [[Consensus (computer science)|consensus problems]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lynch|1996}}, Sections 5–7. {{harvtxt|Ghosh|2007}}, Chapter 13.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Byzantine fault tolerance]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lynch|1996}}, p. 99–102. {{harvtxt|Ghosh|2007}}, p. 192–193.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[self-stabilisation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Dolev|2000}}. {{harvtxt|Ghosh|2007}}, Chapter 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

A lot of research is also focused on understanding the ''asynchronous'' nature of distributed systems:
* [[Synchronizer (algorithm)|Synchronizers]] can be used to run synchronous algorithms in asynchronous systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lynch|1996}}, Section 16. {{harvtxt|Peleg|2000}}, Section 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Logical clock]]s provide a causal [[happened-before]] ordering of events.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lynch|1996}}, Section 18. {{harvtxt|Ghosh|2007}}, Sections 6.2–6.3.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Clock synchronization]] algorithms provide globally consistent physical time stamps.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ghosh|2007}}, Section 6.4.&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[Leader election|Election]]

''Coordinator election'' (or ''leader election'') is the process of designating a single [[Process (computing)|process]] as the organizer of some task distributed among several computers (nodes). Before the task is begun, all network nodes are either unaware which node will serve as the "coordinator" (or leader) of the task, or unable to communicate with the current coordinator. After a coordinator election algorithm has been run, however, each node throughout the network recognizes a particular, unique node as the task coordinator.&lt;ref name="HaloiApache15"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ym9uBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA100 |title=Apache ZooKeeper Essentials |author=Haloi, S. |publisher=Packt Publishing Ltd |pages=100–101 |year=2015 |isbn=9781784398323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The network nodes communicate among themselves in order to decide which of them will get into the "coordinator" state. For that, they need some method in order to break the symmetry among them. For example, if each node has unique and comparable identities, then the nodes can compare their identities, and decide that the node with the highest identity is the coordinator.&lt;ref name="HaloiApache15" /&gt;

The definition of this problem is often attributed to LeLann, who formalized it as a method to create a new token in a token [[ring network]] in which the token has been lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=LeLann|first=G.|year=1977|title=Distributed systems - toward a formal approach,|url=|journal=Information Processing|volume=77|pages=155·160.|via=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coordinator election algorithms are designed to be economical in terms of total [[byte]]s transmitted, and time. The algorithm suggested by Gallager, Humblet, and Spira &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=January 1983|title=A Distributed Algorithm for Minimum-Weight Spanning Trees|url=http://www.apposite-tech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/p66-gallager.pdf|journal=ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems|volume=5|issue=1|pages=66–77|doi=10.1145/357195.357200|author=[[Robert G. Gallager|R. G. Gallager]], P. A. Humblet, and P. M. Spira}}&lt;/ref&gt; for general undirected graphs has had a strong impact on the design of distributed algorithms in general, and won the [[Dijkstra Prize]] for an influential paper in distributed computing.

Many other algorithms were suggested for different kind of network [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]s, such as undirected rings, unidirectional rings, complete graphs, grids, directed Euler graphs, and others. A general method that decouples the issue of the graph family from the design of the coordinator election algorithm was suggested by Korach, Kutten, and Moran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1990|title=A Modular Technique for the Design of Efficient Distributed Leader Finding Algorithms|journal=ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems|volume=12|issue=1|pages=84–101|doi=10.1145/77606.77610|first1=Ephraim|last1=Korach|first2=Shay|last2=Kutten|first3=Shlomo|last3=Moran|authorlink2=Shay Kutten|authorlink3=Shlomo Moran|url=http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~moran/r/PS/kkm.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to perform coordination, distributed systems employ the concept of coordinators. The coordinator election problem is to choose a process from among a group of processes on different processors in a distributed system to act as the central coordinator. Several central coordinator election algorithms exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hamilton/courses/330/notes/distributed/distributed.html|title=Distributed Algorithms|last=Hamilton|first=Howard|accessdate=2013-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Properties of distributed systems===
So far the focus has been on ''designing'' a distributed system that solves a given problem. A complementary research problem is ''studying'' the properties of a given distributed system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/10045/major-unsolved-problems-in-distributed-systems|title=Major unsolved problems in distributed systems?|author=|date=|website=cstheory.stackexchange.com|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theserverside.com/feature/How-big-data-and-distributed-systems-solve-traditional-scalability-problems|title=How big data and distributed systems solve traditional scalability problems|author=|date=|website=theserverside.com|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[halting problem]] is an analogous example from the field of centralised computation: we are given a computer program and the task is to decide whether it halts or runs forever. The halting problem is [[Undecidable problem|undecidable]] in the general case, and naturally understanding the behaviour of a computer network is at least as hard as understanding the behaviour of one computer.&lt;ref name="SvozilIndet11"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ep_FCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA112 |chapter=Indeterminism and Randomness Through Physics |title=Randomness Through Computation: Some Answers, More Questions |author=Svozil, K. |editor=Hector, Z. |publisher=World Scientific |pages=112–3 |year=2011 |isbn=9789814462631}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are many interesting special cases that are decidable. In particular, it is possible to reason about the behaviour of a network of finite-state machines. One example is telling whether a given network of interacting (asynchronous and non-deterministic) finite-state machines can reach a deadlock. This problem is [[PSPACE-complete]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Papadimitriou|1994}}, Section 19.3.&lt;/ref&gt; i.e., it is decidable, but it is not likely that there is an efficient (centralised, parallel or distributed) algorithm that solves the problem in the case of large networks.

{{Forms of government}}

'''E-democracy''' (a combination of the words [[Electronic publishing|electronic]] and [[democracy]]), also known as '''digital democracy''' or '''Internet democracy''', incorporates 21st-century [[information and communications technology]] to promote [[democracy]]. It is a [[form of government]] in which all adult citizens are presumed to be eligible to [[voting|participate]] equally in the [[Direct democracy|proposal, development, and creation]] of [[law]]s.&lt;ref name=ICT_impact&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ijetae.com/files/Volume4Issue1/IJETAE_0114_109.pdf|title=The Impact of ICT on Reinforcing Citizens' Role in Government Decision Making|publisher=International Journal of Emerging Technology and Advanced Engineering|author1=Hosein Jafarkarimi |author2=Alex Sim |author3=Robab Saadatdoost |author4=Jee Mei Hee |date=Jan 2014|accessdate=15 Dec 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; E-democracy encompasses social, economic and cultural conditions that enable the free and equal practice of [[political freedom|political self-determination]].

==Goals==
{{globalize|section|date=June 2016}}

===Human rights===
The spread of free information through the internet has encouraged freedom and human development. The internet is used for promoting [[human right]]s—including [[free speech]], religion, expression, peaceful assembly, government accountability, and the right of knowledge and understanding—that support democracy. An E-democracy process has been recently proposed in a scientific article&lt;ref&gt;Zanella, A., 2017. Humans, humus, and universe. Appl. Soil Ecol. doi:10.1016/j.apsoil.2017.07.009&lt;/ref&gt; for solving a question that has crucial importance for all humans in the 21st century: "As planet Earth citizens, will you stop the climate from warming?" The author proposes to use a cell-phone for answering this question during the Olympic Games in Pyeongchang 2018 and Tokyo 2020.

===Expanding democracy===
The Internet has several attributes that encourage thinking about it as a democratic medium. The lack of [[Command and control (management)|centralized control]] makes [[censorship]] difficult. There are other parallels in the social design in the early days of the internet, such as the strongly [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] support for [[free speech]], the [[sharing culture]] that permeated nearly all aspects of Internet use, and the outright prohibition on commercial use by the [[National Science Foundation]]. Another example is the unmediated mass communication on the internet, such as through [[newsgroup]]s, chat rooms, and [[MUD]]s. This communication ignored the boundaries established with [[broadcast media]], such as [[newspaper]]s or [[radio]], and with one-to-one media, such as letters or [[landline telephone]]s. Finally, because the Internet is a massive digital network with open standards, universal and inexpensive access to a wide variety of communication media and models could actually be attained.&lt;ref&gt;Novak, T., &amp; Hoffman, D. (1998). ''Bridging the Digital Divide: The Impact of Race on Computer Access and Internet Use.'' Nashville: Vanderbilt University.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some practical issues involving e-democracy include: effective participation; voting equality at decision stage; enlightened understanding; control of the agenda; and inclusiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Democracy and Its Critics]]|publisher=Yale University Press|author=Robert Dahl|date=1989|isbn=9780300049381}}&lt;/ref&gt; Systemic issues may include cyber-security concerns and protection of sensitive data from third parties.

===Improving democracy===
{{globalize/US|section|date=August 2017}}
Strictly speaking, modern democracies are generally representative democracies, where the people elect representatives to make laws and policies; they are not direct democracies, where the people decide matters directly. They may be referred to as more or less "democratic" depending on how well the government represents the will of the people. A shift to E-democracy would resemble a change in the form of government (from Republic to democracy) as much as an improvement in the existing system.

Democracy in America has become reliant on the Internet because the Internet is a primary source of information for most Americans. The Internet educates people on democracy, helping people stay up to date with what is happening in their government. Online advertising is becoming more popular for political candidates and group's opinions on propositions.&lt;ref name=diffusion&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6210.2011.02228.x/abstract|title=Testing the Development and Diffusion of E-Government and E-Democracy: A Global Perspective|journal=Public Administration Review|author1=Chung-pin Lee |author2=Kaiju Chang |author3=Frances Stokes Berry |date=9 May 2011|accessdate=15 Dec 2014 |doi=10.1111/j.1540-6210.2011.02228.x |volume=71 |pages=444–454}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet is the first place that most people look for information and often the only place that they look. The reason for this, and especially for younger voters, is that it is easy and reliable when used correctly, thus lowering an individual's workload. This gives the user a sense of instant gratification that is crucial in the era of multitasking on computers. If the information is not easy to find then most people will not look for it. Because the Internet is so user-friendly, people are more likely to research and get involved in politics. The Internet allows people to express their opinions about the government through an alias, anonymously and judgment free.&lt;ref&gt;Oral, Behçet(2008). "Computers &amp; Education: The evaluation of the student teachers' attitudes toward Internet and democracy." Dicle University, Volume 50, Issue 1: 437-445.&lt;/ref&gt; Since a person can express himself anonymously and from the comfort of his own home, the Internet gives incentive for people to participate in the government. Because of the number of people who use the Internet, a person who puts his ideas on a high-traffic website is capable of having influence over a large number of people.

The Internet enables citizens to get and post information about politicians, and it allows those politicians to get advice from the people in larger numbers. This collective decision making and problem-solving gives more power to the citizens and helps politicians make decisions faster. This creates a more productive society that can handle problems faster and more efficiently. Getting feedback and advice from the American population is a large part of a politician's job and the Internet allows them to function effectively with larger numbers of people's opinions. With this heightened ability to communicate with the public, the American government is able to function more capably and effectively as a Democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ncr.20056/abstract|title=Citizenship And Governance In A Wild, Wired World: How Should Citizens And Public Managers Use Online Tools To Improve Democracy?|journal=National Civic Review|author=Matt Leighninger|date=2 May 2012|accessdate=15 Dec 2014|doi=10.1002/ncr.20056|volume=100|pages=20–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Generation X]] became [[Democratic deficit|disillusioned]] that even large-scale public [[protests]] such as the [[UK miners' strike (1984–1985)]] were seen to fail a decade before [[information technology]] became generally available to individual citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theconversation.com/the-politics-of-disillusionment-can-democracy-survive-6073|title=The politics of disillusionment: can democracy survive?|date=27 March 2012|publisher=The Conversation|author=John Keane|accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; E-democracy is sometimes seen as a remedy to the insular nature, concentrated power, and lack of post-election accountability in traditional democratic process organized mostly around [[political parties]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}  [[Tom Watson (Labour politician)|Tom Watson]], the [[Deputy Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Deputy Leader of the UK Labour Party]], said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It feels like the Labour frontbench is further away from our members than at any point in our history and the digital revolution can help bring the party closer together ... I'm going to ask our NEC to see whether we can have digital branches and digital delegates to the conference. Not replacing what we do but providing an alternative platform. It's a way of organising for a different generation of people who do their politics differently, get their news differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Waugh|first1=Paul|title=Tom Watson Interview: On Jeremy Corbyn, Tony Blair, Leveson, Digital Democracy; And How He Sleeps At Night|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/07/30/tom-watson-interview-on-j_n_7903380.html|accessdate=10 February 2016|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Effects==
"E-democracy offers greater electronic community access to political processes and policy choices. E-democracy development is connected to complex internal factors, such as political norms and citizen pressures"&lt;ref name=diffusion /&gt; and in general to the particular model of democracy implemented.&lt;ref name="HilbertDemoc"/&gt; E-democracy is therefore highly influenced by both internal factors to a country and by the external factors of standard innovation and diffusion theory.&lt;ref name=diffusion /&gt; People are pressuring their public officials to adopt more policies that other states or countries have regarding information and news about their government online. People have all governmental information at their fingertips and easy access to contact their government officials. In this new generation where internet and networking rule everyone's daily lives, it is more convenient that people can be informed of the government and policies through this form of communication.

In [[Jane Fountain]]'s (2001) ''Building the Virtual State'', she describes how this widespread e-democracy is able to connect with so many people and correlates it to the government we had before.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Fountain's framework provides a subtle and nuanced appreciation of the interplay of preexisting norms, procedures, and rules within bureaucracies and how these affect the introduction of new technological forms... In its most radical guise, this form of e- government would entail a radical overhaul of the modern administrative state as regular electronic consultations involving elected politicians, civil servants, pressure groups, and other affected interests become standard practice in all stages of the policy process (Sage).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cities in states with Republican-controlled legislatures, high legislative professionalization, and more active professional networks were more likely to embrace e-government and e-democracy.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

===Occupy movement===
Following the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]] a number of social networks proposed demonstrations such as the [[Occupy movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ced.berkeley.edu/bpj/2012/09/the-occupy-movement-emerging-protest-forms-and-contested-urban-spaces/|title=The 'Occupy' Movement: Emerging Protest Forms and Contested Urban Spaces {{!}} The Urban Fringe|website=ced.berkeley.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===15-M movement===
The [[15-M Movement]] started in Spain and spread to other European countries. From that emerged the Partido X ([[X Party]]) proposals in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://partidox.org/en|title=X Party's website}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/09/world/europe/09iht-spain09.html|title=Former Swiss Bank Employee Advising Spanish Political Party in Tax Battle|publisher=The New York Times|date=8 Oct 2013|accessdate=9 October 2012|author=Doreen Carvajal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arab Spring===
{{main|Arab Spring}}
During the "Arab Spring," [[online activists]] led uprisings in a dozen countries across [[North Africa]] and the [[Middle East]]. At first, [[digital media]] allowed pro-[[democracy]] movements to use the internet against authoritarian regimes; however, these regimes eventually worked social media into their own [[counter-insurgency]] strategies. Digital media helped to turn individualized, localized, and community-specific dissent into structured movements with a collective consciousness about both shared grievances and opportunities for action.&lt;ref&gt;"The Role of Digital Media", Philip N. Howard, Muzammil M. Hussain. ''Journal of Democracy'', Volume 22, Number 3, July 2011.pp. 35-48 10.1353/jod.2011.0041 ([https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_democracy/summary/v022/22.3.howard.html Abstract])&lt;/ref&gt;

====Egyptian Revolution====
{{main|Egyptian Revolution of 2011}}
On January 25 of 2011, mass protests began in [[Cairo, Egypt]], protesting the long reign of Egyptian President [[Hosni Mubarak]], the high unemployment rate, government corruption, [[poverty]], and [[oppression]] within society. This 18-day revolution did not begin with guns, violence, or protests, but rather with the creation of a single Facebook page which quickly gained the attention of thousands, and soon millions, of Egyptians, spreading into a global phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/wael-ghonim-and-egypts-new-age-revolution/|title=Wael Ghonim and Egypt's New Age Revolution|publisher=CBS News- 60 Minutes|author=Harry Smith|date=13 Feb 2011|accessdate=15 Dec 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The internet empowered protesters and allowed for anyone with access to the internet be involved in the democratization process of their government. In order to have a democratic, free nation, all information that can be shared, should be shared. Protestors communicated, organized, and collaborated through the use of this technology with real time, real impacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://technolog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/02/11/6033340-power-of-twitter-facebook-in-egypt-crucial-says-un-rep |title=Power of Twitter, Facebook in Egypt Crucial, Says U.N. Rep. |publisher=MSNBC Technology |author=Helen A.S. Popkin |date=16 Feb 2011 |accessdate=15 Dec 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104145856/http://technolog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/02/11/6033340-power-of-twitter-facebook-in-egypt-crucial-says-un-rep |archivedate=4 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Technologies played an enormous role on the world stage during this time. Even when the regime eliminated all access to the Internet in a failed attempt to halt further political online forums, Google and Twitter teamed up, making a system that would get information out to the public without having access to the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Cecilia Kang|publisher=The Washington Post- Post Tech|title=Google, Twitter Team up for Egyptians to Send Tweets via Phone|date=31 Jan 2011|accessdate=27 Feb 2011|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/posttech/2011/01/google_twitter_team_up_for_ser.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interactivity of media during this revolution boosted civic participation and played a monumental role in the political outcome of the revolution and the democratization of an entire nation.

The revolution in Egypt has been understood by some as an example of a broader trend of transforming from a system based on group control to one of "networked individualism". These networked societies are constructed post -"triple revolution" of technology, which involves a three-step process. Step one in the "triple revolution" is "the turn to social networks", step two: "the proliferation of the far-flung, instantaneous internet", and step three: "the even wider proliferation of always-available mobile phones".&lt;ref name="homes.chass.utoronto.ca"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zhuo|first1=X.|last2=Wellman|first2=B.|last3=Yu|first3=J. |year=2011 &lt;!-- July/September). --&gt; |title=Egypt: The first internet revolt? |work=Peace Magazine|pages= 6–10|url=http://homes.chass.utoronto.ca/~wellman/publications/egypt/PMag-1107-Egypt-offprint.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; These elements play a key role in change through the Internet. Such technologies provide an alternative sphere that is unregulated by the government, and where construction of ideas and protests can foster without regulation. For example, In Egypt, the "April 6 Youth Movement" established their political group on Facebook where they called for a national strike to occur on April 6. This event was ultimately suppressed, however; the Facebook group remained, spurring the growth of other activist parties to take an online media route. The Internet in Egypt was used also to form connections with networks of people outside of their own country. The connections provided through Internet media sources, such as Twitter allowed rapid spread of the revolt to be known around the world. Specifically, more than 3 million tweets contained six popular hashtags alluring to the revolt, for example, #Egypt and #sidibouzid; further enabling the spread of knowledge and change in Egypt.&lt;ref name="homes.chass.utoronto.ca"/&gt;

===Kony 2012===
{{main|Kony 2012}}
The Invisible Children's Kony 2012 video was released March 5, 2012, initiating an online grassroots campaign for the search and arrest of [[Joseph Kony]]. Invisible Children, the non-profit organization responsible for this video campaign, was founded on the mission to bring awareness to the vile actions of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), located in Central Africa, and the arrest of its leader, Joseph Kony. In the video, Jason Russell, one of the founders of Invisible Children, says that "the problem is that 99% of the planet doesn't know who [Kony] is" and the only way to stop him is by having enough support from the people to convince the government to continue the hunt for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universitytimes.ie/?p=9230|title=Kony 2012: History in the making?|publisher=The University Times|author=Hazel Shaw|date=7 Mar 2012|accessdate=15 Dec 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; So, Invisible Children's purpose for the video was to raise awareness by making Kony famous through the ever-expanding market of social media and to use the technology we have today to bring his crimes to light.

On March 21, 2012, a group of 33 Senators introduced a resolution condemning "the crimes against humanity" committed by Joseph Kony and the LRA. The resolution supports the continued efforts by the US government to "strengthen the capabilities of regional military forces deployed to protect civilians and pursue commanders of the LRA, and calls for cross-border efforts to increase civilian protection and provide assistance to populations affected by the LRA." Senator [[Lindsey Graham]], a co-sponsor of the resolution stated that "When you get 100 million Americans looking at something, you will get our attention. This YouTube sensation is gonna help the Congress be more aggressive and will do more to lead to his demise than all other action combined".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0312/74355.html|title=Joseph Kony captures Congress' attention|author=Scott Wong|publisher=Politico|date=22 Mar 2012|accessdate=15 Dec 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India Against Corruption 2011-12===
[[India Against Corruption]] (IAC) is an anti-corruption movement in India which was particularly prominent during the anti-corruption protests of 2011 and 2012, the central point of which was debate concerning the introduction of a Jan Lokpal bill. During that time it sought to mobilize the masses in support of their demands for a less corrupt society in India. Divisions amongst key members of the IAC's core committee eventually led to a split within the movement. Arvind Kejriwal left to form the Aam Aadmi Party, while Anna Hazare left to form Jantantra Morcha.

===Long March (Pakistan)===
{{main|Long March (Pakistan)}}
In December 2012, after living for seven years in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Canada, Qadri returned to Pakistan and initiated a political campaign. Qadri called for a "million-men" march in Islamabad to protest against the government's corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Pakistani-city-prepares-for-clerics-march/tabid/417/articleID/283032/Default.aspx|work=3 News NZ | title= Pakistani city prepares for cleric's march| date=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 January 2013, a crowd marched down the city's main avenue. Thousands of people pledged to sit-in until their demands were met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://tribune.com.pk/story/494129/long-march-walking-in-the-name-of-revolution/ |title= Long march: Walking in the name of 'revolution' | date=15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he started the long march from Lahore about 25,000 people were with him.&lt;ref name="3news.co.nz"&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Pakistanis-protest-corrupt-government/tabid/417/articleID/283057/Default.aspx |work=3 News NZ | title= Pakistanis protest 'corrupt' government | date=15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He told the rally in front of parliament: "There is no Parliament; there is a group of looters, thieves and dacoits [bandits] ...

E-Democracy is made possible through its role in relevancy of participation, the social construction of inclusiveness, sensitivity to the individual, and flexibility in participation. The Internet provides a sense of relevancy in participation through allowing everyone's voice to be heard and expressed. A structure of social inclusion is also provided through a wide variety of Internet sites, groups, and social networks, all representing different viewpoints and ideas. Sensitivity to the individual's needs is accomplished through the ability to express individual opinions publicly and rapidly. Finally, the Internet is an extremely flexible area of participation; it is low in cost and widely available to the public. Through these four directions, [[E-Democracy]] and the implementation of the Internet are able to play an active role in societal change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Anttiroiko | first1 = Ari-Veikko | year = 2003 | title = Building strong e-democracy: the role of technology in developing democracy for the information age | url = | journal = Commun. ACM | volume = 46 | issue = 9| pages = 121–128 | doi = 10.1145/910000/903926 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet access===
{{main|Right to Internet access}}
The E-democratic process is hindered by the [[digital divide]] between active participants and those who do not participate in electronic communities. Advocates of E-democracy may advocate government moves to close this gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Helbig |first1=Natalie |title=Understand the complexity of electronic government: Implications from the digital divide literature |url=http://www.enricoferro.com/OFFICE/RESEARCH/AMCIS2005_FINAL.pdf|publisher=Government Information Quarterly |accessdate=2 May 2012 |author2=Ramon J. Gil-Garcia |pages=89–97 [95] |date=3 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disparity e-governance and e-democracy between developed and developing worlds has been attributed to the [[digital divide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.koreaittimes.com/story/22862/impact-global-digital-divide-world|title=The Impact of The Global Digital Divide on The World {{!}} Korea IT Times|website=www.koreaittimes.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Practical objections include the [[digital divide]] between those with access and those without, as well as the [[opportunity cost]] of expenditure on e-democracy innovations. There is also skepticicsm of the amount of impact that they can make through online participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Komito | first1 = L. | year = 2007 | title = Community and inclusion: The impact of new communications technologies | url = | journal = Irish Journal of Sociology | volume = 16 | issue = 2| pages = 77–96 | doi=10.1177/079160350701600205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Security and the protection of privacy===
{{main|Internet security}}
The government must be in a position to guarantee that online communications are secure and that they do not violate people's privacy. This is especially important when considering electronic voting. An electoral voting system is more complex than other electronic transaction systems and the authentication mechanisms employed must be able to prevent ballot rigging or the threat of rigging. This may include the use of smart cards that allow a voter's identity to be verified whilst at the same time ensuring the privacy of the vote cast. [[Electronic voting in Estonia]] is one example of a method to conquer the privacy-identity problem inherent in internet voting systems. However, the objective should be to provide equivalence with the security and privacy of current manual systems.

===Government responsiveness===
In order to attract people to get involved in online consultations and discussions, the government must respond to people and actively demonstrate that there is a relationship between the citizen's engagement and policy outcome. It is also important that people are able to become involved in the process, at a time and place that is convenient to them but when their opinions will count. The government will need to ensure that the structures are in place to deal with increased participation.

In order to ensure that issues are debated in a democratic, inclusive, tolerant and productive way, the role that intermediaries and
representative organizations may play should be considered. In order to strengthen the effectiveness of the existing legal rights of access to information held by public authorities, citizens should have the right to effective public deliberation and moderation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agoraproject.eu/papers/e-Government%20in%20the%20Service%20of%20Democracy.pdf Waller Livesey Edin (2001)]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hilbert 3D e-democracy roadmap.png|thumb|350px|3D e-democracy roadmap: transcending the trade-offs&lt;ref name="HilbertJITP"/&gt;]] E-democracy is the use of [[information and communication technologies]] and strategies in [[political]] and [[governance]] processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/un-dpadm/unpan038449.pdf|title=Characterizing E-Participation in Policy-Making|publisher= 2004 International Conference on System Sciences|author=Ann Macintosh|authorlink=Ann Macintosh|date=2004|accessdate=15 Dec 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; E-democracy has the potential to overcome the traditional trade-off between the size of the group that participates in the democratic process and the depth of the will expression (see Figure). Traditionally, large group size was achieved with simple [[ballot]] [[voting]], whereas the depth of the will expression was limited to predefined options (what's on the ballot), while depth of will expression was achieved by limiting the number of participants through [[representative democracy]] (see Table). The [[social media]] [[Web 2.0]] revolution has shown to achieve both, large group sizes and depth of will expression, but the will expressions in social media are not structured and it is difficult (and often subjective) to make sense of them (see Table). New information processing techniques, including [[big data]] analytics and the [[semantic web]] have shown ways to make use of these possibilities for the implementation of future forms of e-democracy.&lt;ref name="HilbertJITP"/&gt; For now, the process of e-democracy is carried out by technologies such as [[electronic mailing list]]s, [[peer-to-peer]] networks, [[collaborative software]], [[wiki]]s, Internet forums and [[blog]]s.

E-democracy has been analyzed with regard to the different stages of the democratic process, such as "information provision, deliberation, and participation in decision-making.",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pautz|first=H.|title=The Internet, Political Participation and Election Turnout|journal=German Politics &amp; Society|year=2010|volume=28|issue=3|doi=10.3167/gps.2010.280309|pages=156–175}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the hierarchical level of government, including [[Local community|local communities]], [[Administrative division|states/regions]], [[Sovereign state|nations]] and on [[World view|the global stage]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicus.net/articles/edempublicnetwork.html|title=E-Democracy, E-Governance, and Public Net-Work by Steven Clift - Publicus.Net|work=publicus.net|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by its reach and scope of involvement, such as the involvement of [[citizen]]s/[[voter]]s, the [[Mass media|media]], [[elected official]]s, [[political organization]]s, and [[government]]s.&lt;ref name="Publicus.net"&gt;Clift, S.

[[Social media]] sites, such as [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[WordPress]] and [[Blogspot]], are playing an increasingly important role in democratic deliberations.&lt;ref name="mad"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/ColumnsBusiness/Is-Internet-democracy-under-threat-in-India/Article1-787097.aspx|title=Is Internet Democracy under Threat in India?|publisher=Hindustan Times|author=Madhavan, N.|date=25 Dec 2011|accessdate=15 Dec 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415011918/http://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/ColumnsBusiness/Is-Internet-democracy-under-threat-in-India/Article1-787097.aspx|archivedate=15 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Is Facebook keeping you in a political bubble? http://news.sciencemag.org/social-sciences/2015/05/facebook-keeping-you-political-bubble&lt;/ref&gt; The role of [[social media]] in e-democracy has been an emerging area for e-democracy, as well as related technological developments, such as [[argument map]]s and eventually, the [[semantic web]].&lt;ref name="HilbertJITP"&gt;{{Cite journal |accessdate=24 February 2010 |url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a911066517 |title=The Maturing Concept of E-Democracy: From E-Voting and Online Consultations to Democratic Value Out of Jumbled Online Chatter |journal=[[Journal of Information Technology and Politics]] |date=April 2009 |author=Martin Hilbert}} free access to the article can be found here martinhilbert.net/e-democracyHilbertJITP.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Another related development consists in combining the open communication of social networking with the structured communication of closed panels including experts and/or policy-makers, such as for example through modified versions of the [[Delphi method]] (HyperDelphi) to combine the open communication of self-organized virtual communities with the structured communication of closed panels, including members of the policy-community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Democrazia elettronica (Electronic Democracy)|url=http://www.bolognini.org/bolognini_DE.htm|year=2001|author=Maurizio Bolognini|publisher=Carocci|location=Rome|isbn=88-430-2035-8}}.

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = See | first1 =  | last2 = Hilbert | first2 = Miles | last3 = Othmer | first3 =  | year = 2009 | title = Foresight tools for participative policy-making in inter-governmental processes in developing countries: Lessons learned from the eLAC Policy Priorities Delphi | url = http://www.martinhilbert.net/Hilbert_etal.eLACdelphi.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Technological Forecasting and Social Change | volume = 76 | issue = 7| pages = 880–896 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This approach addresses the question of how, in electronic democracy, to reconcile distributed knowledge and self-organized memories with critical control, responsibility and decision. The social networking entry point, for example, is within the citizens' environment, and the engagement is on the citizens' terms. Proponents of e-government perceive government use of social networks as a medium to help government act more like the public it serves. Examples of state usage can be found at The Official Commonwealth of Virginia Homepage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virginia.gov|title=Virginia.gov - Home|work=virginia.gov|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; where citizens can find [[Google]] tools and [[open social]] forums. Those are seen as important stepping stones in the maturation of the concept of e-democracy.&lt;ref name="HilbertJITP"/&gt;

===Civic engagement===
{{main|Civic engagement}}
Civic engagement includes three dimensions: [[political knowledge]] of public affairs, political trust for the political system, and political participation in influencing the government and the decision-making process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Norris | first = Pippa | title = Digital divide: civic engagement, information poverty, and the internet worldwide | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge New York | year = 2001 | isbn = 9780521002233 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The internet aids civic engagement by providing a new avenue to interact with by governmental institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bakardjieva|first=Maria | title = Subactivism: lifeworld and politics in the age of the internet | journal = [[The Information Society]] | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 91–104 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/01972240802701627 | date = March 2009 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01972240802701627 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of E-democracy believe that governments can be much more actively engaged than presently,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Caldow|first=Janet|year=2003|title= E-democracy: putting down global roots|url=http://www-01.ibm.com/industries/government/ieg/pdf/e-democracy%20putting%20down%20roots.pdf|format=pdf | website = www-01.ibm.com/industries/government/ieg | publisher = [[IBM|IBM Institute for Electronic Government]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and encourage citizens to take their own initiative to influence decisions that will affect them.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Whittaker | first = Jason | contribution = Cyberspace and the public sphere | editor-last = Whittaker | editor-first = Jason | title = The cyberspace handbook | pages = 257–275 | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0415168366 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many studies report increasing use of the internet to find political information. Between 1996 and 2002, the number of adults who reported that the internet was significant in their choices increased from about 14 to 20 percent.&lt;ref name="Philip N. Howard pp. 153-170"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Howard | first = Philip N. | title = Deep democracy, thin citizenship: the impact of digital media in political campaign strategy | journal = [[American Academy of Political and Social Science#The Annals|Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science]] | volume = 597 | issue = 1 | pages = 153–170 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0002716204270139 | date = January 2005 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0002716204270139 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, nearly a quarter of the population reported having visited a website to research specific public policy issues. Studies have shown that more people visit websites that challenge their point of view than visit websites that mirror their own opinions.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Sixteen percent of the population has participated in online political culture by interacting with political websites through joining campaigns, volunteering time, donating money, or participating in polls. According to a survey conducted by Philip N. Howard, almost two-thirds of the adult population in the United States has had some online experience with political news, information, or other content over the past four election cycles.&lt;ref name="Philip N. Howard pp. 153-170"/&gt; They tend to reference the websites of special interest groups more than the websites of specific elected leaders, political candidates, political parties, nonpartisan groups, and local community groups.

The [[information capacity]] available on the Internet allows citizens to become more knowledgeable about government and political issues, and the [[interactivity]] of the medium allows for new forms of communication with government, i.e. elected officials and/or public servants. The posting of contact information, [[legislation]], [[Political agenda|agendas]], and policies makes government more [[Transparency (philosophy)|transparent]], potentially enabling more informed participation both online and offline.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = ENGAGE: creating e-government that supports commerce, collaboration, community and Commonwealth | url = http://www.nicusa.com/pdf/CDG07_NIC_Engage.pdf | publisher = Center for Digital Government | location = Folsom, California | year = 2008 | deadurl = bot: unknown | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100326054636/http://www.nicusa.com/pdf/CDG07_NIC_Engage.pdf | archivedate = 26 March 2010 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Matt Leighninger, the internet impacts government in two main ways, empowering individuals, and empowering groups of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Leighninger | first = Matt | title = Citizenship and governance in a wild, wired world: how should citizens and public managers use online tools to improve democracy? | journal = National Civic Review | volume = 100 | issue = 2 | pages = 20–29 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1002/ncr.20056 | date = Summer 2011 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ncr.20056 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The internet gives interested citizens better access to the information which allows them to impact on public policy. Using online tools to organize, people can more easily be involved in the policy-making process of government, and this has led to increased public engagement. Social media sites support networks of people; online networks affect the political process, including causing an increase in politicians' efforts to appeal to the public in campaigns.

For e-democracy provides a forum for public discussion. An e-government process improves cooperation with the local populace and helps the government focus in upon key issues the community wants addressed. The theory is that every citizen has the opportunity to have a voice in their local government. E-democracy works in tandem with local communities and gives every citizen who wants to contribute the chance. What makes an effective e-democracy is that the citizens not only contribute to the government, but they communicate and work together to improve their own local communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Saglie | first1 = Jo | last2 = Vabo | first2 = Signy Irene | title = Size and e-democracy: online participation in Norwegian local politics | journal = [[Scandinavian Political Studies]] | volume = 32 | issue = 4 | pages = 382–401 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9477.2009.00235.x | date = December 2009 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9477.2009.00235.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|397}}

E-democracy is the use of [[information and communication technologies]] (ICT) to support the democratic decision-making processes. ICTs play a major role in organizing and informing citizens in various forms of civic engagement. ICTs are used to enhance active participation of citizens and to support the collaboration between actors for policy-making purposes within the political processes of all stages of governance.&lt;ref&gt;Kubicek, H., &amp; Westholm, H. (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Macintoch, Ann (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] lists three main factors when it comes to ICTs promoting civic engagement. The first of these is timing; most of the civil engagement occurs during the agenda-setting in a cycle. The second key factor is tailor; this refers to the idea of how ICTs are changing in order to allow for more civic engagement. The last of these factors is integrations; integration is how new ICTs are combining the new technological ways with the traditional ways in order to gain more civic engagement.&lt;ref name=OECD&gt;{{cite book | last = OECD | author-link = Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development |title=Promise and Problems of E-Democracy |url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/9/11/35176328.pdf | format = pdf |publisher= [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] | location = Paris | year = 2003 | isbn = 9789264019485  |quote=ICTs can enable greater citizen engagement in policy-making... }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ICT creates the opportunity for a government that is simultaneously more democratic and more expert by creating open online collaboration between professionals and the general public. The responsibility of gathering information and making decisions is shared between those with technological expertise and those who are professionally considered the decision-makers. Greater public participation in the collaboration of ideas and policies makes decision-making is more democratic. ICT also promotes the idea of [[Pluralism (political theory)|pluralism]] within a democracy, bringing new issues and perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Clarke | first = Amanda | title = Social media: 4. Political uses and implications for representative democracy | url = http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2010/bdp-lop/bp/2010-10-eng.pdf | format = pdf | publisher = Reference and Strategic Analysis Division, Parliamentary Information and Research Service | location = Ottawa, Ontario, Canada | id = 2010-10-E | year = 2010 | oclc = 927202545 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regular citizens become potential producers of political value and commentary, for example, by creating individual blogs and websites. The online political sphere can work together, like ABCNews did with their Campaign Watchdog effort, where citizens by the polls reported any rule violations perpetrated by any candidate's party.&lt;ref name="Foot"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Foot | first1 = Kirsten A. | last2 = Schneider | first2 = Steven M. | title = Online action in Campaign 2000: an exploratory analysis of the U.S. political web sphere | journal = Journal of Broadcasting and Electronic Media | volume = 46 | issue = 2 | pages = 222–244 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1207/s15506878jobem4602_4 | date = June 2002 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15506878jobem4602_4 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://people.sunyit.edu/~steve/foot-schneider-online-action-jbem.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Candidate's for the United States presidential race frequently used their websites to encourage their voters to not only vote, but to encourage their friends to vote as well. This two-step process, encouraging an individual to vote and to tell his or her friends to vote, was just emerging at that time. Now, political involvement from a variety of social media is commonplace and civic engagement through online forums frequent. Through the use of ICTs, politically minded individuals have the opportunity to become more involved.&lt;ref name="Foot"/&gt;

===Youth engagement===
{{main|Youth activism}}
Young people under the age of 35, or [[Generation X]] and [[Generation Y]], have been noted for their lack of political interest and activity.&lt;ref&gt;Owen, D. (2006). The Internet and youth civic engagement in the United States. In S. Oates, D. Owen &amp; R. K. Gibson (Eds.), The Internet and politics: Citizens, voters and activists. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Electronic democracy has been suggested as a possible method to increase [[voter turnout]], democratic participation, and political knowledge in youth.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Parties in Transition, 3rd Edition. Gagnon and Tanguay (eds). Chapter 20 - Essay by Milner&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Andrew |first=Alex M. |title=Cybernetics and E-Democracy |journal=Kybernetes |year=2008 |volume=37 |issue=7 |pages=1066–1068 |url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=1741982 |accessdate=5 February 2012 |doi=10.1108/03684920810884414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of youth e-citizenship seems to be caught between two distinct approaches: management and autonomy. The policy of "targeting" young people so that they can "play their part" can be read either as an encouragement of youth activism or an attempt to manage it.&lt;ref name="Coleman, Stephen 2008"&gt;Coleman, Stephen. "Doing IT for Themselves: Management versus Autonomy in Youth E-Citizenship." Civic Life Online: Learning How Digital Media Can Engage Youth. Edited by W. Lance Bennett. The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation Series on Digital Media and Learning. Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 2008. 189–206. {{doi|10.1162/dmal.9780262524827.189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Autonomous e-citizens argue that despite their limited experience, youth deserve to speak for themselves on agendas of their own making. On the contrary, managed e-citizens regard young people as apprentice citizens who are in a process of transition from the immaturity of childhood to the self-possession of adulthood, and are thus incapable of contributing to politics without regulation. The Internet is another important issue, with managed e-citizens believing young people are highly vulnerable to misinformation and misdirection. The conflict between the two faces of e-citizenship is a view of democracy as an established and reasonably just system, with which young people should be encouraged to engage, and democracy as a political as well as cultural aspiration, most likely to be realized through networks in which young people engage with one another. Ultimately, strategies of accessing and influencing power are at the heart of what might first appear to be mere differences of communication styles.&lt;ref name="Coleman, Stephen 2008"/&gt;

The Highland Youth Voice demonstrated the attempt to increase democratic involvement, especially through online measures, in Scotland.&lt;ref name="hyv.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hyv.org.uk/|title=Highland Youth Parliament - Official Website|work=hyv.org.uk|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The youth population is increasingly more prominent in governmental policy and issues in the UK. However, involvement and interest have been decreasing. In 2001 elections in the United Kingdom to Westminster, the turnout of 18- to 24-year-olds was estimated at only 40%, which can be compared to the more than 80% of 16- to 24-year-old who have accessed the internet at some time in their life.&lt;ref name="Macintosh, Ann 2003"&gt;{{cite web|author=Macintosh, Ann, Edmund Robson, Ella Smith, and Angus Whyte|date=Feb 2003|title=Electronic Democracy and Young People|publisher=Social Science Computer Review|url=http://ssc.sagepub.com/content/21/1/43.short}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child have promoted and stressed the need to educate the younger population as citizens of the nation in which they live in, and promote the participation and active politics which they can shape through debate and communication.

The Highland Youth Voice aims to increase the involvement of the younger generation through understanding their needs and wishes for their government, through an understanding of their views, experiences, and aspirations. Highland Youth Voice gives young Scots a chance to influence the decision makers in the Highlands.&lt;ref name="hyv.org.uk"/&gt;
The members age from 14 to 18 and the parliament as a whole is an elected body of around 100 members. They are elected directly through schools and youth forums. Through the website, those involved are able to discuss the issues important to them. The final prominent democratic aspect of the website is the elections for members, which occur every other year. These three contents of the website allow for an online forum in which members may educate themselves through Youth Voice, partake in online policy debates, or experience a model of e-democracy in the ease of online voting.

===Civil society===
{{main|Civil society}}
Citizens' associations play an important role in the democratic process, providing a place for individuals to learn about public affairs and a source of power outside that of the state, according to theorists like [[Alexis de Tocqueville]]. Public policy researcher [[Hans Klein]] at the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] notes that participation in such forums has a number of barriers, such as the need to meet in one place at one time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Tocqueville in Cyberspace: Using the Internet for Citizens Associations |last=Klein |first=Hans |date=January 1999 |issue=15 |pages=213–220 |journal=The Information Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study of a civic association in the northeastern United States, Klein found that electronic communications greatly enhanced the ability of the organization to fulfill its mission. The lower cost of information exchange on the Internet, as well as the high level of reach that the content potentially has, makes the Internet an attractive medium for political information, particularly amongst social interest groups and parties with lower budgets.

For example, environmental or social issue groups may find the Internet an easier mechanism to increase awareness of their issues, as compared to traditional media outlets, such as television or newspapers, which require heavy financial investment. Due to all these factors, the Internet has the potential to take over certain traditional media of political communication, such as the telephone, the television, newspapers and the radio. The [[civil society]] has gradually moved into the online world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jensen | first1 = M. | last2 = Danziger | first2 = J. | last3 = Venkatesh | first3 = A. | year = 2007 | title = Jan). Civil society and cyber society: The role of the internet in community associations and democratic politics | url = | journal = Information Society | volume = 23 | issue = 1| pages = 39–50 | doi=10.1080/01972240601057528}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many forms of association in civic society. The term ''interest group'' conventionally refers to more formal organizations that either focus on particular social groups and economic sectors, such as trade unions and business and professional associations, or on more specific issues, such as abortion, gun control, or the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Norris, P. (2001). ''Digital divide: Civic engagement, information poverty, and the Internet worldwide.'' Cambridge: University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Other traditional interest groups have well-established organizational structures and formal membership rules, and their primary orientation is toward influencing government and the policy process. Transnational advocacy networks bring together loose coalitions of these organizations under common umbrella organizations that cross national borders.

Novel tools are being developed that are aimed at empowering bloggers, webmasters and owners of other social media, with the effect of moving from a ''strictly informational'' use of the Internet to using the Internet ''as a means of social organization'' not requiring top-down action. [[Call to action (marketing)|Calls to action]], for instance, are a novel concept designed to allow webmasters to mobilize their viewers into action without the need for leadership. These tools are also utilized worldwide: for example, India is developing an effective [[blogosphere]] that allows [[internet user]]s to state their thoughts and opinions.&lt;ref&gt;The road to e-democracy. (2008, February). [[The Economist]], 386(8567), 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Internet may serve multiple functions for all these organizations, including lobbying elected representatives, public officials, and policy elites; networking with related associations and organizations; mobilizing organizers, activists, and members using action alerts, newsletters, and emails; raising funds and recruiting supporters; and communicating their message to the public via the traditional news media.

===Deliberative democracy===
{{main|Deliberative democracy|Participatory democracy}}

The Internet also plays a central role in [[deliberative democracy]], where deliberation and access to multiple viewpoints is central in decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;[http://psc.sagepub.com/content/27/4/21.refs Gimmler, A. (2001). Deliberative democracy, the public sphere, and the internet. Philosophy Social Criticism, 27(4), 21-39.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet is able to provide an opportunity for interaction and serves as a prerequisite in the deliberative process as a research tool. On the Internet, the exchange of ideas is widely encouraged through a vast number of websites, blogs, and social networking outlets, such as Twitter; all of which encourage freedom of expression. Through the Internet, information is easily accessible, and in a cost effective manner, providing access and means for change. Another fundamental feature of the Internet is its uncontrolled nature, and ability to provide all viewpoints no matter the accuracy. The freedom the Internet provides is able to foster and advocate change, crucial in E-Democracy.

A recent advancement in the utilization of E-Democracy for the deliberative process is the [[California Report Card]] created by the Data and Democracy Initiative of the [[Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://citris-uc.org/news/2011/ken_goldberg_data_and_democracy_initiative CITRIS - Ken Goldberg appointed Faculty Director of the CITRIS Data and Democracy Initiative] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609141130/http://citris-uc.org/news/2011/ken_goldberg_data_and_democracy_initiative |date=9 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[University of California, Berkeley]], together with Lt. Governor [[Gavin Newsom]]. The [[California Report Card]], launched in January 2014, is a mobile-optimized web application designed to facilitate online [[deliberative democracy]]. After a short opinion poll on 6 timely issues, participants are invited to enter an online "café" where they are placed, using [[Principal Component Analysis]], among users with similar views. They are then encouraged to engage in the deliberative process by entering textual suggestions about new political issues and grading other participants' suggestions. The [[California Report Card]] prides itself on being resistant to private agendas dominating the discussion.

Another example is [[Open Forum (Australia)|openforum.com.au]], an Australian non-profit eDemocracy project that invites politicians, senior public servants, academics, business people and other key stakeholders to engage in high-level policy debate.

An alternative to the SOPA and PIPA, the [[Online Protection and Enforcement of Digital Trade Act]] (OPEN Act) is supported by Google and Facebook. The OPEN Act website Keep The Web Open&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://keepthewebopen.com/|title=keeping the internet open &amp; delivering open government technology|work=keepthewebopen.com|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides full access to the bill. The site also incorporates user input, over 150 changes have been made by users.&lt;ref name="CNNBlog"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whatsnext.blogs.cnn.com/2012/01/18/the-open-act-as-an-experiment-in-digital-democracy/|title=The OPEN Act as an experiment in digital democracy – What's Next - CNN.com Blogs|last=Sutter|first=John D.|date=January 18, 2012|work=CNN Blogs|accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sutter|first=John D|title=The OPEN Act as an experiment in digital democracy|url=http://whatsnext.blogs.cnn.com/2012/01/18/the-open-act-as-an-experiment-in-digital-democracy/|work=whatsnext.blogs.cnn.com|publisher=CNN|accessdate=6 February 2012|date=18 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[peer-to-patent]] project allows the public to do research and present the patent examiner with 'prior art' publications which will inform them of the novelty of the invention so that they can determine whether the invention is worthy of a patent. The community elects ten prior art pieces to be sent to the patent examiner for review. This enables the public to directly communicate with the patent examiner. This form of e-democracy is a structured environment which demands certain information from participants that aid in the decision-making process. The goal of the project is to make decision-making process is made more effective by allowing experts and civilians who work together to find solutions. Beyond citizens checking a box that reduces opinions to a few given words, citizens can participate and share ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democracyjournal.org/article.php?ID=6570|title=Wiki-Government|author=Beth Simone Noveck|publisher=Democracy Journal|date=2008|accessdate=15 Dec 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229110700/http://democracyjournal.org/article.php?ID=6570|archivedate=29 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voting and polling===
{{see also|Electronic voting|Voting advice application|Open access poll}}
Another great hurdle in implementing e-democracy is the matter of ensuring security in internet voting systems. Viruses and malware could be used to block or redirect citizens' votes on matters of great importance; as long as that threat remains, e-democracy will not be able to diffuse throughout society. Kevin Curran and Eric Nichols of the Internet Technologies Research Group noted in 2005 that "a secure Internet voting system is theoretically possible, but it would be the first secure networked application ever created in the history of computers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Curran|first=Kevin|author2=Nichols, Eric|title=E-Democracy|journal=Journal of Social Sciences |year=2005|volume=1|issue=1|pages=16–18&lt;!--|accessdate=6 February 2012--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government transparency and accessibility===
{{see also|Transparency (behavior)|Open government|Radical transparency}}
Through ListServs, [[RSS]] feeds, mobile messaging, micro-blogging services and blogs, government and its agencies can share information to citizens who share common interests and concerns. Some government representatives are also beginning to use [[Twitter]] which provides them with an easy medium to inform their followers. In the state of [[Rhode Island]], for instance, Treasurer [[Frank T. Caprio]] is offering daily tweets of the state's cash flow.

A number of non-governmental sites have developed cross-jurisdiction, customer-focused applications that extract information from thousands of governmental organizations into a system that brings consistency to data across many dissimilar providers. It is convenient and cost-effective for businesses, and the public benefits by getting easy access to the most current information available without having to expend tax dollars to get it. One example of this is transparent.gov.com,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transparent.gov.com|title=Making Government User-friendly - Government Information|work=gov.com|accessdate=17 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140603082954/http://transparent.gov.com/|archivedate=3 June 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; a free resource for citizens to quickly identify the various [[Open Government Initiative|open government initiatives]] taking place in their community or in communities across the country. A similar example is  [[USA.gov]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usa.gov|title=USA.gov: The U.S. Government's Official Web Portal|work=usa.gov|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the official site of the United States government, which is a directory that links to every federal and state agency.

E-democracy leads to a more simplified process and access to government information for public-sector agencies and citizens. For example, the [[Indiana]] Bureau of Motor Vehicles simplified the process of certifying driver records to be admitted in county court proceedings. [[Indiana]] became the first state to allow government records to be digitally signed, legally certified and delivered electronically by using Electronic Postmark technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.in.gov/bmv/|title=BMV: myBMV|work=in.gov|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The internet has created increased government accessibility to news, policies, and contacts in the 21st century: "In 2000 only two percent of government sites offered three or more services online; in 2007 that figure was 58 percent. In 2000, 78 percent of the states offered no on-line services; in 2007 only 14 percent were without these services (West, 2007)"(Issuu). Direct access via email has also increased; "In 2007, 89 percent of government sites allowed the public e-mail a public official directly rather than simply e-mailing the webmaster (West, 2007)"(Issuu).

==Opposition==
[[Information and communications technologies]] can be used for both democratic and anti-democratic ends.(e.g. both coercive control and participation can be fostered by digital technology)&lt;ref name="HilbertDemoc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.martinhilbert.net/democracy.html|title=Digital Processes and Democratic Theory|work=MartinHilbert.net|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Orwell]]'s in his [[Nineteen Eighty-Four]] is one example of the vision of the anti-democratic use of technology.

Objections to direct democracy are argued to apply to e-democracy, such as the potential for direct [[governance]] to tend towards the polarization of opinions, [[populism]], and [[demagoguery]].&lt;ref name="HilbertDemoc"/&gt;

===Internet censorship===
{{main|Internet censorship}}
In a nation with heavy government censorship, e-democracy could not be utilized to its full extent. Governments often implement internet crackdowns during widespread political protests. In the middle-east in 2011, for example, the multiple cases of internet blackouts were dubbed the "Arab Net Crackdown". The list of countries that have been reported to have initiated internet lockdowns is a long one. Libya, Egypt, Bahrain, Syria, Iran, and Yemen are all countries whose leaders implemented complete censorship of the internet in response to the plethora of pro-democracy demonstrations in their respective nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fpif.org/articles/corporations_and_the_arab_net_crackdown|title=Corporations and the Arab Net Crackdown|work=Foreign Policy In Focus|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These lockdowns were primarily put in place in order to prevent the leakage of cell phone videos that contained images of the violent government crackdown on protesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://act2.freepress.net/sign/dpi/|title=SaveTheInternet.com - Egypt's Internet Crackdown|work=freepress.net|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concerns with populism===
In a study conducted that interviewed elected officials in Austria's parliament, opinions were widely and strongly against e-democracy. They believed that the citizens were uninformed and that their only way of expressing their opinions should be to vote; sharing opinions and ideas was strictly the job of the elected.&lt;ref name="Mahrer 2005 27–42"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mahrer|first=Harold|author2=Krimmer |title=Towards the enhancement of e-democracy: identifying the notion of the 'middleman paradox' |journal=Information Systems Journal |date=Jan 2005|volume=15|issue=1|pages=27–42|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2575.2005.00184.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2575.2005.00184.x/abstract;jsessionid=244057EE72A095975A31F02661B74E78.f02t01 |accessdate=14 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=diffusion /&gt;

Alternatively, theories of [[epistemic democracy]] have indicated that more engagement of the populace has benefited the aggregation of knowledge and intelligence, and thus permitted democracies to track the truth better.

===Stop Online Piracy Act===
{{main|Stop Online Piracy Act}}
Many Internet users believed that Internet democracy was being attacked in the United States with the introduction of H.R. 3261, [[Stop Online Piracy Act|Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA)]], in the United States House of Representatives.&lt;ref name="fox"&gt;{{cite web|author=Brian Fox|title=Protecting Internet Democracy|date=30 Jan 2012|publisher=The Huffington Post|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brian-fox/protecting-internet-democ_b_1242483.html|accessdate=15 Dec 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Congressman Lamar. "H.R. 3261." Ed. Representatives, House of. Washington, DC: 112th Congress, 1st Session, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; A Huffington Post Contributor noted that the best way to promote democracy, including keeping freedom of speech alive, is through defeating the Stop Online Piracy Act.&lt;ref name="fox" /&gt; It is important to note that SOPA was postponed indefinitely after major protests arose, including by many popular websites such as Wikipedia, which launched a site blackout on January 18, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2012/01/20/technology/SOPA_PIPA_postponed/index.htm|title=Sopa and Pipa Postponed Indefinitely after Protests|publisher=CNN Money|author=Julianna Pepitone|date=24 Sep 2012|accessdate=15 Dec 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In India, a similar situation was noted at the end of 2011, when India's Communication and IT Minister Kapil Sibal suggested that offensive content may be privately "pre-screened" before being allowed on the Internet with no rules for redressal.&lt;ref name="mad" /&gt; However, more recent news reports quote Sibal as saying that there would be no restrictions whatsoever on the use of the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itnewsonline.com/news/Kapil-Sibal:-Internet-an-Indispensible-Tool-for-Governance-in-a-Free-Democracy/28482/8/1|title=IT News Online &gt; - Kapil Sibal: Internet an Indispensable Tool for Governance in a Free Democracy|work=itnewsonline.com|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government models==
{{see also|Varieties of democracy}}

===Representative democracy===
{{main|Representative democracy}}
The radical shift from representative government to internet-mediated direct democracy is not likely. However, proponents believe that a "hybrid model" that uses the internet to allow for greater government transparency and community participation in decision-making is on the horizon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Anttiroiko |first=Ari-Veikko |title=Building Strong E-Democracy—The Role of Technology in Developing Democracy for the Information Age |journal=Communications of the ACM |date=September 2003 |volume=46 |issue=9 |pages=121–128 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220422679_Building_strong_e-democracy_the_role_of_technology_in_developing_democracy_for_the_information_age/file/3deec51532440519a4.pdf |accessdate=14 December 2013 |doi=10.1145/903893.903926}}&lt;/ref&gt; Committee selection, local town and city decisions, and otherwise people-centric decisions would be more easily facilitated. The principles of democracy are not changing so much as the tools used to uphold them. E-democracy would not be a means to implement direct democracy, but rather a tool to enable more participatory democracy as it exists now.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sendag |first=Serkan |title=Pre-service teachers' perceptions about e-democracy: A case in Turkey |journal=Computers &amp; Education |year=2010 |volume=55 |pages=1684–1693 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131510002046 |accessdate=14 December 2013 |doi=10.1016/j.compedu.2010.07.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Virtual Democracy ===
Virtual Democracy is a global political system where people of all intelligent species and races gather to propose and vote on laws on internet forums like virtual-democracy.org and democratie-atlanta.org

This system was rediscovered by Lucian Ilea in January 2016 when he created a website with 9 domains and 63 subdomains featuring presentations of the Virtual Democracy system in both Romanian and English languages on democratie-virtuala.com and atlantia.online with the actual voting forums found on democratie-atlanta.org and virtual-democracy.org
In order to attract people there are sections devoted to music and film on muzica.space, pictures on e-world.site, and an online computer store found at ihl.space and ihl-data.com

The sites functioned for 2 years from January 2016 to November 2017.

===Electronic direct democracy===
{{see also|Direct democracy}}
Proponents of E-democracy sometimes envision a transition from a [[representative democracy]] to a [[direct democracy]] carried out through technological means, and see this transition as an end goal of e-democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fuller |first=Roslyn |date=2015 |title=Beasts and Gods: How Democracy Changed Its Meaning and Lost its Purpose |url=https://www.amazon.com/Beasts-Gods-Democracy-Changed-Meaning/dp/1783605421 |location=United Kingdom |publisher=Zed Books |page=371 |isbn=9781783605422 |author-link=Roslyn Fuller }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an Electronic [[direct democracy]] (EDD) (also known as [[open source governance]] or [[collaborative e-democracy]]), the people are directly involved in the [[legislative]] function by electronic means. Citizens [[electronic voting|electronically vote]] on legislation, author new legislation, and recall representatives (if any representatives are preserved).

Technology for supporting EDD has been researched and developed at the [[Florida Institute of Technology]],&lt;ref&gt;Kattamuri, et al. "Supporting Debates Over Citizen Initiatives", Digital Government Conference, pp 279-280, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; where the technology is used with student organizations. Numerous other software development projects are underway,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Active_projects List of active projects] involved in the Metagovernment project&lt;/ref&gt; along with many supporting and related projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Related_projects List of related projects] from the Metagovernment project&lt;/ref&gt; Several of these projects are now collaborating on a cross-platform architecture, under the umbrella of the Metagovernment project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Standardization Standardization project] of the Metagovernment project.&lt;/ref&gt;

EDD as a system is not fully implemented in a political government anywhere in the world, although several initiatives are currently forming. [[Ross Perot]] was a prominent advocate of EDD when he advocated "electronic [[town meeting|town halls]]" during his 1992 and 1996 [[President of the United States|Presidential]] campaigns in the [[United States]]. [[Politics of Switzerland|Switzerland]], already partially governed by direct democracy, is making progress towards such a system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swissworld.org/dvd_rom/eng/direct_democracy_2004/content/votes/e_voting.html|archivedate=7 April 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050407015504/http://www.swissworld.org/dvd_rom/eng/direct_democracy_2004/content/votes/e_voting.html|title=Electronic Voting in Switzerland|work=swissworld.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Senator On-Line]], an Australian political party established in 2007, proposes to institute an EDD system so that Australians can decide which way the senators vote on each and every bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title = Senator On-Line |url = http://senatoronline.com.au/ |accessdate = 3 June 2008 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080607140855/http://senatoronline.com.au/ |archivedate = 7 June 2008 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar initiative was formed 2002 in Sweden where the party [[Direktdemokraterna]], running for the [[Parliament of Sweden|Swedish parliament]], offers its members the power to decide the actions of the party over all or some areas of decision, or to use a proxy with immediate recall for one or several areas.

The first mainstream direct democracy party to be registered{{when|date=August 2017}} with any country's electoral commission [checked against each country's register] is the UK's [[People's Administration Direct Democracy]] party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paparty.co.uk|title=Direct Democracy|work=paparty.co.uk|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The People's Administration have developed and published the complete architecture for a legitimate reform to EDD [including the required Parliamentary reform process]. Established by musicians [including Alex Romane] and political activists, the People's Administration advocates using the web and telephone to enable the majority electorate to create, propose and vote upon all policy implementation. The People's Administration's blueprint has been published in various forms since 1998 and the People's Administration is the first direct democracy party to be registered in a vote-able format anywhere in the world - making the transition possible through evolution via election with legitimate majority support, instead of potentially through revolution via violence. The [[Direktdemokraterna]] party in Sweden also advocates EDD.

===Liquid democracy===
{{main|Liquid democracy}}
[[Liquid democracy]], or direct democracy with [[delegable proxy]], would allow citizens to choose a proxy to vote on their behalf while retaining the right to cast their own vote on legislation. The voting and the appointment of proxies could be done electronically. Taking this further, the proxies could form [[proxy chain]]s, in which if A appoints B and B appoints C, and neither A nor B vote on a proposed bill but C does, C's vote will count for all three of them. Citizens could also rank their proxies in order of preference, so that if their first choice proxy fails to vote, their vote can be cast by their second-choice proxy.

===Wikidemocracy===
One proposed form of e-democracy is "wikidemocracy", with a government legislature whose codex of laws was an editable wiki, like Wikipedia. J Manuel Feliz-Teixeira believes we have the resources to implement wikidemocracy today. He envisions a wiki-system in which there would be three wings of legislative, executive and judiciary roles for which every citizen could have a voice with free access to the wiki and a personal ID to continuously reform policies until the last day of December (when all votes would be counted).&lt;ref&gt;[http://paginas.fe.up.pt/~feliz/e_poster4_wiki-law-government.pdf Feliz-Teixeira, J Manuel. The Perfect Time for the Perfect Democracy? Some thoughts on wiki-law, wiki-government, online platforms in the direction of a true democracy. Porto, 11 March 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt; Advantages to wikidemocracy include a no-cost system with the removal of elections, no need for parliament or representatives because citizens directly represent themselves, and ease of access to voice one's opinion. However, there are obstacles, uncertainties and disagreements. First, the digital divide and low quality of education can be deterrents to achieve the full potential of a wikidemocracy. Similarly, there is a diffusion of innovation in response to new technologies in which some people readily adopt novel ways and others at the opposite end of the spectrum reject them or are slow to adapt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enablingchange.com.au/Summary_Diffusion_Theory.pdf Robinson, Les. A summary of Diffusion of Innovations. Fully revised and rewritten Jan. 2009. Enabling Change]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also uncertain how secure this type of democracy would be because we would have to trust that the system administrator would have a high level of integrity to protect the votes saved to the public domain. Lastly, Peter Levine agrees that wikidemocracy would increase discussion on political and moral issues, but he disagrees with Feliz-Teixeira who argues that wikidemocracy would remove the need for representatives and formal governmental structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peterlevine.ws/Internetdemocracy.htm|title=Democracy's Moment|work=peterlevine.ws|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wikidemocracy is also used to mean more limited instantiations of e-democracy, such as in Argentina in August 2011, where the polling records of the presidential election were made available to the public in online form, for vetting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/pablo-mancini/wiki-democracy-begins-in-_b_934331.html|title="Wiki" Democracy Begins In Argentina|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has also been used in a more general way to refer to the democratic values and environments offered by wikis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://getwiki.net/-The_Messiness_of_WikiDemocracy|title=GetWiki - The Messiness of WikiDemocracy|work=getwiki.net|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some in [[Finland]] recently undertook an experiment in wikidemocracy by creating a "shadow government program" on the Internet, essentially a compilation of the political views and aspirations of various groups in Finland, on a wiki.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ominvoimin.com/santas-little-helpers-wikidemocracy-in-finland/|title=Santa's Little Helpers: Wikidemocracy in Finland - Ominvoimin – ihmisten tekemää|work=ominvoimin.com|accessdate=17 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107053420/http://ominvoimin.com/santas-little-helpers-wikidemocracy-in-finland/|archivedate=7 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''E. J. Josey''' (January 20, 1924 – July 3, 2009) was an African-[[Americans|American]] [[activist]] and [[librarian]]. Josey was born Elonnie Junius Josey in [[Norfolk, Virginia]] to Willie and Frances Bailey Josey.&lt;ref&gt;Roger M. Valade III, ''The Essential Black Literature Guide'', Visible Ink, in association with the Schomburg Center, 1996; p. 204. {{ISBN|0787607347}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from [[Howard University]] in 1949 and received his [[Master's degree|master]]'s in [[History]] from [[Columbia University]] in 1950 and a master's in [[librarian]]ship from the [[University at Albany, SUNY]] in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;Goedeken 1998, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; From 1955 to 1959, he was Director of the Library of [[Delaware State College]], [[Dover, Delaware]], and from 1959–1966, he was Chief Librarian and Associate Professor at [[Savannah State University|Savannah State College]] in Savannah, Georgia. He also served on the staff of the [[Columbia University]] Library, Free Library of [[Philadelphia]], the [[New York Public Library]], and prior to his position at Delaware State College, he served as Instructor of [[Social Sciences]] and [[History]] from 1954–1955 at [[Savannah State University|Savannah State College]].

In 1966, Josey joined the New York State Education Department in its Division of Library Development as an Associate in the Bureau of Academic and Research Libraries . In 1968 he was promoted to Chief of the Bureau of Academic and Research Libraries and held that position until 1976 when he was appointed Chief, Bureau of Specialist Library Services, [[New York State Library]]. Josey was also Professor Emeritus, Department of Library and Information Science, School of Library and Information Sciences, [[University of Pittsburgh]].

==Memberships==
Active in the field of [[human rights]], he was a life member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ([[NAACP]]), and served as President of Albany, New York Branch from 1982–86. He also served as President of the Albany Branch of the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History. Active in community affairs, he also served as a member of the Board of Directors of the Albany County Opportunity, Inc., the local anti-poverty agency for four years.

A member of the [[American Library Association]] for 48 years, at the 1964 annual conference, he authored the resolution forbidding Association officers and staff from participating in state associations that deny membership to [[African Americans|black]] librarians. This action led to the integration of the library association of several Southern states, and he became the first black librarian to be accepted as a member of the Georgia Library Association.  In ''The Black Librarian in America'' (1970) Josey recalled the 1964 annual conference:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Much to my chagrin, the Mississippi Library Association was honored there for its National Library Week Activities. I exploded! I was seething with anger, for I remembered that three civil rights workers-Andrew Goodman, James Chaney, and Micheal Schwerner had been murdered and lay dead and buried somewhere in Mississippi, their bodies not yet discovered. I also remembered that the Mississippi Library Association had withdrawn from ALA rather than give membership to Negro Librarians.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He was first elected to the ALA Council, the policy making body of the Association in 1970 and served until the summer of 2000, a period of 29 years. In 1979, he was elected to a four-year term on the ALA Executive Board. From 1980–82, he served as Chair of the Cultural Minorities Task Force of the National Commission on Libraries and Information Science. Having served on numerous ALA Committees, he chaired the ALA Committee on Pay Equity, the ALA Committee on Legislation, and the ALA International Relations Committee several times.

Josey was the President of ALA in 1984–85.  At his inaugural address in 1984, Josey made this forward-thinking comment still applicable to libraries today: "The information industry has the technology to control information, but its price tag on information distribution and its profit goal create a bias in what information is made available and how it is dispensed.  Only the nonprofit organization, the library, dedicated to a total community service goal with trained experts, librarians, running the operation can provide the full scope of information for the total population in a fair and objective manner."

In the spring of 1987, he was elected to a 4-year term on the Board of Directors of the [[Freedom to Read Foundation]] and chaired the ALA International Relations Committee from 1987 to 1990. From 1990 to 1994 he served as the Chair of the ALA Legislation Committee. He returned to chair the ALA International Relations Committee for the next two years. In May and June, 1987, Professor Josey lectured in three African countries, [[Ethiopia]], [[Zimbabwe]], and [[Zambia]] under the auspices of the [[United States Information Agency]].

==Civil Rights activities==
During the early 1960s, he participated in the [[Civil Rights]] struggle in Savannah (see ''The Black Librarian in America'', pp.&amp;nbsp;308–11). He served on the Executive Board of the Savannah Branch of the NAACP as well as the Executive Board of the Albany, NY Branch of the NAACP.

In 1964 he carried the Civil Rights struggle into the American Library Association. In spite of the 1954 [[United States Supreme Court]] decision, which encouraged [[desegregation]] of libraries and ALA chapters, the ALA was slow in implementing integration of all of its southern chapters until Josey offered his resolution at the 1964 Conference which prevented ALA officers and staff members from attending [[Racial segregation|segregated]] state chapter meetings. The four remaining segregated chapters that denied membership to African-American librarians at that time were [[Alabama]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Louisiana]], and [[Mississippi]]; and they integrated immediately. He is well known for his uncompromising opposition to any form of [[discrimination]] whether it is [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]], [[gender]], age or [[sexual orientation]].

== Civil rights activism ==
Butts became involved in [[Civil rights movements|Civil Rights]] in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; During her time as the Oakwood Civic League, she helped create the Rosemont Middle School in her neighborhood so that children wouldn't have to ride the bus to the [[Racial segregation|segregated]] school.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In 1960, she was involved in picketing the Be-Lo Supermarket for not employing black people in higher-level positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/17403158/daily_press/|title=Norfolk Judge Halts Pickets at Be-Lo Store|last=|first=|date=1960-03-15|work=Daily Press|access-date=2018-02-13|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|pages=9|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also protested against black people being told to sit in certain parts of the football [[stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.omaha.com/news/metro/inspired-by-martin-luther-king-jr-bellevue-woman-s-mother/article_e8efbe9b-6aa7-5f83-ab7e-3f3bf4db8b7f.html|title=Inspired by Martin Luther King Jr., Bellevue woman's mother led the fight to end the poll tax|last=Nitcher|first=Emily|date=16 January 2017|work=Omaha.com|access-date=2018-02-13|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, Butts was chosen to run against the incumbent president of the Norfolk [[NAACP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/17403084/the_progressindex/|title=Disenters Challenge NAACP Vote|last=|first=|date=1961-03-14|work=The Progress-Index|access-date=2018-02-13|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|pages=10|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Butts withdrew when it became clear she would lose.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Butts and her lawyer, [[Joseph A.

Virginia State Board of Elections]]'', was decided in March of 1966, making poll taxes unconstitutional.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

After the Supreme Court decision, Butts went on to register black voters in Norfolk, signing up 2,882 "in one six month period."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/17401802/iowa_city_presscitizen/|title=Deaths Elsewhere|last=|first=|date=1993-03-12|work=Iowa City Press-Citizen|access-date=2018-02-13|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|pages=14|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Butts, along with Jordan and other community leaders, helped create the Concerned Citizens for Political Education group, which became a powerful political force in local politics in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Butts was appointed the commissioner of the [[Norfolk Redevelopment and Housing Authority]] (NRHA) in 1975.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/17402262/daily_press/|title=Black Coalition Outs Longtime Leader|last=|first=|date=1990-06-11|work=Daily Press|access-date=2018-02-13|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|pages=4|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; She would serve on the NRHA for twelve years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lva.virginia.gov/public/trailblazers/2009/honoree.asp?bio=2|title=Evelyn Butts (1924-1993), Norfolk Principal in a Case to Invalidate the Poll Tax|last=|first=|date=|website=The Library of Virginia African American Trailblazers 2009|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, she was appointed by the governor to the State Board of Housing and Community Development.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Butts ran for city council in Norfolk three times in 1980, 1982 and in 1984, but was never successful.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/17402190/daily_press/|title=Councilwoman to Run Again|last=|first=|date=1984-02-02|work=Daily Press|access-date=2018-02-13|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|pages=14|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Also in 1984, Butts was a witness in a court trial where she supported an [[at-large]] election system in Norfolk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/17402113/daily_press/|title=Black Activist Favors At-Large election System|last=|first=|date=1984-06-02|work=Daily Press|access-date=2018-02-13|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|pages=3|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Butts was forced into retirement from politics in 1990 when she was ousted as the chair of the Concerned Citizens for Political Education.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Butts died in her home on March 11, 1993.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; She is buried in Norfolk's Forest Lawn Cemetery.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14314">The '''Feed the Future Initiative''' ('''FTF''') was launched in 2010 by the United States government and the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama Administration]] to address global hunger and [[food security|food insecurity]]. According to the [[National Institute of Food and Agriculture]], it is "the U.S. government's global food security initiative."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 President [[Barack Obama]] committed $3.5 billion over a 3-year period to a global initiative with the intent of combatting hunger and poverty; in May 2010 the [[United States Department of State]] launched the Feed the Future Initiative.&lt;ref name="ftf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feedthefuture.gov/about |title=About &amp;#124; Feed the Future |publisher=Feedthefuture.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Initiative was developed by the Department of State and is coordinated primarily by the [[United States Agency for International Development|U.S. Agency for International Development]] (USAID).&lt;ref name="ftf" /&gt; The main objectives of the initiative are the advancement of global agricultural development, increased food production and food security, and improved nutrition particularly for vulnerable populations such as women and children.&lt;ref name="ftf" /&gt;

==Background==
It is estimated that globally almost one billion people currently experience chronic hunger.&lt;ref name="usaidart"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usaid.gov/what-we-do/agriculture-and-food-security/increasing-food-security-through-feed-future |title=Food Security: Feed the Future &amp;#124; U.S. Agency for International Development |publisher=Usaid.gov |date=2013-06-28 |accessdate=2013-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these people live in Sub-Saharan Africa and South East Asia where health and social problems resulting from chronic hunger are compounded by poverty and other health issues.&lt;ref name="psu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agsci.psu.edu/international/programs/ag2africa/GENERAL%20BACKGROUND%20ON%20FEED%20THE%20FUTURE%20INITIATIVE.pdf |title=General Background on Feed the Future Initiative |publisher=Agsci.psu.edu |accessdate=2013-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a world population of over seven billion people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/popclock/ |title=Population Clock |publisher=Census.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a predicted population of 9 billion people by 2050 &lt;ref name="ftf"/&gt;
&lt;ref name="psu"/&gt; global hunger and chronic malnutrition/under nutrition are expected to increase in developing countries. Based on these estimates the demand for food worldwide will increase by 40%-70% by 2050 depending on income growth in developing countries most effected by poverty and chronic health issues.&lt;ref name="psu"/&gt;

At the [[35th G8 summit|2009 G8 Summit]] in [[L'Aquila]], Italy, President of the United States Barack Obama announced a $10.15 billion commitment over 3 years to an initiative that would focus on reducing hunger and poverty in developing countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and South East Asia.&lt;ref name="psu"/&gt; The United States and other [[G8]] and [[G-20 major economies|G-20]] countries committed a total of over 20 billion USD.&lt;ref name="fas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41612.pdf |title=The Obama Administration's Feed the Future Initiative |publisher=Fao.org |accessdate=2013-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intent of the international commitment was to address food insecurity and poverty in a more comprehensive way; international efforts include supporting country-led plans for change, looking at root causes of food insecurity and poverty, increasing coordination with and the use of multi-lateral institutions, and approaching issues with the goal of increased sustainability and accountability&lt;ref name="psu"/&gt;

The United States' State Department, the coordinating agency for the Obama Administration's initiative on global hunger and food security, released the Global Hunger and Food Security Initiative Consultation Document on September 28, 2009.&lt;ref name="fas"/&gt; The document provided an overview of the initiative's priorities and strategy; in May 2010 the initiative was renamed "Feed the Future" and a new set of strategy documents and country and regional implementation guides were issued.&lt;ref name="ftf"/&gt;

Feed the Future's guide is based on five principles for sustainable food security that were first introduced at the 2009 G8 Summit and later endorsed at the [[World Summit on Food Security 2009|2009 World Summit on Food Security]] in Rome, Italy.&lt;ref name="fas"/&gt; In creating the guide the U.S. government received input through consultation with other countries, international foundations and institutions, private companies and farmers both nationally and internationally.&lt;ref name="fas"/&gt; The Feed the Future strategy guide includes three overarching themes throughout: gender/gender development, the environment/human ecology, and climate change.&lt;ref name="fas"/&gt; The two main objectives of the Feed the Future Initiative are: to accelerate agriculture sector growth, and to improve the nutritional status of people in the FtF focus and aligned countries.&lt;ref name="ftf"/&gt; The Initiative specifically focuses on using locally-adapted technologies to increase agricultural productivity and improve local, national and international markets for commodities produced.&lt;ref name="fas"/&gt;

According to Feed the Future's strategy guide,&lt;ref name="fas"/&gt; the Initiative's input and effects differ for each involved country due to FtF's policy of country-specific, country-owned implementation plans. Coordination of the Initiative is carried out by host country governments, the United States government's Global Health Initiative and other development partners to create a nutrition strategy for each country.&lt;ref name="fas"/&gt; The progress of each country's nutrition plan is measured by statistics collected; the decrease of [[stunted growth|stunted]] and [[wasting|wasted]] children as well as the prevalence of [[underweight]] women are indicators of improved nutritional status.&lt;ref name="fao"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/008/y5773e/y5773e04.htm |title=Nutrition Indicators for Development |publisher=Fao.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Titan2 color silo.jpg|thumb|right|Flexible response represented a capability to fight across all spectrums of warfare, not just with nuclear arms such as this [[LGM-25C Titan II|Titan II]] missile.]]'''Flexible response''' was a [[defense (military)|defense]] [[strategy]] implemented by [[John F. Kennedy]] in 1961 to address the Kennedy administration's skepticism of [[Dwight Eisenhower]]'s [[New Look (policy)|New Look]] and its policy of [[massive retaliation]]. Flexible response calls for [[mutual deterrence]] at strategic, tactical, and conventional levels, giving the [[United States]] the capability to respond to aggression across the spectrum of war, not limited only to [[nuclear arms]].

==History==
The New Look policy, though initially useful, quickly became obsolete with the introduction of [[ICBM|inter-continental delivery systems]] that undermined the credibility of a deterrence threat. The cornerstone of U.S. and European defense strategy was then threatened as the U.S. could no longer rely on nuclear threats to provide security for it and its allies.

John F. Kennedy won the [[President of the United States|presidency]] by claiming that the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] had allowed the U.S. to fall behind the Soviets into a [[missile gap]]. Upon entering office Kennedy cited [[General Maxwell Taylor|General Maxwell Taylor's]] book ''The Uncertain Trumpet'' to [[United States Congress|Congress]] for its conclusion that [[massive retaliation]] left the U.S. with only two choices: defeat on the ground or the resort to the use of nuclear weapons. Technology had improved since massive retaliation was adopted. Improvements in communication and transportation meant U.S. forces could be deployed more effectively, quickly, and flexibly than before. Advisers persuaded Kennedy that having multiple options would allow the president to apply the appropriate amount of force at the right place without risking escalation or losing alternatives. This would improve credibility for deterrence as the U.S. would now have low-intensity options and therefore would be more likely to use them, rather than massive retaliation's all-or-nothing options.

Flexible Response was implemented to develop several options across the spectrum of warfare, other than the nuclear option, for quickly dealing with enemy aggression. In addition, the survivability of the retaliatory capability was stressed, leading to the diversification of the strategic force, development of the [[nuclear triad|strategic triad]], and half the [[Strategic Air Command]] force being put on permanent alert status.

The Kennedy doctrine did not include the ability to fight nuclear wars because of the idea that it would undermine [[Deterrence theory|deterrence]], was technologically unworkable, would fuel the arms race, and was not politically feasible.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Importance was also placed on [[counterinsurgency]] and the development of [[Irregular military|unconventional military forces]], [[asymmetric warfare|unconventional tactics]], and "civic action" programs.

==Stages==
A staged plan was devised to counter any [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military action other than a first strike. It consisted of three stages:

'''''Direct defense''''': In case of a conventional Soviet attack (meaning non-nuclear or this would be considered a first strike) initial efforts would be to try and stop the Soviet advance with conventional weapons. This meant that the foreseen Soviet attack on [[West-Germany]] would be tried to be forced to a halt by [[NATO]]'s European forces, [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe|Allied Command Europe]].

'''''Deliberate Escalation''''': This phase would be entered when conventional NATO forces were succumbing under the Soviet attack. This was actually expected as intelligence indicated Soviet divisions outnumbered NATO divisions by far. In this phase NATO forces would switch to a limited use of nuclear weapons, such as recently developed [[tactical nuclear weapon]]s (like nuclear artillery).

'''''General Nuclear Response''''': This was the last phase or stage which more or less corresponded to the [[mutual assured destruction]] scenario, meaning the total nuclear attack on the Communist world. If the Soviets had not already done so, this would make them switch to all-out attack as well.

==Development of the strategic triad==
By 1960, the United States had three means of strategic forces: [[ICBM]]s, [[SLBM]]s, and [[strategic bomber]]s. This triad made it possible for the United States to impose unacceptable damage to the Soviet Union with one strategic force independent of the other two forces. These different forces had their advantages and disadvantages. Bombers could deliver large payloads and strike with great accuracy, but were slow, vulnerable while on the ground, and could be shot down. ICBMs are safe in their underground silos while on the ground, but were less accurate than bombers and could not be called back when launched. Submarines were least vulnerable but were also least accurate and communication could be poor at times. Each of these forces provided the United States with different options to tailor their response to the situation.

==Two-and-a-half war doctrine==
Part of Flexible response was the strategy of being able to fight over the entire spectrum of violence by developing diverse forces for different types of warfare.  This meant being able to fight multiple wars simultaneously; specifically, the US should have the peacetime capability to fight two large regional wars and a small [[brushfire war]] at the same time.  The consequence of this was to increase recruiting, investment, and research for the US force posture.

==Assured destruction==
The strategic doctrine for Kennedy's Flexible response was Assured destruction. Flexible response made [[second strike capability]] its guiding principle of deterrence. In the event of Soviet nuclear aggression, the Soviets would know that enough U.S. nuclear capability would survive their strike to destroy their cities and industry. [[Robert McNamara]] argued for the definition of what was "unacceptable" to the enemy as the destruction of 50% of industry and 25% of the population. Deterrence depended on influence to show that violence and aggression did not pay, and being explicit about the level of destruction the US was willing to inflict on the enemy was one way to illustrate this point. Assured Destruction relied on deterrence by punishment, precision, and credibility.

===No-cities doctrine===
Defense Secretary McNamara sought to limit damage to the U.S. by developing a separate strategy for offense and defense. The offensive strategy was one of [[Counterforce]], seeking to destroy Soviet military installations and hardware and thus disable this hardware before it could be used. In a 1962 speech to the [[University of Michigan, Ann Arbor]], McNamara announced that the U.S. would refrain from striking [[countervalue]] targets (cities) early in nuclear war, reserving such force later in war should the Soviets not show similar restraint. This would not only induce the Soviets to spare American cities, but would secure the United States bargaining advantage by holding hostage something that the Soviets might want to keep.

The defensive strategy involved developing a system to intercept incoming Soviet missiles. Bombers could be easily shot down, but missiles still remained a credible threat. As a result, the United States began developing an [[Anti-ballistic missile|anti-ballistic missile program]], modifying its [[Nike-Hercules Missile|Nike missiles]] to intercept incoming missiles. Ultimately, however, this program was abandoned by the adoption of the [[anti-ballistic missile treaty]].

'''Foreclosure Stripping''' is the process in which the owners of a [[Foreclosure|foreclosed]] property will remove fixtures and fittings from the property in an attempt to salvage some of their [[investment]]. '''Malicious foreclosure stripping''' is done by home owners who [[Vandalism|render damage]] throughout the property to significantly decrease its value and cause resale to be almost impossible. Foreclosure stripping has been a growing trend in recent years &lt;ref&gt;''Shriver Center'', 2006, https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:0KbsEbE9GNUJ:www.povertylaw.org/about-us/newsroom/news-releases/mar-apr-review.pdf+%22foreclosure+stripping%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESgcp7hOq843NCh-Jz6Fi6Tlk2R0b6vgzRT05e9JI1loTAn9A9Ud3kBFzvkEsLOEsrUA70kQb33MTMPPsMdrX2Jvk8vxnXpfdcwlgHr6w6NPLYPSVGPnaikRC490W11oP1mVhEUM&amp;sig=AHIEtbREIZNIiWG2sFoAVFCCJpsZ7A_cUQ&lt;/ref&gt; and has reached an all-time high in 2009 because of the [[Economic downturn of 2008|economic downturn]].

==Problems with foreclosure stripping==
The main problem associated with foreclosure stripping is [[devaluation]] of property in the local area.&lt;ref&gt;''Naples News'', June 2009, http://www.naplesnews.com/news/2009/jun/24/sale-anything-and-everything-inside-foreclosed-hom/&lt;/ref&gt;  Because homes are being sold as incomplete, the prices are much lower than others in the area, which brings down the local average [[property value]]. Foreclosure stripping is also a problem for [[bank]]s, as [[mortgages]] are unavailable on incomplete properties meaning that for resale to occur, a cash buyer is necessary.

==Penalties of foreclosure stripping==
Foreclosure stripping is considered a [[crime]] in most states and goes against the details of the foreclosure deed signed by the home owner although some would argue that the home remains with the owner until the date at which it is officially signed over to the bank.&lt;ref&gt;. ''The Wall Street Journal'', March 2008, http://www.realestatejournal.com/buysell/markettrends/20080331-phillips.html?rejpartner=newsfeed_res&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''St. Petersburg Times'', February 2008, http://www.sptimes.com/2008/02/19/Business/In_home_foreclosure__.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, banks have just recovered the cost of the damage from their [[insurance broker]]s, and the perpetrators have never been prosecuted.  But recent cases have seen thieves convicted of [[burglary]], a class 4 [[felony]].  States such as [[Arizona]] have their own [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] task force to investigate and arrest those guilty of property stripping.&lt;ref&gt;''Arizona Republic'', September 2009, http://www.azcentral.com/members/Blog/CatherineReagor/61734"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Arizona Republic'', September 2009, http://www.azcentral.com/12news/news/articles/2009/09/08/20090908junkyhomes0908-CP.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Items that legally must remain with the foreclosed home==
Any item that is a built-in feature of the home must remain intact.&lt;ref&gt;The ''Oakland Press'', February 2009, http://www.theoaklandpress.com/articles/2009/02/07/news/local_news/doc498e7101415bd940026850.txt&lt;/ref&gt;  This includes:

* Built in appliances such as [[stovetop]]s and [[dishwasher]]s
* Cabinets, shelving and countertops throughout the property
* Built in [[air conditioning]] units and [[furnace]]s
* Plumbing and copper pipes
* Electrical wiring and fixtures including outlets, lighting and [[ceiling fan]]s
* Doors and associated hardware
* Flooring, including tiles, carpets and decking
* Windows and vents
* Sinks, tubs, toilets, showers and associated hardware
* [[Landscaping]] and fencing
* Built in pools and spas

'''''Freedom: The Underground Railroad''''' is a 2013 [[Cooperative board game|co-operative board game]] designed by Brian Mayer and published by Academy Games, their first game in the Freedom Series. The game has drawn positive attention for its approach and handling of the topic.&lt;ref name='Pittsburg Post Gazette.3.10.14'&gt;{{cite news | first = Jon Chavez | last = Chavez | title = Ohio company making a mark with historical strategy games | date = 2014-03-10 | url = http://www.post-gazette.com/business/2014/03/11/Ohio-company-making-a-mark-with-historical-strartegy-games/stories/201403100130  | work = Pittsburg Post Gazette | accessdate = 2014-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='U.S. Studies Online.6.23.14'&gt;{{cite news | first = Alex Bryne | last = Bryne | title = Historians at Play: American History in Modern Board Games | date = 2014-06-24 | url = http://usstudiesonline.com/historians-at-play/  | work = U.S. Studies Online | accessdate = 2014-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Opinionated Gamers|url=http://opinionatedgamers.com/2014/08/26/freedom-the-underground-railroad/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A card-driven, co-operative game set in early American History, ''Freedom: The Underground Railroad'' has players working together for the [[Abolitionist Movement]] to help bring an end to [[slavery]] in the United States. The players use a combination of cards, which feature historical figures and events spanning from [[American independence|early independence]] until the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and contain action tokens and character benefits which impact the game. The game can be played solo or up to four players, each playing one of six possible archetypes from the abolitionist movement: agent, conductor, preacher, shepherd, station master, or stockholder.

Several small card expansions, also designed by Mayer, were released with the [[Kickstarter]] version, each adding several new cards to the Abolitionist Deck.

==Gameplay==
The first goal that players need to achieve in ''Freedom: The Underground Railroad'' are to help a certain number of slaves make their way northward to freedom in [[Canada]]. How many varies depends on the number of players and the difficulty level of the game. The second winning condition is that the group needs to collectively raise the strength of the Abolitionist Movement, helping to bring about more permanent changes, by acquiring all of the support tokens in the game.

''Freedom: The Underground Railroad'' components consists of a game board representing connections between cities and spaces on the map of the United States, three decks of cards (Role cards, Abolitionist cards, and Slave Market cards), five slave catcher tokens, 110 wooden cubes representing the men, women and children trapped in slavery, slave catcher movement dice, action tokens (support, fundraising, and conductor), money, and a lead player token. The Abolitionist cards are broken up into three eras (1800-1839, 1840-1859, 1860-1865) and feature historical events and individuals from those eras that impacted the fight for freedom, both positively and negatively. General Abolitionist cards are used when acquired, Reserve Abolitionist cards can be held onto until an opportune time, and Opposition cards work against the players in various ways. At the start of the game, Opposition cards are distributed throughout the three era decks. Players are given a random role at the beginning of the game.

There are 8 rounds in the game, each consisting of five phases:&lt;br /&gt;
1. '''Slave Catcher Phase''' - the lead player rolls and resolves the Slave Catcher and Movement Dice.&lt;br /&gt;
2. '''Planning Phase''' - Each player may take up to a total of two action tokens.&lt;br /&gt;
3. '''Action Phase''' - Starting with the lead player, players may take the following actions in any order:
* Play an action token
* Play a second action token
* Buy and resolve one Abolitionist Card
* Gain the benefit of the player's Role Card
* Use the player's Role Card one time Special Ability
4. '''Slave Market Phase''' - Deliver slaves from the bottom Slave Market card to the plantations.&lt;br /&gt;
5. '''Lantern Phase''' - Discard any card in the right most space of the Abolitionist Queue (2 spaces for the solo or 2-player game), possibly triggering any Opposition cards in those spaces. Check for victory, if not pass the Lead Player token and continue.

The game is over if any of the following occur:
*The 8th round ends without reaching both victory conditions - a loss for the players.
*The Slaves Lost track fills up and another slave is lost - a loss for the players.
*The players achieve both victory conditions and finish the current round without losing too many slaves - a victory for the players.

==Expansions==
* ''Freedom: The Underground Railroad'' – Abolitionist Cards: a mini-expansion that adds cards for each of the three eras, including [[Samuel Joseph May]], [[Josiah Henson]], [[Thomas Garrett]], [[Anna Elizabeth Dickinson]], [[John Parker Hale]], [[Robert Purvis]], [[Secession in the United States|Southern Secession]], [[Alexander Milton Ross]], [[Anna Elizabeth Dickinson]], [[American Anti-Slavery Society]], and Hundred Conventions Project.
* ''Freedom: The Underground Railroad'' – Opposition Cards: a mini-expansion that adds new Opposition cards to be used with the game, including: [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marhalls]], [[Pennsylvania Hall (Philadelphia)|Pennsylvania Hall]], Tough Crossing, and a second [[Fugitive Slave Act]] card. 
* ''Freedom: The Underground Railroad'' – Reserve Cards: a mini-expansion that adds new Reserve cards for each of the three eras, including: [[The Quakers]], [[Personal liberty laws|Personal Liberty Laws]], [[Principles of '98]], and [[Grapevine (gossip)|Slave Grapevine]].

==Educational use==
''Freedom: The Underground Railroad'' is the topic of a first book in a series of books being published by [[Rosen Publishing]], centered on the use of games as educational resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''General Conference''' of the [[United Methodist Church]] is the denomination's top legislative body for all matters affecting the United Methodist connection.

The ''[[Book of Discipline (United Methodist)|Book of Discipline]]'' and [[constitution]] of The United Methodist Church define the composition of the General Conference as no less than 600 and no more 1,000 delegates, half [[laity]] and half [[clergy]].  These delegates are elected by the [[Annual Conferences of the United Methodist Church|Annual Conferences]] and several other specialized bodies within the structure of The United Methodist Church.

The General Conference meets on a quadrennial basis, that is, once every four years.  Special sessions may be called by the [[United Methodist Council of Bishops|Council of Bishops]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Book of Discipline of The United Methodist Church'', 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislative committees==   
[[Image:Opening Worship GC2008.jpg|thumb|300px|upright|left|Opening Worship at 2008 General Conference]]
Petitions are assigned to legislative committees based on their content.  Legislative committees elect committee leadership and then break into subcommittees to review and refine legislation.  Subcommittees bring petitions before the entire committee with the recommendation to reject, adopt, or adopt as amended.  During consideration by the entire committee, additional amendments may be made.  Then, the entire committee votes to recommend to the General Conference (the almost 1000 delegates) what action should be taken on the legislation.  No action is final until taken by the General Conference in plenary session.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Background ==
Research&lt;ref name="TCQ"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bai|first1=Limin|title=Graduate Unemployment: Dilemmas and Challenges in China's Move to Mass Higher Education |journal=The China Quarterly|date=March 2006|volume=185|issue=1|pages=128–144|jstor=20192579|registration=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; undertaken proved that unemployment and underemployment of graduates are devastating phenomena in their lives. A high incidence of either are indicators of institutional ineffectiveness and inefficiency. Since the beginning of the economic recession in the US economy in 2007, an increasing number of graduates have been unable to find permanent positions in their chosen field. According to statistics, the unemployment rate for recent college graduates has been higher than all college graduates in the past decade, implying that it has been more difficult for graduates to find a job in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;College graduates are those aged 22 to 65 with a bachelor's degree or higher; recent college graduates are those aged 22 to 27 with a bachelor's degree or higher.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abel|first1=Jaison R|last2=Deitz|first2=Richard|last3=Su|first3=Yaqin|title=Are Recent College Graduates|journal=Current Issues in Economics and Finance|date=2014|volume=20|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; One year after graduation, the unemployment rate of 2007–2008 bachelor's degree recipients was 9%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lib.xjtlu.edu.cn/|title=XJTLU Library Home Page|work=xjtlu.edu.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt; Underemployment among graduates is high. Educated unemployment or underemployment is due to a mismatch between the aspirations of graduates and employment opportunities available to them.

Aggravating factors for unemployment are the rapidly increasing quantity of international graduates competing for an inadequate number of suitable jobs, schools not keeping their [[curriculum]]s relevant to the job market, the growing pressure on schools to increase access to education (which usually requires a reduction in educational quality), and students being constantly told that an academic degree is the only route to a secure future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last =Coates| first =Ken| last2 =Morrison| first2 =Bill| author2-link =| title =Dream Factories: Why Universities Won't Solve the Youth Jobs Crisis| place =Toronto| publisher =Dundurn Press| year =2016| pages =232| url =https://www.dundurn.com/books/Dream-Factories| isbn =978-1459733770 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Investment risk ===
College and Universities cost thousands of dollars a semester, not including study materials, books, room, and board. Tuition has gone up 1,120 percent in the last thirty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Watson|first=Bruce|title=The high cost of higher education explained in one simple graphic|url=http://www.dailyfinance.com/on/college-costs-tuition-rising-student-debt-infographic/|accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students have been given the impression that employers are looking for people who, through tests and grades, have demonstrated that they are high achievers. In many recent surveys, that has been proved otherwise. Employers are looking for people who have learned how to learn, and have gained substantial communication skills as well as critical thinking abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sternberg|first=Robert J.|title=Giving employers what they don't really want|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Giving-Employers-What-They/139877?cid=megamenu|work=Chronicle of Higher Education|accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graduates are not meeting employers needs. Students are also struggling to pay off their student loans. Without the desired, and needed jobs, graduates are accumulating debt and struggling to pay back their loans. 15 percent of the student borrowers default within the first three years of repayment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lanza |first=Allesandra |title=Get the facts about struggling student loan borrowers |url=https://www.usnews.com/education/blogs/student-loan-ranger/2014/05/07/get-the-facts-about-struggling-student-loan-borrowers |work=U.S. News &amp; World Report |accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many resort to returning to live with their parents and having to work multiple part-time jobs. Loans average about twenty to thirty thousand dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ludden|first=Jennifer|title=College grads struggle to gain financial footing|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/05/10/152354154/college-grads-struggle-to-gain-financial-footing|accessdate=28 July 2013|publisher=NPR|date=May 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Higher education becomes an investment in which students are expecting to find a job with enough income to pay off the loans in a timely manner.

== Graduate unemployment by nation ==

=== United States ===
In June 2013, 11.8 million persons were unemployed, putting the unemployment rate at 7.6 percent. The state of the economy is a large contributor to these numbers. In June, 2001 the unemployment rate was 4.6% &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Unemployment rate of 4.7 percent lowest since July 2001 - Feb.  3, 2006|url = http://money.cnn.com/2006/02/03/news/economy/jobs_january/|website = money.cnn.com|accessdate = 2015-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 9/11/2001, the unemployment rate skyrocketed to 5.7% in November 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = U.S. unemployment highest in six years - Dec. 7, 2001|url = http://money.cnn.com/2001/12/07/economy/economy/|website = money.cnn.com|accessdate = 2015-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and rose drastically in 2009 to 10% in October.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bureau of Labor Statistics Data|url = http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000|website = data.bls.gov|accessdate = 2015-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September, 2015, unemployment is reported by the Labor Department to be at 5.1%.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; However, some economists dispute that as accurate and claim that unemployment is much higher due to the number of people who have stopped looking for jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Why The 'Real' Unemployment Rate Is Higher Than You Think|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/dandiamond/2013/07/05/why-the-real-unemployment-rate-is-higher-than-you-think/|website = Forbes|accessdate = 2015-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of jobs available, and skills desired by employers, are beginning to prove to be another major cause for graduate unemployment in the U.S. Graduates are completing school with a degree and a head full of knowledge, but still lack work experience to impress white-collar employers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lawrence|first=John|title=Today’s college graduates: In debt and unable to find a job|url=http://obrag.org/?p=74116|accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====College major by underemployment rate====
College majors ranked in ascending order by the percentage of college graduates with degrees in those fields who are employed in jobs that do not require a college degree. Data is from the [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York]], the [[United States Census Bureau]], and the [[American Community Survey]]. Note: The unemployment and underemployment rates are for recent college graduates (between the ages 22 and 27).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/college-labor-market/college-labor-market_compare-majors.html|title=Outcomes by Major|work=The Labor Market for Recent College Graduates|publisher=[[Federal Reserve Bank of New York]]|date=January 12, 2018|accessdate=January 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
A 2016 labour market assessment by the [[Parliamentary Budget Officer]] reported that the underemployment rate for undergraduates under the age of 35 increased from 32% in 1991 to 39% in 2015. The equivalent rate for [[College (Canada)|college]] graduates was similar until 2006. Since then it has fallen to 33%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A 2017 study from [[Statistics Canada]] showed that, for both men and women, more than 24% of undergraduates in [[the arts]], the humanities, the [[social science]]s and the [[behavioral sciences]] are underemployed. In [[nursing]], [[engineering]], education and training, and computer and information science, the underemployment rate is less than 8%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== China ===
The [[labor market|markets]] for [[China]]'s graduates share much in common with those of other countries. China's recent upsurge in graduate unemployment relates to a number of things. One important aspect is its education policy-making and '''[[economic development]]''' as well as reforms in the economy and in its higher education. Recently the annual growth in the numbers of new graduates was estimated at 7,270,000 for 2014. It has been stated that the rate of young unemployed graduates should logically bring about a withdrawal from higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eol.cn/html/c/2014gxbys/index.shtml|title=2014高校毕业生人数_中国高校毕业生增长趋势_2014大学毕业生人数―就业频道―中国教育在线|work=eol.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 8% annual growth, the Chinese labor market will generate about eight million jobs, but these are mainly in manufacturing and require low-level qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stats.gov.cn/english/|title=National Bureau of Statistics of China|work=stats.gov.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rising enrollment made employment an issue and a serious challenge for China. Including the graduates who are not employed last year, the number of unemployed graduates may reach 8,100,000. However, in the first half of 2014, there were 67,000 Chinese private businesses failing. These businesses employed 34.2 percent of the graduates in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sundxs.com/dxslz/jiuye/8197.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, it was estimated that at least 600,000 graduates from the prior year had yet to find employment. This is in addition to the approximately 7 million students who were leaving their universities with the desire to enter the workforce immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/02/22/youth-unemployment-in-china-a-crisis-in-the-making/|title=Youth Unemployment in China: A Crisis in the Making?|author=Guest Post|work=The Blaze}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the study ''2010 Chinese College Students Employment Report'' it named 15 professions that had the highest unemployment percentages in China. The survey said that, between 2007–2009, for three consecutive years, law majors had one of the highest unemployment rates for a bachelor's degree. Another field of high unemployment for the last three consecutive years was in the fields of computer science and technology. In many of China's universities, professions majoring in English have had a high level of unemployment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.douban.com/group/topic/20402781/|title=中国大学失业率最高15个专业|work=douban.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tendency was still occurring during 2010 to 2013.

==== Historical sketch ====

===== Education policy-making =====
From 1900 to 1911, China abolished the [[civil service examination]] system and established a [[education in the People's Republic of China|modern schooling system]] based on [[education in the United States|Western models]].
*In 1922 China adopted the American model, and this dominated the Chinese higher education system until 1949.
*In 1952 all of the higher education institutions were brought under the jurisdiction of the communist government, and the Soviet model was adopted to restructure China's higher education system in order to serve the manpower needs for building a socialist China.
*In 1958 China made its first attempt to expand the higher education sector by establishing more than 23,500 after-hours part work, part study colleges, in order to make an ambitious economic growth plan possible - the so-called Great Leap Forward for Socialist Construction.
*After 1978, with the end of the [[Cultural Revolution]] of 1966–76, China restored its higher education system and started educational reforms along with the move to a market-oriented socialist economy.&lt;ref&gt;Limin Bai, [http://www.victoria.ac.nz/saelc/staff/limin-bai.aspx] "Graduate Unemployment: Dilemmas and Challenges in China's Move to Mass Higher Education", ''The China Quarterly'', 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985 the central government announced its reform plan, and embarked upon a decentralization process which gave local government and higher education institutions more autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;Zheng Xiaochun, A Look Back on the Reform of Higher Education and Future Prospects, Research on Higher Education, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1993 the government launched further reform measures to increase accessibility to higher education, and a "user-pay" system was implemented along with fundamental changes in the job assignment system.
*From 1993 to 1998, higher education developed on the basis of numbers being controlled and limited, and quality being improved. The unduly low proportion of students in the tertiary sector brought out the negative impact on Chinese economic growth.
*In 1998, the [[Declaration of the World Conference on Higher Education]] organized by [[UNESCO]][http://www.unesco.org/education/wche/declaration.shtml] in Paris made the Chinese government aware that a rapid increase in the enrollment figures in higher education would be a way to respond to the needs of opening up and meeting the requirements of economic and social development.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank, ''The Reform of Higher Education in China'', China Financial &amp; Economic, Beijing, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1999 the government decided to accelerate the pace of expansion, and enrollments in higher education institutions increased dramatically and continuously. The enrollment number in 1999 was 1,678,000 which increased 47% by 1998. In 2004 the number is 4,473,400 with the rate of 17.05%&lt;ref name="TCQ"/&gt; Student numbers climbed from 7.23 million in 2000 to 9.31 million in 2001 and 11.46 million in 2002. The figure in 2004 indicated almost four times as many enrollments as in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Planning and Development of the Chinese Ministry of Education, Statistical Report on Education in China, Beijing, February 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; And according to Limin Bai, the establishment of the elite universities project called "211", using large amounts of government funding,  made it difficult for non-elite colleges to survive. This caused an increase in tuition fees and affected the quality of higher education, which in turn influenced the employment of graduates.&lt;ref&gt;Limin Bai,[http://www.victoria.ac.nz/saelc/staff/limin-bai.aspx] Graduate Unemployment:Dilemmas and Challenges in China's Move to Mass Higher Education, The China Quarterly,2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Economic development =====
Since 1978, the government has been reforming its economy from a Soviet-style centrally [[planned economy]] to a more market-oriented economy to increase productivity, living standards, and technological quality without exacerbating inflation, unemployment, and budget deficits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/EXTRESEARCH/0,,contentMDK:20634060~pagePK:64165401~piPK:64165026~theSitePK:469382,00.html Fighting Poverty: Findings and Lessons from China’s Success] (World Bank). Retrieved August 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

China’s economy regained momentum in the early 1990s. [[Asian financial crisis|The Asian Financial Crisis of 1998–99]] influenced the economy by slowing growth and as a consequence experts submitted proposals to state organs to stimulate economic recovery. This involved increasing student numbers and intensifying the modification of education as a way of stimulating internal consumption.

===== The unemployment rate of graduates =====
In 2008, the unemployment rate of graduates was more than 30%.&lt;ref name="universityworldnews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20090409203634912|title=CHINA: Graduate unemployment on the rise - University World News|work=universityworldnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this year the unemployment rate of graduates from top universities was 10%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20121130001015132&amp;query=China+unemployment|title=Universities must better prepare young people for labour market|work=University World News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the employment rate of graduates who had bachelor's degree was in the 88% range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statista.com/statistics/280947/employment-rate-of-university-graduates-in-china/|title=China: employment rate of university graduates 2014 - Statistic|work=Statista}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the employment rate of college graduates rose 3.2% in 2009 reaching 91.2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.cntv.cn/program/china24/20111125/102834.shtml|title=Graduates: Aim lower to shoot higher in job-hunting|work=cntv.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

in 2012, Prime Minister Zhu warned that increased foreign competition brought by China's entry into the [[World Trade Organization]] could lead to a doubling of the official urban unemployment rate over the next few years from 3.5% to 7%, or around 30 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1881153.stm|title=BBC News - BUSINESS - China's unemployment challenge|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, data released by the Chinese government indicated that the rate of graduate unemployment was 33.6%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.cntv.cn/2014/05/14/VIDE1400019242153138.shtml|title=2013 graduate students' employment rate at 67.4% - CCTV News - CCTV.com English|author=Zhang Jingya|work=cntv.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, based on official Chinese date, roughly 15% of the new grads are unemployed six months after graduation. However, Cheng, a professor of political science states the authentic unemployment is actually 2.3 million which means the rate is around 30%.&lt;ref name="bbc.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-28062071|title=What do you do with millions of extra graduates?|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Summary =====
China's higher education system prior to the 1999 expansion was not prepared for large-scale growth as it was basically characterized as "education for examinations," and the reforms in the 1990s did not change this feature. The lack of diversity in curricula at different levels and in different divisions of higher education determined that graduates lacked the specialty and the flexibility to respond to market demand. Moreover, before the 1999 expansion, a national job market had not yet been established. With a focus on immediate economic growth, the policy makers appear to have made the 1999 expansion decision without a big picture of the future structure of China's market-oriented economy, and without knowing in which economic sectors manpower needs would increase.

===== Regional disparities =====
China has had a long history of regional disparities, and disparities between urban and rural areas. Disparities in economic development are paralleled by disparities in higher education: top universities, for instance, are all located in those regions such as Shanghai, Beijing and Shenzhen. Such disparities in education are reflected in both quality and quantity.&lt;ref name="TCQ"/&gt; In addition, [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]] Institute of Sociology and Social Sciences Documentation Publishing House jointly published the social blue book ''2014 Chinese Social Situation Analysis and Prediction'',&lt;ref&gt;Li Peilin, Chen Guangjin, Zhang Yi, Society of China analysis and forecast (2014), Blue book of China's society, Beijing, December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; which released a set of employment survey reports based on 1678 graduates from 12 universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bjnews.com.cn/news/2013/12/27/299400.html|title=社科院：农村家庭本科生失业率达30%|work=bjnews.com.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt; As is shown in the blue book, two months after graduation, the unemployment rate of undergraduates from rural families is higher than undergraduates from urban families, which is 30.5%.

===== Measures taken by the government to solve the problem =====
The Chinese government has taken some measures to try to solve the crisis and it hopes injecting huge investments into the economy will create jobs and relieve much of the pressure. But some experts predict that building infrastructure will only provide manual jobs for ordinary workers and will not benefit college graduates.

Another measure is to boost [[postgraduate]] enrollments. The [[Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China]] plans to expand enrollments of masters students by 5% and doctoral students by 1.7%. Given the decline in jobs, many graduates will choose to study further and this year almost 1.25 million first degree-holders will be taking the [[postgraduate]] entrance examinations.

Yet expanding  [[postgraduate]] enrollments cannot solve the problem of graduate unemployment as it can only offer some relief or postpone the current employment pressure. Indeed, in recent years, employment of [[master's degree]] graduates has become problematic.
Diverting graduates to rural areas is a third measure. But a vast gap exists between urban and rural areas in terms of developmental level, opportunities, and living conditions. Thus, most graduates prefer to work in cities.

To encourage them to go to the countryside, the government has come up with policies such as preferential treatment when graduates (after two years service) apply to become government officials, or extra points are added to their scores in examinations for graduate study. But these policies are not attractive given the low salaries graduates earn in country areas.

The Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China has recently been calling for the whole society, including overseas Chinese, to contribute ideas to improve education overall. Promoting creative and vocational education has been raised as a way of providing new graduates with creative education and job skills to meet the needs of the market and to face the challenges of a changing world in the decades to come.

Perhaps this approach constitutes a more fundamental strategy that will eventually solve the graduate employment problem, although the impact is likely to take many years to become apparent.&lt;ref name="universityworldnews.com"/&gt; China's education department has already stated clearly that it wants to turn 600 universities into polytechnics, in order to give students more technical and employment-related curriculum, instead of only providing academic and theoretical subjects.&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt;

===== Criticism of graduate unemployment =====
The employment situation for new college graduates is different from the working population in general. The graduate unemployment crisis in China represents a wasteful investment of scarce resources. Large sums of money have consequently been invested in educating unemployed graduates which could otherwise have been invested in job-creating productive programmes. With a flood of new graduates, individuals are having a tough time finding jobs in an increasingly competitive labor market. Furthermore， it produces permanent scars on youth. Farlie and Kletzer (1999) estimated that being unemployed while young results in lower future earnings by a magnitude of 8.4% and 13.0% for males and females, respectively. Meanwhile, graduates have some negative expectations under the pressure of seeking jobs. [[Nanjing Normal University]] has surveyed students who expected to graduate in 2006 about "College Student's Attitudes about Job Seeking and Career". 44.21% prefer to get an employment contract first, then consider pursuing a new job position which is what they really desire to be employed for an average of 2 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Salik|first1=Madiha|last2=Zhiyong|first2=Zhu|last3=Guoyuan|first3=Sang|last4=Jiayong|first4=Li|title=Making People Employable: Reforming Higher Education in China|url=http://www.savap.org.pk/journals/ARInt./Vol.5(2)/2014(5.2-31).pdf|website=savap.org.pk |publisher=Institute for International and Comparative Education, Beijing Normal University,  Beijing, CHINA.|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon not only causes [[underemployment]] and high turnover in the job market, but also, graduates will have lower levels of job satisfaction, work commitment, job involvement and internal work motivation. Obviously, these of problems will bring more risks for employers as well.

Another widespread criticism is that, since the acceleration of enrollment starting from 1999, many schools, which were originally vocational ones, have been turned into universities. This has resulted in the number of university increasing greatly, which also means an increase in graduates with university degrees. But the truth is that the quality of these students' education is often even lower than vocational school graduates. The reason is that vocational school graduates have technical abilities which university graduates often lack. It's quite common that universities often put more emphasis on academic research rather than teaching practical skills required for jobs, which employers often value. What is more, some employers only pay attention to graduates from prestigious universities, which result in the decrease of competences of normal college graduates. In order to solve this, it is said that the Chinese government is considering restoring these so-called ''Sanben'' universities to what they originally were.

===== Responses to criticism =====
Graduate unemployment will be more likely to promote [[postgraduate]] school education. Half of graduates would like to consider attending postgraduate schools to enhance their ability to seek expert jobs. Government interventions are designed to alleviate graduate unemployment by encouraging young job seekers to "Go west, go down to where motherland and people are in greatest need."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chinadevelopmentbrief.com/node/1165&lt;/ref&gt;

[[China Youth Daily|''The China Youth Daily'']] has reported that some graduates have worked for years in villages of Hainan, China’s most southerly province. In 2003, the Communist Youth League recruited over 50,000 graduates to provide volunteer service in education, health care, agriculture, and cultural development in western provinces. As well as receiving a stipend, a State Council circular issued in 2005 promised the graduate volunteers preferential policies in civil service tests and graduate school entrance exams. Moreover, graduates had an opportunity to be self-employed as the Chinese government launched policies which were formulated to encourage college graduates to carve out their own future.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang Linbin, "Globalization and Its Effects on Youth Employment in China", Ministry of Labor and Social Security of People's Republic of China&lt;/ref&gt; However, many college graduates remain underemployed or unemployed even after completing their advanced degree.

===United Kingdom===
A study in 2017 from the [[HECSU|Higher Education Careers Services Unit]] has found a wide range, six months after graduation, in the proportion of graduates who are either in full-time employment or studying for an advanced degree. There is an even wider range in the proportion of graduates who are employed in such occupations as cashier or waiter. The following table shows selected data from this study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Europe ===
According to a 2002 survey of more than 30,000 graduates from 10 European countries about 3–4 years after graduation, only a minority of 10–20% of graduates face substantial problems in the labor market or end up in positions not commensurate with their level of education. There is a clear North-South differential in Europe with respect to transition and objective employment measures, while the pattern is more differentiated with respect to the perceived utilisation of knowledge, the self-rated adequacy of position and the job satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;Teichler, U.(2002). Graduate Employment and Work in Europe: Diverse Situations and Common Perceptions, Tertiary Education and Management&lt;/ref&gt;

Among [[OECD]] nations in 2013, the worst unemployment rates for graduates were in by Greece, Spain and Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

The '''Greek Volunteer Guard''' ([[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Serbian Cyrillic]]: Грчка Добровољачка Гарда; [[Greek language|Greek]]: Ελληνική Εθελοντική Φρουρά) was a unit of [[Greeks|Greek]] volunteers that fought in the [[Bosnian War]] on the side of the [[Army of the Republika Srpska]]. Some members of the unit are alleged to have been present in the area of the  [[Srebrenica Massacre]] and reportedly hoisted a [[Greek flag]] over the town on [[Ratko Mladić]]'s instigation.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[http://www.srebrenica.nl/Content/NIOD/English/srebrenicareportniod_en.pdf#2787 NIOD: ''Srebrenica.

Retrieved 31 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first detachment of Greek volunteers in [[Bosnia]] arrived in 1993. In March 1995, the Greek Volunteer Guard (ΕΕΦ), a contingent of one hundred {{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} Greek [[paramilitaries]] formed at the request of the Chief of Staff of the Bosnian Serb Army [[Ratko Mladić]], became a regular fighting unit of the Drina Corps with its own insignia, a white double-headed eagle on a black background.  The unit, led by Serb officers, was based in [[Vlasenica]], a town in the [[Drina Valley]].&lt;ref name="Koknar"&gt;{{cite news|last=Koknar|first=Ali M.|title=The Kontraktniki : Russian mercenaries at war in the Balkans|url=http://www.bosnia.org.uk/news/news_body.cfm?newsid=1766|newspaper=Bosnian Institute|date=14 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the volunteers allegedly had links with [[Golden Dawn (Greece)|Golden Dawn]] (Χρυσή Αυγή), a Greek nationalist political party accused as being neo-nazi by their opponents,&lt;ref&gt;Anna Stai &amp; Kostas Koutelos (Antinazi Initiative in Athens) [http://www.mhrmi.org/news/2003/december16b_e.asp  "The twilight world of Golden Dawn,"] ''Searchlight Magazine'' (December 16, 2003).

[[Archbishop Seraphim of Athens]] had invited [[Bosnian Serb]] leader [[Radovan Karadžić]] to visit [[Athens]] in 1993. At a rally there, Karadžić proclaimed: "We have only God and the Greeks on our side."&lt;ref name=smith&gt;{{cite news |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/milosevic/story/0,,868869,00.html |title=Greece faces shame of role in Serb massacre |last=Smith |first=Helena |date=5 January 2003 |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=20 April 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presence at Srebrenica in July 1995==
In 2002 the Dutch [[NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies|NIOD]] report on Srebrenica described how the Greek Volunteer Guard, or GVG, unit had hoisted the Greek flag over Srebrenica after the town's fall, citing video footage of the event and excerpts from intercepted Bosnian Serb army telephone communications that included Gen. Ratko Mladić's specific request for the Greek flag to be hoisted over the town to honour "the brave Greeks fighting on our side."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The Report also revealed that the Greek government had sent shipments of light arms and ammunition to the Bosnian Serb army between 1994 and 1995.&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt;

According to a report by [[Agence France Presse]] (AFP), a dozen Greek volunteers were alleged to have fought alongside Serb forces during the time of the  [[Srebrenica massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hri.org/news/balkans/omri/1995/95-07-14.omri.html#07|title=OMRI Daily Digest II, No. 136, 14 July 1995|publisher=|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GVG's involvement in the attack on Srebrenica was reported and several of the volunteers were interviewed in the Greek media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Howden|first1=Daniel|title=Greek role in Srebrenica massacre investigated|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/greek-role-in-srebrenica-massacre-investigated-295548.html|website=The Independent|accessdate=11 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Για τη Λευκή Φυλή και την Ορθοδοξία|url=http://www.iospress.gr/mikro2005/mikro20050716.htm|website=Ιός|accessdate=11 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Unholy Alliance" and "The Greek Way"==
In his book "Unholy Alliance", published in 2002, the Greek author [[Takis Michas]] referred to the claim reported by the Sarajevo weekly review "Global"  that a dozen Greek paramilitaries had been present in the area of the Srebrenica massacre and had raised the Greek flag over the town,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMichas2002|Michas 2002]], p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; reproducing pictures of the volunteers published in the Greek press. Michas also said that [[Radovan Karadžić]] had subsequently decorated the volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMichas2002|Michas 2002]], p. 17–41.&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 1995, four of the unit's fighters were awarded the White Eagle medal of honour by Radovan Karadžić.&lt;ref name="Koknar"/&gt;&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;

In the [[:nl:Ingeborg Beugel|Ingeborg Beugel]]’s documentary "The Greek way" by Dutch public broadcaster [[Interkerkelijke Omroep Nederland|IKON]], which investigated Greek solidarity with Serbia in the [[Bosnian war]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ikonrtv.nl/info.aspx?lIntEntityId=333 "Factor: The Greek Way"] IKON. Retrieved 3 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; a director of the semi-official [[Athens News Agency]], Nikolas Voulelis, admitted to widespread censorship in the Greek media, "Editorial interference was a given." said Voulelis.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;

==Public inquiry==
In 2005 Greek deputy Andreas Andrianopoulos called for an investigation. On 10 July 2005, 163 Greek academics, politicians, journalists and political activists issued a call for Greece to officially apologise to the victims of Srebrenica for any Greek presence in the area of the massacre. After asserting that the Greek public had been "misinformed" about the alliance with the Bosnian Serb forces, their statement called for the Greek state to apologise publicly to the families of the victims, to indict the Greek ‘volunteers' who had been present in Bosnia alongside Karadzic and Mladic and dishonoured the Greek flag by raising it over the carnage at Srebrenica, and to pursue the 'supposedly unknown' people who manipulated them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cm.greekhelsinki.gr/index.php?sec=194&amp;cid=881|title=The BALKAN Human Rights Web Pages|publisher=|accessdate=21 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150116013708/http://cm.greekhelsinki.gr/index.php?sec=194&amp;cid=881|archivedate=16 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Minister of Justice]], [[Anastasios Papaligouras]], commissioned an inquiry&lt;ref name="tiscali.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; which has yet to report.

==Volunteer response to allegations==
In 2007 in the  paper ''Eleftheri ora'' Kyriakos Katharios, a member of the Greek Volunteer Guard, denied that they had participated in the massacre. While acknowledging the raising of the Greek flag, he stated that the honors received from Mladić were not linked to the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elora.gr/portal/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=260&amp;Itemid=13|title=error-page-elora-4|author=Super User|work=elora.gr|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with [[Al-Jazeera]] Katharios claimed that he had been telephoned at home by fellow volunteers who told him that they had raised the flag but had not taken part in the battle itself.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGuHpzYPpMk "The Greek role in Bosnia's war"], Al-Jazeera.  Retrieved 31 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuit against Takis Michas==
In 2009 Stavros Vitalis, a representative of the Greek volunteers, announced that he was suing Takis Michas over allegations in his book.  Vitalis maintained that the volunteers were members of the Bosnian Serb army who had simply taken part in what he described as the town's "re-occupation". In his press statement he acknowledged that "I was present with a group of senior Serb officers in all the operations for the re-occupation of Srebrenica by the Serbs".&lt;ref name="balkaninsight.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=Greece: Suit Against Journalist For Srebrenica Claims to Go Forward|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/main/news/28889/|newspaper=Balkan Investigative Reporting Network|date=21 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bosniak.org"&gt;Daniel Toljaga, [http://www.bosniak.org/interview-greek-journalist-sued-for-writing-about-the-presence-of-greek-paramilitaries-in-bosnia/ "INTERVIEW: Greek journalist sued for writing about the presence of Greek paramilitaries in Bosnia".] Congress of North American Bosniaks (5 August 2009). Accessed 8 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was despite Vitalis telling the journalist Barnaby Phillips that although in Bosnia he was not at Srebrenica when it fell to the Serbs.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt;

Vitalis also claimed that Greek volunteers travelled to the conflict area with the supposed knowledge of  senior Greek politicians .&lt;ref&gt;[http://todayszaman.com/tz-web/news-215034-109-greek-volunteers-in-the-srebrenica-genocide-by-harun-karcic.html "Greek volunteers in the Srebrenica Genocide"] by Harun Karcic, Today's Zaman, 4 July 2010.  Retrieved 25 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Michas focused on inaction : "No-one tried to stop them and the Greek legal authorities made no attempt to assist the work of the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] at The Hague by pursuing inquiries about crimes the volunteers may have committed themselves or known about".&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt;

The suit against Michas was funded by an umbrella group of extreme-right Greek nationalists.&lt;ref name="balkaninsight.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bosniak.org"/&gt;

The campaigning organisation [[Reporters Sans Frontieres]] urged the Greek court to dismiss the action, which it described as "surreal" and a clear case of judicial harassment.  Referring to the quality, thoroughness and courage of Michas's reporting of the Greek "volunteers"'military support to the Bosnian Serbs and successive Greek governments' reluctance to investigate the issue the organisation found the "self-censorship" of the Greek political class and media about the presence of  any paramilitaries or mercenaries forces from the country  in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the Srebrenica massacre "surprising and disturbing" and in the public interest called for further close examination of the role of the Greek authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.rsf.org/greece-athens-court-urged-to-dismiss-17-09-2010,38400.html "Athens court urged to dismiss libel action against journalist"], R''eporters Sans Frontieres'' (17 September 2010). Retrieved 28 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 September, very shortly before the court hearing was due to commence, Vitalis withdrew from the action.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

[[File:Hack Green Secret Nuclear Bunker.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Hack Green Secret Nuclear Bunker]]
The '''Hack Green Secret Nuclear Bunker''' is a former government-owned [[nuclear bunker]] located at [[Hack Green]], [[Cheshire]], [[England]].

== History ==
[[File:Hack green secret bunker.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Signpost showing directions to the secret bunker.]]
The first military use of the area was in [[World War II]], when a [[Starfish site]] was established at Hack Green. Its purpose was to confuse [[Luftwaffe]]  bombers looking for the vital railway junction at [[Crewe]].

A [[Ground-controlled interception]] (GCI) radar station was added.

In the 1950s, the site was modernised as part of the [[ROTOR]] project. This included the provision of a substantial semi-sunk reinforced concrete bunker or blockhouse (type R6).

The station, officially designated RAF Hack Green, was also known as Mersey Radar. It provided an [[air traffic control]] service to military aircraft crossing civil airspace.

The site was abandoned and remained derelict for many years, until the [[Home Office]] took it over. They rebuilt the R6 bunker as a Regional Government Headquarters (RGHQs) - one of a network of 17 such sites throughout the UK - designed to enable government to continue in the aftermath of a major nuclear attack on the UK.

In about 1992, following the end of the [[Cold War]], the Home Office abandoned its network of RGHQs and sold many of the sites. This one was bought by a private company and subsequently opened to the public in 1998 as a museum with a Cold War theme.

== Current status ==
[[File:Secret Bunker exhibits.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Exhibits include the nose section of an [[F-4 Phantom]] jet]]
The bunker is open to the public most of the year. It has a substantial collection of military and [[Cold War]] memorabilia, including one of the largest collections of decommissioned nuclear weapons in the world. It also houses [[Ballistic Missile Early Warning System]] equipment originally from [[RAF High Wycombe]].&lt;ref name ="bmews"&gt;[http://www.hackgreen.co.uk/BMEWS/bmews.htm Hack Green Secret Nuclear Bunker: BMEWS]&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum includes information about the function of the bunker during the Cold War. There is a simulator designed to simulate conditions in the bunker during a nuclear attack. Visitors can watch the BBC film ''[[The War Game]]'', produced to inform the public of what would be likely to happen in a nuclear attack on Britain. Younger visitors to the museum can navigate the rooms in a game to find the "Cold War Spy Mice" (a large number of toy mice positioned in numerous rooms), which avoids the more disturbing aspects of the bunker, such as the medical room, where a [[mannequin]] is depicted with symptoms of burns and radiation poisoning; the objective being to locate as many mice as possible and return their report to the desk for a prize.

==On television==
Hack Green was featured in the British television series ''[[Most Haunted: Midsummer Murders]]'' episode two in which the team investigates the murder of a soldier. It featured once again in Series 10.

The '''Hacktivismo Enhanced-Source Software License Agreement''' ('''HESSLA''') is a [[software license]] proposed by [[Hacktivismo]] that attempts to put [[ethical]] restrictions on use and modification of software released under it.

The license was written by [[Oxblood Ruffin]] (of Hacktivismo and [[Cult of the Dead Cow|CULT OF THE DEAD COW]]) and [[Eric Grimm]], an [[Lawyer|attorney]] with the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]].

The HESSLA allows for enhancements to be made and for [[derivative work]]s to be created, but it prohibits the use or modification of the software to violate [[human rights]] or to introduce [[spyware|features that spy on the user]]. It is intended to be a legally enforceable document. However, due to these restrictions, it is not technically a [[free software license]],&lt;ref name="fsflist" /&gt; though it was inspired by [[free software]] and [[open source license]]s.

== Criticism ==

HESSLA has been criticized by the [[Free Software Foundation]] for introducing restrictions that they claim are ineffective for preventing abuse, but introduce legal incompatibility with other licenses.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gnu.org/licenses/hessla.html "The HESSLA's Problems"] from [https://www.gnu.org/ gnu.org]&lt;/ref&gt; It also is listed as a good example of a ''[[human rights license]]'' in the [[Creative Commons]] [[wiki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|accessdate=17 April 2012|publisher=[[Creative Commons]]|work=wiki|date=8 February 2008|first=Craig|last=Hubley|title=Human rights license|url=http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Human_rights_license}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Derivatives ==

The [[web browser]] [[xB Browser]] was temporarily based on the ''[[Torrify Ethical Software License Agreement]]'' (TESLA) which was built upon HESSLA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ip.xerobank.com/company/tesla/|accessdate=17 April 2012|title=The Torrify Ethical Software License Agreement|publisher=[[XeroBank]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120710105429/http://ip.xerobank.com/company/tesla/|archivedate=10 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://portableapps.com/node/17820|title=GPL Violations in XeroBank Browser {{!}} PortableApps.com - Portable software for USB, portable and cloud drives|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was raised in [[Kilburn, London|Kilburn]] from 9 years old attending [[Finchley Catholic High School]]. However, he left school with no qualifications after contracting [[tuberculosis]] from drinking the milk of a cow he had milked on a school visit to a farm.&lt;ref name=Guard1&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/dec/20/addison-lee-john-griffin-profile|title=Minicab mogul has tight grip on wheel|publisher=The Guardian|date=2009-12-20|accessdate=2009-12-24 | location=London | first=David | last=Teather| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091223110541/http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2009/dec/20/addison-lee-john-griffin-profile| archivedate= 23 December 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
While training as an accountant, his father's road and sewer building business got into financial difficulty.&lt;ref name="ftmyfirstmillion"&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/1c354428-a7e5-11e0-afc2-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3QueYlL75 My first million: John Griffin], ''The Financial Times'', July 7, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Griffin left accountancy training to help salvage the business with some success.&lt;ref name=AddLeeJG/&gt; During this period, and wanting a flexible job to create extra income, Griffin started working as a [[minicab]] driver which turned into a full-time job. Griffin eventually decided to move on from driving minicabs, deciding he could do a better job of running a minicab business. Together with another driver, he set about starting a company which today is known as West One Cars. However, Griffin was convinced to stay on with his original employer after his salary was quadrupled and only later decided to form his own company.&lt;ref name=Guard1/&gt;

Griffin was convinced that his new company needed a name which started with an "A" for it to appear early in [[telephone directory]] listings. A colleague who lived in a squat in Addison Gardens said people seemed to think this was a very posh address, which Griffin supplemented with Lee. Addison Lee was founded in 1975, with half the company owned by investor Lenny Foster.&lt;ref name=AddLeeJG/&gt;

In 1976, Griffin founded the [[Private Hire Car Association]] in response to the [[Miscellaneous Provisions Act 1976]]. As chairman of the association, Griffin was vocal in the debate that led to the licensing of [[private hire]] operators in the UK.&lt;ref name=AddLeeJG&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.addisonlee.com/about/background/about-john-griffin/|title=John Griffin|publisher=Addison Lee|accessdate=August 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was featured on the television programme, ''[[The Secret Millionaire]]'' in December 2009.&lt;ref name="ftmyfirstmillion"/&gt;

He stepped down as Chairman of Addison Lee in 2014, shortly after the [[Carlyle Group]] purchased a majority stake in the company.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Campbell, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/transport/10839285/Addison-Lee-chairman-John-Griffin-steps-down.html Addison Lee chairman John Griffin steps down], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 19 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''League of California Cities''' is an association of cities within the state of [[California]], founded in 1898. Most of the state's [[List of cities and towns in California|482 cities]] are represented in the league.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Howard |first=John |url=http://www.capitolweekly.net/article.php?_c=10cxajj7jf8xaps&amp;xid=10cx9vkobvvx5tt&amp;done=.10cxajj7jf99aps |title=Accentuate the positive: Cities target aftermath of Bell |publisher=Capitol Weekly |date= |accessdate=2013-06-25 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120903211519/http://www.capitolweekly.net/article.php?_c=10cxajj7jf8xaps&amp;xid=10cx9vkobvvx5tt&amp;done=.10cxajj7jf99aps# |archive-date=2012-09-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The League publishes ''Western City'', a monthly magazine, and holds an annual conference and exposition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Meyers |first=Steven R. |url=http://www.westerncity.com/ |title=Western City Magazine - League of California Cities® |publisher=Westerncity.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cacities.org/ac |title=League of California Cities - 2013 Annual Conference &amp; Expo |publisher=Cacities.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The League advocates for cities at the state capitol, including proper distribution of state taxes to the cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Yamamura |first=Kevin |url=http://blogs.sacbee.com/capitolalertlatest/2011/09/league-of-california-cities-sue-to-block-vehicle-tax-shift.html |title=Capitol Alert: League of California Cities sues to block vehicle tax shift |publisher=Blogs.sacbee.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625070821/http://blogs.sacbee.com/capitolalertlatest/2011/09/league-of-california-cities-sue-to-block-vehicle-tax-shift.html# |archive-date=2013-06-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main office is in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]].

==History==

===Founding===
In 1898, Ben Lamborn, the city clerk of [[Alameda, California|Alameda]], sent a letter to the then over 100 cities in the state, inquiring about their experience with a newly introduced road roller. He added to the inquiry questions such as their name, population, date of incorporation, names of officials, among others.

Haven A. Mason, a community activist, newspaper publisher, attorney and city clerk of [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]], was one recipient. Mason had read about the 1894 founding of the [[National Municipal League]], a citizens group with a mission to fight corruption in city governments. He visited Lamborn in Alameda to discuss organizing city officials around issues such as public records and tax assessment and the introduction of electric light.

Lamborn and Mason presented the idea to [[Delos Druffel]], the mayor of Santa Clara, who then sent letters to the other mayors in the state asking them to attend a meeting to consider this proposal.

Mason and Lamborn then visited [[James D. Phelan]], the mayor of San Francisco. Phelan was interested in the idea of a League of Municipalities, offered San Francisco as a meeting place, and provided $3,000 of his own monies to pay for expenses. Lamborn bartered an agreement with [[Southern Pacific]] for them to provide a 3,000-mile pass, which the railroad would recoup in the anticipated travel expenses of city officials' attending the ongoing league meetings.

Druffel received positive replies from about half the cities in California. An invitation was then sent to all cities and incorporated towns, asking them to send representatives to the first meeting, at Pioneer Hall, on Fourth Street in San Francisco, on December 14, 1898. The date was deliberately set for prior to January 1899, "so that the proposed association could be formed in time to consider such matters of legislation as might be deemed expedient to submit to the Legislature then to assemble."

Thirty cities answered the invitation, with others sending words of encouragement. Thirteen cities, all from the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], sent delegates. Phelan was elected president, Mason was named secretary and Lamborn was chosen for the League's executive committee, along with Mayor [[Joseph Hutchinson (politician)|Joseph Hutchinson]] of [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]].

==Board of directors==

Notable past board members, in addition to James P. Phelan, include [[Richard P. Graves]], longtime executive director, who ran for governor of California in 1954.

==Policy positions==
The league campaigned against 2006's [[California Proposition 90 (2006)|Proposition 90]], spending $4.1m against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.followthemoney.org/database/topcontributor.phtml?u=7501&amp;y=0 |title=League Of California Cities |publisher=Follow The Money |date= |accessdate=2013-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposition lost. The league campaigned against proposition 98, and for proposition 99, in the [[California Propositions 98 and 99 (2008)|Proposition 98/99 ballot proposals of 2008]], spending $5.8m on the measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.followthemoney.org/database/topcontributor.phtml?u=7501&amp;y=2008&amp;incy=0&amp;ince=0&amp;incs=0&amp;incf=0 |title=League Of California Cities |publisher=Follow The Money |date= |accessdate=2013-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 98 failed, while 99 passed.
The league was an advocate of 2010's [[California state elections, November 2010#Proposition 22|Proposition 22]], a constitutional amendment that would prevent the state government from taking certain funds, such as transportation funds, from the local governments. They spent $2.8m towards its passage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.followthemoney.org/database/topcontributor.phtml?u=7501&amp;y=2010 |title=League Of California Cities |publisher=Follow The Money |date= |accessdate=2013-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It passed with 61% of the vote.

==Helen Putnam Award of Excellence==
The league sponsors the [http://www.helenputnam.org/ Helen Putnam Award of Excellence], which is presented annually to city programs that "Improve the quality of life in local communities, implement efficiencies in service delivery and operations, and provide services responsive to the local community."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helenputnam.org/ |title=Helen Putnam Award of Excellence |publisher=Helenputnam.org |date=2013-04-11 |accessdate=2013-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Let's roll'''" is a [[colloquialism]] that has been used extensively as a command to move and start an activity, attack, mission or project.

==Origins==
The phrase has been used as early as 1908 in the cadence song now called "[[The Army Goes Rolling Along]]", which likely extended into [[tank]] usage. 
"[[The Roads Must Roll]]", a science fiction story written in 1940 by [[Robert A. Heinlein]], mentions a re-worded version of "The Roll of the Caissons" called "Road Songs of the Transport Cadets". The protagonist of the 1937 [[supernatural]] [[comedy]], ''[[Topper (film)|Topper]]'', played by Cary Grant, uses the phrase "Let's roll" to his wife, played by Constance Bennett, to indicate they should immediately exit their friend's stuffy office and find a drink. The pair are lighthearted, youthful, irresponsible, and impossibly glamorous types, and the line delivery has a decisive insouciance about it. The protagonist of [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s 1950 novel ''[[Across the River and into the Trees]]'', Colonel Dick Cantwell, based on [[World War II]] commander Charles "Buck" Lanham, uses the phrase to his driver. He knows he is facing imminent [[death]], but tries to maintain decency, grace, and a sense of humor. The verb "roll" has been used in both the [[film]] and [[recording industry]] to signal the beginning of a film or [[audio recording]].

"Let's roll" was commonly used in the [[police]] [[television series]] ''[[Adam-12]]'' and the original ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''. It was used at the end of roll call at the beginning of each episode of 1980s television series ''[[Hill Street Blues]]''. It has appeared, among other places, in ''[[The Transformers (TV series)|The Transformers]]'' animated series by [[Optimus Prime]], before entering battle or embarking on a group journey. The exact phrase was used in Season 1, Episode 3, "More than Meets the Eye" (1984) in preparation for the final showdown with [[Megatron]] and the Decepticons (as well as in the 2009 feature film ''[[Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen]]''). It was used in the 1986 film ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]'', and the 1987 film ''[[Matewan]]'', where it was used by [[Baldwin–Felts Detective Agency|Baldwin–Felts]] agents before a violent attack on striking coal miners. The term was used at the end of the film ''[[Matilda (1996 film)|Matilda]]'', when the title character was given up for adoption. The toys use the phrase when setting out to rescue Woody in the 1999 animated children's film ''[[Toy Story 2]]''. In the late 1990s, the term "let's roll" was frequently used to initiate a departure from any given place. Hence, the term and true context of the term "let's roll" during this time period was to initiate action from an individual to a group of friends.

==September 11 attacks==
On September 11, 2001, [[Todd Beamer]], a passenger on the [[aircraft hijacking|hijacked]] [[United Airlines Flight 93]], tried to place a call through an air phone, but was routed to a customer service representative instead, who passed him on to supervisor [[Lisa Jefferson]]. Beamer reported that one passenger had been killed and that a flight attendant had told him that both the pilot and co-pilot had been forced from the cockpit and may have been injured. He was also on the phone when the plane made a quick and violent turn. Later, he told the operator that some of the other passengers were planning to attack the hijackers and regain control of the aircraft, after they learned about what happened at the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]] and [[The Pentagon]]. According to Jefferson, Beamer's last audible words were “Are you ready? Okay. Let's roll.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/headlines/20010916phonecallnat3p3.asp |title=The phone line from Flight 93 was still open when a GTE operator heard Todd Beamer say: 'Are you guys ready? Let's roll' |work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |date=September 16, 2001 | first1=Jim | last1=McKinnon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a November 8 address from the [[World Congress Center]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] would invoke Beamer's words: “Some of our greatest moments have been acts of courage for which no one could have been prepared. But we have our marching orders. My fellow Americans, let's roll!”&lt;ref name=AmNatBiography&gt;Evensen, Bruce J. (2000). [http://www.anb.org/articles/20/20-01916-print.html "Beamer, Todd Morgan"]. ''[[American National Biography]]''. Retrieved May 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; He would use them again in the 2002 [[State of the Union]] address: “For too long our culture has said, ‘If it feels good, do it.’ Now America is embracing a new ethic and a new creed: ‘Let's roll.’”&lt;ref name="BushSpeeches"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bush|first1=George W.|title=Selected Speeches of man George W. Bush 2001 – 2008|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/infocus/bushrecord/documents/Selected_Speeches_George_W_Bush.pdf|website=The [[White House]] of [[George W. Bush]]|publisher=National Archives and Records Administration|accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural impact==
===Music===
*Several musicians and bands have written songs entitled or including the phrase "Let's Roll", with the songs typically referring to Flight 93 or Todd Beamer. The first song with the name, [[Neil Young]]'s "Let's Roll", was released as a single in November 2001, and was later included in his album ''[[Are You Passionate?]]''. The following year, three diverse groups released songs: hard rock group [[L.A. Guns]] included "OK, Let's Roll" in their album ''[[Waking the Dead (album)|Waking the Dead]]'', country music duo [[The Bellamy Brothers]]'s song "Let's Roll, America" was on ''Redneck Girls Forever'', and Christian rock group [[dc Talk]] recorded and released a single entitled "Let's Roll" despite being on hiatus.
*Three other 9/11-related songs by the name "Let's Roll" have been released in the following years. Montreal rock band [[The Stills]]'s song was included on their debut album ''[[Logic Will Break Your Heart]]'' in 2003. [[Jonny L]]'s song included a [[sampling (music)|sample]] of President [[George W. Bush]]'s 2002 [[State of the Union address]] which included the phrase. In 2004, [[Ray Stevens]] offered up the self-penned "Let's Roll" and referenced Todd Beamer in the lyrics. Stevens' recording appeared on his 2004 ''[[Thank You! (Ray Stevens album)|Thank You!]]'' CD. The recording later appeared on his 2005 ''[[Box Set]]'' project and on his 2010 ''[[We the People]]'' project.
*[[Melissa Etheridge]]'s 2004 song "Tuesday Morning", written in honor of Flight 93 passenger [[Mark Bingham]], concluded with the phrase, "Let's roll".
*In 2011, American rapper [[Yelawolf]] released a song called "Let's Roll", which talks about Southern patriotism.

===Government===
*The phrase became especially known and popular after being used by President [[George W. Bush]] in a speech to [[AmeriCorps]] volunteers and during his 2002 [[State of the Union address]]. Even though the phrase was in common use long before September 11, many soon tried to lay claim to it as a [[trademark]]. The [[Todd M. Beamer Foundation]] was eventually granted a trademark for uses of the phrase relating to "pre-recorded compact discs, audio tapes, digital audio tapes, and phonograph records featuring music."
*In early 2002, [[United States Air Force]] [[Air Force Chief of Staff|Chief of Staff]] Gen. John P. Jumper ordered that one airplane in each USAF squadron and all USAF demonstration planes would bear an image of an eagle on an American flag with the words "Let's Roll" and "Spirit of 9-11", to remain until the first anniversary of the attack. It was also used by Lisa Beamer, widow of Todd, in a 2003 book titled ''Let's Roll: Ordinary People, Extraordinary Courage''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|0-8423-7418-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sports===
*In the 2002 college football season, the [[2002 Florida State Seminoles football team|Florida State Seminoles]] used "Let's Roll" as their official team slogan. After an initial uproar against the team by people who considered its usage in bad taste,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vecsey|first=George|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/20/sports/sports-of-the-times-let-s-roll-demeans-real-heroes.html|title=Sports of The Times; 'Let's Roll' Demeans Real Heroes|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 20, 2002|accessdate=February 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Todd M. Beamer Foundation officially licensed the trademark to the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chan|first=Sue|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-marketing-of-lets-roll/|title=The Marketing Of 'Let's Roll'|publisher=[[CBS News]]|date=September 11, 2002|accessdate=February 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[NASCAR]] driver [[Bobby Labonte]] drove a 9/11 tribute car with the words "Let's Roll" on the hood of his stock car in the [[2002 MBNA All-American Heroes 400]] at [[Dover International Speedway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mrn.com/Race-Series/NASCAR-Sprint-Cup/News/Articles/2002/11/Collectors-Corner-Top-Special-Paint-Schemes-Of-2002.aspx|title=Collectors Corner: Top Special Paint Schemes Of 2002|work=[[Motor Racing Network]]|date=November 28, 2002|accessdate=September 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Detroit Red Wings]] goaltender [[Jimmy Howard]] has the inscription "Lets Roll" on the back of his goalie helmet in reference to Flight 93.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roose|first1=Bill|title=Let's Roll Howard's mask pays tribute to 9/11 tragedy|url=http://redwings.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=561851|website=redwings.nhl.com|publisher=Detroit Red Wings.|accessdate=December 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media===
*The phrase was also used in an episode of [[HBO]]'s ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'' ("The Survivor", season 4, episode 9). The show's main character, [[Larry David]], says the phrase inadvertently to his [[rabbi]] once he and his wife are ready to go out and renew their vows, who then becomes offended because of a relative of his died on September 11, 2001 ("You knew my brother-in-law died on September 11th, how dare you say something like that?!"). Larry takes issue with this, as his rabbi's relative was hit by a bike messenger ("Well, with all due respect, wasn't that just a coincidence?"), in an incident completely unrelated to the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
*The phrase appears in the 2009 British black comedy satire film, ''[[In the Loop (film)|In The Loop]]''.  One British character says to another, "Let's roll," to which the other replies, "You can't say that here, they don't like that."
*The phrase was used in the film: ''[[Let's Roll – The Story of Flight 93]]'', which is a dramatised reconstruction of Flight 93.
*The phrase appears on the morale patch on the helmet of the protagonist character John Kozak in the game ''[[Ghost Recon: Future Soldier]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/GhostRecon/comments/8emsal/lets_roll_morale_patch/|title=Let's roll morale patch|work=[[Reddit]]|date=April 24, 2018|accessdate=May 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political===
*"Let's Roll!" was the 2004 campaign slogan of the [[Marijuana Party of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/marijuana-party-gets-campaign-rolling-with-seed-money-1.499127|title=Marijuana Party gets campaign rolling with seed money|work=[[CBC News]]|date=June 1, 2004|accessdate=February 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Zealand band [[Fly My Pretties]] released a song about marijuana titled "Let's Roll" the same year.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11952">'''Magen Tzedek''', originally known as '''Hekhsher Tzedek''', ({{lang-he| מגן צדק}} English translation ''Shield of Justice'' or ''Justice Certification'', with variant English spellings) is a complementary [[Certification mark|certification]] for [[kosher]] food produced in the [[United States]] in a way that meets Jewish [[Halakhic]] (legal) standards for workers, consumers, animals, and the environment, as understood by [[Conservative Judaism]]. Magen Tzedek certification is not a [[hechsher|kashrut certification]] which certifies that food is kosher in that it meets certain requirements regarding ingredients of food and technical methods of animal slaughter, but an [[ethical]] certification complementary to conventional kosher certification.   

Magen Tzedek was initiated by [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] rabbi [[Morris Allen]] and was launched in 2011. It is sponsored by the [[Rabbinical Assembly]], the American association of Conservative rabbis, the [[United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism]], the [[Central Conference of American Rabbis|Central Conference of Reform Rabbis]], and the [[Union for Reform Judaism]].&lt;ref name="Website"/&gt; Magen Tzedek has met with harsh criticism from [[Orthodox Jewish]] rabbis and organizations. As of May 2013, no product bears the Magen Tzedek seal.&lt;ref name="ForwardStalled"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://forward.com/articles/176814/magen-tzedek-ethical-kosher-seal-stalled-amid-orth/?p=all| title=Magen Tzedek, Ethical Kosher Seal, Stalled Amid Orthodox Opposition| author=Berkman, Seth | date= May 20, 2013| work= The Forward |accessdate=May 22, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
Magen Tzedek certification was initiated by Conservative rabbi Morris Allen of [[Beth Jacob Congregation]] in [[Mendota Heights, Minnesota]] in 2007 following investigative reporting by [[Nathaniel Popper]] in ''[[The Jewish Daily Forward]]'' regarding working conditions at [[Agriprocessors]] kosher meat plant in [[Postville, Iowa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Popper, Nathaniel| url= http://www.forward.com/articles/1006| title= In Iowa Meat Plant, Kosher ‘Jungle’ Breeds Fear, Injury, Short Pay| work= The Forward| date=May 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a five-member rabbinic and lay commission visited the plant over two days and spoke with owners, senior managers and about 60 current or former workers and had reviewed reports from the State Department of Labor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Rabbis Consider Workplace Certification| date=December 22, 2006 | author=Ain, Stewart | work= The New York Jewish Week| url=http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/new_york/rabbis_consider_workplace_certification| accessdate=May 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allen stated: “We weren’t able to verify everything Popper wrote, but what we did find was equally painful and filled with indignities”.&lt;ref name="NYT2007/05/19"&gt; {{cite web| title=Rabbi’s Campaign for Kosher Standards Expands to Include Call for Social Justice | author= Freedman, Samuel G. | date=May 19, 2007| work= The New York Times | accessdate=May 7, 2012| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/19/us/19religion.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, a commission was formed to develop and apply “a set of standards that would certify that kosher food manufacturers in the US operate according to Jewish ethics and social values”. On January 31, 2011, the Magen Tzedek Commission was founded as an Illinois not-for-profit corporation with seed funding from the [[Nathan Cummings Foundation]],&lt;ref name="Website"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.magentzedek.org/| title=Magen Tzedek official website| accessdate=May 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which reportedly has given grants totaling at least $245,000 to Magen Tzedek since 2008.&lt;ref name="ForwardStalled"/&gt;

==Principles and standards==
Magen Tzedek claims to combine the rabbinic tradition of Torah with Jewish values of social justice, certifying that the kosher food product has been produced in keeping with Jewish ethics in the area of labor concerns, animal welfare, environmental impact, consumer issues and corporate integrity.&lt;ref name="Website"/&gt;
According to Magen Tzedek, food production should comply with various [[D'Oraita and D'Rabbanan|Biblical and rabbinic]] [[mitzvot|commandments]] which are ignored by conventional certifying agencies. As outlined in a paper titled "Hekhsher Tzedek Al Pi Din", authored by Rabbi [[Avraham Reisner]] of the Rabbinical Assembly, these laws include:&lt;ref name="Al Pi Din"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://magentzedek.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/hekhsher_tzedek_al_pi_din_july_2009.pdf| title= Hekhsher Tzedek. Al Pi Din| date=January 31, 2008 |accessdate=May 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The Book of [[Deuteronomy]] lays out a prohibition known as [[Ona'ah]]: "You shall not abuse a needy and destitute laborer, whether a fellow countryman or a stranger" (Deut. 24:14–15)
* The [[Shulchan Arukh]], in [[Choshen Mishpat]] 331:1, states that "one who hires employees should treat them in accordance with local custom" and that "when the custom was to provide their meals, he should provide their meals, to provide figs or dates or something similar, he should provide it — all in accordance with local custom."  Reisner argues that this gives employers an obligation to fairly compensate workers including sick and vacation pay. 
* Biblical law requires employers to provide for the health and safety of their workers, as seen from laws regarding one who leaves a pit uncovered ([[Exodus 21]]:33) or does not build a [[parapet]] on a roof that is in use ([[Deuteronomy 22]]:8).
* [[Tza'ar ba'alei chayim]] is a Biblical principle which prohibits causing unnecessary pain to animals. 

According to Allen, it makes sense that the Conservative movement has taken the lead on the issue, as "Conservative Judaism is uniquely positioned. We are committed to kashrut, which some other movements might not be, and also committed to social justice. The hekhsher tzedek is that point where halachic intensity meets ethical imperative."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Fishkoff, Sue| url= http://www.thereportergroup.org/article.aspx?aID=149 | title= Conservatives set to approve ethical certification system for kosher food| work= The Reporter Group| date= November 27, 2007| accessdate=May 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and criticism==
The launching of Hekhsher and Magen Tzedek has been widely commented in the American Press.&lt;ref name="CCurr"&gt;{{cite web| title= When Tzedek Isn’t: The Conservative Movement Finds a Cause| author= Shafran, Avi | date=February 17, 2012| url= http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2012/02/17/when-tzedek-isnt-the-conservative-movement-finds-a-cause/| work= Cross Currents| accessdate=May 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has come under attack from [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] organizations and its representatives such as Rabbi Asher Zeilingold who was paid by Agriprocessors to oversee the plant and who had formerly collaborated with Allen,&lt;ref name="NYT2007/05/19"/&gt; Rabbi [[Avi Shafran]], director of public affairs of [[Agudath Israel of America]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Orthodox Rabbis Now Tie Kashrut To Ethics| date= September 29, 2008 | author=Ain, Stewart | work= The New York Jewish Week| accessdate=May 7, 2012 | url= http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/national/orthodox_rabbis_now_tie_kashrut_ethics}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar Hasidim]].&lt;ref name="NYT2007/05/19"/&gt; [[Agudath Israel of America]] has called the Magen Tzedek seal “a falsification of the Jewish religious heritage,” deploring it as an attempt “to redefine kashrut.”&lt;ref name="ForwardStalled"/&gt; Those affiliated within Orthodox Judaism contend that it causes confusion about what is truly kosher,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Cooperman, Alan| url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/06/AR2007070602092.html?nav=rss_email/components| title=Eco-Kosher Movement Aims To Heed Tradition, Conscience| work=The Washington Post| date=July 7, 2007| accessdate=May 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and criticize Magen Tzedek for allegedly downplaying [[kashrut]] by confusing it with [[social justice]] issues, claiming that it makes use of kashrut to follow secular political agendas. Shafran's criticism also includes the view that this certification is a stealthy way for the Conservative movement to enter the arena of kosher supervision making allowances for “contemporary society’s increasing approval of ‘alternate lifestyles’” in response to its loss of members.&lt;ref name="CCurr"/&gt; 

Rabbi [[Menachem Genack]], the chief kosher executive of the [[Orthodox Union]], the largest kosher certifier in the United States told the ''New York Times'': “The issues raised — workers’ rights, safety, environmental issues — are not mundane issues. The question is one of implementation. These issues are best dealt with within the mandate of other agencies — federal and state. We believe they’re handling it properly and have the expertise and the authority to handle it.”&lt;ref name="NYT2007/05/19"/&gt; However, according to the ''Jewish Daily Forward'', in an interview in 2013 with the [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]], Genack said that “If there is a company that wants to use Magen Tzedek, we will not object to it appearing on the label,” adding “we also would not object to them putting ‘halal’ on their label. These are marketing decisions the company makes on its own.”&lt;ref name="ForwardStalled"/&gt;
  
The fact that Magen Tzedek limits its supervision to food and does not include other items has also been criticized,&lt;ref name="CCurr"/&gt; and questions have been raised about the employment policies of many Conservative congregations that do not follow the guidelines of Magen Tzedek for its own workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.forward.com/articles/116270/| title=Pushing for Better Wages, Not Necessarily Giving Them| author= Popper, Nathaniel | date=October 7, 2009|work= The Forward| accessdate=May 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magen Tzedek, described as “an organization that certifies kosher food to standards that meet or exceed best practices for the treatment of workers, animals, and the environment” was invited to participate in the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]]'s second Food and Justice Passover Seder in April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://blogs.usda.gov/2012/04/05/let-all-who-are-hungry-come-and-eat-a-food-and-justice-seder-at-usda/| title=Let All Who Are Hungry Come and Eat: A Food and Justice Seder at USDA| author=Finberg, Max | date= April 5, 2012| publisher= USDA Blog |accessdate=May 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
But as of May 2013, not a single product bears their seal. Allen claims that Magen Tzedek has come under attack “just because we come from a different part of the Jewish people.” But, according to the ''Forward'', “that alone may not explain why Magen Tzedek has yet to gain any traction. The current standards include a plethora of specific requirements a company must fulfill to be certified as ethically kosher: categories and subcategories of labor practices, animal welfare conditions, consumer issues, and issues of corporate integrity, environmental impact, traceability of food supplies and record keeping.”&lt;ref name="ForwardStalled"/&gt;

'''Miguel Mendonça''' (born August 1973, Salisbury, Rhodesia) is an Anglo-Azorean writer based in [[Bristol]], England.

==Education==

Miguel studied Forestry at [[Sparsholt College]], Landscape Management at [[Hadlow College]], Journalism and Radio Production at FAS, Geography and History at [[University College Cork]], and Social Science and Environmental Ethics at the [[Open University]].

==Sustainability Work==

Mendonca's sustainability career is most associated with his work on [[feed-in tariff]]s, a [[renewable energy policy]]. He did advocacy and education work on this topic on four continents, contributing to legislative change in several countries. Much of this work was carried out while he served as Research Manager for the [[World Future Council]], an international [[NGO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reeep.org/index.php?assetType=news&amp;assetId=294 |title=Interview with Miguel Mendonca  |author=Xavier Lemaire |date=23 September 2009 |work=REEEP }}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently worked with The Converging World, a [[renewable energy]]-focused charity based in Bristol, England.

Miguel then worked for a short period as a freelance sustainability researcher and writer. He produced two key studies, the first reviewing the first year performance and outcomes of the UK feed-in tariff in 2011, and the second assessing ''The Green Economy in Bristol and the West of England'', which was published in January 2012. The latter assessed the size and make-up of the [[environmental technologies]] sector in the region at that time. It also surveyed the UK green policy environment, and summarised some of the other key aspects of a [[green economy]], including sustainable design of goods and services, retail, food, and well-being. The report concluded with a call for 'Resilience Planning', an ongoing process of strategic collaboration between actors and stakeholders in the region, towards meeting local needs sustainably through investment in local assets. The integration and optimisation of food, energy and transport systems is central. The development of resilience should merge the agendas of [[sustainability]], [[economic development]], [[social capital]] development, [[participatory democracy]] and [[emergency planning]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.uniteddiversity.coop/Money_and_Economics/Cooperatives/Energy/Bristol_Green_Economy_Report.pdf Uniteddiversity.coop, direct download]&lt;/ref&gt;

Miguel wrote and co-wrote several books, and numerous articles, book chapters and papers on sustainability and renewable energy policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.resurgence.org/magazine/author230-miguel-mendonca.html
|title=Author Profile: Miguel Mendonça |author= |date= |work=Resurgence Magazine }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the author of ''Feed-in Tariffs:  accelerating the deployment of renewable energy'', published by [[Earthscan]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/u/miguel-mendonca-65479 Miguel Mendonca] ''Renewable Energy World''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Feed_in_tariffs.html?id=TJlBl8eFpTkC |title=Feed-in tariffs: accelerating the deployment of renewable energy |author=Miguel Mendonca |year=2007 |work=Google Books }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also co-author of ''Powering the Green Economy: The Feed-In Tariff Handbook'' (Earthscan, 2009) and ''A Renewable World: Energy, Ecology, Equality'' (Green Books, 2009).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.futurepolicy.org/2757.html World Future Council publications] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726071549/http://www.futurepolicy.org/2757.html |date=26 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period Miguel held research fellowships at the University of Bristol and at Birkbeck College, University of London. He served on the advisory boards of the Alliance for Renewable Energy, Global Urban Development, Our Future Planet and Raw Foundation.

==Fiction Writing==

His first work of fiction, a collection of 11 short stories and a novella, was published as ''Quick! Act Normal'' in February 2013 under the pen name of Michael Ford. These stories explore human experience, and in particular our relationships with ourselves, each other and the world in which we live.

==Ufology Writing==

In late 2015 Miguel published ''Meet the Hybrids - The Lives and Missions of ET Ambassadors on Earth''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://meetthehybrids.wordpress.com/the-book/ Meet the Hybrids, "The Book", December 14, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; This non-fiction book explores the subject of ET-human hybrids from the inside, by interviewing eight individuals who understand that they are part-extraterrestrial and part-human. The book is co-authored with Barbara Lamb, a licensed marriage and family therapist, and regression therapist, who has for the last 25 years worked with over 1,700 clients with regard to extraterrestrial encounters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://barbaralambmft.com/06credentials.html Barbara Lamb MFT, "Barbara Lamb Credentials and Biography", Retrieved December 14, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2016 International UFO Congress in Arizona, Barbara Lamb was joined on stage by six of the hybrids from the book. After an introduction from Barbara, each of the hybrids shared information about themselves, their experiences and their star families.

In the fall of 2016 Mendonca brought out a two-part people's history of the extraterrestrial subject, titled ''We Are the Disclosure''. Through interviews with 27 people who have been active in the field for a combined total of around 700 years, the books explore the scale and scope of the subject. It was inspired by the findings of ''Meet the Hybrids'', and set out to reflect the more spiritual narrative emerging from that community.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wearethedisclosure.com/2016/09/19/we-are-the-disclosure-part-1-now-available We Are the Disclosure, "We Are the Disclosure – Part 1 now available", Retrieved March 20, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; The books cover the spectrum of interest in the field, running from the masculine-technological-historical-political aspects, to the feminine-wellbeing-metaphysical-spiritual aspects. Mendonca interviewed a wide variety of subjects, including scientists, journalists and therapists, many of whom claim ET contact in different forms. The book also examined the state of the field, looking at its development since 1947, and traced its connections deep into the human past. The varying opinions of top-down versus bottom-up 'Disclosure' of the ET presence on Earth were discussed. And it opened up a deeper dialogue on what this field tells us about the nature of being and the journey of the soul.

In March 2017 Mendonca published the final part of his trilogy on ET-human interaction, titled ''Being with the Beings - The How and the Why of ET Contact''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wearethedisclosure.com/2017/03/19/being-with-the-beings-out-now-in-paperback/, We Are the Disclosure, "Being with the Beings out now in paperback", Retrieved March 20, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a study of ET-human contact experiences, in which nine long-term experiencers are interviewed. They include channelers, hybrids, artists and therapists. The key topics are how and why the contact takes place, and how it has shaped their lives. They share their contact techniques, and safety protocols. It is illustrated with diagrams, representations of the beings they are in contact with, and downloaded images including 'light language' and geometric designs.

==Glass Work==

Following the conclusion of his trilogy on 'ET-human interaction', Mendonca learned stained glass and cast glass techniques. Under the banner of 'Lightworker Glass' he went on to produce a series of lamps, light shades in stained glass, and cast sculptural pieces, some featuring 'extraterrestrial' faces within them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wearethedisclosure.com/2018/03/20/1154/ We Are the Disclosure, "Lightworker Glass: Shifting Expression", Retrieved May 11, 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Newton hearing''' or '''inquiry''' is a comparatively modern legal procedure in [[English law]], used where the two sides offer such conflicting evidence that a judge sitting alone (that is, without a [[jury]]) tries to ascertain which party is telling the truth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/enforce/enforcementguide/court/magistrates-hearing.htm#P50_5975 Explanation of term]&lt;/ref&gt; They are generally used when a defendant pleads guilty to an offence (as in ''R v Newton'' itself), but there are factual issues (relating, for example, to the appropriate sentence) that need to be resolved between the prosecution and defence.

==Origin==
The name stems from a 1983 case, ''R v Newton'', in which the defendant admitted [[buggery]] but claimed his wife had given her consent.&lt;ref&gt;"Legal Competence in Environmental Health" Moran,T: London, E &amp;FN Spon, 1997 {{ISBN|0-419-23000-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Court of Appeal]] ruled that in such cases there were three ways of resolving the issue. It may be possible to obtain the answer from a Jury by directing them to consider whether there is the necessary intent for a specific offence or whether a lesser offence which does not require intent is made out. If that is not possible then ''either'' 
*evidence could be heard from both sides and a conclusion reached on the matter which was the root of the problem, ''or''
* no evidence heard but  submissions  analysed and, where a substantial doubt still persisted,   benefit be  given to the [[defendant]].

== Procedure and discussion==
The Newton Hearing itself operates like a "mini trial", with a judge deciding the disputed points based upon testimony and submissions, rather than a jury.&lt;ref name="hse"&gt;http://www.hse.gov.uk/enforce/enforcementguide/court/magistrates-hearing.htm#P50_5975&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] is on the prosecution, who must prove their case [[beyond reasonable doubt]].&lt;ref name="hse" /&gt;

For a defendant, there is a balance of [[Risk perception|risk and benefit]] to consider. As the Newton hearing takes court time, resources, and perhaps witness testimony, if unsuccessful it will reduce any [[sentencing credit]] that might otherwise have been obtained. This aspect has been criticized, on the basis that no such risk exists for the prosecutors, and therefore the Newton Hearing could "allow unrealistic, bullying or foolhardy prosecutors to force defendants to choose between having a Newton hearing and playing it safe".&lt;ref name="harris"&gt;http://www.criminallawandjustice.co.uk/features/Newton-Hearings-%E2%80%93-Procedure-Stacked-Against-Defence&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense a Newton hearing may be seen as stacked heavily against a defendant, who must prove the entirety of their concern in order not to suffer from it:&lt;ref name="harris" /&gt;
: "The practice operates as a disincentive to opt for a Newton hearing. Many defence advocates avoid Newton hearings because, unless they are resolved entirely in the defendant’s favour, some credit is likely to be lost and it may be that any gains made by the Newton hearing are swallowed up (or worse, outweighed) by the reduction in credit... There is no “remission” for being successful in part, save that the credit for pleading was not reduced further. In the situation where D has required the prosecution to prove its assertions to the criminal standard and the result has been a success and a defeat on each side, why should D be punished, and the prosecution not? Is it not D’s right to require such assertions to be proved? The situation appears to be stacked against the defence, to induce acquiescence where arguments may legitimately be taken against the prosecution..."&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name="harris" /&gt;

==Notable cases==

These include:
*R v Newton [1983] [[Criminal Law Review|Crim LR]] 198
*R v Ahmed (1985) Crim LR 250, [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|CA]]
*R v Mirza (1993) 14 [[Criminal Appeal Reports (Sentencing)|Cr App R (S)]] 64, [1992] Crim LR 600
*R v Odey (1985) Crim LR 55
*R v Mirza (1992) Crim LR 600
*R v Ndikum (2008) The News (Portsmouth)&lt;ref&gt;Tuesday 15 April 2008: article by Victoria Taylor ''Student’s nightmare over false rape claim''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Irish law==
In 2008, [[James Hamilton (Director of Public Prosecutions)|James Hamilton]], then [[Director of Public Prosecutions (Ireland)|Director of Public Prosecutions]], expressed doubt as to whether a Newton hearing would be compatible with the [[Constitution of Ireland]]'s guarantee of the right to a jury trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference  |first=James |last=Hamilton |authorlink=James Hamilton (Director of Public Prosecutions) |publisher=International Society for the Reform of Criminal Law |date=15 July 2008 |location=Dublin |conference=Codifying the Criminal Law: Modern Initiatives |url=https://www.dppireland.ie/filestore/documents/Speech_to_International_Society_for_the_Reform_of_Criminal_Law_Conference_15_July_2008_PDF.pdf#page=4 |format=PDF |title= A single offence of unlawful killing? |page=4 |quote=The Newton hearing is now well established in the UK. However, as already discussed, in this jurisdiction such a procedure may infringe express constitutional guarantees. It is at least arguable that under the Constitution of Ireland a jury determination of serious disputes concerning the character of an offence was required. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, such hearings have been held, including in an [[Anglo Irish Bank]] trial in 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/courts/recent-innovation-may-feature-in-sentencing-30196886.html|title=Recent innovation may feature in sentencing|last=McDonald|first=Dearbhail|date=18 April  2014|work=[[Irish Independent]]|accessdate=31 May 2017 |quote=The witness was giving evidence yesterday in a Newton hearing. }}; {{cite news|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/solicitor-denies-giving-any-legal-advice-over-maple-10-deal-266823.html |title=Solicitor denies giving any legal advice over Maple 10 deal|last=Gallagher|first=Conor|first2=Declan |last2=Brennan|date=29 April 2014|work=[[Irish Examiner]]|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a trial in the juryless [[Special Criminal Court]] in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2017/0531/879354-jonathan-dowdall/|title=Man alleges Dowdall said he was IRA member|date=31 May 2017|work=[[RTÉ.ie]]|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
It became the official state policy of [[South Africa]] after April 1994,&lt;ref name="macdonald06"/&gt; and it is enshrined in [[Chapter One of the Constitution of South Africa]]. It was also a prominent concept in the 1955 [[Freedom Charter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=David|first1=Everatt|title=The Origins of Non-Racialism: White opposition to apartheid in the 1950s|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/chapter/1944489|accessdate=6 February 2018|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has been criticized as vague, and carrying different meanings even among people sharing the same ideological tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ratcliffe|first1=Peter|title=Race, Ethnicity And Nation: International Perspectives On Social Conflict|date=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135361853|page=78|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wHKOAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA78|language=en|access-date=March 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest use of the term was by [[Karl Polanyi]] in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=non-racialism|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/non-racialism|website=Oxford Dictionaries|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neville Alexander]] defines non-racialism as the acknowledgement of the nonexistence of race as a scientific fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ratcliffe|first1=Peter|title=Race, Ethnicity And Nation: International Perspectives On Social Conflict|date=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135361853|pages=80-81|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wHKOAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA81|language=en|access-date=March 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Mugabe]] professed a belief in non-racialism in the early 1960s, but later rejected the concept and harshly criticized [[Nelson Mandela]] for his embrace of the ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Fascinating' video of Mugabe talking 'non-racialism' like Mandela goes viral on social media|url=https://www.news24.com/Africa/Zimbabwe/watch-fascinating-video-of-mugabe-talking-non-racialism-like-mandela-20170916|accessdate=6 February 2018|work=News24|date=16 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-racialism is a stated core policy of the [[African National Congress]]. Power struggles between supporters of non-racialism and a [[black nationalist]] minority within the party led to establishment of the breakaway [[Pan Africanist Congress]] in 1959.&lt;ref name="directaction"&gt;{{cite web|title=1949-1961: Period of direct action, non violent resistance and protest|url=http://www.anc.org.za/content/1949-1961-period-direct-action-non-violent-resistance-and-protest|website=African National Congress|accessdate=6 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Number 11''' is a  novel by British writer [[Jonathan Coe]], published in 2015. The book explores the changing social, economical and cultural landscape of the United Kingdom in the early [[21st century]]. It is connected to Coe's previous novel [[What a Carve Up! (novel)|''What a Carve Up!'']], through shared themes and references to characters and events from the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/authors/jonathan-coe-interview-number-eleven/|title=Jonathan Coe: poking fun at broken Britain|last=Walton|first=James|date=November 1, 2015|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2016-08-14|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
The book comprises five parts with interconnected plot lines and multiple points of view.

''The Black Tower'' takes place in rural [[Yorkshire and the Humber|Yorkshire]] in 2003, soon after the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]] and the death of [[David Kelly (weapons expert)|David Kelly]]. It follows the beginning of the friendship between ten-year-old girls Rachel and Alison as they try to decipher mysterious happenings around the village where Rachel's grandparents live. ''The Comeback'' is set in 2011 and focuses on Alison and her mother Val, now living in [[Birmingham]]. Alison, estranged from Rachel due to a misunderstanding after coming out as [[gay]] to her, is trying to form new relationships. Val, a former one-hit-wonder singer and a librarian facing reduced working hours, is offered the chance to appear on a [[Reality television|reality show]], which she accepts in the hopes of reviving her career. Although she gets along with the other participants, the footage is heavily edited to paint her in a bad light, leading to a hugely negative response from the audience. Alison watches horrified as her mother is made to undertake very unpleasant and humiliating tasks, until she returns home traumatised. ''The Crystal Garden'' follows Laura, a lecturer at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]]. Over the course of a weekend in 2011, she tells Rachel, now a student there, the story of her recently deceased husband's obsession with a short film he had seen as a child, and how the search for it led to his death.''The Winshaw Prize'' is the story of how young policeman Nathan Pilbeam tries to find the connection between the apparently accidental deaths of two [[Stand-up comedy|comedians]]. His approach, which advocates understanding the political and social context of a crime, allows him to not only predict the next target but identify the killer, a man who believes that comedy is making people complacent and is a danger to democracy.

In ''What a Whopper!'', Rachel is hired as a private tutor for the children of a very rich family. She lives in their house in [[Kensington]], in a section reserved for staff, while work to build an extravagant eleven-level basement to the house is being undertaken. She meets Laura again, who has a new post trying to promote humanitarian values in a financial organisation. A chance encounter with Val, who now has to attend [[food bank]]s for sustenance, leads to her reconnecting with Alison, serving a brief term in prison after being framed for [[Benefit fraud in the United Kingdom|benefit fraud]]. At the same time, secondary characters from throughout the novel who are wealthy residents of the area mysteriously go missing, with a promoted Pilbeam researching the case. Rachel struggles to understand and adapt to her employers' mentality, lifestyle and activities, which, along with personal difficulties, culminates in her having a [[Mental breakdown|breakdown]]. The final chapters show that Rachel, Alison and Val are recovering from their problems, while the missing people are implied to have been abducted in retribution for their past behaviour.

==Critical reception==
In a review for the ''[[Financial Times]]'', Suzi Feay described the novel as "a richly enjoyable, densely textured and thought-provoking entertainment".&lt;ref name="ftreviewnumberfeay"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Feay|first1=Suzi|title=‘Number 11’, by Jonathan Coe|url=https://next.ft.com/content/9302b486-83e7-11e5-8e80-1574112844fd|accessdate=May 4, 2016|work=Financial Times|date=November 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Scotsman]]'', Allan Massie wrote a good review, concluding that "one should be grateful for any novel which, like this one, is devoted to the great cause of cheering us all up, no matter how indignant the author may often be.".&lt;ref name="scotsmanbookreview"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Massie|first1=Allan|title=Book review: Number 11 by Jonathan Coe|url=http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/culture/books/book-review-number-11-by-jonathan-coe-1-3961133|accessdate=May 4, 2016|work=The Scotsman|date=November 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Erica Wagner of the ''[[New Statesman]]'' concluded that while the novel could be seen as preachy, it makes good points about London under austerity measures.&lt;ref name="newstatesmanjonathancoewagner"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wagner|first1=Erica|title=Jonathan Coe's Number 11 is a bitingly dark portrait of society|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/nature/2016/05/s-no-moth-it-s-wisp-delight-wing|accessdate=May 4, 2016|work=New Statesman|date=November 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Robert Epstein of ''[[The Independent]]'' deplored that the novel was "too obvious, both in its targets and in their subsequent takedown".&lt;ref name="independentjonathancoenumber11"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Epstein|first1=Robert|title=Jonathan Coe Number 11: 'Slating the obvious' - book review|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/jonathan-coe-number-11-slating-the-obvious-a6733681.html|accessdate=May 4, 2016|work=The Independent|date=November 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The London Evening Standard]]'', Andrew Neather conceded that the novel was "first-class entertainment", but he lamented that it did not live up to a proper satire.&lt;ref name="standardreviewneather"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Neather|first1=Andrew|title=Number 11 by Jonathan Coe - review|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/books/number-11-by-jonathan-coe-review-a3113146.html|accessdate=May 4, 2016|work=London Evening Standard|date=November 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing it for ''[[The Guardian]]'', Alex Clark called it "a political novel" as well as an "interrogation of the purposes and efficacy of humour in exposing society’s ills, and a spoof on horror B-movies"&lt;ref name="theguardianreview"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clark|first1=Alex|title=Number 11 by Jonathan Coe review – a sequel to What a Carve Up!|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/11/number-11-jonathan-coe-review-what-a-carve-up|accessdate=May 3, 2016|work=The Guardian|date=November 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Ottawa Protocol on Combating Antisemitism''' is an action plan which "note and reaffirm the [[London Declaration on Combating Antisemitism]] as a template document for the fight against Antisemitism". It was developed during the second annual Conference and Summit of the [[Inter-parliamentary Coalition for Combating Antisemitism]] (ICCA) which took place in Ottawa in November, 2010, by Parliamentarians and experts from over 50 countries around the globe.&lt;ref name=ICCA&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ottawa Protocol on Combating Antisemitism|url=http://www.antisem.org/archive/ottawa-protocol-on-combating-antisemitism/|publisher=ICCA|accessdate=13 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CPCCA&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Report of the Inquiry Panel Released - July 7, 2011|url=http://www.cpcca.ca/home.htm|publisher=CPCCA|accessdate=13 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It endorsed the [[Working Definition of Antisemitism]].

==Background==
The ICCA has brought together some 46 countries and over 250 parliamentarians from around the world to lead the fight against global Antisemitism. The ICCA's principal purpose is to share knowledge, experience and recommendations in an attempt to deal more effectively with contemporary Antisemitism (i.e. old and [[new antisemitism]]).&lt;ref name=CPCCA /&gt;
The first annual conference of the "[[Inter-parliamentary Coalition for Combating Antisemitism]]" was held in London, England in February, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the ICCA|url=http://www.antisem.org/about-us/|publisher=ICCA|accessdate=13 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada has hosted the second gathering of the ICCA, from November 7-9th, 2010, in Ottawa. The conference "provided the opportunity for delegates to explore data and exchange best practices to learn about the best ways to combat Antisemitism around the world".&lt;ref name=CPCCA /&gt; The Ottawa Protocol was the outcome of the 2010 Conference on Combating Antisemitism.

==Content==
The protocol deals with 3 fundamental issues:&lt;ref name=ICCA /&gt;

===Concerns===
{{Quotation| We are concerned that, since the London Conference in February 2009, there continues to be a dramatic increase in recorded Antisemitic hate crimes and attacks targeting Jewish persons and property, and Jewish religious, educational and communal institutions. We remain alarmed by ongoing state-sanctioned genocidal Antisemitism and related extremist ideologies [...] We are appalled by the resurgence of the classic anti-Jewish libels [...] We are alarmed by the explosion of Antisemitism and hate on the Internet [...] We are concerned by the reported incidents of Antisemitism on campuses.}}

===Reaffirmation===
{{Quotation| We renew our call for national Governments, Parliaments, international institutions, political and civic leaders, NGOs, and civil society to affirm democratic and human values, build societies based on respect and citizenship and combat any manifestations of Antisemitism and all forms of discrimination. We reaffirm the EUMC [...] working definition of Antisemitism.}}

===Commitments===
{{Quotation| Calling on our Governments to uphold international commitments on combating Antisemitism [...] Calling on Parliaments and Governments to adopt the EUMC Working Definition of Antisemitism and anchor its enforcement in existing law [...] Encouraging countries throughout the world to establish mechanisms for reporting and monitoring on domestic and international Antisemitism [...] Encouraging the leaders of all religious faiths – represented also at this Conference – to use all means possible to combat Antisemitism and all forms of hatred and discrimination [...] Calling on the Parliamentary Forum of the Community of Democracies to make the combating of hatred and Antisemitism a priority in their work [...] Working with universities to encourage them to combat Antisemitism with the same seriousness with which they confront other forms of hate [...] Universities should use the EUMC Working Definition of Antisemitism as a basis for education, training and orientation [...] Establishing an International Task Force of Internet specialists {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} parliamentarians and experts to create common indicators to identify and monitor Antisemitism and other manifestations of hate online and to develop policy recommendations for Governments and international frameworks to address these problems.}}

==Responses==
Jason Kenney, Canada Immigration and Multiculturalism Minister, has said: 
:"The Ottawa Protocol complements what Canada is already doing to combat hatred and discrimination, including anti-Semitism. We are a member of the Task Force for International Cooperation on Holocaust Education, Remembrance and Research. Here at home, we have launched programs to promote integration and social cohesion of Canadians from all backgrounds."&lt;ref name=CIC&gt;{{cite web|title=News Release – Canada becomes first country to sign the Ottawa Protocol|url=http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/department/media/releases/2011/2011-09-19.asp|publisher=Citizenship and Immigration Canada|accessdate=13 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Baird, Canada Foreign Affairs Minister has said:
:"Signing the Ottawa Protocol signals our continued commitment to leading a coordinated global effort to fight anti-Semitism. Just as Canada is moving ahead to develop and build a [[National Holocaust Monument]] in the National Capital Region, we also plan to take our commitment to parliamentarians around the world and suggest that they join us in signing the Protocol." &lt;ref name=CIC /&gt;

Professor Irwin Cotler, MP and Chair of the Inter-Parliamentary Coalition for Combating Antisemitism, said that:
:"Parliamentarians normally don’t easily agree on things nor even something as compelling as antisemitism yet unanimously adopted the Ottawa Protocol to combat antisemitism.  In effect what Professor Wiesel was describing, what the Ottawa Conference documented, what the Ottawa Protocol captured, what the endorsement this evening is achieving and giving expression to is a need to combat this oldest and most enduring and toxic of hatreds which regrettably is rearing its ugly head again. The protocol, the Ottawa Protocol which is being endorsed this evening by the government is not only a compelling characterization and indeed definition of antisemitism old and new but also sets forth a blueprint for action, indeed is a template for action by governments and Parliamentarians all over the world."&lt;ref name=CFCA&gt;{{cite web|title=Irwin Cotler delivers remarks at signing of Ottawa Protocol on Combating Antisemitism|url=http://antisemitism.org.il/article/67643/irwin-cotler-delivers-remarks-signing-ottawa-protocol-combating-antisemitism|publisher=CFCA|accessdate=13 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenneth L. Marcus, Director, Initiative to Combat Anti-Semitism and Anti-Israelism in America's Educational Systems, has written:
:"This protocol, which was unanimously adopted by representatives of over fifty countries’ parliaments, including the U.S. Congress, will provide a critical new tool to combat resurgent campus anti-Semitism [...] What is most notable, however, is the manner in which the Protocol proposes that government and university leaders address campus anti-Semitism, i.e., by naming and condemning it with the same specificity used in other instances of hate and racism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ottawa Protocol|url=http://www.jewishresearch.org/quad/1110_marcus.html|publisher=Institute for Jewish and Community Research|accessdate=13 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The party first contested national elections in [[Greek legislative election, 1950|1950]],&lt;ref name=NS&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen]] &amp; Philip Stöver (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p836 {{ISBN|978-3-8329-5609-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; when it won three seats in the [[Hellenic Parliament]] with 2.6% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalelectionsdatabase.com/index.php/tables/index/greece/national-lower-house/1950 - National Lower House Elections (1950)] Global Elections Database&lt;/ref&gt; However, it did not contest any further elections.&lt;ref name=NS/&gt;

The '''Polish Corridor''' ({{lang-de|Polnischer Korridor}}; {{lang-pl|Pomorze, Korytarz polski}}), also known as '''Danzig Corridor''', '''Corridor to the Sea''' or '''Gdańsk Corridor''', was a territory located in the region of [[Pomerelia]] ([[Pomeranian Voivodeship (1919–1939)|Pomeranian Voivodeship]], eastern [[Pomerania]], formerly part of [[West Prussia]]), which provided the [[Second Republic of Poland]] (1920–1939) with access to the [[Baltic Sea]], thus dividing the bulk of [[Germany]] from the province of [[East Prussia]]. The [[Free City of Danzig]] (now the Polish city of [[Gdańsk]]) was separate from both Poland and Germany. A similar territory, also occasionally referred to as a corridor, had been connected to the [[Polish Crown]] as part of [[Royal Prussia]] during the period 1466–1772.&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Western Civilization'': ''Then came the acquisition of Prussia (separated from Brandenburg by the "Polish corridor")'' page 382, author Roland N. Stromberg Dorsey Press 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Scandinavians in History''. "Brandenburg, by the acquisition of Eastern Pomerania besides other territories within the empire was firmly established on the Baltic, though a Polish corridor running between Eastern Pomerania and East Prussia to Danzig denied her all she desired", page 174, author Stanley Mease Toyne. Ayer Publishing 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==

According to German historian [[Hartmut Boockmann]] the term "Corridor" was first used by Polish politicians,&lt;ref&gt;Hartmut Boockmann, Ostpreussen und Westpreussen, Siedler 2002, p. 401, {{ISBN|3-88680-212-4}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=e9dpAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Hartmut+Boockmann&amp;q=korridor&amp;pgis=1#search]&lt;/ref&gt; while Polish historian [[Grzegorz Lukomski]] writes that the word was coined by [[German nationalist]] propaganda of the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adiutor-mars.com.pl/katalog_wyd/opisy/korytarz_2000.htm Grzegorz Lukomski, The problem of Corridor in the Polish-German relationships and on the international stage 1918 - 1939.

The equivalent German term is ''Polnischer Korridor''. Polish names include ''korytarz polski'' ("Polish corridor") and ''korytarz gdański'' ("Gdańsk corridor"); however, reference to the region as a corridor came to be regarded as offensive by interwar Polish diplomats. Among the harshest critics of the term ''corridor'' was Polish Foreign Minister [[Józef Beck]], who in his May 5, 1939 speech in [[Sejm]] (Polish parliament) said: "I am insisting that the term ''Pomeranian Voivodeship'' should be used. The word ''corridor'' is an artificial idea, as this land has been Polish for centuries, with a small percentage of German settlers".&lt;ref&gt;[http://kronika.sejm.gov.pl/kronika.99/text/pl/an-71.htm Official webpage of Polish Sejm, Chronicle of speeches]&lt;/ref&gt; Poles would commonly refer to the region as ''Pomorze Gdańskie'' ("Gdańsk Pomerania, [[Pomerelia]]") or simply ''Pomorze'' ("[[Pomerania]]"), or as ''województwo pomorskie'' ("[[Pomeranian voivodeship (1919-1939)|Pomeranian Voivodeship]]"), which was the administrative name for the region.

==Background==

=== History of the area ===
{{Main|Pomerelia}}
In the 10th century, Pomerelia was settled by [[Pomeranians (Slavic tribe)|Slavic Pomeranians]], ancestors of the [[Kashubians]], who were subdued by [[Boleslaw I of Poland]]. In the 11th century, they created an independent duchy.&lt;ref name=Minahan&gt;James Minahan, ''One Europe, Many Nations: A Historical Dictionary of European National Groups'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 2000, p.375, {{ISBN|0-313-30984-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1116/1121, [[Pomerania]] was again conquered by Poland. In 1138, following the death of Duke [[Bolesław III Wrymouth|Bolesław III]], Poland was [[History of Poland during the Piast dynasty#Fragmentation of the realm (1138 – c. 1314)|fragmented into several semi-independent principalities]]. The [[Samborides]], ''principes'' in [[Pomerelia]], gradually evolved into independent dukes, who ruled the duchy until 1294. Before Pomerelia regained independence in 1227,&lt;ref name=Minahan /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W.D. Halsey, L. Shores, Bernard Johnston, Emanuel Friedman, ''Merit Students Encyclopedia'', Macmillan Educational Corporation, 1979, p.195: Pomerelia, independent in 1227 and thereafter&lt;/ref&gt; their dukes were [[vassal]]s of Poland and [[Denmark]]. Since 1308, [[Teutonic takeover of Danzig|following succession wars between Poland and Brandenburg]], Pomerelia was subjugated by the [[Monastic state of the Teutonic Knights]] in [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]]. In 1466, with the [[Second Peace of Thorn (1466)|second Peace of Thorn]], Pomerelia became part of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] as a part of autonomous [[Royal Prussia]]. After the [[Partitions of Poland|First Partition of Poland]] in 1772 it was annexed by the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and named [[West Prussia]], and became a constituent part of the new [[German Empire]] in 1871. Thus the Polish Corridor was not an entirely new creation: the territory assigned to Poland had been an integral part of Poland prior to 1772, but with a large degree of autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;''A Lasting Peace'' page 127, James Clerk Maxwell Garnett, Heinrich F. Koeppler – 1940&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arms and Policy, 1939–1944 page 40, Hoffman Nickerson – 1945&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Congress of Vienna: A Study in Allied Unity, 1812–1822'' page 279, Harold Nicolson.

=== Allied plans for a corridor in the aftermath of World War I ===
After the [[First World War]], [[Second Republic of Poland|Poland was to be re-established]] as an independent [[State (polity)|state]]. Since a Polish state had not existed since the [[Congress of Vienna]], the future republic's territory had to be defined.

Giving [[Poland]] access to the sea was one of the guarantees proposed by [[United States President]] [[Woodrow Wilson]] in his [[Fourteen Points]] of 1918. The thirteenth of Wilson's points was:
: "An independent Polish state should be erected which should include the territories inhabited by indisputably Polish populations, which should be assured a free and secure access to the sea, and whose political and economic independence and territorial integrity should be guaranteed by international covenant."&lt;ref&gt;[http://usinfo.state.gov/usa/infousa/facts/democrac/51.htm The text of Woodrow's Fourteen Points Speech] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050622085518/http://usinfo.state.gov/usa/infousa/facts/democrac/51.htm |date=2005-06-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following arguments were behind the creation of the corridor:

====Ethnographic reasons====
Ethnic situation was one of the reasons for returning the area to the restored Poland.&lt;ref&gt;''The Danzig Dilemma; a Study in Peacemaking by Compromise: A Study in Peacemaking by Compromise''-"This report was origin of the famous Polish corridor to the Baltic which the Commission proposed on ethnographic grounds as well as to give Poland her promised free and secure access to the sea", John Brown Mason, page 50&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the population in the area was Polish.&lt;ref name=katyn&gt;Anna M.

==== Economic reasons ====

The Poles held the view that without direct access to the [[Baltic Sea]], Poland's economic independence would be illusory.&lt;ref name="thorburn54"&gt;''Out of the Ashes'' James Thorburn Muirhead 1941, page 54&lt;/ref&gt; Around 60.5% of Polish import trade and 55.1% of exports went through the area.&lt;ref&gt;The Crises of France's East Central European Diplomacy, 1933-1938 - page 40
Anthony Tihamer Komjathy - 1976&lt;/ref&gt; The report of the Polish Commission presented to the Allied Supreme Council said: 
:"1,600,000 Germans in East Prussia can be adequately protected by securing for them freedom of trade across the corridor, whereas it would be impossible to give an adequate outlet to the inhabitants of the new Polish state (numbering 25,000,000) if this outlet had to be guaranteed across the territory of an alien and probably hostile Power."&lt;ref&gt;''The Danzig dilemma: a study in peacemaking by compromise'' by John Brown Mason Stanford university press 1946, page 49&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[United Kingdom]] eventually accepted this argument.&lt;ref name="thorburn54"/&gt; The suppression of the Polish Corridor would have abolished the economic ability of Poland to resist dependence on Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Review of Reviews page 67

== Incorporation into the Second Polish Republic ==

During [[World War I]], the [[Central Powers]] had forced the [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russian]] troops out of [[Congress Poland]] and [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], as manifested in the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Russia–Central Powers)|Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] on 3 March 1918. Following the [[Battle of Vittorio Veneto|military defeat of Austria-Hungary]], an [[Second Polish Republic|independent Polish republic]] was declared in Western [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] on 3 November 1918, the same day [[Armistice of villa Giusti|Austria signed the armistice]]. The collapse of [[German Empire|Imperial Germany]]'s [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], and the subsequent withdrawal of her remaining occupation forces after the [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|Armistice of Compiègne]] on 11 November allowed the republic led by [[Roman Dmowski]] and [[Józef Piłsudski]] to seize control over the former [[Congress Poland|Congress Polish areas]]. Also in November, [[German Revolution of 1918–19|the revolution in Germany]] forced the [[Kaiser]]'s abdication and gave way to the establishment of the [[Weimar Republic]]. Starting in December, the [[Polish-Ukrainian War]] expanded the Polish republic's territory to include [[Volhynia]] and parts of Eastern Galicia, while at the same time the German [[Province of Posen]] (where even according to the German made 1910 census 61,5% of the population was Polish) was severed by the [[Greater Poland Uprising (1918–1919)|Greater Poland uprising]], which succeeded in attaching most of the province's territory to Poland by January 1919. This led Weimar's [[Otto Landsberg]] and [[Rudolf Breitscheid]] to call for an armed force to secure Germany's remaining eastern territories (some of which contained significant Polish minorities, primarily on the former [[Prussian partition]] territories). The call was answered by the minister of defense [[Gustav Noske]], who decreed support for raising and deploying volunteer "[[Grenzschut]]z" forces to secure [[East Prussia]], [[Silesia]] and the [[Netze District]].&lt;ref&gt;T.

Articles 27 and 28 of the treaty&lt;ref&gt;[[Treaty of Versailles]], §§1-30 [http://www.firstworldwar.com/source/versailles1-30.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; ruled on the territorial shape of the corridor, while articles 89 to 93 ruled on transit, citizenship and property issues.&lt;ref&gt;[[Treaty of Versailles]], §§31-117 [http://www.firstworldwar.com/source/versailles31-117.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Per the terms of the Versailles treaty, which was put into effect on 20 January 1920, the corridor was established as Poland's access to the [[Baltic Sea]] from 70% of the dissolved province of [[West Prussia]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bpb.de/publikationen/00557823048780774195080500255372,3,0,Tausend_Jahre_wechselvoller_Geschichte.html#art3 BPB on Poland]&lt;/ref&gt; consisting of a small part of [[Pomerania]] with around 140&amp;nbsp;km of coastline including the [[Hel Peninsula]], and 69&amp;nbsp;km without it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The German author [[Christian Raitz von Frentz]] writes that after First World War ended, the Polish government tried to reverse the systematic [[Germanization]] from former decades.&lt;ref name="Frentz"/&gt; [[Frederick the Great]] ([[King in Prussia|King in/of Prussia]] from 1740 to 1786) settled around 300,000 colonists in the eastern provinces of [[Prussia]] and aimed at a removal of the Polish nobility, which he treated with contempt. Frederick also described Poles as "slovenly Polish trash" and compared them to the [[Iroquois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Ritter|first= Gerhard|authorlink= Gerhard Ritter|title= Frederick the Great: A Historical Profile|year= 1974|publisher= University of California Press|location= Berkeley|isbn= 0-520-02775-2|pages= 179–180 |quote= It has been estimated that during his reign 300,000 individuals settled in Prussia.... While the commission for colonization established in the Bismarck era could in the course of two decades bring no more than 11,957 families to the eastern territories, Frederick settled a total of 57,475.... It increased the German character of the population in the monarchy's provinces to a very significant degree.... in West Prussia where he wished to drive out the Polish nobility and bring as many of their large estates as possible into German hands.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
"In fact from Hitler to Hans we find frequent references and Jews as Indians. This, too, was a long standing trope. It can be traced back to Frederick the Great, who likened the 'slovenly Polish trash' in newly' reconquered West Prussia to Iroquois."

Prussia pursued a second [[colonization]] aimed at Germanisation after 1832.&lt;ref&gt;Wielka historia Polski t. 4 Polska w czasach walk o niepodległość (1815 - 1864). Od niewoli do niepodległości (1864 - 1918) Marian Zagórniak, Józef Buszko 2003 page 186.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Prussians passed laws aiming at Germanisation of the provinces [[Province of Posen|of Posen]] and [[West Prussia]] in the late 19th century. The [[Prussian Settlement Commission]] established a further 154,000 colonists, including locals, in the provinces of Posen and West Prussia before World War I. Military personnel were included in the population census. A number of German civil servants and merchants were introduced to the area, which influenced the population status.&lt;ref name="historia1918"/&gt;

According to Richard Blanke, an American historian of German descent&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://web.ku.edu/~eceurope/hist557/bibpt1rev.htm |title=Part I: to 1914 |publisher= Web.ku.edu |date= |accessdate= 2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Specify|date= January 2011}}, 421,029 Germans lived in the area in 1910, making up 42.5% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=80r6Mbnxf8IC&amp;pg=PA243&amp;vq=Appendix&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;sig=P4PGx7XuXUgmfwHVJYLJxkosjJEpage Orphans of Versailles Appendix B]&lt;/ref&gt; Blanke has been criticised by Christian Raitz von Frentz, who has classified his book as part of a series on the subject that has an anti-Polish bias; additionally Polish professor A.

&lt;/ref&gt;

German political scientist [[Stefan Wolff]], Professor at the [[University of Birmingham]], says that the actions of Polish state officials after the corridor's establishment followed "a course of assimilation and oppression".&lt;ref name="Wolf"&gt;Stefan Wolff, ''The German Question Since 1919: An Analysis with Key Documents'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 2003, p.33, {{ISBN|0-275-97269-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, a large number of Germans left Poland after 1918: according to Wolff, 800,000 Germans had left Poland by 1923,&lt;ref name="Wolf"/&gt; according to [[Gotthold Rhode]], 575,000 left the former province of Posen and the corridor after the war,&lt;ref name=Blanke3334&gt;{{cite book|title= Orphans of Versailles: the Germans in Western Poland, 1918-1939|first= Richard|last= Blanke|publisher= University Press of Kentucky|year= 1993|isbn= 0-8131-1803-4|url= https://www.google.de/books?id=80r6Mbnxf8IC&amp;pg=PA33|pages= 33–34|accessdate= 2009-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to Herrmann Rauschning, 800,000 Germans had left between 1918 and 1926,&lt;ref name=Blanke3334/&gt; contemporary author Alfons Krysinski estimated 800,000 plus 100,000 from East Upper Silesia,&lt;ref name=Blanke3334/&gt; the contemporary German statistics say 592,000 Germans had left by 1921,&lt;ref name=Blanke3334/&gt; other Polish scholars say that up to a million Germans left.&lt;ref name=Blanke3334/&gt; Polish author [[Władysław Kulski]] says that a number of them were civil servants with no roots in the province and around 378,000,{{Clarify|does the number refer to civil servants? page number would be nice|date=September 2009}} and this is to a lesser degree is confirmed by some German sources such as Hermann Rauschning.&lt;ref name="Blank"/&gt;
Lewis Bernstein Namier raised the question as to whether many of the Germans who left were actually settlers without roots in the area - Namier remarked in 1933 "a question must be raised how many of those Germans had originally been planted artificially in that country by the Prussian Government."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Y702017As5MC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Lewis+Bernstein+Namier+In+the+Margin+of+History%E2%80%8E#PPA45,M1 In the Margin of History, page 45] Lewis Bernstein Namier - 1969 303&lt;/ref&gt;

The above-mentioned Richard Blanke, in his book ''Orphans of Versailles'', gives several reasons for the exodus of the German population:

* A number of former settlers from the [[Prussian Settlement Commission]] who settled in the area after 1886 in order to germanise it were in some cases given a month to leave, in other cases they were told to leave at once.&lt;ref name="Blank"/&gt;
* Poland found itself under threat during the [[Polish-Bolshevik war]] of 1919-1921,&lt;ref name="Blank"/&gt; and the German population feared that Bolshevik forces would control Poland. Migration to Germany was a way to avoid conscription and participation in the war.
* State-employed Germans such as judges, prosecutors, teachers and officials left as Poland did not renew their employment contracts. German industrial workers also left due to fear of lower-wage [[competition]]. Many Germans had become economically dependent on Prussian state aid as Prussia had fought the "Polish problem" in its provinces.&lt;ref name="Blank"/&gt;
* Germans refused to accept living in a Polish state.&lt;ref name="Blank"/&gt; As [[Lewis Bernstein Namier]] said: "Some Germans undoubtedly left because they would not live under the dominion of a race which they had previously oppressed and despised."&lt;ref&gt;In the Margin of History, page 45 Lewis Bernstein Namier - (pub. 1969)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Germans feared that the Poles would seek reprisals after over a century of harassment and [[discrimination]] by the Prussian and German state against the Polish population.&lt;ref name="Blank"/&gt;
* Social and linguistic isolation: While the population was mixed, only Poles were required to be bilingual. The Germans usually did not learn Polish. When Polish became the only official language in Polish-majority provinces, their situation became difficult. The Poles shunned Germans, which contributed to their isolation.&lt;ref name="Blank"/&gt;
* Lower standards of living. Poland was a much poorer country than Germany.&lt;ref name="Blank"/&gt;
* Former [[Nazi]] politician and later opponent [[Hermann Rauschning]] wrote that 10% of Germans were unwilling to remain in Poland regardless of their treatment, and another 10% were workers from other parts of the German Empire with no roots in the region.&lt;ref name="Blank"/&gt;

Blanke says that official encouragement by the Polish state played a secondary role in the German exodus.&lt;ref name="Blank"&gt;
''Orphans of Versailles: The Germans in Western Poland, 1918-1939'' pages 32-48 Richard Blanke
University Press of Kentucky, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Christian Raitz von Frentz notes "that many of the repressive measures were taken by local and regional Polish authorities in defiance of Acts of Parliament and government decrees, which more often than not conformed with the minorities treaty, the [[Geneva Convention]] and their interpretation by the [[League Council|League council]] - though it is also true that some of the central authorities tacitly tolerated local initiatives against the German population."&lt;ref name=Frentz&gt;''A Lesson Forgotten: Minority Protection Under the League of Nations: The Case of the German Minority in Poland, 1920-193'' page 8 LIT Verlag Berlin-Hamburg-Münster, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; While there were demonstrations and protests and occasional violence against Germans, they were at a local level, and officials were quick to point out that they were a backlash against former discrimination against Poles.&lt;ref name="Blank"/&gt; There were other demonstrations when Germans showed disloyalty during the Polish-Bolshevik war&lt;ref name="Blank"/&gt; as the [[Red Army]] announced the return to the pre-war borders of 1914.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1920/08/16/archives/russians-hoist-the-german-flag-over-soldau-say-polish-corridor-will.html NY Times report]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite popular pressure and occasional local actions, perhaps as many as 80% of Germans emigrated more or less voluntarily.&lt;ref name="Blank"/&gt;

Helmut Lippelt writes that Germany used the existence of German minority in Poland for political ends and as part of its revisionist demands, which resulted in Polish countermeasures. Polish Prime Minister [[Władysław Sikorski]] stated in 1923 that the de-Germanization of these territories had to be ended by vigorous and quick liquidation of property and eviction of German "Optanten" (Germans who refused to accept Polish citizenship and per the Versailles Treaty were to leave Poland) so that German nationalists would realise that their view of the temporary state of Polish western border was wrong.&lt;ref name=Lippelt&gt;

To Lippelt this was partially a reaction to the German claims and partially Polish nationalism, urging to exclude the German element. In turn, anti-Polish prejudice fueled German policy.&lt;ref name=Lippelt/&gt;

== Impact on the East Prussian plebiscite ==

In the period leading up to the [[East Prussian plebiscite]] in July 1920, the Polish authorities tried to prevent traffic through the Corridor, interrupting postal, telegraphic and telephone communication.&lt;ref name=Butler /&gt; On March 10, 1920, the British representative on the Marienwerder Plebiscite Commission, H.D. Beaumont, wrote of numerous continuing difficulties being made by Polish officials and added "as a result, the ill-will between Polish and German nationalities and the irritation due to Polish intolerance towards the German inhabitants in the Corridor (now under their rule), far worse than any former German intolerance of the Poles, are growing to such an extent that it is impossible to believe the present settlement (borders) can have any chance of being permanent.... It can confidently be asserted that not even the most attractive economic advantages would induce any German to vote Polish. If the frontier is unsatisfactory now, it will be far more so when it has to be drawn on this side (of the river) with no natural line to follow, cutting off Germany from the river bank and within a mile or so of [[Marienwerder]], which is certain to vote German. I know of no similar frontier created by any treaty."&lt;ref name=Butler&gt;Butler, Rohan, MA., Bury, J.P.T., MA., &amp; Lambert M.E., MA., editors, Documents on British Foreign Policy 1919-1939, 1st Series, Her Majesty's Stationery Office, London, 1960, vol.x, Chapter VIII, "The Plebiscites in Allenstein and Marienwerder January 21 - September 29, 1920", p.726-7&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact on German through-traffic ==

The German Ministry for Transport established the ''[[Seedienst Ostpreußen]]'' ("Sea Service East Prussia") in 1922 to provide a ferry connection to [[East Prussia]], now a German exclave, so that it would be less dependent on transit through Polish territory.

Connections by train were also possible by "sealing" the carriages  (''[[Korridorzug]]''), i.e. passengers were not forced to apply for an official Polish [[visa (document)|visa]] in their passport; however, the rigorous inspections by the Polish authorities before and after the sealing were strongly feared by the passengers.&lt;ref&gt;An impression of the psychological consequences of the train sealing is given through the relevant paragraphs of the booklet ''Namen, die keiner mehr nennt'' ("Names, no longer called by anyone"), authored by the liberal German journalist [[Marion Dönhoff]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1925 a train, passing through the Corridor on its way to East Prussia, crashed because the spikes had been removed from the tracks for a short distance and the fishplates unbolted. 25 persons, including 12 women and 2 children, were killed, some 30 others were injured.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,728448,00.html time.com May 11, 1925]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Land reform of 1925 ==

According to Polish Historian Andrzej Chwalba, during the rule of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and the [[German Empire]] various means were used to increase the amount of land owned by Germans at the expense of the Polish population. In Prussia, the Polish nobility had its estates confiscated after the Partitions, and handed over to German nobility.&lt;ref name="historia2"&gt;Historia Polski 1795-1918. Andrzej Chwalba. Page 177&lt;/ref&gt; The same applied to Catholic monasteries.&lt;ref name="historia2"/&gt; Later, the German Empire bought up land in an attempt to prevent the restoration of a Polish majority in Polish inhabited areas in its eastern provinces.&lt;ref name="Chwalba"&gt;[[Andrzej Chwalba]] - Historia Polski 1795-1918 page 461-463&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Christian Raitz von Frentz]] notes that measures aimed at reversing past Germanization included the liquidation of farms settled by the German government during the war under the 1908 law.&lt;ref name="Frentz"/&gt;

In 1925 the Polish government enacted a land reform program with the aim of expropriating landowners.&lt;ref name=Blanke&gt;{{cite book |url=

Estates belonging to Germans must be taxed more heavily to encourage them voluntarily to turn over land for settlement. Border counties... particularly a strip of land ten kilometers wide, must be settled with Poles. German estates that lie here must be reduced without concern for their economic value or the views of their owners'.&lt;ref name=Blanke/&gt;

Prominent politicians and members of the German minority were the first to be included on the land reform list and to have their property expropriated.&lt;ref name=Blanke/&gt;

== Weimar German interests ==

The creation of the corridor aroused great resentment in Germany, and all post-war German [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]] governments refused to recognize the eastern borders agreed at Versailles, and refused to follow Germany's acknowledgment of its western borders in the [[Treaty of Locarno]] of 1925 with a similar declaration with respect to its eastern borders.&lt;ref name="Wolf"/&gt;

Institutions in Weimar Germany supported and encouraged German minority organizations in Poland, in part radicalized by the Polish policy towards them, in filing close to 10,000 complaints about violations of minority rights to the [[League of Nations]].&lt;ref name="Wolf"/&gt;

Poland in 1931 declared her commitment to peace, but pointed out that any attempt to revise its borders would mean war. Additionally, in conversation with U.S. President [[Herbert Hoover]], Polish delegate Filipowicz noted that any continued provocations by Germany could tempt the Polish side to invade, in order to settle the issue once and for all.&lt;ref&gt;Neal Pease, ''Poland, the United States, and the Stabilization of Europe, 1919-1933'', Oxford University Press US, 1986, p.146, {{ISBN|0-19-504050-3}}:.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nazi German and Polish diplomacy ==

The [[Nazi Party]], led by [[Adolf Hitler]], took power in Germany in 1933. Hitler at first ostentatiously pursued a policy of [[rapprochement]] with Poland,&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle A. Kallis, ''Fascist Ideology: Territory and Expansionism in Italy and Germany, 1922-1945'', Routledge, 2000, p.144, {{ISBN|0-415-21612-5}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=BeeRQHDOKXQC&amp;pg=PA114&amp;dq=hitler+rapprochment+poland&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a]&lt;/ref&gt; culminating in the ten-year [[Polish-German Non-Aggression Pact]] of 1934. In the years that followed, Germany placed an emphasis on rearmament, as did Poland and other European powers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://xroads.virginia.edu/~MA04/wood/mot/html/poland.htm Marching Toward War: Poland]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filebox.vt.edu/users/efalwell/sovietprop/stalin3.html |title=The Five Year Plans and Economic Distress... |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2009-10-10 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080501084617/http://filebox.vt.edu/users/efalwell/sovietprop/stalin3.html |archivedate = 2008-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the Nazis were able to achieve their immediate goals without provoking armed conflict: in 1938 [[Nazi Germany]] annexed [[Austria]] and the [[Sudetenland]] after the [[Munich Agreement]]. In October 1938, Germany tried to get Poland to join the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]]. Poland refused, as the alliance was rapidly becoming a sphere of influence of an increasingly powerful Germany.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bnprF2IvIMoC&amp;pg=PA170&amp;lpg=PA169&amp;printsec=8&amp;sig=svyLN1e6z1vqj0FJaRJfLjweSMU |title=The twentieth-century world: an ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2009-06-16 | first=William R. | last=Keylor | isbn=978-0-19-513681-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following negotiations with Hitler on the Munich Agreement, British Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] reported that, "He told me privately, and last night he repeated publicly, that after this [[Sudeten German]] question is settled, that is the end of Germany's territorial claims in Europe".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~pv/munich/czdoc09.html Document no. 9] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607043817/http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~pv/munich/czdoc09.html |date=2007-06-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost immediately following the agreement, however, Hitler reneged on it. The Nazis increased their requests for the incorporation of the Free City of Danzig into the Reich, citing the "protection" of the German majority as a motive.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/fyb/part_5c.html#188 The Polish Resistance and the German Press Campaign (August 1-19)]&lt;/ref&gt;
In November 1938, Danzig's district administrator, [[Albert Forster]], reported to the League of Nations that Hitler had told him Polish frontiers would be guaranteed if the Poles were "reasonable like the Czechs." German State Secretary [[Ernst von Weizsäcker]] reaffirmed this alleged guarantee in December 1938.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;[http://www.ku.edu/~eceurope/hist557/lect16.htm Anna M]&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation regarding the Free City and the Polish Corridor created a number of headaches for German and Polish Customs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/fyb/part_5c.html#188 |title=The Polish Resistance and the German Press Campaign (August 1–19) |publisher=Ibiblio.org |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Germans requested the construction of an [[extra-territorial]] ''[[Reichsautobahn]]'' freeway (to complete the ''Reichsautobahn [[Berlinka|Berlin-Königsberg]]'') and railway through the Polish Corridor, effectively annexing Polish territory and connecting East Prussia to Danzig and Germany proper, while cutting off Poland from the sea and its main trade route. If Poland agreed, in return they would extend the non-aggression pact for 25 years.&lt;ref name="Fest, pp.575-577"/&gt;

This seemed to conflict with Hitler's plans{{clarify|date=April 2014}} and with Poland's rejection of the Anti-Comintern Pact, and his desire either to isolate or to gain support against the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="Fest, pp.575-577"&gt;[[Joachim C.

Some felt that the Danzig question was inextricably tied to the problems in the Polish Corridor and any settlement regarding Danzig would be one step towards the eventual loss of Poland's access to the sea.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; Hitler's credibility outside Germany was very low after the occupation of Czechoslovakia, though some British and French politicians approved of a peaceful revision of the corridor's borders.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hJGpAT7IWhwC&amp;pg=PA480&amp;dq=polish+corridor&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;as_brr=1 John V.

In these circumstances, the new settlement proposed by Germany, which would link the questions of Danzig and of the passage across the Corridor with counterbalancing questions of a political nature, would only serve to aggravate this mortgage and practically subordinate Poland to the Axis and the Anti-Comintern Bloc. Warsaw refused this in order to retain its independence."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/wwii/yellow/ylbk113.htm Avalon Project : The French Yellow Book : No. 113 - M.

Hitler used the issue of the status city as pretext for attacking Poland, while explaining during a high level meeting of German military officials in May 1939 that his real goal is obtaining ''[[Lebensraum]]'' for Germany, isolating Poles from their Allies in the West and afterwards attacking Poland, thus avoiding the repeat of the Czech situation.&lt;ref&gt;''The history of the German resistance, 1933-1945'' Peter Hoffmann page 37 McGill-Queen's University Press 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Hitler'' Joachim C.

== Ultimatum of 1939 ==

A revised and less favorable proposal came in the form of an [[ultimatum]] delivered by the Nazis in late August, after the orders had already been given to attack Poland on September 1, 1939. Nevertheless, at midnight on August 29, [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] handed British Ambassador Sir [[Neville Henderson]] a list of terms that would allegedly ensure peace in regard to Poland. Danzig was to return to Germany and there was to be a plebiscite in the Polish Corridor; Poles who had been born or had settled there since 1919 would have no vote, while all Germans born but not living there would. An exchange of minority populations between the two countries was proposed. If Poland accepted these terms, Germany would agree to the British offer of an international guarantee, which would include the Soviet Union. A Polish [[plenipotentiary]], with full powers, was to arrive in Berlin and accept these terms by noon the next day. The British Cabinet viewed the terms as "reasonable," except the demand for a Polish Plenipotentiary, which was seen as similar to Czechoslovak President [[Emil Hácha]] accepting Hitler's terms in mid-March 1939.

When Ambassador [[Józef Lipski]] went to see Ribbentrop on August 30, he was presented with Hitler’s demands. However, he did not have the full power to sign and Ribbentrop ended the meeting. News was then broadcast that Poland had rejected Germany's offer.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt;

== Nazi German invasion – end of the corridor ==

On September 1, 1939, [[Invasion of Poland|Germany invaded Poland]]. German forces defeated the Polish [[Army Pomorze]] tasked with the defense of this region and captured the corridor during the [[Battle of Tuchola Forest]] by September 5. Other notable battles took place at [[battle of Westerplatte|Westerplatte]], the [[Defense of the Polish Post Office in Danzig|Polish post office in Danzig]], [[battle of Oksywie|Oksywie]], and [[Battle of Hel|Hel]].

== Ethnic composition ==

Most of the area was inhabited by [[Poles]], [[Germans]], and [[Kashubians]]. The census of 1910 showed that there were 528,000 Poles (including West Slavic Kashubians) compared to 385,000 Germans in the region.&lt;ref name="international608"/&gt; The census included German soldiers stationed in the area as well as public officials sent to administer the area.
Since 1886, a [[Prussian Settlement Commission|Settlement Commission]] was set up by [[Prussia]] to enforce German settlement&lt;ref&gt;Andrzej Chwalba - Historia Polski 1795-1918 page 461&lt;/ref&gt; while at the same time Poles, Jews and Germans migrated west during the [[Ostflucht]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dziedzictwo.polska.pl/katalog/skarb,Pokwitowanie_dotyczace_zakupu_wozu_mieszkalnego_dla_Michala_Drzymaly_z_1908_roku,gid,197554,cid,2443.htm?body=desc |title=Pokwitowanie dotyczące zakupu wozu mieszkalnego dla Michała Drzymały z 1908 roku - Katalog Skarbów - Skarby Dziedzictwa Narodowego - Polska.pl |publisher=Dziedzictwo.polska.pl |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090609135325/http://dziedzictwo.polska.pl/katalog/skarb,Pokwitowanie_dotyczace_zakupu_wozu_mieszkalnego_dla_Michala_Drzymaly_z_1908_roku,gid,197554,cid,2443.htm?body=desc |archivedate=2009-06-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1921 the proportion of Germans in Pomerania (where the Corridor was located) was 18.8% (175,771). Over the next decade, the German population decreased by another 70,000 to a share of 9.6%.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;&lt;/small&gt; There was also a [[Jew]]ish minority. in 1905, Kashubians numbered about 72,500.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Büsch, Ilja Mieck, Wolfgang Neugebauer, Handbuch der preussischen Geschichte, p.42&lt;/ref&gt;
After the occupation by Nazi Germany, a census was made by the German authorities in December 1939. 71% of people declared themselves as Poles, 188,000 people declared Kashubian as their language, 100,000 of those declared themselves Polish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kki.net.pl/~museum/rozdz2,6.htm |title=Strona w trakcie tworzenia |publisher=Kki.net.pl |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122132637/http://kki.net.pl/~museum/rozdz2,6.htm |archivedate=January 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The former corridor area after World War II==
{{Further|History of Pomerania}}
[[File:Oder-neisse.gif|thumb|300px|The Oder–Neisse line]]
At the 1945 [[Potsdam Conference]] following the German defeat in [[World War II]], Poland's borders were reorganized at the insistence of the Soviet Union, which occupied the entire area. Territories east of the [[Oder-Neisse line]], including Danzig, were put under Polish administration. The [[Potsdam Conference]] did not debate about the future of the territories that were part of western Poland before the war, including the corridor. It automatically became part of the reborn state in 1945.

German residents were expelled to the [[Soviet occupation zone]], which later became [[East Germany]].

== The corridor in literature ==
In ''[[The Shape of Things to Come]]'', published in 1933, [[H. G. Wells]] predicted the Corridor as the starting point of a future [[Second World War]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13358">In the military, a '''political commissar''' or '''political officer''' (or '''''politruk''''', a portmanteau from {{lang-ru|'''полит'''ический '''рук'''оводитель}}, "political leader", "political official"), is a supervisory [[officer (armed forces)|officer]] responsible for the political education ([[ideology]]) and organization of the unit they are assigned to, and intended to ensure [[civilian control of the military]].

The function first appeared as ''commissaire politique'' (political commissioner) in the [[French Revolutionary Army]] during the [[French Revolution|Revolution]] (1789–99).&lt;ref&gt;R. Dupuy, ''Nouvelle histoire de la France contemporaine: La République jacobine'' (2005) p.156&lt;/ref&gt; It also existed, with interruptions, in the Soviet [[Red Army]] from 1918 to 1942, as well as in the armed forces of [[Nazi Germany]] from 1943 to 1945. The function remains in use in China's [[People's Liberation Army]].

==Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc==
[[File:RIAN archive 543 A battalion commander.jpg|thumb|[[propaganda|Heroic image]] of a Soviet political commissar of the 220th Infantry Regiment calling soldiers to an assault, [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], Ukraine, 12 July 1942.]]
[[File:Brezhnev 1942.jpg|thumb|right|Brigade commissar [[Leonid Brezhnev]] (right) giving a [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] membership card to a soldier (1942)]]

The political commissar is often associated with the [[Soviet Union]] (1922–91), where the [[Cheka]] introduced them{{dubious|date=August 2018}} to the military forces to ensure the government’s political control. The chief reason was because the newly created Red revolutionary military units were associated with different, often conflicting political parties, and there were so many [[leftist]] political parties and movements at that time, whose doctrines paralleled closely to that of the [[bolsheviks]], and all of them had party members and sympathizers among the military, and tried to use that to their own benefit ([[Left SRs]] were among the hard-nosed competitors, who were popular among the lower ranks no less than bolsheviks, contesting them quite frequently) which was a matter of life and death during the ongoing [[Russian civil war|civil war]] against the [[White movement]]. To avoid disorder and [[unity of command|unify the command]], gaining a permanent control over the entire military, the bolsheviks introduced the comissarship. After the SRs were left behind the issue, the forces loyal to them split off from the [[Red Army]] to create the [[Green armies]], guerrilla war errupted soon at a countryside along with the civil war. The commissars' task was to prevent the warfighters, both commanding officers and troops, from tending towards the rivalrious political authorities. There were many examples of defiance and outspoken disobedience, when the troops killed or banished their commissars and switched sides, going Green. After the bolsheviks eliminated all their rivals and became the one and only political entity in the country, creating a [[One-party state|one-party dictatorship]], the commissarship remained rather a relic.

An early kind of political commissars arose already during the [[February Revolution]] 1917 as the [[Ispolkom]] issued the controversial [[Petrograd Soviet Order No. 1|Order no 1]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Pipes, The Russian Revolution, Swedish {{ISBN|91-27-09935-0}}, pp 106-108&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[Bolsheviks]] came to power through the [[October Revolution]] 1917, and as the [[Russian Civil War]] began, [[Trotsky]] who then gradually established the [[Red Army]], imposed the formal political officers. These were almost invariably tasked to make sure the [[Communist Party]] of the respective country could count on the loyalty of the Army. Although there was a huge difference between the February Revolution and the October Revolution, their leaders both feared a counter-revolution, and both regarded the military officers as the most likely counter-revolutionary threat.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Pipes, The Russian Revolution, Swedish {{ISBN|91-27-09935-0}}, p.120&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Deutscher,"Stalin",2nd edition, 1961, Swedish {{ISBN|91-550-2469-6}}, pp.168-169&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Red Army and the [[Soviet Army]], the ''political '''commissar''''' (''{{lang-ru|комиссар; komissar}}'') existed, by name, only during the 1918–24, 1937–40, and 1941–42 periods; not every Red Army political officer was a commissar. The political commissar held military rank equaling that of the unit commander to whom he was attached; moreover, the commissar also had the military authority to countermand the unit commander’s orders when required. In the periods of the Red Army's history when political officers were militarily subordinate to unit commanders, the position of political commissar did not exist.

The political supervision of the Russian military was effected by the political commissar, who was introduced to every unit and formation, from [[Company (military unit)|company]]- to [[Division (military)|division]]-level, including the navy. [[Revolutionary Military Council]]s (or Revvoyensoviets- RVS) were established at [[Army (unit)|army]]-, [[front (Soviet Army)|front]]-, [[naval fleet|fleet]]-, and [[flotilla]]-level, comprising at least three members—commander and two political workers. The political workers were denominated "members of the RVS", not "commissars", despite being official political commissars.

In 1919, the title ''politruk'' ({{lang-ru|политрук, from политический руководитель, political leader}}) was assigned to political officers at [[Company (military unit)|company]] level. Despite being official political commissars, they were not addressed as "commissar". Beginning in 1925, the politico-military doctrinal course towards ''edinonachalie'' ({{lang-ru|единоначалие}}, single command) was established, and the political commissar, as a military institution, was gradually abolished. The introduction of ''edinonachalie'' was twofold, either the military commander joined the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] and became his unit’s political officer, or a ''pompolit'' ({{lang-ru|помполит}}, assistant commander for political work) officer was commissioned sub-ordinate to him. Earlier, in 1924, the RVSs were renamed as Military Councils, such high-level political officers were known as ChVS (''Chlen Voennogo Soveta'', Member of the Military Council), they were abolished in 1934.

On 10 May 1937 the political commissar was reinstated to the Red Army, and Military Councils were created. These events derived from the political [[purge]]s that began in the Soviet armed forces. Again, in August 1940, the political commissars was abolished, yet the Military Councils continued throughout the [[German-Soviet War]] (1941–45), and afterwards. Below [[Army (unit)|army]] level, the ''edinonachalie'' (single command) system was restored. In July 1941, consequent to the Red Army’s defeats at war’s start, the position of political commissar reappeared. The commissar had an influential role as a "second commander" within the military units during this time. Their ranks and insignia generally paralleled those of officers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://forums.armchairgeneral.com/forum/world-history-group-hosting/rkka-the-russian-army-in-world-war-ii/8217-commissar-ranks Commissar Ranks?]&lt;/ref&gt; When this proved less-than-effective, [[Ivan Konev|General Konev]] asked Stalin to subordinate the political officer to commanding officers: the commissars' work was refocused to morale-related functions. The term "commissar" itself was formally abolished in August 1942, and at the company- and regiment-level, the ''pompolit'' officer was replaced with the ''zampolit'' (deputy for political matters). Though no longer known by the original "commissar" title, political officers were retained by all the [[Soviet Armed Forces]], e.g., [[Soviet Army|Army]], [[Soviet Navy|Navy]], [[Soviet Air Force|Air Force]], [[Strategic Missile Troops]], ''et al'', until the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991.

===Eastern Bloc armies===
After World War II, other [[Eastern Bloc]] armies also used political officers patterned on the Soviet model. For example, [[East Germany]]'s ''[[National People's Army|Nationale Volksarmee]]'' used ''Politoffiziere'' as the unit commander's deputy responsible for political education.

===Red Army rank designations===
*''Armeysky komissar 1-go ranga'' (comparable to NATO [[OF-9]]a; en: Commissar of the army 1st rank)
*''Armeysky komissar 2-go ranga'' (OF-9b; Commissar of the army 2nd rank)

==Nazi Germany==
From December 1943 until the defeat of [[Nazi Germany]], the German armed forces created a network of political instructors to maintain [[Nazism|National Socialist]] indoctrination of the ''[[Wehrmacht]]''. The officers, called ''Nationalsozialistische Führungsoffiziere'' (NSFO; "National Socialist Leadership Officers"), drawn from convinced officers and selected by [[Martin Bormann]], Head of the [[Nazi Party Chancellery]], to instill ideological conviction and reinforce combat morale through training lessons and teaching. They had no direct influence on combat decisions as had the political commissar in the Soviet Army. At the end of 1944 more than 1,100 full-time and about 47,000 part-time instructors had been trained, under the control of General [[Hermann Reinecke]], commander of the National Socialist leadership staff at the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|OKW]].

==China==
The position of political commissar (''zhengwei'', {{zh|{{Linktext|政治|委员|lang=zh}}, {{Linktext|政委|lang=zh}}}}) also exists in the [[People's Liberation Army]] of [[China]]. Usually, the political commissar is a uniformed military officer, although this position has been used to give civilian party officials some experience with the military. The political commissar was head of a [[Covert cell|party cell]] within the military; however, military membership in the party has been restricted to the lower ranks since the 1980s. Today the political commissar is largely responsible for administrative tasks such as public relations and counseling, and mainly serves as second-in-command.

The position of political commissar ({{zh|{{Linktext|政|戰|官|lang=zh}}}}) also exists in the [[Republic of China Army]] of the [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan). [[Chiang Ching-kuo]], appointed as [[Kuomintang]] (Chinese Nationalist Party) director of Secret Police in 1950, was educated in the Soviet Union, and initiated Soviet style military organization in the Republic of China Military, reorganizing and Sovietizing the political officer corps, surveillance, and Kuomintang party activities were propagated throughout the military.

{{Politics of the European Union}}This is a list of '''referendums related to the European Union''', or [[referendum]]s related to the [[European Communities]], which were predecessors of the [[European Union]]. Since 1972, a total of 48 referendums have been held by [[Member states of the European Union|EU member states]], candidate states, and their territories, with several additional referendums held in countries outside of the EU. The referendums have been held most commonly on the subject of whether to become a member of [[European Union]] as part of the accession process, although the EU does not require any candidate country to hold a referendum to approve membership or as part of [[treaty ratification]].  Other EU-related referendums have been held on the adoption of the [[euro]] and on participation in other EU-related policies.

The [[United Kingdom]] is the only EU member state to have held referendums on continued membership of the European Union and its antecedent organisation, the [[European Communities]]. In the [[United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum, 1975|first referendum in 1975]], continued membership of what was then the [[European Communities]] (which included the [[European Economic Community]], often referred to as the ''Common Market'' in the UK){{refn|group=nb|The 1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum question was as follows: "''Do you think the United Kingdom should stay in the European Community (the Common Market)?''"}} was approved by 67.2% of voters, while in its [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|second referendum in 2016]] voters voted by 51.9% to leave the European Union.{{refn|group=nb|The 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum question was as follows: "''Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?''"}}

[[Greenland]], an autonomous territory of Denmark, voted to leave the EC in a [[Greenlandic European Economic Community membership referendum, 1982|referendum in 1982]] by 53% of voters.

'''Robert Singleton''', also known as Bob Singleton (born 1936), is a civil rights activist. He and his wife [[Helen Singleton]] are known for being part of the [[Freedom Riders|Freedom Rides]] together in [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]], [[Mississippi]]. He currently teaches economics at [[Loyola Marymount University|Loyola Marymount Universit&lt;nowiki/&gt;y]], where he has been for over twenty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Singleton|first1=Robert|title=Robert Singleton, Ph.D.|url=http://www.crmvet.org/vet/singleto.htm|publisher=Robert Singleton|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and education==
Robert was born and raised in Philadelphia. He joined the army and served in Europe. When he came back from war, he went to school at the University of California, Los Angeles. This is where studied economics and also went for his undergraduate. In 1964, he received his Ph.D. and then went on to teach at UCLA for a few years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Singleton|first1=Robert|title=Robert Singleton, Ph.D.|url=http://www.crmvet.org/vet/singleto.htm|publisher=Robert Singleton|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert began his activism at UCLA when he ran for president of their chapter for the NAACP. During his time on campus, he became inspired by the speakers that came and spoke, including James Farmer, Malcolm X, James Baldwin, and Langston Hughes, each of whom helped him realize the injustices in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Singleton|first1=Robert|title=Robert Singleton, Ph.D.|url=http://www.crmvet.org/vet/singleto.htm|publisher=Robert Singleton|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He first joined the sit-ins, where he met other activists and helped them organize events where they would find food and clothing, get sharecroppers to vote, and organize the freedom rider to Jackson, Mississippi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Singleton|first1=Robert|title=Robert Singleton, Ph.D.|url=http://www.crmvet.org/vet/singleto.htm|publisher=Robert Singleton|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he returned, the NAACP had been kicked out of the school, so it was replaced with a CORE group, of which he was chair.

==Freedom Rides==
Robert Singleton and his wife are most known for the Freedom Rides that they took part of in Jackson, Mississippi. The south ignored the ruling that the U.S Supreme Court made about public transportation not being segregated because segregation was unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adams|first1=Philip|title=American Freedom Riders|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/latenightlive/1961-freedom-riders/6140448|publisher=ABC|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, they protested against segregation on public transportation. On July 30, 1961, when they got to Mississippi, Robert, his wife, and the other riders were arrested and sent to Parchmen Penitentiary. The conditions in the prison were harsh. They were put in maximum security, separated from each other, and placed next to the gas chambers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adams|first1=Philip|title=American Freedom Riders|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/latenightlive/1961-freedom-riders/6140448|publisher=ABC|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Three months after the freedom rides they were to desegregate public transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greene|first1=Eric|title=UCLA to honor alumni who fought segregation as Freedom Riders|url=http://newsroom.ucla.edu/stories/ucla-to-honor-alumni-who-fought-segregation-as-freedom-riders|publisher=UCLA Newsroom|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert and Helen Singleton were among the few married couples who participated in the Freedom Rides.

The '''South Africa Act 1909''' was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[British Parliament]] which created the [[Union of South Africa]] from the British colonies of the [[Cape Colony|Cape of Good Hope]], [[Colony of Natal|Natal]], [[Orange River Colony]], and [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]].&lt;ref&gt;South Africa Act, 1909, 9 Edward VII, Chapter 9. It can be found at wikisource.org/wiki/South_Africa_Act_1909.&lt;/ref&gt; The Act also made provisions for admitting [[Southern Rhodesia|Rhodesia]] as a fifth province of the Union in the future, but Rhodesian colonists rejected this option in a [[Southern Rhodesian government referendum, 1922|referendum]] held in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;See section 150 of South Africa Act.&lt;/ref&gt; The South Africa Act was the third major piece of legislation passed by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] with the intent of uniting various British colonies and granting them some degree of autonomy. Earlier, the [[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act, 1867]] had united three colonies (Canada – which became [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]] – [[Nova Scotia]], and [[New Brunswick]]) and the [[Constitution of Australia|Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act, 1900]] had united the Australian colonies.

==Historical background==
''Main article: [[National Convention (South Africa)]]''

In the aftermath of the [[Anglo-Boer War]] (1899–1902), Britain re-annexed the [[South African Republic]] and the [[Orange Free State]], two hitherto independent [[Boer]] republics. These new territories, renamed the Transvaal Colony and the Orange River Colony respectively, were added to Britain's existing South African territories, the Cape Colony and Colony of Natal. It was British government policy to encourage these four colonies to come together in closer union; after the grant of responsible government to the Transvaal Colony and Orange River Colony in 1907, this aspiration was one that was also increasingly held by the [[Afrikaner]] population.

These political forces resulted in the 1908 National Convention, which met on 12 October 1908 and completed its work on 11 May 1909. This Convention settled on the terms and constitution of a governmental, legislative, and economic Union. These proposals were transmitted to the British government, which duly prepared a Bill to give effect to these wishes. The Bill was passed by Parliament on 20 September 1909 and on 20 September 1909 King [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom]] proclaimed that the Union of South Africa would be established on 31 May 1910. This Act, which essentially brought into being the South African state as it is known today, served as the South African constitution for over fifty years, during which time the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] greatly increased South Africa's independence from Britain. Although South Africa became a republic in 1961 and left the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], the basic structure of the 1909 Act continued to live on in its replacement, the [[Republic of South Africa Constitution Act (32 of 1961)]]. However, the last vestiges of the 1909 Act finally disappeared in 1983 when the apartheid-era government enacted a new constitution, the [[Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Act (110 of 1983)]].

==Government structure==
[[File:Map of the provinces of South Africa 1910-1976 with English labels.svg|thumb|The provinces of the Union]]
The structure of the government of the [[Union of South Africa]] was similar to the government of other British [[Dominion]]s. A [[Governor-General of South Africa]] was appointed to represent the [[British Monarch]], who was also the [[Monarchy of South Africa|Monarch of South Africa]]. Executive power was vested in the Monarch/Governor-General and was exercised on the advice of the Executive Council.&lt;ref&gt;See Part III of South Africa Act of 1909&lt;/ref&gt; Though not explicitly provided for by the South Africa Act, the office of [[Prime Minister of South Africa]] was quickly established as the [[head of government]] and, like other government ministers, the Prime Minister was required to be a Member of either House of Parliament.  As in other British Dominions, the Governor-General appointed the leader of the largest political party in the [[lower house]] of Parliament as Prime Minister. Prime Ministers were also sworn in as Executive Councilors if they were not already members of the Executive Council. 

Legislative power was vested in a [[Parliament of South Africa|Parliament]] consisting of the Monarch, a [[Senate of South Africa|Senate]], and a [[House of Assembly of South Africa|House of Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;See section 19 of South Africa Act.&lt;/ref&gt; For most of the Union's existence, the South Africa Act provided for each Province to have equal representation in the upper house, the Senate, and Senators were chosen by an electoral college made up of the Province's members in the House of Assembly and the members of the provincial legislature. The composition and election of the Senate would later be modified as part of the move towards [[apartheid]] and the establishment of the [[South African republic referendum, 1960|Republic of South Africa]]. In the lower house of Parliament, the House of Assembly, each Province was represented proportionally according to their respective populations and members were elected from individual districts within a Province. The House of Assembly had more power than the Senate, much like the relationship between the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and [[House of Lords]]. In the case of a disagreement between the Senate and House of Assembly, the Governor-General could convene a joint sitting of the two houses to review the legislation, make amendments, and vote on the bill.&lt;ref&gt;See section 63 of South Africa Act.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the House of Assembly was much larger than the Senate, the system was designed to protect the stronger position of the House in any joint sitting.  A similar method of resolving disagreements exists in the [[Parliament of Australia|Australian Parliament]] and the [[Parliament of India|Indian Parliament]], but the [[Australian Senate]] and the [[Rajya Sabha]] are each half the size of the [[Australian House of Representatives]] and the [[Lok Sabha]], respectively, whereas the South African Senate was only one-third the size of the South African House of Assembly.  Unlike the Australian model (but like the Indian one), no [[double dissolution]] election occurred before a joint sitting, further strengthening the position of the House of Assembly and the Prime Minister over the Senate. 

The Act also established a [[Supreme Court of South Africa]], which served as a unified court system for the Union and consisted of local, provincial, and appellate divisions. The old supreme courts of the provinces became the provincial divisions of the new Supreme Court of South Africa. The appellate division, which was the highest court in the land, was seated at [[Bloemfontein]].&lt;ref&gt;See Part VI of South Africa Act, 1909.&lt;/ref&gt; There was a further appeal to the Privy Council, particularly in Admiralty cases.&lt;ref&gt;See section 106 of South Africa Act, 1909&lt;/ref&gt; The power [[judicial review]] of Parliamentary legislation and administrative acts was the same as in the United Kingdom. In addition, the Supreme Court could review Parliamentary amendments of the entrenched clauses of the South Africa Act of 1909.

Each province was governed by an Administrator, appointed by the central government, and had a legislature in the form of a [[unicameral]] [[provincial council (South Africa)|Provincial Council]]; four members of the Council joined with the Administrator to form a five-member executive committee that acted as the Province's Cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;See Part V, sections 68 to 94 of South Africa Act, 1090.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Canada and Australia, which became dominions through the federation of British colonies, the South Africa Act created a centralised, [[unitary state]]. Each of the [[Provinces of South Africa|four provinces]] became subordinate entities and had far fewer powers than the [[Canadian provinces]] or [[Australian states]]. As such, the government of South Africa was quite similar—from a constitutional standpoint—to the government of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]].

==The Cape Qualified Franchise==
{{main|Cape Qualified Franchise}}
The [[Cape Colony]] had long adhered to a system of non-racial franchise, whereby qualifications for suffrage were applied equally to all males, regardless of race. During the union negotiations, the last Cape Prime Minister, [[John X. Merriman]], and [[Sir Walter Stanford]], representing the Transkei and other African communities, fought unsuccessfully to have this multi-racial franchise system extended to the rest of South Africa. Their attempt failed in the face of opposition from the white governments of the other constituent states, which were determined to entrench white rule.&lt;ref&gt;P.M. Laurence: ''The life of John Xavier Merriman'', Richard R. Smith Inc, 1930.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. Lewsen (ed.): ''Selections from the Correspondence of J.X. Merriman''. Cape Town: Van Riebeek Soc. 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;

The South Africa Act permitted the [[Cape Province]] to keep a restricted version of its traditional franchise, whereby qualifications limited the suffrage of all citizens according to education and wealth. This led to the Cape being the only province in South Africa where [[coloured]]s (mixed-race people) and Black Africans could vote. The act also permitted the Parliament of South Africa to prescribe all other voting qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eisa.org.za/WEP/souoverview5.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604151051/http://www.eisa.org.za///WEP/souoverview5.htm |archivedate=4 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/wtpapers/south_africa/chapter2.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060517050030/http://www.cato.org/pubs/wtpapers/south_africa/chapter2.pdf |archivedate=17 May 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, according to the Act, Parliament was given the power to change the Cape's voting requirements by a two-thirds vote. Over the following years, [[Apartheid legislation in South Africa|legislation]] was passed by Parliament to slowly erode this colour-blind voters roll.

In 1931, the remaining franchise qualifications, except for the age limit of 21, were removed for white voters, but kept in place for Black and "[[Coloured]]" voters (including the demand that voters be male).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eisa.org.za/WEP/soubg2.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509080718/http://www.eisa.org.za/WEP/soubg2.htm |archivedate=9 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956, the [[Apartheid in South Africa|Apartheid government]] removed all remaining suffrage rights for "non-whites"&lt;ref&gt;Christoph Marx: ''Oxwagon Sentinel: Radical Afrikaner Nationalism and the History of the Ossewabrandwag''. LIT Verlag Münster, 2009. p.61.&lt;/ref&gt; in what became known as the [[Coloured vote constitutional crisis]].

Overall the Act did little to protect black Africans during the time period in which the South Africa Act was the constitution of South Africa, and ultimately enabled the establishing of fifty years of [[Apartheid in South Africa|apartheid]] and [[racial discrimination]].

==Other provisions==
The Act established English and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] as the [[official language]]s of South Africa, with equal status under the law, and required all government documents and Parliamentary proceedings to be published in both languages.&lt;ref&gt;See section 137 of South Africa Act, 1909.&lt;/ref&gt; In modern times, English remains one of the [[Languages of South Africa|official languages of the Republic of South Africa]]. Dutch was extended to include [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] by the [[Official Languages of the Union Act, 1925]], and replaced by Afrikaans in the [[South African Constitution of 1961|Constitution of 1961]].

'''Spatial reconnaissance''', or "space reconnaissance", is the [[reconnaissance]] of any celestial bodies in space by use of spacecraft and [[satellite photography]].  NASA personnel utilizes space reconnaissance to scout other planets, military uses space reconnaissance by using spy satellites onto the Earth's surface.  Space reconnaissance assets provide access to all parts of the globe and use a variety of sensors to collect information responsive to virtually every intelligence need.  They also constitute an integral part of the U.S. military force structure, providing critical information with sufficient accuracy and timeliness to support the maneuver of military forces and the targeting of their weapons.

Space reconnaissance is also very expensive. Although procured in limited numbers, the large satellite systems developed by the United States and the ground stations needed to operate them require expenditures in the range of several billions of dollars per year.  Their substantial cost puts great pressure on the Intelligence Community to search for alternatives, find efficiencies, and continuously scrutinize the intelligence requirements these systems address.

In [[Wiltshire]], [[United Kingdom|UK]], 2003, a pilot scheme for what is now known as "Talking CCTV" was put into action; allowing operators of CCTV cameras to order offenders to stop what they were doing, ranging from ordering subjects to pick up their rubbish and put it in a bin to ordering groups of vandals to disperse. In 2005 Ray Mallon, the mayor and former senior police officer of [[Middlesbrough]] implemented "Talking CCTV" in his area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/tees/5353538.stm BBC news story on talking CCTV in Wilshire]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Reid, Baron Reid of Cardowan|John Reid]], Home Secretary, claimed, "The new funding for Talking CCTV is aimed at the small minority who think it is acceptable to litter our streets, vandalise our communities and damage our properties", as he gave grants of £500,000 to 21 areas for the implementation of the "Talking CCTV" camera; [[Southwark]], [[Barking and Dagenham]], [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], [[Thanet District|Thanet]], [[Harlow]], [[Norwich]], [[Ipswich]], [[Plymouth]], [[Gloucester]], [[Derby]], [[Northampton]], [[Mansfield]], [[Nottingham]], [[Coventry]], [[Sandwell]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Wirral|Wirral]], [[Blackpool]], [[City of Salford|Salford]], [[Middlesbrough]], [[South Tyneside]] and [[Darlington]].

'''''The Captain'''''  is a 1967 novel by Dutch writer [[Jan de Hartog]].
It is a sequel of a sort to his 1940 book ''[[Captain Jan]]'', though not having the same characters as the earlier book.

==Plot summary==
The [[frame story]] has Martinus Harinxma, a senior tugboat captain home after a long voyage, catching up on correspondence.  He opens a letter from a young man who is the son of a Canadian naval officer killed aboard Harinxma's ship during escort duty during [[Second World War]].  In the letter, the son asks the Captain, "How was my father killed, and what was he really like?"  As he begins to write the boy, Harinxma is forced to remember, and re-live the events surrounding the Canadian officer's time aboard his ship, and his eventual death.

In 1940 Harinxma, then a young tugboat officer, escapes to Britain. The Kwel company has managed to get away much of its fleet and personnel, one jump ahead of the advancing Germans, and sets up to continue operations from London. Harinxma gets his first command, at an earlier age and under much more difficult conditions than he would otherwise have had. 

A central element of the book are the complex relationships between the crew  members, in whose depiction de Hartog's personal nautical experience is manifest. Among other things the young and inexperienced captain must face the dilemma of whether to cover up for a severe mishap by the ship's engineer, who is his personal friend, or report him for the sake of the ship's safety and risk his getting fired.  

While still being merchant seamen not formally inducted into any navy,  Harinxma and his fellow Dutch exile sailors are inexorably sucked into the fighting, their ships given (often inadequate) armaments and sent into some of the hottest arenas of the World War II naval war. Again clearly based on De Hartog's own experience, the book vividly conveys the feeling of suspicion and cordial dislike between the exiled Dutch and their British hosts and allies.

The Dutch sailors feel (and not entirely without reason) that they are being set up as cannon fodder (or rather, [[U-Boat]] fodder). Many of Harinxma's fellow Dutch end up on the "South-Western Approaches" to the British Isles, acting as "stretcher-bearers of the sea" in submarine-infested waters - which turns out to be a task involving an extremely high casualty rate. (That experience had formed the background to a previous (1951) de Hartog novel, published variously under the names ''Stella'' and ''The Key'' and made into a film starring [[Sophia Loren]]). 

Harinxma himself eventually ends up in an even more horrendous environment: the convoys to [[Murmansk]], carrying the military [[matériel]] which the [[Soviet Union]] desperately needed to repulse the Nazi invasion of its territory. Wending their long way in frigid Arctic waters, the convoys were for most of their course extremely vulnerable to constant German submarine, warship and aerial attacks emanating from occupied [[Norway]], making them among the war's most dangerous postings.  

The same background, with the combination of extreme belligerent action and inhospitable nature pushing protagonists to the edge of endurance and beyond, was already the scene of ''[[HMS Ulysses (novel)|HMS Ulysses]]'', the first novel (1946) by Scottish author [[Alistair MacLean]]. While the two books have very different writing styles, characterization and undelying philosophy, they do share some plot elements. 

Harinxma and his crew go again and again into that hell, with only short rest periods before they have to go there yet again. While under this constant danger, Harinxma gets into a personality conflict with a diminutive and touchy [[Royal Navy]] captain hailing from the [[Isle of Man]], who first appears arrogant and ridiculous but ultimately sacrifices himself and goes to the bottom in a touching and heroic - yet believable - way.  

In what would turn out to have a profound influence on his later life, Harinxma works with a sensitive young [[Royal Canadian Navy|Canadian]] liaison officer posted to his ship, who quixotically dies in a futile attempt to shield an injured kitten from an attacking German plane. Later, Harinxma has a brief and guilt-ridden affair with the Canadian's widow. 

Things come to a head in a particularly disastrous convoy of which few of the participating ships survive to reach their destination. (Both De Hartog's book and MacLean's seem to be inspired by - though not be following in every detail - the case of the historical ill-fated [[Convoy PQ-17]] of July 1942). 

Harinxma loses his ship, and very nearly his life, but purely by chance a [[depth charge]] falling from the ship sinks a German U-Boat as well. He pulls from the oily water and into the [[lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboat]] a German boy who was a cook's mate on the submarine and is its only survivor (and who would become a prosperous businessman in post-war Germany and send each year a big box of cakes to his Dutch saviour).  

Sick and tired of war, Harinxma returns to London and confronts the formidable aging patriarch of the Kwel Company. He declares his firm decision to become a [[conscientious objector]] and quit the sea - and gets told "God has sown you on the bridge of a tugboat, and there you will grow". 

Eventually, a deep-seated feeling of loyalty to all the Dutch and British who sailed with him and went to the bottom impels Harinxma to indeed take up again command of a ship - but a completely unarmed one, where he would be exposed to the full risk of German attacks but not be in a position to kill anybody even inadvertently.  

This message reflects the position of de Hartog himself, who became more and more of a [[pacifist]] towards the end of the war years and eventually joined the outspokenly pacifist [[Quakers]]. What saves the book from becoming an ideological tract is the wry sense of humour evident even in manifestly non-humorous situations, and the first-person narrator's ability to laugh at himself.  

Harinxma returned in several later de Hartog books, such as ''The Commodore'' and ''The Centurion''.

[[File:Daniel Defoe 1706.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Daniel Defoe]], author of ''The Shortest Way'']]
'''''The Shortest-Way with the Dissenters; Or, Proposals for the Establishment of the Church''''' is a [[pamphlet]] by [[Daniel Defoe]], first published in 1702. Defoe was prompted to write the pamphlet by the increased hostility towards [[English Dissenters|Dissenters]] in the wake of the accession of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] to the throne.

It is written in the same style as the [[Tory]] publications that attacked Dissenters, and was assumed by some people to be a genuine vindication of their view. The pamphlet raised embarrassing questions about the handling of the issue by the Tory ministry, and led to Defoe's arrest for [[seditious libel]]. His imprisonment, during which he fell into bankruptcy, was to have a lasting influence on his subsequent writings. In the years after his release, Defoe published several pamphlets that attempted to explain its purpose and his own views.

==Background==
In 1702, King [[William III of England|William III]] died, and [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] succeeded to the thrones of England, Scotland and Ireland. She was markedly less tolerant than William of the device known as "occasional conformity", whereby [[English Dissenters|Dissenters]] could qualify as members of the [[Church of England]]—and thereby hold public office—by attending a church service once a year. Defoe was supportive of religious freedom, though he was critical of the device and considered it hypocrisy. He had written against it in a pamphlet entitled ''An enquiry into occasional conformity: Shewing that the dissenters are no way concern'd in it'' (1698)&lt;ref name=liten&gt;{{cite web|last=Pritchard|first=Penny|title=Daniel Defoe: The Shortest Way with Dissenters|url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/sworks.php?rec=true&amp;UID=7730|publisher=The Literary Encyclopedia|accessdate=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year, hostility towards Dissenters increased. A [[Bill (law)|Bill]] against occasional conformity was passed through the House of Commons and debated in the Lords.&lt;ref name="act1702"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=37664|title=The first parliament of Queen Anne: First session – Act preventing occasional conformity – begins 20/10/1702|publisher=Institute of Historical Research|year=1742|work=The History and Proceedings of the House of Commons: volume 3: 1695–1706|accessdate=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Figures such as [[Henry Sacheverell]], a [[High church]] clergyman, warned against Dissenters assuming positions of political power. His lead was followed by the [[Tory]] press, who published a number of sermons and pamphlets making similar arguments.&lt;ref name="Horsley 1976, p. 407."&gt;Horsley 1976, p. 407.&lt;/ref&gt; In December, Defoe published his own pamphlet, ''The Shortest Way'', assuming the same stylistic conventions as the Sacheverell and the Tory publications.&lt;ref name="liten" /&gt;

==Synopsis==
[[File:Battle of Naseby.jpg|right|thumb|The English Civil War (''[[Battle of Naseby]] pictured'') is one of the events the Dissenters are accused of being culpable in.]]
''The Shortest Way with the Dissenters; or, Proposals for the Establishment of the Church'' is a pamphlet consisting of twenty-nine pages. It opens with the fable of the Cock and the Horses. The Cock, lacking any perch in the stable, is forced to rest on the ground and in fear of the Horses moving around and stepping on him, advises: “Pray, Gentlefolks! let us stand still! for fear we should tread upon one another!” The speaker then applies this to the contemporary situation, with the Cock representing the Dissenters.

The next section accuses the Dissenters of involvement with various notorious and hideous events of the past century, including the [[English Civil War]] and [[Monmouth's Rebellion]]. The accusations become increasingly sinister, and at points the speaker directly addresses the Dissenters ("You have butchered one King! deposed another King! and made a Mock King of a third!"). A brief history is given of how past monarchs—from [[James VI and I|James I]] to William III—have treated the Dissenters; in the opinion of the speaker, it is too leniently.

The major section comprises a series of arguments for why the Dissenters should be treated favourably ("They are very numerous", "That this is a time of war"). The speaker denounces each in turn and offers several counter-arguments, each gradually escalating in their severity. A vision is given of what will happen to the Church of England if it is not defended against the Dissenters. The pamphlet ends with a rallying call to action against the Dissenters in defence of the church ("Now let us Crutcifie the Thieves.")

==Genre and style==
''The Shortest Way'' has traditionally been classified as a satire, although this has been disputed by scholars. Miriam Laurenbaum has suggested that it is instead a form of [[hoax]] or "banter",&lt;ref name="Leranbaum 1974, p. 227"&gt;Leranbaum 1974, p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; and that Defoe does not use many of the features necessary for it to be considered a true satire. Paul Alkon describes the critical tradition surrounding the work as "asking mainly whether it is inadequate irony, deficient satire, or misused impersonation."&lt;ref name="Alkon 1976, S12."&gt;Alkon 1976, S12.&lt;/ref&gt; Ashley Marshall suggests that "''The Shortest-Way'' is best understood not as insufficiently ironic but as a counterfeit, an intentional fake not meant to be decoded."&lt;ref name="Marshall, pp. 235–6."&gt;Marshall, pp. 235–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The difficulty for Defoe's contemporaries in assessing whether the work was ironic was the proximity of the speaker's voice to that of the High Anglicans whose views are being ridiculed.&lt;ref name="Marshall 2009, p. 234."&gt;Marshall 2009, p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt; The pamphlet mixes both real observation and fabrication, and assumes the rhetorical style of his target.&lt;ref name="Horsley, pp. 410–11."&gt;Horsley, pp. 410–11.&lt;/ref&gt; Defoe uses and imitates the language and metaphor of fanatical churchman, particularly Sacheverell's sermons; the speaker's comparison of the Dissenters to vipers is one that Sacheverell often made.&lt;ref name="Leranbaum 1974, pp. 238–240."&gt;Leranbaum 1974, pp. 238–240.&lt;/ref&gt; Although ''The Shortest Way'' does not parody the genre of the Anglican sermon, it does deploy some of the same structures; the initial Aesopic fable of the Cock and the Horses is expanded upon in a way that parallels the use of a biblical quotation to initiate a sermon.&lt;ref name="Alkon 1976, S15."&gt;Alkon 1976, S15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and legacy==
[[File:RobertHarleyInColour.jpg|left|thumb|Robert Harley, leader of the Tory ministry and suspected of having obtained Defoe's release from prison]]
Upon its publication, ''The Shortest Way'' provoked immediate and passionate reactions from both sides of the debate. Some made use of it as a genuine vindication of the anti-Dissenter opinion, although speculation later occurred over whether it was ironic.&lt;ref name="liten" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Horsley 1976, p. 408."&gt;Horsley 1976, p. 408.&lt;/ref&gt; The pamphlet generated a great deal of publicity over the handling of the issue by the Tory ministry. This resulted in the issuing of a warrant by the High Tory [[Secretary of State for the Southern Department]], the [[Daniel Finch, 2nd Earl of Nottingham|Earl of Nottingham]], for the arrest of Defoe on the charge of [[seditious libel]], the order being given to "… make Strict and diligent Search for Daniel Fooe and him having found you are to apprehend and seize together with his Papers for high Crime and misdemeanours and to bring him before me …"&lt;ref name="Horsley 1976, p. 408."&gt;Horsley 1976, p. 408.&lt;/ref&gt;

Defoe was finally imprisoned on [[21 May]] 1703, after avoiding his summons and evading capture. He was fined, made to stand in the [[pillory]] on three occasions and remained in prison till November; in the meantime, his business affairs sank into ruin. The whole affair left a lasting impression on him, which can be felt in his writings.&lt;ref name="liten" /&gt; In the years following his arrest and release, Defoe made several attempts to explain ''The Shortest Way'' and his own viewpoint. Amongst the series of explanatory pamphlets doing this are ''An Explanation of a Late Pamphlet, Entituled, The Shortest Way…'' (1703) and ''A Dialogue Between a Dissenter and the Observator'' (1703).&lt;ref name="liten" /&gt; The suspected involvement of the Tory Speaker of the House, [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Robert Harley]], in obtaining the release of Defoe is credited as the beginning of their professional relationship, in which Defoe worked as a propagandist for Harley, after he succeeded Nottingham as Secretary of State in 1704.&lt;ref name="liten" /&gt;

Modern scholarly reception has considered ''The Shortest Way'' in negative terms, as a failed satire, or as using irony so slight as to be undetectable.&lt;ref name="Marshall 2009, pp. 234–5."&gt;Marshall 2009, pp. 234–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a conclusion cites the contemporary reaction to the work, how it failed to deliver its objectives and also caused its author such problems. If critics have offered praise, it is the extent to which Defoe managed to impersonate the style of his subjects, so as to be indistinguishable from them.&lt;ref name="Alkon 1976, p. S12."&gt;Alkon 1976, p. S12.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Shortest Way'' is frequently contrasted with another work of irony in the eighteenth century, which is considered to have succeeded in its use of the device, [[Jonathan Swift]]'s ''[[A Modest Proposal]]'' (1729).&lt;ref name="Marshall 2009, p. 235."&gt;Marshall 2009, p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Waterwise Project''' is an independent not-for-profit, non-governmental organisation promoting [[water conservation|water efficiency and conservation]] based in [[London]], UK.

The organisation is focused on decreasing water consumption in the UK by 2010 and on building a robust evidence base for large-scale water efficiency projects.  Waterwise is the UK’s water “efficiency champion” – “reaching the parts others cannot reach, and transform[ing] the concept of water resource efficiency into something compelling for consumers and business users.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.water.org.uk/home/policy/source/source-2006/source-final.pdf Walter Menzies, Chief Executive, Mersey Basin Campaign]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding and aims==
Waterwise was established due to concerns of waters shortage and the upward trend in how much water is consumed in the UK. Factors that were taken into account were: current drought situation, geographical and climatological circumstances, consumer tendencies, available resources, and future prospects of supply. The following examples, situations, and comparisons were contemplated:

*England has less rainfall than some North African countries.
*Southern England has experienced one of the driest winters and spring periods since 1904
*Low river flows and groundwater levels across Southern England have resulted in environmental problems
*Groundwater levels are falling and this is particularly so in the chalk aquifers which are very important to Southern England.
*There have been demographic and social changes: modern lifestyles result in a greater demand for water. There has also been an increase in smaller size households that use proportionally more water.
*Climate and global warming, as predicted by the UKCIP, is forecast to result in a deficit in soil moisture. This means that agriculture will compete with the water industry for increasingly scarce resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/WaterUK.pdf WaterUK report to Select Committee of Parliament] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516214615/http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/WaterUK.pdf |date=2006-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, all 26 UK water companies decided to establish an independent organisation which would promote water efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.water.org.uk/home/news/press-releases/waterwise-launch Water UK]&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2006, The Waterwise Project was launched to build an evidence base and economic case for water efficiency in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmhansrd.htm House of Commons, Early Day Motion, Water Efficiency, 26 October 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;  In England, the organisation sits on the Environment Minister’s Water Saving Group, alongside the water industry and regulators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defra.gov.uk/Environment/water/conserve/wsg/index.htm Water Saving Group, Department of Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060213224001/http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/water/conserve/wsg/index.htm |date=2006-02-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;[4] It was established with the stance that the key to water efficiency is reducing waste, not restricting use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forester.net/we_news_011907_wwise.html Water Efficiency Journal]&lt;/ref&gt;

Waterwise has an independent Board, which is drawn from the government, regulators, academia, business, other organisations, and from the water industry.  The board meets four times a year and is responsible for overseeing Waterwise’s activities and its strategic direction.

Waterwise's initial remit ran until September 2010. It has been renewed for an additional five years. Its aim is to decrease per capita consumption in the UK, and to build a strong social, political, and economic case for water efficiency.

==Audience and partners==
{{cquote|Waterwise is effectively a facilitator: its job is to enable, to promote dialogue, to establish a common evidence base and to develop partnerships and share ideas.  Waterwise is keen to work with anyone who shares their aim and would welcome everyone’s help.|20px|20px|Maria Adebowale, Board Chair of Waterwise, Founder Director of Capacity Global}}

Waterwise works with all sectors of society to promote water efficiency and the wise use of water.  To achieve their aims they work with key partners in water companies, governments (local, regional, and national), regulators, farmers, communities, businesses, civil society organisations, manufacturers, retailers, press and media, and individual consumers.

==Activities and events==
Waterwise participates in and leads various projects and events in order to complete their objectives:

*Waterwise hosts the only annual Water Efficiency Conference in the UK. The conference brings together policymakers, doers, and thinkers to learns about and further discuss issues related to water efficiency.
*Waterwise runs the Waterwise Recommended Checkmark. The Checkmark replaces the Marque, which was founded in October 2006 and first awarded in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketingweek.co.uk/cgi-bin/item.cgi?id=29916&amp;d=254&amp;h=0&amp;f=0 Marketing Week, 'Water Marque' scheme aims to aid product marketing]&lt;/ref&gt; The Waterwise Recommended Checkmark provides consumers with an ‘at-a-glance’ indicator of a product’s water saving potential.  It aims to empower consumers to make water wise purchases.

[[Image:Waterwise Checkmark.jpeg|thumb|right|150px|The Waterwise Recommended Checkmark helps consumers make water wise buying choices]]

*Waterwise works closely with Government departments and regulators in developing policy to further water efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defra.gov.uk/Environment/water/resources/research/index.htm A report to Defra Reviewing International Models of External Water Use Restrictions, as one example of Waterwise's policy work] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030422105211/http://www.defra.gov.uk/Environment/water/resources/research/index.htm |date=2003-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Waterwise teams with UK water companies, universities, local governments, and builders to conduct large-scale water efficiency projects, workshops, and programmes.  These projects range from water audits to domestic retrofit schemes to university lectures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conted.ox.ac.uk/cpd/env/courses/social.asp Using Water Wisely: How to Change Consumer Behaviour, University of Oxford]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Waterwise convenes The Saving Water in Scotland network which brings together key figures in Scotland to discuss and advance water efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waterbriefing.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=489&amp;Itemid=51 Saving Water in Scotland network draw up action plan to guard against future water shortages, waterbriefing.org]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Waterwise also provides households, businesses, media, and the government with information on water in the UK and with assistance on water saving.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diyweek.net/news/news.asp?id=10392&amp;title=B%26Q+and+Waterwise+team+up+to+save+water Water/B&amp;Q Water Efficiency Campaign, an example of teaming up with business]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Waterwise has ranked all current UK models of [[dishwasher]]s and [[washing machine]]s according to water efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Environmentandgreenerliving/Energyandwatersaving/DG_064370 DirectGov Greener Living] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070422214218/http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Environmentandgreenerliving/Energyandwatersaving/DG_064370 |date=2007-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are working on rankings for [[shower]]s, [[toilet]]s, and [[Tap (valve)|tap]]s.
*Waterwise also conducts research related to international water ecolabels, embedded water, water and [[climate change]], and other various other research projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crikey.com.au/Politics/20070320-The-Water-Diet.html The Crikey Water Diet, based on Waterwise research on embedded water] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926224622/http://www.crikey.com.au/Politics/20070320-The-Water-Diet.html |date=2007-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Waterwise is part of the Blueprint for Water coalition which has laid out a ten step plan for [[sustainable]] water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blueprintforwater.org.uk/ The Blueprint for Water]&lt;/ref&gt; The coalition is composed of Waterwise, The [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]] (RSPB), [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF-UK), Salmon and Trout Association, The Wildlife Trusts, The National Trust, Association of Rivers Trust, Anglers’ Conservation Association, Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust, and The Fisheries and Angling Conservation Trust
*In 2017 Waterwise launched the Water Efficiency Strategy for the UK. Through setting out focused recommendations and actions, this strategy is providing a framework via which Waterwise and the wide Water Industry can drive even more ambitious water efficiency action and ensure future work is focused on key areas.

The phrase '''"The only poll that counts..."''' is used by [[politician]]s to dismiss the importance of [[opinion polls]] and highlight the importance of [[polling day]]. It is particularly used as a response to questions about negative opinion poll results and is generally considered [[tongue-in-cheek]] or ironic. It is particularly well known as a feature of [[Australian politics]] where its inclusion in party-political briefings and instructions has caused controversy. The generally accepted continuation of the phrase is, ''"...is the one on election day"''.

==Context==

In his book ''Polling and the Public: What Every Citizen Should Know'', [[Herb Asher]] provides a general explanation of the context in which the phrase is used. He suggests that the phrase has its origins in attempts by poorly performing politicians to discredit polling as an accurate reflection of their performance.&lt;ref name=asher&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KTPZymyY--wC&amp; ''Polling and the Public: What Every Citizen Should Know''] by [[Herb Asher]] (SAGE, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase, he suggests, questions the accuracy of polling by drawing attention to historical, inaccurate polling.&lt;ref name=asher/&gt;

Though popular in Australia, the phrase has also occasionally been used in the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]] in general the same context, with [[The Guardian]]'s [[Jonathan Freedland]] describing the phrase as an "oldie but goldie".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/16/poll-bad-news-labour-ed-miliband ''This poll is bad news for Labour, however you spin it''] by [[Jonathan Freedland]] ([[The Guardian]], 16 July 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Helen Geracimos Chapin credits long-term [[Mayor of Honolulu]], [[Frank Fasi]], in particular, with use of the phrase.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=D-QPLqwlr7cC&amp; ''Shaping History: The Role of Newspapers in Hawai'i''] by Helen Geracimos Chapin ([[University of Hawaii Press]], 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Gerald Ford]] and [[Jimmy Carter]] used the phrase with regard to opinion polls - in 1976, [[Tom Brokaw]] asked Ford a question in which he suggested the President used the phrase "often"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BRCTaYzoDlcC&amp; ''Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States''] - [[Gerald Ford]] ([[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]], 1979)&lt;/ref&gt; and Carter used the phrase in response to a question at a 1980 press conference.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=T3mqobvfZecC&amp; ''Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States''] - [[Jimmy Carter]] ([[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]], 1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent use==

In 2013, [[Australian Labor Party]] MP [[Joel Fitzgibbon]], knowing he would be asked about opinion poll results revealed in the press earlier that morning, provided the following response to journalists' questions:&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.ninemsn.com.au/national/2013/06/04/00/19/abbott-stretches-his-lead-over-gillard ''Labor MP mocks own party after poll setback''] ([[Ninemsn]], 4 June 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|I brought the manual with me. I'll see what it says. It says I should say polls come and go and the only poll that counts is the poll on election day.}}

In doing so, he exposed the fact that party leaders and advisors had specifically added the phrase to briefing notes for Members of Parliament. The comment came in the midst of an internal campaign (in which Fitzgibbon played a leading role) to highlight the tenuous position of the then-[[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Julia Gillard]] because of her opinion poll results.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/australia/10102831/Government-MPs-pack-up-their-offices-as-polls-count-Gillard-out-100-days-before-Australian-election.html ''Government MPs pack up their offices as polls count Gillard out 100 days before Australian election''] by Ilya Gridneff ([[The Daily Telegraph]], 6 June 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Gillard was [[Australian Labor Party leadership spill, June 2013|deposed as Prime Minister]] later that month.

TEA promotes the use of thorium using a different rationale.

Present generation nuclear reactors are all [[uranium]] based, [[Nuclear fuel cycle|fueled]] with either freshly [[Uranium mining|mined uranium]] or recycled [[plutonium]] and uranium as the [[Nuclear fission|fissile]] material. There are concerns about a [[Peak uranium|continued supply of uranium]], due to resource depletion, as well as various obstacles to mining uranium deposits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Dikshit | first = Sandeep | title = Revive R&amp;D in thorium, says India | publisher = The Hindu | date = 9 March 2010 | url = http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article221360.ece | accessdate = 9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the currently widely deployed nuclear reactors harness less than 3% of the energy content of uranium fuel. This technology, in turn, leaves large quantities of [[radioactive waste]]s to be disposed of safely. The issue of disposal of these wastes has not been addressed convincingly anywhere in the world. Moreover, a vast majority of the present generation reactors are based on the original design of reactors meant to power [[submarines]], and whose [[Nuclear safety|safety]] is ensured by several active features and standard operating practices. Under various circumstances, these features and procedures were seen to [[Nuclear and radiation accidents|fail]], bringing about catastrophic consequences. Highly enriched uranium and separated plutonium are also the feedstock for [[nuclear weapons]].

Thorium has been proposed as a clean, safe, proliferation resistant and [[sustainable]] source of energy which additionally is free from most of the issues associated with uranium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hargraves | first = Robert | authorlink = |author2=Moir, Ralph  | title = Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactors | journal = American Scientist | volume = 98 | pages = 304–313 | date = July–August 2010 | url = http://www.thoriumenergyalliance.com/downloads/American_Scientist_Hargraves.pdf | accessdate = 9 January 2013 | doi=10.1511/2010.85.304}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Sorensen | first = Kirk | title = Thinking Nuclear?

| accessdate = 9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|crustal abundance]] of thorium is four times more than that of uranium. Thorium is invariably associated with [[rare-earth element]]s or rare metals like [[niobium]], [[tantalum]] and [[zirconium]]. Hence, it can be recovered as a by-product of other mining activities. Already, large quantities of thorium recovered from rare-earth element operations have been stockpiled in many countries. Thorium is [[fertile material]], and essentially all thorium can be used in a nuclear reactor. Thorium is not fissile in itself, absorbs a neutron to transmute into [[uranium-233]], which can fission to produce energy. Therefore, a thorium based fuel cycle produces very little, easily manageable waste compared to uranium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Thompson | first = John | title = Could the Clean Energy We Need Be Right Under Our Feet? | publisher = GQ Magazine | date = 22 February 2010

However [[nuclear proliferation]] using thorium has proven to be extremely difficult and non-practical, although proof-of-concepts of the contrary also have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Ashley Stephen F. | author2 = Parks | author3 = Geoffrey T. | author4 = Nuttall | author5 = William J. | author6 = Boxall | author7 = Colin &amp; Grimes | author8 = Robin W. | title = Nuclear energy: Thorium fuel has risks | journal = Nature | issue = 492 | pages = 31–33 | date = 6 December 2012 | doi = 10.1038/492031a |bibcode = 2012Natur.492...31A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of thorium claim that the advantages are overstated and it is unlikely to be a useful source of energy. Experts point the adverse economics and the availability of plentiful sources of energy that will deter full commercialization of thorium based energy.

==Advocacy for thorium==
One of the stated objectives of TEA is the vigorous advocacy for use of thorium as a nuclear fuel. TEA through its activities reaches out to scientists, engineers, government official, policymakers, and lawmakers to sensitize about the advantages of using thorium as a fuel. TEA has conducted a number of publicity campaigns and [[social media]] based outreach activities. TEA has emphasized the research and development done in the USA during the 1950s to 1970s period on thorium based reactor designs and fuel cycle options. Of particular interest was the [[Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment]] (MSRE) carried out at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]], the United States during 1964-1969.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite web | title = Concepts &amp; Prototypes: Two Next-Gen Nukes | publisher = Popular Science | first = Kalee | last = Thompson | accessdate = 2013-01-09 | date= 2011-06-27

TEA argues the importance of enabling thorium energy, especially in [[liquid fluoride thorium reactor]] (LFTR pronounced lifter), in public hearings, such as the [[Blue-ribbon panel|Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people = Kutsch, John | title = TEA Resources | publisher = Thorium Energy Alliance | location = Washington, D.C. | date = 8 September 2010 | url = http://www.thoriumenergyalliance.com/ThoriumSite/resources.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; TEA promotes the establishment of a working thorium powered reactor. TEA is particularly interested in restarting the homogeneous fuels research program and the commercialization of [[molten salt reactor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Niiler | first = Eric | title = Nuclear power entrepreneurs push thorium as a fuel | publisher = The Washington Post | date = 29 February 2012 | url =https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-02-20/national/35444493_1_hydrogen-explosion-nuclear-power-reactor | accessdate = 17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the supply chain infrastructure to support it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Martin | first = Richard | title = Uranium Is So Last Century — Enter Thorium, the New Green Nuke | publisher = Wired Magazine | date = 21 December 2009 | url = https://www.wired.com/magazine/2009/12/ff_new_nukes/all/ | accessdate = 9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another aim of TEA is supporting the reemergence of a Western Rare Earths Infrastructure by bringing together rare-earth producers leading to the establishment of a consortium for refining rare earths and sequestering thorium for future use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Christopher S. | last = Bond | title = Brazil and U.S. Initiative on Rare Earths | year = 2010 | pages = | place = Washington D.C.
| url = http://www.thoriumenergyalliance.com/downloads/BondLtr_to_BrazilAmb_RareEarth.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; TEA supports changes in existing thorium regulation in the USA to promote safe production and stockpiling of thorium as a by-product of associated mineral industries activity.

==Activities==
TEA proposes to leverage education and training activities by:
*creating educational resources and textbooks
*providing scholarships
*facilitation of expert speakers
*producing museum exhibits presenting thorium based energy

TEA plans to engage politicians through round-table discussions and provide them with expert opinion, [[white paper]]s, executive summaries and talking points to demonstrate thorium technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Alex | last = Cannara | title = Grand Challenges | year = 2010
| url = http://www.thoriumenergyalliance.com/downloads/Alex_Cannara_example_letter.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a major initiative to engage the public through regular and social media channels. TEA facilitates experts to appear on [[radio]] and [[television]] and participate in group discussions and provide interviews. In this direction TEA generates a large quantity of its own media including, [[webcasts]], [[podcasts]], videos, [[pamphlets]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Thorium Energy Alliance| title = Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactor Fact Sheet | url = http://www.thoriumenergyalliance.com/downloads/Thor-Facts_pdf.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; books and articles.TEA sponsors advertising campaigns in print, television and targeted mail.

In the future, TEA plans to track the milestones in the creation of a thorium economy. One of the proposed methods will be to create a thorium and related technology stock portfolio and a Thorium [[Exchange-traded fund|ETF]], which will allow the public to track and participate in the growing value of the thorium economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Thorium Energy Alliance| title = Objectives, Needs, and Next Steps for a Thorium Alliance | url = http://www.thoriumenergyalliance.com/ThoriumSite/objectives.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Annual Conferences==
TEA organizes regular annual conferences since 2009, where scientific sessions and cross-cutting energy and fuel management discussions bring together a cross-section of interested domain experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Jacoby | first = Mitch | title = Reintroducing Thorium | journal = Chemical &amp; Engineering News | publisher = American Chemical Society | date = 16 November 2009 | url = http://pubs.acs.org/cen/science/87/8746sci2.html | issn = 0009-2347 | accessdate = 9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inaugural conference in 2009 took place in [[Washington D.C.]], followed by [[California]] (2010), Washington D.C. (2011), and [[Chicago]] (2012). The 2013 annual conference was held in Chicago, May 30–31.  The most recent conference was held in Palo Alto, CA, June 3–4, 2015.

The 2017 annual conference will be held in St. Louis, 21–22 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thoriumenergyalliance.com/index.html|title=T.E.A. - Conference 8|last=Thorium Energy Alliance|website=thoriumenergyalliance.com|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26862">The following is a timeline of the '''[[Gwangmu Reform]]''', which was a reforms for modernize Korea from the late 19th century to the early 20th century. Although many people have the notion that this period was marked with the fight for power between Heungseon Daewongun (흥선대원군, 興宣大院君 - King Gojong's father) and Queen Min (King Gojong's wife), it was rather the era of great changes relevant to modernisation after the harsh oppressive years during the "Regency" of King Gojong's father. This reform also was one of the most successful for [[modernization|modernising]] in a short period of time during Korean history. Although the reform was mostly centred on the time period after the proclamation of the Korean Empire, it includes a number of other previous events that are closely related to the reform.

==Early modernizations (1883–94)==
Phase one of the [[Gwangmu Reform]] began with the first Korean delegation to America, and opening up for modernisation. Because of recurring Chinese interventions led by [[Li Hongzhang]] (이홍장,李鴻章), there was relatively less development of Chosun compared to Phase Three. The main innovator in this phase is [[Queen Min]].

*1883: March. The Korea-Japanese Underground Cable Construction Treaty (조일해저전선부설조약,朝日海底電線敷設條約) was signed by Korea and Japan. This led to a telegraphic connection between [[Busan]] (부산,釜山) and [[Nagasaki]] (長崎).
*1883: May. American minister [[Lucius Foote]] arrived to take command of the modernization of Chosun's older army units that had not started Westernizing. 
[[Image:Hanseong Sunbo 1883.jpg|thumb|120px|left|''[[Hanseong sunbo]]'', the first modern newspaper in Korea]]
*1883: July. The first delegate to America was sent by the Chosun government. The Ministry of Presswork and Publication (박문국,博文局)was opened for the modernisation of the printing industry.
*1883: August. The first edition of the [[Hanseong sunbo]] (한성순보,漢城旬報) was published on this year. This is the first newspaper to be published in Chosun. 
*1884: The Daedong Corporation (대동상회,大同商會), the first modern domestic corporation in Korea, was established.
*1885: February. The first Royal Medical Clinic, the '''[[Gwanghyewon]] (광혜연,廣惠院)''' was opened with the introduction of modern medicine by [[Horace Newton Allen]]. The name changed to Jaejoongwon (제중원,濟衆院) a month later.
*1885: May. [[Presbyterianism]] is introduced to Chosun by [[Horace Grant Underwood]]. Many other Christian pastors came to Chosun, which became the fundamental background for religious freedom and equality between Koreans.
*1885: July. The Korea-Chinese Cable Treaty (조청전선조약,朝淸電線條約) is signed and enforced, leading to a telegraphic connection between [[Hanseong]] and [[Peking]].
*1885: August. Establishment of the [[Pai Chai University|Baejae Hakdang]] (배재학당,培材學堂) by [[Henry Appenzeller]]. Although initially recognised as an 'Academy', it became a college in 1895.
*1886: February. Proclamation of abolishment of [[slavery]] inheritance within Chosun. This is the unofficial start of equalisation of people within the kingdom. It also paved the way for abolishment of slavery in the [[Gabo Reform]]. 
*1886: May. Queen Min gave her patronage to the first all-girls' educational institution, '''Ewha Academy (이화학당,梨花學堂) ''', established in Seoul by American missionary, [[Mary F. Scranton]]. This institution later became the [[Ewha University]] (이화여자대학교,梨花女子大學校). 
[[File:Manhwa-Yu.Gil-jun-Yahak-01.jpg|thumb|130px|right|A cartoon that shows a former [[Yangban]] and a commoner using the same speech level.]]
*1886: September. There also was the establishment of the Yukyeong-gongwon (육영공원,育英公院). This was the first [[state school|public school]] to be opened in Chosun. 
*1887: March. The Korean Imperial Telegraphic Office (조선전보총국,朝鮮電報總局) was opened for a more efficient management of the telegraphic lines operating in Korea. The office was in use until 1893, when it became into the Korean Imperial Telegraphic and Postal Office (전우총국,電郵總局).
*1887: October. American missionary Scranton establishes the first women's hospital, the Lillian Harris Memorial Hospital (보구여관,普救女館). The hospital also operated the first medical class for women. One of the students went to the Woman’s Medical College of Baltimore, becoming the first female doctor at Korea in 1900.
*1888: February. 1888, General [[William McEntyre Dye]] and two other military instructors arrived from the US, followed in May by a fourth instructor. The Americans taught at the first modern military academy called the '''Yeonmu-gongwon (연무공원,鍊武公院)''' and trained many Koreans.
*1888: May. Korea independently constructs the Southern Cable Line (남로전선,南路電線), connecting Hanseong and Busan.
*1890: January. The Korean Merchant's Association for Fairness is opened by Kim Jae-jun(김재전,金在田), Lee Gun-seo (이군서,李君瑞) and Park Myung-gyu(박명규朴明珪). The Association promoted usage of foreign weight and measurement standards in the domestic market. It had offices in Incheon, Wonsan and Busan. 
*1891: February. The Korean Northern Cable Treaty (조선북로전선조약,朝鮮北路電線條約) is signed by China and Korea. By this treaty, the telegraphic service from Seoul to [[Wonsan]] is in operation.
*1892: Issuance of the '''Baekdonghwa (백동화,白銅貨)''', with the enforcement of the New Currency Regulations (신식화폐조례,新式貨幣條例). Although it caused some chaos on which currency to use, it also stabilised the inflation within the peninsula.
*1893: March. The '''[[Korean Imperial Naval Academy]] (통제영학당,統制營學堂)''' is established. The academy produces approximately 160 officers before its close during and after the [[First Sino-Japanese War]].
*1894: February. The outbreak of the '''[[Donghak Peasant Revolution]] (동학농민운동,東學農民運動)'''. The communication between the [[Donghak]] faction and King Gojong were smooth until Japanese intervention- which led to the [[First Sino-Japanese War]].

==Japanese interventions (1894–97)==
[[File:Kim Hong-Jip.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Kim Hong-jip (1842–96), prime minister of the Gabo Government]]
This phase does not show much development within the Korean Peninsula. It is a brief period of intense power struggle between Japan and Russia, competing to expand their influence in the peninsula.

*1894:  June. The [[Gabo Reform]] (갑오개혁,甲午改革) is initiated by Prime Minister [[Kim Hong-jip]] (김홍집,金弘集), Park Jung-yang (박정양,朴定陽),Kim Yun-sik (김윤식,金允植), Cho Hei-yeon (조희연,趙羲淵), Kim Ga-jin (김가진,金嘉鎭), An Gyung-su (안경수,安駉壽), Kim Hak-wu (김학우,金鶴羽) and Yu Gil-jun (유길준,兪吉濬). The heteronomous reform ends in February the next year. It was an attempt of Japan by using Japanophile Korean officials to change Korea into a system more like Japan, for an easier administration of Korea after its annexation.
[[Image:Young Philip Jaisohn.jpg|thumb|110px|left|[[Seo Jae-pil]], the founder of the [[Independence Club]].]]
*1895:  8 October. [[Empress Myeongseong]] (명성황후,明成皇后) is assassinated by Japanese agents under [[Miura Gorō|Miura Goro]](三浦梧樓). Japan gets much criticism from other modern countries about such barbaric methods, and therefore arrests Miura as a matter of formality. After spending some time in Hiroshima prison, however, he is released due to the "lack of evidence".
*1896:  11 February. '''King Gojong fled to the Russian legation in Seoul (아관파천,俄館播遷)'''.
*1896:  2 July. Establishment of the [[Independence Club]] by [[Seo Jae-pil]] (서재필,徐載弼). It is to be noted that Seo took part in the [[Gapsin Coup]] (갑신정변,甲申政變) in 1884. Some people related to the coup d’État were Kim Ok-gyun (김옥균,金玉均) and Park Yung-hyo (박영효,朴泳孝).

==Later modernizations  (1897–1905)==
Phase two of the Gwangmu Reform began with the proclamation of the [[Korean Empire]] on 4 October 1897. Efforts for modernisation were spurred with the coronation of Gojong as Emperor but were restrained by Japan after the [[Russo-Japanese War]] in 1905. The main innovator in this phase is [[Gojong of the Korean Empire|Emperor Gojong]].

*1897:  February. King Gojong established the [[Board of Marshals|Board of Marshals (원수부,元帥府)]]. All military power was henceforth centralized to the Emperor.

[[File:Trip-wire pipe bomb.jpg|thumb|Simulated tripwire bomb]]
{{Wiktionary}}
A '''tripwire''' is a passive [[:wikt:trigger|trigger]]ing mechanism.  Typically, a wire or cord is attached to some device for detecting or reacting to physical movement.

Such tripwires may be attached to one or more [[Land mine|mines]] — especially fragmentation or [[bouncing mine]]s — in order to increase the area where triggering may occur.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}.  Trip wires are frequently used in [[boobytrap]]s -- where either a tug on the wire, or the release of tension on it, will trigger the explosives.

Soldiers sometimes detect the presence of tripwires by spraying the area with [[Silly String]].  It will settle to the ground in areas where there are no wires.  Where wires are present, the "strings" will rest on the taut wires without triggering the explosive, due to its light weight.  It was used by U.S. troops in Iraq for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1561143,00.html | title=Not So Silly String In Iraq | publisher=TIME.com | accessdate=2007-10-16 | date=2006-11-19 | first=Ellin | last=Martens}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CBS News October 16"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/12/06/iraq/main2234543.shtml | title=A Serious Use For Silly String | publisher=CBS News | accessdate=2007-10-16 | date=2006-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Raw Story October 16"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.rawstory.com/news/2006/FOX_VIDEO_Silly_String_saving_lives_1204.html | title=FOX VIDEO: 'Silly String' is saving lives over in Iraq | publisher=The Raw Story | accessdate=2007-10-16 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071012184140/http://rawstory.com/news/2006/FOX_VIDEO_Silly_String_saving_lives_1204.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another detection method is the use of green [[line laser]]s to illuminate and thus expose trip and command wires.  The bright laser beam reflects off of the tripwire and can be seen by the user.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5099">The '''Vohra (Committee) Report''' was submitted by the former [[Indian Union]] [[Home Secretary]], [[N.N. Vohra]], in October 1993. It studied the problem of the criminalisation of [[politics]] and of the nexus among criminals, [[politician]]s and [[bureaucrats]] in India.

The report contained several observations made by official agencies on the criminal network which was virtually running a parallel government. It also discussed criminal gangs who enjoyed the patronage of politicians, of all [[political parties|parties]], and the protection of government functionaries. It revealed that political leaders had become the leaders of gangs. They were connected to the military. Over the years criminals had been elected to local bodies, [[States and territories of India|State Assemblies]] and [[Indian Parliament|Parliament]]. The unpublished annexures to the Vohra Report were believed to contain highly explosive material.

In 1997, the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] recommended the appointment of a high level committee to ensure in-depth investigation into the findings of the N N Vohra Committee and to secure prosecution of those involved.

== Citations from the report (published parts) ==

"In the first meeting of the Committee (held on l5th July ‘93), I had explained to the Members that Government had established the Committee after seeing the reports of our Intelligence and Investigation agencies on the activities/linkages of the Dawood Ibrahim gang, consequent to the bomb blasts in Bombay in March 1993." (2.1, cf. [[1993 Bombay bombings]], [[Dawood Ibrahim]])

"In the bigger cities, the main source of income relates to real estate - forcibly occupying lands/buildings, procuring such properties at cheap rates by forcing out the existing occupants/tenants etc. Over time, the money power thus acquired is used for building up contacts with bureaucrats and politicians and expansion of activities with impunity. The '''money powe'''r is used to develop a '''network of muscle-power''' which is also '''used by the politicians during elections'''." (3.2)

"The '''nexus between the criminal gangs, police, bureaucracy and politicians''' has come out clearly in various parts of the country. The existing criminal justice system, which was essentially designed to deal with the individual offences/crimes, is unable to deal with the activities of the Mafia; the provisions of law in regard economic offences are weak (...)" (3.3)

"Director CBI has observed that there are many such cases, as that of [mafia boss Iqbal] MIRCHI where the initial failure has led to the emergence of Mafia giants who have become too big to be tackled." (3.4)

"Like the Director CBI, the DIB has also stated that there has been a rapid spread and growth of criminal gangs, armed senas, drug Mafias, smuggling gangs, drug peddlers and economic lobbies in the country which have, over the years, developed an extensive network of contacts with the bureaucrats/Government functionaries at the local levels, politicians, media persons and strategically located individuals in the non-State sector. Some of these Syndicates also have international linkages, including the foreign intelligence agencies." (6.2)

“The various crime Syndicates /[[Mafia Raj|Mafia]] organisations have developed significant muscle and money power and established linkages with governmental functionaries, political leaders and others to be able to operate with impunity” (10.1.ii)

“the various agencies presently in the field take care to essentially focus on their respective charter of duties, dealing with the infringement of laws relating to their organisations and consciously putting aside any information on linkages which they may come across” (11.1)

“In the background of the discussions so far, there does not appear to be need for any further debate on the '''vital importance of setting up a nodal point''' to which all existing intelligence and Enforcement agencies (irrespective of the Department under which they are located ) shall promptly pass on any information which they may come across, which relates to the activities of crime Syndicates” (13.1)
