[[Image:Random digits.png|right|thumb|Lines 10580–10594, columns 21–40, from ''A Million Random Digits with 100,000 Normal Deviates'']]
'''''A Million Random Digits with 100,000 Normal Deviates''''' is a [[random number book]] by the [[RAND Corporation]], originally published in 1955.  The book, consisting primarily of a [[random number table]], was an important 20th century work in the field of [[statistics]] and [[Statistical randomness|random numbers]]. It was produced starting in 1947 by an electronic simulation of a [[roulette wheel]] attached to a [[computer]], the results of which were then carefully filtered and tested before being used to generate the table. The RAND table was an important breakthrough in delivering random numbers, because such a large and carefully prepared table had never before been available. In addition to being available in book form, one could also order the digits on a series of [[punched card]]s.

The table is formatted as 400 pages, each containing 50 lines of 50 digits.  Columns and lines are grouped in fives, and the lines are numbered 00000 through 19999.  The [[standard normal deviate]]s are another 200 pages (10 per line, lines 0000 through 9999), with each deviate given to three decimal places. There are 28 additional pages of [[front matter]].

The main use of the tables was in statistics and the [[experimental design]] of [[scientific experiment]]s, especially those that used the [[Monte Carlo method]]; in [[cryptography]], they have also been used as ''[[nothing up my sleeve number]]s,'' for example in the design of the [[Khufu and Khafre#Khafre|Khafre cipher]]. The book was one of the last of a series of random number tables produced from the mid-1920s to the 1950s, after which the development of high-speed computers allowed faster operation through the generation of [[pseudorandom]] numbers rather than reading them from tables.

The book was reissued in 2001 ({{ISBN|0-8330-3047-7}}) with a new foreword by RAND Executive Vice President [[Michael D. Rich]]. It has generated many humorous user reviews on [[Amazon.com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/17/magazine/17FOB-Medium-t.html |first=Virginia| last=Heffernan| title=The Reviewing Stand| magazine=[[The New York Times Magazine]]| date=January 15, 2010 |accessdate=2011-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alfred Leon Foster''' (known as '''Alfred Foster''') was an American mathematician.&lt;ref name=BerkeleyObit&gt;[http://texts.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb238nb0fs&amp;doc.view=entire_text Alfred L. Foster, U. of California: In Memoriam, 1995]&lt;/ref&gt; He was a professor at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] from 1934 until 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Foster.html|title=Alfred Leon Foster|publisher=MacTutor|accessdate=28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932 he was an Invited Speaker at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians|ICM]] in Zürich.

In 1934 he accepted a regular position at [[University of California Berkeley|Berkeley]]. At that time [[Griffith Evans]] was Head of the Mathematics Department and was charged by President Sproul with building a first-class mathematics center, which he did. Alfred Foster and [[Charles Morrey]] (who became the first department chairman after Evans' retirement) were Evans' first two appointments. Except for subsequent sabbatical leaves, spent most notably in [[University of Freiburg|Freiburg]] and [[University of Tübingen|Tübingen]], Foster served continuously at Berkeley until his retirement at the then-mandatory age of 67 in 1971.

Foster's Ph.D. dissertation and his first few papers were in the area of [[mathematical logic]]. Starting from this point, he soon focused his interest on the related theory of [[Boolean algebras]] and [[Boolean rings]], and was thus led from logic to algebra. He extensively studied the role of [[duality (mathematics)|duality]] in Boolean theory and subsequently developed a theory of n-ality for certain rings which played for [[Many-valued logic|n-valued logics]] the role of Boolean rings vis-a-vis Boolean algebras. The late Benjamin Bernstein of the Berkeley mathematics faculty was his collaborator in some of this research. This work culminated in his seminal paper “The theory of Boolean-like rings” appearing in 1946.&lt;ref name=BerkeleyObit/&gt;

Foster was married to Else Wagner;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://paw.princeton.edu/memorials/57/63/index.xml|title=Alfred Leon Foster *31|date=25 October 1995|publisher=Princeton Alumni Weekly|accessdate=28 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203143150/https://paw.princeton.edu/memorials/57/63/index.xml|archive-date=2016-02-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; their marriage produced four children and eight grandchildren.&lt;ref name=BerkeleyObit/&gt;

In [[probability theory]], the '''birthday problem''' or '''birthday paradox''' concerns the [[probability]] that, in a set of {{mvar|n}} [[random]]ly chosen people, some pair of them will have the same [[birthday]]. By the [[pigeonhole principle]], the probability reaches 100% when the number of people reaches 367 (since there are only 366 possible birthdays, including [[February 29]]). However, 99.9% probability is reached with just 70 people, and 50% probability with 23 people. These conclusions are based on the assumption that each day of the year (excluding February 29) is equally probable for a birthday.

It may well seem surprising that a group of just 23 individuals is required to reach a probability of 50% that two individuals in the group have the the same birthday: this result is perhaps made more plausible by considering that the comparisons of birthday will actually be made between every possible pair of individuals = 23&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;22/2&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;253 comparisons, which is well over half the number of days in year (183 at most), as opposed to fixing on one individual and comparing their birthday to everyone else's birthday. 

Real-world applications for the birthday paradox include a cryptographic attack called the [[birthday attack]], which uses this probabilistic model to reduce the complexity of finding a [[Collision attack|collision]] for a [[hash function]].

The history of the problem is obscure. [[W. W. Rouse Ball]] indicated (without citation) that it was first discussed by [[Harold Davenport]].&lt;ref name="rouse_ball_1960"&gt;[[W. W. Rouse Ball]], 1960, ''Other Questions on Probability'', in "Mathematical Recreations and Essays", Macmillan, New York, p 45.&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Richard von Mises]] proposed an earlier version of what is considered today to be the birthday problem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teacherlink.org/content/math/interactive/probability/lessonplans/birthday/home.html The Birthday Problem]&lt;/ref&gt; The problem was featured by [[Martin Gardner]] in his April 1957 "[[List of Martin Gardner Mathematical Games columns|Mathematical Games]]" column in ''[[Scientific American]]''.

[[Image:Birthday Paradox.svg|thumb|300px|The computed probability of at least two people sharing a birthday versus the number of people]]

==Calculating the probability==
The problem is to compute an approximate probability that in a group of {{mvar|n}} people at least two have the same birthday. For simplicity, variations in the distribution, such as [[leap year]]s, [[twin]]s, seasonal or weekday variations are disregarded, and it is assumed that all 365 possible birthdays are equally likely. (Real-life birthday distributions are not uniform, since not all dates are equally likely, but these irregularities have little effect on the analysis.{{refn|group=nb|name="nonuniform birthdays"|In reality, birthdays are not evenly distributed throughout the year; there are more births per day in some seasons than in others, but for the purposes of this problem the distribution is treated as uniform. In particular, many children are born in the summer, especially the months of August and September (for the northern hemisphere) [http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/astronomy/LeapDay.html], and in the U.S. it has been noted that many children are conceived around the holidays of [[Christmas]] and [[New Year's Day]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Also, because hospitals rarely schedule [[caesarian section]]s and [[induced labor]] on the weekend, more Americans are born on Mondays and Tuesdays than on weekends;{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} where many of the people share a birth year (e.g. a class in a school), this creates a tendency toward particular dates. In Sweden 9.3% of the population is born in March and 7.3% in November when a uniform distribution would give 8.3% [http://www.scb.se/statistik/BE/BE0101/2006A01a/BE0101_2006A01a_SM_BE12SM0701.pdf Swedish statistics board].

These factors tend to increase the chance of identical birth dates, since a denser subset has more possible pairs (in the extreme case when everyone was born on three days, there would obviously be many identical birthdays). The problem of a non-uniform number of births occurring during each day of the year was first understood by [[Murray Klamkin]] in 1967. A formal proof that the probability of two matching birthdays is least for a uniform distribution of birthdays was given by Bloom {{Harv|Bloom|1973}}.}})

The goal is to compute {{math|''P''(''A'')}}, the probability that at least two people in the room have the same birthday. However, it is simpler to calculate {{math|''P''(''A''′)}}, the probability that no two people in the room have the same birthday. Then, because {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''A''′}} are the only two possibilities and are also [[mutually exclusive events|mutually exclusive]], {{math|''P''(''A'') {{=}} 1 − ''P''(''A''′).}}

In deference to widely published solutions concluding that 23 is the minimum number of people necessary to have a {{math|''P''(''A'')}} that is greater than 50%, the following calculation of {{math|''P''(''A'')}} will use 23 people as an example.  If one numbers the 23 people from 1 to 23, the [[event (probability theory)|event]] that all 23 people have different birthdays is the same as the event that person 2 does not have the same birthday as person 1, and that person 3 does not have the same birthday as either person 1 or person 2, and so on, and finally that person 23 does not have the same birthday as any of persons 1 through 22.  Let these events respectively be called "Event 2", "Event 3", and so on.  One may also add an "Event 1", corresponding to the event of person 1 having a birthday, which occurs with probability 1. This conjunction of events may be computed using [[conditional probability]]: the probability of Event 2 is 364/365, as person 2 may have any birthday other than the birthday of person 1.  Similarly, the probability of Event 3 given that Event 2 occurred is 363/365, as person 3 may have any of the birthdays not already taken by persons 1 and 2.  This continues until finally the probability of Event 23 given that all preceding events occurred is 343/365.  Finally, the principle of conditional probability implies that {{math|''P''(''A''′)}} is equal to the product of these individual probabilities:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;P(A')=\frac{365}{365}\times\frac{364}{365}\times\frac{363}{365}\times\frac{362}{365}\times\cdots\times\frac{343}{365}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

The terms of equation ({{EquationNote|1}}) can be collected to arrive at:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;P(A')=\left(\frac{1}{365}\right)^{23}\times(365\times364\times363\times\cdots\times343)&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

Evaluating equation ({{EquationNote|2}}) gives {{math|''P''(''A''′) ≈ 0.492703}}

Therefore, {{math|''P''(''A'') ≈ 1 − 0.492703 {{=}} 0.507297}}&amp;nbsp;(50.7297%).

This process can be generalized to a group of {{mvar|n}} people, where {{math|''p''(''n'')}} is the probability of at least two of the {{mvar|n}} people sharing a birthday.  It is easier to first calculate the probability {{math|''{{overline|p}}''(''n'')}} that all {{mvar|n}} birthdays are ''different''.  According to the [[pigeonhole principle]], {{math|''{{overline|p}}''(''n'')}} is zero when {{math|''n'' &gt; 365}}.  When {{math|''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8804;&amp;nbsp;365}}:

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align} \bar p(n) &amp;= 1 \times \left(1-\frac{1}{365}\right) \times \left(1-\frac{2}{365}\right) \times \cdots \times \left(1-\frac{n-1}{365}\right) \\  &amp;= \frac{ 365 \times 364 \times \cdots \times (365-n+1) }{ 365^n } \\ &amp;= \frac{ 365! }{ 365^n (365-n)!} = \frac{n!\cdot\binom{365}{n}}{365^n} = \frac{_{365}P_n}{365^n}\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|!}} is the [[factorial]] operator, {{math|&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;(&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;{{su|p=365|b=''n''|a=c}}&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;}} is the [[binomial coefficient]] and {{math|''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;''}} denotes [[permutation]].

The equation expresses the fact that the first person has no one to share a birthday, the second person cannot have the same birthday as the first ({{sfrac|364|365}}), the third cannot have the same birthday as either of the first two ({{sfrac|363|365}}), and in general the {{mvar|n}}th birthday cannot be the same as any of the {{math|''n'' − 1}} preceding birthdays.

The [[event (probability theory)|event]] of at least two of the {{mvar|n}} persons having the same birthday is [[complementary event|complementary]] to all {{mvar|n}} birthdays being different. Therefore, its probability {{math|''p''(''n'')}} is

:&lt;math&gt; p(n) = 1 - \bar p(n). &lt;/math&gt;

The following table shows the probability for some other values of {{mvar|n}} (this table ignores the existence of leap years, as described above, as well as assuming that each birthday is equally likely):

==Approximations==
[[Image:Birthday paradox probability.svg|thumb|right|300px|Graphs showing the approximate probabilities of at least two people sharing a birthday ({{color|red|red}}) and its complementary event ({{color|blue|blue}})]]
[[Image:Birthday paradox approximation.svg|thumb|right|300px|A graph showing the accuracy of the approximation {{math|1 − ''e''&lt;sup&gt;−{{frac|''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|730}}&lt;/sup&gt;}} ({{color|red|red}})]]
The [[Taylor series]] expansion of the [[exponential function]] (the constant {{math|''e'' ≈ {{val|2.718281828}}}})

:&lt;math&gt; e^x = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!}+\cdots &lt;/math&gt;

provides a first-order approximation for {{math|''e''&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;}} for {{math|''x'' ≪ 1}}:

:&lt;math&gt; e^x \approx 1 + x.&lt;/math&gt;

To apply this approximation to the first expression derived for {{math|''{{overline|p}}''(''n'')}}, set {{math|''x'' {{=}} −{{sfrac|''a''|365}}}}. Thus,
:&lt;math&gt; e^{-\frac{a}{365}} \approx 1 - \frac{a}{365}. &lt;/math&gt;

Then, replace {{mvar|a}} with non-negative integers for each term in the formula of {{math|''{{overline|p}}''(''n'')}} until {{math|''a'' {{=}} ''n'' − 1}}, for example, when {{math|''a'' {{=}} 1}},
:&lt;math&gt; e^{-\frac{1}{365}} \approx 1 - \frac{1}{365}. &lt;/math&gt;

The first expression derived for {{math|''{{overline|p}}''(''n'')}} can be approximated as

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\bar p(n) &amp; \approx 1 \cdot e^{-\frac{1}{365}} \cdot e^{-\frac{2}{365}} \cdots e^{-\frac{n-1}{365}} \\
&amp; = e^{-\frac{1+2+ \cdots +(n-1)}{365}} \\
&amp; = e^{-\frac{n(n-1)/2}{365}} = e^{-\frac{n(n-1)}{730}}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt; p(n) = 1-\bar p(n) \approx 1 - e^{- \frac{n(n-1)}{730}}.&lt;/math&gt;

An even coarser approximation is given by

:&lt;math&gt;p(n)\approx 1-e^{- \frac{n^2}{730}},&lt;/math&gt;

which, as the graph illustrates, is still fairly accurate.

According to the approximation, the same approach can be applied to any number of "people" and "days". If rather than 365 days there are {{mvar|d}}, if there are {{mvar|n}} persons, and if {{math|''n'' ≪ ''d''}}, then using the same approach as above we achieve the result that if {{math|''p''(''n'', ''d'')}} is the probability that at least two out of {{mvar|n}} people share the same birthday from a set of {{mvar|d}} available days, then:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 p(n, d) &amp; \approx 1-e^{\frac{-n (n-1)}{2d}} \\
&amp; \approx 1-e^{\frac{-n^2}{2d}}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

===A simple exponentiation===
The probability of any two people not having the same birthday is {{sfrac|364|365}}. In a room containing ''n'' people, there are {{math|&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;(&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;{{su|p=''n''|b=2|a=c}}&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; {{=}} {{sfrac|''n''(''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)|2}}}} pairs of people, i.e. {{math|&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;(&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;{{su|p=''n''|b=2|a=c}}&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;}} events. The probability of no two people sharing the same birthday can be approximated by assuming that these events are independent and hence by multiplying their probability together. In short {{sfrac|364|365}} can be multiplied by itself {{math|&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;(&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;{{su|p=''n''|b=2|a=c}}&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;}} times, which gives us

:&lt;math&gt;\bar p(n) \approx \left(\frac{364}{365}\right)^\binom{n}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since this is the probability of no one having the same birthday, then the probability of someone sharing a birthday is

:&lt;math&gt;p(n) \approx 1 - \left(\frac{364}{365}\right)^\binom{n}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Poisson approximation===
Applying the [[Poisson distribution|Poisson]] approximation for the binomial on the group of 23 people,

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Poi}\left(\frac{\binom{23}{2}}{365}\right) =\operatorname{Poi}\left(\frac{253}{365}\right) \approx \operatorname{Poi}(0.6932)&lt;/math&gt;

so

:&lt;math&gt;\Pr(X&gt;0)=1-\Pr(X=0) \approx 1-e^{-0.6932} \approx 1-0.499998=0.500002.&lt;/math&gt;

The result is over 50% as previous descriptions.

===Square approximation===
A good [[rule of thumb]] which can be used for [[mental calculation]] is the relation

:&lt;math&gt;p(n) \approx \frac{n^2}{2m}&lt;/math&gt;

which can also be written as

:&lt;math&gt;n \approx \sqrt { 2m \times p(n)}&lt;/math&gt;

which works well for probabilities less than or equal to {{sfrac|1|2}}. In these equations, {{mvar|m}} is the number of days in a year.

For instance, to estimate the number of people required for a {{sfrac|1|2}} chance of a shared birthday, we get

:&lt;math&gt;n \approx \sqrt{ 2 \times 365 \times \tfrac12} = \sqrt{365} \approx 19&lt;/math&gt;

Which is not too far from the correct answer of 23.

===Approximation of number of people===
This can also be approximated using the following formula for the ''number'' of people necessary to have at least a {{sfrac|1|2}} chance of matching:
:&lt;math&gt;n \approx \tfrac{1}{2} + \sqrt{\tfrac{1}{4} + 2 \times \ln(2) \times 365} = 22.999943.&lt;/math&gt;
This is a result of the good approximation that an event with {{math|{{sfrac|1|''k''}}}} probability will have a {{sfrac|1|2}} chance of occurring at least once if it is repeated {{math|''k'' [[natural logarithm of 2|ln 2]]}} times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The white fields in this table show the number of hashes needed to achieve the given probability of collision (column) given a hash space of a certain size in bits (row). Using the birthday analogy: the "hash space size" resembles the "available days", the "probability of collision" resembles the "probability of shared birthday", and the "required number of hashed elements" resembles the "required number of people in a group". One could of course also use this chart to determine the minimum hash size required (given upper bounds on the hashes and probability of error), or the probability of collision (for fixed number of hashes and probability of error).

For comparison, {{val|e=-18}} to {{val|e=-15}} is the uncorrectable bit error rate of a typical hard disk.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Gray, Catharine van Ingen. [https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0701166 Empirical Measurements of Disk Failure Rates and Error Rates]&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, 128-bit hash functions, such as [[MD5]], should stay within that range until about {{val|8.2|e=11}} documents, even if its possible outputs are many more.

==An upper bound==
The argument below is adapted from an argument of [[Paul Halmos]].{{refn|group=nb|In his autobiography, Halmos criticized the form in which the birthday paradox is often presented, in terms of numerical computation.  He believed that it should be used as an example in the use of more abstract mathematical concepts. He wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The reasoning is based on important tools that all students of mathematics should have ready access to.  The birthday problem used to be a splendid illustration of the advantages of pure thought over mechanical manipulation; the inequalities can be obtained in a minute or two, whereas the multiplications would take much longer, and be much more subject to error, whether the instrument is a pencil or an old-fashioned desk computer. What [[calculator]]s do not yield is understanding, or mathematical facility, or a solid basis for more advanced, generalized theories.&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

As stated above, the probability that no two birthdays coincide is

:&lt;math&gt;1-p(n) = \bar p(n) = \prod_{k=1}^{n-1}\left(1-\frac{k}{365}\right) .&lt;/math&gt;

As in earlier paragraphs, interest lies in the smallest {{mvar|n}} such that {{math|''p''(''n'') &gt; {{sfrac|1|2}}}}; or equivalently, the smallest {{mvar|n}} such that {{math|''{{overline|p}}''(''n'') &lt; {{sfrac|1|2}}}}.

Using the inequality {{math|1 − ''x'' &lt; ''e''&lt;sup&gt;−''x''&lt;/sup&gt;}} in the above expression we replace {{math|1 − {{sfrac|''k''|365}}}} with {{math|''e''&lt;sup&gt;−{{frac|''k''|365}}&lt;/sup&gt;}}. This yields

:&lt;math&gt;\bar p(n) = \prod_{k=1}^{n-1}\left(1-\frac{k}{365}\right) &lt; \prod_{k=1}^{n-1}\left(e^{-\frac{k}{365}}\right) = e^{-\frac{n(n-1)}{730}} .&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the expression above is not only an approximation, but also an [[upper bound]] of {{math|''{{overline|p}}''(''n'')}}. The inequality

:&lt;math&gt; e^{-\frac{n(n-1)}{730}} &lt; \frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

implies {{math|''{{overline|p}}''(''n'') &lt; {{sfrac|1|2}}}}. Solving for {{mvar|n}} gives

:&lt;math&gt;n^2-n &gt; 730 \ln 2 .&lt;/math&gt;

Now, {{math|730 ln 2}} is approximately 505.997, which is barely below 506, the value of {{math|''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''n''}} attained when {{math|''n'' {{=}} 23}}. Therefore, 23 people suffice. Incidentally, solving {{math|''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''n'' {{=}} 730 ln 2}} for ''n'' gives the approximate formula of Frank H. Mathis cited above.

This derivation only shows that ''at most'' 23 people are needed to ensure a birthday match with even chance; it leaves open the possibility that {{mvar|n}} is 22 or less could also work.

==Generalizations==

===The generalized birthday problem===
Given a year with {{mvar|d}} days, the '''generalized birthday problem''' asks for the minimal number {{math|''n''(''d'')}} such that, in a set of {{mvar|n}} randomly chosen people, the probability of a birthday coincidence is at least 50%. In other words, {{math|''n''(''d'')}} is the minimal integer {{mvar|n}} such that

:&lt;math&gt;1-\left(1-\frac{1}{d}\right)\left(1-\frac{2}{d}\right)\cdots\left(1-\frac{n-1}{d}\right)\geq \frac{1}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The classical birthday problem thus corresponds to determining {{math|''n''(365)}}. The first 99 values of {{math|''n''(''d'')}} are given here:

:{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
|-
! scope="row" | {{mvar|d}}
| 1–2 || 3–5 || 6–9 || 10–16 || 17–23 || 24–32 || 33–42 || 43–54 || 55–68 || 69–82 || 83–99
|-
! scope="row" | {{math|''n''(''d'')}}
| 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7 || 8 || 9 || 10 || 11 || 12
|}

A number of bounds and formulas for {{math|''n''(''d'')}} have been published.&lt;ref&gt;{{wikicite|ref={{Harvid|Brink|2012}}|reference=D. Brink, A (probably) exact solution to the Birthday Problem, Ramanujan Journal, 2012, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/1194r3627822841q/ doi: 10.1007/s11139-011-9343-9].}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For any {{math|''d'' ≥ 1}}, the number {{math|''n''(''d'')}} satisfies&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|author=Brink|year=2012|nb=yes|loc=Theorem 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{3-2\ln2}{6}&lt;n(d)-\sqrt{2d\ln2}\leq 9-\sqrt{86\ln2}.&lt;/math&gt;

These bounds are optimal in the sense that the sequence {{math|''n''(''d'') − {{sqrt|2''d'' ln 2}}}}
gets arbitrarily close to
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{3-2\ln2}{6} \approx 0.27,&lt;/math&gt;
while it has
:&lt;math&gt;9-\sqrt{86\ln2}\approx 1.28&lt;/math&gt;
as its maximum, taken for {{math|''d'' {{=}} 43}}.

The bounds are sufficiently tight to give the exact value of {{math|''n''(''d'')}} in 99% of all cases, for example {{math|''n''(365) {{=}} 23}}. In general, it follows from these bounds that {{math|''n''(''d'')}} always equals either
:&lt;math&gt;\left\lceil\sqrt{2d\ln2}\,\right\rceil \quad\text{or}\quad \left\lceil\sqrt{2d\ln2}\,\right\rceil+1&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|⌈ · ⌉}} denotes the [[Floor and ceiling functions|ceiling function]].
The formula

:&lt;math&gt;n(d) = \left\lceil\sqrt{2d\ln2}\,\right\rceil&lt;/math&gt;

holds for 73% of all integers {{mvar|d}}.&lt;ref name=Brink&gt;{{Harvard citations|author=Brink|year=2012|nb=yes|loc=Theorem 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The formula

:&lt;math&gt;n(d) = \left\lceil\sqrt{2d\ln2}+\frac{3-2\ln2}{6}\right\rceil&lt;/math&gt;

holds for [[almost all]] {{mvar|d}}, i.e., for a set of integers {{mvar|d}} with [[asymptotic density]] 1.&lt;ref name=Brink/&gt;

The formula

:&lt;math&gt;n(d)=\left\lceil \sqrt{2d\ln2}+\frac{3-2\ln2}{6}+\frac{9-4(\ln2)^2}{72\sqrt{2d\ln2}}\right\rceil&lt;/math&gt;

holds for all {{math|''d'' ≤ {{val|e=18}}}}, but it is conjectured that there are infinitely many counterexamples to this formula.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Harvard citations|author=Brink|year=2012|nb=yes|loc=Table 3, Conjecture 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formula

:&lt;math&gt;n(d)=\left\lceil \sqrt{2d\ln2}+\frac{3-2\ln2}{6}+\frac{9-4(\ln2)^2}{72\sqrt{2d\ln2}}-\frac{2(\ln2)^2}{135d}\right\rceil&lt;/math&gt;

holds for all {{math|''d'' ≤ {{val|e=18}}}}, and it is conjectured that this formula holds for all {{mvar|d}}.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Cast as a collision problem===
The birthday problem can be generalized as follows:
:Given {{mvar|n}} random integers drawn from a [[Uniform distribution (discrete)|discrete uniform distribution]] with range {{math|[1,''d'']}}, what is the probability {{math|''p''(''n''; ''d'')}} that at least two numbers are the same? ({{math|''d'' {{=}} 365}} gives the usual birthday problem.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | url = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11927587_5| title =  Birthday Paradox for Multi-collisions| last1 = Suzuki| first1 = K. 
| last2 = Tonien| first2 = D. ''et al.''| date = 2006| publisher = Springer| book-title =  Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol 4296 | location = Berlin
| id = Information Security and Cryptology – ICISC 2006| editor = Rhee M.S., Lee B. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The generic results can be derived using the same arguments given above.
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
p(n;d) &amp;= \begin{cases} 1-\displaystyle\prod_{k=1}^{n-1}\left(1-\frac{k}{d}\right) &amp; n\le d \\ 1 &amp; n &gt; d \end{cases} \\[8px]
&amp; \approx 1 - e^{-\frac{n(n-1)}{2d}} \\
&amp; \approx 1 - \left( \frac{d-1}{d} \right)^\frac{n(n-1)}{2}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Conversely, if {{math|''n''(''p''; ''d'')}} denotes the number of random integers drawn from {{math|[1,''d'']}} to obtain a probability {{mvar|p}} that at least two numbers are the same, then
:&lt;math&gt;n(p;d)\approx \sqrt{2d \cdot \ln\left(\frac{1}{1-p}\right)}.&lt;/math&gt;

The birthday problem in this more generic sense applies to [[hash function]]s: the expected number of {{math|''N''}}-[[bit]] hashes that can be generated before getting a collision is not {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, but rather only {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;{{frac|''N''|2}}&lt;/sup&gt;}}. This is exploited by [[birthday attack]]s on [[cryptographic hash function]]s and is the reason why a small number of collisions in a [[hash table]] are, for all practical purposes, inevitable.

The theory behind the birthday problem was used by Zoe Schnabel&lt;ref&gt;Z. E. Schnabel (1938) ''The Estimation of the Total Fish Population of a Lake'', [[American Mathematical Monthly]] '''45''', 348–352.&lt;/ref&gt; under the name of [[mark and recapture|capture-recapture]] statistics to estimate the size of fish population in lakes.

====Generalization to multiple types====
[[File:2d birthday.png|thumb|Plot of the probability of at least one shared birthday between at least one man and one woman]]
The basic problem considers all trials to be of one "type". The  birthday problem has been generalized to consider an arbitrary number of types.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Christopher Wendl|M. C. Wendl]] (2003) ''[https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0167-7152(03)00168-8 Collision Probability Between Sets of Random Variables]'', Statistics and Probability Letters '''64'''(3), 249–254.&lt;/ref&gt; In the simplest extension there are two types of people, say {{mvar|m}} men and {{mvar|n}} women, and the problem becomes characterizing the probability of a shared birthday between at least one man and one woman. (Shared birthdays between two men or two women do not count.) The probability of no shared birthdays here is

:&lt;math&gt;p_0 =\frac{1}{d^{m+n}} \sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{j=1}^n S_2(m,i) S_2(n,j) \prod_{k=0}^{i+j-1} d - k&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''d'' {{=}} 365}} and {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} are [[Stirling numbers of the second kind]]. Consequently, the desired probability is {{math|1 − ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

This variation of the birthday problem is interesting because there is not a unique solution for the total number of people {{math|''m'' + ''n''}}. For example, the usual 50% probability value is realized for both a 32-member group of 16 men and 16 women and a 49-member group of 43 women and 6 men.

==Other birthday problems==

===Reverse problem===
For a fixed probability {{mvar|p}}:
* Find the greatest {{mvar|n}} for which the probability {{math|''p''(''n'')}} is smaller than the given {{mvar|p}}, or
* Find the smallest {{mvar|n}} for which the probability {{math|''p''(''n'')}} is greater than the given {{mvar|p}}.

Taking the above formula for {{math|''d''&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;365}} we have:

:&lt;math&gt;n(p;365)\approx \sqrt{730\ln\left(\frac{1}{1-p}\right)}.&lt;/math&gt;

===First match===
A related question is, as people enter a room one at a time, which one is most likely to be the first to have the same birthday as someone already in the room?  That is, for what {{mvar|n}} is {{math|''p''(''n'') − ''p''(''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)}} maximum?  The answer is 20—if there is a prize for first match, the best position in line is 20th.

===Same birthday as you===
[[Image:Birthday paradox.svg|thumb|right|300px|Comparing {{math|''p''(''n'')}} = probability of a birthday match with {{math|''q''(''n'')}} = probability of matching ''your'' birthday]]
Note that in the birthday problem, neither of the two people is chosen in advance. By way of contrast, the probability {{math|''q''(''n'')}} that someone in a room of {{mvar|n}} other people has the same birthday  as a particular person (for example, you), is given by

: &lt;math&gt; q(n) = 1 - \left( \frac{365-1}{365} \right)^n &lt;/math&gt;
and for general {{mvar|d}} by
: &lt;math&gt; q(n;d) = 1 - \left( \frac{d-1}{d} \right)^n. &lt;/math&gt;

In the standard case of {{math|''d'' {{=}} 365}} substituting {{math|''n'' {{=}} 23}} gives about 6.1%, which is less than 1 chance in 16.  For a greater than 50% chance that one person in a roomful of {{mvar|n}} people has the same birthday as ''you'', {{mvar|n}} would need to be at least 253.&lt;!-- Caution! Think twice before changing it to 23 ;-) --&gt; Note that this number is significantly higher than {{math|{{sfrac|365|2}} {{=}} {{sfrac|182|1|2}}}}: the reason is that it is likely that there are some birthday matches among the other people in the room.

It is not a coincidence that {{math|253 {{=}} {{sfrac|23 × (23 − 1)|2}}}}; a similar approximate pattern can be found using a number of possibilities different from 365, or a target probability different from 50%.

===Near matches===
Another generalization is to ask what is the probability of finding at least one pair in a group of {{mvar|n}} people with birthdays within {{mvar|k}} calendar days of each other's, if there are {{mvar|m}} equally likely birthdays.&lt;ref name="abramson"&gt;M. Abramson and W. O. J. Moser (1970) ''More Birthday Surprises'', [[American Mathematical Monthly]] '''77''', 856–858&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align} p(n,k,m) &amp;= 1 - \frac{ (m - nk -1)! }{ m^{n-1} \bigl(m - n(k+1)\bigr)!}\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

The number of people required so that the probability that some pair will have a birthday separated by {{mvar|k}} days or fewer will be higher than 50% is:

:{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center"
! {{mvar|''k''}} !! {{mvar|n}}&lt;br&gt;for {{math|''m'' {{=}} 365}}
|-
|0 || 23
|-
|1 || 14
|-
|2 || 11
|-
|3 || 9
|-
|4 || 8
|-
|5 || 8
|-
|6 || 7
|-
|7 || 7
|}

Thus in a group of just seven random people, it is more likely than not that two of them will have a birthday within a week of each other.&lt;ref name="abramson"/&gt;

===Collision counting===
The probability that the {{mvar|k}}th integer randomly chosen from {{math|[1,''d'']}} will repeat at least one previous choice equals {{math|''q''(''k'' − 1; ''d'')}} above.  The expected total number of times a selection will repeat a previous selection as {{mvar|n}} such integers are chosen equals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Might|first1=Matt|title=Collision hash collisions with the birthday paradox|url=http://matt.might.net/articles/counting-hash-collisions/|website=Matt Might's blog|accessdate=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^n q(k-1;d) = n - d + d \left (\frac {d-1} {d} \right )^n.&lt;/math&gt;

===Average number of people===
In an alternative formulation of the birthday problem, one asks the ''average'' number of people required to find a pair with the same birthday. If we consider the probability function Pr[{{mvar|n}} people have at least one shared birthday], this ''average'' is determining the [[Mean]] of the distribution, as opposed to the customary formulation which determines the [[Median]].  The problem is relevant to several [[hash function|hashing algorithms]] analyzed by [[Donald Knuth]] in his book ''[[The Art of Computer Programming]]''. It may be shown&lt;ref name="knuth73"&gt;{{cite book |first=D. E. |last=Knuth |title=The Art of Computer Programming |volume=Vol. 3, Sorting and Searching |publisher=Addison-Wesley |location=Reading, Massachusetts |year=1973 |isbn=0-201-03803-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="flajolet95"&gt;{{cite journal |first=P. |last=Flajolet |first2=P. J. |last2=Grabner |first3=P. |last3=Kirschenhofer |first4=H. |last4=Prodinger |year=1995 |title=On Ramanujan's Q-Function |journal=Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics |volume=58 |issue= |pages=103–116 |doi=10.1016/0377-0427(93)E0258-N }}&lt;/ref&gt; that if one samples uniformly, with replacement, from a population of size {{math|''M''}}, the number of trials required for the first repeated sampling of ''some'' individual has [[expected value]] {{math|{{overline|''n''}} {{=}} 1 + ''Q''(''M'')}}, where

: &lt;math&gt;Q(M)=\sum_{k=1}^{M} \frac{M!}{(M-k)! M^k}.&lt;/math&gt;

The function

: &lt;math&gt;Q(M)= 1 + \frac{M-1}{M} + \frac{(M-1)(M-2)}{M^2} + \cdots + \frac{(M-1)(M-2) \cdots 1}{M^{M-1}}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!-- Shouldn't this sum be up to M ? Without it the term M!/M^M is missing--&gt;
has been studied by [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]] and has [[asymptotic expansion]]:

: &lt;math&gt;Q(M)\sim\sqrt{\frac{\pi M}{2}}-\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{12}\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2M}}-\frac{4}{135M}+\cdots.&lt;/math&gt;

With {{math|''M'' {{=}} 365}} days in a year, the average number of people required to find a pair with the same birthday is {{math|{{overline|''n''}} {{=}} 1 + ''Q''(''M'') ≈ 24.61659}}, somewhat more than 23, the number required for a 50% chance. In the best case, two people will suffice; at worst, the maximum possible number of {{math|''M'' + 1 {{=}} 366}} people is needed; but on average, only 25 people are required.

An informal demonstration of the problem can be made from the [[list of Prime Ministers of Australia]], of which there have been 29 {{as of|2017|lc=yes}}, in which [[Paul Keating]], the 24th Prime Minister, and [[Edmund Barton]], the first Prime Minister, share the same birthday, 18 January.

In the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], each of the 32 squads had 23 players.  An analysis of the official squad lists suggested that 16 squads had pairs of players sharing birthdays, and of these 5 squads had two pairs: Argentina, France, Iran, South Korea and Switzerland each had two pairs, and Australia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Cameroon, Colombia, Honduras, Netherlands, Nigeria, Russia, Spain and USA each with one pair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-27835311 |title=The birthday paradox at the World Cup |last1=Fletcher |first1=James |date=16 June 2014 |website=bbc.com |publisher=BBC |access-date=27 August 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voracek, Tran and [[Anton Formann|Formann]] showed that the majority of people markedly overestimate the number of people that is necessary to achieve a given probability of people having the same birthday, and markedly underestimate the probability of people having the same birthday when a specific sample size is given.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Voracek |first=M. |last2=Tran |first2=U. S. |last3=Formann |first3=A. K. |year=2008 |title=Birthday and birthmate problems: Misconceptions of probability among psychology undergraduates and casino visitors and personnel |journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills |volume=106 |pages=91–103 |doi=10.2466/pms.106.1.91-103 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further results were that psychology students and women did better on the task than casino visitors/personnel or men, but were less confident about their estimates.

==Partition problem==
A related problem is the [[partition problem]], a variant of the [[knapsack problem]] from operations research. Some weights are put on a [[Weighing scale|balance scale]]; each weight is an integer number of grams randomly chosen between one gram and one million grams (one [[tonne]]). The question is whether one can usually (that is, with probability close to 1) transfer the weights between the left and right arms to balance the scale. (In case the sum of all the weights is an odd number of grams, a discrepancy of one gram is allowed.) If there are only two or three weights, the answer is very clearly no; although there are some combinations which work, the majority of randomly selected combinations of three weights do not. If there are very many weights, the answer is clearly yes. The question is, how many are just sufficient? That is, what is the number of weights such that it is equally likely for it to be possible to balance them as it is to be impossible?

Some people's intuition is that the answer is above {{val|100000}}. Most people's intuition is that it is in the thousands or tens of thousands, while others feel it should at least be in the hundreds. The correct answer is 23.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The reason is that the correct comparison is to the number of partitions of the weights into left and right. There are {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''N'' − 1&lt;/sup&gt;}} different partitions for {{math|''N''}} weights, and the left sum minus the right sum can be thought of as a new random quantity for each partition. The distribution of the sum of weights is approximately [[normal distribution|Gaussian]], with a peak at {{math|{{val|1000000}}''N''}} and width {{math|{{val|1000000}}{{sqrt|''N''}}}}, so that when {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''N'' − 1&lt;/sup&gt;}} is approximately equal to {{math|{{val|1000000}}{{sqrt|''N''}}}} the transition occurs.  2&lt;sup&gt;23 − 1&lt;/sup&gt; is about 4 million, while the width of the distribution is only 5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=C. |last=Borgs |first2=J. |last2=Chayes |first3=B. |last3=Pittel |year=2001 |title=Phase Transition and Finite Size Scaling in the Integer Partition Problem |journal=Random Structures and Algorithms |volume=19 |issue=3–4 |pages=247–288 |doi=10.1002/rsa.10004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==
[[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s novel ''[[A Fall of Moondust]]'', published in 1961, contains a section where the main characters, trapped underground for an indefinite amount of time, are celebrating a birthday and find themselves discussing the validity of the birthday problem. As stated by a physicist passenger: "If you have a group of more than twenty-four people, the odds are better than even that two of them have the same birthday." Eventually, out of 22 present, it is revealed that two characters share the same birthday, May 23.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4027">In [[control theory]], a '''causal system''' (also known as a [[physical system|physical]] or '''nonanticipative system''') is a [[system]] where the output depends on past and
current inputs but not future inputs—i.e., the output &lt;math&gt; y(t_{0})&lt;/math&gt; depends on only the input &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; for values of &lt;math&gt;t \le t_{0}&lt;/math&gt;.

The idea that the output of a function at any time depends only on past and present values of input is defined by the property commonly referred to as [[causality]].  A system that has ''some'' dependence on input values from the future (in addition to possible dependence on past or current input values) is termed a non-causal or [[acausal system]], and a system that depends ''solely'' on future input values is an [[anticausal system]].  Note that some authors have defined an anticausal system as one that depends solely on future ''and present'' input values or, more simply, as a system that does not depend on past input values.

Classically, [[nature]] or physical reality has been considered to be a causal system.  Physics involving [[special relativity]] or [[general relativity]] require more careful definitions of causality, as described elaborately in [[Causality (physics)]].

The causality of systems also plays an important role in [[digital signal processing]], where [[LTI system theory|filters]] are constructed so that they are causal, sometimes by altering a non-causal formulation to remove the lack of causality so that it is realizable. For more information, see [[causal filter]].

For a causal system, the [[impulse response]] of the system must use only the present and past values of the input to determine the output. This requirement is a necessary and sufficient condition for a system to be causal, regardless of linearity. Note that similar rules apply to either discrete or continuous cases. By this definition of requiring no future input values, systems must be causal to process signals in real time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=McClellan, James H. |author2=Schafer, Ronald W. |author3=Yoder, Mark A. | title=DSP First, Second Edition | publisher=Pearson Education | year=2015 | isbn=978-0136019251 | page=151 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mathematical definitions ==

Definition 1: A system mapping &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is causal if and only if, for any pair of input signals &lt;math&gt;x_{1}(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_{2}(t)&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;x_{1}(t) = x_{2}(t), \quad \forall \ t &lt; t_{0},&lt;/math&gt;
the corresponding outputs satisfy
:&lt;math&gt;y_{1}(t) = y_{2}(t), \quad \forall \ t &lt; t_{0}.&lt;/math&gt;

Definition 2: Suppose &lt;math&gt;h(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the impulse response of any system &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; described by a linear constant coefficient differential equation. The system &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is causal if and only if
:&lt;math&gt;h(t) = 0, \quad \forall \ t &lt;0 &lt;/math&gt;
otherwise it is non-causal.

==Examples==
The following examples are for systems with an input &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and output &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Examples of causal systems ===
* Memoryless system
::&lt;math&gt;y \left( t \right) = 1 - x \left( t \right) \cos \left( \omega t \right)&lt;/math&gt;

* Autoregressive filter
::&lt;math&gt;y \left( t \right) = \int_0^\infty x(t-\tau) e^{-\beta\tau}\,d\tau&lt;/math&gt;

=== Examples of non-causal (acausal) systems ===
*
::&lt;math&gt;y(t)=\int_{-\infty}^\infty \sin (t+\tau) x(\tau)\,d\tau&lt;/math&gt;

* Central moving average
::&lt;math&gt;y_n=\frac{1}{2}\,x_{n-1}+\frac{1}{2}\,x_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Examples of anti-causal systems ===
*
::&lt;math&gt;y(t) =\int _0^\infty \sin (t+\tau)\,d\tau&lt;/math&gt;

*Look-ahead
::&lt;math&gt;y_n=x_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Christiaan Huygens''' {{postnominals|FRS}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|aɪ|ɡ|ə|n|z|,_|ˈ|h|ɔɪ|-}} {{respell|HY|gənz|,_|HOY-}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/huygens "Huygens"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-nl|ˈɦœyɣə(n)s|lang|ChristianHuygensPronunciation.ogg}}; {{lang-la|Hugenius}}; 14 April 1629 – 8 July 1695) was a Dutch [[physics|physicist]], [[mathematician]], [[astronomer]] and [[inventor]], who is widely regarded as one of the greatest scientists of all time and a major figure in the [[scientific revolution]]. In physics, Huygens made groundbreaking contributions in [[optics]] and [[mechanics]], while as an astronomer he is chiefly known for his studies of the [[rings of Saturn]] and the discovery of its moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]. As an inventor, he improved the design of the telescope with the invention of the [[Huygenian eyepiece]]. His most famous invention, however, was the invention of the [[pendulum clock]] in 1656, which was a breakthrough in timekeeping and became the most accurate timekeeper for almost 300 years. Because he was the first to use mathematical formulae to describe the laws of physics, Huygens has been called the first [[Theoretical physics|theoretical physicist]] and the founder of [[mathematical physics]].&lt;ref&gt;Dijksterhuis E.J (1950) ''De mechanisering van het wereldbeeld''. Meulenhoff, Amsterdam.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andriesse, C.D. (2005) ''Huygens: The Man Behind the Principle''. Cambridge University Press. Cambridge: 6&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1659, Huygens was the first to derive the now standard formula for the [[centripetal force]] in his work ''De vi centrifuga''. The formula played a central role in [[classical mechanics]] and became known as the second of [[Newton's laws of motion]]. Huygens was also the first to formulate the correct laws of [[elastic collision]] in his work ''De motu corporum ex percussione'', but his findings were not published until 1703, after his death. In the field of optics, he is best known for his [[wave theory of light]], which he proposed in 1678 and described in 1690 in his ''[[Treatise on Light]]'', which is regarded as the first mathematical theory of light. His theory was initially rejected in favor of [[Isaac Newton]]'s [[corpuscular theory of light]], until [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]] adopted Huygens' principle in 1818 and showed that it could explain the rectilinear propagation and diffraction effects of light. Today this principle is known as the [[Huygens–Fresnel principle]].

Huygens invented the [[pendulum clock]] in 1656, which he patented the following year. In addition to this invention, his research in [[horology]] resulted in an extensive analysis of the [[pendulum]] in his 1673 book ''[[Horologium Oscillatorium]]'', which is regarded as one of the most important 17th-century works in mechanics. While the first part of the book contains descriptions of clock designs, most of the book is an analysis of pendulum motion and a theory of [[curve]]s. In 1655, Huygens began grinding lenses with his brother Constantijn in order to build telescopes to conduct astronomical research. He designed a 50-power [[refracting telescope]] with which he discovered that the [[Rings of Saturn|ring of Saturn]] was "a thin, flat ring, nowhere touching, and inclined to the ecliptic." It was with this telescope that he also discovered the first of Saturn's moons, Titan. He eventually developed in 1662 what is now called the [[Huygenian eyepiece]], a telescope with two lenses, which diminished the amount of [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersion]].

As a mathematician, Huygens was a pioneer on [[probability]] and wrote his first treatise on [[probability theory]] in 1657 with the work ''Van Rekeningh in Spelen van Gluck''. [[Frans van Schooten]], who was the private tutor of Huygens, translated the work as ''De ratiociniis in ludo aleae'' ("On Reasoning in Games of Chance"). The work is a systematic treatise on probability and deals with [[games of chance]] and in particular the [[problem of points]]. The modern concept of probability grew out of the use of expectation values by Huygens and [[Blaise Pascal]] (who encouraged him to write the work).

The last years of Huygens, who never married, were characterized by loneliness and depression. As a [[rationalism|rationalist]], he refused to believe in an [[immanence|immanent]] supreme being, and could not accept the Christian faith of his upbringing. Although Huygens did not believe in such a supernatural being, he did hypothesize on the possibility of [[extraterrestrial life]] in his ''Cosmotheoros'', which was published shortly before his death in 1695. He speculated that extraterrestrial life was possible on planets similar to Earth and wrote that the availability of water in liquid form was a necessity for life.

Costabel, "Chapter Two, The Birth of a new Science" in ''The Beginnings of Modern Science'', edited by Rene Taton, 1958,1964, Basic Books, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was [[Suzanna van Baerle]]. She died in 1637, shortly after the birth of Huygens' sister.&lt;ref&gt;''Strategic Affection? Gift Exchange in Seventeenth-Century Holland'', by Irma Thoen, pg 127&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had five children: [[Constantijn Huygens, Jr.|Constantijn]] (1628), Christiaan (1629), [[Lodewijck Huygens|Lodewijk]] (1631), Philips (1632) and Suzanna (1637).&lt;ref name="father"&gt;[http://www.essentialvermeer.com/history/huygens.html Constantijn Huygens, Lord of Zuilichem (1596–1687), by Adelheid Rech]&lt;/ref&gt;

Constantijn Huygens was a diplomat and advisor to the [[House of Orange]], and also a poet and musician. His friends included [[Galileo Galilei]], [[Marin Mersenne]] and [[René Descartes]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Heirs Of Archimedes: Science and the Art Of War Through the Age of Enlightenment'', by Brett D. Steele, pg. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Huygens was educated at home until turning sixteen years old. He liked to play with miniatures of [[mill (grinding)|mills]] and other machines. His father gave him a liberal education: he studied languages and music, history and [[geography]], [[mathematics]], [[logic]] and [[rhetoric]], but also [[dancing]], [[fencing]] and [[horse riding]].&lt;ref name="completedictionary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="father" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.entoen.nu/christiaanhuygens/en entoen.nu: Christiaan Huygens 1629–1695 Science in the Golden Age]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1644 Huygens had as his mathematical tutor [[Jan Jansz de Jonge Stampioen]], who set the 15-year-old a demanding reading list on contemporary science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jozef T. Devreese|title='Magic Is No Magic': The Wonderful World of Simon Stevin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f59h2ooQGmcC&amp;pg=PA275|accessdate=24 April 2013|date=31 October 2008|publisher=WIT Press|isbn=978-1-84564-391-1|pages=275–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Descartes was impressed by his skills in geometry.&lt;ref name="opendoor"/&gt;

==Student years==
His father sent Huygens to study law and mathematics at the [[University of Leiden]], where he studied from May 1645 to March 1647.&lt;ref name="completedictionary"/&gt; [[Frans van Schooten]] was an academic at Leiden from 1646, and also a private tutor to Huygens and his elder brother, replacing Stampioen on the advice of Descartes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=H.

After two years, from March 1647, Huygens continued his studies at the newly founded [[Orange College of Breda|Orange College]], in [[Breda]], where his father was a [[curator]]: the change occurred because of a duel between his brother Lodewijk and another student.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.proevenvanvroeger.nl/eindopdrachten/huygens/huygensfamily.pdf Christiaan Huygens – A family affair, by Bram Stoffele, pg 80.]&lt;/ref&gt; Constantijn Huygens was closely involved in the new College, which lasted only to 1669; the rector was [[André Rivet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=C. D. Andriesse|title=Huygens: The Man Behind the Principle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6FTqA9fwxFMC&amp;pg=PA80|accessdate=23 April 2013|date=25 August 2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-85090-2|pages=80–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christiaan Huygens lived at the home of the jurist Johann Henryk Dauber, and had mathematics classes with the English lecturer [[John Pell]]. He completed his studies in August 1649.&lt;ref name="completedictionary"/&gt; He then had a stint as a diplomat on a mission with [[Henry, Duke of Nassau]]. It took him to [[County of Bentheim (district)|Bentheim]], then [[Flensburg]]. He took off for Denmark, visited [[Copenhagen]] and [[Helsingør]], and hoped to cross the [[Øresund]] to visit Descartes in [[Stockholm]]. It was not to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=C. D. Andriesse|title=Huygens: The Man Behind the Principle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6FTqA9fwxFMC&amp;pg=PA85|accessdate=10 May 2013|date=25 August 2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-85090-2|pages=85–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While his father Constantijn had wished his son Christiaan to be a diplomat, it also was not to be. In political terms, the [[First Stadtholderless Period]] that began in 1650 meant that the House of Orange was not in power, removing Constantijn's influence. Further, he realised that his son had no interest in such a career.&lt;ref name="Dictionary, p. 469"&gt;Dictionary, p. 469.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early correspondence==
[[File:Huygens - Correspondance. 1638-1656, 1888 - 3917544.tif|thumb|''Correspondance'']]
Huygens generally wrote in French or Latin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lynn Thorndike|title=History of Magic &amp; Experimental Science 1923|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sr923sVWH_QC&amp;pg=PA622|accessdate=11 May 2013|date=1 March 2003|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|isbn=978-0-7661-4316-6|page=622}}&lt;/ref&gt; While still a college student at Leiden he began a correspondence with the intelligencer [[Marin Mersenne|Mersenne]], who died quite soon afterwards in 1648.&lt;ref name="completedictionary"/&gt; Mersenne wrote to Constantijn on his son's talent for mathematics, and flatteringly compared him to [[Archimedes]] (3 January 1647). The letters show the early interests of Huygens in mathematics. In October 1646 there is the [[suspension bridge]], and the demonstration that a [[catenary]] is not a [[parabola]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Leonhard Euler]]|editor=[[Clifford Truesdell]]|title=The Rational Mechanics of Flexible or Elastic Bodies 1638–1788: Introduction to Vol. X and XI|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gxrzm6y10EwC&amp;pg=PA44|accessdate=10 May 2013|date=1 January 1980|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-7643-1441-5|pages=44–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1647/8 they cover the claim of [[Grégoire de Saint-Vincent]] to [[squaring the circle]]; rectification of the ellipse; projectiles, and the [[vibrating string]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=C.

Huygens preferred [[meantone temperament]]; he innovated in [[31 equal temperament]], which was not itself a new idea but known to [[Francisco de Salinas]], using logarithms to investigate it further and show its close relation to the meantone system.&lt;ref name="Cohen1984"&gt;{{cite book|author=H.F.

In 1654, Huygens returned to his father's house in The Hague, and was able to devote himself entirely to research.&lt;ref name="completedictionary"/&gt; The family had another house, not far away at [[Hofwijck]], and he spent time there during the summer. His scholarly life did not allow him to escape bouts of depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=H. J. M.

[[File:Hofwijck garden-plans drawing.png|thumb|The garden plan at Hofwijck, 1653]]

Subsequently, Huygens developed a broad range of correspondents, though picking up the threads after 1648 was hampered by the five-year ''[[Fronde]]'' in France. Visiting Paris in 1655, Huygens called on [[Ismael Boulliau]] to introduce himself. Then Boulliau took him to see [[Claude Mylon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=C. D. Andriesse|title=Huygens: The Man Behind the Principle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6FTqA9fwxFMC&amp;pg=PA134|accessdate=10 May 2013|date=25 August 2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-85090-2|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Parisian group of savants that had gathered around Mersenne held together into the 1650s, and Mylon, who had assumed the secretarial role, took some trouble from then on to keep Huygens in touch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Hobbes|title=The Correspondence: 1660–1679|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GYF_mBtgIVwC&amp;pg=PA868|accessdate=10 May 2013|date=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-823748-8|page=868}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through [[Pierre de Carcavi]] Huygens corresponded in 1656 with [[Pierre de Fermat]], whom he admired greatly, though this side of idolatry. The experience was bittersweet and even puzzling, since it became clear that Fermat had dropped out of the research mainstream, and his priority claims could probably not be made good in some cases. Besides, Huygens was looking by then to apply mathematics, while Fermat's concerns ran to purer topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael S. Mahoney|title=The Mathematical Career of Pierre de Fermat: 1601–1665|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=My19IcewAnoC&amp;pg=PA67|accessdate=10 May 2013|date=1994|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-03666-3|pages=67–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific debut==
Huygens was often slow to publish his results and discoveries. In the early days his mentor Frans van Schooten was cautious for the sake of his reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=C. D. Andriesse|title=Huygens: The Man Behind the Principle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6FTqA9fwxFMC&amp;pg=PA126|accessdate=10 May 2013|date=25 August 2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-85090-2|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first work Huygens put in print was ''Theoremata de quadratura'' (1651) in the field of [[quadrature (mathematics)|quadrature]]. It included material discussed with Mersenne some years before, such as the fallacious nature of the squaring of the circle by Grégoire de Saint-Vincent. His preferred methods were those of [[Archimedes]] and Fermat.&lt;ref name="Dict470"/&gt; Quadrature was a live issue in the 1650s, and through Mylon, Huygens intervened in the discussion of the mathematics of [[Thomas Hobbes]]. Persisting in trying to explain the errors Hobbes had fallen into, he made an international reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Schoneveld, Cornelis W|title=Intertraffic of the Mind: Studies in Seventeenth-century Anglo-Dutch Translation with a Checklist of Books Translated from English Into Dutch, 1600–1700|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1s4UAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA41|accessdate=22 April 2013|date=1983|publisher=Brill Archive|isbn=978-90-04-06942-8|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:KettingHyugens.jpg|thumb|The [[catenary]] in a manuscript of Huygens.]]

Huygens studied [[spherical lens]]es from a theoretical point of view in 1652–3, obtaining results that remained unpublished until [[Isaac Barrow]] (1669). His aim was to understand [[telescope]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary, p. 472.&lt;/ref&gt; He began grinding his own lenses in 1655, collaborating with his brother Constantijn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert D.

They had rather different outlooks on science, Spinoza being the more committed Cartesian, and some of their discussion survives in correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Margaret Gullan-Whur |title=Within Reason: A Life of Spinoza |date=1998 |publisher=Jonathan Cape |isbn=0-224-05046-X |pages=170–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He encountered the work of [[Antoni van Leeuwenhoek]], another lens grinder, in the field of [[microscopy]] which interested his father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ivor Grattan-Guinness|title=Landmark Writings in Western Mathematics 1640–1940|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UdGBy8iLpocC&amp;pg=PA35|accessdate=27 April 2013|date=11 February 2005|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-045744-4|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huygens wrote the first treatise on [[probability theory]], ''De ratiociniis in ludo aleae'' ("On Reasoning in Games of Chance", 1657).&lt;ref&gt;p963-965, [[Jan Gullberg]], Mathematics from the birth of numbers, W.

On 3 May 1661, Huygens observed the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] transit over the Sun, using the telescope of instrument maker [[Richard Reeve]] in London, together with astronomer [[Thomas Streete]] and Reeve.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Louwman, Christiaan Huygens and his telescopes, Proceedings of the International Conference, 13 – 17 April 2004, ESTEC, Noordwijk, Netherlands, ESA, sp 1278, Paris 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Streete then debated the published record of the transit of [[Hevelius]], a controversy mediated by [[Henry Oldenburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Adrian Johns|title=The Nature of the Book: Print and Knowledge in the Making|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ERpBdEUdhz8C&amp;pg=PA437|accessdate=23 April 2013|date=15 May 2009|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-40123-2|pages=437–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huygens passed to Hevelius a manuscript of [[Jeremiah Horrocks]] on the [[transit of Venus, 1639]], which thereby was printed for the first time in 1662.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Venus Seen on the Sun: The First Observation of a Transit of Venus by Jeremiah Horrocks|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KlA6UCyOboUC&amp;pg=PR19|accessdate=23 April 2013|date=2 March 2012|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-22193-2|page=xix}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that year Huygens, who played the [[harpsichord]], took an interest in music, and [[Simon Stevin]]'s theories on it; he showed very little concern to publish his theories on [[consonance]], some of which were lost for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jozef T.

The [[Montmor Academy]] was the form the old Mersenne circle took after the mid-1650s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David J.

In 1678 he introduced [[Nicolaas Hartsoeker]] to French scientists such as [[Nicolas Malebranche]] and [[Giovanni Cassini]].

It was in Paris, also, that Huygens met the young diplomat [[Gottfried Leibniz]], there in 1672 on a vain mission to meet [[Arnauld de Pomponne]], the French Foreign Minister. At this time Leibniz was working on a [[calculating machine]], and he moved on to London in early 1673 with diplomats from [[Mainz]]; but from March 1673 Leibniz was tutored in mathematics by Huygens.&lt;ref name="Leibniz1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gottfried Wilhelm Freiherr von Leibniz|title=Leibniz: New Essays on Human Understanding|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vD6nSUSbL7IC&amp;pg=RA1-PR82|accessdate=23 April 2013|date=7 November 1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-57660-4|page=lxxxiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huygens taught him [[analytical geometry]]; an extensive correspondence ensued, in which Huygens showed reluctance to accept the advantages of [[infinitesimal calculus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Marcelo Dascal|title=The practice of reason|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4XhKkK9Ms70C&amp;pg=PA45|accessdate=23 April 2013|date=2010|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|isbn=978-90-272-1887-2|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Huygens moved back to [[The Hague]] in 1681 after suffering serious depressive illness. In 1684, he published ''Astroscopia Compendiaria'' on his new tubeless [[aerial telescope]]. He attempted to return to France in 1685 but the [[revocation of the Edict of Nantes]] precluded this move. His father died in 1687, and he inherited Hofwijck, which he made his home the following year.&lt;ref name="Dictionary, p. 469"/&gt;
[[File:Hofwijck westkant.JPG|thumb|right|[[Hofwijck]], home to Christiaan Huygens from 1688]]
On his third visit to England, in 1689, Huygens met [[Isaac Newton]] on 12 June. They spoke about [[Iceland spar]], and subsequently corresponded about resisted motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Alfred Rupert Hall]] |title=Isaac Newton: Adventurer in thought |date=1886 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-56669-X |page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huygens observed the acoustical phenomenon now known as [[flanging]] in 1693.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Curtis ROADS|title=The computer music tutorial|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nZ-TetwzVcIC&amp;pg=PA437|accessdate=11 May 2013|date=1996|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-68082-0|page=437}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died in The Hague on 8 July 1695, and was buried in the [[Grote Kerk, The Hague|Grote Kerk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grotekerkdenhaag.nl/ |title=GroteKerkDenHaag.nl |language=nl |publisher=GroteKerkDenHaag.nl |accessdate=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work in natural philosophy==
Huygens has been called the leading European natural philosopher between Descartes and Newton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anders Hald|title=A History of Probability and Statistics and Their Applications before 1750|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pOQy6-qnVx8C&amp;pg=PA123|accessdate=11 May 2013|date=25 February 2005|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-471-72517-6|page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; He adhered to the tenets of the [[mechanical philosophy]] of his time. In particular he sought explanations of the [[force of gravity]] that avoided [[action at a distance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William L. Harper|title=Isaac Newton's Scientific Method: Turning Data into Evidence about Gravity and Cosmology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oKGlHjDzGjQC&amp;pg=PA206|accessdate=23 April 2013|date=8 December 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-957040-9|pages=206–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In common with [[Robert Boyle]] and [[Jacques Rohault]], Huygens adhered to what has been called, more explicitly, "experimentally oriented corpuscular-mechanical" natural philosophy. In the analysis of the [[Scientific Revolution]] this appears as a mainstream position, at least from the founding of the Royal Society to the emergence of Newton, and was sometimes labelled "Baconian", while not being [[inductivist]] or identifying with the views of [[Francis Bacon]] in a simple-minded way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=R. C. Olby |author2=G. N. Cantor |author3=J. R. R. Christie |author4=M. J. S.

It proved a long process, brought to the surface an experimental issue ("anomalous suspension") and the theoretical issue of ''[[horror vacui (physics)|horror vacui]]'', and ended in July 1663 as Huygens became a Fellow of the Royal Society. It has been said that Huygens finally accepted Boyle's view of the void, as against the Cartesian denial of it;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David B. Wilson|title=Seeking nature's logic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=53w2gMknsMYC&amp;pg=PA19|accessdate=12 May 2013|date=1 January 2009|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=978-0-271-04616-7|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also (in ''[[Leviathan and the Air Pump]]'') that the [[replication of results]] trailed off messily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=[[Stephen Shapin]]|author2=[[Simon Schaffer]]|title=[[Leviathan and the Air Pump]]|date=1989 |publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-02432-4 |pages=235–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton's influence on [[John Locke]] was mediated by Huygens, who assured Locke that Newton's mathematics was sound, leading to Locke's acceptance of a "corpuscular-mechanical" physics.&lt;ref name="Redman1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Deborah Redman|title=The Rise of Political Economy As a Science: Methodology and the Classical Economists|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1faeMedY8k8C&amp;pg=PA62|accessdate=12 May 2013|date=1997|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-26425-9|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laws of motion, impact and gravitation===
The general approach of the mechanical philosophers was to postulate theories of the kind now called "contact action". Huygens adopted this method, but not without seeing its difficulties and failures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tian Yu Cao|title=Conceptual Developments of 20th Century Field Theories|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l4PtgYXpb_oC&amp;pg=PA25|accessdate=11 May 2013|date=14 May 1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-63420-5|pages=25–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leibniz, his student in Paris, abandoned the theory.&lt;ref&gt;Garber and Ayers, p. 595.&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing the universe this way made the theory of collisions central to physics. The requirements of the mechanical philosophy, in the view of Huygens, were stringent. Matter in motion made up the universe, and only explanations in those terms could be truly intelligible. While he was influenced by the [[Cartesianism|Cartesian]] approach, he was less doctrinaire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Dear|title=The Intelligibility of Nature: How Science Makes Sense of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W1GAG3vJHpgC&amp;pg=PA25|accessdate=23 April 2013|date=15 September 2008|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-13950-0|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied [[elastic collision]]s in the 1650s but delayed publication for over a decade.&lt;ref name="Dict470"/&gt;
[[File:Collision huygens.gif|thumb|Depiction from Huygens, ''Oeuvres Complètes'': a boating metaphor underlay the way of thinking about [[relative motion]], and so simplifying the theory of colliding bodies]]
Huygens concluded quite early that [[Cartesian laws of motion|Descartes's laws]] for the elastic collision of two bodies must be wrong, and he formulated the correct laws.&lt;ref&gt;''The Beginnings of Modern Science'', edited by Rene Taton, Basic Books, 1958, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; An important step was his recognition of the [[Galilean invariance]] of the problems.&lt;ref&gt;Garber and Ayers, pp. 666–7.&lt;/ref&gt; His views then took many years to be circulated. He passed them on in person to [[William Brouncker, 2nd Viscount Brouncker|William Brouncker]] and [[Christopher Wren]] in London, in 1661.&lt;ref&gt;Garber and Ayers, p. 689.&lt;/ref&gt; What Spinoza wrote to [[Henry Oldenburg]] about them, in 1666 which was during the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]], was guarded.&lt;ref name="Israel2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Jonathan I. Israel]]|title=Radical Enlightenment:Philosophy and the Making of Modernity 1650–1750|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vMvlEweVPTsC&amp;pg=RA3-PR62|accessdate=11 May 2013|date=8 February 2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-162287-8|pages=lxii–lxiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huygens had actually worked them out in a manuscript ''De motu corporum ex percussione'' in the period 1652–6. The war ended in 1667, and Huygens announced his results to the Royal Society in 1668. He published them in the ''[[Journal des sçavans]]'' in 1669.&lt;ref name="Dict470"/&gt;

Huygens stated what is now known as the second of  [[Newton's laws of motion]] in a quadratic form.&lt;ref name="mach"&gt;[[Ernst Mach]], ''The Science of Mechanics'' (1919), e.g. pp. 143, 172, 187 &lt;https://archive.org/details/scienceofmechani005860mbp&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1659 he derived the now standard formula for the [[centripetal force]], exerted on an object describing a [[circular motion]], for instance by the string to which it is attached. In modern notation:

:&lt;math&gt;F_{c}=\frac{m\ v^2}{r}&lt;/math&gt;

with ''m'' the [[mass (physics)|mass]] of the object, ''v'' the [[velocity]] and ''r'' the [[radius]]. The publication of the general formula for this force in 1673 was a significant step in studying orbits in astronomy. It enabled the transition from [[Kepler's third law]] of planetary motion, to the [[inverse square law]] of gravitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=J. B. Barbour|title=Absolute Or Relative Motion?: The discovery of dynamics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ekA9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA542|accessdate=23 April 2013|date=1989|publisher=CUP Archive|isbn=978-0-521-32467-0|page=542}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interpretation of Newton's work on gravitation by Huygens differed, however, from that of Newtonians such as [[Roger Cotes]]; he did not insist on the ''a priori'' attitude of Descartes, but neither would he accept aspects of gravitational attractions that were not attributable in principle to contact of particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=A.I. Sabra|title=Theories of light: from Descartes to Newton|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nB84AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA166|accessdate=23 April 2013|date=1981|publisher=CUP Archive|isbn=978-0-521-28436-3|pages=166–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The approach used by Huygens also missed some central notions of [[mathematical physics]], which were not lost on others. His work on pendulums came very close to the theory of [[simple harmonic motion]]; but the topic was covered fully for the first time by Newton, in Book II of his ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]'' (1687).&lt;ref name="Allen1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Allen|title=David Hartley on human nature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NCu6HhGlAB8C&amp;pg=PA98|accessdate=12 May 2013|date=1999|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-9451-6|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1678 Leibniz picked out of Huygens's work on collisions the idea of [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation law]] that Huygens had left implicit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicholas Jolley|title=The Cambridge Companion to Leibniz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SnRis5Gdi8gC&amp;pg=PA279|accessdate=12 May 2013|date=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-36769-1|page=279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Optics===
Huygens is remembered especially for his [[wave]] theory of light, which he first communicated in 1678 to the Paris Académie des sciences. It was published in 1690 in his ''[[Traité de la lumière]]''&lt;ref&gt;Christiaan Huygens, [https://books.google.com/books?id=X9PKaZlChggC&amp;pg=PP5 ''Traité de la lumiere''...] (Leiden, Netherlands: Pieter van der Aa, 1690), Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt; (Treatise on light&lt;ref name="HuyThomp1912"&gt;C. Huygens (1690), translated by Silvanus P. Thompson (1912), ''[https://archive.org/details/treatiseonlight031310mbp Treatise on Light]'', London: Macmillan, 1912; [http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14725 Project Gutenberg edition], 2005; [http://www.grputland.com/2016/06/errata-in-various-editions-of-huygens-treatise-on-light.html Errata], 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;), making it the first mathematical theory of light. He refers to [[Ignace-Gaston Pardies]], whose manuscript on optics helped him on his wave theory.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=X9PKaZlChggC&amp;pg=PP5 ''Traité de la lumiere''...] (Leiden, Netherlands: Pieter van der Aa, 1690), Chapter 1. From [https://books.google.com/books?id=X9PKaZlChggC&amp;pg=PA18 page 18]&lt;/ref&gt;

Huygens assumes that the [[speed of light]] is finite, as had been shown in an experiment by [[Ole Rømer|Olaus Roemer]] in 1679, but which Huygens is presumed to have already believed.&lt;ref name="Smith1987"&gt;{{cite book|author=A. Mark Smith|title=Descartes's Theory of Light and Refraction: A Discourse on Method|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ei8LAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA70|accessdate=11 May 2013|date=1987|publisher=American Philosophical Society|isbn=978-0-87169-773-8|page=70 with note 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The challenge for the wave theory of light at that time was to explain [[geometrical optics]], as most [[physical optics]] phenomena (such as [[diffraction]]) had not been observed or appreciated as issues. It posits light radiating [[wavefront]]s with the common notion of light rays depicting propagation normal to those wavefronts. Propagation of the wavefronts is then explained as the result of [[spherical wave]]s being emitted at every point along the wave front (the [[Huygens–Fresnel principle]]).&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; It assumed an omnipresent [[luminiferous aether|ether]], with transmission through perfectly elastic particles, a revision of the view of Descartes. The nature of light was therefore a [[longitudinal wave]].&lt;ref name="Smith1987"/&gt;

Huygens had experimented in 1672 with double refraction ([[birefringence]]) in Icelandic spar ([[calcite]]), a phenomenon discovered in 1669 by [[Rasmus Bartholin]]. At first he could not elucidate what he found.&lt;ref name="Dictionary" /&gt; He later explained it&lt;ref name="HuyThomp1912"/&gt; with his wave front theory and concept of [[evolute]]s. He also developed ideas on [[caustic (optics)|caustics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Ivor Grattan-Guinness]]|title=Landmark Writings in Western Mathematics 1640–1940|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UdGBy8iLpocC&amp;pg=PA43|accessdate=23 April 2013|date=11 February 2005|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-045744-4|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton in his ''[[Opticks]]'' of 1704 proposed instead a [[corpuscular theory of light]]. The theory of Huygens was not widely accepted, one strong objection being that longitudinal waves have only a single [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] which cannot explain the observed birefringence. However the 1801 [[Young's interference experiment|interference experiments]] of [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] and [[François Arago ]]'s 1819 detection of the [[Poisson spot]] could not be explained through any particle theory, reviving the ideas of Huygens and wave models. In 1821 [[Fresnel]] was able to explain birefringence as a result of light being not a longitudinal (as had been assumed) but actually a [[transverse wave]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Darryl J. Leiter|author2=Sharon Leiter|title=A to Z of Physicists|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yz1CFkrZ8QMC&amp;pg=PA108|accessdate=11 May 2013|date=1 January 2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-0922-0|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; The thus-named [[Huygens–Fresnel principle]] was the basis for the advancement of [[physical optics]], explaining all aspects of light propagation. It was only understanding the detailed interaction of light with [[atoms]] that awaited [[quantum mechanics]] and the discovery of the [[photon]].
 
Huygens investigated the use of lenses in projectors. He is credited as the inventor of the [[magic lantern]], described in correspondence of 1659.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jordan D. Marché|title=Theaters Of Time And Space: American Planetariums, 1930–1970|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=olT1ipj-EboC&amp;pg=PA11|accessdate=23 April 2013|date=2005|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-3576-0|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are others to whom such a lantern device has been attributed, such as [[Giambattista della Porta]], and [[Cornelis Drebbel]]: the point at issue is the use of a lens for better projection. [[Athanasius Kircher]] has also been credited for that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=C. D.

===Horology===

Huygens designed more accurate [[clock]]s than were available at the time.  In 1656, inspired by earlier research into [[pendulum]]s by [[Galileo Galilei]], he invented the [[pendulum clock]], which was a breakthrough in timekeeping and became the most accurate timekeeper for the next 275 years until the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Huygens motivation for inventing the pendulum clock was to create an accurate [[marine chronometer]] that could be used to find [[longitude]] by [[celestial navigation]] during sea voyages.  Exploiting the invention at sea proved troublesome, however, because the rocking motion of the ship disturbed the motion of the pendulum. In 1660 Lodewijk Huygens made a trial on a voyage to Spain, and reported that heavy weather made the clock useless. [[Alexander Bruce, 2nd Earl of Kincardine|Alexander Bruce]] elbowed into the field in 1662, and Huygens called in Sir Robert Moray and the Royal Society to mediate and preserve some of his rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joella G.

One for the French Academy on an expedition to [[Cayenne]] ended badly. [[Jean Richer]] suggested correction for the [[figure of the Earth]]. By the time of the [[Dutch East India Company]] expedition of 1686 to the [[Cape of Good Hope]], Huygens was able to supply the correction retrospectively.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary, p. 471.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1673 Huygens published ''[[Horologium Oscillatorium|Horologium Oscillatorium sive de motu pendulorum]]'', his major work on [[pendulum]]s and horology. It had been observed by Mersenne and others that pendulums are not quite [[isochronous]]: their period depends on their width of swing, with wide swings taking slightly longer than narrow swings.&lt;ref&gt;Marin Mersenne 1647  ''Reflectiones Physico-Mathematicae'', Paris, Chapter 19, cited in {{cite conference

Huygens analyzed this problem by finding the curve down which a mass will slide under the influence of gravity in the same amount of time, regardless of its starting point; the so-called [[tautochrone curve|tautochrone problem]]. By geometrical methods which were an early use of [[calculus]], he showed it to be a cycloid, rather than the circular arc of a pendulum's bob, and therefore that pendulums are not isochronous. He also solved a problem posed by Mersenne: how to calculate the period of a pendulum made of an arbitrarily shaped swinging rigid body. This involved discovering the [[center of oscillation]] and its reciprocal relationship with the pivot point. In the same work, he analysed the [[conical pendulum]], consisting of a weight on a cord moving in a circle, using the concept of centrifugal force.
[[File:H6 clock.jpg|thumb|Detail of illustration from ''Horologium Oscillatorium'' (1658), by Huygens]]
[[File:Christiaan Huygens - Clock - Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam - 2.JPG|thumb|Huygens clock, [[Rijksmuseum]], Amsterdam]]
Huygens was the first to derive the formula for the [[Frequency|period]] of an ideal mathematical pendulum (with massless rod or cord and length much longer than its swing), in modern notation:

:&lt;math&gt;T = 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}&lt;/math&gt;

with ''T'' the period, ''l'' the length of the pendulum and ''g'' the [[gravitational acceleration]]. By his study of the oscillation period of compound pendulums Huygens made pivotal contributions to the development of the concept of [[moment of inertia]].&lt;ref name="mach" /&gt;

Huygens also observed [[coupled oscillation]]s: two of his pendulum clocks mounted next to each other on the same support often became synchronized, swinging in opposite directions. He reported the results by letter to the Royal Society, and it is referred to as "[[odd sympathy|an odd kind of sympathy]]" in the Society's minutes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Birch]], "The History of the Royal Society of London, for Improving of Natural Knowledge, in which the most considerable of those papers...as a supplement to the Philosophical Transactions", vol 2, (1756) p 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A copy of the letter appears in C. Huygens, in Oeuvres Completes de Christian Huygens, edited by M. Nijhoff (Societe Hollandaise des Sciences, The Hague, The Netherlands, 1893), Vol. 5, p. 246 (in French).&lt;/ref&gt; This concept is now known as [[Entrainment (physics)|entrainment]].

[[File:Huygens synchronization of two clocks (Experiment).jpg|thumbnail|left|Experimental setup of Huygens synchronization of two clocks]]

====Balance spring watch====
Huygens developed a [[balance spring]] watch in the same period as, though independently of, [[Robert Hooke]]. Controversy over the priority persisted for centuries. A Huygens watch employed a spiral balance spring; but he used this form of spring initially only because the balance in his first watch rotated more than one and a half turns. He later used spiral springs in more conventional watches, made for him by [[Thuret family|Thuret]] in Paris from around 1675.

[[File:Huygens Systema Saturnium.jpg|thumb|left|Huygens' explanation for the aspects of Saturn, ''Systema Saturnium'', 1659.]]

Such springs were essential in modern watches with a detached [[lever escapement]] because they can be adjusted for [[isochronism]]. Watches in the time of Huygens and Hooke, however, employed the very undetached [[verge escapement]]. It interfered with the isochronal properties of any form of balance spring, spiral or otherwise.

In February 2006, a long-lost copy of Hooke's handwritten notes from several decades of [[Royal Society]] meetings was discovered in a cupboard in [[Hampshire]], England. The balance-spring priority controversy appears, by the evidence contained in those notes, to be settled in favour of Hooke's claim.&lt;ref&gt;Nature – International Weekly Journal of Science, number 439, pages 638–639, 9 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Notes and Records of the Royal Society (2006) 60, pages 235–239, 'Report – The Return of the Hooke Folio' by Robyn Adams and Lisa Jardine&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1675, Huygens patented a [[pocket watch]]. The watches which were made in Paris from c. 1675 and following the Huygens plan are notable for lacking a [[fusee (horology)|fusee]] for equalizing the mainspring torque. The implication is that Huygens thought that his spiral spring would isochronise the balance, in the same way that he thought that the cycloidally shaped suspension curbs on his clocks would isochronise the pendulum.

===Astronomy===

====Saturn's rings and Titan====
In 1655, Huygens proposed that [[Saturn]] was surrounded by a solid ring, "a thin, flat ring, nowhere touching, and inclined to the ecliptic." Using a 50 power [[refracting telescope]] that he designed himself, Huygens also discovered the first of Saturn's moons, [[Titan (moon)|Titan]].&lt;ref&gt;Ron Baalke, [http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/saturn/back.html Historical Background of Saturn's Rings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321071339/http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/saturn/back.html |date=21 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year he observed and sketched the [[Orion Nebula]]. His drawing, the first such known of the Orion nebula, was published in ''Systema Saturnium'' in 1659. Using his modern telescope he succeeded in subdividing the nebula into different stars. The brighter interior now bears the name of the ''Huygenian region'' in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Antony Cooke|title=Visual Astronomy Under Dark Skies: A New Approach to Observing Deep Space|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T64M5qlZTxoC&amp;pg=PA67|accessdate=24 April 2013|date=1 January 2005|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-84628-149-5|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also discovered several [[nebula|interstellar nebulae]] and some [[double star]]s.

====Mars and Syrtis Major====
In 1659, Huygens was the first to observe a surface feature on another planet, [[Syrtis Major Planum|Syrtis Major]], a volcanic plain on [[Mars]].  He used repeated observations of the movement of this feature over the course of a number of days to estimate the length of day on Mars, which he did quite accurately to 24 1/2 hours.  This figure is only a few minutes off of the actual length of the Martian day of 24 hours, 37 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marsdaily.com/reports/A_dark_spot_on_Mars_Syrtis_Major_999.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Cosmotheoros''====
Shortly before his death in 1695, Huygens completed ''Cosmotheoros'', published posthumously in 1698. In it he speculated on the existence of [[extraterrestrial life]], on other planets, which he imagined was similar to that on Earth. Such speculations were not uncommon at the time, justified by [[Copernicanism]] or the [[plenitude principle]]. But Huygens went into greater detail,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Philip C. Almond|title=Adam and Eve in Seventeenth-Century Thought|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rx1el1IsopEC&amp;pg=PA61|accessdate=24 April 2013|date=27 November 2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-09084-1|pages=61–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; though without the benefit of understanding Newton's laws of gravitation, or the fact that the atmospheres on other planets are composed of different gases.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/shows/engines-of-our-ingenuity/engines-podcast/2017/04/05/194011/engines-of-our-ingenuity-1329-life-in-outer-space-in-1698/&lt;/ref&gt; The work, translated into English in its year of publication, has been seen as in the fanciful tradition of [[Francis Godwin]], [[John Wilkins]] and [[Cyrano de Bergerac]], and fundamentally [[Utopian]]; and also to owe in its concept of [[planet]] to [[cosmography]] in the sense of [[Peter Heylin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Postmus |first=Bouwe |chapter=Plokhoy's ''A way pronouned'': Mennonite Utopia or Millennium? |editors=Dominic Baker-Smith and Cedric Charles Barfoot|title=Between dream and nature: essays on utopia and dystopia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-bTyK6Yri4UC&amp;pg=PA86|accessdate=24 April 2013|date=1987|location=Amsterdam |publisher=Rodopi|isbn=978-90-6203-959-3|pages=86–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Juliet Cummins|author2=David Burchell|title=Science, Literature, and Rhetoric in Early Modern England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LdL8iy4-OwQC&amp;pg=PA194|accessdate=24 April 2013|date=2007|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-5781-1|pages=194–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huygens wrote that availability of water in liquid form was essential for life and that the properties of water must vary from planet to planet to suit the temperature range. He took his observations of dark and bright spots on the surfaces of Mars and Jupiter to be evidence of water and ice on those planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brighthub.com/science/space/articles/50441.aspx |title=Johar Huzefa (2009) Nothing But The Facts – Christiaan Huygens |publisher=Brighthub.com |date=28 September 2009 |accessdate=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that extraterrestrial life is neither confirmed nor denied by the Bible, and questioned why God would create the other planets if they were not to serve a greater purpose than that of being admired from Earth. Huygens postulated that the great distance between the planets signified that God had not intended for beings on one to know about the beings on the others, and had not foreseen how much humans would advance in scientific knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacob|first=Margaret|title=The Scientific Revolution|date=2010|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|location=Boston|pages=29, 107–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also in this book that Huygens published his method for estimating [[stellar distance]]s. He made a series of smaller holes in a screen facing the sun, until he estimated the light was of the same intensity as that of the star [[Sirius]]. He then calculated that the angle of this hole was &lt;math&gt;1/27,664&lt;/math&gt;th the diameter of the Sun, and thus it was about 30,000 times as far away, on the (incorrect) assumption that Sirius is as luminous as our sun. The subject of [[photometry (astronomy)|photometry]] remained in its infancy until the time of [[Pierre Bouguer]] and [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]].&lt;ref name="Mccormmach2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Russell Mccormmach|title=Weighing the World: The Reverend John Michell of Thornhill|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9eMkgfKIdXIC&amp;pg=PA129|accessdate=12 May 2013|date=2012|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-94-007-2022-0|pages=129–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2359">In [[control theory]], a '''controlled invariant subspace''' of the [[state space representation]] of some system is a [[Euclidean subspace|subspace]] such that, if the state of the system is initially in the subspace, it is possible to control the system so that the state is in the subspace at all times. This concept was introduced by Giuseppe Basile and Giovanni Marro {{harv|Basile|Marro|1969}}.

== Definition ==
Consider a linear system described by the differential equation
:&lt;math&gt; \dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = A\mathbf{x}(t) + B\mathbf{u}(t). &lt;/math&gt;
Here, '''x'''(''t'') &amp;isin; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; denotes the state of the system and '''u'''(''t'') &amp;isin; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; is the input. The matrices ''A'' and ''B'' have size ''n'' &amp;times; ''n'' and ''n'' &amp;times; ''p'' respectively.

A subspace ''V'' &amp;sub; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is a ''controlled invariant subspace'' if for any '''x'''(0) &amp;isin; ''V'', there is an input '''u'''(''t'') such that '''x'''(''t'') &amp;isin; ''V'' for all nonnegative ''t''.

== Properties ==
A subspace ''V'' &amp;sub; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is a controlled invariant subspace if and only if ''AV'' &amp;sub; ''V'' + Im ''B''. If ''V'' is a controlled invariant subspace, then there exists a matrix ''K'' such that the input '''u'''(''t'') = ''K'''''x'''(''t'') keeps the state within ''V''; this is a simple feedback control {{harv|Ghosh|1985|loc=Thm&amp;nbsp;1.1}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5271">In [[mathematics]] and [[quantum mechanics]], a '''Dirac operator''' is a [[differential operator]] that is a formal square root, or [[half-iterate]], of a second-order operator such as a [[Laplacian]]. The original case which concerned [[Paul Dirac]] was to factorise formally an operator for [[Minkowski space]], to get a form of quantum theory compatible with [[special relativity]]; to get the relevant Laplacian as a product of first-order operators he introduced [[spinor]]s. 

==Formal definition==

In general, let ''D'' be a first-order differential operator acting on a [[vector bundle]] ''V'' over a [[Riemannian manifold]] ''M''. If 
:&lt;math&gt;D^2=\Delta, \,&lt;/math&gt;
where ∆ is the Laplacian of ''V'', then ''D'' is called a '''Dirac operator'''.

In [[high-energy physics]], this requirement is often relaxed: only the second-order part of ''D''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; must equal the Laplacian.

==Examples==
'''Example 1:''' ''D'' = −''i'' ∂&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; is a Dirac operator on the tangent bundle over a line.

'''Example 2:''' We now consider a simple bundle of importance in physics: The configuration space of a particle with spin {{sfrac|1|2}} confined to a plane, which is also the base manifold.  It is represented by a wavefunction {{nowrap|''ψ''  : '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; → '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}
::&lt;math&gt;\psi(x,y) = \begin{bmatrix}\chi(x,y) \\ \eta(x,y)\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''x'' and ''y'' are the usual coordinate functions on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. ''χ'' specifies the [[probability amplitude]] for the particle to be in the spin-up state, and similarly for ''η''. The so-called [[spin-Dirac operator]] can then be written
::&lt;math&gt;D=-i\sigma_x\partial_x-i\sigma_y\partial_y ,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are the [[Pauli matrices]]. Note that the anticommutation relations for the Pauli matrices make the proof of the above defining property trivial. Those relations define the notion of a [[Clifford algebra]].

Solutions to the Dirac equation for spinor fields are often called ''harmonic spinors''.&lt;ref&gt;http://eom.springer.de/S/s086780.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Example 3:''' Feynman's Dirac operator{{which|date=September 2016}} describes the propagation of a free [[fermion]] in three dimensions and is elegantly written 
::&lt;math&gt;D=\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu\ \equiv \partial\!\!\!/,&lt;/math&gt;
using the [[Feynman slash notation]].

'''Example 4:''' Another Dirac operator{{which|date=September 2016}} arises in [[Clifford analysis]]. In euclidean ''n''-space this is
::&lt;math&gt;D=\sum_{j=1}^{n}e_{j}\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{j}}&lt;/math&gt;
where {''e&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'': ''j'' = 1, ..., ''n''} is an orthonormal basis for euclidean ''n''-space, and '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is considered to be embedded in a [[Clifford algebra]]. 

This is a special case of the [[Atiyah–Singer–Dirac operator]] acting on sections of a [[spinor bundle]].

'''Example 5:''' For a [[spin manifold]], ''M'', the Atiyah–Singer–Dirac operator is locally defined as follows: For {{nowrap|''x'' ∈ ''M''}} and ''e&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x''), ..., ''e&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'') a local orthonormal basis for the tangent space of ''M'' at ''x'', the Atiyah–Singer–Dirac operator is
::&lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=1}^{n}e_{j}(x)\tilde{\Gamma}_{e_{j}(x)} ,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\Gamma}&lt;/math&gt; is a lifting of the [[Levi-Civita connection]] on ''M'' to the [[spinor bundle]] over ''M''.

== Generalisations ==
In Clifford analysis, the operator {{nowrap|''D'' : ''C''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; ⊗ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, ''S'') → ''C''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; ⊗ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; ⊗ ''S'')}} acting on spinor valued functions defined by 
:&lt;math&gt;f(x_1,\ldots,x_k)\mapsto
\begin{pmatrix}
\partial_{\underline{x_1}}f\\
\partial_{\underline{x_2}}f\\
\ldots\\
\partial_{\underline{x_k}}f\\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
is sometimes called Dirac operator in ''k'' Clifford variables. In the notation, ''S'' is the space of spinors, &lt;math&gt;x_i=(x_{i1},x_{i2},\ldots,x_{in})&lt;/math&gt; are ''n''-dimensional variables and &lt;math&gt;\partial_{\underline{x_i}}=\sum_j e_j\cdot \partial_{x_{ij}}&lt;/math&gt; is the Dirac operator in the ''i''-th variable. This is a common generalization of the Dirac operator ({{nowrap|1=''k'' = 1}}) and the [[Dolbeault cohomology|Dolbeault operator]] ({{nowrap|1=''n'' = 2}}, ''k'' arbitrary). It is an [[invariant differential operator]], invariant under the action of the group {{nowrap|SL(''k'') × Spin(''n'')}}. The [[injective_resolution#Injective_resolutions|resolution]] of ''D'' is known only in some special cases.

Robinson goes on to provide a specific double recursive function (originally defined by [[Rózsa Péter]])
* ''G''(0,&amp;nbsp;''x'') = ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1
* ''G''(''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;0) = ''G''(''n'',&amp;nbsp;1)
* ''G''(''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) = ''G''(''n'',&amp;nbsp;''G''(''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;''x''))
where the ''given functions'' are primitive recursive, but ''G'' is not primitive recursive. In fact, this is precisely the function now known as the [[Ackermann function]].

Dynamic secrets can be applied to all bi-directional communication systems and some single-directional communication systems to improve their [[communication security]]. There are three main benefits:

'''1.''' the [[encryption]] and [[authentication]] keys are rapidly and automatically updated for any pair of communication devices

'''2.''' the key update process binds to the communication process and incurs negligible computing and bandwidth cost

'''3.''' Use a cloned key in either authentication or encrypted communication is guaranteed to be detected. the detection has no false alarms and does not cost any computing / networking resources. (dynamic secrets automatically break the secure communication when the clone key and the legitimate key co-exist. however, in order to find out who is the attacker, it takes further actions and consumes computing power and network bandwidth.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14562">[[File:Ear decomposition.png|thumb|An example of an ear decomposition of a graph containing 3 ears.]]
In [[graph theory]], an '''ear''' of an [[undirected graph]] ''G'' is a [[path (graph theory)|path]] ''P'' where the two endpoints of the path may coincide, but where otherwise no repetition of edges or vertices is allowed, so every internal vertex of ''P'' has [[degree (graph theory)|degree]] two in ''P''. An '''ear decomposition''' of an undirected graph ''G'' is a [[Partition of a set|partition]] of its set of edges into a sequence of ears, such that the one or two endpoints of each ear belong to earlier ears in the sequence and such that the internal vertices of each ear do not belong to any earlier ear. Additionally, in most cases the first ear in the sequence must be a cycle. An '''open ear decomposition''' or a '''proper ear decomposition''' is an ear decomposition in which the two endpoints of each ear after the first are distinct from each other.

Ear decompositions may be used to characterize several important graph classes, and as part of efficient [[graph algorithm]]s. They may also be generalized from graphs to [[matroid]]s.

==Characterizing graph classes==
Several important classes of graphs may be characterized as the graphs having certain types of ear decompositions.

===Graph connectivity===
A graph is [[k-vertex-connected graph|''k''-vertex-connected]] if the removal of any (''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1) vertices leaves a connected subgraph, and [[k-edge-connected graph|''k''-edge-connected]] if the removal of any (''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1) edges leaves a connected subgraph.

The following result is due to {{harvs|first=Hassler|last=Whitney|authorlink=Hassler Whitney|year=1932|txt}}:
:A graph &lt;math&gt; G=(V,E)  &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; |E|\geq 2 &lt;/math&gt; is 2-vertex-connected if and only if it has an open ear decomposition.

The following result is due to {{harvs|first=Herbert|last=Robbins|authorlink=Herbert Robbins|year=1939|txt}}:
:A graph is 2-edge-connected if and only if it has an ear decomposition.

In both cases the number of ears is necessarily equal to the [[circuit rank]] of the given graph. Robbins introduced the ear decomposition of 2-edge-connected graphs as a tool for proving the [[Robbins theorem]], that these are exactly the graphs that may be given a [[strongly connected]] orientation. Because of the pioneering work of Whitney and Robbins on ear decompositions, an ear decomposition is sometimes also called a '''Whitney–Robbins synthesis''' {{harv|Gross|Yellen|2006}}.

A '''non-separating ear decomposition''' is an open ear decomposition such that, for each vertex ''v'' with only one exception, ''v'' has a neighbor whose first appearance in the decomposition is in a later ear than the first appearance of ''v''. This type of ear decomposition may be used to generalize Whitney's result:
:A graph &lt;math&gt; G=(V,E)  &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; |V|\geq 2 &lt;/math&gt; is 3-vertex-connected if and only if ''G'' has a non-separating ear decomposition.
If such a decomposition exists, it can be chosen with respect to a particular edge ''uv'' of ''G'' in such a way that ''u'' is in the first ear, ''v'' is the new vertex in the last ear with more than one edge, and ''uv'' is a single-edge ear.
This result was first stated explicitly by {{harvtxt|Cheriyan|Maheshwari|1988}}, but as {{harvtxt|Schmidt|2013b}} describes, it is equivalent to a result in the 1971 Ph.D. thesis of Lee Mondshein. Structures closely related to non-separating ear decompositions of maximal planar graphs, called canonical orderings, are also a standard tool in [[graph drawing]].

===Strong connectivity of directed graphs===
The above definitions can also be applied to [[directed graph]]s. An '''ear''' would then be  a directed path where all internal vertices have [[indegree]] and [[outdegree]] equal to 1. A directed graph is [[strongly connected]] if it contains a directed path from every vertex to every other vertex. Then we have the following theorem:
:A directed graph is strongly connected if and only if it has an ear decomposition.
Similarly, a directed graph is [[biconnected graph|biconnected]] if, for every two vertices, there exists a simple cycle in the graph containing both of them. Then
:A directed graph is biconnected if and only if it has an open ear decomposition.

===Factor-critical graphs===
An ear decomposition is ''odd'' if each of its ears uses an odd number of edges. A [[factor-critical graph]] is a graph with an odd number of vertices, such that for each vertex ''v'', if ''v'' is removed from the graph then the remaining vertices have a [[perfect matching]]. {{harvs|first=László|last=Lovász|authorlink=László Lovász|year=1972|txt}} found that:
:A graph ''G'' is factor-critical if and only if ''G'' has an odd ear decomposition.
More generally, a result of {{harvtxt|Frank|1993}} makes it possible to find in any graph ''G'' the ear decomposition with the fewest even ears.

===Series-parallel graphs===
A ''tree'' ear decomposition is a proper ear decomposition in which the first ear is a single edge and for each subsequent ear &lt;math&gt; P_i &lt;/math&gt;, there is a single ear &lt;math&gt; P_j &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; i&gt;j &lt;/math&gt;, such that both endpoints of &lt;math&gt; P_i &lt;/math&gt; lie on &lt;math&gt; P_j &lt;/math&gt; {{harv|Khuller|1989}}. A ''nested'' ear decomposition is a tree ear decomposition such that, within each ear &lt;math&gt; P_j &lt;/math&gt;, the set of pairs of endpoints of other ears &lt;math&gt; P_i &lt;/math&gt; that lie within &lt;math&gt; P_j &lt;/math&gt; form a set of nested intervals. A [[series-parallel graph]] is a graph with two designated terminals ''s'' and ''t'' that can be formed recursively by combining smaller series-parallel graphs in one of two ways: series composition (identifying one terminal from one smaller graph with one terminal from the other smaller graph, and keeping the other two terminals as the terminals of the combined graph) and parallel composition (identifying both pairs of terminals from the two smaller graphs).

The following result is due to {{harvs|first=David|last=Eppstein|authorlink=David Eppstein|year=1992|txt}}:
:A 2-vertex-connected graph is series-parallel if and only if it has a nested ear decomposition.
Moreover, any open ear decomposition of a 2-vertex-connected series-parallel graph must be nested. The result may be extended to series-parallel graphs that are not 2-vertex-connected by using open ear decompositions that start with a path between the two terminals.

==Matroids==
The concept of an ear decomposition can be extended from graphs to [[matroid]]s. An ear decomposition of a matroid is defined to be a sequence of circuits of the matroid, with two properties:
*each circuit in the sequence has a nonempty intersection with the previous circuits, and
*each circuit in the sequence remains a circuit even if all previous circuits in the sequence are contracted.
When applied to the [[graphic matroid]] of a graph ''G'', this definition of an ear decomposition coincides with the definition of a proper ear decomposition of ''G'': improper decompositions are excluded by the requirement that each circuit include at least one edge that also belongs to previous circuits. Using this definition, a matroid may be defined as factor-critical when it has an ear decomposition in which each circuit in the sequence has an odd number of new elements {{harv|Szegedy|Szegedy|2006}}.

==Algorithms==

On classical computers, ear decompositions of 2-edge-connected graphs and open ear decompositions of 2-vertex-connected graphs may be found by [[greedy algorithms]] that find each ear one at a time. A simple greedy approach that computes at the same time ear decompositions, open ear decompositions, st-numberings and -orientations in linear time (if exist) is given in {{harvtxt|Schmidt|2013a}}. The approach is based on computing a special ear decomposition named [[chain decomposition]] by one path-generating rule. {{harvtxt|Schmidt|2013b}} shows that non-separating ear decompositions may also be constructed in linear time.

{{harvtxt|Lovász|1985}}, {{harvtxt|Maon|Schieber|Vishkin|1986}}, and {{harvtxt|Miller|Ramachandran|1986}} provided efficient [[parallel algorithm]]s for constructing ear decompositions of various types. For instance, to find an ear decomposition of a 2-edge-connected graph, the algorithm of {{harvtxt|Maon|Schieber|Vishkin|1986}} proceeds according to the following steps:
# Find a [[spanning tree]] of the given graph and choose a root for the tree.
# Determine, for each edge ''uv'' that is not part of the tree, the distance between the root and the [[lowest common ancestor]] of ''u'' and ''v''.
# For each edge ''uv'' that is part of the tree, find the corresponding "master edge", a non-tree edge ''wx'' such that the cycle formed by adding ''wx'' to the tree passes through ''uv'' and such that, among such edges, ''w'' and ''x'' have a lowest common ancestor that is as close to the root as possible (with ties broken by edge identifiers).
# Form an ear for each non-tree edge, consisting of it and the tree edges for which it is the master, and order the ears by their master edges' distance from the root (with the same tie-breaking rule).
These algorithms may be used as subroutines for other problems including testing connectivity, recognizing series-parallel graphs, and constructing ''st''-numberings of graphs (an important subroutine in [[planarity testing]]).

An ear decomposition of a given matroid, with the additional constraint that every ear contains the same fixed element of the matroid, may be found in [[polynomial time]] given access to an [[matroid oracle|independence oracle]] for the matroid {{harv|Coullard|Hellerstein|1996}}.

'''Emanuel Lasker''' (December 24, 1868 – January 11, 1941) was a German [[chess]] player, [[mathematician]], and [[Philosophy|philosopher]] who was [[World Chess Championship|World Chess Champion]] for 27 years (from 1894 to 1921). In his prime, Lasker was one of the most dominant champions, and he is still generally regarded as one of the [[Comparison of top chess players throughout history|strongest players ever]].

His contemporaries used to say that Lasker used a "psychological" approach to the game, and even that he sometimes deliberately played inferior moves to confuse opponents. Recent analysis, however, indicates that he was ahead of his time and used a more flexible approach than his contemporaries, which mystified many of them. Lasker knew contemporary analyses of openings well but disagreed with many of them. He published chess magazines and five chess books, but later players and commentators found it difficult to draw lessons from his methods.

Lasker made contributions to the development of other games. He was a first-class [[contract bridge]] player&lt;ref name="Laskeratbridge"&gt;A detailed examination of Emanuel Lasker’s involvement in bridge is provided by the chapter ''Nicht nur Schach Emanuel Lasker als Bridgespieler'' by Robert van de Velde on pages 332-363 of ''Emanuel Lasker Denker Weltenbürger Schachweltmeister'' edited by Richard Forster, Stefan Hansen and Michael Negele (Berlin, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote about bridge, [[Go (game)|Go]], and his own invention, [[Lasca]]. His books about games presented a problem that is still considered notable in the [[Mathematical game|mathematical analysis of card games]]. Lasker was also a research mathematician who was known for his contributions to [[commutative algebra]], which included proving the [[Lasker–Noether theorem|primary decomposition]] of the [[ideal of a ring|ideal]]s of [[polynomial ring]]s. His philosophical works and a [[drama]] that he co-wrote, however, received little attention.

== Life and career ==

=== Early years 1868–1894 ===

Emanuel Lasker was born on December 24, 1868 at [[Berlinchen]] in [[Neumark]] (now [[Barlinek]] in [[Poland]]), the son of a [[Hazzan|Jewish cantor]]. At the age of eleven he was sent to Berlin to study mathematics, where he lived with his brother [[Berthold Lasker|Berthold]], eight years his senior, who taught him how to play chess. According to the website [[Chessmetrics]], Berthold was among the world's top ten players in the early 1890s.&lt;ref name="chessmetricsProfileBertholdLasker"&gt;{{cite web

Lasker shot up through the chess rankings in 1889, when he won the Café Kaiserhof's annual Winter tournament 1888/89 and the ''Hauptturnier A'' ("second division" tournament) at the sixth [[DSB Congress|DSB&amp;nbsp;Congress]] (German Chess Federation's congress) held in [[Breslau]]. Winning the Hauptturnier earned Lasker the title of "master".  The candidates were divided into two groups of ten. The top four in each group competed in a final. Lasker won his section, with 2½ points more than his nearest rival. However, scores were reset to 0 for the final. With two rounds to go, Lasker trailed the leader, Viennese amateur von Feierfeil, by 1½ points. Lasker won both of his final games, while von Feierfeil lost in the penultimate round (being mated in 121 moves after the position was reconstructed incorrectly following an adjournment) and drew in the last round. The two players were now tied. Lasker won a playoff and garnered the master title. This enabled him to play in master-level tournaments and thus launched his chess career.&lt;ref&gt;"The Start of a Chess Career", from ''Lasker &amp; His Contemporaries'', issue 1, published by Thinkers Press, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lasker finished second in an international tournament at [[Amsterdam]], ahead of some well-known masters, including [[Isidore Gunsberg]] (assessed as the second strongest player in the world at that time by Chessmetrics).&lt;ref name="UXLEncyclopediaBiography"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1892 Lasker founded the first of his chess magazines, ''The London Chess Fortnightly'', which was published from August 15, 1892 to July 30, 1893. In the second quarter of 1893 there was a gap of ten weeks between issues, allegedly because of problems with the printer.&lt;ref name="LondonChessFortnightly"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after its last issue Lasker traveled to the US, where he spent the next two years.&lt;ref name="BillWallEmLasker"/&gt;

Lasker challenged [[Siegbert Tarrasch]], who had won three consecutive strong international tournaments ([[Breslau]] 1889, [[Manchester]] 1890, and [[Dresden]] 1892), to a match. Tarrasch haughtily declined, stating that Lasker should first prove his mettle by attempting to win one or two major international events.&lt;ref name="Hannakp.31"&gt;{{cite book

==== Matches against Steinitz ====
[[Image:Wilhelm Steinitz2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Wilhelm Steinitz]], whom Lasker beat in World Championship matches in 1894 and 1896]]
Rebuffed by Tarrasch, Lasker challenged the reigning World Champion [[Wilhelm Steinitz]] to a match for the title.&lt;ref name="Hannakp.31"/&gt; Initially Lasker wanted to play for US $5,000 a side and a match was agreed at stakes of $3,000 a side, but Steinitz agreed to a series of reductions when Lasker found it difficult to raise the money. The final figure was $2,000, which was less than for some of Steinitz' earlier matches (the final combined stake of $4,000 would be worth over $495,000 at 2006 values&lt;ref&gt;Using incomes for the adjustment factor, as the outcome depended on a few months' hard work by the players; if prices are used for the conversion, the result is over $99,000—see {{cite web

}} However, Lasker later published an analysis showing that the winning player got $1,600 and the losing player $600 out of the $4,000, as the backers who had bet on the winner got the rest: {{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The match was played in 1894, at venues in New York, [[Philadelphia]], and [[Montreal]]. Steinitz had previously declared he would win without doubt, so it came as a shock when Lasker won the first game. Steinitz responded by winning the second, and maintained the balance through the sixth. However, Lasker won all the games from the seventh to the eleventh, and Steinitz asked for a week's rest. When the match resumed, Steinitz looked in better shape and won the 13th and 14th games. Lasker struck back in the 15th and 16th, and Steinitz did not compensate for his losses in the middle of the match. Hence Lasker [[World Chess Championship 1894|won convincingly]] with ten wins, five losses and four [[draw (chess)|draws]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Influential players and journalists belittled the 1894 match both before and after it took place. Lasker's difficulty in getting backing may have been caused by hostile pre-match comments from Gunsberg and [[Leopold Hoffer]],&lt;ref name="NYTimes1894PreSteinitzLasker"/&gt; who had long been a bitter enemy of Steinitz.&lt;ref name="WinterKKSCotch"&gt;{{cite web

Emanuel Lasker answered these criticisms by creating an even more impressive playing record. Before [[World War I]] broke out, his most serious "setbacks" were third place at [[Hastings 1895 chess tournament|Hastings 1895]] (where he may have been suffering from the after-effects of [[typhoid fever]]&lt;ref name="UXLEncyclopediaBiography"/&gt;), a tie for second at [[1904 Cambridge Springs International Chess Congress|Cambridge Springs 1904]], and a tie for first at the [[Chigorin Memorial]] in [[St Petersburg]] 1909.&lt;ref name="Fine1952WorldsGreatChessGamesEmLasker"&gt;{{cite book

==== Matches against Marshall and Tarrasch ====
{{main|World Chess Championship 1907|World Chess Championship 1908}}
Lasker's match record was as impressive between his 1896–97 re-match with Steinitz and 1914: he won all but one of his normal matches, and three of those were convincing defenses of his title. He first faced Marshall in the [[World Chess Championship 1907]], when despite his aggressive style, Marshall could not win a single game, losing eight and drawing seven (final score: 11½−3½).&lt;ref name="Giffard396"&gt;Giffard, p.396&lt;/ref&gt;

He then played Tarrasch in the [[World Chess Championship 1908]], first at [[Düsseldorf]] then at [[Munich]]. Tarrasch firmly believed the game of chess was governed by a precise set of principles.&lt;ref name="Giffard396"/&gt; For him the strength of a chess move was in its logic, not in its efficiency. Because of his stubborn principles he considered Lasker as a {{chessgloss|coffeehouse|coffeehouse player}} who won his games only thanks to dubious tricks, while Lasker mocked the arrogance of Tarrasch who, in his opinion, shone more in [[Salon (gathering)|salons]] than at the chessboard. At the opening ceremony, Tarrasch refused to talk to Lasker, only saying: "Mr. Lasker, I have only three words to say to you: check and mate!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Lasker gave a brilliant answer on the chessboard, winning four of the first five games, and playing a type of chess Tarrasch could not understand. For example, in the second game after 19 moves arose a situation (see diagram) in which Lasker was a [[pawn (chess)|pawn]] down, with a {{chessgloss|bad bishop}} and {{chessgloss|doubled pawns}}. At this point it appeared Tarrasch was winning, but 20 moves later he was forced to [[resign (chess)|resign]].&lt;ref name="Giffard398"&gt;Giffard, p.398&lt;/ref&gt; Lasker eventually won by 10½−5½ (eight wins, five draws, and three losses).

Several months later they played a longer match in Paris, and chess historians still debate whether this was for the World Chess Championship.&lt;ref&gt;Several authors have considered this match as a World Chess Championship, for instance:

Lasker easily won the match 8–2 (seven wins, two draws, one loss).&lt;ref name="Giffard400"&gt;{{cite book

Lasker accepted and they played a [[World Chess Championship 1910 (Lasker–Janowski)|World Chess Championship match]] in Berlin in November–December 1910. Lasker crushed his opponent, winning 9½−1½ (eight wins, three draws, no losses).&lt;ref name="storiascacchiMatches1900Al1914"/&gt; Janowski did not understand Lasker's moves, and after his first three losses he declared to [[Edward Lasker]], "Your [[homonym]] plays so stupidly that I cannot even look at the chessboard when he thinks. I am afraid I will not do anything good in this match."&lt;ref name="Giffard400"/&gt;

==== Match against Schlechter ====
{{main|World Chess Championship 1910 (Lasker–Schlechter)}}
[[Image:Carl Schlechter (profile).png|thumb|upright|Schlechter would have taken Lasker's world title if he had won or drawn the last game of their 1910 match.]]
Between his two matches against Janowski, Lasker arranged another [[World Chess Championship 1910 (Lasker–Schlechter)|World Chess Championship]] in January–February 1910 against [[Carl Schlechter]]. Schlechter was a modest gentleman, who was generally unlikely to win the major chess tournaments by his peaceful inclination, his lack of aggressiveness and his willingness to accept most [[draw (chess)|draw]] [[draw by agreement|offers]] from his opponents (about 80% of his games finished by a draw).&lt;ref name="Giffard404"&gt;Giffard 1993, p. 404&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Isaak and Vladimir Linder, the match was originally to be a 30 game affair and Schlecter would have to win by a two game margin. They note that the Austrian chess historian Micheal Ehn has established, based on the Viennese sources, that Lasker agreed to forgo the plus two provision in view of the match being subsequently reduced to only 10 games. For proof Ehn quoted Schlechter's comment printed in Allgemeine Sportzeitung (ASZ) of December 9, 1909 "There will be ten games in all. The winner on points will receive the title of world champion. If the points are equal, the decision will be made by the arbiter."

&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning, Lasker tried to attack but Schlechter had no difficulty defending, so that the first four games finished in draws. In the fifth game Lasker had a big advantage, but committed a blunder that cost him the game. Hence at the middle of the match Schlechter was one point ahead. The next four games were drawn, despite fierce play from both players. In the sixth Schlechter managed to draw a game being a pawn down. In the seventh Lasker nearly lost because of a beautiful [[The exchange (chess)#The exchange sacrifice|exchange sacrifice]] from Schlechter. In the ninth only a blunder from Lasker allowed Schlechter to draw a lost [[chess endgame|ending]]. The score before the last game was thus 5–4 for Schlechter. In the tenth game Schlechter tried to win tactically and took a big advantage, but he missed a clear win at the 35th move, continued to take increasing risks and finished by losing.&lt;ref name="Giffard406"&gt;Giffard 1993, p. 406&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the match was a draw and Lasker remained World Champion.

==== Abandoned challenges ====
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Capablanca3.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[José Raúl Capablanca]] won the world title from Lasker in 1921]] --&gt;
In 1911 Lasker received a challenge for a world title match against the rising star [[José Raúl Capablanca]]. Lasker was unwilling to play the traditional "first to win ten games" type of match in the semi-tropical conditions of [[Havana]], especially as drawn games were becoming more frequent and the match might last for over six months. He therefore made a counter-proposal: if neither player had a lead of at least two games by the end of the match, it should be considered a draw; the match should be limited to the best of thirty games, counting draws; except that if either player won six games ''and'' led by at least two games before thirty games were completed, he should be declared the winner; the champion should decide the venue and stakes, and should have the exclusive right to publish the games; the challenger should deposit a forfeit of US $2,000 (equivalent to over $194,000 in 2006 values&lt;ref&gt;Using average incomes as the conversion factor; if prices are used for the conversion, the result is about $45,000—see {{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;); the time limit should be twelve moves per hour; play should be limited to two sessions of 2½ hours each per day, five days a week. Capablanca objected to the time limit, the short playing times, the thirty-game limit, and especially the requirement that he must win by two games to claim the title, which he regarded as unfair. Lasker took offence at the terms in which Capablanca criticized the two-game lead condition and broke off negotiations, and until 1914 Lasker and Capablanca were not on speaking terms. However, at the 1914 St. Petersburg tournament, Capablanca proposed a set of rules for the conduct of World Championship matches, which were accepted by all the leading players, including Lasker.&lt;ref name="graemecree1921WorldChessChampionship"&gt;{{Cite web

Late in 1912 Lasker entered into negotiations for a world title match with [[Akiba Rubinstein]], whose tournament record for the previous few years had been on a par with Lasker's and a little ahead of Capablanca's.&lt;ref name="chessmetricsProfileRubinstein"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two players agreed to play a match if Rubinstein could raise the funds, but Rubinstein had few rich friends to back him and the match was never played. This situation demonstrated some of the flaws inherent in the championship system then being used. The start of World War I in summer 1914 put an end to hopes that Lasker would play either Rubinstein or Capablanca for the World Championship in the near future.&lt;ref name="Horowitz1973MorphyToFischer"&gt;{{cite book

Throughout World War I (1914–1918) Lasker played in only two serious chess events. He convincingly won (5½−½) a non-title match against Tarrasch in 1916.&lt;ref name="storiascacchiMatches1915Al1929"/&gt; In September–October 1918, shortly before the [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|armistice]], he won a quadrangular (four-player) tournament, half a point ahead of Rubinstein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Academic activities 1894–1918 ===
[[Image:Hilbert.jpg|thumb|upright|[[David Hilbert]] encouraged Lasker to obtain a [[Ph.D]] in mathematics.]]
Despite his superb playing results, chess was not Lasker's only interest. His parents recognized his intellectual talents, especially for mathematics, and sent the adolescent Emanuel to study in Berlin (where he found he also had a talent for chess). Lasker gained his [[abitur]] (high school graduation certificate) at [[Landsberg an der Warthe]], now a [[Poland|Polish]] town named Gorzów Wielkopolski but then part of [[Prussia]]. He then studied mathematics and philosophy at the universities in Berlin, [[Göttingen]] (where [[David Hilbert]] was one of his doctoral advisors) and [[Heidelberg]].&lt;ref name="dcsStAndrewsLaskerBio"/&gt;

For a short time in 1906 Emanuel Lasker was interested in the strategy game [[Go (board game)|Go]], but soon returned to chess. He was introduced to the game by his namesake [[Edward Lasker]], who wrote a successful book ''Go and Go-Moku'' in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rec.games.go/LGH6DOZtaZc|title=Google Groups|website=groups.google.com|access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 42, in July 1911, Lasker married Martha Cohn (née Bamberger), a rich widow who was a year older than Lasker and already a grandmother. They lived in Berlin.&lt;ref name="BillWallEmLasker"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

During [[World War I]], Lasker invested all of his savings in German [[war bond]]s, which lost nearly their entire value with the wartime and [[hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic|post-war inflation]]. During the war, he wrote a pamphlet which claimed that civilization would be in danger if Germany lost the war.&lt;ref name="BillWallEmLasker"/&gt;

=== Match against Capablanca ===
{{main|World Chess Championship 1921|}}
In January 1920 Lasker and [[José Raúl Capablanca]] signed an agreement to play a World Championship match in 1921, noting that Capablanca was not free to play in 1920. Because of the delay, Lasker insisted on a final clause that allowed him to play anyone else for the championship in 1920, that nullified the contract with Capablanca if Lasker lost a title match in 1920, and that stipulated that if Lasker resigned the title Capablanca should become World Champion. Lasker had previously included in his agreement before World War I to play [[Akiba Rubinstein]] for the title a similar clause that if he resigned the title, it should become Rubinstein's.&lt;ref name="WinterHowCapaBecameChampion"/&gt;

A report in the ''American Chess Bulletin'' (July–August 1920 issue) said that Lasker had resigned the world title in favor of Capablanca because the conditions of the match were unpopular in the chess world. The ''American Chess Bulletin'' speculated that the conditions were not sufficiently unpopular to warrant resignation of the title, and that Lasker's real concern was that there was not enough financial backing to justify his devoting nine months to the match.&lt;ref name="WinterHowCapaBecameChampion"&gt;{{cite web

Tinsley in ''The Times'' (London) of 26 June 1920 for criticism of the conditions Lasker set for the defense of the title; ''American Chess Bulletin'' September–October 1920 for Lasker's and Capablanca's statements that Capablanca was the champion and Lasker the challenger, for Capablanca's statement that Lasker's contract with Rubinstein had contained a clause allowing him to abdicate in favor of Rubinstein, for Lasker's intention to resign the title if he beat Capablanca and his support for an international organization, preferably based in the Americas, to manage international chess. Winter says that before Lasker's abdication some chess correspondents had been calling for Lasker to be stripped of the title.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Lasker resigned the title in favor of Capablanca he was unaware that enthusiasts in [[Havana]] had just raised $20,000 to fund the match provided it was played there. When Capablanca learned of Lasker's resignation he went to the Netherlands, where Lasker was living at the time, to inform him that Havana would finance the match. In August 1920 Lasker agreed to play in Havana, but insisted that he was the challenger as Capablanca was now the champion. Capablanca signed an agreement that accepted this point, and soon afterwards published a letter confirming this. Lasker also stated that, if he beat Capablanca, he would resign the title so that younger masters could compete for it.&lt;ref name="WinterHowCapaBecameChampion"/&gt;

The match was played in March–April 1921. After four draws, the fifth game saw Lasker [[blunder (chess)|blunder]] with Black in an equal [[chess endgame|ending]]. Capablanca's solid style allowed him to easily draw the next four games, without taking any risks. In the tenth game, Lasker as White played a position with an [[Isolated Queen Pawn|isolated queen pawn]] but failed to create the necessary activity and Capablanca reached a superior ending, which he duly won. The eleventh and fourteenth games were also won by Capablanca, and Lasker resigned the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Assessment ==

=== Playing strength and style ===
Lasker was considered to have a "psychological" method of play in which he considered the subjective qualities of his opponent, in addition to the objective requirements of his position on the board. [[Richard Réti]] published a lengthy analysis of Lasker's play in which he concluded that Lasker deliberately played inferior moves that he knew would make his opponent uncomfortable.&lt;ref&gt;Réti wrote, "In analyzing Lasker's tournament games, I was struck by his lasting and at first seemingly incredible good luck. ... There is no denying the fact that over and over again Lasker's exposition is poor, that he is in a losing position hundreds of times and, nevertheless, wins in the end."{{cite book

 | title=Masters of the Chessboard
 | publisher=Dover Publications
 | year=1976
 | page=132
 | isbn=0-486-23384-7
}} Réti considered, but rejected as too improbable, the "hypothesis of lasting luck", finally concluding that the only explanation for Lasker's repeated success from bad positions is that he "often plays badly on purpose". ''Id.'' Réti concluded that Lasker studied his opponents' strong and weak points, and that, "He is not so much interested in making the objectively best moves as he is in making those most disagreeable to his opponent; he turns the game in a direction not suitable to the style of his opponent and on this unaccustomed road leads him to the abyss, often by means of intentionally bad moves, as I have previously described." ''Id.'' at 133.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Pollock (chess player)|W. H. K. Pollock]] commented, "It is no easy matter to reply correctly to Lasker's bad moves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Lasker himself denied the claim that he deliberately played bad moves, and most modern writers agree. According to [[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmaster]] [[Andrew Soltis]] and [[International Master]] [[John L. Watson]], the features that made his play mysterious to contemporaries now appear regularly in modern play: the g2–g4 "Spike" attack against the [[Sicilian Defence, Dragon Variation|Dragon Sicilian]];{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} [[Sacrifice (chess)|sacrifices]] to gain positional advantage; playing the "practical" move rather than trying to find the best move; counterattacking and complicating the game before a disadvantage became serious.&lt;ref name="SoltisLaskerMatters"&gt;{{cite book

[[Max Euwe]] opined that the real reason behind Lasker's success was his "exceptional defensive technique" and that "almost all there is to say about defensive chess can be demonstrated by examples from the games of Steinitz and Lasker", with the former exemplifying passive defence and the latter an active defence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The famous win against [[José Raúl Capablanca]] at [[St. Petersburg 1914 chess tournament|St. Petersburg in 1914]], which Lasker needed in order to retain any chance of catching up with Capablanca, is sometimes offered as evidence of his "psychological" approach. [[Reuben Fine]] describes Lasker's choice of opening, the [[Ruy Lopez, Exchange Variation|Exchange Variation of the Ruy Lopez]], as "innocuous but psychologically potent".&lt;ref name="Fine1952WorldsGreatChessGamesEmLasker"/&gt; However, an analysis of Lasker's use of this variation throughout his career concludes that he had excellent results with it as White against top-class opponents, and sometimes used it in "must-win" situations.&lt;ref name="WrinnLaskerRuyExchangeVariation"&gt;As White in [[Ruy Lopez, Exchange Variation|Exchange Variation of the Ruy Lopez]] Lasker scored ten wins, three draws and just one loss, to Steinitz in 1894. Lasker also won the three recorded games in which he played the variation as Black; one was against [[Alexander Alekhine|Alekhine]], in the 1914 St. Petersburg Tournament, the day before Lasker beat Capablanca.{{cite web

Fine reckoned Lasker paid little attention to the openings,&lt;ref name="Fine1952WorldsGreatChessGamesEmLasker"/&gt; but Capablanca thought Lasker knew the openings very well but disagreed with a lot of contemporary opening analysis. In fact before the 1894 world title match, Lasker studied the openings thoroughly, especially Steinitz's favorite lines. He played primarily e4 openings, particularly the [[Ruy Lopez]]. He opened with 1.d4 relatively rarely, although his d4 games had a higher winning percentage than his e4 ones. With the Black pieces, he mainly answered 1.e4 with the [[French Defense]] and 1.d4 with the [[Queen's Gambit]]. Lasker also used the [[Sicilian Defense]] fairly often. In Capablanca's opinion, no player surpassed Lasker in the ability to assess a position quickly and accurately, in terms of who had the better prospects of winning and what strategy each side should adopt.&lt;ref name="HavanurReviewWhyLaskerMatters"&gt;{{cite web

Lasker followed [[Wilhelm Steinitz|Steinitz]]'s principles, and both demonstrated a completely different chess paradigm than the “romantic” mentality before them. Thanks to Steinitz and Lasker, positional players gradually became common ([[Siegbert Tarrasch|Tarrasch]], [[Carl Schlechter|Schlechter]], and [[Akiba Rubinstein|Rubinstein]] stand out.) But, while Steinitz created a new school of chess thought, Lasker’s talents were far harder for the masses to grasp; hence there was no Lasker school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

There are several "Lasker Variations" in the [[chess opening]]s, including Lasker's Defense to the [[Queen's Gambit]], Lasker's Defense to the [[Evans Gambit]] (which effectively ended the use of this [[gambit]] in tournament play until a revival in the 1990s),&lt;ref name="FineIdeasBehindOpenings"&gt;Lasker's Defense: {{cite book

One of Lasker's most famous games is [[Lasker - Bauer, Amsterdam, 1889|Lasker–Bauer, Amsterdam 1889]], in which he sacrificed both bishops in a maneuver later repeated in a number of games. Similar sacrifices had already been played by [[Cecil Valentine De Vere]] and [[John Owen (chess player)|John Owen]], but these were not in major events and Lasker probably had not seen them.&lt;ref name="JeffreysReviewWhyLaskerMatters"/&gt;

Lasker was shocked by the poverty in which [[Wilhelm Steinitz]] died and did not intend to die in similar circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Lasker wrote "I who vanquished him must see to it that his great achievement, his theories should find justice, and I must avenge the wrongs he suffered". {{cite book

Some of the controversial conditions that Lasker insisted on for championship matches led Capablanca to attempt twice (1914 and 1922) to publish rules for such matches, to which other top players readily agreed.&lt;ref name="graemecree1921WorldChessChampionship"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chessvilleLondonRules"&gt;{{cite web

=== Work in other fields ===
Lasker was also a mathematician. In his 1905 article on [[commutative algebra]], Lasker introduced the theory of [[Lasker–Noether theorem|primary decomposition]] of [[ideal of a ring|ideal]]s, which has influence in the theory of [[Noetherian ring]]s.&lt;ref&gt;He defined the [[primary decomposition]] property of the [[ring ideal|ideal]]s of some [[commutative ring]]s when he proved that [[polynomial ring]]s have the primary decomposition property.&lt;/ref&gt; Rings having the ''primary decomposition property'' are called "[[Laskerian ring]]s" in his honor.&lt;ref name="dcsStAndrewsLaskerBio"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

However, his dramatic and philosophical works have never been highly regarded.&lt;ref name="laskergesellschaftLaskerNewApproaches"/&gt;

== Friends and relatives ==
Lasker was a good friend of [[Albert Einstein]], who wrote the introduction to the posthumous biography ''Emanuel Lasker, The Life of a Chess Master'' from Dr. Jacques Hannak (1952).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | author=Hannak, J.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this preface Einstein express his satisfaction at having met Lasker, writing:
{{quote|Emanuel Lasker was undoubtedly one of the most interesting people I came to know in my later years. We must be thankful to those who have penned the story of his life for this and succeeding generations.

Poet [[Else Lasker-Schüler]] was his sister-in-law. [[Edward Lasker]], born in Kempen (Kępno), [[Greater Poland]] (then [[Prussia]]), the German-American [[International Master|chess master]], engineer, and author, claimed that he was distantly related to Emanuel Lasker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/siliconvalley/lab/7378/relative.htm |accessdate=2008-11-21 |title=Relatives of Chessplayers |publisher=GeoCities.com |author=Bill Wall |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028033711/http://www.geocities.com/siliconvalley/lab/7378/relative.htm |archivedate=October 28, 2009 |deadurl=unfit }}&lt;/ref&gt; They both played in the great [[New York 1924 chess tournament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine

=== Fiction ===
In [[Michael Chabon]]'s [[alternate history]] [[Mystery fiction|mystery]] novel, ''[[The Yiddish Policemen's Union]]'', the murdered man, Mendel Shpilman (born during the 1960s), being a chess enthusiast, uses the name "Emanuel Lasker" as an alias. The reference is clearly understood by the protagonist, Detective Meyer Landsman, because he has also studied chess.

Even the preliminary tournament would now be considered a "super-tournament". Capablanca "won" the preliminary tournament by 1½ points without losing a game, but Lasker achieved a plus score against all his opponents in the final tournament and finished with a combined score ½ point ahead of Capablanca's.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7935">In [[mathematics]], the '''flat topology''' is a [[Grothendieck topology]] used in [[algebraic geometry]]. It is used to define the theory of '''flat cohomology'''; it also plays a fundamental role in the theory of [[descent (category theory)|descent]] (faithfully flat descent).&lt;ref&gt;[http://eom.springer.de/f/f040800.htm Springer EoM article]&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''flat'' here comes from [[flat module]]s.

There are several slightly different flat topologies, the most common of which are the '''fppf topology''' and the '''fpqc topology'''.  ''fppf'' stands for ''{{lang|fr|fidèlement plate de présentation finie}}'', and in this topology, a morphism of affine schemes is a covering morphism if it is faithfully flat and of finite presentation.  ''fpqc'' stands for ''{{lang|fr|fidèlement plate et quasi-compacte}}'', and in this topology, a morphism of affine schemes is a covering morphism if it is faithfully flat.  In both categories, a covering family is defined be a family which is a cover on Zariski open subsets.&lt;ref&gt;SGA III&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, IV 6.3.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the fpqc topology, any faithfully flat and quasi-compact morphism is a cover.&lt;ref&gt;SGA III&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, IV 6.3, Proposition 6.3.1(v).&lt;/ref&gt;  These topologies are closely related to [[descent (category theory)|descent]]. The "pure" faithfully flat topology without any further finiteness conditions such as quasi compactness or finite presentation is not used much as is not subcanonical; in other words, representable functors need not be sheaves.

Unfortunately the terminology for flat topologies is not standardized. Some authors use the term "topology" for a pretopology, and there are several slightly different pretopologies sometimes called the fppf or fpqc (pre)topology, which sometimes give the same topology.

Flat cohomology was introduced by Grothendieck in about 1960.&lt;ref&gt;*{{Citation | last1=Grothendieck | first1=Alexander | author1-link=Alexander Grothendieck | last2=Raynaud | first2=Michèle | title=Revêtements étales et groupe fondamental (SGA 1) | origyear=1971 | arxiv=math/0206203 | publisher=[[Société Mathématique de France]] | location=Paris | series=Documents Mathématiques (Paris) [Mathematical Documents (Paris)] | isbn=978-2-85629-141-2 | mr=2017446 | year=2003 | volume=3|page=XI.4.8| bibcode=2002math......6203G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The big and small fppf sites ==

Let ''X'' be an [[affine scheme]].  We define an '''fppf cover''' of ''X'' to be a finite and jointly surjective family of morphisms

:(''&amp;phi;''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; : ''X''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; ''X'')

with each ''X''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; affine and each ''&amp;phi;''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; [[flat morphism|flat]], [[Glossary of scheme theory#Finite.2C quasi-finite.2C finite type.2C and finite presentation morphisms|finitely presented]].  This generates a [[pretopology]]: for ''X'' arbitrary, we define an fppf cover of ''X'' to be a family

:(''&amp;phi;'&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; : ''X''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; ''X'')

which is an fppf cover after base changing to an open affine subscheme of ''X''. This pretopology generates a topology called the ''fppf topology''.  (This is not the same as the topology we would get if we started with arbitrary ''X'' and ''X''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; and took covering families to be jointly surjective families of flat, finitely presented morphisms.)  We write ''Fppf'' for the category of schemes with the fppf topology.

The '''small fppf site of '''''X''''' ''' is the category ''O''(''X''&lt;sub&gt;fppf&lt;/sub&gt;) whose objects are schemes ''U'' with a fixed morphism ''U'' → ''X'' which is part of some covering family.  (This does not imply that the morphism is flat, finitely presented.)  The morphisms are morphisms of schemes compatible with the fixed maps to ''X''.  The '''large fppf site of '''''X''''' ''' is the category ''Fppf/X'', that is, the category of schemes with a fixed map to ''X'', considered with the fppf topology.

"Fppf" is an abbreviation for "fidèlement plate de présentation finie", that is, "faithfully flat and of finite presentation".  Every surjective family of flat and finitely presented morphisms is a covering family for this topology, hence the name.  The definition of the fppf pretopology can also be given with an extra quasi-finiteness condition; it follows from Corollary 17.16.2 in 
EGA IV&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; that this gives the same topology.

== The big and small fpqc sites ==

Let ''X'' be an affine scheme.  We define an '''fpqc cover''' of ''X'' to be a finite and jointly surjective family of morphisms {''u''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; : ''X''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; → ''X''} with each ''X''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; affine and each ''u''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; [[flat morphism|flat]].  This generates a pretopology: For ''X'' arbitrary, we define an fpqc cover of ''X'' to be a family {''u''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; : ''X''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; → ''X''} which is an fpqc cover after base changing to an open affine subscheme of ''X''.  This pretopology generates a topology called the ''fpqc topology''.  (This is not the same as the topology we would get if we started with arbitrary ''X'' and ''X''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; and took covering families to be jointly surjective families of flat morphisms.)  We write ''Fpqc'' for the category of schemes with the fpqc topology.

The '''small fpqc site of '''''X''''' ''' is the category ''O''(''X''&lt;sub&gt;fpqc&lt;/sub&gt;) whose objects are schemes ''U'' with a fixed morphism ''U'' → ''X'' which is part of some covering family.  The morphisms are morphisms of schemes compatible with the fixed maps to ''X''.  The '''large fpqc site of '''''X''''' ''' is the category ''Fpqc/X'', that is, the category of schemes with a fixed map to ''X'', considered with the fpqc topology.

"Fpqc" is an abbreviation for "fidèlement plate quasi-compacte", that is, "faithfully flat and quasi-compact".  Every surjective family of flat and quasi-compact morphisms is a covering family for this topology, hence the name.

==Flat cohomology==
The procedure for defining the cohomology groups is the standard one: cohomology is defined as the sequence of [[derived functor]]s of the functor taking the [[section (sheaf theory)|sections]] of a [[sheaf of abelian groups]].

While such groups have a number of applications, they are not in general easy to compute, except in cases where they reduce to other theories, such as the [[étale cohomology]].

==Example==

The following example shows why the "faithfully flat topology" without any finiteness conditions does not behave well. Suppose ''X'' is the affine line over an algebraically closed field ''k''. For each closed point ''x'' of ''X'' we can consider the local ring ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; at this point, which is a discrete valuation ring whose spectrum has one closed point and one open (generic) point. We glue these spectra together by identifying their open points to get a scheme ''Y''. There is a natural map from ''Y'' to ''X''.  The affine line ''X'' is covered by the sets Spec(''R''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;) which are open in the faithfully flat topology, and each of these sets has a natural map to ''Y'', and these maps are the same on intersections. However they cannot be combined to give a map from ''X'' to ''Y'',  because the underlying spaces of  ''X'' and ''Y'' have different topologies.

'''"Floradora"''', also called '''Keyword,''' was a doubly [[Cipher|enciphered]] diplomatic [[Code (cryptography)|code]] used by the Germans during the [[Second World War]].  The Allies used  [[Unit record equipment|tabulating equipment]], created by [[IBM]], to break the code over period of more than a year in 1941 and 1942.

&lt;/ref&gt; is any equation in which the [[unknown (mathematics)|unknown]] represents a [[function (mathematics)|function]].
Often, the [[equation]] relates the value of a function (or functions) at some point with its values at other points. For instance, properties of functions can be determined by considering the types of functional equations they satisfy. The term ''functional equation'' usually refers to equations that cannot be simply reduced to [[algebraic equation|algebraic equations]].
&lt;!--, often because two or more known functions are substituted as arguments into another function.
!--&gt;

==Examples==

* The functional equation

::&lt;math&gt;
f(s) = 2^s\pi^{s-1}\sin\left(\frac{\pi s}{2}\right)\Gamma(1-s)f(1-s)
&lt;/math&gt;

:is satisfied by the [[Riemann zeta function]].  The capital {{mvar|&amp;Gamma;}} denotes the [[gamma function]].

* The gamma function is the unique solution of the following system of three equations:
::&lt;math&gt;f(x)={f(x+1) \over x}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;f(y)f\left(y+\frac{1}{2}\right)=\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2^{2y-1}}f(2y)&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;f(z)f(1-z)={\pi \over \sin(\pi z)}\,\!\,\,\,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;([[Leonhard Euler|Euler's]] [[reflection formula]])

* The functional equation

::&lt;math&gt;f\left({az+b\over cz+d}\right) = (cz+d)^k f(z)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

:where {{math|''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d''}} are [[integer]]s satisfying {{math|''ad'' &amp;minus; ''bc''}} = 1, i.e. &lt;math&gt;
\begin{vmatrix} a &amp; b\\c &amp; d\end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; = 1, defines {{mvar|f}} to be a [[modular form]] of order {{mvar|k}}.

* Miscellaneous examples, not necessarily involving  standard or named  functions:
::&lt;math&gt;f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; ([[Cauchy functional equation]])  
Exponentiating,
::&lt;math&gt;f(x + y) = f(x)f(y), \,\!&lt;/math&gt; satisfied by all [[exponential function]]s

::&lt;math&gt;f(xy) = f(x) + f(y)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, satisfied by all [[logarithm]]ic functions

::&lt;math&gt;f(xy) = f(x) f(y)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, satisfied by all powers

::&lt;math&gt;f(x + y) + f(x - y) = 2[f(x) + f(y)]\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (quadratic equation or [[parallelogram law]])

::&lt;math&gt;f((x + y)/2) = (f(x) + f(y))/2\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (Jensen)

::&lt;math&gt;g(x + y) + g(x - y) = 2[g(x) g(y)]\,\!&lt;/math&gt;  (d'Alembert)

::&lt;math&gt;f(h(x)) = h(x + 1)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;  ([[Abel equation]])

::&lt;math&gt;f(h(x)) = cf(x)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;  ([[Schröder's equation]]).

::&lt;math&gt;f(h(x)) = (f(x))^c\,\!&lt;/math&gt;  ([[Böttcher's equation]]).

::&lt;math&gt;f(h(x)) = h'(x)f(x)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; ([[Schröder's equation#Functional significance|Julia's equation]]).

::&lt;math&gt;\omega(  \omega(x,u),v)=\omega(x,u+v) &lt;/math&gt; (Translation equation)

::&lt;math&gt;f(x+y) = f(x)g(y)+f(y)g(x)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; ([[List of trigonometric identities#Angle sum and difference identities|sine addition formula]]).

::&lt;math&gt;g(x+y) = g(x)g(y)-f(y)f(x)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; ([[List of trigonometric identities#Angle sum and difference identities|cosine addition formula]]).

::&lt;math&gt;f(xy) = \sum g_l(x) h_l(y)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (Levi-Civita).

*A simple form of functional equation is a [[recurrence relation]]. This, formally speaking, involves an unspecified functions on integers  and also [[shift operator]]s. One such example of a recurrence relation is
:: &lt;math&gt;a(n) = 3a(n-1) + 4a(n-2)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

*The commutative and associative laws are functional equations.  When the associative law is expressed in its familiar form, one lets some symbol between two variables represent a binary operation,
::&lt;math&gt;(a\circ b)\circ c = a\circ (b\circ c)~.&lt;/math&gt;
But if we wrote ''&amp;fnof;''(''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'') instead of ''a''&amp;nbsp;○&amp;nbsp;''b'' then the associative law would look more like what one conventionally thinks of as a functional equation,
::&lt;math&gt;f(f(a, b),c) = f(a, f(b, c)).\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

One feature that all of the examples listed above share in common is that, in each case, two or more known functions (sometimes multiplication by a constant, sometimes addition of two variables, sometimes the identity function) are  inside the argument of the unknown functions to be solved for.

When it comes to asking for ''all'' solutions, it may be the case that conditions from [[mathematical analysis]] should be applied; for example, in the case of the ''Cauchy equation'' mentioned above, the solutions that are [[continuous function]]s are the 'reasonable' ones, while other solutions that are not likely to have practical application can be constructed (by using a [[Hamel basis]] for the [[real number]]s as [[vector space]] over the [[rational number]]s). The [[Bohr–Mollerup theorem]] is another well-known example.

==Solving functional equations==
Solving functional equations can be very difficult, but there are some common methods of solving them. For example, in [[dynamic programming]] a variety of successive approximation methods&lt;ref&gt;Bellman, R. (1957). Dynamic Programming, [[Princeton University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sniedovich, M. (2010). Dynamic Programming: Foundations and Principles, [[Taylor &amp; Francis]].&lt;/ref&gt; are used to solve [[Bellman equation|Bellman's functional equation]], including methods based on [[fixed point iteration]]s.

A main method of solving elementary functional equations is substitution. It is often useful to prove surjectivity or injectivity and prove oddness or evenness, if possible. It is also useful to guess possible solutions. Induction is a useful technique to use when the function is only defined for rational or integer values.

A discussion of [[Involution (mathematics)|involutory]] functions is topical. For example, consider the function
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = 1-x \, .&lt;/math&gt;
Composing {{mvar|f}} with itself gives '''[[Charles Babbage|Babbage's]] functional equation''' (1820),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/2007270| jstor = 2007270| title = On Certain Real Solutions of Babbage's Functional Equation| journal = The Annals of Mathematics| volume = 17| issue = 3| pages = 113| year = 1916| last1 = Ritt | first1 = J. F.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;f(f(x)) = 1-(1-x) = x \, .&lt;/math&gt;
Several other functions also satisfy the functional equation
:&lt;math&gt;f(f(x)) = x &lt;/math&gt;
including
:&lt;math&gt; f(x) = -x\, ,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; f(x) = \frac{a}{x}\, ,&lt;/math&gt; and 
:&lt;math&gt; f(x) = \frac{b-x}{1+cx} ~ ,&lt;/math&gt;
which includes the previous three as special cases or limits.

'''Example 1'''. Find all functions  {{mvar|f}}  that satisfy
: &lt;math&gt;f(x+y)^2 = f(x)^2 + f(y)^2\,&lt;/math&gt;
for all {{math|''x,y'' ∈ ℝ}},  assuming ''&amp;fnof;'' is a [[real-valued function]].

Let {{mvar|x}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|y}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, 
: &lt;math&gt;f(0)^2=f(0)^2+f(0)^2.\,&lt;/math&gt;

So ''&amp;fnof;''(0)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 and ''&amp;fnof;''(0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.

Now, let {{mvar|y}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−{{mvar|x}},
:&lt;math&gt;f(x-x)^2=f(x)^2+f(-x)^2\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f(0)^2=f(x)^2+f(-x)^2\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;0=f(x)^2+f(-x)^2~.&lt;/math&gt;
A square of a real number is nonnegative, and a sum of nonnegative numbers is zero [[iff]] both numbers are 0.

So ''&amp;fnof;''(x)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 for all {{mvar|x}} and {{math|''&amp;fnof;''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;0}} is the only solution.

It deals with the construction and representation of free-form curves, surfaces, or volumes&lt;ref&gt;Farin, G.: "A History of Curves and Surfaces in CAGD", [https://books.google.com/books?id=0SV5G8fgxLoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Computer+Aided+GEOMETRIC+DESIGN&amp;source=gbs_summary_s&amp;cad=0 ''Handbook of Computer Aided Geometric Design'']&lt;/ref&gt; and is closely related to [[geometric modeling]]. Core problems are curve and surface modelling and representation. GD studies especially the construction and manipulation of curves and surfaces given by a set of points using polynomial, rational, piecewise polynomial, or piecewise rational methods. The most important instruments here are [[parametric curve]]s and [[parametric surface]]s, such as [[Bézier curve]]s, [[spline (mathematics)|spline]] curves and surfaces. An important non-parametric approach is the [[level-set method]].

Application areas include shipbuilding, aircraft, and automotive industries, as well as architectural design. The modern ubiquity and power of computers means that even perfume bottles and shampoo dispensers are designed using techniques unheard of by shipbuilders of 1960s.

Geometric models can be built for objects of any [[dimension]] in any [[geometric]] space. Both [[2D geometric model|2D]] and [[3D modeling|3D geometric models]] are extensively used in [[computer graphics]]. [[2D geometric model|2D models]] are important in computer [[typography]] and [[technical drawing]]. [[3D modeling|3D models]] are central to [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer-aided manufacturing|manufacturing]], and many applied technical fields such as [[Geologic modelling|geology]] and [[medical image processing]].

Geometric models are usually distinguished from [[procedural modeling|procedural]] and [[object-oriented modeling|object-oriented models]], which define the shape implicitly by an [[algorithm]]. They are also contrasted with [[digital image]]s and [[volumetric model]]s; and with [[implicit model|implicit]] mathematical models such as the [[zero set]] of an arbitrary [[polynomial]]. However, the distinction is often blurred: for instance, geometric shapes can be represented by [[object-oriented programming|objects]]; a [[digital image]] can be interpreted as a collection of colored squares; and geometric shapes such as circles are defined by implicit mathematical equations. Also, the modeling of [[fractal]] objects often requires a combination of geometric and procedural techniques.

Geometric problems originating in architecture can lead to interesting research and results in geometry processing, computer-aided geometric design, and discrete differential geometry.&lt;ref&gt;H.

'''Geometric modeling''' is a branch of [[applied mathematics]] and [[computational geometry]] that studies methods and [[algorithms]] for the mathematical description of shapes.

The shapes studied in geometric modeling are mostly two- or three-[[dimension]]al, although many of its tools and principles can be applied to sets of any finite dimension.  Today most geometric modeling is done with computers and for computer-based applications. [[2D geometric model|Two-dimensional model]]s are important in computer [[typography]] and [[technical drawing]]. [[3D modeling|Three-dimensional model]]s are central to [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer-aided manufacturing|manufacturing]] (CAD/CAM), and widely used in many applied technical fields such as  [[civil engineering|civil]] and [[mechanical engineering]], [[architecture]], [[geologic modeling|geology]] and [[medical image processing]].&lt;ref&gt;Handbook of Computer Aided Geometric Design&lt;/ref&gt;

Geometric models are usually distinguished from [[procedural modeling|procedural]] and [[object-oriented modeling|object-oriented model]]s, which define the shape implicitly by an opaque [[algorithm]] that generates its appearance.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}  They are also contrasted with [[digital image]]s and [[volumetric model]]s which represent the shape as a subset of a fine regular partition of space; and with [[fractal]] models that give an infinitely recursive definition of the shape.   However, these distinctions are often blurred: for instance, a [[digital image]] can be interpreted as a collection of [[color]]ed [[square (geometry)|square]]s; and geometric shapes such as [[circle]]s are defined by implicit mathematical equations.  Also, a [[fractal]] model yields a parametric or implicit model when its recursive definition is truncated to a finite depth.

Notable awards of the area are the John A. Gregory Memorial Award&lt;ref&gt;http://geometric-modelling.org&lt;/ref&gt; and the Bézier award.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.solidmodeling.org/bezier_award.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In mathematics, the '''hafnian''' of an [[adjacency matrix]] of a graph is the number of [[Matching (graph theory)#Definition|perfect matchings]] in the graph.  It was so named by [[Eduardo R. Caianiello]] "to mark the fruitful period of stay in [[Copenhagen]] (Hafnia in Latin)."&lt;ref&gt;F. Guerra, in ''Imagination and Rigor: Essays on Eduardo R. Caianiello's Scientific Heritage'', edited by  Settimo Termini, Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2006, page 98&lt;/ref&gt;

The hafnian of a 2n&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;2n symmetric matrix is computed as

: &lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{haf}(A) = \frac{1}{n!2^n} \sum_{\sigma \in S_{2n}} \prod_{j=1}^n A_{\sigma(2j - 1), \sigma(2j)},
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;S_{2n}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[symmetric group]] on [''2n''].&lt;ref&gt;Rudelson, Mark, Alex Samorodnitsky, and Ofer Zeitouni. "Random Gaussian matrices and Hafnian estimators." ''arXiv preprint arXiv:1409.3905'' (2014). [[arxiv:1409.3905|http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3905]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Equivalently,
: &lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{haf}(A) = \sum_{M \in \mathcal{M}} \prod_{\scriptscriptstyle (u, v) \in M} A_{u, v}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all 1-factors ([[perfect matching]]s) on the complete graph &lt;math&gt;K_{2n}&lt;/math&gt;, namely the set of all &lt;math&gt;(2n)!/(n!2^n)&lt;/math&gt; ways to partition the set &lt;math&gt;\{1, 2, \dots, 2n\}&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; subsets of size &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Combinatorics and Complexity of Partition Functions | page=93 | author=Alexander Barvinok | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9LlZDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv | page=7 | authors=Alexander Barvinok, Guus Regts | title=Weighted counting of integer points in a subspace | eprint = 1706.05423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mathematics, a '''handle decomposition of a 3-manifold''' allows simplification of the original [[3-manifold]] into pieces which are easier to study.

==Heegaard splittings==
An important method used to decompose into [[handlebody|handlebodies]] is the [[Heegaard splitting]], which gives us  a decomposition in two handlebodies of equal genus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Quantum invariant|Quantum Invariants]] of Knots and 3-manifolds|first=Vladimir G. |last=Turaev|publisher=[[Walter de Gruyter]]|year= 1994|isbn=3-11-013704-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
As an example: [[lens space]]s are orientable 3-spaces, and allow decomposition into two '''solid-tori''' which are genus-one-handlebodies. The genus one non-orientable space is a space which is the union of two [[solid Klein bottle]]s and corresponds to the twisted product of the 2-sphere and the 1-sphere: &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle S^2\tilde{\times}S^1&lt;/math&gt;.

==Orientability==
Each orientable 3-manifold is the union of exactly two orientable handlebodies; meanwhile, each non-orientable one needs three orientable handlebodies.

==Heegaard genus==
The minimal genus of the glueing boundary determines what is known as the [[Heegaard genus]]. For non-orientable spaces an interesting invariant is the [[trigenus|tri-genus]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7733">In mathematics, '''Harnack's inequality''' is an [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]]  relating the values of a positive [[harmonic function]] at two points, introduced by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Carl Gustav Axel Harnack|first=A.|last=Harnack|year=1887}}. {{harvs|txt|first=J. |last=Serrin|authorlink=James Serrin|year=1955}}, and {{harvs|txt|last=Moser|first=J.|authorlink=Jürgen Moser |year1=1961|year4=1964}} generalized Harnack's inequality to solutions of elliptic or parabolic [[partial differential equation]]s.  [[Grigori Perelman|Perelman]]'s solution of the [[Poincaré conjecture]] uses a version of the Harnack inequality, found by {{harvs|txt|first=R.|last=Hamilton|authorlink=Richard S. Hamilton|year=1993|txt}}, for the [[Ricci flow]]. Harnack's inequality is used to prove [[Harnack's theorem]] about the convergence of sequences of harmonic functions. Harnack's inequality can also be used to show the interior [[Hölder condition|regularity]] of weak solutions of partial differential equations.

==The statement==

[[Image:Harnack.png|thumb|200px|A harmonic function (green) over a disk (blue) is bounded from above by a function (red) that coincides with the harmonic function at the disk center and approaches infinity towards the disk boundary.]]
'''Harnack's inequality''' applies to a non-negative function  ''f''  defined on a closed ball in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; with radius ''R'' and centre ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. It states that, if ''f'' is continuous on the closed ball and [[harmonic function|harmonic]] on its interior, then for every point ''x'' with |''x''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;|&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''r''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''R'',

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1-(r/R)} {[1+(r/R)]^{n-1}} f(x_0)\le f(x) \le  {1+(r/R)\over [1 - (r/R)]^{n-1}} f(x_0).&lt;/math&gt;

In the plane '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  (''n'' = 2) the inequality can be written:

:&lt;math&gt;{R-r\over R+r} f(x_0)\le f(x)\le {R+r\over R-r}f(x_0).&lt;/math&gt;

For general domains &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; the inequality can be stated as follows: If &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is a bounded domain with &lt;math&gt;\bar{\omega} \subset \Omega&lt;/math&gt;, then there is a constant &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; such that 

:&lt;math&gt; \sup_{x \in \omega} u(x) \le C \inf_{x \in \omega} u(x)&lt;/math&gt;

for every twice differentiable, harmonic and nonnegative function &lt;math&gt;u(x)&lt;/math&gt;. The constant &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is independent of &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;; it depends only on the domains &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;.

==Proof of Harnack's inequality in a ball==
By [[Poisson kernel|Poisson's formula]]

:&lt;math&gt; f(x) = \frac 1 {\omega_{n-1}} \int_{|y-x_0|=R} \frac{R^2 -r^2}{R|x - y|^n} \cdot f(y) \, dy, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''ω''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' − 1&lt;/sub&gt; is the area of the unit sphere in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; and ''r'' = |''x'' − ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;|.

Since

:&lt;math&gt; R-r \le |x-y| \le R+r,&lt;/math&gt;
 
the kernel in the integrand satisfies

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{R -r}{R (R+r)^{n-1}} \le \frac{R^2 -r^2}{R|x-y|^n}\le \frac{R+r}{R(R-r)^{n-1}}. &lt;/math&gt;

Harnack's inequality follows by substituting this inequality in the above integral and using the fact that the average of a harmonic function over a sphere equals its value at the center of the sphere:

: &lt;math&gt; f(x_0)= \frac 1 {R^{n-1}\omega_{n-1}} \int_{|y-x_0|=R} f(y)\, dy. &lt;/math&gt;

==Elliptic partial differential equations==
For elliptic partial differential equations, Harnack's inequality states that the supremum of a positive solution in some connected open region is bounded by some constant times the infimum, possibly with an added term containing a functional [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] of the data:

: &lt;math&gt;\sup u \le C ( \inf u + \|f\|)&lt;/math&gt;

The constant depends on the ellipticity of the equation and the connected open region.

==Parabolic partial differential equations==

There is a version of Harnack's inequality for linear parabolic PDEs such as [[heat equation]].

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; be a smooth (bounded) domain in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; and consider the linear elliptic operator

: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}u=\sum_{i,j=1}^n a_{ij}(t,x)\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x_i\,\partial x_j} + \sum_{i=1}^n b_i(t,x)\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_i} + c(t,x)u&lt;/math&gt;

with smooth and bounded coefficients and a [[positive definite]] matrix &lt;math&gt;(a_{ij})&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose that &lt;math&gt;u(t,x)\in C^2((0,T)\times\mathcal{M})&lt;/math&gt; is a solution of

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}-\mathcal{L}u\ge0&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;(0,T)\times\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;

such that

: &lt;math&gt;\quad u(t,x)\ge0 \text{ in } (0,T)\times\mathcal{M}.&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; be compactly contained in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; and choose &lt;math&gt;\tau\in(0,T)&lt;/math&gt;. Then there exists a constant ''C''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 (depending only on ''K'', &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; and the coefficients of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt;) such that, for each &lt;math&gt;t\in(\tau,T)&lt;/math&gt;,

: &lt;math&gt;\sup_K u(t-\tau,\cdot)\le C \inf_K u(t,\cdot).&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4280">'''Hilbert's twenty-second problem''' is the penultimate entry in the celebrated list of 23 [[Hilbert problems]] compiled in 1900 by [[David Hilbert]].  It entails the uniformization of analytic relations by means of [[automorphic function]]s.

==Problem statement==

The entirety of the original problem statement is as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
As Poincaré was the first to prove, it is always possible to reduce any algebraic relation between two variables to uniformity by the use of automorphic functions of one variable. That is, if any algebraic equation in two variables be given, there can always be found for these variables two such single valued automorphic functions of a single variable that their substitution renders the given algebraic equation an identity. The generalization of this fundamental theorem to any analytic non-algebraic relations whatever between two variables has likewise been attempted with success by Poincaré, though by a way entirely different from that which served him in the special problem first mentioned. From Poincaré's proof of the possibility of reducing to uniformity an arbitrary analytic relation between two variables, however, it does not become apparent whether the resolving functions can be determined to meet certain additional conditions. Namely, it is not shown whether the two single valued functions of the one new variable can be so chosen that, while this variable traverses the regular domain of those functions, the totality of all regular points of the given analytic field are actually reached and represented. On the contrary it seems to be the case, from Poincaré's investigations, that there are beside the branch points certain others, in general infinitely many other discrete exceptional points of the analytic field, that can be reached only by making the new variable approach certain limiting points of the functions. In view of the fundamental importance of Poincaré's formulation of the question it seems to me that an elucidation and resolution of this difficulty is extremely desirable.

In conjunction with this problem comes up the problem of reducing to uniformity an algebraic or any other analytic relation among three or more complex variables—a problem which is known to be solvable in many particular cases. Toward the solution of this the recent investigations of Picard on algebraic functions of two variables are to be regarded as welcome and important preliminary studies.&lt;ref&gt;Hilbert, David, "Mathematische Probleme" [[Göttinger Nachrichten]], (1900), pp. 253-297, and in [[Archiv der Mathematik und Physik]], (3) '''1''' (1901), 44-63 and 213-237.

==The theorem==
Given an integer ''k'', define a ''partition'' of the interval [0,1] as a sequence of numbers which divide the interval to &lt;math&gt;k+1&lt;/math&gt; subintervals:

: &lt;math&gt;0=z_0 &lt; z_1 &lt; \dotsb &lt; z_k &lt; z_{k+1} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

Define a ''signed partition'' as a partition in which each subinterval &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; has an associated sign &lt;math&gt;\delta_i&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;\delta_1,\dotsc,\delta_{k+1}\in\left\{+1,-1\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

The Hobby-Rice theorem says that for every ''k'' continuously integrable functions:

: &lt;math&gt;g_1,\dotsc,g_k\colon[0,1]\longrightarrow\Bbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

there exists a signed partition of [0,1] such that:

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^{k+1}\delta_i\!\int_{z_{i-1}}^{z_i} g_j(z)\,dz=0\text{ for }1\leq j\leq k.&lt;/math&gt;

(in other words: for each of the ''k'' functions, its integral over the positive subintervals equals its integral over the negative subintervals).

==Application to fair division==
The theorem was used by [[Noga Alon]] in the context of necklace splitting&lt;ref name="Alon 1987"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Alon| first=Noga| title=Splitting Necklaces| journal=Advances in Mathematics| year=1987| volume=63| pages=247–253| doi=10.1016/0001-8708(87)90055-7| issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1987.

Suppose the interval [0,1] is a [[fair cake-cutting|cake]]. There are ''k'' partners and each of the ''k'' functions is a value-density function of one partner. We want to divide the cake to two parts such that ''all'' partners agree that the parts have the same value. The Hobby-Rice theorem implies that this can be done with ''k'' cuts.

In [[mathematics]] in [[complex analysis]], the concept of '''holomorphic separability''' is a measure of the richness of the set of [[holomorphic function]]s on a [[complex manifold]] or [[complex-analytic space]].

==Formal definition==
A [[complex manifold]] or [[complex analytic space|complex space]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is said to be holomorphically separable, if whenever ''x'' ≠ ''y'' are two points in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a [[holomorphic function]] &lt;math&gt;f \in \mathcal O(X)&lt;/math&gt;, such that ''f''(''x'') ≠ ''f''(''y'').

Often one says the [[holomorphic function]]s  ''separate points''.

==Usage and examples==
*All complex manifolds that can be mapped [[injective function|injectively]] into some &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^n&lt;/math&gt; are holomorphically separable, in particular, all [[domain of a function|domain]]s in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^n&lt;/math&gt; and all [[Stein manifold]]s.
*A holomorphically separable complex manifold is not compact unless it is discrete and finite.
*The condition is part of the definition of a [[Stein manifold]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3975">In [[mathematics]], the concept of '''irreducibility''' is used in several ways.

* A [[polynomial]] over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] may be an [[irreducible polynomial]] if it cannot be factored over that field.
* In [[abstract algebra]], '''irreducible''' can be an abbreviation for [[irreducible element]] of an [[integral domain]]; for example an [[irreducible polynomial]].
*  In [[representation theory]], an '''[[irreducible representation]]''' is a nontrivial [[representation theory|representation]] with no nontrivial proper subrepresentations. Similarly, an '''irreducible module''' is another name for a [[simple module]].
* [[Absolutely irreducible]] is a term applied to mean [[irreducible]], even after any [[finite extension]] of the [[field (mathematics)|field]] of coefficients.  It applies in various situations, for example to irreducibility of a [[linear representation]], or of an [[algebraic variety]]; where it means just the same as ''irreducible over an [[algebraic closure]]''.
* In [[commutative algebra]], a [[commutative ring]] ''R'' is irreducible if its [[prime spectrum]], that is, the topological space Spec ''R'', is an [[irreducible topological space]].
* A [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] is irreducible if it is not [[similar matrix|similar]] via a [[permutation matrix|permutation]] to a [[block matrix|block]] [[upper triangular matrix]] (that has more than one block of positive size).  (Replacing non-zero entries in the matrix by one, and viewing the matrix as the adjacency matrix of a [[directed graph]], the matrix is irreducible if and only if such directed graph is [[Connectivity (graph theory)|strongly connected]].)
* Also, a [[Markov chain]] is [[Markov chain#Reducibility|irreducible]] if there is a non-zero probability of transitioning (even if in more than one step) from any state to any other state.
* In the theory of [[manifold]]s, an ''n''-manifold is [[irreducible manifold|irreducible]] if any embedded (''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)-sphere bounds an embedded ''n''-ball.  Implicit in this definition is the use of a suitable [[category (mathematics)|category]], such as the category of differentiable manifolds or the category of piecewise-linear manifolds. The notions of irreducibility in algebra and manifold theory are related.  An ''n''-manifold is called [[Connected sum|prime]], if it cannot be written as a [[connected sum]] of two ''n''-manifolds (neither of which is an ''n''-sphere). An irreducible manifold is thus prime, although the converse does not hold.  From an algebraist's perspective, prime manifolds should be called "irreducible"; however, the topologist (in particular the [[3-manifold]] topologist) finds the definition above more useful.  The only compact, connected 3-manifolds that are prime but not irreducible are the trivial 2-sphere bundle over ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and the twisted 2-sphere bundle over ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.  See, for example, [[Prime decomposition (3-manifold)]].
* A [[topological space]] is [[irreducible space|irreducible]] if it is not the union of two proper closed subsets. This notion is used in [[algebraic geometry]], where spaces are equipped with the [[Zariski topology]]; it is not of much significance for [[Hausdorff space]]s. See also [[irreducible component]], [[algebraic variety]].
* In [[universal algebra]], irreducible can refer to the inability to represent an [[algebraic structure]] as a composition of simpler structures using a product construction; for example [[subdirectly irreducible]].
* A [[3-manifold]] is [[P²-irreducible]] if it is irreducible and contains no [[2-sided]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb RP^2&lt;/math&gt; ([[real projective plane]]).
* An [[irreducible fraction]] (or fraction in lowest terms) is a [[vulgar fraction]] in which the [[numerator]] and [[denominator]] are smaller than those in any other equivalent fraction.

In [[string theory]], '''K-theory classification''' refers to a conjectured application of [[K-theory]] (in [[abstract algebra]] and [[algebraic topology]]) to superstrings, to classify the allowed [[Ramond–Ramond field]] strengths as well as the charges of stable [[D-branes]].

In [[condensed matter physics]] K-theory has also found important applications, specially in the topological classification of [[topological insulator]]s, superconductors and stable Fermi surfaces ({{harvtxt|Kitaev|2009}}, {{harvtxt|Horava|2005}}).

== History ==

This conjecture, applied to D-brane charges, was first proposed by {{harvtxt|Minasian|Moore|1997}}.  It was popularized by {{harvtxt|Witten|1998}} who demonstrated that in [[type IIB]] string theory arises naturally from [[Ashoke Sen]]'s realization of arbitrary D-brane configurations as stacks of [[D9-brane|D9]] and anti-D9-branes after [[tachyon condensation]].

Such stacks of branes are inconsistent in a non-torsion [[Kalb–Ramond field|Neveu–Schwarz (NS) 3-form]] background, which, as was highlighted by {{harvtxt|Kapustin|2000}}, complicates the extension of the K-theory classification to such cases. {{harvtxt|Bouwknegt|Varghese|2000}} suggested a solution to this problem: D-branes are in general classified by a [[twisted K-theory]], that had earlier been defined by {{harvtxt|Rosenberg|1989}}.

== Applications ==

The K-theory classification of D-branes has had numerous applications.  For example, {{harvtxt|Hanany|Kol|2000}} used it to argue that there are eight species of [[orientifold]] one-plane. {{harvtxt|Uranga|2001}} applied the K-theory classification to derive new consistency conditions for [[Compactification (physics)#Flux compactification|flux compactification]]s.  K-theory has also been used to conjecture a formula for the topologies of [[T-duality|T-dual]] manifolds by {{harvtxt|Bouwknegt|Evslin|Varghese|2004}}.  Recently K-theory has been conjectured to classify the [[spinors]] in [[compactification (physics)|compactification]]s on [[generalized complex manifold]]s.

=== Open problems ===

Despite these successes, [[Ramond–Ramond field|RR fluxes]] are not quite classified by K-theory.  {{harvtxt|Diaconescu|Moore|Witten|2003}} argued that the K-theory classification is incompatible with [[S-duality]] in [[Type II string theory|IIB string theory]].

In addition, if one attempts to classify fluxes on a compact ten-dimensional spacetime, then a complication arises due to the self-duality of the RR fluxes.  The duality uses the [[Hodge star]], which depends on the metric and so is continuously valued and in particular is generically irrational.  Thus not all of the RR fluxes, which are interpreted as the [[Chern character]]s in K-theory, can be rational.  However Chern characters are always rational, and so the K-theory classification must be replaced.  One needs to choose a half of the fluxes to quantize, or a ''polarization'' in the [[geometric quantization]]-inspired language of Diaconescu, Moore, and Witten and later of {{harvtxt|Varghese|Sati|2004}}. Alternately one may use the K-theory of a 9-dimensional [[time]] slice as has been done by {{harvtxt|Maldacena|Moore|Seiberg|2001}}.

==K-theory classification of RR fluxes==

In the classical limit of [[type II string theory]], which is type II [[supergravity]], the [[Ramond–Ramond field|Ramond–Ramond field strengths]] are [[differential forms]].  In the quantum theory the well-definedness of the partition functions of D-branes implies that the RR field strengths obey [[magnetic monopole#Dirac's quantization|Dirac quantization conditions]] when [[spacetime]] is [[compact space|compact]], or when a spatial slice is compact and one considers only the (magnetic) components of the field strength which lie along the spatial directions.  This led twentieth century physicists to classify RR field strengths using [[cohomology]] with integral coefficients.

However some authors have argued that the cohomology of spacetime with integral coefficients is too big.  For example, in the presence of Neveu–Schwarz H-flux or non-spin cycles some RR fluxes dictate the presence of D-branes.  In the former case this is a consequence of the supergravity equation of motion which states that the product of a RR flux with the NS 3-form is a D-brane charge density.  Thus the set of topologically distinct RR field strengths that can exist in brane-free configurations is only a subset of the cohomology with integral coefficients.

This subset is still too big, because some of these classes are related by large gauge transformations.  In QED there are large gauge transformations which add integral multiples of two pi to Wilson loops.  The p-form potentials in type II supergravity theories also enjoy these large gauge transformations, but due to the presence of [[Chern-Simons]] terms in the supergravity actions these large gauge transformations transform not only the p-form potentials but also simultaneously the (p+3)-form field strengths.  Thus to obtain the space of inequivalent field strengths from the forementioned subset of integral cohomology we must quotient by these large gauge transformations.

The [[Twisted K-theory#How to calculate it|Atiyah–Hirzebruch spectral sequence]] constructs twisted K-theory, with a twist given by the NS 3-form field strength, as a quotient of a subset of the [[cohomology]] with integral coefficients.  In the classical limit, which corresponds to working with rational coefficients, this is precisely the quotient of a subset described above in supergravity.  The quantum corrections come from torsion classes and contain mod 2 torsion corrections due to the Freed-Witten anomaly.

Thus twisted K-theory classifies the subset of RR field strengths that can exist in the absence of D-branes quotiented by large gauge transformations. Daniel Freed has attempted to extend this classification to include also the RR potentials using differential K-theory.

==K-theory classification of D-branes==

K-theory classifies D-branes in noncompact spacetimes, intuitively in spacetimes in which we are not concerned about the flux sourced by the brane having nowhere to go.  While the K-theory of a 10d spacetime classifies D-branes as subsets of that spacetime, if the spacetime is the product of time and a fixed 9-manifold then K-theory also classifies the conserved D-brane charges on each 9-dimensional spatial slice.  While we were required to forget about RR potentials to obtain the K-theory classification of RR field strengths, we are required to forget about RR field strengths to obtain the K-theory classification of D-branes.

=== K-theory charge versus BPS charge ===

As has been stressed by [[Petr Hořava (theorist)|Petr Hořava]], the K-theory classification of D-branes is independent of, and in some ways stronger than, the classification of [[Bogomol'nyi Prasad Sommerfield bound|BPS states]].  K-theory appears to classify stable D-branes missed by [[supersymmetry]] based classifications.

For example, D-branes with torsion charges, that is with charges in the order N cyclic group &lt;math&gt;\mathbf Z_N&lt;/math&gt;, attract each other and so can never be BPS.  In fact, N such branes can decay, whereas no superposition of branes that satisfy a Bogomolny bound may ever decay.  However the charge of such branes is conserved modulo N, and this is captured by the K-theory classification but not by a BPS classification.  Such torsion branes have been applied, for example, to model [[Douglas-Shenker strings]] in supersymmetric U(N) [[gauge theory|gauge theories]].

===K-theory from tachyon condensation===

[[Ashoke Sen]] has conjectured that, in the absence of a topologically nontrivial NS 3-form flux, all IIB brane configurations can be obtained from stacks of spacefilling D9 and anti D9 branes via [[tachyon condensation]].  The topology of the resulting branes is encoded in the topology of the gauge bundle on the stack of the spacefilling branes.  The topology of the gauge bundle of a stack of D9s and anti D9s can be decomposed into a gauge bundle on the D9's and another bundle on the anti D9's.  Tachyon condensation transforms such a pair of bundles to another pair in which the same bundle is direct summed with each component in the pair.  Thus the tachyon condensation invariant quantity, that is, the charge which is conserved by the tachyon condensation process, is not a pair of bundles but rather the equivalence class of a pair of bundles under direct sums of the same bundle on both sides of the pair.  This is precisely the usual construction of [[topological K-theory]].  Thus the gauge bundles on stacks of D9's and anti-D9's are classified by topological K-theory.  If Sen's conjecture is right, all D-brane configurations in type IIB are then classified by K-theory.  [[Petr Hořava (theorist)|Petr Horava]] has extended this conjecture to type IIA using D8-branes.

===Twisted K-theory from MMS instantons===

While the tachyon condensation picture of the K-theory classification classifies D-branes as subsets of a 10-dimensional spacetime with no NS 3-form flux, the Maldacena, Moore, Seiberg picture classifies stable D-branes with finite mass as subsets of a 9-dimensional spatial slice of spacetime.

The central observation is that D-branes are not classified by integral homology because Dp-branes wrapping certain cycles suffer from a Freed-Witten anomaly, which is cancelled by the insertion of D(p-2)-branes and sometimes D(p-4)-branes that end on the afflicted Dp-brane.  These inserted branes may either continue to infinity, in which case the composite object has an infinite mass, or else they may end on an anti-Dp-brane, in which case the total Dp-brane charge is zero.  In either case, one may wish to remove the anomalous Dp-branes from the spectrum, leaving only a subset of the original integral cohomology.

The inserted branes are unstable.  To see this, imagine that they extend in time away (into the past) from the anomalous brane.  This corresponds to a process in which the inserted branes decay via a Dp-brane that forms, wraps the forementioned cycle and then disappears.  MMS&lt;ref&gt;[[Juan Maldacena]], [[Greg Moore (physicist)|Gregory Moore]] and [[Nathan Seiberg]]. ''D-Brane Instantons and K-Theory Charges''. https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0108100&lt;/ref&gt; refer to this process as an instanton, although really it need not be instantonic.

The conserved charges are thus the nonanomolous subset quotiented by the unstable insertions.  This is precisely the [[Twisted K-theory#How to calculate it|Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence]] construction of twisted K-theory as a set.

==Reconciling twisted K-theory and S-duality==

Diaconescu, Moore, and Witten have pointed out that the twisted K-theory classification is not compatible with the [[S-duality]] covariance of type IIB string theory.  For example, consider the constraint on the [[Ramond–Ramond field|Ramond–Ramond 3-form field strength]] G&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in the [[Twisted K-theory#How to calculate it|Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence]] (AHSS):

:&lt;math&gt;  d_3G_3=Sq^3G_3+H\cup G_3=G_3\cup G_3+H\cup G_3=0
&lt;/math&gt;

where d&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;=Sq&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;+H is the first nontrivial differential in the AHSS, Sq&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is the third [[Steenrod square]] and the last equality follows from the fact that the nth Steenrod square acting on any n-form x is x&lt;math&gt;\cup&lt;/math&gt;x.

The above equation is not invariant under S-duality, which exchanges G&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and H.  Instead Diaconescu, Moore, and Witten have proposed the following S-duality covariant extension

:&lt;math&gt;  G_3\cup G_3+H\cup G_3+H\cup H=P
&lt;/math&gt;

where P is an unknown characteristic class that depends only on the topology, and in particular not on the fluxes. {{harvtxt|Diaconescu|Freed|Moore|2007}} have found a constraint on P using the [[ME8|E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; gauge theory approach to M-theory]] pioneered by Diaconescu, Moore, and Witten.

Thus D-branes in IIB are not classified by twisted K-theory after all, but some unknown S-duality-covariant object that inevitably also classifies both fundamental strings and [[NS5-brane]]s.

However the MMS prescription for calculating twisted K-theory is easily S-covariantized, as the Freed-Witten anomalies respect S-duality.  Thus the S-covariantized form of the MMS construction may be applied to construct the S-covariantized twisted K-theory, as a set, without knowing having any geometric description for just what this strange covariant object is.  This program has been carried out in a number of papers, such as {{harvtxt|Evslin|Varadarajan|2003}} and {{harvtxt|Evslin|2003a}}, and was also applied to the classification of fluxes by {{harvtxt|Evslin|2003b}}.  {{harvtxt|Bouwknegt|Evslin|Jurco|Varghese|2006}} use this approach to prove Diaconescu, Moore, and Witten's conjectured constraint on the 3-fluxes, and they show that there is an additional term equal to the D3-brane charge. {{harvtxt|Evslin|2006}} shows that the [[Klebanov-Strassler cascade]] of [[Seiberg duality|Seiberg dualities]] consists of a series of S-dual MMS instantons, one for each Seiberg duality.  The group, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf Z_N&lt;/math&gt; of universality classes of the &lt;math&gt;SU(M+N)\times SU(M)&lt;/math&gt; supersymmetric [[gauge theory]] is then shown to agree with the S-dual twisted K-theory and not with the original twisted K-theory.

Some authors have proposed radically different solutions to this puzzle.  For example, {{harvtxt|Kriz|Sati|2005}} propose that instead of twisted K-theory, II string theory configurations should be classified by [[elliptic cohomology]].

The Kelly Criterion is to bet a predetermined fraction of assets and can be counterintuitive. In one study,&lt;ref&gt;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2856963&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Buttonwood", [https://www.economist.com/blogs/buttonwood/2016/11/investing "Irrational tossers"], ''[[The Economist]] Newspaper Limited 2016'', Nov 1st 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; each participant was given $25 and asked to bet on a coin that would land heads 60% of the time. Participants had 30 minutes to play, so could place about 300 bets, and the prizes were capped at $250. Behavior was far from optimal. "Remarkably, 28% of the participants went bust, and the average payout was just $91. Only 21% of the participants reached the maximum. 18 of the 61 participants bet everything on one toss, while two-thirds gambled on tails at some stage in the experiment." Using the Kelly criterion and based on the odds in the experiment, the right approach would be to bet 20% of the pot on each throw (see first example [[#Statement |below]]). If losing, the size of the bet gets cut; if winning, the stake increases.

Although the Kelly strategy's promise of doing better than any other strategy in the long run seems compelling, some economists have argued strenuously against it, mainly because an individual's specific investing constraints may override the desire for optimal growth rate.&lt;ref name="Poundstone book article"&gt;{{citation |last=Poundstone |first=William|title=Fortune's Formula: The Untold Story of the Scientific Betting System That Beat the Casinos and Wall Street |year=2005 |publisher=Hill and Wang |location=New York |isbn=0-8090-4637-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The conventional alternative is [[expected utility]] theory which says bets should be sized to [[Optimization (mathematics)|maximize]] the [[Expectation-maximization algorithm|expected]] utility of the outcome (to an individual with [[logarithm]]ic utility, the Kelly bet maximizes expected utility, so there is no conflict; moreover, Kelly's original paper clearly states the need for a utility function in the case of gambling games which are played finitely many times&lt;ref name="original Kelly article"/&gt;). Even Kelly supporters usually argue for fractional Kelly (betting a fixed fraction of the amount recommended by Kelly) for a variety of practical reasons, such as wishing to reduce volatility, or protecting against non-deterministic errors in their advantage (edge) calculations.&lt;ref name="Wilmott I"&gt;{{citation |last=Thorp |first=E. O. |title=The Kelly Criterion: Part I |date=May 2008 |journal=Wilmott Magazine }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, Kelly has become a part of mainstream investment theory&lt;ref name="Handbook of Asset and Liability Management"&gt;{{citation |last=Zenios |first=S. A. |last2=Ziemba |first2=W. T. |title=Handbook of Asset and Liability Management |year=2006 |publisher=North Holland |location= |isbn=978-0-444-50875-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the claim has been made that well-known successful investors including [[Warren Buffett]]&lt;ref name="The Dhandho Investor"&gt;{{citation |last=Pabrai |first=Mohnish |title=The Dhandho Investor: The Low-Risk Value Method to High Returns |year=2007 |publisher=Wiley |location= |isbn=978-0-470-04389-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William H.

[[William Poundstone]] wrote an extensive popular account of the history of Kelly betting.&lt;ref name="Poundstone book article" /&gt;

The second-order [[Taylor series|Taylor polynomial]] can be used as a good approximation of the main criterion. Primarily, it is useful for stock investment, where the fraction devoted to investment is based on simple characteristics that can be easily estimated from existing historical data – [[expected value]] and [[variance]]. This approximation leads to results that are robust and offer similar results as the original criterion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marek|first1=Patrice|last2=Ťoupal|first2=Tomáš|last3=Vávra|first3=František|title=Efficient Distribution of Investment Capital|journal=34th International Conference Mathematical Methods in Economics, MME2016, Conference Proceedings|date=2016|pages=540–545|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308919565_Efficient_Distribution_of_Investment_Capital|accessdate=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Statement ==

For simple bets with two outcomes, one involving losing the entire amount bet, and the other involving winning the bet amount multiplied by the payoff [[odds]], the Kelly bet is:

:&lt;math&gt; f^{*} = \frac{bp - q}{b} = \frac{p(b + 1) - 1}{b} &lt;/math&gt;

where:

* ''f'' * is the fraction of the current bankroll to wager, i.e. how much to bet;
* ''b'' is the net odds received on the wager ("''b'' to 1"); that is, you could win $b (on top of getting back your $1 wagered) for a $1 bet
* ''p'' is the probability of winning;
* ''q'' is the probability of losing, which is 1 − ''p''.

As an example, if a gamble has a 60% chance of winning (''p''&amp;nbsp;= 0.60, ''q''&amp;nbsp;= 0.40), and the gambler receives 1-to-1 odds on a winning bet (''b''&amp;nbsp;= 1), then the gambler should bet 20% of the bankroll at each opportunity (''f''*&amp;nbsp;= 0.20), in order to maximize the long-run growth rate of the bankroll.

{{anchor | zeroedge }} If the gambler has zero edge, i.e. if ''b'' = ''q'' / ''p'', then the criterion recommends the gambler bets nothing.

If the edge is negative (''b'' &amp;lt; ''q'' / ''p'') the formula gives a negative result, indicating that the gambler should take the other side of the bet. For example, in standard American roulette, the bettor is offered an even money payoff (b = 1) on red, when there are 18 red numbers and 20 non-red numbers on the wheel (p = 18/38). The Kelly bet is -1/19, meaning the gambler should bet one-nineteenth of their bankroll that red will ''not'' come up. Unfortunately, the casino doesn't allow betting ''against'' something coming up, so a Kelly gambler cannot place a bet.

The top of the first fraction is the expected net winnings from a $1 bet, since the two outcomes are that you either win $''b'' with probability ''p'', or lose the $1 wagered, i.e. win $-1, with probability ''q''. Hence:
: &lt;math&gt; f^{*} = \frac{\text{expected net winnings}}{\text{net winnings if you win}} &lt;/math&gt;

For even-money bets (i.e. when ''b''&amp;nbsp;= 1), the first formula can be simplified to:
: &lt;math&gt; f^{*} = p - q . &lt;/math&gt;
Since q = 1-p, this simplifies further to
: &lt;math&gt; f^{*} = 2p - 1 . &lt;/math&gt;

A more general problem relevant for investment decisions is the following:

1. The probability of success is &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.

2. If you succeed, the value of your investment increases from &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;1+b&lt;/math&gt;.

3. If you fail (for which the probability is &lt;math&gt;q=1-p&lt;/math&gt;) the value of your investment decreases from &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;1-a&lt;/math&gt;. (Note that the previous description above assumes that ''a'' is 1).

In this case, the Kelly criterion turns out to be the relatively simple expression

: &lt;math&gt; f^{*} = p/a - q/b . &lt;/math&gt;

Note that this reduces to the original expression for the special case above (&lt;math&gt;f^{*}=p-q&lt;/math&gt;) for &lt;math&gt;b=a=1&lt;/math&gt;.

Clearly, in order to decide in favor of investing at least a small amount &lt;math&gt;(f^{*}&gt;0)&lt;/math&gt;, you must have

: &lt;math&gt; p b &gt;  q a . &lt;/math&gt;

which obviously is nothing more than the fact that your expected profit must exceed the expected loss for the investment to make any sense.

The general result clarifies why leveraging (taking a loan to invest) decreases the optimal fraction to be invested, as in that case &lt;math&gt;a&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;. Obviously, no matter how large the probability of success, &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, is, if &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is sufficiently large, the optimal fraction to invest is zero. Thus, using too much margin is not a good investment strategy, no matter how good an investor you are.

== Proof ==
Heuristic proofs of the Kelly criterion are straightforward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Press | first1=WH | last2=Teukolsky | first2=SA | last3=Vetterling | first3=WT | last4=Flannery | first4=BP | year=2007 | title=Numerical Recipes: The Art of Scientific Computing | edition=3rd | publisher=Cambridge University Press |  publication-place=New York | isbn=978-0-521-88068-8 | chapter=Section 14.7 (Example 2.) | chapter-url=http://apps.nrbook.com/empanel/index.html#pg=757}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For a symbolic verification with [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and [[SymPy]] one would set the derivative y'(x) of the expected value of the logarithmic bankroll y(x) to 0 and solve for ''x'':

&lt;source lang="python"&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; from sympy import *
&gt;&gt;&gt; x,b,p = symbols('x b p')
&gt;&gt;&gt; y = p*log(1+b*x) + (1-p)*log(1-x)
&gt;&gt;&gt; solve(diff(y,x), x)
[-(1 - p - b*p)/b]
&lt;/source&gt;

The Kelly criterion maximises the expectation of the logarithm of wealth (the expectation value of a function is given by the sum of the probabilities of particular outcomes multiplied by the value of the function in the event of that outcome). We start with 1 unit of wealth and bet a fraction &lt;math&gt; f^{*} &lt;/math&gt; of that wealth on an outcome that occurs with probability &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt; and offers odds of &lt;math&gt; b &lt;/math&gt;. The probability of winning is &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt;, and in that case the wealth is equal to &lt;math&gt; 1+f^{*}b &lt;/math&gt;. The probability of losing is &lt;math&gt; 1-p &lt;/math&gt;, and in that case the wealth is equal to &lt;math&gt; 1-f^{*} &lt;/math&gt;. Therefore our expectation value for log wealth &lt;math&gt; (E) &lt;/math&gt; is given by: 

&lt;math&gt; E=p \log(1+f^{*}b)+(1-p) \log(1-f^{*}) &lt;/math&gt;

To find the value of &lt;math&gt; f^{*} &lt;/math&gt; for which the expectation value is maximised, we differentiate the above expression and set this equal to zero. This gives:

&lt;math&gt; \frac{dE}{df^{*}}=\frac{pb}{1+f^{*}b}-\frac{1-p}{1-f^{*}}=0 &lt;/math&gt;

Rearranging this equation for &lt;math&gt; f^{*} &lt;/math&gt; gives the Kelly criterion:

&lt;math&gt; f^{*}=\frac{pb+p-1}{b} &lt;/math&gt;

For a rigorous and general proof, see [[John Larry Kelly, Jr|Kelly's]] original paper&lt;ref name="original Kelly article" /&gt; or some of the other references listed below. Some corrections have been published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Thorp | first1 = E. O.  | authorlink1 = Edward O.

We give the following non-rigorous argument for the case b = 1 (a 50:50 "even money" bet) to show the general idea and provide some insights.&lt;ref name="original Kelly article" /&gt;

When ''b'' = 1, the Kelly bettor bets 2''p'' - 1 times initial wealth, ''W'', as shown above. If they win, they have 2''pW''. If they lose, they have 2(1 - ''p'')''W''. Suppose they make ''N'' bets like this, and win ''K'' of them. The order of the wins and losses doesn't matter, so they will have:

: &lt;math&gt; 2^Np^K(1-p)^{N-K}W \! .&lt;/math&gt;

Suppose another bettor bets a different amount, (2''p'' - 1 + &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;)W for some positive or negative &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;. They will have (2p + &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;)''W'' after a win and [2(1 - ''p'')- &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;]''W'' after a loss. After the same wins and losses as the Kelly bettor, they will have:

: &lt;math&gt; (2p+\Delta)^K[2(1-p)-\Delta]^{N-K}W &lt;/math&gt;

Take the derivative of this with respect to &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; and get:

: &lt;math&gt; K(2p+\Delta)^{K-1}[2(1-p)-\Delta]^{N-K}W-(N-K)(2p+\Delta)^K[2(1-p)-\Delta]^{N-K-1}W&lt;/math&gt;

The turning point of the original function occurs when this derivative equals zero, which occurs at:

: &lt;math&gt; K[2(1-p)-\Delta]=(N-K)(2p+\Delta) &lt;/math&gt;

which implies:

: &lt;math&gt; \Delta=2(\frac{K}{N}-p) &lt;/math&gt;

but:

: &lt;math&gt; \lim_{N \to +\infty}\frac{K}{N}=p &lt;/math&gt;

so in the long run, final wealth is maximized by setting &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; to zero, which means following the Kelly strategy.

This illustrates that Kelly has both a deterministic and a stochastic component. If one knows K and N and wishes to pick a constant fraction of wealth to bet each time (otherwise one could cheat and, for example, bet zero after the K&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; win knowing that the rest of the bets will lose), one will end up with the most money if one bets:

: &lt;math&gt; \left(2\frac{K}{N}-1\right)W &lt;/math&gt;

each time. This is true whether ''N'' is small or large. The "long run" part of Kelly is necessary because K is not known in advance, just that as ''N'' gets large, ''K'' will approach ''pN''. Someone who bets more than Kelly can do better if {{nowrap|''K'' &gt; ''pN''}} for a stretch; someone who bets less than Kelly can do better if {{nowrap|''K ''&lt; ''pN''}} for a stretch, but in the long run, Kelly always wins.

The heuristic proof for the general case proceeds as follows.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

In a single trial, if you invest the fraction &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; of your capital, if your strategy succeeds, your capital at the end of the trial increases by the factor &lt;math&gt;1-f + f(1+b) = 1+fb&lt;/math&gt;, and, likewise, if the strategy fails, you end up having your capital decreased by the factor &lt;math&gt;1-fa&lt;/math&gt;. Thus at the end of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; trials (with &lt;math&gt;pN&lt;/math&gt; successes and &lt;math&gt;qN&lt;/math&gt; failures ), the starting capital of $1 yields

: &lt;math&gt;C_N=(1+fb)^{pN}(1-fa)^{qN}.&lt;/math&gt;

Maximizing &lt;math&gt;\log(C_N)/N&lt;/math&gt;, and consequently &lt;math&gt;C_N&lt;/math&gt;, with respect to &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; leads to the desired result

: &lt;math&gt;f^{*}=p/a-q/b .&lt;/math&gt;

For a more detailed discussion of this formula for the general case, see.&lt;ref name="edwardothorp.com"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.edwardothorp.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/KellyCriterion2007.pdf |title=THE KELLY CRITERION IN BLACKJACK, SPORTS BETTING, AND THE STOCK MARKET by Edward O.

In brief, betting &lt;math&gt;f^{*}&lt;/math&gt; each time will likely maximize the wealth growth rate only in the case where the number of trials is very large, and &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are the same for each trial. In practice, this is a matter of playing the same game over and over, where the probability of winning and the payoff odds are always the same.  In the heuristic proof above, &lt;math&gt;pN&lt;/math&gt; successes and &lt;math&gt;qN&lt;/math&gt; failures are highly likely only for very large &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;.

== Bernoulli ==

In a 1738 article, [[Daniel Bernoulli]] suggested that, when one has a choice of bets or investments, one should choose that with the highest [[geometric mean]] of outcomes. This is mathematically equivalent to the Kelly criterion, although the motivation is entirely different (Bernoulli wanted to resolve the [[St. Petersburg paradox]]).

The Bernoulli article was not translated into [[English (language)|English]] until 1954,&lt;ref name="Bernoulli translation"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bernoulli | first1 = Daniel | authorlink1 = Daniel Bernoulli | year = 1954 |origyear=1738 | title = Exposition of a New Theory on the Measurement of Risk | journal = [[Econometrica]] | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 22–36 | publisher = The Econometric Society | jstor = 1909829 | url =  | format =  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the work was well-known among mathematicians and economists.

== Multiple horses ==
Kelly's criterion may be generalized 
&lt;ref name="many horses"&gt;Smoczynski, Peter; Tomkins, Dave (2010) "An explicit solution to the problem of optimizing the allocations of a bettor’s wealth when wagering on horse races", Mathematical Scientist", 35 (1), 10-17&lt;/ref&gt; on gambling on many mutually exclusive outcomes, such as in horse races. Suppose there are several mutually exclusive outcomes. The probability that the k-th horse wins the race is &lt;math&gt;p_k&lt;/math&gt;, the total amount of bets placed on k-th horse is &lt;math&gt;B_k&lt;/math&gt;, and 
:&lt;math&gt;\beta_k=\frac{B_k}{\sum_i B_i}=\frac{1}{1+Q_k} ,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;Q_k&lt;/math&gt; are the pay-off odds. &lt;math&gt;D=1-tt&lt;/math&gt;, is the dividend rate where &lt;math&gt;tt&lt;/math&gt; is the track take or tax, &lt;math&gt;\frac{D}{\beta_k}&lt;/math&gt; is the revenue rate after deduction of the track take when k-th horse wins. The fraction of the bettor's funds to bet on k-th horse is &lt;math&gt;f_k&lt;/math&gt;. Kelly's criterion for gambling with multiple mutually exclusive outcomes gives an algorithm for finding the optimal set &lt;math&gt;S^o&lt;/math&gt; of outcomes on which it is reasonable to bet and it gives explicit formula for finding the optimal fractions &lt;math&gt;f^o_k&lt;/math&gt; of bettor's wealth to be bet on the outcomes included in the optimal set &lt;math&gt;S^o&lt;/math&gt;. 
The algorithm for the optimal set of outcomes consists of four steps.&lt;ref name="many horses"/&gt;

Step 1 Calculate the expected revenue rate for all possible (or only for several of the most promising) outcomes:
&lt;math&gt;er_k=\frac{D}{\beta_k}p_k=D(1+Q_k)p_k.&lt;/math&gt;

Step 2 Reorder the outcomes so that the new sequence &lt;math&gt;er_k&lt;/math&gt; is non-increasing.  Thus &lt;math&gt;er_1&lt;/math&gt; will be the best bet.

Step 3 Set &lt;math&gt; S = \varnothing &lt;/math&gt; (the empty set), &lt;math&gt;k = 1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R(S)=1&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus the best bet &lt;math&gt;er_k = er_1&lt;/math&gt; will be considered first.

Step 4 Repeat:

If &lt;math&gt;er_k=\frac{D}{\beta_k}p_k &gt; R(S)&lt;/math&gt; then insert k-th outcome into the set: &lt;math&gt;S = S \cup \{k\}&lt;/math&gt;, recalculate &lt;math&gt;R(S)&lt;/math&gt; according to the formula: 
&lt;math&gt;R(S)=\frac{1-\sum_{i \in S}{p_i}}{1-\sum_{i \in S } \frac{\beta_i}{D}}&lt;/math&gt;  and then set &lt;math&gt;k = k+1 &lt;/math&gt;,

Else set &lt;math&gt;S^o=S&lt;/math&gt; and then stop the repetition.

If the optimal set &lt;math&gt;S^o&lt;/math&gt; is empty then do not bet at all. If the set &lt;math&gt;S^o&lt;/math&gt; of optimal outcomes is not empty then the optimal fraction &lt;math&gt;f^o_k&lt;/math&gt; to bet on k-th outcome may be calculated from this formula: &lt;math&gt;f^o_k=\frac{er_k - R(S^o)}{\frac{D}{\beta_k}}=p_k-\frac{R(S^o)}{\frac{D}{\beta_k}}&lt;/math&gt;.

One may prove&lt;ref name="many horses"/&gt; that 
:&lt;math&gt;R(S^o)=1-\sum_{i \in S^o}{f^o_i}&lt;/math&gt;
where the right hand-side is the reserve rate{{clarify|reason=not mentioned before|date=June 2012}}. Therefore the requirement &lt;math&gt;er_k=\frac{D}{\beta_k}p_k &gt; R(S)&lt;/math&gt; may be interpreted&lt;ref name="many horses"/&gt; as follows: k-th outcome is included in the set &lt;math&gt;S^o&lt;/math&gt; of optimal outcomes if and only if its expected revenue rate is greater than the reserve rate. The formula for the optimal fraction &lt;math&gt;f^o_k&lt;/math&gt; may be interpreted as the excess of the expected revenue rate of k-th horse over the reserve rate divided by the revenue after deduction of the track take when k-th horse wins or as the excess of the probability of k-th horse winning over the reserve rate divided by revenue after deduction of the track take when k-th horse wins. The binary growth exponent is
 
:&lt;math&gt;G^o=\sum_{i \in S}{p_i\log_2{(er_i)}}+(1-\sum_{i \in S}{p_i})\log_2{(R(S^o))} ,&lt;/math&gt; 
and the doubling time is
:&lt;math&gt;T_d=\frac{1}{G^o}.&lt;/math&gt;

This method of selection of optimal bets may be applied also when probabilities &lt;math&gt;p_k&lt;/math&gt; are known only for several most promising outcomes, while the remaining outcomes have no chance to win. In this case it must be that &lt;math&gt;\sum_i{p_i} &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sum_i{\beta_i} &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;.

== Application to the stock market ==

=== Single asset ===
Considering a single asset (stock, index fund, etc.) and a risk-free rate, it is easy to obtain the optimal fraction to invest through [[geometric Brownian motion]]. 

The value of a lognormally distributed asset &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;S_t&lt;/math&gt;) is

: &lt;math&gt; S_t = S_0\exp\left( \left(\mu - \frac{\sigma^2}{2} \right)t + \sigma W_t\right),&lt;/math&gt;
from the solution of the geometric Brownian motion where &lt;math&gt; W_t &lt;/math&gt; is a [[Wiener process]], and &lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt; (percentage drift) and &lt;math&gt; \sigma &lt;/math&gt; (the percentage volatility) are constants. Taking expectations of the logarithm:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E} \log(S_t)=\log(S_0)+(\mu- \frac {\sigma^2}{2})t.&lt;/math&gt;

Then the expected log return &lt;math&gt;R_s&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;R_s = \left(\mu -\frac{\sigma^2}{2}\,\right) t.&lt;/math&gt;

For a portfolio made of an asset &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and a bond paying risk-free rate &lt;math&gt;r,&lt;/math&gt; with fraction &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; invested in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(1-f)&lt;/math&gt; in the bond, the expected rate of return &lt;math&gt;G(f)&lt;/math&gt; is given by

:&lt;math&gt;G(f) = f\mu - \frac {(f\sigma)^2}{2} + ((1-f)\ r).&lt;/math&gt;

Solving &lt;math&gt;\max (G(f))&lt;/math&gt; we obtain

:&lt;math&gt;f^* = \frac {\mu - r} {\sigma^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;f^*&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction that maximizes the return, and so, is the Kelly fraction.

Thorp&lt;ref name="edwardothorp.com"/&gt; arrived at the same result but through a different derivation.

Remember that &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is different from the asset log return &lt;math&gt;R_s&lt;/math&gt;. Confusing this is a common mistake made by websites and articles talking about the Kelly Criterion.

=== Many assets ===
Consider a market with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; correlated stocks &lt;math&gt;S_k&lt;/math&gt; with stochastic returns &lt;math&gt;r_k&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;k= 1,...,n,&lt;/math&gt; and a riskless bond with 
return &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;. An investor puts a fraction &lt;math&gt;u_k&lt;/math&gt; of their capital in &lt;math&gt;S_k&lt;/math&gt; and the rest is invested in the bond. Without loss of generality, assume that investor's starting capital is equal to 1. 
According to the Kelly criterion one should maximize
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}\left[ \ln\left((1 + r) + \sum\limits_{k=1}^n  u_k(r_k -r) \right) \right].&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Expanding this with the Taylor series around &lt;math&gt;\vec{u_0} = (0, \ldots ,0)&lt;/math&gt; we obtain 
&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E} \left[ \ln(1+r) + \sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} \frac{u_k(r_k - r)}{1+r} -
\frac{1}{2}\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n} u_k u_j \frac{(r_k
-r)(r_j - r)}{(1+r)^2} \right].&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Thus we reduce the optimization problem to [[quadratic programming]] and the unconstrained solution
is 
:&lt;math&gt;
\vec{u^{\star}} = (1+r) (  \widehat{\Sigma} )^{-1} ( \widehat{\vec{r}} - r )
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\vec{r}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\Sigma}&lt;/math&gt; are the vector of means and the matrix of second mixed noncentral moments of the excess returns.
There is also a numerical algorithm for the fractional Kelly strategies and for the optimal solution under no leverage and no short selling constraints.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2259133 Nekrasov, Vasily(2013) "Kelly Criterion for Multivariate Portfolios: A Model-Free Approach"]&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Convex function]] - a function in which the line segment between any two points on the graph of the function lies above the graph.
** [[Closed convex function]] - a convex function whose every the sublevel set is a closed set.
** [[Proper convex function]] - a convex function whose effective domain is nonempty and it never attains minus infinity.
** [[Concave function]] - the negative of a convex function.
* [[Convex geometry]] - the branch of geometry studying convex sets, mainly in Euclidean space. Contains three sub-branches: general convexity, polytopes and polyhedra, and discrete geometry.
* [[Convex hull]] (aka ''convex envelope'') - the smallest convex set that contains a given set of points in Euclidean space.
* [[Convex lens]] - a lens in which one or two sides is curved or bowed outwards. Light passing through the lens is converged (or focused) to a spot behind the lens.
* [[Convex optimization]] - a subfield of optimization, studies the problem of minimizing convex functions over convex sets. The convexity property can make optimization in some sense "easier" than the general case - for example, any local minimum must be a global minimum.

When the price of an underlying variable changes, the price of an output does not change linearly, but depends on the higher-order derivatives of the modeling function. Geometrically, the model is no longer flat but curved, and the degree of curvature is called the convexity.

Formally, an infinite sequence of words ''w''(''n'') is locally catenative if, for some positive integers ''k'' and ''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...''i''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;w(n)=w(n-i_1)w(n-i_2)\ldots w(n-i_k) \text{ for } n \ge \max\{i_1, \ldots, i_k\} \, .&lt;/math&gt;

Some authors use a slightly different definition in which encodings of previous words are allowed in the concatenation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Examples==
The sequence of [[Fibonacci word]]s ''S''(''n'') is locally catenative because
:&lt;math&gt;S(n)=S(n-1)S(n-2) \text{ for } n \ge 2 \, .&lt;/math&gt;

The sequence of [[Thue–Morse sequence|Thue–Morse words]] ''T''(''n'') is not locally catenative by the first definition. However, it is locally catenative by the second definition because
:&lt;math&gt;T(n)=T(n-1)\mu(T(n-1)) \text{ for } n \ge 1 \, ,&lt;/math&gt;
where the encoding ''&amp;mu;'' replaces 0 with 1 and 1 with&amp;nbsp;0.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3244">In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[complex analysis]], the '''Looman–Menchoff theorem''' states that a [[continuous function|continuous]] [[complex number|complex]]-valued function defined in an [[open set]] of the [[complex plane]] is [[Holomorphic function|holomorphic]] if and only if it satisfies the [[Cauchy–Riemann equations]].  It is thus a generalization of a theorem by [[Édouard Goursat]], which instead of assuming the continuity of ''f'', assumes its [[Fréchet derivative|Fréchet differentiability]] when regarded as a function from a subset of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

A complete statement of the theorem is as follows:

* Let Ω be an open set in '''C''' and ''f'' : Ω → '''C''' is a continuous function.  Suppose that the [[partial derivative]]s &lt;math&gt;\partial f/\partial x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\partial f/\partial y&lt;/math&gt; exist everywhere but a countable set in&amp;nbsp;Ω.  Then ''f'' is holomorphic if and only if it satisfies the Cauchy–Riemann equation:
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial f}{\partial\bar{z}} = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} + i\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right)=0.&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==

Looman pointed out that the function given by ''f''(''z'') = exp(−''z''&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;) for ''z''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0, ''f''(0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 satisfies the Cauchy–Riemann equations everywhere but is not analytic (or even continuous) at&amp;nbsp;''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. This shows that the function ''f'' must be assumed continuous in the theorem.

The function given by ''f''(''z'') = ''z''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;/|''z''|&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; for ''z''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0, ''f''(0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 is continuous everywhere and satisfies the Cauchy–Riemann equations at ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, but is not analytic at ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 (or anywhere else). This shows that a naive generalization of Looman–Menchoff-like theorem to a single point, is false.

* If ''f'' is continuous at a neighborhood of a point ''z'', and &lt;math&gt;\partial f/\partial x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\partial f/\partial y&lt;/math&gt; exist at ''z''.  Then ''f'' is holomorphic at ''z'' if and only if it satisfies the Cauchy–Riemann equation at ''z''.

A '''loop''' in [[mathematics]], in a [[topological space]] ''X'' is a [[continuous function]] ''f'' from the [[unit interval]] ''I'' = [0,1] to ''X'' such that ''f''(0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''f''(1). In other words, it is a [[path (topology)|path]] whose initial point is equal to the terminal point.&lt;ref name="ils"&gt;{{citation|title=Infinite Loop Spaces|volume=90|series=Annals of mathematics studies|first=John Frank|last=Adams|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|year=1978|isbn=9780691082066|page=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e2rYkg9lGnsC&amp;pg=PA3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A loop may also be seen as a continuous map ''f'' from the [[Pointed space|pointed]] [[unit circle]] ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; into ''X'', because ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; may be regarded as a [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient]] of ''I'' under the identification of 0 with 1.

The set of all loops in ''X'' forms a space called the [[loop space]] of ''X''.&lt;ref name="ils"/&gt;

'''Many antennas'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=Hassibi, B. Hochwald, B. Shokrollahi, A.   Sweldens, W. |title=Codes for differential signaling with many antennas|booktitle=Wireless Communications and Networking Conference, 2000. WCNC. 2000 IEEE|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[smart antenna]] technique which overcomes the performance limitation of single user [[MIMO|multiple-input multiple-output]] (MIMO) techniques. In [[cellular communication]], the maximum number of considered antennas for downlink is 2 and 4 to support [[3GPP Long Term Evolution]] (LTE) and [[IMT Advanced]] requirements, respectively.  Since the available spectrum band will probably be limited while the [[Bit rate|data rate]] requirement will continuously increase beyond IMT-A to support the mobile multimedia services, it is highly probable that the number of transmit antennas at the base station must be increased to 8–64 or more. The installation of many antennas at single base stations introduced many challenges and required development of several high technologies:  a new SDMA engine, a new [[beamforming]] algorithm and a new antenna array.

* New [[space-division multiple access]] (SDMA) engine: [[multi-user MIMO]], network MIMO, coordinate multi-point transmission (COMP) ([[Cooperative diversity]]), remote radio equipments (RRE).
* New beam-forming: linear beam-forming such as MF, ZF and MMSE and non-linear beam-forming ([[precoding]]) such as Tomlinson-Harashima precoding (THP), vector perturbation (VP), and [[Dirty paper coding]] (DPC).
* New antenna array: direct, remote and wireless antenna array.
** Direct antenna array: linear and 3D phased array, new structure array, and dynamic antenna array.
** Remote and wireless antenna array: distributed antenna array and cooperative beam-forming.
* Multiple air interfaces: single chip antenna array for an energy efficient short-range transmission.

'''Mechanical counters''' are [[counter (digital)|digital counters]] built using mechanical components. Long before electronics became common, mechanical devices were used to count events. They typically consist of a series of disks mounted on an axle, with the digits zero through nine marked on their edge. The right most disk moves one increment with each event. Each disk except the left-most has a protrusion that, after the completion of one revolution, moves the next disk to the left one increment. Such counters were used as [[odometer]]s for bicycles and cars and in [[tape recorders]] and [[fuel dispenser]]s and to control manufacturing processes. One of the largest manufacturers was the Veeder-Root company, and their name was often used for this type of counter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.veeder.com/page/vr_history | title = VR History | publisher = Veeder}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Mechanical counters can be made into '''electromechanical counters''', that count electrical impulses, by adding a small [[solenoid]].

==History==
[[File:Han dynasty odometer cart.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Han Dynasty]] stone rubbing of a horse-drawn odometer cart.]]
An odometer for measuring distance was first described by [[Vitruvius]] around 27 and 23 BC, although the actual inventor may have been [[Archimedes of Syracuse]] (c. 287 BC – c. 212 BC). It was based on chariot wheels turning 400 times in one Roman [[mile]]. For each revolution a pin on the axle engaged a 400 tooth cogwheel, thus turning it one complete revolution per mile. This engaged another gear with holes along the circumference, where pebbles (''[[calculus]]'') were located, that were to drop one by one into a box. The distance traveled would thus be given simply by counting the number of pebbles.&lt;ref name="autogenerated188"&gt;Sleeswyk, Andre, ''Vitruvius' odometer'', Scientific American, vol. 252, no. 4, pages 188-200 (October 1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

The odometer was also independently invented in [[History of Science and Technology in China|ancient China]], possibly by the profuse inventor and early scientist [[Zhang Heng]] (78 AD – 139 AD) of the [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC–220 AD). By the 3rd century (during the [[Three Kingdoms]] Period), the Chinese had termed the device as the 'jì lĭ gŭ chē' (記里鼓車), or '[[li (unit)|li]]-recording drum carriage'&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 281"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, 281.&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese texts of the 3rd century tell of the mechanical carriage's functions, and as one li is traversed, a mechanical-driven wooden figure strikes a drum, and when ten li is traversed, another wooden figure would strike a gong or a bell with its mechanical-operated arm.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 281"/&gt;

In [[graph theory]] and [[theoretical computer science]], the '''monochromatic triangle problem''' is an algorithmic problem on graphs,
in which the goal is to partition the edges of a given graph into two [[triangle-free graph|triangle-free]] subgraphs. It is [[NP-complete]] but [[fixed-parameter tractable]] on graphs of bounded [[treewidth]].

==Problem statement==
The monochromatic triangle problem takes as input an n-node undirected graph G(V,E) with node set V and edge set E.
The output is a Boolean value, true if the edge set E of G can be partitioned into two disjoint sets E1 and E2, such that both of the two subgraphs G1(V,E1) and G2(V,E2) are [[triangle-free graph]]s, and false otherwise. This [[decision problem]] is [[NP-complete]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Garey | first1=Michael R. | author1-link=Michael Garey | last2=Johnson | first2=David S. | author2-link=David S. Johnson | title=Computers and Intractability: A Guide to the Theory of NP-Completeness | publisher=W. H. Freeman | isbn=978-0-7167-1045-5 | year=1979}}. A1.1: GT6, pg.191.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generalization to multiple colors==
The problem may be generalized to '''triangle-free edge coloring''', finding an assignment of colors to the edges of a graph so that no triangle has all three edges given the same color. The monochromatic triangle problem is the special case of triangle-free edge-coloring when there are exactly two colors available. If there exists a two-color triangle-free edge coloring, then the edges of each color form the two sets E1 and E2 of the monochromatic triangle problem. Conversely, if the monochromatic triangle problem has a solution, we can use one color for E1 and a second color for E2 to obtain a triangle-free edge coloring.

==Connection to Ramsey's theorem==
By [[Ramsey's theorem]], for any finite number ''k'' of colors, there exists a number ''n'' such that complete graphs of ''n'' or more vertices do not have triangle-free edge colorings with ''k'' colors. For ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, the corresponding value of ''n'' is 6. I.e., the answer to the monochromatic triangle problem on the complete graph ''K''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is no.

==Parameterized complexity==
It is straightforward to express the monochromatic triangle problem in the [[monadic second-order logic|monadic second-order]] [[logic of graphs]] (MSO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), by a logical formula that asserts the existence of a partition of the edges into two subsets such that there do not exist three mutually adjacent vertices whose edges all belong to the same side of the partition. It follows from [[Courcelle's theorem]] that the monochromatic triangle problem is [[fixed-parameter tractable]] on graphs of bounded [[treewidth]]. More precisely, there is an algorithm for solving the problem whose running time is the number of vertices of the input graph multiplied by a quickly-growing but computable function of the treewidth.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Planarization may be performed by using any method to find a drawing (with crossings) for the given graph, and then replacing each crossing point by a new artificial vertex, causing each crossed edge to be subdivided into a path. The original graph will be represented as a [[Graph minor#Immersion minor|immersion minor]] of its planarization.

In '''incremental planarization''', the planarization process is split into two stages. First, a large planar [[Glossary of graph theory#Subgraphs|subgraph]] is found within the given graph. Then, the remaining edges that are not already part of this subgraph are added back one at a time, and routed through an embedding of the planar subgraph. When one of these edges crosses an already-embedded edge, the two edges that cross are replaced by two-edge paths, with a new artificial vertex that represents the crossing point placed at the middle of both paths.&lt;ref name="gdh"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gda"/&gt; In some case a third [[Local search (optimization)|local optimization]] stage is added to the planarization process, in which edges with many crossings are removed and re-added in an attempt to improve the planarization.&lt;ref name="gdh"/&gt;

==Finding the largest planar subgraph==
Using incremental planarization for graph drawing is most effective when the first step of the process finds as large a planar graph as possible. Unfortunately, finding the planar subgraph with the maximum possible number of edges (the ''maximum planar subgraph'' problem&lt;ref name="chimani"&gt;{{citation|first=Markus|last=Chimani|title=Computing Crossing Numbers|year=2008|url=http://www.ae.uni-jena.de/alenmedia/de/dokumente/ComputingCrossingNumbers_PhDthesis_Chimani_pdf.pdf|at=Section 4.3.1|series=Ph.D. dissertation|publisher=[[Technical University of Dortmund]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151116121047/http://www.ae.uni-jena.de/alenmedia/de/dokumente/ComputingCrossingNumbers_PhDthesis_Chimani_pdf.pdf|archivedate=2015-11-16|df=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) is [[NP-hard]], and [[SNP (complexity)|MaxSNP-hard]], implying that there probably does not exist a [[polynomial time]] algorithm that solves the problem exactly or that approximates it arbitrarily well.&lt;ref name="cffk"&gt;{{citation

In an ''n''-vertex [[connected graph]], the largest planar subgraph has at most 3''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;6 edges, and any [[spanning tree]] forms a planar subgraph with ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 edges. Thus, it is easy to approximate the maximum planar subgraph within an [[approximation ratio]] of one-third, simply by finding a spanning tree. A better approximation ratio, 9/4, is known, based on a method for finding a large [[partial k-tree|partial 2-tree]] as a subgraph of the given graph.&lt;ref name="gdh"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cffk"/&gt; Alternatively, if it is expected that the planar subgraph will include almost all of the edges of the given graph, leaving only a small number ''k'' of non-planar edges for the incremental planarization process, then one can solve the problem exactly by using a [[parameterized complexity|fixed-parameter tractable]] algorithm whose running time is linear in the graph size but non-polynomial in the parameter&amp;nbsp;''k''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

There has also been some study of a related problem, finding the largest planar [[induced subgraph]] of a given graph. Again, this is NP-hard, but fixed-parameter tractable when all but a few vertices belong to the induced subgraph.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Adding edges to a planarization==
Once a large planar subgraph has been found, the incremental planarization process continues by considering the remaining edges one by one. As it does so, it maintains a planarization of the subgraph formed by the edges that have already been considered. It adds each new edge to a planar embedding of this subgraph, forming a drawing with crossings, and then replaces each crossing point with a new artificial vertex subdividing the two edges that cross.&lt;ref name="gdh"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gda"/&gt; In some versions of this procedure, the order for adding edges is arbitrary, but it is also possible to choose the ordering to be a [[random permutation]], running the same algorithm several times and returning the best planarization that it finds.&lt;ref name="gdh"/&gt;

In the simplest form of this process, the planar embedding of the planarized subgraph is not allowed to change while new edges are added. In order to add each new edge in a way that minimizes the number of crossings it forms, one can use a [[shortest path algorithm]] in the [[dual graph]] of the current embedding, in order to find the shortest sequence of faces of the embedding and edges to be crossed that connects the endpoints of the new edge to each other. This process takes polynomial time per edge.&lt;ref name="gda"/&gt;

Fixing the embedding of the planarized subgraph is not necessarily optimal in terms of the number of crossings that result. In fact, there exist graphs that are formed by adding one edge to a planar subgraph, where the optimal drawing has only two crossings but where fixing the planar embedding of the subgraph forces a linear number of crossings to be created.&lt;ref name="gdh"/&gt; As a compromise between finding the optimal planarization of a planar subgraph plus one edge, and keeping a fixed embedding, it is possible to search over all embeddings of the planarized subgraph and find the one that minimizes the number of crossings formed by the new edge.&lt;ref name="gdh"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3897">In [[combinatorial optimization]], the '''set TSP''', also known as the '''generalized TSP''', '''group TSP''', '''One-of-a-Set TSP''', '''Multiple Choice TSP''' or '''Covering Salesman Problem''', is a generalization of the [[Traveling salesman problem]] (TSP), whereby it is required to find a shortest tour in a graph which visits all specified subsets of the vertices of a graph. The subsets of vertices must be disjoint. The ordinary TSP is a special case of the set TSP when all subsets to be visited are [[singleton (mathematics)|singleton]]s. Therefore, the set TSP is also [[NP-hard]].

There is a direct transformation for an instance of the set TSP to an instance of the standard asymmetric TSP.&lt;ref name="Noon"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Charles Noon, James Bean|title=An efficient transformation of the generalized traveling salesman problem|year=1993|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265366022_An_efficient_transformation_of_the_generalized_traveling_salesman_problem}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea is to first create disjoint sets and then assign a directed cycle to each set.  The salesman, when visiting a vertex in some set, then walks around the cycle for free.  To not use the cycle would ultimately be very costly.

The Set TSP has a lot of interesting applications in several path planning problems. For example, a two vehicle cooperative routing problem could be transformed into a set TSP,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Satyanarayana G.

==Illustration from the cutting stock problem==
The one-dimensional [[cutting stock problem]] as applied in the paper / plastic film industries, involves cutting jumbo rolls into smaller ones. This is done by generating cutting patterns typically to minimise waste. Once such a solution has been produced, one may seek to minimise the knife changes, by re-sequencing the patterns (up and down in the figure), or moving rolls left or right within each pattern. These moves do not affect the waste of the solution.

[[file:generalised TSP knife changes.png|500 px|border]]

In the above figure, patterns (width no more than 198) are rows; knife changes are indicated by the small white circles; for example, patterns 2-3-4 have a roll of size 42.5 on the left - the corresponding knife does not have to move. Each pattern represents a TSP set, one of whose permutations must be visited. For instance, for the last pattern, which contains two repeated sizes (twice each), there are 5! / (2! &amp;times; 2!) = 30 permutations. The number of possible solutions to the above instance is 12! &amp;times; (5!)&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;times; (6!)&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;times; (7!)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; / ((2!)&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;times; (3!)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) ≈ 5.3 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt;. The above solution contains 39 knife changes, and has been obtained by a heuristic; it is not known whether this is optimal. Transformations into the regular TSP, as described in &lt;ref name="Noon" /&gt; would involve a TSP with 5,520 nodes.

In [[functional analysis]], a '''Shannon wavelet''' may be either of [[real number|real]] or [[complex number|complex]] type. 
Signal analysis by ideal [[bandpass filter]]s defines a decomposition known as Shannon wavelets (or '''sinc wavelets'''). The Haar and sinc systems are Fourier duals of each other.

== Real Shannon wavelet ==

[[File:Wavelet Shan.svg|thumb|right|Real Shannon wavelet]]
The [[Fourier transform]] of the Shannon mother wavelet is given by:

: &lt;math&gt; \Psi^{(\operatorname{Sha}) }(w) = \prod \left( \frac {w- 3 \pi /2} {\pi}\right)+\prod \left( \frac {w+ 3 \pi /2} {\pi}\right). &lt;/math&gt;

where the (normalised) [[gate function]] is defined by

: &lt;math&gt; \prod ( x):= 
\begin{cases}
1, &amp; \mbox{if } {|x| \le 1/2}, \\
0 &amp; \mbox{if } \mbox{otherwise}. \\
\end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

The analytical expression of the real Shannon wavelet can be found by taking the inverse [[Fourier transform]]:

: &lt;math&gt; \psi^{(\operatorname{Sha}) }(t) = \operatorname{sinc} \left( \frac {t} {2}\right)\cdot \cos \left( \frac {3 \pi t} {2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
or alternatively as

: &lt;math&gt; \psi^{(\operatorname{Sha})}(t)=2 \cdot \operatorname{sinc}(2t - 1)-\operatorname{sinc}(t), &lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{sinc}(t):= \frac {\sin {\pi t}} {\pi t}&lt;/math&gt;

is the usual [[sinc function]] that appears in [[Shannon sampling theorem]].

This wavelet belongs to the &lt;math&gt;C^\infty&lt;/math&gt;-class of [[Smooth function#Differentiability classes|differentiability]], but it decreases slowly at infinity and has no [[Support (mathematics)#Compact support|bounded support]], since [[band-limited]] signals cannot be time-limited.

The [[Wavelet#Scaling function|scaling function]] for the Shannon MRA (or ''Sinc''-MRA) is given by the sample function:

: &lt;math&gt;\phi^{(Sha)}(t)= \frac {\sin \pi t} {\pi t} = \operatorname{sinc}(t).&lt;/math&gt;

== Complex Shannon wavelet ==

In the case of [[complex number|complex]] continuous wavelet, the Shannon wavelet is defined by
:&lt;math&gt; \psi^{(CSha) }(t)=\operatorname{sinc}(t) \cdot e^{-j2 \pi t}&lt;/math&gt;,

Cellular automata are a discrete-time [[dynamical system]] of interacting entities, whose state is discrete.

The state of the collection of entities is updated at each discrete time according to some simple homogeneous rule. All entities' states are updated in parallel or synchronously. Stochastic Cellular Automata are CA whose updating rule is a [[stochastic]] one, which means the new entities' states are chosen according to some probability distributions. It is a discrete-time [[random dynamical system]]. From the spatial interaction between the entities, despite the simplicity of the updating rules, [[complex system|complex behaviour]] may [[emergence|emerge]] like [[self-organization]]. As mathematical object, it may be considered in the framework of [[stochastic processes]] as an [[interacting particle system]] in discrete-time.

== PCA as Markov stochastic processes ==

As discrete-time Markov process, PCA are defined on a [[product space]] &lt;math&gt; E=\prod_{k \in G} S_k &lt;/math&gt; (cartesian product) where &lt;math&gt; G &lt;/math&gt;
is a finite or infinite graph, like &lt;math&gt; \mathbb Z &lt;/math&gt; and where &lt;math&gt; S_k &lt;/math&gt; is a finite space, like for instance
&lt;math&gt;  S_k=\{-1,+1\} &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;  S_k=\{0,1\} &lt;/math&gt;. The transition probability has a product form
&lt;math&gt;  P(d\sigma | \eta) = \otimes_{k \in G} p_k(d\sigma_k | \eta) &lt;/math&gt; where 
&lt;math&gt;  \eta \in E &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;  p_k(d\sigma_k | \eta) &lt;/math&gt; is a probability distribution on &lt;math&gt;  S_k &lt;/math&gt;.
In general some locality is required &lt;math&gt;  p_k(d\sigma_k | \eta)=p_k(d\sigma_k | \eta_{V_k}) &lt;/math&gt; where 
&lt;math&gt;  \eta_{V_k}=(\eta_j)_{j\in V_k} &lt;/math&gt;  with &lt;math&gt;  {V_k}  &lt;/math&gt; a finite neighbourhood of k. See &lt;ref&gt;[https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-00002203v1 P.-Y. Louis PhD]&lt;/ref&gt; for a more detailed introduction following the probability theory's point of view.

In [[mathematics]], specifically in the field of [[finite group theory]], the '''Sylow theorems''' are a collection of [[theorem]]s named after the [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[mathematician]] [[Peter Ludwig Mejdell Sylow|Peter Ludwig Sylow]] ([[#{{harvid|Sylow|1872}}|1872]]) that give detailed information about the number of [[subgroup]]s of fixed [[order of a group|order]] that a given [[finite group]] contains. The Sylow theorems form a fundamental part of finite group theory and have very important applications in the [[classification of finite simple groups]].

For a [[prime number]] ''p'', a '''Sylow ''p''-subgroup''' (sometimes '''''p''-Sylow subgroup''') of a group ''G'' is a maximal ''p''-subgroup of ''G'', i.e., a subgroup of ''G'' that is a [[p-group|''p''-group]] (so that the [[order of a group element|order]] of every group element is a [[power (mathematics)|power]] of ''p'') that is not a proper subgroup of any other ''p''-subgroup of ''G''. The set of all Sylow ''p''-subgroups for a given prime ''p'' is sometimes written Syl&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''G'').

The Sylow theorems assert a partial converse to [[Lagrange's theorem (group theory)|Lagrange's theorem]]. Lagrange's theorem states that for any finite group ''G'' the order (number of elements) of every subgroup of ''G'' divides the order of ''G''.  The Sylow theorems state that for every [[prime factor]] ''p'' of the order of a finite group ''G'', there exists a Sylow ''p''-subgroup of ''G'' of order ''p&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'', the highest power of ''p'' that divides the order of ''G''.  Moreover, every subgroup of order ''p&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' is a Sylow ''p''-subgroup of ''G'', and the Sylow ''p''-subgroups of a group (for a given prime ''p'') are [[Conjugacy class|conjugate]] to each other. Furthermore, the number of Sylow ''p''-subgroups of a group for a given prime ''p'' is congruent to {{nowrap|1 mod ''p''.}}

== Theorems ==

Collections of subgroups that are each maximal in one sense or another are common in group theory. The surprising result here is that in the case of Syl&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''G''), all members are actually [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]] to each other and have the largest possible order: if |''G''| = ''p&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;m'' with ''n'' &gt; 0 where ''p'' does not divide ''m'', then every Sylow ''p''-subgroup ''P'' has order |''P''| = ''p&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''. That is, ''P'' is a ''p''-group and ''gcd''(|''G'' : ''P''|, ''p'') = 1. These properties can be exploited to further analyze the structure of ''G''.

The following theorems were first proposed and proven by Ludwig Sylow in 1872, and published in ''[[Mathematische Annalen]]''.

'''Theorem 1''': For every [[prime factor]] ''p'' with [[multiplicity of a prime factor|multiplicity]] ''n'' of the order of a finite group ''G'', there exists a Sylow ''p''-subgroup of ''G'', of order ''p&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''.

The following weaker version of theorem 1 was first proved by [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]], and is known as [[Cauchy's theorem (group theory)|Cauchy's theorem]].

'''Corollary''': Given a finite group ''G'' and a prime number ''p'' dividing the order of ''G'', then there exists an element (and hence a subgroup) of order ''p'' in ''G''.&lt;ref&gt;Fraleigh, Victor J. Katz. A First Course In Abstract Algebra. p. 322. {{isbn|9788178089973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theorem 2''': Given a finite group ''G'' and a prime number ''p'', all Sylow ''p''-subgroups of ''G'' are [[conjugacy class|conjugate]] to each other, i.e. if ''H'' and ''K'' are Sylow ''p''-subgroups of ''G'', then there exists an element ''g'' in ''G'' with ''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''Hg'' = ''K''.

'''Theorem 3''': Let ''p'' be a prime factor with multiplicity ''n'' of the order of a finite group ''G'', so that the order of ''G'' can be written as {{nowrap|''p&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;m''}}, where {{nowrap|''n'' &gt; 0}} and ''p'' does not divide ''m''. Let ''n&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' be the number of Sylow ''p''-subgroups of ''G''. Then the following hold:
* ''n&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' divides ''m'', which is the [[index of a subgroup|index]] of the Sylow ''p''-subgroup in ''G''.
* ''n&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≡ 1 (mod&amp;nbsp;''p'').
* ''n&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' = |''G'' : ''N&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;''(''P'')|, where ''P'' is any Sylow ''p''-subgroup of ''G'' and ''N&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;'' denotes the [[normalizer]].

=== Consequences ===

The Sylow theorems imply that for a prime number ''p'' every Sylow ''p''-subgroup is of the same order, ''p&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''. Conversely, if a subgroup has order ''p&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'', then it is a Sylow ''p''-subgroup, and so is isomorphic to every other Sylow ''p''-subgroup. Due to the maximality condition, if ''H'' is any ''p''-subgroup of ''G'', then ''H'' is a subgroup of a ''p''-subgroup of order ''p&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''.

A very important consequence of Theorem 3 is that the condition ''n&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 1 is equivalent to saying that the Sylow ''p''-subgroup of ''G'' is a [[normal subgroup]]
(there are groups that have normal subgroups but no normal Sylow subgroups, such as ''S''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).

=== Sylow theorems for infinite groups ===

There is an analogue of the Sylow theorems for infinite groups.  We define a Sylow ''p''-subgroup in an infinite group to be a ''p''-subgroup (that is, every element in it has ''p''-power order) that is maximal for inclusion among all ''p''-subgroups in the group.  Such subgroups exist by [[Zorn's lemma]].

'''Theorem''': If ''K'' is a Sylow ''p''-subgroup of ''G'', and ''n&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' = |Cl(''K'')| is finite, then every Sylow ''p''-subgroup is conjugate to ''K'', and ''n&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≡ 1 (mod&amp;nbsp;''p''), where Cl(''K'') denotes the conjugacy class of ''K''.

== Examples ==
[[File:Labeled Triangle Reflections.svg|thumb|In ''D''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; all reflections are conjugate, as reflections correspond to Sylow 2-subgroups.]]

A simple illustration of Sylow subgroups and the Sylow theorems are the [[dihedral group]] of the ''n''-gon, ''D''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. For ''n'' odd, 2 = 2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is the highest power of 2 dividing the order, and thus subgroups of order 2 are Sylow subgroups. These are the groups generated by a reflection, of which there are ''n,'' and they are all conjugate under rotations; geometrically the axes of symmetry pass through a vertex and a side.

[[File:Hexagon reflections.svg|thumb|left|In ''D''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; reflections no longer correspond to Sylow 2-subgroups, and fall into two conjugacy classes.]]
By contrast, if ''n'' is even, then 4 divides the order of the group, and the subgroups of order 2 are no longer Sylow subgroups, and in fact they fall into two conjugacy classes, geometrically according to whether they pass through two vertices or two faces. These are related by an [[outer automorphism]], which can be represented by rotation through π/''n'', half the minimal rotation in the dihedral group.

Another example are the Sylow p-subgroups of ''GL''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''F''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;), where ''p'' and ''q'' are primes ≥ 3 and ''p'' ≡ 1 (mod&amp;nbsp;''q'') , which are all [[Abelian group|abelian]]. The order of ''GL''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''F''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;) is (''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - 1)(''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - ''q'') = (''q'')(''q'' +  1)(''q'' - 1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Since ''q'' = p&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;m + 1, the order of ''GL''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''F''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;) = p&lt;sup&gt;2''n''&lt;/sup&gt; m'. Thus by Theorem 1, the order of the Sylow p-subgroups is ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

One such subgroup ''P'', is the set of diagonal matrices  &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}x^{im} &amp; 0 \\0 &amp; x^{jm} \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;, ''x'' is any [[Primitive root modulo n|primitive root]] of  ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;. Since the order of ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt; is ''q'' - 1, its primitive roots have order ''q - 1'', which implies that ''x''&lt;sup&gt;(''q'' - 1)/''p''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; or ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; and all its powers have an order which is a power of ''p''. So, ''P'' is a subgroup where all its elements have orders which are powers of ''p''. There are ''p&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' choices for both ''a'' and ''b'', making |''P''| = ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. This means ''P'' is a Sylow p-subgroup, which is abelian, as all diagonal matrices commute, and because Theorem 2 states that all Sylow p-subgroups are conjugate to each other, the Sylow p-subgroups of ''GL''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''F''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;) are all abelian.

==Example applications==
Since Sylow's theorem ensures the existence of p-subgroups of a finite group, its worthwhile to study groups of prime power order more closely. Most of the examples use Sylow's theorem to prove that a group of a particular order is not [[Simple group|simple]]. For groups of small order, the congruence condition of Sylow's theorem is often sufficient to force the existence of a [[normal subgroup]]. 
;Example-1: Groups of order ''pq'', ''p'' and ''q'' primes with ''p''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''q''. 
;Example-2: Group of order 30, groups of order 20, groups of order ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''q'', ''p'' and ''q'' distinct primes are some of the applications. 
;Example-3: (Groups of order 60): If the order |''G''|&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;60 and ''G'' has more than one Sylow 5-subgroup, then ''G'' is simple.

=== Cyclic group orders ===
Some non-prime numbers ''n'' are such that every group of order ''n'' is cyclic.  One can show that ''n'' = 15 is such a number using the Sylow theorems:  Let ''G'' be a group of order 15 = 3 · 5 and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; be the number of Sylow 3-subgroups. Then ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\mid&lt;/math&gt; 5 and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ≡ 1 (mod 3). The only value satisfying these constraints is 1; therefore, there is only one subgroup of order 3, and it must be [[normal subgroup|normal]] (since it has no distinct conjugates). Similarly, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; must divide 3, and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; must equal 1 (mod 5); thus it must also have a single normal subgroup of order 5. Since 3 and 5 are [[coprime]], the intersection of these two subgroups is trivial, and so ''G'' must be the [[internal direct product]] of groups of order 3 and 5, that is the [[cyclic group]] of order 15. Thus, there is only one group of order 15 ([[up to]] isomorphism).

=== Small groups are not simple ===
A more complex example involves the order of the smallest [[simple group]] that is not [[cyclic group|cyclic]]. [[Burnside's theorem|Burnside's ''p&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; q&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;'' theorem]] states that if the order of a group is the product of one or two [[prime power]]s, then it is [[solvable group|solvable]], and so the group is not simple, or is of prime order and is cyclic. This rules out every group up to order 30 {{nowrap|({{=}} 2 · 3 · 5)}}.

If ''G'' is simple, and |''G''| = 30, then ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; must divide 10 ( = 2 · 5), and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; must equal 1 (mod 3). Therefore, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 10, since neither 4 nor 7 divides 10, and if ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 then, as above, ''G'' would have a normal subgroup of order 3, and could not be simple. ''G'' then has 10 distinct cyclic subgroups of order 3, each of which has 2 elements of order 3 (plus the identity). This means ''G'' has at least 20 distinct elements of order 3.

As well, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; = 6, since ''n''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; must divide 6 ( = 2 · 3), and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; must equal 1 (mod 5). So ''G'' also has 24 distinct elements of order 5. But the order of ''G'' is only 30, so a simple group of order 30 cannot exist.

Next, suppose |''G''| = 42 = 2 · 3 · 7. Here ''n''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; must divide 6 ( =  2 · 3) and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; must equal 1 (mod 7), so ''n''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; = 1. So, as before, ''G'' can not be simple.

On the other hand, for |''G''| = 60 = 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; · 3 · 5, then ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 10 and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; = 6 is perfectly possible. And in fact, the smallest simple non-cyclic group is ''A''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[alternating group]] over 5 elements. It has order 60, and has 24 [[cyclic permutation]]s of order 5, and 20 of order 3.

=== Wilson's theorem ===
Part of [[Wilson's theorem]] states that

:&lt;math&gt;(p-1)!\ \equiv\ -1 \pmod p&lt;/math&gt;

for every prime ''p''. One may easily prove this theorem by Sylow's third theorem. Indeed,  
observe that the number ''n&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' of Sylow's ''p''-subgroups  
in the symmetric group ''S&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' is (''p''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2)!. On the other hand, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; ≡ 1 (mod&amp;nbsp;''p''). Hence, (''p''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2)! ≡ 1 (mod&amp;nbsp;''p''). So, (''p''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)! ≡ &amp;minus;1 (mod&amp;nbsp;''p'').

=== Fusion results ===
[[Frattini's argument]] shows that a Sylow subgroup of a normal subgroup provides a factorization of a finite group.  A slight generalization known as '''Burnside's fusion theorem''' states that if ''G'' is a finite group with Sylow ''p''-subgroup ''P'' and two subsets ''A'' and ''B'' normalized by ''P'', then ''A'' and ''B'' are ''G''-conjugate if and only if they are ''N&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;''(''P'')-conjugate.  The proof is a simple application of Sylow's theorem: If ''B''=''A&lt;sup&gt;g&lt;/sup&gt;'', then the normalizer of ''B'' contains not only ''P'' but also ''P&lt;sup&gt;g&lt;/sup&gt;'' (since ''P&lt;sup&gt;g&lt;/sup&gt;'' is contained in the normalizer of ''A&lt;sup&gt;g&lt;/sup&gt;'').  By Sylow's theorem ''P'' and ''P&lt;sup&gt;g&lt;/sup&gt;'' are conjugate not only in ''G'', but in the normalizer of ''B''.  Hence ''gh''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; normalizes ''P'' for some ''h'' that normalizes ''B'', and then ''A''&lt;sup&gt;''gh''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; = ''B''&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; = ''B'', so that ''A'' and ''B'' are ''N&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;''(''P'')-conjugate.  Burnside's fusion theorem can be used to give a more powerful factorization called a [[semidirect product]]: if ''G'' is a finite group whose Sylow ''p''-subgroup ''P'' is contained in the center of its normalizer, then ''G'' has a normal subgroup ''K'' of order coprime to ''P'', ''G'' = ''PK'' and ''P''∩''K'' = {1}, that is, ''G'' is [[p-nilpotent group|''p''-nilpotent]].

Less trivial applications of the Sylow theorems include the [[focal subgroup theorem]], which studies the control a Sylow ''p''-subgroup of the [[derived subgroup]] has on the structure of the entire group.  This control is exploited at several stages of the [[classification of finite simple groups]], and for instance defines the case divisions used in the [[Alperin–Brauer–Gorenstein theorem]] classifying finite [[simple group]]s whose Sylow 2-subgroup is a [[quasi-dihedral group]].  These rely on [[J. L. Alperin]]'s strengthening of the conjugacy portion of Sylow's theorem to control what sorts of elements are used in the conjugation.

==Proof of the Sylow theorems==

The Sylow theorems have been proved in a number of ways, and the history of the proofs themselves is the subject of many papers including {{harv|Waterhouse|1980}}, {{harv|Scharlau|1988}}, {{harv|Casadio|Zappa|1990}}, {{harv|Gow|1994}}, and to some extent {{harv|Meo|2004}}.

One proof of the Sylow theorems exploits the notion of [[group action]] in various creative ways. The group ''G'' acts on itself or on the set of its ''p''-subgroups in various ways, and each such action can be exploited to prove one of the Sylow theorems.  The following proofs are based on combinatorial arguments of {{harv|Wielandt|1959}}. In the following, we use ''a'' &lt;math&gt;\mid&lt;/math&gt; ''b'' as notation for "a divides b" and ''a'' &lt;math&gt;\nmid&lt;/math&gt; ''b'' for the negation of this statement.

&lt;blockquote&gt; '''Theorem 1''':  A finite group ''G'' whose order |''G''| is divisible by a prime power ''p&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;'' has a subgroup of order ''p&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Proof: Let |''G''| = ''p&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;m = p&lt;sup&gt;k+r&lt;/sup&gt;u'' such that ''p'' does not divide ''u'', and let Ω denote the set of subsets of ''G'' of size ''p&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;''. ''G'' [[Group action|acts]] on Ω by left multiplication. The [[Group action#Orbits and stabilizers|orbits]] ''G''ω = {''g''ω | ''g'' ∈ ''G''} of the ω ∈ Ω are the [[equivalence class]]es under the action of ''G''.

For any ω ∈ Ω consider its [[Group action#Orbits and stabilizers|stabilizer subgroup]]  ''G''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; = {''g'' ∈ ''G'' | ''g''ω = ω}. For any fixed element α ∈ ω the function [''g'' ↦ ''g''α] maps ''G''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; to ω injectively: for any two ''g'', ''h'' ∈ ''G''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt; we have that ''g''α = ''h''α implies ''g'' = ''h'', because α ∈ ω ⊆ ''G'' means that one may cancel on the right. Therefore,  '' p&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;'' = |ω| ≥ |''G''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;|.

On the other hand,

:&lt;math&gt;|\Omega | ={p^km \choose p^k} = \prod_{j=0}^{p^k - 1} \frac{p^k m - j}{p^k - j} =  m\prod_{j=1}^{p^{k} - 1} \frac{p^{k - \nu_p(j)} m - j/p^{\nu_p(j)}}{p^{k - \nu_p(j)} - j/p^{\nu_p(j)}} &lt;/math&gt;

and no power of ''p'' remains in any of the factors inside the product on the right. Hence [[Additive p-adic valuation|''ν&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'']](|Ω|) = ''ν&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''(''m'') = ''r''.
Let ''R'' ⊆ Ω be a complete representation of all the equivalence classes under the action of ''G''. Then,
:&lt;math&gt;|\Omega | =\sum_{\omega\in R}|G\omega|\mathrm{.}&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, there exists an element ω ∈ ''R'' such that ''s'' := ''ν&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''(|''G''ω|) ≤ ''ν&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''(|Ω|) = ''r''. Hence |''G''ω| = ''p&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;v'' where ''p'' does not divide ''v''. By the [[Group action#Orbits and stabilizers|orbit-stabilizer theorem]] we have |''G''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;| = |''G''| / |''G''ω| = ''p&lt;sup&gt;k+r-s&lt;/sup&gt;u/v''. Therefore, ''p&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;'' &lt;math&gt;\mid&lt;/math&gt; |''G''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;|, so ''p&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;'' ≤ |''G''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;| and ''G''&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the desired subgroup.

&lt;blockquote&gt; '''Lemma''': Let ''G'' be a finite ''p''-group, let Ω be a finite set, let Ω&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; be the set generated by the action of ''G'' on all the elements of Ω, and let Ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; denote the set of points of Ω&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; that are fixed under the action of ''G''.  Then |Ω&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;| ≡ |Ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;| (mod&amp;nbsp;''p''). &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Proof: Write Ω&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; as a disjoint sum of its orbits under ''G''.  Any element ''x'' ∈ Ω&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; not fixed by ''G'' will lie in an orbit of order |''G''|/|''G&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''| (where ''G&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' denotes the [[Group action#Orbits and stabilizers|stabilizer]]), which is a multiple of ''p'' by assumption.  The result follows immediately.

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Theorem 2''': If ''H'' is a ''p''-subgroup of ''G'' and ''P'' is a Sylow ''p''-subgroup of ''G'', then there exists an element ''g'' in ''G'' such that ''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''Hg'' ≤ ''P''. In particular, all Sylow ''p''-subgroups of ''G'' are [[conjugacy class|conjugate]] to each other (and therefore [[isomorphism|isomorphic]]), that is, if ''H'' and ''K'' are Sylow ''p''-subgroups of ''G'', then there exists an element ''g'' in ''G'' with ''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''Hg'' = ''K''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Proof: Let Ω be the set of left [[coset]]s of ''P'' in ''G'' and let ''H'' act on Ω by left multiplication. Applying the Lemma to ''H'' on Ω, we see that |Ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;| ≡ |Ω| = [''G'' : ''P''] (mod&amp;nbsp;''p'').  Now ''p'' &lt;math&gt;\nmid&lt;/math&gt; [''G'' : ''P''] by definition so ''p'' &lt;math&gt;\nmid&lt;/math&gt; |Ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;|, hence in particular |Ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;| ≠ 0 so there exists some ''gP'' ∈ Ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.  It follows that for some ''g'' ∈ ''G'' and ∀ ''h'' ∈ ''H'' we have ''hgP'' = ''gP'' so ''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''HgP'' = ''P'' and therefore ''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''Hg'' ≤ ''P''. Now if ''H'' is a Sylow ''p''-subgroup, |''H''| = |''P''| = |''gPg''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;| so that ''H'' = ''gPg''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; for some ''g'' ∈ ''G''.

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Theorem 3''': Let ''q'' denote the order of any Sylow ''p''-subgroup of a finite group ''G''.  Then ''n&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' = |''G'' : ''N&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;''(''P'')|, ''n&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' &lt;math&gt;\mid&lt;/math&gt; |''G''|/''q'' and ''n&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≡ 1 (mod&amp;nbsp;''p'').&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Proof: Let ''G'' act on ''P'', a Sylow p-subgroup, by conjugation. By the orbit-stabilizer theorem, ''n&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' = [''G'' : ''Stab''&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt;(''P'')]. ''Stab''&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;(''P'') = { ''g'' ∈ ''G'' | ''gPg''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; = ''P'' }  = ''N''&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; (''P''), the normalizer of ''P'' in ''G''. Thus, ''n&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' = |''G'' : ''N&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;''(''P'')|, and it follows that this number is a divisor of |''G''|/''q''. Let Ω be the set of all Sylow ''p''-subgroups of ''G'', and let ''P'' act on Ω by conjugation. Let ''Q'' ∈ Ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and observe that then ''Q'' = ''xQx''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; for all ''x'' ∈ ''P'' so that ''P'' ≤ ''N&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;''(''Q'').  By Theorem 2, ''P'' and ''Q'' are conjugate in ''N&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;''(''Q'') in particular, and ''Q'' is normal in ''N&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;''(''Q''), so then ''P'' = ''Q''.  It follows that Ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = {''P''} so that, by the Lemma, |Ω| ≡ |Ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;| = 1 (mod&amp;nbsp;''p'').

== Algorithms ==
The problem of finding a Sylow subgroup of a given group is an important problem in [[computational group theory]].

One proof of the existence of Sylow ''p''-subgroups is constructive: if ''H'' is a ''p''-subgroup of ''G'' and the index [''G'':''H''] is divisible by ''p'', then the normalizer ''N'' = ''N&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;''(''H'') of ''H'' in ''G'' is also such that [''N'' : ''H''] is divisible by ''p''.  In other words, a polycyclic generating system of a Sylow ''p''-subgroup can be found by starting from any ''p''-subgroup ''H'' (including the identity) and taking elements of ''p''-power order contained in the normalizer of ''H'' but not in ''H'' itself.  The algorithmic version of this (and many improvements) is described in textbook form in {{harv|Butler|1991|loc=Chapter 16}}, including the algorithm described in {{harv|Cannon|1971}}.  These versions are still used in the [[GAP computer algebra system]].

In [[permutation group]]s, it has been proven in ({{harvs|nb|last=Kantor|year1=1985a|year2=1985b|year3=1990}}; {{harvnb|Kantor|Taylor|1988}}) that a Sylow ''p''-subgroup and its normalizer can be found in [[polynomial time]] of the input (the degree of the group times the number of generators).  These algorithms are described in textbook form in {{harv|Seress|2003}}, and are now becoming practical as the constructive recognition of finite simple groups becomes a reality.  In particular, versions of this algorithm are used in the [[Magma computer algebra system]].

In [[mathematics]], the '''''Séminaire de Géométrie Algébrique du Bois Marie''''' ('''''SGA''''') was an influential seminar run by [[Alexander Grothendieck]]. It was a unique phenomenon of research and publication outside of the main [[mathematical journal]]s that ran from 1960 to 1969 at the [[IHÉS]] near Paris. (The name came from the small wood on the estate in [[Bures-sur-Yvette]] where the IHÉS was located from 1962.) The seminar notes were eventually published in twelve volumes, all except one in the [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] Lecture Notes in Mathematics series.

==Style==

The material has a reputation of being hard to read for a number of reasons. More elementary or foundational parts were relegated to the [[Éléments de géométrie algébrique|EGA]] series of Grothendieck and [[Jean Dieudonné]], causing long strings of logical dependencies in the statements. The style is very abstract and makes heavy use of [[category theory]]. Moreover, an attempt was made to achieve maximally general statements, while assuming that the reader is aware of the motivations and concrete examples.

==First publication==

The original notes to SGA were published in [[fascicle (book)|fascicles]] by the IHÉS, most of which went through two or three revisions.  These were published as the seminar proceeded, beginning in the early 60's and continuing through most of the decade.  They can still be found in large math libraries, but distribution was limited.  In the late 60's and early 70's, the original seminar notes were comprehensively revised and rewritten to take into account later developments.  In addition, a new volume, SGA 4½,  was compiled by [[Pierre Deligne]] and published in 1977; it contains simplified and new results by Deligne within the scope of SGA4 as well as some material from SGA5, which had not yet appeared at that time.  The revised notes, except for SGA2, were published by [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]  in its ''Lecture Notes in Mathematics'' series.

After a dispute with Springer, Grothendieck refused the permission for reprints of the series. While these later revisions were more widely distributed than the original fascicles, they are still uncommon outside of libraries.

References to SGA typically mean the later, revised editions and not the original fascicles; some of the originals were labelled by capital letters, thus for example S.G.A.D. = SGA3 and S.G.A.A. = SGA4.

==Series titles==

The volumes of the SGA series are the following:

*SGA1 ''Revêtements étales et groupe fondamental, 1960–1961'' (Étale coverings and the fundamental group), Lecture Notes in Mathematics 224, 1971
*SGA2 ''Cohomologie locale des faisceaux cohérents et théorèmes de Lefschetz locaux et globaux, 1961–1962'' ([[Local cohomology]] of coherent sheaves and global and local [[Lefschetz theorem]]s), North Holland 1968
*SGA3 ''Schémas en groupes, 1962–1964'' ([[Group scheme]]s), Lecture Notes in Mathematics 151, 152 and 153, 1970
*SGA4 ''Théorie des topos et cohomologie étale des schémas, 1963–1964'' ([[Topos theory]] and [[étale cohomology]]), Lecture Notes in Mathematics 269, 270 and 305, 1972/3
*SGA4½ ''Cohomologie étale'' (Étale cohomology), Lecture Notes in Mathematics 569, 1977. SGA 4½ does not correspond to any of the actual seminars. It is a compilation by [[Pierre Deligne]] of some survey articles, new results within the scope of SGA4, and finally material from SGA5.
*SGA5 ''Cohomologie l-adique et fonctions L, 1965–1966'' (''l''-adic cohomology and [[L-function|''L''-functions]]), Lecture Notes in Mathematics 589, 1977
*SGA6 ''Théorie des intersections et théorème de Riemann-Roch, 1966–1967''  (Intersection theory and the [[Riemann-Roch theorem]]), Lecture Notes in Mathematics 225, 1971
*SGA7 ''Groupes de monodromie en géométrie algébrique, 1967–1969'' ([[Monodromy]] groups in algebraic geometry), Lecture Notes in Mathematics 288 and 340, 1972/3.
*SGA8 was never written. The occasional mentions of SGA8 usually refer to either chapter 8 of SGA1, or Berthelot's work on [[crystalline cohomology]] later published outside the SGA series.

== Re-publishing ''SGA'' ==

In the 1990s it became obvious that the lack of availability of the SGA was becoming more and more of a problem to researchers and graduate students in algebraic geometry: not only are the copies in book form too few for the growing number of researchers, but they are also difficult to read because of the way they are typeset (on an [[IBM Selectric typewriter|electric typewriter]], with mathematical formulae written by hand). Thus, under the impetus of various mathematicians from several countries, a project was formed of re-publishing SGA in a more widely available electronic format and using [[LaTeX]] for typesetting; also, various notes are to be added to correct for minor mistakes or obscurities.  The result should be published by the [[Société Mathématique de France]].  Legal permission to reprint the works was obtained from every author except Alexander Grothendieck himself, who could not be contacted; it was decided to proceed without his explicit agreement on the grounds that his refusal for the SGA to be re-published by Springer-Verlag was an objection against Springer and not one of principle.

As a first step, the entire work was scanned and made available on-line (see the [[#External links|links section below]]) by Frank Calegari, Jim Borger and William Stein.  The job of typesetting the text anew and proofreading it was then distributed among dozens of volunteers (most of them junior French mathematicians, because of the required fluency in French and knowledge of algebraic geometry), starting with SGA1 in late 2001.

The coordinating editor for the work on SGA1 was [[Bas Edixhoven]] from [[Universiteit Leiden|University of Leiden]] (at the time [[Université de Rennes I|University of Rennes]]): the first version was available on the [[arXiv.org e-print archive]] on June 20, 2002, and the proof-read version was uploaded on January 4, 2004, and later published in book form by the Société Mathématique de France.  Work on SGA2 was started in 2004 with [[Yves Laszlo]] as coordinating editor. The LaTeX source file is available on the [[arXiv.org e-print archive]]; SGA2 appeared in print in late 2005 by the Société Mathématique de France (see https://web.archive.org/web/20091130171320/http://smf.emath.fr/Publications/DocumentsMathematiques/).

Laszlo has also edited SGA4 and recently Philippe Gille and Patrick Polo have uploaded TeXed version of SGA3. In January 2010, however, Grothendieck requested that work cease on republishing SGA. In late 2014 work on republishing SGA resumed and it was restored to the Grothendieck circle site.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15145">A '''tag system''' is a deterministic [[computation|computational model]] published by [[Emil Leon Post]] in 1943 as a simple form of a '''[[Post canonical system]]'''. A tag system may also be viewed as an abstract machine, called a '''Post tag machine''' (not to be confused with [[Post–Turing machine]]s)—briefly, a [[finite-state machine]] whose only tape is a [[FIFO (computing and electronics)|FIFO]] [[Queue (data structure)|queue]] of unbounded length, such that in each transition the machine reads the symbol at the head of the queue, deletes a constant number of symbols from the head, and appends to the tail a symbol-string that depends solely on the first symbol read in this transition. 

Because all of the indicated operations are performed in a single transition, a tag machine strictly has only one state.

== Definitions ==

A ''tag system'' is a triplet (''m'', ''A'', ''P''), where

* ''m'' is a positive integer, called the ''deletion number''.
* ''A'' is a finite alphabet of symbols, one of which is a special ''halting symbol''. All finite (possibly empty) strings on ''A'' are called ''words''.
* ''P'' is a set of ''production rules'', assigning a word ''P(x)'' (called a ''production'') to each symbol ''x'' in ''A''.  The production (say ''P(&lt;tt&gt;H&lt;/tt&gt;)'') assigned to the halting symbol is seen below to play no role in computations, but for convenience is taken to be ''P(&lt;tt&gt;H&lt;/tt&gt;)'' = ''&lt;tt&gt;'H'&lt;/tt&gt;''.

A ''halting word'' is a word that either begins with the halting symbol or whose length is less than ''m''.

A transformation ''t'' (called the ''tag operation'') is defined on the set of non-halting words, such that if ''x'' denotes the leftmost symbol of a word ''S'', then ''t''(''S'') is the result of deleting the leftmost ''m'' symbols of ''S'' and appending the word ''P(x)'' on the right. Thus, the system processes the m-symbol head into a tail of variable length, but the generated tail depends solely on the first symbol of the head. 

A ''computation'' by a tag system is a finite sequence of words produced by iterating the transformation ''t'', starting with an initially given word and halting when a halting word is produced.  (By this definition, a computation is not considered to exist unless a halting word is produced in finitely-many iterations.  Alternative definitions allow nonhalting computations, for example by using a special subset of the alphabet to identify words that encode output.)

The term ''m-tag system'' is often used to emphasise the deletion number.  Definitions vary somewhat in the literature (cf References), the one presented here being that of Rogozhin.

The use of a halting symbol in the above definition allows the output of a computation to be encoded in the final word alone, whereas otherwise the output would be encoded in the entire sequence of words produced by iterating the tag operation.

A common alternative definition uses no halting symbol and treats all words of length less than ''m'' as halting words. Another definition is the original one used by Post 1943 (described in the historical note below), in which the only halting word is the empty string.

=== Example: A simple 2-tag illustration ===

This is merely to illustrate a simple 2-tag system that uses a halting symbol.

=== Example: Computation of Collatz sequences ===

This simple 2-tag system is adapted from [De Mol, 2008].  It uses no halting symbol, but halts on any word of length less than 2, and computes a slightly modified version of the [[Collatz conjecture|Collatz sequence]].

In the original Collatz sequence, the successor of n is either {{sfrac|''n''|2}} (for even&amp;nbsp;''n'') or 3''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 (for odd n).  The value 3''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 is clearly even for odd&amp;nbsp;''n'', hence the next term after 3''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 is surely {{sfrac|3''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1|2}}. In the sequence computed by the tag system below we skip this intermediate step, hence the successor of ''n'' is {{sfrac|3''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1|2}} for odd&amp;nbsp;''n''.

In this tag system, a positive integer ''n'' is represented by the word aa...a with ''n'' a's.

                                                                  a  &lt;--&gt; 1
                                                                   (halt)
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Turing-completeness of ''m''-tag systems ==

For each ''m'' &gt; 1, the set of ''m''-tag systems is [[Turing-complete]]; i.e., for each ''m'' &gt; 1, it is the case that for any given Turing machine '''T''', there is an ''m''-tag system that [[Surrogate model|emulates]] '''T'''. In particular, a 2-tag system can be constructed to emulate a [[Universal Turing machine]], as was done by Wang 1963 and by Cocke &amp; Minsky 1964.

Conversely, a Turing machine can be shown to be a Universal Turing Machine by proving that it can emulate a Turing-complete class of ''m''-tag systems. For example, Rogozhin 1996 proved the universality of the class of 2-tag systems with alphabet {''a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ..., ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', &lt;tt&gt;H&lt;/tt&gt;} and corresponding productions {''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;W&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ..., ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;W&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', &lt;tt&gt;H&lt;/tt&gt;}, where the ''W&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' are nonempty words; he then proved the universality of a very small (4-state, 6-symbol) Turing machine by showing that it can simulate this class of tag systems.

== The 2-tag halting problem ==
This version of the [[halting problem]] is among the simplest, most-easily described [[Undecidable problem|undecidable]] [[decision problem]]s:

Given an arbitrary positive integer ''n'' and a list of ''n''+1 arbitrary words ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;,''Q'' on the alphabet {1,2,...,''n''}, does repeated application of the tag operation ''t'': ''ijX'' → ''XP''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; eventually convert ''Q'' into a word of length less than 2?  That is, does the sequence ''Q'', ''t''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''Q''), ''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''Q''), ''t''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;(''Q''), ... terminate?

== Historical note on the definition of tag system ==

The above definition differs from that of Post 1943, whose tag systems use no halting symbol, but rather halt only on the empty word, with the tag operation ''t'' being defined as follows:

* If ''x'' denotes the leftmost symbol of a nonempty word ''S'', then ''t''(''S'') is the operation consisting of &lt;u&gt;first appending&lt;/u&gt; the word ''P(x)'' to the right end of ''S'', and &lt;u&gt;then deleting&lt;/u&gt; the leftmost ''m'' symbols of the result &amp;mdash; &lt;u&gt;deleting all&lt;/u&gt; if there be less than ''m'' symbols.

The above remark concerning the Turing-completeness of the set of ''m''-tag systems, for any ''m'' &amp;gt; 1, applies also to these tag systems as originally defined by Post.

=== Origin of the name "tag" ===

According to a footnote in Post 1943, B. P. Gill suggested the name for an earlier variant of the problem in which the first ''m'' symbols are left untouched, but rather a check mark indicating the current position moves to the right by ''m'' symbols every step. The name for the problem of determining whether or not the check mark ever touches the end of the sequence was then dubbed the "problem of tag", referring to the children's [[Tag (game)|game of tag]].

==Cyclic tag systems==

A cyclic tag system is a modification of the original tag system.  The alphabet consists of only two symbols, '''0''' and '''1''', and the production rules comprise a list of productions considered sequentially, cycling back to the beginning of the list after considering the "last" production on the list.  For each production, the leftmost symbol of the word is examined—if the symbol is '''1''', the current production is appended to the right end of the word; if the symbol is '''0''', no characters are appended to the word; in either case, the leftmost symbol is then deleted.  The system halts if and when the word becomes empty.

===Example===
&lt;pre&gt;
Cyclic Tag System
 Productions: (010, 000, 1111)

Computation
 Initial Word: 11001
    Production         Word
    ----------         --------------
       010             11001
       000              1001010
       1111              001010000
       010                01010000
       000                 1010000
       1111                 010000000
       010                   10000000
        .                      .
        .                      .
&lt;/pre&gt;

Cyclic tag systems were created by [[Matthew Cook]] and were used in Cook's demonstration that the [[Rule 110 cellular automaton]] is universal.  A key part of the demonstration was that cyclic tag systems can emulate a [[Turing-complete]] class of tag systems.

==Emulation of tag systems by cyclic tag systems==

An ''m''-tag system with alphabet {''a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ..., ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''} and corresponding productions {''P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ..., ''P&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''} is emulated by a cyclic tag system with ''m*n'' productions (''Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ..., ''Q&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', -, -, ..., -), where all but the first ''n'' productions are the empty string (denoted by '&lt;tt&gt;-&lt;/tt&gt;').  The ''Q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' are encodings of the respective ''P&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'', obtained by replacing each symbol of the tag system alphabet by a length-''n'' binary string as follows (these are to be applied also to the initial word of a tag system computation):

 ''a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 100...00
 ''a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 010...00
 .
 .
 .
 ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 000...01

That is, ''a&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' is encoded as a binary string with a &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; in the k&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; position from the left, and &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt;'s elsewhere.  Successive lines of a tag system computation will then occur encoded as every (''m*n'')&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; line of its emulation by the cyclic tag system.

===Example===

This is a very small example to illustrate the emulation technique.
&lt;pre&gt;
2-tag system
    Production rules: (a --&gt; bb, b --&gt; abH, H --&gt; H)
    Alphabet encoding: a = 100, b = 010, H = 001 
    Production encodings: (bb = 010 010, abH = 100 010 001, H = 001)

Cyclic tag system 
    Productions: (010 010, 100 010 001, 001, -, -, -)

Tag system computation
    Initial word: ba
                    abH
                      Hbb (halt)

Cyclic tag system computation
    Initial word: 010 100 (=ba)

    Production       Word
    ----------       -------------------------------
  * 010 010          010 100  (=ba)
    100 010 001       10 100
    001                0 100 100 010 001
    -                    100 100 010 001
    -                     00 100 010 001
    -                      0 100 010 001
  * 010 010                  100 010 001  (=abH)
    100 010 001               00 010 001 010 010
    001                        0 010 001 010 010
    -                            010 001 010 010
    -                             10 001 010 010
    -                              0 001 010 010
  * 010 010       emulated halt --&gt;  001 010 010  (=Hbb)
    100 010 001                       01 010 010
    001                                1 010 010
    -                                    010 010 001
    ...                                    ...
&lt;/pre&gt;  
Every sixth line (marked by &lt;tt&gt;'*'&lt;/tt&gt;) produced by the cyclic tag system is the encoding of a corresponding line of the tag system computation, until the emulated halt is reached.

[[File:Ceramic Tile Tessellations in Marrakech.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Zellige]] [[terracotta]] tiles in [[Marrakech]], forming edge-to-edge, regular and other tessellations]]
[[File:Leeuwarden - Tegeltableau Escher.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|A wall sculpture in [[Leeuwarden]] celebrating the artistic tessellations of [[M. C. Escher]] ]]

A '''tessellation''' of a flat surface is the tiling of a [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] using one or more [[geometric shape]]s, called tiles, with no overlaps and no gaps. In [[mathematics]], tessellations can be generalized to [[high-dimensional spaces|higher dimensions]] and a variety of geometries.

A periodic tiling has a repeating pattern. Some special kinds include [[Euclidean tilings by convex regular polygons|regular tilings]] with [[regular polygon]]al tiles all of the same shape, and [[semiregular tiling]]s with regular tiles of more than one shape and with every corner identically arranged. The patterns formed by periodic tilings can be categorized into 17 [[wallpaper groups]]. A tiling that lacks a repeating pattern is called "non-periodic". An [[aperiodic tiling]] uses a small set of tile shapes that cannot form a repeating pattern. In the geometry of higher dimensions, a space-filling or [[Honeycomb (geometry)|honeycomb]] is also called a ''tessellation of space''.

A real physical tessellation is a tiling made of materials such as [[cement]]ed [[ceramic]] squares or hexagons. Such tilings may be decorative [[patterns]], or may have functions such as providing durable and water-resistant [[pavement (architecture)|pavement]], floor or wall coverings. Historically, tessellations were used in [[Ancient Rome]] and in [[Islamic art]] such as in the [[Islamic geometric patterns|decorative geometric tiling]] of the [[Alhambra]] palace. In the twentieth century, the work of [[M. C. Escher]] often made use of tessellations, both in ordinary [[Euclidean geometry]] and in [[hyperbolic geometry]], for artistic effect. Tessellations are sometimes employed for decorative effect in [[quilting]]. Tessellations form a class of [[patterns in nature]], for example in the arrays of [[Hexagonal tiling|hexagonal cells]] found in [[honeycomb]]s.

==History==
[[File:Stone-Cone Temple mosaics, Pergamon Museum.JPG|thumb|left|A temple mosaic from the ancient Sumerian city of [[Uruk]] IV (3400–3100 BC), showing a tessellation pattern in coloured tiles]]

Tessellations were used by the [[Architecture of Mesopotamia|Sumerians]] (about 4000 BC) in building wall decorations formed by patterns of clay tiles.&lt;ref name="Pickover2009"&gt;{{cite book |last=Pickover |first=Clifford A. |title=The Math Book: From Pythagoras to the 57th Dimension, 250 Milestones in the History of Mathematics |year=2009 |publisher=Sterling |isbn=9781402757969 |page=372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Decorative [[mosaic]] tilings made of small squared blocks called [[tessera]]e were widely employed in [[classical antiquity]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dunbabin | first1=Katherine M.

In 1619 [[Johannes Kepler]] made an early documented study of tessellations. He wrote about regular and semiregular tessellations in his ''[[Harmonices Mundi]]''; he was possibly the first to explore and to explain the hexagonal structures of honeycomb and [[snowflakes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink=Johannes Kepler | author=Kepler, Johannes | date=1619 | titlelink=Harmonices Mundi | title=Harmonices Mundi |trans-title=Harmony of the Worlds }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Gullberg|1997|p=395}}{{sfn|Stewart|2001|p=13}}

Some two hundred years later in 1891, the Russian crystallographer [[Yevgraf Fyodorov]] proved that every periodic tiling of the plane features one of seventeen different groups of isometries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://public.lanl.gov/djidjev/papers/coverage_chapter.pdf | title=Dynamic Coverage Problems in Sensor Networks | publisher=Los Alamos National Laboratory | year=2012 | accessdate=6 April 2013 |author1=Djidjev, Hristo |author2=Potkonjak, Miodrag |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Fyodorov, Y. | authorlink=Yevgraf Fyodorov | date=1891 | title=Simmetrija na ploskosti [Symmetry in the plane] | journal=Zapiski Imperatorskogo Sant-Petersburgskogo Mineralogicheskogo Obshchestva [Proceedings of the Imperial St. Petersburg Mineralogical Society], series 2 | volume=28 | pages=245–291| language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fyodorov's work marked the unofficial beginning of the mathematical study of tessellations. Other prominent contributors include Aleksei Shubnikov and Nikolai Belov (1964),&lt;ref name="ShubnikovBelov1964"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Shubnikov | first1=Alekseĭ Vasilʹevich | last2=Belov | first2=Nikolaĭ Vasilʹevich | title=Colored Symmetry | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QKk9AAAAIAAJ | year=1964 | publisher=Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Heinrich Heesch]] and Otto Kienzle (1963).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Heesch | first1=H. | last2=Kienzle | first2=O. | title=Flächenschluss: System der Formen lückenlos aneinanderschliessender Flächteile | date=1963 | publisher=Springer | language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology===
In Latin, ''tessella'' is a small cubical piece of [[clay]], [[Rock (geology)|stone]] or [[glass]] used to make mosaics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://m-w.com/dictionary/tessellate | title=Tessellate | publisher=Merriam-Webster Online | accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "tessella" means "small square" (from ''tessera'', square, which in turn is from the Greek word τέσσερα for ''four''). It corresponds to the everyday term ''tiling'', which refers to applications of tessellations, often made of [[ceramic glaze|glazed]] clay.

Tessellation in two dimensions, also called planar tiling, is a topic in geometry that studies how shapes, known as ''tiles'', can be arranged to fill a plane without any gaps, according to a given set of rules. These rules can be varied. Common ones are that there must be no gaps between tiles, and that no corner of one tile can lie along the edge of another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Conway, R. |author2=Burgiel, H. |author3=Goodman-Strauss, G. | title=The Symmetries of Things | publisher=Peters | date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tessellations created by [[Bond (brick)|bonded brickwork]] do not obey this rule. Among those that do, a [[regular tessellation]] has both identical{{efn|The mathematical term for identical shapes is "congruent" – in mathematics, "identical" means they are the same tile.}} [[regular polygon|regular tiles]] and identical regular corners or vertices, having the same angle between adjacent edges for every tile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Coxeter, H. S. M. | title=Regular Polytopes | edition=3rd | publisher=Dover | date=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are only three shapes that can form such regular tessellations: the equilateral [[triangle]], [[square]], and regular [[hexagon]]. Any one of these three shapes can be duplicated infinitely to fill a [[plane (geometry)|plane]] with no gaps.{{sfn|Gullberg|1997|p=395}}

Many other types of tessellation are possible under different constraints. For example, there are eight types of semi-regular tessellation, made with more than one kind of regular polygon but still having the same arrangement of polygons at every corner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Cundy and Rollett | title=Mathematical Models | edition=2nd | publisher=Oxford | date=1961 | pages=61–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irregular tessellations can also be made from other shapes such as [[pentagons]], [[polyominoes]] and in fact almost any kind of geometric shape. The artist [[M. C. Escher]] is famous for making tessellations with irregular interlocking tiles, shaped like animals and other natural objects.{{sfn|Escher|1974|pp=11–12, 15–16}} If suitable contrasting colours are chosen for the tiles of differing shape, striking patterns are formed, and these can be used to decorate physical surfaces such as church floors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.basilicasanmarco.it/basilica/architettura/il-pavimento-tessulare/?lang=en | title=Basilica di San Marco | publisher=Basilica di San Marco | work=Section: Tessellated floor | accessdate=26 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More formally, a tessellation or tiling is a [[cover (topology)|cover]] of the Euclidean plane by a [[countable]] number of closed sets, called ''tiles'', such that the tiles intersect only on their [[Boundary (topology)|boundaries]]. These tiles may be polygons or any other shapes.{{efn|The tiles are usually required to be [[Homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] (topologically equivalent) to a [[closed disk]], which means bizarre shapes with holes, dangling line segments or infinite areas are excluded.&lt;ref name=Grunbaum/&gt;}} Many tessellations are formed from a finite number of [[prototile]]s in which all tiles in the tessellation are [[Congruence (geometry)|congruent]] to the given prototiles. If a geometric shape can be used as a prototile to create a tessellation, the shape is said to ''tessellate'' or to ''tile the plane''. The [[Conway criterion]] is a sufficient but not necessary set of rules for deciding if a given shape tiles the plane periodically without reflections: some tiles fail the criterion but still tile the plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title=Will It Tile? Try the Conway Criterion! | author=Schattschneider, Doris |magazine=Mathematics Magazine | volume=53 | issue=4 | date=September 1980 |pages=224–233 | doi=10.2307/2689617}}&lt;/ref&gt; No general rule has been found for determining if a given shape can tile the plane or not, which means there are many unsolved problems concerning tessellations.&lt;ref name=Grunbaum/&gt;

Mathematically, tessellations can be extended to spaces other than the Euclidean plane.{{sfn|Gullberg|1997|p=395}} The [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[geometry|geometer]] [[Ludwig Schläfli]] pioneered this by defining ''polyschemes'', which mathematicians nowadays call [[polytopes]]. These are the analogues to polygons and [[polyhedron|polyhedra]] in spaces with more dimensions. He further defined the [[Schläfli symbol]] notation to make it easy to describe polytopes. For example, the Schläfli symbol for an equilateral triangle is {3}, while that for a square is {4}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iWvXsVInpgMC&amp;lpg=PP1 | title=Regular Polytopes | publisher=Methuen | author=Coxeter, H. S. M. | year=1948 |pages=14, 69, 149| isbn=9780486614809 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Schläfli notation makes it possible to describe tilings compactly. For example, a tiling of regular hexagons has three six-sided polygons at each vertex, so its Schläfli symbol is {6,3}.&lt;ref name="MathWorldTessellation"&gt;{{MathWorld|title=Tessellation|id=Tessellation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other methods also exist for describing polygonal tilings. When the tessellation is made of regular polygons, the most common notation is the [[vertex configuration]], which is simply a list of the number of sides of the polygons around a vertex. The square tiling has a vertex configuration of 4.4.4.4, or 4&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;. The tiling of regular hexagons is noted 6.6.6, or 6&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Grunbaum&gt;{{cite book | last=Grünbaum |first=Branko | title=Tilings and Patterns | year=1987 | publisher=W.

Mathematicians use some technical terms when discussing tilings. An ''[[edge (geometry)|edge]]'' is the intersection between two bordering tiles; it is often a straight line. A ''[[Vertex (geometry)|vertex]]'' is the point of intersection of three or more bordering tiles. Using these terms, an ''isogonal'' or [[vertex-transitive]] tiling is a tiling where every vertex point is identical; that is, the arrangement of [[polygon]]s about each vertex is the same.&lt;ref name=Grunbaum/&gt; The [[fundamental domain|fundamental region]] is a shape such as a rectangle that is repeated to form the tessellation.&lt;ref name="EmmerSchattschneider2007"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Emmer |first1=Michele |last2=Schattschneider |first2=Doris |title=M.C.

The sides of the polygons are not necessarily identical to the edges of the tiles. An '''edge-to-edge tiling''' is any polygonal tessellation where adjacent tiles only share one full side, i.e., no tile shares a partial side or more than one side with any other tile. In an edge-to-edge tiling, the sides of the polygons and the edges of the tiles are the same. The familiar "brick wall" tiling is not edge-to-edge because the long side of each rectangular brick is shared with two bordering bricks.&lt;ref name=Grunbaum/&gt;

A ''normal tiling'' is a tessellation for which every tile is [[topologically]] equivalent to a [[disk (mathematics)|disk]], the intersection of any two tiles is a single [[connected set]] or the [[empty set]], and all tiles are [[uniformly bounded]]. This means that a single circumscribing radius and a single inscribing radius can be used for all the tiles in the whole tiling; the condition disallows tiles that are pathologically long or thin.&lt;ref name=Horne2000&gt;{{cite book |last=Horne | first=Clare E. | title=Geometric Symmetry in Patterns and Tilings | year=2000 |publisher=Woodhead Publishing |isbn=9781855734920 |pages=172, 175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A &lt;span id="Monohedral" style="white-pace:nowrap;font-weight:bold"&gt;monohedral tiling&lt;/span&gt; is a tessellation in which all tiles are [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]]; it has only one prototile.

[[File:2005-06-25 Tiles together.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Pythagorean tiling]] ]]

An isohedral tiling is a special variation of a monohedral tiling in which all tiles belong to the same transitivity class, that is, all tiles are transforms of the same prototile under the [[symmetry]] group of the tiling.&lt;ref name=Horne2000/&gt; If a prototile admits a tiling, but no such tiling is isohedral, then the prototile is called anisohedral and forms [[anisohedral tiling]]s.

A [[Tiling by regular polygons|regular tessellation]] is a highly [[symmetry|symmetric]], edge-to-edge tiling made up of [[regular polygon]]s, all of the same shape. There are only three regular tessellations: those made up of [[equilateral triangle]]s, [[square (geometry)|squares]], or regular [[hexagon]]s. All three of these tilings are isogonal and monohedral.&lt;ref name=threeregular&gt;{{MathWorld|title=Regular Tessellations|id=RegularTessellations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Tiling by regular polygons#Archimedean, uniform or semiregular tilings|semi-regular (or Archimedean) tessellation]] uses more than one type of regular polygon in an isogonal arrangement. There are eight semi-regular tilings (or nine if the mirror-image pair of tilings counts as two).{{sfn|Stewart|2001|p=75}} These can be described by their [[vertex configuration]]; for example, a semi-regular tiling using squares and regular octagons has the vertex configuration 4.8&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (each vertex has one square and two octagons).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nrich.maths.org/1556 | title=Schläfli Tessellations | publisher=University of Cambridge | date=1997–2012 | accessdate=26 April 2013 | author=NRICH (Millennium Maths Project)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many non-edge-to-edge tilings of the Euclidean plane are possible, including the family of [[Pythagorean tiling]]s, tessellations that use two (parameterised) sizes of square, each square touching four squares of the other size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Wells | first=David | year=1991 | title=The Penguin Dictionary of Curious and Interesting Geometry | publisher=Penguin Books | location=New York | isbn=0-14-011813-6 | pages=260–261 | contribution=two squares tessellation}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[edge tessellation]] is one in which each tile can be reflected over an edge to take up the position of a neighbouring tile, such as in an array of equilateral or isosceles triangles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kirby, Matthew; Umble, Ronald |title=Edge Tessellations and Stamp Folding Puzzles |journal=Mathematics Magazine |volume=84 |issue=4 |date=2011 |pages=283–89 |doi=10.4169/math.mag.84.4.283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aperiodic tilings===
{{Main|Aperiodic tiling|List of aperiodic sets of tiles}}
[[File:Penrose Tiling (Rhombi).svg|thumb|upright|A [[Penrose tiling]], with several symmetries but no periodic repetitions]]

[[Penrose tiling]]s, which use two different quadrilateral prototiles, are the best known example of tiles that forcibly create non-periodic patterns. They belong to a general class of [[aperiodic tiling]]s, which use tiles that cannot tessellate periodically. The [[recursion|recursive process]] of [[substitution tiling]] is a method of generating aperiodic tilings. One class that can be generated in this way is the [[rep-tile]]s; these tilings have surprising [[self-replication|self-replicating]] properties.{{sfn|Gardner|1989|pp=1-18}} [[Pinwheel tiling]]s are non-periodic, using a rep-tile construction; the tiles appear in infinitely many orientations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Radin, C. | title=The Pinwheel Tilings of the Plane | journal=[[Annals of Mathematics]] | volume=139 | issue=3 | pages=661–702 | date=May 1994 | url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.44.9723 | doi=10.2307/2118575 | jstor=2118575}}&lt;/ref&gt; It might be thought that a non-periodic pattern would be entirely without symmetry, but this is not so.

[[Wang tile]]s are squares coloured on each edge, and placed so that abutting edges of adjacent tiles have the same colour; hence they are sometimes called Wang [[dominoes]]. A suitable set of Wang dominoes can tile the plane, but only aperiodically. This is known because any [[Turing machine]] can be represented as a set of Wang dominoes that tile the plane if and only if the Turing machine does not halt.

===Tessellations and colour===
{{further|Four color theorem|l1=Four colour theorem}}

[[File:Torus with seven colours.svg|thumb|right|If the colours of this tiling are to form a pattern by repeating this rectangle as the [[fundamental domain]], at least seven colours are required; more generally, at least [[four color theorem|four colours]] are needed.]]

Sometimes the colour of a tile is understood as part of the tiling; at other times arbitrary colours may be applied later. When discussing a tiling that is displayed in colours, to avoid ambiguity one needs to specify whether the colours are part of the tiling or just part of its illustration. This affects whether tiles with the same shape but different colours are considered identical, which in turn affects questions of symmetry. The [[four color theorem|four colour theorem]] states that for every tessellation of a normal [[Euclidean plane]], with a set of four available colours, each tile can be coloured in one colour such that no tiles of equal colour meet at a curve of positive length. The colouring guaranteed by the four colour theorem does not generally respect the symmetries of the tessellation. To produce a colouring which does, it is necessary to treat the colours as part of the tessellation. Here, as many as seven colours may be needed, as in the picture at right.&lt;ref name=Hazewinkel2001&gt;{{springer | title=Four-colour problem|id=p/f040970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Coloured Voronoi 2D.svg|thumb|upright|A [[Voronoi diagram|Voronoi tiling]], in which the cells are always convex polygons.]]

Next to the various [[tilings by regular polygons]], tilings by other polygons have also been studied.

Any triangle or [[quadrilateral]] (even [[concave polygon|non-convex]]) can be used as a prototile to form a monohedral tessellation, often in more than one way. Copies of an arbitrary [[quadrilateral]] can form a tessellation with translational symmetry and 2-fold rotational symmetry with centres at the midpoints of all sides. For an asymmetric quadrilateral this tiling belongs to [[Wallpaper group#Group p2|wallpaper group p2]]. As [[fundamental domain]] we have the quadrilateral. Equivalently, we can construct a [[parallelogram]] subtended by a minimal set of translation vectors, starting from a rotational centre. We can divide this by one diagonal, and take one half (a triangle) as fundamental domain. Such a triangle has the same area as the quadrilateral and can be constructed from it by cutting and pasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/DLDecArts.GramOrnJones | title=The Grammar of Ornament | publisher=Bernard Quaritch | last=Jones | first=Owen | authorlink=Owen Jones (architect) | year=1910 |edition=folio | origyear=1856}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tessellations in three or more dimensions are called [[Honeycomb (geometry)|honeycombs]]. In three dimensions there is just one regular honeycomb, which has eight cubes at each polyhedron vertex. Similarly, in three dimensions there is just one quasiregular{{efn|In this context, quasiregular means that the cells are regular (solids), and the vertex figures are semiregular.}} honeycomb, which has eight [[tetrahedron|tetrahedra]] and six [[octahedron|octahedra]] at each polyhedron vertex.

It is possible to tessellate in [[non-Euclidean]] geometries such as [[hyperbolic geometry]]. A [[Uniform tilings in hyperbolic plane|uniform tiling in the hyperbolic plane]] (which may be regular, quasiregular or semiregular) is an edge-to-edge filling of the hyperbolic plane, with [[regular polygon]]s as [[Face (geometry)|faces]]; these are [[vertex-transitive]] ([[Transitive group action|transitive]] on its [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]]), and isogonal (there is an [[isometry]] mapping any vertex onto any other).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv | last1=Margenstern | first1=Maurice | title=Coordinates for a new triangular tiling of the hyperbolic plane | date=4 January 2011 | eprint=1101.0530 | class=cs.FL }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Tiling the Hyperbolic Plane with Regular Polygons | author=Zadnik,  Gašper | url=http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/TilingTheHyperbolicPlaneWithRegularPolygons/  | publisher=Wolfram | accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Uniform honeycombs in hyperbolic space|uniform honeycomb in hyperbolic space]] is a uniform tessellation of [[uniform polyhedron|uniform polyhedral]] [[Cell (geometry)|cells]]. In 3-dimensional hyperbolic space there are nine [[Coxeter group]] families of compact [[convex uniform honeycomb]]s, generated as [[Wythoff construction]]s, and represented by [[permutation]]s of [[Coxeter-Dynkin diagram#Application with uniform polytopes|rings]] of the [[Coxeter diagram]]s for each family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Coxeter, H.S.M. | work=The Beauty of Geometry: Twelve Essays | publisher=Dover Publications | date=1999 | isbn=0-486-40919-8 | title=Chapter 10: Regular honeycombs in hyperbolic space | pages=212–213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mosaic floor panel - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|Roman [[mosaic]] floor panel of stone, tile and glass, from a villa near [[Antakya|Antioch]] in Roman Syria. 2nd century AD]]

In architecture, tessellations have been used to create decorative motifs since ancient times. [[Mosaic]] tilings often had geometric patterns.&lt;ref name=Field1988&gt;{{cite book | title=Geometric Patterns from Roman Mosaics | publisher=Tarquin | author=Field, Robert | year=1988 | isbn=978-0-906-21263-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later civilisations also used larger tiles, either plain or individually decorated. Some of the most decorative were the [[Moorish]] wall tilings of [[Islamic architecture]], using [[Girih tiles|Girih]] and [[Zellige]] tiles in buildings such as the [[Alhambra]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/teaching/math-art-arch.shtml#Symmetry | title=Mathematics in Art and Architecture | publisher=National University of Singapore |accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mosque–Cathedral of Córdoba|La Mezquita]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Whittaker | first=Andrew |title=Speak the Culture: Spain | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2rZS8SWMroUC&amp;pg=PT153 | year=2008 | publisher=Thorogood Publishing | isbn=978-1-85418-605-8 | page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tessellations frequently appeared in the graphic art of [[M. C. Escher]]; he was inspired by the Moorish use of symmetry in places such as the Alhambra when he visited [[Spain]] in 1936.{{sfn|Escher|1974|pp=5, 17}} Escher made four "[[Circle Limit III|Circle Limit]]" drawings of tilings that use hyperbolic geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Gersten |first1=S.

Tessellated designs often appear on textiles, whether woven, stitched in or printed. Tessellation patterns have been used to design interlocking [[Motif (textile arts)|motifs]] of patch shapes in [[quilt]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Porter | first=Christine | title=Tessellation Quilts: Sensational Designs From Interlocking Patterns | year=2006 | publisher=F+W Media | isbn=9780715319413 | pages=4–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beyer |first=Jinny | title=Designing tessellations: the secrets of interlocking patterns |year=1999 |publisher=Contemporary Book |isbn=9780809228669 |pages=Ch. 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tessellations are also a main genre in [[origami#tessellation|origami]] (paper folding), where pleats are used to connect molecules such as twist folds together in a repeating fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Origami Tessellations |last=Gjerde |first=Eric |publisher=Taylor and Francis |year=2008|isbn=978-1-568-81451-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In manufacturing==
Tessellation is used in [[manufacturing industry]] to reduce the wastage of material (yield losses) such as [[sheet metal]] when cutting out shapes for objects like [[car door]]s or [[drinks can]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Reducing yield losses: using less metal to make the same thing | url=http://www.withbotheyesopen.com/pdftransponder.php?c=13|publisher=UIT Cambridge | accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tessellation is apparent in the [[mudcrack]]-like [[fracture|cracking]] of [[thin film]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thouless | first1 = M.

==In nature==
[[File:Colchicum - unknown species.jpg|left|upright=0.8|thumb|Tessellate pattern in a ''[[Colchicum]]'' flower]]
{{Main|Patterns in nature#Tessellations}}

The [[honeycomb]] provides a well-known example of tessellation in nature with its hexagonal cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Ball | first1=Philip | title=How honeycombs can build themselves | url=http://www.nature.com/news/how-honeycombs-can-build-themselves-1.13398 | website=Nature.com | publisher=Nature | accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In botany, the term "tessellate" describes a checkered pattern, for example on a flower petal, tree bark, or fruit. Flowers including the [[Fritillaria|fritillary]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Shorter Oxford English dictionary | edition=6th | year=2007 | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=United Kingdom |isbn=0199206872 |page=3804}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some species of ''Colchicum'' are characteristically tessellate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Purdy | first1=Kathy | title=Colchicums: autumn's best-kept secret | journal=American Gardener | date=2007 | issue=September/October | pages=18–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[patterns in nature]] are formed by cracks in sheets of materials. These patterns can be described by [[Gilbert tessellation]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv | last1=Schreiber | first1=Tomasz | last2=Soja | first2=Natalia | eprint=1005.0023 | title=Limit theory for planar Gilbert tessellations | year=2010| class=math.PR }}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as random crack networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Gray | first1=N. H. | last2=Anderson | first2=J. B. | last3=Devine | first3=J. D. | last4=Kwasnik | first4=J.

The model, named after [[Edgar Gilbert]], allows cracks to form starting from randomly scattered over the plane; each crack propagates in two opposite directions along a line through the initiation point, its slope chosen at random, creating a tessellation of irregular convex polygons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Gilbert | first=E. N. | authorlink=Edgar Gilbert | editor-last=Noble | editor-first=B. | contribution=Random plane networks and needle-shaped crystals | location=New York | publisher=Macmillan | title=Applications of Undergraduate Mathematics in Engineering | year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Basalt]]ic [[lava flow]]s often display [[Columnar basalt|columnar jointing]] as a result of [[Thermal expansion#Contraction effects|contraction]] forces causing cracks as the lava cools. The extensive crack networks that develop often produce hexagonal columns of lava. One example of such an array of columns is the [[Giant's Causeway]] in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weaire |first1=D. |last2=Rivier |first2=N. |title=Soap, cells and statistics: Random patterns in two dimensions |journal=Contemporary Physics |date=1984|volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=59–99 | authorlink=Denis Weaire |doi=10.1080/00107518408210979}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tessellated pavement]], a characteristic example of which is found at [[Eaglehawk Neck, Tasmania|Eaglehawk Neck]] on the [[Tasman Peninsula]] of [[Tasmania]], is a rare sedimentary rock formation where the rock has fractured into rectangular blocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Branagan, D.F. | date=1983 | title=Tesselated pavements |editor1=Young, R.W. |editor2=Nanson, G.C. | pages=11–20 | work=Aspects of Australian sandstone landscapes.

Other natural patterns occur in [[foam]]s; these are packed according to [[Plateau's laws]], which require [[minimal surface]]s. Such foams present a problem in how to pack cells as tightly as possible: in 1887, [[Lord Kelvin]] proposed a packing using only one solid, the [[bitruncated cubic honeycomb]] with very slightly curved faces. In 1993, Denis Weaire and Robert Phelan proposed the [[Weaire–Phelan structure]], which uses less surface area to separate cells of equal volume than Kelvin's foam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Ball, Philip | title=Shapes | publisher=Oxford University Press | date=2009 | pages=73–76 | isbn=978-0-199-60486-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4301">In [[computer vision]], the '''trifocal tensor''' (also '''tritensor''') is a 3×3×3 array of numbers
(i.e., a [[tensor]]) that incorporates all [[projective geometry|projective]] geometric relationships
among three views. It relates the coordinates of corresponding points or lines in three views, being
independent of the scene structure and depending only on the relative motion (i.e., pose) among the
three views and their intrinsic calibration parameters. Hence, the trifocal tensor can be considered as
the generalization of the [[fundamental matrix (computer vision)|fundamental matrix]] in three views.
It is noted that despite that the tensor is made up of 27 elements, only 18 of them are actually independent.

== Correlation slices ==
The tensor can also be seen as a collection of three rank-two 3 x 3 matrices
&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf T}_1, \; {\mathbf T}_2, \; {\mathbf T}_3&lt;/math&gt; known as its ''correlation slices''.
Assuming that the [[Camera matrix|projection matrices]] of three views are
&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf P}=[ {\mathbf I} \; | \; {\mathbf 0} ]&lt;/math&gt;, 
&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf P}^'=[ {\mathbf A} \; | \; {\mathbf a}_4 ]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf P^{''}}=[{\mathbf B} \; | \; {\mathbf b}_4 ]&lt;/math&gt;,
the correlation slices of the corresponding tensor can be expressed in closed form as
&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf T}_i={\mathbf a}_i {\mathbf b}_4^t - {\mathbf a}_4 {\mathbf b}_i^t, \; i=1 \ldots 3&lt;/math&gt;,
where 
&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf a}_i, \; {\mathbf b}_i&lt;/math&gt;
are respectively the ''i''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; columns of the camera matrices.
In practice, however, the tensor is estimated from point and line matches across the three views.

== Trilinear constraints ==
One of the most important properties of the trifocal tensor is that it gives rise to linear relationships between
lines and points in three images. More specifically, for triplets of corresponding points
&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf x} \; \leftrightarrow \; {\mathbf x}^{'} \; \leftrightarrow  \;{\mathbf x}^{''}&lt;/math&gt;
and any corresponding lines
&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf l} \; \leftrightarrow \; {\mathbf l}^{'} \; \leftrightarrow  \;{\mathbf l}^{''}&lt;/math&gt; through
them, the following ''trilinear constraints'' hold:
:&lt;math&gt;
({\mathbf l}^{'t} \left[{\mathbf T}_1, \; {\mathbf T}_2, \; {\mathbf T}_3 \right] {\mathbf l}^{''}) [{\mathbf l}]_{\times} = {\mathbf 0}^t
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
{\mathbf l}^{'t} \left( \sum_i x_i {\mathbf T}_i \right) {\mathbf l}^{''} = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
{\mathbf l}^{'t} \left( \sum_i x_i {\mathbf T}_i \right) [{\mathbf x}^{''}]_{\times} = {\mathbf 0}^t
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
[{\mathbf x}^']_{\times} \left( \sum_i x_i {\mathbf T}_i \right) {\mathbf l}^{''} = {\mathbf 0}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
[{\mathbf x}^']_{\times} \left( \sum_i x_i {\mathbf T}_i \right) [{\mathbf x}^{''}]_{\times} = {\mathbf 0}_{3 \times 3}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; [\cdot]_{\times} &lt;/math&gt; denotes the skew-symmetric [[Cross product#Conversion to matrix multiplication|cross product matrix]].

== Transfer ==
Given the trifocal tensor of three views and a pair of matched points in two views, it is possible to determine the
location of the point in the third view without any further information. This is known as ''point transfer'' and a
similar result holds for lines.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6230">In mathematics, a '''uniform matroid''' is a [[matroid]] in which every [[permutation]] of the elements is a symmetry.

==Definition==
The uniform matroid &lt;math&gt;U{}^r_n&lt;/math&gt; is defined over a set of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; elements. A subset of the elements is independent if and only if it contains at most &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; elements. A subset is a basis if it has exactly &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; elements, and it is a circuit if it has exactly &lt;math&gt;r+1&lt;/math&gt; elements. The [[matroid rank|rank]] of a subset &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\min(|S|,r)&lt;/math&gt; and the rank of the matroid is &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

A matroid of rank &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is uniform if and only if all of its circuits have exactly &lt;math&gt;r+1&lt;/math&gt; elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Oxley|2006}}, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

The matroid &lt;math&gt;U{}^2_n&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-point line'''.

==Duality and minors==
The [[dual matroid]] of the uniform matroid &lt;math&gt;U{}^r_n&lt;/math&gt; is another uniform matroid &lt;math&gt;U{}^{n-r}_n&lt;/math&gt;. A uniform matroid is self-dual if and only if &lt;math&gt;r=n/2&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Oxley|2006}}, pp. 77 &amp; 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

Every [[matroid minor|minor]] of a uniform matroid is uniform. Restricting a uniform matroid &lt;math&gt;U{}^r_n&lt;/math&gt; by one element (as long as &lt;math&gt;r &lt; n&lt;/math&gt;) produces the matroid
&lt;math&gt;U{}^r_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; and contracting it by one element (as long as &lt;math&gt;r &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;) produces the matroid &lt;math&gt;U{}^{r-1}_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Oxley|2006}}, pp. 106–107 &amp; 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Realization==
The uniform matroid &lt;math&gt;U{}^r_n&lt;/math&gt; may be [[Matroid representation|represented]] as the matroid of affinely independent subsets of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; points in [[general position]] in &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], or as the matroid of linearly independent subsets of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; vectors in general position in an &lt;math&gt;(r+1)&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional real [[vector space]].

Every uniform matroid may also be realized in [[projective space]]s and vector spaces over all sufficiently large [[finite field]]s.&lt;ref name="Ox100"/&gt; However, the field must be large enough to include enough independent vectors. For instance, the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-point line &lt;math&gt;U{}^2_n&lt;/math&gt; can be realized only over finite fields of &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt; or more elements (because otherwise the projective line over that field would have fewer than &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; points): &lt;math&gt;U{}^2_4&lt;/math&gt; is not a [[binary matroid]], &lt;math&gt;U{}^2_5&lt;/math&gt; is not a ternary matroid, etc. For this reason, uniform matroids play an important role in [[Rota's conjecture]] concerning the [[matroid minor|forbidden minor]] characterization of the matroids that can be realized over finite fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Oxley|2006}}, pp. 202–206.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Algorithms==
The problem of finding the minimum-weight basis of a [[weighted matroid|weighted]] uniform matroid is well-studied in computer science as the [[Selection algorithm|selection problem]]. It may be solved in [[linear time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Any algorithm that tests whether a given matroid is uniform, given access to the matroid via an [[matroid oracle|independence oracle]], must perform an exponential number of oracle queries, and therefore cannot take polynomial time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Related matroids==
Unless &lt;math&gt;r\in\{0,n\}&lt;/math&gt;, a uniform matroid &lt;math&gt;U{}^r_n&lt;/math&gt; is connected: it is not the direct sum of two smaller matroids.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Oxley|2006}}, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;
The direct sum of a family of uniform matroids (not necessarily all with the same parameters) is called a [[partition matroid]].

Every uniform matroid is a [[paving matroid]],&lt;ref name=Ox26&gt;{{harvtxt|Oxley|2006|p=26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a [[transversal matroid]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Oxley|2006}}, pp. 48–49.&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[gammoid|strict gammoid]].&lt;ref name="Ox100"&gt;{{harvtxt|Oxley|2006}}, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not every uniform matroid is [[graphic matroid|graphic]], and the uniform matroids provide the smallest example of a non-graphic matroid, &lt;math&gt;U{}^2_4&lt;/math&gt;. The uniform matroid &lt;math&gt;U{}^1_n&lt;/math&gt; is the graphic matroid of an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-edge [[dipole graph]], and the dual uniform matroid &lt;math&gt;U{}^{n-1}_n&lt;/math&gt; is the graphic matroid of its [[dual graph]], the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-edge [[cycle graph]]. &lt;math&gt;U{}^0_n&lt;/math&gt; is the graphic matroid of a graph with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; self-loops, and &lt;math&gt;U{}^n_n&lt;/math&gt; is the graphic matroid of an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-edge [[tree (graph theory)|forest]]. Other than these examples, every uniform matroid &lt;math&gt;U{}^r_n&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;1 &lt; r &lt; n-1&lt;/math&gt; contains &lt;math&gt;U{}^2_4&lt;/math&gt; as a minor and therefore is not graphic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Welsh|2010}}, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

The &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-point line provides an example of a [[Sylvester matroid]], a matroid in which every line contains three or more points.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Welsh|2010}}, p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt;
