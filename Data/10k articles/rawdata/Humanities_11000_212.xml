'''Amarna letter EA 205''', titled: ''"Ready for Marching Orders (5)"''&lt;ref&gt;[[William L. Moran|Moran, William L.]] 1987, 1992. ''The Amarna Letters.'' EA 205, ''"Ready for Marching Orders (5)"'', p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt; is a short letter from the ''Ruler'' of city [[Tubu (town)|Ṭubu]]. The title references that six mostly identical, very short, letters were scribed by the same scribe, from small regional towns; the scribe also is the writer of [[Amarna letter EA 195]]. It is not known if each letter was written at the location of each town, or from an alternative site, or sites.

The six towns are: 
:Ṣiribašani, Message of [[Artamanya]]
:town 2, Message of Amawaše
:Šashimi, Message of Abdi-Milki
:[[Qanu]], Message of the Ruler
:[[Tubu (town)|Ṭubu]], Message of the Ruler
:[[Naziba]], Message of the Ruler

The [[Amarna letters]], about 300, numbered up to EA 382, are a mid 14th century BC, about [[1350 BC]] and 20–25 years later, [[Text corpus|correspondence]]. The initial [[corpus linguistics|corpus]] of letters were found at [[Akhenaten]]'s city [[Akhetaten]], in the floor of the [[Bureau of Correspondence of Pharaoh]]; others were later found, adding to the body of letters.

{{Anabaptist vertical}}
The '''Amish''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑː|m|ɪ|ʃ}}; [[Pennsylvania German language|Pennsylvania German]]: ''Amisch'', {{lang-de|Amische}}) are a group of traditionalist Christian church fellowships with [[Swiss German]] [[Anabaptist]] origins. They are closely related to, but distinct from, [[Mennonite]] churches. The Amish are known for [[simple living]], [[plain dress]], and reluctance to adopt many [[modern convenience|conveniences of modern technology]].

The history of the Amish church began with a [[schism (religion)|schism]] in Switzerland within a group of Swiss and [[Alsace|Alsatian]] [[Anabaptist]]s in 1693 led by [[Jakob Ammann]].{{Sfn | Kraybill | 2001 | pp = 7–8}} Those who followed Ammann became known as Amish.{{Sfn | Kraybill | 2001 | p = 8}} In the second half of the 19th century, the Amish divided into Old Order Amish and [[Amish Mennonite]]s. The latter mostly assimilated into the main society during the 20th century, whereas the Old Order Amish retained much of their traditional culture. When it is spoken of Amish today, normally only the Old Order Amish are meant.

In the early 18th century, many Amish and Mennonites immigrated to [[Pennsylvania]] for a variety of reasons. Today, the Old Order Amish, but also the [[New Order Amish]] and the [[Old Beachy Amish]] continue to speak [[Pennsylvania German language|Pennsylvania German]], also known as "Pennsylvania Dutch", although two different [[Alemannic German|Alemannic dialects]] are used by Old Order Amish in [[Adams County, Indiana|Adams]] and [[Allen County, Indiana|Allen County]], [[Indiana]].&lt;ref name="gameo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Berne, Indiana, Old Order Amish Settlement |url= http://www.gameo.org/encyclopedia/contents/B4762.html|author=Zook, Noah and Samuel L Yoder|publisher=Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online |year=1998|accessdate= April 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2000}}, over 165,000 Old Order Amish lived in the United States and about 1,500 lived in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/amish.htm |title=The Amish: history, beliefs, practices, etc |publisher=Religious tolerance |accessdate= November 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 study suggested their numbers had increased to 227,000,&lt;ref name="Scolforo"&gt;{{cite news |title=Amish population nearly doubles in 16 years|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-08-20-3770622862_x.htm| last = Scolforo | first = Mark | date= August 20, 2008 | accessdate=February 3, 2011|newspaper= USA Today|agency= Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2010, a study suggested their population had grown by 10 percent in the past two years to 249,000, with increasing movement to the West.&lt;ref name="Amish Population Growth: Numbers Increasing, Heading West"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/07/29/amish-population-growth-n_n_663323.html|title= Amish Population Growth: Numbers Increasing, Heading West | last =Scolforo | first = Mark | date= July 28, 2010| work= The Huffington Post| accessdate= July 29, 2010| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100730110138/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/07/29/amish-population-growth-n_n_663323.html| archivedate=July 30, 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the Amish continue to have 6–7 children while benefitting from the major decrease in infant and maternal mortality in the 20th century. Between 1992 and 2017, the Amish population increased by 149%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://groups.etown.edu/amishstudies/files/2017/08/Population_Change_1992-2017.pdf |publisher=Young Center for Anabaptist and Pietist Studies, Elizabethtown College |title=Amish Population Change, 1992-2017 |accessdate=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the U.S. population increased by 23%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.multpl.com/united-states-population/table|title= US Population by Year|work= Multpl |access-date=March 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=March 2017}}

Amish church membership begins with [[Believer's baptism|baptism]], usually between the ages of 19 and 23. It is a requirement for marriage within the Amish church. Once a person is baptized within the church, he or she may marry only within the faith.  Church districts average between 20 and 40 families and worship services are held every other Sunday in a member's home. The district is led by a bishop and several ministers and deacons.{{Sfn | Kraybill | 1994 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=OYNYKYsulbQC&amp;pg=PA3  3]}}  The rules of the church, the ''[[Ordnung]]'', must be observed by every member and cover many aspects of day-to-day living, including prohibitions or limitations on the use of power-line electricity, telephones, and automobiles, as well as regulations on clothing.  Most Amish do not buy commercial insurance or participate in [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]].  As [[Anabaptist#Today|present-day Anabaptists]], Amish church members practice [[nonresistance]] and will not perform any type of military service. The Amish value rural life, manual labor, and humility, all under the auspices of living what they interpret to be God's word.

Members who do not conform to these community expectations and who cannot be convinced to [[repentance|repent]] are excommunicated. In addition to [[excommunication]], members may be [[Shunning|shunned]],&lt;ref name=PBSAE&gt;''[[The Amish (film)|American Experience: The Amish]]''&lt;/ref&gt; a practice that limits social contacts to shame the wayward member into returning to the church. Almost 90 percent of Amish teenagers choose to be baptized and join the church.&lt;ref name=PBSAE/&gt; During an adolescent period of ''[[rumspringa]]'' ("running around") in some communities, nonconforming behavior that would result in the shunning of an adult who had made the permanent commitment of baptism, may be met with a degree of forbearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/series/inside/3660/amish-rumspringa |title=Amisch Teenagers Experience the World |publisher=National Geographic Television |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081110133521/http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/series/inside/3660/amish-rumspringa |archivedate=November 10, 2008 }}{{failed verification|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amish church groups seek to maintain a degree of separation from the non-Amish world, i.e. American and Canadian society. Non-Amish people are generally referred to as 'English'. There is generally a heavy emphasis on church and family relationships. They typically operate their own [[one-room school]]s and discontinue formal education after grade eight, at age 13/14.&lt;ref name=PBSAE/&gt; Until the children turn 16, they have vocational training under the tutelage of their parents, community, and the school teacher. Higher education is generally discouraged as it can lead to social segregation and the unraveling of the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Public Broadcasting Service (PBS)|title=The Amish: Shunned|url=http://www.pbs.org/video/american-experience-amish-shunned-chapter-1/|website=American Experience|publisher=PBS|accessdate=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anabaptist beginnings===

{{main|Anabaptism}}

The [[Anabaptist]] movement, from which the Amish later emerged, started in circles around [[Huldrych Zwingli]] (1484 – 1531) who led the early [[Reformation in Switzerland]]. In [[Zurich]] on 21 January 1525, [[Conrad Grebel]] and [[George Blaurock]] practiced adult baptism to each other and then to others.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony L. Chute, Nathan A. Finn, Michael A. G. Haykin. ''The Baptist Story'', Nashville, 2015, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; This Swiss movement, part of the [[Radical Reformation]], later became known as [[Swiss Brethren]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Arnold Snyder. ''Anabaptist History and Theology: An Introduction''. Kitchener, Ontario, 1995, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The emergence of the Amish ===
The term Amish was first used as a ''Schandename'' (a term of disgrace) in 1710 by opponents of [[Jakob Amman]]. The first informal division between Swiss Brethren was recorded in the 17th century between ''Oberländers'' ([[Bernese Highlands|those living in the hills]]) and ''Emmentaler'' (those living in the [[Emmental]] valley). The ''Oberländers'' were a more extreme congregation; their zeal pushing them into more remote areas and their solitude making them more zealous.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Swiss Anabaptism developed, from this point, in two parallel streams, most clearly marked by disagreement over the preferred treatment of "fallen" believers. The Emmentalers (sometimes referred to as Reistians, after bishop [[Hans Reist]], a leader among the Emmentalers) argued that fallen believers should only be withheld from [[Holy Communion|communion]], and not regular meals.  The ''Amish'' argued that those who had been banned should be avoided even in common meals.  The Reistian side eventually formed the basis of the [[Swiss Mennonite Conference]]. Because of this common heritage, Amish and Mennonites from southern Germany and Switzerland retain many similarities. Those who leave the Amish fold tend to join various congregations of [[Conservative Mennonites]].{{Sfn | Smith | Krahn | 1981 | pp = 212–4}}{{Sfn | Kraybill| 2000| pp = 63–4}}

=== Migration to North America ===
Amish began migrating to Pennsylvania, then known for its [[religious toleration]], in the 18th century as part of a larger migration from the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]] and neighboring areas. This migration was a reaction to religious wars, poverty, and [[religious persecution]] in Europe.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} The first Amish immigrants went to [[Berks County, Pennsylvania|Berks County]], Pennsylvania, but later moved, motivated by land issues and by security concerns tied to the [[French and Indian War]].{{Citation needed| date=September 2009}} Many eventually settled in [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Lancaster County]], Pennsylvania. Other groups later settled elsewhere in North America.

=== 1850–1878 Division into Old Orders and Amish Mennonites===
{{Main|Old Order Movement}}
Most Amish communities that were established in North America did not ultimately retain their Amish identity. The major division that resulted in the loss of identity of many Amish congregations occurred in the third quarter of the 19th century. The forming of factions worked its way out at different times at different places. The process was rather a "sorting out" than a split. Amish people are free to join another Amish congregation at another place that fits them best.

In the years after 1850, tensions rose within individual Amish congregations and between different Amish congregations. Between 1862 and 1878 yearly ''Dienerversammlungen'' (ministerial conferences) were held at different places, concerning how the Amish should deal with the tensions caused by the pressures of modern society.{{Sfn | Nolt | 1992 | p = 159}} The meetings themselves were a progressive idea; for bishops to assemble to discuss uniformity was an unprecedented notion in the Amish church.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} By the first several meetings, the more traditionally minded bishops agreed to [[boycott]] the conferences.

The more progressive members, comprising approximately two-thirds of the group, became known by the name Amish Mennonite, and eventually united with the [[Mennonite Church (1725–2002)|Mennonite Church]], and other Mennonite denominations, mostly in the early 20th century. The more traditionally minded groups became known as the Old Order Amish.{{Sfn | Nolt | 1992 | pp = 157-178}} The [[Fellowship of Evangelical Churches|Egli Amish]] had already started to withdraw from the Amish church in 1858. They soon drifted away from the old ways and changed their name to "Defenseless Mennonite" in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fecministries.org/our-beliefs/history/|author=Fellowship of Evangelical Churches |title=Our History |website=Fecministries.org|accessdate=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congregations that took no side in the division after 1862 formed the [[Conservative Mennonite Conference|Conservative Amish Mennonite Conference]] in 1910 but dropped the word "Amish" from their name in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Scott (writer)|Stephen Scott]]. ''An Introduction to Old Order and Conservative Mennonite Groups''. Intercourse, Penn.: 1996, pp. 122-123.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because there was no division in Europe, the Amish congregations remaining there took the same way as the change-minded Amish Mennonites in North America and slowly merged with the [[Mennonites]]. The last Amish congregation in Germany to merge was the [[Zweibrücken|Ixheim]] Amish congregation, which merged with the neighboring Mennonite Church in 1937. Some Mennonite congregations, including most in [[Alsace]], are descended directly from former Amish congregations.{{Sfn | Nolt | 1992}}{{Sfn | Nolt | 1992 | p = 227}}

=== 20th century ===
Even though there were splits among the Old Order in the 19th century in Mifflin County, Pennsylvania, it took until the time of the [[World War I]] until there was a major split among the Old Orders. At that time two very conservative affiliations emerged: the [[Swartzentruber Amish]] in [[Holmes County, Ohio]] and the [[Buchanan Amish affiliation|Buchanan Amish]] in [[Iowa]]. The Buchanan Amish soon were joined by like-minded congregations all over the country.{{Sfn | Nolt | 1992 | pp = 264-266}}

With World War I came the massive [[German language in the United States#Persecution during World War I|suppression of the German language in the US]] that eventually led to language shift of most Pennsylvania German speakers, leaving the Amish and other [[Old Order Movement|Old Orders]] as almost the only speakers by the end of the 20th century. This created a [[language barrier]] around the Amish that didn't exist before in that form.&lt;ref&gt;Donald B. Kraybill, Karen M. Johnson-Weiner, Steven M. Nolt. ''The Amish''. Baltimore: [[Johns Hopkins University Press]], 2013, page 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1920s the more change minded faction of the Old Order Amish, that wanted to adopt the car, broke away from the mainstream and organized under the name [[Beachy Amish]].{{Sfn | Nolt | 1992 | pp = 278-281}}

During the [[World War II|Second World War]] the old question of [[military service]] for the Amish came up again. Because Amish young men in general refused military service they ended up in the [[Civilian Public Service]] (CPS), where they worked mainly in forestry and hospitals. The fact that many young men worked in hospitals, where they had a lot of contact with more progressive Mennonites and the outside world, had the result that many of these men never joined the Amish church.{{Sfn | Nolt | 1992 | pp = 287-290}}

In the 1950s the Beachy Amish transformed into an evangelical church. The ones who wanted to preserve the old way of the Beachy became the [[Old Beachy Amish]].{{Sfn | Nolt | 1992 | pp = 278-281}}

Until about 1950 almost all Amish children attended small local non-Amish schools. But then school consolidation and mandatory schooling beyond eighth grade caused Amish opposition. Amish communities opened their own Amish schools. In 1972, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] exempted Amish pupils from [[compulsory education]] past [[junior high school|8th grade]]. By the end of the 20th century almost all Amish children attended Amish schools.&lt;ref&gt;Donald B. Kraybill, Karen M. Johnson-Weiner, Steven M. Nolt. ''The Amish''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Pres, 2013, pages 250-255.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last quarter of the 20th century a growing number of Amish men left farm working and started small businesses because of increasing pressure on small scale farming. Even though there is a wide variety of small businesses among the Amish, construction work and woodworking are quite widespread.&lt;ref&gt;Donald B. Kraybill, Karen M. Johnson-Weiner, Steven M. Nolt. ''The Amish'', Baltimore: 2013, p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt; In many Amish settlements, especially the larger ones, farmers are now a minority.&lt;ref&gt;Donald B. Kraybill, Karen M. Johnson-Weiner, Steven M. Nolt. ''The Amish''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Pres, 2013, pages 281-282.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the early 20th century Old Order Amish identity was not linked to the use of technologies, as the Old Order Amish and their rural neighbors used the same farm and household technologies. Questions about the use of technologies also did not play a role in the Old Order division of the second half of the 19th century. Telephones were the first important technology that was rejected, soon followed by the rejection of cars, tractors, radios and many other technological inventions of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Donald B. Kraybill, Karen M. Johnson-Weiner, Steven M. Nolt. ''The Amish''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Pres, 2013, page 313.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious practices==
{{Main|Amish religious practices}}

[[File:De Ausbund 329.jpg|right|thumb|upright|220px|alt=A page of ornate old German text. See description.|A scan of the historical document ''Diß Lied haben die sieben Brüder im Gefängnüß zu Gmünd gemacht '']]

Two key concepts for understanding Amish practices are their rejection of ''Hochmut'' (pride, arrogance, haughtiness) and the high value they place on ''Demut'' (humility) and ''[[Ordnung#Gelassenheit|Gelassenheit]]'' (calmness, composure, placidity), often translated as "submission" or "letting-be". Gelassenheit is perhaps better understood as a reluctance to be forward, to be self-promoting, or to assert oneself. The Amish's willingness to submit to the "Will of [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]]", expressed through group norms, is at odds with the individualism so central to the wider American culture. The Amish anti-individualist orientation is the motive for rejecting labor-saving technologies that might make one less dependent on the community. Modern innovations like electricity might spark a competition for status goods, or photographs might cultivate personal vanity. Electricity lines would be going against the Bible, which says that you shall not be "Conformed to the world" (Romans 12:2).{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Way of life==
{{Main|Amish way of life}}

[[File:DSCN4624 holmescountyamishbuggy e.jpg|right|thumb|alt=See description.|Amish couple in horse-driven buggy in rural [[Holmes County, Ohio]], September 2004]]

Amish lifestyle is regulated by the {{lang|de|[[Ordnung]]}} ("order"),&lt;ref name=PBSAE/&gt; which differs slightly from community to community, and, within a community, from district to district. What is acceptable in one community may not be acceptable in another. It is agreed upon within the community by the elders prior to the annual Communion. These include matters such as dress, permissible uses of technology, religious duties, and rules regarding interaction with outsiders. These elders are generally men.

Bearing children, raising them, and socializing with neighbors and relatives are the greatest functions of the Amish family. Amish typically believe that large families are a blessing from God. Community is central to the Amish way of life.

Working hard is considered godly, and some technological advancements have been considered undesirable because they reduce the need for hard work. Machines such as automatic floor cleaners in barns have historically been rejected as this provides young farmhands with too much free time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kraybill|first1=Donald|title=The Riddle of Amish Culture|date=September 27, 2001|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|isbn=080186772X|edition=Revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuisine===
{{See also|Cuisine of the Pennsylvania Dutch}}
Amish cuisine is noted for its simplicity and traditional qualities. Food plays an important part in Amish social life and is served at [[potluck]]s, weddings, fundraisers, farewells, and other events.&lt;ref&gt;Sherry Gore Zondervan. ''Simply Delicious Amish Cooking]''.Zondervan, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|0740797654}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lovina Eicher.

Many Amish communities have also established restaurants for visitors.

==Subgroups of Amish==
{{main|Subgroups of Amish}}
Over the years, the Amish churches have divided many times over doctrinal disputes. The largest group, the "Old Order" Amish, a conservative faction that separated from other Amish in the 1860s, are those that have most emphasized traditional practices and beliefs. The [[New Order Amish]] are a group of Amish that some scholars see best described as a subgroup of Old Order Amish, despite the name.

===Affiliations===
There are about 40 different Old Order Amish affiliations, the eight major affiliations are below, with Lancaster as the largest one in number of districts and population:&lt;ref&gt;Kraybill, Donald B., Karen M. Johnson-Weiner, and Steven M. Nolt (eds.). ''The Amish''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2013, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of technology by different Amish affiliations===
The table below indicates the use of certain technologies by different Amish affiliations. The use of cars is not allowed by any Old and New Order Amish, nor are radio, television or in most cases the use of the Internet. The three affiliations: "Lancaster", "Holmes Old Order" and "Elkhart-LaGrange" are not only the three largest affiliations, they also represent the mainstream among the Old Order Amish. The most conservative affiliations are above, the most modern ones below. Technologies used by very few are on the left; the ones used by most are on the right. The percentage of all Amish who use a technology is also indicated approximately.{{Clarify timeframe|date=November 2018}}

===Language===
{{Main|Pennsylvania German language}}
Most Old Order Amish speak [[Pennsylvania German language|Pennsylvania Dutch]], and refer to non-Amish people as "English", regardless of ethnicity.&lt;ref name=PBSAE/&gt; Some Amish who migrated to the United States in the 1850s speak a form of [[Bernese German]] or a [[Low Alemannic German|Low Alemannic]] [[Alsatian language|Alsatian dialect]]. According to one scholar, "today, almost all Amish are functionally bilingual in Pennsylvania Dutch and English; however, domains of usage are sharply separated. Pennsylvania Dutch dominates in most in-group settings, such as the dinner table and preaching in church services. In contrast, English is used for most reading and writing. English is also the medium of instruction in schools and is used in business transactions and often, out of politeness, in situations involving interactions with non-Amish. Finally, the Amish read prayers and sing in [[Standard German]] (which, in Pennsylvania Dutch, is called ''Hochdeitsch''&lt;ref group="lower-alpha"&gt;''Hochdeitsch'' is the Pennsylvania Dutch equivalent of the Standard German word ''Hochdeutsch''; both words literally mean "High German".&lt;/ref&gt;)&lt;!-- this is not a mistake. Do not alter spelling.--&gt; at church services. The distinctive use of three different languages serves as a powerful conveyor of Amish identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hurst |first1=Charles E. |last2=McConnell |first2=David L. |title=An Amish Paradox: Diversity and Change in the World's Largest Amish Community |year=2010 |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=0-8018-9398-4 |pages=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Although 'the English language is being used in more and more situations,' Pennsylvania Dutch is 'one of a handful of minority languages in the United States that is neither endangered nor supported by continual arrivals of immigrants.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hurst |first1=Charles E. |last2=McConnell |first2=David L. |title=An Amish Paradox: Diversity and Change in the World's Largest Amish Community |year=2010 |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=0-8018-9398-4 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnicity===
The Amish largely share a German or [[Swiss (people)|Swiss]]-[[Ethnic German|German]] ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh F. Gingerich and Rachel W. Kreider. ''Revised Amish and Amish Mennonite Genealogies''. Morgantown, Penn.:  2007.  This comprehensive volume gives names, dates, and places of births and deaths, and relationships of most of the known people of this unique sect from the early 1700s until about 1860 or so. The authors also include a five-page "History of the First Amish Communities in America".&lt;/ref&gt; They generally use the term "Amish" only for members of their faith community and not as an ethnic designation. However some [[List of Amish and their descendants|Amish descendants]] recognize their cultural background knowing that their genetic and cultural traits are uniquely different from other ethnicities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/genetic-disorders-hit-amish-hard/|title=Genetic Disorders Hit Amish Hard|website=Cbsnews.com|accessdate=January 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who choose to affiliate with the church, or young children raised in Amish homes, but too young to yet be church members, are considered to be Amish. Certain Mennonite churches have a high number of people who were formerly from Amish congregations. Although more Amish immigrated to North America in the 19th century than during the 18th century, most of today's Amish descend from 18th-century immigrants. The latter tended to emphasize tradition to a greater extent, and were perhaps more likely to maintain a separate Amish identity.{{Sfn | Nolt | 1992 | p = 104}}  There are a number of Amish Mennonite church groups that had never in their history been associated with the Old Order Amish because they split from the Amish mainstream in the time when the Old Orders formed in the 1860s and '70s. The former Western Ontario Mennonite Conference (WOMC) was made up almost entirely of former Amish Mennonites who reunited with the Mennonite Church in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gameo.org/encyclopedia/contents/W4781ME.html | last = Gingerich | first = Orland|title=Western Ontario Mennonite Conference|publisher=Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online|year=1990|accessdate=July 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orland Gingerich's book ''The Amish of Canada'' devotes the vast majority of its pages not to the Beachy or Old Order Amish, but to congregations in the former WOMC.

===Para-Amish groups===
There are also several groups, called "[[para-Amish]]" by [[G. C. Waldrep]] and others that share many characteristics with the Amish, like [[horse and buggy]] transportation, [[plain dress]], and the preservation of the [[German language]]. The members of these groups are largely of Amish origin, but these groups are not in fellowship with other Amish groups because they adhere to theological doctrines (e.g., [[assurance of salvation]]) or practices ([[community of goods]]) that are normally not accepted among mainstream Amish. One such former Amish group is the [[Bergholz Community]].

Because the Amish are usually baptized no earlier than 18 and children are not counted in local congregation numbers, it is hard to estimate their numbers.  Rough estimates from various studies placed their numbers at 125,000 in 1992; 166,000 in 2000; and 221,000 in 2008.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Thus, from 1992 to 2008, population growth among the Amish in North America was 84 percent (3.6 percent per year).  During that time they established 184 new settlements and moved into six new states.&lt;ref name="Trends"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www2.etown.edu/amishstudies/Population_Trends_1992_2008.asp|title= Population Trends 1992–2008 | publisher= Young Center for Anabaptist and Pietist Studies, Elizabethtown College| accessdate= July 8, 2009 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090606152522/http://www2.etown.edu/amishstudies/Population_Trends_1992_2008.asp | archivedate= June 6, 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, about 165,620 Old Order Amish resided in the United States, of whom 73,609 were church members.{{Sfn | Kraybill | 2000}}{{Rp | needed = yes|date=October 2012}}  The Amish are among the fastest-growing populations in the world, with an average of seven children per family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1 = Julia A |last1 = Ericksen | last2 = Ericksen | first2 = Eugene P | last3 = Hostetler | first3 = John A | last4 = Huntington | first4 = Gertrude E |title=Fertility Patterns and Trends among the Old Order Amish |journal= Population Studies |volume=33 |issue = 2 |date=July 1979 |issn=0032-4728 |oclc=39648293 |pages=255–76 | doi=10.2307/2173531|pmid = 11630609 |jstor = 2173531 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, a few religious bodies, including the Amish, changed the way their adherents were reported to better match the standards of the Association of Statisticians of American Religious Bodies (ASARB). When looking at all Amish adherents and not solely Old Order Amish, there were about 241,000 Amish adherents in 28 U.S. states in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Manns|first=Molly|title=Indiana's Amish Population|url=http://www.incontext.indiana.edu/2012/nov-dec/article2.asp|work=InContext|publisher=Indiana Business Research Center|accessdate=January 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 there were Old Order communities in 31 U.S. states.

Because of rapid population growth in Amish communities, new settlements are formed to obtain enough affordable farmland. Other reasons for new settlements include locating in isolated areas that support their lifestyle, moving to areas with cultures conducive to their way of life, maintaining proximity to family or other Amish groups, and sometimes to resolve church or leadership conflicts.&lt;ref name="Trends"/&gt;

In 2016, several dozen Old Order Amish families founded two new settlements in [[Kings County, Prince Edward Island|Kings County]] in the province of Prince Edward Island.

====Europe====
In Europe there was no split between Old Order Amish and Amish Mennonites; like the Amish Mennonites in North America, the European Amish assimilated into the Mennonite mainstream during the second half of the 19th century through the first decades of the 20th century. Eventually they dropped the word "Amish" from the names of their congregations and lost their Amish identity and culture. The last European Amish congregation joined the Mennonites in 1937 in Ixheim, today part of [[Zweibrücken]] in the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate region]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gameo.org/index.php?title=Ixheim_(Rheinland-Pfalz,_Germany)|title=Ixheim (Rheinland-Pfalz, Germany)|publisher=Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online |website=Gameo.org|accessdate=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seekers and joiners==
{{main|Seeker (Anabaptism)}}

Only a few outsiders, so-called seekers,{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} have ever joined the Amish. Since 1950 only some 75 people have joined and remained members of the Amish.&lt;ref name="Donald B. Kraybill 2013, page 159"&gt;Donald B. Kraybill, Karen M. Johnson-Weiner, Steven M. Nolt. ''The Amish''. Baltimore: 2013, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1990 some twenty people of [[Russian Mennonite]] background have joined the Amish in [[Aylmer, Ontario]].&lt;ref name="Donald B. Kraybill 2013"&gt;Donald B. Kraybill, Karen M. Johnson-Weiner, Steven M. Nolt. ''The Amish''. Baltimore: 2013, p. 160f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two whole Christian communities have joined the Amish: The Church at [[Smyrna, Maine]], one of the five [[Christian Communities (Elmo Stoll)|Christian Communities]] of [[Elmo Stoll]] after Stoll's death&lt;ref&gt;[[G.C. Waldrep]]. "The New Order Amish And Para-Amish Groups: Spiritual Renewal Within Tradition".

Waldrep]]. "The New Order Amish And Para-Amish Groups: Spiritual Renewal Within Tradition". ''Mennonite Quarterly Review'', vol. 3 (2008), p. 416.&lt;/ref&gt; The "[[Michigan Churches]]", with which Smyrna and Manton affiliated, are said to be more open to seekers and converts than other Amish churches. Most of the members of these two para-Amish communities originally came from [[Plain people|Plain churches]], i. e. Old Order Amish, [[Old Order Mennonite]] or [[Old German Baptist Brethren]].

More people have tested Amish life for weeks, months, or even years, but in the end decided not to join. Others remain close to the Amish but never think of joining.&lt;ref name="Donald B. Kraybill 2013, page 159"/&gt;

[[Stephen Scott (writer)|Stephen Scott]], himself a convert to the [[Old Order River Brethren]], distinguishes four types of seekers:
* ''Checklist seekers'', who look for a couple of certain specifications.
* ''Cultural seekers'', who are more enchanted with the lifestyle of the Amish than with their religion.
* ''Spiritual utopian seekers'', who look for true [[New Testament]] Christianity.
* ''Stability seekers'', who come with emotional issues, often from [[Dysfunctional family|dysfunctional families]].&lt;ref name="Donald B. Kraybill 2013"/&gt;

Some of these disorders are rare or unique, and are serious enough to increase the mortality rate among Amish children. The Amish are aware of the advantages of [[exogamy]], but for religious reasons marry only within their communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.genomenewsnetwork.org/articles/2004/07/23/sids.php |title=Genomics in Amish Country | last =Ruder | first = Katherine 'Kate' |date=July 23, 2004 |publisher=Genome News Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of Amish accept these as "Gottes Wille" (God's will); they reject the use of preventive genetic tests prior to marriage and genetic testing of unborn children to discover genetic disorders. However, Amish are willing to participate in studies of genetic diseases. Their extensive family histories are useful to researchers investigating diseases such as [[Alzheimer's]], [[Parkinson's]], and [[macular degeneration]].

While the Amish are at an increased risk for some genetic disorders, researchers have found their tendency for clean living can lead to better health. Overall cancer rates in the Amish are reduced and tobacco-related cancers in Amish adults are 37 percent and non-tobacco-related cancers are 72 percent of the rate for Ohio adults. The Amish are protected against many types of cancer both through their lifestyle and through genes that may reduce their susceptibility to cancer. Even skin cancer rates are lower for Amish, despite the fact many Amish make their living working outdoors where they are exposed to sunlight. They are typically covered and dressed by wearing wide-brimmed hats and long sleeves which protect their skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internalmedicine.osu.edu/genetics/article.cfm?id=5307 |title=Amish Have Lower Rates of Cancer, Ohio State Study Shows |date=January 1, 2010 |publisher=[[Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center|Ohio State University Medical Center]] |accessdate=January 6, 2010 |location=Columbus, OH |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616103822/http://www.internalmedicine.osu.edu/genetics/article.cfm?id=5307 |archivedate=June 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treating genetic problems is the mission of [[Clinic for Special Children]] in [[Strasburg, Pennsylvania]], which has developed effective treatments for such problems as [[maple syrup urine disease]], a previously fatal disease. The clinic is embraced by most Amish, ending the need for parents to leave the community to receive proper care for their children, an action that might result in shunning. Another clinic is DDC Clinic for Special Needs Children, located in [[Middlefield, Ohio]], for special-needs children with inherited or metabolic disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ddcclinic.org/ |title=DDC Clinic for Special Needs Children |date=October 7, 2011 |accessdate=November 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DDC Clinic provides treatment, research, and educational services to Amish and non-Amish children and their families.

''People's Helpers'' is an Amish-organized network of mental health caregivers who help families dealing with mental illness and recommend professional counselors.{{Sfn | Kraybill | 2001 | p = 105}}  Suicide rates for the Amish are about half that of the general population.{{Refn|group=lower-alpha|The overall suicide rate in 1980 in the USA was 12.5 per 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Kraybill|others=et al|title=Suicide Patterns in a Religious Subculture: The Old Order Amish|journal=International Journal of Moral and Social Studies|volume=1|date=Autumn 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Old Order Amish do not typically carry private commercial health insurance.&lt;ref name = "Post"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/05/AR2006100501360.html |title=Amish Reluctantly Accept Donations |last=Rubinkam |first=Michael |work=The Washington Post |date=October 5, 2006 |accessdate=March 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amish Studies – Beliefs|url=http://www2.etown.edu/amishstudies/Beliefs.asp|publisher=Young Center for Anabaptist &amp; Pietist Studies, Elizabethtown College|accessdate=February 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A handful of American hospitals, starting in the mid-1990s, created special outreach programs to assist the Amish.

Although not forbidden, most Amish do not practice any form of [[birth control]]. They are against abortion and also find "artificial insemination, genetics, eugenics, and stem cell research" to be "inconsistent with Amish values and beliefs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Transcultural concepts in nursing care | first=Margaret M. |last=Andrews |first2=Joyceen S. |last2=Boyle |url= https://books.google.com/?id=Tq-rL8VcQBQC&amp;pg=PA455&amp;lpg=PA455&amp;dq=abortion+amish | publisher=Lippincott | year=2002 | accessdate=January 19, 2008 | page=455 |isbn=978-0-7817-3680-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amish life in the modern world==

As time has passed, the Amish have felt pressures from the modern world. Issues such as taxation, education, law and its enforcement, and occasional discrimination and hostility are areas of difficulty.

The Amish way of life in general has increasingly diverged from that of modern society. On occasion, this has resulted in sporadic discrimination and hostility from their neighbors, such as throwing of stones or other objects at Amish horse-drawn carriages on the roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Iseman|first=David|title=Trumbull probes attack on woman, Amish buggy|newspaper=[[The Vindicator]]|date=May 18, 1988|page=1|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1uBRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=GoUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5866,396113|accessdate=July 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stone Amish|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-15ZAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gUgNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6383,209217&amp;dq=amish+stoning+-fulham+-muslim|accessdate=July 12, 2011|newspaper=[[Painesville Telegraph]]|date=September 12, 1949|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=State Police Arrest 25 Boys in Rural Areas|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=q8Q_AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=z1cMAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=amish%20stoning%20-fulham%20-muslim&amp;pg=2772%2C3130040|accessdate=July 12, 2011|newspaper=[[The Vindicator]]|date=October 25, 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Amish do not usually educate their children past the [[eighth grade]], believing that the basic knowledge offered up to that point is sufficient to prepare one for the Amish lifestyle. Almost no Amish go to high school and college. In many communities, the Amish operate their own schools, which are typically [[one-room schoolhouse]]s with teachers (usually young, unmarried women) from the Amish community. On May 19, 1972, Jonas Yoder and Wallace Miller of the Old Order Amish, and Adin Yutzy of the Conservative Amish Mennonite Church were each fined $5 for refusing to send their children, aged 14 and 15, to high school. In ''[[Wisconsin v. Yoder]]'' (1972), the Wisconsin Supreme Court overturned the conviction,&lt;ref&gt;''Wisconsin v. Yoder'', 182 N.W.2d 539 (Wis. 1971).&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] affirmed this, finding the benefits of universal education were not sufficient justification to overcome scrutiny under the [[Free Exercise Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;''Wisconsin v. Yoder'', 406 U.S. 205, 32 L.Ed.2d 15, 92 S.Ct. 1526 (1972).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Amish are subject to sales and property taxes.  As they seldom own motor vehicles, they rarely have occasion to pay motor vehicle registration fees or spend money in the purchase of fuel for vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rumble strips removed after the Amish say they're dangerous |url=http://www.wwmt.com/articles/rumble-1366086-joseph-0in.html |accessdate=November 24, 2011 |quote=Dobberteen is one of a growing number of people in St. Joseph County who believes that the Amish shouldn't have a say in what happens with a state road. 'Some people are saying, "Well jeeze, you know the Amish people don't pay taxes for that, why are we filling them in" what do you think about that? We pay our taxes,' said Dobberteen.

In 1965, this policy was codified into law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1402- |title=U.S. Code collection |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |date= |accessdate=September 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-employed individuals in certain sects do not pay into or receive benefits from the United States Social Security system.

As to the constitutional claim, the court held that since accommodating the Amish beliefs under the circumstances would unduly interfere with the fulfillment of the overriding governmental interest in assuring mandatory and continuous participation in and contribution to the Social Security system, the limitation on religious liberty involved here was justified. Consequently, in reversing the district court, the Supreme Court held that, unless Congress provides otherwise, the tax imposed on employers to support the Social Security system must be uniformly applicable to all. |date=August 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publishing==
In 1964 [[Pathway Publishers]] was founded by two Amish farmers to print more print material about the Amish and Anabaptists in general. It is located in [[Lagrange, Indiana]], and [[Aylmer]], [[Ontario]]. Pathway has become the major publisher of Amish material. Pathway publishes a number of school textbooks, general reading books, and periodicals. There are also a number of private enterprises who publish everything from general reading to reprints of older literature that has been considered of great value to Amish families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gameo.org/index.php?title=Pathway_Publishers|title=Pathway Publishers |publisher=Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online |website=Gameo.org|accessdate=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Amish read the Pennsylvania German newspaper ''[[Hiwwe wie Driwwe]]'', and some of them even contribute dialect texts.

==Similar groups==
Groups that sprang from the same late 19th century [[Old Order Movement]] as the Amish share their [[Pennsylvania Dutch|Pennsylvania German heritage]] and often still retain similar features in dress. These Old Order groups include different subgroups of [[Old Order Mennonite]]s, traditional [[Schwarzenau Brethren]] and [[Old Order River Brethren]]. The [[Noah Hoover Mennonite|Noah Hoover Old Order Mennonites]] are so similar in outward aspects to the Old Order Amish (dress, beards, horse and buggy, extreme restrictions on modern technology, Pennsylvania German language), that they are often perceived as Amish and even called Amish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.7newsbelize.com/sstory.php?nid=25261|title=7 News Belize|work=7newsbelize.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameo.org/encyclopedia/contents/S72788ME.html|title=Stauffer Mennonite Church |publisher=Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online |website=Gameo.org|accessdate=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The few remaining [[Conservative Friends|Plain Quakers]] are similar in manner and lifestyle, including their attitudes toward war, but are unrelated to the Amish.{{sfn |Hamm|2003|p=101}} Early Quakers were influenced, to some degree, by the [[Anabaptists]], and in turn influenced the Amish in colonial Pennsylvania. Almost all modern Quakers have since abandoned their traditional dress.{{sfn|Hamm|2003|pp=103–5}}

==The Amish and the Native Americans==

The [[Northkill Amish Settlement]], established in 1740 in [[Berks County, Pennsylvania]], was the first identifiable Amish community in the [[new world]]. During the [[French and Indian War]], the so-called Hochstetler Massacre occurred: Local Indian tribes attacked the Jacob Hochstetler [[homestead (buildings)|homestead]] in the Northkill settlement on September 19, 1757. The sons of the family took their arms but father Jacob did not allow them to shoot. Jacob Sr.'s  wife, Anna (Lorentz) Hochstetler, a daughter (name unknown) and Jacob Jr. were killed by the Indians. Jacob Sr. and sons Joseph and Christian were taken captive. Jacob escaped after about 8 months, but the boys were held for several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nolt|first1=Steven M.|title=The Amish: A Concise Introduction|date=2016|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Amish - PBS|website=Pbs.org|accessdate=January 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cones Kupwah Snowflower, a Shawnee genealogist, the Amish and Quakers were known to incorporate Native Americans into their families to prevent them from ill treatment, especially after the [[Indian Removal Act|Removal Act of 1832]].{{clarify|[[Indian Removal Act]]?|date=April 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;Cones Kupwah Snowflower in NAAH No. 14 July 1996 "Let's Get Physical"&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=July 2017}}

The Amish, as pacifists, did not engage in warfare with Native Americans, nor displace them directly, but were part of a wave of European immigrants who forced Native Americans westward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mcusa-archives.org/Resources/gathering--amishorshawnee.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219184613/http://mcusa-archives.org/Resources/gathering--amishorshawnee.html |archivedate=December 19, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Denial of Mass Killings}}
'''Armenian Genocide denial''' is the act of denying [[Armenian Genocide|the planned systematic genocide]] of 1.5 million [[Armenians]] during World War I, conducted by the [[Imperial Government (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman government]]. Turkey similarly denies the genocides perpetrated against indigenous Assyrians and Greeks  during the same period. As form of [[denialism]], it can be compared to similar [[Historical negationism|negationist historical revisionism]]s such as [[Holocaust denial]] and [[Nanking Massacre denial]].

The [[Armenian Genocide]] is almost [[Unanimity|unanimously]] acknowledged as a historical fact by historians and genocide scholars alike.&lt;ref name=cons/&gt; It is also widely considered to have been the first modern [[genocide]],&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Niall.

==Terminology==
According to historian [[Yair Auron]], "there can be no doubt about the fact of [Armenian] genocide itself. In this sense, the denial of the Armenian genocide is very similar to the denial of the Holocaust."&lt;ref&gt;[[Yair Auron]], ''The Banality of Indifference: Zionism and the Armenian Genocide''. Transaction Publishers, 2000, p. 53. {{ISBN|0-7658-0881-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the notable scholars that dispute its designation, [[Bernard Lewis]], [[Stanford J. Shaw|Stanford Shaw]] and [[Guenter Lewy]] acknowledge the historical event and its implications but reject a genocidal intent in favor of "uniqueness" of the [[Holocaust]] as only true genocide.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} [[Justin McCarthy (American historian)|Justin McCarthy]], [[Heath W. Lowry|Heath Lowry]] and [[Eberhard Jäckel]] reject the designation altogether, and have met much criticism and accusations from other scholars as promoting Armenian Genocide denial.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===The term "genocide"===
The term "genocide" was coined by the Polish Jew [[Raphael Lemkin]] in 1943, who had escaped Nazi rule, although the full extent of [[the Holocaust]] was not yet known at the time. He later used it to describe what he had heard about the Armenian Genocide: in a 1949 CBS interview with Quincy Howe, Lemkin explained, "I became interested in genocide because it happened so many times. It happened to the Armenians, then after the Armenians, [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] took action."&lt;ref name="A PBS Documentary Makes Its Case for the Armenian Genocide, With or Without a Debate"&gt;{{Cite news

====Genocide convention====
Turkish denialists claim that the "intent to destroy" clause of the Genocide Convention has not been met, and that it is therefore not a genocide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

 | quote = But the third element is the most important: there has to be "an intent of destroying", in part or in whole the said group. This key-description helps to differentiate between genocide and other forms of homicide, which are the consequences of other motives such as in the case of wars, uprisings etc. Homicide becomes genocide when the latent or apparent intention of physical destruction is directed at members of any one of the national, ethnic, racial or religious groups simply because they happen to be members of that group. The concept of numbers only becomes significant when it can be taken as a sign of such an intention against the group. That is why, as Sartre said in speaking of genocide on the occasion of the Russell Tribunal on the Vietnam War, that one must study the facts objectively in order to prove if this intention exists, even in an implicit manner.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{elucidate|date=April 2014}}

After vague claims made by a speaker from the United Kingdom, [[Geoffrey Robertson]], a noted British barrister and specialist in the field of human rights, observed that the British government refused to acknowledge the Armenian Genocide by saying that evidence for it was "not sufficiently unequivocal". He pointed out that this phrase 1) was an [[oxymoron]] and 2) represented an invented standard of proof. He explained: "There are only two standards of proof in UK law: the civil standard (on the balance of probabilities; i.e. more likely than not) and the criminal standard (beyond reasonable doubt)". He further observed that recent British governments have not taken into account that the terms used by the British government of the time in referring to 1915 entirely anticipated the modern definition of genocide and that the drafters of the Genocide Convention had 1915 in mind when drafting the new international crime.&lt;ref&gt;http://groong.usc.edu/Geoffrey-Robertson-QC-Genocide.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===The term "deportation"===
Currently, regarding the activities performed under the [[Tehcir Law]] of May 1915, the [[Republic of Turkey]] rejects the use of the word "deportation" and "refugee". Turkey instead uses the words "relocation" and "immigrant", respectively. Turkey claims in its state-supported ''Views Against Genocide Allegations'' that all the destination regions were within the Ottoman Empire's borders, and that the Ottoman government recognized these "immigrants" as its citizens and took extensive measures to record the type, quantity, and value of their property, as well as the names of the owners and where they were sent.&lt;ref name=kultur&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Turkish government position==
In 2016 Turkish President [[Recep Tayyip Erdogan]] said "Our attitude on the Armenian issue has been clear from the beginning. We will never accept the accusations of genocide". The [[Turkish government]] does not deny that many Armenians were killed by the [[Ottoman military]], but disputes the death toll, and emphasizes that there were deaths on both sides during [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |website= Deutsche Welle (www.dw.com, "German wave") |title= Erdogan: Turkey will 'never accept' genocide charges {{!}} DW {{!}} 04.06.2016 |accessdate= 2018-02-07 |url= http://www.dw.com/en/erdogan-turkey-will-never-accept-genocide-charges/a-19307115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars give several reasons for the Turkish government's denial including the preservation of [[national identity]], but also territorial concerns (called "[[Treaty of Sèvres|Sevres Syndrome]]"). Turkey's territorial concerns are exacerbated by Armenia's refusal to recognize Turkey's eastern borders. Another reason is the demand for [[Armenian Genocide reparations|reparations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = ABC-CLIO| isbn = 978-1-4408-3161-4| last1 = Tatz| first1 = Colin| last2 = Higgins| first2 = Winton| title = The Magnitude of Genocide| date = 2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Armenian diaspora groups have in recent years become more focused on financial reparations. The Armenian Genocide Reparations Study Group has released a study that was partly funded by Armenian advocacy organizations which includes various recommendations for how to calculate a possible reparations package. Genocide scholar [[Henry C. Theriault]] who chaired the panel has said that the question of reparations is "obviously a pretty central one". The Turkish government position is that reparations do not need to paid for the events of 1915. Human rights historians have said that recognition by Turkey would undermine any legal defense Turkey might have to future compensation claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Gladstone| first = Rick| title = Armenian Groups Are Increasingly Focused on Reparations for Genocide| work = The New York Times| accessdate = 2018-02-07| date = 2015-04-23| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/24/world/europe/turkey-fear-of-reparations-possibly-in-many-billions-is-a-factor-in-armenian-genocide-denials.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Taner Akçam|Taner Akcam]] has written the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Zed Books| isbn = 978-1-84277-527-1| last = Akçam| first = Taner| title = From Empire to Republic: Turkish Nationalism and the Armenian Genocide| date = 2004-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In Turkish discourse, the following argument is commonly heard: "If we accept the Genocide, then the claim for reparations will soon follow." It shows that the main fear is not what we should call the event, but what comes after the event.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Fatma Muge Gocek, many Turkish journalists have viewed the issue of recognition as "an imposition on the Turkish state and society, one that would solely benefit the Armenians". In one editoral a Turkish journalist wrote "If you once acknowledge, then see what will happen next? From demands for restitution to land...".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-062458-3| last = Gocek| first = Fatma Muge| title = Denial of Violence: Ottoman Past, Turkish Present, and Collective Violence Against the Armenians, 1789-2009| date = 2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Efforts at rebuttal==
The Ottoman Empire wanted to remove the threat of [[Armenian resistance]] and the Turkish authorities today hold the position that the deaths incurred by Armenians as a whole were the result of the turmoil of [[World War I]] and that the [[Ottoman Empire]] was fighting against Russia, [[Armenian volunteer units]], and the [[Armenian militia]]. However, the Armenians had neither a police force nor an army.&lt;ref&gt;Grenke, Arthur. ''God, greed, and genocide: the Holocaust through the centuries''. 2005, page 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Heather Rae noted that scholars have long been denied access to Ottoman archives, which Turkish sources often refer to in their works. In the late 1980s access was granted to some archives by the Turkish government, but it appears that the material was limited and the government took a very selective approach to who was allowed to study the material.&lt;ref&gt;Heather Rae.

New York: Palgrave MacMillan, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Taner Akcam]] also writes about the "careful selection" of Ottoman archive materials. "While we are missing a significant portion of these papers, what remains in the Ottoman archives and in court records is sufficient to show that the [[Committee of Union and Progress|CUP]] Central Committee, and the [[Special Organization (Ottoman Empire)|Special Organization]] is set up to carry out its plan, did deliberately attempt to destroy the Armenian population".&lt;ref&gt;Akcam. ''A Shameful Act'', p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inter-ethnic violence===
According to McCarthy, the genocide was a two sided battle: "when they [the Armenians] advanced victoriously under the protection of the [[Imperial Russian Army|Russian Army]], the same spectacle occurred as in 1915, but this time it was Turks who were attacked by Armenians, aided and possibly commanded and directed by Russia."&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, Justin. ''Death and Exile: The Ethnic Cleansing of Ottomon Muslims, 1821–1922''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deportations===
The Turkish authorities maintain the position that the Ottoman Empire did not exercise the degree of control which the opposing parties claim. Turkey accepts that there were Armenian deaths as a result of Ottoman decisions, but states that the responsible Ottoman bureaucrats and military personnel were tried. [[Bernard Lewis]] believes that what he names the "tremendous massacres"&lt;ref name="ATA"&gt;Lewis, Bernard.

were not "a deliberate preconceived decision of the Ottoman government".&lt;ref&gt;Getler, Michael.

Retrieved 9 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casualties===
[[File:Armenian Genocide Museum Yerevan courtesy of american times 10.jpg|thumb|Survivors]]
Turkish scholars and other denialists reject the academic consensus of up to 1.5 million Armenian deaths attributed to the genocide. McCarthy calculated an estimate of the pre-war Armenian population, then subtracted his estimate of survivors, arriving at a figure of less than 600,000 for Armenian casualties for the period 1914 to 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Justin McCarthy, ''The End of Ottoman Anatolia'', in ''Muslims and Minorities: The Population of Ottoman Anatolia and the End of the Empire'', New York Univ. Press, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a more recent essay, he projected that if the Armenian records of 1913 were accurate, 250,000 more deaths should be added, for a total of 850,000.&lt;ref&gt;Justin McCarthy, ''The Population of the Ottoman Armenians'', in ''The Armenians in the Late Ottoman Period'', The Turkish Historical Society For The Council Of Culture, Arts And Publications Of The Grand National Assembly Of Turkey, Ankara, 2001, pp. 65–86&lt;/ref&gt;

McCarthy's numbers were highly criticized by academia for underrepresenting the actual numbers. Some of them, like Frédéric Paulin, have severely criticized McCarthy's [[methodology]] and suggested that it is flawed.&lt;ref&gt;Frédéric Paulin, ''Négationnisme et théorie des populations stables : le cas du génocide arménien'', in Hervé Lebras (dir.), ''L'Invention des populations. Biologie, Idéologie et politique'', Editions Odile Jacob, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Hilmar Kaiser&lt;ref&gt;Hilmar Kaiser, a German expert on the Armenian genocide, also criticizes McCarthy's calculation techniques in an interview with Dirk van Delft published in the ''NRC Handelsblad'', p. 51, Amsterdam, Saturday, 27 May 2000&lt;/ref&gt; another specialist has made similar claims, as have professor [[Vahakn N. Dadrian]]&lt;ref&gt;Vahakn N. Dadrian, ''Warrant for Genocide: Key Elements of Turko-Armenian Conflict'', New Brunswick, N.J.: Transaction Publishers, 1999. See also his essay: ''Ottoman Archives and Denial of the Armenian Genocide'', in ''The Armenian Genocide: History, Politics, Ethics'', R.G. Hovanissian, ed.

September, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; The critics not only question McCarthy's methodology and resulting calculations, but also his primary sources, the Ottoman censuses. They point out that there was no official statistic census in 1912; rather those numbers were based on the records of 1905 which were conducted during the reign of Sultan Hamid.&lt;ref&gt;Kemal H. Karpat, ''Ottoman Population 1830–1914: Demographic and Social Characteristics'', Madiscon, WI: University of Wisconsin Press, 1985.

May 1919.&lt;/ref&gt; While Ottoman censuses claimed an Armenian population of 1.2 million, [[Fa'iz El-Ghusein]] (the [[Kaimakam]] of [[Kharpout]]) wrote that there were about 1.9 million Armenians in the Ottoman Empire,&lt;ref name="ma"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some modern scholars estimate over 2 million. German official [[Max Erwin von Scheubner-Richter]] wrote that fewer than 100,000 Armenians survived the genocide, the rest having been exterminated ({{lang-de |ausgerottet}}).&lt;ref&gt;Fisk, Robert (2005), The Great War for Civilisation: The Conquest of the Middle East, New York: Alfred A Knopf, {{ISBN|1-84115-007-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{rp |329–30}}

==Conflict resolution==
{{See also|Armenian-Turkish relations}}

The Turkish authorities have put forth certain conditions before attempting to reconcile with Armenia. Turkey closed its border with Armenia in 1993 following the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]] between Armenia and [[Turkic languages|Turkic-speaking]] [[Azerbaijan]]. The borders have remained closed because the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute has not been settled to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Many references that cite genocidal intent use the "Talat Pasha telegrams", which are a series of documents by the Interior Minister [[Mehmed Talat Pasha]], to constitute concrete evidence that the deaths were implemented as a state policy. Pasha was tied to the "Kill every Armenian man, woman, and child without concern" order in these documents.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=feq-KS57zeUC&amp;dq= Congressional Record, V. 151, Pt. 6, 21 April 2005 to 5 May 2005, Part 16] (2009), p. 758: Rep.

==Denialism by prominent figures==

===The 69 American historians – the "Lewis Affair"===
On 19 May 1985, ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]'' ran an advertisement in which a group of 69 American historians called on Congress not to adopt the resolution on the Armenian Genocide.&lt;ref name="Lewis Affair"&gt;''[[Yves Ternon]]''.

Wayne State University Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-8143-2777-X}}, 9780814327777. pp. 237–348. "''The "Lewis Affair" began in the United States on May 19, 1985, with the publication, both in the New York Times and in the Washington Post, of an advertisement addressed to members of the House of Representatives. The statement was signed by sixty-nine academics in Turkish studies and sponsored by the Assembly of Turkish American Associations. Among the signatories was the name of Bernard Lewis, the Cleveland E.

Lewis' stature provided a lofty cover for the Turkish national agenda of obfuscating academic research on the Armenian Genocide. &lt;...&gt; Later on Bernard Lewis reversed his position and changed the text. In 1985 he signed a petition to the U.S. Congress protesting the plan to make April 24, the day on which the Armenians commemorate the victims of the Genocide, a national American-Armenian memorial day, mentioning man's inhumanity to man.

The Assembly revealed first of all that a majority of the scholars were not specialists in the subject matter of the period of the genocide, and more importantly that a very large number of the signators were recipients of grants from Turkish government sources. [[Speros Vryonis]] (1993) has since reviewed the data and has similarly concluded that a considerable number of the signators, and their institutions, were direct recipients of research funds from Turkey.''"&lt;/ref&gt;
According to [[Yair Auron]], an Israeli historian, scholar and expert specializing in genocide studies and racism, this advertisement is a good example of one of many Turkish attempts to influence academia, a project on which Turkey has spent enormous funds.&lt;ref&gt;''Yair Auron''.

After publication of the statement, professor [[Gérard Chaliand]] of [[University of Paris V: René Descartes|Paris V – Sorbonne]] University expressed disappointment that Lewis had signed. Lewis responded that the statement was an attempt to avoid damaging Turkish-American relationships and that it included a call for Turkey to open its archives, but the former was not mentioned in the statement.&lt;ref name="Lewis Affair" /&gt; Some of the other signatories confessed later that there are deliberate attempts by the Turkish government and its allies to muddle and deny the issue.

In October 2000, when the House of Representatives of the US was to discuss the resolution on the Armenian Genocide, Turkish politician [[Şükrü Elekdağ]] admitted that the statement had become useless because none of the original signatories besides [[Justin McCarthy (American historian)|Justin McCarthy]] would agree to sign a new, similar declaration.&lt;ref&gt;Lou Ann Matossian.

====The resignation of Donald Quataert====
One of the 69 signatories of the 1985 statement to the US Congress was Donald Quataert. He resigned from the position of the chairman of the board of directors of the Institute of Turkish Studies, which he had held since 2001. As he announced, he had to resign due to the pressure of the Turkish ambassador Nabi Shensoy after he characterised the massacres of Armenians in Turkey as genocide. Shensoy rejected the allegations. Quataert's resignation created a scandal in academia and a number of members of the board of directors of the Institute resigned as well after the announcement. [[Mervat Hatem]] the director of [[Middle East Studies Association]] addressed the Prime Minister of Turkey Erdogan a harsh letter, whereby he expressed grave concerns with the announcements of Turkish officials to stop the financing of the Institute if Quataert didn't renounce his assessments publicly. Hatem also noted, that "the resignations are in contradiction with those many requests to leave the discussion and the assessment of the Armenian Genocide to the academia (instead of discussing it on the political arena) that Turkey has been making." According to the announcement by Quataert, the members of the board of directors on the Institute of Turkish Studies were surprised to find out, that the funding of the institute by Turkey is not a sign of trust but a gift, that can be annulled at any moment.&lt;ref&gt;''David Holthouse''.

===Comparison with Holocaust and Israeli stance===
Officially the state of [[Israel]] neither recognizes nor denies the Armenian Genocide. Politicians from primarily left wing and centrist parties such as [[Meretz]] and [[Kadima]], but also occasionally right wing parties such as [[Likud]], have been promoting recognition and commemoration of the Armenian Genocide. This cooperation is significant since it includes activists and politicians who usually are on the opposing sides of the political spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/MK-fails-to-block-Knesset-talks-on-Armenian-genocide]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Yet the official line of all Israeli governments has been to keep the status quo, partially because of modern-day real-politik reasons. Right-wing party [[Yisrael Beiteinu]] (Israel Our Home) claims that Genocide discussions would jeopardise [[Azerbaijan–Israel relations|Israel-Azerbaijan]] and [[Israel–Turkey relations|Israel-Turkish relations]] and hurt close economic and military cooperation with them. These two countries are essential for Israel's regional policy and interests opposing [[Iran]]. In 2008, [[Yosef Shagal]], an Azerbaijani Jew and now retired Israeli parliamentarian from Israel Our Home stated in an interview to Azerbaijan media (which officially denies the genocide): "I find it deeply offensive, and even blasphemous to compare the Holocaust of European Jewry during the Second World War with the mass extermination of the Armenian people during the First World War. Jews were killed because they were Jews, but Armenians provoked Turkey and should blame themselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Historians mark that "the genocide of the Armenians has been denied to this day by successive Turkish governments, with the exception of the short-lived imperial government that existed between the end of [[World War I]] and the ascendance of the Kemalist nationalist regime in the early 1920s."&lt;ref&gt;Rae.

Mark Potok, the editor of [[Intelligence Report]], wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Some semi-official Turkish narratives now claim, in effect, that the Armenians actually carried out genocidal attacks on the Turks. Neo-Nazis and their scholarly enablers say that "the Jews" manufactured tall tales of the Holocaust in order to extort money and other concessions from postwar Germany. Neo-Confederates like Doug Wilson, a far-right pastor in Moscow, Idaho, tell their listeners with a [[Straight face test|straight face]] that the Civil War was nothing less than a defense of righteous Christian civilization and that blacks really didn't mind slavery. These lies all serve current agendas—to demonize and minimize the historical claims of Armenians, Jews, and African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

[[Colin Tatz]], Professor of [[Macquarie University]], considers the nature of Turkish denial industry as "pernicious, outrageous and continued": "Here is a modern state, totally dedicated, at home and abroad, to extraordinary actions to have every hint or mention of an Armenian genocide removed, contradicted, explained, countered, justified, mitigated, rationalised, trivialised and relativised."&lt;ref&gt;With Intent to Destroy: Reflecting on Genocide, by Colin Martin Tatz, 2003, Verso, 222 p., {{ISBN|1-85984-550-9}}, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; In their book ''Criminological Perspectives'', E. McLaughlin, J. Muncie and G. Hughes conclude: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;If the Turkish government can deny that the Armenian genocide happened; if revisionist historians and neo-Nazis deny that Holocaust took place; if powerful states all around the world today can systematically deny the systematic violations of human rights they are carrying out – then we know that we're in bad shape.&lt;ref&gt;Criminological Perspectives: Essential Readings, Eugene McLaughlin, John Muncie, Gordon Hughes, Open University, SAGE, 2003, 656 p., {{ISBN|0-7619-4144-4}}, p. 559&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1990, psychologist [[Robert Jay Lifton]] received a letter from Nuzhet Kandemir, Turkish ambassador to the United States, questioning his inclusion of references to the Armenian Genocide in one of his books. The ambassador inadvertently included a draft of a letter, presented by denier [[Heath W. Lowry]], advising the ambassador on how to prevent mention of the Armenian Genocide in scholarly works. Lowry was later named to the Atatürk chair of Ottoman Studies at [[Princeton University]], which had been endowed with a $750,000 grant from the Republic of Turkey. The incident has been the subject of numerous reports as to ethics in scholarship.&lt;ref name=Smith1995 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/02/opinion/l-armenian-genocide-cannot-be-denied-092266.html?n=Top%2FReference%2FTimes+Topics%2FPeople%2FL%2FLifton%2C+Robert+Jay "Armenian Genocide Cannot Be Denied"], ''New York Times'', 2 June 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Another source notes: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;In order to institutionalize this campaign of denial and try to invest it with an aura of legitimacy, a "think-tank" was established in Ankara in April 2001. Operating under the name "[[Institute for Armenian Research]]" as a subsidiary of The Center For Eurasian Studies, with a staff of nine, this new outfit is now proactively engaged in contesting all claims of genocide by organizing a series of conferences, lectures, and interviews, and above all, through the medium of publications, including a quarterly.&lt;ref&gt;America and the Armenian Genocide of 1915, by J. M. Winter, Paul Kennedy, Antoine Prost, Emmanuel Sivan, preface by V. Dadrian, 2003, Cambridge University Press, 332 p., {{ISBN|0-521-82958-5}}, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Open University of Israel]] scholar [[Yair Auron]] has addressed the various means employed by the Turkish government to obscure the reality of the Armenian Genocide:&lt;ref&gt;The Banality of Denial, by [[Yair Auron]], Rutgers University Press, New Brunswick, 2003, {{ISBN|0-7658-0834-X}}, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Since the 1980s, the Turkish government has supported the establishment of "institutes" affiliated with respected universities, whose apparent purpose is to further research on Turkish history and culture, but which also tend to act in ways that further denial.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[University of California, Los Angeles]] scholar [[Leo Kuper]] in a review on Ervin Staub's "The Roots of Evil: The Origins of Genocide and Other Group Violence" research, wrote:&lt;ref&gt;"Review (The Roots of Evil: The Origins of Genocide and Other Group Violence. by Ervin Staub)", Leo Kuper // Contemporary Sociology, Vol. 19, No. 5. (September 1990), p. 683&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Armenian genocide is a contemporary current issue, given the persistent aggressive denial of the crime by the Turkish government-not withstanding its own judgment in courts martial after the first World War, that its leading ministers had deliberately planned and carried out the annihilation of Armenians, with the participation of many regional administrators.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The government of Turkey has channeled funds into a supposedly objective research institute in the United States, which in turn paid the salary of a historian who served that government in its campaign to discredit scholarship on the Armenian genocide.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Given the indisputable documentary record of the Armenian genocide, it would appear that at least some of those who refuse to go on record recognizing Turkey's genocide of Armenians are, like those who refuse to recognize Germany's genocide of European Jews, motivated by ignorance and bigotry", claims American scholar [[Stephen Zunes]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fpif.org/fpiftxt/4660 U.S. Denial of the Armenian Genocide, by Stephen Zunes, FPIF, October 22, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 9 June 2000, in a full-page statement in [[The New York Times]], 126 scholars, including [[Nobel Prize]]-winner [[Elie Wiesel]], historian [[Yehuda Bauer]], and sociologist [[Irving Horowitz]], signed a document "affirming that the [[World War I]] Armenian genocide is an incontestable historical fact and accordingly urge the governments of Western democracies to likewise recognize it as such."&lt;ref name="clevelandjewishnews.com"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wiesel himself has repeatedly called Turkey's 90-year-old campaign to cover up the Armenian genocide a double killing, since it strives to kill the memory of the original atrocities.&lt;ref name="splcenter.org" /&gt;

In an open letter by the "Danish Department for Holocaust and Genocide Studies and the denial and relativization of the Armenian genocide", historians [[Torben Jørgensen (historian)|Torben Jorgensen]] and [[Matthias Bjornlund]] wrote:&lt;ref&gt;[http://cgi.stanford.edu/group/wais/cgi-bin/index.php?p=2313 Genocide Denial in the state of Denmark]. Open letter by Torben Jorgensen and Matthias Bjornlund, World Association of International Studies, Stanford University, California.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;When it comes to the historical reality of the Armenian genocide, there is no "Armenian" or "Turkish" side of the "question, " any more than there is a "Jewish" or a "German" side of the historical reality of the Holocaust: There is a scientific side, and an unscientific side acknowledgment or denial. In the case of the denial of the Armenian genocide, it is even founded on a massive effort of falsification, distortion, cleansing of archives, and direct threats initiated or supported by the Turkish state, making any "dialogue" with Turkish deniers highly problematic.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Philip L. Kohl]] and Clare Fawcett write that the "Armenian cultural remains in neighboring Turkey are frequently dismissed or referred to as "Ottoman period" monuments", and that the continued denial of the state-sponsored genocide is "related to these practices".&lt;ref&gt;Nationalism, Politics, and the Practice of Archaeology. Edited by Philip L. Kohl and Clare Fawcett. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 341 p., {{ISBN|0-521-48065-5}}, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Taner Akçam]], Turkey "tried to erase the traces of a recent past that had become undesirable" through a series of reforms, so the collective memory "was replaced by an official history written by a few authorised academics, which became the sole recognised reference. Events prior to 1928 and the writings of past generations became a closed book."&lt;ref&gt;Akcam, Taner (2000-09-17). [http://www.flash-bulletin.de/2000/eSeptember17.htm#3 The long denied Armenian Genocide: Turkey's carefully forgotten history], ''Le Monde Diplomatique'' ([http://mondediplo.com/2001/09/11armenian original, for subscribers]).&lt;/ref&gt;

In a lecture he delivered in June 2011, Akçam stated that he was told by a Turkish foreign ministry official that the Turkish government was trying to bribe historians and academics in the United States to deny the Armenian Genocide.&lt;ref name="Asbarez"&gt;Sassounian, Harut. "[http://asbarez.com/96992/prof-akcam-reveals-turkish-plan-to-pay-scholars-to-deny-the-armenian-genocide/ Prof. Akcam Reveals Turkish Plan to Pay Scholars to Deny the Armenian Genocide]." ''[[Asbarez]]''. 12 July 2011. Retrieved 27 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Though he did not make any direct accusations, he noted the timing between what his source said with the recent publication of American historian [[Michael M. Gunter]]'s book ''Armenian History and the Question of Genocide''. He also raised the point that the four individuals who praised Gunter's book – Hakan Yavuz of University of Utah, Guenter Lewy of University of Massachusetts, Jeremy Salt of Bilkent University, Ankara, and Edward J. Ericson of Marine Corps Command &amp; Staff College, Virginia – "are well known for their denialist position and works regarding the genocide of 1915."&lt;ref name="Asbarez" /&gt;

==Legislation==
Some countries, including Cyprus&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; have adopted laws that punish [[genocide denial]]. In October 2006, the [[French National Assembly]], despite opposition from [[Foreign minister of France|foreign minister]] [[Philippe Douste-Blazy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Proceedings of the [[French National Assembly]], [http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/12/cri/2005-2006/20060225.asp 18 May 2006, first sitting]&lt;/ref&gt; passed a bill which if approved by the [[Senate of France|Senate]] would make Armenian Genocide denial a crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/12/dossiers/reconnaissance_genocide_armenien_1915_loi_2001.asp Legislative file] from the [[French National Assembly]]&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 October 2011 French President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] said that Turkey's refusal to recognize the genocide would force France to make such denials a criminal offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

===Legal issues in denial cases===
The first person convicted in a court of law for denying the Armenian genocide is Turkish politician [[Doğu Perinçek]], found guilty of [[racial discrimination]] by a Swiss district court in [[Lausanne]] in March 2007. At the trial, Perinçek denied the charge thus: "I have not denied genocide because there was no genocide.".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Ferai Tinç, a foreign affairs columnist with Turkey's ''[[Hürriyet]]'' newspaper, commented, "we find these type of [penal] articles against freedom of opinion dangerous because we are struggling in our country to achieve freedom of thought."&lt;ref name="Swiss"&gt;{{Cite news

In November 1993 American historian [[Bernard Lewis]] said in an interview that calling the massacres committed by the Turks in 1915 a genocide was just "the Armenian version of this history".&lt;ref name=lemonde95&gt;"... que la qualification de génocide, attribuée aux massacres perpétrés par les Turcs en 1915, n'était que 'la version arménienne de cette histoire.'"

===Time DVD incident===
In 6 June 2005 edition of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time Europe]]'', the Ankara [[Chamber of Commerce]] included—along with a [[tourism in Turkey]] advertisement—a DVD containing a 70-minute presentation denying the Armenian Genocide.

===Let History Decide Campaign===

The Turkish government, in advance of the [[100th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide|anniversary of 100 years from the genocide]] at 2015, has reverted to the position that the matter should be subject to further study by historians, sponsoring the website www.lethistorydecide.org.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= A Century After Armenian Genocide, Turkey’s Denial Only Deepens|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/17/world/europe/turkeys-century-of-denial-about-an-armenian-genocide.html |accessdate=16 April 2015|newspaper=nytimes|date=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website was part of the wider "Let History Decide" campaign which has been organized by the Turkish American Steering Committee in the USA. The committee also launched the Twitter hashtag #lethistorydecide. The campaign had a strong social media presence, including Twitter (@historydecide), Instagram and Facebook. The main slogan of the campaign was: "Unite us, not divide us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= A Century After Armenian Genocide, Turkey’s Denial Only Deepens |url=http://aa.com.tr/en/turkey/american-turks-launch-new-campaign-over-1915-events/60499?amp=1|accessdate=5 April 2015|newspaper=Anadolu Ajensi|date=5 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:{{see also|Art valuation|Art auction}}
The art market is represented by a marketplace of buyers and sellers trading in the commodities, services, and works-of-art commonly associated with the various arts. The art market is also concerned with the production of new art which enters the art market. The art market is an example of one type of marketplace, among many different types of markets which occur in economics. In particular, the art market has many similarities with other marketplaces where buyers and sellers meet, as well as significant distinguishing factors indicative of its differences from other types of markets in economics.

==The art market economic model==
The [[Economics of the arts and literature#The market for artworks|art market]] operates in an economic model that considers more than [[supply and demand]]: it is a hybrid type of [[prediction market]] where art is bought and sold for values based not only on a work's perceived cultural value, but on both its past monetary value as well as its predicted future value. The market has been described as one where producers don't make work primarily for sale, where buyers often have no idea of the value of what they buy, and where middlemen routinely claim reimbursement for sales of things they have never seen to buyers they have never dealt with.&lt;ref name="platter"&gt;Plattner, Stuart, [http://www.stuartplattner.com/AA-ART-Paradox.pdf A Most Ingenious Paradox: The Market for Contemporary Fine Art], ''[[American Anthropologist]]'' 100(2):482-493, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the market is not transparent; private sales data is not systematically available&lt;ref name="Coslor"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coslor|first=Erica|date=April 2016|title=Transparency in an opaque market: Evaluative frictions between "thick" valuation and "thin" price data in the art market|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361368216300307|journal=Accounting, Organizations and Society|volume=50|pages=13–26|doi=10.1016/j.aos.2016.03.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and private sales represent about half of market transactions.

===Market size===
Unlike the volumes in the [[securities market]] where millions of people and firms participate in buying and selling financial interests, or the [[Commodity market|commodities market]] where measures of raw or primary products are exchanged using standardized contracts, art market activity largely follows the demands of a more limited array of private collectors, museums, and large corporate interests as the principal market participants.&lt;ref name="microcosm"&gt;The art market sees itself as a microcosm: it lists its collectors in the hundreds, as opposed to the securities market which has millions of participants. ''ARTnews'': [http://artnews.com/issues/article.asp?art_id=2536 The Top Ten] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016003020/http://artnews.com/issues/article.asp?art_id=2536 |date=16 October 2009 }}, [http://artnews.com/issues/article.asp?art_id=2520 The ARTnews 200 Top Collectors] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016003056/http://artnews.com/issues/article.asp?art_id=2520 |date=16 October 2009 }}. One art writer, however, answered the question: "Do you see the art world as a microcosm of other broader, power communities?" with the following observation: "I'm not sure if it's a microcosm or the shape of things to come. Its manic internationalism...." [http://www.vmagazine.com/2008/11/111208-insider-art/ Insider Art]{{dead link|date=August 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, ''V Magazine'', 2008-11-12, vmagazine.com.  Accessed 20 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Corporate collectors, however, can have a disparately large market impact, for instance, ''[[Spear's Wealth Management Survey|Spear's]]'' reported in 2015 that [[British Rail]] began investing in art for its pension fund beginning in 1974 (prior to privatization), spending about £40M or approximately 3% of its funds on art, before selling those assets between 1987&amp;ndash;1999.&lt;ref name="britrailspears"&gt;Lindsay, Ivan, [http://www.spearswms.com/news/go-figure/#.U4W0eSj8iZQ Go Figure], ''Spear's'', spearswms.com, 21 January 2011; free [https://web.archive.org/web/20140529052940/http://www.spearswms.com/news/go-figure/ archived version]. Accessed 17 November 2015. The article also mentions that British Rail Pension realized an annualized return of 11.3% because of a number of factors particular to the market at the time.&lt;/ref&gt; British Rail's efforts realized profits, particularly due to the Impressionist portfolio, but the collection was liquidated because it came to be seen as an illegitimate investment area, particularly as alternative investments became available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coslor|first=Erica|last2=Spaenjers|first2=Christophe|date=November 2016|title=Organizational and epistemic change: The growth of the art investment field|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361368216300782|journal=Accounting, Organizations and Society|volume=55|pages=48–62|doi=10.1016/j.aos.2016.09.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, because original artworks are not [[Fungibility|fungible]] like [[stock]]s, they have valuation challenges not similarly affecting securities,&lt;ref name="baumol"&gt;Baumol, William J., [http://pchen.ccer.edu.cn/homepage/RecommendPapers/BaumolArts86.pdf Unnatural Value: Or Art Investment as Floating Crap Game] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425235014/http://pchen.ccer.edu.cn/homepage/RecommendPapers/BaumolArts86.pdf |date=25 April 2012 }}, ''The American Economic Review'', 76:2 (May 1986), pp. 10-14, Papers and Proceedings of the Ninety-Eighth Annual Meeting of the American Economic Association,; ''Journal of Arts Management and Law'' (now ''The Journal of Arts Management, Law, and Society''), 15:3, 1985, pp. 47-60. {{DOI|10.1080/07335113.1985.9942162}}.&lt;/ref&gt; with dynamics of what Karpik calls singularities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9215.html|title=Valuing the Unique|website=Princeton University Press|access-date=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, because the art market's participants are far more limited in number than the securities or commodities markets, because artworks are not fungible, and because art valuation relies to a great extent on the advice and enthusiasm of a variety of specialized market analysts, these limitations each in turn dictate the size of the market and increase the risk that some items may be over or undervalued.

===Market timing===
The art market moves in cycles with activity generally peaking in the spring and autumn when the major auction houses traditionally schedule auctions, and results in the market being seasonal rather than ongoing.&lt;ref name="sched"&gt;[http://www.artmarket.com/ Art Market Cycles], artmarket.com, retrieved 20 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  While private sales take place all year, those sales are often not publicized as auctions are and thus do not affect the market until they become known.

Art valuations made for an autumn auction may be unrealistic for the following spring auction season because fortunes in the financial markets during one season can affect the art market in the following season, and equity markets do significantly impact the art market.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goetzmann|first=William N|last2=Renneboog|first2=Luc|last3=Spaenjers|first3=Christophe|date=May 2011|title=Art and Money|url=http://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/aer.101.3.222|journal=American Economic Review|language=en|volume=101|issue=3|pages=222–226|doi=10.1257/aer.101.3.222|issn=0002-8282}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volatility in the financial markets often causes volatility in the art market as happened in the contraction of the art market during the [[2008–2012 global recession|2008-2009 recession]]&lt;ref&gt;For more on the economic background causing the market contraction, see also the [[2008–2009 Keynesian resurgence]].&lt;/ref&gt; when sales at [[Sotheby's]], [[Christie's]], and [[Phillips de Pury &amp;amp; Company]] were less than half the previous year: November 2008, $803.3 million compared to November 2007, $1.75 billion; and between 2000 and 2003 when the annual volume of art works sold at auction dropped 36%.&lt;ref name="sched" /&gt;&lt;ref name="contraction"&gt;Esterow, [http://artnews.com/issues/article.asp?art_id=2642 How to Buy in 2009] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015210756/http://artnews.com/issues/article.asp?art_id=2642 |date=15 October 2009 }}, ''ARTnews'', March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In other instances, the art market can fare reasonably well despite volatility in the stock market such as happened from January 1997 through May 2004 when the average quarterly fluctuation in the Artprice Global Index was two to three times smaller than the same statistic for the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] and the [[S&amp;P 500]].&lt;ref name="sched" /&gt;

As art market participants' fortunes wax and wane in the financial markets, buying power evolves and affects participants' ability to afford highly valued works, resulting in new buyers and sellers entering, leaving, or re-entering the market, and an artwork sold to offset losses in the financial market might be sold for substantially more or substantially less than its last {{H:title|price for which work sold at auctioneer's hammer strike|hammer value|link=no}} at auction.&lt;ref name="gerber"&gt;Gerber, Manuel, [http://www.gerberstauffer.com/GerberAFT1108.pdf Primary Art Market Investments - A Safe Haven when All Else Suddenly Correlates?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002174957/http://www.gerberstauffer.com/GerberAFT1108.pdf# |date=2013-10-02 }}, Prime Art Management Ltd., published in ''Art Fund Tracker'', Nov. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1980s during the stock-market boom, the art market expanded in turn with prices soaring to new heights, and investment firms took a greater interest in the art market and began to study it in-depth.&lt;ref name="campbell"&gt;Campbell, [http://i1.exhibit-e.com/collectionofmodernart/39049d22.pdf The Art of Portfolio Diversification]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Maastricht University, March 2004.

Art sometimes has transient fashionability that also can affect its value: what sells well for a time may be supplanted in the market by new styles and ideas in short order. For instance, in the spring of 2008 a collector offered over $80 million for Jeff Koons' stainless-steel ''Rabbit'', and yet a year later, of four works in the fall auctions at Christie's and Sotheby's in New York, only two of his pieces sold well and one failed to sell entirely.&lt;ref name="inflatable"&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/14941205 Inflatable investments, The volatile art of Jeff Koons], ''[[The Economist]]'', 28 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Christie's sold Koons' ''Balloon Flower'' sculpture for $16.9 million.&lt;ref name="koonsballoon"&gt;Christie's, [http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/jeff-koons-balloon-flower/5371708/lot/lot_details.aspx?from=searchresults&amp;intObjectID=5371708&amp;sid=e5ce29ac-d2b6-41b6-9092-7aacf3e6974b Auction result, Sale 2355 / Lot 23], christies.com, retrieved 21 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Primary and secondary markets===
The art market as a whole is affected by its two main parts: the primary art market, where new art comes to the market for the first time, and the secondary market, for existing art that has been sold at least once before. Once a work is sold on the primary market it enters the secondary market, and the prices for which it sold in the primary market have a direct bearing on the work's value in the secondary market. Supply and demand affect the secondary market more than the primary market because works new to the market, mainly contemporary art, have no market history for predictive analysis and thus valuation of such work is more difficult, and more speculative.&lt;ref name="gerald"&gt;Gerard and Louis, [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6V64-3YRSMF4-28/2/44fafa98be1c97504c5a1fdc722b55ba On pricing the priceless: Comments on the economics of the visual art market], ''European Economic Review'', Elsevier, vol. 39(3-4), April 1995, pp. 509-518. (membership required).&lt;/ref&gt; Gallery, dealer, consultant, and agent promotion as well as collectors acting as [[alpha consumer]]s (trend-setters) are the forces at work in valuing primary market works.

===Market entry barriers===
As with [[Blue chip (stock market)|blue-chip]] stocks, works by "blue-chip" or well-known artists are generally valued more highly than works by unknown artists since it is hard to predict how an unknown artist's work will sell, or whether it will sell at all. [[barriers to entry|High barriers to market entry]] for artists&lt;ref name="jeffri"&gt;Jeffri, Joan, Philanthropy and the American artist: A historical overview, ''[[International Journal of Cultural Policy|The European Journal of Cultural Policy]]'', 3(2), 2009, pp. 207-233.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="barriers"&gt;Jackson, M.R., et al, [http://www.urban.org/UploadedPDF/411311_investing_in_creativity.pdf Investing in Creativity: A study of the support structure for US artists], ''The Journal of Arts Management, Law, and Society'', 2004. PDF from Urban Institute, urban.org.&lt;/ref&gt; create scarcity in the supply and demand portion of the market, in turn driving up prices and raising questions of [[Financial market efficiency|efficiency]].&lt;ref name="bonus"&gt;Bonus, H., Ronte, D., Credibility and economic value in the visual arts, ''Journal of Cultural Economics'' 21, 1997 103–118.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="adler"&gt;Adler, M., [http://www.columbia.edu/~ma820/Stardom%20and%20Talent.pdf ''Stardom and Talent''], in Handbook of the Economics of Art and Culture, Vol. 1, Chap. 25, 2006, pp. 895-906.&lt;/ref&gt; While a high market entry barrier may result in having a smaller pool of artwork producers in the auction-level portion of the market, and in greater market predictability by virtue of that smaller pool and thus more reliable valuation measures, its axiomatic effect is of lesser artistic diversity negatively impacting the size of the buyer pool.&lt;ref name="schonfeld"&gt;Schönfeld and Reinstaller, [http://www.wu-wien.ac.at/inst/vw1/papers/wu-wp90.pdf ''The effects of gallery and artist reputation on prices in the primary market for art'']{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Working Paper, Department of Economics, Vienna University of Economics &amp; B.A., May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, gallerists and art dealers consider what types of works are currently in vogue before deciding to represent a new artist and are highly selective in those choices in order to maintain a level of quality that is saleable. All these concerns are in play when gallerists set prices for emerging artists at a much lower level than for established artists.

===Market transparency===
With the [[2007–2012 global financial crisis]], the art market faced criticism for its lack of transparency, its [[Byzantinism|Byzantine]] valuation methods, and a perceived lack of ethical behavior enabled by structural inadequacies in the market itself. In response, a 2009 debate occurred between valuation-setting members of the art market on the proposition that "the art market is less ethical than the stock market". At the end of the debate the audience determined that those debating in agreement with the proposition won the debate.&lt;ref name="morality"&gt;Saltz, Jerry, [http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/features/saltz/saltz3-6-09.asp Morality Play], artnet.com, 2009-03-06, discussing the debate and its outcome. Participants included art dealers Richard Feigen and Michael Hue-Williams, collector Adam Lindemann on the "pro" side, and artist [[Chuck Close]], critic Jerry Saltz, and auctioneer Amy Cappellazzo opposing. The [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpsTNdYeG6U debate video] is available on [[YouTube]].&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular note in the debate was the identification of "chandelier bidding" as a practice perceived as ethically questionable. The debaters described "chandelier bidding" as bids from the chandelier, or bids from an unknown source, meaning both the bidding by the auction houses on behalf of the sellers whose items the houses are auctioning (a [[conflict of interest]]), and bidding by unidentified bidders having no intention of buying but bidding in order to drive prices up, all practiced because the auction houses keep secret from bidders a seller's [[Reservation price|reserve price]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/28/arts/design/as-art-market-rise-so-do-questions-of-oversight.html|title=As Art Market Soars, So Do Questions of Oversight|last=Pogrebin|first=Robin|date=27 January 2013|work=The New York Times|access-date=9 June 2017|last2=Flynn|first2=Kevin|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, also in response to criticism on the lack of market transparency and counterarguments that more transparency would ruin the market,&lt;ref name="adaa"&gt;Art Dealers Association of America (ADAA), [http://www.artdealers.org/events.forum30.html Art Industry Summit] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111216122400/http://www.artdealers.org/events.forum30.html |date=16 December 2011 }}, Transparency in the market: can we have more of it?, 3 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Art Newspaper]]'' in association with the Art Dealers Association of America convened an Art Industry Summit panel discussion between major art market decision makers, where panelists discussed whether there was a need for more transparency.&lt;ref name="transpADAA"&gt;ADAA and The Art Newspaper, Transparency in the market...can we have more of it?, videos [http://www.theartnewspaper.tv/content.php?vid=1662 Part 1] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304193922/http://www.theartnewspaper.tv/content.php?vid=1662# |date=2016-03-04 }}, [http://www.theartnewspaper.tv/content.php?vid=1661 Part 2] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305172450/http://theartnewspaper.tv/content.php?vid=1661# |date=2016-03-05 }}, and [http://www.theartnewspaper.tv/content.php?vid=1660 Part 3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304110955/http://www.theartnewspaper.tv/content.php?vid=1660# |date=2016-03-04 }}, Host Anna Somers Cocks, ''The Art Newpapaper'', 11 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The panelists argued over whether auction houses have built-in conflicts of interest by representing sellers with secret reserves, while at the same time representing to buyers initial valuations on those works at auction time. The debate also included the issue of first and third-party guaranteed bids, and whether sellers' reserve prices should be disclosed so that participants no longer bid on an object they have no chance of buying. In response to criticisms regarding chandelier bidding and unidentified third-party guaranteed bids, Christie's International chairman Edward Dolman countered that, without a secret reserve, illegal cartels of bidders would know in advance information that could facilitate their manipulation of the market and corruption of final valuation by selling price at auction.&lt;ref name="transpADAA2"&gt;ADAA, video 3 at 22:05 min, et seq..&lt;/ref&gt;

With the art market's weaknesses (especially lack of transparency and conflicts of interests) becoming better known, serious external conversations about market regulation have begun among major market players; for example, the ''[[Financial Times]]'' noted that in early 2015, participants at the January [[World Economic Forum]] meeting attended a lunch seminar where the speaker warned that the global art market needs to be regulated because of systemic weaknesses which enable inside information trading, tax evasion, and money laundering.&lt;ref name="gapper"&gt;Gapper, John, [https://web.archive.org/web/20150125081849/http://blogs.ft.com/the-world/2015/01/art-worlds-shady-dealings-under-scrutiny-at-davos Art world’s shady dealings under scrutiny at Davos], ''[[Financial Times]]'', 22 January 2015. Accessed 17 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of academic research, there is work on the opacity of price formation in finance and economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=David|first=Géraldine|last2=Oosterlinck|first2=Kim|last3=Szafarz|first3=Ariane|title=Art market inefficiency|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2013.06.033|journal=Economics Letters|volume=121|issue=1|pages=23–25|doi=10.1016/j.econlet.2013.06.033}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Competitors ===
Christie's and Sotheby's are the leading auction venues. In 2002, [[LVMH]] acquired Swiss art advisory firm de Pury &amp; Luxembourg and merged it with Phillips to form [[Phillips de Pury &amp; Company]], with the aim of breaking the duopoly at the top of the market.

=== Segments ===
Fine art auctions are generally held separately for Impressionist and Modern art as well as for Post-war and Contemporary Art. [[Pablo Picasso]]'s works remain the most coveted lot as of 2004. In 2008 just over  million of art by [[Damien Hirst]] was sold at auction, a world record for a living artist; however in 2009, Hirst’s annual auction sales had shrunk by 93%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Estimates ===
"Estimates" often reflect the [[consignor]]'s ambitions as much as the auction specialist's considered opinion. They do not reflect commissions. To secure consignments, auction houses concede high estimates to suit the requirements of art owners.&lt;ref&gt;Souren Melikian, [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/08/arts/08iht-melikian08.html When Auction Estimates Go Haywire], ''[[The New York Times]]'', nytimes.com, October 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Before an auction, interested buyers typically turn for advice to the auction house specialist who quotes the estimate and often recommends going beyond in order to secure the item.&lt;ref&gt;Souren Melikian, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/18/arts/18iht-melik19.1.9319140.html Behind stellar sales of art market, a dangerous game], ''The New York Times'', nytimes.com, January 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Commissions and Buyer's Premium ===
Auction houses operate contractually on behalf of sellers of goods, charging sellers a fixed [[commission (remuneration)|commission]] (fee) amounting to a percentage of the “hammer price” for which a lot is sold.&lt;ref name="horror"&gt;{{cite journal
 | title = Hammer houses of horror
 | magazine = [[The Economist]]
 | date = July 24, 1997
 | url = http://www.economist.com/node/152446
 | accessdate = 2012-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christie's published its commissions in September 1995, with its fees ranging from 20% on the least expensive lots to 2% on lots sold for over m; Sotheby's followed suit.&lt;ref name="horror" /&gt; For Phillips de Pury &amp; Company, final prices include commission of 25% of the first  20% of the next  to  million, and 12% of the rest, with estimates not reflecting commissions.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Vogel, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/14/arts/design/14auction.html Phillips Sale Totals Less Than Half the Low Estimate] ''The New York Times'', nytimes.com, November 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
Objects sold are also subject to a further fee called the "[[buyer's premium]]", 15% being typical, with the term implying that by virtue of selling an object, the auction house performs a service for the buyer subject to remuneration. Thus, both the seller and the buyer of an object or lot sold by the major auction houses pay a fee. First implemented in 1975 by Christie's, the assessment of a buyer's premium is one of several auction-house practices to which art dealers object.&lt;ref&gt;Orley Ashenfelter &amp; Kathryn Graddy, Anatomy of the Rise and Fall of a Pricefixing Conspiracy: Auctions At Sotheby’s And Christie’s, ''Journal of Competition Law and Economics'', 1(1), 3–20, March 2005, {{doi|10.1093/joclec/nhi003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Performance-based fees ===
Beginning in 2014, Christie's charged 2 percent of the hammer price of a work that meets or exceeds its high estimate. The fee does not apply to online only sales.&lt;ref&gt;Melanie Gerlis (September 26, 2014), [http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/Christies-takes-another-/35708 Christie's takes another 2%] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140928075542/http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Christies-takes-another-/35708 |date=2014-09-28 }} ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Guarantees ===
An auction house may offer a guaranteed selling price, or "guaranteed minimum", a practice designed to give sellers confidence to consign works and to give potential bidders reassurance that there are others willing to buy an item.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sarah Thornton]], [https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2011/11/art-market Financial machinations at auctions], ''The Economist'', economist.com, November 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Auction houses have offered guarantees since the early 1970s to encourage collectors to sell their artworks: ''The Art Newspaper'' reported that guarantees were first introduced in 1971 at Sotheby’s, when 47 [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]]s and other works from the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] were offered with a guaranteed minimum; similar arrangements followed in 1972 and 1973 for the Ritter and Scull collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In autumn 2008 when the market turned sour, Christie's and Sotheby's had to pay out at least  million on works for which they guaranteed a minimum price but which failed to sell. In order to reduce their exposure to such losses, boost the market, and reduce volatility, the main auction houses now prefer that third parties take on this financial risk via "third-party guarantees" or "irrevocable bids": using this practice the auction houses sell a work to a third party for a minimum price prior to the auction and this selling price then becomes the “reserve” below which the artwork will not be sold. If bidding for specified works stops at the minimum price, which remains undisclosed, the "third party" acquires the lot; if bidding exceeds the reserve, the third party splits any profit from its sale with the consignor and with the auction house, the percentage going to each party varying with the deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

=== Online sales ===
[[File:Teo Spiller net.art.trade (net.art).jpg|thumb|A Screenshot of Teo Spiller's net.art net.art.trade]]
In May 1999, [[Teo Spiller]] sold a web art project Megatronix to Ljubljana Municipal Museum, which was by the New York Times announced as the first sell of an [[Internet art]] [[net.art]].&lt;ref&gt;Mirapaul, M [http://partners.nytimes.com/library/tech/99/05/cyber/artsatlarge/13artsatlarge.html "There May Be Money in Internet Art After All"], ''The New York Times, 1999-05-13''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Sotheby's abandoned its partnership with [[eBay]] after it lost millions through its various attempts to sell fine art over the internet.&lt;ref name="duopoly"&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/1612774 Just the two of us - The duopoly in fine-art auctions is weakened but very much alive] ''The Economist'', economist.com, February 27, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;


==What Counts==
The [[art sale|art market]] can also be used to understand what “counts” as part of art history. [[Art dealers]] and auctioneers organize material for distribution to collectors. Two of the largest, and oldest, art auction houses are [[Sotheby's]] and [[Christie's]], and each hold frequent sales of great [[antiquities]] and [[Art Object|art objects]].

==Black Market==
In addition to upstanding practices, a [[black market]] exists for great art, which is closely tied to [[art theft]] and [[art forgery]]. No auction houses or dealers admit openly to participating in the black market because of its illegality, but exposés suggest widespread problems in the field. Because demand for art objects is high, and security in many parts of the world is low, a thriving trade in [[illicit antiquities]] acquired through [[looting]] also exists. Although the art community nearly universally condemns looting because it results in destruction of [[Archaeological site|archeological sites]], [[looted art]] paradoxically remains omnipresent. Warfare is correlated with such looting, as is demonstrated by the recent [[archaeological looting in Iraq]].

All APH members are expected to abide by the organization's [[code of ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.personalhistorians.org/about/code_ethics.php |website= APH|title=Code of ethics| accessdate= April 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Practitioners often have training in skills such as [[interviewing]] techniques, [[desktop publishing]], video and/or audio production, as well as some knowledge of [[geriatrics]] or other disciplines.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

==Governance==
The APH was governed by an elected, all-volunteer board of directors with overlapping two-year terms. The organization held an annual conference for its members: the 2016 conference was held in Fort Worth, Texas. The 2017 Board of Directors cited decreasing membership and a growing trend towards online networking and collaboration as reasons for dissolution. In a letter to members, the 2017 Board wrote, &lt;blockquote&gt;"...APH has achieved its purpose many times over, which, as stated in our Bylaws, was to 'advance the profession of helping individuals, organizations, and communities preserve their histories, memories, and life stories.' APH has helped launch more than a thousand personal history businesses, and its members have produced many thousands of personal history works that will be part of our world’s historical record. APH leaves the field at a time when a broader recognition of the importance of saving life stories has emerged and is flourishing—and is widely known and communicated through the work of many other organizations and media outlets. APH has had a significant role in advancing that conversation. And it was our members, as individual practitioners of personal history, who achieved this in countless ways in countless communities, and we know you will continue to do so."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.personalhistorians.org|title=Letter to Membership: Dissolution of APH, Inc.|last=APH Board of Directors|first=2017|date=May 9, 2017|work=Constant Contact alluded to under Announcements on this page.|access-date=May 10, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=May 2017}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Resources==
Former members of APH and current personal historians are encouraged to use the phrase "personal history" and "personal historian" in search engines in order to find relevant social media groups.

'''Mary Katherine Horony-Cummings''' (born as '''Mária Izabella Magdolna Horony''', November 9, 1849 – November 2, 1940), also known as '''Big Nose Kate''', was a [[Hungarians|Hungarian]]-born [[prostitution|prostitute]] and longtime companion and common-law wife of [[American frontier|Old West]] gunfighter [[Doc Holliday]].

=== Immigration to the United States of America ===
[[File:BigNoseKateat17.jpg|thumb|Kate Horony (left) and younger sister Wilhelmina in about 1865, at the time they were orphaned. Kate is about 15 years old.]]

In 1860, Dr. Horony, his second wife Katharina, and his children left Hungary for the United States, arriving in [[New York City]] on the German ship [[SS Bremen (1858)|''Bremen'']] in September 1860. Writer [[Glenn Boyer]] was the first to state that Kate was descended from nobility and that after her father was appointed personal physician to Emperor [[Maximilian I of Mexico]] the family accompanied the monarch's retinue to Mexico. However, in none of his published works did Boyer ever cite a source for these assertions. Patrick A. Bowmaster exposed the fallacy of Boyer's story."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Patrick A. |last1=Bowmaster |title=A Fresh Look at Big Nose Kate |journal=Quarterly of the National Association for Outlaws and Lawmen History |date=July–September 1998 |pages=12–24 |url=http://www.tombstonehistoryarchives.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/freshlook_kate.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212223544/http://www.tombstonehistoryarchives.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/freshlook_kate.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Horony family settled in a predominantly German area of [[Davenport, Iowa|Davenport]], [[Iowa]] in 1862. Horony and his wife died only three years later, in 1865, within a month of one another. Mary Katherine and her younger siblings were placed in the home of her brother-in-law, Gustav Susemihl, and in 1870 they were left in the care of attorney Otto Smith.&lt;ref name="bork1935"&gt;1935 Bork interview, Arizona Historical Society, Boyer Collection, Tucson, AZ&lt;/ref&gt; The 1870 [[United States Census]] records for Davenport, Iowa show Kate's younger sister, 15-year-old Wilhelmina (Wilma), living with and working as a domestic for Austrian-born David Palter and his Hungarian wife Bettina.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

=== St. Louis and Dodge City ===
At age 16, Kate ran away from her foster home and stowed away on a riverboat bound for [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]].&lt;ref&gt;Horony Family Group Record; Beckwith to Boyer, January 22, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; Kate later claimed that while she lived in St. Louis she married a dentist named "Silas Melvin" with whom she had a son, and that both died of [[yellow fever]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} No record has been found to substantiate marriage, birth of a child, or the death of either Melvin or the child.{{original research inline|date=April 2013}} [[United States Census]] records report that a Silas Melvin lived in St. Louis in the mid 1860s but that he was married to a steamship captain's daughter named Mary Bust. The census also shows that another Melvin was employed by a St. Louis asylum. Since Kate met [[Doc Holliday]] in the early 1870s, she may have confused the two and their occupations when recalling the facts later in her life.&lt;ref name="boyer"&gt;Glenn Boyer, ''Who Is Big Nose Kate?''&lt;/ref&gt;

Researcher Jan Collins states that Kate entered the Ursuline Convent but did not remain long. In 1869, she is recorded as working as a prostitute for madam Blanch Tribole in St. Louis.&lt;ref name=collins/&gt; In 1874, Kate was fined for working as a "sporting woman" (prostitute) in a "[[sporting house]]" (brothel) in [[Dodge City, Kansas|Dodge City]], [[Kansas]], run by Nellie "Bessie" (Ketchum) Earp,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thrapp|first=Dan L.|title=The Encyclopedia of Frontier Biography Volume 1: A-F|year=1991|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln, Nebraska|isbn=978-0803294189|page=445|edition=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Earp]]'s wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Big Nose Kate - Doc Holliday's Sidekick|url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/we-bignosekate.html|publisher=Old West Legends|accessdate=18 April 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130417090939/http://www.legendsofamerica.com/we-bignosekate.html|archivedate=17 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lackmann|first=Ron|title=Women of the Western Frontier in Fact, Fiction, and Film|year=1997|publisher=McFarland|location=Jefferson, N.C.|isbn=978-0786404001|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pryor|first=Alton|title=The Lawmen|year=2006|publisher=Stagecoach Pub.|location=Roseville, CA|isbn=978-0974755168|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Joins Doc Holliday ==
[[File:T-Long Nose Kates Saloon.jpg|thumb|Big Nose Kate's Saloon in Tombstone. It was originally called the "Grand Hotel" and was built in 1880. Ike Clanton and two McLaury brothers stayed there the night before the gunfight at the O.K. Corral.]]

In 1876, Kate moved to [[Fort Griffin, Texas]], where in 1877 she met [[Doc Holliday]]. Doc said at one point that he considered Kate his intellectual equal.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Kate introduced Holliday to [[Wyatt Earp]].&lt;ref name=collins/&gt;  The couple went with Earp to Dodge City and registered as Mr. and Mrs. J.H. Holliday at Deacon Cox's boarding house. Doc opened a dental practice by day but spent most of his time gambling and drinking. The two fought regularly and sometimes violently.

According to Kate, the couple later married in [[Valdosta, Georgia]]. They traveled to [[Trinidad, Colorado]], and then to [[Las Vegas, New Mexico]], where they lived for about two years. Holliday worked as a dentist by day and ran a saloon on Center Street by night. Kate also occasionally worked at a dance hall in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]].&lt;ref name=collins/&gt;

By her own account, Doc and Kate met up again with [[Wyatt Earp]] and his brothers on their way to the [[Arizona Territory]]. [[Virgil Earp]] had already been in [[Prescott, Arizona|Prescott]] before Wyatt persuaded his brothers to move to [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]]. Holliday was making money at the gambling tables in Prescott, while Kate worked as a prostitute in the upstairs rooms at [[The Palace Restaurant and Saloon|The Palace Saloon]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/trips-and-breaks/breathtaking-scenery-in-and-awesome-surprises-in-arizona-684660 | publisher=Manchester Evening News | title=Breathtaking scenery in and awesome surprises in Arizona | date=January 10, 2013 | last=Devine | first=Peter | accessdate=January 13, 2017 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131183216/http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/trips-and-breaks/breathtaking-scenery-in-and-awesome-surprises-in-arizona-684660 | archivedate=January 31, 2017 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; he and Kate parted ways when Kate left for [[Globe, Arizona]], but she rejoined Holliday soon after he arrived in Tombstone.

=== Move to Tombstone ===
Holliday, like his friend Wyatt Earp, was always looking for an opportunity to make money and joined the Earps in Tombstone during the fall of 1880.&lt;ref name="bork1935"/&gt; On March 15, 1881, at 10:00 pm, three cowboys attempted to rob a Kinnear&amp;nbsp;&amp; Company stagecoach carrying $26,000 in [[silver bullion]] (by the inflation adjustment algorithm: ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|26000|1881}}}} in today's dollars) near [[Benson, Arizona]], during which the popular driver Eli "Budd" Philpot and passenger Peter Roerig were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tombstone, AZ|url=http://silverstateghosttowns.com/tombstone-az.html|accessdate=17 May 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324044531/http://silverstateghosttowns.com/tombstone-az.html|archivedate=24 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cochise County Cowboys|Cochise County Cowboy]] [[Bill Leonard (cowboy)|Bill Leonard]], a former [[watchmaker]] from [[New York City]], was one of three men implicated in the robbery, and he and Holliday had become good friends.&lt;ref name=weir&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Weir | first1=William | title=History's Greatest Lies: the Startling Truths Behind World Events our History Books Got Wrong | year=2009 | publisher=Fair Winds Press | location=Beverly, MA | isbn=1-59233-336-2 | page=288}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Kate and Holliday had a fight, County Sheriff [[Johnny Behan]] and Milt Joyce, a county supervisor and owner of the Oriental Saloon, decided to exploit the situation.

Behan and Joyce plied Kate with alcohol and suggested to her a way to get even with Holliday. She signed an affidavit implicating Holliday in the murders and attempted robbery. Judge [[Wells Spicer]] issued an [[arrest warrant]] for Holliday. The Earps found witnesses who could attest to Holliday's whereabouts elsewhere at the time of the murders. Kate said that Behan and Joyce had influenced her to sign a document she didn't understand. With the Cowboy plot revealed, Judge Spicer freed Holliday. The district attorney threw out the charges, labeling them "ridiculous".&lt;ref name="robbery"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://law.jrank.org/pages/2653/Wyatt-Earp-Trial-1881-Mysterious-Stage-Coach-Robbery.html |title=Wyatt Earp Trial: 1881 - A Mysterious Stage Coach Robbery - Clanton, Holliday, Told, Leonard, Doc, and Ike |accessdate=2011-02-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726211028/http://law.jrank.org/pages/2653/Wyatt-Earp-Trial-1881-Mysterious-Stage-Coach-Robbery.html |archivedate=2011-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After Holliday was released, he gave Kate money and put her on the stage. Kate returned to Globe for a time, but she returned to Tombstone in October of that year.&lt;ref name="robbery"/&gt;

=== Gunfight at the O.K. Corral ===
{{main|Gunfight at the O.K. Corral}}
In a 1939 letter to her niece Lillian Rafferty, Kate claimed that she was in the Tombstone area with Holliday during the days before the shootout. According to Kate, she was with Holliday in [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] when they attended the [[festival|San Augustin Feast and Fair]] in Levin Park during October 1881. On October 20, 1881, [[Morgan Earp]] rode to Tucson to request Holliday's assistance with dealing with  [[Cochise County Cowboys]] who had threatened to kill the Earps. She wrote that Holliday asked her to remain in Tucson for her safety, but she refused, and traveled with Holliday and Earp. Kate reminisced in the letter about her stay with Holliday at [[C. S. Fly|C.S. Fly's]] Boarding House which bordered the alley where the [[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral]] took place. Kate accurately described minor details of the shootout.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Kate wrote that on the day of the gunfight, a man entered Fly's Boarding House with a "bandaged head" and a rifle. He was looking for Holliday, who was still in bed after a night of gambling. Kate recalled that the man who was turned away by Mrs.&amp;nbsp;Fly was later identified as [[Ike Clanton]], whom city marshal [[Virgil Earp]] had [[pistol-whipping|pistol-whipped]] earlier that day when he found Clanton carrying a rifle and pistol in violation of city ordinances.&lt;ref name="wyatttestimony"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/earp/wearptestimony.html|title=Testimony of Wyatt S.

Virgil Earp had disarmed him earlier that day and told Ike he would leave Ike's confiscated rifle and revolver at the Grand Hotel, which was favored by cowboys when they were in town. Ike testified afterward that he had tried to buy a new revolver at Spangenberger's gun and hardware store on 4th Street but the owner saw Ike's bandaged head and refused to sell him one.&lt;ref name="iketestimony"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/earp/clantontestimony.html|title=Testimony of Ike Clanton in the Preliminary Hearing in the Earp-Holliday Case|accessdate=2011-02-06|year=2005|author=Douglas Linder|work=Famous Trials: The O.

Author [[Glenn Boyer]] disputes that Kate saw the gunfight through the window of the boarding house. According to him also, Kate stated that after Doc Holliday returned to his room, he sat on the edge of his bed and wept from the shock of what had happened during the close-range gunfight. "That was awful," Kate claims he said. "Just awful."&lt;ref name="bork1935"/&gt;&lt;ref name="boyer"/&gt; Boyer's work, however, has been rejected by serious scholars.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

== After the O.K. Corral and later life ==
Kate is reported{{by whom|date=October 2014}} to have made trips to Tombstone to see Holliday until he left for [[Colorado]] in April 1882.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} In 1887, Kate traveled to [[Redstone, Colorado]], close to [[Glenwood Springs, Colorado]], to visit with her brother Alexander. Some historians{{who|date=October 2014}} have tried to connect Kate and Doc to possible reconciliation attempts between the two.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

=== Marries George Cummings ===
After Doc Holliday died in 1887, Kate married Irish blacksmith George Cummings in [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]], on March 2, 1890. After working several mining camps throughout Colorado, they moved to [[Bisbee, Arizona]], where she briefly ran a bakery. After returning to [[Willcox, Arizona]], in [[Cochise County, Arizona|Cochise County]], Cummings became an abusive alcoholic and they separated. In 1900, Kate moved to Dos Cabezas or [[Cochise, Arizona|Cochise]] and worked for John and Lulu Rath, owners of the [[Cochise Hotel]]. Cummings committed suicide in Courtland, Arizona, in 1915.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Kate is enumerated in the 1910 U.S. Census in Dos Cabezas, Arizona, as a member of the home of miner John J. Howard. When Howard died in 1930, Kate was the [[executrix]] of his [[will (law)|estate]]. She contacted his only daughter, who lived in [[Tempe, Arizona]], and settled the inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;Ancestry.com.{{clarify|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931 the 80 year-old Kate contacted her longtime friend, Arizona Governor [[George W.P. Hunt|George Hunt]], and applied for admittance to the [[Arizona Pioneers' Home]] in [[Prescott, Arizona]]. The home had been established in 1910 by the State of Arizona for destitute and ailing miners and male pioneers of the [[Arizona Territory]]. It took Kate six months to be admitted, since the home had a requirement that residents must be American citizens. According to the 1935 Bork interview, Kate was owed money by the Howard estate, but the amount owed was not enough to buy firewood through the winter, as Kate had complained in her letters to the governor.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters to Governor Hunt, Arizona State Legislature''{{clarify|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was admitted as one of the first female residents of the home. She lived there and became an outspoken resident, assisting other residents with living comforts. Kate wrote many letters to the Arizona state legislature, often contacting the governor when she was not satisfied with their response.&lt;ref&gt;Letters to A.N. Kelly, State Legislature{{clarify|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Near the end of her life, several reporters tried to record Kate's life story, her relationship with [[Doc Holliday]] and her time in [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]]. She only talked to Anton Mazzonovich and Prescott historian A. W. Bork.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

== Death and discrepancies in records ==
[[File:Prescott Big Nose Kate Gravesite.jpg|thumb|Gravesite of "Big Nose Kate"]]
Kate died on November 2, 1940, just five days before her 90th birthday, of acute myocardial insufficiency, a condition she started showing symptoms of the day before her death. Her death certificate states that she also suffered from [[coronary artery disease]] and advanced arteriosclerosis. Kate's death certificate contained significant discrepancies regarding her parents' names and her birthplace. Although she was born in Hungary, her death certificate states she was born in [[Davenport, Iowa]], to father Marchal&amp;nbsp;H. Michael and mother Catherine Baldwin. The birthplace of both her parents is shown on the certificate as "unknown".&lt;ref name="genealogy.az.gov"&gt;[http://genealogy.az.gov/azdeath/064/10640460.pdf ADHS Arizona Genealogy Birth and Death Certificates online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721014108/http://genealogy.az.gov/azdeath/064/10640460.pdf |date=2011-07-21 }}.

Kate was buried on November 6, 1940,&lt;ref name="genealogy.az.gov"/&gt; under the name "Mary K. Cummings" in the Arizona Pioneer Home Cemetery in Prescott, Arizona.

'''Bristol board''' (also referred to as '''Bristol paper''' or '''Super white paper''') is an [[Woodfree uncoated paper|uncoated]], machine-finished [[paperboard]]. It is named after the city of [[Bristol]] in the southwest of [[England]] as that is where it was first produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mixed Media Superstar: All About Bristol Board|url=https://www.craftsy.com/blog/2015/06/what-is-bristol-board/|publisher=Craftsy|accessdate=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common sizes include {{cvt|22+1/2|×|28+1/2|in|mm|0}} and its bulk thickness is {{convert|0.006|in|mm}} or higher&lt;ref&gt;[http://desktoppub.about.com/library/glossary/bldef-bristolpaper.htm About.com: Desktop Publishing].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[ISO 216|A4, A3, A2 and A1]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daler-rowney.com/en/content/graphic-series Daler Rowney] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831062219/http://www.daler-rowney.com/en/content/graphic-series |date=August 31, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studioartshop.com/acatalog/Paper_and_Pads.html Goldline pads included in product listings]&lt;/ref&gt; Bristol board may be rated by the number of [[wikt:ply|plies]] it contains or, in Europe, by its [[grammage]] of 220 to 250&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. It is normally white, but is also made in different colours.

==Applications==
Bristol paper is used for printing documents, [[brochures]], promotional materials and [[envelopes]]. It is often used for water color painting. It is also used for [[paperback]] book or catalog covers, [[file folders]], tags, and [[Ticket (admission)|tickets]]. Another use is for scale models; some students use this kind of paper for the walls in their scale models. One-ply Bristol is thin enough to be translucent, and two and three ply bristol are the most popular thicknesses. 

Bristol board is commonly used for [[technical drawing]], [[illustration]] projects, [[comic book]] art, and other two-dimensional art forms. It provides two working surfaces, front and back. This quality separates it from illustration board, which has only a front working surface. 

The surface texture is either '''plate''' or '''vellum'''. ''Plate'' finish is as smooth as glass{{fact|date=November 2018}}, and is very good for pen and ink. ''Vellum'' (or ''kid'') finish is a medium texture more appropriate to friction-based media, such as crayon, chalks, or charcoal. A third finish, ''engravers'' or ''wedding'', may be used for formal [[engraving|engraved]] wedding invitations.

The study of the '''causes of transsexuality''' investigates [[Gender identity#Factors influencing formation|gender identity formation]] of [[transgender]] people, especially those who are [[transsexual]]. Transsexual people have a gender identity that does not match their [[assigned sex]], often resulting in [[gender dysphoria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transgender experiences – Information and support|url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/documents/digitalasset/dh_097168.pdf|publisher=NHS|accessdate=2012-07-01|author=Curtis, R.|pages=12|format=PDF|date=March 2009|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--this is used to transclude content into [[Transsexual]], [[Transgender]] and potentially other articles--&gt;&lt;section begin="factors" /&gt; The causes of transsexuality have been studied for decades.  The most studied factors are biological. Certain brain structures in trans women have been found to be similar to [[cisgender]] women's as opposed to cis men's, and trans men's have been found to be similar to cis men's, even controlling for [[Hormone therapy|hormone use]], which can also cause trans people's brains to become closer to those of cis people of the same gender. However, these studies are limited as they include a small number of tested individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.4158/EP14351.RA |pmid=25667367 |title=Evidence Supporting the Biologic Nature of Gender Identity |journal=Endocrine Practice |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=199–204 |year=2015 |last1=Saraswat |first1=Aruna |last2=Weinand |first2=Jamie |last3=Safer |first3=Joshua }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brain structure differences have also been noted between [[gay]] and [[heterosexual]] men, as well as [[lesbian]] and heterosexual women as part of extensive research on [[biology and sexual orientation]]. Studies have also found that both [[androphilic and gynephilic]] trans women's brain function and responses are like cis women's and unlike cis men's, or are intermediate between the two. Likewise, studies such as Rametti's have found that trans men have male-like white matter patterns (even before using hormones), regardless of sexual orientation.

With regard to genetic factors, a study by Hare reported that trans women have a longer androgen receptor gene than cis men, which is less effective at binding testosterone, potentially preventing complete masculinization of the brain (prenatal androgen exposure or sensitivity, or lack thereof, is an often cited mechanism to explain observed brain-structure differences).&lt;ref name="Hare"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2008.08.033 |pmid=18962445 |pmc=3402034 |title=Androgen Receptor Repeat Length Polymorphism Associated with Male-to-Female Transsexualism |journal=Biological Psychiatry |volume=65 |issue=1 |pages=93–6 |year=2009 |last1=Hare |first1=Lauren |last2=Bernard |first2=Pascal |last3=Sánchez |first3=Francisco J |last4=Baird |first4=Paul N |last5=Vilain |first5=Eric |last6=Kennedy |first6=Trudy |last7=Harley |first7=Vincent R }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by Bentz found that trans men have a [[CYP17]] allele distribution like cis men and unlike cis women.&lt;ref name="Bentz"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bentz |first1=E |last2=Hefler |first2=L |last3=Kaufmann |first3=U |last4=Huber |first4=J |last5=Kolbus |first5=A |last6=Tempfer|first6=C |title=A polymorphism of the CYP17 gene related to sex steroid metabolism is associated with female-to-male but not male-to-female transsexualism |journal=Fertility and Sterility |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=56–9 |year=2008 |pmid=17765230 |doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2007.05.056}}&lt;/ref&gt; A twin study published in the ''International Journal of Transgenderism'' found that 33%&lt;!--[[WP:CALC]]: 13+8 / 39+25--&gt; of identical twin pairs were both trans, compared to only 2.6% of non-identical twins who were raised in the same family at the same time, but were not genetically identical.&lt;ref name="TwinH"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.hawaii.edu/PCSS/biblio/articles/2010to2014/2013-transsexuality.html|title = Transsexuality Among Twins: Identity Concordance, Transition, Rearing, and Orientation|last = Diamond|first = Milton|date = May 2013|journal = International Journal of Transgenderism|doi =10.1080/15532739.2013.750222 |pmid = |access-date = 14 June 2015|volume=14|issue=1|pages=24–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental factors have also been proposed. The failure of an attempt to raise [[David Reimer]] from infancy through adolescence as a girl after his genitals were accidentally mutilated is cited as disproving the theory that gender identity is determined by upbringing. [[Ray Blanchard]] developed [[Blanchard's transsexualism typology|a taxonomy of male-to-female transsexualism]] that proposes two distinct etiologies for androphilic and gynephilic individuals that has become highly controversial, supported by [[J. Michael Bailey]], [[Anne Lawrence]], [[James Cantor]], [[Richard F. Docter]] and others, but opposed by [[Charles Allen Moser]], [[Larry Nuttbrock]], [[Julia Serano]], and the [[World Professional Association for Transgender Health]].&lt;section end="factors" /&gt;&lt;!--this is used to transclude content into [[Transsexual]], [[Transgender]] and potentially other articles--&gt;

==Biological factors==

===Genetics===
A 2008 study compared 112 male-to-female transsexuals (both androphilic and gynephilic), mostly already undergoing hormone treatment, with 258 cisgender male controls. Male-to-female transsexuals were more likely than cisgender males to have a longer version of a receptor gene (longer repetitions of the gene) for the sex hormone androgen or testosterone, which reduced its effectiveness at binding [[testosterone]].&lt;ref name="Hare"/&gt; The [[androgen receptor]] (NR3C4) is activated by the binding of [[testosterone]] or [[dihydrotestosterone]], where it plays a critical role in the forming of [[primary sexual characteristics|primary]] and [[secondary sexual characteristics|secondary]] male sex characteristics. The research suggests reduced androgen and androgen signaling contributes to the female gender identity of male-to-female transsexuals. The authors say that a decrease in testosterone levels in the brain during development might prevent complete masculinization of the brain in male-to-female transsexuals and thereby cause a more feminized brain and a female gender identity.&lt;ref name="Hare"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2008/10/27/2401941.htm|title=Transsexual study reveals genetic link|work=abc.net.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variant genotype for a gene called [[CYP17A1|CYP17]], which acts on the sex hormones [[pregnenolone]] and [[progesterone]], has been found to be linked to [[female-to-male transsexual|female-to-male]] transsexuality but not MtF transsexuality.  Most notably, the FtM subjects not only had the variant genotype more frequently, but had an allele distribution equivalent to male controls, unlike the female controls. The paper concluded that the loss of a female-specific CYP17 T -34C allele distribution pattern is associated with FtM transsexuality.&lt;ref name="Bentz"/&gt;

===Transsexuality among twins===
In 2013, a [[twin study]] combined a survey of pairs of twins where one or both had undergone, or had plans and medical approval to undergo, gender transition, with a literature review of published reports of transgender twins. The study found that one third of identical twin pairs in the sample were both transgender: 13 of 39 (33%) monozygotic or identical pairs of [[assigned sex|assigned males]] and 8 of 35 (22.8%) pairs of assigned females. Among dizygotic or genetically non-identical twin pairs, there was only 1 of 38 (2.6%) pairs where both twins were trans.&lt;ref name="TwinH"/&gt; The significant percent of identical twin pairs in which both twins are trans and the virtual absence of dizygotic twins (raised in the same family at the same time) in which both were trans would provide evidence that transgender identity is significantly influenced by genetics if both sets were raised in different families.&lt;ref name="TwinH" /&gt;

===Brain structure===
Several studies have found a correlation between gender identity and brain structure.&lt;ref&gt;For a survey, see Swaab, Dick F.; Castellanos-Cruz, L.; Bao, A.-M. "The Human Brain and Gender: Sexual Differentiation of Our Brains." In: Schreiber, Gerhard. ''Transsexuality in Theology and Neuroscience. Findings, Controversies, and Perspectives.'' Berlin and Boston: Walter de Gruyter 2016 ({{ISBN|978-3-11-044080-5}}), pp. 23-42.&lt;/ref&gt; A first-of-its-kind study by Zhou ''et al.'' (1995) found that in a region of the brain called the bed nucleus of the [[stria terminalis]] (BSTc), a region which is known for sex and [[anxiety response]]s (and which is affected by prenatal androgens),&lt;ref&gt;Neil R. Carlson, ''Psychology: The Science of Behavior'', Pearson Education, p. 418{{year missing|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; cadavers of six persons who were described as having been male-to-female transsexual or transgender persons in life had female-normal BSTc size, similar to the study's cadavers of [[cisgender]] women. While the transsexuals studied had taken hormones, this was accounted for by including cadavers of non-transsexual male and female controls who, for a variety of medical reasons, had experienced hormone reversal. The controls still had sizes typical for their gender. No relationship to sexual orientation was found.&lt;ref name="Zhou/Gooren"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zhou |first1=Jiang-Ning |last2=Hofman |first2=Michel A. |last3=Gooren |first3=Louis J. G. |last4=Swaab |first4=Dick F. |title=A sex difference in the human brain and its relation to transsexuality |journal=Nature |volume=378 |issue=6552 |pages=68–70 |year=1995 |pmid=7477289 |doi=10.1038/378068a0|bibcode=1995Natur.378...68Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a follow-up study, Kruijver ''et al.'' (2000) looked at the number of neurons in BSTc instead of volumes. They found the same results as Zhou ''et al.'' (1995), but with even more dramatic differences. One MtF subject, who had never gone on hormones, was also included and matched up with the female neuron counts nonetheless.&lt;ref name="Kruijver"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kruijver |first1=F. P. M. |last2=Zhou |first2=JN |last3=Pool |first3=CW |last4=Hofman |first4=MA |last5=Gooren |first5=LJ |last6=Swaab |first6=DF |title=Male-to-Female Transsexuals Have Female Neuron Numbers in a Limbic Nucleus |journal=Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism |volume=85 |issue=5 |pages=2034–41 |year=2000 |doi=10.1210/jcem.85.5.6564 |pmid=10843193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, a follow-up study by Chung ''et al.'' found that significant sexual dimorphism (variation between sexes) in BSTc did not become established until adulthood.  Chung ''et al.'' theorized that either changes in fetal hormone levels produce changes in BSTc synaptic density, neuronal activity, or neurochemical content which later lead to size and neuron count changes in BSTc, or that the size of BSTc is affected by the generation of a gender identity inconsistent with one's assigned sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chung |first1=WC |last2=De Vries |first2=GJ |last3=Swaab |first3=DF |title=Sexual differentiation of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis in humans may extend into adulthood |journal=Journal of Neuroscience |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=1027–33 |year=2002 |pmid=11826131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of the evidence in 2006, Gooren confirmed the earlier research as supporting the concept of transsexuality as a sexual differentiation disorder of the sex dimorphic brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gooren |first1=L |title=The biology of human psychosexual differentiation |journal=Hormones and Behavior |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=589–601 |year=2006 |pmid=16870186 |doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2006.06.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dick Swaab]] (2004) concurs.&lt;ref name="number11"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Swaab |first1=DF |title=Sexual differentiation of the human brain: relevance for gender identity, transsexualism and sexual orientation |journal=Gynecological Endocrinology |volume=19 |issue=6 |pages=301–12 |year=2004 |pmid=15724806 |doi=10.1080/09513590400018231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, a new region with properties similar to that of BSTc in regards to transsexuality was found by Garcia-Falgueras and Swaab: the interstitial nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus (INAH3), part of the hypothalamic uncinate nucleus. The same method of controlling for hormone usage was used as in Zhou ''et al.'' (1995) and Kruijver ''et al.'' (2000). The differences were even more pronounced than with BSTc; control males averaged 1.9 times the volume and 2.3 times the neurons as control females, yet once again, regardless of hormone exposure, MtF transsexuals lay within the female range and the FtM transsexual within the male range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Garcia-Falgueras |first1=A. |last2=Swaab |first2=D. F. |title=A sex difference in the hypothalamic uncinate nucleus: relationship to gender identity |journal=Brain |volume=131 |issue=Pt 12 |pages=3132–46 |year=2008 |pmid=18980961 |doi=10.1093/brain/awn276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 [[MRI]] study by Luders et al. of 24 MtF transsexuals not yet treated with cross-sex hormones found that regional [[gray matter]] concentrations were more similar to those of cisgender men than to those of cisgender women, but there was a significantly larger volume of gray matter in the right [[putamen]] compared to cisgender men. Like earlier studies, it concluded that transsexuality was associated with a distinct cerebral pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Luders |first1=Eileen |last2=Sánchez |first2=Francisco J. |last3=Gaser |first3=Christian |last4=Toga |first4=Arthur W. |last5=Narr |first5=Katherine L. |last6=Hamilton |first6=Liberty S. |last7=Vilain |first7=Eric |title=Regional gray matter variation in male-to-female transsexualism |journal=NeuroImage |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=904–7 |year=2009 |pmid=19341803 |pmc=2754583 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.03.048}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[MRI]] allows easier study of larger brain structures, but independent nuclei are not visible due to lack of contrast between different neurological tissue types, hence other studies on e.g. BSTc were done by dissecting brains post-mortem.)

An additional feature was studied in a group of FtM transsexuals who had not yet received cross-sex hormones: [[fractional anisotropy]] values for [[white matter]] in the medial and posterior parts of the right superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), the forceps minor, and the corticospinal tract. Rametti ''et al.'' (2010) discovered that, "Compared to control females, FtM showed higher FA values in posterior part of the right SLF, the forceps minor and corticospinal tract. Compared to control males, FtM showed only lower FA values in the corticospinal tract."&lt;ref name=pmid20562024&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jpsychires.2010.05.006 |pmid=20562024 |title=White matter microstructure in female to male transsexuals before cross-sex hormonal treatment.

Hulshoff Pol ''et al.'' (2006) studied the gross brain volume of 8 male-to-female transsexuals and in 6 female-to-male transsexuals undergoing hormone treatment. They found that hormones changed the sizes of the hypothalamus in a gender consistent manner: treatment with male hormones shifted the hypothalamus towards the male direction in the same way as in male controls, and treatment with female hormones shifted the hypothalamus towards the female direction in the same way as female controls. They concluded: "The findings suggest that, throughout life, gonadal hormones remain essential for maintaining aspects of sex-specific differences in the human brain."&lt;ref name="CSCB"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pol |first1=H. E H. |last2=Cohen-Kettenis |first2=P. T |last3=Van Haren |first3=N. E M |last4=Peper |first4=J. S |last5=Brans |first5=R. G H |last6=Cahn |first6=W. |last7=Schnack |first7=H.

Brain-based research has repeatedly shown that female-to-male transsexuals have several male-like characteristics in neuroanatomy. In 2010, a team of neuroscientists compared 18 female-to-male transsexuals with 24 male and 19 female gynephilic controls, using an MRI technique called [[diffusion tensor imaging]] or DTI.&lt;ref name=pmid20562024/&gt; DTI is a specialized technique for visualizing [[white matter]] of the brain, and white matter structure is one of the differences in neuroanatomy between men and women. The study found that the white matter pattern in female-to-male transsexuals was shifted in the direction of biological males, even before the female-to-male transsexuals started taking male hormones (which can also modify brain structure).

Similar [[Biology and sexual orientation#Studies of brain structure|brain structure differences]] have been noted between gay and heterosexual men, and between lesbian and heterosexual women.&lt;ref name="LeVay 1991"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=LeVay S |title=A difference in hypothalamic structure between heterosexual and homosexual men |journal=Science |volume=253 |issue=5023 |pages=1034–7 |date=August 1991 |pmid=1887219 |doi=10.1126/science.1887219 |bibcode=1991Sci...253.1034L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Byne 2001"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Byne W, Tobet S, Mattiace LA |title=The interstitial nuclei of the human anterior hypothalamus: an investigation of variation with sex, sexual orientation, and HIV status |journal=Horm Behav |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=86–92 |date=September 2001 |pmid=11534967 |doi=10.1006/hbeh.2001.1680 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have also found that circumstance and repeated activities such as [[Research on meditation|meditation]] modify brain structures in a process called brain plasticity or [[neuroplasticity]]. In May 2014, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reported that parenting "rewires the male brain" for fathers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.1402569111 |pmid=24912146 |pmc=4103311 |title=Father's brain is sensitive to childcare experiences |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=111 |issue=27 |pages=9792–7 |year=2014 |last1=Abraham |first1=Eyal |last2=Hendler |first2=Talma |last3=Shapira-Lichter |first3=Irit |last4=Kanat-Maymon |first4=Yaniv |last5=Zagoory-Sharon |first5=Orna |last6=Feldman |first6=Ruth |bibcode=2014PNAS..111.9792A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brain function===

====Androphilic male-to-female transsexuals====
Studies have shown that  [[androphilic]] male-to-female transsexuals show a shift towards the female direction in brain anatomy. In 2009, a German team of radiologists led by Gizewski compared 12 androphilic transsexuals with 12 cisgender males and 12 cisgender females. Using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), they found that when shown erotica, the cisgender men responded in several brain regions that the cisgender women did not, and that the sample of androphilic transsexuals was shifted towards the female direction in brain responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gizewski |first1 = E. R. | last2 = Krause | first2 = E. | last3 = Schlamann | first3 = M. | last4 = Happich | first4 = F. | last5 = Ladd | first5 = M.

In another study, Rametti and colleagues used [[diffusion tensor imaging]] (DTI) to compare 18 androphilic male-to-female transsexuals with 19 gynephilic males and 19 androphilic cisgender females. The androphilic transsexuals differed from both control groups in multiple brain areas, including the superior longitudinal fasciculus, the right anterior cingulum, the right forceps minor, and the right corticospinal tract. The study authors concluded that androphilic transsexuals were halfway between the patterns exhibited by male and female controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rametti | first1 = G. | last2 = Carrillo | first2 = B. | last3 = Gómez-Gil | first3 = E. | last4 = Junque | first4 = C. | last5 = Zubiarre-Elorza | first5 = L. | last6 = Segovia | first6 = S. | last7 = Gomez | first7 = Á. | last8 = Guillamon | first8 = A. | year = 2010 | title = The microstructure of white matter in male to female transsexuals before cross-sex hormonal treatment: A DTI study | url = | journal = Journal of Psychiatric Research | volume =  45| issue = | pages =  949–954| doi = 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2010.11.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gynephilic male-to-female transsexuals====
While MRI taken on [[gynephilic]] male-to-female transsexuals have likewise shown differences in the brain from non-transsexuals, no feminization of the brain's structure have however been identified.
Researchers of the [[Karolinska Institute]] of [[Stockholm]] used MRI to compare 24 gynephilic male-to-female transsexuals with 24 cisgender male and 24 cisgender female controls. None of the study participants were on hormone treatment. The researchers found sex-typical differentiation between the MtF transsexuals and cisgender males, and the cisgender females; but the gynephilic transsexuals "displayed also singular features and differed from both control groups by having reduced [[thalamus]] and [[putamen]] volumes and elevated GM volumes in the [[Insular cortex|right insular]] and [[Inferior frontal gyrus|inferior frontal cortex]] and an area covering the right [[angular gyrus]]".

These researchers concluded that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Contrary to the primary hypothesis, no sex-atypical features with signs of 'feminization' were detected in the transsexual group ... The present study does not support the dogma that [male-to-female transsexuals] have atypical sex dimorphism in the brain but confirms the previously reported sex differences. The observed differences between MtF-TR and controls raise the question as to whether gender dysphoria may be associated with changes in multiple structures and involve a network (rather than a single nodal area).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Savic | first1 = I. | last2 = Arver | first2 = S. | year = 2011 | title = Sex dimorphism of the brain in male-to-female transsexuals | url = | journal = Cerebral Cortex | volume =  21| issue = | pages =  2525–2533| doi = 10.1093/cercor/bhr032 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

(2008) tested the response of [[gynephilia|gynephilic]] MtF transsexuals to two sex pheromones: the progestin-like 4,16-androstadien-3-one (AND) and the estrogen-like 1,3,5(10),16-tetraen-3-ol (EST). Despite the difference in sexual orientation, the MtFs' hypothalamic networks activated in response to the AND pheromone, like the [[androphilia|androphilic]] female control groups. Both groups experienced amygdala activation in response to EST. Gynephilic male control groups experienced hypothalamic activation in response to EST. However, the MtF subjects also experienced limited hypothalamic activation to EST. The researchers concluded that in terms of pheromone activation, MtFs occupy an intermediate position with predominantly female features.&lt;ref name=pmid18056697&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/cercor/bhm216 |pmid=18056697 |title=Male-to-Female Transsexuals Show Sex-Atypical Hypothalamus Activation when Smelling Odorous Steroids |journal=Cerebral Cortex |volume=18 |issue=8 |pages=1900–8 |year=2007 |last1=Berglund |first1=H |last2=Lindstrom |first2=P |last3=Dhejne-Helmy |first3=C |last4=Savic |first4=I }}&lt;/ref&gt; The MtF transsexual subjects had not undergone any hormonal treatment at the time of the study, according to their own declaration beforehand, and confirmed by repeated tests of hormonal levels.&lt;ref name=pmid18056697/&gt;

====Gynephilic female-to-male transsexuals====
Another team of neuroscientists, led by Nawata in Japan, used a technique called [[single-photon emission computed tomography]] (SPECT) to compare the regional [[cerebral blood flow]] (rCBF) of 11 gynephilic FtM transsexuals with that of 9 androphilic cis females. Although the study did not include a sample of biological males so that a conclusion of "male shift" could be made, the study did reveal that the gynephilic FtM transsexuals showed significant decrease in blood flow in the left anterior cingulate cortex and a significant increase in the right [[Insular cortex|insula]], two brain regions known to respond during sexual arousal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1440-1819.2009.02059.x |pmid=20132527 |title=Regional cerebral blood flow changes in female to male gender identity disorder |journal=Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences |volume=64 |issue=2 |pages=157–61 |year=2010 |last1=Nawata |first1=Hideyuki |last2=Ogomori |first2=Koji |last3=Tanaka |first3=Mariko |last4=Nishimura |first4=Ryoji |last5=Urashima |first5=Hajime |last6=Yano |first6=Rika |last7=Takano |first7=Koichi |last8=Kuwabara |first8=Yasuo }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Phantom limb syndrome====
[[Phantom limb syndrome]] is a common, often painful experience after the loss of an external organ. Ramachandran (2008) found that while nearly two thirds of non-transsexual males who have a penis surgically removed experience the sensation of a phantom penis, only one third of MtF transsexuals do so after [[male-to-female sex reassignment surgery|sex reassignment surgery]]. However, this study overlooks differences between an amputation, where nerves connecting the penis and brain are severed, and reassignment surgery, where some of the penis and scrotum may be reused to create a vaginal canal, labia and a clitoris. In this case, some nerves connecting the genitalia to the brain remain intact. Two thirds of FtM transsexuals reported the sensation of a phantom penis from childhood onwards, complete with phantom erections and other phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ramachandran |first=V. S. |title=Phantom Penises In Transsexuals |journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=5–16 |year=2008 |url=http://openurl.ingenta.com/content?genre=article&amp;issn=1355-8250&amp;volume=15&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=5&amp;epage=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prenatal androgen exposure===
Prenatal androgen exposure, the lack thereof, or poor sensitivity to prenatal androgens are commonly cited mechanisms to explain the above discoveries. Schneider, Pickel, and Stalla (2006) found a correlation between [[digit ratio]] (a generally accepted marker for prenatal androgen exposure) and male-to-female transsexuality. MtF transsexuals were found to have a higher digit ratio than control males, but one that was comparable to control females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schneider |first1=H |last2=Pickel |first2=J |last3=Stalla |first3=G |title=Typical female 2nd–4th finger length (2D:4D) ratios in male-to-female transsexuals—possible implications for prenatal androgen exposure |journal=Psychoneuroendocrinology |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=265–9 |year=2006 |pmid=16140461 |doi=10.1016/j.psyneuen.2005.07.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] in persons with XX sex chromosomes results in what is considered to be excess exposure to prenatal [[androgen]]s, resulting in masculinization of the genitalia and, typically, [[Intersex human rights|controversial]] prenatal hormone treatment&lt;ref name="dreger2012"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11673-012-9384-9 |pmid=22904609 |pmc=3416978 |title=Prenatal Dexamethasone for Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia |journal=Journal of Bioethical Inquiry |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=277–294 |year=2012 |last1=Dreger |first1=Alice |last2=Feder |first2=Ellen K |last3=Tamar-Mattis |first3=Anne }}&lt;/ref&gt; and postnatal surgical interventions.&lt;ref name="clayton"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1159/000065490 |pmid=12324718 |title=Consensus Statement on 21-Hydroxylase Deficiency from the European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology and the Lawson Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society |journal=Hormone Research in Paediatrics |volume=58 |issue=4 |pages=188–95 |year=2002 |author1=Clayton |first1=P.

W |author7=ESPE/ LWPES CAH Working Group }}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with CAH are usually raised as girls and tend to have similar cognitive abilities to the typical female, including [[spatial ability]], verbal ability, [[Lateralization of brain function#Lateralization of language processes|language lateralization]], [[handedness]] and [[aggression]]. Research has shown that people with CAH and XX chromosomes will be more likely to be same sex attracted,&lt;ref name="dreger2012" /&gt; and at least 5.2% of these individuals develop serious gender dysphoria.&lt;ref name="erickson-schroth"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Erickson-Schroth | first1 = Laura | year = 2013 | title = Update on the Biology of Transgender Identity | url = | journal = Journal of Gay &amp; Lesbian Mental Health | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 150–74 | doi = 10.1080/19359705.2013.753393 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In males with [[5-alpha-reductase deficiency]], conversion of [[testosterone]] to [[dihydrotestosterone]] is disrupted, decreasing the masculinization of genitalia. Individuals with this condition are typically raised as females due to their feminine appearance at a young age. However, more than half of males with this condition raised as females become males later in their life. Scientists speculate that the definition of masculine characteristics during puberty and the increased social status afforded to men are two possible motivations for a female-to-male transition.&lt;ref name="erickson-schroth"/&gt;

==Psychological factors and theories==

===Rearing===
For many years, people such as [[psychiatrist]] and [[sexologist]] [[David Oliver Cauldwell]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wpath.org/journal/www.iiav.nl/ezines/web/IJT/97-03/numbers/symposion/cauldwell_03.htm Desire for Surgical Sex Transmutation: An Insane Fancy of Near Males.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619084712/http://www.wpath.org/journal/www.iiav.nl/ezines/web/IJT/97-03/numbers/symposion/cauldwell_03.htm |date=2010-06-19 }} D.O.

''The transsexual phenomenon.'' New York: Julian Press, page 85.&lt;/ref&gt; argued that transsexuality was a psychological/emotional disorder caused by psychological and environmental factors and personality conflicts. The failure of an attempt to raise [[David Reimer]] from infancy through adolescence as a girl after his genitals were accidentally mutilated is cited as disproving this theory that [[gender identity]] is determined by parenting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David Reimer, subject of 'sex reassignment,' dead at 38|url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2004/May/13/ln/ln52a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Colapinto&gt;{{cite book | last = Colapinto  | first = J | title = As Nature Made Him: The Boy Who Was Raised as a Girl | publisher = [[Harper Perennial]] | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-06-092959-6 | authorlink = John Colapinto}} Revised in 2006{{pn|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, no studies have been able to demonstrate this at a large scale, in part due to widespread agreement among scholars that the Reimer study's methodology was unethical.&lt;ref&gt;http://sciencecases.lib.buffalo.edu/cs/files/gender_reassignment.pdf{{full|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reimer's case is used by organizations such as the [[Intersex Society of North America]] to caution against needlessly modifying the genitals of unconsenting minors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isna.org/faq/reimer Intersex Society of North America | A world free of shame, secrecy, and unwanted genital surgery]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blanchard's theories about sexuality===
{{See also|Blanchard's transsexualism typology}}
[[Ray Blanchard]] has developed a [[Blanchard's transsexualism typology|taxonomy]] of [[male-to-female transsexual]]ism&lt;ref name="Blanchard1989"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blanchard |first1=RAY |doi=10.1097/00005053-198910000-00004 |title=The Concept of Autogynephilia and the Typology of Male Gender Dysphoria |pmid=2794988 |journal=The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease |year=1989 |volume=177 |issue=10 |pages=616–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; built upon the work of his colleague Kurt Freund,&lt;ref name="freund1982"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Freund |first1=Kurt |last2=Steiner |first2=Betty W. |last3=Chan |first3=Samuel |title=Two types of cross-gender identity |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=49–63 |year=1982 |pmid=7073469 |doi=10.1007/BF01541365}}&lt;/ref&gt; which assumes that trans women have one of two motivations for transition.&lt;ref name="sept2201"&gt;Bailey, J.

By contrast, a 2009 study found that over 90% of cis women are also attracted to the thought of themselves as women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |last1=Moser |first1=Charles |title=Autogynephilia in women |year=2009 |pmid=7073469 |doi=10.1080/00918360903005212}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The theory has gained support from [[J.

The [[DSM-5]] ''Sexual and Gender Identity Disorders'' workgroup, of which Blanchard is a member, has said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In contemporary clinical practice, sexual orientation per se plays only a minor role in treatment protocols or decisions. Also, changes as to the preferred gender of sex partner occur during or after treatment (DeCuypere, Janes, &amp; Rubens, 2005; Lawrence, 2005; Schroder &amp; Carroll, 1999). It can be difficult to assess sexual orientation in individuals with a GI diagnosis, as they preoperatively might give incorrect information in order to be approved for hormonal and surgical treatment (Lawrence, 1999). Because sexual orientation subtyping is of interest to researchers in the field, it is recommended that reference to it be addressed in the text, but not as a specifier. It should also be assessed as a dimensional construct.&lt;ref name="DSM V Workgroup"&gt;from DSM5.org rationale bullet 18.

'''Critical applied linguistics''' ('''CALx''') is an interdisciplinary critical approach to [[English language|English]] [[applied linguistics]]. One of the central concerns in this approach is exposing the political dimensions and power relations involved in  mainstream applied linguistics, in areas like language teaching, language policy and planning, language testing, language rights, and so on.

The '''culture of Barbados''' is a blend of West African and [[British culture]]s present in [[Barbados]].  English is the official language of the nation, reflecting centuries of British influence, but the [[Barbadian English|Bajan]] dialect in which it is spoken is an iconic part of the Barbadian culture. This dialect is a combination of the languages from the different inhabitants in its history.

== British influence ==

The island's British influence stretches back almost 400 years to 1625, when Captain John Powell claimed it in the name of [[James I of England|King James I]].  The first British colonists arrived two years later, founding a settlement of 80 civilians and 10 African [[slaves]].  From the start, Barbados adopted the British style of government, creating a [[Parliamentary democracy]] in 1639.  During the colonial period, all members of the Legislative Assembly were members of the elite-[[plantocracy]].  

After Britain abolished slavery in 1838, non-whites quickly began to play a role in the island's government, with the first non-white member elected in 1843.  

Barbados gained full political independence from Britain in 1966, but chose to retain its traditional parliamentary democracy governmental style and remains a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].              

The love of the sport of [[cricket]] continues to be reflected as an essential part of Barbados' culture.  The most popular sport in Barbados, its [[Barbadian cricket team|cricket team]] has won numerous regional titles.  Many players on the team go on to greater success on the [[West Indian cricket team|West Indies team]] to compete in international games.  One of the most highly regarded cricket players of all time, Sir [[Garfield Sobers]], is a Barbados native. 

===Architecture===
The country's architecture pays further establishment testament to Britain, with many historic buildings still standing.  In addition to traditional wood and stone, coral was also used in construction, lending a unique Barbadian flair.  [[Jacobean architecture|Jacobean]], [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]], and [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] styles dominate.  But slaves constructed many of these buildings, as well as their own [[chattel house]]s, so they were an integral part of the island's architectural legacy.  Built of wood, chattel houses were set atop blocks instead of permanent foundations so they could be easily moved from place to place.  The vivid colours of these chattel houses show the West African influence.

==Culture==
=== Religion ===
{{main|Religion in Barbados}}

[[Religion]] plays a significant role in life on the island.  Up to 95% of the populace identifies itself as "[[Christian]]" (whether practicing or otherwise), and with its long British ties, the [[Anglican]] church comprises the largest segment of the population.&lt;ref name=Bureau&gt;U.S. Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. [http://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2008/108513.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2008]. ''U.S. Department of State Archive''. 19 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, [[Roman Catholic]], [[Baptist]], [[Methodist]], and other Christian denominations also support congregations.  The Christian population celebrates its deeply rooted faith in an annual festival, [[Gospelfest]].  
Smaller [[Judaism|Jewish]], [[Hinduism|Hindu]], and [[Islam|Muslim]] communities add some religious diversity. The [[Rastafarian]] faith also has its community of adherents, sometimes complaining of discrimination in schooling and employment.&lt;ref name=Bureau/&gt;

In addition to Gospelfest, Barbados holds many other carnivals and festivals.  The [[Landship (Barbados)|Landship]] is a Barbadian tradition.  It mimics and parodies the [[Royal Navy]], and incorporates music, dance and games.  The largest and most important festival in Barbados is [[Crop Over]], which celebrates the end of the [[sugarcane]] harvest.  Lasting three weeks, it includes fairs, parades, and contests.

=== Music ===
{{main|Music of Barbados}}
Music is an important part of the country's culture.  Modern [[Barbados]] has produced popular stars of [[calypso music|calypso]] and the indigenous [[spouge]] style, and also has a large [[jazz]] scene.  [[Reggae]], [[Soca music|soca]], and [[tuk band|tuk]] are popular as well.&lt;ref name="Cameron2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sarah Cameron|title=Barbados Footprint Focus Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZsP9AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA17|date=11 October 2013|publisher=Footprint Travel Guides|isbn=978-1-909268-32-6|pages=17–}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The vast majority of contemporary Bajan calypso and soca music centers around the five-week [[Crop Over]] festival, whose events begin in late May and run throughout the summer, climaxing in the first week of August with the Grand Kadooment&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barbados.org/cropclnd.htm Crop Over Calendar]. Barbados.Org. Retrieved 21 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as Kadooment Day), a national holiday in Barbados.&lt;ref&gt;Barbados Government Information Service.

Retrieved 21 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Every January, Barbados hosts the [[Barbados Jazz Festival]]. In mid-February, Barbados hosts the [[Barbados Holetown Festival]] which celebrates the arrival of the first English settlers.

Singer [[Rihanna]] was born and raised in Barbados. Although the better portion of her work mainly appeals to [[R&amp;B]] audiences, her first album [[Music of the Sun]] contains a mixture of Barbadian rhythms and American urban-pop songwriting,&lt;ref&gt;A&amp;E Television Networks.

Retrieved 21 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; just as her [[Loud (Rihanna album)|Loud]] album has a mixture of [[Ragga]] / [[Ska]] rhythms, along with [[Pop music]] and R&amp;B / [[Hip Hop]]. Robyn "Rihanna" Fenty was also declared Barbados' ambassador of [[Tourism]], which secured her a seat in the island's political arena from 2011 - 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Rihanna Declared Tourism Ambassador of Barbados [http://www.popeater.com/2011/06/16/rihanna-tourism-ambassador-for-barbados/].

'''Devotional objects''' (also, '''devotional articles, devotional souvenirs, devotional artifacts''') are religious [[souvenir]]s (figurines, pictures, [[votive candle]]s, books, [[amulet]]s, and others), owned and carried by the faithful, who see them as imbued with spiritual values, and use them for [[votive offering]].&lt;ref name="Cini1961"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hourihane2012"/&gt; Production and sales of devotional articles have become a widespread industry in the vicinity of various religious sites all over the world.&lt;ref name="Cini1961"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Park2002"/&gt;

Devotional articles have a long history; in Christianity they have been mentioned in historical works such as those related to [[Paul the Apostle]]&lt;ref name="Schnabel2010"/&gt; and in older religions they have been traced as far back as the times of [[ancient Egypt]] and [[ancient Mesopotamia]].&lt;ref name="Hourihane2012"/&gt; International law defines "devotional articles" as including "the Bible, the [[Koran]], [[prayer book|prayer]] and [[Liturgical book|service books]], [[hymnal]]s, ritual articles, [[sacramental wine]], [[crucifix]]es and [[rosary|rosaries]]".&lt;ref name="FleckBothe2008"/&gt; Such items may be natural and hardly processed (such as earth from the [[Holy Land]]), but majority of modern devotional articles are mass-produced (strips of paper with prayers, pictures of holy figures, prayer books, etc.)&lt;ref name="Cini1961"/&gt; Such items are usually seen as having little artistic value, as their primary function is not decorative but spiritual.&lt;ref name="Cini1961"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hourihane2012"/&gt;

American sociologist [[Charles H. Lippy]] observed that such articles are "means of access to the [[supernatural]]", and are criticized by some as [[superstition]].&lt;ref name="Lippy1994-89"/&gt; Devotional articles owned by famous religious figures, such as [[Catholic Saints]], commonly become [[religious relics]].&lt;ref name="Sharot2001"/&gt; Widespread popularity of certain devotional articles has, throughout centuries, influenced the public popular image of certain religious symbols, such as [[angel]]s.&lt;ref name="MarshallWalsham2006"/&gt;

The word ''[[Wikt:discursive|discursive]]'' is closely related to the word [[discourse]], which refers to "communication of ideas". In a society there are competing discourses (or narratives) regarding anything and everything such as [[feminism]], [[racism]], [[caste]]ism, [[communalism]], [[Regionalism (politics)|regionalism]], [[economic development]], [[democracy]], [[governance]], etc. These competing discourses struggle for dominance. Ultimately, one of the discourse emerges as dominant. This is known as '''discursive dominance'''.

A dominant discourse is a winning discursive formation. It is the one that survives the widest range of criticisms in various forums and media.

{{see also|Mizrach}}
The '''Eastern Wall''' is an ancient structure in [[Jerusalem]] that is both part of the eastern side of the city [[Walls of Jerusalem|wall of Jerusalem]] and the eastern wall of the ancient [[Temple Mount]].

The Eastern Wall is the oldest of the four visible walls of the Temple Mount; the Northern, [[Western Wall|Western]] and [[Southern Wall]]s date from the period of [[Herod the Great]], who expanded the area of the Temple Mount to the north, west and south.  Older walls on these sides are presumed to survive underground.  The Eastern Wall now visible was built in at least four stages, during the reign of [[Hezekiah]], during the time of [[Zerubbabel]], in the [[Hasmonean]] period and in the [[Herodian]] period.  Repairs and major renovations were made in later periods.  Major renovations to the [[Golden Gate (Jerusalem)|Golden Gate]] were made in the [[Umayyad]] period.

==History of construction==

===First Temple period===

Architectural archaeologist [[Leen Ritmeyer]] identifies specific courses of visible [[ashlars]] located on to the northern and south of the [[Golden Gate (Jerusalem)|Golden Gate]] as Judean Iron Age in style, dating them to the construction of this wall by [[King Hezekiah]].  More such stones are supposed to survive underground.&lt;ref name=RitmeyerMount/&gt;&lt;ref name=ShanksHouse/&gt;  According to [[Hershel Shanks]], "most scholars," think that Ritmeyer is "correct."&lt;ref name=ShanksHouse/&gt;

Ritmeyer has pointed out that the [[Dome of the Rock]] is seated on a square platform atop the Temple Mount, the sides of which, defined by short flights of steps, are square and parallel to the modern walls of the Mount with one exception: the western steps deviate from parallel.  Moreover, the bottom step on the western side of the Dome of the Rock platform is composed of a single line of distinctively large and "beautifully polished" ashlars.&lt;ref name=ShanksHouse&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jerusalem, an Archaeological Biography|first=Hershel|last=Shanks|publisher=Random House|year=1995|pages=47–65|isbn=978-0-679-44526-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Ritmeyer, the measurements given in the [[Mishna]], tractate Middot, "The Temple Mount measured 500 cubits by 500 cubits," can be traced on the modern Temple Mount, with this step the outline of the western side of the square and the Eastern Wall the eastern side.&lt;ref name=ShanksHouse/&gt;  The "precise" measurement of an ancient Judean royal [[cubit]], 20.67 inches, outlines these landmarks area exactly.&lt;ref name=ShanksHouse/&gt; The northern edge of the ancient square was demarcated by [[Charles Warren]], the last archaeologist permitted by the local [[waqf]] to explore the underground areas of the Mount, in his{{clarify |date=July 2017 |reason=word(s) missing?}} the underground structure he labeled as No. 29 in surveys he carried out in the 1860s.  The southern side of the 500 cubit ancient platform square is marked by he the so-called "Straight Joint," a visible bend in the eastern wall.&lt;ref name=ShanksHouse/&gt;&lt;ref name=RitmeyerOriginal&gt;Leen Ritmeyer, “Locating the Original Temple Mount,” BAR, March/April 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ritmeyer proposes that this 500 cubit walled square was constructed by King Hezekiah c. 700 BCE to expand the flat area in which the faithful could gather at the Solomonic-era Temple.  The [[Foundation Stone]] around which is the ancient Jewish Temple was built and which is now sheltered under the Dome of the Rock, is a natural rock outcrop at the highest point of a [[Mount Moriah]]; the natural contour of the land fell away steeply on all sides, although on the eastern side the natural contour formed a flat plateau before falling sharply to the [[Kidron Valley]] along the line where the Eastern Wall stands.&lt;ref name=RitmeyerMount&gt;Leen Ritmeyer, Kathleen Ritmeyer, ''Jerusalem; The Temple Mount,'' Carta, Jerusalem, 2015, {{ISBN|9789652208552}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Straight Joint" where the wall bends very slightly, demarcating the line between the Hezekiahan wall and the Hasmonean extension, is marked by a round column protruding from the wall near the top.&lt;ref name=RitmeyerMount/&gt;

===Hasmonean expansion===

The [[Hasmonean dynasty]] expanded the 500 cubit Temple platform toward the south; distinctively Hasmonean ashlars are visible in the Eastern Wall.&lt;ref name=RitmeyerMount/&gt; The seam between the Hasmonean and Herodian extensions of the wall is visible as a vertical row of ashlars 32 meters north of the southeast corner.&lt;ref name=RitmeyerMount/&gt;

===Herodian expansion===
King Herod expanded the Temple Mount still further toward the south; distinctively Herodian ashlars are visible in the Eastern Wall, in the last  stretch before the southeastern corner.&lt;ref name=RitmeyerMount/&gt;

The magnificent Muslim period Golden Gate (sealed) replaced the ancient Golden Gate. The present gate is understood to have been constructed during the [[Umayyad]] period atop the ancient footings.&lt;ref name=RitmeyerMount/&gt;

==Muslim cemetery==

There is a Muslim cemetery along the southern stretch of the Eastern Wall. A path through the cemetery and parallel to the wall lies atop the ancient city wall, explored by Charles Warren in excavations since covered over, which once lay just outside the Eastern Wall of the Temple Mount.&lt;ref name=RitmeyerMount/&gt;

{{improve|reason=The references (e.g. "Jochen Conzelmann, ''Erläuterungen zur mittelhochdeutschen Grammatik'', Freiburg: Albert-Ludwigs-Universität, 2011." are too imprecise as the page number is missing.|date=October 2017}}
The '''''Eifeler Regel''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʔaɪfəlɐ ˈʁeːɡl̩}}, {{IPA-lb|ˈɑɪ̯fəlɐ ˈʀeːʑəl|lang}}; meaning "Eifel Rule"; in Luxembourgish also spelled '''Äifler Regel''' {{IPA-lb|ˈæːɪ̯flɐ-|}}) is a [[linguistics|linguistic]] phenomenon originally documented in the dialects of the [[Eifel]] region in the far west of [[Germany]] &lt;ref&gt;Kiehl, Johannes. (2001) ''[http://www.qod.de/kiehl/ Regularität und Variabilität der n-Tilgung im Lëtzebuergeschen ("Eifeler Regel"). Ein unüberwachtes, induktives Lernverfahren]''. Magisterarbeit im Fach Computerlinguistik, Universität Trier.&lt;/ref&gt; during the late 19th century. The rule describes a [[Phonology|phonological process]] in the languages which causes the [[Elision|deletion]] of final {{IPA|[n]}} in certain contexts, and may be reflected in spelling.

More generally called n-[[apocope]], it appears to varying extents in all dialects of the Western group of [[High German]], including [[West Central German]] (notably [[Luxembourgish]], [[Colognian language|Colognian]] and [[Hessian dialects|Hessian]]), [[High Franconian]] and [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]]; and excludes all dialects of the Eastern group, such as Austro-Bavarian and the [[East Central German|colonial dialects]] east of the [[Ostsiedlung|Elbe-Saale line]] (including [[Standard German]] and [[Yiddish]]). N-apocope is a [[linguistic change]] originating in speech during the [[Middle High German]] period.&lt;ref&gt;Jochen Conzelmann, ''Erläuterungen zur mittelhochdeutschen Grammatik'', Freiburg: Albert-Ludwigs-Universität, 2011.[http://www.freidok.uni-freiburg.de/volltexte/2075/pdf/Erlaeuterungen_zur_mhd_Grammatik.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

== West Central German ==

=== Luxembourgish ===
The Eifel Rule is pervasive in [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]] and its effects are indicated in the standard orthography. Final ⟨n⟩ or ⟨nn⟩ are often lost when followed by another consonant other than ⟨n⟩, ⟨d⟩, ⟨t⟩, ⟨z⟩ or ⟨h⟩. Compare the following examples involving the definite article ''den'' ("the"):
*'''den''' Apel ("the apple"), '''den''' Tuerm ("the tower"), but '''de''' Ball ("the ball")

Since Luxembourgish orthography strives for phonetic accuracy, the deletion of ''n'' is also reflected in writing. Now, the ''Eifeler Regel'' is presented as a spelling rule, but its correct application still depends on a knowledge of spoken Luxembourgish. The rule targets words ending in ''-n'' or ''-nn'', and since that is an extremely common ending for verbs, plural nouns, and function words (e.g. articles, pronouns, prepositions) in Luxembourgish, its effects are widespread. The basic rule can be described as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Schanen, François &amp; Lulling, Jérôme. (2003). ''[http://www.cpll.lu/ortholuxs_l.html Introduction à l'orthographe luxembourgeoise] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100904045416/http://www.cpll.lu/ortholuxs_l.html |date=4 September 2010 }}''. The text is available in French and Luxembourgish.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Final ''-n(n)'' is deleted before another consonant.
*:(between words) de'''n''' + Ball → de Ball ("the ball"), wa'''nn''' + mer ginn → wa mer ginn ("when we go")
*:(in compound words) Damme'''n''' + Schong → Dammeschong ("women's shoes")
*It is not deleted, however:
**before the consonants ''n'', ''d'', ''t'', ''z'', or ''h''
**:de'''n''' Tuerm ("the tower"), wa'''nn''' hie'''n''' drénkt ("when he drinks")
**:Grompere'''n'''zalot ("potato salad"), fënnefa'''n'''drësseg ("thirty-five")
**before a vowel
**:de'''n''' Apel ("the apple"), wa'''nn''' ech ginn ("when I go")
**:Ouere'''n'''entzündung ("ear infection")
**at the end of a sentence or before a punctuation mark
**:Ech hu'''nn''' (wéi gëschter) vill geschafft. ("I have (like yesterday) done a lot of work.")
*Deletion is optional before the following function words beginning in ''s'': ''säin'', ''si/se/s''', ''sech'', ''seng'', ''sou'' (and perhaps others).

It is important to know that many words ending in ''-n'' or ''-nn'' are '''not''' affected by the ''Eifeler Regel'':
*proper nouns: ''Schuma'''n''''', ''Joha'''nn''''', ''Münche'''n'''''
*loanwords: ''Roma'''n''''', ''Maschi'''n(n)''''', nouns ending in ''-ioun''
*the prefix ''on-'': ''o'''n'''vergiesslech'' ("unforgettable")
*most nouns and adjectives (for historical reasons): ''Mann'' (man), ''dënn'' (thin), ''Kroun'' (crown), ''Loun'' (salary), ''blann'' (blind), ''Reen'' (rain), …
In fact, ''n'' as a stem consonant (as opposed to part of a grammatical ending) is generally stable in content words, with notable exceptions such as ''Wäi(n)'' (wine), ''Stee(n)'' (stone), ''geschwë(nn)'' (soon).

When final ''-n'' is dropped from a plural noun whose singular form also ends in ''-e'' (which occurs mostly in loanwords), a [[diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] must be used to distinguish the plural:
*Chanc'''e''' (singular {{IPA-lb|ˈʃɑ̃ːs|}}), Chanc'''en''' (plural, full form {{IPA-lb|ˈʃɑ̃ːsən|}}), Chanc'''ë''' (plural + Eifel Rule {{IPA-lb|ˈʃɑ̃ːsə|}})

=== Colognian ===
In [[Colognian language|Colognian]], the Eifeler Regel is of lesser impact than further south. This is due in part to slight morphological differences between the [[Moselle Franconian]] languages of the upper Eifel regions ([[High Eifel]] and [[Schneifel]]), and the [[Ripuarian language|Ripuarian]] languages of the [[Voreifel|North- and Vordereifel]] region and the [[Cologne Lowland]], to which Colognian belongs.

There are several ways to write Colognian, and the Eifeler Regel may be reflected in writing when it follows phonetic reality, but more often is not, since the majority of people do not write very phonetically.

In comparison to standard German, Colognian is often described as having historically [[Sandhi|omitted]] the trailing ''n''. This is oversimplified, and not always true, but makes it necessary to note that the Colognian version of [[sandhi|liaison]] sometimes inserts an ''n''. In fact, Colognian multisyllabic base words or lexemes regularly drop "-n" when related languages, such as [[Standard German]] and neighboring dialects to the North such as Low German, Dutch and Limburgish do not.  Liaison is often optional, and there is hardly any liaison on stressed words within a sentence. For example, with the words ''{{lang|ksh|bovve}}'' (up, up there) and ''{{lang|ksh|en}}'' (in, into), one may build the phrase: ''{{lang|ksh|bovve en der Schaaf}}'' (up there into the cupboard) which depending on stress and voice flow inside a complete sentence is spoken as either {{IPA-all|ˈbɔvə ʔen dɐ ˈʃaˑf|}} or {{IPA-all|ˈbɔvən‿en dɐ ˈʃaˑf|}}.

The general rule is that monosyllabic words most often keep their trailing ''n'', while otherwise ''-en'' endings are transformed to ''-e'' in Colognian unless the following word starts with a [[glottal stop]], a [[dental consonant]], a [[vocal]], or an ''h'', and neither of the two words is being stressed inside the sentence.&lt;ref&gt;see page 33, Variable 8, in Christa Bhatt, Markus Lindlar (editors): ''Alles Kölsch. Eine Dokumentation der aktuellen Stadtsprache in Köln.'' Herausgegeben von der ''Akademie för uns kölsche Sproch'' der SK Stiftung Kultur der Stadtsparkasse Köln in Zusammenarbeit mit dem ''Landschaftsverband Rheinland'' - Amt für rheinische Landeskunde, Bonn - 268&amp;nbsp;pages, 4&amp;nbsp;CDs, Bouvier Verlag, Bonn, 1998. {{ISBN|3-416-02847-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are exceptions, the most notable being that speakers do not use ''liaison'' even if they could when speaking very slowly or solemnly, e.g. preaching or praying.

== High Franconian ==
High Franconian is a transitional dialect group between the [[Rhine Franconian dialects]] of West Central German to the North and the [[Swabian German|Swabian dialects]] of Alemannic to the South. The High Franconian group divides into [[South Franconian]] and [[East Franconian]]. N-apocope can be documented in the following sentence from Standard German:
*Die Kinder halte-''n'' die Äpfel fest. "The children hold on to the apples."
The comparison with the above mentioned dialects demonstrates:&lt;ref&gt;Hanna Heidt, ''Erinnerungen an die Vergangenheit'', Schwanen Stutensee-Staffort. Cf. Alfred Klepsch, Fränkische Dialekte, in: Historisches Lexikon Bayerns, 2012.[http://www.historisches-lexikon-bayerns.de/artikel/artikel_45731?pdf=true]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Rhine Franconian: ''Die Kinner'' '''halte''' ''die Äppel fescht''.
*'''South Frankonian''': ''Die Kinner'' '''halte''' ''die Äpfel fescht''.
*'''East Frankonian''': ''Die Kinner'' '''halte die''' ''Äpfel fest''.
*Swabian: ''Die Kinner'' '''haltet''' ''die Äpfel fescht''.

== Alemannic ==
The Eifeler Regel (Alemannic n-[[apocope]]) applies in all variants of [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]] in the same fashion as described for Luxembourgish and is subject to the same exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Auer, "Co-occurrence restrictions between linguistic variables: A case for social dialectology, phonological theory and variation studies", in; Frans Hinskens &amp; Roeland Van Hout (eds), ''Variation, Change and Phonological Theory'', John Benjamins Publishing, 1997, pp. 69-99; Nübling, Damaris &amp; Renate Schrambke, "Silben- versus akzentsprachliche Züge in germanischen Sprachen und im Alemannischen", ''Alemannisch im Sprachvergleich'', Elvira Glaser et al., pp. 281-320, Stuttgart: Steiner Verlag, 2004; Schwarz, Christian &amp; Tobias Streck, "Neue Ansätze zur Beschreibung phonologischen Wandels in den alemannischen Dialekten Südwestdeutschlands: n-Tilgung und Realisierung von mhd. ô", ''Zeitschrift für Dialektologie und Linguistik'' - Beiheft 141, 2010, pp. 203-218.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest report on the phenomenon in Alemannic goes back to 1881.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Weinhold, ''Kleine mittelhochdeutsche Grammatik'', Vienna: Wilhelm Braumüller, 1881, p. 29.[https://archive.org/details/kleinemittelhoc00weingoog]&lt;/ref&gt;

*Certain [[Swiss German]] dialects also exhibit Eifeler Regel. A comparison, in [[Zurich German]], would be:
**"Wötsch '''en''' Äpfe?" remains as "Wötsch '''en''' Äpfe?" ("Do you want an apple?"), but
**"Wötsch '''en''' Gipfeli?" changes to "Wötsch '''e''' Gipfeli?" ("Do you want a croissant?").

== Low Franconian ==

Certain southern and southeastern dialects of [[Low Franconian]] (that is, [[Dutch language|Dutch]]) have a similar phenomenon. It is notable in [[Limburgish language|Limburgish]] and some areas of [[Brabantian]], and is called the "bdht-vowel-rule". Final -n is also deleted in these dialects, except when followed by b, d, h, t or a vowel. This is similar to the Eifeler regel.

[[File:Tom Clancy at Burns Library, Boston College.jpg|thumb|300px|The popular demand for [[Tom Clancy]]'s action novels exceeded his ability to write new books. As a result, his publisher hired ghostwriters to write novels in the Clancy style.]]

A '''ghostwriter''' is hired to write [[literature|literary]] or [[journalism|journalistic]] works, [[Public speaking|speeches]], or other texts that are officially credited to another person as the [[author]]. Celebrities, executives, participants in timely news stories, and political leaders often hire ghostwriters to draft or edit [[autobiography|autobiographies]], [[memoir]]s, magazine articles, or other written material. In music, ghostwriters are often used to write songs, lyrics, and instrumental pieces. Screenplay authors can also use ghostwriters to either [[script doctor|edit or rewrite their scripts]] to improve them. 

Usually, there is a confidentiality clause in the contract between the ghostwriter and the credited author that obligates the former to remain anonymous. Sometimes the ghostwriter  is acknowledged by the author or publisher for his or her writing services, euphemistically called a "researcher" or "research assistant", but often the ghostwriter is not credited.

Ghostwriting (or simply "ghosting") also occurs in other creative fields. Composers have long hired ghostwriters to help them to write musical pieces and songs; [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] is an example of a well-known composer who was paid to ghostwrite music for wealthy patrons. Ghosting also occurs in [[popular music]]. A pop music ghostwriter writes lyrics and a melody in the style of the credited musician. In [[hip hop]] music, the increasing use of ghostwriters by high-profile hip-hop stars has led to controversy.&lt;ref name="bbc.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-28551924|title=The secret ghostwriters of Hip Hop|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the visual arts, it is not uncommon in either [[fine art]] or commercial art such as [[comics]] for a number of assistants to do work on a piece that is credited to a single artist.  However, when credit is established for the writer, the acknowledgement of their contribution is public domain and the writer in question would not be considered a ghostwriter.

==Overview==

A consultant or career-switcher may pay a ghostwriter to write a book on a topic in their professional area, to establish or enhance credibility as an 'expert' in their field. Public officials and [[politicians]] employ "correspondence officers" to respond to the large volume of official [[communication|correspondence]]. A number of papal [[encyclical]]s have been written by ghostwriters. A controversial and scientifically unethical practice is medical ghostwriting, where biotech or pharmaceutical companies pay professional writers to produce papers and then recruit (via a payment or as a perk) other scientists or physicians to attach their names to these articles before they are published in medical or scientific journals. Some university and college students hire ghostwriters from [[essay mill]]s to write entrance essays, term papers, theses, and dissertations. This is largely considered unethical unless the actual ghostwriting work is just light editing.

Ghostwriters are hired for numerous reasons. In many cases, celebrities or public figures do not have the time, discipline, or writing skills to write and research a several-hundred page autobiography or "how-to" book. Even if a celebrity or public figure has the writing skills to pen a short article, they may not know how to structure and edit a several-hundred page book so that it is captivating and well-paced. In other cases, publishers use ghostwriters to increase the number of books that can be published each year under the name of well-known, highly marketable authors, or to quickly release a topical book that ties in with a recent or upcoming newsworthy event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Quien no corre, vuela|url = http://www.zoomnews.es/40446/letras-y-tretas/quien-no-corre-vuela|website = ZoomNews|accessdate = 2015-11-14|language = es-ES|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117015909/http://www.zoomnews.es/40446/letras-y-tretas/quien-no-corre-vuela|archivedate = 2015-11-17|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hrcraad.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The ghostwriter for [[Hillary Clinton]]'s memoirs received a $500,000 fee for collaborating with her.]]

Ghostwriters will often spend from several months to a full year researching, writing, and editing [[nonfiction]] and [[fiction]] works for a client, and they are paid based on a price per hour, per word or per page, with a flat fee, a percentage of the royalties of the sales, or some combination thereof. Some ghostwriters charge for articles "$4 per word and more depending on the complexity" of the article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.certmag.com/read.php?in=344|title=Marketing Yourself via Ghostwriting|work=Certification Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Literary agent]] Madeleine Morel states that the average ghostwriter's advance for work for major book publishers is "between $15,000 and $75,000".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.bookwritinginc.com/blog/what-is-ghostwriting-complete-guide-ghostwriting/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-02-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180213080029/https://www.bookwritinginc.com/blog/what-is-ghostwriting-complete-guide-ghostwriting/ |archive-date=2018-02-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These benchmark prices are mirrored approximately in the film industry by the Writer's Guild, where a Minimum Basic Agreement gives a starting price for the screenplay writer of $37,073 (non-original screenplay, no treatment).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contracts|publisher=[[Writer's Guild of America]]|url=http://www.wga.org/uploadedFiles/writers_resources/contracts/min2014.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150331044042/http://www.wga.org/uploadedFiles/writers_resources/contracts/min2014.pdf|archivedate=2015-03-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the recent shift into the digital age (15–20% world market share of books by 2015) has brought some changes, by opening newer markets that bring their own opportunities for authors and writers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Bain.com|title=Publishing in the digital era|url=http://www.bain.com/Images/BB_Publishing_in_the_digital_era_4_11.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;—especially on the more affordable side of the ghostwriting business. One such market is the shorter book, best represented at the moment by Amazon's Kindle Singles imprint: texts of 30,000 words and under.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2013/sep/05/amazon-kindle-singles-short|title=The big short – why Amazon's Kindle Singles are the future|author=Julian Gough|work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a length would have been much harder to sell before digital reader-technologies became widely available, but is now quite acceptable. Writers on the level of [[Ian McEwan]] have celebrated this recent change, mainly for artistic reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/some-notes-on-the-novella|title=Some Notes on the Novella|author=Ian McEwan|date=29 October 2012|work=The New Yorker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consequence, the shorter format makes a project potentially more affordable for the client/author. Manhattan Literary, a ghostwriting company, states that "book projects on the shorter side, tailored to new markets like the Kindle Singles imprint and others (30,000–42,000 words) start at a cost of $15,000".&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/who-wrote-that-political-memoir-no-who-actually-wrote-it/2014/06/09/8e89ccae-f00a-11e3-9ebc-2ee6f81ed217_story.html|title=Who wrote that political memoir? No, who actually wrote it?|author=Paul Farhi|date=9 June 2014|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manhattanliterary.com/modules/wfchannel/index.php?pagenum=5 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150515065007/http://www.manhattanliterary.com/modules/wfchannel/index.php?pagenum=5 |archivedate=2015-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; And this shorter book appears to be here to stay. It was once financially impractical for publishers to produce such novella-length texts (they would have to charge too much); but this new market is, by 2015, already substantial and has been projected to be a solid part of the future of book publishing.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; So, with its appearance the starting price for the professional book writer has come down by about half, but only if this shorter format makes sense for the client.

On the upper end of the spectrum, with celebrities that can all but guarantee a publisher large sales, the fees can be much higher. In 2001, the ''[[New York Times]]'' stated that the fee that the ghostwriter for [[Hillary Clinton]]'s memoirs will receive is probably about $500,000 of her book's $8 million advance, which "is near the top of flat fees paid to collaborators".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E01E3DF153AF93BA35752C0A9679C8B63 | work=The New York Times | first=David D. | last=Kirkpatrick | title=Media Talk; Mrs. Clinton Seeks Ghostwriter for Memoirs | date=8 January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also the consideration of different benchmarks in different countries. In Canada, The Writers' Union has established a minimum fee schedule for ghostwriting, starting at $40,000 for a 200–300 page book, paid at various stages of the drafting of the book. Research fees are an extra charge on top of this minimum fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.writersunion.ca/content/ghost-writing|title=Ghost Writing|work=writersunion.ca|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120801172621/http://www.writersunion.ca/content/ghost-writing|archivedate=2012-08-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, the average fee for a confidential ghostwriting service is about $100 per page.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} The Editorial Freelancers Association also suggests rates of 26 cents to 50 cents per word, which would be about $15,000 to $30,000 for a 250-page book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-efa.org/res/rates.php|title=EFA: Resources: Editorial Rates|author=Editorial Freelancers Association|work=the-efa.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130119110817/http://www.the-efa.org/res/rates.php|archivedate=2013-01-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent availability also exists, of outsourcing many kinds of jobs, including ghostwriting, to [[Offshoring|offshore]] locations like India, China, and the Philippines where the customer can save money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-19476254|title=The globalisation of work - and people|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Outsource]]d ghostwriters, whose quality levels vary widely, complete 200-page books for fees ranging between $3000 and $5000, or $12–$18 per page. {{citation needed|date=September 2012}} The true tests of credibility—the writer's track record, and samples of his or her craft—become even more important in these instances, when the writer comes from a culture and first language that are entirely different from the client's.

In some cases, ghostwriters are allowed to share credit. For example, a common method is to put the client/author's name on a book cover as the main byline (by ''Author's Name'') and then to put the ghostwriter's name underneath it (as told to ''Ghostwriter's Name''). Sometimes this is done in lieu of pay or in order to decrease the amount of payment to the book ghostwriter for whom the credit has its own intrinsic value. Also, the ghostwriter can be cited as a coauthor of a book, or listed in the movie or film credits when having ghostwritten the script or screenplay for a film production.

For nonfiction books, the ghostwriter may be credited as a "contributor" or a "research assistant". In other cases, the ghostwriter receives no official credit for writing a book or article; in cases where the credited author or the [[publisher]] or both wish to conceal the ghostwriter's role, the ghostwriter may be asked to sign a [[nondisclosure contract]] that legally forbids any mention of the writer's role in a project. Some have made the distinction between 'author' and 'writer,' as ghostwriter Kevin Anderson explains in a ''[[Washington Post]]'' interview: "A ghostwriter is an interpreter and a translator, not an author, which is why our clients deserve full credit for authoring their books."&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt;

==Types==

===Nonfiction===
Ghostwriters are widely used by celebrities and public figures who wish to publish their autobiographies or memoirs. The degree of involvement of the ghostwriter in nonfiction writing projects ranges from minor to substantial. Various sources explain the role of the ghostwriter and how competent writers can get this kind of work. In some cases, a ghostwriter may be called in just to clean up, edit, and polish a rough draft of an autobiography or a "how-to" book. In other cases, the ghostwriter will write an entire book or article based on information, stories, notes, an outline, or interview sessions with the celebrity or public figure. The credited author also indicates to the ghostwriter what type of style, tone, or "voice" they want in the book.

In some cases, such as with some "how-to" books, diet guides, or cookbooks, a book will be entirely written by a ghostwriter, and the celebrity (e.g., a well-known musician or sports star) will be credited as author. Publishing companies use this strategy to increase the marketability of a book by associating it with a celebrity or well-known figure. In several countries before elections, candidates commission ghostwriters to produce autobiographies for them so as to gain visibility and exposure. Two of [[John F. Kennedy]]'s books are almost entirely credited to ghostwriters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2478/did-john-f-kennedy-really-write-profiles-in-courage|title=The Straight Dope: Did John F. Kennedy really write "Profiles in Courage?"|work=straightdope.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donald Trump]]'s famous [[Trump: The Art of the Deal|autobiography]] was produced by a ghostwriter.&lt;ref name="trump"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/25/donald-trumps-ghostwriter-tells-all|title=Donald Trump’s Ghostwriter Tells All|last=Mayer|first=Jane|work=[[The New Yorker]]|date=July 25, 2016|accessdate=July 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of Hillary Clinton's books were also produced by ghost writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/who-wrote-that-political-memoir-no-who-actually-wrote-it/2014/06/09/8e89ccae-f00a-11e3-9ebc-2ee6f81ed217_story.html|title=Who wrote that political memoir? No, who actually wrote it?|work=washingtonpost.com|date=June 9, 2014|accessdate=September 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A consultant or career-switcher may pay to have a book ghostwritten on a topic in their professional area, to establish or enhance their credibility as an 'expert' in their field. For example, a successful salesperson hoping to become a motivational speaker on selling may pay a ghostwriter to write a book on sales techniques. Often this type of book is published by a [[self-publishing press]] (or "[[vanity press]]"), which means that the author is paying to have the book published. This type of book is typically given away to prospective clients as a promotional tool, rather than being sold in bookstores.

===Fiction===
Ghostwriters are employed by fiction publishers for several reasons. In some cases, publishers use ghostwriters to increase the number of books that can be published each year by a well-known, highly marketable author. Ghostwriters are mostly used to pen fiction works for well-known "name" authors in genres such as detective fiction, mysteries, and teen fiction.

Additionally, publishers use ghostwriters to write new books for established series where the 'author' is a [[pseudonym]]. For example, the purported authors of the [[Nancy Drew]] and [[Hardy Boys]] mysteries, "[[Carolyn Keene]]" and "[[Franklin W. Dixon]]", respectively, are actually pseudonyms for a series of ghostwriters who write books in the same style using a template of basic information about the book's characters and their fictional universe (names, dates, speech patterns), and about the tone and style that are expected in the book (for more information, see the articles on [[pseudonym]]s or [[pen names]]). In addition, ghostwriters are often given copies of several of the previous books in the series to help them match the style.

The estate of romance novelist [[V. C. Andrews]] hired ghostwriter [[Andrew Neiderman]] to continue writing novels after her death, under her name and in a similar style to her original works. Many of action writer [[Tom Clancy]]'s books from the [[2000s (decade)|2000s]] bear the names of two people on their covers, with Clancy's name in larger print and the other author's name in smaller print. Various books bearing Clancy's name were written by different authors under the same pseudonym. The first two books in the ''[[Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell]]'' franchise were written by [[Raymond Benson]] under the pseudonym [[David Michaels (author)|David Michaels]].

Sometimes famous authors will ghostwrite for other celebrities as well, such as when [[H. P. Lovecraft]] ghostwrote "Imprisoned with the Pharaohs" (also known as "Under the Pyramids") for [[Harry Houdini]] in ''[[Weird Tales]]'' in the 1920s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

===Religious===
A number of papal [[encyclical]]s have been written by ghostwriters. ''[[Pascendi]]'', for instance, was written by Joseph Lemius (1860–1923), the procurator in Rome of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=015XHt7sAm0C&amp;pg=PA27 |title=Catholicism Contending with Modernity|work=google.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1938, [[Pius XI]] summoned [[United States|American]] [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[John LaFarge, Jr.|John La Farge]], who began to prepare a draft of ''[[Humani generis unitas]]'', which LaFarge and two other Jesuits—Gustav Gundlach and Gustave Desbuquois&lt;ref name="bailey"&gt;Richard G. Bailey. August 2001. "[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3686/is_200108/ai_n8969487 The Hidden Encyclical of Pius XI]." ''Canadian Journal of History''.&lt;/ref&gt;—on in Paris; the draft was approximately 100 pages long.&lt;ref name="chronicle"&gt;The Holocaust Chronicle. 2002. "[http://www.holocaustchronicle.org/StaticPages/112.html 1937: Quiet before the Storm]." p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Another Jesuit translated the draft encyclical into Latin, presenting it to [[Wlodimir Ledóchowski]], then the General of the Society of Jesus who had chosen Gundlach and Desbuquois for the project.&lt;ref name="bailey"/&gt; The draft encyclical was delivered to the Vatican in September 1938.&lt;ref name="bailey"/&gt; [[Sebastian Tromp]], a Dutch Jesuit, a solid [[Thomism|Thomist]] theologian and close to Pope [[Pius XII]], is considered to be the main ghostwriter of ''[[Mystici corporis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandra von Teuffenbach ''Konzilstagebuch Sebastian Tromp SJ mit Erläuterungen and Akten aus der Arbeit der Theologischen Kommission'', 2006, Editrice Pontificia Università Gregoriana {{ISBN|978-88-7839-057-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic===
There are ghostwriting companies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2014/apr/03/academic-proofreading-write-essays-universities-students-ethics|title=Academic ghostwriting: to what extent is it haunting higher education?|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://berliner-ghostwriter.de|title=Ghostwriting in Berlin|work=Berliner Zeitung}}&lt;/ref&gt; and freelancers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/article/article-content/125329/|title=The Shadow Scholar|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; that sell entrance essays, term papers, theses and dissertations to students. Such services are sometimes offered by what is referred to as [[essay mill]]s and frequently transacted through online interfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Cheating-Goes-Global-as-Essay/32817/|title=Cheating Goes Global as Essay Mills Multiply|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being considered unethical and leading to repercussions if detected by universities,&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/11532848/1700-for-a-dissertation-but-whats-the-real-cost-of-plagiarism.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Josie | last=Gurney-Read | title=£1,700 For A Dissertation, But What's The Real Cost Of Plagiarism? | date=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; academic ghostwriting does not represent illegal activity in the United States and United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/09/unemployed-professor-texas-tech_n_1412585.html | work=Huffington Post | title=Unemployed For Years, Professor Turns To Ghostwriting For Students | date=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although academic ghostwriting involves the sale of academic texts that are written on demand, it cannot be equated with [[plagiarism]], since it does not involve an undisclosed appropriation of existing texts. As opposed to cases of [[plagiarism]] that stem from a [[copy-and-paste]] reuse of previous work, essays and assignments that are obtained through ghostwriting services as a rule have the originality of their text confirmed by [[plagiarism detection]] software packages or online services that are widely used by universities.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt;

Universities have developed strategies to combat this type of academic services, which can be associated with [[academic fraud]], that are offered to students and researchers. Some universities allow professors to give students [[oral examination]]s on papers which a professor believes to be 'ghostwritten.’ If the student is unfamiliar with the content of an essay that he or she has submitted, then the student can be charged with [[academic fraud]].

===Medical===
{{Main article|Medical ghostwriter}}
With medical ghostwriting, [[Pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical]] companies pay professional writers to produce papers and then pay other scientists or physicians to attach their names to these papers before they are published in medical or scientific journals. Medical ghostwriting has been criticized by a variety of professional organizations&lt;ref name="wame"&gt;{{cite journal |author=World Association of Medical Editors |year=2005 |title=Ghost writing initiated by commercial companies |journal=[[Journal of General Internal Medicine|J Gen Intern Med]] |volume=20 |issue=6 |pages=549 |doi=10.1111/j.1525-1497.2005.41015.x |pmc=1490135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rennie |first=D. |last2=Flanagin |first2=A. |year=1994 |title=Authorship!

[[medical writing|Professional medical writers]] can write papers without being listed as authors of the paper and without being considered ghostwriters, provided their role is acknowledged. The [[European Medical Writers Association]] have published guidelines which aim to ensure professional medical writers carry out this role in an ethical and responsible manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jacobs |first=A. |last2=Wager |first2=E. |title=European Medical Writers Association (EMWA) guidelines on the role of medical writers in developing peer-reviewed publications |journal=[[Current Medical Research and Opinion|Curr Med Res Opin]] |year=2005 |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=317–321 |doi=10.1185/030079905x25578 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of properly acknowledged medical writers is accepted as legitimate by organisations such as the World Association of Medical Editors&lt;ref name="wame"/&gt; and the ''[[British Medical Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://resources.bmj.com/bmj/authors/article-submission/article-requirements|title=Resources for authors|work=bmj.com|access-date=2008-01-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222214144/http://resources.bmj.com/bmj/authors/article-submission/article-requirements|archive-date=2008-02-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, professional medical writers' expertise in presenting scientific data may be of benefit in producing better quality papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schultz |first=H.

===Website===
{{expand section|date=December 2010}}
Some websites, including [[blogs]], are ghostwritten, because not all authors have the [[information technology]] skills or the time to dedicate to running a website. Nonetheless, the style, tone and content is modeled on that of the credited author. Many website ghostwriters are [[freelance]] but some are [[freelancer]]s who work under [[employment contract|contract]], as with [[radio presenter]]s and [[television presenter]]s.
Occasionally [[Pseudonym#Literary pen names|a "house pseudonym", or collective name]] is used by the author of the website.

Some celebrities, [[Chief executive officer|CEOs]], or public figures set up blog websites—sometimes as a marketing, public relations, or lobbying tool. However, since these individuals are typically too busy to write their blog posts, they hire discreet ghostwriters to post to the blog under the celebrity or CEO's name. As with nonfiction ghostwriting, the blog ghostwriter models their writing style, content and tone on that of the credited author.  This goes for social media as well.  Many public figures have ghostwriters at least partially handle their [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] accounts, among others.&lt;ref name="PC World"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/2048479/whos-actually-writing-your-favorite-celebritys-tweets-.html|title=Who's actually writing your favorite celebrity's tweets?|author=Evan Dashevsky|date=16 December 2013|work=PC World}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===

====Classical music and film scores====
[[File:Martini bologna mozart 1777.jpg|thumb|upright|The Classical era composer [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] was paid to ghostwrite music for wealthy patrons who wished to give the impression that they were gifted composers.]]
[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] is an example of a well-known composer who was paid to ghostwrite music for wealthy patrons. More recently, composers such as the UK-based Patric Standford (born in 1939) have ghostwritten for symphonic recordings and films such as the Rod McKuen Cello Concerto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.impulse-music.co.uk/standford.htm|title=Patric Standford|work=impulse-music.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the film industry, a music ghostwriter is a "person who composes music for another composer but is not credited on the cue sheet or in the final product in any way." The practice is considered one of the "dirty little secrets of the film and television music business" that is considered unethical,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmmusicmag.com/kb/glossary.php|title=Film &amp; TV Music Knowledgebase :: Glossary of Film and TV Music Terms|work=filmmusicmag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has been common since the early stages of the film industry. In the early years of film, [[David Raksin]] worked as music ghostwriter and [[Orchestration|orchestrator]] for [[Charlie Chaplin]]; even though Chaplin was credited as the score writer, he was considered to be a "hummer" (pejorative film industry slang for a person who purports to be a film score composer but who in fact only gives a general idea of the melodies to a ghostwriter).

The practice is also common in television, as composers listed on cue sheets are entitled to music royalties every time an episode or theme score appears on television. A 1998 investigation by ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' revealed that it was especially prevalent among animation companies such as [[Saban Entertainment]], [[DiC Entertainment|DiC]], [[Ruby-Spears Productions]] and [[Hanna-Barbera]], which often listed company executives as musicians for the purpose of royalties.&lt;ref&gt;"Composers say they're paupers in royalty game" - ''The Hollywood Reporter'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Several composers later filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against Saban Entertainment president [[Haim Saban]], for allegedly taking ownership and credit for their musical compositions.

====Popular music====
Musical ghostwriting also occurs in [[popular music]]. When a record company wants to market an inexperienced young singer as a [[singer-songwriter]], or help a veteran bandleader coping with writer's block (or a lack of motivation to finish the next album), an experienced songwriter may be discreetly brought in to help.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} In other cases, a ghostwriter writes lyrics and a melody in the style of the credited musician, with little or no input from the credited musician. A ghostwriter providing this type of service may be thanked, without reference to the service provided, in the album credits, or they may be a true 'ghost', with no acknowledgement in the album.

Legal disputes have arisen hiwhen musical ghostwriters have tried to claim royalties, when an allegedly ghostwritten song becomes a money-making hit. In 1987, Darryl Neudorf was asked to work on a project for [[Nettwerk Productions]] involving a newly signed artist in their repertoire named [[Sarah McLachlan]]. This recording, the album ''[[Touch (Sarah McLachlan album)|Touch]]'', resulted in garnering the interest of [[Arista Records]]. She signed a multi-album contract with them and two of the songs that Neudorf worked on with her became commercial hits in [[Canada]]. In 1991, Neudorf was invited back to work with McLachlan on her second album, ''[[Solace (Sarah McLachlan album)|Solace]]''. In 1993, he filed a lawsuit against McLachlan and her label, [[Nettwerk]], alleging that he had made a significant and uncredited contribution to the songwriting on ''Touch'', and alleging that he wasn't paid properly for work done on ''Solace''. The judge in this suit eventually ruled in McLachlan's favor on the songs; though Neudorf may have contributed to the [[songwriting]], neither regarded each other as joint authors. The judge ruled in Neudorf's favour on the payment issue.

[[File:Chuck D. Slakthuset i Malmö 1991.jpg|thumb|250px|left|upright|[[Chuck D]] of [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]] has offered a more positive view of ghostwriting in hip hop.]]
In [[hip hop music]], the increasing use of ghostwriters by high-profile hip hop stars has led to controversy. Critics view the increasing use of hip hop ghostwriters as the "perversion of hip-hop by commerce." This is because of the limiting definition of "rapping" as "...about you expressing yourself through your own words, not someone else’s."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gelfmagazine.com/archives/hiphops_ghostwriters.php|title=Gelf Magazine Hip-Hop's Ghostwriters|work=gelfmagazine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chuck D]] of [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]] thinks this point of view is mistaken because "...not everyone is equipped to be a lyricist and not everyone is equipped to be a vocalist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Books of Rhymes: The Poetics of Hip Hop|first=Adam|last=Bradley|page=153|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YkGXXDZsFHcC&amp;pg=PA151&amp;lpg=PA151&amp;dq=book+of+rhymes+the+poetics+of+hip+hop+ghostwriter&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TBx9S8aMaM&amp;sig=wUcAYQdgCno2j58a7dBgz-93IT8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=InOiS6qhNMmUtgf34aTuCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CA0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; He points out that creating a rap song may require multiple talents. [[Frank Ocean]] started his career as a ghostwriter for artists such as [[Justin Bieber]], [[Damienn Jones]], [[John Legend]] and [[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]].

{{cquote|The practice of ghostwriting is one of rap's biggest taboos, and yet many of its greatest hits were ghostwritten. So who are Hip Hop's ghostwriters and what place do they have in a style of music built on speaking from the heart? Not all singers are songwriters&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt;}}
Currently in hip-hop, the credit given to ghostwriters varies: "silent pens might sign confidentiality clauses, appear obliquely in the liner notes, or discuss their participation freely." In some cases, liner notes credit individuals for "vocal arrangement", which may be a euphemism for ghostwriting. In the early 2010s, hip-hop ghostwriting services like [[Rap Rebirth]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/07/03/137559845/no-flow-rap-rebirth-can-help|title=Stamberg Raps! And Other Tales From A Hip-Hop Ghostwriter|date=2 July 2011|work=NPR.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; have appeared online, which provide recording artists who wish to purchase ghostwritten rhymes a greater degree of anonymity.

===Visual art===
Ghost-authorship also applies to the visual arts, most commonly paintings. The extent of the master artist's contribution varies widely, as little as composition adjustments and corrective brush strokes, or as much as entire works. A common practice is use of the art instruction class milieu in which the master artist makes significant contributions to the work of the student who then signs that work as his or her own. Services addressing complete works have historically been highly confidential. Less prevalent are advertised commercial services which may use the term "vanity artwork" as suggestive of "vanity publishing".
{{Clear}}

===As blacklisting countermeasure===
In countries where the freedom of speech is not upheld and authors that have somehow displeased the ruling regime are "blacklisted" (i.e. forbidden from having their works published), the blacklisted authors or composers may ghostwrite material for other authors or composers who are in the good graces of the regime.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Some blacklisted communist sympathisers have won [[Academy Awards]], for example:

* [[Carl Foreman]] and [[Michael Wilson (writer)|Michael Wilson]] for ''[[Bridge on the River Kwai]]'' (credited to [[Pierre Boulle]], who wrote [[The Bridge over the River Kwai|the novel]]).
* [[Dalton Trumbo]] for ''[[Roman Holiday]]'' (credited to [[Ian McLellan Hunter]]).

'''Grave robbery''', '''tomb robbing''', or '''tomb raiding''' is the act of uncovering a [[grave (burial)|grave]], [[tomb]] or [[crypt]] to steal matter. It is usually perpetrated to take and profit from valuable [[artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s or [[personal property|personal effects]].{{Refn|group=n|All three long-used terms bear their [[plain meaning rule|plain (natural) meaning]], specifically that robbing and raiding in this context mean stealing. In English, Welsh and Scottish law "to rob"/"robbery" is limited to an intentional fright or attack against a person so as to steal - i.e. some form of [[assault and battery (disambiguation)|assault or battery]]. In more common colloquial use the term "rob" is also used transitively with any type of place meaning to steal from. This means that, internationally, stealing of coffins/urns containing remains, components of these items or taking bodies from their proper, intended final resting place is also caught by the term}} A related act is [[body snatching]], a term denoting the contested or unlawful taking of a body (seldom from a grave), which can be extended to the unlawful taking of organs alone. These acts carry two [[social stigma|stigma]]s from the [[evolution of morality]]: [[selfishness]] and [[psychological trauma]] to which the [[behavioural immune system]] adds the stigma of [[disgust]] to those coming into contact with part-decayed, particularly human, bodies.

Grave robbing has caused great difficulty to the study of [[archaeology]], [[art history]], and [[history]].{{sfnp|Daniel|1950|p=11|ps=}}{{sfnp|Atwood|2004|p=9|ps=}} Countless precious grave sites and tombs have been robbed before scholars were able to examine them. In any way, the archaeological context and the historical and anthropological information are destroyed:

{{quote|Looting obliterates the memory of the ancient world and turns its highest artistic creations into decorations, adornments on a shelf, divorced from historical context and ultimately from all meaning.{{sfnp|Atwood|2004|p=10|ps=}}}}
Grave robbers who are not caught usually sell relatively modern items anonymously and artifacts on the [[black market]]. Those intercepted, in a public justice domain, are inclined to deny their guilt due to the three stigmas mentioned. Though some artifacts may make their way to museums or scholars, the majority end up in private collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.11141/ia.45.5 | issue=45 | title=The Insta-Dead: The rhetoric of the human remains trade on Instagram | year=2017 | journal=Internet Archaeology | last1 = Huffer | first1 = Damien | last2 = University | first2 = Stockholm | last3 = Graham | first3 = Shawn }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on archaeology around the world==

===China===
{{pull quote|Tomb raiding is already a full-fledged industry in China.|source='''Xie Zhensheng'''{{when|date=February 2018}}, honorary president, China Cultural Relics Society}}

Chinese [[jade burial suits]] were believed to be myths for many years until two were discovered in 1968; it is now believed that most jade burial suits were removed long ago by grave robbers.

Grave robbing is still problematic in 21st century China. The increase in technology, such as night vision goggles, air breathing equipment, and metal detectors allows grave robbers to better find and rob ancient gravesites. There are institutions in which you can learn how to rob graves– “for about 200 yuan (about $30) a day. Land surveying skills are first taught, before progressing to probes and shovels, then finally explosives. After 10 days, adepts have the chance to assist an instructor in a real tomb robbery”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fang|first1=Frank|last2=Ong|first2=Larry|title=China Fights Losing Battle Against Tomb Raiders|url=http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/1993683-china-fights-losing-battle-against-tomb-raiders/|publisher=Epoch Times|accessdate=6 August 2016|date=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical antiquity===

[[Ancient Egypt]]ian tombs are one of the most common examples of tomb or grave robbery. Most of the tombs in Egypt's [[Valley of the Kings]] were robbed within one hundred years of their sealing (including the tomb of the famous King [[Tutankhamen]], which was raided at least twice before it was discovered in 1922).{{sfnp|Gardiner|2007|p=147|ps=}} As most of the [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] in these ancient burial sites have been discovered, it is through the conditions of the tombs and presumed articles that are missing in which historians and archaeologists are able to determine whether the tomb has been robbed. Egyptian [[pharaohs]] often kept records of the precious items in their tombs, so an inventory check is presumed for archaeologists.{{sfnp|Gardiner|2007|p=244|ps=}} Oftentimes, warnings would be left by the Pharaohs in the tombs of calamities and curses that would be laid upon any who touched the treasure, or the bodies, which did little to deter grave robbers. There are many examples of grave robbing in the Ancient World outside of Egypt.&lt;ref name="NG 6-2016"&gt;{{cite magazine| last= Mueller| first = Tom| date = June 2016| title= How Tomb Raiders Are Stealing Our History| url  = https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2016/06/looting-ancient-blood-antiquities/| magazine   = National Geographic}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Romans ([[Byzantium]]) also suffered decades of theft and destruction of tombs, crypts, and graves.{{sfnp|Shelton|1998|p=95|ps=}}

=== Europe ===
In Europe, graves are robbed on an accelerating and alarming scale. Many grave robbers works with metal detectors and some of the groups are [[organised crime|organised criminals]], feeding the black market with highly prized archaeological artifacts.&lt;ref name=Spiegel&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/archaeology-in-crisis-bulgaria-plagued-by-grave-robbers-a-524976.html|title=Bulgaria Plagued by 'Grave Robbers'|author=Marion Kraske|publisher=Spiegel Online|date=21 December 2007|accessdate=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Merovingian]] graves in France and Germany and [[Anglo-Saxon]] graves in England contain many metal grave goods, mostly of iron. Grave robbers often leave them, being only interested in gold and silver. Grave contexts, ceramics, iron weapons and skeletons are destroyed.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In [[Eastern Europe]], including [[Southeast Europe]] and the European part of [[Russia]], grave robbers target all kinds of historically important graves, from pre-historic tombs to World War II graves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-latvia-nazi-memorabilia/|title=Rise of the Nazi-Grave Robbers|publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek|date= 23 August 2016|accessdate=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.express.co.uk/expressyourself/344760/Grave-robbing-ghouls-who-trade-in-Nazi-relics|title=Grave robbing ghouls who trade in Nazi relics|publisher=Sunday Express|date=8 September 2012|accessdate=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Spiegel/&gt;

===North America===
Modern grave robbing in North America also involves long-abandoned or forgotten private [[Antebellum Period]] to pre-[[Great Depression]] era grave sites. These sites are often desecrated by grave robbers in search of old, hence valuable, jewelry. Affected sites are typically in rural, forested areas where once-prominent, wealthy landowners and their families were interred. The remote and often undocumented locations of defunct private cemeteries make them particularly susceptible to grave robbery. The practice may be encouraged by default upon the discovery of a previously unknown family cemetery by a new landowner.

One historical incident occurred during the evening of November 7, 1876, when a group of counterfeiters tried to abscond with [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s mortal remains from his grave in [[Springfield, Illinois]], in order to secure the release of their imprisoned leader, counterfeit engraver Benjamin Boyd. However, a secret service agent was present and had notified the police beforehand, so the attempted grave robbers only succeeded in the dislodgment of the lid of his coffin. As a consequence, when reburied, additional security measures prevented further depredations against Lincoln's body {{sfnp|Craughwell|2007|p=|ps=}}&lt;ref&gt;Keith Verinese: "The Adventures of Abraham Lincoln's Corpse:" http://io9.com/S898746/the-adventures-of-abraham-lincolns-corpse{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central America===
Grave robbers often sold stolen [[Aztec]] or [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] goods on the [[black market]] for an extremely high price. The buyers (museum curators, historians, etc.) did not often suffer the repercussions of being in possession of stolen goods and that the blame (and charges) are put upon the lower-class grave robbers. Today's [[antiquities trade]] has become a streamlining industry&amp;nbsp;– and the speed these artifacts enter the market has grown exponentially. Laws have been enacted in these regions, but due to extreme poverty, these grave robbings continue to grow each year.

==Race==

===African Americans===
[[Image:Leonard Medical School graduating class of 1889.JPG|thumb|Leonard Medical School Graduating Class of 1889]]
{{pull quote|Enslaved and free African Americans, immigrants, and the poor were frequently the target of grave robbing.|source='''Edward C. Halperin'''}}

African Americans would often bury their dead in a [[potter's field]]; not having the access or money for a proper funeral. When buried in potter’s fields, the dead were not normally buried very deep. A grave robber could just wait in the distance until everyone left and dig up the body from its shallow grave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of African-American Cemeteries|url=http://www.sciway.net/hist/chicora/gravematters-1.html|website=www.sciway.net|accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the railroad was invented and tracks laid—the sale of African American slaves from the South for dissection began; being sent to medical schools in the northern part of the United States. One Professor of Anatomy in New England reported that, in the 1880s and 1890s, he entered into an arrangement in which he received, twice each semester, a shipment of 12 bodies of southern African Americans. “They came in barrels labeled turpentine and were shipped to a local hardware store that dealt in painting materials”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waite|first1=Frederick C.|title=Grave robbing in New England|date=1945|publisher=Public Library of Fort Wayne and Allen County|accessdate=31 July 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Emancipation Act]], African American Union soldiers that died while serving in the military were dissected by white military surgeons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Savitt|first1=Todd L.|title=Slave Life Insurance in Virginia and North Carolina|journal=The Journal of Southern History|date=November 1977|volume=43|issue=4|pages=583|doi=10.2307/2207007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

State laws in Mississippi and North Carolina were passed in the 19th century which allowed medical schools to use the remains of those at the bottom of society’s hierarchy—the unclaimed bodies of poor persons, residents of alms houses, and those buried in potter’s fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richardson|first1=Ruth|title=Death, Dissection and the Destitute|date=2000|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=9780226712406|edition=2 ed. with a new afterword.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Humphrey|first1=DC|title=Dissection and Discrimination: the Social Origins of Cadavers in America, 1760-1915.|journal=Bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine|date=September 1973|volume=49|issue=9|pages=819–27|pmid=4582559|pmc=1807060}}&lt;/ref&gt; The option to dissect Confederate soldiers was also not available, being that Mississippi and North Carolina legally released the bodies to the families. The North Carolina law also provided that the body of whites never be sent to an African American medical college (such as the Leonard Medical School). These African American Medical schools typically obtained unclaimed Black ‘‘potter’s field bodies’’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moore|first1=Wendy|title=The Knife Man : Blood, Body Snatching, and the Birth of Modern Surgery|date=2005|publisher=Broadway Books|location=New York|isbn=0767916530|edition=1st pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Deterrents ==

=== Geography ===
[[File:Mount Auburn Cemetery terrain.jpg|thumb|Examples of the terrain within [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]]]]
The geography and placement of burial grounds became a deterrent within itself. This is because without the accessibility of the automobile (in the early 19th century), the transportation of bodies was difficult.

A perfect example of this is Mount Auburn Cemetery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mount Auburn Cemetery|url=http://mountauburn.org/|website=mountauburn.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Cambridge Massachusetts. It was the first [[rural cemetery]] inside the United States. The rural location of the cemetery created transportation issues. In addition, the terrain of and around the cemetery was formidable. Further, [[Henry Alexander Scammell Dearborn]], the designer wanted to leave the natural terrain (including ponds and hills) within the cemetery. If someone wanted to rob a grave they would have to maneuver around these obstacles for over large stretches of land, while in the dark. Note that [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]] is over 175 acres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mount Auburn Cemetery--Massachusetts Conservation: A Discover Our Shared Heritage Travel Itinerary|url=https://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/massachusetts_conservation/mount_auburn.html|website=www.nps.gov|accessdate=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other cemeteries, of the time, that were originally built away from populated areas for similar reasons, include: [[Mount Hope Cemetery (Bangor, Maine)|Mount Hope Cemetery]] in Bangor, Maine (1834); [[Laurel Hill Cemetery]] in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (1836); [[Mount Pleasant Cemetery (Taunton, Massachusetts)|Mount Pleasant Cemetery]] in Taunton, Massachusetts (1836); [[Mount Hope Cemetery (Rochester)|Mount Hope Cemetery]] in Rochester, New York (1838); [[Green-Wood Cemetery]] in Brooklyn, New York (1838); and, [[Green Mount Cemetery]] in Baltimore, Maryland (1838).

===Mortsafes===
[[Image:Mortsafe at Logeriat Church1.jpg|thumb|Mortsafes at Logeriat Church in [[Perthshire, Scotland]]]]
A [[mortsafe]] or mort safe was an iron coffin or framework which helped to protect a grave by preventing the body from being dug up and taken away. Mortsafes were specific for the task of preventing bodies from being stolen for purposes of medical dissections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lennox|first1=Suzie|title=Bodysnatchers: Digging Up The Untold Stories of Britain's Resurrection Men|publisher=Pen and Sword History|location=Barnsley, South Yorkshire|isbn=9781473866577|page=39,65}}&lt;/ref&gt; These deterrents, used commonly in Scotland, would be only available for the rich to protect their loved ones, since iron was so expensive. After the body would decompose to a certain extent, the Mortsafe would be removed. These were not a commodity that were sold and bought; rather, they were rented.

===Mort houses===
[[Image:Udny Mort House 02.JPG|thumb|[[Udny Mort House]] in Aberdeenshire, north-east Scotland]]

A mort house or [[dead house]] was used to store bodies until decomposed enough to no longer be targets for grave robbing. Up to 31 recorded mort houses were scattered throughout Scotland and northern England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gorman|first1=Martyn|title=Map Showing the Distribution of Morthouses in Scottish Graveyards|url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/bodysnatchers/morthouses.php|website=www.abdn.ac.uk|publisher=University of Aberdeen|accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually these structures were built within or near cemeteries to make transportation easier. Prior to grave robbers, they were used to store dead bodies in the winter, being that the ground was too cold and in some cases impossible to dig into. An example is the [[Udny Mort House]] built in 1832, Aberdeenshire, north-east Scotland and still standing today.

===Coffin collars===
The coffin collar was an iron collar often fixed to a piece of wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Museums of Scotland - Coffin Collar|url=http://nms.scran.ac.uk/database/record.php?usi=000-190-000-830-C|website=nms.scran.ac.uk|accessdate=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was fixed around the neck of a corpse and then bolted to the bottom of a coffin. Most common reports of these collars being used came from Scotland around the 1820s.

===Family mausoleums===
[[Image:Freeland Grave.png|thumb|The Freeland Mausoleum at [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]] in Cambridge, Massachusetts]]
Historically [[mausoleums]] have been used as a sign of a family’s wealth and a symbol of gentry and nobility in many countries. In the mid and late 19th century in North America, more and more families began to buy mausoleums. The belief was that it would be easier for a Resurrectionist or grave robber to dig up a grave rather than to topple down iron or steel doors guarding the mausoleum. A flaw in the design of the mausoleum was the stained glass or other windows within. Almost every family between the 18th and 19th century had a religious affiliation. As such, many of these families (usually with a Christian affiliation) would put stained glass within the mausoleums. The grave robbers would then just have to smash the glass to break in and to retrieve the body. Making it even easier, around the 1830s families began to fear burying family members. The living relatives would stand guard inside the mausoleum and would sometimes get trapped—only to be discovered upon the death of the next family member [citation needed]. To remedy this, families would put a spare key somewhere within the mausoleum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mausoleum Locks (19th &amp; 20th century)|url=http://www.lockpicking101.com/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=57149|accessdate=30 July 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150326223519/http://www.lockpicking101.com/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=57149|archivedate=26 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and create doors with two way locks. In short, grave robbers could break a window, recover the body, find the key, and walk straight out the front door of the mausoleum.

===Guards/guarding===
One of the most simplistic and low-tech methods to prevent grave robbing were to have an individual guard over the newly buried body. This was done until decomposition of the body was brought to a point where they would no longer be desirable for medical use. If families did not have enough money to hire an individual to watch over the grave for a select number of days, the family would delegate this duty amongst them and close friends. As grave robbing became a lucrative business in the 19th century, a bribe would convince some guards to look the other way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davis|first1=Lauren|title=8 Ways to Keep Body Snatchers from Stealing Your Corpse|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/8-ways-to-keep-body-snatchers-from-stealing-your-corpse-1444488983|accessdate=6 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deception===
Within the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] (completed around 2560 BC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Great Pyramid of Giza: Last Remaining Wonder of the Ancient World|url=http://www.ancient.eu/article/124/|publisher=Ancient History Encyclopedia|accessdate=6 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; an Egyptian deterrent system was built to guard the tomb of [[Pharaoh Khufu]]. This system consists of blocks and grooves to protect the King’s Chamber from tomb robbers. Some experts believe that Pharaoh Khufu’s tomb has actually not been found because of the deterrent system; instead, what had been found by grave robbers were fake rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jarus|first1=Owen|title='Primitive Machine' Within Great Pyramid of Giza Reconstructed|url=http://www.livescience.com/55347-primitive-machine-in-great-pyramid-protected-pharaoh.html|publisher=Live Science|accessdate=6 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the [[Hominoidea]] (apes) superfamily, the [[Hominidae]] [[Family (biology)|family]] diverged from the [[Gibbon|Hylobatidae]] (gibbon) family some 15–20 million years ago; African great apes (subfamily [[Homininae]]) diverged from [[orangutan]]s ([[Ponginae]]) about {{Mya|14}}; the [[Hominini]] tribe (humans, ''Australopithecines'' and other extinct biped genera, and [[chimpanzee]]) parted from the [[Gorillini]] tribe (gorillas) between 8-9 million years ago; and, in turn, the subtribes [[Hominina]] (humans and biped ancestors) and [[Panina]] (chimps) separated 4-7.5 million years ago.&lt;ref name="Max Planck 2012"&gt;{{harvnb|Planck|2012}}

Human evolution from its first separation from the [[chimpanzee-human last common ancestor|last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees]] is characterized by a number of [[morphology (biology)|morphological]], [[human development (biology)|developmental]], [[human physiology|physiological]], and [[Human behavior|behavioral]] changes.
The most significant of these adaptations are bipedalism, increased brain size, lengthened [[ontogeny]] (gestation and infancy), and decreased [[sexual dimorphism]]. The relationship between these changes is the subject of ongoing debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boyd|Silk|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=February 2015}} Other significant morphological changes included the evolution of a [[Thumb#Grips|power and precision grip]], a change first occurring in ''H. erectus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brues|Snow|1965|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=9WemAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 1–39]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bipedalism===
[[Bipedal]]ism is the basic adaptation of the hominid and is considered the main cause behind a suite of skeletal changes shared by all bipedal hominids. The earliest hominin, of presumably primitive bipedalism, is considered to be either ''[[Sahelanthropus]]''&lt;ref name="Brunet2002"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brunet |first1=Michel |authorlink1=Michel Brunet (paleontologist) |last2=Guy |first2=Franck |last3=Pilbeam |first3=David |authorlink3=David Pilbeam |last4=Mackaye |first4=H. |last5=Likius |first5=A. |last6=Ahounta |first6=D. |last7=Beauvilain |first7=A. |last8=Blondel |first8=C. |last9=Bocherens |first9=H. |last10=Boisserie |first10=J. |last11=De Bonis |first11=L. |last12=Coppens |first12=Y. |last13=Dejax |first13=J. |last14=Denys |first14=C. |last15=Duringer |first15=P. |last16=Eisenmann |first16=V. |last17=Fanone |first17=G. |last18=Fronty |first18=P. |last19=Geraads |first19=D. |last20=Lehmann |first20=T. |last21=Lihoreau |first21=F. |last22=Louchart |first22=A. |last23=Mahamat |first23=A. |last24=Merceron |first24=G. |last25=Mouchelin |first25=G. |last26=Otero |first26=O. |last27=Pelaez Campomanes |first27=P. |last28=Ponce De Leon |first28=M. |last29=Rage |first29=J. |last30=Sapanet |first30=M. |last31=Schuster |first31=M. |last32=Sudre |first32=J. |last33=Tassy |first33=P. |last34=Valentin |first34=X. |last35=Vignaud |first35=P. |last36=Viriot |first36=L. |last37=Zazzo |first37=A. |last38=Zollikofer |first38=C. |display-authors=3 |date=July 11, 2002 |title=A new hominid from the Upper Miocene of Chad, Central Africa |journal=Nature |volume=418 |issue=6894 |pages=145–151 |doi=10.1038/nature00879 |issn=0028-0836 |pmid=12110880}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''[[Orrorin]]'', both of which arose some 6 to 7 million years ago. The non-bipedal knuckle-walkers, the gorilla and chimpanzee, diverged from the hominin line over a period covering the same time, so either of ''Sahelanthropus'' or ''Orrorin'' may be our [[Chimpanzee–human last common ancestor|last shared ancestor]]. ''[[Ardipithecus]]'', a full biped, arose somewhat later. {{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

The early bipeds eventually evolved into the australopithecines and still later into the genus ''Homo''. There are several theories of the adaptation value of bipedalism. It is possible that bipedalism was favored because it freed the hands for reaching and carrying food, saved energy during locomotion,&lt;ref name="Kwang Hyun 2015 929–934"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kwang Hyun|first=Ko|date=2015|title=Origins of Bipedalism |journal=Brazilian Archives of Biology and Technology|doi=10.1590/S1516-89132015060399|pmid=|access-date=|volume=58|issue=6|pages=929–934}}&lt;/ref&gt; enabled long distance running and hunting, provided an enhanced field of vision, and helped avoid hyperthermia by reducing the surface area exposed to direct sun; features all advantageous for thriving in the new savanna and woodland environment created as a result of the East African Rift Valley uplift versus the previous closed forest habitat.&lt;ref name="DeSalleTattersall2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kwang Hyun 2015 929–934"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Curry2008 Child of Earth" /&gt; A new study provides support for the hypothesis that walking on two legs, or bipedalism, evolved because it used less energy than quadrupedal knuckle-walking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=July 17, 2007 |title=Study Identifies Energy Efficiency As Reason For Evolution Of Upright Walking |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/07/070716191140.htm |work=[[Science Daily|ScienceDaily]] |location=Rockville, MD |publisher=ScienceDaily, LLC |accessdate=2015-04-09}}

Another change is the shape of the big toe.  Recent studies suggest that Australopithecines still lived part of the time in trees as a result of maintaining a grasping big toe.  This was progressively lost in Habilines.

Anatomically, the evolution of bipedalism has been accompanied by a large number of skeletal changes, not just to the legs and pelvis, but also to the [[Human vertebral column|vertebral column]], feet and ankles, and skull.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Aiello|Dean|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[femur]] evolved into a slightly more angular position to move the center of gravity toward the geometric center of the body. The knee and ankle joints became increasingly robust to better support increased weight. To support the increased weight on each vertebra in the upright position, the human vertebral column became S-shaped and the [[lumbar vertebrae]] became shorter and wider. In the feet the big toe moved into alignment with the other toes to help in forward locomotion. The arms and forearms shortened relative to the legs making it easier to run. The foramen magnum migrated under the skull and more anterior.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kondo|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most significant changes occurred in the pelvic region, where the long downward facing [[ilium (bone)|iliac blade]] was shortened and widened as a requirement for keeping the center of gravity stable while walking;&lt;ref name="Srivastava2009" /&gt; bipedal hominids have a shorter but broader, bowl-like pelvis due to this. A drawback is that the birth canal of bipedal apes is smaller than in knuckle-walking apes, though there has been a widening of it in comparison to that of australopithecine and modern humans, permitting the passage of newborns due to the increase in cranial size but this is limited to the upper portion, since further increase can hinder normal bipedal movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Strickberger|2000|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=feMItLo5gwgC&amp;pg=PA476 475–476]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shortening of the pelvis and smaller birth canal evolved as a requirement for bipedalism and had significant effects on the process of human birth which is much more difficult in modern humans than in other primates. During human birth, because of the variation in size of the pelvic region, the fetal head must be in a transverse position (compared to the mother) during entry into the birth canal and rotate about 90 degrees upon exit.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Trevathan|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Potlqpl-jxgC&amp;pg=PA20 20]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The smaller birth canal became a limiting factor to brain size increases in early humans and prompted a shorter gestation period leading to the relative immaturity of human offspring, who are unable to walk much before 12 months and have greater [[neoteny]], compared to other primates, who are mobile at a much earlier age.&lt;ref name="Curry2008 Child of Earth"&gt;{{harvnb|Curry|2008|pp=106–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increased brain growth after birth and the increased dependency of children on mothers had a big effect upon the female reproductive cycle,&lt;ref&gt;Zuk, Marlene (2014), "Paleofantasy: What Evolution Really Tells Us About Sex, Diet, and How We Live" (W. W. Norton &amp; Company)&lt;/ref&gt;  and the more frequent appearance of [[alloparenting]] in humans when compared with other hominids.&lt;ref&gt;Hrdy, Sarah Blaffer (2011), "Mothers and Others: The Evolutionary Origins of Mutual Understanding" (Harvard Uni Press)&lt;/ref&gt; Delayed human sexual maturity also led to the evolution of [[menopause]] with one explanation providing that elderly women could better pass on their genes by taking care of their daughter's offspring, as compared to having more children of their own.&lt;ref name="Wayman_Sciencenews"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wayman |first=Erin |date=August 19, 2013 |title=Killer whales, grandmas and what men want: Evolutionary biologists consider menopause |url=https://www.sciencenews.org/article/killer-whales-grandmas-and-what-men-want-evolutionary-biologists-consider-menopause |journal=[[Science News]] |issn=0036-8423 |accessdate=2015-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Encephalization===
[[File:Brain size and tooth size in hominins.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|Brain size and tooth size in hominins]]
The human species eventually developed a much larger brain than that of other primates—typically {{convert|1,330|cm3|abbr=on}} in modern humans, nearly three times the size of a chimpanzee or gorilla brain.&lt;ref name="Schoeneman"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schoenemann |first=P.

This evolution continued in ''Homo erectus'' with {{convert|800–1,100|cm3|abbr=on}}, and reached a maximum in Neanderthals with {{convert|1,200–1,900|cm3|abbr=on}}, larger even than modern ''Homo sapiens''. This brain increase manifested during postnatal [[neural development|brain growth]], far exceeding that of other apes ([[heterochrony]]).

The reduced degree of [[sexual dimorphism in humans]] is visible primarily in the reduction of the male [[canine tooth]] relative to other ape species (except gibbons) and reduced brow ridges and general robustness of males. Another important physiological change related to sexuality in humans was the evolution of [[Concealed ovulation|hidden estrus]]. Humans are the only hominoids in which the female is fertile year round and in which no special signals of fertility are produced by the body (such as genital swelling or overt changes in proceptivity during estrus).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tanner|first1=Nancy Makepeace|author2=Tanner|title=On Becoming Human|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_j45AAAAIAAJ|date=981|publisher=CUP Archive|isbn=978-0-521-28028-0|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_j45AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA202 202]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, humans retain a degree of sexual dimorphism in the distribution of body hair and subcutaneous fat, and in the overall size, males being around 15% larger than females.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reno|first=Philip L.|last2=Lovejoy|first2=C.

==History of study==
{{align|right|{{Human timeline}}}}{{align|right|{{Hominins}}}}
{{main|Archaic humans}}

===Before Darwin===
The word ''homo'', the name of the biological genus to which humans belong, is [[Latin]] for "human". It was chosen originally by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in his classification system. The word "human" is from the Latin ''humanus'', the adjectival form of ''homo''. The Latin "homo" derives from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] root *''dhghem'', or "earth".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|American Heritage Dictionaries (editors)|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linnaeus and other scientists of his time also considered the great apes to be the closest relatives of humans based on [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] and [[Anatomy|anatomical]] similarities.

===Darwin===
The possibility of linking humans with earlier apes by descent became clear only after 1859 with the publication of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', in which he argued for the idea of the evolution of new species from earlier ones. Darwin's book did not address the question of human evolution, saying only that "Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Darwin | first = Charles | year = 1859 | title = On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life | edition=  [http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/nytint/docs/charles-darwin-on-the-origin-of-species/original.pdf Full image view] 1st | page = 488 | url = http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=506 | bibcode = 1872Natur...5..318B | volume = 5 | journal = Nature | doi = 10.1038/005318a0 | issue = 121 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first debates about the nature of human evolution arose between [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] and [[Richard Owen]]. Huxley argued for human evolution from apes by illustrating many of the similarities and differences between humans and apes, and did so particularly in his 1863 book ''[[Man's Place in Nature|Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature]]''. However, many of Darwin's early supporters (such as [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] and [[Charles Lyell]]) did not initially agree that the origin of the mental capacities and the moral sensibilities of humans could be explained by [[natural selection]], though this later changed. Darwin applied the theory of evolution and [[sexual selection]] to humans when he published ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|The Descent of Man]]'' in 1871.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First fossils===
A major problem in the 19th century was the lack of [[Transitional fossil|fossil intermediaries]]. Neanderthal remains were discovered in a limestone quarry in 1856, three years before the publication of ''On the Origin of Species'', and Neanderthal fossils had been discovered in Gibraltar even earlier, but it was originally claimed that these were human remains of a creature suffering some kind of illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Montgomery|1988|pp=95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the 1891 discovery by [[Eugène Dubois]] of what is now called ''Homo erectus'' at [[Trinil]], [[Java]], it was only in the 1920s when such fossils were discovered in Africa, that intermediate species began to accumulate.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} In 1925, [[Raymond Dart]] described ''[[Australopithecus africanus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dart |first=Raymond |authorlink=Raymond Dart |date=February 7, 1925 |title=''Australopithecus africanus'': The Man-Ape of South Africa |journal=Nature |volume=115 |issue=2884 |pages=195–199 |doi=10.1038/115195a0 |issn=0028-0836 |bibcode=1925Natur.115..195D }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Type (biology)|type specimen]] was the [[Taung Child]], an australopithecine infant which was discovered in a cave. The child's remains were a remarkably well-preserved tiny skull and an [[endocast]] of the brain.

Although the brain was small (410&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), its shape was rounded, unlike that of chimpanzees and [[gorilla]]s, and more like a modern human brain. Also, the specimen showed short [[canine tooth|canine teeth]], and the position of the [[foramen magnum]] (the hole in the skull where the spine enters) was evidence of [[bipedal]] locomotion. All of these traits convinced Dart that the Taung Child was a bipedal human ancestor, a transitional form between apes and humans.

===The East African fossils—and ''Homo naledi'' in South Africa===
[[File:Fossil hominids.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Fossil]] [[Hominidae|hominid]] evolution display at [[The Museum of Osteology]], [[Oklahoma City]], [[Oklahoma]], [[United States|U.S.]].]]
During the 1960s and 1970s, hundreds of fossils were found in East Africa in the regions of the [[Olduvai Gorge]] and [[Lake Turkana]]. The driving force of these searches was the Leakey family, with [[Louis Leakey]] and his wife [[Mary Leakey]], and later their son [[Richard Leakey|Richard]] and daughter-in-law [[Meave Leakey|Meave]]—all  successful and world-renowned fossil hunters and [[Paleoanthropology|paleoanthropologist]]s. From the fossil beds of Olduvai and Lake Turkana they amassed specimens of the early hominins: the [[australopithecines]] and ''Homo'' species, and even ''Homo erectus''.

These finds cemented Africa as the cradle of humankind. In the late 1970s and the 1980s, [[Ethiopia]] emerged as the new hot spot of [[paleoanthropology]] after [[Lucy (Australopithecus)|"Lucy"]], the most complete fossil member of the species ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]]'', was found in 1974 by [[Donald Johanson]] near [[Hadar, Ethiopia|Hadar]] in the desertic [[Afar Triangle]] region of northern Ethiopia. Although the specimen had a small brain, the pelvis and leg bones were almost identical in function to those of modern humans, showing with certainty that these hominins had walked erect.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johanson|Edey|1981|pp=20–22, 184–185}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucy was classified as a new species, ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]]'', which is thought to be more closely related to the genus ''[[Homo]]'' as a direct ancestor, or as a close relative of an unknown ancestor, than any other known hominid or hominin from this early time range; ''see'' [[Hominidae|terms "hominid" and "hominin"]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Human Lineage | author=Cartmill, Matt |author2=Fred H.

White]] in the 1990s, including ''[[Ardipithecus#Ardipithecus ramidus|Ardipithecus ramidus]]'' and ''[[Ardipithecus#Ardipithecus kadabba|Ardipithecus kadabba]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shreeve |first=Jamie |date=July 2010 |title=The Evolutionary Road |url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2010/07/middle-awash/shreeve-text |journal=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] |issn=0027-9358 |accessdate=2015-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, fossil skeletons of ''[[Homo naledi]]'', an [[extinct species]] of [[Hominini|hominin]] assigned (provisionally) to the [[genus]] ''[[Homo]]'', were found in the [[Rising Star Cave]] system, a site in [[South Africa]]'s [[Cradle of Humankind]] region in [[Gauteng]] province near [[Johannesburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.7554/eLife.09560 | volume=4 | title=Homo naledi, a new species of the genus ''Homo'' from the Dinaledi Chamber, South Africa | journal=eLife | pmid=26354291 | pmc=4559886 | year=2015 | last1 = Berger | first1 = LR | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NGS-20150910" /&gt; {{As of|2015|9}}, fossils of at least fifteen individuals, amounting to 1550 specimens, have been excavated from the cave.&lt;ref name="NGS-20150910"&gt;{{cite web|last=Shreeve |first=Jamie |title=This Face Changes the Human Story.

===The genetic revolution===
[[File:Louis Leakey.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Louis Leakey]] examining skulls from [[Olduvai Gorge]], [[Tanzania]]]]
The genetic revolution in studies of human evolution started when [[Vincent Sarich]] and [[Allan Wilson]] measured the strength of immunological cross-reactions of [[Serum (blood)|blood serum]] [[albumin]] between pairs of creatures, including humans and African apes (chimpanzees and gorillas).&lt;ref name="MolClock"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strength of the reaction could be expressed numerically as an immunological distance, which was in turn proportional to the number of [[amino acid]] differences between homologous proteins in different species. By constructing a calibration curve of the ID of species' pairs with known divergence times in the fossil record, the data could be used as a [[molecular clock]] to estimate the times of divergence of pairs with poorer or unknown fossil records.

In their seminal 1967 paper in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', Sarich and Wilson estimated the divergence time of humans and apes as four to five million years ago,&lt;ref name=MolClock/&gt; at a time when standard interpretations of the fossil record gave this divergence as at least 10 to as much as 30 million years. Subsequent fossil discoveries, notably "Lucy", and reinterpretation of older fossil materials, notably ''[[Sivapithecus|Ramapithecus]]'', showed the younger estimates to be correct and validated the albumin method.

Progress in [[DNA sequencing]], specifically [[mitochondrial DNA]] (mtDNA) and then [[Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup|Y-chromosome DNA]] (Y-DNA) advanced the understanding of human origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|M'charek|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=n-K436zeUY8C&amp;pg=PA96 96]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DeSalleTattersall2008"&gt;{{harvnb|DeSalle|Tattersall|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Bf4Sitw7YaIC&amp;pg=PA146 146]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Trent|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=772BEp8ZyMYC&amp;pg=PA6 6]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Application of the [[molecular clock]] principle revolutionized the study of [[molecular evolution]].

On the basis of a separation from the orangutan between 10 and 20 million years ago, earlier studies of the molecular clock suggested that there were about 76 mutations per generation that were not inherited by human children from their parents; this evidence supported the divergence time between hominins and chimps noted above. However, a 2012 study in Iceland of 78 children and their parents suggests a mutation rate of only 36 mutations per generation; this datum extends the separation between humans and chimps to an earlier period greater than 7 million years ago ([[Year#SI prefix multipliers|Ma]]). Additional research with 226 offspring of wild chimp populations in 8 locations suggests that chimps reproduce at age 26.5 years, on average; which suggests the human divergence from chimps occurred between 7 and 13 million years ago. And these data suggest that ''Ardipithecus'' (4.5 Ma), ''Orrorin'' (6 Ma) and ''Sahelanthropus'' (7 Ma) all may be on the hominid [[Lineage (evolution)|lineage]], and even that the separation may have occurred outside the [[East African Rift]] region.

Furthermore, analysis of the two species' genes in 2006 provides evidence that after human ancestors had started to diverge from chimpanzees, interspecies mating between "proto-human" and "proto-chimps" nonetheless occurred regularly enough to change certain genes in the new [[gene pool]]:
: A new comparison of the human and chimp genomes suggests that after the two lineages separated, they may have begun interbreeding... A principal finding is that the [[X chromosome]]s of humans and chimps appear to have [[genetic divergence|diverged]] about 1.2 million years more recently than the other chromosomes.
The research suggests:
: There were in fact two splits between the human and chimp lineages, with the first being followed by interbreeding between the two populations and then a second split. The suggestion of a hybridization has startled [[paleoanthropology|paleoanthropologists]], who nonetheless are treating the new genetic data seriously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wade |first=Nicholas |authorlink=Nicholas Wade |date=May 18, 2006 |title=Two Splits Between Human and Chimp Lines Suggested |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/18/science/18evolve.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2015-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The quest for the earliest hominin===
In the 1990s, several teams of paleoanthropologists were working throughout Africa looking for evidence of the earliest divergence of the hominin lineage from the great apes. In 1994, Meave Leakey discovered ''[[Australopithecus anamensis]]''. The find was overshadowed by Tim D. White's 1995 discovery of ''Ardipithecus ramidus'', which pushed back the fossil record to {{ma|4.2}}.

In 2000, [[Martin Pickford]] and [[Brigitte Senut]] discovered, in the [[Tugen Hills]] of [[Kenya]], a 6-million-year-old bipedal hominin which they named ''[[Orrorin|Orrorin tugenensis]]''. And in 2001, a team led by [[Michel Brunet (paleontologist)|Michel Brunet]] discovered the skull of ''[[Sahelanthropus|Sahelanthropus tchadensis]]'' which was dated as {{ma|7.2|million years ago}}, and which Brunet argued was a bipedal, and therefore a hominid—that is, a hominin ({{lang|la|{{abbr|cf|confer}}}} Hominidae; [[Hominidae|terms "hominids" and hominins]]).

Anthropologists in the 1980s were divided regarding some details of reproductive barriers and migratory dispersals of the genus ''Homo''. Subsequently, genetics has been used to investigate and resolve these issues. According to the [[Sahara pump theory]] evidence suggests that genus ''Homo'' have migrated out of Africa at least three and possibly four times (e.g. ''Homo erectus'', ''Homo heidelbergensis'' and two or three times for ''Homo sapiens''). Recent evidence suggests these dispersals are closely related to fluctuating periods of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;Peter B.  deMenocal, (2016) "Climate Shocks" (Scientific American Vol 25, No 4)&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent evidence suggests that humans may have left Africa half a million years earlier than previously thought.  A joint Franco-Indian team has found human artifacts in the Siwalk Hills north of New Delhi dating back at least 2.6 million years.  This is earlier than the previous earliest finding of genus ''Homo'' at [[Dmanisi]], in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], dating to 1.85 million years.  Although controversial, tools found at a Chinese cave strengthen the case that  humans used tools as far back as 2.48 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Barras, Colin (2016), "Stone Tools hint humans reached Asia much earlier" (New Scientist 6 February 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;  This suggests that the Asian "Chopper" tool tradition, found in Java and northern China may have left Africa before the appearance of the [[Acheulian]] hand axe.

====Dispersal of modern ''Homo sapiens''====
Up until the genetic evidence became available there were two dominant models for the dispersal of modern humans.  The [[Multiregional Evolution|multiregional hypothesis]] proposed that the genus ''Homo'' contained only a single interconnected population as it does today (not separate species), and that its evolution took place worldwide continuously over the last couple of million years. This model was proposed in 1988 by [[Milford H. Wolpoff]].&lt;ref name="multiregional"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wolpoff |first1=Milford H. |authorlink1=Milford H.

Sequencing mtDNA and Y-DNA sampled from a wide range of indigenous populations revealed ancestral information relating to both male and female genetic heritage, and strengthened the Out of Africa theory and weakened the views of Multiregional Evolutionism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Webster|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=cdiy1EhJVW0C&amp;pg=PA53 53]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aligned in genetic tree differences were interpreted as supportive of a recent single origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ramachandran|Hua Tang|Gutenkunst|Bustamante|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FlfPSpBvKLgC&amp;pg=PA606 606]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analyses have shown a greater diversity of DNA patterns throughout Africa, consistent with the idea that Africa is the ancestral home of [[mitochondrial Eve]] and [[Y-chromosomal Adam]], and that modern human dispersal out of Africa has only occurred over the last 55,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kutty|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=sUqYgipyiGMC&amp;pg=PA40 40]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Out of Africa" has thus gained much support from research using female mitochondrial DNA and the male [[Y chromosome]]. After analysing genealogy trees constructed using 133 types of mtDNA, researchers concluded that all were descended from a female African progenitor, dubbed [[Mitochondrial Eve]]. "Out of Africa" is also supported by the fact that mitochondrial genetic diversity is highest among African populations.&lt;ref name="Cann"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cann |first1=Rebecca L. |authorlink1=Rebecca L.

These new results do not contradict the "out of Africa" model, except in its strictest interpretation, although they make the situation more complex. After recovery from a [[genetic bottleneck]] that could possibly be due to the [[Toba catastrophe theory|Toba supervolcano catastrophe]], a fairly small group left Africa and later briefly interbred on three separate occasions with Neanderthals, probably in the middle-east, on the Eurasian steppe or even in North Africa before their departure. Their still predominantly African descendants spread to populate the world.

There are still differing theories on whether there was a single exodus from Africa or several. A multiple dispersal model involves the Southern Dispersal theory,&lt;ref name="lahr"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.human-evol.cam.ac.uk/Projects/sdispersal/sdispersal.htm |title=Searching for traces of the Southern Dispersal |last1=Lahr |first1=Marta Mirazón |authorlink1=Marta Mirazón Lahr |last2=Petraglia |first2=Mike |last3=Stokes |first3=Stephen |last4=Duller |first4=Geoff |display-authors=3 |website=Leverhulme Centre for Human Evolutionary Studies |publisher=[[University of Cambridge]] |location=Cambridge, UK |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510133600/http://www.human-evol.cam.ac.uk/Projects/sdispersal/sdispersal.htm |archivedate=2012-05-10 |accessdate=2015-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has gained support in recent years from genetic, linguistic and archaeological evidence. In this theory, there was a coastal dispersal of modern humans from the [[Horn of Africa]] crossing the Bab el Mandib to Yemen at a lower sea level around 70,000 years ago. This group helped to populate Southeast Asia and Oceania, explaining the discovery of early human sites in these areas much earlier than those in the [[Levant]].&lt;ref name="lahr" /&gt;  This group seems to have been dependent upon marine resources for their survival.

[[Stephen Oppenheimer]] has proposed a second wave of humans may have later dispersed through the Persian Gulf oases, and the Zagros mountains into the Middle East.  Alternatively it may have come across the [[Sinai Peninsula]] into Asia, from shortly after 50,000 yrs BP, resulting in the bulk of the human populations of Eurasia. It has been suggested that this second group possibly possessed a more sophisticated "big game hunting" tool technology and was less dependent on coastal food sources than the original group. Much of the evidence for the first group's expansion would have been destroyed by the rising sea levels at the end of each [[glacial maximum]].&lt;ref name="lahr" /&gt; The multiple dispersal model is contradicted by studies indicating that the populations of Eurasia and the populations of Southeast Asia and Oceania are all descended from the same mitochondrial DNA L3 [[Lineage (genetic)|lineage]]s, which support a single migration out of Africa that gave rise to all non-African populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Macaulay |first1=Vincent |last2=Hill |first2=Catherine |last3=Achilli |first3=Alessandro |last4=Rengo |first4=Chiara |last5=Clarke |first5=D |last6=Meehan |first6=W |last7=Blackburn |first7=J |last8=Semino |first8=O |last9=Scozzari |first9=R |last10=Cruciani |first10=F |last11=Taha |first11=A |last12=Shaari |first12=N.

Stephen Oppenheimer, on the basis of the early date of Badoshan Iranian Aurignacian, suggests that this second dispersal, may have occurred with a pluvial period about 50,000 years before the present, with modern human big-game hunting cultures spreading up the Zagros Mountains, carrying modern human genomes from Oman, throughout the Persian Gulf, northward into Armenia and Anatolia, with a variant travelling south into Israel and to Cyrenicia.&lt;ref name = oppenheimer&gt;Oppenheimer, Stephen (2012), "Out of Eden: The Peopling of the World" (Robinson; New Ed edition (March 1, 2012))&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence==
The evidence on which scientific accounts of human evolution are based comes from many fields of [[natural science]]. The main source of knowledge about the evolutionary process has traditionally been the fossil record, but since the development of genetics beginning in the 1970s, DNA analysis has come to occupy a place of comparable importance. The studies of ontogeny, [[Phylogenetics|phylogeny]] and especially [[evolutionary developmental biology]] of both vertebrates and invertebrates offer considerable insight into the evolution of all life, including how humans evolved. The specific study of the origin and life of humans is [[anthropology]], particularly paleoanthropology which focuses on the study of human [[prehistory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanford|Allen|Antón|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial divergence occurred sometime between {{Mya|7|13}}, but ongoing hybridization blurred the separation and delayed complete separation during several millions of years. Patterson (2006) dated the final divergence at {{Mya|5|6}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Patterson | first1 = N | last2 = Richter | first2 = DJ | last3 = Gnerre | first3 = S | last4 = Lander | first4 = ES | last5 = Reich | first5 = D | year = 2006 | title = Genetic evidence for complex speciation of humans and chimpanzees | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 441 | issue = 7097| pages = 1103–8 | doi = 10.1038/nature04789 | pmid = 16710306 | bibcode = 2006Natur.441.1103P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic evidence has also been employed to resolve the question of whether there was any [[Archaic human admixture with modern humans|gene flow between early modern humans and Neanderthals]], and to enhance our understanding of the early human migration patterns and splitting dates. By comparing the parts of the genome that are not under natural selection and which therefore accumulate mutations at a fairly steady rate, it is possible to reconstruct a genetic tree incorporating the entire human species since the last shared ancestor.

Each time a certain mutation ([[single-nucleotide polymorphism]]) appears in an individual and is passed on to his or her descendants a haplogroup is formed including all of the descendants of the individual who will also carry that mutation. By comparing mitochondrial DNA which is inherited only from the mother, geneticists have concluded that the last female common ancestor whose genetic marker is found in all modern humans, the so-called mitochondrial Eve, must have lived around 200,000 years ago.

Human evolutionary genetics studies how one [[human genome]] differs from the other, the evolutionary past that gave rise to it, and its current effects. Differences between genomes have [[Anthropology|anthropological]], [[medical]] and [[Forensic science|forensic]] implications and applications. Genetic data can provide important insight into human evolution.

===Evidence from the fossil record===

There is little fossil evidence for the divergence of the gorilla, chimpanzee and hominin lineages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Begun |first=David R. |date=October 2010 |title=Miocene Hominids and the Origins of the African Apes and Humans |journal=Annual Review of Anthropology |volume=39 |pages=67–84 |doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.012809.105047 |issn=0084-6570}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest fossils that have been proposed as members of the hominin lineage are ''Sahelanthropus tchadensis'' dating from {{mya|7}}, ''Orrorin tugenensis'' dating from {{mya|5.7}}, and ''[[Ardipithecus#Ardipithecus kadabba|Ardipithecus kadabba]]'' dating to {{mya|5.6}}. Each of these have been argued to be a [[bipedal]] ancestor of later hominins but, in each case, the claims have been contested. It is also possible that one or more of these species are ancestors of another branch of African apes, or that they represent a shared ancestor between hominins and other apes.

The question then of the relationship between these early fossil species and the hominin lineage is still to be resolved. From these early species, the australopithecines arose around {{mya|4}} and diverged into [[Paranthropus|robust]] (also called ''[[Paranthropus]]'') and [[Australopithecus|gracile]] branches, one of which (possibly ''[[Australopithecus garhi|A. garhi]]'') probably went on to become ancestors of the genus ''Homo''. The australopithecine species that is best represented in the fossil record is ''Australopithecus afarensis'' with more than one hundred fossil individuals represented, found from Northern Ethiopia (such as the famous "Lucy"), to Kenya, and [[South Africa]]. Fossils of robust australopithecines such as ''Au. robustus'' (or alternatively ''[[Paranthropus robustus]]'') and ''Au./P. boisei'' are particularly abundant in South Africa at sites such as [[Kromdraai]] and [[Swartkrans]], and around [[Lake Turkana]] in Kenya.

The earliest member of the genus ''Homo'' is ''Homo habilis'' which evolved around {{Mya|2.8}}.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; ''Homo habilis'' is the first species for which we have positive evidence of the use of stone tools. They developed the [[Oldowan]] lithic technology, named after the Olduvai Gorge in which the first specimens were found. Some scientists consider ''[[Homo rudolfensis]]'', a larger bodied group of fossils with similar morphology to the original ''H. habilis'' fossils, to be a separate species while others consider them to be part of ''H. habilis''—simply representing intraspecies variation, or perhaps even [[sexual dimorphism]]. The brains of these early hominins were about the same size as that of a chimpanzee, and their main adaptation was bipedalism as an adaptation to terrestrial living.

During the next million years, a process of encephalization began and, by the arrival (about {{Mya|1.9}}) of ''Homo erectus'' in the fossil record, cranial capacity had doubled. ''Homo erectus'' were the first of the hominins to emigrate from Africa, and, from {{Mya|1.8|1.3}}, this species spread through Africa, Asia, and Europe. One population of ''H. erectus'', also sometimes classified as a separate species ''Homo ergaster'', remained in Africa and evolved into ''Homo sapiens''. It is believed that these species, ''H. erectus'' and ''H. ergaster'', were the first to use fire and complex tools.

The earliest transitional fossils between ''H. ergaster/erectus'' and archaic ''H. sapiens'' are from Africa, such as ''Homo rhodesiensis'', but seemingly transitional forms were also found at [[Dmanisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. These descendants of African ''H. erectus'' spread through Eurasia from ca. 500,000 years ago evolving into ''H. antecessor'', ''H. heidelbergensis'' and ''H. neanderthalensis''. The earliest fossils of [[anatomically modern humans]] are from the Middle Paleolithic, about 200,000 years ago such as the [[Omo remains]] of Ethiopia; later fossils from [[Skhul and Qafzeh hominids|Es Skhul]] cave in [[Israel]] and Southern Europe begin around 90,000 years ago ({{Mya|0.09}}).

As modern humans spread out from Africa, they encountered other hominins such as ''Homo neanderthalensis'' and the so-called Denisovans, who may have evolved from populations of ''Homo erectus'' that had left Africa around {{mya|2}}. The nature of interaction between early humans and these sister species has been a long-standing source of controversy, the question being whether humans replaced these earlier species or whether they were in fact similar enough to interbreed, in which case these earlier populations may have contributed genetic material to modern humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wood|2009|pp=[https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-1-4020-9980-9_3#page-1 17–27]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-01302012"&gt;{{cite news |last=Mitchell |first=Alanna |date=January 30, 2012 |title=DNA Turning Human Story Into a Tell-All |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/31/science/gains-in-dna-are-speeding-research-into-human-origins.html |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=2012-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This migration out of Africa is estimated to have begun about 70,000 years [[Before Present|BP]] and modern humans subsequently spread globally, replacing earlier hominins either through competition or hybridization. They inhabited Eurasia and Oceania by 40,000 years BP, and the Americas by at least 14,500 years BP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wood |first=Bernard A. |date=December 1996 |title=Human evolution |journal=BioEssays |volume=18 |issue=12 |pages=945–954 |doi=10.1002/bies.950181204 |issn=0265-9247 |pmid=8976151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inter-species breeding===
{{further|Interbreeding between archaic and modern humans}}
The hypothesis of interbreeding, also known as hybridization, admixture or hybrid-origin theory, has been discussed ever since the discovery of Neanderthal remains in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Huxley | first=T. | title=Collected Essays: Volume VII, Man's Place in Nature | year=1890 | chapter=The Aryan Question and Pre-Historic Man | url=http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/CE7/Aryan.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The linear view of human evolution began to be abandoned in the 1970s as different species of humans were discovered that made the linear concept increasingly unlikely.

[[File:Proconsul skeleton reconstitution (University of Zurich).JPG|thumb|Reconstructed tailless ''[[Proconsul (primate)|Proconsul]]'' skeleton]]
In the [[Early Miocene]], about 22 million years ago, the many kinds of [[Arboreal locomotion|arboreally]] adapted primitive catarrhines from East Africa suggest a long history of prior diversification. Fossils at 20 million years ago include fragments attributed to ''[[Victoriapithecus]]'', the earliest Old World monkey. Among the genera thought to be in the ape lineage leading up to 13 million years ago are ''[[Proconsul (primate)|Proconsul]]'', ''[[Rangwapithecus]]'', ''[[Dendropithecus]]'', ''[[Limnopithecus]]'', ''[[Nacholapithecus]]'', ''[[Equatorius]]'', ''[[Nyanzapithecus pickfordi|Nyanzapithecus]]'', ''[[Afropithecus]]'', ''Heliopithecus'', and ''[[Kenyapithecus]]'', all from East Africa.

The presence of other generalized non-cercopithecids of [[Middle Miocene]] from sites far distant—''[[Otavipithecus]]'' from cave deposits in Namibia, and ''[[Pierolapithecus]]'' and ''[[Dryopithecus]]'' from [[France]], [[Spain]] and [[Austria]]—is evidence of a wide diversity of forms across Africa and the Mediterranean basin during the relatively warm and equable climatic regimes of the Early and Middle Miocene. The youngest of the [[Miocene]] hominoids, ''[[Oreopithecus]]'', is from coal beds in [[Italy]] that have been dated to 9 million years ago.

Molecular evidence indicates that the lineage of gibbons (family Hylobatidae) diverged from the line of great apes some 18–12 million years ago, and that of orangutans (subfamily Ponginae) diverged from the other great apes at about 12 million years; there are no fossils that clearly document the ancestry of gibbons, which may have originated in a so-far-unknown South East Asian hominoid population, but fossil proto-orangutans may be represented by ''[[Sivapithecus]]'' from [[India]] and ''[[Griphopithecus]]'' from [[Turkey]], dated to around 10 million years ago.&lt;ref name="Srivastava2009"&gt;{{harvnb|Srivastava|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=kCerOsM8XMwC&amp;pg=PA87 87]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Divergence of the human clade from other great apes===
[[File:Lucy-reconstruction.jpg|thumb|upright|A reconstruction of "[[Lucy (Australopithecus)|Lucy]]", a female ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]]'' on exhibit in the [[National Museum of Natural History]], [[Washington, D.C.]], US.]]
Species close to the last common ancestor of gorillas, chimpanzees and humans may be represented by ''[[Nakalipithecus]]'' fossils found in Kenya and ''[[Ouranopithecus]]'' found in [[Greece]]. Molecular evidence suggests that between 8 and 4 million years ago, first the gorillas, and then the chimpanzees (genus ''Pan'') split off from the line leading to the humans. Human DNA is approximately 98.4% identical to that of chimpanzees when comparing single nucleotide polymorphisms (see [[human evolutionary genetics]]). The fossil record, however, of gorillas and chimpanzees is limited; both poor preservation—rain forest soils tend to be acidic and dissolve bone—and [[sampling bias]] probably contribute to this problem.

Other hominins probably adapted to the drier environments outside the equatorial belt; and there they encountered antelope, hyenas, dogs, pigs, elephants, horses, and others. The equatorial belt contracted after about 8 million years ago, and there is very little fossil evidence for the split—thought to have occurred around that time—of the hominin lineage from the lineages of gorillas and chimpanzees. The earliest fossils argued by some to belong to the human lineage are ''Sahelanthropus tchadensis'' (7 Ma) and ''Orrorin tugenensis'' (6 Ma), followed by ''Ardipithecus'' (5.5–4.4 Ma), with species ''Ar. kadabba'' and ''[[Ar. ramidus]]''.

It has been argued in a study of the life history of ''Ar. ramidus'' that the species provides evidence for a suite of anatomical and behavioral adaptations in very early hominins unlike any species of extant great ape.&lt;ref name="aramidus"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=G. |last2=Henneberg |first2=M. |title=The life history of Ardipithecus ramidus: a heterochronic model of sexual and social maturation |journal=[[Anthropological Review]] |volume=78 |issue=2 |pages=109–132 |date=June 2015 |url= http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/anre.2015.78.issue-2/anre-2015-0009/anre-2015-0009.xml?format=INT |accessdate=2015-07-22 |doi=10.1515/anre-2015-0009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study demonstrated affinities between the skull morphology of ''Ar. ramidus'' and that of infant and juvenile chimpanzees, suggesting the species evolved a juvenalised or [[paedomorphic]] craniofacial morphology via [[heterochrony|heterochronic]] dissociation of growth trajectories. It was also argued that the species provides support for the notion that very early hominins, akin to bonobos (''[[Pan paniscus]]'') the less aggressive species of chimpanzee, may have evolved via the process of [[self-domestication]]. Consequently, arguing against the so-called "chimpanzee referential model"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Sayers, K. |display-authors=etal |title=Human Evolution and the Chimpanzee refernatial Model |journal=[[Annual Review of Anthropology]] |volume=41 |pages=119–138 |doi=10.1146/annurev-anthro-092611-145815|year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  the authors suggest it is no longer tenable to use [[common chimpanzee]] (''Pan troglodytes'') social and mating behaviors in models of early hominin social evolution. When commenting on the absence of aggressive canine morphology in ''Ar. ramidus'' and the implications this has for the evolution of hominin social psychology, they wrote:

{{quote|Of course ''Ar. ramidus''  differs significantly from bonobos, bonobos having retained a functional canine honing complex. However, the fact that ''Ar. ramidus'' shares with bonobos reduced sexual dimorphism, and a more paedomorphic form relative to chimpanzees, suggests that the developmental and social adaptations evident in bonobos may be of assistance in future reconstructions of early hominin social and sexual psychology. In fact the trend towards increased maternal care, female mate selection and self-domestication may have been stronger and more refined in  ''Ar. ramidus'' than what we see in bonobos.{{r|aramidus|page1=128}}}}

The authors argue that many of the basic human adaptations evolved in the ancient forest and woodland ecosystems of late [[Miocene]] and early [[Pliocene]] Africa. Consequently, they argue that humans may not represent evolution from a chimpanzee-like ancestor as has traditionally been supposed. This suggests many modern human adaptations represent [[phylogeny|phylogenetically]] deep traits and that the behavior and morphology of chimpanzees may have evolved subsequent to the split with the common ancestor they share with humans.

===Genus ''Australopithecus''===
{{Main|Australopithecus}}
The genus ''Australopithecus'' evolved in eastern Africa around 4 million years ago before spreading throughout the continent and eventually becoming extinct 2 million years ago. During this time period various forms of australopiths existed, including ''[[Australopithecus anamensis]]'', ''[[Australopithecus afarensis|Au. afarensis]]'', ''[[Australopithecus sediba|Au. sediba]]'', and ''[[Australopithecus africanus|Au. africanus]]''. There is still some debate among academics whether certain African hominid species of this time, such as ''[[Australopithecus robustus|Au. robustus]]'' and ''[[Australopithecus boisei|Au. boisei]]'', constitute members of the same genus; if so, they would be considered to be ''Au. robust australopiths'' whilst the others would be considered ''Au. gracile australopiths''. However, if these species do indeed constitute their own genus, then they may be given their own name, the ''Paranthropus''.

A new proposed species ''[[Australopithecus deyiremeda]]'' is claimed to have been discovered living at the same time period of ''[[Australopithecus afarensis|Au. afarensis]]''.

The brains of these early hominins were about the same size as that of a [[chimpanzee]], although it has been suggested that this was the time in which the human [[SRGAP2]] [[gene]] doubled, producing a more rapid wiring of the frontal cortex. During the next million years a process of rapid [[encephalization]] occurred, and with the arrival of ''[[Homo erectus]]'' and ''[[Homo ergaster]]'' in the [[fossil#Fossil record|fossil record]], cranial capacity had doubled to 850&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Swisher|Curtis|Lewin|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Such an increase in human brain size is equivalent to each generation having 125,000 more [[neuron]]s than their parents.)

===''H. habilis'' and ''H. gautengensis''===
''Homo habilis'' lived from about 2.8&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; to 1.4 Ma. The species evolved in South and East Africa in the [[Piacenzian|Late Pliocene]] or [[Early Pleistocene]], 2.5–2 Ma, when it diverged from the australopithecines. ''Homo habilis'' had smaller molars and larger brains than the australopithecines, and made tools from stone and perhaps animal bones. One of the first known hominins was nicknamed 'handy man' by discoverer [[Louis Leakey]] due to its association with [[stone tool]]s. Some scientists have proposed moving this species out of ''Homo'' and into ''Australopithecus'' due to the morphology of its skeleton being more adapted to [[Arboreal locomotion|living on trees]] rather than to [[bipedalism|moving on two legs]] like ''Homo sapiens''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wood |first1=Bernard |last2=Collard |first2=Mark |year=1999 |title=The changing face of Genus ''Homo'' |journal=Evolutionary Anthropology: Issues, News, and Reviews |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=195–207 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1520-6505(1999)8:6&lt;195::AID-EVAN1&gt;3.0.CO;2-2 |issn=1060-1538}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''H. ergaster'' and ''H. erectus''===
The first fossils of ''Homo erectus'' were discovered by Dutch physician [[Eugene Dubois]] in 1891 on the [[Indonesia]]n island of Java. He originally named the material ''[[Anthropopithecus|Anthropopithecus erectus]]'' (1892-1893, considered at this point as a chimpanzee-like fossil primate) and ''[[Pithecanthropus|Pithecanthropus erectus]]'' (1893-1894, changing his mind as of based on its morphology, which he considered to be intermediate between that of humans and apes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Turner |first=William |authorlink=William Turner Thiselton-Dyer |date=April 1895 |title=On M.

Weidenreich concluded in 1940 that because of their anatomical similarity with modern humans it was necessary to gather all these specimens of Java and China in a single species of the genus ''[[Homo]]'', the species ''[[Homo erectus]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} ''Homo erectus'' lived from about 1.8 Ma to about 70,000 years ago—which would indicate that they were probably wiped out by the Toba catastrophe; however, nearby ''[[Homo floresiensis]]'' survived it. The early phase of ''Homo erectus'', from 1.8 to 1.25 Ma, is considered by some to be a separate species, ''Homo ergaster'', or as ''Homo erectus ergaster'', a subspecies of ''Homo erectus''.

In Africa in the Early Pleistocene, 1.5–1 Ma, some populations of ''Homo habilis'' are thought to have evolved larger brains and to have made more elaborate stone tools; these differences and others are sufficient for anthropologists to classify them as a new species, ''Homo erectus''—in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Spoor |first1=Fred |last2=Wood |first2=Bernard A. |last3=Zonneveld |first3=Frans |date=June 23, 1994 |title=Implications of early hominid labyrinthine morphology for evolution of human bipedal locomotion |journal=Nature |volume=369 |issue=6482 |pages=645–648 |bibcode=1994Natur.369..645S |doi=10.1038/369645a0 |issn=0028-0836 |pmid=8208290}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evolution of locking knees and the movement of the foramen magnum are thought to be likely drivers of the larger population changes.

A famous example of ''Homo erectus'' is [[Peking Man]]; others were found in Asia (notably in Indonesia), Africa, and Europe. Many paleoanthropologists now use the term ''Homo ergaster'' for the non-Asian forms of this group, and reserve ''Homo erectus'' only for those fossils that are found in Asia and meet certain skeletal and dental requirements which differ slightly from ''H. ergaster''.

* In February 2006 a fossil, the [[Gawis cranium]], was found which might possibly be a species intermediate between ''H. erectus'' and ''H. sapiens'' or one of many evolutionary dead ends. The skull from Gawis, Ethiopia, is believed to be 500,000–250,000 years old. Only summary details are known, and the finders have not yet released a peer-reviewed study.

There are a number of clear anatomical differences between [[anatomically modern humans]] (AMH) and Neanderthal populations. Many of these relate to the superior adaptation to cold environments possessed by the Neanderthal populations. Their [[surface to volume ratio]] is an extreme version of that found amongst [[Inuit]] populations, indicating that they were less inclined to lose body heat than were AMH. From brain Endocasts, Neanderthals also had significantly larger brains. This would seem to indicate that the intellectual superiority of AMH populations may be questionable. More recent research by Eiluned Pearce, Chris Stringer, R. I. M. Dunbar, however, have shown important differences in Brain architecture. For example, in both the orbital chamber size and in the size of the [[occipital lobe]], the larger size suggests that the Neanderthal had a better visual acuity than modern humans.  This would give a superior vision in the inferior light conditions found in Glacial Europe.  It also seems that the higher body mass of Neanderthals had a correspondingly larger brain mass required for body care and control.&lt;ref name="dunbar"&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=Eiluned |last1=Pearce|first2= Chris|last2= Stringer|first3= R.

The Neanderthal populations seem to have been physically superior to AMH populations. These differences may have been sufficient to give Neanderthal populations an environmental superiority to AMH populations from 75,000 to 45,000 years BP. With these differences, Neanderthal brains show a smaller area was available for social functioning. Plotting group size possible from endocrainial volume, suggests that AMH populations (minus occipital lobe size), had a [[Dunbars number]] of 144 possible relationships. Neanderthal populations seem to have been limited to about 120 individuals. This would show up in a larger number of possible mates for AMH humans, with increased risks of inbreeding amongst Neanderthal populations. It also suggests that humans had larger trade catchment areas than Neanderthals (confirmed in the distribution of stone tools). With larger populations, social and technological innovations were easier to fix in human populations, which may have all contributed to the fact that modern Homo sapiens replaced the Neanderthal populations by 28,000 BP.&lt;ref name="dunbar"/&gt;

The flow of genes from Neanderthal populations to modern human was not all one way.  Sergi Castellano of the Max Planck Institute for [[Evolutionary Anthropology]] in Leipzig, Germany, has in 2016 reported that while Denisovan and Neanderthal genomes are more related to each other than they are to us, Siberian Neanderthal genomes show similarity to the modern human gene pool, more so than to European Neanderthal populations.  The evidence suggests that the Neanderthal populations interbred with modern humans possibly 100,000 years ago, probably somewhere in the Near East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/nature16544 | volume=530 | issue=7591 | title=Ancient gene flow from early modern humans into Eastern Neanderthals | journal=Nature | pages=429–433 | pmid=26886800 | pmc=4933530 | last1 = Kuhlwilm | first1 = M | last2 = Gronau | first2 = I | last3 = Hubisz | first3 = MJ | last4 = de Filippo | first4 = C | last5 = Prado-Martinez | first5 = J | last6 = Kircher | first6 = M | last7 = Fu | first7 = Q | last8 = Burbano | first8 = HA | last9 = Lalueza-Fox | first9 = C | last10 = de la Rasilla | first10 = M | last11 = Rosas | first11 = A | last12 = Rudan | first12 = P | last13 = Brajkovic | first13 = D | last14 = Kucan | first14 = Ž | last15 = Gušic | first15 = I | last16 = Marques-Bonet | first16 = T | last17 = Andrés | first17 = AM | last18 = Viola | first18 = B | last19 = Pääbo | first19 = S | last20 = Meyer | first20 = M | last21 = Siepel | first21 = A | last22 = Castellano | first22 = S| bibcode = 2016Natur.530..429K | year=2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This, coupled with pathological dwarfism, could have resulted in a significantly diminutive human. The other major attack on ''H. floresiensis'' as a separate species is that it was found with tools only associated with ''H. sapiens''.&lt;ref name=Martin/&gt;

The hypothesis of pathological dwarfism, however, fails to explain [[Homo floresiensis#Additional features|additional anatomical features]] that are unlike those of modern humans (diseased or not) but much like those of ancient members of our genus. Aside from cranial features, these features include the form of bones in the wrist, forearm, shoulder, knees, and feet. Additionally, this hypothesis fails to explain the find of multiple examples of individuals with these same characteristics, indicating they were common to a large population, and not limited to one individual. {{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

This migration and origin theory is usually referred to as the "recent single-origin hypothesis" or "out of Africa" theory.

Bernard Wood noted that ''Paranthropus'' co-existed with the early ''Homo'' species in the area of the "Oldowan Industrial Complex" over roughly the same span of time. Although there is no direct evidence which identifies ''Paranthropus'' as the tool makers, their anatomy lends to indirect evidence of their capabilities in this area. Most paleoanthropologists agree that the early ''Homo'' species were indeed responsible for most of the Oldowan tools found. They argue that when most of the Oldowan tools were found in association with human fossils, ''Homo'' was always present, but ''Paranthropus'' was not.&lt;ref name="Freeman" /&gt;

In 1994, Randall Susman used the anatomy of opposable thumbs as the basis for his argument that both the ''Homo'' and ''Paranthropus'' species were toolmakers. He compared bones and muscles of human and chimpanzee thumbs, finding that humans have 3 muscles which are lacking in chimpanzees. Humans also have thicker metacarpals with broader heads, allowing more precise grasping than the chimpanzee hand can perform. Susman posited that modern anatomy of the human opposable thumb is an evolutionary response to the requirements associated with making and handling tools and that both species were indeed toolmakers.&lt;ref name=Freeman/&gt;

===Stone tools===

[[Stone tool]]s are first attested around 2.6 Million years ago, when hominins in Eastern Africa used so-called core [[Oldowan|tools]], [[chopper (archaeology)|choppers]] made out of round cores that had been split by simple strikes.&lt;ref name="Plummer"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Plummer |first=Thomas |year=2004 |title=Flaked stones and old bones: Biological and cultural evolution at the dawn of technology |journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology |volume=Supplement 39 (''Yearbook of Physical Anthropology'') |pages=118–164 |doi=10.1002/ajpa.20157 |issn=0002-9483 |pmid=15605391}}&lt;/ref&gt; This marks the beginning of the [[Paleolithic]], or Old [[Stone Age]]; its end is taken to be the end of the last [[Last glacial period|Ice Age]], around 10,000 years ago. The Paleolithic is subdivided into the [[Lower Paleolithic]] (Early Stone Age), ending around 350,000–300,000 years ago, the [[Middle Paleolithic]] (Middle Stone Age), until 50,000–30,000 years ago, and the [[Upper Paleolithic]], (Late Stone Age), 50,000-10,000 years ago.

Archaeologists working in the Great Rift Valley in Kenya have discovered the oldest known stone tools in the world. Dated to around 3.3 million years ago, the implements are some 700,000 years older than stone tools from Ethiopia that previously held this distinction.&lt;ref name="Harmand 310–315"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wong |first=Kate |date=April 15, 2015 |title=Archaeologists Take Wrong Turn, Find World's Oldest Stone Tools |url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/2015/04/15/archaeologists-take-wrong-turn-find-worlds-oldest-stone-tools/ |journal=Scientific American |type=Blog |issn=0036-8733 |accessdate=2015-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Balter |first=Michael |date=April 14, 2015 |title=World's oldest stone tools discovered in Kenya |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/africa/2015/04/world-s-oldest-stone-tools-discovered-kenya |journal=Science |type=News |doi=10.1126/science.aab2487 |issn=0036-8075 |accessdate=2015-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Drake |first=Nadia |date=April 16, 2015 |title=Oldest Stone Tools Discovered in Kenya |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/04/150416-oil-fish-hearts-spill-tuna-gulf-bp-deepwater-exxon-alaska/150416-oldest-stone-tools-archaeology-kenya-human-origins-evolution/ |work=National Geographic News |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=National Geographic Society |accessdate=2015-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The period from 700,000–300,000 years ago is also known as the [[Acheulean]], when ''H. ergaster'' (or ''erectus'') made large stone [[hand axe]]s out of [[flint]] and [[quartzite]], at first quite rough (Early Acheulian), later "[[retouch (lithics)|retouched]]" by additional, more-subtle strikes at the sides of the [[lithic flake|flakes]]. After 350,000 BP the more refined so-called [[Levallois technique]] was developed, a series of consecutive strikes, by which scrapers, slicers ("racloirs"), needles, and flattened needles were made.&lt;ref name=Plummer/&gt; Finally, after about 50,000 BP, ever more refined and specialized flint tools were made by the Neanderthals and the immigrant [[Cro-Magnon]]s (knives, blades, skimmers). In this period they also started to make tools out of bone.

==Transition to behavioral modernity==
{{See|Behavioral modernity}}
Until about 50,000–40,000 years ago, the use of stone tools seems to have progressed stepwise. Each phase (''H. habilis'', ''H. ergaster'', ''H. neanderthalensis'') started at a higher level than the previous one, but after each phase started, further development was slow. Currently paleoanthropologists are debating whether these ''Homo'' species possessed some or many of the cultural and behavioral traits associated with modern humans such as language, complex symbolic thinking, technological creativity etc. It seems that they were culturally conservative maintaining simple technologies and foraging patterns over very long periods.

Around 50,000 BP, modern human culture started to evolve more rapidly. The transition to behavioral modernity has been characterized by most as a Eurasian "Great Leap Forward",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Diamond|1999|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as the "Upper Palaeolithic Revolution",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bar-Yosef |first=Ofer |authorlink=Ofer Bar-Yosef |date=October 2002 |title=The Upper Paleolithic Revolution |journal=Annual Review of Anthropology |volume=31 |pages=363–393 |doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.31.040402.085416 |issn=0084-6570}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the sudden appearance of distinctive signs of modern behavior and [[big game hunting]]&lt;ref name="oppenheimer" /&gt; in the archaeological record.

Modern humans started burying their dead, using animal hides to make clothing, hunting with more sophisticated techniques (such as using [[trapping pit]]s or driving animals off cliffs), and engaging in [[cave painting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ambrose |first=Stanley H. |date=March 2, 2001 |title=Paleolithic Technology and Human Evolution |journal=Science |volume=291 |issue=5509 |pages=1748–1753 |bibcode=2001Sci...291.1748A |doi=10.1126/science.1059487 |issn=0036-8075 |pmid=11249821}}&lt;/ref&gt; As human culture advanced, different populations of humans introduced novelty to existing technologies: artifacts such as fish hooks, buttons, and bone needles show signs of variation among different populations of humans, something that had not been seen in human cultures prior to 50,000 BP. Typically, ''H. neanderthalensis'' populations do not vary in their technologies, although the [[Chatelperronian]] assemblages have been found to be Neanderthal innovations produced as a result of exposure to the Homo sapiens [[Aurignacian]] technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mellars | first1 = P | year = 2010 | title = Neanderthal symbolism and ornament manufacture: The bursting of a bubble? | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume =  107| issue = 47| pages =  20147–20148| doi = 10.1073/pnas.1014588107 | pmid=21078972 | pmc=2996706| bibcode =2010PNAS..10720147M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among concrete examples of [[modern human behavior]], anthropologists include specialization of tools, use of jewellery and images (such as cave drawings), organization of living space, rituals (for example, burials with grave gifts), specialized hunting techniques, exploration of less hospitable geographical areas, and [[barter]] trade networks. Debate continues as to whether a "revolution" led to modern humans ("the big bang of human consciousness"), or whether the evolution was more "gradual".&lt;ref name="Mcbrearty_Brooks" /&gt;

==Recent and current human evolution==
{{main|Recent human evolution}}
Evolution has continued in [[anatomically modern human]] populations, which are affected by both natural selection and [[genetic drift]]. Although [[selection pressure]] on some traits, such as resistance to smallpox, has decreased in modern human life, humans are still undergoing natural selection for many other traits. Some of these are due to specific environmental pressures, while others are related to lifestyle changes since the development of agriculture (10,000 years ago), urban civilization (5,000), and [[industrialization]] (250 years ago). It has been argued that human evolution has accelerated since the development of agriculture 10,000 years ago and civilization some 5,000 years ago, resulting, it is claimed, in substantial genetic differences between different current human populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cochran|Harpending|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Particularly conspicuous is variation in superficial characteristics, such as [[Afro-textured hair]], or the recent evolution of [[light skin]] and [[blond]] hair in some populations, which are attributed to differences in climate. Particularly strong selective pressures have resulted in [[high-altitude adaptation in humans]], with different ones in different isolated populations. Studies of the [[High-altitude adaptation in humans#Genetic basis|genetic basis]] show that some developed very recently, with Tibetans evolving over 3,000 years to have high proportions of an allele of [[EPAS1]] that is adaptive to high altitudes.

Other evolution is related to [[endemic disease]]s: the presence of [[malaria]] selected for [[sickle cell trait]] (the [[heterozygote]] form of sickle cell gene), while the absence of malaria and the health effects of [[sickle-cell anemia]] select against this trait. For example, the population at risk of the severe debilitating disease [[kuru (disease)|kuru]] has significant over-representation of an immune variant of the [[PRNP|prion protein]] gene G127V versus non-immune alleles. The frequency of this [[Mutation|genetic variant]] is due to the survival of immune persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Medical Research Council (UK) |authorlink=Medical Research Council (United Kingdom) |date=November 21, 2009 |title=Brain Disease 'Resistance Gene' evolves in Papua New Guinea community; could offer insights Into CJD |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/11/091120091959.htm |work=ScienceDaily |location=Rockville, MD |publisher=ScienceDaily, LLC |accessdate=2009-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa0809716| pmid = 19923577| year = 2009| last1 = Mead | first1 = S.| last2 = Whitfield | first2 = J.| last3 = Poulter | first3 = M.| last4 = Shah | first4 = P.| last5 = Uphill | first5 = J.| last6 = Campbell | first6 = T.| last7 = Al-Dujaily | first7 = H.| last8 = Hummerich | first8 = H.| last9 = Beck | first9 = J.| last10 = Mein | first10 = C.

Recent human evolution related to agriculture includes genetic resistance to infectious disease that has appeared in human populations by crossing the species barrier from domesticated animals,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Diamond|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as changes in metabolism due to changes in diet, such as [[lactase persistence]].

In contemporary times, since industrialization, some trends have been observed: for instance, menopause is evolving to occur later.&lt;ref name="doi10.1073/pnas.0906199106"/&gt; Other reported trends appear to include lengthening of the human reproductive period and reduction in cholesterol levels, blood glucose and blood pressure in some populations.&lt;ref name="doi10.1073/pnas.0906199106"&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = S.

{{Islam}}
'''Sin''' is an important concept in [[Islamic ethics]]. [[Muslim]]s see [[sin]] as anything that goes against the commands of [[Allah]] ([[God in Islam|God]]), a breach of the laws and norms laid down by religion.&lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies"&gt;{{cite web|title=Oxford Islamic Studies Online|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e2211|work=Sin|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Islam]] teaches that sin is an act and not a state of being. It is believed that Allah weighs an individual’s good deeds and against his or her sins on the Day of Judgement and punishes those individuals whose evil deeds outweigh their good deeds. These individuals are thought to be sentenced to afterlife in the fires of جهنم [[jahannam]] (Hell).

The Quran describes these sins throughout the text and demonstrates that some sins are more punishable than others. A clear distinction is made between major and minor sins (53:31–32), indicating that if an individual stays away from the major sins, then he/she will be forgiven of the minor sins.&lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies" /&gt;{{Notinsource|date=January 2017}} Regardless, Islam teaches that God is merciful and individuals can be forgiven of their sins if they repent.&lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies" /&gt;{{Notinsource|date=January 2017}}

Sources differ on the exact meanings of the different terms for sin used in the Islamic tradition.

== Terminology ==

A number of different words for sin are used in the Islamic tradition.

According to A.J. Wensinck's entry in the [[Encyclopedia of Islam]], Islamic terms for sin include ''dhanb'' and ''khaṭīʾa'', which are synonymous and refer to intentional sins; ''khiṭʾ'', which means simply a sin; and ''ithm'', which is used for grave sins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Wensinck, A. J. | year= 2012 | title=K̲h̲aṭīʾa |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam| edition=2nd|publisher=Brill |editors=P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1163/2214-871X_ei1_SIM_4141|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Cyril Glasse, Islam recognizes two kinds of sin (''khati'ah''): ''dhanb'', a fault or shortcoming which is to be sanctioned; and ''ithm'', a willful transgression which is to be punished.&lt;ref name=glasse-431&gt;{{cite book|last=Glasse|first=Cyril|title=The New Encyclopedia of Islam|publisher=Altamira|page=431|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=focLrox-frUC&amp;pg=PA431 |quote=In Islam sin is divided into two categories. The first is that of ''dhanb'', which is a fault or shortcoming, a limitation, an inadvertencies, the consequence of which is a sanction rather than a punishment. Sin as ''dhanb'' is distinguished from willful transgression (''ithm''), which is more serious and clearly incurs punishment rather than sanction. ... The term ''khati'ah'' is used in practice indiscriminately for both concepts of sin. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Semantic analysis of terminology in the Qur'an==

Several different words are used in the Quran to describe sin—1) ''Dhanb'' 2) ''Ithm'' 3) ''Khati’ah'' 4) ''Jurm'' 5) ''Junah/Haraj''. By examining the choice of words in Quranic verses used in connection with these terms, scholars have attempted to determine which sins are associated with which terms.&lt;ref name="ItuzsuToshiko"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ituzsu|first=Toshiko|title=Ethico-Religious Concepts in the Qur'an|year=1966|publisher=McGill University Press|location=Montreal|pages=193–249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dhanb===

''Dhanb'' (plural ''dhunub'') is frequently applied to heinous sins committed against God. One of the main examples of ''Dhanb'' in the Quran is of “crying lies of God’s signs”, or having excessive pride that prevents an individual from believing the signs of God.&lt;ref name="ItuzsuToshiko"/&gt;

{{quote|For in God's sight are (all) his servants, (namely), those who say: 'Our Lord, we have indeed believed: forgive us, then, our sins ("dhunub"), and save us from the agony of the Fire.' | Quran 3: 15–16&lt;ref name="AliAdbullah"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ali|first=Adbullah Yusuf|title=The Holy Qur'an|pages=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

This use of ''dhanb'' in the Quran exemplifies that this type of sin is punishable in the afterlife. In fact, ''dhanb'' is considered a ‘great’ sin and is often used in the Quran to contrast with ''sayyi’a'', which denotes a ‘smaller’ sin.&lt;ref name="ItuzsuToshiko" /&gt; The Quran states that if you avoid these great sins, your lesser evil deeds or sayyi’at will be forgiven.

{{quote| If you avoid great sins (kaba’ir or dhanb) which are forbidden you, We will remit from you your evil deeds (sayyi’a). | Quran 4: 31 &lt;ref name="ItuzsuToshiko" /&gt; }}

=== Ithm===

Some scholars believe the basic meaning of ''ithm'' to be an unlawful deed that is committed intentionally. This contrasts to ''dhanb'' in that ''dhanb'' can be both intentional and unintentional. However, this definition is somewhat nebulous and the best description of the word is based on the contextual situations.&lt;ref name="ItuzsuToshiko" /&gt; In the Quran, i''thm'' is found quite frequently in legislative descriptions. For example, falsely accusing your own wife in order to gain money is constituted as an ''ithm'' (Quran 4: 24/20). However, ''ithm'' is also used in connection with ''haram'', or committing an unlawful deed, a taboo, such as consuming food or drink that is forbidden by God:

{{quote|They will ask thee about wine and [[maisir|maysir]]. Say, ‘In both of them there is great sin (ithm) and also some uses for men, but their sin is greater than their usefulness.’| Quran 2: 168/173&lt;ref name="ItuzsuToshiko" /&gt; }}

''Ithm'' is also associated with what is considered the worst sin of all, ''shirk''.&lt;ref name="ItuzsuToshiko" /&gt; ''Shirk'' signifies the accepting of a presence of other divinities at the side of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brill Encyclopedia of Islam|year=1997|publisher=Leiden Brill|pages=484–486}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Quran states that:

{{quote|He who associates with God has surely forged a great sin (''ithm'').| Quran 4: 53/50 &lt;ref name="ItuzsuToshiko" /&gt;}}

This association with ''shirk'' is noteworthy for ''shirk'' is considered unforgivable if not repented of.

{{quote|God forgiveth not (the sin of) joining other gods to Him; but He forgiveth whom He pleaseth other sins that this: one who joins other gods with God hath strayed far, far away. | Quran 4:116&lt;ref name="AliAdbullah" /&gt;}}

=== Khati’ah===

''Khati’ah'' is considered by many scholars to be a “moral lapse” or a “mistake” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brill Encyclopedia of Islam|year=1997|publisher=Leiden Brill|pages=1106–09}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{nonspecific|need volume or entry to verify|date=July 2017}} This interpretation has led some scholars to believe that ''Khati’ah'' is a lesser sin than ithm; however, the word ''Khati’ah'' is frequently used in conjunction with ''ithm'' in the Quran.&lt;ref name="ItuzsuToshiko"/&gt;

{{quote| Whoso, having committed a ''khati’ah'' or an ''ithm'', throws it upon the innocent, has burdened himself with calumny and an obvious sin (''ithm''). | Quran 4:112&lt;ref name="ItuzsuToshiko" /&gt;}}

This Quranic verse indicates that ''khati’ah'' is considered an ''ithm'', a grave sin. In fact, the word ''khati’ah'' is associated with some of the most heinous religious sins in the Quran.&lt;ref name="ItuzsuToshiko" /&gt; In one Quranic verse this word is used to describe the sin of slaying one’s own children for fear of poverty. (Quran 17:33/31). Scholars believe that ''dhanb'' or ''ithm'' could be used in place of ''khati’ah'' in this instance;&lt;ref name="ItuzsuToshiko" /&gt; however, the word choice indicates that ''khati’ah'' is more than just a moral lapse or mistake and is punishable.

=== Jurm===

The word ''Jurum'' is often considered to be a synonym of '''''dhanb''''' for it is used to describe some of the same sins: crying lies of God and not believing the signs of God.&lt;ref name="ItuzsuToshiko" /&gt; In the Quran, the word mostly appears in the form of ''mujrim'', one who commits a ''jurm''. These individuals are described in the Quran as having arrogance towards the believers.

{{quote| Behold, those who commit jurm used to laugh at those who believed, winking one at another when they passed them by, and when they went back to their own fold, they returned jesting, and when they saw them they used to say, ‘Lo, these have indeed gone astray! | Quran 83: 29–32&lt;ref name="ItuzsuToshiko" /&gt;}}

=== Junah/Haraj===

''Junah'' and ''Haraj'' have a similar meaning to that of ''ithm'', a sin that warrants a punishment. In fact, these words are used almost interchangeably with ''ithm'' in the same chapters in the Quran. Like ''ithm'', these words are found frequently in legislative portions of the Quran, particularly relating to regulations regarding marriage and divorce.&lt;ref name="ItuzsuToshiko" /&gt;

{{quote|It is no sin (''junah'') for you that you offer proposal of marriage to women or keep it secret. | Quran 2:235&lt;ref name="ItuzsuToshiko" /&gt;}}

==Definition in Hadith==
Sin is discussed extensively in the [[hadith]], (the collection of [[Muhammad]]'s sayings). It is reported by An-Nawwas bin Sam'an: 
{{quote|"The Prophet (Muhammad) said, "Piety is good manner,and sin is that which creates doubt and you do not like people to know it.""|{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|32|6195}},{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|32|6196}}}}

Wabisah bin Ma’bad reported: 
{{quote|“I went to Messenger of Allah (SAWS) and he asked me: “Have you come to inquire about piety?” I replied in the affirmative. Then he said: “Ask your heart regarding it. Piety is that which contents the soul and comforts the heart, and sin is that which causes doubts and perturbs the heart, even if people pronounce it lawful and give you verdicts on such matters again and again.”|Ahmad and Ad-Darmi&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sunnah.com/nawawi40/27 | title=40 Hadith: Nawawi: 27, English translation: Hadith 27 | publisher=sunnah.com | accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[Sunan al-Tirmidhi]], a Hadith is narrated:
{{Quote|Allah's apostle said, "Every son of Adam sins, the best of the sinners are those who repent."|Sunan al-Tirmidhi,Hadith no. 2499}}

In [[Sahih Muslim]], [[Abu Ayyub al-Ansari]] and [[Abu Huraira]] narrated:
{{Quote|Allah's apostle said," By Him in Whose Hand is my life, if you were not to commit sin, Allah would sweep you out of existence and He would replace (you by) those people who would commit sin and seek forgiveness from Allah, and He would have pardoned them."|{{Hadith-usc|muslim|usc=yes|37|6621}}}}

==Consequences of some sins==
{{List|section|date=January 2018}}
There are some sins which its ill-consequences were stated in the Qur'an and hadith, we shall quote some of them here: 
*Imam al-Baqir, quoted the Holy Prophet been stated seven consequences for different sins as thus:  
#"When adultery appears (abundantly in a society) the (number of) sudden deaths increases; 
#when there is fraud, Allah takes them in expensiveness and loss. When people stop giving alms tax, the earth holds back its blessings from plants (crops), fruits, mines, and all such things. 
#When they act unjustly according to (divine) ordinances, they have helped injustice and aggression. 
#When they breach (their) promises, the Lord will set their enemies as absolute masters over them.
#When they break off connections with their kindred, possession of properties will be put in the hands of the wicked. And, 
#When they do not perform enjoining right and forbidding wrong and, also, do not follow the chosen ones of my Ahlul Bayt, Allah will set their vicious ones over them and, in this condition, their good doers utter invocations but they are not responded to."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Laleh Bakhtiar|title= A Glance at the life of the holy Prophet of Islam |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XAb6ZH5xjH8C&amp;pg=PA88 |year=1983|publisher= Islamic Propagation Organisation}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The holy Qur'an,chapter 4 verse 10 said in this regard as thus: “(As for) those who swallow the property of the orphans unjustly, surely they only swallow fire into their bellies and they shall enter burning fire.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Khwajah Kamal al-Din |title= The Islamic review,vol.17 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XAb6ZH5xjH8C&amp;pg=PA88 |year=1929|publisher= The University of Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Concealing part of the holy book is among the sin which its consequences were stated in the Qur'an;as it was said in Qur'an 2:174-175:“Surely those who conceal any part of the Book that Allah has revealed and take for it a small price, they eat nothing but fire into their bellies, and Allah will not speak to them on the day of resurrection, nor will He purify them, and they shall have a painful chastisement. These are they who buy error for the right direction and chastisement for forgiveness ; how bold they are to encounter fire!” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Maulana Muhammad Ali|title= English translation of the holy Quran with Explanatory notes|url=&lt;!-- https://books.google.com/books?id=XAb6ZH5xjH8C&amp;pg=PA88 --a different book--&gt;|year=|publisher= Amazon.com|isbn=1906109079}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Imam Zaynol Aabideen stated some sins ant their consequences as thus:
#“The sins that remove blessings are: oppressing people, giving up doing good and favor, being ungrateful for blessings and giving up thanking Allah.
#The sins that cause regret are: killing innocent ones, breaking off relations with the kin until they feel in no need of each other, not offering prayer until its time elapses, being inadvertent to wills and to wronged people, not giving zakat until death comes. 
#The sins that bring calamities are: disobedience of a knowing one by oppressing people, being rude to them and mocking them.
#The sins that keep blessings away are: pretending poverty, sleeping until after dawn and until the time of Fajr Prayer elapses, scorning blessings and complaining against Allah the Almighty." &lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite book|author=Allama Hussayn Ansariyan|title= Repentance; The Cradle of mercy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XAb6ZH5xjH8C&amp;pg=PA88 |year=|publisher= Ansariyan, Qom|isbn=9789644385858}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Also he stated: 
#"The sins that disgrace honors are: drinking wine, gambling, joking and talking nonsense, mentioning the defects of people and accompanying sinful and bad people.
#The sins that bring calamities are: refraining from helping needy people, refraining from supporting oppressed people, not enjoining what is right and not forbidding what is wrong.  
#The sins that cause the enemies to prevail are: doing injustice openly, spreading debauchery, violating prohibited matters, disobeying good people and submitting to evil people. 
#The sins that hasten perishment are: cutting communications with one’s kin, false oath, lying, adultery, blocking the ways of the Muslims and pretending to be an Imam falsely.
#The sins that dispel hope are: being desperate of the mercy of Allah, relying on other than Allah and disbelieving in the Promise of Allah. 
#The sins that darken the space are: magic, divination, believing in stars, disbelieving in fate and being undutiful to one’s parents. #The sins that uncover the curtain (of the unseen) are: borrowing with no intention of repaying, exceeding in spending on impermissible things, being stingy with one’s family, children and relatives, impoliteness, impatience, laziness and making little of religious people." &lt;ref name= "book" /&gt; 
*The follows are some other sins with their consequences : 
#"The sins that reject supplication are: malevolence, ill-intention, hypocrisy with brothers, disbelieving in responding to supplication, delaying obligatory prayers until their prescribed times elapse, giving up approaching Allah via doing good and paying charities, and using bad and obscene sayings. 
#The sins that prevent the rain of the heaven are: the injustice of rulers in judgments, perjury, concealing true witnesses, preventing zakat, preventing loan and helping the needy, hard-Heartedness towards the poor and the needy, being unjust to orphans and widows, chiding the beggars them.”  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= (Edited by) John Andrew Morrrow |title= Islamic Images and Ideas,Essays on Sacred Symbolism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XAb6ZH5xjH8C&amp;pg=PA88 |year=2013|publisher= Amazon|isbn=1476612889}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repentance of sin==
{{See also|Repentance in Islam}} 
According to Islam, one can be forgiven of sins through genuine ''[[tawbah]]'' (repentance) which literally means "to return."

{{quote|Ask your Lord for forgiveness, then turn back to Him.| Qur'an, sura 11, ayat 3&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|11|3|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Unlike the Catholic concept of atonement, ''[[tawbah]]'' does not entail formal, [[ecclesiastical|eccelesiastica]]l confession to a religious leader.&lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies_a"&gt;{{cite web|title=Oxford Islamic Studies Online|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/|work=Repentance|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Protestantism, Islam allows followers to repent directly to God. In addition, while Christianity and Islam considers humans as prone to sin, Islam ultimately views them as responsible for their actions and refutes the Christian concept of original sin.

{{quote|For man's very soul incites him to evil unless my Lord shows mercy.| Qur'an, sura 12, ayat 53&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|12|53|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

More so, in Islam Muslims are discouraged from confessing their sins and sharing the wrongdoings of others.
&lt;ref name="hidesins_a"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sins: to hide or to make public|url=http://islamicetiquette.wordpress.com/category/hide-your-sins|work=Islamic Etiquette|publisher=Islamic Etiquette}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, according to Islam, [[Blood sacrifice]] cannot add to [[Divine Grace]] nor replace the necessity of repentance. However, sacrifice is done to help the poor and to remember [[Abraham]]’s willingness to sacrifice his son at [[Islamic concept of God|God]]'s command.
{{quote|It is not their meat nor their blood that reaches Allah. it is your piety that reaches Him..."| Qur'an, sura 22, ayat 37&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|22|37|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When a human has violated another human’s rights, ḥuqūq al-ʿibād, compensation is necessary in order to show that one has made amends.

When a human has offended or disobeyed God, ḥuqūq Allāh, penitence, remorse, and resolution are necessary in order to show that one is sincere, and will not repeat the wrongdoing in the future.

According to Shaddad ibn Aws:
{{quote|Shall I not how to seek forgiveness? O Allah, You are my Lord, there is no God but You; for You created me and I am Your servant; and I am upon Your covenant and Your promise as much as I am able; I seek refuge in You from the evil of what I have done; I acknowledge Your favors upon me and I recognize my sins, so forgive my sins; verily, none can forgive sins but You.| Sunan At-Tirmidhi, Book of Supplications, Number 3393, Hasan&lt;ref&gt;Hadith, Sunan At-Tirmidhi, Book of Supplications, Number 3393&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From a traditionalist perspective, sin is applied to an individual’s actions. Through belief and good works, an individual can remove his/her sin and attain God’s good favor. 
Classical legal scholar Muhammad al-Shafi'i (767 – 820) derived this understanding from Quranic passages such as:&lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies_a" /&gt;

{{quote|But He will overlook the bad deeds of those who have faith, do good deeds, and believe in what has been sent down to Muhammad —the truth from their Lord —and He will put them into a good state.| Qur'an, sura 47, ayat 2&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|47|2|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From a modernist perspective, sin has also been applied to a group or community’s collective behavior. Through public acknowledgement of wrongdoing, people can take responsibility for the lack of morality within their society and enact social reform. Egyptian reformer Muḥammad ʿAbduh (1849–1905) and his disciple Muḥammad Rashīd Ridā (1865–1935) derived this understanding from Quranic passages such as:&lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies_a" /&gt;

{{quote|Unless they repent, make amends, and declare the truth. I will certainly accept their repentance.| Qur'an, sura 2, ayat 160&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|2|160|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Other modern reformers, such as [[Sayyid Qutb]], held that repentance involved a renewed, holistic commitment to Islam, rather than admission of sin for the sake of being pardoned of punishment. This understanding draws from classical Sufi thought, whereby one experiences a personality transformation and his/her sinful impulses are replaced by virtue.&lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies_a" /&gt; Qutb derived this understanding from Quranic passages such as:

{{quote|Those who repent, believe, and do good deeds: God will change the evil deeds of such people into good ones.| Qur'an, sura 25 ayat 70&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|25|70|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Repentance for sin can be accomplished through acts such as, “fasting, giving charity, sacrificing an animal, and freeing a slave.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mir|first=Mustansir|title=Dictionary of Quranic Terms and Concepts|year=1987|publisher=Garland Publishing|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, going on the [[hajj]] can serve as a form of repentance.

According to Shaddad ibn Aws:
{{quote|The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said, “The lesser pilgrimage unto the lesser pilgrimage will expiate whatever sins were committed between them; and the accepted pilgrimage has no reward other than Paradise.| Sahih Bukhari, Book 27, Number 1 &lt;ref&gt;Hadith, Sahih Bukhari, Book 27, Number 1&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, regardless of one's outward deeds, God does not accept the forgiveness of those who are insincere in their repentance and only do so in order to avoid [[jahannam]].

{{quote|It is not true repentance when people continue to do evil until death confronts them and then say, ‘Now I repent.| 
Qur'an, sura 4 [[ayat]] 18&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|4|18|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Major sins: Al-Kabirah==

The most heinous sins in Islam are known as Al-Kabirah ({{lang-fa|گناه کبیره}}) which translates to the great or major one. Some authors use the term enormity. While every sin is seen as an offense to Allah, the al-Kaba'ir are the gravest of the offenses.&lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies" /&gt; Allah’s power is thought to be only eclipsed by his mercy and thus small sins are tacitly understood to be forgiven after repentance. Not every sin is equal however and some are thought to be more spiritually damning than others. The greatest of the sins described as al-Kaba'ir is the association of others with Allah or [[Shirk (Islam)|Shirk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|4|36|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar differ as to how many major sins there are.
In contrasting major sins with minor sins (''al-sagha'ir''), the eighth-century [[Shafi'i]] scholar [[Al-Dhahabi]] found the [[hadith]] collections of [[Sahih al-Bukhari]] and [[Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj]] listed seven major sins, while the tradition from [[Abd Allah ibn Abbas]] stated that there were closer to seventy major sins.
&lt;ref name=Siddiqui&gt;{{cite book|last1=Siddiqui|first1=Mona|title=The Good Muslim: Reflections on Classical Islamic Law and Theology|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=2012|page=126|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NgmjUI9s0f8C&amp;pg=PA126&amp;dq=%22difference+between+hadith+collections%22+major+sin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-1msU836HYOCqgaF4YGwAw&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22difference%20between%20hadith%20collections%22%20major%20sin&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the major or al-Kaba'ir sins in Islam are as follows:&lt;ref name = "Al-Kabair-Sins"&gt;{{ISBN|1-56744-489-X}} The Major Sins Al-Kabirah By Muhammad bin 'Uthman Adh-Dhahabi, rendered into English by Mohammad Moinuddin Siddiqui&lt;/ref&gt;

#[[Shirk (Islam)|Shirk]] (associating anything with Allah)
#Despair of Allah's mercy
#Disobeying parents
#[[Zina]] (adultery)
#[[Sodomy]]
#[[Theft]]
#Consumption of alcohol % other intoxicants
#[[Gambling]]
#[[Backbiting]] (saying bad things about a person who is not there)
#Leaving daily prayer
#[[Zakat]] evasion
#[[Witchcraft]]
#[[murder|Killing]] one whom Allah has declared inviolate without a just case
#Consuming the property of an orphan
#Devouring [[usury]]
#[[desertion|Turning back]] when the army advances
#[[False accusation]] of chaste women who are believers but indiscreet

It should be noted that these are only the opinion of particular scholars and do not wholly represent Islam.

Although many of the ideas for what is unacceptable overlap, the seven major sins of Islam differs from the seven deadly sins of Christianity. The Islamic sins refer more to specific undesirable behavior rather than to the general negative characteristics or actions of the cardinal Christian sins. Despite the similar names, the seven main sins in Islam are more comparable to the Ten Commandments rather than the seven deadly sins. They both provide the bottom line for believers in terms of what is acceptable behavior in the faith. The actions themselves differ most of the major crimes in Islam relate to subservience to Allah. Any form of polytheism is seen to be the most severe offense in the religion and all of the other transgressions are in some form of association with Allah. Witchcraft, for example, is the taking on of supernatural powers in order to make the practitioner a being above the normal human. This challenges the power of Allah as the person in question has superseded their mortal position to become something greater and akin to a god. The same can be said of murder, as ultimately the power to decide who shall live and die is believed to belong solely to Allah. Life is thought to be a gift from Allah and the unjust taking of life is a severe spiritual offense, as it is not only seen as morally wrong but also as an affront to God.

In addition to what Muslim scholars agree are the principal seven sins, the idea exists that the major sins extend far past the seven. These additional transgressions, potentially up to seventy, are not universally settled upon nor are they explicitly stated in the Qur'an, however they are thought to be implied by the text.&lt;ref name="Al-Kabair-Sins" /&gt; The supplementary sins as a whole lack the spiritual gravity of the original seven and include things such as drinking alcohol and eavesdropping.

'''James Pierson Beckwourth''', born '''James Beckwith''' and generally known as, '''Jim Beckwourth''' (April 26, 1798&lt;ref&gt;Elinor Wilson, ''Jim Beckwourth – Black Mountain Man, War Chief of the Crows'', Norman and London: University of Oklahoma Press, 1972, {{ISBN|0-8061-1555-6}}, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; or 1800 – October 29, 1866 or 1867) was an American [[mountain man]], [[fur trade]]r, and [[explorer]]. James was also famously known as "Bloody Arm" because of his skill as a fighter. He was mixed-race and born into [[slavery]] in [[Virginia]], he was freed by his father (and master) and apprenticed to a blacksmith. As a young man, he moved to the [[Western United States|American West]] first making connections with fur traders in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. As a fur trapper, he lived with the [[Crow Nation]] for years. He is credited with the discovery of [[Beckwourth Pass]], through the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)]] Mountains, between present-day [[Reno]], Nevada, and [[Portola, California]], during the [[California Gold Rush]] years, and improved the Beckwourth Trail, which thousands of settlers followed to central California.

He narrated his life story to [[Thomas D. Bonner]], an itinerant [[justice of the peace]].  The book was published in [[New York City]] and [[London]] in 1856 as ''The Life and Adventures of James P. Beckwourth: Mountaineer, Scout and Pioneer, and Chief of the Crow Nation of Indians''.&lt;ref name=BeckwourthAutobiography&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bonner|first1=Thomas D.|title=The Life and Adventures of James P.

Early historians of the [[Old West]] originally considered the book little more than campfire lore. It has since been reassessed as a valuable source of social history, especially for life among the Crow, although not all its details are reliable or accurate. The [[civil rights movement]] of the 1960s celebrated Beckwourth as an early African-American pioneer. He has since been featured as a [[role model]] in [[children's literature]] and [[textbook]]s.

==Early life of slavery==
James was born into slavery in [[Frederick County, Virginia]], but sources differ as to the year: 1798 or 1800.&lt;ref name="beckwourth.org"&gt;[http://www.beckwourth.org/Biography/index.html "Biography: Early Years"; note on 1972 biography], James Beckwourth Website, accessed 6 Oct 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Being born of mixed race, he had a mother who was an enslaved African-American woman, and a white father who was their master, Sir Jennings Beckwith, a descendant of [[Irish people|Irish]] and [[English people|English]] nobility. Little was known about Beckwourth's mother, but James was said to be third of her thirteen children. When James was a boy, his father arranged to apprentice him to a blacksmith so that he could learn a good trade. He acknowledged James as his son. Beckwourth was apprenticed to a [[blacksmith]] until age 19 to learn a trade.  James was fired by the artisan after getting into an argument with him.&lt;ref name="beckwourth.org"/&gt;

Jennings Beckwith moved to [[Missouri]] around 1809, when James was young, taking his mother and all their children with him. Although Beckwith raised his mixed-race children as his own, he legally held them as master. He freed James Beckworth by manumission, by deed of [[abolitionism in the United States|emancipation]] in court in 1824, 1825, and 1826.&lt;ref name="beckwourth.org"/&gt; The young Beckwourth, as he later came to spell his surname, attended school in [[St. Louis]] for four years. When and why James changed his name to Beckwourth is unknown.

==Fur trade, Indian fighter, and a black chief of the Crow Nation==
In 1824 as a young man, Beckwourth joined Gen. [[William Henry Ashley|William Ashley]]'s [[Rocky Mountain Fur Company]], as a [[Wrangler (profession)|wrangler]] on Ashley's expedition to explore the [[Rocky Mountains]].  In the following years, Beckwourth became known as a prominent [[animal trapping|trapper]] and [[mountain man]].  He worked with the [[Rocky Mountain Fur Company]] and was an Indian fighter. He was well known for telling tales about his adventures.

In July 1825, [[Rocky Mountain Rendezvous|rendezvous]], trapper and colleague [[Caleb Greenwood]] told the campfire story of Beckwourth's being the child of a [[Crow Nation|Crow]] chief.  He claimed Beckwourth had been stolen as a baby by raiding [[Cheyenne]] and sold to whites. This lore was widely believed, as Beckwourth had adopted Native American dress and was taken by some people as an Indian.

[[Image:Beckwourth indian warrior05.jpg|thumb|Beckwourth as Indian warrior, 1856]]
Later that year, Beckwourth claimed to have been captured by [[Crow Indians]] while trapping in the border county between the territories of Crow, Cheyenne, and [[Blackfoot]].  According to his account, he was mistaken for the lost son of a Crow chief, so they admitted him to the nation. Independent accounts suggest his stay with the Crow was planned by the Rocky Mountain Fur Company to advance its trade with the tribe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beckwourth.org/Biography/index.html "Biography"], James Beckwourth Website, accessed 6 Oct 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Beckwourth married the daughter of a [[tribal chief|chief]], and may have had multiple wives. (Marriages between Native Americans and fur trappers and traders were common for the valuable alliances they provided both parties.)

For the next eight to nine years, Beckwourth lived with a Crow band. He rose in their society from warrior to chief (a respected man) and leader of the "Dog Clan". According to his book, he eventually ascended to the highest-ranking war chief of the Crow Nation.&lt;ref&gt;''The Life and Adventures of James P. Beckwourth'', 1865, [https://books.google.com/books?id=aMowAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA265 page 263]&lt;/ref&gt; He still trapped but did not sell his or Crow furs to his former partners of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company.  Instead, he sold to [[John Jacob Astor]]'s competing [[American Fur Company]]. Beckwourth participated in raids by the Crow on neighboring nations and the occasional white party. Sometimes such raids escalated to warfare, most often against bands of their traditional Blackfoot enemy.

==Indian trader==
In 1837, when the American Fur Company did not renew his contract, Beckwourth returned to St. Louis. He volunteered with the United States Army to fight in the [[Second Seminole War]] in [[Florida]]. In his book, he claimed to have been a soldier and courier. According to historical records, he was a civilian wagon master in the baggage division.&lt;ref&gt;Elinor Wilson: ''Jim Beckwourth – Black Mountain Man, War Chief of the Crows''. University of Texas Press, Norman and London, 1972, {{ISBN|0-8061-1555-6}}, p. 86/87&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1838 to 1840, Beckwourth was an Indian trader against the Cheyenne, on the [[Arkansas River]], working out of [[Fort Vasquez]], Colorado, near [[Platteville, Colorado|Platteville]]. In 1840, he moved to the [[Bent &amp; St. Vrain Company]] (the Bent brothers built [[Fort Bent]] on the Arkansas River).  Later that same year, Beckwourth became an independent trader. Together with other partners, he built a [[trading post]] in Colorado.  It was the center of development of the community of [[Pueblo, Colorado]].

In 1844, Beckwourth traded on the [[Old Spanish Trail (trade route)|Old Spanish Trail]] between the Arkansas River and [[California]], then controlled by [[Mexico]].  When the [[Mexican–American War]] began in 1846, Beckwourth returned to the United States.  He brought along nearly 1,800 stolen Mexican horses, as spoils of war. In the war, he served as a courier with the [[US Army]] and helped suppress the [[Taos Revolt]].  His former employer, [[Charles Bent]], then interim governor of [[New Mexico]], was slain in that revolt.

==Store keeper, professional gambler, rancher, hotel keeper, and author==
By 1848 and the start of the [[California Gold Rush|Gold Rush]], Beckwourth went to California.  He opened a store at [[Sonoma, California|Sonoma]], but he soon sold up and went to [[Sacramento]], then a boomtown close to the mines, to live as a professional card player.

In 1850, Beckwourth was credited with discovering what came to be called [[Beckwourth Pass]], a low-elevation pass through the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] Mountain chain.  In 1851, he improved what became the Beckwourth Trail, originally a Native American path through the mountains. It began near [[Pyramid Lake (Nevada)|Pyramid Lake]] and the [[Truckee Meadows]] east of the mountains, climbed to the pass named for him, and went along a ridge, between two forks of [[Feather River]], before passing down through the gold fields of northern California, and on to [[Marysville, California|Marysville]]. The trail spared the settlers and gold seekers, about {{convert|150|mi}} and several steep grades and dangerous passes, such as [[Donner Pass]].

By his account, the business communities of the gold towns in California were supposed to fund the making of the trail. However, when Beckwourth tried to collect his payment in 1851 after leading a party through, Marysville had suffered from two huge fires and town leaders were unable to pay. (In 1996, in recognition of his contribution to the city's development and of the outstanding debt to him, the City of Marysville officially renamed the town's largest park Beckwourth Riverfront Park.)

Beckwourth began ranching in the Sierra.  His ranch, trading post and hotel, in today's [[Sierra Valley]], were the starting of the settlement of [[Beckwourth, California]].  In the winter of 1854/55, the [[itinerant judge]], [[Thomas D. Bonner]] stayed in the hotel, and on winter nights Beckwourth told him his life story.  Bonner wrote it down, edited the material the following year, and offered the book to [[Harper &amp; Brothers]] in New York. ''The Life and Adventures of James P. Beckwourth''&lt;ref name=BeckwourthAutobiography /&gt; was published in 1856. According to the contract, Beckwourth was entitled to one half of the proceeds, but he never received any income from Bonner.

==United States Indian agent and scout during Sand Creek Massacre and Red Cloud's War==
In 1859, Beckwourth returned to Missouri briefly, but settled later, that year in [[Denver]], [[Colorado Territory]].  He was a storekeeper and was appointed as local agent for Indian affairs.  In 1864, Beckwourth was hired as a scout, by Colonel [[John M. Chivington]], commander of the [[3rd Colorado Cavalry Regiment]] for a campaign against the Cheyenne and [[Apache]] leading a frontier [[para-military]] volunteer militia formed to annihilate hostile Indian resistance in the Territory and eliminate future attacks against American settlers. The Colorado Territory campaign resulted in the [[Sand Creek Massacre]], in which the hostile militia killed an estimated 70-163 friendly Cheyenne men, women and children, who had camped in an area suggested by the previous commander of [[Fort Lyon]] as a safe place and flying an American flag to show their peaceful intentions. Outraged by his association with the massacre, the Cheyenne banned Beckwourth from trading with them.  Well into his 60s by then, Beckwourth returned to trapping. In 1866 during [[Red Cloud's War]] the U.S. Army also employed him as a scout at [[Fort Laramie]] and [[Fort Phil Kearny]].

==Death==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}
While guiding a military column to a Crow band in Montana, James Beckwourth complained of severe headaches and suffered nosebleeds, most probably the result of a severe case of hypertension. He returned to the Crow village, where he died on October 29, 1866, with unstoppable nose bleeding. [[William Byers]], a personal friend and the founder of the ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]'', claimed the Crow had poisoned Beckwourth, as the tribe felt they could not trust him because of his involvement in the [[Sand Creek Massacre]].  However, Byers had no supporting evidence, which made the claim pure speculation. James Beckwourth died in [[Denver]], [[Colorado Territory]], now present-day [[Denver]], [[Colorado]]. Beckwourth was left to the elements elevated on a platform in the traditional funerary custom of the Crow Tribe at the Crow Indian Settlement Burial Ground, [[Laramie, Wyoming|Laramie]], [[Albany County, Wyoming]].

&lt;!-- should be expanded, along the article in de-WP ----&gt;

==Marriage and family==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}
At different times, Beckwourth had married at least four women: two Native Americans, an Hispanic, and an African American. He had numerous children by them, although he spent most of his time on the move exploring and trapping beaver and bear.

== Beckwourth's frontier memoir ==
Beckwourth recounted his life history to Thomas D. Bonner, who wrote the book ''The Life and Adventures of James P. Beckwourth: Mountaineer, Scout, Pioneer and Chief of the Crow Nation''.&lt;ref name=BeckwourthAutobiography /&gt;  Beckwourth's language and style (as written by Bonner) were as notable as the reported adventures.  The book provides historical information on how US government officials used alcohol; how occupations affect those who work in the field; the historical relationship among diseases, wildlife, and the environment; as well as reports dealing with massacres and war.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Jim Beckwourth, who knew, said that though the Indian could never become a white man, the white man lapsed easily into an Indian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Bernard DeVoto]]|title=The Year of Decision: 1846|location=Boston|publisher= Little, Brown|date=1943|page= 65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In popular culture==
In the [[James Michener]] 1978 NBC television [[miniseries]] ''[[Centennial (miniseries)|Centennial]]'' Jim Beckworth appears briefly being portrayed by actor [[Carl Franklin]]. In the 2015 film ''The Revenant'', an unnamed African-American is depicted, as part of [[William Henry Ashley|Ashley's 100]].  Since the chronology of events in the life of Hugh Glass was changed slightly for the film, it is unclear if the African-American shown was intended to be James Beckwourth, [[Edward Rose (Mountain man)|Edward Rose]], a lesser known black mountain man, or simply a representation of the wider acceptance and equality of blacks on the western frontier that gave rise to historical figures like Beckwourth.  Hugh Glass' legendary return, after being abandoned and left for dead, occurred in 1823, and Beckwourth did not join the expedition until 1824.  However, there was an intervening period of time, between the return of Glass and his confrontation with Bridger and Fitzgerald, that did occur subsequent to 1824, that was changed in the film for the sake of [[concision|brevity]].

==Legacy and honors==
* [[Beckwourth Pass]], named in honor of James Beckwourth, is located in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in [[Plumas County, California]]. [[California State Route 70|State Route 70]] crosses the Sierra at an elevation of 1,591 m (5,221&amp;nbsp;ft), making it one of the lowest crossings of the Sierra Nevada in California. It is also the route that the [[Western Pacific Railroad]] used to cross the Sierra along their [[Feather River]] route. The pass is located east of [[Portola, California]].
* Beckwourth improved a Native American path to create what became known as the Beckwourth Trail through Plumas, Butte, and Yuba counties. In August 1851, he led the first intact wagon train into the burgeoning Gold Rush city of [[Marysville, California]].  Beckwourth demanded payment for improving the trail, claiming he had an agreement with the city and its merchants.  The city failed to pay him because it had suffered two fires and had extensive property damage.  Beckwourth could not sue for damages. The former major had lost not only the town, but the state, and the council claimed there was no paper record. The trail was heavily used through 1855, when people began to shift to the newly constructed railroad for passage.
* In 1994, the U.S. Postal Service issued a 29 cent commemorative postage stamp honoring Jim Beckwourth.
* In 1996, the city of Marysville renamed its largest park Beckwourth Riverfront Park in recognition of Beckwourth's significance to the growth of the city.  The city sponsored, for a few years, the former "Beckwourth Frontier Days", annually held in October, then the only [[living history]] festival in northern California.

'''James Felton Keith''' (born September 25, 1981, in [[Detroit, Michigan]]) commonly referred to by his initials '''JFK''', is an American [[engineer]], [[author]], and [[serial entrepreneur]]. James was the first [[African-American]] representative of the [[LGBT]] community to run for [[United States House of Representatives]] in [[New York's 13th congressional district]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianhonigman/2018/04/25/james-felton-keith-how-lgbtq-entrepreneurs-can-get-more-political/#58666c8c5d88 |work = Forbes |title = James Felton Keith: How LGBTQ Entrepreneurs Can Get Involved in Politics |date = April 25, 2018 |first = Brian |last = Honigman }}&lt;/ref&gt; Keith incubated and founded many companies including the conference [[Personal Data Week]], [[FinTech]] analytics firm ''Accrue.com'', the [[Detroit Regional LGBT Chamber of Commerce]], and the TV network [[Slay TV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://wjla.com/features/good-morning-washington/slaytv-the-premiere-destination-for-global-queer-and-trans-content |title = SlayTV: the Premiere Destination for Global Queer and Trans Content |work = Good Morning Washington |location = Washington, DC |publisher = [[WJLA-TV]] |date = April 21, 2017 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180709215649/http://wjla.com/features/good-morning-washington/slaytv-the-premiere-destination-for-global-queer-and-trans-content |archive-date = July 9, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://tnj.com/james-felton-keith-among-speakers-2016-hope-global-forum-annual-meeting/ |title = James Felton Keith Among Speakers at 2016 HOPE Global Forum Annual Meeting |work = The Network Journal |date = December 22, 2015 |access-date = August 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the earliest advocates for individual ownership of [[personal data]], and the economic value of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url = https://www.jsonline.com/story/opinion/contributors/2016/11/20/keith-personal-data-trumps-big-data/94151600/ |title = Keith: Personal Data Trumps Big Data |date = November 20, 2016 |first = James Felton |last = Keith |work = [[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal data==

Keith defined '"personal data" as a micro-personalized form of [[big data]] while searching for a mechanism to measure the value of people's contribution to the productivity of their surrounding society.&lt;ref name=pelletier&gt;{{cite news |first = Martin |last = Pelletier |url = http://business.financialpost.com/investing/why-data-is-the-new-oil-and-what-it-means-for-your-investment-portfolio |title = Why data is the new oil and what it means for your investment portfolio |work = Financial Post |date = August 29, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is noted saying that his wildest dream would be "Americans are now making trade-offs for personhood, not privacy. In the land of the free, we have to ask the question, who owns us?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1 = James Felton |last1 = Keith |first2 = Patricia |last2 = Paul |url = https://www.detroitnews.com/story/opinion/2016/10/23/protect-personhood-age-data/92652354/ |title = Protect personhood in the age of data |work = The Detroit News |date = October 23, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His 2017 book on personal data ''The People's Asset class'' was a collection of essays built on the premise that: "value is like that of energy. It cannot be created nor destroyed, but can change form."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first = James Felton |last = Keith |year = |title = Personal Data: The People's Asset Class |location = |publisher = |page = |isbn = |oclc = }}{{full citation needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the notion that personal data is a [[natural resource]], Keith founded the International Personal Data Trade Association&lt;ref name=pelletier/&gt; and produced the conference series Personal Data Week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/305426/new-week-focuses-on-data-this-time-its-person.html |title = New 'Week' Focuses On Data: This Time, It's Personal |work = Media Post |first = Joe |last = Mandese |date = August 7, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When interviewed by the British data industry paper ''Internet Of Me'', Keith elaborated on thoughts about human value measured by data: "I'm not necessarily as concerned about control over my data as much as I am of having the right to have some agency over its cumulative value and the right to retaliate when I think my data is being used in inequitable or unethical ways."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Simon |last = Carroll |url = http://internetofme.net/the-value-of-personal-data-interview-with-james-felton-keith/ |title = The value of personal data: Interview with James Felton Keith |work = Internet Of Me |date = August 22, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human rights work==
In 2013 he established the Keith Institute with the objective of establishing economic and educational inclusion alongside his sister Kharena Keith Coleman, an educator and researcher. The institute is used to divide his economic and education work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last = Martin |first = Melissa |url = https://issuu.com/parkviewmag/docs/parkview_issue_no._3_preview |title = Starting with One: Keith Institute Provides Detroit Students Measurable Tutoring Programs to Improve Reading, Math, and Science |work = Parkview |issue = 3 |pages = 75–78 |date = December 2015 |via = [[Issuu]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Keith has founded multiple social and for-profit enterprises that still exist after his exit. During public talks on [[entrepreneurship]] he frequently says that "all problems are distribution problems", when explaining how we should think about solutions to those problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |author = Spiire |url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VG3h4U1sXw&amp;feature=youtu.be |title = James Felton Keith at spiire inQ: An inQubator for Queer Thought Leadership |date = October 5, 2017 |publisher = Spiire |via = YouTube }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has spent what he calls his second career, building enterprises that deliver economic resources to the people in the most need.

A economic activist, he is responsible for the first [[LGBT Pride]] games in all four [[major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.detroitnews.com/story/sports/2015/04/06/tigers-lgbt-comerica-park/25387009/ |title = Tigers Will Host First LGBT Pride Night June 3 |date = April 6, 2015 |first = Tony |last = Paul |work = [[The Detroit News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the first pride night at an [[NFL]] franchise, he was noted to have engaged the "great equalizer" for LGBT rights in the same way [[civil rights era]] activists engaged the business of [[professional sports]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.freep.com/story/sports/nfl/lions/2015/06/29/detroit-lions-lgbt-pride-night/29478141/ |title = LGBT Pride Event Slated for Lions Game This Fall |date = June 29, 2015 |first = Dave |last = Birkett |work = [[Detroit Free Press]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Keith implemented what he calls "economic activism as CEO of [[Detroit Regional LGBT Chamber of Commerce]] an affiliate of the [[National LGBT Chamber of Commerce]] while advocating to include the ''B'' and ''T'' in the LGBT chamber to represent [[bisexual]] community members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.pridesource.com/article.html?article=70167 |title = Establishing LGBT Relationships: A Look into the Regional Detroit LGBT Chamber of Commerce |author = BTL Staff |date = February 12, 2015 |work = Between the Lines}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keith alleged that he was fired from the Mayor of Detroit [[Mike Duggan]]'s cabinet for building the chamber of commerce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/these-white-gay-guys-are-_b_8829036.html |title = 'These White Gay Guys Are Coming to Take All Our Jobs.'

In 2015 he cofounded Slay TV with Sean Torrington and Terry Torrington, and it is the primary [[digital television]] destination content from [[Queer]] [[people of color]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-new-candidate-follows-the-blue-wave_us_5a085d76e4b0ee8ec3694281 |work = [[HuffPost]] |title =  A New Candidate Follows the Blue Wave |date = November 12, 2017 |first = Nathan |last = James }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 he founded the Personal Data Week conference via the International Personal Data Trade Association to explore data as a natural resource among all corporate productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://internetofme.net/the-value-of-personal-data-interview-with-james-felton-keith/ |title = The Value of Personal Data: Interview with James Felton Keith |date = August 22, 2017 |first = Simon |last = Carroll |work = Internet of Me }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Randolph Beverley II''' is a literary and cultural critic at the [[University of Pittsburgh]], where he is a professor of Spanish and Latin American Literature and Cultural Studies as well as an adjunct professor in the English and communication departments.  He was influential in co-founding the [[Latin American subaltern studies]]&lt;ref name="urlThe Latin American Subaltern Studies Group"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digitalunion.osu.edu/r2/summer06/herbert/testimoniosubaltern/latinamericasuba.html |title=The Latin American Subaltern Studies Group |work= |accessdate=2011-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; group as well as a founding member of the Graduate Program in Cultural Studies at the University of Pittsburgh.

He is a U.S.-based Latin Americanist cultural and literary theorist. In his work he is committed to revolutionary changes that would end the differences between rich and poor in Latin America and make a new and revolutionary democratic culture corresponding to the people’s economic and political democratic revolutions. He has a dual emphasis on democracy and the people—-the workers, the masses, ''los de abajo'', the multitude, and what he designates the subalter.

Born into a prosperous Anglo American family residing in South America, he became sensitive to the poverty and misery in which so many lived even as he had all the benefits of his class and caste.   In this sense, his life goal has been to negate such differences.  As a non-Hispanic student of Spanish literature, he gradually turned to Latin American themes, within larger contexts.  At Princeton and then at the University of California, San Diego, he focused on Spanish Peninsular literature of Américo Castro, Carlos Blanco Aguinaga, and Claudio Guillén; and studied Fredric Jameson who was developing methods for a Marxist approach to cultural and literary phenomena. He published a Marxist interpretation of Gongora’s ''Soledades'' as his dissertation and first book.  

The center of his interests shifted from Spain to Latin America, impelled by the political hopes of the 1960s and 1970s. He sought the application of his understanding of the Baroque to the development and structural situation of literature as a colonial and postcolonial institutions in the Americas. As a self-proclaimed Marxist and activist,{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} he developed his literary work in relation to the Institute of Ideologies and Literatures in Minnesota, seeking to find progressive dimensions of literature and criticism that transcended state-centered powers of structure.  That effort culminated in his ''Del Lazarillo a Sandinismo'' and his book with Marc Zimmerman, ''Literature and Politics in the Central American Revolutions''. 

Beverley has written a number of texts on the ''testimonio'', which can concern popular representation in literature and politics. He has taken the position that Latin America’s own ideological structures have prevented the area's most progressive intellectuals from grasping their own reality.  With the end of the cold war, the defeat of the [[Sandinistas]] and the full emergence of postmodern perspectives in Latin Americanist discourse, he produced a collection entitled ''The  Post-Modern Debate in Latin America''.  While working on that text, he along with Ileana Rodríguez and others, co-founded the Latin American Subaltern Studies group, seeking a new post-cold war/post-sandinista post/postmodedrn theorization of the relations between culture, literature and political possibility, which he and other members (following Ernesto Laclau and others involved in cultural studies theory, but above all the South Asian Subaltern studies Group—at first through Gayatri Spivack and then more directly through R. Guha and others) saw as centered not directly on social classes but  on the social groups and movements that struggled for empowerment and expression in the Americas.  

In ''Against Literature'', he writes from a subalternist perspective, and considers literature and existing literary studies (even leftwing versions) as implicated in hegemonic modernization projects at odds with subaltern positions.  This view, now developed in relation to developing Latin American cultural studies discourse and in relation to the full emergence of globalization as the new macro-narrative of the post-postmodern period, became the subject of ''Subalternity and Representation'' (1999).  The Latin American subaltern group dissolved early in the 21st century, but Beverley has continued working, co-developing a Pittsburgh University Press book series called “Illuminations: Cultural Formations of the Americas,” publishing a new collection on Cuban literature, re-publishing his book with Hugo Achugar on ''testimonio'', and completing ''Testimonio: The Politics of Truth'' (2004).  In ''Latin Americanism after 9/11'' (2014), he argues for a new situation for Latin America in the emerging global order, especially in view of [[Hugo Chávez]], [[Evo Morales]] and other new left figures who have challenged older paradigms of left and right of previous decades. He critiques what he considers the failed politics of Zapatismo, and the “neo-conservative turn.”

'''Khertvisi fortress''' ({{lang-ka|ხერთვისის ციხე}}) is one of the oldest fortresses in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and was functional throughout the Georgian feudal period. It is situated in Southern Georgia, in [[Meskheti]] region. The fortress was first built in the 2nd century BC. The church was built in 985, and the present walls were built in 1354. As the legend says, Khertvisi was destroyed by [[Alexander the Great]].

==Middle Ages and later use==
In the 10th-11th centuries it was the center of Meskheti region. During the 12th century it became a town. In the 13th century [[Mongols]] destroyed it and until the 15th century it lost its power. In the 15th century it was owned by Meskheti landlords from [[Jakeli]] family. In the 16th century the southern region of Georgia was invaded by [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]]. During next 300 years they have owned Khertvisi too.

At the end of the 19th century [[Military of Georgia|Georgian]] and [[Armed Forces of the Russian Federation|Russian]] army returned the lost territories and Khertvisi became the military base for Russian and Georgian troops. Khertvisi fortress is situated on the high rocky hill in the narrow canyon at the confluence of the [[Mtkvari]] and Paravani Rivers.

The '''Langdale axe industry''' is the name given by archaeologists to specialised [[stone tool]] manufacturing centred at [[Great Langdale]] in England's [[Lake District]] during the [[Neolithic]] period (beginning about 4000&amp;nbsp;BC in Britain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scarre|first=Chris|title=The Human Past|year=2005|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|isbn=9780500285312|page=414}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The existence of a production site was originally suggested by chance discoveries in the 1930s, which were followed by more systematic searching in the 1940s and 1950s by [[Clare Fell]] and others. The finds were mainly reject axes, rough-outs and blades created by [[knapping]] large lumps of the rock found in the [[scree]] or perhaps by simple [[quarry]]ing or [[opencast mining]]. [[Hammerstone]]s have also been found in the scree and other [[Stone tool|lithic]] [[debitage]] from the industry such as blades and [[Lithic flake|flake]]s.

The area has outcrops of fine-grained [[greenstone (archaeology)|greenstone]] or [[hornstone]] suitable for making polished stone axes. Such axes have been found distributed across Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Rodney Castleden, {{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-wYOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=Langdale+axe+industry#v=onepage&amp;q=Langdale%20axe%20industry&amp;f=false |title=Neolithic Britain: new stone age sites of England, Scotland, and Wales |publisher=Routledge |date=1992 |isbn=0415058457 |accessdate=2009-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rock is an [[epidote|epidotised]] greenstone quarried or perhaps just collected from the scree slopes in the Langdale Valley on [[Harrison Stickle]] and [[Pike of Stickle]]. The nature and extent of the axe-flaking sites making up the Langdale Axe Factory complex are still under investigation.
[[Geological mapping]] has established that the [[volcanic]] [[tuff]] used for the axes outcrops along a narrow range of the highest peaks in the locality. Other outcrops in the area are known to have been worked, especially on [[Harrison Stickle]], and [[Scafell Pike]] where rough-outs and flakes have been found on platforms below the peaks at and above the 2000- or 3000-foot level.

==Petrographic analysis==
[[File:Pike of Stickle from Loft Crag.jpg|thumb|right|Pike of Stickle from [[Loft Crag]]]]
[[Image:Scafell Pike from Broad Crag.jpg|thumb|right|The summit of [[Scafell Pike]], seen from neighbouring [[Broad Crag]]]]
Archaeologists are able to identify the unique nature of the Langdale stone by taking sections and examining them using [[microscopy]]. The minerals in the rock have a characteristic pattern, using a method known as [[petrography]]. They have been able to reconstruct the production methods and trade patterns employed by the axe makers. The Langdale [[archaeological industry|industry]] produced roughly hewn (or so-called "rough-outs") axes and simple blocks. The highly polished final product were usually made elsewhere, such as at [[Ehenside tarn]] in the western fringes of the Lake District, and all were traded on throughout Britain and Ireland. The Langdale tuff was among the most common of the various rocks used to make axes in the [[Neolithic]] period, and are known as Group VI axes. [[Flint]] was also commonly used to make polished axes, and mined at several places, but especially at [[Grimes Graves]] and [[Cissbury]], and in continental Europe at [[Neolithic flint mines of Spiennes|Spiennes]] in Belgium, and [[Krzemionki]] in Poland.

Polishing the rough surfaces will have improved the [[mechanical strength]] of the axe as well as lowering [[friction]] when used against wood. Fractures occur more easily in brittle materials like stone when rough owing to the [[stress concentration]]s present at sharp corners, holes and other defects in the axe surface.  Removing those defects by polishing makes the axe much stronger, and able to withstand impact and shock loads from use. [[Sandstone]] was usually used for polishing axes, and [[Sharpening stone|whetstones]] have been found nearby at Ehenside tarn, for example where the rough-outs were polished. Large fixed outcrops were also widely used for polishing, and there are numerous examples across Europe, but relatively few in Britain. That at [[Fyfield Down]] near [[Avebury]] is an exception, but there must be many more awaiting discovery and publication.

==Distribution and use==
The stone axes from Langdale have been found at archaeological sites across Britain and Ireland. An unusual concentration of finds occurs in the East of England, particularly Lincolnshire. Francis Pryor&lt;ref name = "Pryor"&gt;Francis Pryor ''Britain BC'', publ. Harper Collins 2003 {{ISBN|0-00-712692-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; attributes this to these axes being particularly valued in this region. He mentions possible religious significance of the axes, perhaps related to the high peaks from which they came. He compares this with confirmed Neolithic flint mines which, apart from Grimes Graves (where flint of exceptionally high quality was mined), were all at prominent elevated locations.

Of all the Neolithic polished stone axes that have been examined in the UK, around 27% come from the Langdale region. This is notable considering there were over 30 sources of material for stone axes from Cornwall to northern Scotland and Ireland.

Whether religious objects or not, the axes must have been of high value, given that they have been "traded" so widely. Some axes appear worn whilst others appear unused, again implying that they were regarded as sacred objects or, perhaps, simply as a display of visible wealth. Some though were used as practical tools. The shape of the polished axes suggests that they were bound in wooden staves and used for forest clearance.

Francis Pryor discusses a flint axe that he found north of [[Peterborough]] with fantastic swirling patterns that had been brought out by polishing – but this axe was totally impractical as the patterns were fault lines, making the flint very fragile. However, it must have been valued by its owner and/or maker, bearing in mind the work involved in making it. These facts suggest various interpretations of the purpose of the Langdale axes, which were both beautiful and practical, as well as being traded many miles from their place of production.

==Context==
[[File:Castlerigg.jpg|thumb|left|[[Castlerigg Stone Circle]]]]
[[File:MaloneHoard.JPG|thumb|200px|left|The Malone hoard of polished axes from [[Tievebulliagh]] or [[Rathlin Island]]]]

The Langdale industry was one of many which extracted hard stone for manufacture into polished axes. The Neolithic period was a time of settlement on the land, and the development of farming on a large scale. Maintenance of the forest cover was necessary in order to plant crops and rear animals, so axes were a staple tool, not just for clearance but also for wood working timber for houses, boats and other structures. [[Flint]] was probably the most widely used, simply because it was available from numerous flint mines in the [[downland]]s, such as [[Grimes Graves]], [[Cissbury]] and [[Spiennes]]. Blades from roughing-out from flint and [[chert]] could also be used as small knives, arrowheads and other small sharp tools such as [[Burin (lithic flake)|burin]]s and [[Stitching awl|awl]]s.

[[File:Mount William Aboriginal stone axe quarry.jpg|thumb|[[Mount William stone axe quarry]] in Australia where stone axes were made in recent times]]
[[File:horsne dibjars i.jpg|thumb|Grooves used for polishing the edges of stone axes, [[Gotland]], Sweden]]
But other hard and tough stones were used, such as [[igneous rock]]s from [[Penmaenmawr]] in [[North Wales]], and similar working areas to Langdale have been found there. Many other locations for production of axes have been suggested (but not always found) across the country including [[Tievebulliagh]] in [[County Antrim]], sites in [[Cornwall]], [[Scotland]] and the [[Charnwood Forest]] in [[Leicestershire]]. It is also likely that [[bluestone]] axes were exported from the [[Preseli hills]] in [[Pembrokeshire]]. The industry was also widely developed elsewhere in the world, such as in Australia at [[Mount William stone axe quarry]] which used a similar rock until relatively recent times.
The variety of rocks used in polished tools and other artefacts is evident in museum collections, not all of the sources of the rocks having been positively identified. Taking sections is necessarily destructive of part of the artefact, and thus discouraged by many museums. Likewise, the rocks or anvils used to polish the axes are rare in Britain but common in France and Sweden.

[[Radiocarbon dating]] at the Langdale stone axe factory site suggests that it was in operation for about 1,000 years during the Neolithic period.

Current thinking links the manufacturers of the axes to some of the first Neolithic [[stone circle]]s such as that at [[Castlerigg stone circle|Castlerigg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://heritageaction.wordpress.com/category/ancient-monuments/|title=Ancient monuments - The Heritage Journal|work=wordpress.com|accessdate=24 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eyeofthepsychic.com/lakeland/ Article on Castlerigg and the axe industry of Langdale]
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation==
The altitude and rough terrain of the archaeological sites have protected them from types of damage caused by human settlement in lowland areas.  However, Great Langdale is much visited by walkers. People have removed axes (although current thinking is that they should be left in situ) and have caused inadvertent damage to stone scatters by walking. 

An attempt to schedule the sites as ancient monuments in the 1980s was thwarted by the lack of reliable mapping.&lt;ref name="OA"/&gt; However, English Heritage has been considering questions on how the sites should be managed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/caring/listing/scheduled-monuments/national-importance-programme/|title=National Importance Programme|work=english-heritage.org.uk|accessdate=24 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particular attention has been paid to the siting of footpaths to avoid damage to axeworking sites.&lt;ref name="OA"&gt;[https://library.thehumanjourney.net/1574/1/AxeworkingsitesonpathrenewalFullReport.pdf Axeworking sites on path renewal schemes]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Since the 1990s eroded paths in the Lake District, including Great Langdale, have been repaired by a "Fix the Fells" project in which the [[National Trust]] is the major partner.

Langdale axes are displayed in Cumbria at [[Kendal Museum]] and [[Tullie House Museum and Art Gallery]], Carlisle,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tulliehouse.co.uk/collections/stone-axes information about the stone axes that the Tullie House Museum has in its collection]
&lt;/ref&gt; and in other collections such as the British Museum.

'''Leadership''' is both a research area and a practical skill encompassing the ability of an individual or [[organization]] to "lead" or guide other individuals, [[team]]s, or entire [[organization]]s.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Specialist literature debates various viewpoints, contrasting [[Eastern world|Eastern]] and [[Western world|Western]] approaches to leadership, and also (within the West) United States versus European approaches. U.S. academic environments define leadership as "a process of [[social influence]] in which a person can enlist the aid and [[Peer support|support]] of others in the accomplishment of a common [[task (project management)|task]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= An integrative theory of leadership|last= Chemers|first= M.|publisher= Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Publishers|year= 1997|isbn= 978-0-8058-2679-1|location= |pages= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chin 2015"&gt;{{Cite journal|last= Chin|first= Roger|year= 2015|title= Examining teamwork and leadership in the fields of public administration, leadership, and management|journal= Team Performance Management|volume= 21|issue= 3/4|pages= 199–216|doi= 10.1108/TPM-07-2014-0037}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leadership studies|Studies of leadership]] have produced theories involving [[Trait leadership|trait]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLocke1991|Locke et al. 1991]]&lt;/ref&gt; situational interaction, function, behavior,&lt;ref&gt;Goldsmith Marshall, [http://www.designtoolbox.co.uk/strategies/leaders-make-values-visible/ "Leaders Make Values Visible"], 2016&lt;/ref&gt; [[Power (social and political)|power]], [[goal|vision]] and [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]],&lt;ref&gt;
Richards &amp; Engle, 1986, p. 206&lt;/ref&gt; [[charisma]], and intelligence, among others.&lt;ref name="Chin 2015"/&gt;

==Historical views==
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2009}}
[[File:Portrait of Niccolò Machiavelli by Santi di Tito.jpg|thumb| [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]'s ''[[The Prince]]'' argues that it is better to be feared than loved.]]
[[Sanskrit]] literature identifies ten types of leaders. Defining characteristics of the ten types of leaders are explained with examples from history and mythology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sanskrit Text Book -9th Grade|publisher=Government of Karnataka, India|author=KSEEB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristocracy|Aristocratic]] thinkers have postulated that leadership depends on one's "blue blood" or [[gene]]s. [[Monarchy]] takes an extreme view of the same idea, and may prop up its assertions against the claims of mere aristocrats by invoking divine sanction (see the [[Divine Right of Kings|divine right of kings]]). Contrariwise, more democratically inclined theorists have pointed to examples of [[meritocracy|meritocratic]] leaders, such as the [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleonic]] marshals profiting from [[career]]s open to [[skill|talent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Transformation Of An Individual Family Community Nation And The World|last=Cano, PE|first=Librado F.|publisher=Trafford Publishing|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=134|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8D8sanxRQR8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[autocracy|autocratic]]/[[paternalism|paternalistic]] strain of thought, traditionalists recall the role of leadership of the Roman ''[[pater familias]]''. [[Feminism|Feminist]] thinking, on the other hand, may object to such models as [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] and posit against them emotionally attuned, responsive, and consensual [[empathy|empathetic]] guidance, which is sometimes associated with [[matriarchy|matriarchies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Human Behaviour|last1=Singh|first1=Ravinder|first2=Ajita|last2=Rani|publisher=Notion Press|year=2017|isbn=978-1-946983-31-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparable to the Roman tradition, the views of [[Confucianism]] on "right living" relate very much to the ideal of the (male) scholar-leader and his benevolent rule, buttressed by a tradition of filial piety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Principles of Management, A Modern Approach|last=Saxena Dr.|first=P.K.|publisher=Global India Publications PVT LTD|year=2009|isbn=978-81-907941-5-2|location=New Delhi|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Leadership is a matter of intelligence, trustworthiness, humaneness, courage, and discipline ... Reliance on intelligence alone results in rebelliousness. Exercise of humaneness alone results in weakness. Fixation on trust results in folly. Dependence on the strength of courage results in violence. Excessive discipline and sternness in command result in cruelty. When one has all five virtues together, each appropriate to its function, then one can be a leader. — [[Sun Tzu]]&lt;ref&gt;''The 100 Greatest Leadership Principles of All Time'', edited by Leslie Pockell with Adrienne Avila, 2007, Warner Books&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Machiavelli's ''[[The Prince]]'', written in the early 16th century, provided a manual for [[Ruler (potentate)|rulers]] ("princes" or "tyrants" in Machiavelli's terminology) to gain and keep [[Power (social and political)|power]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;In the 19th century the elaboration of [[anarchism|anarchist]] thought called the whole concept of leadership into question. (Note that the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' traces the word "leadership" in English only as far back as the 19th century.) One response to this denial of [[élitism]] came with [[Leninism]], which demanded an élite group of disciplined [[professional revolutionaries|cadres]] to act as the [[vanguard party|vanguard]] of a socialist revolution, bringing into existence the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]].

Other historical views of leadership have addressed the seeming contrasts between secular and religious leadership. The doctrines of [[Caesaro-papism]] have recurred and had their detractors over several centuries. Christian thinking on leadership has often emphasized [[stewardship]] of divinely provided resources—human and material—and their deployment in accordance with a Divine plan.

==Theories==

===Early western history===

The search for the characteristics or traits of leaders has continued for centuries. Philosophical writings from [[Plato]]'s ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''&lt;ref&gt;
Benjamin Jowett's translation of Plato's ''Republic'' does not use the word "leadership"; Plato discusses primarily a "[[Philosopher king|guardian]]" class. See {{cite book| author = Plato| author-link1 = Plato| title = The Dialogues of Plato translated into English with Analyses and Introductions by B. Jowett, M.A.| url                   = http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/767| volume = 3| publisher = Oxford University Press| date = 1892| accessdate = 2014-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Plutarch's]] ''[[Parallel Lives|Lives]]'' have explored the question "What qualities distinguish an individual as a leader?" Underlying this search was the early recognition of the importance of leadership&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/business-learn-from-ancient-philosophers|title=What can business leaders learn from ancient philosophers?|last=Network|first=Jules Evans for the Guardian Professional|date=2012-05-04|newspaper=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the assumption that leadership is rooted in the characteristics that certain individuals possess. This idea that leadership is based on individual attributes is known as the "[[trait leadership|trait theory of leadership]]".

A number of works in the 19th century – when the traditional authority of monarchs, lords and bishops had begun to wane – explored the trait theory at length: note especially the writings of [[Thomas Carlyle]] and of [[Francis Galton]], whose works have prompted decades of research. In ''Heroes and Hero Worship'' (1841), Carlyle identified the talents, skills, and physical characteristics of men who rose to power. Galton's ''Hereditary Genius'' (1869) examined leadership qualities in the families of powerful men. After showing that the numbers of eminent relatives dropped off when his focus moved from first-degree to second-degree relatives, Galton concluded that leadership was inherited. In other words, leaders were born, not developed. Both of these notable works lent great initial support for the notion that leadership is rooted in characteristics of a leader.

[[Cecil Rhodes]] (1853–1902) believed that public-spirited leadership could be nurtured by identifying young people with "moral force of character and instincts to lead", and educating them in contexts (such as the collegiate environment of the [[University of Oxford]]) which further developed such characteristics. International networks of such leaders could help to promote international understanding and help "render war impossible". This vision of leadership underlay the creation of the [[Rhodes Scholarships]], which have helped to shape notions of leadership since their creation in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Donald Markwell]], ''"Instincts to Lead": On Leadership, Peace, and Education'', Connor Court: Australia, 2013. {{ISBN|9781922168702}} {{cite web |url=http://www.connorcourt.com/catalog1/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=256 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-12-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222013842/http://www.connorcourt.com/catalog1/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=256 |archivedate=2017-02-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rise of alternative theories===

In the late 1940s and early 1950s, a series of qualitative reviews of these studies (e.g., Bird, 1940;&lt;ref&gt;Bird, C. (1940). ''Social Psychology''. New York: Appleton-Century.&lt;/ref&gt; Stogdill, 1948;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stogdill | first1 = R. M. | year = 1948 | title = Personal factors associated with leadership: A survey of the literature | url = | journal = Journal of Psychology | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 35–71 | doi=10.1080/00223980.1948.9917362| pmid = 18901913 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mann, 1959&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mann | first1 = R. D. | year = 1959 | title = A review of the relationship between personality and performance in small groups | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 56 | issue = 4| pages = 241–270 | doi=10.1037/h0044587}}&lt;/ref&gt;) prompted researchers to take a drastically different view of the driving forces behind leadership. In reviewing the extant literature, Stogdill and Mann found that while some traits were common across a number of studies, the overall evidence suggested that persons who are leaders in one situation may not necessarily be leaders in other situations. Subsequently, leadership was no longer characterized as an enduring individual trait, as situational approaches (see alternative leadership theories below) posited that individuals can be effective in certain situations, but not others. The focus then shifted away from traits of leaders to an investigation of the leader behaviors that were effective. This approach dominated much of the leadership theory and research for the next few decades.

===Reemergence of trait theory===

New methods and measurements were developed after these influential reviews that would ultimately reestablish [[trait theory]] as a viable approach to the study of leadership. For example, improvements in researchers' use of the round robin research design methodology allowed researchers to see that individuals can and do emerge as leaders across a variety of situations and tasks.&lt;ref name="Kenny, D.A. 1983"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kenny | first1 = D. A. | last2 = Zaccaro | first2 = S. J. | year = 1983 | title = An estimate of variance due to traits in leadership | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 68 | issue = 4| pages = 678–685 | doi=10.1037/0021-9010.68.4.678}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, during the 1980s statistical advances allowed researchers to conduct [[meta-analysis|meta-analyses]], in which they could quantitatively analyze and summarize the findings from a wide array of studies. This advent allowed trait theorists to create a comprehensive picture of previous leadership research rather than rely on the qualitative reviews of the past. Equipped with new methods, leadership researchers revealed the following:
* Individuals can and do emerge as leaders across a variety of situations and tasks.&lt;ref name="Kenny, D.A. 1983"/&gt;
* Significant relationships exist between leadership emergence and such individual traits as:

While the trait theory of leadership has certainly regained popularity, its reemergence has not been accompanied by a corresponding increase in sophisticated conceptual frameworks.&lt;ref name="Zaccaro, S. J. 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zaccaro | first1 = S. J. | year = 2007 | title = Trait-based perspectives of leadership | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 62 | issue = 1| pages = 6–16 | doi=10.1037/0003-066x.62.1.6| pmid = 17209675 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.475.9808 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, Zaccaro (2007)&lt;ref name="Zaccaro, S. J. 2007"/&gt; noted that trait theories still:
* Focus on a small set of individual attributes such as "The Big Five" personality traits, to the neglect of cognitive abilities, motives, values, social skills, expertise, and problem-solving skills.
* Fail to consider patterns or integrations of multiple attributes.
* Do not distinguish between the leadership attributes that are generally not malleable over time and those that are shaped by, and bound to, situational influences.
* Do not consider how stable leader attributes account for the behavioral diversity necessary for effective leadership.

===Attribute pattern approach===

Considering the criticisms of the trait theory outlined above, several researchers have begun to adopt a different perspective of leader individual differences—the leader attribute pattern approach.&lt;ref name="Foti, R.J. 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Foti | first1 = R. J. | last2 = Hauenstein | first2 = N. M.

D. 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Magnusson, D. (1995). "Holistic interactionism: A perspective for research on personality development". In L. A. Pervin &amp; O. P. John (Eds.), ''Handbook of personality: Theory and research'' (pp. 219–247). New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the leader attribute pattern approach argues that integrated constellations or combinations of individual differences may explain substantial variance in both leader emergence and leader effectiveness beyond that explained by single attributes, or by additive combinations of multiple attributes..

===Behavioral and style theories===
{{Main article|Managerial grid model}}

In response to the early criticisms of the trait approach, theorists began to research leadership as a set of behaviors, evaluating the behavior of successful leaders, determining a behavior taxonomy, and identifying broad leadership styles.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSpillane2004|Spillane (2004)]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[David McClelland]], for example, posited that leadership takes a strong personality with a well-developed positive ego. To lead, self-confidence and high self-esteem are useful, perhaps even essential.&lt;ref&gt;Horton, Thomas. New York: ''The CEO Paradox'' (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Management Grid.PNG|right|thumb|200px|A graphical representation of the managerial grid model]]

[[Kurt Lewin]], Ronald Lipitt, and Ralph White developed in 1939 the seminal work on the influence of leadership styles and performance. The researchers evaluated the performance of groups of eleven-year-old boys under different types of work climate. In each, the leader exercised his influence regarding the type of [[group decision making]], [[praise]] and [[criticism]] ([[feedback]]), and the management of the group tasks ([[project management]]) according to three styles: [[Leadership#Autocratic or authoritarian style|authoritarian]], [[Leadership#Participative or democratic|democratic]], and [[Leadership#Laissez-faire or free rein style|laissez-faire]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLewin1939|Lewin et al. (1939)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, Ohio State University conducted a study which investigated observable behaviors portrayed by effective leaders, They would then identify if these particular behaviors reflective in leadership effectiveness. They were able to narrow their findings to two identifiable distinctions &lt;ref&gt;"Ohio State Leadership Studies Explained with Examples"(2017)&lt;/ref&gt; The first dimension was identified as "Initiating Structure", which described how a leader clearly and accurately communicates with their followers, defines goals, and determine how tasks are performed. These are considered "task oriented" behaviors The second dimension is "Consideration", which indicates the leader's ability to build an interpersonal relationship with their followers, to establish a form of mutual trust. These are considered "social oriented" behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;AAmodt (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Michigan State Studies, which were conducted in the 1950s, made further investigations and findings that positively correlated behaviors and leadership effectiveness. Although they similar findings as the Ohio State studies, they did contribute an additional behavior identified in leaders. This was participative behavior; allowing the followers to participate in group decision making and encouraged subordinate input. Another term used to describe this is "Servant Leadership", which entails the leader to reject a more controlling type of leadership and allow more personal interaction between themselves and their subordinates.&lt;ref&gt;Stoker (2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

The managerial grid model is also based on a behavioral theory. The model was developed by [[Robert Blake (management)|Robert Blake]] and [[Jane Mouton]] in 1964 and suggests five different leadership styles, based on the leaders' concern for people and their concern for goal achievement.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBlake1964|Blake et al. (1964)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Positive reinforcement====
[[B. F. Skinner]] is the father of [[behavior modification]] and developed the concept of [[positive reinforcement]]. Positive reinforcement occurs when a positive stimulus is presented in response to a behavior, increasing the likelihood of that behavior in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Miltenberger, R. G., (2004). ''Behavior Modification Principles and Procedures'' (3rd ed). Belmont, California: Wadsworth/Thomson Learning.&lt;/ref&gt; The following is an example of how positive reinforcement can be used in a business setting. Assume [[praise]] is a positive reinforcer for a particular employee. This employee does not show up to work on time every day. The manager of this employee decides to praise the employee for showing up on time every day the employee actually shows up to work on time. As a result, the employee comes to work on time more often because the employee likes to be praised. In this example, praise (the stimulus) is a positive reinforcer for this employee because the employee arrives at work on time (the behavior) more frequently after being praised for showing up to work on time.

The use of positive reinforcement is a successful and growing technique used by leaders to motivate and attain desired behaviors from subordinates. Organizations such as Frito-Lay, 3M, Goodrich, Michigan Bell, and Emery Air Freight have all used reinforcement to increase productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Lussier, R. N., &amp; Achua, C. F., (2010). ''Leadership, Theory, Application, &amp; Skill Development.''(4th ed). Mason, Ohio: South-Western Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt; Empirical research covering the last 20 years suggests that [[reinforcement theory]] has a 17 percent increase in performance. Additionally, many reinforcement techniques such as the use of praise are inexpensive, providing higher performance for lower costs.

===Situational and contingency theories===
{{Main article|Fiedler contingency model|Vroom–Yetton decision model|path–goal theory|situational leadership theory}}

[[Situational leadership theory|Situational theory]] also appeared as a reaction to the trait theory of leadership. [[social science|Social scientists]] argued that history was more than the result of intervention of great men as [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] suggested. [[Herbert Spencer]] (1884) (and [[Karl Marx]]) said that the times produce the person and not the other way around.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSpencer1841|Spencer (1884)]], apud [[#refHeifetz1994|Heifetz (1994)]], p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; This theory assumes that different situations call for different characteristics; according to this group of theories, no single optimal psychographic profile of a leader exists. According to the theory, "what an individual actually does when acting as a leader is in large part dependent upon characteristics of the situation in which he functions."&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHemphill1949|Hemphill (1949)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some theorists started to synthesize the trait and situational approaches. Building upon the research of Lewin et al., academics began to normalize the descriptive models of leadership climates, defining three leadership styles and identifying which situations each style works better in. The authoritarian leadership style, for example, is approved in periods of crisis but fails to win the "hearts and minds" of followers in day-to-day management; the democratic leadership style is more adequate in situations that require consensus building; finally, the laissez-faire leadership style is appreciated for the degree of freedom it provides, but as the leaders do not "take charge", they can be perceived as a failure in protracted or thorny organizational problems.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refWormer2007|Wormer et al. (2007)]], p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, theorists defined the style of leadership as contingent to the situation, which is sometimes classified as contingency theory. Four contingency leadership theories appear more prominently in recent years: Fiedler contingency model, Vroom-Yetton decision model, the path-goal theory, and the Hersey-Blanchard situational theory.

The [[Fiedler contingency model]] bases the leader's effectiveness on what [[Fred Fiedler]] called ''situational contingency''. This results from the interaction of leadership style and situational favorability (later called ''situational control''). The theory defined two types of leader: those who tend to accomplish the task by developing good relationships with the group (relationship-oriented), and those who have as their prime concern carrying out the task itself (task-oriented).&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFiedler1967|Fiedler (1967)]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Fiedler, there is no ideal leader. Both task-oriented and relationship-oriented leaders can be effective if their leadership orientation fits the situation. When there is a good leader-member relation, a highly structured task, and high leader position power, the situation is considered a "favorable situation". Fiedler found that task-oriented leaders are more effective in extremely favorable or unfavorable situations, whereas relationship-oriented leaders perform best in situations with intermediate favorability.

[[Victor Vroom]], in collaboration with Phillip Yetton (1973)&lt;ref&gt;[[#refVroom1973|Vroom, Yetton (1973)]]&lt;/ref&gt; and later with Arthur Jago (1988),&lt;ref&gt;[[#refVroom1988|Vroom, Jago (1988)]]&lt;/ref&gt; developed a [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] for describing leadership situations, which was used in a normative [[Vroom-Yetton decision model|decision model]] where leadership styles were connected to situational variables, defining which approach was more suitable to which situation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSternberg2002|Sternberg, Vroom (2002)]]&lt;/ref&gt; This approach was novel because it supported the idea that the same manager could rely on different [[group decision making]] approaches depending on the attributes of each situation. This model was later referred to as situational contingency theory.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLorsch1974|Lorsch (1974)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[path-goal theory]] of leadership was developed by Robert House (1971) and was based on the [[expectancy theory]] of [[Victor Vroom]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHouse1971|House (1971)]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to House, the essence of the theory is "the meta proposition that leaders, to be effective, engage in behaviors that complement subordinates' environments and abilities in a manner that compensates for deficiencies and is instrumental to subordinate satisfaction and individual and work unit performance".&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHouse1996|House (1996)]]&lt;/ref&gt; The theory identifies four leader behaviors, ''achievement-oriented'', ''directive'', ''participative'', and ''supportive'', that are contingent to the environment factors and follower characteristics. In contrast to the [[Fiedler contingency model]], the path-goal model states that the four leadership behaviors are fluid, and that leaders can adopt any of the four depending on what the situation demands. The path-goal model can be classified both as a [[Contingency leadership theory|contingency theory]], as it depends on the circumstances, and as a [[Transactional leadership|transactional leadership theory]], as the theory emphasizes the reciprocity behavior between the leader and the followers.

The [[Hersey-Blanchard situational theory|Situational Leadership® Model]] proposed by Hersey suggests four leadership-styles and four levels of follower-development. For effectiveness, the model posits that the leadership-style must match the appropriate level of follower-development. In this model, leadership behavior becomes a function not only of the characteristics of the leader, but of the characteristics of followers as well.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHersey2008|Hersey et al. (2008)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Functional theory===
{{Main article|Functional leadership model}}
[[File:Defense.gov News Photo 100805-F-7552L-211 - Commander of the International Security Assistance Force Gen. David H. Petraeus center U.S. Army talks with U.S. soldiers of the 2nd Battalion.jpg|thumb|250px|General Petraeus talks with U.S. soldiers serving in Afghanistan]]
Functional leadership theory (Hackman &amp; Walton, 1986; [[McGrath]], 1962; Adair, 1988; Kouzes &amp; Posner, 1995) is a particularly useful theory for addressing specific leader behaviors expected to contribute to organizational or unit effectiveness. This theory argues that the leader's main job is to see that whatever is necessary to group needs is taken care of; thus, a leader can be said to have done their job well when they have contributed to group effectiveness and cohesion (Fleishman et al., 1991; Hackman &amp; Wageman, 2005; Hackman &amp; Walton, 1986). While functional leadership theory has most often been applied to team leadership (Zaccaro, Rittman, &amp; Marks, 2001), it has also been effectively applied to broader organizational leadership as well (Zaccaro, 2001). In summarizing literature on functional leadership (see Kozlowski et al. (1996), Zaccaro et al. (2001), Hackman and Walton (1986), Hackman &amp; Wageman (2005), Morgeson (2005)), Klein, Zeigert, Knight, and Xiao (2006) observed five broad functions a leader performs when promoting organization's effectiveness. These functions include environmental monitoring, organizing subordinate activities, teaching and coaching subordinates, motivating others, and intervening actively in the group's work.

A variety of leadership behaviors are expected to facilitate these functions. In initial work identifying leader behavior, Fleishman (1953) observed that subordinates perceived their supervisors' behavior in terms of two broad categories referred to as [[consideration and initiating structure]]. Consideration includes behavior involved in fostering effective relationships. Examples of such behavior would include showing concern for a subordinate or acting in a supportive manner towards others. Initiating structure involves the actions of the leader focused specifically on task accomplishment. This could include role clarification, setting performance standards, and holding subordinates accountable to those standards.

===Integrated psychological theory===
{{Main article|Three Levels of Leadership model}}

The Integrated Psychological theory of leadership is an attempt to integrate the strengths of the older theories (i.e. traits, behavioral/styles, situational and functional) while addressing their limitations, largely by introducing a new element – the need for leaders to develop their leadership presence, attitude toward others and behavioral flexibility by practicing psychological mastery. It also offers a foundation for leaders wanting to apply the philosophies of [[servant leadership]] and [[authentic leadership]].&lt;ref&gt;Businessballs management information website – Leadership Theories page, "Integrated Psychological Approach" section: http://www.businessballs.com/leadership-theories.htm#integrated-psychological-leadership&lt;/ref&gt;

Integrated Psychological theory began to attract attention after the publication of James Scouller's [[Three Levels of Leadership model]] (2011).&lt;ref&gt;Scouller, J. (2011). ''The Three Levels of Leadership: How to Develop Your Leadership Presence, Knowhow and Skill''. Cirencester: Management Books 2000., {{ISBN|9781852526818}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Scouller argued that the older theories offer only limited assistance in developing a person's ability to lead effectively.&lt;ref&gt;Scouller, J. (2011), pp. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt;
He pointed out, for example, that:
* Traits theories, which tend to reinforce the idea that leaders are born not made, might help us select leaders, but they are less useful for developing leaders.
* An ideal style (e.g. Blake &amp; Mouton's team style) would not suit all circumstances.
* Most of the situational/contingency and functional theories assume that leaders can change their behavior to meet differing circumstances or widen their behavioral range at will, when in practice many find it hard to do so because of unconscious beliefs, fears or ingrained habits. Thus, he argued, leaders need to work on their inner psychology.
* None of the old theories successfully address the challenge of developing "[[Three Levels of Leadership model#Leadership presence|leadership presence]]"; that certain "something" in leaders that commands attention, inspires people, wins their trust and makes followers want to work with them.

Scouller proposed the Three Levels of Leadership model, which was later categorized as an "Integrated Psychological" theory on the Businessballs education website.&lt;ref&gt;Businessballs information website: Leadership Theories Page, Integrated Psychological Approach section. Businessballs.com.: http://www.businessballs.com/leadership-theories.htm#integrated-psychological-leadership 2012-02-24. Retrieved 2012-08-15&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, his model aims to summarize what leaders have to do, not only to bring leadership to their group or organization, but also to develop themselves technically and psychologically as leaders.

The three levels in his model are Public, Private and Personal leadership:
* The first two – public and private leadership – are "outer" or behavioral levels. These are the behaviors that address what Scouller called "the four dimensions of leadership". These dimensions are: (1) a shared, motivating group purpose; (2) action, progress and results; (3) collective unity or team spirit; (4) individual selection and motivation. [[Three Levels of Leadership model#Public leadership|Public leadership]] focuses on the 34 behaviors involved in influencing two or more people simultaneously. [[Three Levels of Leadership model#Private leadership|Private leadership]] covers the 14 behaviors needed to influence individuals one to one.
* The third – [[Three Levels of Leadership model#Personal leadership|personal leadership]] – is an "inner" level and concerns a person's growth toward greater leadership presence, knowhow and skill. Working on one's personal leadership has three aspects: (1) Technical knowhow and skill (2) Developing the right attitude toward other people – which is the basis of servant leadership (3) Psychological self-mastery – the foundation for authentic leadership.

Scouller argued that self-mastery is the key to growing one's leadership presence, building trusting relationships with followers and dissolving one's limiting beliefs and habits, thereby enabling behavioral flexibility as circumstances change, while staying connected to one's core values (that is, while remaining authentic). To support leaders' development, he introduced a new model of the human psyche and outlined the principles and techniques of self-mastery, which include the practice of [[Mindfulness#Mindfulness meditation in organizations|mindfulness meditation]].&lt;ref&gt;Scouller, J. (2011), pp. 137–237.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transactional and transformational theories===
{{Main article|Transactional leadership|Transformational leadership}}

Bernard Bass and colleagues developed the idea of two different types of leadership, transactional that involves exchange of labor for rewards and transformational which is based on concern for employees, intellectual stimulation, and providing a group vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bass | first1 = B. M. | last2 = Avolio | first2 = B. J. | last3 = Atwater | first3 = L. E. | year = 1996 | title = The transformational and transactional leadership of men and women | url = | journal = Applied Psychology: An International Review | volume = 45 | issue = | pages = 5–34 | doi=10.1111/j.1464-0597.1996.tb00847.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bass, B. M., &amp; Riggio, R. E. (2006). ''Transformational leadership'' (2nd ed.). Mahwah, New Jersey: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Publishers; US.&lt;/ref&gt;

The transactional leader ([[James MacGregor Burns|Burns]], 1978)&lt;ref name="Burns"&gt;{{cite book| last = Burns| first = J. M.| authorlink =James MacGregor Burns| title = Leadership| publisher = Harper and Row Publishers Inc.| year = 1978| location = New York| isbn = 978-0060105884}}&lt;/ref&gt; is given power to perform certain tasks and reward or punish for the team's performance. It gives the opportunity to the manager to lead the group and the group agrees to follow his lead to accomplish a predetermined goal in exchange for something else. Power is given to the leader to evaluate, correct, and train subordinates when productivity is not up to the desired level, and reward effectiveness when expected outcome is reached.

===Leader–member exchange theory===
{{Main article|Leader–member exchange theory}}
This LMX theory addresses a specific aspect of the leadership process is the leader–member exchange (LMX) theory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Graen | first1 = G. B. | last2 = Novak | first2 = M. A. | last3 = Sommerkamp | first3 = P. | year = 1982 | title = The effects of leader-member exchange and job design on productivity and satisfaction: Testing a dual attachment model | url = | journal = Organizational Behavior &amp; Human Performance | volume = 30 | issue = 1| pages = 109–131 | doi = 10.1016/0030-5073(82)90236-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which evolved from an earlier theory called the vertical dyad linkage (VDL) model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dansereau | first1 = F. | last2 = Graen | first2 = G. | last3 = Haga | first3 = W. J. | year = 1975 | title = A vertical dyad linkage approach to leadership within formal organizations: A longitudinal investigation of the role making process | url = | journal = Organizational Behavior &amp; Human Performance | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 46–78 | doi=10.1016/0030-5073(75)90005-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these models focus on the interaction between leaders and individual followers. Similar to the transactional approach, this interaction is viewed as a fair exchange whereby the leader provides certain benefits such as task guidance, advice, support, and/or significant rewards and the followers reciprocate by giving the leader respect, cooperation, commitment to the task and good performance. However, LMX recognizes that leaders and individual followers will vary in the type of exchange that develops between them.&lt;ref name="Howell, Jon P."&gt;{{cite book|last=Howell|first=Jon P.|title=Snapshots of Great Leadership|year=2012|publisher=Taylor and Francis|location=London, GBR|isbn=9780203103210|pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; LMX theorizes that the type of exchanges between the leader and specific followers can lead to the creation of ''in-groups'' and ''out-groups''. In-group members are said to have ''high-quality exchanges'' with the leader, while out-group members have ''low-quality exchanges'' with the leader.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book|last=Howell|first=Jon P.|title=Snapshots of Great Leadership|year=2012|publisher=Taylor and Francis|location=London, GBR|isbn=9780203103210|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====In-group members====

[[In-group]] members are perceived by the leader as being more experienced, competent, and willing to assume responsibility than other followers. The leader begins to rely on these individuals to help with especially challenging tasks. If the follower responds well, the leader rewards him/her with extra coaching, favorable job assignments, and developmental experiences. If the follower shows high commitment and effort followed by additional rewards, both parties develop mutual trust, influence, and support of one another. Research shows the in-group members usually receive higher performance evaluations from the leader, higher satisfaction, and faster promotions than out-group members.&lt;ref name="Howell, Jon P."/&gt; In-group members are also likely to build stronger bonds with their leaders by sharing the same social backgrounds and interests.

====Out-group members====

[[Ingroups and outgroups|Out-group]] members often receive less time and more distant exchanges than their in-group counterparts. With out-group members, leaders expect no more than adequate [[job performance]], good attendance, reasonable respect, and adherence to the job description in exchange for a [[living wage|fair wage]] and standard benefits. The leader spends less time with out-group members, they have fewer developmental experiences, and the leader tends to emphasize his/her formal authority to obtain compliance to leader requests. Research shows that out-group members are less satisfied with their job and organization, receive lower performance evaluations from the leader, see their leader as less fair, and are more likely to file grievances or leave the organization.&lt;ref name="Howell, Jon P."/&gt;

===Emotions===
{{see also|Emotional intelligence}}
Leadership can be perceived as a particularly emotion-laden process, with emotions entwined with the social influence process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = George | first1 = J. M. | year = 2000 | title = Emotions and leadership: The role of emotional intelligence | url = | journal = Human Relations | volume = 53 | issue = 8| pages = 1027–1055 | doi=10.1177/0018726700538001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an organization, the leader's mood has some effects on his/her group. These effects can be described in three levels:&lt;ref name=cote&gt;{{cite journal| last=Sy | first=T.| last2=Cote | first2=S.| last3=Saavedra | first3=R.| year=2005| title=The contagious leader: Impact of the leader's mood on the mood of group members, group affective tone, and group processes| journal=Journal of Applied Psychology| volume=90 | issue=2| pages=295–305| url=http://www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/~scote/SyetalJAP.pdf| doi=10.1037/0021-9010.90.2.295| pmid=15769239}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The mood of individual group members. Group members with leaders in a positive mood experience more positive mood than do group members with leaders in a negative mood. The leaders transmit their moods to other group members through the mechanism of [[emotional contagion]].&lt;ref name=cote/&gt; Mood contagion may be one of the psychological mechanisms by which [[charismatic]] leaders influence followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bono | first1 = J. E. | last2 = Ilies | first2 = R. | year = 2006 | title = Charisma, positive emotions and mood contagion | url = | journal = The Leadership Quarterly | volume = 17 | issue = 4| pages = 317–334 | doi=10.1016/j.leaqua.2006.04.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The affective tone of the group. [[Group affective tone]] represents the consistent or homogeneous affective reactions within a group. Group affective tone is an aggregate of the moods of the individual members of the group and refers to mood at the group level of analysis. Groups with leaders in a positive mood have a more positive affective tone than do groups with leaders in a negative mood.&lt;ref name=cote/&gt;
# Group processes like coordination, effort expenditure, and [[Task (project management)|task]] [[strategy]]. Public expressions of mood impact how group members think and act. When people experience and express mood, they send signals to others. Leaders signal their goals, intentions, and attitudes through their expressions of moods. For example, expressions of positive moods by leaders signal that leaders deem progress toward goals to be good. The group members respond to those signals cognitively and behaviorally in ways that are reflected in the group processes.&lt;ref name=cote/&gt;
In research about client service, it was found that expressions of positive mood by the [[leader]] improve the performance of the group, although in other sectors there were other findings.&lt;ref name=george&gt;George J. M. 2006. "Leader Positive Mood and Group Performance: The Case of Customer Service". ''Journal of Applied Social Psychology'' 25(9): pp. 778–794&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond the leader's mood, her/his behavior is a source for employee positive and negative [[emotions]] at work. The leader creates situations and events that lead to emotional response. Certain leader behaviors displayed during interactions with their employees are the sources of these affective events. Leaders shape workplace affective events. Examples – feedback giving, allocating tasks, resource distribution. Since employee behavior and productivity are directly affected by their emotional states, it is imperative to consider employee emotional responses to organizational leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dasborough | first1 = M. T. | year = 2006 | title = Cognitive asymmetry in employee emotional reactions to leadership behaviors | url = | journal = The Leadership Quarterly | volume = 17 | issue = 2| pages = 163–178 | doi=10.1016/j.leaqua.2005.12.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emotional intelligence, the ability to understand and manage moods and emotions in the self and others, contributes to effective leadership within organizations.&lt;ref name=george/&gt;

===Neo-emergent theory===
{{Main article|Functional leadership model}}

The neo-emergent leadership theory (from the Oxford Strategic Leadership Programme) sees leadership as created through the emergence of information by the leader or other stakeholders, not through the true actions of the leader himself.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} In other words, the reproduction of information or [[narrative|stories]] form the basis of the perception of leadership by the majority. It is well known{{by whom|date=August 2014}} that the naval hero [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Lord Nelson]] often wrote his own versions of battles he was involved in, so that when he arrived home in England he would receive a true hero's welcome.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} In modern society, the press, blogs and other sources report their own views of leaders, which may be based on reality, but may also be based on a political command, a payment, or an inherent interest of the author, media, or leader. Therefore, one can argue that the perception of all leaders is created and in fact does not reflect their true leadership qualities at all.

== Leadership emergence ==
Many personality characteristics were found to be reliably associated with leadership emergence.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Group Dynamics|last=Forsyth|first=Donelson|publisher=Wadsworth|year=2010|isbn=|location=Belmont, California|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list include, but is not limited to following (list organized in alphabetical order): assertiveness, authenticity, Big Five personality factors, birth order, character strengths, dominance, emotional intelligence, gender identity, intelligence, narcissism, self-efficacy for leadership, self-monitoring and social motivation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Leadership emergence is the idea that people born with specific characteristics become leaders, and those without these characteristics do not become leaders.  People like Mahatma Gandhi, Abraham Lincoln, and Nelson Mandela all share traits that an average person does not.  This includes people who choose to participate in leadership roles, as opposed to those who do not.  Research indicates that up to 30% of leader emergence has a genetic basis.&lt;ref&gt;Aamodt, M. G. (2010). I/O applications workbook: Industrial/organizational psychology an applied approach. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt;
There is no current research indicating that there is a “leadership gene”, instead we inherit certain traits that might influence our decision to seek leadership.  Both anecdotal, and empirical evidence support a stable relationship between specific traits and leadership behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Law, J. R. (1996). Rising to the occasion: foundations, processes, and outcomes of emergent leadership.&lt;/ref&gt; Using a large international sample researchers found that there are three factors that motivate leaders; affective identity (enjoyment of leading), non-calculative (leading earns reinforcement), and social-normative (sense of obligation).&lt;ref&gt;Chan, K., &amp; Drasgow, F. (2001). Toward a theory of individual differences and leadership: Understanding the motivation to lead. Journal of Applied Psychology, 86(3), 481-498. doi:10.1037/0021-9010.86.3.481&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Assertiveness ===

The relationship between assertiveness and leadership emergence is curvilinear; individuals who are either low in assertiveness or very high in assertiveness are less likely to be identified as leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ames|first=Daniel R.|last2=Flynn|first2=Francis J.|title=What breaks a leader: The curvilinear relation between assertiveness and leadership.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=92|issue=2|pages=307–324|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.92.2.307|pmid=17279851|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Authenticity ===

Individuals who are more aware of their personality qualities, including their values and beliefs, and are less biased when processing self-relevant information, are more likely to be accepted as leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ilies|first=Remus|last2=Morgeson|first2=Frederick P.|last3=Nahrgang|first3=Jennifer D.|date=2005-06-01|title=Authentic leadership and eudaemonic well-being: Understanding leader–follower outcomes|url=https://scholars.opb.msu.edu/en/publications/authentic-leadership-and-eudaemonic-well-being-understanding-lead-2|journal=The Leadership Quarterly|language=en|volume=16|issue=3|pages=373–394|doi=10.1016/j.leaqua.2005.03.002|issn=1048-9843|citeseerx=10.1.1.318.5548}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Authentic leadership|Authentic Leadership]].

=== Big Five personality factors ===

Those who emerge as leaders tend to be more (order in strength of relationship with leadership emergence): extroverted, conscientious, emotionally stable, and open to experience, although these tendencies are stronger in laboratory studies of leaderless groups.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Judge|first=Timothy A.|last2=Bono|first2=Joyce E.|last3=Ilies|first3=Remus|last4=Gerhardt|first4=Megan W.|title=Personality and leadership: A qualitative and quantitative review.|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0021-9010.87.4.765|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|volume=87|issue=4|pages=765–780|doi=10.1037//0021-9010.87.4.765|year=2002|citeseerx=10.1.1.301.9866}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agreeableness, the last factor of the Big Five personality traits, does not seem to play any meaningful role in leadership emergence &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Birth order ===

Those born first in their families and only children are hypothesized to be more driven to seek leadership and control in social settings. Middle-born children tend to accept follower roles in groups, and later-borns are thought to be rebellious and creative &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Character strengths ===

Those seeking leadership positions in a military organization had elevated scores on a number of indicators of strength of character, including honesty, hope, bravery, industry, and teamwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matthews|first=Michael D.|last2=Eid|first2=Jarle|last3=Kelly|first3=Dennis|last4=Bailey|first4=Jennifer K.

=== Dominance ===

Individuals with dominant personalities – they describe themselves as high in the desire to control their environment and influence other people, and are likely to express their opinions in a forceful way – are more likely to act as leaders in small-group situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223344605|title=A pattern approach to leader emergence|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

=== Emotional intelligence ===

Individuals with high emotional intelligence have increased ability to understand and relate to people. They have skills in communicating and decoding emotions and they deal with others wisely and effectively.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Such people communicate their ideas in more robust ways, are better able to read the politics of a situation, are less likely to lose control of their emotions, are less likely to be inappropriately angry or critical, and in consequence are more likely to emerge as leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=New leaders |isbn=9780751533811|oclc=891670377|last1 = Goleman|first1 = Daniel|last2=Boyatzis|first2=Richard E.|last3=McKee|first3=Annie|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender identity ===

Masculine individuals are more likely to emerge as leaders than are feminine individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lord|first=Robert G.|last2=Vader|first2=Christy L. de|last3=Alliger|first3=George M.|title=A meta-analysis of the relation between personality traits and leadership perceptions: An application of validity generalization procedures.|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|volume=71|issue=3|pages=402–410|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.71.3.402|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intelligence ===

Individuals with higher intelligence exhibit superior judgement, higher verbal skills (both written and oral), quicker learning and acquisition of knowledge, and are more likely to emerge as leaders.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Correlation between IQ and leadership emergence was found to be between .25 and .30.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bass &amp; Stogdill's handbook of leadership : theory, research, and managerial applications Bass and Stogdill's handbook of leade.|last=Melvin.|first=Stogdill, Ralph|date=1990-01-01|publisher=Free Press|isbn=9780029015001|oclc=959443394}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, groups generally prefer leaders that do not exceed intelligence prowess of average member by a wide margin, as they fear that high intelligence may be translated to differences in communication, trust, interests and values&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simonton|first=Dean K.|title=Intelligence and personal influence in groups: Four nonlinear models.|journal=Psychological Review|volume=92|issue=4|pages=532–547|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.92.4.532|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Narcissism ===

Individuals who take on leadership roles in turbulent situations, such as groups facing a threat or ones in which status is determined by intense competition among rivals within the group, tend to be narcissistic: arrogant, self-absorbed, hostile, and very self-confident.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223046510|title=Narcissistic Leadership (PDF Download Available)|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-efficacy for leadership ===

Confidence in one's ability to lead is associated with increases in willingness to accept a leadership role and success in that role.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoyt|first=C. L.|last2=Blascovich|first2=J.|date=2016-07-26|title=Leadership Efficacy and Women Leaders' Responses to Stereotype Activation|journal=Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations|language=en|volume=10|issue=4|pages=595–616|doi=10.1177/1368430207084718|url=http://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/handle/document/22845}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-monitoring ===

High self-monitors are more likely to emerge as the leader of a group than are low self-monitors, since they are more concerned with status-enhancement and are more likely to adapt their actions to fit the demands of the situation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222434830|title=Can chameleons lead? (PDF Download Available)|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social motivation ===

Individuals who are both success-oriented and affiliation-oriented, as assessed by projective measures, are more active in group problem-solving settings and are more likely to be elected to positions of leadership in such groups&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sorrentino|first=Richard M.|last2=Field|first2=Nigel|title=Emergent leadership over time: The functional value of positive motivation.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=50|issue=6|pages=1091–1099|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.50.6.1091|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership styles==
{{Main article|Leadership styles}}
A leadership style is a leader's style of providing direction, implementing plans, and motivating people. It is the result of the philosophy, personality, and experience of the leader. Rhetoric specialists have also developed models for understanding leadership ([[Robert Hariman]], ''Political Style'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Hariman]], ''Political Style'', U of Chicago Press, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philippe-Joseph Salazar]], ''L'Hyperpolitique. Technologies politiques De La Domination''&lt;ref&gt;[[Philippe-Joseph Salazar]], ''L'Hyperpolitique. Technologies politiques De La Domination'', Paris, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;).

Different situations call for different leadership styles. In an emergency when there is little time to converge on an agreement and where a designated authority has significantly more experience or expertise than the rest of the team, an autocratic leadership style may be most effective; however, in a highly motivated and aligned team with a homogeneous level of expertise, a more democratic or [[Laissez-faire]] style may be more effective. The style adopted should be the one that most effectively achieves the objectives of the group while balancing the interests of its individual members.&lt;ref name=Lewin&gt;{{cite journal| last=Lewin | first=K.| author-link=Kurt Lewin| last2=Lippitt | first2=R.| last3=White | first3=R. K.| year=1939| title=Patterns of aggressive behavior in experimentally created social climates| journal=Journal of Social Psychology| volume=10| pages=271–301}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A field in which leadership style has gained strong attention is that of military science, recently expressing a holistic and integrated view of leadership, including how a leader's physical presence determines how others perceive that leader. The factors of physical presence are military bearing, physical fitness, confidence, and resilience. The leader's intellectual capacity helps to conceptualize solutions and acquire knowledge to do the job. A leader's conceptual abilities apply agility, judgment, innovation, interpersonal tact, and [[domain knowledge]]. Domain knowledge for leaders encompasses tactical and technical knowledge as well as cultural and geopolitical awareness.&lt;ref&gt;Headquarters, Department of the Army (2006). "Army Leadership. Competent, Confident, and Agile". FM 6-22. Washington, D.C., 12 October 2006 p. 18. Publication available at Army Knowledge Online (www.us.army.mil) and General Dennis J. Reimer Training and Doctrine Digital Library at (www.train.army.mil).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autocratic or authoritarian===

Under the [[autocratic]] leadership style, all decision-making powers are centralized in the leader, as with [[dictator]]s.

Autocratic leaders do not entertain any suggestions or initiatives from subordinates. The autocratic management has been successful as it provides strong motivation to the manager. It permits quick decision-making, as only one person decides for the whole group and keeps each decision to him/herself until he/she feels it needs to be shared with the rest of the group.&lt;ref name=Lewin/&gt;

===Participative or democratic===
The democratic leadership style consists of the leader sharing the decision-making abilities with group members by promoting the interests of the group members and by practicing social equality. This has also been called [[shared leadership]].

=== Laissez-faire or Free-rein ===
In Laissez-faire or free-rein leadership, decision-making is passed on to the sub-ordinates. The sub-ordinates are given complete right and power to make decisions to establish goals and work out the problems or hurdles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317115085|title=(PDF) Modern leadership and management methods for development organizations|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Task-oriented and relationship-oriented===
{{Main article|Task-oriented and relationship-oriented leadership}}
Task-oriented leadership is a style in which the leader is focused on the tasks that need to be performed in order to meet a certain production goal. Task-oriented leaders are generally more concerned with producing a step-by-step solution for given problem or goal, strictly making sure these deadlines are met, results and reaching target outcomes.

Relationship-oriented leadership is a contrasting style in which the leader is more focused on the relationships amongst the group and is generally more concerned with the overall well-being and satisfaction of group members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffin|first=Ronald J. Ebert, Ricky W.|title=Business essentials|year=2010|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-13-705349-0|pages=135–136|edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relationship-oriented leaders emphasize communication within the group, show trust and confidence in group members, and show appreciation for work done.

Task-oriented leaders are typically less concerned with the idea of catering to group members, and more concerned with acquiring a certain solution to meet a production goal. For this reason, they typically are able to make sure that deadlines are met, yet their group members' well-being may suffer. Relationship-oriented leaders are focused on developing the team and the relationships in it. The positives to having this kind of environment are that team members are more motivated and have support. However, the emphasis on relations as opposed to getting a job done might make productivity suffer.

==Leadership differences affected by gender==
{{One source|section|date=February 2013}}
Another factor that covaries with leadership style is whether the person is male or female. When men and women come together in groups, they tend to adopt different leadership styles. Men generally assume an [[:agentic leadership]] style. They are task-oriented, active, decision focused, independent and goal oriented. Women, on the other hand, are generally more communal when they assume a leadership position; they strive to be helpful towards others, warm in relation to others, understanding, and mindful of others' feelings. In general, when women are asked to describe themselves to others in newly formed groups, they emphasize their open, fair, responsible, and pleasant communal qualities. They give advice, offer assurances, and manage conflicts in an attempt to maintain positive relationships among group members. Women connect more positively to group members by smiling, maintaining eye contact and respond tactfully to others' comments. Men, conversely, describe themselves as influential, powerful and proficient at the task that needs to be done. They tend to place more focus on initiating structure within the group, setting standards and objectives, identifying roles, defining responsibilities and standard operating procedures, proposing solutions to problems, monitoring compliance with procedures, and finally, emphasizing the need for productivity and efficiency in the work that needs to be done. As leaders, men are primarily task-oriented, but women tend to be both task- and relationship-oriented. However, it is important to note that these sex differences are only tendencies, and do not manifest themselves within men and women across all groups and situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forsyth|first=D. R.|title=Group dynamics|year=2009|publisher=Wadsworth|location=New York|isbn=978-0495599524}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance==
In the past, some researchers have argued that the actual influence of leaders on organizational outcomes is overrated and romanticized as a result of biased attributions about leaders (Meindl &amp; Ehrlich, 1987). Despite these assertions, however, it is largely recognized and accepted by practitioners and researchers that leadership is important, and research supports the notion that leaders do contribute to key organizational outcomes (Day &amp; Lord, 1988; Kaiser, Hogan, &amp; Craig, 2008). To facilitate successful performance it is important to understand and accurately measure leadership performance.

Job performance generally refers to behavior that is expected to contribute to organizational success (Campbell, 1990). Campbell identified a number of specific types of performance dimensions; leadership was one of the dimensions that he identified. There is no consistent, overall definition of leadership performance (Yukl, 2006). Many distinct conceptualizations are often lumped together under the umbrella of leadership [[performance]], including outcomes such as leader [[effectiveness]], leader advancement, and leader emergence (Kaiser et al., 2008). For instance, leadership performance may be used to refer to the career success of the individual leader, performance of the group or organization, or even leader emergence. Each of these measures can be considered conceptually distinct. While these aspects may be related, they are different outcomes and their inclusion should depend on the applied or research focus.

"Another way to conceptualize leader performance is to focus on the outcomes of the leader’s followers, group, team, unit, or organization. In evaluating this type of leader performance, two general strategies are typically used. The first relies on subjective perceptions of the leader’s performance from subordinates, superiors, or occasionally peers or other parties. The other type of effectiveness measures are more objective indicators of follower or unit performance, such as measures of productivity, goal attainment, sales figures, or unit financial performance (Bass &amp; Riggio, 2006, p. 47)."
&lt;ref&gt;Bass, B. M. and Riggio, R. E. (Eds.). (2006). Transformational Leadership (2nd ed). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[toxic leader]] is someone who has responsibility over a group of people or an organization, and who abuses the leader–follower relationship by leaving the group or organization in a worse-off condition than when he/she joined it.

==Traits==
[[File:0092 - Wien - Kunsthistorisches Museum - Gaius Julius Caesar-edit.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Julius Caesar]], one of the world's greatest military leaders]]
Most theories in the 20th century argued that great leaders were born, not made. Current studies have indicated that leadership is much more complex and cannot be boiled down to a few key traits of an individual. Years of observation and study have indicated that one such trait or a set of traits does not make an extraordinary leader. What scholars have been able to arrive at is that leadership traits of an individual do not change from situation to situation; such traits include intelligence, assertiveness, or physical attractiveness.&lt;ref name="Howell, Jon P. 4-6"&gt;{{cite book|last=Howell|first=Jon P.|title=Snapshots of Great Leadership|year=2012|publisher=Taylor and Francis|location=London, GBR|isbn=9780203103210|pages=4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, each key trait may be applied to situations differently, depending on the circumstances. The following summarizes the main leadership traits found in research by Jon P. Howell, business professor at New Mexico State University and author of the book ''Snapshots of Great Leadership''.

Determination and drive include traits such as initiative, energy, assertiveness, perseverance and sometimes dominance. People with these traits often tend to wholeheartedly pursue their goals, work long hours, are ambitious, and often are very competitive with others. Cognitive capacity includes intelligence, analytical and verbal ability, behavioral flexibility, and good judgment. Individuals with these traits are able to formulate solutions to difficult problems, work well under stress or deadlines, adapt to changing situations, and create well-thought-out plans for the future. Howell provides examples of Steve Jobs and Abraham Lincoln as encompassing the traits of determination and drive as well as possessing cognitive capacity, demonstrated by their ability to adapt to their continuously changing environments.&lt;ref name="Howell, Jon P. 4-6"/&gt;

Self-confidence encompasses the traits of high self-esteem, assertiveness, emotional stability, and self-assurance. Individuals who are self-confident do not doubt themselves or their abilities and decisions; they also have the ability to project this self-confidence onto others, building their trust and commitment. Integrity is demonstrated in individuals who are truthful, trustworthy, principled, consistent, dependable, loyal, and not deceptive. Leaders with integrity often share these values with their followers, as this trait is mainly an ethics issue. It is often said that these leaders keep their word and are honest and open with their cohorts. Sociability describes individuals who are friendly, extroverted, tactful, flexible, and interpersonally competent. Such a trait enables leaders to be accepted well by the public, use diplomatic measures to solve issues, as well as hold the ability to adapt their social persona to the situation at hand. According to Howell, Mother Teresa is an exceptional example who embodies integrity, assertiveness, and social abilities in her diplomatic dealings with the leaders of the world.&lt;ref name="Howell, Jon P. 4-6"/&gt;

Few great leaders encompass all of the traits listed above, but many have the ability to apply a number of them to succeed as front-runners of their organization or situation.

==Ontological-phenomenological model==
One of the more recent definitions of leadership comes from [[Werner Erhard]], [[Michael C. Jensen]], Steve Zaffron, and Kari Granger who describe leadership as "an exercise in language that results in the realization of a future that wasn't going to happen anyway, which future fulfills (or contributes to fulfilling) the concerns of the relevant parties...". This definition ensures that leadership is talking about the future and includes the fundamental concerns of the relevant parties.  This differs from relating to the relevant parties as "followers" and calling up an image of a single leader with others following.  Rather, a future that fulfills on the fundamental concerns of the relevant parties indicates the future that wasn't going to happen is not the "idea of the leader", but rather is what emerges from digging deep to find the underlying concerns of those who are impacted by the leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Forthcoming in "The Handbook for Teaching Leadership", by Werner Erhard, Michael, C. Jensen, &amp; Kari Granger; Scott Snook, Nitin Nohria, Rakesh Khurana (Editors) http://ssrn.com/abstract=1681682&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contexts==

===Organizations===
An organization that is established as an [[Legal instrument|instrument]] or means for achieving defined [[Goal|objectives]] has been referred to as a ''formal organization''. Its design specifies how goals are subdivided and reflected in subdivisions of the organization. Divisions, departments, sections, positions, jobs, and tasks make up this work [[structure]]. Thus, the formal organization is expected to behave impersonally in regard to relationships with clients or with its members. According to Weber's definition, entry and subsequent advancement is by merit or seniority. Employees receive a salary and enjoy a degree of tenure that safeguards them from the arbitrary influence of superiors or of powerful clients. The higher one's position in the hierarchy, the greater one's presumed expertise in adjudicating problems that may arise in the course of the work carried out at lower levels of the organization. It is this bureaucratic structure that forms the basis for the appointment of heads or chiefs of administrative subdivisions in the organization and endows them with the authority attached to their position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Cecil A Gibb|title= Leadership (Handbook of Social Psychology)|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Reading, Massachusetts|year=1970|pages=884–89|isbn= 9780140805178|oclc=174777513|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the appointed head or chief of an administrative unit, a leader emerges within the context of the ''informal organization'' that underlies the formal structure. The informal organization expresses the personal [[Goal|objectives]] and [[goal]]s of the individual [[wikt:Membership|membership]]. Their objectives and goals may or may not coincide with those of the formal organization. The informal organization represents an extension of the social structures that generally characterize human life — the spontaneous emergence of groups and organizations as ends in themselves.

In prehistoric times, humanity was preoccupied with personal security, maintenance, protection, and survival. Now humanity spends a major portion of waking hours working for organizations. The need to identify with a community that provides security, protection, maintenance, and a feeling of belonging has continued unchanged from prehistoric times. This need is met by the informal organization and its emergent, or unofficial, leaders.&lt;ref name="Henry"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Henry P. Knowles |author2=Borje O. Saxberg |title=Personality and Leadership Behavior|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Reading, Massachusetts|year=1971|pages=884–89|isbn= 9780140805178|oclc= 118832|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Vugt, M., Hogan, R., &amp; Kaiser, R. (2008). "Leadership, followership, and evolution": Some lessons from the past. ''American Psychologist'', 63, 182–196.[https://web.archive.org/web/20140411195727/http://www.professormarkvanvugt.com/files/LeadershipFollowershipandEvolution-AmericanPsychologist-2008.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaders emerge from within the structure of the informal organization. Their personal qualities, the demands of the situation, or a combination of these and other factors attract followers who accept their leadership within one or several overlay structures. Instead of the authority of position held by an appointed head or chief, the emergent leader wields influence or power. Influence is the ability of a person to gain co-operation from others by means of persuasion or control over rewards. Power is a stronger form of influence because it reflects a person's ability to enforce action through the control of a means of punishment.&lt;ref name="Henry"/&gt;

A leader is a person who influences a group of people towards a specific result. It is not dependent on title or formal authority. (Elevos, paraphrased from Leaders, Bennis, and Leadership Presence, Halpern &amp; Lubar.) Ogbonnia (2007) defines an effective leader "as an individual with the capacity to consistently succeed in a given condition and be viewed as meeting the expectations of an organization or society." Leaders are recognized by their capacity for caring for others, clear communication, and a commitment to persist.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyle, John R. ''Leadership and Futuring: Making Visions Happen''. Thousand Oaks, California: Corwin Press, Inc., 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; An individual who is appointed to a managerial position has the right to command and enforce obedience by virtue of the authority of their position. However, she or he must possess adequate personal attributes to match this authority, because authority is only potentially available to him/her. In the absence of sufficient personal competence, a manager may be confronted by an emergent leader who can challenge her/his role in the organization and reduce it to that of a figurehead. However, only authority of position has the backing of formal sanctions. It follows that whoever wields personal influence and power can legitimize this only by gaining a formal position in the hierarchy, with commensurate authority.&lt;ref name="Henry"/&gt; Leadership can be defined as one's ability to get others to willingly follow. Every organization needs leaders at every level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hakala|first1=David|title=The Top 10 Leadership Qualities|url=http://www.hrworld.com/features/top-10-leadership-qualities-031908|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410090435/http://www.hrworld.com/features/top-10-leadership-qualities-031908|archivedate=2013-04-10|website=HR World}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Management===
Over the years the philosophical terminology of "[[management]]" and "leadership" have, in the organizational context, been used both as synonyms and with clearly differentiated meanings. Debate is fairly common about whether the use of these terms should be restricted, and generally reflects an awareness of the distinction made by Burns (1978) between "transactional" leadership (characterized by emphasis on procedures, contingent reward, management by exception) and "transformational" leadership (characterized by charisma, personal relationships, creativity).&lt;ref name="Burns"/&gt;

===Group===
In contrast to individual leadership, some organizations have adopted group leadership. In this so-called [[shared leadership]], more than one person provides direction to the group as a whole. It is furthermore characterized by shared responsibility, cooperation and mutual influence among the team members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=CARSON|first=J. B.|last2=TESLUK|first2=P. E.|last3=MARRONE|first3=J. A.|title=SHARED LEADERSHIP IN TEAMS: AN INVESTIGATION OF ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS AND PERFORMANCE.|journal=Academy of Management Journal|volume=50|issue=5|pages=1217–1234|doi=10.2307/20159921|jstor=20159921|year=2007}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some organizations have taken this approach in hopes of increasing creativity, reducing costs, or downsizing. Others may see the traditional leadership of a [[wikt:boss|boss]] as costing too much in team performance. In some situations, the team members best able to handle any given phase of the project become the temporary leaders. Additionally, as each team member has the opportunity to experience the elevated level of empowerment, it energizes staff and feeds the cycle of success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ingrid Bens|year=2006|title=Facilitating to Lead|publisher=Jossey-Bass |isbn=978-0-7879-7731-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaders who demonstrate persistence, tenacity, determination, and synergistic communication skills will bring out the same qualities in their groups. Good leaders use their own inner [[Mentorship|mentors]] to energize their team and organizations and lead a team to achieve success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Bart Barthelemy|year=1997|title=The Sky Is Not The Limit – Breakthrough Leadership|publisher=St. Lucie Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''According to the National School Boards Association (USA):'''''&lt;ref&gt;National School Boards Association&lt;/ref&gt;

These Group Leaderships or Leadership Teams have specific characteristics:

'''Characteristics of a Team'''
* There must be an awareness of unity on the part of all its members.
* There must be interpersonal relationship. Members must have a chance to contribute, and learn from and work with others.
* The members must have the ability to act together toward a common goal.

'''Ten characteristics of well-functioning teams:'''
* Purpose: Members proudly share a sense of why the team exists and are invested in accomplishing its mission and goals.
* Priorities: Members know what needs to be done next, by whom, and by when to achieve team goals.
* Roles: Members know their roles in getting tasks done and when to allow a more skillful member to do a certain task.
* Decisions: Authority and decision-making lines are clearly understood.
* Conflict: Conflict is dealt with openly and is considered important to decision-making and personal growth.
* Personal traits: members feel their unique personalities are appreciated and well utilized.
* Norms: Group norms for working together are set and seen as standards for every one in the groups.
* Effectiveness: Members find team meetings efficient and productive and look forward to this time together.
* Success: Members know clearly when the team has met with success and share in this equally and proudly.
* Training: Opportunities for feedback and updating skills are provided and taken advantage of by team members.

===Self-leadership===
[[Communication and Leadership During Change|Self-leadership]] is a process that occurs within an individual, rather than an external act. It is an expression of who we are as people.&lt;ref&gt;Hackman, M. &amp; Johnson, C. (2009). ''Leadership: A communication perspective''. Long Grove, Illinois: Waveland Press, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biology and Evolution of Leadership===
[[Mark van Vugt]] and [[Anjana Ahuja]] in ''Naturally Selected: The Evolutionary Science of Leadership'' (2011) present evidence of leadership in non-human animals, from ants and bees to baboons and chimpanzees. They suggest that leadership has a long evolutionary history and that the same mechanisms underpinning leadership in humans appear in other social species, too.&lt;ref&gt;van Vugt, M., &amp; Ahuja, A. (2011). ''Naturally Selected: the Evolutionary Science of Leadership''. HarperBusiness.&lt;/ref&gt; They also suggest that the evolutionary origins of leadership are different from that of dominance. In a study [[Mark van Vugt]] and his team looked at the relation between basal testosterone and leadership versus dominance. They found that testosterone correlates with dominance but not with leadership. This was replicated in a sample of managers in which there was no relation between hierarchical position and testosterone level.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Meij, L., Schaveling, J., &amp; van Vugt, M. (2016). Basal testosterone, leadership and dominance: A field study and meta-analysis. Psychoneuroendocrinology, 72, 72-79.&lt;/ref&gt;.     
[[Richard Wrangham]] and [[Dale Peterson]], in ''[[Demonic Males: Apes and the Origins of Human Violence]]'' (1996), present evidence that only humans and [[chimpanzee]]s, among all the animals living on Earth, share a similar tendency for a cluster of behaviors: violence, [[Territory (animal)|territoriality]], and competition for uniting behind the one chief male of the land.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Wrangham and Dale Peterson (1996). [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/books/chap1/demonicmales.htm ''Demonic Males. Apes and the Origins of Human Violence'']. Mariner Books&lt;/ref&gt; This position is contentious. Many animals apart from apes are territorial, compete, exhibit violence, and have a social structure controlled by a dominant male (lions, wolves, etc.), suggesting Wrangham and Peterson's evidence is not empirical. However, we must examine other species as well, including elephants (which are matriarchal and follow an alpha female), meerkats (which are likewise matriarchal), sheep (which follow castrated bell[[wether (disambiguation)|wethers]]) and many others.

By comparison, [[bonobo]]s, the second-closest species-relatives of humans, do ''not'' unite behind the chief male of the land. The bonobos show deference to an alpha or top-ranking female that, with the support of her coalition of other females, can prove as strong as the strongest male. Thus, if leadership amounts to getting the greatest number of followers, then among the bonobos, a female almost always exerts the strongest and most effective leadership. (Incidentally, not all scientists agree on the allegedly peaceful nature of the bonobo or with its reputation as a "[[hippie]] chimp".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Myths==
Leadership, although largely talked about, has been described as one of the least understood concepts across all cultures and civilizations. Over the years, many researchers have stressed the prevalence of this misunderstanding, stating that the existence of several flawed assumptions, or myths, concerning leadership often interferes with individuals' conception of what leadership is all about (Gardner, 1965; Bennis, 1975).&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, J. W. (1965). ''Self-Renewal: The Individual and the Innovative Society.'' New York: Harper and Row.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bennis, W. G. (1975). ''Where have all the leaders gone?'' Washington, D.C.: Federal Executive Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leadership is innate===
According to some, leadership is determined by distinctive [[dispositional affect|dispositional characteristics]] present at birth (e.g., [[extraversion and introversion|extraversion]]; [[intelligence]]; [[ingenuity]]). However, according to Forsyth (2009) there is evidence to show that leadership also develops through hard work and careful observation.&lt;ref name=Forsyth&gt;Forsyth, D. R. (2009). ''Group dynamics'' (5th ed.). Pacific Grove, California: Brooks/Cole.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, effective leadership can result from [[nature versus nurture|nature]] (i.e., innate talents) as well as [[nature versus nurture|nurture]] (i.e., acquired skills).

===Leadership is possessing power over others===
Although leadership is certainly a form of [[Power (social and political)|power]], it is not demarcated by power ''over'' people – rather, it is a power ''with'' people that exists as a reciprocal relationship between a leader and his/her followers (Forsyth, 2009).&lt;ref name=Forsyth/&gt; Despite popular belief, the use of [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]], [[coercion]], and domination to influence others is not a requirement for leadership. In actuality, individuals who seek group consent and strive to act in the best interests of others can also become effective leaders (e.g., class president; court judge).

===Leaders are positively influential===
The [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of the assertion that groups flourish when guided by effective leaders can be illustrated using several examples. For instance, according to Baumeister et al. (1988), the [[bystander effect]] (failure to respond or offer assistance) that tends to develop within groups faced with an emergency is significantly reduced in groups guided by a leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baumeister | first1 = R.

However, the difference leaders make is '''not''' always positive in nature. Leaders sometimes focus on fulfilling their own agendas at the expense of others, including his/her own followers (e.g., [[Pol Pot]]; [[Joseph Stalin|Josef Stalin]]). Leaders who focus on personal gain by employing stringent and manipulative leadership styles often make a difference, but usually do so through negative means.&lt;ref&gt;Lipman-Blumen, J. (2005) ''The Allure of Toxic Leaders''. New York: Oxford. University Press Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leaders entirely control group outcomes===
In [[Western culture]]s it is generally assumed that group leaders make ''all'' the difference when it comes to group influence and overall goal-attainment. Although common, this romanticized view of leadership (i.e., the tendency to overestimate the degree of control leaders have over their groups and their groups' outcomes) ignores the existence of many other factors that influence group dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Meindl | first1 = J. R. | last2 = Ehrlich | first2 = S. B. | last3 = Dukerich | first3 = J. M. | year = 1985 | title = The romance of leadership | url = | journal = Administrative Science Quarterly | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 78–102 | doi=10.2307/2392813| jstor = 2392813 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[group cohesiveness|group cohesion]], [[organizational communication|communication patterns]] among members, individual personality traits, group context, the nature or orientation of the work, as well as [[norm (social)|behavioral norms]] and established standards influence group functionality in varying capacities. For this reason, it is unwarranted to assume that all leaders are in complete control of their groups' achievements.

===All groups have a designated leader===

Despite preconceived notions, not all groups need have a designated leader. Groups that are primarily composed of women,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmid Mast | first1 = M | year = 2002 | title = Female dominance hierarchies: Are they any different from males'? | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 29–39 | doi=10.1177/0146167202281003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Berdahl | first1 = J.

===Group members resist leaders===
Although research has indicated that group members' dependence on group leaders can lead to reduced self-reliance and overall group strength,&lt;ref name=Forsyth/&gt; most people actually prefer to be led than to be without a leader (Berkowitz, 1953).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Berkowitz | first1 = L | year = 1953 | title = Sharing leadership in small, decision-making groups | url = | journal = Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology | volume = 48 | issue = 2| pages = 231–238 | doi=10.1037/h0058076}}&lt;/ref&gt; This "need for a leader" becomes especially strong in troubled groups that are experiencing some sort of conflict. Group members tend to be more contented and productive when they have a leader to guide them. Although individuals filling leadership roles can be a direct source of resentment for followers, most people appreciate the contributions that leaders make to their groups and consequently welcome the guidance of a leader (Stewart &amp; Manz, 1995).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stewart | first1 = G. L. | last2 = Manz | first2 = C. C. | year = 1995 | title = Leadership for self-managing work teams: A typology and integrative model | url = | journal = Human Relations | volume = 48 | issue = 7| pages = 747–770 | doi=10.1177/001872679504800702}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Action-oriented environments==
In most cases, these teams are tasked to operate in remote and changeable environments with limited support or backup (action environments). Leadership of people in these environments requires a different set of skills to that of front line management. These leaders must effectively operate remotely and negotiate the needs of the individual, team, and task within a changeable environment. This has been termed action oriented leadership. Some examples of demonstrations of action oriented leadership include extinguishing a rural fire, locating a missing person, leading a team on an outdoor expedition, or rescuing a person from a potentially hazardous environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schelten|first1=Andreas|title=Prof.|url=http://www.bpaed.edu.tum.de/fileadmin/tueds02/www/pdfs/publikationen/riedl/2002handoutvariantsriedl.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples include modern technology deployments of small/medium-sized IT teams into client plant sites. Leadership of these teams requires hands on experience and a lead-by-example attitude to empower team members to make well thought out and concise decisions independent of executive management and/or home base decision makers. Zachary Hansen was an early adopter of Scrum/Kanban branch development methodologies during the mid 90's to alleviate the dependency that field teams had on trunk based development. This method of just-in-time action oriented development and deployment allowed remote plant sites to deploy up-to-date software patches frequently and without dependency on core team deployment schedules satisfying the clients need to rapidly patch production environment bugs as needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boehm|first1=B.W.|title=Software risk management: principles and practices|journal=IEEE Software|volume=8|pages=32–41|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=62930&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D62930|doi=10.1109/52.62930|year=1991|citeseerx=10.1.1.381.466}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical thought==

[[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]]'s 1840 "[[Great Man theory]]", which emphasized the role of leading individuals, met opposition in the 19th and 20th centuries.

[[Karl Popper]] noted in 1945 that leaders can [[mislead]] and make mistakes - he warns against deferring to "great men".&lt;ref&gt;

have subjected the concept of leadership to [[critical thinking]] and have provided an analysis that asserts that people abrogate their responsibility to think and will actions for themselves. While the conventional view of leadership may satisfy people who "want to be told what to do", these critics say that one should question why they are being subjected to a will or intellect other than their own if the leader is not a subject-matter expert ([[Subject Matter Expert|SME]]).

Concepts such as [[Workers' self-management|autogestion]], [[employeeship]], and common [[civic virtue]], etc., challenge the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the leadership principle by stressing [[individual responsibility]] and/or group authority in the workplace and elsewhere and by focusing on the skills and attitudes that a person needs in general rather than separating out "leadership" as the basis of a special class of individuals.

Similarly, various historical calamities (such as [[World War II]]) can be attributed&lt;ref&gt;
For example:

to a misplaced reliance on the [[Führerprinzip|principle of leadership]] as exhibited in [[dictatorship]].

The idea of [[leaderism]] paints leadership and its excesses in a negative light.

==Executives==
Executives are energetic, outgoing, and competitive. They can be visionary, hard-working, and decisive. However, managers need to be aware of unsuccessful executives who once showed management potential but who are later dismissed or retired early. They typically fail because of personality factors rather than job performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sperry|first=Len|date=September 1997|title=Leadership Dynamics Character and Character Structure in Executives|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232551186|journal=Psychology Journal: Practice and Research|series=268–284|volume=49|issue=4|pages=|via=}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Terms fallacies in their thinking are:''
* ''Unrealistic optimism fallacy'': Believing they are so smart that they can do whatever they want
* ''Egocentrism fallacy'': Believing they are the only ones who matter, that the people who work for them don't count
* ''Omniscience fallacy'': Believing they know everything and seeing no limits to their knowledge
* ''Omnipotence fallacy'': Believing they are all powerful and therefore entitled to do what they want
* ''Invulnerability fallacy'': Believing they can get away with doing what they want because they are too clever to get caught; even if they are caught, believing they will go unpunished because of their importance.

'''Mac Wellman''', born John McDowell Wellman on March 7, 1945 in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], is an American [[playwright]], [[author]], and [[poet]].&lt;ref name=NYPL&gt;[http://archives.nypl.org/the/21699 Mac Wellman papers, 1959-1999.] New York Public Library Archives and Manuscripts.&lt;/ref&gt; He is best known for his experimental work in the theater which rebels against theatrical conventions, often abandoning such traditional elements as plot and character altogether.&lt;ref name=Harnetiaux&gt;{{cite web|last=Harnetiaux|first=Trish|title=Mac Wellman Explains, Or Doesn’t Explain, What Is Near And What Is Far|url=http://brooklynrail.org/2011/10/theater/mac-wellman-explains-or-doesnt-explain-what-is-near-and-what-is-far|publisher=The Brooklyn Rail|accessdate=August 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal development==
In 1967 Wellman earned a baccalaureat International Relations at the [[American University]], marrying his first wife, Nancy Roesch, the same year. Moving to the [[University of Wisconsin]], he earned a Masters degree in English focusing on poetry.  After teaching several years, he sought professional renewal by touring Europe. In [[The Netherlands]], Wellman met Annemarie Prins, a Dutch theatrical director/producer, and they began a collaboration, creating [[radio play]]s. In 1975 they directed a stage production, ''Fama Combinatoria'', at Theatre de Brakke Grand in Amsterdam.&lt;ref name=NYPL/&gt;

During the late seventies Wellman moved to New York City and married a Dutch journalist, Yolanda Gerritsen.  Wellman continued writing poetry and plays, and in 1977 published a collection of poetry, ''In Praise of Secrecy'', while in 1979 his play, ''Starluster'' was produced in New York.&lt;ref name=NYPL/&gt;

==Writings==
Wellman's plays frequently resemble a moving collage of events which has more in common with an avant-garde dance production than Broadway-style theater. Wellman has stated, "More and more I think all theater is site-specific. When plays work, they work in the space."&lt;ref name=Harnetiaux/&gt; Helen Shaw wrote, "Since a 1984 essay, 'The Theatre of Good Intentions', [Wellman] has been the cynosure in a heaven full of experimental playwrights who rail against what Jonathan Lear, in his book ''Open Minded'', called a 'tyranny' of 'the already known'."&lt;ref&gt;Helen Shaw. Mac Wellman and Things of the Devil. ''The Difficulty of Crossing a Field.'' Minneapolis: [[University of Minnesota Press]], 2008. vii-xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussing his style with ''[[BOMB Magazine]]'', Wellman said that he uses words as objects in his writing. "I found if you try to write totally in cliches and things that don't sound right," Wellman clarified, "you deal with a language that frankly is 98% of what people speak, think, and hear. So it's enormously enjoyable."&lt;ref&gt;Yablonsky, Linda. [http://bombsite.com/issues/53/articles/1908 "Mac Wellman"]. ''[[BOMB Magazine]]''. Fall 1995. Retrieved July 27, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of language has been positively characterized as "an untrammeled flow of logorrhea: plain words, fancy words, space-age words, Victorian words and words that defy the dictionary" by ''[[The New York Times]]'' reviewer [[Ben Brantley]].&lt;ref&gt;Brantley, Ben. [http://theater.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?res=9C02EFD61238F933A15756C0A962958260 "Review/Theater; Family Life Colored by Meance"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. May 20, 1994. Retrieved July 27, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of production, Wellman experiments with stage direction. Some directions are spoken and others are not, blurring the line between action and direction. Wellman notes, "That's something I'm really interested in. I like it when people talk about what's going on in a play. Sometimes it's more interesting than trying to enact everything."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harnetiaux|first=Trish|title=Mac Wellman Explains, Or Doesn't Explain, What Is Near And What Is Far|url=http://brooklynrail.org/2011/10/theater/mac-wellman-explains-or-doesnt-explain-what-is-near-and-what-is-far|publisher=The Brooklyn Rail|accessdate=August 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional credits==
Wellman is the  I. Fine Professor of Play Writing at [[Brooklyn College]], [[New York City]], and in 2010 he became a CUNY Distinguished Professor. Wellman is author of more than forty plays, including:

*''Description Beggared or the Allegory of WHITENESS'' (2000)
*''Jennie Richee'' (2001)

In addition to several collaborations with composer/percussionist [[David Van Tieghem]] in the 1990s, he collaborated with [[Bang on a Can]] composer [[David Lang (composer)|David Lang]] in 2006 on the opera ''The Difficulty of Crossing a Field'', adapted from a very short story by [[Ambrose Bierce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walat|first=Kathryn|title=In Dialogue: Mac Makes an Opera|journal=The Brooklyn Rail|date=September 2006|url=http://brooklynrail.org/2006/09/theater/mac-makes-an-opera}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has received grants from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], New York Foundation for the Arts, the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], the McKnight Foundation and a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]]. In 1990, he received an [[Obie Award]] for Best New American Play (for ''Bad Penny'', ''Terminal Hip'', and ''Crowbar''). In 1991, he received another Obie Award for ''Sincerity Forever''. He has received a Lila Wallace-Readers' Digest Writers Award, and most recently the 2003 [[Obie Award]] for Lifetime Achievement, as well as the [[Foundation for Contemporary Arts]] Grants to Artists award (2003). He is a co-founder of [[The Flea Theater]] in New York City.

The '''Mirage Tavern''' was a drinking establishment  at 731 N. Wells St. in Chicago purchased by the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' in 1977 to investigate widespread allegations of official corruption and shakedowns visited on small businesses by city officials. The journalists used hidden cameras to help ensure that city inspectors caught accepting payoffs for ignoring safety hazards were all properly documented.&lt;ref&gt;Lawler, Philip F. "The Alternative Influence", 1984. p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacKenzie, Kerry. "Chicago", 1999. p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, the ''Sun-Times'' broke the story in a 25-part series that documented the many abuses and crimes committed at the tavern, which was shaken down repeatedly by state and local officials. The series was initially nominated for the [[Pulitzer Prize]]  for general reporting, but the Pulitzer board decided not to award the ''Sun-Times'' when editor [[Ben Bradlee]] of the ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' led an attack on the grounds that the reporters used undercover reporting, a form of deception, to report the story.&lt;ref name="silver"&gt;[[Ken Silverstein|Silverstein, Ken]], "Turkmeniscam: How Washington Lobbyists Fought to Flack for a Stalinist Dictatorship", 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Mirage gave rise to major reforms including city code revisions, new procedures in city inspections and investigations at federal, state and city levels. The IRS sent in 20 agents to take a closer look at tax fraud by cash businesses. The Illinois Department of Revenue formed a new investigative unit: the Mirage Audit Unit.  An ongoing federal investigation, spurred by the Mirage findings, managed indictments of a third of the city’s electrical inspectors in 1978, with more indictments to come later.

The project was overseen by editors James Hoge, Ralph Otwell, Stuart H. Loory and Joseph Reilly.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Zay N. "The Mirage", 1979. p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1977, journalist [[Pam Zekman]] and [[Better Government Association]] chief investigator Bill Recktenwald purchased the tavern under the [[wikt:alias|alias]]es ''Mr. and Mrs. Ray Patterson''.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;[[TIME]], [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,919328,00.html Press: Barroom Sting: Bribes Flowed Like Beer", January 23, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Mike Wallace|Wallace, Mike]], "Close Encounters", 1984. pp. 385–388.&lt;/ref&gt; Reporter [[Zay N. Smith]], who wrote the series, and BGA investigator Jeff Allen posed as the bartender and manager, respectively. ''Sun-Times'' photographers Gene Pesek and Jim Frost posed as repairmen and were in charge of photographing the tavern's activities from a hidden section of the tavern built over the washrooms.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.topic.com/the-story-behind-the-chicago-newspaper-that-bought-a-bar&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="time"/&gt; 

Corrupt practices ran the gamut from shakedowns to tax fraud. 

The shakedown amounts were small, typically less than $100, as the reporters learned of what they later called "the supermarket approach to graft--low prices, high volume" that inspectors tended to prefer as the safest way of doing illegal business.

Among others, a city electrical inspector agreed to overlook the tavern's faulty wiring. A fire department lieutenant agreed to sign off on the tavern's grand opening, despite the loose electrical wiring hanging from rafters and a basement piled high with trash against regulations.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, John A. "Decisions for Sale", 1978. p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; A city health inspector ignored maggots and sink drains that emptied down to the basement floor. A state liquor inspector ignored fruit flies in the liquor.
(The tavern quietly corrected all its code violations, on its own, after the shakedown inspections.)

Also reported were illegal kickbacks from pinball operators and jukebox operators (A.A. Swingtime Music Company), as well as tax skimming.&lt;ref name="soc"&gt;Keith, Allan H. "Socialism for Survival", 1992. pp. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt; Philip J. Barasch, a local accountant, gave the new owners of the bar extensive lessons on how to keep two sets of account books to skim profits without paying tax and advised them exactly what time of day inspectors showed up and how much their shakedowns would typically cost. He also suggested including his [[business card]] with any payoffs to help smooth the shakedown process. The only officials he warned against bribing were the police, noting that "if you pay off a cop, they keep coming around every month, like flies, looking for a payoff".&lt;ref name="time"/&gt; The Mirage, after hearing Barash's tax advice, hired six more accountants specializing in small cash businesses and was counseled by all of them to commit fraud.

The tavern, which has had more than one owner since the ''Sun-Times'' investigation, is now known, after a number of improvements, as the Brehon Pub.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8647">'''Mongolian studies''' is an [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] field of scholarly inquiry concerning [[Mongolian language]], [[Mongolian history]], and [[Mongolian culture]]. Scholars who work in the field of Mongolian studies are often referred to as '''Mongolists'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sanders|first1=Alan|title=Historical Dictionary of Mongolia|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=9780810866010|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=Z5umNthHltQC&amp;pg=PA237&amp;dq=Mongolists&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjjzqjn2sfPAhXDspQKHRFcCykQ6AEIIzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Mongolists&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Isaac Jacob Schmidt]] is generally regarded as the "founder" of Mongolian studies as an academic discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Polyanskaya|2014|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schmidt, a native of [[Amsterdam]] who emigrated to [[Russia]] on account of [[Campaigns of 1795 in the French Revolutionary Wars|the French invasion]], began his exposure to the [[Mongolic languages]] as a missionary of the [[Moravian Church]] among the [[Kalmyks]], and translated the [[Gospel of Matthew]] into the [[Kalmyk language]]. Afterwards he moved to [[Moscow]] and then [[Saint Petersburg]], where he produced his most famous work: the first translation of the ''[[Erdeniin Tobchi]]'' into a European language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bawden|2013|p=xiv [https://books.google.com/books?id=RVrYAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR14]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also compiled a dictionary of Mongolian and a translation of the seven then-known chapters of the ''[[Epic of King Gesar]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bawden|2013|p=xv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other major figures in the early history of Mongolian studies in Russia were [[Józef Kowalewski]] of Poland (who founded the Mongolian studies department at [[Kazan University]]) and [[Matthias Castrén]] of Finland (who wrote the first grammar of a modern Mongolic language, published after his death by [[Franz Anton Schiefner]] at [[Saint Petersburg State University|Saint Petersburg University]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Polyanskaya|2011|pp=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Janhunen|2012|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

China had far longer direct contact with [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic peoples]] than Russia or other European countries had, and thus a longer history of studying their languages. However, the modern academic tradition of Mongolian studies in China faced a variety of early setbacks.&lt;ref name="Kotkin5"&gt;{{harvnb|Kotkin|1999|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 19th-century studies of Mongolia by Chinese scholars were closely tied to [[Mongolia under Qing rule|Qing dynasty rule over Mongolia]]. The threat from Russian imperialism was a major spur for Chinese scholars to study the region, both as part of the project of "map[ping] and classify[ing] the frontier", and from their desire to emphasise affinity between the [[Han Chinese]] and peoples of the frontier and their common contrast with Japanese and European powers who sought influence in the region.&lt;ref name="Kotkin5"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bulag|2005|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, as [[Stephen Kotkin]] describes it, in the aftermath of the 1911 [[Xinhai Revolution]] which overthrew the Qing and established the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]], the whole field of study was seen as "closely tied to the Manchus and imperial rule" and became discredited, a state of affairs made worse by the opposition to the 1911 revolution of major Chinese scholars of Mongolia such as [[Wang Guowei]].&lt;ref name="Kotkin5"/&gt; The development of Mongolian studies in China in the early years after the [[History of the People's Republic of China (1949–76)|establishment of the People's Republic of China]] drew heavily on Russian works.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nalin|2012|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first tertiary-level centres for Mongolian studies in China, the Institute of Mongolia at [[Inner Mongolia University]], was founded in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nalin|2012|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars in the United States did work in Mongolian studies in the early 20th century, such as [[Jeremiah Curtin]], [[Berthold Laufer]], and [[Roy Chapman Andrews]]. The [[University of California, Berkeley]] offered the U.S.' first course in the Mongolian language in 1936, taught by [[Ferdinand Lessing]].&lt;ref name="Tsai4"&gt;{{harvnb|Tsai|2012|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harvard University]] also had some scholars who worked in the field, such as [[Francis Woodman Cleaves]] and [[Antoine Mostaert]]; [[Joseph Fletcher (historian)|Joseph Fletcher]] was one of Cleaves' students.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsai|2012|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, U.S. institutions for Mongolian studies were not founded until after World War II. Such institutions received a major boost from the post-war influx of refugees from communism, which included [[Diluwa Khutugtu Jamsrangjab]], [[John Gombojab Hangin]] of Inner Mongolia and former Soviet Academy of Sciences member [[Nicholas Poppe]].&lt;ref name="Tsai4"/&gt; Poppe taught at the Far Eastern and Russian Institute at University of Washington; [[John Krueger]] was one of his students there.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsai|2012|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Denis Sinor]] of Hungary, who taught at the [[University of Cambridge]] after the war, arrived in the U.S. in 1962 and founded the Department of Ural and Altaic Studies at [[Indiana University]] (now known as the [[Department of Central Eurasian Studies (Indiana University)|Department of Central Eurasian Studies]]), and later recruited Krueger and Hangin to join the department.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsai|2012|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oh, with the verbing!''' is a phrase commonly used in TV shows and movies, first used by comedian [[Jerry Lewis]]. The literal phrase "Oh, with the verbing!" itself is normally used with a verb replacing "verbing," such as "screaming, stabbing, bleeding," hence the name of the phrase. Similar lines related to the phrase are spoken as "The verbing, and the verbing" and "Again with the verbing" and other similar dialogue.

==Usage==

The most frequent usage of this phrase is of [[Professor Frink]], of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', as it is arguably the character's trademark.

[[Zoidberg]] uses it in ''[[Futurama]]''.

It is used in the fourth ''[[An American Tail]]'' movie ''The Mystery of the Night Monster''.

[[Mort Goldman]] of ''[[Family Guy]]'' sometimes speaks the line.

''[[Homestar Runner]]'' uses a similar line in an episode.

Every episode of the sitcom ''[[Alright Already (TV series)|Alright Already]]'' had a title with some variant of "again with the verbing."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7007">{{distinguish|Haptic communication}}
In [[linguistics]], a '''phatic expression''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|æ|t|ᵻ|k}} is communication which serves a social function, such as social pleasantries that don't seek or offer any information of value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|last=Malinowski|first=B.|year=1923|chapter=The Problem of Meaning in Primitive Languages|editors=Charles K. Ogden and Ian A. Richards|title=The Meaning of Meaning|pages=296-336|location=London|publisher=Kegan Paul, Trench and Trubner}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phatic expressions are a socio-pragmatic function and are used in everyday conversational exchange typically expressed in situational instances that call for social cues.&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Žegarac, [http://www.vladimirzegarac.info/1998_WhatIsPhaticCommunication.pdf "What IS Phatic Communication?"], 'Phatic Communication', 
April 25, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; In [[speech]] communication the term means "small talk" (conversation for its own sake) and has also been called "[[social grooming|grooming]] talking."&lt;ref&gt;"Teach Yourself Linguistics", by Jean Aitchison, {{ISBN|978-0-340-87083-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For example, greetings such as "hello" and "how are you?" are phatic expressions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=Phatic|website=Oxford Living Dictionaries: British &amp; World English|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=n.d.||url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/phatic|accessdate=October 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In phatic expressions, [[speech act|speech acts]] are not communicative, since no content is communicated.  According to anthropologist Bronisław Malinowski, apparently "purposeless" speech acts—polite small talk, like "how are you?" or "have a nice day"—even though their content may be trivial or irrelevant to the situation, perform the important function of establishing, maintaining, and managing bonds of sociality between participants.&lt;ref&gt;Malinowski, B. (1923) "The Problem of Meaning in Primitive Languages”, in: Charles K. Ogden and Ian A. Richards, ''The Meaning of Meaning'', 296–336, London: Kegan Paul, Trench and Trubner&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Roman Jakobson]]'s work, the 'phatic' function of language concerns the channel of communication; for instance, when one says "I can't hear you, you're breaking up" in the middle of a cell-phone conversation. This usage appears in research on [[online communities]] and [[micro-blogging]].&lt;ref&gt;

==History==
The term ''phatic communion'' ('bonding by language') was coined by anthropologist [[Bronisław Malinowski]] in his essay "The Problem of Meaning in Primitive Languages", which appeared in 1923 as a supplementary contribution to ''The Meaning of Meaning'' by C. K. Ogden and I. A. Richards. The term "phatic" means "linguistic" (i.e. "by language") and comes from the Greek φατός ''phatós'' ("spoken, that may be spoken"), from φημί ''phēmí'' ("I speak, say").&lt;ref&gt;Haberland, H. (1996) "Communion or communication? A historical note on one of the 'founding fathers' of pragmatics", in Robin Sackmann (ed.), "Theretical linguistics and grammatical description", 163-166, Amsterdam: Benjamins &lt;/ref&gt;

==Phatic expressions in various languages==
===English===
"You're welcome", in its phatic usage, is not intended to convey the message that the hearer is welcome; it is a phatic response to being thanked, which in turn is a phatic whose function is to acknowledge the receipt of a benefit.

Similarly, the question "how are you?" is usually an automatic component of a social encounter. Although there are times when "how are you?" is asked in a sincere, concerned manner and does in fact anticipate a detailed response regarding the respondent's present state, this needs to be [[Pragmatics|pragmatically]] inferred from [[Context (language use)|context]] and [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]].

Example: a simple, basic exchange between two acquaintances in a non-formal environment:

:Speaker one: "What's up?" (US English. In UK English this means "is there something wrong?")
:Speaker two: "Hey, how's it going?"

Or:

:Speaker one: "Alright?" (UK English. In US English this means "is there something wrong?")
:Speaker two: "You alright."

Neither speaker expects an actual answer to the question but rather it is an indication that each has recognized the other's presence and has therefore sufficiently performed that particular social duty.

===Japanese===
{{main|Aizuchi}}
In Japanese, phatic expressions play a significant role in communication, where they are referred to as "[[aizuchi]]."

===Persian===
{{main|Taarof}}
[[Taarof]] is a complex set of expressions and other gestures in [[Persianate society|Persian society]], primarily reflected in the [[Persian language|language]].

==Non-verbal phatic expressions==
Not all phatic expressions are done with spoken utterances. Non-verbal phatic expressions are used without spoken utterances to emphasize or add detail to the message that a person conveys or expresses. Common examples of these are smiling, gesturing, waving, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Carola Surkamp, [http://publish.ucc.ie/journals/scenario/2014/02/Surkamp/03/en"Non-verbal communication"], 
April 26, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dr. Carola Surkamp, professor at University of Cologne, non-verbal phatic communication can be expressed with involuntary physical features such as direction of gaze, blushing, posture, etc. and that these have a vital function in regulating conversation.&lt;ref&gt;Carola Surkamp, [http://publish.ucc.ie/journals/scenario/2014/02/Surkamp/03/en"Non-verbal communication"], , 
April 25, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Online phatic expressions==
Phatic expressions are used on different communication platforms on the internet such as social media networks where certain platforms require and prompt certain actions to be made between users to communicate or implicate certain messages between people without direct utterances. Examples for this would be: 'likes', comments/replies, shares/reblogs, [[emoji]] use, etc. These &lt;i&gt;'phatic posts'&lt;/i&gt; as Radovanovic and Ragnedda like to call them, are again used a social function of social communicative upkeep that has no real value but expresses social connection, relationships between users and recognition.&lt;ref&gt;Radovanovic and Ragnedda, [http://eprints.rclis.org/24377/1/paper_18.pdf"Phatic Posts"], 'Phatic Posts', 
April 26, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Plateau Penutian''' (also '''Shahapwailutan''', '''Lepitan''') is a family of languages spoken in northern [[California]], reaching through central-western [[Oregon]] to northern [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] and central-northern [[Idaho]].

==Family division==
Plateau Penutian consists of four languages:

{{clade
|label1=Plateau&amp;nbsp; Penutian&amp;nbsp;
|1={{clade
  |1=[[Klamath-Modoc language|Klamath]] (a.k.a. Klamath-Modoc, Lutuami, Lutuamian) †
  |2=[[Molala language|Molala]] †
  |label3=&amp;nbsp;[[Sahaptian languages|Sahaptian]]&amp;nbsp;
  |3={{clade
  |1=[[Nez Percé language|Nez Percé]]
  |2=[[Sahaptin language|Sahaptin]]
}}
}}
}}

==History==
Plateau Penutian as originally proposed was one branch of the hypothetical [[Penutian languages|Penutian]] phylum as proposed by [[Edward Sapir]]. The original proposal also included [[Cayuse language|Cayuse]] (which was grouped with Molala into a '''Waiilatpuan''' branch); however, this language has little documentation and that which is documented is inadequately recorded. Thus, the status of Cayuse within Penutian (or any other genealogical relation for that matter) may very well forever remain [[Unclassified language|unclassified]].

The Sahaptian grouping of Sahaptin and Nez Percé has long been uncontroversial. Several linguists have published mounting evidence in support of a connection between Klamath (a.k.a. Klamath-Modoc) and Sahaptian. Howard Berman&lt;ref&gt;Berman, H. (1996). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1265945 The Position of Molala in Plateau Penutian]. ''International Journal of American Linguistics, 62''(1), 1-30.&lt;/ref&gt; provides rather convincing evidence to include Molala within Plateau Penutian. Recent appraisals of the Penutian hypothesis find Plateau Penutian to be "well supported" by specialists (DeLancey &amp; Golla (1997: 181); Campbell 1997), with DeLancey &amp; Golla (1997: 180) cautiously stating "while all subgroupings at this stage of Penutian research must be considered provisional, several linkages show considerable promise" (Campbell 1997 likewise mentions similar caveats). Other researchers have pointed out promising similarities between Plateau Penutian and the [[Maiduan languages|Maiduan]] family, although this proposal is still not completely demonstrated.  A connection with Uto-Aztecan has also been suggested (Rude 2000).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2279">'''Rawi(ya)''' ({{lang-ar|راوية}}, meaning "female and male teller") is a collective of documentary photographers from the Middle East (West Asia and North Africa). Today its members are Myriam Abdelaziz ([[New York City]]), Tamara Abdul Hadi ([[Beirut]]), Ghaith Abdul Hadad (Istanbul), Zeid Ben Romdhane (Tunis), [[Laura Boushnak]] ([[Sarajevo]]), Tanya Habjouqa ([[East Jerusalem]]), and [[Tasneem Alsultan]] ([[Jubail]]). It is the first cooperative of its kind with that started as an all female photographer group from the Arab world and opened up to male members in 2016.&lt;ref name=time/&gt;

Newsha Tavakolian got together with Tamara Abdul Hadi and Dalia Khamissy in Beirut in 2009 with the idea of the collective, thereafter Boushnak and Habjouqa joined the conversation and Rawiya was born. In August 2011, following the Egyptian revolution,  Myriam Abdelaziz joined the group. The collective made its official debut at the FORMAT International Photography Festival in Derby, U.K. in March 2011, which led to international  exhibitions across the Greater Middle East, Europe, and the United States. In 2016 Tasneem Alsultan became a member of Rawiya. Tasneem became Grantee of Magnum/Prince Claus/AFAC with Tanya Habjouqa as her mentor. Gaith Abdul Hadad and Zeid Ben Romdhane were invited to join in 2016, opening the collective to male members.&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite web | title = Rawiya: Photography Collective Finds Strength in Numbers |work=TIME, LightBox | url = http://lightbox.time.com/2011/11/03/rawiya-photography-collective-finds-strength-in-numbers/#1 |date=November 3, 2011 | author=Megan Gibson | accessdate = 2014-09-15  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Scroll ink materials.JPG|right|thumb|Ingredients used in making ink for Hebrew scrolls today.]]
A '''scroll''' (from the Old French ''escroe'' or ''escroue''), also known as a '''roll''', is a roll of [[papyrus]], [[parchment]], or [[paper]] containing writing.&lt;ref&gt;Beal, Peter. (2008) "scroll" in ''A Dictionary of English Manuscript Terminology 1450–2000'' Online edition. [[Oxford University Press]], 2008. http://www.oxfordreference.com {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6H9SWMK4U?url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/ |date=5 June 2013 }} Retrieved 21 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
A scroll is usually divided up into pages, which are sometimes separate sheets of papyrus or parchment glued together at the edges, or may be marked divisions of a continuous roll of [[writing material]]. The scroll is usually unrolled so that one page is exposed at a time, for writing or reading, with the remaining pages rolled up to the left and right of the visible page. It is unrolled from side to side, and the text is written in lines from the top to the bottom of the page. Depending on the language, the letters may be written left to right, right to left, or alternating in direction ([[boustrophedon]]).

Some scrolls are simply rolled up pages; others may have wooden rollers on each end: [[Torah]] scrolls have rather elaborate rollers befitting their ceremonial function.

==History of scroll use==
{{Main|History of scrolls}}
{{double image|right|Giovane con rotolo.JPG|150|MANNapoli 120620 a Fresco young man with rolls from Pompeii Italy.jpg|150|[[Roman portraiture]] [[fresco]]s from [[Pompeii]], 1st century AD, depicting two different men wearing [[laurel wreath]]s, one holding the ''[[rotulus]]'', the other a ''[[History of scrolls|volumen]]''}}{{See also|Roman Empire#Literacy, books, and education}}Scrolls were the first form of editable record keeping texts, used in Eastern Mediterranean [[ancient Egyptian civilization]]s. Parchment scrolls were used by the [[Israelites]] among others before the [[codex]] or bound [[book]] with parchment pages was invented by the Romans, which became popular around the 1st century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.history.com/news/history-lists/10-innovations-that-built-ancient-rome|title=10 Innovations That Built Ancient Rome|author=|date=|website=history.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scrolls were more highly regarded than codices until well into [[Roman Empire|Roman]] times, where they were usually written in single latitudinal column.

The ink used in writing scrolls had to adhere to a surface that was rolled and unrolled, so special inks were developed. Even so, ink would slowly flake off of scrolls.

==Rolls==
[[File:Parliamentary archives.jpg|thumb|right|Rolls recording UK [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Acts of Parliament]] held in the [[Parliamentary Archives]], [[Palace of Westminster]], London]]
Shorter pieces of [[parchment]] or [[paper]] are called ''rolls'' or ''[[Rotulus|rotuli]]'', although usage of the term by modern historians varies with periods. Historians of the classical period tend to use ''roll'' instead of ''scroll''. Rolls may still be many meters or feet long, and were used in the medieval and Early Modern period in Europe and various West Asian cultures for [[manuscript]] administrative documents intended for various uses, including accounting, rent-rolls, legal agreements, and inventories. A distinction that sometimes applies is that the lines of writing in rotuli run across the width of the roll (that is to say, are parallel with any unrolled portion) rather than along the length, divided into page-like sections. Rolls may be wider than most scrolls, up to perhaps 60&amp;nbsp;cm or two feet wide.  Rolls were often stored together in a special cupboard on shelves.

A special Chinese form of short book, called the "whirlwind book," consists of several pieces of paper bound at the top with bamboo and then rolled up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idp.bl.uk/education/bookbinding/bookbinding.a4d|title=IDP Education - Bookbinding|author=|date=|website=idp.bl.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scotland==
In [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], the term ''scrow'' was used from about the 13th to the 17th centuries for scroll, writing, or documents in list or schedule form. There existed an office of Clerk of the Scrow (''Rotulorum Clericus'') meaning the Clerk of the Rolls or Clerk of the Register.&lt;ref&gt;Beal, 2008, "scrow".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Replacement by the codex==
The Romans invented the ''codex'' form of the book, folding the scroll into pages which made reading and handling the document much easier. Legend has it that Julius Caesar was the first to fold scrolls, concertina-fashion, for dispatches to his forces campaigning in Gaul. Scrolls were awkward to read if a reader wished to consult material at opposite ends of the document. Further, scrolls were written only on one side, while both sides of the codex page were used. 

Eventually, the folds were cut into sheets, or "leaves," and bound together along one edge. The bound pages were protected by stiff covers, usually of wood enclosed with leather. ''Codex'' is Latin for a "block of wood": the Latin ''liber'', the root of "library," and the German ''Buch'', the source of "book," both refer to wood. The codex was not only easier to handle than the scroll, but it also fit conveniently on library shelves. The spine generally held the book's title, facing out, affording easier organization of the collection.

The term ''codex'' technically refers only to manuscript books-those that, at one time, were handwritten. More specifically, a codex is the term used primarily for a bound manuscript from Roman times up through the Middle Ages.

From the fourth century on, the codex became the standard format for books, and scrolls were no longer generally used. After the contents of a parchment scroll were copied in codex format, the scroll was seldom preserved. The majority that did survive were found by archaeologists in burial pits and in the buried trash of forgotten communities.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Stuart A.P. (2009) The Library: An Illustrated History. Chicago, IL. Skyhorse Publishing. (p.27)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent discovery==
The oldest complete Torah scroll was discovered stored in an academic library in Bolonia, Italy by Professor Mauro Perani in 2013. It had been mislabeled in 1889 as dating from the 17th century, but Perani suspected it was actually older as it was written in an earlier Babylonian script. Two tests conducted by laboratories at Italy’s University of Salento and at the University of Illinois confirmed that the scroll dates from the second half of the 12th century to the first quarter of the 13th century. Ancient Torah scrolls are rare because when they are damaged they stop being used for liturgies and are buried. 

The scroll is made up of 58 sections of soft sheep leather. It is 36 meters long and 64 centimeters wide. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christiancentury.org/article/2013-06/oldest-complete-scroll-torah-found-italy Oldest complete scroll of Torah found in Italy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407075932/http://www.christiancentury.org/article/2013-06/oldest-complete-scroll-torah-found-italy |date=7 April 2014 }}.

==Modern technology ==
Modern technology may be able to assist in reading ancient scrolls. In January 2015, computer software may be making progress in reading 2,000-year-old Herculaneum scrolls, computer scientists report. After working for more than 10 years on unlocking the contents of damaged [[Herculaneum_papyri|Herculaneum scrolls]], researchers may be able to progress towards reading the scrolls, which cannot be physically opened.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/01/150122114405.htm Major breakthrough in reading ancient scrolls] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123041620/https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/01/150122114405.htm |date=23 January 2015 }}, ''[[Science Daily]]'' &lt;/ref&gt;

{{More citations needed|date=June 2018}}

A '''season ticket''', or '''season pass''', is a [[Ticket (admission)|ticket]] that grants privileges over a defined period of time.

== History ==
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' has illustrative quotations which show the term used in the United States in 1820 for [[theatre ticket]]s; and in the United Kingdom in 1836 for [[boat travel]] and 1862 for [[rail transport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OED|Season, n.|accessdate=8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sports ==
In [[sport]]s, such as [[Association football]] or [[American football]], a season ticket grants the holder access to all regular-season home games for one [[Season (sports)|season]] without additional charges. The ticket usually offers a discounted price over purchasing a ticket for each of the home games for a season individually. In some sports, season ticket holders are usually allowed to buy tickets for other home games (such the [[playoffs]]) earlier than other fans, and may be given priority when buying tickets for their team's allocation at a [[road game]]. Seats assigned to season tickets are generally the better ones in their seating section.  Season ticket holders are frequently offered preferred seating at special events or extra games.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Season passes are commonly used for winter sports, but were originally in American ski resorts a privilege for club members and investors. However in 2000 a discounting movement across the US triggered a price war and increased the widespread use of season passes.&lt;ref&gt;''Skiing Heritage Journal'' Dec 2010 - Page 36  Vol. 22, No. 4 - Magazine  IN THE BEGINNING The origins of the season pass ... "DISCOUNT PASSES TODAY When the year 2000 dawned, there was a new dynamic in season passes—a discounting movement that triggered a price war and brought the season pass to the masses."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arts ==
A season ticket is also an option for many music venues (including Opera, Ballet, Symphony houses) and repertory [[theatre]] companies. The [[Subscription business model|season subscription]] usually offers a discounted price over purchasing a ticket for each concert or play in a series or all concerts or plays in a season. (Typically, season tickets are only offered to donors who support the [[cultural institution]]).{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

== Public transport ==
In [[public transport]], a season ticket allows the user to travel by public transport an unlimited number of times within a period of time. The term "commuter pass" is used in some countries. Season tickets are typically sold for a week, month or year. The validity of season tickets varies. At one extreme it may only allow travel between two points (A to B) by only one operator and one route (if there are more than one competing). At the other extreme, it may allow unlimited travel within a geographic area, or even a whole country, allowing free choice of method of transportation ([[bus]], [[tram]], [[train]], etc.) and free choice of operating company. See [[integrated ticketing]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

== Television ==
In television, a season ticket refers to the term invented by the manufacturers of the [[TiVo]] [[digital video recorder]] for the function which allows a user to program the device to record all the episodes of a  [[Season (television)|season]] of a [[television show]], even if their airings are rescheduled or pre-empted. Similar functions are available on competitive digital video recorder systems and software packages, such as [[ReplayTV]] and [[IceTV]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} With the advent of digital streaming services, such as [[Netflix]] and digital video stores like [[iTunes]] and [[Google Play Store]], one can also purchase a season pass to gain the ability to watch every episode of a chosen season at one's leisure on a computer or mobile device.

== Other uses ==
Other examples of venues that often offer season passes include amusement parks, recreational sports venues (ski areas), and paid-admission parks (state and national parks). Some passes may also grant additional perks, such as free or prepaid parking, or coupons exclusive to pass-holders.

[[File:Seated Bishop.jpg|thumb|''Seated Bishop'']]
'''''Seated Bishop''''' is a [[Tilia|lindenwood]] statue carved by [[Tilman Riemenschneider]]. Completed in 1495 during the transition period between late [[Gothic art|Gothic]] and [[Renaissance]], it currently resides in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] as part of the [[The Cloisters|Cloisters Collection]].

Keeping in the lindenwood sculpting tradition of the time, the statue was not painted, only a few details were stained in black for emphasis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7175">The '''Subaltern Studies Group''' ('''SSG''') or '''Subaltern Studies Collective''' is a group of [[South Asian]] scholars interested in the [[postcolonial]] and post-[[empire|imperial]] societies which started at the [[University of Sussex]] in 1979–80.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781444334982_chunk_g978144433498223_ss1-28&lt;/ref&gt; The term '''Subaltern Studies''' is sometimes also applied more broadly to others who share many of their views. Their [[Essentialism|anti-essentialist]] approach&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Atabaki|first=Touraj|authorlink=Touraj Atabaki|title=Beyond Essentialism: Who Writes Whose Past in the Middle East and Central Asia? Inaugural lecture, 13 December 2002|url=http://atabaki.nl/upload/Beyond%20Essentialism.pdf|year=2003|location=Amsterdam}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of [[People's history|history from below]], focused more on what happens among the masses at the base levels of society than among the elite.

==Definition==
The term "[[Subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern]]" in this context is an allusion to the work of Italian [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[Antonio Gramsci]] (1891–1937). It refers to any person or group of inferior rank or station, whether because of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[social class|class]], [[gender]], [[sexual orientation]], [[ethnicity]], or [[religion]]. 

The SSG arose in the 1980s, influenced by the scholarship of [[Eric Stokes (historian)|Eric Stokes]] and [[Ranajit Guha]], to attempt to formulate a new narrative of the history of India and South Asia. The group started at the [[University of Sussex]] and then continued and traveled, mainly through Guha's students.&lt;ref&gt;https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/history/students/modules/hi323/lectures/ranajit_guha_and_subaltern_studies_sakar_2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This narrative strategy most clearly inspired by the writings of Gramsci was explicated in the writings of their "mentor" [[Ranajit Guha]], most clearly in his "manifesto" in Subaltern Studies I and also in his classic monograph ''The Elementary Aspects of Peasant Insurgency''. Although they are, in a sense, on the [[left-wing politics|left]], they are very critical of the traditional Marxist narrative of Indian history, in which semi-[[feudal]] India&lt;!--whoa. this claim of feudalism was already invented for the subcontinent by British ethnographers well before Marx.--&gt; was colonized by the [[United Kingdom|British]], became politicized, and earned its [[independence]]. In particular, they are critical of the focus of this narrative on the political consciousness of elites, who in turn inspire the masses to resistance and rebellion against the British. 

Instead, they focus on non-elites — subalterns — as agents of political and social change. They have had a particular interest in the discourses and rhetoric of emerging political and social movements, as against only highly visible actions like demonstrations and uprisings.

==Criticism==

One of the group's early contributors, [[Sumit Sarkar]], later began to critique it. He entitled one of his essays "Decline of the Subaltern in Subaltern Studies", criticizing the turn to Foucauldian studies of power-knowledge that left behind many of the empiricist and Marxist efforts of the first two volumes of ''Subaltern Studies''. He writes that the socialist inspiration behind the early volumes led to a greater impact in India itself, while the later volumes' focus on western discourse reified the subaltern-colonizer divide and then rose in prominence mainly in western academia.&lt;ref&gt;Sumit Sarkar, “The Decline of the. Subaltern in Subaltern Studies” in his Writing Sggial History. Delhi,. Oxford University Press, 1997. &lt;/ref&gt; Even [[Gayatri Spivak]], one of the most prominent names associated with the movement, has called herself a critic of "metropolitan post-colonialism".&lt;ref&gt;Gayatri_Chakravorty_Spivak, A_Critique_of_Postcolonialism, Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian sociologist [[Vivek Chibber]] has criticized the premise of Subaltern Studies for its obfuscation of [[class (social)|class]] struggle and [[Marxian class theory|class formation]] in its analysis, and accused it of excising [[Exploitation of labour|class exploitation]] from the story of the oppression of the [[Subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern]]. &lt;ref name=jacobinmag&gt;{{cite web|title=How does the subaltern speak?|url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2013/04/how-does-the-subaltern-speak/|publisher=jacobinmag}}&lt;/ref&gt; His critique, explained in his book [[Postcolonial Theory and the Specter of Capital]], is focused on the works of two Indian scholars: [[Ranajit Guha]] and [[Dipesh Chakrabarty]].

[[Rajiv Malhotra]], an Indologist, has fiercely criticized Subaltern Studies as being hijacked by vested interests with left and far-left leaning as a tool for political gain, spreading communist ideology and, even, diverted to spread neocolonial ideas in India.&lt;ref&gt;https://rajivmalhotra.com/library/articles/axis-neocolonialism/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/BattleForSanskritRajivMalhotra/Battle%20for%20Sanskrit%20Rajiv%20Malhotra_djvu.txt&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pgurus.com/rajiv-malhotras-lecture-on-swadeshi-indology-part2-colonization/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/mughals-also-colonized-india-our-definition-of-colonization-limited-indian-american-researcher/story-dNDMmrJMg2jUS3VqiAK39I.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/rajivmessage/status/871807569282707457&lt;/ref&gt;.

{{Other uses|Australian Journal (disambiguation){{!}}Australian Journal}}''The Australian Journal'' was one of Australia's most successful and influential magazines, running for ninety-seven years from 1865 to its final issue printed in 1962. The magazine began as 'A Weekly Record of Amusing and Instructive Literature, Science and the Arts'&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Way We Were: Australian Popular Magazines 1856 to 1969|last=Lindesay|first=Vane|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1983|isbn=|location=Melbourne|pages=19-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;, but gradually became a more focussed publication of popular short stories written by Australian writers for readers across both genders and age groups. 

==History==

''The Australian Journal'' began as a weekly publication for its first four years before stretching out to monthly issues. The monthly issues sold for 6d for a number of years, offering value for money in a marketplace where it was competing with publications from [[England]]. Each issue contained a variety or departments for both sexes and all ages, which attributed to its success. During the Depression and into [[World War II]], the magazine maintained a circulation of around 100,000 in the 1930s and 40s and peaked at 120,000 in 1945. A circulation that was second only to [[The Bulletin]]. ''The Australian Journal'' supplied popular fiction to all Australians by offering a wide range of fiction of varying genres - adventure, romance, mystery, and crime/detective stories set in Australian cities or in the Bush.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A typical issue of ''The Australian Journal'' was likely to include: a few serials headed by illustrations, a comic tale, half-a-dozen pages of advertisements, some full-page illustrations, several poems and short stories, a paper pattern illustration for a lady's frock, as well as a few non-fiction articles.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Webby|first=Elizabeth|date=July 2004|title=The Australian Journal Periodical|url=http://www.austlit.edu.au/austlit/page/C498899|journal=AusLit|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quality of the work varied throughout the issues, which likely played a part in the success of the magazine. The works ranged from the 'Sixpenny Dreadful' class of stories through to works of the highest literary standard.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This allowed the journal a wide readership and works that would appeal to a whole family or peer group.

By the 1920s ''The Australian Journal'' was marketing itself as a [[literary magazine]]. The front cover of the August 1926 issue sports an illustration of a cowboy on horseback with a revolver in hand, with a line from a featured short story at the bottom of the page which reads - "'Shoot! And be d--- to you!' 'PARTNERS' - A Great Short Story in This Issue." The cover also advertises the inclusion of works by 'popular authors' Arthur J. Palk, W.D. Flannery, Rex Grayson, and H.G. Barwick.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although being aimed at both men and women, this particular issue seems to target adolescent boys. The journal had a wide range of subject matter on its covers over the ninety-seven years of its publication, with each issue perhaps targeting a specific audience to keep its readership as widespread as possible.

== Later Era ==
In the 1950s editorial changes were made to modernise the magazine for a changing audience. Crossword puzzles were introduced, as well as a children's page, recipes, and fashion articles. This left less room for fiction works and blurred the magazine's focus. As the readership began to decline the size of the magazine reduced from eighty-two to seventy four pages, and again to sixty-six pages until it folded in 1962.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Television]] has been accused of aiding in the magazine's decline, but it is more likely the magazine failed due to a combination of issues, including changing habits in its readership and the magazine's dilution of its original concept and features in an attempt to move with the times.

== Editors ==

=== Marcus Clarke ===
Marcus Andrew Hislop Clarke was born in London on the 24th of April, 1846 and died in 1881. His father was a barrister and his mother passed away a few months after his birth. In 1864, Clarke set off for Melbourne, initially staying with his uncle. After a short stint working at a bank, he moved out to work on a station and discovered the beauty of the Australian bush, which would have a great influence on his writing. He continued to write and sketch, being a talented cartoonist and illustrator as well as a writer, and had his work published under the pen name Marcus Scrivener.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Australian Tales. Vol. 1.|last=Clarke|first=Marcus|publisher=A. &amp; W. Bruce|year=1896|isbn=|location=Melbourne|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that Clarke lost this job as a station hand in part because his influence over the other workers was showing in their eagerness to take more regular breaks to read novels under a tree.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Whether this is true or not, Clarke's time as a station hand would have reached its end sooner or later as his literary ambitions began to grow. Not long after leaving the station, Clarke found work in Melbourne as a member of the literary staff of the ''Argus'' journal.

Clarke's first (although unfinished) novel, ''Long Odds'', appeared in serial form in the ''Colonial Monthly,'' yet he was only able to write a few chapters before being thrown from his horse and fracturing his skull. In 1869 Clarke took on the editorship of Humbug and around the same time married Marian Dunn. Shortly after this, Clarke began work on His Natural Life and spent a brief stint as the editor of ''The Australian Journal''. Under Clarke's leadership of ''The Australian Journal'', the magazine lent a focus toward accepting submissions set in the colonies and by domestic writers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

Marcus Clarke greatly assisted the popularity of ''The Australian Journal'' by publishing his celebrated work, ''His Natural LIfe'' in serial format. Clarke later altered the story to better suit the longer form of a novel and renamed it ''[[For the Term of His Natural Life|For The Term of his Natural Life]].''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The novel went on to garner widespread success in Australia, Britain and America and was also translated into German.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Unknown|first=.|date=November 1996|title=“The Australian Journal’s 1881 Introduction to His Natural Life.”|url=|journal=Margin|volume=40|pages=3-6|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Australian Journal'' declared in 1881 that ''For The Term of his Natural Life'' should be "read by the youth of Australia and accepted as a classic."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; [[Mark Twain]] made a similar statement to this when giving a visiting lecture in Melbourne in October, 1895. In his lecture, Twain referred to Clarke as a literary genius, and argued that "no works of such a man should be left unpublished."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Twain also commented on Clarke's popularity in Australia, suggesting that "we think a deal more of Marcus Clarke in our country than I am sorry to think you do here."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Perhaps Clarke would have been better off living outside of Australia, as he spent a fair deal of his life dealing with pecuniary difficulties, despite the widespread success of his work. Clarke passed away at the early age of 35, robbing Australian literature of many more great works. 

Clarke contributed to many periodicals, including the popular Australian publication, ''[[The Bulletin]]''. ''[[The Bulletin]]'' published a short article following Clarke's death stating their willingness to accept subscriptions in aid of his widow and children. They also released a memorial volume of Clarke's collected writings, sold for one guinea. They declared Clarke to be "the most brilliant man of letters this country has yet seen."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haynes and Archibald|first=|date=3 September 1881|title=The Bulletin|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-134048487|journal=The Bulletin|volume=Vol.7 No.84|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== R.G. Campbell ===
Ron Campbell was a school teacher in the 1920s with the ambition of writing the great Australian novel. He submitted work to ''The Australian Journal'' and worked as a teacher and writer between 1922 and 1926 until he took over the editorship of ''The Australian Journal'' from his 81-year-old predecessor, Mr. Adcock.

Campbell was editor of ''The Australian Journal'' for just under thirty years, from 1926-1955. During this period the opportunities for freelance short story and serial writers peaked, with Campbell also placing a strong focus on publishing Australian writers and writing. In the decades before he was appointed editor, the magazine relied on a mixture of domestic work as well as syndicated fiction from overseas, in particular England and the United States. Campbell took his work seriously and although the publication aimed for a wide audience he begrudged the "'academics and highbrows' for suggesting that the ''Australian Journal'' 'was a trivial publication suitable only for the less knowledgeable type of housewife.'"&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Osborne|first=Roger|date=2017|title="Dairy Farm Philosopher: J.P. McKinney's 'According to Noonan' Stories and Ron Campbell's Australian Journal."|url=|journal=Queensland Review|volume=24, no. 2|pages=293|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet he, himself, wrote that ''The Australian Journal'' readers were "mainly women, with limited literary tastes and expectations."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Campbell endeavoured to develop continued relationships with the Australian writers that contributed to the Journal during his editorship, and to encourage younger writers trying to build their careers. By the 1940s, ''The Australian Journal'' was one of the few Australian periodicals that was willing to pay its contributors a competitive rate for their submissions. However, it was during this time that Campbell complained of the declining number of Australian writers able to produce quality work in the short story format, stating that "the fact remains that of late years the number of writers who can turn out the well-constructed and characteristic yarn of between 5,000 and 6,000 words seems to be diminishing."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Campbell went on to create an anthology of works featured in ''The Australian Journal'' during his editorship. The collection was titled ''The Australian Journal Story Book'', but was never published. Campbell had a semi-regular editorial column in the Journal that he titled 'In Passing'.

The importance of Campbell's work as editor of ''The Australian Journal'' and his contribution to [[Australian literature]] can be seen in the dedications to Campbell in novels from authors such as [[Robert Close|Robert S. Close]] and S.H. Courtier.

'''''The Lost City''''' is an independently made [[science fiction film]] [[Serial (film)|serial]] created and produced in 1935 by [[Sherman S. Krellberg]] and directed by [[Harry Revier]].

==Plot==
Scientist Bruce Gordon comes to a secluded area in Africa after concluding that a series of electrically induced natural disasters had originated from in the area.  There he finds the crazed Zolok, last of the [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemurians]], in a secret complex inside a mountain.
Zolok had created the natural disasters as a prelude to his attempt to take over the world, holding a brilliant scientist, Dr. Manyus, there hostage, along with his daughter, Natcha. He had forced Manyus to create mindless "giant" slaves out of the natives as a private army and as the serial progresses we learn Manyus also turned another tribe, the spider-worshipping Wangas, into thin, impotent whites.  Gordon helps Manyus and his daughter to escape Zolok, but they encounter Ben Ali, a malignant slave trader; meet the sexy native Queen Rama, who tries to help them; and survive harrowing jungle adventures before returning to the Lost City and stopping Zolok's plan.

==Production==
The film took the  premise of that year's ''[[The Phantom Empire]]'' but transferred the [[lost city|lost civilization]] motif from the west to another popular serial locale, the [[Africa]]n [[jungle]].

==Feature-length versions==
Sherman S. Krellberg had the serial edited into four different feature versions over time, perhaps setting a record for feature versions of a serial.  The first feature consisted of the first three episodes of the serial and the first reel of the fourth episode edited together, and supplemented with footage not part of the serial itself which drew the adventure to a loose conclusion; and the second was compiled from material in the first and last four chapters of the serial, omitting the adventures with the slave traders, the spider people and Queen Rama, but ending as did the serial.  Both these features were made and released in 1935 and both were also called '''The Lost City'''.  The first of these was also designed so that it could be followed over successive weeks by the remaining chapters in the serial.

In the early '40s Krellberg created a new feature version that incorporated material from the adventures with the slavers, spider people and jungle queen, and released this under the title ''City of Lost Men''.  Finally, in the 1970s, he took the first feature version and clumsily edited in, at the end, most of the footage from the last chapter, creating what goes beyond a [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] gap and is rather a continuity ''abyss'', and attached the '''City of Lost Men''' title to this feature.

It's not clear whether the last feature had an actual theatrical release or went directly to television.  The first '''City of Lost Men''' appears to be lost, and videos and DVDs being sold under that title are sourced from film prints of this final feature.  Since it incorporates the entire first feature version entitled '''Lost City''', that film cannot fairly be said to be lost, although no separate video issue of that version under its own titles, is known.  Video/DVD offerings of '''The Lost City''' as a feature are from prints of the second feature version described.

In [[philosophy]], a sentence which asserts incomplete truth conditions for a proposition may be regarded as a truism.{{cn|date=June 2017}} An example of such a sentence would be "Under appropriate conditions, the sun rises."  Without contextual support{{spaced ndash}}a statement of what those appropriate conditions are{{spaced ndash}}the sentence is true but incontestable. A statement which is true by definition (for example, the [[Lapalissade]] "If he were not dead, he would still be alive") would also be considered a truism.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

The word may also be used with a different sense in [[rhetoric]], to disguise the fact that a proposition is really just an [[opinion]].{{Example needed}} {{cn|date=June 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11412">Between 1942 and 1945, during [[World War II]], [[Walt Disney Productions]] was involved in the production of [[propaganda film]]s for the [[U.S. government]]. The widespread familiarity of Disney's productions benefited the U.S. government in producing pro-American war propaganda in an effort to increase support for the war.

==  Disney's involvement ==
During World War II, Disney made films for every branch of the [[U.S. military]] and government. The government looked to Walt Disney more than any other studio chief as a  builder of public morale providing instruction and training  the sailors and soldiers."&lt;ref name="war"&gt;{{cite journal

In 1942, Disney was approached with requests from the U.S. services.&lt;ref name="animat"/&gt; The [[U.S. Navy|Navy]] was the first, and other branches of the government, including the [[U.S. Army|Army]], the [[Army Air Forces]], the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]], and the [[U.S. Treasury Department|Treasury Department]], rapidly caught on to Disney’s creative approach to generating educational films, propaganda and insignias.

As well as producing films for different government divisions from 1942 to 1943, Disney was asked to create animation for a series of pictures produced by Colonel [[Frank Capra]] for the U.S. Army.&lt;ref name="animat"/&gt; This series included films such as ''[[Prelude to War]]'' and ''America goes to War''. Although these films were originally intended for servicemen, they were released to theaters because of their popularity.

===The Navy productions===
The Navy first requested 90,000 feet of film to be ready in three months. The purpose of these films was to educate sailors on navigation tactics. This was a shock for Disney, as he was used to creating 27,000 feet of film in a year.&lt;ref name="animat"/&gt;

The [[Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs]] also requested educational films for aviation branches of the government. The subjects of these films varied widely from aerology and not compact tactics to ground crew aircraft maintenance.&lt;ref name="victory"&gt;{{cite journal

===The Treasury Department productions===

Disney created ''[[The New Spirit]]'' (1942) after a request from the [[U.S. Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]], [[Henry Morgenthau, Jr.]], to make Americans accept the payment of income taxes. The film was followed by ''[[The Spirit of '43]]'' (1943). In this film, Donald Duck deals with income taxes and shows their benefit to the American war effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===The Army Air Forces (USAAF or AAF) productions===
Aerology film production was supervised by naval aviation experts and some members of Disney's team learned how to fly to better understand the problems the Army Air Forces encountered.&lt;ref name="war"/&gt; ''[[Victory Through Air Power (film)|Victory Through Air Power]]'' (1943) is one of the propaganda films Disney produced for [[air warfare]].&lt;ref name="victory"/&gt; This film is an attempt to sell [[Major]] [[Alexander de Seversky]]'s theories about the practical uses of long range [[strategic bombing]]. The animated film humorously tells about the development of air warfare and then switches to the Major illustrating how his ideas could win the war for the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]].

===Propaganda productions===

As requested by the US Government, Walt Disney created a number of anti-German and anti-Japanese films for both the soldiers and the US public. He wanted to portray these countries and their leaders as manipulative without morals. A few of the films he produced were ''[[Reason and Emotion]]'' (1943), ''[[Der Fuehrer's Face]]'' (1942), ''[[Education for Death|Education for Death - The Making of a Nazi]]'' (1943), and ''[[Commando Duck]]'' (1944). {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}
 
In ''Der Fuehrer’s Face'', Donald Duck experiences a day in a Nazi country where he has to make do with eating ridiculous Nazi food rations (smell of bacon and eggs, coffee made with one bean, and a slice of stale bread) experiences a day at a Nazi artillery factory and breaks down. He wakes up realizing that the experience was a nightmare, embraces a model of the [[Statue of Liberty]] and exclaims ''Am I glad to be a citizen of the United States of America!''

''Education for Death - The Making of a Nazi'' was a wartime propaganda film that takes on the perspective of Hans, a young German boy. As the movie progresses and Hans is exposed to Hitler youth and the Nazi culture, his ability to value human life decreases. In ''Commando Duck'', Donald, by himself, destroys an entire Japanese airbase.

==Emigration to the New World==

William Farrar was the 3rd son of John Farrer the Elder, Esquire of London and Croxton, Lincolnshire, a wealthy merchant and gent of London.&lt;ref name="Holmes1972" /&gt;{{rp|25}} At the time of Farrar's venture to the New World, Virginia was still a joint stock company, the [[Virginia Company of London]], sanctioned by [[Royal charter#United Kingdom|Royal Charter]].&lt;ref name="Wolfe2016"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Virginia_Company_of_London|title=Virginia Company of London|last=Wolfe|first=Brenden|date=2016-11-16|website=www.encyclopediavirginia.org|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180813020737/https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Virginia_Company_of_London#|archive-date=August 13, 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-11-05|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farrar was a subscriber to the Third Charter of the Virginia Company.

}}

On March 16, 1618, William Farrar sailed from London to Virginia aboard the ''Neptune'' with [[Lord delaware|Lord Delaware]], who had been urged by the settlers to return to Virginia as a governor and who had persuaded many of the gentry to emigrate to Virginia. Although the ship was a large one, with 200 passengers, specially equipped by the [[Virginia Company]] for Lord Delaware's return, the voyage was a long, perilous one lasting sixteen weeks.&lt;ref name="Holmes1972" /&gt;{{rp|13}}&lt;ref name="Holmes1972" /&gt;{{rp|112}}

Farrar was granted 100 acres where the [[Appomattox River|Appomattox]] flowed into the [[James River]], at a location known now as [[Hopewell, Virginia|Hopewell]]. &amp;nbsp;In colonial times Hopewell was part of [[Bermuda Hundred, Virginia]].&lt;ref name="Holmes1972" /&gt;{{rp|113}} At the time of the 1622 [[Jamestown Massacre]], William Farrar was living with 21 others at a community located on the south bank of the Appomattox as it emptied into the James River, the patent was named Bermuda's Hundred, hundred being an old Saxon description of a land that could field 100 men for a [[fyrd]] or support 100 families.&lt;ref name="Regia Anglorum"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://regia.org/research/warfare/fyrd1.htm|title=The Fyrd (Army) in Anglo-Saxon England|last=Levick|first=Ben|date=1995|website=Regia Anglorum|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jamestown Massacre ==
During the [[Indian massacre of 1622]], which began on Good Friday, March 22, 1622, ten people were killed at William Farrar's house on the Appomattox River.&lt;ref name="Holmes1972" /&gt;{{rp|113}} Being forewarned by [[Richard Pace (Jamestown)|Richard Pace]] of Paces Paines, Farrar escaped with ten others. They rowed down the James River to [[Jordan Point, Virginia|Beggars Bush]] which apparently was well fortified and protected. Beggars Bush became known as Jordans Journey, today [[Jordan Point, Virginia]]. William Farrar quickly made a place for himself in the colony acting as appraiser, executor of estates, a member of the [[King's Council#England|King's Council]] and justice of two counties.&lt;ref name="Holmes1972" /&gt;{{rp|110}} William Farrar was first granted 100 acres on the [[Appomattox River]], [[Charles City County, Virginia]] about three miles from where it flows into the [[James River]].

{{See also|Cicely Jordan Farrar#Dispute with Rev. Greville Pooley}}
[[Samuel Jordan]] died in March 1623. His wife [[Cicely Jordan Farrar|Cecily]] was with child. Farrar sought the hand of Samuel Jordan's widow, whom Reverend Greville Pooley had already claimed, thus leading to the first [[Breach of promise]] suit filed in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/23506275/breach_of_promise_case_at_jamestown_va/|title=America's First Breach of Promise Case|last=Starrett|first=Vincent|date=March 3, 1958|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|access-date=November 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pooley was persuaded by the Reverend Samuel Purchase to drop the case. On January 3, 1624/25 he signed an agreement freely acquitting Mrs. Jordan of her former promises. William and Cecily married.&lt;ref name="Holmes1972" /&gt;{{rp|115–117}}

==Background==
The important [[Virginia Assembly]], established by the [[Great Charter]] in 1619, had functioned five years when [[James I]] dissolved the Virginia Company in 1624, and was not called to reconvene until 1628. During this period of great uncertainty and insecurity for the colonists, not knowing what to expect under Royal rule, the King's Council, formed to represent the Royal government, made the laws and all decisions, most of which were later ratified by the Assembly when it was recalled. As late as 1632, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] appointed a commission, which included [[Nicholas Ferrar]]. the younger and John Ferrar Esquire, "as Council of Superintendence over Virginia, empowering them to ascertain the state of its laws, commerce and government and report back to his Majesty."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UOBjDPUZDDAC&amp;pg=PA187&amp;lpg=PA187&amp;dq=%22Council+of+Superintendence+over+Virginia,%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CJQ49yE3_t&amp;sig=J_otryI2STUuiH96QvS6YAa4Gro&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjknNq_uMHeAhUorFQKHRYNDnEQ6AEwAXoECAYQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Council%20of%20Superintendence%20over%20Virginia%2C%22&amp;f=false|title=History of Colony and Ancient Dominion of Virginia|last=Campbell|first=Charles|publisher=J.B.

Rights not granted or recognized in the first two King's Council
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3678204?read-now=1&amp;googleloggedin=true&amp;seq=8#page_scan_tab_contents |first=J.

C. M. Gayley states in ''Shakespeare and the Founders of Liberty in America'': ''"Jefferson was right when he said that 'the ball of the Revolution received its first impulse, not from the actors in the event, but from the first colonists"&lt;ref name="Gayley 1917"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gayley |first=Charles Mills|title=Shakespeare and the Founding of America|publisher=MACMILLAN COMPANY |date=1917 |volume=II |page=113 )}}&lt;/ref&gt;''

In the list of burgesses for 1631/32, Arrowhattocks, Neck-of-Land and Curles were represented by Capt. Thomas Osborne, while "both Shirley Hundreds, Mr. ffarrars and Chaplaynes were represented by Francis Eppes and Walter Afton".&lt;ref name="McIlwaine 1915"&gt;{{cite book |last=McIlwaine |first=H R |title=Journals of the House of Burgesses Virginia 1619-1658/59  |publisher=Richmond Virginia|date=1915 |pages=XII,48,51,125 )}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus William Farrar was not at the Neck-of Land (Farrar's Island) and it may be that it was only after the sale of his inheritance in London in 1631 that the  2,000 acre grant was patented, apparently from money received from his inheritance. Whatever the date, the delay proved fortunate for William Farrar, for he was able to select one of the choicest locations, the site of [[Henricus]] Towne, the second settlement in the colony. His land extending to Varina,&lt;ref name="Holmes1972" /&gt;{{rp|163}} the county seat, and his duties as "chief" justice of the county made him a close neighbor and associate of the leading families of Henrico as well as [[Charles City County, Virginia]].

William Farrar died before 10 June 1637,&lt;ref name="Holmes1972" /&gt;{{rp|164}} the date on which his son William received a patent in Virginia as his heir for 2000 acres in Henrico County.

One of the most dramatic events occurring during William Farrar's tenure on the Council was the arrest and deportation of Governor [[John Harvey (Virginia)]] "a Royal governor who had exercised unbearable tyrannical and arbitrary power." After an eventful decade during which the Virginia Company was overthrown along with the loss of a representative form of government which it had attempted to establish there was uncertainty about what to expect from Royal rule. In March 1634 the Council reluctantly voted to accept the loss of prime territories to Lord Baltimore, but rebelled against Gov. Harvey. William Farrar was one of a committee of 20 appointed to arrest Gov. Harvey and return him to England in protest.&lt;ref name="Brown 1901"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Brown | first=Alexander| title=English Politics in Early Virginia History \publication-date=1901 | publisher=HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN AND COMPANY |date=1901|page=100 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vkwSAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA268&amp;lpg=PA268&amp;dq=English+politics+in+early+virginia+history&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uY-XS1rYuZ&amp;sig=Flog6FZw74fL8JTlMIXAXyTuxG4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwicrfCMn8veAhXVHjQIHcieCl8Q6AEwEXoECAQQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=English%20politics%20in%20early%20virginia%20history&amp;f=false| accessdate=10 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
