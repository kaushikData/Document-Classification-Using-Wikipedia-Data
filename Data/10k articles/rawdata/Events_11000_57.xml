Since 1949, a series of armed skirmishes and firefights have occurred along the [[Durand Line]] (the Afghanistan–Pakistan border) between the [[Afghan National Security Forces]] and the [[Pakistan Armed Forces]]. The latest hostilities, which are ongoing, began with the [[Fall of Kabul|overthrow of the Taliban government]].

== Background ==
Hostilities existed between Afghanistan and the newly independent Pakistan since 1947,&lt;ref name="Emadi"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Durand Line and Afghan-Pak relations | author=Emadi, Hafiullah | journal=Economic and Political Weekly | year=1990 | volume=25 | issue=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; when Afghanistan became the only country to vote against the admission of Pakistan to the United Nations.&lt;ref name="Hassan"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Pakistan-Afghanistan relations | author=Hasan, Khurshid | year=1962 | volume=2 | issue=7 | pages=14–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afghanistan advocated the independence of Pakistan's [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] to form [[Pashtunistan]],&lt;ref name="FairWatson2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=C.

The International border between the [[British Raj]] and Afghanistan was established after the 1893 ''Durand Line Agreement'' between [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Mortimer Durand]] of the [[British Empire]] and [[list of monarchs of Afghanistan|Amir]] [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] of Afghanistan for fixing the limit of their respective [[spheres of influence]]. The single-page agreement, which contains seven short articles, was signed by Durand and Khan, agreeing not to exercise political interference beyond the [[frontier]] line between Afghanistan and what was then the [[British Indian Empire]].
&lt;ref name="LoC-Smith"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/geogmap/pub/afghanistan.html |title=A Selection of Historical Maps of Afghanistan – The Durand Line|publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |location=United States |first=Cynthia |last=Smith |date=August 2004|accessdate=11 February 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110206215137/http://www.loc.gov/rr/geogmap/pub/afghanistan.html| archivedate= 6 February 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Durand Line]] was reaffirmed as the International Border between Afghanistan and British Raj in the [[Third Anglo-Afghan War|1919 Anglo-Afghan War]] after the Afghan tactical defeat. The Afghans undertook to stop interference on the British side of the line in the subsequent [[Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1919]] in Rawalpindi.&lt;ref name=Sidebotham&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200607170060|title=The Third Afghan War|last=Sidebotham|first=Herbert|year=1919|work=New Statesman, 16 August 1919|accessdate=17 January 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605041635/http://www.newstatesman.com/200607170060 |archivedate=5 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pakistan inherited the Durand Line agreement after its [[Independence Day (Pakistan)|independence]] in 1947, but the Afghan Government has always refused to accept the Durand Line Agreement. Afghanistan has several times tried to seize Pakistan's western provinces of [[Balochistan]] and [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]]. The then Afghan Prime Minister, Muhammad Hashim, said "if an independent Pashtunistan cannot be set up, the frontier province should join Afghanistan. Our neighbor Pakistan will realize that our country, with its population and trade, needs an outlet to the sea, which is very essential", in an interview with the Statesman.&lt;ref name="Emadi"/&gt; In 1949, Pakistan Air Force bombed the Afghan sponsored militant camps in border areas including an Afghan village to curb an unrest led by Ipi Faqir propagating independent Pashtunistan.&lt;ref name="Pakistan Defence Journal"&gt;{{cite web|last=Amin |first=Abdul Hameed |title=Remembering our Warriors: Major-General Baber and Bhutto's Operation Cyclone. |work=Pakistan Military Consortium and Directorate for the Military History Research (DMHR) |publisher=Pakistan Defence Journal |year=2001 |url=http://www.defencejournal.com/2001/apr/babar.htm |accessdate=30 October 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428172353/http://www.defencejournal.com/2001/apr/babar.htm |archivedate=28 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Border clashes were reported in 1949–50 for the first time.&lt;ref name="Hassan"/&gt; On September 30, 1950, Pakistan claimed that Afghan troops and tribesmen had crossed into Pakistan's Balochistan, but the low-scale invasion was repelled after six days of fighting. The Afghan government denied its involvement and claimed that they were pro-Pashtunistan Pashtun tribesmen.&lt;ref&gt;http://yalejournal.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Article-Gartenstein_Ross-and-Vassefi.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Tensions soared with the Pakistani [[One Unit]] program, and both countries withdrew ambassadors and diplomatic staff in 1955. The Pakistani Embassy in Kabul and consulates in Kandhar and Jalalabad were attacked by mobs.&lt;ref name="Emadi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hassan"/&gt; In 1960, major skirmishes broke with the Afghan Forces massing out on the Afghan side of the border with tanks. These skirmishes saw the Pakistan Air Force bombarding Afghan forces. This bombardment led to a brief hiatus in the skirmishes. On 6 September 1961, Kabul formally severed diplomatic relations with Pakistan.&lt;ref name="FairWatson2015"/&gt; In 1950 the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] held its view on the Afghan-Pakistan dispute over the Durand Line by stating:{{quote|''[[Government of the United Kingdom|His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom]] has seen with regret the disagreements between the Governments of Pakistan and Afghanistan about the status of the territories on the North West Frontier. It is His Majesty's Government's view that Pakistan is in international law the inheritor of the rights and duties of the old Government of India and of his Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom in these territories and that the Durand Line is the international frontier.&lt;ref&gt;Durand Line, 1956, page 12.''&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Philip Noel-Baker, Baron Noel-Baker|Philip Noel-Baker]]|June 30, 1950}}

At the 1956 SEATO ([[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization]]) Ministerial Council Meeting held at [[Karachi]], capital of Pakistan at the time, it was stated:{{quote|''The members of the Council declared that their governments recognised that the sovereignty of Pakistan extends up to the Durand Line, the international boundary between Pakistan and Afghanistan, and it was consequently affirmed that the Treaty area referred to in Articles IV and VIII of the Treaty includes the area up to that Line.''&lt;ref&gt;Durand Line, 1956, page 13&lt;/ref&gt;|SEATO|March 8, 1956}}

The Afghan government, having secured a treaty in December 1978 that allowed them to call on Soviet forces, repeatedly requested the introduction of troops in Afghanistan in the spring and summer of 1979. The 1979 [[Soviet war in Afghanistan]] forced millions of Afghans to take refuge inside [[Afghans in Pakistan|Pakistan]]. Pakistani officials feared that the Soviet Union began some kind of military show down and that Pakistan or at least its Balochistan province was next on the Soviet agenda. During the early 1980s, multi-national [[mujahideen]] forces (consisting of about 100,000 fighters from forty different Muslim countries in addition to 150,000 local fighters) found support from the United States, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and Iran in the context of the [[Cold War]]. They were trained by Pakistani military in its frontier region around the Durand Line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bt.com.bn/analysis/2008/12/17/story_of_us_cia_and_taliban |title=Story of US, CIA and Taliban |publisher=[[The Brunei Times]] |date=17 December 2008 |first=Michael |last=Parenti |accessdate=30 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205090713/http://www.bt.com.bn/analysis/2008/12/17/story_of_us_cia_and_taliban |archivedate=5 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union decided to withdraw in 1989 and when aid dried up on Afghanistan in 1992, a [[Afghan Civil War (1992-1996)|civil war]] began. This was followed by the rise and fall of the [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan|Taliban government]]. Since late 2001, as high as 140,000 [[NATO]]-led troops were stationed in Afghanistan to [[NATO Training Mission-Afghanistan|train Afghans]] and rebuild their war-torn country. In the meantime, the [[Taliban insurgency]] began around 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2011/06/15/haqqani-network-threatens-attacks-judges|title=Haqqani network threatens attacks on judges|publisher=|accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tolonews.com/en/afghanistan/3249-7-burka-clad-terrorists-captured-in-nangarhar 7 Burka-Clad Terrorists Captured in Nangarhar] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706221614/http://www.tolonews.com/en/afghanistan/3249-7-burka-clad-terrorists-captured-in-nangarhar |date=6 July 2011 }}, by [[Tolo News]]. 4 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; To counter the insurgency and bring stability in Afghanistan, the United States built bases and garrisons for the [[Afghan National Security Forces]], and is using [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s to carry out [[drone attacks in Pakistan]], mainly the [[Haqqani network]] in and around the [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]] (FATA).

In September 2017, [[Brad Sherman]], a US lawmaker, suggested conditioning US aid to Afghanistan to the recognition of Durand Line. He added:
{{quote|''I realise that's tough. They'll say, oh, don't — but the fact is, as long as Afghanistan leaves open the idea that they're claiming Pakistani territory, it’s going to be very hard to get the Pakistanis involved, as we need them involved, in controlling the Afghan Taliban.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1356524|title=US asked to condition Afghan aid to recognition of Durand Line|first=The Newspaper's|last=Correspondent|date=9 September 2017|publisher=|accessdate=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Brad Sherman]]|September 7, 2017}}

== Post Taliban rule skirmishes==
The following is an incomplete list of recent events relating to the Afghanistan–Pakistan skirmishes. Most of these events cannot be independently verified because news journalists usually have very limited access to reaching the areas where the fighting take place.

* '''13 May 2007''' – Afghan soldiers attacked Pakistani military outposts which they claimed were illegally built on Afghan soil, one Pakistani soldier was injured. Pakistan's military responded with artillery fire on targets in Afghanistan, reportedly destroying three ANA border posts killing 32 Afghan soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;indiaenews. [http://www.indiaenews.com/asia/20070514/51526.htm "Pakistan, Afghan forces on border"]. Retrieved 13 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Afghanistan also accused Pakistani military ground contingent crossed the border more than a mile into Afghanistan's Paktia province and killed two Afghan civilians. Gen. Azimi also accused the Pakistani military of using [[artillery]], saying the alleged attack was a clear violation.&lt;ref name=Afghan_claims&gt;{{cite news | title= Pakistani, Afghan troops clash at border| date=13 May 2007 | publisher=Newsone.ca|url=http://www.newsone.ca/westfallweeklynews/stories/index.php?action=fullnews&amp;id=7099}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''3 February 2011''' – One Pakistani and 7 Afghan soldiers were killed and three others injured after a clash broke out along the border between Pakistani and Afghan forces including an Afghan Colonel. 3 Afghan Soldiers was arrested by Pakistani Forces and later returned. An Afghan commander in Khost confirmed the exchange of fire and alleged that the incident broke out after Pakistani troops in Waziristan opened fire towards Afghan police posts in [[Gurbuz District]], claiming the Afghan engagement as retaliation. However, a military official in Peshawar said Afghan troops fired on an army check post in [[Ghulam Khan]], North Waziristan and that the fire emanated from Afghan territory first. "We are responding with artillery and mortars," he added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/112950/soldier-killed-in-exchange-of-fire-on-pak-afghan-border/|title=Afghanistan-Pakistan border: Pakistani soldier killed as troops exchange fire|work=[[The Express Tribune]]|date=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''28 April 2011''' – Border firing broke out in South Waziristan. At least 12 Afghan troops and one soldier from the [[Pakistan Frontier Corps]] were killed in the clash, although another source put the Afghan casualties at 8. The attack came just a week after Afghan soldiers had struck in [[Lower Dir]], killing 2 Pakistani security personnel and 40 militants. According to the Pakistani military, Afghan troops opened "unprovoked firing" from across the border and also damaged a market, causing troops from the Pakistani side to respond with fire. However, Afghanistan blamed Pakistan for the clash and denied any Afghan casualties, claiming that only three Pakistani troops were killed. According to Pakistani intelligence analysts, foreign coalition forces have been encouraging Afghan troops to attack border posts. Pakistan also demanded an immediate meeting to discuss the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/157727/afghan-forces-attack-pakistan-army-check-post-4-wounded/|title=Pak-Afghan relations: Border clash mars peace overtures|work=[[The Express Tribune]]|date=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6898">'''Hashim''' ([[Arabic]]/[[Persian language|Persian]]: هاشم), better known as '''al-Muqanna‘''' ({{lang-ar|المقنع}} '''"The Veiled"''', died ca. 783.&lt;ref name="enc"/&gt; was a '''[[Persian people|Persian]]''' who claimed to be a [[prophet]], and founded a religion which was a mixture of [[Zoroastrianism]] and [[Islam]]. He was a chemist, and one of his experiments caused an explosion in which a part of his face was burnt. For the rest of his life he used a veil and thus was known as '''"Hashemi"''' ''("The Veiled One")''. Nafisi and Arian-Pour have elaborated him on the '''"[[Khurramites|Khorrām-Dīnān]]"''' armies.

== Name and early life ==
Before he came to be known by the nickname of "al-Muqanna", he was called by his birth name, Hashim. Early scholars believed that he was born in [[Sogdia]]. However, it is now agreed that his birthplace was in [[Balkh]], a city close to Sogdia.

== Biography ==
'''Hāshem''' was an  ethnic Persian from [[Merv]], originally a clothes pleater. He became a commander for '''[[Abu Muslim|Vehzādān Pour Vandād Hormozd]]''' ''(Known By The Arabs As: Abu Muslim)'' of [[Greater Khorasan|Xorāsān]] province of '''[[Iran]]''' ''([[Persia]])''. After Vehzādān's murder in 755 AD, Hashem claimed to be an [[incarnation]] of God, a role, he insisted, passed to him from Abū Muslim, who received it via [[Ali|‘Alī]] from the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]].  Hāshem was reputed to wear a veil in order to cover up his beauty, whereas his followers wore white clothes in opposition to Abbasid invaders' black. He is reputed to have engaged in magic and miracles in order to gain his followers.

Hāshem was instrumental in the formation of the [[Khurramites|Xhorrām-Dīnān]] armies which was led by '''[[Babak Khorramdin|Pāpak Xorram-Din]]''', a [[Persia]]n uprising whose intent was to overthrow the invading Arabs. When Hāshem's followers started raiding towns and mosques of other Muslims and looting their possessions, the Abbasids sent several commanders to crush the rebellion. Hāshem poisoned himself rather than surrender to the Abbasids, who had set fire to his house. Hāshem died eventually in a [[Persia]]n fort near [[Shahrisabz|Kesh]].&lt;ref name="enc"&gt;The ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]''. 2nd ed. Vol. 7. Page 500.&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, the [[Khurramites|Xhorrām-Dīnān]] armies continued to exist until the 12th century.

In 1787 [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] wrote a two-page short story about Al-Muqanna called "Le masque prophete".&lt;ref&gt;[https://napoleonbonaparte.wordpress.com/2007/08/22/le-masque-prophete-napoleonbonaparte/ Le masque prophète]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first poem in ''[[Lalla-Rookh]]'' (1817) by [[Thomas Moore]] is titled ''The Veiled Prophet of Khorassan'', and the character Mokanna is modeled loosely on al-Muqanna‘.

[[St. Louis]] businessmen referenced Moore's poem in 1878 when they created the Veiled Prophet Organization and concocted a legend of Mokanna as its founder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt;
For many years the organization put on an annual fair and parade called the "Veiled Prophet Fair," which was renamed [[Fair Saint Louis]] in 1992.  The organization also gives a [[debutante]] ball each December called the [[Veiled Prophet Ball]].

The [[Mystic Order of Veiled Prophets of the Enchanted Realm]] (founded 1889), often known as "the Grotto", a [[Side degree|social group]] with membership restricted to [[Freemasonry|Master Masons]], and its female auxiliary, the Daughters of Mokanna (founded 1919), also take their names from Thomas Moore's poem.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Argentina|Argentine]] writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]] used a fictionalized al-Muqanna‘ as the central character of ''[[A Universal History of Infamy|The Masked Dyer, Hakim of Merv]]'', a 1934 short story, and in another story fifteen years later, ''[[The Zahir]]'', as a past avatar of the titular object.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7372">An '''animal control service''' or '''animal control agency''' is an entity charged with responding to requests for help with [[animal]]s ranging from [[Wildlife|wild animals]], dangerous animals, or animals in distress. An individual who works for such an entity was once known as a '''dog catcher''', but is generally now called an '''animal control officer''', and may be an [[employee]] or a [[independent contractor|contractor]] – commonly employed by a [[municipality]], [[county]], [[Shire of Harvey|shire]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harvey.wa.gov.au/services/rangers-services/pound/lost-your-cat-or-dog "RANGER SERVICES / POUND / LOST YOUR CAT OR DOG?"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102225356/http://www.harvey.wa.gov.au/services/rangers-services/pound/lost-your-cat-or-dog |date=January 2, 2016 }}, harvey.wa.gov.au&lt;/ref&gt;, or other subnational government area.

==Duties and function==


Animal control services may be provided by the government or through a contract with a [[humane society]] or society for the prevention of [[cruelty to animals]]. Officers may work for, or with, [[police]] or [[sheriff]] departments, parks and recreation departments, and health departments by confining animals or investigating animal bites to humans.

The most common requirements for this job is some prior experience handling animals on a farm, as a veterinary assistant or animal trainer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animalcontrol.org.nz/Job_Opportunities.html "Entry Requirements"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160123022011/http://www.animalcontrol.org.nz/Job_Opportunities.html |date=2016-01-23 }}, animalcontrol.org.nz&lt;/ref&gt; Training is primarily on the job but some jurisdictions (like Virginia, North Carolina and Texas) require formal and continuing education&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090117073850/http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+3.2-6556 VA Requirements], Code of Virginia&lt;/ref&gt; available from community colleges and trade associations. Some animal cruelty investigators are specially trained police officers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.criminaljusticeprograms.com/specialty/animal-cruelty-investigator/ "Requirements for Becoming an Animal Cruelty Investigator"], criminaljusticeprograms.com&lt;/ref&gt; the New York [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] (ASPCA) employs several Humane Law Enforcement Officers with some police powers (including the power of [[arrest]]); and throughout the United States this arrangement is becoming more common.

Animals may be returned to their owners, or transported to a veterinary clinic or [[animal shelter]]. Animals held in the shelter can be returned to their owners, [[adopted]], released to the wild, held as evidence in a criminal investigation or [[Animal euthanasia|put to sleep.]]&lt;ref&gt;Notaro, Stephen J.

==Politics==
An American colloquialism labels an unpopular politician by saying that he or she "couldn't be elected dogcatcher", with "dogcatcher" referring to a very low-level elected office. In practice, animal control officers are generally appointed by an executive authority and not elected&lt;ref name="Slate"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2273842|title=Dog Race: Is dogcatcher actually an elective office?|last=Beam|first=Christopher|date=5 November 2010|newspaper=[[Slate Magazine]]|accessdate=6 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 U.S. President [[Donald Trump]] criticized Senator [[Bob Corker]] by [[Tweeted|tweeting]]: "Bob Corker, who helped President O give us the bad Iran Deal &amp; couldn't get elected dog catcher in Tennessee, is now fighting Tax Cuts.... /  ...Corker dropped out of the race in Tennesse when I refused to endorse him, and now is only negative on anything Trump.

'''''Annie Get Your Gun''''' is a [[musical theater|musical]] with lyrics and music by [[Irving Berlin]] and a book by [[Dorothy Fields]] and her brother [[Herbert Fields]]. The story is a fictionalized version of the life of [[Annie Oakley]] (1860–1926), a [[sharpshooter]] who starred in [[Buffalo Bill#Buffalo Bill's Wild West|Buffalo Bill's Wild West]], and her romance with sharpshooter [[Frank E. Butler]] (1847–1926).&lt;ref&gt;A number of Internet sources claim that the musical is based on [[Walter Havighurst]]'s book ''Annie Oakley of the Wild West'', but the book was written in 1954, eight years after the musical was first produced.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1946 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production was a hit, and the musical had long runs in both New York (1,147 performances) and London, spawning revivals, [[Annie Get Your Gun (film)|a 1950 film version]] and television versions. Songs that became hits include "[[There's No Business Like Show Business]]", "[[Doin' What Comes Natur'lly]]", "[[You Can't Get a Man with a Gun]]", "[[They Say It's Wonderful]]", and "[[Anything You Can Do (song)|Anything You Can Do]]."

==History and background==
Dorothy Fields had the idea for a musical about Annie Oakley, to star her friend, [[Ethel Merman]]. Producer [[Mike Todd]] turned the project down, so Fields approached a new producing team, [[Richard Rodgers]] and [[Oscar Hammerstein II]]. After the success of their first musical collaboration, ''[[Oklahoma!]]'', Rodgers and Hammerstein had decided to become producers of both their own theatrical ventures and those by other authors.&lt;ref name=BV13&gt;Bloom and Vlastnik, p.13&lt;/ref&gt; They agreed to produce the musical and asked [[Jerome Kern]] to compose the music; Fields would write the lyrics, and she and her brother Herbert would write the book.&lt;ref name=BV13/&gt; Kern, who had been composing for movie musicals in Hollywood, returned to New York on November 2, 1945 to begin work on the score to ''Annie Get Your Gun'', but three days later, he collapsed on the street due to a cerebral hemorrhage.&lt;ref&gt;Nolan, pp.164-65&lt;/ref&gt; Kern was hospitalized, and he died on November 11, 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Kern, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; The producers and Fields then asked Irving Berlin to write the musical's score; Fields agreed to step down as lyricist, knowing that Berlin preferred to write both music and lyrics to his songs.&lt;ref name=KM223&gt;Kantor and Maslon, p.223&lt;/ref&gt; Berlin initially declined to write the score, worrying that he would be unable to write songs to fit specific scenes in "a situation show." &lt;ref name=KM223/&gt; Hammerstein persuaded him to study the script and try writing some songs based on it, and within days, Berlin returned with the songs "Doin' What Comes Naturally", "You Can't Get a Man With a Gun", and "There's No Business Like Show Business".&lt;ref name=Nolan166&gt;Nolan, p.166&lt;/ref&gt; Berlin's songs suited the story and Ethel Merman's abilities, and he readily composed the rest of the score to ''Annie Get Your Gun''.&lt;ref name=KM223/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nolan, pp.166-67&lt;/ref&gt; The show's eventual hit song, "There's No Business Like Show Business," was almost left out of the show because Berlin mistakenly got the impression that Richard Rodgers did not like it.&lt;ref&gt;''The World of Musical Comedy:The Story of the American Musical'' (1984), Stanley Green, pp. 79-80, Da Capo Press, {{ISBN|0-306-80207-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In imitation of the structure of ''Oklahoma!'' a secondary romance between two of the members of the Wild West Show was added to the musical during its development.&lt;ref name=BV14&gt;Bloom and Vlastnik, p.14&lt;/ref&gt;
According to some sources, the role of Annie was originally offered to Mary Martin who turned it down. Ill on opening night, she was represented by her husband, Richard Halliday. Upon his return home following the premiere, he informed her, "You're going to kill yourself!" When time came to send out the post-Broadway national tour and Merman was unwilling to do it, Martin jumped at the chance, going on the road for approximately two years and belting out the songs, which had the effect of lowering her voice from its normal lyric-coloratura range to mezzo-soprano-alto. 
For the 1999 revival, [[Peter Stone]] revised the libretto, eliminating what were considered insensitive references to American Indians, including the songs "Colonel Buffalo Bill" and "I'm An Indian Too".&lt;ref&gt;Brantley, Ben. "Everything the Traffic Will Allow". ''The New York Times'', March 4, 1999, p.E1&lt;/ref&gt; Stone said, "The big challenge is taking a book that was wonderfully crafted for its time and make it wonderfully crafted for our time... It was terribly insensitive...to Indians.... But it had to be dealt with in a way that was heartfelt and not obvious... In this case, it was with the permission of the heirs. They're terribly pleased with it."&lt;ref&gt;[[Simonson, Robert]].  [https://archive.is/20120908200332/http://www.playbill.com/celebritybuzz/article/65862-PLAYBILL-ON-LINES-BRIEF-ENCOUNTER-with-Peter-Stone "Playbill On-Line's Brief Encounter with Peter Stone"] Playbill.com, March 2, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Stone also altered the structure of the musical, beginning it with "There's No Business Like Show Business" and presenting the musical as a "show within a show".&lt;ref name=BV14/&gt;

==Plot summary==
[[Image:Miss-Annie-Oakley-peerless-wing-shot.jpg|thumb|right|1880s poster]]

===Act I===
When the traveling [[Bill Cody|Buffalo Bill's]] [[Wild West]] show visits [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] ("Colonel Buffalo Bill"§),  [[Frank E. Butler|Frank Butler]], the show's handsome, womanizing star ("I'm a Bad, Bad, Man"§), challenges anyone in town to a shooting match. Foster Wilson, a local hotel owner, doesn't appreciate the Wild West show taking over his hotel, so Frank gives him a side bet of one hundred dollars on the match. Annie Oakley enters and shoots a bird off Dolly Tate's hat, and then explains her simple backwoods ways to Wilson with the help of her siblings ("Doin' What Comes Natur'lly"). When Wilson learns she's a brilliant shot, he enters her in the shooting match against Frank Butler.

While waiting for the match to start, Annie meets Frank Butler and is instantly smitten with him, not knowing he will be her opponent. When she asks Frank if he likes her, Frank explains that the girl he wants will "wear satin... and smell of cologne" ("The Girl That I Marry"). The rough and naive Annie comically laments that "You Can't Get a Man with a Gun." At the shooting match, Annie finds out that Frank is the "big swollen-headed stiff" from the Wild West show. She wins the contest, and Buffalo Bill and Charlie Davenport, the show's manager, invite Annie to join the Wild West Show. Annie agrees because she loves Frank even though she has no idea what "show business" is. Frank, Charlie, and Buffalo Bill explain that "There's No Business Like Show Business."

Over the course of working together, Frank becomes enamored of the plain-spoken, honest, tomboyish Annie and, as they travel to [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]] on a train, he explains to her what "love" is ("They Say It's Wonderful"). Buffalo Bill and Charlie discover that their rival, [[Pawnee Bill]]'s Far East Show, will be playing in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]] while the Wild West show plays in nearby Minneapolis. They ask Annie to do a special shooting stunt on a motorcycle to draw Pawnee Bill's business away. Annie agrees because the trick will surprise Frank. She sings her siblings to sleep with the "Moonshine Lullaby."

As Annie and Frank prepare for the show, Frank plans to propose to Annie after the show and then ruefully admits that "My Defenses Are Down". When Annie performs her trick and becomes a star, Chief [[Sitting Bull]] adopts her into the [[Sioux]] tribe ("I'm An Indian Too"§). Hurt and angry, Frank walks out on Annie and the show, joining the competing Pawnee Bill's show.

===Act II===
Returning to [[New York City|New York]] from a tour of Europe with the Buffalo Bill show, Annie learns that the show has gone broke.  Sitting Bull, Charlie, and Buffalo Bill plot to merge Buffalo Bill's show with Pawnee Bill's as they believe that show is doing well financially. Annie, now well-dressed and more refined and worldly, still longs for Frank ("I Got Lost in His Arms").

At a grand reception for Buffalo Bill's troupe at the Hotel Brevoort, Pawnee Bill, Dolly, and Frank also plot a merger of the two companies, assuming Buffalo Bill's show made a fortune touring Europe. When they all meet, they soon discover both shows are broke. Annie, however, has received sharpshooting medals from all the rulers of Europe worth one hundred thousand dollars, and she decides to sell the medals to finance the merger, rejoicing in the simple things ("I Got the Sun in the Mornin'").  When Frank appears, he and Annie confess their love and decide to marry, although with comically different ideas: Frank wants "some little chapel," while Annie wants "A wedding in a big church with bridesmaids and flower girls/ A lot of ushers in tail coats/ Reporters and photographers" ("An Old-Fashioned Wedding"º). When Annie shows Frank her medals, Frank again has his pride hurt.  They call off the merger and the wedding, but challenge each other to one last shooting match to decide who is the best shot.

On the ferry to the [[Governors Island]] match site, Dolly attempts to ruin Annie's chances by tampering with her guns.  She is caught and stopped by Sitting Bull and Charlie.  However, they then decide to follow through with Dolly's plan so that Annie will lose the match, knowing that would soothe Frank's ego allowing the two to reconcile and the merger to take place.

As the match is ready to begin, Annie and Frank's egos come out again with each claiming they are better than the other ("Anything You Can Do"). Sitting Bull convinces Annie to deliberately lose the match to Frank, reminding her that she "can't get a man with a gun."  That done, Frank and Annie finally reconcile, deciding to marry and merge the shows.

===1999 Broadway revival===
In 1999, a new production had its pre-Broadway engagement at the [[Kennedy Center]], Washington, D.C., from December 29, 1998 to January 24, 1999. Previews began on  [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] on February 2, 1999 at the [[Marquis Theatre]], with an official opening on March 4, 1999, and closed on September 1, 2001 after 35 previews and 1,045 performances.

This revival starred [[Bernadette Peters]] as Annie and [[Tom Wopat]] as Frank, and [[Ron Holgate]] as Buffalo Bill, with direction by [[Graciela Daniele]], choreographey by [[Jeff Calhoun (director)|Jeff Calhoun]], and music arrangements by [[John McDaniel (musician)|John McDaniel]]. Peters won the 1999 [[Tony Award]] for Best Leading Actress in a Musical and the production won the Tony for Best Revival of a Musical.

This production had a revised book by [[Peter Stone]] and new orchestrations, and was structured as a "show-within-a-show", set as a Big Top travelling [[circus]]. "Frank Butler" is alone on stage and Buffalo Bill introduces the main characters, singing "There's No Business Like Show Business", which is reprised when "Annie" agrees to join the traveling Wild West show. The production dropped several songs (including "Colonel Buffalo Bill", "I'm A Bad, Bad Man", and "I'm an Indian Too"), but included "An Old-Fashioned Wedding". There were several major dance numbers added, including a ballroom scene.&lt;ref&gt;Sommer, Elyse and Davidson, Susan.[http://www.curtainup.com/anniegny.html "Review:Annie Get Your Gun"], Curtain Up, January 10, 1999 and March 9, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; A sub-plot which had been dropped from the 1966 revival, the romance between Winnie and Tommy, her part-Native-American boyfriend, was also included. In the 1946 production, Winnie was Dolly's daughter, but the 1966 &amp;1999 productions she is Dolly's younger sister. In this version, the final shooting match between Annie and Frank ends in a tie.&lt;ref&gt;Kissel, Howard.[http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/1999/02/28/1999-02-28__annie_s__high-caliber_star_.html "Annie’s’ High-Caliber Star Bernadette Peters Is Back On B’way To Get Her ‘Gun’ And Her Guy",] ''New York Daily News'', February 28, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Paper Mill Playhouse]] produced a well-reviewed production in June 1987 starring [[Judy Kaye]] as Annie and Richard White as Frank.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Alvin.[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/31/nyregion/theater-a-rip-roaring-annie-get-your-gun.html "Theater; A Rip-Roaring 'Annie Get Your Gun'" ] ''The New York Times'', May 31, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film and television versions==
In 1950, [[Metro Goldwyn Mayer]] made a well-received [[Annie Get Your Gun (film)|movie version of the musical]]. Although MGM purchased the rights to the film version with an announced intention of starring legendary singer-actress  [[Judy Garland]] as Annie, early work on the film was plagued with difficulties, some attributed to Garland's health. Garland was fired and replaced by the brassier, blonde [[Betty Hutton]].

In 1957, a production starring [[Mary Martin]] as Annie and [[John Raitt]] as Frank Butler was broadcast on [[NBC]]. In 1967, the Lincoln Center production described above, starring Ethel Merman and Bruce Yarnell, was broadcast on NBC. The Mary Martin version has been re-broadcast sporadically over the years, but the 1967 videotapes starring Ethel Merman have apparently been irretrievably lost. Only a video and audio clip of "[[I Got the Sun in the Mornin' (and the Moon at Night)]]" is known to exist,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhOTMf84gFo Ethel Merman in ''Annie Get Your Gun'' (1967)] on Youtube&lt;/ref&gt; as does an audio-only recording of the entire 90-minute show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.entertainmentoutpost.com/apps/webstore/products/show/7329339 ''Annie Get Your Gun'' (1967 TV production)] at entertainmentoutpost.com&lt;/ref&gt;

" 'Annie Get Your Gun' Review"] gramophone.net, December 1996, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The original Broadway production opened to favorable reviews. Critics unanimously praised Ethel Merman's performance as Annie Oakley, though some thought the score and book were not particularly distinguished. [[John Arthur Chapman|John Chapman]] of the ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' declared that the production had "good lyrics and tunes by Irving Berlin...[and] the razzle-dazzle atmosphere of a big-time show" but pronounced Merman the best part of the show, stating "She is a better comedienne than she ever was before", stating that "''Annie'' is a good, standard, lavish, big musical and I'm sure it will be a huge success--but it isn't the greatest show in the world".&lt;ref name=Suskin&gt;Suskin, 53-57&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louis Kronenberger]] of ''[[PM (newspaper)|PM]]'' stated that the show was 'in many ways routine", but greatly praised Merman's performance, opining, "For me, ''Annie'' is mainly Miss Merman's show, though the rest of it is competent enough of its kind...Irving Berlin's score is musically not exciting--of the real songs, only one or two are tuneful".&lt;ref name=Suskin/&gt;
[[Ward Morehouse]] of ''[[The New York Sun]]'' declared, "The big news about ''Annie Get Your Gun'' is that it reveals Ethel Merman in her best form since ''Anything Goes''...She shouts the Berlin music with good effect. She often comes to the aid of a sagging book".&lt;ref name=Suskin/&gt; He stated, "Irving Berlin's score is not a notable one, but his tunes are singable and pleasant and his lyrics are particularly good. The book? It's on the flimsy side, definitely. And rather witless too".&lt;ref name=Suskin/&gt; Lewis Nichols of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said, "It has a pleasant score by Irving Berlin...and it has Ethel Merman to roll her eyes and to shout down the rafters. The colors are pretty, the dancing is amiable and unaffected, and Broadway by this time is well used to a book which doesn't get anywhere in particular".&lt;ref name=Suskin/&gt;

However, the show itself was greatly lauded by some critics: Vernon Rice of the ''[[New York Post]]'' proclaimed, "Irving Berlin has outdone himself this time. No use trying to pick a hit tune, for all the tunes are hits...Ethel Merman is at her lusty, free and easy best...She is now able to develop a consistent characterization and stay with it to the show's end. And when she opens her mouth to sing, she sings!"&lt;ref name=Suskin/&gt; William Hawkins of the ''[[New York World-Telegram]]'' said that Merman was "bright as a whip, sure as her shooting, and generously the foremost lady clown of her time" and asserted that the show itself was comparable to those of Rodgers and Hammerstein, proclaiming, "For verve and buoyancy, unslackening, there has seldom if ever been a show like it...the girls in ''Annie'' have the beauty and character of looks one associates with a Rodgers and Hammerstein show. And the production has in every way the distinction that has become their hallmark".&lt;ref name=Suskin/&gt;

Historians have viewed the show as inaccurate, citing among other reasons its portrayal of Annie as a loud, boisterous character, when in reality she had a quiet personality and did needlepoint in her spare time.

== Redface ==

Native Americans have criticized the shows portrayal of Redface and promotion of cultural stereotypes. Particularly in the song "[[I'm an Indian Too]]" sung by Annie after Sitting Bull adopts her into the Sioux tribe.

Native Americans did protest outside the New York theatre, {{when|date=April 2015}} as well as movie theaters, holding picket signs stating: "Don't See "Annie Get Your Gun". As a result of this reaction, many contemporary productions have omitted the song from their revivals, and the protests stopped.&lt;ref&gt;Lahr, John (1 April 2002).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5818">The '''BPR Global GT Series''' (sometimes referred to as the '''BPR Global GT Endurance Series''' or simply abbreviated as '''BPR'''.) was a [[grand tourer]]-based [[sports car racing]] series which ran from 1994 to 1996 before becoming the [[FIA GT Championship]] in 1997.  The series was founded by [[Jürgen Barth]], [[Peter Auto|Patrick Peter]], and Stéphane Ratel (their last names forming the BPR name) as an international [[Endurance racing (motorsport)|endurance racing]] series to replace the [[World Sportscar Championship]] which had ended in 1992.

==History==
Following the demise of the World Sportscar Championship in 1992, there were no international sports car racing series in existence, only small national series or manufacturer cup races featuring nearly identical cars.  Patrick Peter and Stéphane Ratel of the [[Venturi Automobiles|Venturi]] series in France along with [[Jürgen Barth]] of the German [[Porsche]] series entered into discussions to combine their one-make series into an international championship that would bring back endurance racing to most of [[Europe]] as well as the rest of the world.

The series began in 1994 with an eight race schedule, including visits to [[Japan]] and [[China]], with races of approximately four hours in length.  Fields were initially made of a variety of [[Porsche]] and [[Venturi Automobiles|Venturi]] racing cars from various racing series broken into a wide variety of classes before later being joined by a modified [[Ferrari F40]], [[Lotus Esprit]]s, and [[Callaway Cars Incorporated|Callaway]] [[Chevrolet Corvette|Corvette]]s.

In 1995 the series would expand to twelve rounds and the amount of manufacturer interest was increased as new supercars such as the [[McLaren F1 GTR]], Ferrari F40 GTE, and [[Jaguar XJ220]] would appear, as well as lower class competitors like the [[Porsche 911 GT2]] and [[De Tomaso Pantera]].  By 1996, manufacturer involvement had driven out most of the smaller cup cars, leading to the series slimming down to a mere two classes.  

The manufacturer interest in the series reached a high point when Porsche launched their [[Porsche 911 GT1|911 GT1]], a [[homologation|homologated]] supercar that was intended first as a racing car.  Due to the amount manufacturer involvement, the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA) decided that the series would be best managed by themselves, leading to the series being reformed into the [[FIA GT Championship]], where it continues till 2009.  Stéphane Ratel would remain in charge of the series commercial rights.

Although the BPR series was technically dead, some of its organizers would move onto other series.  In France, Patrick Peter would create a new series in association with the French FFSA motorsport organization, known as the [[GT Tour|FFSA GT Championship]].  Cars would be less powerful than those seen in the other years of BPR, retaining the initial four class format, although this would be abandoned in later years.

Stéphane Ratel would create the [[Stéphane Ratel Organisation|SRO]] and help launch the [[GTR Euroseries]] in 1998 for privateer teams to avoid the large manufacturer involvement now seen in FIA GT.  The GTR Euroseries would also retain the four-hour race format that was no longer used by FIA GT.  Unfortunately this series would fail during its initial season.  SRO would go on to create various other national GT series.

In 2006, the SRO announced the launch of the GT90's Revival Series, a historic racing series intended to see classic cars from the BPR series return to the track.

==Regulations==
Unlike the World Sportscar Championship, which used custom built racing cars, the BPR series would use production sportscars which were modified into racing cars.  Manufacturers would be required to have built a certain amount of production cars for sale, with the amount of [[homologation]] vehicles set by the class in which the car wished to participate.  Initially four classes were used (GT1 through GT4) before being changed to two classes in 1996 (GT1 and GT2).  The upper classes allowed deeper modifications from the production vehicles, including the use of exotic materials and non-production parts.

Teams were required to have two drivers per car, with each driver being required to drive a minimum amount in order to score points.  Some teams could run three if they wished, although this was mostly used for amateur teams.

==Champions==
Although multiple classes raced in the early years of BPR, only a single overall championship was rewarded.

[[File:Brooklyn Thrill Killers with corpse of Willard Mellard.jpg|thumb|The boys, [[handcuff]]ed, alongside the corpse of Willard Mellard]]

The '''Brooklyn Thrill Killers''' were a gang of [[Jewish]] teenage boys who, in the summer of 1954, killed two men (one by drowning, the other by beating) and [[torture]]d several others in [[Brooklyn]], a [[borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="time_dec"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,857873,00.html “Thrill Killers”,] ''Time'', 27 December 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brooklyn Thrill Killers were:
* Robert Trachtenberg
* Jack Koslow
* Melvin Mittman
* Jerome Lieberman

According to a 1954 article in ''[[Time Magazine]]'', one of the boys [[turn state's evidence|turned State's evidence]] and another had the charges against him dismissed.  The other two boys, aged 17 and 18, were found guilty of [[felony murder]] during the act of kidnapping because one victim had been dragged several blocks before being thrown in the river.  This allowed the jury to suggest [[life in prison]] rather than send two youths to the [[electric chair]]. While ''Time'' didn't identify any of the boys, one of the two sentenced to life in prison was 18-year-old Jack Koslow, identified by [[Associated Press|AP]] reports at the time as the 'brains' of the group.

Dr. [[Fredric Wertham]] cited the Thrill Killers as an example of the potential harm caused by [[comic book]]s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;''[http://www.secret-identity.net Secret Identity] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180531234514/http://secret-identity.net/ |date=2018-05-31 }}'' by Craig Yoe, published April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, a comic book named ''[[Nights of Horror]]'' was brought as evidence of Jack Koslow's "sexual perversions", and used to convict him and Mittman of their crimes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Carlo Bossoli''' (6 December 1815, in [[Lugano]] &amp;ndash; 1 August 1884, in [[Turin]]) was a [[Swiss]]-born Italian [[painter]] and [[lithographer]], who spent his early career in Ukraine. He is best known for  historical scenes from the [[Risorgimento]].

== Biography ==
His father was a [[stonemason]] of Italian origin, working in Switzerland. In 1820, his family moved to accept work in [[Odessa]].&lt;ref name="B"&gt;[http://www.carlobossoli.info/ Brief biography] @ the Carlo Bossoni website (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1826, he studied with the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchins]]. After graduating, he worked in a shop that sold antiquarian books and prints. It was there that he began to draw and sketch. In 1828, he was hired by the [[Odessa Opera and Ballet Theater|Odessa Opera]] to work as an assistant to Rinaldo Nannini (?-?),&lt;ref name="B" /&gt; a stage designer who had studied at [[La Scala]] under [[Alessandro Sanquirico]]. He began to sell his paintings in 1833. His father died three years later and he found himself the sole support of his mother, his sister and her illegitimate son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Carlo Bossoli |url=https://www.artistiticinesi-ineuropa.ch/ita/bossoli-c-ita.html |website=Artistiticinesi-ineuropa.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} 
[[File:Re Vittorio Emanuele II, Cavour, i Ministri e la Corte scendono lo scalone di Palazzo Madama dopo l’inaugurazione della V Legislatura subalpina, 1853.jpg|thumb|left|225px|King [[Victor Emanuel II]] and [[Camillo Cavour]] at the opening of the "Senato Subalpino". (1853)]]
Luckily, his work drew the attention of Prince [[Mikhail Semyonovich Vorontsov|Mikhail Vorontsov]], who commissioned him to paint several views of Odessa. Princess Elizabeta was impressed with his abilities and arranged for him to study in Italy from 1839 to 1840.&lt;ref name="B" /&gt; He stayed mostly in Naples and Rome, giving special attention to [[tempera]] and [[gouache]] and associating with the many British artists who were living there. He returned in 1840 and settled in the coastal resort of [[Alupka]], on the Vorontsov estate.

In 1844, at the request of his mother (who was ill), he moved to Milan and opened a studio there.&lt;ref name="B" /&gt; In 1848, he produced popular scenes from "[[Five Days of Milan]]". His mother died the following year, but he remained there until 1853, when an unsuccessful uprising against the Austrians forced him to flee to Turin, which he used as his base of operations for travels to [[England]], [[France]], [[Spain]], [[Morocco]], [[Germany]] and [[Scandinavia]].

During those years, he produced an album of paintings, showing views of [[Crimea]], which was published in London by [[Vincent Brooks, Day &amp; Son|Day &amp; Son]]. It proved to be very popular due to public interest in the [[Crimean War]].&lt;ref name="B" /&gt; Later, in 1859, they commissioned him to produce a series of lithographs depicting the [[Second Italian War of Independence]] which were published as "The War in Italy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Stephen Ongpin Fine Art {{!}} Artists |url=https://www.stephenongpin.com/artist/236472/carlo-bossoli |website=Stephenongpin.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After seeing them, young [[Prince Oddone, Duke of Montferrat|Prince Oddone]] gave him a commission to follow the Piedmontese Army and make a record of its campaigns. The result was an album of 150 tempera paintings and the Prince declared him to be "the painter of our history". He fell ill with a fever at this time and his productivity declined dramatically. He divided his time between decorating his home to resemble the [[Vorontsov Palace (Alupka)|Vorontsov Palace]] and doting on his nephew.&lt;ref name="B" /&gt;

In 1883, at the age of sixty-eight, he married Adelaide De Carolis{{who|date=September 2015}}, who was only twenty-one; The marriage was generally believed to be a financial arrangement.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} The following year, he died of a heart attack. He was buried in [[Lugano]] and a street in Turin is named after him.

'''Carmentalia''' was the two [[Roman festivals|feast days]] (11 January and 15 January) of the [[List of Roman deities|Roman]] goddess [[Carmenta]].&lt;ref name="Roy2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christian Roy|title=Traditional Festivals: A Multicultural Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IKqOUfqt4cIC&amp;pg=PA46|date=1 January 2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-089-5|pages=46–}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had her temple atop the [[Capitoline Hill]]. Carmenta was invoked in it as ''[[Postvorta]]'' and ''[[Antevorta]]'', epithets which had reference to her power of looking back into the past and forward into the future. The festival was chiefly observed by women.&lt;ref name="Mower1907"&gt;{{cite book|author=Geneva Walker Mower|title=A Study of the Rites of Purification in Ovid's Fasti|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OzwsAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA12|year=1907|publisher=University of California|pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Cold Fish'''''|冷たい熱帯魚|'''''Tsumetai Nettaigyo'''''}} is a 2010 Japanese film directed by [[Sion Sono]]. ''Cold Fish'' premiered at the [[67th Venice International Film Festival]] on September 7, 2010, and received the best screenplay award in the Fantastic Features section at [[Fantastic Fest]] 2010. The film was released as part of the [[Bloody Disgusting|Bloody Disgusting Selects]] line.

==Premise==
The film concerns quiet and unambitious owner of a tropical fish shop whose life and family are taken over by a fellow fish entrepreneur who happens to be a serial killer. The film is loosely based on the exploits of two Tokyo serial killers, [[Sekine Gen and Hiroko Kazama]], a husband and wife duo who owned a pet shop and murdered at least four people.&lt;ref name="Twitch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://twitchfilm.com/interviews/2011/01/screenwriter-yoshiki-takahashi-talks-cold-fish.php|work=Twitch|title= Screenwriter Yoshiki Takahashi Talks COLD FISH|first=Todd|last=Brown|date=January 20, 2011|accessdate=August 25, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225052110/http://twitchfilm.com/interviews/2011/01/screenwriter-yoshiki-takahashi-talks-cold-fish.php|archivedate=February 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Asuka Kurosawa]] - Aiko Murata
* [[Megumi Kagurazaka]] - Taeko Syamoto
* Hikari Kajiwara - Mitsuko Syamoto

==Production==
Following ''[[Alien vs Ninja]]'' and ''[[Mutant Girls Squad]]'', ''Cold Fish'' is the third film to be released by [[Nikkatsu]]'s [[Sushi Typhoon]], their gore-themed series.&lt;ref name="fba-review" /&gt;
Director and writer [[Sion Sono]] was influenced by Japanese crime cases while developing ''Cold Fish'', specifically about an actual killing spree committed by a dog kennel owner in the 1980s (the story of the film involves a family of three that becomes entangled in a string of ongoing murders perpetrated by a tropical fish salesman in [[Shizuoka Prefecture]]).&lt;ref name="tokyorepoerter" /&gt; Sono also wanted to "depict a sense of total hopelessness" which he felt is "lacking in Japanese films."&lt;ref name="tokyorepoerter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tokyoreporter.com/2010/11/28/sion-sonos-cold-fish-nets-japan-premiere-at-tokyo-filmex/|work=The Tokyo Reporter|author=CJ|title=Sion Sono’s ‘Cold Fish’ nets Japan premiere at Tokyo Filmex|date=November 28, 2010|accessdate=July 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Film Business Asia gave ''Cold Fish'' an 8 out of 10 rating praising the actor Denden who without his "tour-de-force performance...''Cold Fish'' may never have worked."&lt;ref name="fba-review" /&gt; The review went on to state that "Though there's considerable gore on display, it's largely cartoonish. ''Cold Fish'' is not so much a blood-and-guts horror movie, more a danse macabre about social breakdown."&lt;ref name="fba-review" /&gt;

In the United Kingdom, ''[[Total Film]]'' gave the film a three out of five rating, suggesting that plot twists and black comedy offered welcome reprieve from the "largely hysterical acting and rivers of viscera."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.totalfilm.com/reviews/cinema/cold-fish?ns_campaign=reviews&amp;ns_mchannel=rss&amp;ns_source=totalfilm&amp;ns_linkname=0&amp;ns_fee=0 |work=[[Total Film]] |accessdate= July 11, 2011 |date=April 13, 2011 |title= Cold Fish |last= Harley |first=Kevin}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''[[The Guardian]]'' found the film to be "fairly ordinary" in comparison to Sono's other works and felt that the film was too long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/apr/10/cold-fish-review-shion-sono?INTCMP=SRCH |work= [[The Guardian]] |title= Cold Fish – review |last= French |first= Philip |accessdate= July 11, 2011 |date= April 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Radio Times]]'' gave the film three out of five stars, praising the acting from Denden, Fukikoshi and Kurosawa and Shinya Kimura's photography and Takashi Matsuzuka's production design which made up for "some overindulgent directorial moments".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.radiotimes.com/servlet_film/com.icl.beeb.rtfilms.client.simpleSearchServlet?searchTypeSelect=5&amp;frn=50703 |work= [[Radio Times]] |title= Cold Fish |accessdate= July 11, 2011 |author= Parkinson, David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Danesh''''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: دانش; [[Deutsche Morgenländische Gesellschaft|DMG]]: Daneš; [[English language|English]]: “knowledge“) has been the title of seven different Persian periodicals published since 1882. This digitized journal Danesh was a Persian women’s journal which was edited in Teheran. It was published weekly from 1910 until 1911 (1289-1290 A.P.) in 30 issues.&lt;ref&gt;Danesh, 1289–1290&lt;/ref&gt; The editor was the wife of Dr. Hosseyn Khan (Kahal)&lt;ref&gt;Edward Browne: The Press and Poetry of Modern Persia. Cambridge 1914.&lt;/ref&gt; and the daughter of Yaqub Jadid al-Eslam Hamadani.&lt;ref&gt;M. Mohit Tabatabai: Tārīḵ-etaḥlīlī-e maṭbūʿāt-e Īrān, Tehran 1987, p. 172f.&lt;/ref&gt; Her own name is not known. Moreover, ''Danesh'' was Iran’s first journal especially for women. Political topics were not part of the content but rather domestic issues in which the women were interested in at that time. In addition articles on topics like education and parenting were published as well as chapters of serialised novels. Two years after the disestablishment of Danesh another women's magazine, called [[Shokufeh (magazine)|Shokufeh]], was published in Teheran.

'''DarkMarket''' was an English-speaking internet [[computer crime|cybercrime]] forum created by Renukanth Subramaniam in London that was shut down in 2008 after [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent J. Keith Mularski infiltrated it using the alias Master Splyntr, leading to more than 60 arrests worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |work=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/jan/14/darkmarket-online-fraud-trial-wembley |title=Welcome to DarkMarket – global one-stop shop for cybercrime and banking fraud |first=Caroline |last=Davies |date=14 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subramaniam, who used the alias JiLsi, admitted conspiracy to defraud and was sentenced to nearly five years in prison in February 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |work=[[BBC News]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8539680.stm |title=Organiser of Darkmarket fraud website jailed |date=26 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The website allowed buyers and sellers of [[Identity theft|stolen identities]] and [[Carding (fraud)|credit card data]] to meet and conduct criminal enterprise in an entrepreneurial, [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/10/14/darkmarket_sting/ |title=DarkMarket carder forum revealed as FBI sting |date=14 October 2008 |first=John |last=Leyden |work=[[The Register]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had 2,500 users at its peak.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/stories/2008/october/darkmarket_102008 FBI Coordinates Global Effort to Nab ‘Dark Market’ Cyber Criminals]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to supervisory special agent Mularski of the FBI's Cyber Initiative &amp; Resource Fusion Unit, their undercover operation was "very successful in getting to the upper echelons of the Dark Market group and we were actually able to run the server and host all the communications that were going on there to make our cases."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |work=[[CNET]] News |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1009_3-10234872-83.html |title=Q&amp;A: FBI agent looks back on time posing as a cybercriminal |date=May 7, 2009 |first=Elinor |last=Mills}}&lt;/ref&gt; He obtained full access to everyone using the site and what they were doing by securing the server after gaining Subramaniam's confidence.

In Congressional testimony on November 17, 2009, FBI Deputy Assistant Director, Cyber Division Steven R. Chabinsky described the FBI operation:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/congress/congress09/chabinsky111709.htm Statement Before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Subcommittee on Terrorism and Homeland Security] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412172853/http://www.fbi.gov/congress/congress09/chabinsky111709.htm |date=2010-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{quote|The FBI's infiltration and dismantlement of Darkmarket, an online virtual transnational criminal organization. Working with our international partners in the United Kingdom, Germany, and Turkey, the FBI conducted a two-year [[undercover]] operation to penetrate the organization and bring it to its knees. At its peak, the Darkmarket forum had over 2,500 members—spanning countries throughout the world—who were involved in buying and selling stolen financial information, including credit card data, login credentials (user names, passwords), and equipment used to carry out certain financial crimes. Using undercover techniques, the FBI penetrated the highest levels of this group and identified and located its leading members. Multi-agency and multi-national coordination with our law enforcement partners led to over 60 arrests worldwide, as well as the prevention of $70 million in economic loss that otherwise would have occurred from compromised victim accounts.}}

In a speech to the GovSec/FOSE Conference on March 23, 2010, Chabinsky related explained&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/pressrel/speeches/chabinsky032310.htm Remarks as prepared for delivery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161227043937/https://www2.fbi.gov/pressrel/speeches/chabinsky032310.htm |date=2016-12-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|Not long ago, there was an online [[Credit card fraud#Carding|carding]] forum named Darkmarket. It had members worldwide who were involved in buying and selling stolen financial information, such as credit card data, login credentials, and equipment to carry out financial crimes. Darkmarket doesn't exist anymore. Why? Because the FBI infiltrated it and brought it down. Through a two-year undercover operation led by an individual known to most users only as "Master Splyntr," we penetrated the highest levels of this group and identified and located its leading members, which led to over 60 arrests worldwide and the prevention of tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars in economic loss. To the shock of criminals worldwide, Master Splyntr—who was on the site nearly everyday, participating anywhere from one hour to 15 hours a day—was a very dedicated and talented FBI special agent, of which we are proud and fortunate to have many. Still, it's a lot of work to take down a single forum, but it shows we can succeed if we have the right people in place and the resources to apply.

In other words, having hired and trained special agents who can talk the talk, and given the resources to spend enough hours online for an extended period of time, we have found that almost any cyber criminal enterprise will begin to trust us, despite having never met us face-to-face. We also learned that the communication methods used by these criminals are, to them, a social outlet as well. Just as often as they are speaking about [[malware]], crimes, and goods for sale, they are talking about their families, their girlfriends, their vacations, and their cars. After a time, members of these forums become friends. That is where the intrinsic trust stems from. When somebody first enters as a new member, they’re considered a potential cop; a month later, they’re less of a cop; six months later, they’re a friend; a year later, they are trusted implicitly—to the extent that when an outsider anonymously told a Darkmarket participant that Master Splyntr was actually the FBI (which, as you now know, was true) all Master Splyntr had to do was deny the accusation and he was believed because he was an insider, whereas the informer was an outsider.

The Darkmarket case also provides us with insight into cyber crime tradecraft. Cyber criminals deploy [[countermeasure (computer)|countermeasures]] that can cost them a lot of time and effort, in hopes of evading our lawful investigative techniques. Consider the fact that cyber criminals routinely change their nicknames, e-mails, [[electronic money|digital currency]] accounts, and the [[ICQ]] numbers they use in forums. Not only do they change these accounts and identifying numbers, but they also use different combinations of the information in each forum they participate in.}}

Another DarkMarket member, Thomas James Frederick Smith, pleaded guilty on June 10, 2010 to conspiracy to intentionally cause damage to a protected computer and to commit [[computer fraud]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dallas.fbi.gov/dojpressrel/pressrel10/dl061010.htm Another Pleads Guilty in Botnet Hacking]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dirty Water Club''' is a long-running (in a town where most tend to be short-lived) [[London]] [[club night]] featuring bands influenced by 1960s [[garage punk]].  It was named after [[The Standells]]' [[1966 in music|1966]] hit single "[[Dirty Water]]".

The club night started in October 1996 in the [[Tufnell Park]] neighbourhood of north London, at a venue called The Boston (The Standells' hit glorifies the U.S. city of [[Boston, Massachusetts]]). It hosted weekly live performances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article621024.ece Sunday Times, 5 November 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

Past performers have included [[The White Stripes]], [[The Fleshtones]], [[Billy Childish]] (of [[Thee Headcoats]], The Buff Medways, and The Musicians of the British Empire), The Woggles, [[The Von Bondies]], [[The Dirtbombs]], [[Thee Michelle Gun Elephant]], [[The 5.6.7.8's]], [[The Horrors]] and [[The Brian Jonestown Massacre]]. The club has also seen some original 1960s/70s performers, such as [[The Monks]], [[Kim Fowley]], [[GONN]], [[Radio Birdman]], [[The Rising Storm]], and [[Sky Saxon]] of [[The Seeds]], grace its stage.

The club night's influence is widespread, with venues in both Australia and Italy starting up club nights named "Dirty Water" and with the club's DJs being invited to perform at festivals all across Europe and in the USA.

The in-house record label, '''Dirty Water Records''', was launched in 2004 with the debut single by The Dirty, followed up by a 7" EP by Thee Exciters in 2005 then, after the re-release of the classic 1979 [[Lyres (band)|Lyres]] single ''How Do You Know?'' c/w ''Don't Give It Up Now'' in May 2007, a heavy release schedule was initiated that continues to this day.

The Dirty Water Club held its last night at The Boston venue on 19 June 2009, the final bill being original 1960s garage band [[GONN]], The Masonics and Speak and the Spells.  One of original partners no longer wished to continue and the remaining partner declined to continue under the "Dirty Water Club" name.  Occasional live music events continued to take place, however, under the auspices of Dirty Water Records and at a variety of venues.  

On Saturday 14 April 2012, The Dirty Water Club re-opened at The Hackney Trashbar in Stoke Newington running a monthly residency, with one of the bands with whom the club closed in 2009, The Masonics. The club night then ran monthly at the Shacklewell Arms in Dalston, with occasional gigs at the Rhythm Factory in Whitechapel. It is currently venue hopping, popping up at whichever location is suitable for dates that it books.

'''''Edward IV, Parts 1 and 2''''' is a two-part [[English literature#Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] history play centring on the personal life of king [[Edward IV of England]]. It was published without an author's name attached, but is often attributed to [[Thomas Heywood]], perhaps writing with collaborators.

==Publication history==
The two parts were entered into the [[Stationers' Register]] together on 28 August [[1599 in literature|1599]], and were published together later that year in a [[book size|quarto]] issued by the bookseller John Oxenbridge.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Heywood, ''The First and Second Parts of King Edward IV'', edited by Richard Rowland; The Revels Plays, Manchester, Manchester University Press, 2005; p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt;  The title page of the first edition states that the play was acted by "[[Lord_Strange's_Men#Derby.27s_Men|the Earl of Derby his servants]]". A [[second quarto]] was released in [[1600 in literature|1600]] by Oxenbridge and Humphrey Lownes. The play was popular, and was reprinted in 1605, 1613, 1619, and 1626. All of the early quartos were anonymous; Heywood was first connected with the plays by [[Francis Kirkman]] in his [[1661 in literature|1661]] play list.&lt;ref&gt;Rowland's Introduction to his edition, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The central character in the play is [[Jane Shore]], the king's mistress. The historical events of the reign of [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]] form a background, involving "the bastard Faulconbridge," the "Tanner of Tamworth," and other figures of the era. The play draws material from the 1587 edition of [[Raphael Holinshed|Holinshed]]'s ''Chronicles''.&lt;ref&gt;Rowland, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The play shows Edward wooing Jane, Jane struggling with the morality of accepting the king's offers, but using her influence to grant pardons to those wrongfully punished. In the end she expresses regret for her relationship with Edward. After Edward's death she is cast out by the new king Richard III. In this version of events, Jane is reconciled with her husband right before dying. They are buried together in a ditch which is named "Shores Ditch, as in the memory of them". This is supposed to be the origin of the name [[Shoreditch]].

==Author==
The play has often been attributed to Heywood; the normally cautious [[Walter Wilson Greg|W. W. Greg]] regarded it as "undoubtedly Heywood's" &amp;mdash; though the rarely cautious [[Frederick Gard Fleay|F. G. Fleay]] demurred. Some scholars have dated the play as early as 1594; others have favored a date toward the end of that decade. The records of theatre manager [[Philip Henslowe]] show that [[Henry Chettle]] and [[John Day (dramatist)|John Day]] were working on a play about Jane Shore in May 1603 for [[Worcester's Men]], the company with which Heywood was associated at the time. A play on Jane Shore was popular in the first decade of the 17th century, and is mentioned in ''[[The Knight of the Burning Pestle]]'' (1607) and ''Pimlico or Run Red-Cap'' (1609). In Part 1 of ''Edward IV'', Act III scene ii, is a three-part song about the [[Battle of Agincourt]] that strongly resembles [[Michael Drayton]]'s ''The Ballad of Agincourt'' &amp;mdash; and Drayton was a regular writer for Henslowe c. 1600 and frequently collaborated with Chettle and others. All of these facts and factors, taken together, suggest that ''Edward IV'' was composed by Heywood, perhaps with other Henslowe house dramatists, and perhaps revised over a span of years by various hands.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edmund Kerchever Chambers|E. K. Chambers]], ''The Elizabethan Stage'', 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; Vol. 4, pp. 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performances==
In [[1607 in literature|1607]], a company of English actors touring Austria were at the archducal court of [[Graz]]; on 19 November they performed, for Archduke [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] and his duchess [[Maria Anna of Bavaria (1574-1616)|Maria Anna of Bavaria]], a play called ''The King of England and the Goldsmith's Wife'' &amp;mdash; which might have been ''Edward IV''.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, Vol. 2, p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edward Simons Fulmer''' (16 April 1919 – 31 December 2017) was an officer and pilot of the [[United States Army Air Forces]]. At the time of his death Fulmer was one of the only four living knights of the very exclusive [[Military Order of William]], the highest [[Dutch honours system|honour]] of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]].

== Biography ==
Born on 16 April 1919 in [[East Syracuse, New York|East Syracuse]], Fulmer has been a lifelong resident of the area. 

During World War II second lieutenant Fulmer served as a pilot of the [[United States Army Air Forces]] with the 43d Troop Carrier Squadron, 315th Troop Carrier Group, 9th Air Force. 

On 18 September 1944, during the battles of the [[82nd Airborne Division]] in [[Operation Market Garden]], he was the second pilot on a [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain]], carrying an entire unit of British parachute troops and an amount of explosive substances, planned to descend with gliders to the area around [[Ede, Netherlands|Ede]]. Over [[’s-Hertogenbosch]] the airplane was heavily damaged by defensive fire from the [[Wehrmacht]], which caused the pilot to lose consciousness and produced a heavy fire on board. Taking over control of the aircraft, Fulmer made sure the troops and the rest of the crew could save themselves by parachute. In the meantime he suffered serious burns to the face, neck, back, and arms. Nonetheless, he managed to crash land the airplane in an heroic attempt to also save the life of the unconscious pilot. Upon landing, the plane burst into uncontrollable flames and Fulmer was able to escape through a side window. He was then taken care of by Dutch resistance fighters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |access-date=6 January 2018 |url=https://www.defensie.nl/actueel/nieuws/2018/01/03/ridder-militaire-willems-orde-fulmer-overleden |title=Knight MWO Fulmer passed away (Dutch text) |publisher=Netherlands Ministry of Defence |date=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[World War II | Second World War]], he was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]] in 1945. 

In 1946 Fulmer was [[Knighthood|knighted]] by [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands]], receiving the fourth class knighthood in the [[Military Order of William]] (RMWO). This order is the highest and oldest [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the Netherlands#Orders of chivalry|order of chivalry]] of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], bestowed for "performing excellent acts of bravery, leadership and loyalty in battle".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |access-date=6 January 2018 |url=http://lintjes.nl/onderscheidingen/de-militaire-willems-orde |title=The Military Order of William |publisher=Chancellery of the Orders of the Netherlands |date=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fulmer and his wife  of 73 years, Lucille White Fulmer had three children: Edward, Randy and Linda.

He passed away at the VA Hospital in [[Syracuse, New York]] on 31 December 2017 at the age of 98.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |access-date=6 January 2018 |url=http://obits.syracuse.com/obituaries/syracuse/obituary.aspx?n=edward-simons-fulmer&amp;pid=187704747&amp;fhid=22222 |title=Sir Edward Simons Fulmer Sr. Obituary |publisher=Syracuse Post Standard |date=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Airmen of the [[Royal Netherlands Air Force]] kept watch during a vigil and the commemoration ceremony was attended by [[Gijs Tuinman|Major Gijs Tuinman RMWO]], the [[Dutch Ambassador to the United States]] and the chairman of the Chancellery of the Orders of the Netherlands, Major-General (Ret) Henk Morsink. On this occasion, Morsink said:  "I had the honor to meet him three times in recent years, and I would like to repeat the words of [[George S. Patton|General Patton]]: ''We should not cry for the loss of this man, but we may thank God for the honor and privilege of this great man, Edward Simons Fulmer''. We will never forget Ed."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |access-date=6 January 2018 |url=https://www.defensie.nl/actueel/nieuws/2018/01/06/defensie-neemt-afscheid-van-ridder-mwo-fulmer |title=Ministry of Defence says farewell to Knight MWO (Dutch text) |publisher=Netherlands Ministry of Defence |date=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Falls in older adults''' are a significant cause of [[morbidity]] and [[mortality rate|mortality]] and are an important class of [[preventive healthcare|preventable injuries]]. The cause of [[falling (accident)|falling]] in [[old age]] is often multifactorial, and may require a multidisciplinary approach both to treat any injuries sustained and to prevent future falls.&lt;ref name="Sarofim"/&gt; Falls include dropping from a standing position, or from exposed positions such as those on [[ladder]]s or stepladders. The severity of injury is generally related to the height of the fall. The state of the ground surface onto which the victim falls is also important, harder surfaces causing more severe injury. Falls can be prevented by ensuring that carpets are tacked down, that objects like electric cords are not in one's path, that hearing and vision are optimized, dizziness is minimized, alcohol intake is moderated and that shoes have low heels or rubber soles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Chang|first1=Huan J.|date=2010-01-20|title=Falls and older adults|journal=JAMA|volume=303|issue=3|pages=288|doi=10.1001/jama.303.3.288|pmid=20085959|issn=0098-7484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review of [[clinical trial]] evidence by the [[European Food Safety Authority]] led to a recommendation that people over age 60 years should [[dietary supplement|supplement]] the diet with [[vitamin D]] to reduce the risk of falling and bone fractures.&lt;ref name="efsa"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Scientific Opinion on the substantiation of a health claim related to vitamin D and risk of falling pursuant to Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 |journal = EFSA Journal|volume = 9|issue = 9|authors=Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies |year=2011 |series=EFSA Journal 2011;9(9):2382 [18 pp.]. |doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2011.2382}}&lt;/ref&gt; Falls are an important aspect of [[Geriatrics|geriatric medicine]].

A 2006 review of literature identified the need for standardization of falls [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] due to the variation within research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Hauer K, Lamb SE, Jorstad EC, Todd C, Becker C |year=2006|title=Systematic review of definitions and methods of measuring falls in randomised controlled fall prevention trials|journal=Age and Ageing|volume=35|issue=1|pages=5–10|doi=10.1093/ageing/afi218|pmid=16364930}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prevention of Falls Network Europe (ProFane) taxonomy for the definition and reporting of falls aimed at mitigating this problem.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Lamb SE, Jørstad-Stein EC, Hauer K, Becker C |year=2005|title=Development of a Common Outcome Data Set for Fall Injury Prevention Trials: The Prevention of Falls Network Europe Consensus|journal=Journal of the American Geriatrics Society|volume=53|issue=9|pages=1618–1622|doi=10.1111/j.1532-5415.2005.53455.x|pmid=16137297}}&lt;/ref&gt; ProFane recommended that a ''fall''  be defined as "an unexpected event in which the participants come to rest on the ground, floor, or lower level."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The ProFane taxonomy is currently used as a framework to appraise falls-related research studies in Cochrane Systematic Reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Gillespie LD, Robertson MC, Gillespie WJ, Sherrington C, Gates S, Clemson LM, Lamb SE |year=2012|title=Interventions for preventing falls in older people living in the community|url=|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007146.pub3|pmid=22972103|pages=CD007146|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Hopewell S, Adedire O, Copsey BJ, Sherrington C, Clemson LM, Close JC, Lamb SE |year=2016|title=Multifactorial and multiple component interventions for preventing falls in older people living in the community (Protocol)|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD012221}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Sherrington C, Tiedemann A, Fairhall NJ, Hopewell S, Michaleff ZA, Howard K, Clemson L, Lamb SE|title=Exercise for preventing falls in older people living in the community (Protocol)|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD012424|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
*Trauma
**Soft tissue injuries. Bilateral orbital haematomas (two black eyes) suggests that the faller was probably not conscious as they fell, as they did not manage to protect their face as they hit the ground.
**[[Bone fracture|Fractures]] and [[Joint dislocation|dislocations]]. 5% of fallers end up having a fracture as a result of their fall, and 1% fracture their [[Hip fracture|neck of femur]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}.
**[[Disuse atrophy]] and muscle wasting from reduced physical activity during recovery periods
*Due to bed rest
**[[Pneumonia]]
**[[Pressure sores]]
**[[Dehydration]]
**[[Hypothermia]]
*A fear of falling&lt;ref name="NSF-UK"&gt;Department of Health, ''National service framework for older people; Standard 6&amp;#x20;– Falls'', Crown Copyright, 24 May 2001, [http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_4003066] accessed:19/5/2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Falls are often caused by a number of factors. The faller may live with many risk factors for falling and only have problems when another factor appears. As such, management is often tailored to treating the factor that caused the fall, rather than all of the risk factors a patient has for falling.
Risk factors may be grouped into intrinsic factors, such as existence of a specific ailment or disease. External or extrinsic factors includes the environment and the way in which it may encourage or deter accidental falls. Such factors as lighting and illumination, personal aid equipment and floor traction are all important in [[fall prevention]].&lt;ref name="NSF-UK"/&gt;

===Intrinsic factors===
*Balance and Gait
::As a result of [[stroke]] disease, [[Parkinsonism]], [[Arthritis|arthritic changes]], [[neuropathy]], [[neuromuscular disease]] or [[vestibular disease]].
*Visual and Motor Reaction Time Problems
::An extended [[reaction time]] will delay responses and compensations to standing or walking imbalances, thus increasing the likelihood of falls.
*Medications
**[[Polypharmacy]] is common in older people
**[[Sedatives]] significantly increase the risk of falling
**[[Cardiovascular]] medications can contribute towards falls
*Visual impairment
**[[Glaucoma]], [[macular degeneration]] and [[retinopathy]] increase the risk of falling{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}
**[[Bifocals]] and trifocals can increase the risk of falling as the lower portion of corrective lenses are optimized for distances approximately 18inches, thus precluding clear vision of one's feet/floor, approximately 4.5 to 5.5 feet below one's eyes.
*Cognitive problems
**[[Dementia]] increases the likelihood of falls
*Cardiovascular causes
**[[Orthostatic hypotension]]
**[[Postprandial|Postprandial hypotension]]
**[[Carotid sinus syndrome]]
**[[Neurocardiogenic syncope]]– the commonest cause of syncope in A&amp;E patients
**[[Cardiac arrhythmias]]
**Structural heart disease, such as [[valvular heart disease]]

===Extrinsic factors===

[[Image:BMF Geländer.jpg|right|thumb|A staircase with metal handrails]]
[[Image:Walker. frame.jpg|thumb|Front-wheeled walker.]]

*Poor lighting due to low [[luminance]] of existing lights or lamps, so preventing hazard identification and avoidance. Eyesight deteriorates with age, and extra lighting will be needed where seniors move frequently. The power of the bulbs used should be higher than normally accepted, with [[incandescent bulb]]s preferred especially as they react much more quickly than other types of bulb when switched on. This is vital when entering a room where an obstacle can trip the user for example, especially if not seen in time to prevent the accident.
*[[Stairs]] with inadequate [[handrail]]s, or too steep, encouraging trips and falls. The steps should be spaced widely with low risers, and surfaces should be slip-resistant. Softer surfaces can help limit impact injuries by cushioning loads.
*Doorways with adequate headroom so that the user's head does not hit the [[lintel]]. [[Door]]ways of low headroom (less than about 2 metres) are common in old houses and cottages for example.
*Rugs/floor surfaces with low [[friction]], causing poor [[traction (engineering)|traction]] and individual instability. All surfaces should have a high [[friction coefficient]] with shoe soles.
*Clothing/footwear poorly fitted, [[shoes]] of low friction against floor. Rubber soles with ribs normally have a high friction coefficient, so are preferred for most purposes. Clothing should fit the user well, without trailing parts (hems falling below the heel and loose shoe strings) which could snag with obstacles
*Lack of equipment/aids such as [[walking stick]]s or walking frames, such as [[Zimmer frame]]s so as to improve user stability. [[Grab bar]]s and [[hanging strap]]s should be supplied plentifully, especially in critical areas where users may be vulnerable.

==Diagnosis==
When assessing a person who has fallen, it is important to try to get an eyewitness account of the incident. As the faller may have had some loss of consciousness, they may not give an accurate description of the fall. However, in practice, these eyewitness accounts are often unavailable. It is also important to remember than 30% of cognitively intact older people are unable to remember a documented fall three months later.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}
Important points of inquiry:&lt;ref name="NSF-UK"/&gt;
*Visual motor [[reaction time]]
*Frequency of falls
*Effectiveness of "[[parachute]]" corrective response of moving hand and arm to "break" the fall
*Eyewitness account
*Associated features
*Risk factors for falling
*legal and illegal drug interactions
*Sedative and [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] consumption
*Assessment of proper, safe use of cane or walker assistive device

==Prevention==
{{main|Fall prevention}}
Fall prevention is accomplished first with a detailed assessment of the risk for falls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/steadi/pdf/STEADI-Algorithm-a.pdf|title=Resource: Algorithm for Fall Risk Screening, Assessment, and Intervention|last=|first=|date=2017|website=|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171231212220/https://www.cdc.gov/steadi/pdf/STEADI-Algorithm-a.pdf|archive-date=2017-12-31|dead-url=yes|access-date=31 December 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large body of evidence shows that an efforts that include exercise decrease the risk of falls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tricco|first1=AC|last2=Thomas|first2=SM|last3=Veroniki|first3=AA|last4=Hamid|first4=JS|last5=Cogo|first5=E|last6=Strifler|first6=L|last7=Khan|first7=PA|last8=Robson|first8=R|last9=Sibley|first9=KM|last10=MacDonald|first10=H|last11=Riva|first11=JJ|last12=Thavorn|first12=K|last13=Wilson|first13=C|last14=Holroyd-Leduc|first14=J|last15=Kerr|first15=GD|last16=Feldman|first16=F|last17=Majumdar|first17=SR|last18=Jaglal|first18=SB|last19=Hui|first19=W|last20=Straus|first20=SE|title=Comparisons of Interventions for Preventing Falls in Older Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.|journal=JAMA|date=7 November 2017|volume=318|issue=17|pages=1687–1699|doi=10.1001/jama.2017.15006|pmid=29114830|pmc=5818787}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USPSTF2018&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grossman|first1=David C.|last2=Curry|first2=Susan J.|last3=Owens|first3=Douglas K.|last4=Barry|first4=Michael J.|last5=Caughey|first5=Aaron B.|last6=Davidson|first6=Karina W.|last7=Doubeni|first7=Chyke A.|last8=Epling|first8=John W.|last9=Kemper|first9=Alex R.|last10=Krist|first10=Alex H.|last11=Kubik|first11=Martha|last12=Landefeld|first12=Seth|last13=Mangione|first13=Carol M.|last14=Pignone|first14=Michael|last15=Silverstein|first15=Michael|last16=Simon|first16=Melissa A.|last17=Tseng|first17=Chien-Wen|title=Interventions to Prevent Falls in Community-Dwelling Older Adults|journal=JAMA|date=24 April 2018|volume=319|issue=16|pages=1696–1704|doi=10.1001/jama.2018.3097|pmid=29710141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Possible interventions to prevent falls include:

*Provision of safety devices such as grab handles, high friction floors and footwear, as well as low power lighting at night 
*Regular exercise - lower limb strengthening exercise to increase muscle strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ishigaki|first=Erika Y.|last2=Ramos|first2=Lidiane G.|last3=Carvalho|first3=Elisa S.|last4=Lunardi|first4=Adriana C.|date=2016-11-08|title=Effectiveness of muscle strengthening and description of protocols for preventing falls in the elderly: a systematic review|journal=Brazilian Journal of Physical Therapy|volume=18|issue=2|pages=111–118|doi=10.1590/S1413-35552012005000148|issn=1809-9246|pmc=4183251|pmid=24760166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other forms of exercise, such as those involving gait, balance, co-ordination and functional tasks, may also help improve balance in older adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=22071817|year=2011|author1=Howe|first1=T.

*Treatment for [[osteoporosis]]

===Hospital===
People who are hospitalized are at risk for falling. A randomized trial showed that use of a tool kit reduced falls in hospitals. Nurses complete a valid fall risk assessment scale. From that, a software package develops customized fall prevention interventions to address patients' specific determinants of fall risk. The kit also has bed posters with brief text and an accompanying icon, patient education handouts, and plans of care, all communicating patient-specific alerts to key stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Fall prevention in acute care hospitals: A randomized trial|journal = JAMA|date = 2010-11-03|issn = 0098-7484|pmc = 3107709|pmid = 21045097|pages = 1912–1918|volume = 304|issue = 17|doi = 10.1001/jama.2010.1567 |vauthors=Dykes PC, Carroll DL, Hurley A, Lipsitz S, Benoit A, Chang F, Meltzer S, Tsurikova R, Zuyov L, Middleton B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Screening ===
American Geriatrics society (AGS)/British Geriatrics Society (BGS) recommend that all older adults should be screened for "falls in the past year".  Fall history is the strongest risk factor associated with subsequent falls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DK|first1=Kiely|title=Identifying nursing home residents at risk of falling|journal=Journal of the American Geriatrics Society|volume=46|issue=5|pages=551–555|date=1998|pmid=9588366}}&lt;/ref&gt; Older people who have experienced at least one fall in the last 6 months, or who believe that they may fall in the coming months, should be evaluated with the aim of reducing their risk of recurrent falls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rodríguez-Molinero|first1=Alejandro|title=A two-question tool to assess the risk of repeated falls in the elderly|journal=PLoS One|date=2017|volume=10|issue=12(5)|pages=e0176703|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0176703|pmid=28489888|pmc=5425174|bibcode=2017PLoSO..1276703R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many health institutions in USA have developed screening questionnaires. Enquiry includes difficulty with walking and balance, medication use to help with sleep/mood, loss of sensation in feet, vision problems, fear of falling, and use of assistive devices for walking.

Older adults who report falls should be asked about their circumstances and frequency to assess risks from gait and balance which may be compromised. A fall risk assessment is done by a clinician to include history, physical exam, functional capability, and environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clinical Practice Guideline: Prevention of Falls in Older Persons|publisher=The American Geriatrics Society |url=http://www.americangeriatrics.org/health_care_professionals/clinical_practice/clinical_guidelines_recommendations/prevention_of_falls_summary_of_recommendations|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==
The incidence of falls increases progressively with age. According to the existing scientific literature, approximately one-third of the elderly population experiences one or more falls each year, while 10% experience multiple falls annually. The risk is greater in people older than 80 years, in which the annual incidence of falls can reach 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tinetti|title=Risk Factors for Falls among Elderly Persons Living in the Community|journal=N Engl J Med|volume=319|date=1988|issue=26|pages=1701–7|pmid=3205267|doi=10.1056/NEJM198812293192604}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nevitt|title=Risk factors for recurrent nonsyncopal falls.

==History==
Researchers have tried to create a consensual definition of a fall since the 1980s. Tinneti et al. defined a ''fall'' as "an event which results in a person coming to rest unintentionally on the ground or other lower level, not as a result of a major intrinsic event (such as a stroke) or overwhelming hazard.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tinetti ME, Speechley M, Ginter SF | date = Dec 1988 | title = Risk factors for falls among elderly persons living in the community | url = | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 319 | issue = 26| pages = 1701–7 | pmid = 3205267 | doi=10.1056/NEJM198812293192604}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics ==
The health care impact and costs of falls in older adults is significantly rising all over the world. The cost of falls are categorized into 2 aspects: direct cost and indirect cost.

Direct costs are what patients and insurance companies pay for treating fall-related injuries. This includes fees for hospital and nursing home, doctors and other professional services, rehabilitation, community-based services, use of medical equipment, prescription drugs, changes made to home and insurance processing.

Indirect costs include the loss of productivity of family caregivers and long-term effects of fall-related injuries such as disability, dependence on others and reduced quality of life.

In the United States alone, the total cost of falling injuries for people 65 and older was $31 billion in 2015. The costs covered millions of hospital [[emergency room]] visits for non-fatal injuries and more than 800,000 hospitalizations. By 2030, the annual number of falling injuries is expected to be 74 million older adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Costs of Falls Among Older Adults|url=https://www.cdc.gov/HomeandRecreationalSafety/Falls/fallcost.html|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Home and Recreational Safety, U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services, Bethesda, MD|date=2016|accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Furthermore, a recent systematic review has demonstrated that performing dual-task tests (for example, combining a walking task with a counting task) may help in predicting which people are at an increased risk of a fall.&lt;ref name="Sarofim"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sarofim M | year = 2012 | title = Predicting falls in the elderly: do dual-task tests offer any added value?

The '''Festival de Cornouaille''' (or just '''Cornouaille Kemper''') is an annual festival taking place in the city of [[Quimper]], located in the south-west of [[Brittany]] ([[France]]) in July (close at the 4th Sunday of the month). The festival has been held since 1923 and is one of the biggest cultural events in Brittany.

The festival putting forward the [[Breton culture]] in its diversity and its richness. About 180 shows, concerts and animations take place in the day and in the evening in the urban heart of the city of Quimper: "a festival in the heart of a city and a culture".

== History ==

=== From 1923 ===
[[File:Reine de Cornouaille 2014 - Festival Cornouaille Kemper 2015.jpg|thumb|Reine de Cornouaille 2014]]
The festival was founded in 1923 as a sort of beauty contest ; The idea was to choose the most beautiful girl in the region and crowned queen of the festival . hair To the so-called Festival des Reines continued to dress the Breton bards Taldir, Jaffrenou and Botrel were present, as were the folk dancers Plozévet. After the pageant, accompanied by piano and violin, was a dinner for 300 guests, and the festival ended with a grand ball, where the gavotte was mixed with the Charleston. The festival continued in this form until 1947.

=== From 1945 ===
The festival was not held for a few years, through the Second World War, but after 1945 there was a need for . In 1947 the "Qeens Festival" was renamed ''Les grandes Fêtes de Cornouaille''. The first Fêtes was a four-hour folk festival, focusing on the Breton tradition .

In 1948 a 16 - year-old girl was elected festival queen, which had a lot of criticism from the Roman Catholic Church as a result. Since 1949, there is then no longer elected festival queen and the party has an emphatic folkloric character . It is the festival that year expanded from one day to one week . In the 50s, the festival has developed into the leading festival of Breton culture .

For 1992, the famous guitarist [[Dan Ar Braz]], who comes from Quimper, was asked to organize musical part of the festival : this resulted in the [[Héritage des Celtes]] project, in which 70 Celtic musicians worked together. The project was a success and resulted in a number of albums under the name "Heritage des Celtes" on.

'''Formula Future Fiat''' was an [[open wheel racing]] founded in 2010 by [[Felipe Massa]] and his family. It was based in [[Brazil]]. The champion received support to compete in [[Formula Abarth]].

The category was founded in 2010 by [[Felipe Massa]] and his family. The series was organized in collaboration with the Confederação Brasileira de Automobilismo (CBA), RM Racing Events and Carlinhos Romagnolli Promoções e Eventos.&lt;ref&gt;CATALDI, Alberto. [http://revistaautoesporte.globo.com/Revista/Autoesporte/0,,EMI91131-10142,00.html Fiat apresenta novas categorias de automobilismo] Auto Esporte&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Racing Festival Formula Futuro 2011.jpg|thumb|260px|Last race of 2011 Season.]]
The great attraction of this category was the low cost, thus enabling the continuation of drivers coming out of [[karting]] to develop their skills driving [[formula racing]]  cars for when they arrive overseas in a luggage grade experience in next-generation cars.

The category has a great concern of the organization in its development, making the most of the driver season, where every driver has his box prepared by the organization, transportation of cars, mechanics, engineers, fuel, tires, maintenance, everything included in package accession to the rank of the drivers.

==The car==

The car was designed to comply with the Signatech-[[Fiat]]. The [[Fiat Powertrain Technologies|FPT]] engine have 150&amp;nbsp;hp and a top speed of more than 200&amp;nbsp;km/h. The [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] has five forward speeds with [[Sequential manual transmission|sequential shift mechanism]]. [[Pirelli]] is the single tyre supplier for the championship.

== Regulation ==

Drivers have four free patrice sessions of 30-minutes and 20-minutes. On Saturday drivers have a qualifying session. The qualifying session decides the grid order for Saturday's race.

On Sunday race, the grid is decided by the Saturday result with top 8 being reversed, so the driver who finished 8th on Saturday will start from pole position and the winner will start from 8th place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://esporte.ig.com.br/grandepremio/outrascategorias/outras/2010/05/26/racing+festival+divulga+pontuacao+e+formato+do+grid+da+2+bateria+de+cada+prova+9495781.html Racing Festival divulga pontuação, além de formato do grid para 2ª prova] iG Esporte&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hilda Worthington Smith''' (June 19, 1888 – March 3, 1984) was an American labor educator, social worker, and poet. She is best known for her roles as first Director of the [[Bryn Mawr Summer School for Women Workers in Industry]]&lt;ref&gt;http://larson.library.emory.edu/marbl/DigProjects/swh/subjects/The%20Southern%20Summer%20School%20for%20Women%20Workers%20in%20Industry.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and as a co-founder of the Affiliated Schools for Workers (later known as the [[American Labor Education Service]]),&lt;ref name=ALES19271962&gt;{{cite book|last=Cohen Brody|first=Doris|title=American Labor Education Service, 1927-1962: an organization in workers' education|year=1973|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; though she also had a long career in government service supporting education for underserved groups including women, labor workers, and the elderly.

==Early life and education==

Worthington Smith was born in 1888 in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=NewDeal&gt;{{cite book|last=Kornbluh|first=Joyce L.|title=A New Deal for Workers' Education|year=1987|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Urbana and Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father's invention of a steamheating system, which heated many of the early office buildings of New York, provided the family with a handsome fortune.&lt;ref name=OpeningVistas&gt;{{cite book|last=Worthington Smith|first=Hilda|title=Opening Vistas in Workers' Education: An Autobiography of Hilda Worthington Smith|year=1978|publisher=Published by the author}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attended [[Bryn Mawr College]] between 1906 and 1910 for her undergraduate degree, during which she was elected to lead the student body as president of the Self Government Association.&lt;ref name=NewDeal /&gt; Worthington Smith remained at Bryn Mawr the following year and left in 1911 with a master's degree in ethics and psychology, after which she received a second graduate degree from the New York School of Philanthropy (which exists currently as the [[Columbia University School of Social Work]]). When she was twenty-five years old she returned to Bryn Mawr at the invitation of President of the College, [[M. Carey Thomas]], to oversee a residence hall as a Warden, and began to teach an informal class on social work at the request of a group of undergraduates in which she introduced the concepts of child welfare, family rehabilitation, delinquency, immigration, and housing. She returned to her studies at the School of Philanthropy in 1914 and soon established a community center for youth in New York City that served many boys of Irish, Italian, and African American descent, which she ran until [[M. Carey Thomas]] offered her the position of Acting Dean in 1919. In the two years that she served as Dean, her interest in workers' education&lt;ref&gt;[[The Story of Philosophy]]&lt;/ref&gt; was already becoming an area of active pursuit: in addition to her duties mentoring undergraduate students and administering college programs, Smith took the initiative to arrange night classes for the black college gardeners and service employees.&lt;ref name=NewDeal /&gt;&lt;ref name="ego2heart.org"&gt;http://www.ego2heart.org/heartsease/history.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Bryn Mawr Summer School for Women Workers in Industry ==

A pivotal moment in Worthington Smith's career came in 1921, when President Thomas asked her to head the [[Bryn Mawr Summer School for Women Workers in Industry]],&lt;ref&gt;Phamplet for the School http://larson.library.emory.edu/marbl/DigProjects/swh/images/Barker%20528/0528-086.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; a brand new initiative that Thomas envisioned and set into motion after visiting [[Workers' Educational Association]] programs in England.&lt;ref name=NewDeal /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Workers' Education Bureau of America]]&lt;/ref&gt; Though Thomas was the original visionary of the school, Worthington Smith is credited with developing it into the immensely successful program that it became and setting the example for a host of other similar programs that were founded in its image, including the Wisconsin Summer School, Barnard Summer School, Vineyard Shore School, Southern Summer School, and the coeducational Hudson Shore Labor School.&lt;ref name=Heller&gt;{{cite web|title=The Women of Summer: The Bryn Mawr Summer School for Women Workers, 1921-1938|url=http://www-distance.syr.edu/heller.html|publisher=Rita Heller, Syracuse University Kellogg Project|accessdate=2014-03-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030826144443/http://www-distance.syr.edu/heller.html|archivedate=2003-08-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Summer School was a residential program on the campus of Bryn Mawr College that operated for 8&amp;nbsp;weeks in the summer every year (except for 1935) between 1921 and 1938, hosting and educating female factory workers from all over the country who numbered approximately 1700 over the duration of the initiative.&lt;ref name=Heller /&gt; Money was raised for scholarships to support the students, who were between the ages of 18 and 35 and came from diverse backgrounds including different nationalities, races, religions, industries, non-unionized and union affiliations. About 100 women attended each year that the school operated, gathering to live, eat, and sleep together while they studied a variety of liberal arts subjects with distinguished faculty drawn from local institutions.

The object of the school, as stated in prospectus and distributed to a variety of news outlets, was "to offer young women of character and ability a fuller education and an opportunity to study liberal subjects in order that they might widen their influence in the industrial world, help in the coming social reconstruction and increase the happiness and usefulness of their own lives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Hagan|first=Anne|title=An Adventure in Education: the Summer School for Women Workers at Bryn Mawr|pages=9–10|newspaper=The Woman Citizen|location=The Woman's Citizen Corporation, New York|date=13 August 1921|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IohLAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA117&amp;lpg=PA117&amp;dq=bryn+mawr+the+opportunity+to+study+liberal+subjects+in+order+that+they+might+widen+their+influence+in+the+industrial+world+and+help+in+the+coming+social+reconstruction&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=j23wRjBg2h&amp;sig=kK4GLkqk86AbfZNbnf5uWVt87zo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xboUU-bqA-rT0wH9woCwBQ&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus was therefore on giving women the knowledge and tools to exercise agency in their lives, and to become leaders in their communities in a new era of social change.&lt;ref&gt;http://brynmawrcollections.org/greenfield/exhibits/show/the-summer-school-for-women-wo/introduction/hilda-worthington-smith&lt;/ref&gt;

Ms. Thomas had come into contact with the workers' education movement while traveling thru England and the Scandinavian countries after World War I. Determining that this country needed a version of this school she chose Dean Smith to start it. Ms. Smith directed the school for its first 13 years, first at Bryn Mawr, then later at West Park, N.Y., at her family home, HeartsEase.&lt;ref name="ego2heart.org"/&gt;

By 1927 there were a group of labor schools called the Affiliated Schools for Workers directed by Ms. Smith.&lt;ref&gt;Phamplet for School http://larson.library.emory.edu/marbl/DigProjects/swh/images/Barker%20528/0528-043.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This was the hotbed of reform where the future educators (including Eleanor G. Coit,  Ernestine Friedmann, Marie Algor, Amy Bruce, Alice Shoemaker and [[Louise Leonard McLaren]]) would emerge on the labor scene. Later the name was changed to the American Labor Education Service Inc., which last held a conference on April 28, 1962. labor education had gained a firm foothold in American education by then due to being championed by Ms Smith and her cadre of friends from her Bryn Mawr days in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~sch00224&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933 [[Harry Hopkins]], as adviser to FDR and head of the FERA, borrowed Ms. Smith to set up an educational program for the Administration, which in 1937 became the W.P.A.'s Workers Education Service.
As FDR's Educational Specialist, She created and ran multiple programs; one such program employed out-of-work teachers, whose graduates include [[Hubert H. Humphrey]], a future vice president under LBJ. Another set up the [[She-She-She Camps]] for unemployed women, ER's bid to place women in the program of [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] camps for men, and to provide education and housing for unemployed youth.

== The Visit ==
Eleanor Roosevelt's journal of August 2, 1939 notes her visit to her friend at the school for women she ran during the summer months. She arrived at the Hudson Labor School,&lt;ref name="ego2heart.org"/&gt; at tea time and joined the group of women in the shade of the trees. Hilda Smith&lt;ref name="fdrlibrary.marist.edu"&gt;http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/daybyday/resource/august-1939-4/&lt;/ref&gt; owned the property and used it as a summer school for women workers. Eleanor wrote; "The group was gathered in front of the house under the trees before I arrived and they asked me some interesting questions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~smlr/library/Digilib/keeper.htm&lt;/ref&gt; "What did I think they should try to get out of the seven weeks spent on the banks of the Hudson?" "How would one go about interesting people in a community in working conditions?", etc.

There were two English girls, a German refugee and a Swedish girl at the school that summer. While we were all having tea, I was amused to have one of the English girls say to me: "What a contrast between what you are able to do and what our Queen is free to do. I wonder if she would not give a great deal to have the same amount of freedom?"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/daybyday/event/august-1939-18/&lt;/ref&gt; 
She continued, "I am sure this school does a great deal to develop the mental abilities of the girls, but I think it is equally valuable because of the health which they acquire, for they do all their studying practically out of doors, eat on the balcony, and swim and play together."

ER knew the value of this, having championed the work Hilda Smith pioneered in convincing FDR to give up funds for the formation of the [[She-She-She Camps]] in 1933 when he as part of the New Deal created the CCC([[Civilian Conservation Corps]]). The camps fell victim to politics and sexism and were closed by 1937, where the twin crises of shelter (200,000 women were
homeless in 1933) and hunger plaguing the destitute eased as a result of the new deal programs of FDR.

== Later Career and Life ==

The workers' education movement gained momentum, with Worthington Smith playing an active and significant role. In addition to the schools&lt;ref name="fdrlibrary.marist.edu"/&gt; that she was directly involved in founding (such as the Hudson Shore Labor School, which was established on the site of her family home on the Hudson River),&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ego2heart.org"/&gt; she served on the advisory committees of many such initiatives.&lt;ref name=SchlesingerPapers&gt;{{cite web|title=Hilda Worthington Smith Papers|url=http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~sch00911|publisher=The Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe College|accessdate=2014-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also established and served as first Director of the Affiliated Schools for Workers (1927–1939), later known as the American Labor Education Service (1939–1962).&lt;ref name=SchlesingerPapers /&gt;

The later years of Worthington Smith's career were dominated by federal appointments, listed here:&lt;ref name=SchlesingerPapers /&gt;
*Specialist in Workers' Education for the [[Federal Emergency Relief Administration]], 1933–1943
*Director of the Workers' Service Program for the [[Works Progress Administration]] 1939–1943
*Consultant in Labor Education, 1943
*Federal Public Housing Authority as Chief of the Project Services Section 1943–1945
*Chairman of the National Committee for the Extension of Labor Education 1945–1951
*Member of the New York State Adult Education Bureau (1957 to 1959)
*Consultant for the Connecticut State Commission for Services to Elderly Persons from 1959 to 1961.
*Consultant for the Training Division of the [[Community Action Program]] of the [[Office of Economic Opportunity]], 1965

Worthington Smith retired at the age of 83 to focus on various writing projects related to her life experiences and career, including a narrative of her seven years with the Office of Economic Opportunity and a revised and expanded version of her autobiography, Opening Vistas in Workers' Education,&lt;ref name=OpeningVistas /&gt; which was self-published in 1978. In addition to these publications, Worthington Smith's poetry was published in songbooks, periodicals, and in three printed volumes: Castle of Dream (1910) and Poems (1964), both privately printed, and Selected Poems (1977). She died on March 3, 1984.&lt;ref name=SchlesingerPapers /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/14/obituaries/hilda-w-smith-95-educator.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life Philosophy==
To sum up Jane's life a story done in 1984 for the New York Times does come close to sewing 1919 to 1983 into a fine embroidery. The author noted that in 1937 the programs Smith initiated but couldn't in 1933 call by name became the W.P.A.'s '''Workers Education Service'''. When tasked by Harry Hopkins to be education specialist she already knew what she wanted.

'''Smith also wanted to teach "workers’ education", a term that had a strong communist association. She related years later, "I hardly dared mention it because it was so unpopular."

''Workers'education was ... "unusual because it involved three groups virtually ignored at the time: women, blue collar workers, and blacks.."''—Priscilla Van Tassel, New York Times, June 24, 1984, NJ5. (Caption for HWSmith picture) from the interview for the story in the NYTimes

'''"And what is workers' education? I think the first thing is to say what workers' education is and what it is not. I'd like to say, first, it is not vocational education. Many people think that that is what it is; it's not trade training for workers. That's entirely separate, should supplement workers' education and go along with it. But it is not the same thing. Workers' education is a specialized branch of adult education. It covers in general the economic and labor problems related to the experience of industrial workers, office workers, farmers, anything that touches the economic field. It is also and usually supplemented with much work in English, with elementary science, social psychology, with history, with a background of life in the United States. It touches: employers' problems, trade union problems, the worker in the community as citizen, the government's relation to industry and to the labor movement."'''

'''''Infierno en el Ring'' (2015)''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "Inferno in the Ring") was a major [[professional wrestling]] event that will be produced by the Mexican ''[[lucha libre]]'' promotion [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL) that took place on Friday December 25, 2015 in [[Arena México]], [[Mexico City, Mexico]]. The show replaced CMLL's regularly scheduled ''[[CMLL Super Viernes]]'' show as is tradition with most of CMLL's signature events. The 2015 event marked the seventh time CMLL has held a show under that name with previous shows in [[Infierno en el Ring (2008)|2008]], [[Infierno en el Ring (2009)|2009]], [[Infierno en el Ring (2010)|2010]], [[Infierno en el Ring (2012)|2012]], [[Infierno en el Ring (2013)|2013]] and [[Infierno en el Ring (2014)|2014]]. Each of the shows were main evented by a multi-man [[Professional wrestling match types#Cages|steel cage match]], contested under ''[[Lucha de Apuestas]]'', or bet match rules referred to as ''Infierno en el Ring''. According to the rules the loser of the match, the last person to remain in the cage, would be forced to have his hair shaved off per ''Lucha Libre'' traditions.

The main event of the show saw 12 men put their mask on the line in the cage, with [[Súper Comando]] ending up being unmasked as a result of his loss. The show was offered as an internet-[[Pay Per View]], but suffered major issues during the first three matches of the show. The show featured five matches in total, including the CMLL debut of [[Cibernético]] who worked for CMLL's main rival [[Lucha Libre AAA World Wide|AAA]] for over 20 years.

==Production==

===Background===
The Mexican [[wrestling promotion|wrestling company]] ''[[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]]'' (Spanish for "World Wrestling Council"; CMLL) has held a number of major shows over the years using the moniker ''Infierno en el Ring'' ("Inferno in the Ring"), all of which were main evented by a multi-man [[steel cage match]], the eponymous ''Infierno en el Ring'' match. CMLL has use the ''Infierno en el Ring'' match on other shows, but will intermittently hold a show billed specifically as ''Infierno en el Ring'', with the first such show held in 2008. It is not an annually recurring show, but instead held intermittently sometimes several years apart and not always in the same month of the year either. All ''Infierno en el Ring'' shows have been held in [[Arena México]] in [[Mexico City|Mexico City, Mexico]] which is CMLL's main venue, its "home".&lt;ref name=Mondo&gt;{{cite book|author=Madigan, Dan|title=Mondo Lucha A Go-Go: the bizarre &amp; honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling|publisher=HarperColins Publisher|year=2007|chapter=El nacimient de un sueño (the birth of a dream)|pages=41–50|isbn=978-0-06-085583-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally CMLL holds their major events on Friday Nights, which means the ''Infierno en el Ring'' shows replace their regularly scheduled ''[[CMLL Super Viernes|Super Viernes]]'' show.&lt;ref name=Mondo/&gt; For 2015 the show will be held on December 25, part of CMLL's Christmas celebrations.&lt;ref name=MedioAnnounced&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mediotiempo.com/mas-deportes/lucha-libre/noticias/2015/12/09/en-12-mascaras-del-cmll-en-juego-en-navidad | title=En 12 máscaras del CMLL en juego en Navidad | first=Apolo | last=Valdés | date=December 9, 2015 | accessdate= December 10, 2015 | work=MedioTiempo | publisher=[[MSN]] | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days after the press conference it was announced that the show would be available as an Internet [[Pay Per View]] both in and outside of Mexico, the second ever Internet PPV promoted by CMLL after the [[CMLL 82nd Anniversary Show]].&lt;ref name=PPV&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cmll.cleeng.com/infierno-en-el-ring-12-mascaras-en-jaula/E244629419_MX | title=Infierno en el Ring, 12 Mascaras en el Jaula | publisher=Cleeng | accessdate=December 10, 2015 | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Storylines===
[[File:Sin cara firmando autografos.jpg|thumb|left|[[Carístico]], the original Místico, teaming with the current [[Místico II|Místico]] on the show.]]
The event featured five [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]] with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing [[Screenplay|scripted]] feuds, [[plot (narrative)|plots]] and [[narrative thread|storylines]]. Wrestlers portrayed as either [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] (referred to as ''rudos'' in Mexico, those that portray the "bad guys") or [[Face (professional wrestling)|faces]] (''técnicos'' in Mexico, the "good guy" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

The road to the ''Infierno en el RIng'' cage match saw a number of different rivalries either initiate or intensify as the twelve men risking their masks built to the December 25 show. One of the focal points of the match was the storyline rivalry that had developed between the young ''tecnico'' [[The Panther (wrestler)|The Panther]] and the more experienced ''rudo'' [[Súper Comando]] during a match on [[CMLL Super Viernes|CMLL's ''Super Viernes'']] show where The Panther teamed up with [[Hombre Bala Jr.]] and [[Super Halcón Jr.]] to defeat Súper Comando, his brother [[Artillero]] (collectively known as ''[[Los Hombres del Camoflaje]]''; Spanish for "Men in Camouflage") and [[Sangre Azteca]] by disqualification due to excessive violence from the ''rudo'' team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mediotiempo.com/mas-deportes/lucha-libre/noticias/2015/10/17/shockercito-vencio-a-demus-316-y-lo-deja-pelon | title=Shockercito venció a Demus 3:16 y lo deja pelón | date=October 17, 2015 | accessdate=December 18, 2015 | work=MedioTiempo | publisher=[[MSN]] | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent weeks the two face off several times, with Súper Comando using illegal tactics to beat up the Panther and at time tear Panther's mask up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mediotiempo.com/mas-deportes/lucha-libre/noticias/2015/10/24/ingobernables-humillaron-al-depredador-del-aire | title=Ingobernables humillaron al Depredador del Aire | date=October 24, 2015 | accessdate=December 18, 2015 | work=MedioTiempo | publisher=[[MSN]] | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The storyline between the third generation of the Casas family, specifically [[Puma (luchador)|Puma]] and [[Tiger (wrestler)|Tiger]] and the second generation of the Panther family, [[Blue Panther Jr.]] and The Panther, played off the long running rivalry between [[Negro Casas]] (Uncle of Puma and Tiger) and [[Blue Panther]], the father of both Panthers. The rivalry between the two families had been going on for years, with the storyline returning to the forefront of CMLL programming in the fall of 2015, expanding the number of wrestlers feuding throughout the fall. In early December CMLL announced that Súper Comando, The Panther, Blue Panther Jr., Puma and TIger would joint 7 other wrestlers, [[Cancerbero]], [[Esfinge]], [[Fuego (wrestler)|Fuego]], [[Pegasso]], [[Raziel (wrestler)|Raziel]], [[Sangre Azteca]] and [[Tritón (wrestler)|Tritón]] in the main event of the 2015 ''Infierno en el Ring'' show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mediotiempo.com/mas-deportes/lucha-libre/noticias/2015/12/09/en-12-mascaras-del-cmll-en-juego-en-navidad | title=aras del CMLL en juego en Navidad | date=December 9, 2015 | accessdate=December 19, 2015 | first=Apolo | last=Valdés | work=MedioTiempo | publisher=[[MSN]] | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a press conference featuring all 12 competitors Puma made reference to Súper Comando being an "old man", something the 34-year old Súper Comando objected to, stating that he might have to teach Puma a lesson during the cage match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mediotiempo.com/mas-deportes/lucha-libre/noticias/2015/12/17/super-comando-tiene-en-la-mira-a-puma | title=Súper Comando tiene en la mira a Puma | date=December 17, 2015 | accessdate=December 18, 2015 | work=MedioTiempo | publisher=[[MSN]] | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The week before the cage match all twelve wrestlers faced off in a ''[[torneo cibernetico]]'' elimination match, which saw The Panther and Súper Comando face off several times and also saw Súper Comando and Puma clash despite being on the same team. Puma was partially responsible for Súper Comando being eliminated from the match. In the end Puma pinned Tritón to win the match.&lt;ref name=SVDec18&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mediotiempo.com/mas-deportes/lucha-libre/noticias/2015/12/19/caristico-volvio-y-super-parka-sorprendio | title=Caristico volvió y Súper Parka sorprendió | date=December 19, 2015 | accessdate=December 19, 2015 | work=MedioTiempo | language=Spanish | publisher=[[MSN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Event==
The event was supposed to be broadcast live on internet-Pay Per View but due to technical difficulties the first two matches were not shown at all and the third match was only partially transmitted. During the event CMLL stated on [[Twitter]] that the problem was not on their end but with the PPV provide Cleeng.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://twitter.com/CMLL_OFICIAL/status/680540229988515840 | title=Lamentamos las fallas técnicas que se han suscitado para el iPPV, las cuales son totalmente ajenas al CMLL | date=December 25, 2015  | accessdate=December 26, 2015 | author=[[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] | publisher=[[Twitter]] | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transmission was reestablished during the third match of the night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://twitter.com/CMLL_OFICIAL/status/680540428903436288 | title=La transmisión se ha restablecido a través de Cleeng| date=December 25, 2015  | accessdate=December 26, 2015 | author=[[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] | publisher=[[Twitter]] | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third match of the night, between the teams of [[Máximo Sexy]], [[Super Parka]] and [[Valiente (wrestler)|Valiente]] fighting against [[Negro Casas]], [[Kamaitachi (wrestler)|Kamaitachi]] and [[Bárbaro Cavernario|Cavernario]] ended in a disqualification when Kamaitachi landed an illegal low kick to Máximo Sexy's groin, causing the disqualification in the final fall. Following the match CMLL match makers came to the ring and signed two ''Luchas de Apuestas'' matches for the following week's ''[[Sin Piedad (2016)|Sin Piedad]]'' show, Kamaitacho against Máximo Sexy and Super Parka against Negro Casas.&lt;ref name=OficialInfierno2015/&gt;

'''Jivitputrika''' ({{lang-sa|'''जीवित्पुत्रिका'''}}) ({{lang-hi|जिउतिया , '''Jiutiya'''}}) ({{lang-ne|जितिया , '''Jitiya'''}}) is a festival in which ''Nirjala'' (without water) fasting is done throughout a day and night observed by mothers for the wellbeing of their children. A three-day-long festival is celebrated from the seventh to ninth lunar day of [[Paksha|Krishna-Paksha]] in [[Ashwin]] month of [[Bikram Sambat]]. It is celebrated mainly in the Nepalese states of [[Mithila, Nepal|Mithila]] and [[Tharuhat]], parts of Nepal's [[Province No. 1]], as well as the Indian states of [[Bihar]], [[Jharkhand]],[[WestBengal]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]]. Furthermore, it is widely observed by the [[Tharu people|Eastern Tharu]] and [[Madhesi people|Far-Eastern Madhesi]] peoples. In 2016, it was observed on 7th Ashwin of Hindu Bikram Sambat calendar falling on September 23 of Gregorian Calendar.&lt;ref name="indastro1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianastrology.co.in/4117-jivitputrika-vrat-2016-jitiya-2016-date-hindu-panchang/|title=Jivitputrika Vrat 2016 (Jitiya 2016) Date &amp; Hindu Panchang - Indian Astrology|date=July 18, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=September 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
A three-day long festival is celebrated from the seventh to the ninth lunar day of Krishna Paksha in [[Ashwin]] month of [[Bikram Sambat|Hindu Bikram Sambat]] that falls generally in September. The first day, the day before Jivitputrika is known as Nahai-khai. On that day, mothers take food only after having their bath. On Jivitputrika day, a strict fast, called ''Khur Jitiya'', is observed without water. On the third day, the fast ends with Paaran, taking the first food of the day. In [[Mithila, Nepal|Mithila]] , [[Tharuhat]], the region of northeastern Bihar, and eastern Nepal, a variety of food and a special festival delicacy ''Jhor Bhaat'' (curry and white rice), ''Noni ka saag'' and Madua ki [[Roti]] are prepared. In the [[Bhojpuri region]] of western Bihar, eastern Uttar Pradesh, and Nepal, Paaran is done with Noni ka saag [[Portulaca oleracea|(summer purslane)]], Maruwa ki roti, and a vegetable stew of zucchini. The festival is celebrated mainly in the Bhojpuri and Maithili speaking regions of [[Nepal]] and [[Bihar]], Jharkhand and Eastern [[Uttar Pradesh]] of [[India]].

==Legends==
===Jivitputrika Vrat Story===
It is believed that once, an eagle and a female fox lived in a [[Himalaya|Himalayan]] jungle near Narmada river were friends. Both of them saw some ladies performing the pooja and fasting, and wished to observe it themselves too. During their fast, the fox became unconscious because of hunger and secretly had food. On the other hand, the eagle observed the fast with full dedication and completed it. As a result, all children born to the fox perished a few days after birth and the eagle's offspring were blessed with long life.

===Jimutavahana===
According to this story Jimutavahana was the wise and king of the [[Gandharva]]. Jimutvanhan was not satisfied with ruling and as a result he gave all the responsibilities of his kingdom to his brothers and went to the jungle to serve his father. One day while wandering in the jungle, he finds an old woman mourning. He asked the old woman the reason of weeping, upon which she told him that she belonged to a family of snakes (Nagvanshaki) and had only one son. As an oath, every day, one snake is offered to Pakshiraj [[Garuda]] as a feed and that day was her son's chance to become his food. After listening to her problem, Jimutavahana consoled her and promised that he would get back her son alive and would protect him from Garuda. He decides to lay down himself on the bed of rocks being presented to the Garuda for the feed. Garuda comes and holds the Jimutvahana covered with red cloth with his fingers and climbs the rock. Garuda finds it surprising when the person he has trapped does not response. He asks Jimutvahana his identity on which he describes the entire scene to the Garuda. Garuda, pleased with the bravery and the benevolence of Jimutvahana, departs and promises not to take any further sacrifices from the snakes. Due to the bravery and generosity of Jimutvahana, the race of the snakes was saved and since then, the fasts for the children's welfare and long life are observed.

Goldberg first received law-enforcement and media attention under his [[Twitter]] handle "Australi Witness" following the [[Curtis Culwell Center attack]], a terrorist attack on a [[Garland, Texas]] exhibit featuring [[images of Muhammad]] in May 2015, in which two assailants died in a shootout with police.&lt;ref name="plea"/&gt; The "Australi Witness" persona, had, posing as a [[Perth, Australia|Perth]] jihadist, called for an attack on, and posted maps of, the center where the exhibit was taking place, praised the jihadist attackers in its aftermath, and was [[retweet]]ed by one of the assailants before the attack.&lt;ref name="smhInterview"/&gt; He also claimed credit for the attack.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="melHowToProsecute"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newsComAuGuiltyPleaIncitement"/&gt;

===Islamist-related personas===

====Australi Witness====
Australi Witness was an online persona, claiming to be an ISIS-affiliated jihadist from [[Australia]],&lt;ref name="DailyMail911MemorialSaved"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3230376/Florida-man-posed-Australian-jihadist-online-arrested-FBI-advising-people-make-bombs-calling-series-terror-attacks.html|title=Florida Man, 20, Arrested for 'plotting a Boston Marathon-style attack on a Kansas City 9/11 memorial'|work=[[Daily Mail]]|author=Daniel Piotrowski, Lucy Thackray and Ashley Collman|date=September 11, 2015|accessdate=July 19, 2016|archive-url=https://archive.today/20160719235433/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3230376/Florida-man-posed-Australian-jihadist-online-arrested-FBI-advising-people-make-bombs-calling-series-terror-attacks.html|dead-url=no|archive-date=July 19, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was described by [[Rita Katz]], executive director of [[SITE Intelligence Group]], as holding a "prestigious position" in online jihadi circles.&lt;ref name="smhInterview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/online-jihadist-hails-power-of-social-media-after-texas-attack-20150505-gguuba.html|title=Online jihadist hails power of social media after Texas attack|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|author=David Wroe and Nick O'Malley|date=May 6, 2015|accessdate=September 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australi Witness urged an attack on the anti-Islamic event being held at the [[Curtis Culwell Center]] in [[Garland, Texas]], on May 3, 2015, suggesting that "brothers in Texas" to go there "with your weapons, bombs or with knifes {{sic}}" to "defend your Prophet".&lt;ref name="smhJihadistTroll"/&gt; The persona also posted maps to the event. Subsequently, two men, identified as [[Phoenix, Arizona]] residents Elton Simpson and Nadir Soofi, were [[Curtis Culwell Center attack|shot dead by police as they attempted to attack the contest]]. The FBI found that Simpson retweeted a message from the Australi Witness Twitter handle on the morning of the attack.&lt;ref name="dailytelegraph"/&gt;&lt;ref name="haaretz"/&gt; Australi Witness claimed credit for having inspired the attack to multiple media outlets,&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="melHowToProsecute"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://features.wearemel.com/how-to-prosecute-an-internet-troll-827e29c621c5|title=How to prosecute an internet troll|work=Mel|author=Jay Hathaway|date=February 27, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414183040/https://features.wearemel.com/how-to-prosecute-an-internet-troll-827e29c621c5|archivedate=April 14, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; praised Simpson and Soofi as [[Istishhad|martyrs]],&lt;ref name=theAgeFBIAustraliWitness/&gt; and expressed support for the attack in an interview with [[Fairfax Media]].&lt;ref name="smhInterview"/&gt;

Australi Witness  posted a 50-page guide online on how to join the terror group ISIS,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/breaking-news/australian-posts-guide-for-joining-isis/story-e6frfku9-1227336632032|title=Australian posts guide for joining ISIS|date=May 5, 2015|work=NewsComAu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later posted a list of [[synagogue]]s in Australia, ostensibly to encourage his supporters to attack them.&lt;ref name="australianTimesIsisTweets"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australiantimes.co.uk/australian-isis-supporter-tweets-tips-and-threats-following-garland-texas-shootings/|title=Australian ISIS supporter tweets tips and threats following Garland Texas shootings|work=Australian Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; He communicated that he was planning an attack in [[Melbourne]] to an FBI informant, who posed as a jihadist,&lt;ref name="guardian1"&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/12/us-man-tried-to-organise-terror-attack-in-melbourne-say-authorities|title = US man tried to organise terror attack in Melbourne, say authorities|last = |first = |date = |work = |access-date = |via = |publisher = The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 17-year-old who pleaded guilty to planning a Mother’s Day 2015 bombing in Melbourne using pressure cooker and pipe bombs, which was never carried out, was found to have been in contact with Goldberg.&lt;ref name="heraldSunTeenager"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Padraic|first1=Murphy|title=Teenager pleads guilty to planning Mother’s Day terrorist attack in Melbourne|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/law-order/teenager-pleads-guilty-to-planning-mothers-day-terrorist-attack-in-melbourne/news-story/2ffaf966f87e4c5c62a98d282bbe4b0f|accessdate=14 December 2015|work=Herald Sun|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20151220091924/http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/law-order/teenager-pleads-guilty-to-planning-mothers-day-terrorist-attack-in-melbourne/news-story/2ffaf966f87e4c5c62a98d282bbe4b0f|dead-url=no|archivedate=December 20, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the FBI, Australi Witness posted to an ISIS-related website that he had recruited two people, one in [[Los Angeles]], the other in Melbourne, to "using guns, shoot up local synagogues when the maximum amount of Jews are praying", stating that "the entire thing was my idea, and I helped them every step of the way".&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt;

Australi Witness also claimed to have worked for [[Amnesty International]],&lt;ref name="independentJewishIsis"/&gt; asked followers to target Australian cartoonist [[Larry Pickering]], and repeatedly attempted to associate himself with anti-[[Islamphobia]] campaigner [[Mariam Veiszadeh]].&lt;ref name="smh.com.au"/&gt;

====Junaid Thorne and fake jihadist personas====
Goldberg reportedly set up a fake account in the name of Australian [[Muslim]] preacher [[Mohammed Junaid Thorne|Junaid Thorne]]. Goldberg also created a number of fake jihadist accounts, which interacted with the fake Thorne account, and he then sent [[screengrabs]] of the fabricated interactions to journalists, at least one of whom published the fake interaction in an article of ''[[The West Australian]]'' in April 2015.&lt;ref name="thorneHoaxWa2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thewest.com.au/news/crime/hoax-fools-wannabe-jihadis-ng-ya-206288|title=Hoax fools wannabe jihadis|work=The West Australian|accessdate=January 25, 2018|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20180126044237/https://thewest.com.au/news/crime/hoax-fools-wannabe-jihadis-ng-ya-206288|deadurl=no|archivedate=January 26, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smh.com.au"/&gt;

The fake jihadist personas were also used to besmirch [[Amnesty International]] and the Human Rights Law Centre by claiming that the fake jihadists had employment ties, or donated money to, these organizations.&lt;ref name="smh.com.au"/&gt;

This persona was linked to Goldberg on [[Facebook]].&lt;ref name="smh.com.au"/&gt;

===Feminism-related personas===

====Caitlin Roper====
Goldberg reportedly set up a fake Twitter account in the name of anti-[[sexual exploitation]] campaigner Caitlin Roper, who allegedly earned his ire because of her efforts to get the video game ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' banned in Australia. The fake account sent [[Promoted Tweets]] that targeted the [[transgender]] community.&lt;ref name="smh.com.au"/&gt;

====Tanya Cohen====
Under this persona, Goldberg posed as a female [[political left|left-wing]] Australian activist opposed to [[free speech]].
Goldberg’s work under the persona was published in many places, including Thought Catalog, a [[Daily Kos]] diary; and [[Feministing]], a [[feminist blog]].&lt;ref name="thedailybeast.com"/&gt;
''[[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]]'' columnist [[James Taranto]] apologized for believing a hoax allegedly perpetrated by Goldberg under the name "Tanya Cohen" earlier in 2015.&lt;ref name="wsjFreedomToHate"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/freedom-to-hate-1421439597|title=Freedom to Hate|author=James Taranto|date=January 16, 2015|work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[National Review]]''{{'}}s Charles Cooke described the article that Taranto responded to as "exquisite satire",&lt;ref name ="wsjGoldbergVariations"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-goldberg-variations-1442251638|title=The Goldberg Variations|author=James Taranto|date=September 14, 2015|work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Mike Masnick]] of [[Techdirt]] called it "...damn good satire, because it's just stupid enough at the beginning to drag you in and make you believe it, and then, slowly but surely, over the course of a very long writeup, it starts tossing out ever more ridiculous ideas -- drip... drip... drip -- that just, gently, turn up the outrage-o-meter, such that many people don't even realize that it's satire."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150106/17571729615/best-satire-about-attack-free-speech-that-you-could-ever-read.shtml | title=That Crazy Story About Making 'Hate Speech' A Crime?

This persona was linked to Goldberg on [[Facebook]].&lt;ref name="smh.com.au"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===White supremacist personas===

====European88 and Reddit====
On [[Reddit]], Goldberg made thousands of racist posts under the neo-Nazi persona "European[[88_(number)#In_white_nationalism|88]]." Under this persona, Goldberg created and moderated many [[controversial Reddit communities]] that were racist in nature, including being a moderator for the "[[Controversial Reddit communities#The .22Chimpire.22|r/CoonTown]]" subreddit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hard Right, Easy Mark|url=http://takimag.com/article/hard_right_easy_mark_david_cole/print#axzz49OgyUXGr|website=Taki's Mag|accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The subreddit's creator, who went by "[[eugenics|EugeneNix]]", a co-troll of Goldberg, has briefly spoken to ''[[Taki's Magazine]]'' about Goldberg and his impressions of him, before and after "EugeneNix" learned about his former cohort's ISIL-related endeavors after the latter was arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hard Right, Easy Mark|url=http://takimag.com/article/hard_right_easy_mark_david_cole/print#axzz49OgyUXGr|website=Taki's Mag|accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many subreddits he created or moderated, including "r/CoonTown", were banned during a period when Reddit's content policy was revised in August 2015.&lt;ref name="bansns"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmawoollacott/2015/06/11/users-flock-to-voat-as-reddit-shuts-harassing-groups/|title=Users Flock To Voat As Reddit Shuts Harassing Groups}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Huffman|first1=Steve|title=Content Policy Update|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs|website=Reddit.com|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===="Michael Slay"====
Goldberg posted on the neo-Nazi website ''[[The Daily Stormer]]'' as "Michael Slay". 

One well-known article by this persona regarding how to recruit people from Reddit (particularly the "r/conspiracy" and "r/Europe" subreddits), described as "fertile ground for recruitment" was commented on by Sam Biddle in a Gawker article.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://gawker.com/reddit-is-so-racist-white-supremacists-are-using-it-to-1691162974 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816075740/http://gawker.com/reddit-is-so-racist-white-supremacists-are-using-it-to-1691162974 |archivedate=August 16, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his arrest and unveiling, the administrator of the site removed his posts.&lt;ref name="thedailybeast.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/09/11/terrorist-troll-pretended-to-be-isis-white-supremacist-and-jewish-lawyer.html|title='Terrorist' Troll Pretended to Be ISIS, White Supremacist, and Jewish Lawyer|work=[[The Daily Beast]]|author=Katie Zavadski|date=September 11, 2015|accessdate=September 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="everyFight"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/joshua-goldberg-the-fake-aussie-jihadist-had-a-hand-in-every-online-fight-20150913-gjlc30.html|title=Joshua Goldberg, the fake Aussie jihadist, had a hand in every online fight|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=September 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He used this persona to criticize [[Mariam Veiszadeh]], writing more than one ''Daily Stormer'' article about her.

===Other personas===

====''Times of Israel'' blog hoax====
In April 2015, an item was posted on a ''[[The Times of Israel|Times of Israel]]'' blog calling for the [[genocide|extermination]] of the [[Palestinian people]]. The article was ostensibly written by Josh Bornstein, a Jewish Australian lawyer, and triggered widespread condemnation. Bornstein immediately disavowed responsibility for the post, which was deleted by ''The Times of Israel''.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; It has since been accepted that Bornstein was the victim of a hoax.&lt;ref name=guardianBornstein1/&gt;

Initially, it was believed that the hoax was perpetrated by [[white supremacists]].&lt;ref name=guardianBornstein1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/05/identity-stolen-white-supremacists-times-of-israel|title=White supremacists stole my identity to spew hatred on the Times of Israel|author=Josh Bornstein|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2015, Bornstein faced online threats from Goldberg's Australi Witness Twitter account,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afr.com/news/how-lawyer-josh-bornsteins-stolen-identity-was-used-to-spread-race-hate-20150506-ggv46p|title=How lawyer Josh Bornstein's stolen identity was used to spread race hate|work=Financial Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was later learned that the hoax post was initially perpetrated by Goldberg.&lt;ref name="smh.com.au"/&gt;

====Philosophy of Rape====
Goldberg has been identified as the person behind "Philosophy of Rape", a [[subreddit]] that advocated [[corrective rape]] against "whores and feminazis", and offered tips on how to do so without getting caught.&lt;ref name="rape"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/joshua-goldberg-the-fake-aussie-jihadist-had-a-hand-in-every-online-fight-20150913-gjlc30.html|title=Joshua Goldberg, the fake Aussie jihadist, had a hand in every online fight}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rape2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themarysue.com/gross-subreddit-advocates-rape/|title=Gross Subreddit Promises to Teach How to "Rape Safely" as "Corrective Discipline" for Women}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MoonMetropolis===
Goldberg was also active on Twitter, Reddit, [[Disqus]] and others under the username MoonMetropolis,&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; a "free speech absolutist" who was involved with the [[Gamergate controversy]]. He would frequently use this persona to criticize the works of his other personas such as anti-free speech activist Tanya Cohen, arguing against points that he himself had made.&lt;ref name="everyFight"/&gt;

Goldberg also posted strong opinions on the subject of free speech absolutism to the website Thought Catalog, using both the MoonMetropolis name and his own name.&lt;ref name="thedailybeast.com"/&gt;

==Unmasking and criminal procedings==
News reports about the Australi Witness online persona calling for the Garland attack first brought the account to the attention of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI).&lt;ref name="abc 2015-09-11"/&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian1/&gt;&lt;ref name="plea"/&gt; The [[Australian Federal Police]] (AFP) alerted the FBI about the real identity of Australi Witness, with the AFP, in turn, being handed the information by two Australian journalists, Luke McMahon and Elise Potaka.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web | website=BBC News | title=Neo-Nazi, radical feminist and violent jihadist - all at once | date=September 21, 2015 | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-34292809}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smh.com.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/unmasking-a-troll-aussie-jihadist-australi-witness-a-20yearold-american-nerd-20150909-gjil47.html|title=Luke McMahon &amp; Elise Potka, Unmasking a troll: Aussie 'jihadist' Australi Witness a 20-year-old American nerd|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=September 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to the FBI affidavit filed in court, by the time they received this information from the AFP, their investigation into Goldberg was already well underway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crikey.com.au/2015/09/18/did-fbi-islamophobia-entrap-an-american-jew/?wpmp_switcher=mobile|title=Did FBI Islamophobia entrap an American Jew?|work=Crikey|date=September 18, 2015|first=Shakira|last=Hussein}}&lt;/ref&gt; McMahon and Potaka independently tracked and identified the person behind the Australi Witness account after he impersonated Potaka on Facebook, leading to a chain of events which connected Australi Witness to Goldberg.&lt;ref name="smh.com.au"/&gt; The FBI also directly linked Australi Witness to Goldberg via his [[IP address]].&lt;ref name=cnn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/09/10/us/9-11-memorial-bomb-plot-kansas-city-missouri/|title=Man accused of bomb plot at 9/11 event, FBI says - CNN.com|author=Ralph Ellis and Greg Botelho, CNN|date=September 10, 2015|accessdate=September 10, 2015|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australi Witness passed specific&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt; information on the manufacture of a bomb targeting a September 11 memorial event in [[Kansas City, Missouri]] to an FBI informant, who was posing as a Muslim extremist. According to the FBI, Australi Witness suggested that the informant bomb the memorial in Kansas City after the latter claimed to live near that city,&lt;ref name="jpostTroll"&gt;{{Cite web|title = American Jewish 'online troll' arrested in alleged Kansas City 9/11 memorial bomb plot|url = http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/American-Jewish-online-troll-arrested-in-alleged-Kansas-City-911-memorial-bomb-plot-415948|website = The Jerusalem Post {{!}} JPost.com|accessdate = 2015-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also encouraged the informant to make the bomb more deadly by adding [[Rodenticide|rat poison]] to the [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]].&lt;ref name="abc 2015-09-11"/&gt; ''Australi Witness'' posted pictures online of what he claimed to be a bomb he was building&lt;ref name="independentJewishIsis"/&gt;&lt;ref name=theAgeFBIAustraliWitness&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/fbi-says-australian-is-jihadist-is-actually-a-jewish-american-troll-named-joshua-ryne-goldberg-20150911-gjk852.html|title=FBI says 'Australian IS jihadist' is actually a Jewish American troll named Joshua Ryne Goldberg|work=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt; and emailed [[BBC]] journalist Mike Wendling claiming credit for the Curtis Culwell Center attack, and warning that a pressure cooker bomb would be detonated in a "large Midwestern US city" on September 11, 2015.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;

Goldberg was arrested by the FBI after being identified as Australi Witness on September 9, 2015. After a raid on his home by the FBI, Goldberg allegedly admitted to agents that he had distributed the information about making the bomb in Kansas City.&lt;ref name="smhJihadistTroll"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/australian-is-jihadist-is-actually-an-jewish-american-troll-20150911-gjk852.html|title=FBI says 'Australian IS jihadist' is actually a Jewish American troll named Joshua Ryne Goldberg|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldberg appeared in court on September 15, where he was ordered to undergo a 30-day [[Competency evaluation (law)|mental health evaluation]] to determine his fitness to stand trial.

After his arrest, it emerged that Goldberg had previously been diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]] and [[anxiety disorder]].&lt;ref name="mentalIllnessHistory"/&gt; On December 14, 2015, after an examination by prison psychologist Lisa Feldman at [[Federal Detention Center, Miami]],&lt;ref name="mediaRequestsPsychologicalReport"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jacksonville.com/news/crime/2015-12-29/story/media-asks-court-release-psychologist-report-orange-park-man-accused|title=Media asks court to release psychologist report of Orange Park man accused of terrorism|author=Larry Hannan|work=[[The Florida Times-Union]]|date=December 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; US Magistrate Judge James Klindt ruled Goldberg mentally incompetent to stand trial and Goldberg was ordered to undergo psychiatric treatment for four months at the [[Federal Medical Center, Butner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hannan|first1=Larry|title=Psychologist finds Orange Park man who plotted terrorist act to be mentally unstable|url=http://jacksonville.com/news/crime/2015-12-03/story/psychologist-finds-orange-park-man-who-plotted-terrorist-act-be-mentally|accessdate=14 December 2015|work=The Florida Times Union}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstcoastnews.com/story/news/local/2015/12/14/goldberg-deemed-not-competent-to-stand-trial/77283954/|title=Alleged 9/11 terror plot organizer deemed 'not competent' to stand trial|date=December 14, 2015|work=[[firstcoastnews.com]]|accessdate=December 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/mental-competency-hearing-set-man-accused-bomb-plot-35753365|title=Judge: Man Accused in Bomb Plot Not Competent for Trial|author=ABC News|work=ABC News|accessdate=December 14, 2015|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20151216112640/http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/mental-competency-hearing-set-man-accused-bomb-plot-35753365|archivedate=December 16, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="psychologicalReportReleased"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jacksonville.com/news/crime/2016-01-25/story/most-psychologist-report-orange-park-man-accused-terrorism-released|title=Most of psychologist report on Orange Park man accused of terrorism released to public|author=Larry Hannan|work=[[The Florida Times-Union]]|date=January 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldberg again appeared before Klindt on June 15, 2016, and was described by prison psychiatrists as "improving", and that there was a "good chance" of him being returned to competency to stand trial.

On 20 December 2017, Goldberg pleaded guilty to attempted malicious damage and destruction by an explosive of a building, in the [[United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida]].&lt;ref name="plea" /&gt; According to the [[plea agreement]], Goldberg also claimed to have been planning a terrorist attack in [[Melbourne, Australia]].&lt;ref name="newsComAuGuiltyPleaIncitement"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/internet-troll-joshua-goldberg-attempted-to-incite-terror-attacks-in-melbourne/news-story/07986e685672651e62edca37295fad4f|title=Internet troll Joshua Goldberg attempted to incite terror attacks in Melbourne|work=news.com.au|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5359">'''''KFOG KaBoom''''' was an annual outdoor concert held by [[KFOG]] in [[San Francisco]] and which occurred in May from 1994 to 2010. It was followed by a fireworks show&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title =KFOG KaBoom! | publisher =Teevan Productions | url =http://teevanproductions.com/kfog.html | accessdate =August 31, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/search.php?query=KFOG%20kaboom%20AND%20collection%3Aopensource_movies Internet Archive: Open Source Movies]&lt;/ref&gt; synchronized to a soundtrack broadcast by the station. The extravagant fireworks display drew over 350,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/culture/detail?blogid=3&amp;entry_id=4239 350,000 people and KFOG KaBoom]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007, KaBoom began charging admission due to rising costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/nwzchik/detail?blogid=32&amp;entry_id=16469 "this is the first year the station is charging" Suzanne Herel @ sfgate.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Through 1998, the event was known as the ''Sky Concert'', but was renamed in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/fedrgstr/EPA-IMPACT/1999/July/Day-21/i18486.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, this was due to the name being too generic {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} and may conflict with Keilwerth S.K.Y. Concert Saxophones.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

In 2010, the [[Port of San Francisco]] informed KFOG that Piers 30/32 in downtown San Francisco could no longer support the heavy equipment and vehicles necessary to produce large events.&lt;ref name="kaboom"&gt;http://www.kfog.com/Pages/KFOGKaBoom2010.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; In May of that same year, KaBoom was moved from the pier location to the parking lot of [[Candlestick Park]].

In the spring of 2011, KFOG announced that a proper venue for the show could not be found, and that KaBoom for 2011 was cancelled.  No announcement has since been made for KaBoom since 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kfog.com KFOG 104.5/97.7 FM: World Class Rock|accessdate=May 11, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod''' is a music festival which takes place every year during the second week of July in [[Llangollen]], North [[Wales]]. It is one of several large annual [[Eisteddfodau]] in Wales. Singers and dancers from around the world are invited to take part in over 20 competitions followed each evening by concerts on the main stage. Over five thousand singers, dancers and instrumentalists from around 50 countries perform to audiences of more than 50,000 over the 6 days of the event.

Famous performers at Llangollen have included [[Luciano Pavarotti]] (who first competed in Llangollen in 1955 with his father and a choir from their home town [[Modena]], and for whom the Eisteddfod's principal trophy – the Choir of the World Pavarotti Trophy – is named&lt;ref&gt;

==Origins==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
[[File:Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod (7500262970).jpg|thumb|250px|Dancing at the 1957 Eisteddfod]]
The origins of the International Eisteddfod go back to 1943 when Harold Tudor, an officer of the [[British Council]], arranged a visit for members of governments-in-exile to the [[Welsh National Eisteddfod]] in [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]]. The excursion was well received especially by the noted writer and poet Juraj Slavik, the Minister for the Interior in the [[Czechoslovak]]ia Government in Exile. Following the visit he wrote to Tudor praising the value of music as a way of healing the effects of War. The following year an international concert was held as part of the Llandybie National Eisteddfod.

Towards the end of 1945 Tudor proposed that an international choral festival be added to the 1947 [[Welsh National Eisteddfod]], however the Council of the National Eisteddfod felt that as all their effort were involved in rebuilding their own organisation they could not take on such a scheme. Tudor modified his proposal into an independent music festival and found support for this idea from [[W. S. Gwynn Williams]], Welsh composer and music publisher and George Northing, a teacher from Dinas Brân County School and chairman of Llangollen town council. Gwynn Williams and Northing both pressed for the Eisteddfod to be in their home town of Llangollen.

The public gave support to this idea at two public meetings in May 1946 but concerns were also raised about who would come, where the event would be held and how the event would be financed.
The British Council offered to help find choirs from Europe and to give financial support however the town decided to raise the money through a public subscription and quickly gathered over £1100.
George Northing was made director of the executive board; Gwynn Williams became music director; Harold Tudor was Director of Publicity and W. Clayton Russon, a local businessman and [[High Sheriff of Merionethshire]] became President.

Plans to hold the event on the school field of Dinas Bran County School progressed throughout 1946-47. Accommodation for the overseas competitors would be in houses in the town and surrounding area and domestic participants would be given beds in church and school halls. As [[rationing]] was still in place ration coupons had to be found for all the visitors and the [[Minister of Food (United Kingdom)|Minister of Food]] was eventually persuaded to supply these.

When in June 1947 it was time for competitors to travel to Llangollen a railway strike had started in [[France]] and there were serious doubt as to whether any overseas competitors would be able to arrive. Considerable relief was felt by the organisers when the first coach of competitors arrived bringing the ladies’ choir Grupo Musical Feminino from [[Oporto]]. They were the eventual winners of the Ladies Competition whilst the Men's competition was won by the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] workers’ choir, who had completed their journey to Wales by hitch-hiking when their train had been cancelled at [[Basle]] because of the French strike.

The [[Esperanto|Esperanto Society]] played a significant part in the first year when it was felt that there could be a shortage of participants. [[Reto Rossetti]], a well-known figure and author in the Esperanto movement, was asked to help and through publicity in Esperanto magazines and to the surprised of the organisers, several groups contacted the Eisteddfod committee. Two troupes of Spanish dancers, on a tour of Britain sponsored by the British Council and the Esperanto Society, arrived and despite there not being a dance competition in the first year, performed to delighted audiences. Folk dance competitions have featured in every subsequent Llangollen Eisteddfod.

The eisteddfod was brought to close by what has now become the traditional Sunday concert featuring Sir John Barbirolli and the [[Hallé Orchestra]]. The 1947 International Eisteddfod was hailed as an unqualified success with praise for the organisers, the founders, and all the competitors. There was even a surplus of £1,432 to be used for the next year's event.

A major test mission to promote reconciliation occurred in 1949, just four years after the end of the war, when a choir from [[Lübeck]] came to compete at the Eisteddfod. There had been Austrian and Italian choirs, but they hardly counted; neither did Spaniards.  As the choir tell it in a letter now in the Clwyd archive in Ruthin, there was a tearful welcome with tea and sandwiches when the choir arrived at the Llangollen station from the eisteddfod helpers and the townspeople. Later, the festival's compère Mr Hywel Roberts introduced the choir with the words:  "Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome our friends from Germany."  The town organised a concert to help the choir raise funds, and (in 2015) members of the choir still correspond with Llangollen friends.

==Recent years==
The 2007 Eisteddfod included performances by [[José Carreras]], [[Joan Baez]], and [[Hayley Westenra]]. In 2008, there were performances by [[Elaine Paige]], [[All Angels]], and [[Alfie Boe]]; in 2009, performances by [[Barbara Dickson]], Sir [[Willard White]], [[Blake (band)|Blake]], and [[Natasha Marsh]], with a [[James Bond]] 007 spectacular, featuring the Orchestra of [[Welsh National Opera]], as the Sunday finale; 2010 saw performances by [[Katherine Jenkins]] and [[Nigel Kennedy]]. In 2011 there were concerts featuring [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]], [[Russell Watson]], [[Faryl Smith]], Ruthie Henshaw and [[McFly]].

In 2012 the Eisteddfod played host to [[Lesley Garrett]], [[Alison Balsom]], Nicola Benedettii and [[Sian Edwards]] in a celebration concert for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. There were also appearances by [[Alfie Boe]], Steffan Morris, and Valentina Nafornta, and a performance of [[Karl Jenkins]]'s new work "The Peacemakers" by a specially formed massed choir accompanied by the Llangollen International Eisteddfod Orchestra. The week was rounded off by the Grand Finale Concert, featuring Fflur Wyn, [[Wynne Evans]], Mark Llewelyn Evans, [[John Owen-Jones]] and Richard Balcombe.

In recent years the Sunday evening concert has been given over to more "popular" music. Starting with [[McFly]] in 2011, subsequent concerts have included [[UB40]], [[Status Quo (band)]], and [[Manic Street Preachers]].

==Parade==
A [[parade]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.international-eisteddfod.co.uk/en/whats-on/the-parade-of-nations Parade of Nations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110308011251/http://international-eisteddfod.co.uk/en/whats-on/the-parade-of-nations |date=2011-03-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is usually held on the Tuesday of the Eisteddfod week, in which both the locals and visitors, take part [[dancing]], [[singing]], and playing [[musical instruments]], whilst marching the streets of Llangollen. However, in 2016 the parade was moved to the Friday to enable more competitors to take part.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://international-eisteddfod.co.uk/sex-and-the-city-singers-bring-musical-fizz-to-llangollen/ Sex and the City singers bring musical fizz to Llangollen]".

The '''Malaysia International Halal Showcase''' or MIHAS is an annual [[trade fair]] organised by the [http://www.matrade.gov.my Malaysia External Trade Development Corporation (MATRADE)] and managed by  Shapers Malaysia&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mihas.com.my/ Shapers Malaysia]&lt;/ref&gt; (formerly Indah Profiles), as MIHAS Secretariat. It aims to facilitate the sourcing and selling of quality [[halal]] products and services globally.

MIHAS first started in 2004, is typically held in April in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]] and the event runs for four days. For the past few years, the event is held at the [[Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre]].

==Background/History==
[[File:MIHAS exhibition.JPG|thumb|MIHAS exhibition halls]]

MIHAS was founded by Shapers Malaysia in 2004 and in 2008, ownership of this Halal event was transferred to the Malaysian government under the auspices of the Malaysia External Trade and Development Corporation (MATRADE).

MIHAS was first held in 2004 at the Malaysia International Exhibition &amp; Convention Centre (MIECC), [[MINES Resort City|Mines Resort City]], Kuala Lumpur. The inaugural event was officiated by the (now former) [[Prime Minister of Malaysia]], [[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi|Tun Abdullah Haji Ahmad Badawi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SPEECH BY YAB DATO' SERI ABDULLAH HAJI AHMAD BADAWI, PRIME MINISTER OF MALAYSIA AT THE OFFICIAL LAUNCH OF THE MALAYSIA INTERNATIONAL HALAL SHOWCASE (MIHAS) 2004|url=http://www.pmo.gov.my/ucapan/?m=p&amp;p=paklah&amp;id=2880|publisher=pmo.gov.my}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, there were 330 companies occupying 505 booth spaces from 19 different countries including Malaysia, the country host. MIHAS attracted 17,254 visitors from 42 countries that year.

==Programmes==
[[File:MIHAS booths.JPG|thumb|Various booths at MIHAS]]

[http://www.mihas.com.my/exhibit/business-matching.php Incoming Buying Mission (IBM)] programme was first introduced during MIHAS 2005. The business matching programme provides one-to-one discussions and business negotiations between buyers and sellers. The first year resulted in a total sales of RM229.9million. The programme has been a staple of MIHAS ever since. In 2012, the business matching sessions yielded a total generated sales of RM340 million (USD110 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mohamad|first=YB Dato’ Sri Mustapa|title=Opening Ceremony Halal Week Malaysia (4 April 2012)|url=http://www.matrade.gov.my/ru/about-matrade/media/speeches/speeches-2012/2026-opening-ceremony-halal-week-malaysia-4-april-2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IBM is wholly organised by MATRADE and it is conducted a day before the trade show. The participants consists of international buyers from all over the globe who are looking to source Halal products.

There are various '''Activities by Exhibitors''' throughout the event that include press conference, product briefing, product launching and signing ceremonies, as well as cooking demonstrations on the exhibition floor. These activities are conducted within the exhibition halls, either at the exhibitor booths or the Media Village.

The 14th Edition of MIHAS was held from 5–8 April 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://info.japantimes.co.jp/special/malaysia-international-halal-showcase-2017/#.WO4jr_k1_IU|title=MIHAS to boost Japanese firms performance in the halal sector {{!}} The Japan Times|work=The Japan Times|access-date=2017-04-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Site of Old Oak, Carmarthen.jpg|thumb|Site of Merlin's Oak – a replacement tree grows in a planter]]
'''Merlin's Oak''' is a famous [[oak| oak tree]] that once stood on the corner of Oak Lane and Priory Street in [[Carmarthen]], [[South Wales]].

== Merlin's prophecy ==

&lt;poem&gt;
When Merlin's Oak shall tumble down,
Then shall fall Carmarthen Town.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Other versions of the prophecy state that when the tree falls, the town will drown or flood.

== History ==
Merlin's Oak was probably planted by a schoolmaster in 1659 or 1660, to celebrate the return of King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] of England to the throne. In the early 19th century, a local man appears to have poisoned the tree, with the intention of stopping people from meeting under it, and the oak is believed to have died in 1856.

In 1951, a branch was broken off the tree. This fragment can still be seen in [[Carmarthenshire County Museum]]. In 1978, the last fragment of the tree was removed from its original place, and is now in Saint Peter's Civic Hall in Nott Square, Carmarthen.

{{History of Mexico |Modern}}

The term '''Mexican miracle''' is used in common speech, but not by economists, to refer to the country's inward-looking development strategy that produced sustained [[economic growth]] of 3 to 4 percent and modest 3 percent [[inflation]] annually from the 1940s until the 1970s.

==History==

===Creating conditions for sustained growth===
An important factor helping sustained growth in the period 1940–1970 was the reduction of political turmoil, particularly around national elections, with the creation of a single, dominant party.  In 1946, the party founded by [[Plutarco Elías Calles]] in the wake of President-elect [[Álvaro Obregón]]'s assassination in 1928 changed its name to the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]]. With the party's presidential choice in 1946, [[Miguel Alemán Valdés]], Mexico elected its first civilian president since [[Francisco I. Madero]] in 1911. The subsequent elections of [[Adolfo Ruiz Cortines]] (1952–58) and [[Adolfo López Mateos]] (1958–64), [[Gustavo Díaz Ordaz]] (1964–70) there were no political opposition challenges to the government's implementation of economic programs.

During the presidency of [[Lázaro Cárdenas]], there were significant policies in the social and political spheres that had impacts on future economic policies in Mexico, in particular [[Mexican oil expropriation|nationalization of oil]] in 1938, as well as land reform, and nationalization of railways.&lt;ref&gt;Howard F. Cline, ''Mexico: Revolution to Evolution, 1940–1960''. Oxford: Oxford University Press 1962, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; Cárdenas was succeeded by the politically more moderate [[Manuel Ávila Camacho]], who initiated a program of industrialization in early 1941 with the Law of Manufacturing Industries. One scholar has called the inaugural date of this law "the birthday of the Institutional Revolution," since it was the inception of import-substitution industrialization.&lt;ref&gt;Cline, ''Mexico: Revolution to Evolution'', p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; Further legislation in 1946 under President [[Miguel Alemán Valdés]], the Law for Development of New and Necessary Industries, was passed.&lt;ref&gt;Sanford Mosk, ''Industrial Revolution in Mexico''. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;

"In the long view, some of the permanent alterations in Mexico from World War II were economic."&lt;ref&gt;Howard F. Cline, ''The United States and Mexico'', revised edition. New York: Atheneum Press, 1962, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mexico benefited significantly during World War II, by its participation on the side of the Allies. Mexico supplied labor to the U.S. via the [[Bracero Program]], but its most significant contribution was in its supply of material to fight the war. It received cash payments for its material contributions, which meant that following the war the Mexican treasury had robust reserves. Although a participant in the war, like the U.S., Mexico was not a site of combat, so that in the post-war era, Mexico did not need to rebuild damaged infrastructure. However, with the resources available following the war, Mexico embarked on big infrastructure projects.

Ávila Camacho used part of the accumulated savings to pay off foreign debts, so that Mexico's credit standing substantially improved (increasing investors' confidence in the government). With increased revenues coming from the war effort, the government was now in a position to distribute material benefits from the Revolution more widely; he used funds to subsidize food imports that especially affected urban workers. Workers in Mexico received higher salaries during the war, but there was a lack of consumer goods to purchase, so that workers had both personal savings and pent up demand for goods. A key government institution for development, founded under Lázaro Cárdenas's administration was ''Nacional Financiera'' (abbreviated ''Nafin''), the national development bank, which funded the expansion of the industrial sector.&lt;ref&gt;Cline, ''The United States and Mexico'', p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Growth was sustained by the government's increasing commitment to primary education for the general population from the late 1920s through the 1940s. The enrollment rates of the country's youth increased threefold during this period;&lt;ref&gt;Easterlin, R. "Why Isn't the Whole World Developed?", Appendix Table 1. ''The Journal of Economic History'' Vol. 41 No. 1, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; consequently when this generation was employed by the 1940s their economic output was more productive. Mexico also made investments in higher education that created a generation of scientists, social scientists, and engineers, who enabled Mexican industrial innovation. The founding of the [[Instituto Politécnico Nacional]] (''IPN'') in 1936 as a government-funded institution in the northern part of Mexico City, trained a new generation of Mexicans. In northern Mexico, the [[Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education]], known in Mexico as the ''Tec de Monterrey'' was founded by northern industrialists in 1942, with the programs designed by a former faculty member of the IPN and modeled after the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. From a small, private inception, the Tec de Monterrey built a major campus inaugurated by President Alemán in 1946, and has been a magnet for students from other areas of Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;Cline, ''The United States and Mexico'', p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Import-substitution program and infrastructure projects===
In the years following [[World War II]], [[President of Mexico|President]] [[Miguel Alemán Valdés]] (1946–52) instituted a full-scale [[import-substitution]] program which stimulated output by boosting internal demand. The government raised import controls on consumer goods but relaxed them on capital goods (such as machinery for Mexican production of consumer goods), which it purchased with international reserves accumulated during the war. The government spent it heavily on infrastructure, including major dam projects to produce [[hydroelectric]] power, supply drinking water to cities and irrigation water to agriculture, and control flooding.&lt;ref&gt;Cline, ''Mexico: Revolution to Evolution'', pp. 68–81.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1950 Mexico's road network had expanded to 21,000 kilometers, of which some 13,600 were paved.&lt;ref&gt;Cline, ''Mexico: Revolution to Evolution'', pp. 63–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

The economic stability of the country, high credit rating allowing borrowing, an increasingly educated work force, and savings allowing purchase of consumer goods were excellent conditions for the government's program of import substitution industrialization.  Finished goods previously purchased abroad could be produced domestically with the purchase of machinery. One successful industry was textile production. Foreign transnational companies established branches in Mexico, such as [[Coca-Cola]], [[Pepsi-Cola]], and [[Sears (Mexico)]] under Mexican laws regulating foreign investment.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel James, "Sears Roebuck's Mexican Revolution," ''Harper's Magazine'' (June 1959) 1–6.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[automotive industry in Mexico]] already had been established shortly after the end of the military phase of the [[Mexican Revolution]], with [[Buick]] became the first automobile producer to be officially established in Mexico in 1921. In 1925, [[Ford Motor Company]] was too established and began manufacturing vehicles in the country.  With a growing middle class consumer market for such expensive consumer goods, the industrial base of Mexico expanded to meet the demand. 

The government fostered the development of consumer goods industries directed toward [[domestic market]]s by imposing high protective tariffs and other barriers to [[International trade|imports]]. The share of imports subject to licensing requirements rose from 28 percent in 1956 to an average of more than 60 percent during the 1960s and about 70 percent in the 1970s. Industry accounted for 22 percent of total output in 1950, 24 percent in 1960, and 29 percent in 1970. The share of total output arising from agriculture and other primary activities declined during the same period, while services stayed constant.

The government promoted industrial expansion through [[Government bond|public investment]] in agricultural, energy, and transportation infrastructure. Cities grew rapidly during these years, reflecting the shift of employment from agriculture to industry and services. The urban population increased at a high rate after 1940. Growth of the urban labor force exceeded even the growth rate of industrial employment, with surplus workers taking low-paying service jobs.

===Economic performance===
Mexico's strong economic performance continued into the 1960s, when [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] growth averaged about 7 percent overall and about 3 percent per capita. Consumer price inflation averaged only 3 percent annually. [[Manufacturing]] remained the country's dominant growth sector, expanding 7 percent annually and attracting considerable [[Foreign direct investment|foreign investment]]. 

[[Mining]] grew at an annual rate of nearly 4 percent, trade at 6 percent, and [[agriculture]] at 3 percent. By 1970 Mexico had diversified its [[export|export base]] and become largely self-sufficient in [[food]] [[crop]]s, [[steel]], and most [[consumer good]]s. Although its imports remained high, most were [[capital good]]s used to expand domestic production.

'''Miss Guadeloupe''' is overseas department [[beauty pageant]] responsible for selecting [[Guadeloupe]]'s representative to [[Miss France]] pageant. This pageant is not related to ''[[Miss International Guadeloupe]]'' contest.

==History==
Miss Guadeloupe pageant has been known since 1977 when the island competed at the [[Miss Universe]] pageant. At least since 1979, the island joins Miss France contest as overseas department of the country. Since 1985 it has boycotted the Miss Universe pageant, because of the pageant does allow the island to compete in a national competition as a region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Miss Universe Guadeloupe |publisher=pageantopolis.com |url=http://www.pageantopolis.com/international/Universe_lists_g.htm |accessdate=2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709071616/http://www.pageantopolis.com/international/Universe_lists_g.htm |archivedate=2015-07-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Vasco o.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Vasco Rossi]] in 2016]]
The last concert performed by Vasco in Modena dates back to 22 September 2001 during the [[Festa de l'Unità|Festa nazionale de l'Unità]], on his ''Stupido Hotel'' tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} {{Cite news |last=Marini |first=Andrea |title="Festeggio i miei 40 anni di live con un concerto a Modena Park" |newspaper=Gazzetta di Modena |date=2016-04-21 |url=http://gazzettadimodena.gelocal.it/modena/cronaca/2016/04/21/news/festeggio-i-miei-40-anni-di-live-con-un-concerto-a-modena-park-1.13336568 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803130239/http://gazzettadimodena.gelocal.it/modena/cronaca/2016/04/21/news/festeggio-i-miei-40-anni-di-live-con-un-concerto-a-modena-park-1.13336568 |archivedate=3 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 April 2016, Vasco announced the organization of a concert in Modena, the city where he began his 40-year career as a DJ and singer. Initially, the event was to be called ''Modena... Modena park tutto ritorna'' (Modena... Modena Park all is back), in reference to lyrics of his song ''Colpa d'Alfredo'' (''Alfredo's fault''), in which a girl asks Vasco, "Mi puoi portare a casa questa sera? Abito fuori Modena, Modena park" ("Can you bring me home tonight? I'm living out of Modena...

==Staging==
[[File:Vigili del fuoco al concerto di Vasco Rossi al Modena Park.jpg|300px|thumb|left|A moment of the concert]]
The stage at Enzo Ferrari park was {{convert|165|m}} long and stood {{convert|8|m}} off the ground. It featured five large video screens with a total area of {{convert|1500|m²}}. Four of these were set on tracks, so that they could move sideways depending on the video [[scenography]] required during each song. The remaining four screens, two per side, were installed within PIT 3. Special effects were produced by 2,100 light points and 140 lasers. Transportation of all the staging equipment required a total of 136 semi-trailer trucks.&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} {{cite news |last=Zuffi |first=Danilo |title=Un impianto avvenieristico per vivere insieme lo show |newspaper=Gazzetta di Modena |date=29 June 2017 |page=V}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{{it icon}} {{cite news |last=Marini |first=Andrea |title=Palco come scalo merci: nei container la Vasco-story |newspaper=Gazzetta di Modena |date=29 June 2017 |page=VII}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sound was played through a 750,000-watt [[L-Acoustics]] audio system consisting of 900 speaker modules connected by {{convert|100|km}} of [[fiber optic cables]], with 29 sound towers to allow all 230,000 viewers along a {{convert|400|m|adj=on}}-long lawn to listen without return or echo effects. According to production staff, one [[Watt#Megawatt|megawatt]] of energy was consumed during the concert. The two main towers located in front of the stage, each containing 80 speaker modules, were suspended using two-ton cranes for each tower.&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} {{Cite news |title=Vasco canta a 750 mila watt, con 29 torri diffusione e 100 km di cavi |last=Pagliarini |first=Enrico |newspaper=Il Sole 24 Ore |date=1 July 2017 |url=http://mobile.ilsole24ore.com/solemobile/main/art/cultura/2017-07-01/vasco-canta-750-mila-watt-29-torri-diffusione-e-100-km-cavi-093534.shtml |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170804214324/http://mobile.ilsole24ore.com/solemobile/main/art/cultura/2017-07-01/vasco-canta-750-mila-watt-29-torri-diffusione-e-100-km-cavi-093534.shtml |archivedate=4 August 2017 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mongolia Charity Rally Jeep.JPG|thumb|280px|right]]
The '''Mongolia Charity Rally''' is the charity rally from [[London]] to the capital of [[Mongolia]], [[Ulaanbaatar]]. The '''Mongolia Charity Rally''' is organised by Charity Rallies, part of '''Go Help''', a UK-based charity.

== Adventure ==
Participants start the {{convert|10000|mi|km|adj=on}} trip from a Mongolian Naadam festival in London, [[England]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} The vehicles are then driven to Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, where they are donated to a partner charity of Go Help for auction. Charity Ralliers must raise a minimum of £1,500 for [http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/ShowCharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityFramework.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1129226&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0 Go Help, the registered UK charity] that runs Charity Rallies, through [http://www.justgiving.com/gohelp/ Go Help's Justgiving page], before departing.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} The main beneficiary of the 2008 and 2009 Mongolia Charity Rally was Save the Children.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

The Mongolia Charity Rally launches from Highbury Fields in Islington, London. Go Help and the Mongolian Association organise a Mongolian Naadam to see Charity Ralliers off on their adventure, an event that is heavily attended by the Mongolian community in London, [http://www.yournews.itvlocal.com/Clip.aspx?key=F10848C49E0915AF and was featured on ITV Local], a UK television network.

== Routes ==
The main routes to Mongolia are either the Northern Route, from London to Mongolia via Moscow, or the Southern Route, via Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Russia.

== Entry fees ==
The Mongolia Charity Rally charges an entry fee that is aimed at covering the costs of running the event.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} All excess funds that are generated from entry fees are donated to a project started by Go Help that provides riding helmets to child jockeys taking part in Mongolian Naadam festivals, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnYejPMyFoc&amp;feature=channel_page  a project that was covered by Mongolian television in 2008]. The entry fee for the Mongolia Charity Rally 2010 is £300 for teams signing up before October 1, after which the invitation is by invitation only. The entry fee for 2009 was also £300, which is less than half the entry fee of £650 charged in 2009 by a competing rally run by a profit making company. The 2008 entry fee was £150. The increase reflected two major additions to Go Help's budget: the hiring of an employee in Mongolia to oversee vehicle sales and to monitor the application of funds raised by Charity Ralliers, and the costs of full-time development of the Charity Rallies website.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6051">'''Pharma fraud''' is a term to describe several illegal activities involving the manufacturing, marketing, and distribution of pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref&gt; The phrase was proposed by [[Ellen 't Hoen]] of [[Médecins Sans Frontières|MSF]], during the 61st [[World Health Assembly]] meeting in Geneva, in response to controversies over the use of the term "counterfeiting" in draft WHA resolutions, to describe activities that often involved health risks from unsafe, substandard or fake medicines.  The use of the term counterfeit was problematic and inaccurate to describe all of these activities, and health experts were seeking a new term to collectively describe these harmful activities.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition and examples==

For example, Pharma fraud refers to:
* Trade involving [[counterfeit drugs]]: the practice of falsely claiming to be an authorized product of another firm, including but not limited to the use of another firm's mark to deceive the public.&lt;ref&gt; See, for example, [http://www.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/A61/A61_16-en.pdf Counterfeit medical products] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422102823/http://www.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/A61/A61_16-en.pdf |date=2009-04-22 }}, Report by the Secretariat, A61/16, 7 April 2008. &lt;/ref&gt;
* Deliberately manufacturing and marketing products that do not contain the required active ingredients or not contain the right amount of active ingredient.&lt;ref&gt;"Fake Malaria Drugs Made In China: Tracking Down The Threat To Global Health," ''ScienceDaily'', Feb. 13, 2008.  Newton PN, Fernandez FM, Plancon A, Mildenhall DC, Green MD,et al. (2008) A collaborative epidemiologica investigation into the criminal fake artesunate trade in South East Asia. ''PLoS Med'' 5(2): e32.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Packaging and labeling]] of drugs that make false claims regarding medical properties, including but not limited to the active medical ingredients, the date of expiration of products, or the methods of storage.&lt;ref&gt;Claire Panosian Dunavan, [http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/oped/bal-op.heparin09may09,0,356719.story "Drug safety crisis hits home"], ''Baltimore Sun'', May 9, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Marketing of products using false claims regarding the efficacy of the product which will lead to the irrational use&lt;ref&gt;Laing, R.O., "Rational Drug Use: An Unsolved Problem," ''Tropical Doctor'' 1990, 20, 101-103.  [http://www.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/EB118/B118_6-en.pdf Rational use of medicines: progress in implementing the WHO medicines strategy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080520231342/http://www.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/EB118/B118_6-en.pdf |date=2008-05-20 }}, Report by the Secretariat, EB118/6, May 2006. A group that monitors this issue in developing countries is the [http://www.inrud.org/ International Network for the Rational Use of Medicines].&lt;/ref&gt; of medicines or deliberately failing to provide information about safety concerns of the product.  
* Deliberate suppression of data, including evidence from clinical trials,&lt;ref&gt;Ed Silverman, "2000 study by Merck showed Vioxx risk Results not given to FDA," ''Star-Ledger'', July 03, 2005.  Morse Mehrbanm, "Failure to disclose adverse health consequences of a product constitutes health fraud,"[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3879/is_199807/ai_n8786081 NCRHI Newsletter], Jul/Aug 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; that reveal [[adverse effects]] of the medicine.
&lt;br /&gt;

==Regulation ==
Because of a lack of regulation and enforcement, the quality, safety and efficacy of both imported and locally manufactured medicines in many developing countries cannot be guaranteed. Subsequently, smuggling and illegal importation of drugs are common. Substandard and counterfeit drugs are then not only sold in these countries but also exported or re-exported. &lt;ref&gt;"Substandard and counterfeit medicines {{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/2003/fs275/en/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428200919/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/2003/fs275/en/ |archivedate=2012-04-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the World Customs Organization, counterfeit drugs are a $200 billion a year industry. &lt;ref&gt; "Customs group to fight $200 bln bogus drug industry" [https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/06/10/us-customs-drugs-idUSTRE65961U20100610] &lt;/ref&gt;

==Meningitis epidemic in Niger==

In response to a [[meningitis]] epidemic in [[Niger]] from February to May 1995 (41, 000 cases reported), the Niger authorities organized an extensive [[vaccination]] campaign. In March 1995, Niger received a donation of 88,000 [[Pasteur Mérieux]] and [[SmithKline Beecham]] vaccines from neighboring Nigeria. A [[Médecins Sans Frontières]] (MSF) team working with local health authorities noticed that the vaccines from [[Nigeria]] had an unusual appearance and inquiries were made. Pasteur Mérieux laboratories confirmed that the batch numbers and the expiration dates did not correspond to their manufacturing records. The drugs supplied by these companies had been substituted with [[counterfeit drugs]]. Tests carried out found no traces of active product, which confirmed that they were false. Bottles and labels were, however, copied to perfection. According to estimates, around 60,000 persons were inoculated with false vaccines out of a total 5 million vaccinated during the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;“Access to essential drugs in poor countries: a lost battle?”{{cite web |url=http://www.accessmed-msf.org/resources/key-publications/key-publication-detail/article/access-to-essential-drugs-in-poor-countries-a-lost-battle-1/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303171108/http://www.accessmed-msf.org/resources/key-publications/key-publication-detail/article/access-to-essential-drugs-in-poor-countries-a-lost-battle-1/ |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===
The series first appeared as part of [[WGN America]]'s development slate in July 2012, under the title ''Malice''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2012/07/12/development-update-thursday-july-12-576014/9870/ |title=Development Update: Thursday, July 12 |date=July 12, 2012 |work=The Futon Critic |accessdate=January 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 4, 2013, WGN America bypassed the pilot stage and placed a series order for 13 episodes, under the new title ''Salem''.&lt;ref name=seriesorder&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/06/wgn-america-greenlights-its-first-original-scriptd-series-brannon-bragas-salem/ |title=WGN America Greenlights Its First Original Scripted Series, Brannon Braga's 'Salem' |last=Andreeva |first=Nellie |publisher=Deadline.com |date=June 4, 2013 |accessdate=January 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 8, 2013, filming of the series began in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], on an expansive set reflecting 17th-century Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2013/11/08/wgn-america-announces-start-of-production-on-first-original-scripted-series-salem-449112/20131108wgn01/ |title=WGN America Announces Start of Production on First Original Scripted Series, "Salem" |date=November 8, 2013 |work=The Futon Critic |accessdate=January 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 15, 2014, ''Salem'' was renewed for a 13-episode second season by WGN America.&lt;ref name="Eggersten"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/01/28/salem-season-two-premieres-sunday-april-5-at-10pm/356783/ |title='Salem' Season Two Premieres Sunday, April 5 at 10PM |work=TV by the Numbers |last=Kondolojy |first=Amanda |date=January 28, 2015 |accessdate=January 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_erFOGbkNw |title=SALEM Season 2 Teaser Trailer |publisher=WGN America}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 11, 2015, ''Salem'' was renewed for a 10-episode third season by WGN America.&lt;ref name=TVBTNS3/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/comic-con-salem-renewed-third-808063|title=Comic-Con: 'Salem' Renewed for Third Season|last=Goldberg|first=Lesley|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=July 11, 2015|accessdate=July 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It began production on January 21, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/shanewest/status/690236349631328257|title=Shane West on Twitter: "First day of work.

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
Critical reaction to ''Salem'' has been mixed to positive, scoring 49 out of 100, based on 16 critic reviews, on [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/salem |title=Salem – Season 1 |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=CBS |accessdate=June 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the first season scored 54%, with an average rating of 5.5 out of 10 based on 26 critic reviews, although 81% of audiences enjoyed the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/salem/s01/ |title=Salem: Season 1 |publisher=[[Flixster]] |work=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=June 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neil Genzlinger of the New York Times, upon reviewing the first season, said the show is "brash and well executed... perversely entertaining".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/18/arts/television/salem-about-you-know-what-on-wgn-america.html?_r=0|title=Once Again, Fires Burn and Cauldrons Bubble: ‘Salem,’ About You-Know-What, on WGN America|last=Genzlinger|first=Neil|publisher=New York Times|date=April 27, 2014|accessdate=January 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to say that "when 'Salem' isn’t being deliberately outrageous, it's cultivating a dynamic that could be fruitful as things move along. Here in the 21st century, science and reason rule, but in a world of sorcery, clinging to rationality just makes you stupid." Mark Dawidziak of Plain Dealer gave the first few episodes a positive review, saying "Slowly drawing you into its heightened version of that Puritan community, 'Salem' casts its spell with an opening episode that is a witch's brew of romance, fear, deceit, revenge, hysteria, evil and uncertainty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/tv-blog/index.ssf/2014/04/salem_casts_eerie_spell_with_story_about_witches.html|title='Salem' casts an eerie spell with its story about witches|last=Dawidziak|first=Mark|publisher=Cleveland Plain Dealer|date=April 18, 2014|accessdate=January 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4426">{{for|the film based on this term|The Spanish Prisoner}}

The '''Spanish Prisoner''' is a [[confidence trick]] originating in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=980CE5D71638E433A25753C2A9659C94699ED7CF |title= AN OLD SWINDLE REVIVED.; The "Spanish Prisoner" and Buried Treasure Bait Again Being Offered to Unwary Americans |work= [[The New York Times]] |date= 20 March 1898 |page= 12 | accessdate= 2010-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In its original form, the confidence trickster tells his victim (the ''mark'') that he is (or is in correspondence with) a wealthy person of high estate who has been imprisoned in Spain under a false identity. Some versions had the imprisoned person being an unknown or remote relative of the mark.&lt;ref name=NETZHYPES&gt;{{cite news|title=100 Jahre alte Web-Phänomene Diese Netz-Hypes sind älter als das Internet|url=http://www.spiegel.de/fotostrecke/von-planking-bis-lolcats-internet-hypes-und-ihre-vorlaeufer-fotostrecke-110222-22.html|accessdate=17 April 2017|newspaper=[[Spiegel Online]], einestages feature|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supposedly the prisoner cannot reveal his identity without serious repercussions, and is relying on a friend (the confidence trickster) to raise money to secure his release.&lt;ref name=NETZHYPES/&gt; In this classic [[pigeon drop]] game archetype, the confidence trickster offers to let the mark put up some of the funds, with a promise of a greater monetary reward upon release of the prisoner plus a non-pecuniary incentive, gaining the hand of a beautiful woman represented to be the prisoner's daughter. After the mark has turned over the funds, he is informed further difficulties have arisen, and more money is needed. With such explanations, the trickster continues to press for more money until the victim is cleaned out, or declines to put up more funds.

==Characteristics==
Key features of the Spanish Prisoner trick are the emphasis on secrecy and the trust the confidence trickster apparently places in the mark not to reveal the prisoner's identity or situation. The confidence trickster will typically claim to have chosen the mark carefully, based on his reputation for honesty and straight dealing, and may appear to structure the deal so that the confidence trickster's ultimate share of the reward will be distributed voluntarily by the mark.

==Modern variants==
Modern variants of the Spanish Prisoner fraud include the [[advance-fee scam]], in particular the [[Nigerian money transfer fraud|Nigerian money transfer]] (or 419) scam.&lt;ref name=NETZHYPES/&gt; In the advance-fee fraud, a valuable item must be ransomed from a [[warehouse]], crooked customs agent, or lost-baggage facility before the authorities or thieves recognize its value. In the Nigerian variation, a self-proclaimed relative of a deposed African dictator offers to transfer millions of ill-gotten dollars into the bank account of the victim in return for small initial payments to cover bribes and other expenses. More recent examples feature people sharing the same surname as the intended victim, with the scammer guessing the surname from observing patterns in e-mail addresses, or obtaining full names from harvested email headers. Another variation spreads via hijacked [[Facebook]] accounts, where a message is sent to all the Facebook friends of the victim, claiming that the victim is in a foreign country, has been robbed, and needs one of the Facebook friends to "send money" via [[Western Union]] to pay hotel and travel bills.{{cn|date=February 2014}}

The '''State Committee on the State of Emergency''' ({{Lang-rus|Госуда́рственный комите́т по чрезвыча́йному положе́нию|r=Gosudárstvenny komitét po chrezvycháynomu polozhéniyu|p=ɡəsʊˈdarstvʲɪn(ː)ɨj kəmʲɪˈtʲet pə tɕrʲɪzvᵻtɕˈæjnəmʊ pəlɐˈʐɛnʲɪjʊ}}), abbreviated as SCSE ({{Lang-rus|ГКЧП|r=GKChP}}), was a group of eight high-level [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] officials within the [[Government of the Soviet Union|Soviet government]], the [[CPSU|Communist Party]], and the [[KGB]], who attempted a [[August Coup of 1991|coup d'état]] against [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] on 19 August 1991. American publicist Georges Obolensky also called it the '''Gang of Eight'''.&lt;ref&gt;

|quote=[...] a group of military brass and Communist Party hardliners, calling themselves the 'State Emergency Committee,' (later to be known as 'the gang of eight') attempted a coup d'état. 
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 
The coup ultimately failed, with the provisional government collapsing by 22 August 1991 and several of the conspirators being prosecuted by the [[Supreme Court of the Russian Federation]].

==Members==
The eight members were:
*[[Gennady Yanayev]] (1937–2010), Vice President
*[[Valentin Pavlov]] (1937–2003), [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Premier]]
*[[Boris Pugo]] (1937–1991), Interior Minister
*[[Dmitry Yazov]] (b. 1924), [[Minister of Defence (Soviet Union)|Defense Minister]] and [[Marshal of the Soviet Union]]
*[[Vladimir Kryuchkov]] (1924–2007), [[List of Chairmen of the KGB|Chairman]] of the [[KGB]]
*[[Oleg Baklanov]] (b. 1932), First Deputy Chairman of the Defense Council of the USSR
*[[Vasily Starodubtsev]] (1931–2011), Chairman of the Peasants' Union of the USSR
*{{Interlanguage link multi|Alexander Tizyakov|ru|3=Тизяков, Александр Иванович|lt=Alexander Tizyakov}} (b. 1926), President of the Association of State Enterprises

Pugo committed [[suicide]] via gunshot to avoid arrest, while the other seven members were arrested.

==Coup d'état==
{{main|1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt}}

The [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt]], occurring between 19–21 August 1991, was an attempt by the Gang of Eight to take control of the country from then [[President of the Soviet Union]], Mikhail Gorbachev. The Gang of Eight were [[hard-line]] members of the Communist Party ([[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU]]) who were opposed to Gorbachev's reform program and the [[Union of Sovereign States|new union treaty]] he had negotiated, which dispersed much of the central government's power to the republics. The coup collapsed after only two days, and although Gorbachev was restored as President, his authority was irreparably damaged and he became less influential outside of Moscow. The event destabilized the Soviet Union and many speculate that it played a role in both the demise of the CPSU and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]]. After the coup failed, the seven living members of the Gang of Eight were arrested.

==Court trials==
On December 15, 1992, over a year after the attempted coup, the Prosecutor General sent the criminal case against the Gang of Eight to the Military Collegiate of the [[Supreme Court of the Russian Federation]]. Anatoliy Ukolov, a deputy chairman of the Collegiate, was charged with reviewing the case, and the hearing was scheduled for 26 January 1993. The defendants included the aforementioned seven living members of the group plus [[Oleg Shenin]] (1937–2009), Politbureau and secretariat member; [[Anatoly Lukyanov]] (b. 1930), Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union; and [[Valentin Varennikov]] (1923–2009), General of the Army, Deputy Minister of Defense, and Commander of Land Forces.

The trials lasted more than ten months, from 14 April 1993 until 1 March 1994. They were open to the public and press; however, foreign press did not participate due to lack of space in the courtroom. A prosecution commission was assigned to the case by the Collegiate, consisting of nine people and headed by Denisov, a Deputy Prosecutor General. The defense attorneys, Genri Reznik (Shenin), Genrikh Padva, Yuriy Ivanov (Kryuchkov), and Dmitriy Shteinberg (Varennikov) were hired, but in total, there were seventeen defense attorneys. After various delay tactics staged by the defense, the trial began on 30 November 1993. The main prosecutors were Yazov, Kryuchkov, Shenin, and Varennikov.

On 23 February 1994, the [[State Duma]] issued an amnesty to the defense, and on 1 March 1994, the case was closed with all ten defendants accepting [[amnesty]]. Varennikov requested amnesty on the condition that Mikhail Gorbachev would be the next to be prosecuted, as he accused Gorbachev of creating the recent political disorder. The court rejected his petition, and upon Varennikov sending his request to the Prosecutor General's office, it was rejected again.

Ten days after the close, the Presidium of the Supreme Court revived the [[prosecution]], ruling that procedural infringements regarding the amnesty had occurred. The Presidium arranged a new hearing and assigned a new judge, Viktor Aleksandrovich Yaskin. He conducted the case review using revised court procedures. Yaskin offered the defendants amnesty, and all but Varennikov accepted it. Varennikov was acquitted on the argument that he was following the orders of [[Minister of Defence (Soviet Union)|Minister of Defense]].

Kryuchkov, Yazov, Shenin, and Pavlov were named as the main conspirators.

==Further fate of GKChP members==
Pugo committed suicide, together with his wife. However, some sources speculate that he may have been murdered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2001/08/17/019.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010905011525/http://www.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2001/08/17/019.html |archivedate=September 5, 2001 |title=The Men Who Tried to Topple Mikhail Gorbachev |publisher=The Moscow Times |date=August 17, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yazov spent 18 months in [[Matrosskaya Tishina]], a prison in northern [[Moscow]]. According to the magazine "Vlast" No. 41(85) of 14 October 1991, he contacted the President from jail with a recorded video message, in which he repented and called himself "an old fool". Yazov denies ever doing that, and he also accepted the amnesty offered by the Russians stating that he was not guilty. He was dismissed from military service by the Presidential Order, and at his discharge, was awarded a ceremonial weapon. He was also awarded an order of honor by the [[President of Russian Federation]]. Yazov works as a military adviser at the [[General Staff Academy (Russia)|General Staff Academy]].

Varennikov spent 18 months in Matrosskaya Tishina, refused to accept the offered amnesty, and was eventually found not guilty to the Russians. Prior to the formation of the Gang of Eight, Varennikov participated in the [[January Events (Lithuania)|January Events]], an attempt to capture the TV-station in [[Vilnius]], Lithuania. According to Gorbachev's aide, [[Anatoly Chernyaev]], Varennikov personally made the decision to use force against the Lithuanians, without discussion with the President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ng.ru/ideas/2006-07-03/9_ussr.html |script-title=ru:Деньги и судьба империи |publisher=Независимая газета |date=June 3, 2006|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Varennikov was a people's deputy, starting in 1995 and until his death. In 2008, he publicly stated that the military force used during the 1991 coup attempt was intended for security purposes, including the protection of [[Boris Yeltsin|Yeltsin]]. Varennikov died in 2009 and was buried in Moscow.

Baklanov spent 18 months in Matrosskaya Tishina, and then accepted amnesty in 1994, stating that he was not guilty. He later worked as a director of ''Rosobshchemash''.

Yanayev spent 18 months in Matrosskaya Tishina. He later became a chairman of the department of national history at the Russian International Academy of Tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://versia.ru/articles/2008/oct/31/gennadiy_yanaev |script-title=ru:Бывший вице-президент СССР Геннадий Янаев: Ручонки действительно подрагивали |publisher=Версия |date=October 31, 2008|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pavlov had been taken to a hospital during the coup with the diagnosis of [[hypertension]], but on 29 August 1991, he was transferred to Matrosskaya Tishina. He accepted amnesty stating that he was not guilty, and later became the head of the Chasprombank. Pavlov resigned from the bank on 31 August 1995, and six months later the bank was left without license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.banki.ru/banks/memory/bank/?id=80976 |script-title=ru:Книга памяти: "Часпромбанк" |publisher=Банки.ру|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards he was an adviser at Promstroibank, today known as [[VTB|Bank VTB]]. Pavlov died in 2003 after a series of heart attacks and was buried in Moscow.

===Evaluations of Ukolov's interviews===
According to [[VID (company)|Vzglyad]], Anatoliy Ukolov, the original person charged with the prosecution of the Gang of Eight, blamed the occurrence of the 1991 coup attempt on Gorbachev, implying that the leader should not have taken a vacation at the time. However, in an interview with Komsomol Pravda, Ukolov also mentioned how the members of GKChP chose not to follow the [[Letter and spirit of the law|letter of law]], but rather to take the situation into their own hands.

[[File:Defense.gov News Photo 970404-N-0000N-001.jpg|thumb|right|''Kapitan Man'' on 4 April 1997]]
On 4 April 1997, a [[Canadian Armed Forces]] helicopter was allegedly [[lasers and aviation safety|illuminated by a laser]] while observing the Russian [[merchant ship]] and suspected [[spy ship|spy vessel]] ''[[Kapitan Man]]'', which was in the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]] in U.S. territorial waters near [[Port Angeles, Washington]]. The [[Canadian Air Force]] pilot and the [[U.S. Navy]] passenger, who was taking photographs of the ship, reportedly suffered eye pain and injuries consistent with laser exposure. However, subsequent investigations into the incident were unable to verify that any lasing had occurred.

==Background==
Responding to a request based on previous suspicious activity of the ''Kapitan Man'', the [[Canadian Forces]] dispatched a [[CH-124]] helicopter to fly by the ship and take photographs of it and its abnormal aerial [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] structure, which was indicative of a ship that could be conducting [[ELINT]] or [[SIGINT]] activities. The [[U.S. Coast Guard]] had previously confiscated submarine surveillance equipment from the ship in 1993.&lt;ref name="AP 97" /&gt; At the time of the incident, the ''Kapitan Man'' was {{convert|5|nmi|0}} north of [[Port Angeles, Washington]] i.e. inside U.S. territorial waters.&lt;ref name="HASC 99" /&gt;

On board the aircraft were [[U.S. Navy]] Lieutenant Jack Daly and [[Canadian Forces]] pilot Captain Patrick Barnes. Lt. Daly was the Navy's [[foreign-intelligence]] [[liaison officer]] in [[Esquimalt, British Columbia]], heading a joint U.S.-Canadian helicopter-surveillance operation against Russian, Chinese, and other [[spy ship]]s operating in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, which separates the Canadian province of [[British Columbia]] from the U.S. state of [[Washington (state)|Washington]], and in [[Puget Sound]], the site of major U.S. [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]] [[ballistic missile submarine]] and [[aircraft carrier]] bases with the Royal Canadian Navy Pacific Fleet Headquarters in Esquimalt Harbour near Victoria, B.C.

==Laser damage==
While taking photographs of the ship and its [[bridge (ship)|bridge]], Lt. Daly suddenly experienced intense pain in his right eye as well as temporary blindness. After examination, it was concluded that Daly suffered direct [[laser]] burns to his right eye, as well as other vision problems and severe headaches.{{Citation needed |date=August 2014}} Daly testified that Capt. Barnes was also injured in a similar manner and was permanently grounded as a result of this incident, he has since lost all his [[pilot licensing and certification|flight qualifications]].&lt;ref name="HASC 99"/&gt; A United States Army Medical Research Department analysis indicated that the crew was most likely hit with a [[Nd:YAG laser]].{{Citation needed |date=August 2014}}

In February 1999, Daly testified before the U.S. House Armed Services Committee about his experience.&lt;ref name="AP 97"&gt;{{cite news |title=Navy Officer Blames Russian Laser |url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1999/Navy-Officer-Blames-Russian-Laser/id-70804cac00b84d4533ff12067869b0cd |accessdate=27 May 2013 |newspaper=AP News Archive |date=12 February 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that he and Capt. Barnes both had extreme sensitivity to sunlight and light sources. Driving at night became impossible as did watching movies or night ball games: "The only form of even momentary relief that either one of us can rely on is sitting in the dark with our eyes closed,  yet lately even that does not seem to help much."&lt;ref name="HASC 99"&gt;{{cite web |title=Statement of Lt.

==''Kapitan Man'' search==
Shortly after the incident, [[U.S. Coast Guard]] teams were given two hours to search the vessel but did not locate a laser. Teams were not given full access to the ship, however, and the [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] administration had warned the Russian government in advance the ship would be searched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.papillonsartpalace.com/navyman.htm |title=Navy Man Clinton Hung Out To Dry Gets His Day in Court |publisher=Papillonsartpalace.com |accessdate=7 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803005723/http://www.papillonsartpalace.com/navyman.htm |archivedate=3 August 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuit and Purple Heart request==

In October 2002, Daly sued the Russian [[Far East Shipping Company]] (FESCO), owner of the ''Kapitan Man'', in federal court. In his opening statement, Daly's lawyer laid out their side of the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Opening Statement |url=http://www.judicialwatch.org/cases/77/openstatement.htm |accessdate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's lawyer countered that there was no positive evidence of a laser on the ship. The jury deliberated for a day and ruled that the laser attack could not be linked to FESCO.  Daly's lawyer told the press that the case was hampered by U.S. government resistance and unfavorable rulings by the judge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Navy officer loses suit against Russians |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2002/oct/19/20021019-093035-6314r/ |accessdate=25 May 2013 |newspaper=The Washington Times |date=19 October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Navy Man Loses Laser Lawsuit |url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/2002/Navy-Man-Loses-Laser-Lawsuit/id-7948823ff9caabd508ada72ecf49a4ff |accessdate=27 May 2013 |newspaper=AP News Archive |date=21 October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2004, the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] denied an Inspector General's recommendation that Daly be awarded the [[Purple Heart]] (for wounds sustained by opposing forces). Part of the CNO's rejection stated:

{{quote|In summary, even assuming that the injuries were indeed caused by a laser aimed from the Russian-flagged merchant vessel ''Kapitan Man'', there is no basis to declare that ship a hostile force or the incident a terrorist act.... [W]hile we regret any injuries Lt. Cmdr. Daly sustained while in service to his country, the facts of this case do not support an award of the Purple Heart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Navy turns down appeal for award |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2004/sep/23/20040923-114729-8717r/?page=all |accessdate=25 May 2013 |newspaper=The Washington Times |date=23 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Clinical assessment==
{{Over-quotation |date=August 2014}}
The case was analyzed in the August 2004 ''[[Archives of Ophthalmology]]'' by medical laser researchers including Dr. Bruce Stuck, then Director of the U.S. Army Medical Research Detachment of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, responsible for the Army Medical Department's laser and radio frequency radiation biological effects research program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ICNERP Members' Biographical Information |url=http://www.icnirp.org/cv.htm |accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the analysis of "Case 5" did not explicitly state Daly's name or the military nature of the ship photography, the case description is clearly that of the Strait of Juan de Fuca laser incident.

The researchers noted the photographer's (Daly's) case history:
{{quote|A retina specialist found 3 tiny (10- to 20-μm) [[Retinal pigment epithelium|RPE]] window defects in one eye on a [[Fluorescein angiography|fluorescein angiogram]] and ascribed them to laser injury. Findings from [[optical coherence tomography]] were normal. [[Amsler grid]] test results were highly variable, and the locations of grid abnormalities and RPE defects were inconsistent.... New RPE defects developed after the incident. The photographer had not been diagnosed previously as having reactive arthritis ([[Reiter syndrome]]), which can produce small RPE defects.... No evidence of laser injury was found in the years after the incident by 17 other ophthalmologists, including 5 neuro-ophthalmalogists and 8 retina specialists. A trial was held five years after the incident in which the retina specialist who made the initial diagnosis steadfastly maintained all the photographer's symptoms were due to retinal laser injury. A jury ruled against the photographer's claim for damages against the ship's owner.}}

The Analysis section of the article stated:

The '''Tanjung Priok massacre''' was an incident that occurred in the port area of [[Tanjung Priok]], [[North Jakarta]], Indonesia in 1984. Government reports give a total of 24 killed and 54 injured, while survivors report over a hundred killed.

==Background==
On 10 September 1984, Sergeant Hermanu,&lt;ref&gt;http://print.kompas.com/baca/2015/06/26/Sudah-Saling-Memaafkan&lt;/ref&gt; a member of the Community Advisory Non-Commissioned Officer  ({{lang|id|Bintara Pembina Desa}}) arrived at As Saadah Mosque in [[Tanjung Priok]], North Jakarta, and told the caretaker, Amir Biki, to remove brochures and banners critical of the government.{{sfn|Junge|2008|p=17}} Biki refused this demand, upon which point Hermanu removed them himself; to do so, he reportedly entered the prayer area of the mosque without removing his shoes (a serious violation of mosque etiquette).{{sfn|Junge|2008|p=17}}{{sfn|Haryanto 2010, Death Toll From 1984 Massacre}} In response, local residents, led by mosque caretakers Syarifuddin Rambe and Sofwan Sulaeman, burned his motorcycle and attacked Hermanu while he was talking with another officer.{{sfn|Junge|2008|p=17}}{{sfn|Haryanto 2010, Death Toll From 1984 Massacre}} The two then arrested Rambe and Sulaeman, as well as another caretaker, Achmad Sahi, and an unemployed man named Muhamad Noor.{{sfn|Junge|2008|p=17}}{{sfn|Haryanto 2010, Death Toll From 1984 Massacre}}{{sfn|The Jakarta Post 2009, Victims 'may not}}

==Incident==
Two days after the arrest, Islamic cleric Abdul Qodir Jaelani gave a sermon against [[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]] at As Saadah mosque.{{sfn|Haryanto 2010, Death Toll From 1984 Massacre}} Afterwards, Biki led a protest to the District Military Command office for North Jakarta, where the four prisoners were being held.{{sfn|Junge|2008|p=17}}{{sfn|Haryanto 2010, Death Toll From 1984 Massacre}} Along the way, the group's numbers swelled, with estimates ranging between 1,500 and several thousand.{{sfn|Junge|2008|p=17}}{{sfn|Haryanto 2010, Death Toll From 1984 Massacre}} Also during the trip, nine members of a Muslim [[Chinese Indonesian]] family headed by Tan Kioe Liem were killed by the protestors.{{sfn|The Jakarta Post 2000, FPI members attacks}}{{sfn|Setiono|2008|p=1057}} The family's store, a pharmacy, was burned to the ground.{{sfn|Setiono|2008|p=1057}}

Once at the military command, the group unsuccessfully demanded the release of the prisoners.{{sfn|Junge|2008|p=17}} At roughly 11 p.m. [[Time in Indonesia|local time]] (UTC+7), the protestors surrounded the military command.{{sfn|Haryanto 2010, Death Toll From 1984 Massacre}} Military personnel from the 6th Air Defence Artillery Battalion opened fire on the protestors.{{sfn|Junge|2008|p=17}}{{sfn|The Jakarta Post 2009, Victims report to UN}} Around midnight, eyewitnesses saw military commander of Jakarta [[Try Sutrisno]] and Chief of the Armed Forces [[Leonardus Benjamin Moerdani]] supervising the removal of the victims; the corpses were loaded into military trucks and buried in unmarked graves, while the wounded were sent to Gatot Soebroto Military Hospital.{{sfn|Junge|2008|p=18}}

==Aftermath==
After the riots, the military reported that they had been triggered by a man in a fake military uniform who distributed anti-government pamphlets along with 12 other accomplices; it reported having the man in custody.{{sfn|The New York Times 1984, Around the World;}} General [[Hartono Rekso Dharsono]] was arrested for allegedly inciting the riots.{{sfn|Erlanger 1990, Jakarta Journal; Echoes}}  After a four-month trial, he was convicted; he was eventually released in September 1990, after serving five-years jail time.{{sfn|Erlanger 1990, Jakarta Journal; Echoes}}

After the riots, at least 169 civilians were allegedly held without warrant.{{sfn|Taufiqurrahman 2004, I was tortured}} Some were reportedly tortured.{{sfn|Taufiqurrahman 2004, I was tortured}} The leaders were arrested and tried for subversion, then given long sentences when convicted.{{sfn|Haryanto 2010, Death Toll From 1984 Massacre}} Others, including as Amir Biki, were among those killed.{{sfn|Junge|2008|p=18}}

Initial reports suggested 20 dead.{{sfn|The New York Times 1984, Around the World;}} Current official records give a total of 24 killed and 54 injured (including the military), while survivors report over a hundred killed.{{sfn|Khalik 2008, Govt slammed for human}} Tanjung Priok residents estimate a total of 400 killed or missing, while other reports suggest up to 700 victims.{{sfn|Junge|2008|p=18}}{{sfn|The Jakarta Post 2009, Victims report to UN}}

==Investigation==
With the influx of human rights movements after the [[fall of Suharto]] in 1998, several groups were created to advocate for the rights of the victims, including the {{nowrap|12 September}} 1984 Foundation, the National Solidarity for the 1984 Tanjung Priok Incident ({{lang|id|Solidaritas Nastional untuk Peristiwa Tanjung Priok 1984}}), and the Extended Family for Victims of the Tanjung Priok Incident ({{lang|id|Keluarga Besar Korban Peristiwa Tanjung Priok}}; founded by Biki's widow Dewi Wardah and son Beni).{{sfn|Junge|2008|p=18}} These groups pushed for the [[People's Representative Council]] (DPR) and [[National Commission on Human Rights (Indonesia)|National Commission on Human Rights]] (Komnas HAM) to further investigate the massacre; inside the DPR, representatives A.W. Fatwa and Abdul Qodir Jaelani, both previously arrested after the massacre, pressed for further investigation.{{sfn|Junge|2008|p=20}} In 1999, Komnas HAM agreed to investigate the incident, forming the Commission for the Investigation and Examination of Human Rights Violations in Tanjung Priok (KP3T).{{sfn|Junge|2008|p=20}}

The KP3T consisted mainly of political figures from the [[New Order (Indonesia)|previous regime]], including former prosecutor general Djoko Sugianto.{{sfn|Junge|2008|p=21}} The resulting report, released in early June 2000, found that there had been no systematic massacre in the incident.{{sfn|Junge|2008|p=21}} This was not well received by the general public. On 23 June 2000, approximately 300 members of the [[Islamic Defenders Front]] (FPI) attacked the headquarters of Komnas HAM while dressed in white [[Islamic clothing]] and green scarves.{{sfn|The Jakarta Post 2000, FPI members attacks}} They broke windows with stones and [[rattan]] sticks, outnumbering and overwhelming the security forces.{{sfn|The Jakarta Post 2000, FPI members attacks}} The FPI was upset at the commission's report on the massacre and perceived collusion with the military, arguing that it had ignored actions by the military; it insisted that the commission be abolished.{{sfn|The Jakarta Post 2000, FPI members attacks}} Meanwhile, [[List of ministers of law and human rights of Indonesia|Minister of Law and Human Rights]] [[Yusril Ihza Mahendra]] wrote that Komnas HAM had seemingly applied double standards when investigating the issue; he said that they seemed more reluctant to investigate the Tanjung Priok incident then they had been in investigating the [[1999 East Timorese crisis]].{{sfn|Junge|2008|p=21}} [[Crescent Star Party (Indonesia)|Crescent Star Party]] leader Ahmad Sumargono called the verdict a disappointment to Muslims everywhere.{{sfn|Junge|2008|p=21}}

In October 2000, Komnas HAM released another report indicating that 23 individuals, including Sutrisno and Moerdani, should be investigated for their involvement; it called for an ''[[ad hoc]]'' tribunal to look into the matter further.{{sfn|Junge|2008|p=21}} With President [[Abdurrahman Wahid]] calling for further investigation and the impending tribunal, several military officials made contracts of forgiveness (''islah'') with victims' families; although the islah did not contain admissions of guilt, it did provide for victims to receive a lump sum of [[Indonesian Rupiah|Rp.]] 1.5-2 million (US$200–250).{{sfn|Junge|2008|p=22}} The first islah covered 86 families, as represented by Rambe, while the second covered Biki's family; by 1 March 2001 a number of islah had been made.{{sfn|Junge|2008|p=22}} As a result of the islah, several victims or their families, suggested to investigator M.A. Rachman that charges be dropped.{{sfn|Junge|2008|p=23}} However, investigation continued, wrapping up in July 2003.{{sfn|KontraS, Massacre of Tanjung Priok}}

Under international pressure, in 2003 the DPR approved the use of the 2000 human rights law to bring perpetrators of the massacre to trial for crimes against humanity;{{sfn|Khalik 2008, Govt slammed for human}}{{sfn|Saraswati 2003, Tanjung Priok rights}} the trial began in September of that year.{{sfn|KontraS, Massacre of Tanjung Priok}} Those brought to trial included Colonel Sutrisno Mascung, leader of Platoon II of the Air Defense Artillery Battalion at the time, and 13 subordinates.{{sfn|Saraswati 2003, Tanjung Priok rights}} Higher-ranking officials from the time, including military commander of Jakarta [[Try Sutrisno]] and Chief of the Armed Forces [[Leonardus Benjamin Moerdani]], were exempted from prosecution, as were former President [[Suharto]] and former Minister of Justice [[Ismail Saleh]].{{sfn|Saraswati 2003, Tanjung Priok rights}}{{sfn|The Jakarta Post 2003, Soeharto blamed}} The prosecution was led by Widodo Supriyadi, and Deputy Speaker of the DPR A.M. Fatwa served as a witness for the prosecution.{{sfn|Taufiqurrahman 2004, I was tortured}}{{sfn|The Jakarta Post 2003, Court urged to pursue}} Several officers prosecuted were convicted, while Sriyanto and Pranowo were acquitted.{{sfn|Haryanto 2010, Death Toll From 1984 Massacre}} In 2004 the Prosecutor General's office filed an appeal against the acquittals of Sriyanto and Pranowo, but were refused.{{sfn|Khalik 2008, Govt slammed for human}} The convictions were later overturned by the [[Supreme Court of Indonesia]].{{sfn|Haryanto 2010, Death Toll From 1984 Massacre}}

After the trial it came under fire from human rights groups; German author Fabian Junge argued that "prosecutors deliberately ignored substantial evidence while scare-tactics and bribery were rampant outside court".{{sfn|Khalik 2008, Govt slammed for human}} Approaching the 25th anniversary of the massacre, the victims, aided by the Human Rights Working Group and the Commission for Missing Persons and Victims of Violence, sent a letter to [[United Nations Special Rapporteur|UN Special Rapporteur]] on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers Gabriela Carina Knaul de Albuquerque e Silva imploring her to intervene in the case;{{sfn|The Jakarta Post 2009, Victims report to UN}} the survivors have also requested compensation in the amount of Rp1.015 billion (US$130,000) from the government for their "pain and loss".{{sfn|KontraS, Massacre of Tanjung Priok}}{{sfn|The Jakarta Post 2009, Victims 'may not}} Although victims and their representatives have asked President [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]] to further investigate the issue, {{as of|2011|lc=y}} the case has not come to closure.{{sfn|KontraS, Massacre of Tanjung Priok}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1119">'''Teatro Sant' Apollinare''' was an Italian public opera house established in 1651 in [[Venice]] in what is today Petriana Court. The Sant 'Apollinare was established in a residential building and equipped with advanced [[stage machinery]] intended to allow for spectacular stage shows. It was managed in 1651 by impessario and librettist [[Giovanni Faustini]], who died during the first run of his opera ''[[La Calisto]]'' there. After his death, his brother [[Marco Faustini]] took over management of the theater. It was dismantled in 1661 and the rooms returned to residential use.

The '''tyranny of small decisions''' is a phenomenon explored in an essay of the same name, published in 1966 by the American economist [[Alfred E. Kahn]].&lt;ref name="Kahn"&gt;Kahn, Alfred E. (1966) [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119726548/abstract "The tyranny of small decisions: market failures, imperfections, and the limits of economics"] ''Kyklos'', '''19''':23–47.&lt;/ref&gt; The article describes a situation in which a number of decisions, individually small in size and time perspective, cumulatively result in an outcome which is not optimal nor desired. It is a situation where a series of small, individually rational decisions can negatively change the context of subsequent choices, even to the point where desired alternatives are irreversibly destroyed. Kahn described the problem as a common issue in [[market economics]] which can lead to [[market failure]].&lt;ref name="Kahn" /&gt; The concept has since been extended to areas other than economic ones, such as [[environmental degradation]],&lt;ref name=Odum /&gt; political elections&lt;ref&gt;Burnell, P (2002) [https://www.jstor.org/pss/3993565 "Zambia's 2001 Elections: the Tyranny of Small Decisions, Non-decisions and 'Not Decisions'"] ''Third World Quarterly'', '''23'''(3): 1103–1120.

&lt;/ref&gt;

A classic example of the tyranny of small decisions is the [[tragedy of the commons]], described by [[Garrett Hardin]] in 1968&lt;ref name=hardin68&gt;Garrett Hardin, [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/162/3859/1243 "The Tragedy of the Commons"], ''Science'', Vol. 162, No. 3859 (December 13, 1968), pp. 1243–1248. Also available [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/162/3859/1243.pdf here] and [http://www.garretthardinsociety.org/articles/art_tragedy_of_the_commons.html here.]&lt;/ref&gt; as a situation where a number of herders graze cows on a commons. The herders each act independently in what they perceive to be their own rational self-interest, ultimately depleting their shared limited resource, even though it is clear that it is not in any herder's long-term interest for this to happen.&lt;ref&gt;Baylis J, Wirtz JJ, Cohen EA and Gray CS (2007) [https://books.google.com/books?id=1akfkqhO_m0C&amp;pg=PT368&amp;lpg=PT368&amp;dq=%22Tyranny+of+small+decisions%22+%22tragedy+of+the+commons%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hu5UiZN-IM&amp;sig=OaPxuPF9rduZXyaqFJWfVRNXdBQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nbt7S5D-EMGTkAXo3aW8BA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CBEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Tyranny%20of%20small%20decisions%22%20%22tragedy%20of%20the%20commons%22&amp;f=false ''Strategy in the contemporary world: an introduction to strategic studies''] Page 368.

==Ithaca railroad==
[[File:Twin Glens abutment.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Abutment of the [[Ithaca-Auburn Short Line]] bridge ]]

The event that first suggested the tyranny of small decisions to Kahn was the withdrawal of passenger railway services in [[Ithaca, New York]]. The railway was the only reliable way to get in and out of Ithaca. It provided services regardless of conditions, in fair weather and foul, during peak seasons and off-peak seasons. The local airline and bus company skimmed the traffic when conditions were favourable, leaving the trains to fill in when conditions were difficult. The railway service was eventually withdrawn, because the collective individual decisions made by travellers did not provide the railway with the revenue it needed to cover its incremental costs. According to Kahn, this suggests a hypothetical economic test of whether the service should have been withdrawn.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Suppose each person in the cities served were to ask himself how much he would have been willing to pledge regularly over some time period, say annually, by purchase of prepaid tickets, to keep rail passenger service available to his community. As long as the amount that he would have declared (to himself) would have exceeded what he actually paid on the period–and my own introspective experiment shows that it would–then to that extent the disappearance of the passenger service was an incident of market failure.&lt;ref name=Kahn2&gt;Kahn AE (1988) [https://books.google.com/books?id=x01ew7Emw0MC&amp;pg=RA1-PA237&amp;lpg=RA1-PA237&amp;dq=%22Kahn%22+%22The+tyranny+of+small+decisions%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Mzhp2bdJFJ&amp;sig=YPQqdVYSM8q2zTvF5K-I9Zv4EKw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_uB5S5vsFJiekQWSmaj5Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=16&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwDw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Kahn%22%20%22The%20tyranny%20of%20small%20decisions%22&amp;f=false ''The economics of regulation: principles and institutions''] Volume 1, pp 237–238. MIT Press. {{ISBN|978-0-262-61052-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The failure to reflect the full value to passengers of keeping the railroad service available had its origins in the discrepancy between the time perception within which the travellers were operating, and the time perception within which the railroad was operating. The travellers were making many short term decisions, deciding each particular trip whether to go by the railroad, or whether to go instead by car, bus or the local airline. Based on the cumulative effects of these small decisions, the railroad was making one major long run decision, "virtually all-or-nothing and once-and-for-all"; whether to retain or abandon its passenger service. Taken one at a time, each small travel decision made individually by the travellers had a negligible impact on the survivability of the railroad. It would not have been rational for a traveller to consider the survival of the railroad imperilled by any one of his particular decisions.&lt;ref name=Kahn2 /&gt;
  
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The fact remains that each selection of x over y constitutes also a vote for eliminating the ''possibility thereafter of choosing y''. If enough people vote for x, each time necessarily on the assumption that y will continue to be available, y may in fact disappear. And its disappearance may constitute a genuine deprivation, which customers might willingly have paid something to avoid. The only choice the market offered travellers to influence the longer-run decision of the railroad was thus shorter in its time perspective, and the sum total of our individual purchases of railroad tickets necessary added up to a smaller amount, than our actual combined interest in the continued availability of rail service. We were victims of the "tyranny of small decisions".&lt;ref name=Kahn2 /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Earlier references to the idea==
[[Thucydides]] ([[circa|c.]] 460–c. 395 [[BCE|BC]]) stated:
{{Quote
|[T]hey devote a very small fraction of time to the consideration of any public object, most of it to the prosecution of their own objects. Meanwhile each fancies that no harm will come to his neglect, that it is the business of somebody else to look after this or that for him; and so, by the same notion being entertained by all separately, the common cause imperceptibly decays.&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides (ca. 460 B.C.-ca. 395 B.C.), ''History of the Peloponnesian War'', Book I, Sec. 141; translated by [[Richard Crawley]] (London: J. M. Dent &amp; Sons; New York: E. P. Dutton &amp; Co., 1910).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC) similarly argued against common goods of the ''[[polis]]'' of [[History of Athens|Athens]]:
{{Quote
|For that which is common to the greatest number has the least care bestowed upon it. Every one thinks chiefly of his own, hardly at all of the common interest; and only when he is himself concerned as an individual. For besides other considerations, everybody is more inclined to neglect the duty which he expects another to fulfill; as in families many attendants are often less useful than a few.&lt;ref name=Aristotle&gt;Aristotle (350 [[B.C.E.]]), ''Politics,'' Book II, Chapter III, 1261b; translated by [[Benjamin Jowett]] as [http://oll.libertyfund.org/Texts/Aristotle0039/Politics/HTMLs/0033-01_Pt02_Books1-4.html ''The Politics of Aristotle: Translated into English with Introduction, Marginal Analysis, Essays, Notes and Indices''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070430130333/http://oll.libertyfund.org/Texts/Aristotle0039/Politics/HTMLs/0033-01_Pt02_Books1-4.html |date=2007-04-30 }} (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1885), Vol. 1 of 2.

[[Thomas Mun]] (1571–1641), an English [[mercantilist]], commented about decisions made with a myopic, small time perspective:
{{Quote
|[T]hey search no further than the beginning of the work, which mis-informs their judgements, and leads them into error:  For if we only behold the actions of the husbandman in the seed-time when he casteth away much good corn into the ground, we will rather account him a mad-man than a husbandman:  but when we consider his labours in the harvest which is the end of his endeavours, we find the worth and plentiful increase of his actions.&lt;ref&gt;Mun T (1664) [https://archive.org/stream/theoryofbalanceo00suviuoft/theoryofbalanceo00suviuoft_djvu.txt On obtaining a positive balance of trade by importing raw materials] Chapter in ''England's treasure by forraign trade''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk]] (1851–1914), an Austrian economist, observed that decisions made with small time perspectives can have a seductive quality:
{{Quote|
It occurs frequently, I believe, that a person is faced with a choice between a present and a future satisfaction or dissatisfaction and that he decides in favor of lesser present pleasure even though he knows perfectly well, and is even explicitly aware at the moment he makes his choice, that the future disadvantage is the greater and that therefore his well-being, on the whole, suffers by reason of his choice.  The "playboy" squanders his whole month's allowance in the first few days on frivolous dissipation.  How clearly he anticipates his later embarrassment and deprivation!  And yet he is unable to resist the temptations of the moment.&lt;ref&gt;Capital and Interest by Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk London: Macmillan and Co. 1890, trans. William A. Smart, 1890.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Environmental degradation==
{{single source|section|date=March 2018}}
[[File:Jones River marshland near mouth.JPG|thumb|As a result of many small decisions, and without the issue being directly addressed, nearly half the [[marshland]]s were destroyed along the coasts of Connecticut and Massachusetts.]]

In 1982, the [[estuarine]] ecologist, William Odum, published a paper where he extended the notion of the tyranny of small decisions to environmental issues. According to Odum, "much of the current confusion and distress surrounding environmental issues can be traced to decisions that were never consciously made, but simply resulted from a series of small decisions."&lt;ref name=Odum&gt;Odum WE (1982) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1308718 "Environmental degradation and the tyranny of small decisions"] ''BioScience'', '''32'''(9):728–729.&lt;/ref&gt;

Odum cites, as an example, the [[marshland]]s along the coasts of Connecticut and Massachusetts. Between 1950 and 1970, almost 50 percent of these marshlands were destroyed. This was not purposely planned, and the public may well have supported preservation had they been asked.  Instead, hundreds of small tracts of marshland were converted to other purposes through hundreds of small decisions, resulting in a major outcome without the overall issue ever being directly addressed.&lt;ref name=Odum /&gt;

Another example is the [[Florida Everglades]]. These have been threatened, not by a single unfavorable decision, but by many independent pin prick decisions, such as decisions to add this well, that drainage canal, one more retirement village, another roadway...  No explicit decision was made to restrict the flow of surface water into the glades, or to encourage hot, destructive fires and intensify droughts, yet this has been the outcome.&lt;ref name=Odum /&gt;

With few exceptions, [[threatened species|threatened]] and [[endangered species]] owe their predicament to series of small decisions. [[Polar bear]]s, [[humpback whale]]s and [[bald eagle]]s have suffered from the cumulative effects of single decisions to [[overexploit]] or convert habitats. The removal, one by one, of [[green turtle]] nesting beaches for other uses parallels the decline in green turtle populations.&lt;ref name=Odum /&gt;

Cultural lake [[eutrophication]] is rarely the result of an intentional decision. Instead, lakes eutrophy gradually as a cumulative effect of small decisions; the addition of this domestic sewage outfall and then that industrial outfall, with a runoff that increases steadily as this housing development is added, then that highway and some more agricultural fields.&lt;ref name=Odum /&gt; The insidious effects of small decisions marches on; productive land [[desertification|turns to desert]], groundwater resources are [[overexploitation|overexploited]] to the point where they can't recover, persistent pesticides are used and  [[Deforestation|tropical forests are cleared]] without factoring in the cumulative consequences.&lt;ref name=Odum /&gt;

==Counters==
{{quote box
|width=260px|border= 1px |margin= 2px |align= right |bgcolor= #ffffff |qalign= left
|quote= Considering all of the pressures and short-term rewards that guide society toward simple solutions, it seems safe to assume that the "tyranny of small decisions" will be an integral part of environmental policy for a long time to come. – William Odum&lt;ref name=Odum /&gt;
}}

An obvious counter to the tyranny of small decisions is to develop and protect appropriate upper levels of decision making. Depending on the issue, decision-making may be appropriate at a local, state, country or global level. However, organisations at these levels can entangle themselves in their own bureaucracy and politics, assigning decisions by default back to the lower levels. Political and scientific systems can encourage small decisions by rewarding specific problems and solutions. It is usually easier and more politic to make decisions on individual tracts of land or single issues rather than implementing large-scale policies. The same pattern applies with academic science. Most scientists are more comfortable working on specific problems rather than systems. This reductionist tendency towards the small problems is reinforced in the way grant monies and academic tenure are assigned.&lt;ref name=Odum /&gt;

Odum advocates that at least some scientists should study systems so the negative consequences that result when many small decisions are made from a limited perspective can be avoided. There is a similar need for politicians and planners to understand large-scale perspectives.  [[Environmental science]] teachers should include large-scale processes in their courses, with examples of the problems that decision making at inappropriate levels can introduce.&lt;ref name=Odum /&gt;

In the summer of 1995, Scott Schoonover, with the support of the Arts Group of Union Avenue Christian Church and on a shoestring budget, mounted Union Avenue Opera Theatre's first production: [[Henry Purcell|Purcell]]’s ''[[Dido and Aeneas]]'', and since that time UAOT became an integral part of the St. Louis arts community.&lt;ref name=about&gt;UnionAvenueOpera.org [http://www.unionavenueopera.org/contact.php 'About Us']&lt;/ref&gt;  After two seasons of smaller productions from lesser known operatic repertoire, Artistic Director and Principal Conductor Schoonover produced a full-scale production of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''[[The Marriage of Figaro|Le nozze di Figaro]]'', sung in English, in 1998.  This production spurred increased audience attendance as well as a growing donor base.  Professional singers from beyond St. Louis took an interest in auditioning for the company as well, causing the company to expand its audition cities to Chicago, Kansas City, Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York City.&lt;ref&gt;YouTube.com, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEG3yZ4e_hY] Union Avenue Opera Theatre profile on ''Living St. Louis'' (KETC YouTube Channel)&lt;/ref&gt;  Early seasons featured operas either in English or foreign language works sung in the vernacular.  However, with its 2000 production of [[Giacomo Puccini]]'s ''[[La bohème]]'' sung in Italian, Union Avenue Opera Theatre began its ongoing practice of presenting opera in the original language with projected English [[supertitles]].&lt;ref&gt;Rix, Christian C., "Small Company Delivers Appealing ''La Bohème.''" ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'' 20 Aug 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1998 and 2003, Union Avenue Opera Theatre usually produced one to two full productions per summer along with a concert staging of an operetta.  For the company's 10th season in 2004, Schoonover expanded the season to three full productions in the summer.  It was also during this season that, as a nod to the company's inaugural season, ''Dido and Aeneas'' appeared once again in the repertory to critical acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Sarah Bryan, "Union Avenue Opera Celebrates 10th Season With Rags To Almost Riches Story." ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'' 20 Jun 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the company began offering off-season productions in October which focused on suspense-driven, "spooky" repertoire including [[Gian Carlo Menotti]]'s ''[[The Medium]]'', [[Benjamin Britten]]'s ''[[The Turn of the Screw (opera)|The Turn of the Screw]]'', [[Béla Bartók]]'s ''[[Bluebeard's Castle|Duke Bluebeard's Castle]]'' and [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]]'s ''[[Il tabarro]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Sarah Bryan, "Union Avenue ''Medium'' Has Good Points, Needs A Stage." ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'' 31 Oct 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schoonover also revealed major renovation plans between the company and Union Avenue Christian Church.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Sarah Bryan, "Director Has Big Plans For Union Avenue Opera." ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'' 16 Jul 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007 a new orchestra pit and expanded stage were constructed successfully completing UAO’s first capital campaign.  This renovation coincided with major improvements to the church sanctuary.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;Miller, Sarah Bryan, "Union Avenue Opera Puts Itself In A Hole ... A 6-Foot Orchestra Pit." ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'' 24 Jun 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

That season marked the welcoming of guest conductor Kostis Protopapas, of [[Tulsa Opera]], to conduct a double bill of ''[[Suor Angelica]]'' and ''[[Gianni Schicchi]]''.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt;  Protopapas has since returned to conduct productions of ''[[Otello]]'', ''[[Lakmé]]'' and ''[[La fille du régiment]]''. Capping off the 2007 season, Union Avenue Opera collaborated with [[The Black Repertory Theater]] of St. Louis to present [[George Gershwin]]'s ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'' in a staging by the Black Rep's founder and producing director Ron Himes. At the start of the 2008 season, Schoonover imported a production of [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]]'s ''[[L'elisir d'amore|L'Elisir d'Amore]]'' in 2008 as a shared production with Elgin Opera and [[Muddy River Opera Company]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Sarah Bryan, "Union Avenue Opera Promises New Talent, Old Favorites." ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'' 6 Jul 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  This production earned raves, and distinction as the most "Family-Friendly Opera" of the year, from the [[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Sarah Bryan, "Great Concerts Mark A Year Of Changes." ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'' 28 Dec 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, UAO presented for the first time [[Gian Carlo Menotti|Menotti]]'s ''[[Amahl and the Night Visitors]]''. The company revived ''Amahl'' yearly as a holiday production through 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Sarah Bryan, "Classical holiday concerts." ''Saint Louis Post-Dispatch'' 29 Nov 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, Union Avenue Opera has been awarded grants from several organizations including the [[Missouri Arts Council]], the St. Louis Regional Arts Commission, the Arts and Education Council and the Fox Associates Performing Arts Foundation. Union Avenue Opera's 2013 season will include [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]]'s ''[[Manon Lescaut (Puccini)|Manon Lescaut]]'', [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''[[Die Walküre]]'' (in an adaptation by British composer [[Jonathan Dove]]) and [[Leonard Bernstein]]'s ''[[Trouble in Tahiti]]''.

==Notable productions and premieres==

===''Dead Man Walking''===

In August 2011, Union Avenue Opera presented the Missouri premiere of Jake Heggie's [[Dead Man Walking (opera)|Dead Man Walking]] to great critical acclaim. In conjunction with the production, UAO and Union Avenue Christian Church invited anti-death penalty activist [[Sister Helen Prejean|Sr. Helen Prejean, CSJ]] to speak on the opera and her ministry. Prejean herself attended the opening night performance.

==Outreach==

===Children's opera===

Union Avenue Opera manages Springboard St. Louis’ opera component with workshops, residencies and performances for elementary school children. For several school years, UAO performed [[Seymour Barab]]'s ''Little Red Riding Hood'' and most recently ''Carmen and the Bull'', which tells the story of [[The Story of Ferdinand|Ferdinand the Bull]] set to musical themes in [[Georges Bizet|Bizet]]'s ''[[Carmen]]''.

===Pre-production events===

The company offers a variety of lectures and behind-the-scenes events in which patrons learn about upcoming productions, hear musical excerpts performed by UAO artists, listen to presentations, view costumes and tour sets in a relaxed atmosphere.

===School matinee===

Union Avenue Opera has presented matinees of ''[[Amahl and the Night Visitors]]'' free of charge to local area school groups. The first ever matinee was underwritten by the Fox Charitable Performing Arts Foundation and the Boeing Employee Community Fund.

[[File:Poznan 10-2013 img06 University.jpg|thumb|right|[[University Concert Hall]]]]
'''Universitas Cantat''' is the presentation forum of the musical life of the academic centers from entire world. Each year the leading university choirs meet in [[Poznań]].

==History==
The International Festival of University Choirs was organised for the first time in 1998. It is non-competitive. The idea of the event comes from the Rector of the [[Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań|Adam Mickiewicz University]], while the organisers are the University, the AMU Chamber Choir and AMU Chamber Choir Friends' Association. The organisers would like to establish a musical bridge connecting universities from all over the world. His artistic director is Polish conductor [[Krzysztof Szydzisz]]. Around 6000 students from 23 countries participated in eleven festival editions.

The festival concerts, which take place in the University Concert Hall and other venues of the [[Wielkopolska]] Province, aim at showing the rich musical variety of the groups and culture of the represented countries (the choirs perform music from the country of origin), creating atmosphere of openness and tolerance and inspiring cultural exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Universitas Cantat|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdn5iyoEDhc&amp;feature=related}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The very important assumption of the festival is to present Polish music to the foreign participants - every other year all invited singers work together on the Polish contemporary work. The culmination of the event is the final concert that includes each choir presentation and the performance of the Polish contemporary piece prepared during the workshops by the massed choirs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9439">'''Vibration fatigue''' is a [[mechanical engineering]] term describing [[material fatigue]], caused by [[forced vibration]] of [[random vibration|random]] nature. An excited structure responds according to its [[structural dynamics|natural-dynamics]] modes, which results in a dynamic [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]] load in the material points.&lt;ref name=maia /&gt; The process of [[material fatigue]] is thus governed largely by the shape of the excitation profile and the response it produces. As the profiles of excitation and response are preferably analyzed in the [[frequency domain]] it is practical to use [[Fatigue (material)#Fatigue life|fatigue life]] evaluation methods, that can operate on the data in [[frequency domain|frequency-domain]], such as [[power spectral density|power spectral density (PSD)]].

A crucial part of a vibration fatigue analysis is the [[modal analysis]], that exposes the natural modes and frequencies of the vibrating structure and enables accurate prediction of the local [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]] responses for the given excitation. Only then, when the [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]] responses are known, can vibration fatigue be successfully characterized.

The more classical approach of fatigue evaluation consists of cycle counting, using the [[Rainflow-counting algorithm|rainflow algorithm]] and summation by means of the [[Palmgren-Miner linear damage hypothesis]], that appropriately sums the damages of respective cycles. When the time history is not known, because the load is [[random]] (''e.g.'' a [[automobile|car]] on a rough [[road]] or a [[wind turbine|wind driven turbine]]), those cycles can not be counted. Multiple time histories can be simulated for a given [[random process]], but such procedure is cumbersome and [[computationally expensive]].&lt;ref name=lsarkani /&gt;

Vibration-fatigue methods offer a more effective approach, which estimates [[Fatigue (material)#Fatigue life|fatigue life]] based on moments of the [[power spectral density|PSD]]. This way, a value is estimated, that would otherwise be calculated with the [[time domain|time-domain]] approach. When dealing with many material nodes, experiencing different responses (''e.g.'' a model in a [[finite element method|FEM]] package), time-histories need not be simulated. It then becomes viable, with the use of vibration-fatigue methods, to calculate [[Fatigue (material)#Fatigue life|fatigue life]] in many points on the structure and successfully predict where the failure will most probably occur.

== Vibration-fatigue-life estimation ==

=== Random load description ===

In a random process, the amplitude can not be described as a function of time, because of its [[probability|probabilistic]] nature. However, certain statistical properties can be extracted from a signal sample, representing a realization of a random process. An important characteristics for the field of vibration fatigue is the amplitude [[probability density function]], that describes the statistical distribution of peak amplitudes. Ideally, the probability of cycle amplitudes, describing the load severity, could then be deduced directly. However, as this is not always possible, the sought-after probability is often estimated empirically.

=== Effects of structural dynamics ===

[[File:First mode of cantilever animation.gif|thumbnail|right|First natural mode of a [[cantilever|cantilever beam]].]]
Random excitation of the structure produces different responses, depending on the natural dynamics of the structure in question. Different natural modes get excited and each greatly affects the [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]] distribution in material. The standard procedure is to calculate [[frequency response function]]s for the analyzed structure and then obtain the [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]] responses, based on given loading or excitation.&lt;ref name=multiax /&gt; By exciting different modes, the spread of [[vibration]] energy over a frequency range directly affects the durability of the structure. Thus the structural dynamics analysis is a key part of vibration-fatigue evaluation.

=== Vibration-fatigue methods ===

Calculation of damage intensity is straightforward once the cycle amplitude distribution is known. This distribution can be obtained from a time-history simply by counting cycles. To obtain it from the [[power spectral density|PSD]] another approach must be taken.

Various vibration-fatigue methods estimate damage intensity based on moments of the [[power spectral density|PSD]], which characterize the statistical properties of the random process. The formulas for calculating such estimate are empirical (with very few exceptions) and are based on numerous simulations of random processes with known [[power spectral density|PSD]]. As a consequence, the accuracy of those methods varies, depending on analyzed response spectra, material parameters and the method itself - some are more accurate than others.&lt;ref name=vibl /&gt;

The most commonly used method is the one developed by T. Dirlik in 1985.&lt;ref name=dirlik /&gt; Recent research on frequency-domain methods of fatigue-life estimation&lt;ref name=vibl /&gt; compared well established methods and also recent ones; conclusion showed that the methods by Zhao and Baker, developed in 1992&lt;ref name=zhao /&gt; and by Benasciutti and Tovo, developed in 2004&lt;ref name=tovo /&gt; are also very suitable for vibration-fatigue analysis.

== Applications ==

Vibration fatigue methods find use wherever the structure experiences loading, that is caused by a [[random process]]. These can be the forces that bumps on the road extort on the [[Automobile|car]] [[chassis]], the wind blowing on the [[wind turbine]], waves hitting an [[offshore construction]] or a [[marine vessel]]. Such loads are first characterized statistically, by measurement and analysis. The data is then used in the [[product design]] process.&lt;ref name=varoto /&gt;

The computational effectiveness of vibration-fatigue methods in contrast to the classical approach, enables their use in combination with [[finite element method|FEM]] software packages, to evaluate fatigue after the loading is known and the dynamic analysis has been performed. Use of the vibration-fatigue methods is well-suited, as structural analysis is studied in the [[frequency domain|frequency-domain]].

Common practice in the [[automotive industry]] is the use of accelerated [[Vibration#Vibration testing|vibration tests]]. During the test, a part or a product is exposed to [[vibration]], that are in correlation with those expected during the [[service life|service-life]] of the product. To shorten the testing time, the amplitudes are amplified. The excitation spectra used are [[broad band|broad-band]] and can be evaluated most effectively using vibration-fatigue methods.
