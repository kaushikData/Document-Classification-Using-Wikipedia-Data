An '''action potential pulse''' is a mathematically and experimentally correct Synchronized Oscillating Lipid Pulse coupled with an [[Action potential|Action Potential.]] This is a continuation of Hodgkin Huxley's work in 1952 with the inclusion of accurately modelling [[ion channel]] proteins, including their dynamics and speed of activation.
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson A|first=Winlow W|date=Summer 2018|title=Mysteries of the action potential - From 1952 to infinity and beyond |journal=Physiology News |volume=38 |issue=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.3389/fphys.2018.00779|pmid=29988539|pmc=6026668|title=The Soliton and the Action Potential – Primary Elements Underlying Sentience|journal=Frontiers in Physiology|volume=9|pages=779|year=2018|last1=Johnson|first1=Andrew S|last2=Winlow|first2=William}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson A|first=Winlow W|date=15 Oct 2015|title=The Coupled Action Potential Pulse (APPulse)|url=https://www.ecronicon.com/ecne/pdf/ECNE-02-000018.pdf|journal=EC Neurology|volume=2.2|pages=94–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hodgkin Huxley|first=|date=1952|title=A quantitative description of membrane current and its application to conduction and excitation in  nerve|url=|journal=The Journal of Physiology|volume=117 |issue=4|pages=500–544}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The action potential pulse is a model of the speed an action potential that is dynamically dependant upon the position and number of ion channels, and the shape and make up of the axon. The action potential pulse model takes into account entropy and the conduction speed of the action potential along an axon. It is an addition to the Hodgkin Huxley model.

Investigation into the [[Cell membrane|membrane]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s of axons have shown that the spaces in between the channels are sufficiently large, such that [[cable theory]] cannot apply to them, because it depends upon the capacitance potential of a membrane to be transferred almost instantly to other areas of the membrane surface. In electrical circuits this can happen because of the special properties of electrons, which are negatively charged, whereas in membrane biophysics potential is defined by positively charged ions instead. These ions are usually Na&lt;sup&gt;1+&lt;/sup&gt; or Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, which move slowly by diffusion and have limited [[Ionic radius|ionic radii]] in which they can affect adjacent ion channels. It is mathematically impossible for these positive ions to move from one channel to the next, in the time required by the action potential flow model, due to instigated [[depolarization]]. Furthermore entropy measurements have long demonstrated that an action potential's flow starts with a large increase in entropy followed by a steadily decreasing state, which does not match the Hodgkin Huxley theory. In addition a [[Soliton model in neuroscience|soliton]] pulse is known to flow at the same rate and follow the action potential. From measurements of the speed of an action potential, [[Hyperpolarization (biology)|hyperpolarization]] must have a further component of which the 'soliton' mechanical pulse is the only candidate.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

The resulting action potential pulse therefore is a synchronized, coupled pulse with the entropy from depolarization at one channel providing sufficient [[entropy]] for a pulse to travel to sequential channels and mechanically open them.

This mechanism explains the speed of transmission through both [[myelin]]ated and unmyelinated [[axon]]s.

This is a timed pulse, that combines the entropy from ion transport with the efficiency of a flowing pulse.

The action potential pulse model has many advantages over the simpler Hodgkin Huxley version including evidence, efficiency, timing entropy measurements, and the explanation of nerve impulse flow through myelinated axons.

'''Myelinated axons'''

This model replaces [[saltatory conduction]], which was a historical theory that relied upon cable theory to explain conduction, and was an attempt at a model that has no basis is either physiology or membrane biophysics.

In myelinated axons the myelin acts as a mechanical transducer preserving the entropy of the pulse and insulating against mechanical loss. In this model the [[Node of Ranvier|nodes of Ranvier]] (where ion channels are highly concentrated) concentrate the ion channels providing maximum entropy to instigate a pulse that travels from node to node along the axon with the entropy being preserved by the shape and dynamics of the myelin sheath.

== Background ==
Utilization of halogen containing materials in processes such as water treatment, bleaching, or even general synthesis to create the final product, generates a number of organic halides. These organic halides are released in wastewater from the oil, chemical, and paper industries,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wan Osman|first=Wan Hasnidah|last2=Sheik Abdullah|first2=Siti Rozaimah|last3=Mohamad|first3=Abu Baker|last4=Kadhum|first4=Abdul Amir H.|last5=Abd Rahman|first5=Ramki|orig-year=2013|title=Simultaneous removal of AOX and COD from real recycled paper wastewater using GAC-SBBR|journal=Journal of Environmental Management|volume=121|doi=10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.02.005|year=2013|pages=80–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; and find their way to the consumer and eventually to a landfill or oceanic dumps. Within the soil, the halo compounds resist degradation and often react with metal ions, resulting in non-degradable metal complexes, increasing soil toxicity and accumulating in the food chain of aquatic organisms.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Savant|first=D.V.|last2=Abdul-Rahman|first2=R.|last3=Ranade|first3=D.R.|year=2005|title=Anaerobic degradation of adsorbable organic halides (AOX) from pulp and paper industry wastewater|journal=Bioresource Technology|volume=97|doi=10.1016/j.biortech.2004.12.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up to 2000 ppm of these bio-accumulative organic chlorides were detected in fat of fish from the waters where bleaching effluents were disposed by paper mills,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bjørseth|first=Alf|last2=Carlberg|first2=George E.|last3=Møller|first3=Mona|date=1979-03-01|title=Determination of halogenated organic compounds and mutagenicity testing of spent bleach liquors|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0048969779900275|journal=Science of the Total Environment|volume=11|issue=2|pages=197–211|doi=10.1016/0048-9697(79)90027-5|bibcode=1979ScTEn..11..197B}}&lt;/ref&gt; where a 2% water concentration is considered toxic for the fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Toxicity of Pulp and Paper Mill Effluent: a Literature Review|last=Hutchins|first=Floyd E|publisher=National Service Center for Environmental Publications|year=1979|isbn=|location=|pages=2|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While strict regulations from the government have reduced the high level of past emissions, these compounds find their way to water sources through improper consumer disposal of items that contain chlorinated compounds. The presence of any organic halides in natural water has been considered an indication of contamination with [[xenobiotic]]s.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grøn|first=Christian|date=1993-08-01|title=Organic Halogen Group Parameters as Indicators of Ground Water Contamination|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1745-6592.1993.tb00084.x/abstract|journal=Ground Water Monitoring &amp; Remediation|language=en|volume=13|issue=3|pages=148–158|doi=10.1111/j.1745-6592.1993.tb00084.x|issn=1745-6592}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once in water, the naturally occurring [[Humic acid|fulvic acids]] and [[humic acid]]s can lead to formation of [[mutagen]]ic compounds such as halogenated furanone MX (Z-3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone).&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Långvik|first=Vivi-Ann|last2=Holmbom|first2=Bjarne|date=1994-03-01|title=Formation of mutagenic organic by-products and AOX by chlorination of fractions of humic water|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004313549490006X|journal=Water Research|volume=28|issue=3|pages=553–557|doi=10.1016/0043-1354(94)90006-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumption of these [[mutagen]]ic compounds could cause several abnormalities in development and reproduction in humans through long half-lives and mimicking hormone receptors. For example, compounds like [[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]] can inhibit the actions of sex hormones by binding to steroid receptors along with causing long lasting cell disruption in several tissues.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

== Determination of AOX ==
Persistent organic pollutants such as [[DDT|dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane]] (DDT), [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|polychlorinated biphenols]], [[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]], are all assessed in AOX analysis. Generally, the higher the amount of chlorine in an organic compound, the more toxic it is considered.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; While there are several biochemical or electrochemical methods to remove organic halides, AOX has been preferred due to its low cost of operation and simplicity of design.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In a lab, the determination of AOX parameter consists of adsorption of organic halides from the sample on to an [[activated carbon]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The activated carbon can be [[Powdered activated carbon treatment|powdered]]&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bornhardt|first=C.|last2=Drewes|first2=J.

The inorganic halides that are also adsorbed are washed away using a strong acid such as [[nitric acid]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The carbon with adsorbed organic halide is obtained by filtration, after which the filter containing the carbon is burnt in the presence of oxygen. While combustion of hydrocarbon part of the compounds form CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, halo acids are formed from the halogens. These haloacids are absorbed into acetic acid. Subsequent use of microcolumetric titration, an electrochemical quantification method, provides the AOX content in the sample. Using the dilution ratio, the total AOX content at the location can be estimated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cgi.tu-harburg.de/~awwweb/wbt/emwater/lessons/lesson_a1/lm_pg_1055.html|title=ILIAS 3|website=cgi.tu-harburg.de|access-date=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, the chlorinated compounds in the sample can be determined by using [[pentane]] extraction followed by capillary [[Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry|gas chromatography]] and [[electron capture]] ([[Gas chromatography|GC-ECD]]).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The organic carbon that was remaining after the nitric acid purge can be analyzed using UV-persulfate wet oxidation followed by Infrared-detection ([[Infrared spectroscopy|IR]]).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Several other analytical techniques such as [[High-performance liquid chromatography|high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)]] could also be implemented to quantify AOX levels.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The general [[adsorption]] procedure is given below:

&lt;math&gt;{C^*}_(s_) + R-X (a.q)\longrightarrow {C^*}-X-R_(s_) + H_2O&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;{C^*}_(s_)&lt;/math&gt; is the activated carbon and &lt;math&gt;R-X&lt;/math&gt; is any organic halide.

&lt;math display="inline"&gt;{C^*}-X-R_(s_)

&lt;/math&gt;is the organic halide - activated carbon complex that can be filtered out.

== Treatment ==

=== Physical separation ===
In water treatment plants, organic halides are adsorbed using [[Activated carbon|GAC]] or [[Powdered activated carbon treatment|PAC]] in agitated tanks.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The loaded carbon is separated using a membrane made out of materials like polypropylene &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; or cellulose nitrate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Measuring the AOX levels into and out of the treatment zone shows a drop in organic halide concentrations. Some processes use a two-step [[Activated carbon|GAC]] filtration to remove AOX precursors, and thus reduce the amount of AOX in treated waters.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vahala|first=R.|last2=Långvik|first2=V. -A.|last3=Laukkanen|first3=R.|date=1999-01-01|title=Controlling adsorbable organic halogens (AOX) and trihalomethanes (THM) formation by ozonation and two-step granule activated carbon (GAC) filtration|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273122399006630|journal=Water Science and Technology|volume=40|issue=9|pages=249–256|doi=10.1016/S0273-1223(99)00663-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; A two step filtration process consists of two GAC filters in series. The first filter is loaded with exhausted GAC, while the second filter is loaded with fresh GAC. This set up is preferred for its increased efficiency and higher throughput capacity. The GAC is replaced cyclically and the extracted organic halide-carbon mixture is then sent for subsequent biological or chemical treatment such as ozonation to regenerate the GAC.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Often, these chemical treatments, while effective, pose economical challenges to the treatment plants.

=== Biological treatment ===
A more economically attractive option for treatment of the organic halides is through utilization of biological agents. Recently, bacteria ''(Ancylobacter aquaticus),'' fungi (''Phanerochaete chrysosporium'' and ''Coiriolus versicolor''), or synthetic enzymes have been used in the degradation of chlorinated organic compounds.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The microorganisms degrade halocompounds using either aerobic or anaerobic processes. The mechanisms of degradation include utilization of the compound as carbon source for energy, cometabolite, or as an electron acceptor.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/BFb0102076|title=Biotechnology in the Pulp and Paper Industry|last=Bajpai|first=Pratima|last2=Bajpai|first2=Pramod K.|date=1997-01-01|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783540618683|editor-last=Eriksson|editor-first=K.-E.

[[File:PCE Degradation Chemistry.jpg|center|frame|Figure 1: Step wise degradation of PCE]]

A sample dechlorination of chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (CAHs) such as [[Tetrachloroethylene|perchloroethylene]] (PCE) by ''[[Dehalococcoides|Dehalococcoides ethenogenes]]'' has been illustrated above. PCE is one of the highly chlorinated CAHs with no known microorganisms capable of aerobic degradation.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Chunlong|last2=Bennett|first2=George N.|date=2005-01-26|title=Biodegradation of xenobiotics by anaerobic bacteria|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00253-004-1864-3|journal=Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology|language=en|volume=67|issue=5|pages=600–618|doi=10.1007/s00253-004-1864-3|issn=0175-7598}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high [[Electronegativity|electronegative]] character of PCE renders oxidizing agent capabilities through accepting electrons by co-metabolism or dehalorespiration. In a co-metabolism, the reduction of PCE is made feasible by the utilization of a primary metabolite for carbon and energy source. In dehalorespiration, the electron transfer from oxidation of small molecules (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the major source; but, glucose, acetate, formate, and methanol can also be used) to PCE generates energy required for the bacterial growth. The hydrogen involved in this mechanism is often a product of another process such as fermentation of simple molecules like sugars or other complex molecules like fatty acids.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Moreover, due to competition from [[methanogen]]s for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, low H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations are favored by dechlorinating bacteria, and is often established through slow-release fermentation compounds such as fatty acids and decaying bacterial biomass.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tiehm|first=Andreas|last2=Schmidt|first2=Kathrin R|title=Sequential anaerobic/aerobic biodegradation of chloroethenes—aspects of field application|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0958166911000309|journal=Current Opinion in Biotechnology|volume=22|issue=3|pages=415–421|doi=10.1016/j.copbio.2011.02.003|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While several enzymes and electron carriers are involved in process, two enzymes perform the dechlorination reactions–PCE reductive dehydrogenase (PCE-RDase) and TCE reductive dehydrogenase (TCE-RDase). The PCE-RDase is normally found freely in cytoplasm while the TCE-RDase is found attached to the exterior cytoplasmic membrane. These enzymes normally utilize a metal ion cluster like Fe-S cluster to complete electron transfer cycle.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Hydrogen is oxidized to generate two protons and two electrons. The removal of first chloride, which is performed by PCE-RDase, reduces [[Tetrachloroethylene|PCE]] into TCE by reductive dehalogenation, where a hydride replaces the chlorine. The chloride lost from PCE gains the two electrons and the proton that accompanies them to form HCl. TCE can be reduced to [[1,2-Dichloroethene|''cis''-dichloroethene]] (cis-DCE) by either PCE-RDase or TCE-RDase. Subsequent reductions to [[vinyl chloride]] (VC) and [[ethylene]] are performed by TCE-RDase. The dechlorination of PCE to cis-DCE is faster and thermodynamically more favorable than dechlorination of cis-DCE to VC. The transformation of VC to ethylene is the slowest step of the process and hence limits the overall rate of the reaction.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The rate of reductive dechlorination is also directly correlated with the number of chlorine atoms, and as such, it decreases with a decreasing number of chlorine atoms.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In addition, while several groups of bacteria such as ''[[Desulfomonile]]'', ''[[Dehalobacter]]'', ''[[Desulfuromonas]]''...etc. can perform the dehalogenation of PCE to TCE, only the ''[[Dehalococcoides]]'' group can perform the complete reductive dechlorination from [[Tetrachloroethylene|PCE]] to [[Ethylene|ethene]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

In addition to dechlorination of CAHs, microbes have also been reported to act on chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons. An example of a reaction where aromatic AOX content has been reduced is demonstrated in figure 2 above.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Song|first=Xueping|last2=Pei|first2=Yong|last3=Su|first3=Jingjing|last4=Qin|first4=Chengrong|last5=Wang|first5=Shuangfei|last6=Nie|first6=Shuangxi|date=2016-07-19|title=Kinetics of Adsorbable Organic Halides (AOX) Reduction in Laccase-Aided Chlorine Dioxide Bleaching of Bagasse Pulp|url=http://ojs.cnr.ncsu.edu/index.php/BioRes/article/view/BioRes_11_3_7462_Song_Kinetics_Adsorbable_Organic_Halides|journal=BioResources|language=en|volume=11|issue=3|pages=7462–7475|doi=10.15376/biores.11.3.7462-7475|issn=1930-2126}}&lt;/ref&gt; While little is known about the dehalogenation mechanisms of polyhalogenated phenols (PHPs) and polyhalogenated benzenes (PHBs), regioselectivity for halide location on the aromatic ring was observed.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This regioselectivity is however dominated by both redox potentials for the reaction and the microbe's familiarity to the reaction.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Moreover, due to the specificity of most microbes along with complex aromatic structures, in order to achieve a complete dehalogenation, a mixture of more than one species of bacteria and/or fungi (often known as a consortium) is utilized.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  The reaction in figure 2 shows the reductive debromination of [[2,4,6-Tribromophenol|2,4,6-tribromophenol]] (2,4,6-TBP) by ''[[Ochrobactrum|Ochrabactrum]]''.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Based on the relative degradation of the molecule along with analytical results, it has been postulated that degradation of 2,4,6-TBP proceeds through debromination of ''ortho''-bromine in the first step by a dehalogenase to yield [[2,4-Dibromophenol|2,4-dibromophenol]] (2,4-DBP). Since there are two ''ortho'' bromines, debromination of either ''ortho'' carbons would yield the same product . Other species such as ''[[Pseudomonas glathei|Pseudomonas galthei]]'' or ''[[Azotobacter|Azotobacter sp.]]'' showed preference for ''para''-halide over the ''meta''- ''or ortho'' -halides. For example, the ''[[Azotobacter|Azotobacter sp.]]'' degrades [[2,4,6-Trichlorophenol|2,4,6-trichlorophenol]] (2,4,6-TCP) into 2,6-dichlorohydroquinone due to TCP-4-monooxygenase selectivity differences between ''ortho-'' and ''para''-halide. These differences in regioselectivity between the species can be attributed to the specificity of the 3-dimensional enzyme structure and its hindrance from steric interactions.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; It has been postulated that a proton lost by the phenol group of 2,4,6-TBP resulting in the formation of a negatively charged halo-phenolate ion. Subsequent attack of the ''para-''carbon with a hydride anion from NAD(P)H in a nucleophilic attack manner and resonance rearrangement results in substitution of bromine with hydride and formation of 2,4-DBP. Subsequent steps in a similar pattern yield 2-bromophenol, and [[phenol]] in the final step. [[Phenol]] can be metabolized by microorganisms to make [[methane]] and [[carbon dioxide]] or can be extracted easier than AOXs.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

EOX provides information on how halides can be extracted using a solvent while TOX provides information about the total organic halide content in the sample. This value can be used to estimate [[Basic oxygen demand]] (BOD) or [[chemical oxygen demand]] (COD), a key factor in estimating the required oxygen to burn the organic compounds to estimate the percentage of AOX’s and Extractable organic halides.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7913">'''Aliteracy''' (sometimes spelled alliteracy) is the state of being able to read but being uninterested in doing so. This phenomenon has been reported on as a problem occurring separately from [[illiteracy]], which is more common in the developing world, while aliteracy is primarily a problem in the developed world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/06/education/the-lost-book-generation.html?sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first=Roger | last=Cohen | title=The Lost Book Generation | date=January 6, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, John Ramsey defined aliteracy as a loss of a reading habit usually since reading is slow and frustrating for the reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ramsey|first=John|title=Hell's Bibliophiles: The fifth way of looking at an aliterate|journal=Change|year=2002|volume=34|issue=1|pages=50–56|doi=10.1080/00091380209601835}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unesco International Book Year report==
In a publication analyzing the 1972 [[International Book Year]], an estimate was given that as many as 57% of the citizens of an unnamed European nation known for their production of important books did not read books, or that 43% were book readers. Estimates for other industrialized nations' active readers ranged from 33 to 55%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0001/000122/012250eo.pdf Anatomy of an International Year]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commentary from authors, businesses and educators==
[[Jim Trelease]], author of ''The Read-Aloud Handbook'', has stated that this trend away from the written word is more than worrisome, and that it's tearing apart culture. People who have stopped reading, he says, "base their future decisions on what they used to know...If you don't read much, you really don't know much...you're dangerous."&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=The No-Book Report: Skim It and Weep|date=May 14, 2001|first=Linton|last=Weeks| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A23370-2001May13 | work=[[The Washington Post]]}}{{Dead link|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American historian [[Daniel Boorstin]], in 1984, while serving as [[librarian of Congress]], issued a landmark report: "Books in Our Future". Citing recent statistics that only about half of all Americans read regularly every year, he referred to the "twin menaces" of illiteracy and aliteracy. "In the United States today," Boorstin wrote, "aliteracy is widespread."&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt; In the United States, a 2008 study reported that 46.7% of adult Americans did not read a book not required for work or school during 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=National Endowment for the Arts|title=Reading on the Rise|url=http://www.nea.gov/research/readingonrise.pdf|accessdate=1 June 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320151903/http://www.nea.gov/research/readingonrise.pdf|archivedate=March 20, 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Another alert to this phenomenon was a 1991 editorial in [[Fortune (magazine)|''Fortune'' magazine]] by Stratford P. Sherman (with Laurie Kretchmar). It refers to a study by John P. Robinson, a sociology professor at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]], showing that the average American at that time spent only 24 minutes per day in reading. [[Samuel Robert Lichter]], director of the [[Center for Media and Public Affairs]], is quoted on his preference for the ease of turning on the TV instead of reading a book.

Kylene Beers' 1996 study connected aliteracy with reading motivation in teens. She noted unmotivated readers complained about not connecting with the text and could not "see" or visualize what was happening in the book. The inability to relate to the characters reduced the desire to read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beers|first=Kylene|title=No time, no interest, no way!

[[Robert Putnam]], in his book ''Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community'' argues that [[television]] has fragmented our society.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt;

Steven Layne's book, "[https://web.archive.org/web/20120405012205/http://www.stenhouse.com/shop/pc/viewprd.asp?idProduct=9302 Igniting a Passion for Reading]" discusses several proven methods that readers can do to increase the desire to read in others.

One method is to read aloud, both to children and adults. Reading aloud allows the listener to hear the story without struggling through decoding the words and possible frustration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Layne|first=Steven L.|title=Igniting a Passion for Reading: Successful Strategies for Building Lifetime Readers |year=2009|publisher=Stenhouse Publishers|location=Portland, ME|isbn=978-1-57110-385-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another method, used in schools, is to encourage students to read every day, choosing for themselves what to read, and reading simply for enjoyment. This is often referred to as [[Sustained Silent Reading]] (SSR). Dr. Stephen Krashen, a leading proponent of SSR, looked at 54 studies of such programs and found that in general they were successful at improving reading skills and building a reading habit.&lt;ref&gt;Krashen, Stephen D., 2011.

'''Ambivalent sexism''' is a theoretical framework which posits that [[sexism]] has two sub-components: "hostile sexism" and "benevolent sexism". Hostile sexism reflects overtly negative evaluations and [[stereotype]]s about a [[gender]] (e.g., the ideas that women are incompetent and inferior to men). Benevolent sexism represents evaluations of gender that may appear subjectively positive (subjective to the person who is evaluating), but are actually damaging to people and [[gender equality]] more broadly (e.g., the ideas that women need to be protected by men). For the most part, [[Psychology|psychologists]] have studied hostile forms of sexism. However, theorists using the theoretical framework of ambivalent sexism have found extensive [[empirical evidence]] for both varieties. The theory has largely been developed by [[Social psychology|social psychologists]] Peter Glick and [[Susan Fiske]].

==General overview==
Sexism, like other forms of [[prejudice]], is a type of [[bias]] about a group of people. Sexism is founded in conceptualizations of one gender as being superior or having higher status than another gender in a particular domain, which can lead to [[discrimination]]. Research has indicated that stereotypes about socially appropriate [[gender role]]s for women and men are a driving factor in the endorsement of sexism.&lt;ref name="Glick, P. 1997"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.1997.tb00104.x |title=Hostile and Benevolent Sexism |year=1997 |last1=Glick |first1=Peter |last2=Fiske |first2=Susan T. |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |volume=21 |pages=119–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patriarchy]], defined as men's power and "structural control over political, legal, economic, and religious institutions",&lt;ref name="Glick, P. 1997"/&gt; is a feature of sexism and is related to hostile attitudes toward women. [[Anthropology|Anthropological]] research suggests that patriarchy is pervasive among the majority of human societies, such that women have been systematically discriminated against, [[Oppression|oppressed]], and [[Marginalization|marginalized]] by men throughout history.&lt;ref name="Glick, P. 1997"/&gt; Sexism maintains patriarchal [[social structure]]s and reinforces prescribed gender roles.

Typically, sexism is thought of as hostility toward women, perpetrated by men. However, both women and men can (and often do) endorse sexist beliefs about each other and themselves. In other words, men can express sexist attitudes about women or men, and women can express sexist attitudes about men or women. While sexism has historically disadvantaged women, there are negative consequences of sexism for both men and women.&lt;ref name="Roets, A. 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/per.843 |title=Is Sexism a Gender Issue? A Motivated Social Cognition Perspective on Men's and Women's Sexist Attitudes Toward Own and Other Gender |year=2012 |last1=Roets |first1=Arne |last2=Van Hiel |first2=Alain |last3=Dhont |first3=Kristof |journal=European Journal of Personality |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=350–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rigid gender roles can be damaging to women and men alike, restricting opportunities and promoting gender-based prejudice. For the purposes of this article, sexism toward women will be the focus, as it is most relevant to the definition and study of ambivalent sexism.

Ambivalent sexism offers a multidimensional reconceptualization of the traditional view of sexism to include both subjectively benevolent and hostile attitudes toward women.&lt;ref name="Glick, P. 1996"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.70.3.491 |title=The Ambivalent Sexism Inventory: Differentiating hostile and benevolent sexism |year=1996 |last1=Glick |first1=Peter |last2=Fiske |first2=Susan T. |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=70 |issue=3 |pages=491–512}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "ambivalent" is used to describe the construal of sexism because this type of bias includes both negative and positive evaluations of women. The addition of a benevolent feature to definitions of gender-based prejudice was a major contribution to the study of sexism and field of psychology. Traditional conceptualizations of sexism focused almost entirely on overt hostility toward women. While historians, anthropologists, [[Feminist theory|feminist scholars]], and psychologists had previously suggested that sexism involves positive and negative evaluations of women, the majority of empirical research at the time evaluated only hostile expressions of sexism.&lt;ref name="Glick, P. 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Glick, P. 2001"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.56.2.109 |title=An ambivalent alliance: Hostile and benevolent sexism as complementary justifications for gender inequality |year=2001 |last1=Glick |first1=Peter |last2=Fiske |first2=Susan T. |journal=American Psychologist |volume=56 |issue=2 |pages=109–18 |pmid=11279804}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI)—a scale which was developed by Glick and Fiske in 1996, and which assesses ambivalently sexist attitudes—marks a shift in how sexism is construed and scientifically measured. Glick and Fiske created the ASI to address a proposed deficiency in the measurement of sexism at the time.&lt;ref name="Glick, P. 1996"/&gt; They argue that previous scales assessing sexism do not adequately capture the ambivalent nature of gender-based prejudice toward women.

==Theoretical framework==

Glick and Fiske assert that hostile and benevolent sexism complement each other in reinforcing [[tradition]]al gender roles and preserving patriarchal social structures of women as subordinate to men. Both forms of sexism share the assumption that women are inferior and restrict women to a lower [[social status]]. Hostile sexism reflects [[misogyny]] (i.e., the hatred of women by men) and is expressed through blatant negative evaluations of women.&lt;ref name="Glick, P., Diebold, J., Bailey-Werner, B., &amp; Zhu, L., 1997"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/01461672972312009 |title=The Two Faces of Adam: Ambivalent Sexism and Polarized Attitudes Toward Women |year=1997 |last1=Glick |first1=P. |last2=Diebold |first2=J. |last3=Bailey-Werner |first3=B. |last4=Zhu |first4=L. |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |volume=23 |issue=12 |pages=1323–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of hostile sexism include beliefs about women as incompetent, unintelligent, overly emotional, and sexually manipulative. Benevolent sexism reflects evaluations of women that are seemingly positive. Examples of benevolently sexist attitudes include the reverence of women in wife, mother, and child caretaker roles, the romanticizing of women as objects of [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] affection, and the belief that men have a duty to protect women.&lt;ref name="Glick, P. 1996"/&gt; While benevolent sexism may not appear to be harmful to women on the surface, these beliefs are extremely caustic to gender equity and restrict women's personal, professional, political, and social opportunities. This is because these seemingly positive evaluations imply that (a) women are weak and need to be protected, (b) women should not deviate from traditional gender roles as mothers and caretakers, and (c) women should be idolized by men for their [[sexual purity]] and availability.

Because benevolently sexist attitudes appear positive, people often do not identify these beliefs as a form of gender-based prejudice. Furthermore, benevolent sexism may be seen by both men and women as reinforcing of the status quo, which some individuals may find comforting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0361684312456369 |title=Why is Benevolent Sexism Appealing?: Associations with System Justification and Life Satisfaction |year=2012 |last1=Connelly |first1=K. |last2=Heesacker |first2=M. |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=432–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social and cultural [[norm (social)|norm]]s may encourage benevolently sexist beliefs among women and men. A classic illustration of this is the endorsement of [[Chivalry#Modern manifestations and revivals|modern-day chivalry]] in interactions between women and men.&lt;ref name="Herzog, S. &amp; Oreg, S., 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1540-5893.2008.00334.x |title=Chivalry and the Moderating Effect of Ambivalent Sexism: Individual Differences in Crime Seriousness Judgments |year=2008 |last1=Herzog |first1=Sergio |last2=Oreg |first2=Shaul |journal=Law &amp; Society Review |volume=42 |pages=45–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be considered traditional and polite for a man to insist that he holds a door open or carries a heavy object for a woman. However, this tradition is founded in historical representations of women as weaker than men. In these types of circumstances, people may find it difficult to distinguish between kindness, tradition, and benevolent sexism. Men and women often disagree on whether or not a specific incident should be considered sexist.&lt;ref name="Guteg, B. A., &amp; O'Conner, M., 1995"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1995.tb01314.x |title=The Empirical Basis for the Reasonable Woman Standard |year=1995 |last1=Gutek |first1=Barbara A. |last2=O'Connor |first2=Maureen |journal=Journal of Social Issues |volume=51 |pages=151–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, women and men tend to show more agreement in classifying extreme and overt expressions of sexism.&lt;ref name="Guteg, B. A., &amp; O'Conner, M., 1995"/&gt; Hostile sexism is typically easier for people to identify as an expression of prejudice.&lt;ref name="Chisango, T. &amp; Javangwe, G., 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11199-012-0146-2 |title=Are People Better at Recognizing Ambivalent Sexism on the Basis of the Non-standard Profiles than the Standard ASI Ones? |year=2012 |last1=Chisango |first1=Tadios |last2=Javangwe |first2=Gwatirera |journal=Sex Roles |volume=67 |pages=69–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, women are rarely perceived by others in an entirely hostile or benevolent manner. In fact, people frequently report high levels of both benevolent and hostile sexism.&lt;ref name="Glick et al., 2000"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.79.5.763 |title=Beyond prejudice as simple antipathy: Hostile and benevolent sexism across cultures |year=2000 |last1=Glick |first1=Peter |last2=Fiske |first2=Susan T. |last3=Mladinic |first3=Antonio |last4=Saiz |first4=José L. |last5=Abrams |first5=Dominic |last6=Masser |first6=Barbara |last7=Adetoun |first7=Bolanle |last8=Osagie |first8=Johnstone E. |last9=Akande |first9=Adebowale |last10=Alao |first10=Amos |last11=Brunner |first11=Barbara |last12=Willemsen |first12=Tineke M. |last13=Chipeta |first13=Kettie |last14=Dardenne |first14=Benoit |last15=Dijksterhuis |first15=Ap |last16=Wigboldus |first16=Daniel |last17=Eckes |first17=Thomas |last18=Six-Materna |first18=Iris |last19=Expósito |first19=Francisca |last20=Moya |first20=Miguel |last21=Foddy |first21=Margaret |last22=Kim |first22=Hyun-Jeong |last23=Lameiras |first23=Maria |last24=Sotelo |first24=Maria José |last25=Mucchi-Faina |first25=Angelica |last26=Romani |first26=Myrna |last27=Sakalli |first27=Nuray |last28=Udegbe |first28=Bola |last29=Yamamoto |first29=Mariko |last30=Ui |first30=Miyoko  |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=79 |issue=5 |pages=763–75 |pmid=11079240}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are individual differences in people's levels of benevolent and hostile sexism, such that a person can be rated highly on both, one, or neither dimension of the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory. In addition, women are not immune from endorsing sexist beliefs about women. Extensive research supports the idea that it is common for women and men to support ambivalently sexist attitudes about women.&lt;ref name="Glick, P. 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0361684311414832 |title=Ambivalent Sexism Revisited |year=2011 |last1=Glick |first1=P. |last2=Fiske |first2=S. T. |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=530–5|pmc=3896071 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, people find it difficult to believe that others can endorse both benevolent and hostile sexism.&lt;ref name="Chisango, T. &amp; Javangwe, G., 2012"/&gt; Research suggests that, when individuals are shown profiles of a benevolently sexist man and a man who endorses hostile sexism, they feel that it is very unlikely that one person can embody both forms of bias.&lt;ref name="Kilianski, S. E., &amp; Rudman, L.

Social psychologists have suggested that sexism may be inherently different from other forms of ambivalent prejudice, in that there is interdependency between women and men in social structures.&lt;ref name="Glick, P. 2011"/&gt; A central argument to the theory of ambivalent sexism is the idea that there is a complicated balance of power between men and women, such that men have structural power and women have dyadic power (stemming from dependence between two people). Dyadic power reflects the notion that men depend on women to fulfill certain goals, such as heterosexual [[intimacy]] and childbearing. Glick and Fiske assert that men's dependence on women is what fuels benevolently sexist attitudes, leading to idolization and the placing of women on a pedestal.&lt;ref name="Glick, P. 1996"/&gt; In other words, power relationships between men and women foster an ambivalent form of bias towards women.

Theoretically, each form of sexism is composed of three subcomponents: [[paternalism]], gender differentiation, and heterosexuality.&lt;ref name="Glick, P. 1997"/&gt; Paternalism reflects views of women as underdeveloped adults, providing justification for men to be authoritative and monitor, protect, and make decisions on women's behalf. Gender differentiation promotes the assumption that biological differences between males and females justify the strict adherence to socially prescribed gender roles. Heterosexuality—described as the most prominent cause of men's ambivalence toward women—reflects a tension between genuine desires for closeness and intimacy and a fear of women attaining power over men through sexual attraction.

Within hostile sexism (HS) and benevolent sexism (BS), the three subcomponents serve distinct functions. Dominative paternalism (HS) suggests that men should control women, while protective paternalism (BS) implies that men should protect and care for women. Competitive gender differentiation (HS) bolsters men's self-confidence (e.g., men are superior to women). Complementary gender differentiation (BS) places importance on traditional gender roles for women (e.g., mother &amp; wife) and assumes that men depend on women to fulfill these roles. Lastly, heterosexual hostility (HS) views women as [[Sexual objectification|sexual objects]] for men's pleasure and promotes the fear of women's capacity to manipulate men by engaging in or withholding sexual activity. Intimate heterosexuality (BS) romanticizes women as having sexual purity and views romantic intimacy as necessary to complete a man.

==Ambivalent Sexism Inventory==

Researchers typically measure ambivalent sexism at the individual level. The primary method used to measure an individual's endorsement of ambivalent sexism is the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI), created by Glick and Fiske in 1996. The ASI is a 22-item [[Self-report inventory|self-report measure]] of sexism on which respondents indicate their level of agreement with various statements, which are placed on a 6-point [[Likert scale]].&lt;ref name="Glick, P. 1996"/&gt; It is composed of two sub-scales that may be independently calculated for sub-scale scores or may be averaged for an overall composite sexism score. The first sub-scale is the hostile sexism scale, which is composed of 11 items designed to assess an individual's position on the dimensions of dominative paternalism, competitive gender differentiation, and heterosexual hostility, as previously defined. A sample item from the hostile sexism sub-scale is "Women are too easily offended." The second sub-scale is the benevolent sexism scale, which is composed of 11 items that aim to assess an individual's position on the dimensions of protective paternalism, complementary gender differentiation, and heterosexual intimacy, as previously defined. A sample item from the benevolent sexism sub-scale is "Women should be cherished and protected by men."

Over fifteen years of additional research and replications support that this inventory possesses [[psychometric]] characteristics indicating that the measure is both empirically reliable and valid. Standard criteria in psychological research can be utilized to evaluate a scale.&lt;ref name="McHugh, M. C., &amp; Frieze, I. H., 1997"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.1997.tb00097.x |title=The Measurement of Gender-Role Attitudes A Review and Commentary |year=1997 |last1=McHugh |first1=Maureen C. |last2=Frieze |first2=Irene Hanson |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |volume=21 |pages=1–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using statistics, a [[Cronbach's alpha]] coefficient can be calculated to indicate whether items on a scale seem to be measuring the same psychological construct or dimension (demonstrating the retestability of a scale). Generally, researchers agree that a Cronbach's alpha coefficient above 0.80 suggests strong reliability in a scale. The ASI has consistently demonstrated this empirical reliability over time.&lt;ref name="Glick, P. 2011"/&gt; In addition, empirical evaluations of the ASI provide support for the validity of the scale, such that the inventory seems to effectively measure what it proposes to assess: a polarized attitude towards women, where both dimensions can be activated simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Glick, P. 2011"/&gt;

The utility of the ASI is not limited to English speakers.&lt;ref name="Dardenne, 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.4074/S0003503306002041 |title=Structure latente et validation de la version française de l'Ambivalent Sexism Inventory : l'échelle de sexisme ambivalent |trans-title=Latent Structure of the French Validation of the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory : Échelle de Sexisme Ambivalent |language=French |year=2009 |last1=Dardenne |first1=Benoit |last2=Delacollette |first2=Nathalie |last3=Grégoire |first3=Christine |last4=Lecocq |first4=Delphine |journal=L'Année psychologique |volume=106 |issue=2 |pages=235–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is extensive support for the cross-cultural validity of the ASI. A cross-cultural study examining the theory of ambivalent sexism in 19 countries found that hostile and benevolent components of sexism are not culturally specific.&lt;ref name="Glick et al., 2000"/&gt; Furthermore, research suggests that ambivalently sexist attitudes towards men exist, such that hostile and benevolent attitudes toward men are found cross-culturally.&lt;ref name="Glick, P. 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.86.5.713 |title=Bad but Bold: Ambivalent Attitudes Toward Men Predict Gender Inequality in 16 Nations |year=2004 |last1=Glick |first1=Peter |last2=Lameiras |first2=Maria |last3=Fiske |first3=Susan T. |last4=Eckes |first4=Thomas |last5=Masser |first5=Barbara |last6=Volpato |first6=Chiara |last7=Manganelli |first7=Anna Maria |last8=Pek |first8=Jolynn C.

===Critiques===

While the ASI is widely used and accepted among researchers,&lt;ref name="Kilianski, S. E., &amp; Rudman, L. A., 1998"/&gt; one limitation of the ASI is that it is a self-reported measure.&lt;ref name="Sakalli-Ugurlu, 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00223980209604825 |title=Turkish College Students' Attitudes Toward Women Managers: The Effects of Patriarchy, Sexism, and Gender Differences |year=2002 |last1=Sakalli-Ugurlu |first1=Nuray |last2=Beydogan |first2=Basak |journal=The Journal of Psychology |volume=136 |issue=6 |pages=647–56 |pmid=12523452}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social desirability]] is a common limitation of self-report measures in survey research; when participants in a research study complete a written self-report questionnaire, respondents are vulnerable to answering the items in a socially desirable manner. For this reason, some researchers employ variations of the ASI in their study designs that do not require self-reports. For example, Dardeene, Dumont, and Bollier (2007) transformed some items from the ASI into scenarios, presenting them to participants to induce conditions of both hostile and benevolent sexism.&lt;ref name="Dardenne, 2006"/&gt; Hebl, King, Glick, Singletary, and Kazama (2007) designed a field study in which they observed the sexist behaviors of others; they used the theory of ambivalent sexism and the ASI to generate items for their own measure to assess these observed behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0021-9010.92.6.1499 |title=Hostile and benevolent reactions toward pregnant women: Complementary interpersonal punishments and rewards that maintain traditional roles |year=2007 |last1=Hebl |first1=Michelle R. |last2=King |first2=Eden B. |last3=Glick |first3=Peter |last4=Singletary |first4=Sarah L. |last5=Kazama |first5=Stephanie |journal=Journal of Applied Psychology |volume=92 |issue=6 |pages=1499–511 |pmid=18020792}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism of the ASI is that the labels of the two sub-constructs, "benevolent" and "hostile", are too abstract, do not generalize to certain languages, and may not be relevant to some cultures.&lt;ref name="Chisango, T. &amp; Javangwe, G., 2012"/&gt;

Lastly, findings from the Conn, Hanges, Sipe, and Salvaggio (1999) study suggest that other sexism scales may measure ambivalent attitudes towards women.&lt;ref name="Conn, A., Paul, H., Sipe, W., &amp; Salvaggio, A., 1999"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/00131649921970242 |title=The Search for Ambivalent Sexism: A Comparison of Two Measures |year=1999 |last1=Conn |first1=A. B. |last2=Hanges |first2=P. J. |last3=Sipe |first3=W. P. |last4=Salvaggio |first4=A. N. |journal=Educational and Psychological Measurement |volume=59 |issue=6 |pages=898–909}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glick and Fiske originally proposed the theoretical framework of ambivalent sexism as filling a gap in the psychological literature and providing a novel tool for assessing a new dimension of sexism: benevolent sexism.&lt;ref name="Glick, P. 1996"/&gt; However, Conn and colleagues (1999), using [[confirmatory factor analysis]], showed that the Modern Sexism Scale (Swim, Aikin, Hall, and Hunter, 1995) captures ambivalent sentiments toward women, such that it identifies individuals that appear nonsexist but actually endorse sexist attitudes.&lt;ref name="Conn, A., Paul, H., Sipe, W., &amp; Salvaggio, A., 1999"/&gt; Results from this study suggest that, while both the Modern Sexism Scale and the ASI assess ambivalence toward women, the ASI is unique in its capabilities for separately measuring both hostile and benevolent attitudes. In addition, the ASI captures heterosexual intimacy and benevolent paternalism, whereas the Modern Sexism Scale does not.

==Empirical support==

While many individuals{{specify|date=July 2018}} endorse both benevolent and hostile sexism simultaneously, research{{by whom|date=July 2018}} suggests that people rated significantly higher in one of the two sub-components have distinct constellations of beliefs and patterns of behavior. In other words, someone who is high in benevolent sexism tends to show a different profile of attitudes than someone who is high in hostile sexism. The independence of these types of sexism in predicting human behavior indicates that the two are, in fact, discrete forms of bias on separate but related axes. Examples of research findings identifying disparate outcomes between benevolent sexism and hostile sexism are described below. In addition, the relationships between ambivalent sexism and a range of other related attitudes and behaviors are discussed.

===Attitudes toward sexual harassment, intimate partner violence, and rape===

Men who are ambivalently sexist (i.e., high in both benevolent and hostile sexism simultaneously) and men who are high in hostile sexism are more likely to tolerate the [[sexual harassment]] of women than men who are benevolently sexist.&lt;ref name="Russell, B. L., &amp; Trigg, K., 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1023/B:SERS.0000023075.32252.fd |title=Tolerance of Sexual Harassment: An Examination of Gender Differences, Ambivalent Sexism, Social Dominance, and Gender Roles |year=2004 |last1=Russell |first1=Brenda L. |last2=Trigg |first2=Kristin Y. |journal=Sex Roles |volume=50 |issue=7/8 |pages=565–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, hostile sexism is associated with acceptance of sexual harassment.&lt;ref name="Begany, J., &amp; Milburn, M., 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/1524-9220.3.2.119 |title=Psychological predictors of sexual harassment: Authoritarianism, hostile sexism, and rape myths |year=2002 |last1=Begany |first1=Joseph J. |last2=Milburn |first2=Michael A. |journal=Psychology of Men &amp; Masculinity |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=119–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the endorsement of hostile sexism is related to attitudes about [[intimate partner violence]] perpetrated by men towards women, such that people that are high in hostile sexism are more tolerant of intimate partner violence.&lt;ref name="Glick, P., Sakalli-Ugurlu, N., Ferreira, M., &amp; de Souza, M. 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1471-6402.t01-1-00068 |title=Ambivalent Sexism and Attitudes Toward Wife Abuse in Turkey and Brazil |year=2002 |last1=Glick |first1=Peter |last2=Sakalli-Ugurlu |first2=Nuray |last3=Ferreira |first3=Maria Cristina |last4=Aguiar De Souza |first4=Marcos |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=292–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benevolently sexist attitudes were not found to be a significant predictor of the tolerance of intimate partner violence. However, the endorsement of benevolent sexism was not a protective factor either. Lastly, men high in hostile sexism are more likely to rape women, whereas men that are high in benevolent sexism are more likely to [[Victim-blaming|blame a victim]] of rape for the attack.&lt;ref name="Viki &amp; Abrams, 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |title=But She Was Unfaithful: Benevolent Sexism and Reactions to Rape Victims Who Violate Traditional Gender Role Expectations|doi=10.1023/A:1021342912248 |year=2002 |last1=Viki |first1=G. Tendayi |last2=Abrams |first2=Dominic |journal=Sex Roles |volume=47 |issue=5/6 |pages=289–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Close relationships and attraction===

Research has shown that sexist attitudes relate to preferences for certain characteristics in romantic partners.&lt;ref name="Sibley &amp; Overall, 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0361684311401838 |title=A Dual Process Motivational Model of Ambivalent Sexism and Gender Differences in Romantic Partner Preferences |year=2011 |last1=Sibley |first1=C. G. |last2=Overall |first2=N. C. |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=303–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence suggests that women with higher levels of benevolent sexism have more stereotypical preferences in men as romantic partners, such as financial security and resources. Men with higher levels of hostile sexism are more likely to value physical attractiveness in women as romantic partners. In addition, benevolent sexism tends to predict mate selection, whereas hostile sexism tend to predict subsequent marriage norms after pairing.&lt;ref name="Chen, Fiske, &amp; Lee, 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11199-009-9585-9 |title=Ambivalent Sexism and Power-Related Gender-role Ideology in Marriage |year=2009 |last1=Chen |first1=Zhixia |last2=Fiske |first2=Susan T. |last3=Lee |first3=Tiane L. |journal=Sex Roles |volume=60 |issue=11–12 |pages=765–778 |pmid=24058258 |pmc=3777654}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women find men high in benevolent sexism attractive, and rate men high in ambivalent sexism as less attractive.&lt;ref name="Bohner, Ahlborn, &amp; Steiner, 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11199-009-9665-x |title=How Sexy are Sexist Men? Women's Perception of Male Response Profiles in the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory |year=2009 |last1=Bohner |first1=Gerd |last2=Ahlborn |first2=Katrin |last3=Steiner |first3=Regine |journal=Sex Roles |volume=62 |issue=7–8 |pages=568–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in a recent research study on a particular aspect of benevolent sexism, protective paternalistic beliefs, women endorsed more protective paternalistic beliefs for men (toward women) in romantic versus work contexts. The endorsement of these beliefs in romantic contexts is thought to serve to reinforce and maintain such benevolent sexist behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0361684312454842 |title=Prescription of Protective Paternalism for Men in Romantic and Work Contexts |year=2012 |last1=Sarlet |first1=M. |last2=Dumont |first2=M. |last3=Delacollette |first3=N. |last4=Dardenne |first4=B. |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=444–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, benevolent sexism and hostile sexism are associated with beliefs that [[premarital sex]] is unacceptable for women.&lt;ref name="Sakalli-Ugurlu &amp; Glick, 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00224490309552194 |title=Ambivalent sexism and attitudes toward women who engage in premarital sex in Turkey |year=2003 |last1=Sakalh‐Uğurlu |first1=Nuray |last2=Glick |first2=Peter |journal=Journal of Sex Research |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=296–302 |pmid=14533024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women in the workplace===

While the consequences of hostile sexism in the workplace are more widely known and accepted, research has shown that benevolent sexism may have a more severe impact on a women's cognitive performance.&lt;ref name="Dardenne, 2006"/&gt; Dardenne, et al.(2006) suggested that hostile sexism can elicit anger or frustration in the target, which may increase her motivation to succeed or perform. Benevolent sexism, because of its seemingly positive evaluations and implicit attributions, is likely to hinder a woman's confidence and performance. The researchers showed that, in a typical team working environment, hostile sexism as well as benevolent sexism had consequences for the participant's performance. Masser and Abrams (2004) highlighted the fact that previous research has shown that benevolent sexism can have detrimental effects on a woman's performance evaluation if that woman violates social norms associated with certain sexist attitudes.&lt;ref name="Masser, B. M.&amp; Abrams, D., 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11199-004-5470-8 |title=Reinforcing the Glass Ceiling: The Consequences of Hostile Sexism for Female Managerial Candidates |year=2004 |last1=Masser |first1=Barbara M. |last2=Abrams |first2=Dominic |journal=Sex Roles |volume=51 |issue=9–10 |pages=609–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their study showed that hostile sexism, but not benevolent sexism, hurt women's evaluations and recommendations for promotion.

Additionally, studies have shown that benevolent sexist attitudes lead to lower professional evaluations from men and women.&lt;ref name="Glick, P. 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Masser, B. M.&amp; Abrams, D., 2004"/&gt; Using an experimental design, Masser and Abrams (2004) found that individuals with hostile sexist attitudes rated women lower when applying for a male-dominant position. Additionally, high hostile sexist individuals recommend men to fill the available position more often than women. The authors argue that this is one of the main contributors to the [[glass ceiling]] effect.

===Help-seeking===

In a recent experimental study on the effects of benevolent sexism on [[help-seeking]] behaviors, researchers found that, when stereotypes of women as dependent were made salient, female college students were less willing to seek help. In addition, the more that help was sought, the worse women felt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0361684312457659 |title=Thanks, but No Thanks: Women's Avoidance of Help-Seeking in the Context of a Dependency-Related Stereotype |year=2012 |last1=Wakefield |first1=J. R. H. |last2=Hopkins |first2=N. |last3=Greenwood |first3=R. M. |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=423–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, benevolent sexism appears to hold consequences towards women's help-seeking when certain benevolent sexist stereotypes are made salient.

=== Voting Behaviour ===
During the 2016 US Presidential Election, researchers connected ambivalent sexism to voting intentions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/2016/10/10/a-basket-of-deplorables-a-new-study-finds-that-trump-supporters-are-more-likely-to-be-islamophobic-racist-transphobic-and-homophobic/|title=A ‘basket of deplorables’?

For every step up on the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory, participants were 3.3 times more likely to be voting for someone other than Hillary Clinton. Of those not voting for Clinton, they were not necessarily being pulled over to the Trump campaign, but rather, many were intending to vote Third Party or were still undecided. While higher Islamophobia predicted a vote for Trump, lower Islamophobia and ''higher'' ambivalent sexism predicted being undecided or voting for a Third Party.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Women's endorsement of ambivalent sexism==

Both benevolent and hostile sexism are considered legitimizing ideologies, in that these attitudes provide the justification for social inequalities between men and women.&lt;ref name="Sidanius, Pratto, &amp; Bobo, 1994"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.67.6.998 |title=Social dominance orientation and the political psychology of gender: A case of invariance? |year=1994 |last1=Sidanius |first1=Jim |last2=Pratto |first2=Felicia |last3=Bobo |first3=Lawrence |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=67 |issue=6 |pages=998–1011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social dominance orientation]] (SDO; Sidanius &amp; Pratto, 1999) asserts that group-based inequalities are systematically reinforced by the disadvantaged group's adoption of the dominant group's ideology and social stratification.&lt;ref name="Sidanius &amp; Pratto 1999"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sidanius |first1=Jim |last2=Pratto |first2=Felicia |year=1999 |title=Social Dominance: An Intergroup Theory of Social Hierarchy and Oppression |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-62290-5}}{{page needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empirical research has consistently supported the validity of Social Dominance Theory,&lt;ref name="Gaucher, Frieser, &amp; Kay, 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/a0022530 |title=Evidence that gendered wording in job advertisements exists and sustains gender inequality |year=2011 |last1=Gaucher |first1=Danielle |last2=Friesen |first2=Justin |last3=Kay |first3=Aaron C. |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=101 |pages=109–28 |pmid=21381851 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the SDO model of structural oppression may be particularly apt to describe how patriarchy is perpetuated.&lt;ref name="Sibley et al, 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11199-008-9554-8 |title=Your Sexism Predicts My Sexism: Perceptions of Men's (but not Women's) Sexism Affects One's Own Sexism over Time |year=2008 |last1=Sibley |first1=Chris G. |last2=Overall |first2=Nickola C. |last3=Duckitt |first3=John |last4=Perry |first4=Ryan |last5=Milfont |first5=Taciano L. |last6=Khan |first6=Sammyh S. |last7=Fischer |first7=Ronald |last8=Robertson |first8=Andrew |journal=Sex Roles |volume=60 |issue=9–10 |pages=682–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have explored reasons for why women might [[Internalisation (sociology)|internalize]] ambivalently sexist attitudes towards women. Fischer (2006) found that women may develop benevolently sexist attitudes as a response to experiencing sexism themselves.&lt;ref name="Fischer, 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.2006.00316.x |title=Women's Benevolent Sexism As Reaction to Hostility |year=2006 |last1=Fischer |first1=Ann R. |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=410–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cross-cultural research suggests that women's endorsement of benevolent sexism often reflects a culture of extreme hostile sexism among men in a given community.&lt;ref name="Glick et al., 2000"/&gt; Some researchers argue that, in cultures that are particularly hostile, women may internalize benevolent sexism as a protective mechanism.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21319">The '''artificial pancreas''' is a technology in development to help people with [[diabetes]], primarily type 1, automatically and continuously control their [[blood glucose level]] by providing the substitute [[endocrine]] functionality of a healthy [[pancreas]].

The endocrine functionality of the pancreas is provided by [[Pancreatic islets|islet cells]] which produce the hormones [[insulin]] and [[glucagon]]. Artificial pancreatic technology mimics the secretion of these hormones into the bloodstream in response to the body's changing blood glucose levels. Maintaining balanced blood sugar levels is crucial to the function of the brain, liver, and kidneys.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://columbiasurgery.org/pancreas/pancreas-and-its-functions|title=The Pancreas and Its Functions {{!}} Columbia University Department of Surgery|website=columbiasurgery.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, for type 1 patients, it is necessary that the levels be kept balanced when the body cannot produce insulin itself.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

The artificial pancreas is a broad term for different [[Biological engineering|bio-engineering]] strategies currently in development to achieve these requirements. Different bio-engineering approaches under consideration include:

* the [[medical equipment]] approach—using an [[insulin pump]] under [[control theory|closed loop control]] using real-time feedback data from a [[continuous glucose monitor|continuous blood glucose monitor]].
* the [[Physiology|physiological]] approach—the development of a treatment with engineered [[Stem cell|stem cells]] to be integrated into the body to provide functional blood glucose regulation.

==Approaches==

===Medical equipment===
The medical equipment approach involves combining a continuous glucose monitor and an implanted insulin pump that can function together with a computer-controlled algorithm to replace the normal function of the pancreas.&lt;ref name="Gingras2017"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gingras V, Taleb N, Roy-Fleming A, Legault L, Rabasa-Lhoret R | title = The challenges of achieving postprandial glucose control using closed-loop systems in patients with type 1 diabetes | journal = Diabetes, Obesity &amp; Metabolism | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 245–256 | date = February 2018 | pmid = 28675686 | doi = 10.1111/dom.13052 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Uduku C, Oliver N | title = Pharmacological aspects of closed loop insulin delivery for type 1 diabetes | journal = Current Opinion in Pharmacology | volume = 36 | pages = 29–33 | date = October 2017 | pmid = 28802779 | doi = 10.1016/j.coph.2017.07.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Graf A, McAuley SA, Sims C, Ulloa J, Jenkins AJ, Voskanyan G, O'Neal DN | title = Moving Toward a Unified Platform for Insulin Delivery and Sensing of Inputs Relevant to an Artificial Pancreas | journal = Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology | volume = 11 | issue = 2 | pages = 308–314 | date = March 2017 | pmid = 28264192 | pmc = 5478040 | doi = 10.1177/1932296816682762 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of continuous glucose monitors has led to the progress in artificial pancreas technology using this integrated system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Apablaza P, Soto N, Codner E | title = [From insulin pump and continuous glucose monitoring to the artificial pancreas] | journal = Revista Medica De Chile | volume = 145 | issue = 5 | pages = 630–640 | date = May 2017 | pmid = 28898340 | doi = 10.4067/S0034-98872017000500011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Continuous Glucose Monitors ====
[[Image:Artificial Pancreas.jpg|thumb|Artificial pancreas feedback system |alt=]]

The original devices for use in type 1 diabetes were [[Glucose meter|blood glucose meters]]. Continuous blood glucose monitors are one of the set of devices that make up an artificial pancreas device system, the other being an insulin pump, and a glucose meter to calibrate the device.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/medicaldevices/productsandmedicalprocedures/homehealthandconsumer/consumerproducts/artificialpancreas/ucm259548.htm#artificial|title=Artificial Pancreas Device System - What is the pancreas?  What is an artificial pancreas device system?|last=Health|first=Center for Devices and Radiological|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Continuous glucose monitors are a more recent breakthrough and have begun to hit the markets for patient use after approval from the FDA. Both the traditional and the continuous monitor require manual insulin delivery or carbohydrate intake depending on the readings from the devices. While the traditional blood glucose meters require the user to prick their finger every few hours to obtain data, continuous monitors use sensors placed just under the skin on the arm or abdomen to deliver blood sugar level data to receivers or smartphone apps as often as every few minutes.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The sensors can be used for up to ten days.  A number of different continuous monitors are currently approved by the FDA.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.managedcaremag.com/archives/2018/7/first-four-continuous-glucose-monitors|title=The First Four Continuous Glucose Monitors|date=2018-07-04|work=Managed Care magazine|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first continuous glucose monitor (CGM) was approved in December 2016. Developed by [[Dexcom]], the G5 Mobile Continuous Monitoring System requires users to prick their fingers twice a day (as opposed to the typical average 8 times daily with the traditional meters) in order to calibrate the sensors. The sensors last up to seven days. The device uses Bluetooth technology to warn the user either through a handheld receiver or app on a smartphone if blood glucose levels reach below a certain point. The cost for this device excluding any co-insurance is an estimated $4,800 a year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:BGM twopart.JPG|alt=The white sensor is fixed to the upper arm and scanned with the reader. The reader is showing (top to bottom) days to replacement of sensor (11), current BG (7,4) &amp; change (-&gt; i.e. steady) and a diagram of the latest BG levels.|thumb|Blood glucose meter FreeStyle Libre from Abbott. ]]
[[Abbott Laboratories|Abbott Laboratories']] FreeStyle Libre CGM was approved in September 2017. It does not support smartphone use. This device does not require finger pricks at all and the sensor, placed on the upper arm, lasts 10 days. The estimated cost for this monitor is $1,300 a year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Dexcom's next G6 model CGM was approved in March 2018, which can last up to ten days and does not need finger prick calibration. Like Medtronic's monitor, it can predict glucose level trends. It is compatible for integration into insulin pumps. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Closed-Loop Systems ====
Unlike the continuous sensor alone, the closed-loop system requires no user input in response to reading from the monitor; the monitor and insulin pump system automatically delivers the correct amount of hormone calculated from the readings transmitted. The system is what makes up the artificial pancreas device.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Elleri D, Dunger DB, Hovorka R | title = Closed-loop insulin delivery for treatment of type 1 diabetes | language = En | journal = BMC Medicine | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 120 | date = November 2011 | pmid = 22071283 | doi = 10.1186/1741-7015-9-120 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== MiniMed 670G =====
In September 2016, the FDA approved the [[Medtronic MiniMed 670G]], which was the first approved hybrid [[Closed-loop transfer function|closed loop system]]. The device senses a diabetic person's [[Basal (medicine)|basal]] insulin requirement and automatically adjusts its delivery to the body.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wayback.archive-it.org/7993/20170111141252/http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/DeviceApprovalsandClearances/Recently-ApprovedDevices/ucm522764.htm|title=Recently-Approved Devices - The 670G System - P160017|last=Health|first=Center for Devices and Radiological|website=wayback.archive-it.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is made up of a continuous glucose monitor, an insulin pump, and a glucose meter for calibration. It automatically functions to modify the level of insulin delivery based off the detection of blood glucose levels by continuous monitor. It does this by sending the blood glucose data through an algorithm that analyzes and makes the subsequent adjustments.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The system has two modes. Manual mode lets the user choose the rate at which basal insulin is delivered. Auto mode regulates basal insulin levels from the continuous monitor's readings every five minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.medtronicdiabetes.com/products/minimed-670g-insulin-pump-system|title=MiniMed 670G Insulin Pump System {{!}} World's First Hybrid Closed Loop System|website=www.medtronicdiabetes.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The device was originally available only to those aged 14 or older, and in June 2018 was approved by the FDA for use in children aged 7-14. Families have reported better sleep quality from use of the new system, as they do not have to worry about manually checking blood glucose levels during the night.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.medtronicdiabetes.com/loop-blog/fda-approves-minimed-670g-system-children-7-13/|title=FDA Approves the MiniMed 670G System for Children 7-13 - The LOOP Blog|website=www.medtronicdiabetes.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full cost of the system is $3700, but patients have the opportunity to get it for less.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.medtronicdiabetes.com/loop-blog/update-minimed-670g-availability/|title=Update on MiniMed 670G Availability|website=www.medtronicdiabetes.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== iLet Bionic Pancreas =====
A team at [[Boston University]] working in collaboration with [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] on a dual hormone artificial pancreas system &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bionicpancreas.org/|title=bionicpancreas.org|website=www.bionicpancreas.org|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; began clinical trials on their device called the Bionic Pancreas in 2008.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.healthline.com/diabetesmine/beta-bionics-ilet-update#1|title=Update on the iLet Bionic Pancreas Closed Loop System|work=Healthline|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the Public Benefit Corporation [[Beta Bionics]] was formed. In conjunction with the formation of the company, Beta Bionics changed the preliminary name for their device from the Bionic Pancreas to the iLet.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The device uses a closed-loop system to deliver both insulin and glucagon in response to sensed blood glucose levels. While not yet approved for public use, the 4th generation iLet prototype, presented in 2017, is around the size of an iPhone, with a touchscreen interface. It contain two chambers for both insulin and glucagon, and the device is configurable for use with only one hormone, or both.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bu.edu/today/2017/bionic-pancreas-clinical-trial/|title=Bionic Pancreas Passes Critical Science Hurdle {{!}} BU Today {{!}} Boston University|work=BU Today|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; While trials continue to be run, the iLet has a projected final approval for the insulin-only system in 2020.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===== Current Studies =====
Four studies on different artificial pancreas systems are being conducted starting in 2017 and going into the near future. The projects are funded by the [[National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases]](NIDDK), and are the final part of testing the devices before applying for approval for use. Participants in the studies are able to live their lives at home while using the devices and being monitored remotely for safety, efficacy, and a number of other factors.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://medlineplus.gov/magazine/issues/spring17/articles/spring17pg15-16.html|title=The Miracle of an Artificial Pancreas {{!}} NIH MedlinePlus the Magazine|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Diabetes Closed-Loop trial,&lt;ref&gt;{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT02844517|International Diabetes Closed Loop (iDCL) Trial: Research Site Training Protocol}}&lt;/ref&gt; led by researchers from the [[University of Virginia]], is testing a closed-loop system called inControl, which has a smartphone user interface. 240 people of ages 14 and up are participating for 6 months.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

A full-year trial led by researchers from the [[University of Cambridge]] started in May 2017 and has enrolled an estimated 150 participants of ages 6 to 18 years.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The artificial pancreas system being studied uses a smartphone and has a low glucose feature to improve glucose level control.&lt;ref&gt;{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT02925299|Day and Night Closed-loop in Young People With Type 1 Diabetes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Diabetes Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in collaboration with [[Rabin Medical Center|Schneider Children's Medical Center]] in Petah Tikva, Israel, are planning a 6-month study that will begin in early 2019 and will involve 112 adolescents and young adults, ages 14 to 30.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT03040414|Fuzzy Logic Automated Insulin Regulation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main object of the study is to compare the current Medtronic 670G system to a new Medtronic-developed system. The new system has programming that aims to improve glucose control around mealtime, which is still a big challenge in the field.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The current 6-month study lead by the Bionic Pancreas team started in mid-2018 and enrolled 312 participants of ages 18 and above.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Physiological ===
[[Image:Bio-artificial pancreas with Islet Sheet technology.JPG|thumb|right|300px|'''The Bio-artificial pancreas''': this diagram shows a cross section of [[tissue engineering|bio-engineered tissue]] with encapsulated [[islets of Langerhans|islet cells]] which deliver [[endocrine]] [[pancreas#Function|hormones]] in response to [[glucose]].]]

The biotechnical company Defymed, based in France, is developing an implantable bio-artificial device called MailPan which features a bio-compatible membrane with [[Semipermeable membrane|selective permeability]] to encapsulate different cells types, including pancreatic [[Beta cell|beta cells]].&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3749642,00.html|title=Israeli and French Biotech Companies Partner to Fight Diabetes With Bio-Artificial Pancreas|date=2018-11-12|work=CTECH - www.calcalistech.com|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implantation of the device does not require conjunctive immuno-supressive therapy because the membrane prevents antibodies of the patient from entering the device and damaging the encapsulated cells. After being surgically implanted, the membrane sheet will be viable for years.The cells that the device holds can be produced from stem cells rather than human donors, and may also be replaced over time using input and output connections without surgery.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.defymed.com/mailpan/|title=MailPan ® BioArtificial Pancreas {{!}} Defymed, advanced therapies inspired for you|work=Defymed|access-date=2018-11-28|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defymed is partially funded by JDRF, formerly known as the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, but is now defined as an organization for all ages and all stages of type 1 diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180212005894/en/Innovative-Medical-Devices-Treatment-Diabetes-Defymed-Strengthens|title=Innovative Medical Devices for the Treatment of Diabetes, Defymed Strengthens Its Position as a Worldwide Leader|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jdrf.ca/who-we-are/what-does-jdrf-stand-for/|title=What Does JDRF Stand For?|last=Canada|first=JDRF|website=JDRF Canada|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2018, it was announced that Defymed would partner with the Israel-based Kadimastem, a bio-pharmaceutical company developing stem-cell based regenerative therapies, to receive a two-year grant worth approximately $1.47 million for the development of a bio-artificial pancreas that would treat type 1 diabetes.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kadimastem.com/|title=Kadimastem - Stem Cell to Cure Diseases|website=www.kadimastem.com|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kadimastem's stem cell technology uses differentiation of human embryonic stem cells to obtain pancreatic endocrine cells. These include insulin-producing beta cells, as well as alpha cells, which produce glucagon. Both cells arrange in islet-like clusters, mimicking the structure of the pancreas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kadimastem.com/regenerative-medicine/17/diabetes|title=Diabetes - Kadimastem|website=www.kadimastem.com|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the partnership is to combine both technologies in a bio-artificial pancreas device, which releases insulin in response to blood glucose levels, to bring to clinical trial stages.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

The San Diego, California based biotech company ViaCyte has also developed a product aiming to provide a solution for type 1 diabetes which uses an encapsulation device made of a semi-permeable immune reaction-protective membrane. The device contains pancreatic [[Progenitor cell|progenitor cells]] that have been differentiated from embryonic stem cells.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/two-year-data-from-viacytes-step-one-clinical-trial-presented-at-ada-2018-300671013.html|title=Two-year Data from ViaCyte's STEP ONE Clinical Trial Presented at ADA 2018|last=Inc.|first=ViaCyte,|website=www.prnewswire.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://viacyte.com/products/pec%E2%80%90encap-vc-01|title=PEC‐Encap™ (VC-01™)|work=Viacyte, Inc.|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; After surgical implantation in an outpatient procedure, the cells mature into endocrine cells which arrange in islet-like clusters and mimic the function of the pancreas, producing insulin and glucagon.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://viacyte.com/|title=Home|work=Viacyte, Inc.|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schulz TC | title = Concise Review: Manufacturing of Pancreatic Endoderm Cells for Clinical Trials in Type 1 Diabetes | journal = Stem Cells Translational Medicine | volume = 4 | issue = 8 | pages = 927–31 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 26062982 | pmc = 4511151 | doi = 10.5966/sctm.2015-0058 }}&lt;/ref&gt;The technology advanced from pre-clinical studies to FDA approval for phase 1 clinical trials in 2014, and presented two-year data from the trial in June 2018.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; They reported that their product, called PEC-Encap, has so far been safe and well tolerated in patients at a dose below therapeutic levels. The encapsulated cells were able to survive and mature after implantation, and immune system rejection was decreased due to the protective membrane. The second phase of the trial will evaluate the efficacy of the product.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; ViaCyte has also been receiving financial support from JDRF on this project.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

==Initiatives around the globe==
In the United States in 2006, JDRF (formerly the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation) launched a multi-year initiative to help accelerate the development, regulatory approval, and acceptance of continuous glucose monitoring and artificial pancreas technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jdrf.org/artificialpancreas Artificial Pancreas Project : JDRF&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statnews.com/2017/08/10/type-1-diabetes-insurance-companies/|title=Insurers can profit while improving the lives of people with type 1 diabetes|last=KMorandi says|date=2017-08-10|website=STAT|access-date=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grassroots efforts to create and commercialize a fully automated artificial pancreas system have also arisen directly from patient advocates and the diabetes community.&lt;ref&gt;Hurley, Dan (24 December 2014) [https://www.wired.com/2014/12/diabetes-patients-hacking-together-diy-bionic-pancreases/] WIRED Magazine, Diabetes Patients Are Hacking Their Way Toward a Bionic Pancreas&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bigfoot Biomedical]], a company founded by parents of children with T1D have created algorithms and are developing a closed loop device that monitor blood sugar and appropriately provide insulin.&lt;ref&gt;Knutson, Ryan (8 June 2015) [https://www.wsj.com/articles/computer-experts-deliver-insulin-to-diabetic-kids-1433805697] The Wall Street Journal, Computer Experts Deliver Insulin to Diabetic Kids&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10130">The '''behavioral immune system''' is a phrase coined by the psychological scientist [[Mark Schaller]] to refer to a suite of psychological mechanisms that allow individual organisms to detect the potential presence of disease-causing [[parasite]]s in their immediate environment, and to engage in behaviors that prevent contact with those objects and individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1207/s15327965pli1702_2 |last=Schaller |first=M. |year=2006 |title=Parasites, behavioral defenses, and the social psychological mechanisms through which cultures are evoked |journal=Psychological Inquiry |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages= 96–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sd2007"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schaller |first=M. |author2=Duncan, L.A. |title=Evolution and the social mind: Evolutionary psychology and social cognition |editor=J.P. Forgas, M.G. Haselton &amp; W. von Hippel |publisher=Psychology Press |location=New York |year=2007 |pages=293–307 |chapter=The behavioral immune system: Its evolution and social psychological implications}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0963721411402596 |last=Schaller |first=M. |author2=Park, J.H. |year=2011 |title=The behavioral immune system (and why it matters) |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=99–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These mechanisms include sensory processes through which cues connoting the presence of parasitic infections are perceived (e.g., the smell of a foul odor, the sight of [[Acne scarring|pox]] or [[pustules]]), as well as [[stimulus–response]] systems through which these sensory cues trigger a cascade of aversive affective, cognitive, and behavioral reactions (e.g., arousal of [[disgust]], automatic activation of cognitions that connote the threat of disease, behavioral avoidance).&lt;ref name="sd2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Oaten |first=M. |author2=Stevenson, R.J. |author3=Case, T.I. |date=March 2009 |title=Disgust as a disease–avoidance mechanism |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=135 |issue=2 |pages=303–21 |doi=10.1037/a0014823 |pmid=19254082}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of a behavioral immune system has been documented across many animal species, including humans. It is theorized that the mechanisms that comprise the behavioral immune system evolved as a crude first line of defense against disease-causing pathogens.&lt;ref name="sd2007"/&gt;

==Implications for human behavior==
Within the [[psychological sciences]], there is extensive research linking the behavioral immune system to a variety of prejudices—including prejudices against people who aren't actually diseased but are simply characterized by some sort of visual characteristics that deviate from those of a subjectively prototypical human being. The disease–avoidant processes that characterize the behavioral immune system have been shown to contribute to prejudices against [[obese]] individuals, [[elderly]] individuals, and people with physical disfigurements or [[disabilities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Park |first=J.H. |author2=Faulkner, J. |author3=Schaller, M. |date=June 2003 |title=Evolved disease-avoidance processes and contemporary anti-social behavior: Prejudicial attitudes and avoidance of people with physical disabilities |journal= Journal of Nonverbal Behavior |publisher=Springer Netherlands |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=65–87 |issn=1573-3653 |doi=10.1023/A:1023910408854 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/l147k15h81282134/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Park |first=J. |author2=Schaller, M. |author3=Crandall, C.S. |year=2007 |title=Pathogen-avoidance mechanisms and the stigmatization of obese people |journal=Evolution and Human Behavior |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=410–4 |url=http://www.psych.ubc.ca/~schaller/ParkSchallerCrandall2007.pdf |doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2007.05.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Duncan |first=L.A. |author2=Schaller, M. |date=October 27, 2009 |title=Prejudicial Attitudes Toward Older Adults May Be Exaggerated When People Feel Vulnerable to Infectious Disease: Evidence and Implications |journal=Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy |publisher=The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=97–115 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122665436/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 |doi=10.1111/j.1530-2415.2009.01188.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the behavioral immune system appears to contribute to [[xenophobia]] and [[ethnocentrism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Faulkner |first=J. |author2=Schaller, M. |author3=Park, J.H. |author4= Duncan, L.A.  |year=2004 |title=Evolved Disease–Avoidance Mechanisms and Contemporary Xenophobic Attitudes |journal=Group Processes and Intergroup Relations |volume=7 |issue=4 |doi=10.1177/1368430204046142 |pages=333–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Navarrete |first=C.D. |author2=D.

Additional lines of research on the behavioral immune system have shown that people engage in more reticent and conservative forms of behavior under conditions in which they feel more vulnerable to disease transmission. For instance, when the potential threat of disease is made salient, people tend to be less extraverted or sociable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0956797610361706 |last=Mortensen |first=C.R. |author2=Becker, D.V. |author3=Ackerman, J.M. |author4=Neuberg, S.L. |author5=Kenrick, D.T. |year=2010 |title=Infection breeds reticence: The effects of disease salience on self-perceptions of personality and behavioral tendencies |journal=Psychological Science |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=440–7 |pmid=20424082}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence suggests that the behavioral immune system also incorporates mechanisms designed to search out and process (heuristic) signs of disease at the level of basic visual attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2008.12.008 |last=Ackerman |first=J.M. |author2=Becker, D.V. |author3=Mortensen, C.R. |author4=Sasaki, T. |author5=Neuberg, S.L.  |author6=Kenrick, D.T. |year=2009 |title=A pox on the mind: Disjunction of attention and memory in the processing of physical disfigurement |journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages= 478–85 |url=http://web.mit.edu/joshack/www/Ackerman_Pox-on-the-mind2009.pdf |pmid=19578547 |pmc=2699287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications for human culture==
The behavioral immune system also has consequences at a [[cultural]] level of analysis. Under ecological circumstances in which diseases are more prevalent, people also tend to display more reticent and socially restricted forms of behavior, and human cultures are defined by more conservative norms and value systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fincher |first=C.L. |author2=Thornhill, R. |author3=Murray, D.R. |author4= Schaller, M.  |year=2008 |title=Pathogen prevalence predicts human cross-cultural variability in individualism/collectivism |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B |volume=275 |issue=1640 |pages=1279–85 |pmid=18302996 |url=http://www.psych.ubc.ca/~schaller/FincherThornhillMurraySchaller2008.pdf |doi=10.1098/rspb.2008.0094 |pmc=2602680}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schaller |first=M. |author2=Murray, D.R. |date=July 2008 |title=Pathogens, personality, and culture: Disease prevalence predicts worldwide variability in sociosexuality, extraversion, and openness to experience |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=95 |issue=1 |pages=212–21 |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=2008-08084-014&amp;CFID=5418322&amp;CFTOKEN=19787463 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.95.1.212 |pmid=18605861}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications for immunology==
Some research suggests that the behavioral immune system has implications for the functioning of the physiological [[immune system]] too. One study found that the mere visual perception of diseased-looking people stimulated white blood cells to respond more aggressively to infection (as indicated by the production of the proinflammatory [[cytokine]] [[Interleukin 6]] in response to a bacterial stimulus).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schaller |first=M. |author2=Miller, G.E. |author3=Gervais, W.M. |author4=Yager, S. |author5= Chen, E.  |year=2010 |title=Mere visual perception of other people's disease symptoms facilitates a more aggressive immune response |journal=Psychological Science |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=649–52 |pmid=20483842 |url=http://www.psych.ubc.ca/~schaller/SchallerMillerGervaisYagerChen2010.pdf |doi=10.1177/0956797610368064}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research also indicates that immune-relevant interventions which target pathogen transmission can interrupt behavioral responses. For example, receiving a flu vaccination or washing one's hands can reduce the extent of negative interpersonal and intergroup attitudes elicited by disease cues and concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Huang|first=J.Y. |author2=Sedlovskaya, A. |author3=Ackerman, J.M. |author4= Bargh, J.A.  |year=2011 |title=Immunizing Against Prejudice: Effects of Disease Protection on Attitudes Toward Out-Groups |journal=Psychological Science |volume=22 |issue=12 |pages=1550–56 |pmid=22058107 |doi=10.1177/0956797611417261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Beverley Ussher''' (born [[Melbourne]] 1868; died Melbourne, 9 June 1908) was articled to Melbourne architect '''Alfred Dunn'''. Dunn was English and had worked for architect Alexander Lauder in Barnstaple, Devon, where he worked with [[Arts and Crafts movement]] theorist and practitioner W.R. Lethaby. Through Dunn's English connections, when Ussher completed his architecture articles in Melbourne, he visited England and was introduced to architect Walter Butler. Later Ussher and Butler formed a partnership in Melbourne.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Australian Architecture: p.726 'Ussher and Kemp'&lt;/ref&gt;

Ussher's first architectural partner, Walter Richmond Butler (1864–1949), was an English architect who worked in London as chief assistant to ecclesiastical architect [[J. D. Sedding]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Australian Architecture: p.128 'Walter Butler'&lt;/ref&gt;  Butler was accepted into the [[Arts and Crafts]] and Domestic Revival circles centred on [[William Morris]] and [[Richard Norman Shaw]], among whom his closest friend was [[Ernest Gimson]] (1864–1919).

In June 1888 Butler left Sedding's office and sailed for Australia, perhaps at the prompting of young architect Beverley Ussher then visiting London. Three of Butler's brothers and one of his sisters also settled in Australia. From 1889 until 1893 Butler was in partnership with Ussher. In 1896 they were joined by George C. Inskip but they parted in 1905 after a dispute with the Royal Victorian Institute of Architects over the conduct of a competition.

Beverley Ussher and Henry (Hardie) Kemp (born [[Broughton, Lancashire]], UK, 10 March 1859; died Melbourne, 22 April 1946) then formed a partnership in Melbourne in 1899, which lasted until Ussher's death (1908). This "brilliant partnership" pioneered the Australian [[Federation architecture|Federation style]] of [[domestic architecture]]. Both Ussher and Kemp had strong Arts and Crafts commitments, and both had been in partnerships before forming their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/ussher-kemp-2|title=Answers - The Most Trusted Place for Answering Life's Questions|website=Answers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice specialised in domestic work and their houses epitomise the [[Marseilles]]-tiled [[Queen Anne style architecture|Queen Anne]] (or [[Federation style]]) houses characteristic of Melbourne, and considered now to be a truly distinctive Australian genre.
At the time of their creation they were a break with the use of cement [[Cement render|render]], applied [[stucco]] [[ornament (art)|ornament]], [[cast iron]], [[slate]]s, and double hung [[window]]s.
Their designs use red bricks, [[terracotta]] [[tiles]] and [[casement window|casement]] [[window]]s, avoid applied [[ornament (art)|ornament]]ation and develop substantial timber details. The [[picturesque]] character of the houses results from a [[conscious]] [[attempt]] to express externally with [[gable]]s, [[dormers]], [[bays]], roof axes, and [[chimneys]], the functional variety of [[rooms]] within.

The [[iconic]] [[Federation style]] houses by Beverley Ussher and Henry Kemp did not appear until 1892-4. Then, several of those appeared in [[Boroondara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.boroondara.vic.gov.au/freestyler/files/Review%20of%20B-graded%20buildings%20Vol%203_4b7df9006dcde.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=26 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326053404/http://www.boroondara.vic.gov.au/freestyler/files/Review%20of%20B-graded%20buildings%20Vol%203_4b7df9006dcde.pdf |archive-date=26 March 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Dalswraith''' for William Gibson, 99 Studley Park Road, Kew (1906) and a house for A. Norman, 7 Adeney Avenue, Kew (1908) are superb examples of his designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/kemp-henry-hardie-6925|title=Australian Dictionary of Biography|first=George|last=Tibbits|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|via=Australian Dictionary of Biography}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"George Tibbits has discussed this [[firm]] at great length in his [[article (publishing)|article]] "The so-called Melbourne Domestic Queen Anne".&lt;ref&gt;'The so-called 'Melbourne domestic Queen Anne', by George Tibbits in ''[[Historic Environment]]'', Vol.2, no. 2, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; It was undoubtably one of the most accomplished and prolific of the Melbourne practices of the early twentieth century. It drew on a distinguished line of work by the individual partners from the nineteenth century."&lt;ref&gt;City of Malvern Heritage Study, Appendix One, architects of Malvern&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ussher &amp; Butler ==
Butler and Ussher worked together on a series of designs between 1890 and 1893, many of which are  considered to be outstanding examples of the [[Picturesque]] [[Aesthetic]].

George Tibbits, in an article titled 'The So-Called Melbourne Domestic Queen Anne' describes Blackwood Homestead as being 'one of the finest 19th century examples' of this type.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vhd.heritage.vic.gov.au/places/show_history/23171 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ussher in solo practice ==
Beverley Ussher designed the house 'Milliara' (John Whiting house) in Wallace Avenue. Toorak, in about 1895. It seemed very anglophile in that it had a drawing room ceiling which exactly reproduced of the dining hall ceiling at Bolsover Castle, which Ussher had himself measured and drawn. However the architraves of the arches were decorated with local flora, and the panelling used Australian timbers.

Two years later the emphasis on local timber was even greater in Ussher's house for J C Foden in Canterbury: "The whole of the woodwork of the drawing room, dining room, hall, stairs and landing, including the sliding doors, was carried out in Australian and New Zealand woods, such as silky oak, blackwood, fiddleback and kauri, and then French polished."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mileslewis.net/australian-building/pdf/05-timber-frame/timber-frame-naturalism.pdf page 5.08.6]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ussher &amp; Kemp==
'''Houses'''
Ussher &amp; Kemp are said to have been responsible for nearly every impressive Federation Queen Anne style house in the eastern suburbs of [[Kew, Victoria|Kew]], [[Hawthorn, Victoria|Hawthorn]] and [[Camberwell, Victoria|Camberwell]]. 

Ussher's work falls into two categories:
 
Gabled designs, usually large two-storey houses where gables project from an overall hipped roof. In general, Ussher's largest houses (such as Dalwraith in [[Kew]] of 1906), adopt the gabled form. 

Single storey designs, the large, spreading multi-gabled form that developed into the distinctive [[Queen Anne style architecture|Queen Anne style]] the dominant house style in the first decade of the twentieth century. Seminal examples by Assher &amp; Kemp include the Hedges House in [[Canterbury]] and the Clarke house in [[Toorak, Victoria|Toorak]], both of 1897.

Together Ussher &amp; Kemp developed this style with, characteristically featuring tall Marseilles tiled hipped roofs, timber [[verandah]] decorations, and a strongly three-dimensional form with emphasis.

The Queen Anne style combined with some of the principles of Australian homestead planning and design around the turn of the century, to produce a new suburban style continuing to the end of World War One and is sometimes loosely referred to as [[Edwardian architecture|Edwardian]] or Federation.

Queen Anne style had an ongoing influence on [[Vernacular architecture|vernacular design]] which can be seen up to the 1960s.

The domestic Queen Anne style buildings which survive from the turn of the century had a vital role in the development of the urban form of metropolis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/ahdb/search.pl?mode=place_detail;search=state%3DVIC%3Bkeyword%3DUssher%2520and%2520Kemp%3Bkeyword_PD%3Don%3Bkeyword_SS%3Don%3Bkeyword_PH%3Don%3Blatitude_1dir%3DS%3Blongitude_1dir%3DE%3Blongitude_2dir%3DE%3Blatitude_2dir%3DS%3Bin_region%3Dpart;place_id=100038 |title=Australian Heritage Database |publisher=Environment.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Arden''' 1045 Burke Rd [[Hawthorn East]], VIC, (1906)
Architecturally significant for: its adaptation of Queen Anne style to a tight site; the complexity of its elevation and [[planning]]; the use of the unusual splayed corner on a Queen Anne style design; and for the outstanding fence, rare on Queen Anne-style houses throughout Metropolitan Melbourne.
* '''Avondale''' 22 Berkeley St Hawthorn, VIC, Australia.  Built during [[Hawthorn, Victoria|Hawthorn]]'s period of [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] prosperity for grocer, Benjamin Ratcliffe, this substantial brick residence was rated first in 1903–04 as a brick house of eleven rooms, unfinished, Net Annual Value 90 pounds. The previous year, the site had been vacant land. The [[Real estate appraisal|valuation]] went up to 100 pounds in 1907, when the property of eleven rooms was known as Avondale and occupied still by the Ratcliffe family. 
* '''Carramah''', 31 Canterbury Road, Camberwell, Vic 3124
"A magnificent landmark residence"
Built Circa 1909 for Herbert Parsons a [[spice trade]]r and set on a magnificent allotment (2,089sqm) with superbly landscaped and maintained gardens, this landmark residence showcases the elegance and graciousness of classic Ussher &amp; Kemp architecture, whilst providing unparalleled family living and entertaining areas both inside and outside.
* '''Coorinyah House''' 150 Mont Albert Road Canterbury (1899)
Architects Ussher &amp; Kemp acted for Mellor when the house was connected to the MMBW sewer, in 1907, and it appears that they were also the designers.
At Coorinyah, the broad hipped roof is the dominant backdrop for a number of gabled roof forms, chimneys and the unusual [[Roof shingle|shingle]]-spired [[look-out]], with its attached [[chimney]]. Below the eaves line giant arched timber supports spring between gabled [[verandah]] or room bays, almost removing the visual support for the large roof expanses above it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.architecture.com.au/i-cms_file?page=4048/20thCenturyRegister.htm|title=404|website=www.architecture.com.au|access-date=6 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180619012715/http://www.architecture.com.au/i-cms_file?page=4048%2F20thCenturyRegister.htm|archive-date=19 June 2018|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wee Nestie is placed askew on its owner site, it is aligned, unlike its neighbours, neither [[perpendicularly]] nor diagonally to the street. A large indented [[gate]]way was at a comer [[Chamfer|splay]] in the allotment and an asphalt tennis court on the west of the house.
Architects, Ussher &amp; Kemp, designed this nine-room Queen Anne styled house for importer, William Halsey in 1900. G. Garrett was the builder. Later owners included J.R Wood and P.R Kershaw; the latter converting, Wee Nestie to Karinyah private hospital in 1959.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Camberwell Conservation Study 1991 p 40&lt;/ref&gt;

Architecturally significant at the State level as one of Ussher and Kemps' best and most sophisticated designs, integrating unusual brick detailing and an atypical symmetrical arrangement.
The architects Ussher and Kemp designed the imposing Edwardian villa at 98 Riversdale Road in 1899 for George and Mary Ann Thyssen.
* [http://federation-house.wikispaces.com/Architects+Ussher+and+Kemp House and Surgery], 169 [[Canterbury Road]], [[Canterbury]]
169 [[Canterbury Road]] is one of the more prominent designs by the renowned residential partnership of Ussher and Kemp at a time when the practice was at its peak. It compares directly – and favourably – with other leading designs of theirs, particularly among their two-storey houses, and is a direct predecessor to Kemp's renowned '''Dalswraith''' in Kew.
* '''Kurue''' 114 Bellair St Kensington, VIC, Australia

Architecturally, a near original prominent and early example of a common suburban style, designed by the Queen Anne Villa specialists Ussher and Kemp: of metropolitan importance. Historically, for a long period one of the few sources of medical attention in the local community: of local importance.
* '''Norman House''', 7 Adeney Avenue, Kew (1908)
Built between 1901 and 1910 to the designs of architects Ussher and Kemp, the '''Norman House''' is a fine example of the hip roofed genre of the so-called Melbourne [[Queen Anne style architecture|Queen Anne style]] house and one of the most representative works emanating from Melbourne's most renowned firm of residential architects at the time of Federation.

* '''Marlborough House''' 8–10 Back Beach Rd Portsea, VIC, Australia
An essentially intact well-designed and detailed example of the Federation style, Marlborough House was constructed in local materials. It exhibits the regional motif of tuck-pointed red brick quoins to a limestone building. Important architectural features such as the timber verandah with original posts, balustrade fretwork, brackets and floor, twin gable ends with infill strapwork, limestone brackets and intact joinery remain.

The Professional Chambers building in [[Collins Street, Melbourne|Collins Street]] was designed for the Trustees of the Independent Church by Beverley Ussher of the firm Ussher and Kemp. The building was finished in 1908, the year Ussher died.

The three-storey red brick structure with [[attic]] is styled in a mode eclectically derived from [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque Revival]], [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]], [[Tudor Revival architecture|Elizabethan Revival]] and Queen Anne Revival architecture.

The construction is of tuck-pointed face red brick decorated with rendered cement dressings and a [[terra cotta]] tile roof. The [[Picturesque]] roof line with steep [[gable]] ends and tall clustered [[chimneys]], the [[oriel window|oriel]] windows and central round [[arch]] Romanesque entry with [[Trefoil|foliated]] [[House painter and decorator|decoration]] together produces a bold facade to [[Collins Street, Melbourne|Collins Street]].

'''Constructivism''' was an [[art]]istic and [[architecture|architectural]] philosophy that originated in [[Russia]] beginning in 1913 by [[Vladimir Tatlin]]. This was a rejection of the idea of autonomous art. He wanted 'to construct' art. The movement was in favour of art as a practice for social purposes. Constructivism had a great effect on modern art movements of the 20th century, influencing major trends such as the [[Bauhaus]] and [[De Stijl]] movements. Its influence was widespread, with major effects upon architecture, [[sculpture]], [[graphic design]], [[industrial design]], theatre, film, dance, fashion and to some extent music.

==Beginnings==

The term ''Construction Art'' was first used as a derisive term by [[Kazimir Malevich]] to describe the work of [[Alexander Rodchenko]] in 1917.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}  Constructivism first appears as a positive term in [[Naum Gabo]]'s ''[[Realistic Manifesto]]'' of 1920. [[Aleksei Gan]] used the word as the title of his book ''Constructivism'', printed in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Cooke, ''Russian Avant-Garde: Theories of Art, Architecture and the City'', Academy Editions, 1995, page 106.&lt;/ref&gt; Constructivism was a post-World War I development of [[Russian Futurism]], and particularly of the 'counter reliefs' of [[Vladimir Tatlin]], which had been exhibited in 1915. The term itself would be invented by the sculptors [[Antoine Pevsner]] and [[Naum Gabo]], who developed an industrial, angular style of work, while its geometric abstraction owed something to the [[Suprematism]] of Kazimir Malevich.

Constructivism as theory and practice was derived largely from a series of debates at the Institute of Artistic Culture ([[INKhUK]]) in Moscow, from 1920 to 1922. After deposing its first chairman, [[Wassily Kandinsky]], for his 'mysticism', The First Working Group of Constructivists (including [[Liubov Popova]], [[Alexander Vesnin]], [[Rodchenko]], [[Varvara Stepanova]], and the theorists [[Aleksei Gan]], [[Boris Arvatov]] and [[Osip Brik]]) would develop a definition of Constructivism as the combination of ''[[faktura]]'': the particular material properties of an object, and ''tektonika'', its spatial presence. Initially the Constructivists worked on three-dimensional constructions as a means of participating in industry: the OBMOKhU (Society of Young Artists) exhibition showed these three dimensional compositions, by Rodchenko, Stepanova, [[Karl Ioganson]] and the [[Stenberg brothers]]. Later the definition would be extended to designs for two-dimensional works such as books or posters, with ''montage'' and ''factography'' becoming important concepts.

==Art in the service of the Revolution==
[[Image:Plakat mayakowski gross.jpg|thumb|right|Agitprop poster by Mayakovsky]] 
As much as involving itself in designs for industry, the Constructivists worked on public festivals and street designs for the post-October revolution Bolshevik government. Perhaps the most famous of these was in [[Vitebsk]], where Malevich's [[UNOVIS]] Group painted propaganda plaques and buildings (the best known being [[El Lissitzky]]'s poster ''[[Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge]]'' (1919)). Inspired by [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]]'s declaration 'the streets our brushes, the squares our palettes', artists and designers participated in public life during the Civil War. A striking instance was the proposed festival for the [[Comintern]] congress in 1921 by Alexander Vesnin and Liubov Popova, which resembled the constructions of the OBMOKhU exhibition as well as their work for the theatre. There was a great deal of overlap during this period between Constructivism and [[Proletkult]], the ideas of which concerning the need to create an entirely new culture struck a chord with the Constructivists. In addition some Constructivists were heavily involved in the 'ROSTA Windows', a Bolshevik public information campaign of around 1920. Some of the most famous of these were by the poet-painter Vladimir Mayakovsky and Vladimir Lebedev.

The constructivists tried to create works that would make the viewer an active viewer of the artwork. In this it had similarities with the [[Russian Formalists]]' theory of 'making strange', and accordingly their main theorist [[Viktor Shklovsky]] worked closely with the Constructivists, as did other formalists like the Arch Bishop. These theories were tested in theatre, particularly with the work of [[Vsevolod Meyerhold]], who had established what he called 'October in the theatre'. Meyerhold developed a 'biomechanical' acting style, which was influenced both by the circus and by the 'scientific management' theories of [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]]. Meanwhile, the stage sets by the likes of Vesnin, Popova and Stepanova tested Constructivist spatial ideas in a public form. A more populist version of this was developed by [[Alexander Tairov]], with stage sets by [[Aleksandra Ekster]] and the Stenberg brothers. These ideas would influence German directors like [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Erwin Piscator]], as well as the early Soviet cinema.

==Tatlin, 'Construction Art' and Productivism==
The key work of Constructivism was Vladimir Tatlin's proposal for the [[Tatlin's Tower|Monument to the Third International]] (Tatlin's Tower) (1919–20)&lt;ref name=HF&gt;[[Hugh Honour|Honour, H.]] and Fleming, J. (2009) ''A World History of Art''. 7th edn. London: Laurence King Publishing, p. 819. {{ISBN|9781856695848}}&lt;/ref&gt; which combined a machine aesthetic with dynamic components celebrating technology such as searchlights and projection screens. Gabo publicly criticized Tatlin's design saying, "Either create functional houses and bridges or create pure art, not both."  This had already caused a major controversy in the Moscow group in 1920 when Gabo and Pevsner's ''[[Realistic Manifesto]]'' asserted a spiritual core for the movement. This was opposed to the utilitarian and adaptable version of Constructivism held by Tatlin and Rodchenko. Tatlin's work was immediately hailed by artists in Germany as a revolution in art: a 1920 photograph shows [[George Grosz]] and [[John Heartfield]] holding a placard saying 'Art is Dead – Long Live Tatlin's Machine Art', while the designs for the tower were published in [[Bruno Taut]]'s magazine ''Fruhlicht''. The tower was never built, however, due to a lack of money following the revolution.&lt;ref name=Janson&gt;[[H. W. Janson|Janson, H.W.]] (1995) ''History of Art''. 5th edn. Revised and expanded by Anthony F. Janson. London: [[Thames &amp; Hudson]], p. 820. {{ISBN|0500237018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tatlin's tower started a period of exchange of ideas between Moscow and Berlin, something reinforced by El Lissitzky and [[Ilya Ehrenburg]]'s Soviet-German magazine ''Veshch-Gegenstand-Objet'' which spread the idea of 'Construction art', as did the Constructivist exhibits at the 1922 ''Russische Ausstellung'' in Berlin, organised by Lissitzky. A [[Constructivist International]] was formed, which met with Dadaists and De Stijl artists in Germany in 1922. Participants in this short-lived international included Lissitzky, [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]], and [[László Moholy-Nagy]]. However the idea of 'art' was becoming anathema to the Russian Constructivists: the INKhUK debates of 1920–22 had culminated in the theory of [[Productivism]] propounded by Osip Brik and others, which demanded direct participation in industry and the end of easel painting. Tatlin was one of the first to attempt to transfer his talents to industrial production, with his designs for an economical stove, for workers' overalls and for furniture. The Utopian element in Constructivism was maintained by his 'letatlin', a flying machine which he worked on until the 1930s.

==Constructivism and consumerism==
In 1921, the [[New Economic Policy]] was established in the Soviet Union, which opened up more market opportunities in the Soviet economy. Rodchenko, Stepanova, and others made advertising for the co-operatives that were now in competition with other commercial businesses. The poet-artist Vladimir Mayakovsky and Rodchenko worked together and called themselves "''advertising constructors''". Together they designed eye-catching images featuring bright colours, geometric shapes, and bold lettering.  The lettering of most of these designs was intended to create a reaction, and function emotionally – most were designed for the state-owned department store [[Mosselprom]] in Moscow, for pacifiers, cooking oil, beer and other quotidian products, with Mayakovsky claiming that his 'nowhere else but Mosselprom' verse was one of the best he ever wrote. 
Additionally, several artists tried to work with clothes design with varying success: Varvara Stepanova designed dresses with bright, geometric patterns that were mass-produced, although workers' overalls by Tatlin and Rodchenko never achieved this and remained prototypes. The painter and designer [[Lyubov Popova]] designed a kind of Constructivist [[flapper]] dress before her early death in 1924, the plans for which were published in the journal ''[[LEF (journal)|LEF]]''. In these works, Constructivists showed a willingness to involve themselves in fashion and the mass market, which they tried to balance with their Communist beliefs.

==LEF and Constructivist cinema==
[[Image:Aelita screenshot.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Constructivist Martian set in ''[[Aelita]]'' (1924)]]
The Soviet Constructivists organised themselves in the 1920s into the 'Left Front of the Arts',  who produced the influential journal ''LEF'', (which had two series, from 1923–5 and from 1927–9 as ''New LEF''). LEF was dedicated to maintaining the avant-garde against the critiques of the incipient [[Socialist Realism]], and the possibility of a capitalist restoration, with the journal being particularly scathing about the 'NEPmen', the capitalists of the period. For LEF the new medium of cinema was more important than the easel painting and traditional narratives that elements of the Communist Party were trying to revive then. Important Constructivists were very involved with cinema, with Mayakovsky acting in the film ''The Young Lady and the Hooligan'' (1919), Rodchenko's designs for the intertitles and animated sequences of [[Dziga Vertov]]'s ''Kino Eye'' (1924), and [[Aleksandra Ekster]] designs for the sets and costumes of the science fiction film ''[[Aelita]]'' (1924).

The Productivist theorists Osip Brik and [[Sergei Tretyakov (writer)|Sergei Tretyakov]] also wrote screenplays and intertitles, for films such as [[Vsevolod Pudovkin]]'s ''Storm over Asia'' (1928) or Victor Turin's ''Turksib'' (1929). The filmmakers and LEF contributors Dziga Vertov and [[Sergei Eisenstein]] as well as the documentarist [[Esfir Shub]] also regarded their fast-cut, montage style of filmmaking as Constructivist. The early [[Eccentrist]] movies of  [[Grigori Kozintsev]] and [[Leonid Trauberg]] (''[[The New Babylon]]'', ''[[Alone (1931 film)|Alone]]'') had similarly avant-garde intentions, as well as a fixation on jazz-age America which was characteristic of the philosophy, with its praise of slapstick-comedy actors like [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Buster Keaton]], as well as of [[Fordist]] mass production. Like the photomontages and designs of Constructivism, early [[Soviet film|Soviet cinema]] concentrated on creating an agitational effect by montage and 'making strange'.

==Photography and photomontage==
The Constructivists were early developers of the techniques of [[photomontage]]. Gustav Klutsis' 'Dynamic City' and 'Lenin and Electrification' (1919–20) are the first examples of this method of montage, which had in common with [[Dadaism]] the collaging together of news photographs and painted sections. However Constructivist montages would be less 'destructive' than those of Dadaism. Perhaps the most famous of these montages was Rodchenko's illustrations of the Mayakovsky poem ''About This''.

LEF also helped popularise a distinctive style of photography, involving jagged angles and contrasts and an abstract use of light, which paralleled the work of [[László Moholy-Nagy]] in Germany: the major practitioners of this included, along with Rodchenko, [[Boris Ignatovich]] and [[Max Penson]], among others. This also shared many characteristics with the early documentary movement.

==Constructivist graphic design==
[[File:'Proun Vrashchenia' by El Lissitzky, ca. 1919.jpg|thumb|'Proun Vrashchenia' by [[El Lissitzky]], 1919]]
The book designs of Rodchenko, El Lissitzky and others such as [[Solomon Telingater]] and [[Anton Lavinsky]] were a major inspiration for the work of radical designers in the West, particularly [[Jan Tschichold]]. Many Constructivists worked on the design of posters for everything from cinema to political propaganda: the former represented best by the brightly coloured, geometric posters of the Stenberg brothers (Georgii and Vladimir Stenberg), and the latter by the agitational photomontage work of [[Gustav Klutsis]] and [[Valentina Kulagina]].

In [[Cologne]] in the late 1920s [[Figurative Constructivism]] emerged from the [[Cologne Progressives]], a group which had links with Russian Constructivists, particularly Lissitzky, since the early twenties. Through their collaboration with [[Otto Neurath]] and the [[Gesellschafts- und Wirtschaftsmuseum]] such artists as [[Gerd Antz]], [[Augustin Tschinkel]] and [[Peter Alma]] they affected the development of the [[Isotype (picture language)|Vienna Method]]. This link was most clearly shown in ''A bis Z'' a journal published by [[Franz Seiwert]] the principal theorist of the group.&lt;ref&gt;Benus B. (2013) 'Figurative Constructivism and sociological graphics' in ''Isotype: Design and Contexts 1925-71'' London: Hyphen Press, pp.216-248&lt;/ref&gt; They were active in Russia working with [[IZOSTAT]] and Tschinkel worked with [[Ladislav Sutnar ]] before he emigrated to the US.

The Constructivists' main early political patron was [[Leon Trotsky]], and it began to be regarded with suspicion after the expulsion of Trotsky and the Left Opposition in 1927-8. The [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] would gradually favour realist art during the course of the 1920s (as early as 1918 ''[[Pravda]]'' had complained that government funds were being used to buy works by untried artists). However it was not until about 1934 that the counter-doctrine of [[Socialist Realism]] was instituted in Constructivism's place. Many Constructivists continued to produce avantgarde work in the service of the state, such as Lissitzky, Rodchenko and Stepanova's designs for the magazine ''[[USSR In Construction]]''.

==Constructivist architecture==
{{main|Constructivist architecture}}

Constructivist architecture emerged from the wider constructivist art movement. After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] it turned its attentions to the new social demands and industrial tasks required of the new regime. Two distinct threads emerged, the first was encapsulated in Antoine Pevsner's and Naum Gabo's ''[[Realist manifesto]]'' which was concerned with space and rhythm, the second represented a struggle within the [[Narkompros|Commissariat for Enlightenment]] between those who argued for ''pure art'' and the [[Productivism (art)|Productivists]] such as Alexander Rodchenko, Varvara Stepanova and Vladimir Tatlin, a more socially oriented group who wanted this art to be absorbed in industrial production.&lt;ref name="thought"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Oliver Stallybrass | first = and Alan Bullock (et al.) | title = The Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought | year = 1988 | type = Paperback | publisher = Fontana press | isbn = 0-00-686129-6 | page = 918 pages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A split occurred in 1922 when Pevsner and Gabo emigrated. The movement then developed along socially [[utilitarian]] lines. The productivist majority gained the support of the [[Proletkult]] and the magazine LEF, and later became the dominant influence of the architectural group [[OSA Group|O.S.A.]], directed by [[Alexander Vesnin]] and [[Moisei Ginzburg]].

==Legacy==
A number of Constructivists would teach or lecture at the [[Bauhaus]] schools in Germany, and some of the VKhUTEMAS teaching methods were adopted and developed there. Gabo established a version of Constructivism in England during the 1930s and 1940s that was adopted by architects, designers and artists after World War I (see [[Victor Pasmore]]), and [[John McHale (artist)|John McHale]].  [[Joaquín Torres García]] and [[Manuel Rendón]] were instrumental in spreading Constructivism throughout Europe and Latin America.  Constructivism had an effect on the modern masters of Latin America such as: [[Carlos Mérida]], [[Enrique Tábara]], [[Aníbal Villacís]], [[Theo Constanté]], [[Oswaldo Viteri]],  [[Estuardo Maldonado]], [[Luis Molinari]], [[Carlos Catasse]], [[João Batista Vilanova Artigas]] and [[Oscar Niemeyer]], to name just a few. There have also been disciples in Australia, the painter [[George Johnson (artist)|George Johnson]] being the best known.

In the 1980s graphic designer [[Neville Brody]] used styles based on Constructivist posters that initiated a revival of popular interest. Also during the 1980s designer Ian Anderson founded [[The Designers Republic]], a successful and influential design company which used constructivist principles.

So-called [[Deconstructivism|Deconstructivist]] architecture was developed by architects [[Zaha Hadid]], [[Rem Koolhaas]] and others during the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Zaha Hadid by her sketches and drawings of abstract triangles and rectangles evokes the aesthetic of constructivism. Though similar formally, the socialist political connotations of Russian constructivism are deemphasized by Hadid's deconstructivism. Rem Koolhaas' projects revive another aspect of constructivism. The [[scaffold]] and [[Crane (machine)|crane]]-like structures represented by many constructivist architects are used for the finished forms of his designs and buildings.

The geological evidence appeared to constrain temperatures to the red/blue band, whereas models produced the brown line taking just continental configuration into account, and the blue line when they included increased atmospheric {{co2}}.

The '''cool tropics paradox''' refers to an apparent difference between modeled estimates of [[tropics|tropical]] [[temperature]]s during warm, ice-free periods of the [[Cretaceous]] and [[Eocene]], and the colder temperatures which proxies suggested were present. The long-standing paradox was resolved when novel proxy derived temperatures showed significantly warmer tropics during past greenhouse climates. The low-gradient problem, i.e. the very warm polar regions with respect to present day, is still an issue for state-of-the-art climate models.

==Origin of the paradox==
[[Proxy (climate)|Proxy]]-based reconstructions of [[paleotemperature]] appeared to predict a low temperature gradient between the tropics and [[polar region|poles]]. Data from surface-dwelling [[foramanifera]] suggested that during the late Cretaceous, an unusually warm period, [[sea surface temperature]]s were cooler than today's.&lt;ref name="D'hondt1996"&gt;{{cite journal
 | author = D'hondt, S.
 | author2=Arthur, M.A.
 | year = 1996
 | title = Late Cretaceous Oceans and the Cool Tropic Paradox
 | journal = Science
 | volume = 271
 | issue = 5257
 | pages = 1838
 | doi = 10.1126/science.271.5257.1838
|bibcode = 1996Sci...271.1838D }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was later applied to similar situations, for example during the Eocene.

Climate models which worked during the Tertiary failed to produce this low temperature gradient; in order to match the observed data, they predicted that the tropics should be 40&amp;nbsp;°C or more - much hotter than the proxies said they were, and much hotter than the tropical surface temperatures observed today, which average around 25&amp;nbsp;°C (77&amp;nbsp;°F). To attempt to match the data, bizarre models involving unreasonable eddies were required.

===Models===
Models were developed to predict and explain the lack of ice during the warm periods of the Cretaceous and Eocene. Models are developed according to the fundamental principle that they should be kept as simple as possible. Consequently, the first models attempted to explain the lack of ice using solely the different continental configuration.&lt;ref name=Crowley2000/&gt; These could not produce an ice-free state without using an increased atmospheric concentration of {{co2}}; this assumption was checked against the evidence and found to be valid.&lt;ref name=Crowley2000/&gt; This introduced a new difficulty: more {{co2}} would produce warmer tropical sea temperatures, and the evidence suggested they were the same or even colder than today's.&lt;ref name=Crowley2000/&gt;

===Data supporting cool tropical oceans===
Foraminiferal data, suggesting tropical temperatures cooler than today's, disagreed with terrestrial proxies, which spoke of warmer temperatures&lt;ref name=Kobashi2001/&gt; - although most of the terrestrial figures are based on extrapolation of data from outside the tropics.&lt;ref name=Lunt2007&gt;{{cite journal
 | author = Lunt, D.J. |author2=Ross, I. |author3=Hopley, P.J. |author4=Valdes, P.J.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sources of error===
Analytical error is around 2−3&amp;nbsp;°C for individual specimens, but this drops to 0.5−1.0&amp;nbsp;°C when a sample is analysed - not enough to explain the discrepancy.&lt;ref name=Crowley2000&gt;{{cite book

 | author2 = Zachos, J.C.

 | isbn = 978-0-521-64142-5
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other factors mean that any pristine sample can be considered to have an associated error of up to 3&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;!--page=62--&gt;&lt;ref name=Crowley2000 /&gt; Changes in salinity, kinetic and diagenesis, can also confound analysis: the latter two are each estimated to reduce estimated temperatures by 1−2&amp;nbsp;°C, and are difficult to quantify.&lt;ref name=Crowley2000/&gt;

===Reconciling the data with the model===
Taking the data to be true, how could they be reconciled with the predictions of the model? The only way the model could be "tweaked" was by fiddling with the parameterisation of clouds, one of the most unpredictable aspects of any model. The model was adjusted to assume that the higher {{co2}} levels produced more tropical cloud, shielding these regions from the sun's heat.&lt;ref name=Crowley2000/&gt; However, there was no evidence for this behaviour, and still left problems. The poles were still ''warmer'' than the models predicted.&lt;ref name=Crowley2000/&gt; Further feedbacks, including increased poleward heat transport by the oceans, and vegetational responses at high latitudes, were proposed, but these didn't fully explain behaviour in the southern hemisphere, and winter, respectively.&lt;ref name=Crowley2000/&gt;

==Unravelling the paradox==

===Hints of warmth - terrestrial proxies===
Data from terrestrial proxies suggested that the equator may have reached 30&amp;nbsp;°C&lt;ref name=Lunt2007/&gt; - however, this figure is based upon extrapolation of data found outside the tropics.&lt;ref name=Lunt2007/&gt; This would imply that the foramaniferal proxies were wrong - the tests may perhaps have been overprinted by [[diagenesis]]. Researchers turned to shallow marine [[Mollusca|molluscs]] as it is easy to determine whether their shells had been altered by diagenesis.

===Detecting diagenesis in molluscs===
Many mollusc shells are constructed from aragonite, a mineral that is quickly replaced by calcite by diagenetic alteration.&lt;ref name=Kobashi2001/&gt; Also, near-shore molluscs preserve seasonal variability in their shells, a feature that would be lost in the presence of a diagenetic signal.&lt;ref name=Kobashi2001&gt;{{cite journal
 | author = Kobashi, T. |author2=Grossman, E.L. |author3=Yancey, T.E. |author4=Dockery, D.T.

|bibcode = 2001Geo....29..983K }}&lt;/ref&gt; This removes ambiguity about whether or not a shell has been affected by post-deposition processes.

===Data from molluscs===
Evidence from the molluscs suggested a cooling between the Eocene and Oligocene.&lt;ref name=Kobashi2001/&gt; Taken from the Mississippi embayment, they recorded temperatures of around 26&amp;nbsp;°C in the Eocene, and 22&amp;nbsp;°C in the Oligocene; this cooling was markedly seasonal, with reconstructed water temperatures being 5° cooler in the summer, but just 3° cooler in winter.&lt;ref name=Kobashi2001/&gt; This trend fits best if {{co2}} was the dominant force for cooling.&lt;ref name=Kobashi2001/&gt;

The winter temperatures of molluscs match well with the foramaniferal temperatures, suggesting that foramanifera predominantly grew during the winter months.&lt;ref name=Kobashi2001/&gt; The overall temperatures corresponded well with terrestrial and modelled estimates of a sea surface temperature around 4–5° warmer than today's.&lt;ref name=Kobashi2001/&gt;

===Reassessment of the foraminiferal record===
The magnesium/calcium paleothermometer is a recently developed alternative to the δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O method, and avoids many of the uncertainties inherent in the latter method. Use of this technique generates results more consistent with those expected, in contrast to the original δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O records from the same sites.&lt;ref name=Tripati2003&gt;{{cite journal

[[File:Kepler-Bruno.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Figure 'M' (for Latin ''Mundus'') from [[Johannes Kepler]]'s 1617–1621 ''[[Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae]]'', showing the [[Earth]] as belonging to just one of any number of similar stars.]]
In [[physical cosmology]], the '''Copernican principle''' is an alternative name for the  [[principle of relativity]], stating that humans, on the [[Earth]] or in the [[Solar system]], are not privileged observers of the [[universe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Peacock |first=John A. | title =  Cosmological Physics | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | page = 66 | year = 1998 |isbn= 0-521-42270-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Named for [[Copernican heliocentrism]], it is a working assumption that arises from a modified cosmological extension of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus's]] argument of a moving Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bondi |first=Hermann| authorlink = Hermann Bondi | title = Cosmology | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1952 | pages = 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some sense, it is equivalent to the [[mediocrity principle]].

== Origin and implications ==

[[Hermann Bondi]] named the principle after Copernicus in the mid-20th century, although the principle itself dates back to the 16th-17th century [[paradigm shift]] away from the [[Ptolemaic system]], which placed [[Earth]] at the center of the [[universe]]. Copernicus proposed that the motion of the planets can be explained by reference to an assumption that the Sun and not Earth is centrally located and stationary. He argued that the [[apparent retrograde motion]] of the planets is an illusion caused by Earth's movement around the [[Sun]], which the [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican model]] placed at the centre of the universe. Copernicus himself was mainly motivated by technical dissatisfaction with the earlier system and not by support for any mediocrity principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuhn |first= Thomas S. | authorlink = Thomas Kuhn | title = The Copernican Revolution: Planetary Astronomy in the Development of Western Thought | publisher = [[Harvard University Press]] |year=1957 | isbn=978-0-674-17103-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, although the Copernican heliocentric model is often described as "demoting" Earth from its central role it had in the Ptolemaic geocentric model, it was successors to Copernicus, notably the 16th century [[Giordano Bruno]] who adopted this new perspective. The earth's central position had been interpreted as being in the "lowest and filthiest parts". Instead, as Galileo said, the earth is part of the "dance of the stars" rather than the "sump where the universe's filth and ephemera collect".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1038/scientificamerican0301-24a |journal= Scientific American |year=2001 |volume=284 |issue=3 |pages=24 |title= Copernican Counterrevolution |authorlink= George Musser |last=Musser |first=George  |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=in-brief-2001-03|bibcode = 2001SciAm.284c..24M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1511/2009.76.50 |journal= American Scientist |year=2009 |volume=97 |issue=1 |pages=50–57 |title= The Bones of Copernicus |first= Dennis |last=Danielson }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 20th Century, Carl Sagan asked, "Who are we? We find that we live on an insignificant planet of a humdrum star lost in a galaxy tucked away in some forgotten corner of a universe in which there are far more galaxies than people."&lt;ref&gt;Sagan C, Cosmos (1980) p.193&lt;/ref&gt;

In cosmology, if one assumes the Copernican principle and observes that the universe appears [[Isotropy|isotropic]] or the same in all directions from our vantage point on Earth, then one can infer that the universe is generally [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneous]] or the same everywhere (at any given time) and is also isotropic about any given point. These two conditions make up the [[cosmological principle]].&lt;ref name="RowanRobinson1996" /&gt; In practice, astronomers observe that the universe has [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|heterogeneous]] or non-uniform structures up to the scale of [[galactic supercluster]]s, [[Galaxy filament|filaments]] and [[Void (astronomy)|great void]]s. It becomes more and more homogeneous and isotropic when observed on larger and larger scales, with little detectable structure on scales of more than about 200 million [[parsec]]s. However, on scales comparable to the radius of the observable universe, we see systematic changes with distance from Earth. For instance, galaxies contain more young stars and are less clustered, and [[quasars]] appear more numerous. While this might suggest that Earth is at the center of the universe, the Copernican principle requires us to interpret it as evidence for the evolution of the universe with time: this distant light has taken most of the age of the universe to reach us and show us the universe when it was young. The most distant light of all, [[cosmic microwave background radiation]], is isotropic to at least one part in a thousand.

Modern mathematical cosmology is based on the assumption that the Cosmological principle is almost, but not exactly, true on the largest scales. The Copernican principle represents the irreducible philosophical assumption needed to justify this, when combined with the observations.

[[Michael Rowan-Robinson]] emphasizes the Copernican principle as the threshold test for modern thought, asserting that: "It is evident that in the post-Copernican era of human history, no well-informed and rational person can imagine that the Earth occupies a unique position in the universe."&lt;ref name="RowanRobinson1996"&gt;{{cite book | last=Rowan-Robinson |first=Michael  |authorlink=Michael Rowan-Robinson | title = Cosmology| edition = 3rd | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | pages = 62–63  |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-19-851884-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bondi and [[Thomas Gold]] used the Copernican principle to argue for the [[perfect cosmological principle]] which maintains that the universe is also homogeneous in time, and is the basis for the [[steady-state cosmology]].&lt;ref name="BondiGold1948"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bondi|first=H.|author2=Gold, T.|title=The Steady-State Theory of the Expanding Universe|journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]|year=1948|volume=108|issue=3|pages=252–270|bibcode=1948MNRAS.108..252B|doi=10.1093/mnras/108.3.252}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this strongly conflicts with the evidence for cosmological evolution mentioned earlier:  the universe has progressed from extremely different conditions at the [[Big Bang]], and will continue to progress toward extremely different conditions, particularly under the rising influence of [[dark energy]], apparently toward the [[Big Freeze]] or [[Big Rip]].

Since the 1990s the term has been used (interchangeably with "the Copernicus method") for [[J. Richard Gott]]'s [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian-inference]]-based prediction of duration of ongoing events, a generalized version of the [[Doomsday argument]].{{clarify|date=April 2017}}

==Tests of the principle==
The Copernican principle has never been proven, and in the most general sense cannot be proven, but it is implicit in many modern theories of physics.  Cosmological models are often derived with reference to the [[Cosmological principle]], slightly more general than the Copernican principle, and many tests of these models can be considered tests of the Copernican principle.&lt;ref name=clarkson&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Clarkson | first1 = C. | last2 = Bassett | first2 = B. | last3 = Lu | first3 = T. | title = A General Test of the Copernican Principle | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.101.011301 | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 101 | year = 2008 | pmid =  | pmc = |arxiv = 0712.3457 |bibcode = 2008PhRvL.101a1301C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical===
Before the term Copernican principle was even coined, Earth was repeatedly shown not to have any special location in the universe. The [[Copernican Revolution]] dethroned Earth to just one of many planets orbiting the Sun. [[Proper motion]] was mentioned by Halley. [[William Herschel]] found that the Solar System is moving through space within our disk-shaped [[Milky Way]] galaxy. [[Edwin Hubble]] showed that our galaxy is just one of many galaxies in the universe. Examination of our galaxy's position and motion in the universe led to the [[Big Bang|Big Bang theory]] and the whole of modern [[cosmology]].

==Physics without the principle==
The standard model of cosmology, the [[Lambda-CDM model]], assumes the Copernican principle and the more general [[Cosmological principle]] and observations are largely consistent but there are always [[Unsolved problems in physics#Astronomy and astrophysics|unsolved problems]].  Some cosmologists and theoretical physicists design models lacking the Cosmological or Copernican principles, to constrain the valid values of observational results, to address specific known issues, and to propose tests to distinguish between current models and other possible models.

A prominent example in this context is the observed [[accelerating universe]] and the [[cosmological constant]] issue.  An alternative proposal to [[dark energy]] is that the universe is much more inhomogeneous than currently assumed, and specifically that we are in an extremely large low-density void.&lt;ref name=void&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = February | first1 = S. | last2 = Larena | first2 = J. | last3 = Smith | first3 = M. | last4 = Clarkson | first4 = C. | title = Rendering dark energy void | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2966.2010.16627.x | journal = Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society | pages = no | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = |arxiv = 0909.1479 |bibcode = 2010MNRAS.405.2231F }}&lt;/ref&gt;  To match observations we would have to be very close to the centre of this void, immediately contradicting the Copernican principle.

'''Corrective rape''', also called '''curative'''&lt;ref name="UNreport2011"/&gt; or '''homophobic rape''',&lt;ref name="UNAIDS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RASmith"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MDSmith"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Smith |first=Merril D.

The term ''corrective rape'' was coined in South Africa after well-known cases of corrective rapes of [[lesbian]]s such as [[Eudy Simelane]] (who was also murdered in the same attack) and Zoliswa Nkonyana became public. Popularisation of the term has raised awareness and encouraged [[LGBT]]+ people in countries across the world to come forward with their own stories of being raped as punishment for and/or in an attempt to change their sexual orientation and/or gender identity.&lt;ref name="Denton"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Denton |first=Michelle |date=2017 |title=Rape Culture: How Can We End It? |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nn5mDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA31 |location=New York |publisher=Greenhaven Publishing LLC |page=31 |isbn=9781534562929 |accessdate=8 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some countries have laws protecting LGBT+ people, corrective rape is often overlooked.&lt;ref name="Hawthorne" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Di" /&gt;

== Definitions==
Corrective rape is the use of [[rape]] against people who do not conform to perceived [[Norm (social)|social norms]] regarding [[human sexuality]] or [[gender role]]s. The goal is to punish perceived abnormal behavior and reinforce societal norms.&lt;ref name="Actionaid" /&gt;&lt;ref name="academia.edu"/&gt; The crime was first{{when|date=September 2018 |reason=Which year?}} identified in South Africa,&lt;ref name="Janoff" /&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2018}} where it is sometimes supervised by members of the woman's family or local community.&lt;ref name="Bartle" /&gt; One of the earliest known mentions of the term is by South African feminist activist Bernedette Muthien during an August 2001 interview  by [[Human Rights Watch]] in [[Cape Town]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Long |first1=Scott |last2=Brown |first2=A. Widney |last3=Cooper |first3=Gail |date=2003 |title=More Than a Name: State-sponsored Homophobia and Its Consequences in Southern Africa |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CZhEqsNtNS4C&amp;pg=PA193 |location= |publisher=Human Rights Watch |page=193 |isbn=9781564322869 |accessdate=9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Lesbians are particularly targeted for gang rape. African lesbians are more likely to be raped as lesbians in the townships. To what extent are coloured lesbians also targeted for rape because of their sexual orientation? There are no statistics for this, I don't know what percent of coloured lesbians are targeted for corrective rape action. Growing up, I never heard that lesbians were targeted in this way and so I want to know when that started happening. Gangsterism has always existed in the townships, so you can't attribute it to that. I don't know why black lesbians are targeted more, either. I'd like to know how many women are being raped by brothers, fathers, etc., in coloured townships. Why is no one studying this? Has it just been under-reported, not studied, or what?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[United Nations]] [[UNAIDS]] 2015 Terminology Guidelines suggests that the term ''corrective rape'' should no longer be used, as it gives off the perception that something needs to be fixed. The guidelines propose that the term ''[[homophobic]] rape'' should be used instead.&lt;ref name="UNAIDS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=United Nations|title=UNAIDS 2015 Terminology Guidelines |url=http://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/2015_terminology_guidelines_en.pdf |website=UNAIDS.org |date=2015 |accessdate=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MDSmith"/&gt; The words "so-called 'curative' or 'corrective' rape" were mentioned in 2011 in the first UN report on discrimination and violence against [[LGBT+]] people.&lt;ref name="UNreport2011"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/19session/A.HRC.19.41_English.pdf |title=Discriminatory laws and practices and acts of violence against individuals based on their sexual orientation and gender identity |author= |work=Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights |publisher=[[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] |date=17 November 2011 |accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 global study on [[HIV/AIDS]] suggested the term ''[[lesbophobia|lesphobic]] rape'' to emphasize the fact that [[lesbians]] constitute the overwhelmingly majority of victims of this phenomenon.&lt;ref name="RASmith"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Smith |first=Raymond A.

Smith (2018), p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Denton"/&gt;

==Contributing factors and motivations==
Corrective rape is a [[hate crime]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, due to [[homophobia]] and [[heteronormativity]], hate crimes based on sexuality (as opposed to race, gender, class, age, etc.) are often not recognized by authorities.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; A 2000 study suggested an atmosphere supportive of hate crimes against gay men and lesbians, reactions to hate crimes by the broader community, and responses by police and justice systems contribute to corrective rape.&lt;ref name="Bartle" /&gt;

Some people believe corrective rape can "fix" people who do not conform to gender norms or who are not heterosexual. [[ActionAid]] reports that survivors remember being told that they were being taught a lesson.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.actionaid.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/hate_crimes_the_rise_of_corrective_rape_in_south_africa_september_2009.pdf|title=ActionAid|last=|first=|date=2009 |publisher=ActionAid|access-date=2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some perpetrators of the hate crime are impelled by a sense of misogyny and chauvinism.&lt;ref&gt;Reddy, Vasu, Cheryl-Ann Potgieter, and Nonhlanhla Mkhize. "Cloud over the rainbow nation:'corrective rape'and other hate crimes against black lesbians." (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sources argue that many cases of corrective rape are caused by [[is–ought problem|drawing moral conclusions]] from the [[nature–nurture debate]]. Despite the scientific community believing that sexual orientation is the result of biology and environment,&lt;ref name="pediatrics2004"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1542/peds.113.6.1827 |author=Frankowski BL|author2=American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Adolescence|title=Sexual orientation and adolescents |journal=[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]]|volume=113 |issue=6 |pages=1827–32 |date=June 2004|pmid=15173519|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/113/6/1827.long}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lamanna"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Mary Ann Lamanna, Agnes Riedmann, Susan D Stewart|title=Marriages, Families, and Relationships: Making Choices in a Diverse Society|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|isbn=1305176898|year=2014|page=82|accessdate=February 11, 2016|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fofaAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA82|quote=The reason some individuals develop a gay sexual identity has not been definitively established &amp;nbsp;– nor do we yet understand the development of heterosexuality.

Because of this, some of these people believe sexual orientation can be changed or, as they see it, fixed.&lt;ref&gt;McCommon B (2006). "Antipsychiatry and the Gay Rights Movement".

== Intersectionality ==
[[Intersectionality]] is ''intersecting'' social identities and related systems of [[oppression]], [[Dominance hierarchy|domination]], or [[discrimination]]. In South Africa, black lesbians face homophobia, [[sexism]], [[racism]], and [[classism]]. Research in 2008 by Triangle, a gay rights group, revealed that black lesbians were twice as afraid of sexual assault compared to white lesbians.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, black women who identify as lesbians are seen as "un-African" by their peers.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=3d95b04c-aa02-4955-8d90-80637d88d9e2%2540sessionmgr104&amp;vid=7&amp;hid=108|title=EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page|website=eds.b.ebscohost.com|access-date=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking into account race and sexuality together is essential when examining corrective rape, as both subjects cross into each other and influence each other heavily.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=Feb 2013|title=Rape as a Weapon of Hate: Discursive Constructions and Material Consequences of Black Lesbianism in South Africa|url=|journal=Women's Studies in Communication|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intersectionality plays a major role in corrective rape cases, as many occur in underdeveloped countries such as South Africa and India in which race, class, and gender are factors in the rights an individual will receive. Sexuality and gender especially, define the social and political rank of victims. Many are ostracized, and other abusive measures are taken in order to cure individuals of their sexuality.

== Impact on victims ==
Corrective rape and other accompanying acts of violence can result in [[physical trauma|physical]] and [[psychological trauma]], mutilation, unwanted [[pregnancy]], and may contribute to [[suicide]].&lt;ref name="Hawthorne" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Actionaid" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mabuse" /&gt; Corrective rape is a major contributor to [[HIV]] infection in South African lesbians.&lt;ref name="Actionaid" /&gt; In South Africa approximately 10% of lesbians are HIV positive, with corrective rape being the most likely cause.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; HIV in South Africa is pandemic, and due to homophobia there is a  lack of education about sexually transmitted diseases among lesbians. Homophobic laws and discrimination in South Africa contribute to the poor quality of health care for minorities.

The psychological effects of corrective rape on victims can be detrimental. Many victims in countries such as South Africa and India where corrective rape is most prevalent suffer from a strong sense of insecurity and disempowerment due to strong homophobia in their communities. This homophobia can lead to both physical and psychological violence. There have been at least 30 lesbians who have been murdered in South Africa in the last 15 years because of their sexual orientation.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} However, violence against the LGBTQ community in South Africa is seldom reported.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Survivors of corrective rape suffer from triple discrimination for being a female, black, and homosexual.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This is especially true in South African townships, where corrective rape is common for lesbian women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nduna|first=Mzikazi|date=2012|title=Disempowerment And Psychological Distress In The Lives Of Young People In Eastern Cape, South Africa|url=|journal=Journal of Child and Family Studies|volume=21|issue=6|pages=1018|doi=10.1007/s10826-011-9564-y|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corrective rape victims may suffer from [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[Anxiety disorder|anxiety]], and/or [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=du Toit|first=Louise|date=2014|title=Shifting Meanings of Postconflict Sexual Violence in South Africa|url=|journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|volume=40|pages=101|doi=10.1086/676895|jstor=10.1086/676895|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to racial and sexual discrimination in health care, victims must often deal with these issues on their own.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Children in India have been speaking out about how their parents are sanctioning the child's sexuality by using "corrective rape therapy" (same as corrective rape).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/relationships/parenting/Victims-of-corrective-rape-speak-up/articleshow/47602170.cm|title=Victims of Corrective Rape Speak Up|date=June 2015|work=Times of India|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corrective rape in India typically happens in order to protect the family name, to avoid shaming from religious communities, and to prevent abnormal perception by the surrounding community. In India, there is a general discomfort with discussing homosexuality, even if an individual identifies as homosexual. This discomfort comes from the overall negative attitude towards homosexuality and the fact is that individuals in India who identify as homosexual are victimized at a higher rate. There is also a high level of negativity towards the trans community in India. Religious commitments tend to be very strong in traditional cultures and this is where much of the tension and poor perception came from. According to statistics from the Crisis Intervention Team of LGBT Collective in Telangana, India, there have been 15 reported instances of corrective rape that have been reported in the last 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=India's Bollywood Speaks Out Against Rape|last=MM Vetticad|first=Anna|date=10 July 2014|work=Newspaper|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, there has been a 902 percent increase in reported rapes in India from 1971 to 2012; however, it is estimated that 90% of sex crimes in the country go unreported.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/07/india-bollywood-speaks-out-against-rape-201471075423510320.html|title=India's Bollywood speaks out against rape|website=www.aljazeera.com|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amnesty International has received reports of violence against lesbians in [[Jamaica]], including rape and other forms of sexual violence. Lesbians reportedly have been attacked on the grounds of mannish physical appearance or other visible signs of sexuality. Some reports of abduction and rape come from inner-city communities, where local non-governmental organizations have expressed concerns about high incidences of violence against women.&lt;ref name="Czyzselska"/&gt;

One in four men admit to having sex with a woman who did not consent and nearly half of these men admitted to raping more than once.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carter|first1=Clare|title=The Brutality of "Corrective Rape" |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/07/26/opinion/26corrective-rape.html|website=nytimes.com|accessdate=12 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also estimated that a woman is raped every 26 seconds in South Africa.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Corrective rape is used as a punishment for people who are gay or do not fit traditional gender roles (usually women), where often they are [[verbally abused]] before the rape. The perpetrator may claim to be teaching the women a lesson on how to be a "real woman".&lt;ref name="academia.edu"/&gt; Because women have less control over their [[economics]], which creates economic vulnerability, they have less control over their own sexual activities.&lt;ref name="Mieses" /&gt;  Poor black women who live in townships are more likely to become victims of corrective violence, and gay women are more likely to be isolated with little support, which increases their chances of being targeted.&lt;ref name="Di" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mabuse" /&gt;

The [[South African Constitution]] is one of the most progressive constitutions in the world. It states that no person shall be discriminated against based on his or her gender, [[race (human categorization)|race]], or sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mieses" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN" /&gt; [[Equality Act (South Africa)|The Equality Act]] of 2000 specifically bans [[hate crime]]s, crimes in which people are targeted because of one or more aspects of their identity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although this technically includes crimes based on sexual orientation, in practice such cases are not brought to trial.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Crimes based on sexual orientation are not expressly recognized in South Africa; corrective rape reports are not separated from general rape reports.&lt;ref name="Di" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mabuse" /&gt; In December 2009, there had been 31 recorded murders of lesbians in South Africa since 1998, but only one had resulted in a conviction.&lt;ref name="Mieses" /&gt;

The reason for this discrepancy between the law and practice is a result of [[heteronormativity]] and homophobia in South Africa. Heteronormativity can be defined as "the institutions, structures of understanding, and practical orientations that make heterosexuality not only seem coherent—that is organised as a sexuality—but also privileged".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=7107cbc9-729a-47b1-995e-a1608ec7c9aa%2540sessionmgr115&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=108|title=EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page|website=eds.b.ebscohost.com|access-date=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians believe the heteronormativity in South Africa can be attributed to the nation's postcolonial years of racism, and it appears that today many South Africans are recommitted to their traditional heritage.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Black South African lesbians are not included in this [[social construction]], and this leads back to the concept of [[intersectionality]]. Black lesbians in South Africa are not only excluded because of their sexual orientation but also because of their ethnicity. As displayed in the media, most homosexuality is displayed as white, leaving black lesbians in South African even more marginalized.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In South Africa, homosexuality is regarded as "un-African" by some.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 2004, the [[Human Sciences Research Council (South Africa)|Human Science Research Council]] found that 78% of the respondents thought of homosexuality as unacceptable. According to [[Human Rights Watch]], in the last 20 years, attitudes toward [[homosexuality]] have become worse in South Africa.&lt;ref name="Hazelton" /&gt;

Corrective rape is on the rise in South Africa. More than 10 lesbians are raped weekly to correct their sexual preferences, as estimated by Luleki Sizwe, a South African nonprofit.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Contemporary Sexuality" /&gt; It is estimated that at least 500 lesbians become victims of corrective rape every year and that 86% of black lesbians in the [[Western Cape]] live in fear of being [[sexually assaulted]], as reported by the Triangle Project in 2008.&lt;ref name="Di" /&gt; Yet victims of corrective rape are less likely to report it because of the negative social view of homosexuality.&lt;ref name="Di" /&gt; Under-reporting is high for sexually violent crimes, thus the number of corrective rapes are likely higher than what is reported.&lt;ref name="Di" /&gt;

Although it is thought to be uncommon, men also become victims of corrective rape. A study conducted by OUT [[LGBT]] Well-being and the University of South Africa Centre for Applied Psychology (UCAP) showed that "the percentage of black gay men who said they have experienced corrective rape matched that of the black lesbians who partook in the study".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Louw|first1=Angelo|title=Men are also 'corrective rape' victims |url=http://mg.co.za/article/2014-04-11-men-are-also-corrective-rape-victims|website=Mail&amp;Guardian |accessdate=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all men admit to being victims of corrective rape.

One South African man stated, "Lesbians get raped and killed because it is accepted by our community and by our culture."&lt;ref name="Middleton" /&gt; Kekelesto explained that her experience as "where men try to turn you into a real African woman" and that she was being taught how to be a black woman.&lt;ref name="academia.edu" /&gt;

Galip Asvat, a successful hair salon business owner, is a gay man born in [[Klerksdorp]].

On his attack, he said, "They thought I was a woman, and when they found out I was a man, that's when they became even more violent."&lt;ref name="mg.co.za"/&gt; His beating was brutal and the gang of men nearly cut off his genitals.

Sizakele Sigasa, a lesbian activist living in [[Soweto]], and her partner Salome Masooa were raped, [[torture]]d, and murdered in July 2007. South African lesbian-[[gay rights]] organizations, including the umbrella-group Joint Working Group, said the attack was driven by lesbophobia.&lt;ref name="Ndaba"/&gt; Two other rape/murders of lesbians occurred in South Africa earlier in Summer 2007: Simangele Nhlapo, member of an [[HIV-positive]] support group was raped and murdered in June, along with her two-year-old daughter; and Madoe Mafubedu, age 16, was raped and stabbed to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pithouse |first=Richard |title=Only Protected on Paper |url=http://sacsis.org.za/site/article/644.1 |publisher=The South African Civil Society Information Service |accessdate=22 December 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QiX79Fi5?url=http://sacsis.org.za/site/article/644.1 |archivedate=30 June 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, two writers from South African men's magazine ''[[FHM]]'' were fired as a result of corrective rape jokes they made on Facebook. After a disciplinary hearing on Friday, July 19, 2013, ''FHM'' dismissed both men from their positions, calling their comments "entirely unacceptable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2013-07-19-fhm-fires-rape-comment-writers|title=FHM fires writers over rape comments|first=Staff|last=Reporter|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

South Africa is a signatory of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), which obligates states to remove discriminatory barriers from the full and free exercise of rights by women. The Convention's duty to modify the conduct of private citizens to ensure equality for women covers attitudes that include the inferiority of women and stereotyped gender roles, which arguably encompass the animus toward gay women that motivates many men to commit corrective rape.&lt;ref name="Di" /&gt; 66% of South Africa women said they did not report their attack because they would not be taken seriously.&lt;ref name="Actionaid" /&gt; Of these, 25% said they feared exposing their sexual orientation to the police and 22% said they were afraid of being abused by the police.&lt;ref name="Actionaid" /&gt;

In August 2011, the [[Department of Justice and Constitutional Development|Department of Justice]] established a National Task Team (NTT) to address the issue of hate crimes against LGBT people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Team starts work on gay hate crimes |agency=[[South African Press Association|SAPA]]-DPA |date=10 August 2011 |url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/crime-courts/team-starts-work-on-gay-hate-crimes-1.1115051 |newspaper=[[Independent Online (South Africa)|IOL News]] |accessdate=15 August 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6RD3RrFs8?url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/crime-courts/team-starts-work-on-gay-hate-crimes-1.1115051 |archivedate=20 July 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2014, then [[Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development|Minister of Justice]] [[Jeff Radebe]] launched a National Intervention Strategy for the LGBTI Sector developed by the NTT to address sex-based violence and [[gender-based violence]] against members of the community. The NTT has established a rapid response team to attend to unsolved criminal cases as a matter of urgency and produced an information pamphlet with frequently asked questions about LGBTI persons. Radebe stated that the Department of Justice acknowledged the need for a specific legal framework for hate crimes and that the matter would be subjected to public debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Intervention Strategy for LGBTI Sector 2014|url=http://www.justice.gov.za/vg/lgbti/2014-LGBTI-Strategy.pdf|publisher=Department of Justice and Constitutional Development|accessdate=20 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Radebe launches LGBTI violence programme |url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/crime-courts/radebe-launches-lgbti-violence-programme-1.1681563 |accessdate=20 July 2014 |agency=SAPA |newspaper=IOL |date=29 April 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6RD3bz2dy?url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/crime-courts/radebe-launches-lgbti-violence-programme-1.1681563 |archivedate=20 July 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Diale|first1=Lerato|title=Plan to combat gender violence|url=http://www.thenewage.co.za/124285-1007-53-Plan_to_combat_gender_violence|accessdate=20 July 2014|work=The New Age|date=30 April 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140720144529/http://www.thenewage.co.za/124285-1007-53-Plan_to_combat_gender_violence|archivedate=20 July 2014|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, there was an article published that stated that there are about 10 new cases of corrective rape a week in Cape Town.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/92198/south-africa-activism-makes-inroads-corrective-rape|title=Activism makes inroads on 'corrective rape'|date=2011-03-15|website=IRIN|access-date=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cape Town|Cape Town, South Africa]] specifically has 2.5 million people and since 2011, the prevalence of Corrective Rape has only increased.

=== United States ===
In the [[United States]], [[Brandon Teena]] (1972–1993) is one of the best-known victims of corrective rape (and thereafter murder) for being a [[trans man]]. The book ''All She Wanted'' (1996) and the two films ''[[The Brandon Teena Story]]'' (1998) and ''[[Boys Don't Cry (film)|Boys Don't Cry]]'' (1999) were about him.&lt;ref name="MDSmith178"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=McOrmond-Plummer |first1=Louise |last2=Easteal |first2=Patricia |last3=Levy-Peck |first3=Jennifer Y. |date=2014 |title=Intimate Partner Sexual Violence: A Multidisciplinary Guide to Improving Services and Support for Survivors of Rape and Abuse |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1dnDAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA266 |location=London |publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers |page=266 |isbn=9780857006554 |accessdate=8 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Zimbabwe ===
{{Further|LGBT rights in Zimbabwe}}

A U.S. State Department report on Zimbabwe states, "In response to social pressure, some families reportedly subjected their LGBT members to corrective rape and forced marriages to encourage heterosexual conduct. Such crimes were rarely reported to police. Women, in particular, were subjected to rape by male family members."&lt;ref name="USZimbabwe2012"/&gt; 
Following the publication of an earlier report with similar wording,&lt;ref name="USZimbabwe2009"/&gt; Zimbabwean journalist [[Angus Shaw (writer)|Angus Shaw]] said that lesbian women are raped by men to make them enjoy heterosexual acts and gay men are raped by women to remove their sexual orientation tendencies.&lt;ref name="Gonda"/&gt;

==Campaigning and activism==
Child sponsorship charity [[ActionAid]] has published an article discussing corrective rape, and see ending violence against women as a pivotal part of their mission.&lt;ref name="Actionaid" /&gt; The group joined with 26 gay and women's rights and community groups, to organize a campaign focused on South Africa but also aimed at the international community, to raise awareness of the issues.  The campaign was dedicated to raising awareness about the rape and murder of two lesbian women in a Johannesburg township and called for sexual orientation to be specifically recognised as grounds for protection by police and justice systems.&lt;ref name="Actionaid" /&gt;

Ndumie Funda, a South African Social Justice Activist, started her work to end Corrective Rape by launching a social campaign on [[Change.org]] in hopes to have the South African Government recognize hate crimes committed due to biases against sexual orientation and provide protection for victims. This particular petition ended up gathering almost 200 thousand signatures from individuals making up over 175 different countries-this forced the government to recognize this issue. The government agreed to meeting Funda and in 2014 South Africa passed its first law against hate crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedp.com/article/2015/02/south-africa-ndumie-funda|title=Activist takes on mission against "corrective" rape|website=www.thedp.com|access-date=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cronulla Fisheries Centre''' or '''Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre''' is a heritage-listed former [[fisheries science|fisheries research centre]] and now public reserve and marine rescue base located at the Southern end of Nicholson Parade, [[Cronulla, New South Wales|Cronulla]], [[Sutherland Shire]], [[New South Wales]], Australia. It was built from 1904. It is also known as '''The Cronulla Fisheries Centre and Hungry Point Reserve'''; '''NSW Fisheries Research Institute'''; '''CSIRO Fisheries Division''' and the '''CSIRO Division of Fisheries &amp; Oceanography'''. The property is owned by the [[Department of Primary Industries (New South Wales)|NSW Department of Primary Industries]], a [[government department|department]] of the [[Government of New South Wales]]. The site has heritage listed buildings and several [[Australian Aboriginal]] sites.&lt;ref name=cfrc-history/&gt; It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

Following a long history of internationally recognised research&lt;ref name=SMH-20111014/&gt; in 2011 a decision was made by the [[Government of New South Wales]] to decentralise the Centre's functions and staff to regional centres at [[Coffs Harbour]], [[Port Stephens (New South Wales)|Port Stephens]] and [[Nowra]].&lt;ref name="main page"/&gt; The decision created a degree of controversy&lt;ref name=SMH-20120910/&gt; as it was announced without any staff consultation, or a cost-benefit analysis. A Parliamentary Inquiry was held during 2012, and its chairman, [[Fred Nile]] MLC, reported that:&lt;ref name="enquiry-final report-media release"/&gt;
{{blockquote|"... [there was] an overwhelming case to retain the scientific staff, facilities and support personnel at the Centre ....".|}} 

In December 2012 the Government rejected the inquiry's recommendation,&lt;ref name=close2012/&gt; and in 2013 the Centre was closed. In 2014 the Government committed itself to keeping the site in public ownership. The '''Hungry Point Reserve Trust''' was created to manage the Crown land, and existing facilities are used by [[Marine Rescue NSW]], the [[New South Wales Police Force#Marine Area Command|Water Police]] and [[Roads and Maritime Services]].&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;&lt;ref name="nswshr-1011-1535" /&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1548/&gt;

== Location ==
The former fisheries centre, and now Hungry Point Reserve, occupies an area of 3-hectares located at 202 Nicholson Parade at the southern-most tip of Cronulla Pensinsula overlooking Salmon Haul Bay and [[Gunnamatta Bay]] on [[Port Hacking]]. It is also opposite [[Bundeena]] in the [[Royal National Park]].&lt;ref name=cfrc-contact/&gt;. It is bound on the north by Darook Park, residential properties fronting Nicholson Parade and Cowra Place, and Salmon Haul Reserve on the north east of the site.&lt;ref name="Architectural-Projects1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Architectural-Projects2"/&gt;

== History ==
===Indigenous history===
The Gwiyaga ([[Gweagal]]), a clan of the [[Tharawal|Dharawal]] tribe of indigenous Australians, are traditional custodians of the southern areas of [[Sydney]]. The Gweagal hunted and fished in the swamps between [[Botany Bay]] and Port Hacking. They spoke the Dharawal language. Radiocarbon dating indicates that Aborigines were using areas of the Royal National Park at least 7,500 years ago. Midden deposits are present along the entire foreshore with minor concentrations associated with rock shelters and extensive midden deposits visible beneath building foundations.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1531/&gt;

The area would have provided rich marine resources for inhabitants, in terms of both food resources and shelter. Shellfish and fish such as Sydney rock whelk and Sydney rock oyster were integral to the diet of coastal Aboriginal tribes, as were snapper and bream. Both men and women spent considerable time fishing. The diet of Dharawal people could also have included rhizomes of bracken fern, seeds of the wattle, fruit of the geebung (snotty gobbles) and the terminal buds of the cabbage tree palm.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

Frank Cridland in his book ''The Story of Port Hacking, Cronulla and the Sutherland Shire'' (1924) spoke of Darook Park, and particularly the [[Wahgunyah]] Cliffs, immediately north of the Fisheries site, lamenting that the evidence of occupation of the area by the Aboriginal people was in danger of destruction by modern development. He commissioned surveyor and recorder of engraving sites, W.D.Campbell, to record the engravings visible (at the time) in the Cronulla area, including the vicinity of the Fisheries site.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

In the early 1960s archaeologist Ian Sim recorded engravings in the Darook Park area, along Darook Park Road (adjacent to the Wahgunyah Cliffs). Some of these engravings may still exist, but are now on private property.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1533/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

===Colonial history===
The earliest description of the area from a European perspective was given by explorer Matthew [[Flinders, New South Wales|Flinders]], who in April 1814 spent time navigating the shores of Port Hacking.
Explorers George Bass and Matthew Flinders camped adjacent to the "Fisheries Site" at (presumably) Salmon Haul Bay in 1776. They liaised with two of the local native people, a very early example of friendly relations between Europeans and members of the local native population.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

Surveyor [[Robert Dixon (explorer)|Robert Dixon]] worked here in 1827-8, naming the beaches. At the south end of [[Bate Bay]] and north of the entrance to Port Hacking, John Connell was the first European settler, receiving a 380-acre grant in 1835. The suburb's name is from the Aboriginal word "kurranulla" meaning the place of pink seashells. In 1840 the beach was known as Kurranulla. In 1895 the area was subdivided and land offered for sale at 10 pounds per acre; in 1899 the [[Government of New South Wales|NSW Government]] named the area Gunnamatta (meaning sandy hills) but on 26/2/1908 it was officially changed to Cronulla, and Gunnamatta became the name of the beautiful bay on the Port Hacking side of this suburb.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

After the railway came to [[Sutherland, New South Wales|Sutherland]] in 1884, the area became popular for picnics - for which Cronulla has two assets: a fine ocean surfing beach, and on its southern side beautiful Gunnamatta Bay, an arm of Port Hacking. Before Cronulla was linked to Sydney by rail in 1939, it was necessary to travel to Sutherland and transfer to a steam tram which chuffed its way through sandy, sometimes bushland areas to the beach. An official post office opened in 1891, known as [[Cronulla Beach]] post office as at the time most of the settlement was on the beach side. It closed in 1893, reopened in 1907 and in 1929 its name changed officially to Cronulla. The first public school opened in 1910. Today there are two public schools and a high school, as well as convent schools.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1532&gt;Pollen &amp; Healy, 1988, 74&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

===Development of the Fisheries Research Centre===
====Hungry Point area and the evolution of the Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre (CFRC)====
Scientific fisheries research has been carried out at the Cronulla location for more than 110 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre |url=http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/research/centres/cronulla/history |publisher=NSW Department of Primary Industries |date=March 2011 |accessdate=19 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406041117/http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/research/centres/cronulla/history |archivedate=6 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The research aquaria was built in 1904 and is now heritage listed.&lt;ref name=saveCFRC-facilities&gt;{{cite web|title=Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre of Excellence - Research Aquaria|url=http://www.savecronullafisheries.net/facilities.html|publisher=www. savecronullafisheries.net|accessdate=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first such research facility in the southern hemisphere,&lt;ref name=cfrc-history&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre |url=http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/research/centres/cronulla/history |publisher=NSW Department of Primary Industries |date=March 2011 |accessdate=19 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406041117/http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/research/centres/cronulla/history |archivedate=6 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and according to fisheries scientist Professor [[Tony Pitcher]] of the [[University of British Columbia]], has a "long and distinguished international reputation in fisheries research".&lt;ref name=SMH-20111014&gt;{{cite news|title=Cronulla Fisheries fight goes global|url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/conservation/cronulla-fisheries-fight-goes-global-20111014-1loxu.html|accessdate=21 November 2012|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|date=14 October 2011|agency=AAP}}&lt;/ref&gt; The southernmost part of the Cronulla peninsula has a "rich fabric of Aboriginal occupation". Surveyor Robert Dixon visited Cronulla and surrounding areas in 1827, and secured the native names of the beaches and bays, e.g. Cronulla (Kurranulla), [[Burraneer, New South Wales|Burraneer]], [[Woolooware]] and Gunnamatta.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1533&gt;Harley, 2012, 11-12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt; On 24 December 1861 a Government Reserve of {{convert|300|acre|ha|0|order=flip}} was notified. In 1865 the NSW Fisheries Act was passed.&lt;ref name="nswshr-1011-1535"&gt;Nimmo, 2016, 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt; The first research at that location was carried out by [[Harald Kristian Dannevig]] (1871–1914),&lt;ref name=BIO-Dannevig&gt;{{cite web| last=Murray-Smith| first=S| title=Dannevig, Harald Kristian (1871–1914)| url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/dannevig-harald-kristian-5879| work=[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]] |publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University| accessdate=22 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Superintendent of fisheries investigations and fish hatcheries,&lt;ref name=BIO-EOAS&gt;{{cite web|last=McCarthy|first=G.

He was assisted by [[David George Stead]] (1877–1957).&lt;ref name=BIO-Stead&gt;{{cite web| last=G. P. Walsh| first=G. P.| title=Stead, David George (1877–1957)| url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/stead-david-george-8634| work=Australian Dictionary of Biography| publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University| accessdate=22 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1800s and early 1900s the NSW Government was concerned at serious depletion of fish stocks in estuaries as a result of illegal overfishing and gross chemical pollution of Sydney harbour emanating from measures to combat the rat plague. The plan of the Fisheries Commissioners at the time was to employ aquaculture to supplement stocks of local species and also to improve the quality of the seafood available by importing live fish from the northern hemisphere for culture and release into local waters.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

In 1881 the NSW Commissioners of Fisheries were appointed under the Fisheries Act 1881.&lt;ref name="nswshr-1011-1535" /&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt; In 1895 Hungry Point was reserved for defence purposes.&lt;ref name="nswshr-1011-1535" /&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

The Hungry Point site now occupied by the CFRC was held as a reserve for defence purposes from 1895 until 1902, when an area of 1.37 ha on the Gunnamatta Bay side of the site was transferred from the Commonwealth for use by the NSW Government for the purpose of fish culture. The NSW Government was determined to appoint a fisheries expert of world repute, and in 1902 selected a 31 year old Norwegian, Harald Dannevig, who had constructed the Dunbar and [[Aberdeen, New South Wales|Aberdeen]] Marine Fish Hatcheries, and supervised their operation for 9 years. He had extensive knowledge of the commercial fishing industry in the North Sea, based on early training with his father, Gunder Dannevig, regarded as a world leader in fisheries stocking. In 1902 Harald Dannevig began duties in Sydney in the newly created position of Superintendent of Fisheries Investigations and Marine Hatcheries. He transported adult fish from the UK to Sydney, to supplement stocks in depleted NSW estuaries. He carefully selected the Cronulla site for the new hatchery and supervised construction and operation. All aspects of a potential fishing industry, both fresh and marine water, were investigated and extensive plans formulated by Dannevig. His plans were always based on expert practical work in the field and extensive discussions with fishers. He was called on by Government Commissions looking into fishing and food industries as well as giving advice to other Australian states.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

The Cronulla hatchery, experimental pool and laboratory were built in 1904, commissioned in 1905 and became fully operational in early 1906. Initial stocks of the hatchery included whiting, red bream, flathead, trevally and crayfish. Later snapper and other finfish were introduced. These all flourished in the pond but did not spawn. Dannevig had more success with flounder from [[Tasmania]], resulting in the liberation of 20 million young fish into Port Hacking, Botany Bay, [[Middle Harbour]] and [[Brisbane Water]]. The hatchering continued to culture finfish and shellfish species but more emphasis was placed on investigations into the biology of local species by hatchery staff and staff from Sydney University. The hatchery was closed in 1914, and the NSW Government embarked on other fisheries related projects including developing a commercial ocean trawl fishery.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

The Commonwealth Government appointed Dannevig to the position of founding Director of Fisheries for Australia in 1908. He designed and supervised construction of Australia's first marine research vessel, and went on to conduct the first investigations of fish resources off Australia until his death (aged 43), when the Commonwealth research ship FIV Endeavour was lost in extreme gale conditions off Macquarie Island in 1914. With the vast disruption of [[World War I]], the absence of Dannevig's leadership and insight, fisheries research and development did not progress in Australia until creation of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR, later CSIRO) in 1926. The CSIR's brief included initiation and conduct of research in connection with promotion of primary and secondary industries, training research workers, making grants for pure research and supervision of testing of scientific apparatus and standardisation. In 1929 the saltwater pool was used for experiments on the effect of electrical fields on sharks by Swedish engineer Dr E.O.Moller.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1537&gt;Harley, 2012, 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

In 1937 Dr Harold Thompson was appointed as the first Officer in Charge of the Fisheries Investigations Section of CSIR, which was renamed the CSIRO Division of Fisheries and Oceanography in 1956.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt; The NSW Government's part holding of the Hungry Point site was transferred back to the Commonwealth in 1938 to accommodate the newly established CSIR Fisheries Division, and provision was made to also house the NSW Fish Biology Branch and students from Sydney University. Programmes were quickly developed in a wide range of research areas, initially related to tuna, whales and dolphins, coastal and estuarine hydrology, fish preservation, mullet and oysters. Subsequent decades saw the rapid expansion of research programmes in physical and chemical oceanography, fish biology, population dynamics and plankton research.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt; The CSIRO Fisheries main building (Building 1) was completed in 1938.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1537/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

==== Cronulla Migrant Hostel (1949-1967) ====
In 1949 a [[Post-war immigration to Australia#Migrant reception and training centres|migrant hostel]] was built on the eastern half of the site to accommodate [[Post-war immigration to Australia|post-war migrants]] from Eastern Europe, many of whom were "[[Forced displacement|Displaced Persons]]".&lt;ref name="Architectural-Projects1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Architectural-Projects2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="2016-Masterplan"/&gt; 

The new buildings were added to existing ex-naval huts built in the 1940s and used for the CSIR Fisheries School between 1946-1947. Altogether the Cronulla Migrant Hostel precinct included eighteen buildings.&lt;ref name="Architectural-Projects2"/&gt; The buildings were constructed of weatherboard and built on brick piers. The gabled roofs were made of corrugated sheet metal, which also clad the narrow verandahs.

The Government Gazette of 22 April 1949 announced acceptance of tenders for construction of accommodation for 200 migrants. Construction continued into 1950 when a carpenters strike threatened to delay completion of the hostel. The dispute was due to the communist-controlled Building Workers' Industrial Union opposing the immigration of refugees from communist-occupied Baltic countries.&lt;ref name="communist"/&gt; The hostel was sometimes called "Balt Camp" after the number of Baltic families housed there,&lt;ref name="nswshr-1011-1537"/&gt; though migrants came from other Eastern European countries.&lt;ref name="Architectural-Projects2"/&gt;

The hostel temporarily closed in 1964 but was reopened in early 1966 to accommodate 102 migrants, mainly of British nationality.&lt;ref name="Architectural-Projects1"/&gt;

In 1967 the Cronulla Migrant Hostel was closed.&lt;ref name="Architectural-Projects1"/&gt; All but two of the hostels and associated buildings were demolished in the 1970. These two weatherboard buildings, located within a precinct with views over Port Hacking, have high heritage significance, being "rare examples of Postwar Migrant Hostel accommodation"&lt;ref name="2016-Masterplan"/&gt; and "the remaining site layout, buildings and landscape elements provide rare physical evidence of the first phase of the migration experience, accommodation in camps and the compulsory work obligation for men".&lt;ref name="Architectural-Projects2"/&gt;

==== Research ====
[[File:Examining a fish and crustaceans at the Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre.jpg|thumb|Examining a fish and crustaceans at the Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre, 1947]]

Until 2012 projects conducted at the Centre included research into [[bull shark]]s, [[Barotrauma]], [[giant cuttlefish]], prawns, [[Recreational fishery|recreational fishing]], [[commercial fisheries]], fish biology, the effects of climate change in NSW, threats to [[marine biodiversity]] in NSW, resource assessment and monitoring, and research surveys in estuaries.&lt;ref name=save-cfrc-research&gt;{{cite web| title=Current Research Projects| url=http://www.savecronullafisheries.net/research-projects.html| publisher=savecronullafisheries.net| accessdate=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cfrc-key-research&gt;{{cite web|title=Key research of Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre of Excellence| url=http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/research/centres/cronulla/key-research| publisher=NSW Department of Primary Industries| accessdate=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DPI-Current research"&gt;{{cite web| title=Current Research Projects|url=http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/184931/Current-Project-Summaries-for-Web_WILD-FISH_UPDATED-6-FEB12.pdf| work= Wild Fisheries | publisher=dpi.nsw.gov.au| accessdate=21 November 2012| pages=68| date=6 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976 the CSIRO Building 16 fisheries laboratories and offices were completed.&lt;ref name="nswshr-1011-1537" /&gt; The CSIRO Marine Laboratories were transferred to [[Hobart]] in 1984 after 47 years of research at the Hungry Point site. These decades of research were of enormous importance in establishing the basis for oceanographic and fisheries research in Australia.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

The facilities at Cronulla were transferred back to the NSW Government in 1985 for the purposes of fisheries research, and research staff of the Fisheries Division of NSW Department of Agriculture moved to the site in July 1985, when the facility was renamed the NSW Fisheries Research Institute. Research carried out since then included investigations into the dynamics of trawl fish, estuarine fish and invertebrate populations. There have been research projects to investigate the effects of impounding waterways, the impact of the Deep-Water Ocean Outfalls, the ecological impact of the third runway at [[Sydney Airport]], the effects of fishing over seagrass and estimation of the level of catch in recreational fisheries.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1541&gt;Harley, 2012, 8-11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

The Commonwealth government retained land title for the eastern part of {{convert|1.54|ha}} of the Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre site until 1988, following an agreement in 1984 between the Federal and State Governments.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt; In 2004 NSW Fisheries was amalgamated with other departments to form the NSW Department of Primary Industries (DPI).&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1541/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt; In 2005 the centenary of aquatic research at the Cronulla Marine Laboratories was celebrated. In February 2007 a newly upgraded laboratory was opened by [[Ian Macdonald (Australian politician)|Ian Macdonald]] the [[Minister for Primary Industries, Lands and Water (New South Wales)|NSW Minister for Primary Industries]]. The new $1 million laboratory was named the 'H.C.

Prior to its closure, as at March 2011 the {{convert|25|ha|adj=on}} Centre had 152 staff which included 18 research and eleven management professional staff. The Centre supported 22 postgraduate students, two overseas projects and two consultancies. The Centre had conducted{{clarify|date=November 2018|in what time period?}} 56 workshops/meetings, 182 field days, and 51 publications.&lt;ref name="main page"/&gt;

An inquiry into the closure of the Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre of Excellence was instigated and a committee established by a [[New South Wales Legislative Council|NSW Legislative Council]] resolution, to report by 23 October 2012. The committee's resolutions included that the NSW Government reverse the decision to close the CFRC and not proceed with the closure. The NSW government responded in December 2012, stating it did not support their recommendation to reverse the decision to close the centre. The NSW Department of Primary Industries Director-General issued terms of reference to recommend future uses of the site. In November David Harley AM prepared a report, making 25 recommendations for the future use of the site. One was that a Management Trust be established to manage the site.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1542&gt;Architectural Projects, 2016, 17-18&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Parliamentary inquiry ===

An inquiry by the 'Legislative Council Select Committee on Cronulla Fisheries' into the closure was established on 21 June 2012. Submissions were called for on 25 June 2012, closing on 30 July 2012. The final report was delivered on time on 23 October 2012.&lt;ref name=Inquiry&gt;{{cite web|title=Closure of the Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre of Excellence (Inquiry)| url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/committee.nsf/0/796B612554728F1BCA257A250007267B| publisher=parliament.nsw.gov.au| accessdate=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee was chaired by Fred Nile.

====2012 Parliamentary speeches touching on the site's history====
The CFRC is an important part of Australian history. It should be held in the same reverence as the Elizabeth MacArthur Agricultural Institute, as the starting point for the Agriculture Industry in Australia. Under various names, the now Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre was the site from which fisheries resources of Australia were explored and the fishing industry developed. It was the first fisheries research centre in Australia and probably the southern hemisphere. Its buildings date back to 1902, these being purpose built at the time for fisheries research.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

Since that time the site has housed fisheries scientists from either NSW or Commonwealth government agencies. It is the site which based the first chief scientist of fisheries in Australia, Harald Dannevig. From this base he surveyed the fish resources of eastern Australia to as far south as Macquarie Island and westwards in to Bass Strait as far as [[Western Australia]]. Amongst many gifted fisheries scientists and oceanographers, it has housed the first oceanographic scientists in Australia, the Chair of the International Whaling Commission and scientists who advised that body, who discovered deepwater resources and surveyed the prawn resources of the Gulf of Carpentaria.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

In addition, the site has indigenous cultural significance. CFRC is strewn with indigenous middens three of which are recognised under the Heritage Act as being worthy of conservation and protection. As part of the high school education program at the CFRC indigenous leaders take great pride in talking to students about how their people lived on this land and the importance of this land to them.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1543&gt;Montgomery, in NSW [[Parliament of New South Wales|Parliament]]. [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]], 2012, 70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

The site has associations with a number of notable scientists including Harald Dannevig (as noted above), Dr Geoffrey Kesteven, John McIntosh, David Tranter, Baughan Wisely, David Rochford and Ian Munro. Through these scientists working together they produced the earliest science for Australia as well as New South Wales in fisheries knowledge.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

There is (also) a very important gentleman who was at Cronulla until CSIRO moved to Hobart. His name is Dr Keith Sainsbury. He is one of only two Australians to have been created a laureate and receive the [[Japan Prize]], the highest prize in science. He still works internationally, nationally and in New South Wales as an expert in fisheries management and most importantly he helps in the annual assessment process for determining the New South Wales take of the highly prized abalone and lobster fisheries.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1544&gt;Gerrard, in NSW Parliament, Legislative Council, 2012, 70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation had utilised the site from 1949 until it transferred to Hobart in 1985. At that time, the Department of Agriculture's Division of Fisheries returned to the Cronulla site. 'The Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre is unique in Australia, and the site was handed over from the Commonwealth to the NSW Government in1984 in good faith that the site and buildings would continue to be used for marine research purposes.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1545&gt;Reid, in NSW Parliament, Legislative Council, 2012, 70-71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

;Former hatchery building
Fish hatchery was established in {{circa|1904}}. Building constructed prior to 1914, probably {{circa|1904}}-1907. It was originally a laboratory wing (with open verandah on both sides) and a hatchery hall comprising a single open space containing fish tanks. It was thought to be vacant {{circa|1920}}-1930. The Commonwealth Scientific &amp; Industrial Research (later ... Organisation) CSIR/CSIRO operations post-1938 were in this building. The hall remained open until 1950.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

;Boat shed
Constructed between 1904 and 1914. Re-clad {{circa|1970}}s. Restoration work to cladding and windows repplaced in 2002. Originally had wharf at western side. Engine room at east probably re-clad but original structure. Used to house boats and marine equipment.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

;Fish pond
Constructed as part of the hatchery complex between 1904 and 1914. Complex established by (Commonwealth) Superintendent of Fisheries, Harald Dannevig.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

==== Report ====

The final report, "Closure of the Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre of Excellence", was tabled as scheduled on 23 October 2012.&lt;ref name="Inquiry-final report"&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Report, Closure of the Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre of Excellence| url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/committee.nsf/0/B6D8AC60C3700E46CA257AA00015215F?open&amp;refnavid=CO3_1| publisher=parliament.nsw.gov.au| accessdate=21 November 2012| date=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Inquiry-final report-PDF"&gt;{{cite web| last=Chung| first=C| title=Closure of the Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre of Excellence| url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/committee.nsf/0/b6d8ac60c3700e46ca257aa00015215f/$FILE/Final%20Report.pdf| publisher=Select Committee on the Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre| accessdate=21 November 2012| pages=141| date=23 October 2012| isbn=978-1-920788-51-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Findings and recommendations ====

The Chairman of the 'Select Committee on the Closure of the Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre of Excellence', Fred Nile, said:&lt;ref name="enquiry-final report-media release"&gt;{{cite media release| last=Chung| first=C| title= Upper House Committee Reports on the Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre Closure (Pre-amble) | url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/committee.nsf/0/b6d8ac60c3700e46ca257aa00015215f/$FILE/Media%20Release%20&amp;%20Recommendations.pdf| publisher=Select Committee on Cronulla Fisheries Closures| accessdate=21 November 2012| pages=14| format=PDF| date=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Blockquote|"The Committee has concluded that there is an overwhelming case to retain the scientific staff, facilities and support personnel at the Centre and we have recommended that the Government reverse its decision. "

"Overall we have concluded that the closure of the Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre of Excellence has been an example of how not to undertake decentralisation. The Government's failure to conduct any kind of economic appraisal before deciding to close the Centre is unacceptable. "

"The Committee was disappointed that the decision had been made with no stakeholder consultation, in particular, the Government did not consult then Chief Scientist of the [[New South Wales Department of Primary Industries|Department of Primary Industries]], and Director of the Centre, Professor [[Steve Kennelly]]. " }}

The Committees report made 13 recommendations, the first of which is:

{{Blockquote|"That the NSW Government reverse the decision to close the Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre of Excellence and not proceed with the closure.

"The Committee is working on the expectation that the NSW Government will accept Recommendation 1 based on the evidence of this report. In the event that the Government does not accept Recommendation 1, the Committee believes that the Government should consider the following recommendations. "&lt;ref name="enquiry-final report-media release Recommendation 1-p8"&gt;{{cite media release| last=Chung| first=C| title= Upper House Committee Reports on the Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre Closure (Recommendations) 5. 50 | url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/committee.nsf/0/b6d8ac60c3700e46ca257aa00015215f/$FILE/Media%20Release%20&amp;%20Recommendations.pdf| publisher=Select Committee on Cronulla Fisheries Closures| accessdate=21 November 2012| page=8| format=PDF| date=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report then details a further 12 recommendations.&lt;ref name="enquiry-final report-media release further recommendations"&gt;{{cite media release| last=Chung| first=C| title= Upper House Committee Reports on the Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre Closure (Recommendations) 5. 51 | url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/committee.nsf/0/b6d8ac60c3700e46ca257aa00015215f/$FILE/Media%20Release%20&amp;%20Recommendations.pdf| publisher=Select Committee on Cronulla Fisheries Closures| accessdate=21 November 2012| pages=8-10| format=PDF| date=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Josephine Tovey in ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' reported that: "The inquiry,&amp;nbsp;... found the decision to close the centre and decentralise its activities to several coastal towns was made without any economic analysis, in conflict with the Government's own policies, and was never presented to cabinet. "&lt;ref name="Nile-closureon hold"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/conservation/nile-claims-win-on-fisheries-shutdown-20121121-29pnh.html | title=Nile claims win on fisheries shutdown | publisher=Fairfax Media | work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] | date=21 November 2012 | accessdate=21 November 2012 | last=Tovey | first=Josephine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Government response and outcomes ====
In September/October 2011, the [[O'Farrell ministry|O'Farrell Government]] announced closure of the centre and regional disbursement of the positions. Staff mounted an industrial and community campaign, including a website.&lt;ref name=close2012&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.savecronullafisheries.net/|title=Cronulla fisheries to be closed and destroyed|last=|first=|date=16 November 2012|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140210130316/http://www.savecronullafisheries.net/|archive-date=10 January 2014|dead-url=yes|access-date=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

Minister for Primary Industries, Katrina Hodgkinson, together with Minister [[Andrew Stoner]], the [[Deputy Premier of New South Wales|Deputy Premier]], announced on 8 September 2011 that the Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre of Excellence at Hungry Point, known as the Cronulla Fisheries site, was to be closed and its roles and functions were to be decentralised to regional coastal locations. Associate Professor David Harley {{post-nominals|country=AUS|AM}} was appointed by the Department of Primary Industries director general to assess the future usages of the site under specific terms of reference.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1546&gt;NSW Parliamentary Hansard, 21/2/2013, 17540&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

The Select Committee Inquiry into the Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre closure was published on 23 October 2012. On 22 November 2012, employees were advised that all further decommissioning of the site at Cronulla would be placed on hold until such time the Government responds to the recommendations made by the Committee's report and that no individual would be forced to make a decision, including to transfer or exit. However, where a staff member has already agreed to relocate, the Government has a duty of care to support them in their move at this time, and is therefore unable to simply cease offering this support. Similarly, the Government remains committed to a Decade of Decentralisation and recruitment for positions in regional locations needs to continue irrespective of the Government's response to the Committee's report. The Deputy Premier and Minister for Primary Industries announced the Government response on 14 December 2012.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1547&gt;Katrina Hodgkinson, MInister for Primary Industries, in NSW Parliamentary Hansard, 21/2/2013, 17535&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt; On 23 October 2012, the committee required the government to provide a response by 23 April 2014. Fred Nile claimed success at a rally to save the Fisheries Centre when the closure was "put on hold" on 21 November 2012. The NSW Government agreed to temporarily halt the closure until it could respond to the committees report,&lt;ref name="Nile-closureon hold"/&gt; but in December 2012 the Government rejected the main recommendation of the parliamentary inquiry and pressed ahead with closing the Centre.&lt;ref name=leader-close&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theleader.com.au/story/1186909/its-official-cronulla-fisheries-research-centre-will-close/ |title=It’s official: Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre will close |work=[[St George and Sutherland Shire Leader]] |date=14 December 2012 |accessdate=22 October 2014 |first=Murray |last=Trembath}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stoner and Hodgkinson gave a commitment that the site would remain in public ownership, with increased access to the public. On 4 April 2013 the Hungry Point Reserve Trust Board appointments were announced, to manage the area of the former Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre.&lt;ref name=dpi-pr-trust&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/462885/130401-med-rel-AS-Fisheries-Trust.pdf |title=TRUST BOARD TO MANAGE EX-FISHERIES RESEARCH SITE |publisher=NSW Government |date=2 April 2013 |accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Trust manages the [[Crown land|Crown Reserve land]], the volunteer [[Marine Rescue NSW]] partly occupied the site (buildings 1, 3, 5, 9 and 22) by license,&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1548&gt;Architectural Projects, 2016, 18&lt;/ref&gt; NSW Water Police and [[Roads and Maritime Services]] took up other existing facilities on site.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1548/&gt;&lt;ref name="nswshr-1011-1535" /&gt;&lt;ref name=leader-safe&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theleader.com.au/story/1406972/fisheries-site-safe/?cs=1507 |title=Fisheries site safe |work=St George and Sutherland Shire Leader |date=5 April 2013 |accessdate=22 October 2014 |last=Trembath |first=Murray}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre of Excellence (CFRC) is a purpose built research facility on approximately three hectares on a headland in the Sydney suburb of Cronulla.1 It was the first fisheries research centre in Australia having been identified for the purpose by Harald Dannevig in 1895.2 The site as a whole is heritage listed, as are several individual aspects, these include the former hatchery building, the boat [[shed]] and the aquaria.3 There are three Aboriginal middens on the site that are also heritage listed. The CFRC site is wholly owned by the NSW Government.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1549&gt;Parliament of NSW. Legislative Council, 2012, 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

=== Elements of the site include ===

;Former hatchery building
An L-shaped brick building with two wings, located on a flat (benched) area slightly above a boat shed and fish ponds at the western side of Hungry Point. Web-fired single skin [[brickwork]] walls with original single back [[Pier (architecture)|piers]] and additional recent brick piers and [[buttress]]es to southern wing. New colourbond [[Corrugated galvanised iron|corrugated iron]] roof. Interior of northern wing adapted for office use; southern [[veranda]]h of other wing infilled. Original features include door and window joinery.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

;Boat shed
Weatherboard wall, new colourbond corrugated iron [[gable]] roof. Located on eroded sea wall at edge of Port Hacking on western side of Hungry Point. Recent roller door on east side. Doors at west provide evidence of location of former wharf.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

;Fish pond
Concrete pool measuring {{convert|30|x|12|x|2|m}}, featuring more recent concrete sea wall, mesh sunshades and filter units.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

;Aboriginal middens
# Rockshelter with midden deposits which extend downslope for a distance of at least five metres below the shelter.
# Small area of midden down near holding pens on western side of complex.
# Large area of midden along the southeastern edge of the flat area at the top of the complex between building 15 and the fuel store beyond.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

The area would have provided rich marine resources for Aboriginal inhabitants, in terms of both food resources and shelter. Shellfish and fish such as Sydney rock whelk and Sydney rock oyster were integral to the diet of coastal tribes, as were snapper and bream.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1550&gt;Attenbrow, 2010, 63: Therin, 2005, 13&lt;/ref&gt; Both men and women spent considerable time fishing from bark canoes with hooks made from ground Turban shell, and line made from twine from the cabbage tree palm leaf.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1551&gt;Dallas, 2004, 39&lt;/ref&gt; Shell middens result from Aboriginal exploitation and consumption of shellfish or mammal bone, stone artefacts, hearths, charcoal and occasionally, burials. They are usuaully located on elevated dry ground close to the aquatic environment from which the shellfish was exploited and where fresh water resources were available.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

;Littoral Rainforest Remnant
A remnant patch of forest survives on the site in Darook Park. This remnant is of a listed endangered ecological community in NSW, Littoral Rainforest overlooking Port Hacking. Port Jackson figs (Ficus rubiginosa) and other tree, shrubs such as endangered species, Prostanthera densa (villous mint bush) and groundcover species make up the community.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

=== Condition ===

As at 24 November 2000, Aboriginal middens have archaeological potential, subject to greater need of preservation.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

=== Further information ===

Future management of these structures will aim to conserve all the original fabrics to maintain evidence and allow for the interpretation of their past uses. Consideration will be given to removing detracting elements from the exterior of the former hatchery building if structural investigation is permitted and a maintenance schedule, including painting of timber joinery in period colours may be instigated for three original structures.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

In September/October 1911, the [[O'Farrell ministry|O'Farrell Government]] announces closure of the centre and regional disbursement of the positions. Staff mounted an industrial and community campaign.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

== Heritage listing ==
As at 31 March 2010, the Cronulla Fisheries Centre site as a whole is of national and state heritage significance because it is the first marine investigation establishment in Australia, commencing in 1904. It has had continual association with NSW and Commonwealth Government Fisheries investigations since then. The complex is associated with the work of the first Director of NSW and Commonwealth fisheries investigations, Harald Dannevig. Three original structures still exist on the site and are considered as a group to have State significance.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011-1552&gt;NSW Fisheries s.170 Register p81&lt;/ref&gt;

Cronulla Fisheries Centre was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1011/&gt;

'''''Dawkins' God: Genes, Memes, and the Meaning of Life''''' is a book by [[Alister McGrath]], a theologian who is currently Professor of Historical [[Theology]] at [[Oxford University]]. The book, published in 2004, with a 2nd ed. in 2015, aims to refute claims about [[religion]] made by another well-known professor at Oxford, [[Richard Dawkins]]. McGrath's book does not seek to demonstrate how Dawkins’ claims differ from Christianity, rather, it argues that Dawkins' arguments fall far short of the logical and evidence-based reasoning that Dawkins himself espouses.

==Synopsis==
McGrath begins with an overview of evolutionary biology and Darwinist theory. He then presents Dawkins’ view that the current state of scientific knowledge should lead a rational person to conclude that there is no God. McGrath argues that Dawkins fails to declare or defend several crucial assumptions or premises. McGrath also defends other conclusions in the book, including:

* the [[scientific method]] cannot conclusively prove that God does or does not exist;
* the theory of evolution does not necessarily entail any particular [[Atheism|atheistic]], [[Agnosticism|agnostic]], or Christian understanding of the world;
* Dawkins' refutation of [[William Paley]]'s watchmaker analogy does not equate to a refutation of God’s existence;
* Dawkins' proposal that [[memes]] explain the evolutionary development of human culture is more illogical and unscientific than a clearly articulated defence of Christianity;
* Dawkins is ignorant of Christian theology and mischaracterizes religious people generally.

McGrath argues that Dawkins' rejection of faith is a [[straw man]] argument. According to McGrath, Dawkins’ definition that faith “means blind trust, in the absence of evidence” is not a Christian position. In contrast, argues McGrath, accepting Dawkins’ definition would require blind trust since he offers no evidence to support it. Rather, it is based upon what McGrath calls “an unstated and largely unexamined cluster of hidden non-scientific values and beliefs” (p.&amp;nbsp;92). McGrath then argues that Dawkins frequently violates the very tenets of evidence-based reasoning that Dawkins himself claims to uphold and use to dismiss all religious belief.

Also on page 92, McGrath states "... Darwinism neither proves nor disproves the existence of God (unless, of course God is defined by his critics in precisely such a way...)."

==Reception==
In ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' the [[skeptic]] [[Michael Shermer]], reviewing this book, says "[McGrath's] defense of religious faith is a passionate and honorable one and he demonstrates that some of Dawkins's characterizations of religion are indeed overly simplistic or selective, but he never delivers an answer to the God question. The closest thing to an argument for God's existence I could find in the book is this: 'Why should God require an explanation at all? He might just be an "ultimate,"...one of those things we have to accept as given and is thus amenable to description, rather than explanation.' That may be, but like all other arguments made in favor of God's existence, this only works as a reason to believe ''if you already believe''. If you do not already believe, science cannot help you."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/308/5719/205?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS=10&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=&amp;fulltext=Dawkins&amp;searchid=1&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;resourcetype=HWCIT] requires AAAS membership&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response from Dawkins==
In response to the book in general, and to the accusation of being ignorant of [[Christian theology]] in particular, Richard Dawkins stated:

{{cquote|
Yes, I have, of course, met this point before. It sounds superficially fair. But it presupposes that there is something in Christian theology to be ignorant about. The entire thrust of my position is that Christian theology is a non-subject. It is empty. Vacuous. Devoid of coherence or content. I imagine that McGrath would join me in expressing disbelief in [[fairy|fairies]], [[astrology]] and [[Mjölnir|Thor's hammer]]. How would he respond if a fairyologist, astrologer or Viking accused him of ignorance of their respective subjects? &lt;ref&gt;Marianna Krejci-Papa, 2005.

'''Domestic technology''' is the incorporation of applied science into the home.  There are many aspects of domestic technology.  On one level, there are [[home appliance]]s, [[home automation]] and other devices commonly used in the home, such as [[clothes dryer]]s and [[washing machine]]s.  These things are itemized below.  On another level, domestic technology recognizes the use of applied science to construct homes to achieve a particular goal, such as [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] or self-sufficiency.  For more information, read about [[self-sufficient homes]].  It has been claimed that domestic technology has led to decreases in the time people spend on household work, although the factual basis of this claim is disputed (Bittman et al., 2004).

'''EPANET''' is a [[public domain]], [[water supply network|water distribution system]] modeling software package developed by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]'s (EPA) Water Supply and Water Resources Division. It performs extended-period simulation of hydraulic and water-quality behavior within pressurized pipe networks and is designed to be "a research tool that improves our understanding of the movement and fate of drinking-water constituents within distribution systems".&lt;ref&gt;Rossman, L. A., "Computer Models/EPANET" in L. Mays, ed., Water Distribution Systems Handbook, Chapter 12, McGraw-Hill companies, Inc., New York, NY, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; EPANET first appeared in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Rossman, L. A., "the EPANET Water Quality Model" in B. Coulbeck, ed., Integrated Computer Applications in Water Supply, Vol. 2, Research Studies Press Ltd., Somerset, England, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EPANET 2''' is available both as a standalone program and as an open-source toolkit ([[Application Programming Interface]] in [[C programming language|C]]). Its computational engine is used by many software companies that developed more powerful, proprietary packages, often [[GIS]]-centric. The EPANET ".inp" input file format,&lt;ref name=manual2000&gt;Rossman, L. A., "EPANET 2 Users Manual", 2000&lt;/ref&gt; which represents network topology, water consumption, and control rules, is supported by many free and commercial modeling packages. Therefore, it is arguably considered as the [[De facto standard|industry standard]].

==Features==
EPANET provides an integrated environment for editing network input data, running hydraulic and [[water quality]] simulations, and viewing the results in a variety of formats. EPANET provides a fully equipped and extended period of hydraulic analysis that can handle systems of any size. The package also supports the simulation of spatially and temporally varying water demand, constant or variable speed pumps, and the minor head losses for bends and fittings. The modeling provides information such as flows in pipes, pressures at junctions, propagation of a contaminant, chlorine concentration, water age, and even alternative scenario analysis. This helps to compute pumping energy and cost and then model various types of [[valve]]s, including shutoffs, check pressure regulating and [[flow control (data)|flow control]].

EPANET’s water quality modeling functionality allows users to analyze the movement of a reactive or non-reactive [[Flow tracer|tracer]] material which spreads through the network over time. It rates the reactive material as is grows, tracks the percentage of flow from the given nodes. The package employs the global reaction rate [[coefficient]] which can be modified on a pipe-by-pipe basis. The storage tanks can be modeled as complete mix, [[plug flow]] or two-compartment reactors.

The [[Visual networking|visual network editor]] of EPANET simplifies the process of building piping network models and editing their properties. These various types of [[data reporting]] visualization tools are used to assist to analyze the networks, which include the graphics views, tabular views, and special reports.

==Hydraulic simulation==

===Headloss in pipe segments===
EPANET hydraulics engine computes headlosses along the pipes by using one of the three formulas:
*[[Hazen–Williams equation|Hazen-Williams]] formula: used to model full flow conditions under simplified conditions (turbulent flow, temperature around 60 degrees Fahrenheit, and viscosity similar to water) http://www.epa.gov/nrmrl/wswrd/dw/epanet.html
*[[Darcy-Weisbach friction factor|Darcy-Weisbach]] formula: used to model pressurized flow under a broader range of hydraulic conditions
*Chezy-Manning formula: used to model pressurized flow by using Chezy's roughness coefficients for Manning's equation
Since the pipe segment headloss equation is used within the network solver, the formula above is selected for the entire model.

===Head-flow Curves of Pumps===
Within EPANET, [[Centrifugal pump|pumps]] are modeled using a head-flow curve, which defines the relationship between hydraulic head imparted to the system by the pump and flow conveyed by the pump. The model calculates the flow conveyed by the pump element for a given system head condition based on this curve. EPANET can also model a pump as a constant power input, effectively adding a given amount of energy to the system downstream of the pump element.&lt;ref name=manual2000 /&gt;

===Network solver===
The network hydraulics solver employed by EPANET uses the "Gradient Method" first proposed by Todini and Pilati,&lt;ref&gt;Todini E. &amp; Pilati S. 1988. A gradient algorithm for the analysis of pipe networks. In B. Coulbeck and C.H. Orr (eds) Computer Applications in Water Supply, Volume 1 (System analysis and simulation), John Wiley &amp; Sons, London, pp. 1-20.&lt;/ref&gt; which is a variant of [[Newton-Raphson]] method.

==Water-quality simulation==
EPANET includes the capability to model water age and predict flow of non-reactive and, under simplified conditions, reactive materials.&lt;ref name=manual2000 /&gt; This capability is frequently used to predict chlorine residuals within water distribution systems. While the internal water quality simulation capabilities only evaluates decay or growth of a single constituent, an extension is available (EPANET-MSX), which allows modeling of interactions between constituents.

==EPANET Toolkit==
EPANET's computational engine is available for download as a separate [[Dynamic-link library|dynamic link library]] for incorporation into other applications.&lt;ref&gt;United States Environmental Protection Agency [http://www.epa.gov/nrmrl/wswrd/dw/epanet.html "Programmer's Toolkit"], [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], Updated 5 January 2012. Retrieved on 21 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The source code for EPANET 2 is available on the EPA's EPANET website.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/nrmrl/wswrd/dw/epanet.html#downloads&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the EPANET toolkit, written in C, was rewritten in Java in a more [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] style. The code in Java is available on Github: https://github.com/Baseform/Baseform-Epanet-Java-Library.

==Compatibility==
EPANET uses a binary file format, but also includes the capability for importing and exporting data in [[AutoCAD DXF|dxf]], metafile, and ASCII file formats. EPANET's ASCII file format is called an input file within EPANET, and uses a file extension ".inp".&lt;ref name=manual2000 /&gt; The input file can include data describing network topology, water consumption, and control rules, and is supported by many free and commercial modeling packages.

While EPANET is used as the computational engine for most water distribution system models, most models are developed and maintained in hydraulic modeling packages based on EPANET's computational engine. Some of the major hydraulic modeling packages are:

'''Ecophysiology''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|οἶκος}}, ''oikos'', "house(hold)"; {{lang|grc|φύσις}}, ''physis'', "nature, origin"; and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]''), '''environmental physiology''' or '''physiological ecology''' is a [[biology|biological]] [[List of academic disciplines|discipline]] that studies the adaptation of an [[organism]]'s [[physiology]] to environmental conditions.  It is closely related to [[comparative physiology]] and [[evolutionary physiology]]. [[Ernst Haeckel]]'s coinage '''bionomy''' is sometimes employed as a synonym.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Haeckel, ''The Wonders of Life'': "I proposed long ago to call this special part of biology œcology (the science of home-relations) or bionomy." "&lt;/ref&gt;

Plant ecophysiology is concerned largely with two topics: mechanisms (how plants sense and respond to environmental change) and scaling or integration (how the responses to highly variable conditions—for example, gradients from full sunlight to 95% shade within tree canopies—are coordinated with one another), and how their collective effect on plant growth and gas exchange can be understood on this basis.

In many cases, [[animal]]s are able to escape unfavourable and changing environmental factors such as heat, cold, drought or floods, while [[plant]]s are unable to move away and therefore must endure the adverse conditions or perish (animals go places, plants grow places). Plants are therefore [[phenotypic plasticity|phenotypically plastic]] and have an impressive array of [[gene]]s that aid in adapting to changing conditions. It is hypothesized that this large number of genes can be partly explained by plant species' need to adapt to a wider range of conditions.

As with most abiotic factors, light intensity (irradiance) can be both suboptimal and excessive. Light intensity is also an important component in determining the temperature of plant organs (energy budget).The light response curve of net photosynthesis ([[PI curve]]) is particularly useful in characterising a plant's tolerance to different light intensities.

Suboptimal light (shade) typically occurs at the base of a plant canopy or in an understory environment. [[Shade tolerant]] plants have a range of adaptations to help them survive the altered quantity and quality of light typical of shade environments.

Excess light occurs at the top of canopies and on open ground when cloud cover is low and the sun's zenith angle is low, typically this occurs in the tropics and at high altitudes. Excess light incident on a leaf can result in [[photoinhibition]] and [[photodestruction]]. Plants adapted to high light environments have a range of adaptations to avoid or dissipate the excess light energy, as well as mechanisms that reduce the amount of injury caused.

===Temperature===
{{See also|Fire_ecology#Immediate_Biotic_responses_and_adaptations|l1=Plant adaptations to wildfires}}
In response to extremes of temperature, plants can produce various [[protein]]s. These protect them from the damaging effects of ice formation and falling rates of [[enzyme]] catalysis at low temperatures, and from enzyme [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturation]] and increased [[photorespiration]] at high temperatures. As temperatures fall, production of [[antifreeze protein]]s and [[dehydrin]]s increases. As temperatures rise, production of [[heat shock protein]]s increases. Metabolic imbalances associated with temperature extremes result in the build-up of [[reactive oxygen species]], which can be countered by [[antioxidant]] systems. [[Cell membrane]]s are also affected by changes in temperature and can cause the membrane to lose its [[Fluid mosaic#Structure and the Fluid mosaic model|fluid properties]] and become a gel in cold conditions or to become leaky in hot conditions. This can affect the movement of compounds across the membrane. To prevent these changes, plants can change the composition of their membranes. In cold conditions, more [[Fatty acid#Unsaturated fatty acids|unsaturated fatty acids]] are placed in the membrane and in hot conditions more [[saturation (chemistry)|saturated]] fatty acids are inserted.

Plants can avoid overheating by minimising the amount of sunlight absorbed and by enhancing the cooling effects of wind and [[transpiration]]. Plants can reduce light absorption using reflective leaf hairs, scales, and waxes. These features are so common in warm dry regions that these habitats can be seen to form a ‘silvery landscape’ as the light scatters off the canopies.&lt;ref name="Lee2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Lee|title=Nature's Palette: The Science of Plant Color|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M3e5wyFJY-8C|accessdate=16 April 2013|date=3 September 2010|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-47105-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some species, such as ''Macroptilium purpureum'', can move their leaves throughout the day so that they are always orientated to avoid the sun (''[[paraheliotropism]]'').&lt;ref name="Plant Ecology"&gt;{{cite book|title=Plant Ecology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rDo8hLWtWzgC|accessdate=16 April 2013|date=24 May 2005|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-20833-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge of these mechanisms has been key to [[breeding for heat stress tolerance]] in agricultural plants.

Plants can avoid the full impact of low temperature by altering their [[microclimate]]. For example, ''[[Raoulia]]'' plants found in the uplands of New Zealand are said to resemble ‘vegetable sheep’ as they form tight cushion-like clumps to insulate the most vulnerable plant parts and shield them from cooling winds. The same principle has been applied in agriculture by using [[plastic mulch]] to insulate the growing points of crops in cool climates in order to boost plant growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Farrell | first1 = A.

===Water===
{{see also|Moisture stress}}
Too much or too little water can damage plants. If there is too little water then tissues will dehydrate and the plant may die. If the soil becomes waterlogged then the soil will become anoxic (low in oxygen), which can kill the roots of the plant.

The ability of plants to access water depends on the structure of their roots and on the [[water potential]] of the root cells. When soil water content is low, plants can alter their water potential to maintain a flow of water into the roots and up to the leaves ([[Soil plant atmosphere continuum]]). This remarkable mechanism allows plants to lift water as high as 120 m by harnessing the gradient created by [[transpiration]] from the leaves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://5e.plantphys.net/article.php?ch=&amp;id=100 Lincoln Taiz and Eduardo Zeiger, A Companion to Plant Physiology]&lt;/ref&gt;

In very dry soil, plants close their stomata to reduce transpiration and prevent water loss. The closing of the stomata is often mediated by chemical signals from the root (i.e., [[abscisic acid]]). In irrigated fields, the fact that plants close their stomata in response to drying of the roots can be exploited to ‘trick’ plants into using less water without reducing yields (see [[partial rootzone drying]]). The use of this technique was largely developed by Dr Peter Dry and colleagues in Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Stoll | first1 = M. | last2 = Loveys | first2 = B. | last3 = Dry | first3 = P. | doi = 10.1093/jexbot/51.350.1627 | title = Hormonal changes induced by partial rootzone drying of irrigated grapevine | journal = Journal of Experimental Botany | volume = 51 | issue = 350 | pages = 1627–1634 | year = 2000 | pmid =  11006312| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/australia_innovates/?Section_id=1000&amp;article_id=10014&amp;behaviour=view_article Partial Rootzone Drying: A History]&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[nominative determinism]]).

If drought continues, the plant tissues will dehydrate, resulting in a loss of [[turgor pressure]] that is visible as [[wilting]]. As well as closing their stomata, most plants can also respond to drought by altering their water potential ([[osmotic adjustment]]) and increasing root growth. Plants that are adapted to dry environments ([[Xerophytes]]) have a range of more specialized mechanisms to maintain water and/or protect tissues when desiccation occurs.

Waterlogging reduces the supply of oxygen to the roots and can kill a plant within days. Plants cannot avoid waterlogging, but many species overcome the lack of oxygen in the soil by transporting oxygen to the root from tissues that are not submerged. Species that are tolerant of waterlogging develop specialised roots near the soil surface and [[aerenchyma]] to allow the diffusion of oxygen from the shoot to the root. Roots that are not killed outright may also switch to less oxygen-hungry forms of cellular respiration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plantstress.com/Articles/index.asp The Impact of Flooding Stress on Plants and Crops]&lt;/ref&gt; Species that are frequently submerged have evolved more elaborate mechanisms that maintain root oxygen levels, perhaps most notable being the dramatic aerial roots seen in [[Mangrove]] forests.

However, for many terminally overwatered houseplants, the initial symptoms of waterlogging can resemble those due to drought. This is particularly true for flood-sensitive plants that show drooping of their leaves due to [[epinasty]] (rather than wilting).

==={{co2}} concentration===
{{co2}} is vital for plant growth, as it is the substrate for photosynthesis. Plants take in {{co2}} through [[stomatal]] pores on their leaves. At the same time as {{co2}} enters the stomata, moisture escapes. This trade-off between {{co2}} gain and water loss is central to plant productivity. The trade-off is all the more critical as [[Rubisco]], the enzyme used to capture {{co2}}, is efficient only when there is a high concentration of {{co2}} in the leaf. Some plants overcome this difficulty by concentrating {{co2}} within their leaves using [[C4 carbon fixation|{{c4}} carbon fixation]] or [[Crassulacean acid metabolism]]. However, most species used [[C3 carbon fixation|{{c3}} carbon fixation]] and must open their stomata to take in {{co2}} whenever photosynthesis is taking place.
[[File:Plant Productivity in a Warming World.ogv|thumb|Plant Productivity in a Warming World]] The concentration of [[Carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere|{{co2}} in the atmosphere]] is rising due to [[deforestation]] and the combustion of [[fossil fuels]]. This would be expected to increase the efficiency of photosynthesis and possibly increase the overall rate of plant growth. This possibility has attracted considerable interest in recent years, as an increased rate of plant growth could absorb some of the excess {{co2}} and reduce the rate of [[global warming]]. Extensive experiments growing plants under elevated {{co2}} using [[Free-Air Concentration Enrichment]] have shown that photosynthetic efficiency does indeed increase. Plant growth rates also increase, by an average of 17% for above-ground tissue and 30% for below-ground tissue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/effects-of-rising-atmospheric-concentrations-of-carbon-13254108 Effects of Rising Atmospheric Concentrations of Carbon Dioxide on Plants]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ainsworth | first1 = E.

Overall, these observations point to the importance of avoiding further increases in atmospheric {{co2}} rather than risking [[runaway climate change]].

===Wind===
{{See also| wind pollination|seed dispersal}}

Wind has three very different effects on plants.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gardiner|first=Barry|last2=Berry|first2=Peter|last3=Moulia|first3=Bruno|title=Review: Wind impacts on plant growth, mechanics and damage|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0168945216300061|journal=Plant Science|volume=245|pages=94–118|doi=10.1016/j.plantsci.2016.01.006|pmid=26940495|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It affects the exchanges of mass (water evaporation, {{co2}})  and of energy (heat) between the plant and the atmosphere by renewing the air at the contact with the leaves ([[convection]]).
* It is sensed as signal driving a wind-acclimation syndrome by the plant known as [[thigmomorphogenesis]], leading to modified growth and development and eventually to wind hardening.
* Its [[Drag (physics)|drag force]] can damage the plant (leaf abrasion, wind ruptures in branches and stems and [[windthrow]]s and toppling in trees and [[Lodging (agriculture)|lodging]] in crops).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=J. R.|last2=Tombleson|first2=J. D.|last3=Turner|first3=J.

==== Exchange of mass and energy ====

Wind influences the way leaves regulate moisture, heat, and carbon dioxide. When no wind is present, a layer of still air builds up around each leaf. This is known as the [[boundary layer]] and in effect insulates the leaf from the environment, providing an atmosphere rich in moisture and less prone to convective heating or cooling. As wind speed increases, the leaf environment becomes more closely linked to the surrounding environment. It may become difficult for the plant to retain moisture as it is exposed to dry air. On the other hand, a moderately high wind allows the plant to cool its leaves more easily when exposed to full sunlight. Plants are not entirely passive in their interaction with wind. Plants can make their leaves less vulnerable to changes in wind speed, by coating their leaves in fine hairs ([[trichomes]]) to break up the air flow and increase the boundary layer. In fact, leaf and canopy dimensions are often finely controlled to manipulate the boundary layer depending on the prevailing environmental conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Vogel | first1 = S. | title = Leaves in the lowest and highest winds: Temperature, force and shape | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-8137.2009.02854.x | journal = New Phytologist | volume = 183 | issue = 1 | pages = 13–26 | year = 2009 | pmid =  19413689| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Acclimation ====

Plants can sense the wind through the deformation of its tissues. This signal leads to inhibits the elongation and stimulates the radial expansion of their shoots, while increasing the development of their root system. This syndrome of responses known as [[thigmomorphogenesis]] results in shorter, stockier plants with strengthened stems, as well as to an improved ancorage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jaffe|first=M. J.|date=1973-06-01|title=Thigmomorphogenesis: The response of plant growth and development to mechanical stimulation|journal=Planta|language=en|volume=114|issue=2|pages=143–157|doi=10.1007/bf00387472|pmid=24458719|issn=0032-0935}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was once believed that this occurs mostly in very windy areas. But it has been found that it happens even in areas with moderate winds, so that wind-induced signal were found to be a major ecological factor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ennos|first=A|title=Wind as an ecological factor|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0169534796100665|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=12|issue=3|pages=108–111|doi=10.1016/s0169-5347(96)10066-5|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trees have a particularly well-developed capacity to reinforce their trunks when exposed to wind.From the parctical size, this realisation prompted arboriculturalists in the UK in the 1960s to move away from the practice of staking young [[amenity tree]]s to offer artificial support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Grace|first1=J.|year=1988|title=3.

==== Wind damage ====

Wind can damage most of the organs of the plants. Leaf abrasion (due to the rubbing of leaves and branches  or to the effect of air-borne particle such as sand) and leaf of branch breakage are rather common phenomena, that plants have to accommodate. In the more extreme cases, plants can be mortally damaged or uprooted by wind. This has been a major selective pressure acting over terrestrial plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rowe|first=Nick|last2=Speck|first2=Thomas|date=2005-04-01|title=Plant growth forms: an ecological and evolutionary perspective|journal=New Phytologist|language=en|volume=166|issue=1|pages=61–72|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.2004.01309.x|pmid=15760351|issn=1469-8137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, it is one of the major threatening for agriculture and forestry even in temperate zones.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is worse for agriculture in hurricane-prone regions, such as the banana-growing Windward Islands in the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2010/dec/23/windward-islands-caribbean-farmers-bananas]&lt;/ref&gt;

When this type of [[disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]] occurs in natural systems, the only solution is to ensure that there is an adequate stock of seeds or seedlings to quickly take the place of the mature plants that have been lost- although, in many cases a [[Ecological succession|successional]] stage will be needed before the ecosystem can be restored to its former state.

== Animals ==

=== Humans ===

[[environment (biophysical)|The environment]] can have major influences on human [[physiology]]. Environmental effects on human physiology are numerous; one of the most carefully studied effects is the alterations in [[thermoregulation]] in the body due to outside [[stress (medicine)|stresses]]. This is necessary because in order for [[enzyme]]s to function, [[blood]] to flow, and for various body [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]]s to operate, [[temperature]] must remain at consistent, balanced levels.

====Thermoregulation====
To achieve this, the body alters three main things to achieve a constant, normal body temperature:

*Heat transfer to the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]]
*The rate of [[evaporation]]
*The rate of heat production

The hypothalamus plays an important role in thermoregulation. It connects to thermal receptors in the [[dermis]], and detects changes in surrounding blood to make decisions of whether to stimulate internal heat production, or to stimulate evaporation.

There are two main types of stresses that can be experienced due to extreme environmental temperatures: [[heat stress]] and [[cold stress]].

Heat stress is physiologically combated in four ways: [[thermal radiation|radiation]], [[heat conduction|conduction]], [[convection]], and [[evaporation]]. Cold stress is physiologically combated by shivering, accumulation of [[body fat]], circulatory adaptations (that provide an efficient transfer of heat to the epidermis), and increased blood flow to the extremities.

There is one part of the body fully equipped to deal with cold stress. The [[respiratory system]] protects itself against damage by warming the incoming air to 80-90 degrees Fahrenheit before it reaches the [[bronchi]]. This means that not even the most frigid of temperatures can damage the respiratory tract.

In both types of temperature related stress, it is important to remain well-hydrated. Hydration reduces cardiovascular strain, enhances the ability of energy processes to occur, and reduces feelings of exhaustion.

====Altitude====
Extreme temperatures are not the only obstacles that humans face. [[High altitude]]s also pose serious physiological challenges on the body. Some of these effects are reduced [[Arterial blood gas|arterial &lt;math&gt;P_{{\mathrm{O}}_2}&lt;/math&gt;]], the rebalancing of the [[acid-base content in body fluids]], increased [[hemoglobin]], increased [[Red blood cell|RBC]] synthesis, enhanced circulation, and increased levels of the [[glycolysis]] byproduct [[2,3 diphosphoglycerate]], which promotes off-loading of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by [[hemoglobin]] in the [[hypoxic tissues]].

Environmental factors can play a huge role in the human body's fight for [[homeostasis]]. However, humans have found ways to adapt, both [[physiology|physiologically]] and tangibly.

=== Scientists ===

[[George A. Bartholomew]] (1919–2006) was a founder of animal physiological ecology. He served on the faculty at [[UCLA]] from 1947 to 1989, and almost 1,200 individuals can trace their academic lineages to him.&lt;ref name='bargentree'&gt;[http://bartgen.bio.uci.edu/tree BartGen Tree] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120707042447/http://bartgen.bio.uci.edu/tree/ |date=7 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Knut Schmidt-Nielsen]] (1915–2007) was also an important contributor to this specific scientific field as well as [[comparative physiology]].

[[Hermann Rahn]] (1912–1990) was an early leader in the field of environmental physiology. Starting out in the field of zoology with a PhD from [[University of Rochester]] (1933), Rahn began teaching physiology at the [[University of Rochester]] in 1941.  It is there that he partnered with [[Wallace O. Fenn]] to publish ''A Graphical Analysis of the Respiratory Gas Exchange'' in 1955.  This paper included the landmark O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; diagram, which formed basis for much of Rahn's future work.  Rahn's research into applications of this diagram led to the development of aerospace medicine and advancements in hyperbaric breathing and high-altitude respiration.  Rahn later joined the [[University at Buffalo]] in 1956 as the Lawrence D. Bell Professor and Chairman of the Department of Physiology.  As Chairman, Rahn surrounded himself with outstanding faculty and made the University an international research center in environmental physiology.

These characteristics are the result of the alignment and shape of the individual ridge units and the relationship between them, as well as the effects of [[Sweat pore|pore]]s that are close to the edge of the ridges. These shapes are only of use when quality of the [[friction]] ridges found in both the latent fingerprint and the exemplar print is high. The method was pioneered by Salil Chatterjee in 1962, who created it while researching the possibility of a new [[criminal]] identification method.&lt;ref&gt;The Fingerprint Science and Ridgeology, Kuhn, Kurt E.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9174">'''Emotional Selection''' is a [[psychological]] theory of [[dream]]ing that describes dreams as modifiers and tests of [[Schema (psychology)|mental schemas]] to better meet waking [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|human needs]]. It was introduced by Richard Coutts in 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coutts|first=Richard|date=2008|title=Dreams as modifiers and tests of mental schemas: an emotional selection hypothesis|url=http://prx.sagepub.com/content/102/2/561.abstract|journal=Psychological Reports|doi=10.2466/pr0.102.2.561-574|pmid=18567225|access-date=|volume=102|pages=561–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; and refined by him in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coutts|first=Richard|date=2010|title=A Pilot Study for the Analysis of Dream Reports Using Maslow's Need Categories: An Extension to the Emotional Selection Hypothesis|url=http://prx.sagepub.com/content/107/2/659.abstract|journal=Psychological Reports|doi=10.2466/09.PR0.107.5.659-673|pmid=21117494|access-date=|volume=107|pages=659–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to emotional selection, during [[non-REM sleep]], the mind processes [[dream]]s with content intended to improve the ability of [[Schema (psychology)|mental schemas]]. For example, individuals struggling with self-perceptions of incompetence may process dreams in which they successfully navigate complex situations, those who struggle to meet belongingness needs may have dreams of entering a partner relationship, and so forth. Regardless, the theme of the non-REM dream is tentatively [[accommodation (psychology)|accommodated]] by [[Schema (psychology)|mental schemas]]. Because [[Schema (psychology)|schemas]] coexist as a [[wikt:network|network]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The construction of reality|author1=Arbib, M.A |author2= Hesse, M.B. |last-author-amp=yes |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1986|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[accommodation (psychology)|accommodations]] can introduce accidental, maladaptive conflicts&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The equilibration of cognitive structures: the central problem of intellectual development|last=Piaget|first=J.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1975|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore are ideally tested prior to full integration. Therefore, during subsequent [[REM sleep]], a second set of [[dream]]s is executed in the form of [[scenario testing|test scenarios]]. If [[Schema (psychology)|schema]] [[accommodation (psychology)|accommodations]] performed during prior [[non-REM]] [[dream]]s alleviate anxiety, frustration, sadness, or in other ways appear [[emotions|emotionally]] adaptive during [[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM]] dream tests, they would be [[Selection (biology)|selected]] for retention. Those [[accommodation (psychology)|accommodations]] that compare negatively to existing, unchanged [[Schema (psychology)|schemas]] would be abandoned or further modified and tested.

REM dreams are often described in the academic literature as having bizarre themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Revonsuo, A. |author2= Salmivalli, C. |last-author-amp=yes |date=1995|title=A content analysis of bizarre elements in dreams|url=|journal=Dreaming|doi=10.1037/h0094433|pmid=|access-date= |volume=5 |pages=169–187}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Coutts, this description fits neatly in emotional selection. During the development of complex systems, engineers often test with rigorous, outwardly bizarre scenarios, such as intentionally crashing expensive automobiles, dropping functioning electronics onto hard surfaces, or vibrating scale models of buildings on shake tables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Flying buttresses, entropy, and o-rings: the world of an engineer|last=Adams|first=J. L.|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1991|isbn=9780674306899|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such extreme, costly tests assure that designs meet specifications. The themes of REM dreams are often likewise extreme and bizarre, such as being chase down an alley by a monster, finding oneself naked in the presence of a crowd of people, or realizing that one's teeth or hair are falling out. When such themes are reviewed as tests of the ability of [[Schema (psychology)|mental schemas]] to cope with extreme stress, they appear rational.

According to emotional selection, pleasant  dreams, such as having sex, finding riches, or suddenly being able to fly, are tests that evaluate a person's ability to cope with success. This concept may appear to be an oxymoron. However, the challenges of coping with success are often poignantly depicted by people with self-destructive behaviors, such as substance abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cognitive therapy: the basics and beyond|last=Beck|first=Aaron|publisher=The Guilford Press|year=1995|isbn=978-1609185046|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Success thrust upon those with a poor self-image can cause such people to reject the notion that they are worthy of good fortune, which is why related [[Schema (psychology)|schemas]] must be modified and tested with dreams. From Coutts' 2008 paper, "People strive for independence, yet find solace in the company of others; they place a high priority on our personal safety, yet quickly jeopardize it to help [[Abraham Maslow|those]] in need; they are sexually attracted to many people, yet seek loving, [[monogamous]] relationships. [[Schema (psychology)|Schemas]] help strike the balances necessary for navigating the complex, often contradictory landscape that comprises life."&lt;ref name="Abstracts A-D"&gt;{{cite web|last=Coutts|first=Richard|title=Richard Coutts, Abstracts A-D|url=http://www.asdreams.org/2008/abstracts/abstractsA-D.html|accessdate=August 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Schema (psychology)|schemas]] targeted by emotional selection are those essential for meeting [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|human needs]], such as those define by [[Abraham Maslow]] and [[Henry Murray]]. Consequently, emotional selection theory agrees with [[evolution]]ary forces by describing a role for [[dream]]s as adaptively enhancing [[Schema (psychology)|mental schemas]].

That dreams facilitate the selection of adaptive mental schemas supports the survival value description of emotional communication in general. The German philosopher [[Ferdinand Fellmann]] proposed in 2009 emotional selection as a third form of evolutionary selection besides natural and sexual selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fellmann|first=Ferdinand|date=2009|title=Das Paar als Quelle des Selbst. Zu den soziobiologischen Grundlagen der philosophischen Anthropologie|url=|journal=Deutsche Zeitschrift für Philosophie |volume=57 |issue=5 |pages=745–56|doi=10.1524/dzph.2009.0062|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loving, monogamous [[pair bond|pair-bonding]] seems to be the favored field where sexual selection is being transformed in emotional selection specific for human courtship and mating.

The concept of emotional selection fits the recent trend of evolutionary psychology which suggests that individual differences are more than the raw material upon which natural selection operates as a homogenizing force. Instead, personality and individual differences are created by “psychosocial selection”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Evolution: The Modern Synthesis|last=Huxley|first=Julian|publisher=The MIT Press|year=1942|isbn=9780262513661|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the more intense forms of pair-bonding in primate sociality. Pair-bonds are based on detecting and supporting emotional complexity in partners with whom we maintain long-term intimate intercourse.

'''Energy modeling''' or '''energy system modeling''' is the process of building computer models of [[energy system]]s in order to analyze them.  Such models often employ [[scenario analysis]] to investigate different assumptions about the technical and economic conditions at play.  Outputs may include the system feasibility, [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, cumulative [[Cost|financial costs]], [[natural resource]] use, and [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] of the system under investigation.  A wide range of techniques are employed, ranging from broadly economic to broadly engineering.  [[Mathematical optimization]] is often used to determine the least-cost in some sense.  Models can be international, regional, national, municipal, or stand-alone in scope.  Governments maintain national energy models for [[energy policy]] development.

Energy models are usually intended to contribute variously to system operations, [[Engineering design process|engineering design]], or [[energy policy]] development.  This page concentrates on policy models.  Individual [[building energy simulation]]s are explicitly excluded, although they too are sometimes called energy models.  [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]]-style [[integrated model]]s, which also contain a representation of the world energy system and are used to examine global transformation pathways through to 2050 or 2100 are not considered here in detail.

Energy modeling has increased in importance as the need for [[climate change mitigation]] has grown in importance.  The energy supply sector is the largest contributor to global [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.&lt;ref name="bruckner-etal-2014"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report|IPCC reports]] that climate change mitigation will require a fundamental transformation of the energy supply system, including the substitution of unabated (not captured by [[Carbon capture and storage|CCS]]) [[fossil fuel]] conversion technologies by low-GHG alternatives.&lt;ref name="bruckner-etal-2014"/&gt;

== Model types ==

A wide variety of model types are in use.  This section attempts to categorize the key types and their usage.  The divisions provided are not hard and fast and mixed-paradigm models exist.  In addition, the results from more general models can be used to inform the specification of more detailed models, and vice versa, thereby creating a [[hierarchy]] of models.  Models may, in general, need to capture "complex dynamics such as:
* energy system operation
* technology stock turnover
* technology innovation
* firm and household behaviour
* energy and non-energy capital investment and labour market adjustment dynamics leading to economic restructuring
* infrastructure deployment and urban planning"&lt;ref name="pye-and-bataille-2016"&gt;

Models may be limited in scope to the electricity sector or they may attempt to cover an energy system in its entirety (see below).

Most energy models are used for [[scenario analysis]].  A scenario is a coherent set of assumptions about a possible system.  New scenarios are tested against a baseline scenario – normally [[Business as usual (business)|business-as-usual]] (BAU) – and the differences in outcome noted.

The [[time horizon]] of the model is an important consideration.  Single-year models – set in either the present or the future (say 2050) – assume a non-evolving [[Capital (economics)|capital]] structure and focus instead on the operational dynamics of the system.  Single-year models normally embed considerable temporal (typically hourly resolution) and technical detail (such as individual generation plant and transmissions lines).  Long-range models – cast over one or more decades (from the present until say 2050) – attempt to encapsulate the structural evolution of the system and are used to investigate capacity expansion and energy system transition issues.

Models often use [[mathematical optimization]] to solve for redundancy in the specification of the system.  Some of the techniques used derive from [[operations research]].   Most rely on [[linear programming]] (including [[Linear programming#Integer unknowns|mixed-integer programming]]), although some use [[nonlinear programming]].  Solvers may use classical or [[Genetic programming|genetic optimisation]], such as [[CMA-ES]].  Models may be recursive-dynamic, solving sequentially for each time interval, and thus evolving through time.  Or they may be framed as a single forward-looking intertemporal problem, and thereby assume perfect foresight.  Single-year engineering-based models usually attempt to minimize the [[Long run and short run|short-run]] financial cost, while single-year market-based models use optimization to determine [[market clearing]].  Long-range models, usually spanning decades, attempt to minimize both the short and long-run costs as a single intertemporal problem.

The demand-side (or end-user domain) has historically received relatively scant attention, often modeled by just a simple [[demand curve]].  End-user energy demand curves, in the short-run at least, are normally found to be highly [[Elasticity (economics)|inelastic]].

As [[intermittent energy source]]s and [[energy demand management]] grow in importance, models have needed to adopt an hourly temporal resolution in order to better capture their real-time dynamics.&lt;ref name="acatech-etal-2016b"&gt;

=== Electricity sector models ===

Electricity sector models are used to model electricity systems.  The scope may be national or regional, depending on circumstances.  For instance, given the presence of national interconnectors, the western European electricity system may be modeled in its entirety.

Engineering-based models usually contain a good characterization of the technologies involved, including the high-voltage [[Alternating current|AC]] [[transmission grid]] where appropriate.  Some models (for instance, models for Germany) may assume a single common bus or "copper plate" where the grid is strong.  The demand-side in electricity sector models is typically represented by a fixed [[load profile]].

Market-based models, in addition, represent the prevailing [[electricity market]], which may include [[Electricity market#Bid-based, security-constrained, economic dispatch with nodal prices|nodal pricing]].

[[Game theory]] and [[agent-based model]]s are used to capture and study [[Perfect competition|strategic behavior]] within [[electricity market]]s.&lt;ref name="david-and-wen-2000"&gt;

=== Energy system models ===

In addition to the electricity sector, energy system models include the heat, gas, mobility, and other sectors as appropriate.&lt;ref name="abrell-and-weigt-2012"&gt;
{{cite news

 | doi = 10.1007/s11067-011-9160-0
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Energy system models are often national in scope, but may be municipal or international.

So-called ''top-down models'' are broadly economic in nature and based on either [[partial equilibrium]] or [[Computable general equilibrium|general equilibrium]].  General equilibrium models represent a specialized activity and require dedicated [[algorithms]].  Partial equilibrium models are more common.

So-called ''bottom-up models'' capture the engineering well and often rely on techniques from [[operations research]].  Individual plants are characterized by their efficiency curves (also known as input/output relations), nameplate capacities, investment costs ([[Capital expenditure|capex]]), and operating costs ([[Operating expense|opex]]).  Some models allow for these parameters to depend on external conditions, such as ambient temperature.&lt;ref name="bruckner-etal-2003"&gt;

== Established models ==

This section lists some of the major models in use.  These are typically run by national governments.

=== LEAP ===

LEAP (Long range Energy Alternatives Planning System) is a software tool for [[energy policy]] analysis and [[climate change mitigation]] assessment.&lt;ref name="sei-2012"&gt;
{{cite book
 | author = SEI
 | title = LEAP: Long range Energy Alternatives Planning System: a tool for energy policy analysis and climate change mitigation assessment – Flyer
 | date = May 2012
 | publisher = [[Stockholm Environment Institute]] (SEI) US Center

{{cite web
 | title = LEAP: tools for sustainable energy analysis 
 | url = https://www.energycommunity.org/default.asp
 | access-date = 2016-05-04
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  LEAP was developed at the [[Stockholm Environment Institute]]'s (SEI) US Center.  LEAP can be used to examine city, statewide, national, and regional energy systems.  LEAP is normally used for forecast studies of between 20–50 years.  Most of its calculations occur at yearly intervals.  LEAP allows policy analysts to create and evaluate alternative [[Scenario analysis|scenarios]] and to compare their energy requirements, [[Social cost|social costs and benefits]], and environmental impacts.

=== Power System Simulation ===
[[General Electric]]'s MAPS (Multi-Area Production Simulation) is a production simulation model used by various [[Regional transmission organization (North America)|Regional Transmission Organizations]] and [[Regional transmission organization (North America)#Independent System Operators (ISOs)|Independent System Operators]] in the United States to plan for the economic impact of proposed electric transmission and generation facilities in FERC-regulated electric wholesale markets. Portions of the model may also be used for the commitment and dispatch phase (updated on 5 minute intervals) in operation of wholesale electric markets for RTO and ISO regions. [[ABB]]'s PROMOD is a similar software package. These ISO and RTO regions also utilize a GE software package called MARS (Multi-Area Reliability Simulation) to ensure the power system meets reliability criteria (a loss-of-load-expectation (LOLE) of no greater than 0.1 days per year). Further, a GE software package called PSLF (Positive Sequence Load Flow) and a [[Siemens]] software package called PSSE (Power System Simulation for Engineering) analyzes load flow on the power system for short-circuits and stability during preliminary planning studies by RTOs and ISOs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ABB PROMOD Market Simulation|url=https://new.abb.com/enterprise-software/energy-portfolio-management/market-analysis/promod|work=new.abb.com|accessdate=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GE Multi-Area Production Simulation|url=https://www.geenergyconsulting.com/practice-area/software-products/maps|work=www.geenergyconsulting.com|accessdate=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GE Multi-Area Reliability Simulation|url=https://www.geenergyconsulting.com/practice-area/software-products/mars|work=www.geenergyconsulting.com|accessdate=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GE Power System Load Flow Simulation|url=https://www.geenergyconsulting.com/practice-area/software-products/pslf|work=www.geenergyconsulting.com|accessdate=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NYSRC 2018 IRM Study Report|url=http://www.nysrc.org/pdf/Reports/2018%20IRM%20Study%20Report%20Final%2012-8-17[2098].pdf|p=2|work=www.nysrc.org|date=December 8, 2017|accessdate=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NYISO Notice to Stakeholders of Request for MAPS data|url=https://www.nyiso.com/public/webdocs/markets_operations/documents/Legal_and_Regulatory/Notices/MP_Notices/Notice%20to%20Generators%20re%20GE%20MAPS%20database%20input%20files%20for%20CARIS%202%20-%209-9-14.pdf|work=www.nyiso.com|date=August 2000|accessdate=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Siemens PSSE|url=https://www.siemens.com/global/en/home/products/energy/services/transmission-distribution-smart-grid/consulting-and-planning/pss-software/pss-e.html|work=www.siemens.com|accessdate=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New York State Resource Planning Analysis (NYSPSC)|url=https://www.nyiso.com/public/webdocs/markets_operations/committees/mc/meeting_materials/2015-12-17/Agenda%2004_NYSDPS%20SRP%20Presentation_revised.pdf|work=www.nyiso.com|date=December 17, 2015|accessdate=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== MARKAL/TIMES ===

{{main|MARKAL}}

MARKAL (MARKet ALlocation) is an integrated energy systems modeling platform, used to analyze energy, economic, and environmental issues at the global, national, and municipal level over time-frames of up to several decades.  MARKAL can be used to quantify the impacts of policy options on technology development and natural resource depletion.  The software was developed by the Energy Technology Systems Analysis Programme (ETSAP) of the [[International Energy Agency]] (IEA) over a period of almost two decades.

TIMES (The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System) is an evolution of MARKAL – both energy models have many similarities.&lt;ref name="comparison-times-markal-2009"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Both models are technology explicit, dynamic [[partial equilibrium]] models of [[energy market]]s. In both cases, the equilibrium is determined by maximizing the total [[Economic surplus|consumer and producer surplus]] via [[linear programming]].  Both MARKAL and TIMES are written in [[General Algebraic Modeling System|GAMS]].

The TIMES model generator was also developed under the Energy Technology Systems Analysis Program (ETSAP).  TIMES combines two different, but complementary, systematic approaches to modeling energy – a technical engineering approach and an economic approach.  TIMES is a technology rich, bottom-up model generator, which uses [[linear programming]] to produce a least-cost energy system, optimized according to a number of user-specified constraints, over the medium to long-term.  It is used for "the exploration of possible energy futures based on contrasted scenarios".&lt;ref name="loulou-etal-2005"&gt;

=== NEMS ===

{{main|National Energy Modeling System}}

[[National Energy Modeling System|NEMS]] (National Energy Modeling System) is a long-standing United States government policy model, run by the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] (DOE).  NEMS computes equilibrium fuel prices and quantities for the US energy sector.  To do so, the software iteratively solves a sequence of linear programs and nonlinear equations.&lt;ref name="gabriel-etal-1999"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

NEMS is used to produce the ''Annual Energy Outlook'' each year – for instance in 2015.&lt;ref name="eia-2015"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==

Public policy energy models have been criticized for being insufficiently [[Open research|transparent]].  The [[source code]] and data sets should at least be available for [[peer review]], if not explicitly published.&lt;ref name="acatech-etal-2016a"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  To improve transparency and public acceptance, some models are undertaken as [[open-source software]] projects, often developing a diverse community as they proceed.  OSeMOSYS is one such example.&lt;ref name="howells-etal-2011"&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41474">The '''fine-tuned universe''' is the proposition that the conditions that allow [[life]] in the [[universe]] can occur only when certain universal [[dimensionless physical constant]]s lie within a very narrow range of values, so that if any of several fundamental constants were only slightly different, the universe would be unlikely to be conducive to the establishment and development of [[matter]], astronomical structures, elemental diversity, or life as it is understood.&lt;ref name= ":0"&gt;{{Cite book |title = Just Six Numbers: The Deep Forces That Shape The Universe|last = Rees|first = Martin |publisher = Basic Books | edition= 1st American |date = May 3, 2001 |location = New York, NY |page = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Cosmic Jackpot: Why Our Universe Is Just Right for Life|last = Davis |first = Paul|publisher = Orion Publications |year = 2007 |isbn = 978-0-61859226-5 |location = New York, NY |page = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Various possible explanations of ostensible fine-tuning are discussed among [[philosopher]]s, [[scientists]], [[theologians]], and proponents and detractors of [[creationism]]. The fine-tuned universe observation is closely related to, but is not exactly synonymous with, the [[anthropic principle]], which is often used as an explanation of apparent fine-tuning.

== History ==
In 1913, the [[chemist]] [[Lawrence Joseph Henderson]] (1878–1942) wrote ''The Fitness of the Environment,'' one of the first books to explore concepts of fine tuning in the universe. Henderson discusses the importance of [[water]] and the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] with respect to living things, pointing out that life depends entirely on the very specific environmental conditions on Earth, especially with regard to the prevalence and properties of water.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Joseph Henderson, ''The fitness of the environment: an inquiry into the biological significance of the properties of matter'' The Macmillan Company, 1913&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, physicist [[Robert H. Dicke]] claimed that certain forces in [[physics]], such as [[gravity]] and [[electromagnetism]], must be perfectly fine-tuned for life to exist anywhere in the universe.&lt;ref name=Dicke&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink = Robert Dicke |author = R.

L. ''The Oxford guide to the history of physics and astronomy, Volume 10'' 2005, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fred Hoyle]] also argued for a fine-tuned universe in his 1984 book ''Intelligent Universe''. He compares "the chance of obtaining even a single functioning protein by chance combination of [[amino acids]] to a [[star system]] full of blind men solving [[Rubik's Cube]] simultaneously".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.optcorp.com/edu/articleDetailEDU.aspx?aid=1530 Profile of Fred Hoyle at OPT] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406200054/http://www.optcorp.com/edu/articleDetailEDU.aspx?aid=1530 |date=2012-04-06 }}.

[[John Gribbin]] and [[Martin Rees]] wrote a detailed history and defence of the fine-tuning argument in their book ''Cosmic Coincidences'' (1989). According to Gribbin and Rees, "The conditions in our Universe really do seem to be uniquely suitable for life forms like ourselves, and perhaps even for any form of organic complexity. But the question remains - ''is'' the Universe tailor-made for man?"&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Gribbin. J and Rees.

== Premise ==
The premise of the fine-tuned universe assertion is that a small change in several of the dimensionless physical constants would make the universe radically different. As [[Stephen Hawking]] has noted, "The laws of science, as we know them at present, contain many fundamental numbers, like the size of the electric charge of the electron and the ratio of the masses of the proton and the electron. ... The remarkable fact is that the values of these numbers seem to have been very finely adjusted to make possible the development of life."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;[[Stephen Hawking]], 1988. ''A Brief History of Time,'' Bantam Books, {{ISBN|0-553-05340-X}}, p. 7, 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

If, for example, the strong nuclear force were 2% stronger than it is (i.e. if the [[coupling constant]] representing its strength were 2% larger), while the other constants were left unchanged, [[diproton]]s would be stable; according to physicist [[Paul Davies]], hydrogen would [[hydrogen fusion|fuse]] into them instead of [[deuterium]] and [[helium]].&lt;ref name=Davies1993&gt;Paul Davies, 1993. ''The Accidental Universe'', Cambridge University Press, p70-71&lt;/ref&gt; This would drastically alter the physics of [[star]]s, and presumably preclude the existence of life similar to what we observe on Earth. The existence of the diproton would short-circuit the slow fusion of hydrogen into deuterium. Hydrogen would fuse so easily that it is likely that all of the universe's hydrogen would be consumed in the first few minutes after the [[Big Bang]].&lt;ref name=Davies1993/&gt; This "diproton argument" is disputed by other physicists, who calculate that as long as the increase in strength is less than 50%, stellar fusion could occur despite the existence of stable diprotons.&lt;ref name =macdonald&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = MacDonald | first1 = J. | last2 = Mullan | first2 = D.

The precise formulation of the idea is made difficult by the fact that physicists do not yet know how many independent physical constants there are. The current [[standard model of particle physics]] has 25 freely adjustable parameters and [[general relativity]] has one additional parameter, the [[cosmological constant]], which is [[Accelerating expansion of the universe|known to be non-zero]], but profoundly small in value. However, because the standard model is not mathematically self-consistent under certain conditions (e.g., at very high energies, at which both [[quantum mechanics]] and [[General Relativity Theory|general relativity]] are relevant), physicists believe that it is underlaid by some other theory, such as a [[Grand Unified Theory|grand unified theory]], [[string theory]], or [[loop quantum gravity]]. In some candidate theories, the actual number of independent physical constants may be as small as one. For example, the cosmological constant may be a fundamental constant, but attempts have also been made to calculate it from other constants, and according to the author of one such calculation, "the small value of the cosmological constant is telling us that a remarkably precise and totally unexpected relation exists among all the parameters of the [[Standard Model of particle physics]], the bare cosmological constant and unknown physics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Abbott | first1 = Larry | date = 1991 | title = The Mystery of the Cosmological Constant | url = | journal = Scientific American | volume = 3 | issue = 1| page = 78 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
[[Martin Rees]] formulates the fine-tuning of the universe in terms of the following six dimensionless physical constants.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="discover nov 2000 cover story"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lemley|first1=Brad|title=Why is There Life?|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2000/nov/cover/|accessdate=23 August 2014|publisher=[[Discover magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''N'', the ratio of the [[Fine structure constant|strength of electromagnetism]] to the [[Gravitational coupling constant|strength of gravity]] for a pair of protons, is approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;. According to Rees, if it were significantly smaller, only a small and short-lived universe could exist.&lt;ref name="discover nov 2000 cover story" /&gt;
* ''Epsilon'' (ε), a measure of the nuclear efficiency of [[Stellar nucleosynthesis#Hydrogen fusion|fusion from hydrogen to helium]], is 0.007: when four nucleons fuse into helium, 0.007 (0.7%) of their mass is converted to energy. The value of ε is in part determined by the strength of the [[strong nuclear force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morison|first1=Ian|title=Introduction to astronomy and cosmology|date=2013|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, N.J.|isbn=9781118681527|chapter=9.14: A universe fit for intelligent life}}&lt;!--|accessdate=13 May 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; If ε were 0.006, only hydrogen could exist, and complex chemistry would be impossible. According to Rees, if it were above 0.008, no hydrogen would exist, as all the hydrogen would have been fused shortly after the [[big bang]]. Other physicists disagree, calculating that substantial hydrogen remains as long as the strong force coupling constant increases by less than about 50%.&lt;ref name=macdonald /&gt;&lt;ref name="discover nov 2000 cover story" /&gt;
* ''Omega'' (Ω), commonly known as the [[Density parameter#Density parameter|density parameter]], is the relative importance of gravity and expansion energy in the universe. It is the ratio of the mass density of the universe to the "critical density" and is approximately 1. If gravity were too strong compared with dark energy and the initial metric expansion, the universe would have collapsed before life could have evolved. On the other side, if gravity were too weak, no stars would have formed.&lt;ref name="discover nov 2000 cover story" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | author=[[Sean Carroll (physicist)|Sean Carroll]] and [[Michio Kaku]] | title=How the Universe Works 3 | volume=End of the Universe | date=2014 | publisher=Discovery Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Lambda'' (λ), commonly known as the [[cosmological constant]], describes the ratio of the density of [[dark energy]] to the critical energy density of the universe, given certain reasonable assumptions such as positing that dark energy density is a constant. In terms of [[Planck units]], and as a natural dimensionless value, the cosmological constant, λ, is on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−122&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[[John D. Barrow]] [https://arxiv.org/abs/1105.3105 The Value of the Cosmological Constant]&lt;/ref&gt; This is so small that it has no significant effect on cosmic structures that are smaller than a billion light-years across. If the cosmological constant were not extremely small, stars and other astronomical structures would not be able to form.&lt;ref name="discover nov 2000 cover story" /&gt;
* ''Q'', the ratio of the gravitational energy required to pull a large galaxy apart to the energy equivalent of its mass, is around 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;. If it is too small, no stars can form. If it is too large, no stars can survive because the universe is too violent, according to Rees.&lt;ref name="discover nov 2000 cover story" /&gt;
* ''D'', the number of spatial [[dimension]]s in [[spacetime]], is 3. Rees claims that life could not exist if there were 2 or 4 dimensions of spacetime nor if any other than 1 time dimension existed in spacetime.&lt;ref name="discover nov 2000 cover story" /&gt;

=== Carbon and oxygen ===
{{Further|Triple-alpha process#Improbability and fine-tuning}}

An older example is the [[Hoyle state]], the third-lowest energy state of the [[carbon-12]] nucleus, with an energy of 7.656 MeV above the ground level. According to one calculation, if the state's energy level was lower than 7.3 or greater than 7.9 MeV, insufficient carbon would exist to support life. Furthermore, to explain the universe's abundance of carbon, the Hoyle state must be further tuned to a value between 7.596 and 7.716 MeV. A similar calculation, focusing on the underlying fundamental constants that give rise to various energy levels, concludes that the [[strong force]] must be tuned to a precision of at least 0.5%, and the electromagnetic force to a precision of at least 4%, to prevent either carbon production or oxygen production from dropping significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Livio|first1=M.|last2=Hollowell|first2=D.|last3=Weiss|first3=A.|last4=Truran|first4=J.

== Disputes regarding the existence and extent of fine-tuning ==
Physicist [[Paul Davies]] has asserted that "There is now broad agreement among physicists and cosmologists that the universe is in several respects 'fine-tuned' for life". However, he continues, "the conclusion is not so much that the universe is fine-tuned for life; rather it is fine-tuned for the building blocks and environments that life requires." He also states that {{" '}}[[Anthropic principle|anthropic]]' reasoning fails to distinguish between minimally biophilic universes, in which life is permitted, but only marginally possible, and optimally biophilic universes, in which life flourishes because [[abiogenesis]] occurs frequently".&lt;ref name=Davies200&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Davies |title=How bio-friendly is the universe |date=2003 |volume=2 |issue=115 |journal=Int. J. Astrobiol. |arxiv=astro-ph/0403050 |doi=10.1017/S1473550403001514 |page=115|bibcode = 2003IJAsB...2..115D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among scientists who find the evidence persuasive, a variety of explanations have been proposed, such as the [[anthropic principle]] along with [[multiverse|multiple universes]].  [[George F. R. Ellis]] states "that no possible astronomical observations can ever see those other universes. The arguments are indirect at best. And even if the [[multiverse]] exists, it leaves the deep mysteries of nature unexplained."&lt;ref&gt;George F. R. Ellis, [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=does-the-multiverse-really-exist "Does the Multiverse Really Exist?"] Scientific American&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding recently discovered [[dark energy]] and its implication on the [[cosmological constant]], [[Leonard Susskind]] says "The great mystery is not why there is dark energy. The great mystery is why there is [[Cosmological constant#Positive value|so little of it]] [10&lt;sup&gt;−122&lt;/sup&gt;]...  The fact that we are just on the knife edge of existence, [that] if dark energy were very much bigger we wouldn’t be here, that's the mystery." A slightly larger quantity of dark energy, or a slightly larger value of the cosmological constant would have caused [[spacetime|space]] to expand rapidly enough that galaxies would not form.&lt;ref name=susskind&gt;{{cite web|last=Ananthaswamy|first=Anil|authorlink=Anil Ananthaswamy|title=Is the Universe Fine-Tuned for Life? |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/blogs/physics/2012/03/is-the-universe-fine-tuned-for-life/|publisher=Public Broadcasting Service (PBS)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Susskind does not necessarily see the universe as being fine-tuned, suggesting that some parts of the "megaverse" in which we live might just, by chance, be suitable for the emergence of life, while other parts might not be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |journal=American Scientist |title=An interview with Leonard Susskind |first1=Greg |last1=Ross|year=2015|url= http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/leonard-susskind}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steven Weinberg]] rejects the argument about the fine-tuning of the carbon cycle, arguing that "the fine-tuning of the constants of nature here does not seem so fine". He acknowledges that he currently has no explanation (apart from a multiverse) for the smallness of the cosmological constant, but cautions that "It is still too early to tell whether there is some fundamental principle that can explain why the cosmological constant must be this small."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=physlink.com |first=Steven |last=Weinberg |title=A Designer Universe? |year=1999 |url=http://www.physlink.com/Education/essay_weinberg.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Public Broadcasting System, pbs.org |title=Interview |url=https://www.pbs.org/faithandreason/transcript/wein-frame.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physicist [[Victor Stenger]] objected to the fine-tuning, and especially to [[theist]] use of fine-tuning arguments. His numerous criticisms included what he called "the wholly [[carbon chauvinism|unwarranted assumption that only carbon-based life is possible]]."&lt;ref name=stenger&gt;{{cite web|last=Stenger|first=Victor J.|authorlink=Victor_J_Stenger|title=Is The Universe Fine-Tuned For Us?|url=http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/Cosmo/FineTune.pdf#search=%22Fine%20tuned%20universe%22|publisher=University of Colorado|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716192004/http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/Cosmo/FineTune.pdf#search=%22Fine%20tuned%20universe%22|archivedate=2012-07-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, the astrophysicist Luke Barnes has criticised much of Stenger's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | arxiv=1112.4647 | author1=Barnes | title=The Fine-Tuning of the Universe for Intelligent Life | date=2011 | doi=10.1071/AS12015 | volume=29 | issue=4 | journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia | pages=529–564| bibcode=2012PASA...29..529B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The validity of [[fine tuning]] examples is sometimes questioned on the grounds that such reasoning is [[Subjectivity|subjective]] [[anthropomorphism]] applied to [[Natural science|natural]] physical constants. Critics also suggest that the fine-tuned universe assertion and the anthropic principle are essentially [[Tautology (logic)|tautologies]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite journal|last=Silk|first=Joseph|authorlink=Joseph Silk|title=Our place in the Multiverse|journal=Nature|date=September 14, 2006|volume= 443|issue= 7108|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v443/n7108/full/443145a.html|doi=10.1038/443145a|bibcode = 2006Natur.443..145S|pages=145–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fine-tuned universe argument has also been criticized as an [[Argument from ignorance|argument by lack of imagination]], as it assumes no other forms of life, sometimes referred to as [[carbon chauvinism]]. Conceptually, [[alternative biochemistry]] or other forms of life are possible.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g. Jack Cohen and Ian Stewart: ''What Does a Martian Look Like: The Science of Extraterrestrial Life'', Wiley, 2002, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding this, Stenger argued: "We have no reason to believe that our kind of carbon-based life is all that is possible. Furthermore, modern cosmology theorises that [[Multiverse|multiple universes]] may exist with different constants and laws of physics. So, it is [[selection bias|not surprising that we live in the one suited for us]]. The universe is not fine-tuned to life; life is fine-tuned to the universe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stenger|first=Victor J.|authorlink=Victor_J_Stenger|title=Flew's Flawed Science|url=http://www.mukto-mona.com/Articles/vstenger/flew.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, critics argue that humans are adapted to the universe through the process of evolution, rather than the universe being adapted to humans (see [[#In popular culture|puddle thinking]], below). They also see it as an example of the logical flaw of [[hubris]] or [[anthropocentrism]] in its assertion that humans are the purpose of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Gerald Feinberg and Robert Shapiro, "A Puddlian Fable" in Huchingson, ''Religion and the Natural Sciences'' (1993), pp. 220–221&lt;/ref&gt;

== Possible naturalistic explanations ==
There are [[Anthropic principle#String theory|fine tuning arguments]] that are [[Metaphysical naturalism#Undesigned universe|naturalistic]].&lt;ref&gt;L. Susskind, ''The cosmic landscape: string theory and the illusion of intelligent design''. (Little, Brown, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2015}} As modern cosmology developed, various hypotheses have been proposed. One is an [[Cyclic model|oscillatory universe]] or a [[multiverse]], where fundamental physical constants are postulated to resolve themselves to [[random]] values in different [[iteration]]s of reality.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, J. A. (1977) in ''Foundational problems in the special sciences'', Reidel, Dordrecht, pp 3–33&lt;/ref&gt; Under this hypothesis, separate parts of reality would have wildly different characteristics. In such scenarios, the appearance of fine-tuning is explained as a consequence of the weak [[anthropic principle]] and [[selection bias]] (specifically [[survivor bias]]) that only those universes with fundamental constants hospitable to life (such as the universe we observe) would have living beings emerge and evolve capable of contemplating the questions of origins and of fine-tuning. All other universes would go utterly unbeheld by any such beings.

=== Multiverse ===
{{Main|Multiverse}}

The Multiverse hypothesis proposes the existence of many universes with different physical constants, some of which are hospitable to intelligent life (see [[multiverse#Anthropic principle|multiverse: anthropic principle]]). Because we are intelligent beings, it is unsurprising that we find ourselves in a hospitable universe if there is such a multiverse. The Multiverse hypothesis is therefore thought to provide an elegant explanation of the finding that we exist despite the required fine-tuning. (See &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2017/entries/fine-tuning/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Friederich|first=Simon|date=2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a detailed discussion of the arguments for and against this suggested explanation.)

The multiverse idea has led to considerable research into the [[anthropic principle]] and has been of particular interest to [[particle physics|particle physicist]]s, because [[theory of everything|theories of everything]] do apparently generate large numbers of universes in which the physical constants vary widely. As yet, there is no evidence for the existence of a multiverse, but some versions of the theory do make predictions that some researchers studying [[M-theory]] and gravity leaks hope to see some evidence of soon.&lt;ref name = "Michio Kaku"&gt;''Parallel Worlds'',2005, [[Michio Kaku]], pp. 220–221&lt;/ref&gt; Some multiverse theories are not [[falsifiable]], thus scientists may be reluctant to call any multiverse theory "scientific". [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|UNC-Chapel Hill]] professor [[Laura Mersini|Laura Mersini-Houghton]] claims that the [[WMAP cold spot#Parallel universe|WMAP cold spot]] may provide testable empirical evidence for a [[multiverse|parallel universe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00vdkmj |title=Two Programmes – Horizon, 2010–2011, What Happened Before the Big Bang? |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this claim was recently refuted as the WMAP cold spot was found to be nothing more than a statistical artifact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Disks in the sky: A reassessment of the WMAP "cold spot" | journal = Astroparticle Physics | first = Ray | last = Zhang |author2=Dragan Hunterer | volume = 33 | issue = 69 (2010) | doi = 10.1016/j.astropartphys.2009.11.005 | arxiv = 0908.3988v2 | year = 2010 | pages = 69|bibcode = 2010APh....33...69Z | citeseerx = 10.1.1.249.6944 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Variants on this approach include [[Lee Smolin]]'s notion of cosmological [[natural selection]], the [[Ekpyrotic]] universe, and the Bubble universe theory.

Critics of the multiverse-related explanations argue that there is no independent evidence that other universes exist. Some criticize the inference from fine-tuning for life to a multiverse as fallacious,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=White|first=Roger|date=2000-06-01|title=Fine-Tuning and Multiple Universes|journal=Noûs|language=en|volume=34|issue=2|pages=260–276|doi=10.1111/0029-4624.00210|issn=1468-0068}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas others defend it against that challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bradley|first=Darren|date=2009|title=Multiple Universes and Observation Selection Effects|jstor=20464437|journal=American Philosophical Quarterly|volume=46|issue=1|pages=61–72|doi=10.2307/20464437|doi-broken-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Top-down cosmology ===
[[Stephen Hawking]], along with Thomas Hertog of [[CERN]], proposed that the universe's initial conditions consisted of a [[Quantum superposition|superposition]] of many possible initial conditions, only a small fraction of which contributed to the conditions we see today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In this way, top-down cosmology provides an anthropic explanation for why we find ourselves in a universe that allows matter and life, without invoking the [[Ontology|ontic]] existence of the Multiverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Hawking | first1=S.

== Alien design ==
One hypothesis is that the universe may have been designed by extra-universal [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]]s. Some believe this would solve the problem of how a designer or design team capable of fine-tuning the universe could come to exist. [[Cosmologist]] [[Alan Guth]] believes humans will in time be able to generate new universes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Malcolm W.

Retrieved on 2013-03-11.&lt;/ref&gt; This idea leads to the possibility that the extraterrestrial designer/designers are themselves the product of an evolutionary process in their own universe, which must therefore itself be able to sustain life. However it also raises the question of where that universe came from, leading to an [[infinite regress]].

The Designer Universe theory of [[John Gribbin]] suggests that the universe could have been made deliberately by an advanced civilization in another part of the [[Multiverse]], and that this civilization may have been responsible for causing the Big Bang.&lt;ref&gt;John Gribbin, In Search of the Multiverse: Parallel Worlds, Hidden Dimensions, and the Ultimate Quest for the Frontiers of Reality, 2010, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophical arguments ==

As with [[theistic evolution]], some individual scientists, [[theologian]]s, and [[philosopher]]s as well as certain religious groups argue that [[Divine Providence|providence]] or [[Creation myth|creation]] are responsible for fine-tuning.

Christian philosopher [[Alvin Plantinga]] argues that random chance, applied to a single and sole universe, only raises the question as to why this universe could be so "lucky" as to have precise conditions that support life at least at some place (the Earth) and time (within millions of years of the present). {{quote|One reaction to these apparent enormous [[Anthropic principle#Anthropic coincidences|coincidences]] is to see them as substantiating the theistic claim that the universe has been created by a personal God and as offering the material for a properly restrained theistic argument—hence the fine-tuning argument. It's as if there are a large number of dials that have to be tuned to within extremely narrow limits for life to be possible in our universe. It is extremely unlikely that this should happen by chance, but much more likely that this should happen, if there is such a person as God.|Alvin Plantinga|"The Dawkins Confusion; Naturalism ad absurdum"&lt;ref name=Plantinga&gt;Alvin Plantinga, [http://www.philvaz.com/apologetics/DawkinsGodDelusionPlantingaReview.pdf "The Dawkins Confusion; Naturalism ad absurdum,"] ''Christianity Today'', March/April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This fine-tuning of the universe is cited&lt;ref name=Craig&gt;William Lane Craig, [http://www.leaderu.com/offices/billcraig/docs/teleo.html "The Teleological Argument and the Anthropic Principle"]. leaderu.com&lt;/ref&gt; by philosopher and Christian apologist [[William Lane Craig]] as an [[Argument from design|evidence]] for the existence of [[God]] or some form of [[intelligent designer|intelligence]] capable of manipulating (or designing) the basic [[physics]] that governs the universe. Craig argues, however, "that the postulate of a divine Designer does not settle for us the religious question."

Philosopher and theologian [[Richard Swinburne]] reaches the design conclusion using [[Bayesian probability]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Swinburne]], 1990. ''Argument from the fine-tuning of the Universe'', in Physical cosmology and philosophy, J. Leslie, Editor. Collier Macmillan: New York. pp. 154–73.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2015}}

Scientist and theologian [[Alister McGrath]] has pointed out that the fine-tuning of carbon is even responsible for nature’s ability to tune itself to any degree.&lt;blockquote&gt;[The entire biological] evolutionary process depends upon the unusual chemistry of carbon, which allows it to bond to itself, as well as other elements, creating highly complex molecules that are stable over prevailing terrestrial temperatures, and are capable of conveying genetic information (especially DNA). […] Whereas it might be argued that nature creates its own fine-tuning, this can only be done if the primordial constituents of the universe are such that an evolutionary process can be initiated. The unique chemistry of carbon is the ultimate foundation of the capacity of nature to tune itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McGrath|first1=Alister E.|title=A fine-tuned universe : the quest for God in science and theology|date=2009|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|location=Louisville, KY.|isbn=978-0664233105|page=176|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biologos.org/questions/fine-tuning|title=What is the "fine-tuning" of the universe, and how does it serve as a "pointer to God"?|website=BioLogos.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221081439/http://biologos.org/questions/fine-tuning|archivedate=2014-12-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Theoretical physicist and Anglican priest [[John Polkinghorne]] has stated: "Anthropic fine tuning is too remarkable to be dismissed as just a happy accident."&lt;ref&gt;Polkinghorne, John (1998) Science and Theology: An Introduction p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intelligent design ===
Proponents of [[intelligent design]] argue that certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an [[intelligent designer|intelligent cause]], not an undirected process such as [[natural selection]]. The fine-tuned universe argument is a central premise or presented as given in many of the published works of prominent intelligent design proponents, such as [[William A. Dembski]] and [[Michael Behe]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

=== Counterarguments ===
Mark Colyvan, Jay Garfield and [[Graham Priest]] (2005) have argued that a theistic explanation for fine tuning is faulted due to fallacious probabilistic reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;Colyvan ''et al''. (2005). [http://www.colyvan.com/papers/finetuning.pdf ''Problems with the Argument from Fine Tuning'']. Synthese 145: 325-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematician Michael Ikeda and astronomer [[William H. Jefferys]] have argued that the anthropic principle and [[selection effect]] are not properly taken into account in the fine tuning argument for a designer, and that in taking them into account, fine tuning does not support the designer hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://quasar.as.utexas.edu/anthropic.html The Anthropic Principle Does Not Support Supernaturalism], Michael Ikeda, Bill Jefferys&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Ikeda]] and [[William H. Jefferys]], "The Anthropic Principle Does Not Support Supernaturalism," in ''The Improbability of God,'' Michael Martin and Ricki Monnier, Editors, pp. 150–166. Amherst, N.Y.: Prometheus Press. {{ISBN|1-59102-381-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher of science [[Elliott Sober]] makes a similar argument.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elliott Sober]], 2004. ''The Design Argument'', in The Blackwell Guide to the Philosophy of Religion, W. E. Mann, Editor. Blackwell Publishing, {{ISBN|0-631-22129-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Physicist [[Robert L. Park]] has also criticized the theistic interpretation of fine-tuning:

{{quote|If the universe was designed for life, it must be said that it is a shockingly inefficient design. There are vast reaches of the universe in which life as we know it is clearly impossible: gravitational forces would be crushing, or radiation levels are too high for complex molecules to exist, or temperatures would make the formation of stable chemical bonds impossible... Fine-tuned for life? It would make more sense to ask why God designed a universe so inhospitable to life.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert L. Park|Park, Robert L]]. (2009). ''Superstition: Belief in the Age of Science''. [[Princeton University Press]]. p. 11. {{ISBN|978-0-691-13355-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Victor Stenger argues that "The fine-tuning argument and other recent intelligent design arguments are modern versions of [[God of the gaps|God-of-the-gaps]] reasoning, where a God is deemed necessary whenever science has not fully explained some phenomenon".&lt;ref name="stenger"/&gt; Stenger argues that science may provide an explanation if a Theory of Everything is formulated, which he says may reveal connections between the physical constants. A change in one physical constant may be compensated by a change in another, suggesting that the apparent fine-tuning of the universe is a fallacy because, in hypothesizing the apparent fine-tuning, it is mistaken to vary one physical parameter while keeping the others constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chown|first=Marcus|authorlink=Marcus Chown|title=Why the universe wasn't fine-tuned for life|journal=New Scientist|date=14 June 2011|url=https://www.newscientist.com/blogs/culturelab/2011/06/why-the-universe-wasnt-fine-tuned-for-life.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
* ''Puddle theory'' is a term coined by [[Douglas Adams]] to satirize arguments that the universe is made for man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/scienceshow/stories/2006/1572643.htm|title=The anthropic universe|last=Williams|first=Robyn|date=18 February 2006|work=The Science Show|publisher=ABC Radio National|accessdate=19 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/proofs-of-god-in-a-photon-1527306.html | title=Proofs of God in a photon | last=Redfern | first=Martin|date=24 December 1995 | work=The Independent | accessdate=19 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As stated in Adams' book ''[[The Salmon of Doubt]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Adams |first=Douglas |date=2002 |title=The Salmon of Doubt: Hitchhiking the Galaxy One Last Time |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pDchCdg9K-8C&amp;q=imagine+a+puddle#v=snippet&amp;q=imagine%20a%20puddle&amp;f=false |publisher=Harmony Books |page=131 |isbn= 9781400045082|accessdate=January 9, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Imagine a puddle waking up one morning and thinking, “This is an interesting world I find myself in, an interesting hole I find myself in, fits me rather neatly, doesn't it? In fact, it fits me staggeringly well, must have been made to have me in it!” This is such a powerful idea that as the sun rises in the sky and the air heats up and as, gradually, the puddle gets smaller and smaller, it's still frantically hanging on to the notion that everything's going to be all right, because this World was meant to have him in it, was built to have him in it; so the moment he disappears catches him rather by surprise. I think this may be something we need to be on the watch out for.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jacquard.jpg|thumb|This portrait of [[Joseph Marie Jacquard|Jacquard]] was woven in [[silk]] on a Jacquard loom and required 24,000 punched cards to create (1839). It was only produced to order. [[Charles Babbage]] owned one of these portraits; it inspired him in using perforated cards in his [[analytical engine]].&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, Anthony, ed.

The '''Jacquard machine''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒakaʁ|lang}}) is a device fitted to a [[power loom]] that simplifies the process of manufacturing [[textiles]] with such complex patterns as [[Brocade (fabric)|brocade]], [[damask]] and [[matelassé]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christinalynn.com/fabric-glossary.shtml |title=Fabric Glossary |accessdate=2008-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105170019/http://www.christinalynn.com/fabric-glossary.shtml |archivedate=January 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was invented by [[Joseph Marie Jacquard]] in 1804.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Hobsbawm, "The Age of Revolution", (London 1962; repr. 2008), p.45.&lt;/ref&gt; The loom was controlled by a "chain of cards"; a number of [[punched card]]s laced together into a continuous sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal 
  |title= The London journal of arts and sciences (and repertory of patent inventions) |date= June 1, 1866 |page= 334

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple rows of holes were punched on each card, with one complete card corresponding to one row of the design. Several such paper cards, generally white in color, can be seen in the images below. Chains, like Bouchon's earlier use of [[paper tape]], allowed sequences of any length to be constructed, not limited by the size of a card.

It is based on earlier inventions by the Frenchmen [[Basile Bouchon]] (1725), Jean Baptiste Falcon (1728), and [[Jacques Vaucanson]] (1740).&lt;ref&gt;[[#RAZY|C. Razy]] p.120 (1913)&lt;/ref&gt; A static display of a Jacquard loom is the centrepiece of the [[Musée des Tissus et des Arts décoratifs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museedestissus.com |title=Musée des Tissus et des Arts Décoratifs |publisher=Museedestissus.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Lyon.  Live displays of a Jacquard loom are available at a few private museums around Lyon and also twice a day at La Maison des Canuts, as well as at other locations around the world.

Both the Jacquard process and the necessary loom attachment are named after their inventor. This mechanism is probably one of the most important weaving inventions as Jacquard [[shedding (loom)|shedding]] made possible the automatic production of unlimited varieties of pattern weaving. The term "Jacquard" is not specific or limited to any particular loom, but rather refers to the added control mechanism that automates the patterning. The process can also be used for patterned knitwear and machine-knitted textiles, such as [[jersey (fabric)|jersey]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parrillo Chapman|first=Lisa|title=Textile Design Engineering Within the Product Shape|year=2008|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=1109003986|pages=69–70|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QaHxO8qgZFYC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=jacquard+knitting&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1K8YUbyEJ4yo0AXOkoDgDg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=jacquard%20knitting&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This use of replaceable [[punched cards]] to control a sequence of operations is considered an important step in the [[history of computing hardware]].

==History==
[[File:Telaio Jacquard 1849.jpg|thumb|19th century Jacquard loom]]
In former times, if figured designs were required, this was done on a [[drawloom]]. The [[heddle]]s with warp ends to be pulled up were manually selected by a second operator (draw boy), apart from the weaver. It was slow and labour-intensive, with practical limitations on the complexity of the pattern.

The first important improvement of the draw loom took place in 1725, when [[Basile Bouchon]] introduced the principle of applying a perforated band of paper. A continuous roll of paper was punched by hand, in sections, each of which represented one lash or tread, and the length of the roll was determined by the number of shots in each repeat of pattern. The Jacquard machine subsequently evolved from this.

Joseph Marie Jacquard recognized that although weaving was intricate, it was repetitive, and saw that a [[mechanism (technology)|mechanism]] could be developed for the production of sophisticated patterns just as it had been done for the production of simple patterns.

It is difficult to determine what part of the 'Jacquard' machine was designed by Jacquard himself. He may have combined the best mechanical elements of other inventors, but - at any rate - the machine he made must have differed from its predecessors in arrangement and minor working details. It was similar in most general principles to [[Vaucanson]]'s arrangement, except that he made use of Jean-Baptiste Falcon's individual paste board cards and his square prism (or card 'cylinder'), which he is credited with having fully perforated on each of its four sides in lieu of [[Vaucanson]]'s perforated 'barrel'. Jacquard's machine also contained eight rows of needles and uprights as compared with [[Vaucanson]]'s double row, of which modifications enabled him to increase the figuring capacity of the machine. In his first machine, he supported the harness by knotted cords, which he elevated by a single trap board.

One of the chief advantages claimed for the Jacquard machine was that unlike previous damask-weaving machines, in which the figuring shed was usually drawn once for every four shots, with the new apparatus, it could be drawn on every shot, thus producing a fabric with greater definition of outline.&lt;ref&gt;Bradbury, Fred (1912). ''Jacquard Mechanisms and Harness Mounting''. John Heywood Ltd., Technical Book Depot, Halifax, Yorks.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacquard's invention had a deep influence on [[Charles Babbage]]. In that respect, he is viewed by some authors as a precursor of modern [[computing]] science.&lt;ref&gt;Essinger, James (2004). ''Jacquard's web''. Oxford University Press, Oxford. {{ISBN|978-0-19-280578-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles of operation==
[[File:Jacquard 2.jpg|thumb|Jacquard 2]]
On the diagram to the right, the cards are fastened into a continuous chain(1) which passes over a square box.  At each quarter rotation a new card is presented to the Jacquard head which represents one row.  The box swings from the right to the position shown and presses against the control rods(2).  Where there is a hole the rod passes through the card and is unmoved whereas if the hole is not punched the rod is pushed to the left.  Each rod acts upon a hook(3).  When the rod is pushed in the hook moves out of position to the left, a rod that is not pushed in leaves its hook in place.  A beam(4) then rises under the hooks and those hooks in the rest location are raised; the hooks that have been displaced are not moved by the beam.  Each hook can have multiple cords(5).  The cords pass through a guide(6) and are attached to their [[heddle]](7) and a return weight(8).  The heddles raise the [[Warp (weaving)|warp]] to create the [[shed (weaving)|shed]] through which the [[shuttle (weaving)|shuttle]] carrying the [[weft]] will pass.  A loom with a 400 hook head might have four threads connected to each hook, resulting in a fabric that is 1600 [[Warp (weaving)|warp]] ends wide with four repeats of the weave going across.

The term "Jacquard loom" is somewhat inaccurate.  It is the "Jacquard head" that adapts to a great many [[dobby loom]]s that allow the weaving machine to then create the intricate patterns often seen in [[Jacquard weaving]].

Jacquard looms, although relatively common in the textile industry, are not as ubiquitous as dobby looms which are usually faster and much cheaper to operate. However, unlike jacquard looms, they are not capable of producing so many different weaves from one [[Warp (weaving)|warp]].  Modern jacquard looms are controlled by computers in place of the original punched cards, and can have thousands of hooks.

The threading of a Jacquard loom is so labor-intensive that many looms are threaded only once. Subsequent [[Warp (weaving)|warp]]s are then tied into the existing warp with the help of a knotting robot which ties each new thread on individually.  Even for a small loom with only a few thousand [[Warp (weaving)|warp ends]] the process of re-threading can take days.

==Mechanical Jacquard looms==
[[File:Jacquard.loom.cards.jpg|right|thumb|Punched cards in use in a Jacquard loom.]]
[[File:Masson Mills WTM 10 Jacquard Card Cutter 5890.JPG|thumb|A punch for Jacquard cards]]
Originally the Jacquard machines were [[machine|mechanical]], and the fabric design was stored in a series of [[punched card]]s which were joined to form a continuous chain. The Jacquards often were small and only independently controlled a relatively few warp ends. This required a number of repeats across the loom width. Larger capacity machines, or the use of multiple machines, allowed greater control, with fewer repeats, and hence larger designs could be woven across the loom width.

A [[factory]] must choose looms and shedding mechanisms to suit its commercial requirements. As a rule the more warp control required the greater the expense. So it is not economical to purchase Jacquard machines if one can make do with a [[Dobby loom|dobby mechanism]]. As well as the capital expense, the Jacquard machines are more costly to maintain, as they are complex and require higher skilled personnel; an expensive design system is required to prepare the designs for the loom, and possibly a card-cutting machine. Weaving is more costly since Jacquard mechanisms are more likely to produce faults than dobby or cam shedding. Also, the looms will not run as quickly and down-time will increase because it takes time to change the continuous chain of cards when a design changes. For these reasons it is best to weave larger batches with mechanical Jacquards.

==Electronic Jacquard looms==
It is recorded that in 1855 a Frenchman &lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/irishlinentrade00smitgoog#page/n110/mode/2up/ The Irish Linen Trade Hand-Book and Directory]&lt;/ref&gt; adapted the Jacquard mechanism to a system by which it could be worked by electro-magnets. There was significant interest, however trials were not successful, and the development was soon lost in history.

Bonas Machine Company Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bonas.co.uk/ Bonas.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; launched the first successful electronic Jacquard at ITMA,&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.cematex.org/ Cematex.org]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Milan]] in 1983. Although the machines were initially small, modern technology has allowed Jacquard machine capacity to increase significantly, and single end warp control can extend to more than 10,000 warp ends. This avoids the need for repeats and symmetrical designs and allows almost infinite versatility. The computer-controlled machines significantly reduce the down time associated with changing punched paper designs, thus allowing smaller batch sizes. However, electronic Jacquards are costly and may not be required in a factory weaving large batch sizes, and smaller designs. The larger machines allowing single end warp control are very expensive, and can only be justified where great versatility is required, or very specialized design requirements need to be met. For example, they are an ideal tool to increase the ability and stretch the versatility of the niche linen Jacquard weavers who remain active in Europe and the West, while most of the large batch commodity weaving has moved to low cost areas.

[[Linen]] products associated with Jacquard weaving are linen damask napery, Jacquard apparel fabrics and damask bed linen.

Jacquard weaving of course uses all sorts of fibers and blends of fibers, and it is used in the production of fabrics for many end uses. Research is under way to develop layered and shaped items as reinforcing components for structures made from [[composite material]]s.

==Importance in computing==
The Jacquard head used replaceable [[punched cards]] to control a sequence of operations.  It is considered an important step in the [[history of computing hardware]].&lt;ref &gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ability to change the pattern of the loom's weave by simply changing cards was an important conceptual precursor to the development of [[computer programming]] and data entry. [[Charles Babbage]] knew of Jacquard looms and planned to use cards to store programs in his [[Analytical Engine]]. In the late 19th century, [[Herman Hollerith]] took the idea of using punched cards to store information a step further when he created a punched card tabulating machine which he used to input data for the [[1890 U.S. Census]]. A large data processing industry using punched-card technology, developed in the first half of the twentieth century{{mdash}}dominated initially by the [[International Business Machine]] corporation (IBM), with its line of [[unit record equipment]]. The cards were used for data, however, with programming done by [[plugboard]]s.

Some early computers, such as the 1944 [[IBM Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator]] (Harvard Mark I) received program instructions from a paper tape punched with holes, similar to Jacquard's string of cards. Later computers executed programs from higher-speed memory, though cards were commonly used to load the programs into memory. Punched cards remained in use in computing up until the mid 1980s.

'''Kashinhou''' (化審法), short for {{nihongo|化学物質の審査及び製造等の規制に関する法律|Kagaku Busshitsu no Shinsa Oyobi Seizoutou no Kisei ni Kansuru Houritsu}}, ("Law Concerning the Examination and Regulation of Manufacture, etc. of Chemical Substances") (Showa Act No. 117, 昭和48年法律第117号) is the current Chemicals and dangerous substances regulation law in Japan.  The more concise abbreviated name is {{nihongo|化学物質審査規制法|Kagaku Busshitsu Shinsa Kiseihou}}, or "Chemical Substances Control Law". This law featured the world's first new chemical pre-examination system.

== Coverage ==
This law was established to provide a framework to examine the import, manufacture, and use of industrial chemicals and refractory organic substances for persistence and health consequences, as well as the necessary legal restrictions in order to achieve those aims.

== History ==
The law has its origins in 1968, with an illness related to [[polychlorinated biphenyls]] poisoning in the [[Kanemi Oil Incident]]. In 1973, this law was established, radically overturning a prevailing attitude that long term contaminants bioaccumulating in humans was not problematic. Refractory organic substances, highly enriched uranium, and substances that possess long term toxicity to humans were classified as Section 1 Chemical Substances. Section 1 items were banned from manufacture or importation.

In 1986, a Section 2 Chemical Substances was added, which included [[trichloroethylene]] and [[tetrachloroethylene]], which had contaminated groundwater. Questionable chemical substances that did not fall into above categories were introduced into a Section 2 Questionable Chemical substances category.

In 1999, the government ministries were reorganized, and the [[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|Ministry of the Environment]] was added as an overseer to the precursor ministries of the current [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare]], [[Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry]].

In 2003, under pressure from the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]], a third Section was created to surveillance of chemical substances harmful to flora and fauna but not to humans.

Regulation, policing, and surveillance of other laws, namely the Poisonous and Deleterious Substance Control Law, Stimulant Control Law, and Narcotics and Psychotropics Control Law were transferred to the current ministries as mentioned above.

'''Kirklington Hall Research Station''' was a [[Exploration geophysics|geophysical]] research institute of [[BP]] in [[Kirklington, Nottinghamshire]].

==History==
As part of the [[East Midlands Oil Province]], oil was found in eastern Nottinghamshire. It was also known as the '''BP Research Centre''' or the Geophysical Centre, part of BP's Exploration Division. The research centre was established in 1950. Its first employee was [[Jack Birks]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1338608/Jack-Birks.html Jack Birks]&lt;/ref&gt; later Managing Director of BP. From 1950 it was the main research site of BP, until BP sold the site in 1957 for £12,000. Research moved to [[Sunbury-on-Thames]], in [[Surrey]], in 1957. Sunbury had been built around the same time as the Kirklington site, in the early 1950s.

Kirklington Hall today is a private school.

[[Image:Kirklington oil well - geograph.org.uk - 630844.jpg|file|thumb|200px|Oil well at Kirklington in April 2006, discovered by BP in 1985]]

==Structure==
The former site is situated north of the [[A617 road|A617]].

==Function==
It conducted [[Geophysics|geophysical]] research for [[Hydrocarbon exploration|exploration]] for BP. This part of BP is now known as [[BP Exploration]]. Work would be conducted on [[core sample]]s and with [[Reflection seismology|seismic methods]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21017">'''Land art''', variously known as '''Earth art''', '''environmental art''', and '''Earthworks''', is an [[art movement]] that emerged in the 1960s and 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/l/land-art Tate, Art Terms, Land Art]&lt;/ref&gt; largely associated with Great Britain and the United States,&lt;ref name="Kastner"&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=9rolepDS3dMC&amp;q=%22land+art%22&amp;dq=%22land+art%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtk6fb7tPUAhVJb1AKHVLMAswQ6AEIUDAJ Jeffrey Kastner, Brian Wallis: ''Land and Environmental Art''.

As a trend "Land art" expanded boundaries of art by the materials used and the siting of the works. The materials used were often the materials of the Earth including for instance the soil and rocks and vegetation and water found on-site, and the siting of the works were often distant from population centers. Though sometimes fairly inaccessible, photo documentation was commonly brought back to the urban art gallery.&lt;ref name="Dempsey" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mymodernmet.com/andy-goldsworthy-land-art/ http://mymodernmet.com] Unexpected Land Art Beautifully Formed in Nature.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="la"&gt;[http://www.land-arts.com/Land_art.html http://www.land-arts.com] Land art.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns of the art movement centered around rejection of the commercialization of art-making and enthusiasm with an emergent ecological movement. The art movement coincided with the popularity of the rejection of urban living and its counterpart, an enthusiasm for that which is rural. Included in these inclinations were spiritual yearnings concerning the planet [[Earth]] as home to mankind.&lt;ref&gt;ArtSpeak, A Guide to Contemporary Ideas, Movements, and Buzzwords, 1945 to the Present, By Robert Atkins, Abbeville Press, 2013, {{ISBN|978-0-78921-150-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Micucci"&gt;[http://www.artandantiquesmag.com/2012/04/land-art-earthworks-postwar-american-art/ Dana Micucci, ''Land Art: Earthworks that Defined Postwar American Art'', Art &amp; Antiques]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and 1970s land art protested "ruthless commercialization" of art in [[United States|America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Natural Art|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XAn5hztDTggC|publisher = PediaPress}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, exponents of land art rejected the [[museum]] or [[Art museum|gallery]] as the setting of artistic activity and developed monumental landscape projects which were beyond the reach of traditional transportable [[sculpture]] and the commercial art market, although photographic documentation was often presented in normal gallery spaces. Land art was inspired by [[Minimalism (visual arts)|minimal art]] and [[conceptual art]] but also by modern movements such as [[De Stijl]], [[Cubism]], [[minimalism]] and the work of [[Constantin Brâncuși]] and [[Joseph Beuys]]. Many of the artists associated with land art had been involved with minimal art and [[conceptual art]]. [[Isamu Noguchi]]'s 1941 design for ''Contoured Playground'' in New York is sometimes interpreted as an important early piece of land art even though the artist himself never called his work "land art" but simply "sculpture". His influence on contemporary land art, [[landscape architecture]] and [[environmental sculpture]] is evident in many works today.&lt;ref name="Weilacher"&gt;Udo Weilacher, ''Between Landscape Architecture and Land Art''. Birkhäuser, 1999, Basel Berlin Boston 1999 {{ISBN|3-7643-6119-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alan Sonfist]] used an alternative approach to working with [[nature]] and [[culture]] by bringing historical nature and [[sustainable art]] back into New York City. His most inspirational work is ''Time Landscape'', an indigenous forest he planted in New York City.&lt;ref name="Weilacher" /&gt; He also created several other ''Time Landscapes'' around the world such as ''Circles of Time'' in Florence Italy documenting the historical usage of the land, and recently at the deCordova Sculpture Park and Museum outside Boston. According to critic [[Barbara Rose]], writing in ''[[Artforum]]'' in 1969, he had become disillusioned with the commodification and insularity of gallery bound art. In 1967, the [[art critic]] Grace Glueck writing in the ''[[New York Times]]'' declared the first earthwork was done by Douglas Leichter and Richard Saba at the [[Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture]]. The sudden appearance of land art in 1968 can be located as a response by a generation of artists mostly in their late twenties to the heightened political activism of the year and the emerging [[Natural environment|environmental]] and [[women's liberation]] [[Social movement|movement]]s.

One example of land art in the 20th century was a group exhibition created in 1968 at the Dwan Gallery &lt;!--"Dwan" is not a typo--&gt; in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leftmatrix.com/earthworks.html|title=Leftmatrix|publisher=leftmatrix.com|accessdate=February 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1969, [[Willoughby Sharp]] curated the "Earth Art" exhibition at the [[Andrew Dickson White House|Andrew Dickson White Museum of Art]] at [[Cornell University]], Ithaca, New York. The artists included were [[Walter De Maria]], [[Jan Dibbets]], [[Hans Haacke]], [[Michael Heizer]], [[Neil Jenney]], [[Richard Long (artist)|Richard Long]], [[David Medalla]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Dennis Oppenheim]], [[Robert Smithson]], and [[Gunther Uecker]]. The exhibition was directed by Thomas W. Leavitt. Gordon Matta-Clark, who lived in Ithaca at the time, was invited by Sharp to help the artists in "Earth Art" with the on-site execution of their works for the exhibition.

Perhaps the best known artist who worked in this genre was the [[United States|American]] [[Robert Smithson]] whose 1968 essay "The Sedimentation of the Mind: Earth Projects" provided a critical framework for the movement as a reaction to the disengagement of [[Modernism]] from social issues as represented by the critic [[Clement Greenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=QTq8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA142&amp;dq=%22land+art%22,+%22Clement+Greenberg%22,+smithson&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjP-sP09dPUAhXFKFAKHdrfB9oQ6AEIJjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22land%20art%22%2C%20%22Clement%20Greenberg%22%2C%20smithson&amp;f=false Francis Frascina, ''Art, Politics and Dissent: Aspects of the Art Left in Sixties America''], Manchester University Press, 1999, p. 142, {{ISBN|0719044693}}&lt;/ref&gt; His best known piece, and probably the most famous piece of all land art, is the ''[[Spiral Jetty]]'' (1970), for which Smithson arranged rock, earth and [[algae]] so as to form a long (1500&amp;nbsp;ft) spiral-shape [[jetty]] protruding into [[Great Salt Lake]] in northern [[Utah]], [[United States|U.S.]]. How much of the work, if any, is visible is dependent on the fluctuating water levels. Since its creation, the work has been completely covered, and then uncovered again, by water.

Utah Museum of Fine Arts. umfa.utah.org. July&amp;nbsp;30, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Smithson's ''Gravel Mirror with Cracks and Dust'' (1968) is an example of land art existing in a [[art gallery|gallery]] space rather than in the natural environment. It consists of a pile of gravel by the side of a partially mirrored gallery wall. In its simplicity of form and concentration on the materials themselves, this and other pieces of land art have an affinity with [[minimalism]]. There is also a relationship to [[Arte Povera]] in the use of materials traditionally considered "unartistic" or "worthless". The Italian Germano Celant, founder of Arte Povera, was one of the first curator to promote Land Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://obsart.blogspot.fr/2012/05/conceptual-art-arte-povera-land-art-it.html|title=Observatoire du Land Art|publisher=obsart.blogspot.fr|accessdate=June 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'Land Artists' have tended to be American,&lt;ref name="Kastner" /&gt; with other prominent artists in this field including, [[Carl Andre]], [[Alice Aycock]], [[Walter De Maria]], [[Hans Haacke]], [[Michael Heizer]], [[Nancy Holt]], [[Ana Mendieta]], [[Dennis Oppenheim]], [[Andrew Rogers (sculptor)|Andrew Rogers]], [[Charles Ross (artist)|Charles Ross]], [[Alan Sonfist]], and [[James Turrell]]. Turrell began work in 1972 on possibly the largest piece of land art thus far, reshaping the earth surrounding the extinct [[Roden Crater]] [[volcano]] in [[Arizona]]. Perhaps the most prominent non-American land artists are the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Chris Drury (artist)|Chris Drury]], [[Andy Goldsworthy]], [[Richard Long (artist)|Richard Long]] and the Australian [[Andrew Rogers (sculptor)|Andrew Rogers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daringdesigns.com/earthworks.htm|title=Monumental Land Art of the United States|publisher=daringdesigns.com|accessdate=August 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1973 [[Jacek Tylicki]] begins to lay out blank canvases or paper sheets in the natural environment for the nature to create art.

Some projects by the artists [[Christo and Jeanne-Claude]] (who are famous for wrapping monuments, buildings and landscapes in [[textile|fabric]]) have also been considered land art by some, though the artists themselves consider this incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://christojeanneclaude.net/errors.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030208060629/http://christojeanneclaude.net/errors.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2003-02-08|title=Common Errors|authors=Christo and Jeanne-Claude|publisher=Christojeanneclaude.net|accessdate=2008-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Joseph Beuys]]' concept of '[[social sculpture]]' influenced 'Land art' and his '[[7000 Eichen]]' project of 1982 to plant 7000 Oak trees has many similarities to 'Land art' processes. [[Andrew Rogers (sculptor)|Rogers]]' “Rhythms of Life” project is the largest contemporary land-art undertaking in the world, forming a chain of stone sculptures, or geoglyphs, around the globe – 12 sites – in disparate exotic locations (from below sea level and up to altitudes of 4,300 m/14,107&amp;nbsp;ft). Up to three geoglyphs (ranging in size up to 40,000 sq m/430,560 sq ft) are located in each site.

Eduardo Sanguinetti, the Latino-American philosopher and land-artist, presented in 1979 his "Sculptures in Earth". They were placed in natural spaces, they became functional as plants and animals made their homes in that particular topos installed in the La Pampa desert. Later, they acquired the noise of codes capable of classifying smells and colours, and will complete the original idea of our artist, who was at that time absorbed by the countryside and its specular radiation...in his Land-Art Performance "Solum" (1987), in the zoomorphy of that horse that greatly seduce the audience of the [[Centro Cultural Recoleta]] (ex Centro Cultural Ciudad de Buenos Aires). "Amarillo Total" the name of the horse, not only stopped the ecologic blow but also paraded the models who had been completely painted by our artist, their naked painted bodies put another body to painting, with artesan colours prepared with earth and plants pigments.&lt;ref&gt;Espartaco Carlos 1989, "Eduardo Sanguinetti: The Experience of Limits" pp. 86, 87 (Ediciones de Arte Gaglianone, first published 1989) {{ISBN|950-9004-98-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Sanguinetti's Essay "Alter Ego" (1986), he said: "Spontaneous Activity in Nature...In nature, there is a type of spontaneous activity. This concept does not exist in cultured man, and if it does remain in children, it is like a faint reminiscence of the primitive mind...Consequently I think that the survival of an awareness of the supernatural in nature, should, in all works of Land-Art, be the thing which "animates Everything".&lt;ref&gt;Sanguinetti Eduardo 1984, "Alter Ego" pag. 53, 54 (Pentland, Edinburgh, First Published in 1986 in the English languaje translated from the Spanish in 1986) {{ISBN|9780946270170}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=prTwAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=eduardo+sanguinetti&amp;dq=eduardo+sanguinetti&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5FbBUNXSI-610AGY44DoCQ&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAw |title=Alter ego - Eduardo Sanguinetti - Google Libros |publisher=Books.google.com.ar |date=2011-11-29 |accessdate=2013-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Land artists in America relied mostly on wealthy [[patron]]s and [[private foundation]]s to fund their often costly projects. With the sudden economic down turn of the mid-1970s funds from these sources largely stopped. With the death of Robert Smithson in a plane crash in 1973 the movement lost one of its most important figureheads and faded out. Charles Ross continues to work on the Star Axis project, which he began in 1971. Michael Heizer continues his work on [[City (artwork)|City]], and James Turrell continues to work on the [[Roden Crater]] project. In most respects, "land art" has become part of mainstream [[public art]] and in many cases the term "land art" is misused to label any kind of art in nature even though conceptually not related to the [[avant-garde]] works by the pioneers of land art.

The Earth art of the 1960s were sometimes reminiscent the much older land works, [[Stonehenge]], the [[Pyramids]], [[Mound Builders|Native American mounds]], the [[Nazca Lines|Nazca Lines in Peru]], [[Carnac stones]] and [[List of burial mounds in the United States|Native American burial grounds]], and often evoked the spirituality of such archeological sites.&lt;ref name="Micucci" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dempsey" /&gt;

'''Light poetry''' or '''light verse''' is [[poetry]] that attempts to be humorous.  Light poems are usually brief, can be on a frivolous or serious subject, and often feature [[word play]] including [[pun]]s, adventurous rhyme, and heavy [[alliteration]]. Typically, light verse in English is formal verse, although a few [[free verse]] poets have excelled at light verse outside the formal verse tradition.

While light poetry is sometimes condemned as [[doggerel]] or thought of as poetry composed casually, humor often makes a serious point in a subtle or subversive way. Many of the most renowned "serious" poets, such as Horace, Swift, Pope, and Auden, also excelled at light verse.

The '''lion''' (''Panthera leo'') is a [[species]] in the family [[Felidae]]; it is a muscular, deep-chested cat with a short, rounded head, a reduced neck and round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. The lion is [[sexually dimorphic]]; males are larger than females with a typical weight range of {{convert|150|to|250|kg|lb|abbr=on}} for the former and {{convert|120|to|182|kg|lb|abbr=on|round=5}} for the latter. Male lions have a prominent mane, which is the most recognisable feature of the species. A lion pride consists of a few adult males, related females and cubs. Groups of female lions typically hunt together, preying mostly on large [[ungulate]]s. The species is an [[apex predator|apex]] and [[keystone predator]], although they scavenge when opportunities occur. Some lions have been known to hunt humans, although the species typically does not.

Typically, the lion inhabits [[grassland]]s and [[savanna]]s but is absent in dense [[forest]]s. It is usually more [[diurnality|diurnal]] than other big cats, but when persecuted it adapts to being active [[nocturnality|at night]] and [[crepuscular|at twilight]]. In the [[Pleistocene]], the lion ranged throughout Eurasia, Africa and the Americas from the [[Yukon]] to Peru but today it has been reduced to fragmented populations in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] and one critically endangered population in western India. It has been listed as [[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]] on the [[IUCN Red List]] since 1996 because populations in African countries have declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, [[habitat loss]] and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern.

One of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture, the lion has been extensively depicted in sculptures and paintings, on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature. Lions have been kept in [[menagerie]]s since the time of the [[Roman Empire]] and have been a key species sought for exhibition in [[zoological garden]]s across the world since the late 18th century. [[Cultural depictions of lions]] were prominent in the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period; carvings and paintings from the [[Lascaux]] and [[Chauvet Cave]]s in France have been dated to 17,000 years ago, and depictions have occurred in virtually all ancient and medieval cultures that coincided with the lion's former and current ranges.

==Etymology==
The lion's name, which is similar in many [[Romance languages]], is derived from ''{{lang-la|leo}}''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Simpson |first=D.

Hybrids are still bred in private menageries and in zoos in China.{{ch|date=July 2018}}

The liger is a cross between a male lion and a tigress.&lt;ref name=Carnivores/&gt; Because the growth-inhibiting gene from the tiger mother is absent, the growth-promoting gene passed on by the lion father is unimpeded by a regulating gene and the resulting liger grows far larger than either parent. The liger inherits the physical and behavioural qualities of both parent species; for example, its coat has both spots and stripes on a sandy background. Male ligers are sterile but females often are fertile. Males have about a 50% chance of having a mane, which will be around 50% the size of a pure-bred lion mane. Ligers are much bigger than normal lions and tigers; they are typically {{convert|3.65|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length, and can weigh up to {{convert|500|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Carnivores/&gt;&lt;ref name=shi/&gt;

The less-common tiglon or tigon is a cross between a lioness and a male tiger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/595552/tigon|title= Tigon—Encyclopædia Britannica Article|accessdate=25 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to ligers, tigons are often relatively small in comparison with their parents because of reciprocal gene effects.&lt;ref name=shi/&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Lion Panthera leo in Tanzania 3160 Nevit.jpg|thumb|right|Profile of lioness in Tanzania]]

The lion is a muscular, deep-chested cat with a short, rounded head, a reduced neck and round ears. Its fur varies in colour from light buff to silvery grey, yellowish red and dark brown.&lt;ref name=Haas2005&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Haas, S. K. |author2=Hayssen, V. |author3=Krausman, P.

When they are born, have dark [[Rosette (zoology)|spots]] on their bodies; these spots fade as the cubs reach adulthood, although faint spots often may still be seen on the legs and underparts. The lion is the only member of the cat family that displays obvious [[sexual dimorphism]]. Males are more robust than females; they have broader heads and a prominent mane that grows downwards and backwards to cover most of the head, neck, shoulders, and chest. The mane is typically brownish and tinged with yellow, rust and black hairs. The tail ends in a dark, hairy tuft that in some lions conceals an approximately {{convert|5|mm|in|abbr=on|adj=on}}-long, hard "spine" or "spur" that is formed from the final, fused sections of tail bone. The functions of the spur are unknown. The tuft is absent at birth and develops at around {{frac|5|1|2}}&amp;nbsp;months of age and is readily identifiable by the age of seven months.&lt;ref name="Schaller28"&gt;[[#Schaller|Schaller]], pp. 28−30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the living felid species, the lion is rivaled only by the tiger in length, weight and height at the shoulder.&lt;ref name="Mitra2005"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mitra |first1=S. |title=Gir Forest and the saga of the Asiatic lion |year=2005 |publisher=Indus |location=New Delhi |url=https://books.google.com/?id=J0rME6RjC1sC&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;pg=PP1 |isbn=978-8173871832}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its skull is very similar to that of the tiger, although the frontal region is usually more depressed and flattened, and has a slightly shorter [[postorbital]] region and broader nasal openings than those of the tiger. Due to the amount of skull variation in the two species, usually only the structure of the lower jaw can be used as a reliable indicator of species.&lt;ref name=Carnivores/&gt;&lt;ref name=shi/&gt;&lt;ref name="USSR"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Heptner |first=V.

The lion's mane is the most recognisable feature of the species.&lt;ref name=Hemmer&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hemmer, H. |year=1974 |title=Untersuchungen zur Stammesgeschichte der Pantherkatzen (''Pantherinae'') Teil 3.

Mane colour varies and darkens with age; research shows its colour and size are influenced by environmental factors such as average ambient temperature. Mane length apparently signals fighting success in male–male relationships; darker-maned individuals may have longer reproductive lives and higher offspring survival, although they suffer in the hottest months of the year. The presence, absence, colour and size of the mane are associated with genetic precondition, sexual maturity, climate and [[testosterone]] production; the rule of thumb is that a darker, fuller mane indicates a healthier animal.

[[File:White Lion.jpg|thumb|left|[[White lion]]s owe their colouring to a recessive allele]]

The white lion is a rare [[Polymorphism (biology)|morph]] with a genetic condition called [[leucism]] that is caused by a double [[recessive allele]]. It is not albino; it has normal pigmentation in the eyes and skin. White lions have occasionally been encountered in and around [[Kruger National Park]] and the adjacent [[Timbavati Private Game Reserve]] in eastern South Africa. They were removed from the wild in the 1970s, thus decreasing the white lion [[gene pool]]. Nevertheless, 17 births have been recorded in five prides between 2007 and 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Turner|first1=J. A.|last2= Vasicek|first2= C. A. |last3= Somers|first3= M.

==Behaviour and ecology==
[[File:Panthera leo stretching (Etosha, 2012).jpg|thumb|left|Adult male lion stretching in [[Etosha National Park]], Namibia]]

Lions spend much of their time resting; they are inactive for about 20&amp;nbsp;hours per day.&lt;ref name="Schaller122"&gt;[[#Schaller|Schaller]], p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; Although lions can be active at any time, their activity generally peaks after dusk with a period of socialising, grooming and defecating. Intermittent bursts of activity continue until dawn, when hunting most often takes place. They spend an average of two hours a day walking and 50&amp;nbsp;minutes eating.&lt;ref name="Schaller120"&gt;[[#Schaller|Schaller]], pp. 120–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The lion is the most social of all wild cat species, living in groups of related individuals with their offspring. Such a group is called a "[[List of animal names#L|pride]]". Groups of male lions are called "coalitions".&lt;ref name="Schaller33"&gt;[[#Schaller|Schaller]], p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Females form the stable [[social unit]] in a pride and do not tolerate outside females.&lt;ref name="Schaller37"&gt;[[#Schaller|Schaller]], p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Membership only changes with the births and deaths of lionesses,&lt;ref name="Schaller39"&gt;[[#Schaller|Schaller]], p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; although some females leave and become nomadic.&lt;ref name="Schaller44"&gt;[[#Schaller|Schaller]], p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; The average pride consists of around 15 lions, including several adult females and up to four males and their cubs of both sexes. Large prides, consisting of up to 30 individuals, have been observed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Schaller|Schaller]], p. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt; The sole exception to this pattern is the [[Tsavo lion]] pride that always has just one adult male.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Milius |first=S. |date=2002 |title= Biology: Maneless lions live one guy per pride|journal=Society for Science &amp; the Public |volume=161 |issue=16 |page=253 |doi=10.1002/scin.5591611614}}&lt;/ref&gt; Male cubs are excluded from their maternal pride when they reach maturity at around two or three years of age.&lt;ref name="Schaller44"/&gt;

Some lions are "nomads" that range widely and move around sporadically, either in pairs or alone.&lt;ref name="Schaller33"/&gt; Pairs are more frequent among related males who have been excluded from their birth pride. A lion may switch lifestyles; nomads can become residents and vice versa.&lt;ref name=Estes&gt;{{cite book|author=Estes, R.|title=The behavior guide to African mammals: including hoofed mammals, carnivores, primates|pages=369–76|year=1991|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-08085-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interactions between prides and nomads tend to be hostile, although pride females in [[estrus]] allow nomadic males to approach them.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Schaller|Schaller]], pp. 52–54.&lt;/ref&gt; Males spend years in a nomadic phase before gaining residence in a pride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hanby, J.

Females lions stay closer to their natal pride. Therefore, female lions in an area are more closely related to each other than male lions in the same area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=van Hooft, P., Keet, D.F., Brebner, D.K. and Bastos, A.D. |year=2018 |title=Genetic insights into dispersal distance and disperser fitness of African lions (''Panthera leo'') from the latitudinal extremes of the Kruger National Park, South Africa |journal=BMC Genetics |volume=19 |issue=1 |page=21 |doi=10.1186/s12863-018-0607-x|pmid=29614950 |pmc=5883395 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area occupied by a pride is called a "pride area" whereas that occupied by a nomad is a "range".&lt;ref name="Schaller33"/&gt; Males associated with a pride tend to stay on the fringes, patrolling their [[territory (animal)|territory]]. The reasons for the development of [[social behavior|sociality]] in lionesses – the most pronounced in any cat species – are the subject of much debate. Increased hunting success appears to be an obvious reason, but this is uncertain upon examination; coordinated hunting allows for more successful predation but also ensures non-hunting members reduce ''per capita'' calorific intake. Some females, however, take a role raising cubs that may be left alone for extended periods. Members of the pride tend to regularly play the same role in hunts and hone their skills. The health of the hunters is the primary need for the survival of the pride; hunters are the first to consume the prey at the site it is taken. Other benefits include possible [[kin selection]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;#32;it is preferable to share food with a related lion than with a stranger&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;#32;protection of the young, maintenance of territory and individual insurance against injury and hunger.&lt;ref name=CAP&gt;{{Cite book |last=Nowell |first=K. |last2=Jackson |first2=P. |title=Wild Cats: Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan|url=http://carnivoractionplans1.free.fr/wildcats.pdf |year=1996 |publisher=IUCN/SSC Cat Specialist Group |location=Gland, Switzerland |isbn=978-2-8317-0045-8 |pages=17–21, 37–41 |chapter=''Panthera leo''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asiatic lion prides differ from African prides in group composition. Male Asiatic lions are solitary or associate with up to three males, forming a loose pride. Pairs of males rest and feed together, and display [[Territorial behavior|marking behaviour]] at the same sites. Females associate with up to 12 other females, forming a stronger pride together with their cubs. They share large carcasses with each other but seldom share food with males. Female and male lions associate only when mating.&lt;ref name=Joslin1973&gt;{{cite book |author=Joslin, P. |year=1973 |title=The Asiatic lion: a study of ecology and behaviour |location=University of Edinburgh, UK |publisher=Department of Forestry and Natural Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coalitions of males hold territory for a longer time than single lions.

Lions and spotted hyenas occupy a similar ecological niche and where they coexist they compete for prey and carrion; a review of data across several studies indicates a dietary overlap of 58.6%.&lt;ref name="prey"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.zbs.bialowieza.pl/g2/pdf/1598.pdf |title=Prey preferences of the spotted hyaena (''Crocuta crocuta'') and degree of dietary overlap with the lion (''Panthera leo'') |last=Hayward |first=M.

She will often hunt alone while the cubs are still helpless, staying relatively close to the den.&lt;ref name="Scott45"&gt;[[#Scott|Scott]], p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Lion cubs are born blind – their eyes open around seven days after birth. They weigh {{convert|1.2|–|2.1|kg|lb|abbr=on}} at birth and are almost helpless, beginning to crawl a day or two after birth and walking around three weeks of age.&lt;ref name="Schaller143"&gt;[[#Schaller|Schaller]], p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid a buildup of scent attracting the attention of predators, the lioness moves her cubs to a new den site several times a month, carrying them one-by-one by the nape of the neck.&lt;ref name="Scott45"/&gt;

Usually, the mother does not integrate herself and her cubs back into the pride until the cubs are six to eight weeks old.&lt;ref name="Scott45"/&gt; Sometimes this introduction to pride life occurs earlier, particularly if other lionesses have given birth at about the same time. Pride lionesses often synchronise their reproductive cycles and communal rearing and suckling of the young, which suckle indiscriminately from any or all of the nursing females in the pride. The synchronization of births is advantageous because the cubs grow to being roughly the same size and have an equal chance of survival, and sucklings are not dominated by older cubs.&lt;ref name=Estes/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schaller148&gt;[[#Schaller|Schaller]], p. 147-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

When first introduced to the rest of the pride, lion cubs lack confidence when confronted with adults other than their mother. They soon begin to immerse themselves in the pride life, however, playing among themselves or attempting to initiate play with the adults.&lt;ref name=Schaller148/&gt; Lionesses with cubs of their own are more likely to be tolerant of another lioness's cubs than lionesses without cubs. Male tolerance of the cubs varies – sometimes a male will patiently let the cubs play with his tail or his mane, whereas another may snarl and bat the cubs away.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Scott|Scott]], p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lion Cubs Phinda 2011.ogv|thumb|right|Video of a lioness and her cubs in [[Phinda Private Game Reserve]], South Africa]]
Weaning occurs after six or seven months. Male lions reach maturity at about three years of age and at four to five years are capable of challenging and displacing adult males associated with another pride. They begin to age and weaken at between 10 and 15 years of age at the latest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Crandall |first=Lee S. |title=The management of wild animals in captivity |year=1964 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |oclc=557916}}&lt;/ref&gt; When one or more new males oust the previous males associated with a pride, the victors often [[infanticide (zoology)|kill any existing young cubs]], perhaps because females do not become fertile and receptive until their cubs mature or die.

Both male and female lions may be ousted from prides to become nomads, although most females usually remain with their birth pride. When a pride becomes too large, however, the youngest generation of female cubs may be forced to leave to find their own territory. When a new male lion takes over a pride, adolescent lions&amp;nbsp;–&amp;#32;both male and female&amp;nbsp;–&amp;#32;may be evicted.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Scott|Scott]], p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lions of both sexes may interact [[homosexuality in animals|homosexually]]. Lions are shown to be involved in group homosexual and courtship activities; males will also head-rub and roll around with each other before simulating sex together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bagemihl |first=Bruce |year=1999 |title=Biological Exuberance: Animal Homosexuality and Natural Diversity |location=New York |publisher=St. Martin's Press |isbn=978-0-312-19239-6| pages=302–05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Schaller|Schaller]], p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
Although adult lions have no natural predators, evidence suggests most die violently from attacks by humans or other lions.&lt;ref name="Schaller183"&gt;[[#Schaller|Schaller]], p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; Lions often inflict serious injuries on members of other prides they encounter in territorial disputes or members of the home pride when fighting at a kill.&lt;ref name="Schaller1889"&gt;[[#Schaller|Schaller]], pp. 188–89.&lt;/ref&gt; Crippled lions and cubs may fall victim to hyenas and leopards or be trampled by buffalo or elephants.

===Communication===
[[File:Lion cub with mother.jpg|thumb|right|Head rubbing and licking are common social behaviours within a pride]]

When resting, lion socialisation occurs through a number of behaviours; the animal's expressive movements are highly developed. The most common peaceful, tactile gestures are head rubbing and [[social licking]],&lt;ref name="Schaller85"&gt;[[#Schaller|Schaller]], p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; which have been compared with grooming in primates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor=Desmond Morris|last=Sparks |first=J |title=Primate Ethology |chapter=Allogrooming in primates:a review |year=1967 |publisher=Aldine |location=Chicago |isbn=978-0-297-74828-1}} (2007 edition: 0-202-30826-X)&lt;/ref&gt; Head rubbing – the nuzzling of the forehead, face and neck against another lion – appears to be a form of greeting&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Leyhausen |first=Paul |title=Verhaltensstudien an Katzen|edition= 2nd |year=1960 |publisher=Paul Parey |location=Berlin |isbn=978-3-489-71836-9 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is seen often after an animal has been apart from others or after a fight or confrontation. Males tend to rub other males, while cubs and females rub females.&lt;ref name="Schaller858"&gt;[[#Schaller|Schaller]], pp. 85–88.&lt;/ref&gt; Social licking often occurs in tandem with head rubbing; it is generally mutual and the recipient appears to express pleasure. The head and neck are the most common parts of the body licked; this behaviour may have arisen out of utility because lions cannot lick these areas themselves.&lt;ref name="Schaller8891"&gt;[[#Schaller|Schaller]], pp. 88–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{sound|filename=Lion raring-sound1TamilNadu178.ogg|title=Lion roar|description=A captive lion in India roaring}}
Lions have an array of facial expressions and body postures that serve as visual gestures.&lt;ref name="Schaller92102"&gt;[[#Schaller|Schaller]], pp. 103–117.&lt;/ref&gt; A common facial expression is the "grimace face" or [[flehmen response]], which a lion makes when sniffing chemical signals and involves an open mouth with bared teeth, raised muzzle, wrinkled nose closed eyes and relaxed ears.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Schaller|Schaller]], p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; Lions also use chemical and visual marking; males will [[Territory (animal)#Scent marking|spray]] and scrape plots of ground and objects within the territory.&lt;ref name="Schaller92102"/&gt;

The repertoire of vocalisations is also large; rather than discrete signals, variations in intensity and pitch appear to be central to communication. Most lion vocalisations are variations of growling, snarling, miaowing and roaring. Other sounds produced include purring, puffing, bleating and humming.&lt;ref name="Schaller10313"/&gt; Lions tend to [[Roar (vocalization)|roar]] in a very characteristic manner starting with a few deep, long roars that subside into a series of shorter ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://roberteklund.info/pdf/Ananthakrishnan_et_al_2011_LionRoars.pdf |title=An acoustic analysis of lion roars.

In [[Eurasia]], the lion once ranged from Greece to India; [[Herodotus]] reported that lions had been common in Greece in 480 BC; they attacked the baggage camels of the Persian king [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]] on his march through the country. [[Aristotle]] considered them rare by 300 BC, and by 100 AD, they had been extirpated.&lt;ref name="Schaller5"/&gt; Until the 10th century, lions survived in the [[Caucasus]], their last European outpost.&lt;ref name="USSR"/&gt; The species was eradicated in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] by the [[Middle Ages]], and from most of the rest of Asia after the arrival of readily available firearms in the 18th century.

Most lions now live in East and Southern Africa; their numbers are rapidly decreasing, and fell by an estimated 30–50% each 20 years in the late half of the 20th century. The species is listed as [[vulnerable species|Vulnerable]] on the [[IUCN Red List]].&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt; In 1975, it was estimated that since the 1950s, lion numbers decreased by half to 200,000 or fewer.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, N.

Zambia's [[Kafue National Park]] is a key refuge for lions where frequent, uncontrolled bushfires combined with hunting of lions and prey species limits the ability of the lion population to recover.

The West African lion population is isolated from the one in Central Africa, with little or no exchange of breeding individuals. In 2015, it was estimated that this population consists of about 400 animals, including fewer than 250 mature individuals. They persist in three protected areas in the region, mostly in one population in the [[W National Park|W]][[Arli National Park|A]][[Pendjari National Park|P]] protected area complex, shared by [[Benin]], [[Burkina Faso]] and [[Niger]]. This population is listed as [[Critically Endangered]].&lt;ref name=Henschel2015/&gt; Field surveys in the [[W-Arly-Pendjari Complex|WAP ecosystem]] revealed that lion occupancy is lowest in the W National Park, and higher in areas with permanent staff and thus better protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Henschel |first1=P. |last2=Petracca |first2=L.

In [[Gabon]]'s [[Batéké Plateau National Park]], a single male lion was repeatedly recorded by camera-traps between January 2015 and September 2017. Five hair samples from this lion were collected and compared with samples from museum specimens that had been shot in the area in 1959. Genetic analysis showed the Batéké lion is closely related to lions killed in this region in the past. The samples grouped it with lion samples from Namibia and Botswana, raising the possibility that the Batéké lion either dispersed from a Southern African lion population or is a survivor of the ancestral Batéké population that was considered to be extinct since the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="Barnett_al2018_Origin"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barnett|first1= R. |last2=Sinding |first2= M.

Lions are included in the [[Species Survival Plan]], a coordinated attempt by the [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums]] to increase its chances of survival. The plan was started in 1982 for the Asiatic lion, but was suspended when it was found that most Asiatic lions in North American zoos were not [[genetic pollution|genetically pure]], having been hybridised with African lions. The African lion plan started in 1993, and focused on the South African population, although there are difficulties in assessing the genetic diversity of captive lions because most individuals are of unknown origin, making the maintenance of genetic diversity a problem.&lt;ref name="zoos_encyclopedia"/&gt; Breeding programs need to note origins to avoid breeding different subspecies and thus reducing their conservation value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url= https://books.google.com/?id=vLZKnsCk89wC&amp;pg=PA437|accessdate=12 September 2010| last1= Frankham |first1= Richard |last2= Ballou |first2= Jonathan |last3= Briscoe |first3= David |title= Introduction to Conservation Genetics |page=437|publisher=Cambridge University Press| year= 2009| isbn= 978-0-521-70271-3| location= Cambridge, England}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several Asiatic-African lion crosses, however, have been bred.&lt;ref name="AviseHamrick1996"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Avise|first1=J.

Lions are part of a group of exotic animals that have been central to zoo exhibits since the late 18th century; members of this group are invariably large vertebrates and include elephants, rhinoceroses, hippopotamuses, large primates and other big cats; zoos sought to gather as many of these species as possible.&lt;ref name="dc81"&gt;[[#Courcy|de Courcy]], p. 81-82.&lt;/ref&gt; Although many modern zoos are more selective about their exhibits,&lt;ref name="dc81"/&gt; there are more than 1,000 African and 100 Asiatic lions in zoos and wildlife parks around the world.

At the ancient Egyptian cities of [[Taremu]] and [[Per-Bast]] were temples dedicated to the lion goddesses of Egypt, [[Sekhmet]] and [[Bast (goddess)|Bast]], and at Taremu there was a temple dedicated to the son of the deity [[Maahes]] the lion prince, where lions were kept and allowed to roam within the temple. The Greeks called the city ''[[Leontopolis]]'' ("City of Lions") and documented that practice.
Lions were kept and bred by [[Assyria]]n kings as early as 850 BC,&lt;ref name="Schaller5"/&gt; and [[Alexander the Great]] was said to have been presented with tame lions by the [[Malhi]] of northern India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Smith |first=Vincent Arthur|title= The Early History of India|year=1924|page=97|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ancient Rome]], lions were kept by emperors to take part in the gladiator arenas or were used for executions (see [[bestiarii]], [[damnatio ad bestias]], and [[venatio]]).

The first European "zoos" spread among noble and royal families in the 13th century, and until the 17th century were called [[seraglio]]s; at that time they came to be called [[menagerie]]s, an extension of the [[cabinet of curiosities]]. They spread from France and Italy during the [[Renaissance]] to the rest of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baratay|Baratay &amp; Hardouin-Fugier]], pp. 19–21, 42.&lt;/ref&gt; In England, although the seraglio tradition was less developed, lions were [[Tower of London#Menagerie|kept at the Tower of London]] in a seraglio established by [[John of England|King John]] in the 13th century;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baratay|Baratay &amp; Hardouin-Fugier]], p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Owen|first=James|title=Medieval Lion Skulls Reveal Secrets of Tower of London "Zoo"|work=National Geographic Magazine|publisher=National Geographic|date=3 November 2005|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/11/1103_051103_tower_lions.html| accessdate=5 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; this was probably stocked with animals from an earlier menagerie started in 1125 by [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] at his hunting lodge in [[Woodstock, Oxfordshire]], where according to [[William of Malmesbury]] lions had been stocked.&lt;ref name="Blunt15"&gt;[[#Blunt|Blunt]], p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seraglios served as expressions of the nobility's power and wealth; animals&amp;nbsp;–&amp;#32;particularly big cats and elephants&amp;nbsp;–&amp;#32;symbolised power and were pitted against each other or domesticated animals in fights. By extension, menageries and seraglios served as demonstrations of the dominance of humanity over nature; the defeat of such natural "lords" by a cow in 1682 astonished spectators and the flight of an elephant before a rhinoceros drew jeers. The frequency of such fights slowly declined in the 17th century with the spread of menageries and their appropriation by commoners. The tradition of keeping big cats as pets lasted into the 19th century, at which time it was seen as highly eccentric.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baratay|Baratay &amp; Hardouin-Fugier]], pp. 24–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of lions at the Tower of London was intermittent, being restocked when a monarch or his consort, such as [[Margaret of Anjou]] the wife of [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]], either sought or were given animals. Records indicate animals in the Tower of London were kept in poor conditions in the 17th century, in contrast to more open conditions in [[Florence]] at the time.&lt;ref name="Blunt16"&gt;[[#Blunt|Blunt]], p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The menagerie was open to the public by the 18th century; admission was a sum of three half-pence or the supply of a cat or dog for feeding to the lions.&lt;ref name="Blunt17"&gt;[[#Blunt|Blunt]], p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; A rival menagerie at the [[Exeter Exchange]] also exhibited lions until the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Courcy|de Courcy]], pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; The Tower menagerie was closed by [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]],&lt;ref name="Blunt17"/&gt; and the animals were transferred to [[London Zoo]], which opened to the public on 27 April 1828.&lt;ref name="Blunt32"&gt;[[#Blunt|Blunt]], p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lion - melbourne zoo.jpg|thumb|Lion at [[Melbourne Zoo]] enjoying an elevated grassy area with some tree shelter]]
The trade in wild animals flourished alongside improved colonial trade of the 19th century; lions were considered fairly common and inexpensive. Although they would barter higher than tigers, they were less costly than larger or more difficult-to-transport animals such as the giraffe and hippopotamus, and much less than [[giant panda]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baratay|Baratay &amp; Hardouin-Fugier]], p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; Like other animals, lions were seen as little more than a natural, boundless commodity that was mercilessly exploited with terrible losses in capture and transportation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baratay|Baratay &amp; Hardouin-Fugier]], pp. 114, 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lions were kept in cramped and squalid conditions at London Zoo until a larger lion house with roomier cages was built in the 1870s.&lt;ref name="Blunt208"&gt;[[#Blunt|Blunt]], p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; Further changes took place in the early 20th century when [[Carl Hagenbeck]] designed enclosures with concrete "rocks", more open space and a moat instead of bars, more closely resembling a natural habitat. Hagenbeck designed lion enclosures for both [[Melbourne Zoo]] and Sydney's [[Taronga Zoo]]; although his designs were popular, the use of bars and caged enclosures prevailed in many zoos until the 1960s.&lt;ref name="dc69"&gt;[[#Courcy|de Courcy]], p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 20th century, larger, more natural enclosures and the use of wire mesh or laminated glass instead of lowered dens allowed visitors to come closer than ever to the animals; some attractions such as the Cat Forest/Lion Overlook of [[Oklahoma City Zoo and Botanical Garden|Oklahoma City Zoological Park]] placed the den on ground level, higher than visitors.&lt;ref name="zoos_encyclopedia"/&gt;

===Hunting, baiting and taming===

Lion hunting has occurred since ancient times and was often a royal pastime. The earliest surviving record of lion hunting is an [[ancient Egypt]]ian inscription dated circa 1380 BC that mentions Pharaoh [[Amenhotep III]] killing 102 lions "with his own arrows" during the first ten years of his rule. The [[Assyria]]ns would release captive lions in a reserved space for the king to hunt; this event would be watched by spectators as the king and his men, on horseback or chariots, killed the lions with arrows and spears. Lions were also hunted during the [[Mughal Empire]], where Emperor [[Jahangir]] is said to have excelled at it. Royal hunting of lions was intended to demonstrate the power of the king over nature.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 156–159.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Maasai people]] have traditionally viewed the killing of lions as a rite of passage. Historically, lions were hunted by individuals, however, due to reduced lion populations, elders discourage solo lion hunts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hazzah |first1=L. |last2=Borgerhoof Mulder |first2=M. |last3=Frank |first3=L. |year=2009 |title=Lions and warriors: Social factors underlying declining African lion populations and the effect of incentive-based management in Kenya |url= |journal=Biological Conservation |volume=142 |issue= |pages=2428–2437 |doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2009.06/006|doi-broken-date=2018-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the European colonisation of Africa in the 19th century, the hunting of lions was encouraged because they were considered as vermin and lion hides fetched [[Pound sterling|£1]] each.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; The widely reproduced imagery of the heroic hunter chasing lions would dominate a large part of the century.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baratay|Baratay &amp; Hardouin-Fugier]], p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Explorers and hunters exploited a popular [[Manichaeism|Manichean]] division of animals into "good" and "evil" to add thrilling value to their adventures, casting themselves as heroic figures. This resulted in big cats being always suspected of being man-eaters, representing "both the fear of nature and the satisfaction of having overcome it".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baratay|Baratay &amp; Hardouin-Fugier]], pp. 173, 180–83.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Trophy hunting]] of lions in recent years has been met with controversy; the [[killing of Cecil the lion]] in mid-2015 by an American tourist created a significant international backlash against the hunter and of the practice of hunting lions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Capecchi |first1=Christina |last2=Rogers |first2=Katie |title=Killer of Cecil the lion finds out that he is a target now, of internet vigilantism |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=30 July 2015 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/30/us/cecil-the-lion-walter-palmer.html |accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lion-baiting is a [[blood sport]] involving the [[animal-baiting|baiting]] of lions in combat with other animals, usually dogs. Records of it exist in ancient times through until the seventeenth century. It was finally banned in [[Vienna]] by 1800 and England in 1835.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hone |first= William |editor= Kyle Grimes|title= The Every-Day Book |origyear=1825–1826 |url=http://www.uab.edu/english/hone/etexts/edb/day-pages/207-july26.html |accessdate=25 January 2011|year=2004 |publisher=University of Alabama at Birmingham |page=26 |chapter=July |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080624080642/http://www.uab.edu/english/hone/etexts/edb/day-pages/207-july26.html |archivedate= 24 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Blaisdell |first=Warren H. |date=November 1997 |title= How A Lion Fight Caused England To Stop The Breeding of Both Ring And Pit Bulldogs|journal=American Bulldog Review |volume=3 |issue=4 |url=http://www.american-bulldog.com/how_a_lion.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424001716/http://www.american-bulldog.com/how_a_lion.htm |archivedate=24 April 2008 |accessdate=5 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lion taming refers to the practice of taming lions for entertainment, either as part of an established [[circus]] or as an individual act such as [[Siegfried &amp; Roy]]. The term is also often used for the taming and display of other big cats such as tigers, leopards and [[cougar]]s. The practice began in the early 19th century by Frenchman Henri Martin and American [[Isaac A. Van Amburgh|Isaac Van Amburgh]], who both toured widely and whose techniques were copied by a number of followers.&lt;ref name = "baratay187"/&gt; Van Amburgh performed before [[Queen Victoria]] in 1838 when he toured Great Britain. Martin composed a [[pantomime]] titled ''Les Lions de Mysore'' ("the lions of Mysore"), an idea that Amburgh quickly borrowed. These acts eclipsed [[equestrianism]] acts as the central display of circus shows and entered public consciousness in the early 20th century with cinema. In demonstrating the superiority of human over animal, lion taming served a purpose similar to animal fights of previous centuries.&lt;ref name="baratay187"&gt;[[#Baratay|Baratay &amp; Hardouin-Fugier]], p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate proof of a tamer's dominance and control over a lion is demonstrated by the placing of the tamer's head in the lion's mouth. The now-iconic lion tamer's chair was possibly first used by American [[Clyde Beatty]] (1903–1965).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first=David | last=Feldman | authorlink=David Feldman (author) | year=1993 | title=How Does Aspirin Find a Headache? | publisher=HarperCollins | isbn= 978-0-06-016923-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Man-eating===
{{Main|Man-eater}}
[[Image:Lionsoftsavo2008.jpg|thumb|right|275px|The [[Tsavo Man-Eaters]] on display in the [[Field Museum of Natural History]] in [[Chicago]], Illinois.]]

Lions do not usually hunt humans but some&amp;nbsp;–&amp;#32;usually males&amp;nbsp;–&amp;#32;seem to seek them out. One well-publicised case is the [[Tsavo maneaters]]; in 1898, 28 officially recorded railway workers building the [[Uganda Railway|Kenya-Uganda Railway]] were taken by lions over nine months during the construction of a bridge over the [[Tsavo River]] in Kenya.&lt;ref name=Patterson&gt;{{cite book |last=Patterson |first=Bruce D. |year=2004 |title=The Lions of Tsavo: Exploring the Legacy of Africa's Notorious Man-Eaters |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=978-0-07-136333-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hunter who killed the lions wrote a book detailing the animals' predatory behaviour; they were larger than normal and lacked manes, and one seemed to suffer from tooth decay. The infirmity theory, including tooth decay, is not favoured by all researchers; an analysis of teeth and jaws of man-eating lions in museum collections suggests that while tooth decay may explain some incidents, prey depletion in human-dominated areas is a more likely cause of lion predation on humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Patterson |first=Bruce D. |author2=Neiburger, Ellis J.|author3=Kasiki, Samuel M. |date=February 2003 |title=Tooth Breakage and Dental Disease as Causes of Carnivore–Human Conflicts |journal=Journal of Mammalogy |volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=190–96 |doi=10.1644/1545-1542(2003)084&lt;0190:TBADDA&gt;2.0.CO;2 |year=2003 |bibcode=2007JMamm..88..275L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their analysis of man-eating&amp;nbsp;–&amp;#32;including the Tsavo incident&amp;nbsp;–&amp;#32;Kerbis Peterhans and Gnoske acknowledge that sick or injured animals may be more prone to man-eating but that the behaviour is "not unusual, nor necessarily 'aberrant{{'"}} where the opportunity exists; if inducements such as access to livestock or human corpses are present, lions will regularly prey upon human beings. The authors note the relationship is well-attested among other pantherines and primates in the fossil record.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.man-eater.info/gpage6.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030031426/http://www.man-eater.info/gpage6.html |archivedate=30 October 2007 |accessdate=7 July 2007 |last=Peterhans |first=Julian C.

The lion's proclivity for man-eating has been systematically examined. American and Tanzanian scientists report that man-eating behaviour in rural areas of Tanzania increased greatly from 1990 to 2005. At least 563 villagers were attacked and many eaten over this period – a number far exceeding the Tsavo attacks. The incidents occurred near [[Selous Game Reserve|Selous National Park]] in [[Rufiji River|Rufiji District]] and in [[Lindi Region|Lindi Province]] near the Mozambican border. While the expansion of villages into bush country is one concern, the authors argue conservation policy must mitigate the danger because in this case, conservation contributes directly to human deaths. Cases in Lindi in which lions seize humans from the centres of substantial villages have been documented.&lt;ref name="Packer05"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Packer |first=C. |last2=Ikanda | first2= D. |last3=Kissui| first3= B. |last4= Kushnir| first4= H. |date=2005 |title=Conservation biology: lion attacks on humans in Tanzania |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=436 |issue=7053 |pages=927–28 |doi=10.1038/436927a| pmid=16107828|bibcode=2005Natur.436..927P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study of 1,000 people attacked by lions in southern Tanzania between 1988 and 2009 found that the weeks following the [[full moon]], when there was less moonlight, were a strong indicator of increased night-time attacks on people.&lt;ref name="fullmoon"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Fear of Darkness, the Full Moon and the Nocturnal Ecology of African Lions |last=Packer |first=C |journal=[[PLOS One]] |date=July 2011 |volume=6 |issue=7 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0022285 |author2=Swanson, A. |author3=Ikanda, D. |author4=Kushnir, H. |editor1-last=Rands |editor1-first=Sean, A. |pages=e22285 |pmid=21799812 |pmc=3140494|bibcode=2011PLoSO...622285P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Robert R. Frump, Mozambican refugees regularly crossing Kruger National Park, South Africa, at night are attacked and eaten by lions; park officials have said man-eating is a problem there. Frump said thousands may have been killed in the decades after [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid]] sealed the park and forced refugees to cross the park at night. For nearly a century before the border was sealed, Mozambicans had regularly crossed the park in daytime with little harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Frump |first=RR |title=The Man-Eaters of Eden: Life and Death in Kruger National Park |year=2006 |publisher=The Lyons Press |isbn=978-1-59228-892-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Packer estimates between 200 and 400 Tanzanians are killed each year by wild animals and that lions are thought to kill at least 70 of these. According to Packer between 1990 and 2004, lions attacked 815 people in Tanzania and killed 563. Packer and Ikanda are among the few [[conservation movement|conservationists]] who believe western conservation efforts must take account of these matters because of ethical concerns about human life and the long-term success of conservation efforts and lion preservation.&lt;ref name="Packer05"/&gt;

A man-eating lion was killed by game scouts in Southern Tanzania in April 2004. It is believed to have killed and eaten at least 35&amp;nbsp;people in a series of incidents covering several villages in the coastal [[Rufiji Delta]] region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Toothache 'made lion eat humans' |last=Dickinson |first=Daniel |date=19 October 2004 |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3756180.stm |accessdate=25 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr Rolf D. Baldus, the [[GTZ]] wildlife programme coordinator, said it was likely that the lion preyed on humans because it had a large [[abscess]] beneath a cracked [[molar (tooth)|molar]] and wrote, "This lion probably experienced a lot of pain, particularly when it was chewing".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Baldus |first=R |date=March 2006 |title=A man-eating lion (''Panthera leo'') from Tanzania with a toothache |journal=European Journal of Wildlife Research |volume=52 |issue= 1 |pages= 59–62|doi=10.1007/s10344-005-0008-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; As in other cases this lion was large, lacked a mane, and had a tooth problem.

The "All-Africa" record of man-eating generally is considered to be a collection of incidents between the early 1930s and the late 1940s in modern-day Tanzania inflicted by a pride known as the "Njombe lions". Game warden and hunter [[George Gilman Rushby|George Rushby]] eventually dispatched the pride, which over three generations is thought to have killed and eaten 1,500 to 2,000 people in [[Njombe]] district.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Rushby |first=George G. |title=No More the Tusker |year=1965 |publisher=W.

Sometimes, Asiatic lions may become man-eaters. The area of the Gir sanctuary is now insufficient to sustain their large number&lt;ref name="OIM2003"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?220509 |title=The Mane Don't Fit |last=Desai |first=Darshan |work=Outlook India Magazine |publisher=Outlookindia.com |date=23 June 2003 |accessdate=21 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lions have moved outside it, making them a potential threat to people in and around the park.

[[File:Lions_painting,_Chauvet_Cave_(museum_replica).jpg|thumb|Upper Paleolithic cave painting depicting lions, found in the Chauvet Cave, France.&lt;ref name=Chauvet1996/&gt;]]

The lion is one of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture. It has been extensively depicted in sculptures and paintings, on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature.&lt;ref name=Guggisberg1975/&gt; It appeared as a symbol for strength and nobility in cultures across Europe, Asia and Africa, despite incidents of attacks on people. The lion has been depicted as "king of the jungle" and "king of beasts", and thus became a popular symbol for royalty and stateliness.&lt;ref name="Garai73"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Garai |first=J. |title=The Book of Symbols |year=1973 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |isbn=978-0-671-21773-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Egyptians portrayed several of their [[List of war deities|war deities]] as lionesses, which they revered as fierce hunters. Egyptian deities associated with lions include: [[Bastet|Bast]], [[Mafdet]], [[Menhit]], [[Pakhet]], [[Sekhmet]], [[Tefnut]] and the [[Sphinx]].&lt;ref name="Garai73"/&gt; In Egypt, the avenging goddess Sekhmet, represented as a lioness, symbolized the heat of the sun. The lion was also believed to act as a guide to the underworld, through which the sun was believed to pass each night.

In [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], cultural views of the lion have varied by region. In some cultures, the lion symbolises power and royalty, and some rulers had the word "lion" in their nickname. For example, [[Sundiata Keita|Marijata]] of the [[Mali Empire]] was given the name "Lion of Mali".&lt;ref name="Lynch"/&gt; [[Njaay]], the founder of the [[Waalo]] kingdom, is said to have been raised by lions and returned to his people part-lion to unite them using the knowledge he learned from the lions. In parts of West Africa, to be compared with a lion was considered to be a great compliment. Lions were considered the top class in these cultures' social hierarchies.&lt;ref name="Hogarth"/&gt; In more heavily forested areas where lions were rare, the leopard represented the top of the hierarchy.&lt;ref name="Jackson119"&gt;[[#Jackson|Jackson]], p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Swahili language|Swahili]], the lion is known as ''simba'' which also means "aggressive", "king" and "strong".&lt;ref name="BCKM1993"/&gt;

The theme of the royal lion hunt, a common motif in the early iconography in West Asia, symbolized death and resurrection; the continuation of life was ensured by the killing of a god-like animal.

The Asiatic lion is a common motif in [[Chinese art]]; it was first used in art during the late [[Spring and Autumn period]] (fifth or sixth century BC) and became more popular during the [[Han Dynasty]] (206 BC – AD 220) when [[imperial guardian lions]] started to be placed in front of imperial palaces for protection. Because lions have never been native to China, early depictions were somewhat unrealistic; after the introduction of [[Buddhist art]] to China in the [[Tang Dynasty]] after the sixth century AD, lions were usually depicted wingless with shorter, thicker bodies and curly manes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Li |last=Ling |date=May 2002 |url=http://www.cityu.edu.hk/ccs/Newsletter/newsletter4/Lion/Lion.htm | title = The Two-Way Process in the Age of Globalization |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050406143133/http://www.cityu.edu.hk/ccs/Newsletter/newsletter4/Lion/Lion.htm | archivedate=6 April 2005 |others = Egan, Ronald transl. |newspaper=Ex/Change |type=newsletter |publisher=[[City University of Hong Kong]] |issue=4 |accessdate=26 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[lion dance]] is a traditional dance in [[Chinese culture]] in which performers in lion costumes mimic a lion's movements, often with musical accompaniment from cymbals, drums and gongs.

The '''McLuhan Program in Culture and Technology''' started in 1963 as the '''Centre for Culture and Technology''', initially a card pinned to the door of [[Marshall McLuhan]]'s office in the English Department at the [[University of Toronto]]. It then had no organized program for research or teaching, but gained in prestige from the worldwide popularity of ''Understanding Media'' (1964) and grew in McLuhan's last decade in Toronto, assisted by [[Derrick de Kerckhove]] and McLuhan's son Eric, who became a director of the McLuhan Program International.&lt;ref&gt;http://projects.chass.utoronto.ca/mcluhan-studies/eric.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, the McLuhan Program became a part of the [[University of Toronto]]'s [[University of Toronto Faculty of Information|Faculty of Information]]. The program's curriculum is based on the works of [[Marshall McLuhan]] and other media theorists. In 2009, the Faculty of Information launched the [[University of Toronto Faculty of Information#Coach House Institute|Coach House Institute]] (CHI) as a clearly defined research unit under which the McLuhan Program in Culture and Technology now operates. In 2016 under Interim Director, Prof Seamus Ross, the Institute receive approval for its renaming as the McLuhan Centre for Culture and Technology in recognition of [[Marshall McLuhan]] intellectual contributions.  The McLuhan Program is now subsumed under this Centre.

Sarah Sharma, an Associate Professor of Media Theory from the Institute of Communication, Culture, Information and Technology (ICCIT) and the Faculty of Information (St. George), began a five year term as director. Professor Sharma's research and teaching focuses on feminist approaches to technology, including issues related to temporality and media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chi.utoronto.ca/prof-sarah-sharma-appointed-director-mcluhan-centre/|title=Prof. Sarah Sharma Appointed Director of McLuhan Centre - McLuhan Centre for Culture and Technology|date=2016-12-13|work=McLuhan Centre for Culture and Technology|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Sharma's thematic for the 2017-2018 Monday Night Seminars at the McLuhan Centre is MsUnderstanding Media which extends and introduces feminist approaches to technology to McLuhan's formulations of technology and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chi.utoronto.ca/msunderstanding-media-2/|title=Monday Night Seminars - McLuhan Centre for Culture and Technology|last=University of Toronto|first=|date=2017-07-19|work=McLuhan Centre for Culture and Technology|access-date=2017-11-14|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4981">'''Microfadeometry''' is a technique that uses tiny spots of intense light to probe and measure color changes in objects of art that are particularly sensitive to light exposure.&lt;ref name="six"&gt;[http://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/services/scientific-scientifique/microfade-microvieillissement-eng.aspx Microfade Testing Service], Canadian Conservation Institute. (2014, June 2).&lt;/ref&gt;
This process is completed using a recently designed instrument known as a microfading tester. The data from the test is represented by a reflectance spectra.

== History ==
Light-fastness testing dates back to as early as 1733. In the late 19th century with early [[art conservation]] studies, Russell and Abney published Action of Light on Watercolors in 1888 sparking a concern with light and the aging of cultural materials.&lt;ref name="three"&gt;Druzik, J. Oriel Microfading Tester (MFT): a Brief Description. ''Research and Technical Studies''. '''2010''', ''2'', 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Microfading, as a technique, was first identified in Paul Whitmore’s lab book entry on September 21, 1994. His work on the topic was later published in 1999.&lt;ref name="four"&gt;Ford, B. Non-Destructive Microfade Testing at the National Museum of Australia. ''The Australian Institute for the Conservation of Cultural Material Bulletin''. '''2011''', ''32'', 54-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application ==
Before the creation of this technique, recording light-stability information directly from the objects was nearly impossible. Through the use of microfading technology, it is now possible to obtain both information about the chemical characterization of the dyes and the associated kinetics of color change.&lt;ref name="three"/&gt;
Benchtop microfaders and microfading testers are used to test and analyze light damage on cultural objects and potential light damage to objects in museum collections.&lt;ref name="seven"&gt;Chiari, G. Conservation Science Investigation. ''International Preservation News''. '''2010''', ''50'', 11-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==
Using a powerful [[xenon arc lamp]], 1 lumen of light is focused through an [[optical fiber]] onto a 300–400&amp;nbsp;μm spot of the object’s surface. The reflected light is collected by a second fiber optic.&lt;ref name="four"/&gt; The period of exposure is monitored with a probe that transforms the reflectance spectrum into color coordinates in real-time. A typical microfading test is achieved in less than 10 minutes and replicates exposures equivalent to 5–12 years of display at normal museum light levels.&lt;ref name="eight"&gt;del Hoyo-Melendez, J. Micro-fading Spectrometry. ''Fibers and Polymers''. '''2012''', ''13'', 1079-1085.&lt;/ref&gt; The output of the xenon arc lamp is kept at a constant by an exposure controller while it is filtered to 400–710&amp;nbsp;nm using a water filter.&lt;ref name="five"&gt;Arnaud, C.H. [http://cen.acs.org/articles/87/i13/Shining-Light-Art.html Shining Light On Art],  Shining Light on Art. ''Chemical &amp; Engineering News''. '''2009''', ''87'', 44-55.&lt;/ref&gt; The spectrum is then used to quantify the amount of time it would take for the color change to result in a noticeable difference. This information is used to retrofit display conditions and improve the protection of vulnerable objects.
Calibration of the instrument is achieved by using internal standards such as the [[Blue Wool Scale]].&lt;ref name="two"&gt;Lerwill, A. [https://www.imagepermanenceinstitute.org/resources/newsletter-archive/v24/microfading-questioning-basics Microfading: Questioning the Basics], Microfading: Questioning the Basics. ''Image Permanence Institute Bulletin''. '''2013'''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reliability ==
Concerns associated with microfading techniques include: diffusion-limited photo-oxidation reaction rates, dehydration and heating of the sample, the variability of using and measuring ISO Blue Wool Standards,&lt;ref name="eight"/&gt; variation in spectral power distribution between lamps used in object display and the lamp used in accelerated light aging, the small sampling area, the required number of sample the length of fading time and the potential interaction of individual chemical components of the object tested.&lt;ref name="two"/&gt;

== Institutional Use ==
Cultural institutions that house their own instruments for microfadeometry are: [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in Pittsburgh, the [[Library of Congress]] and the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington DC, the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, the [[Canadian Conservation Institute]] in Ottawa, the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]], the Art Conservation Department at Buffalo State College in New York,&lt;ref name="one"&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/conservation/our_projects/science/lighting/microfade.html Museum Lighting Research], J. Paul Getty Trust. (2010, July).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] (United Kingdom).

[[Image:RAF Observation Post Bunker.jpg|right|thumb|An observation post for airfield defense coordination.]]

An '''observation post''' (commonly abbreviated '''OP'''), temporary or fixed, is a position from which [[soldier]]s can watch enemy movements, to warn of approaching soldiers (such as in [[trench warfare]]), or to [[Artillery observer|direct artillery fire]]. In strict military terminology, an observation post is ''any'' preselected position from which observations are to be made - this may include very temporary installations such as a vehicle parked as a roadside checkpoint, or even an airborne aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/Transcripts/Transcript.aspx?TranscriptID=386 DoD News Briefing, February 15, 1996 1:30 pm EST] (from a [[United States Department of Defense|DoD]] news briefing. Accessed 2008-06-21.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
[[Image:Disguisetactics.jpg|thumb|right|[[German Empire|German]] [[World War I]] observation post disguised as a tree.]]

When selecting a (temporary) observation post, trained troops are to avoid obvious and conspicuous locations such as hilltops, [[water tower]]s or other isolated terrain features, and to ensure that the observation post can be reached via a [[:wikt:conceal|concealed]] route. This is especially important as the observer in the post should be rotated every 20–30 minutes, as [[alertness|vigilance]] decreases markedly after such a time.&lt;ref name="IM"/&gt; 

Observation posts should be manned with at least two personnel (more, for defense and observer rotation, if the post is to be retained for longer durations), and should be provided a means of communication with their [[chain of command]], preferably by phone instead of by radio.&lt;ref name="IM"&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/accp/in0202/le2l.htm#pl Observation posts] (from the ''Mechanized Infantry Squad Operations (Bradley)'' course manual, [[United States Army Infantry School]], 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==

Often being positioned in secret very close to the enemy, an observation post is usually a small construct, often consisting largely of [[Military camouflage|camouflage]] materials and possibly weather cover. However, where [[Front (military)|frontlines]] are expected to be stable for a longer time, an observation post (or '''ground observation post''') may develop into a [[bunker]]-like installation.

It is not unusual for soldiers to occupy a 'hide' for long periods of time. To avoid detection they have to remove all their own waste, this is achieved with the aid of clingfilm, plastic bags and empty water bottles.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

One example of makeshift observation posts is [[Gaza Baptist Church]], which was commandeered by both [[Fatah]] and [[Hamas]] troops during the [[Fatah–Hamas conflict]].

In [[botany]], the '''petiole''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|iː|t|i|oʊ|l}}) is the stalk that attaches the [[leaf]] blade to the [[Plant stem|stem]].&lt;ref name=Beentje&gt;{{cite book|first=H.|last=Beentje|title=The Kew plant glossary|publisher=Kew Publishing|location=London|isbn=9781842464229}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|87}}&lt;ref name="Mauseth"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mauseth |first=James D |title=Botany: An Introduction to Plant Biology |publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning |year=2003 |isbn=0-7637-2134-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|171}} Outgrowths appearing on each side of the petiole in some species are called [[stipule]]s.  Leaves lacking a petiole are called [[Sessility (botany)|sessile]] or '''epetiolate'''.

==Description==
[[File:Crimson Red Rhubarb.JPG|thumb|Harvested rhubarb petioles with leaves attached]]

The petiole is a stalk that attaches a leaf to the plant stem. In '''petiolate''' leaves, the leaf stalk (petiole) may be long, as in the leaves of celery and rhubarb, short or completely absent, in which case the blade attaches directly to the stem and is said to be '''sessile'''.  '''Subpetiolate''' leaves are nearly petiolate, or have an extremely short petiole, and may appear sessile.&lt;ref name="Mauseth"/&gt;{{rp|157}} The broomrape family [[Orobanchaceae]] is an example of a family in which the leaves are always sessile.&lt;ref name=Stace&gt;{{cite book|last=Stace|first=C. A.|authorlink = Stace, C. A.|year=2010|title=New Flora of the British Isles|edition=Third|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location = Cambridge, U.K.| isbn=9780521707725}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|639}}  In some other plant groups, such as the speedwell genus ''[[Veronica (plant)|Veronica]]'', petiolate and sessile leaves may occur in different species.&lt;ref name=Stace /&gt;{{rp|584}}

In the grasses ([[Poaceae]]) the leaves are apetiolate, but the leaf blade may be narrowed at the junction with the leaf sheath to form a ''pseudopetiole'', as in ''[[Pseudosasa japonica]]''.&lt;ref name=Heywood&gt;{{cite book|first=V.H.|last=Heywood|first2=R.K.|last2=Brummitt|first3=A.|last3=Culham|first4=O.|last4=Seberg|year=2007|title= Flowering plant families of the world|publisher=Firefly Books|location=New York|isbn=9781554072064}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|391}}

In plants with [[Leaf#Divisions_of_the_blade|compound leaves]], the leaflets are attached to a continuation of the petiole called the [[Rachis#in botany|rachis]].&lt;ref name=Beentje/&gt;{{rp|98}}  Each leaflet may be attached to the rachis by a short stalk called the petiolule.&lt;ref name=Beentje/&gt;{{rp|87}}  There may be swollen regions at either end of the petiole known as pulvina (singular=[[pulvinus]])&lt;ref name=Beentje/&gt;{{rp|97}} that are composed of a flexible tissue that allows leaf movement. Pulvina are common in the bean family [[Fabaceae]] and the prayer plant family [[Marantaceae]]. A pulvinus on a petiolule is called a pulvinulus. 

In some plants, the petioles are flattened and widened, to become [[Wikt:phyllode|'''phyllodes''' or '''phyllodia''']], or '''cladophylls''' and the true leaves may be reduced or absent.  Thus, the phyllode comes to serve the functions of the leaf.  Phyllodes are common in the genus ''[[Acacia]]'', especially the Australian species, at one time put in ''Acacia'' subgenus ''Phyllodineae''.

[[Image:Acacia koa with phyllode between the branch and the compound leaves.JPG|thumb|right|220px|''[[Acacia koa]]'' with phyllode between the branch and the [[compound leaves]]]]
In ''[[Acacia koa]]'', the phyllodes are leathery and thick, allowing the tree to survive stressful environments.  The petiole allows partially submerged [[hydrophyte]]s to have leaves floating at different depths, the petiole being between the node and the stem.

In plants such as rhubarb (''[[Rheum rhabarbarum]]''), celery (''[[Apium graveolens]]''), [[artichokes]] and [[cardoons]] (''Cynara cardunculus'') the petioles ("stalks" or "ribs") are cultivated as edible crops. The petiole of rhubarb grows directly from the [[rhizome]] and produces the leaf at its end. Botanically it is categorized as a vegetable and culinarily used as a fruit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Foust |first=Clifford M. |title=Rhubarb: The Wondrous Drug |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton |year=1992 |isbn=0-691-08747-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.HighAltitudeRhubarb.com High Altitude Rhubarb ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
''Petiole'' comes from [[Latin]] ''petiolus'', or ''peciolus'' "little foot", "stem", an alternative [[diminutive]] of ''pes'' "foot". The regular diminutive ''pediculus'' is also used for "foot stalk".

[[Image:Pelagiczone.svg|thumb|left|The layers of the pelagic zone.]]
{{Refimprove|date=January 2017}}
The '''photic zone''', '''euphotic zone''' (Greek for "well lit": {{lang|grc|εὖ}} "well" + {{lang|grc|φῶς}} "light"), or '''sunlight (or sunlit) zone''' is the uppermost layer of water in a lake or ocean that is exposed to intense sunlight. It corresponds roughly to the layer above the [[compensation point]], i.e. depth where the rate of carbon dioxide uptake, or equivalently, the rate of photosynthetic oxygen production, is equal to the rate of carbon dioxide production, equivalent to the rate of respiratory oxygen consumption, i.e. the depth where net carbon dioxide assimilation is zero.

It extends from the surface down to a depth where light intensity falls to one percent of that at the surface, called the euphotic depth. Accordingly, its thickness depends on the extent of light [[attenuation]] in the water column. Typical euphotic depths vary from only a few centimetres in highly [[turbidity|turbid]] [[eutrophic]] lakes, to around 200 meters in the open [[ocean]]. It also varies with seasonal changes in turbidity.

Since the photic zone is where almost all of the [[photosynthesis]] occurs, the depth of the photic zone is generally proportional to the level of [[primary production]] that occurs in that area of the ocean. About 90% of all [[marine life]] lives in the photic zone. A small amount of primary production is generated deep in the [[abyssal zone]] around the [[hydrothermal vent]]s which exist along some [[mid-ocean ridge|mid-oceanic ridges]]. 

The zone which extends from the base of the euphotic zone to about 200 metres is sometimes called the disphotic zone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/457662/photic-zone Photic zone] ''Encyclopædia Britannica Online''. 14 August 2009.
&lt;/ref&gt;  While there is some light, it is insufficient for photosynthesis, or at least insufficient for photosynthesis at a rate greater than [[cellular respiration|respiration]].  The euphotic zone together with the disphotic zone coincides with the [[epipelagic zone]]. The bottommost zone, below the euphotic zone, is called the [[aphotic zone]]. Most [[deep ocean]] waters belong to this zone.

The [[transparency (optics)|transparency]] of the water, which determines the depth of the photic zone, is measured simply with a [[Secchi disk]].  It may also be measured with a [[photometer]] lowered into the water.

A '''physical symbol system''' (also called a [[formal system]]) takes physical patterns (symbols), combining them into structures (expressions) and manipulating them (using processes) to produce new expressions.

The '''physical symbol system hypothesis''' ('''PSSH''') is a position in the [[philosophy of artificial intelligence]] formulated by [[Allen Newell]] and [[Herbert A. Simon]]. They wrote:
{{Quotation|"A physical symbol system has the [[sufficient|necessary and sufficient means]] for general intelligent action."&lt;ref name=NS&gt;{{Harvnb|Newell|Simon|1976|p=116}} and {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Allen Newell]] and [[Herbert A. Simon]]}}
This claim implies both that human thinking is a kind of symbol manipulation (because a symbol system is necessary for intelligence) and that machines can be intelligent (because a symbol system is [[sufficient]] for intelligence).&lt;ref name="Nilsson 2007 p=1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Nilsson|2007|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea has philosophical roots in [[Hobbes]] (who claimed reasoning was "nothing more than reckoning"), [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] (who attempted to create a logical calculus of all human ideas),  [[David Hume|Hume]] (who thought perception could be reduced to "atomic impressions") and even [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] (who analyzed all experience as controlled by formal rules).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dreyfus|1979|p=156}}, {{Harvnb|Haugeland|pp=15&amp;ndash;44}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latest version is called the [[computational theory of mind]], associated with philosophers [[Hilary Putnam]] and [[Jerry Fodor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Horst|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hypothesis has been criticized strongly by various parties, but is a core part of AI research. A common critical view is that the hypothesis seems appropriate for higher-level intelligence such as playing chess, but less appropriate for commonplace intelligence such as vision. A distinction is usually made between the kind of high level symbols that directly correspond with objects in the world, such as &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;dog&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; and &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;tail&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; and the more complex "symbols" that are present in a machine like a [[neural network]].

== Examples ==
Examples of physical symbol systems include:
* [[Formal logic]]: the symbols are words like "and", "or", "not", "for all x" and so on. The expressions are statements in formal logic which can be true or false.  The processes are the rules of logical deduction.
* [[Elementary algebra|Algebra]]: the symbols are "+", "×", "''x''", "''y''", "1", "2", "3", etc. The expressions are equations. The processes are the rules of algebra, that allow one to manipulate a mathematical expression and retain its truth.
* A [[digital computer]]: the symbols are zeros and ones of computer memory, the processes are the operations of the [[CPU]] that change memory.
* [[Chess]]: the symbols are the pieces, the processes are the legal chess moves, the expressions are the positions of all the pieces on the board.

The physical symbol system hypothesis claims that both of these are also examples of physical symbol systems:
* Intelligent human thought: the symbols are encoded in our brains. The expressions are [[thought]]s. The processes are the mental operations of thinking.
* A running [[artificial intelligence]] program: the symbols are data. The expressions are more data. The processes are programs that manipulate the data.

== Arguments in favor of the physical symbol system hypothesis ==
=== Newell and Simon ===
Two lines of evidence suggested to [[Allen Newell]] and [[Herbert A. Simon]] that "symbol manipulation" was the essence of both human and machine intelligence: the development of [[artificial intelligence]] programs and psychological experiments on human beings.

First, in the early decades of AI research there were a number of very successful programs that used high level symbol processing, such as [[Allen Newell|Newell]] and [[Herbert A. Simon]]'s [[General Problem Solver]] or [[Terry Winograd]]'s [[SHRDLU]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dreyfus|1979|pp=130&amp;ndash;148}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Haugeland]] named this kind of AI research "Good Old Fashioned AI" or [[GOFAI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haugeland|1985|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Expert system]]s and [[logic programming]] are descendants of this tradition. The success of these programs suggested that symbol processing systems could simulate any intelligent action.

And second, [[Psychology|psychological]] experiments carried out at the same time found that, for difficult problems in logic, planning or any kind of "puzzle solving", people used this kind of symbol processing as well. AI researchers were able to simulate the step by step problem solving skills of people with computer programs. This collaboration and the issues it raised eventually would lead to the creation of the field of [[cognitive science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dreyfus|1979|pp=91&amp;ndash;129, 170&amp;ndash;174}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This type of research was called "[[cognitive simulation]]".) This line of research suggested that human problem solving consisted primarily of the manipulation of high level symbols.

=== Symbols vs. signals ===
In Newell and Simon's arguments, the "symbols" that the hypothesis is referring to are physical objects that represent things in the world, symbols such as &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;dog&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; that have a recognizable [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] or [[denotation]] and can be [[compositionality|composed]] with other symbols to create more complex symbols.

However, it is also possible to interpret the hypothesis as referring to the simple abstract 0s and 1s in the memory of a digital computer or the stream of 0s and 1s passing through the perceptual apparatus of a robot.  These are, in some sense, symbols as well, although it is not always possible to determine exactly what the symbols are standing for. In this version of the hypothesis, no distinction is being made between "symbols" and "signals", as [[David Touretzky]] and [[Dean Pomerleau]] explain.&lt;ref name=TouretzkyPomerleau1994&gt;
Reconstructing Physical Symbol Systems
David S. Touretzky and Dean A. Pomerleau

Cognitive Science 18(2):345&amp;ndash;353, 1994.
http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/pubs/simon-reply-www.ps.gz
&lt;/ref&gt;

Under this interpretation, the physical symbol system hypothesis asserts merely that intelligence can be ''digitized''. This is a weaker claim. Indeed, [[David Touretzky|Touretzky]] and [[Dean Pomerleau|Pomerleau]] write that if symbols and signals are the same thing, then  "[s]ufficiency is a given, unless one is a dualist or some other sort of mystic, because physical symbol systems are [[Turing completeness|Turing-universal]]."&lt;ref name=TouretzkyPomerleau1994/&gt; The widely accepted [[Church&amp;ndash;Turing thesis]] holds that any [[Turing completeness|Turing-universal]] system can simulate any conceivable process that can be digitized, given enough time and memory. Since any digital computer is [[Turing completeness|Turing-universal]], any digital computer can, in theory, simulate anything that can be digitized to a sufficient level of precision, including the behavior of intelligent organisms. The necessary condition of the physical symbol systems hypothesis can likewise be finessed, since we are willing to accept almost any signal as a form of "symbol" and all intelligent biological systems have signal pathways.

== Criticism ==

[[Nils Nilsson (researcher)|Nils Nilsson]] has identified four main "themes" or grounds in which the physical symbol system hypothesis has been attacked.&lt;ref name="Nilsson 2007 p=1"/&gt;
#The "erroneous claim that the [physical symbol system hypothesis] lacks [[symbol grounding]]" which is presumed to be a requirement for general intelligent action.
#The common belief that AI requires non-symbolic processing (that which can be supplied by a connectionist architecture for instance).
#The common statement that the brain is simply not a computer and that "computation as it is currently understood, does not provide an appropriate model for intelligence".
#And last of all that it is also believed in by some that the brain is essentially mindless, most of what takes place are chemical reactions and that human intelligent behaviour is analogous to the intelligent behaviour displayed for example by ant colonies.

=== Dreyfus and the primacy of unconscious skills ===
{{Main|Dreyfus' critique of artificial intelligence}}

[[Hubert Dreyfus]] attacked the necessary condition of the physical symbol system hypothesis, calling it "the psychological assumption" and defining it thus:
* ''The mind can be viewed as a device operating on bits of information according to formal rules.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dreyfus|1979|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Dreyfus refuted this by showing that human intelligence and expertise depended primarily on unconscious instincts rather than conscious symbolic manipulation. Experts solve problems quickly by using their intuitions, rather than step-by-step trial and error searches. Dreyfus argued that these unconscious skills would never be captured in formal rules.&lt;ref name=D&gt;{{Harvnb|Dreyfus|1972}}, {{Harvnb|Dreyfus|1979}}, {{Harvnb|Dreyfus|Dreyfus|1986}}. See also {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=950&amp;ndash;952}}, {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|120&amp;ndash;132}} and {{Harvnb|Hearn|2007|pp=50&amp;ndash;51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Searle and his Chinese room ===
{{Main|Chinese room}}

[[John Searle]]'s [[Chinese room]] argument, presented in 1980, attempted to show that a program (or any physical symbol system) could not be said to "understand" the symbols that it uses; that the symbols themselves have no meaning or semantic content, and so the machine can never be truly intelligent from symbol manipulation alone. &lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1980}}, {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|pp=269&amp;ndash;271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brooks and the roboticists ===
{{Main|Artificial intelligence, situated approach|Moravec's paradox}}
In the sixties and seventies, several laboratories attempted to build [[robot]]s that used symbols to represent the world and plan actions (such as the [[Stanford Cart]]). These projects had limited success. In the middle eighties, [[Rodney Brooks]] of [[MIT]] was able to build robots that had superior ability to move and survive without the use of symbolic reasoning at all. Brooks (and others, such as [[Hans Moravec]]) discovered that our most basic skills of motion, survival, perception, balance and so on did not seem to require high level symbols at all, that in fact, the use of high level symbols was more complicated and less successful.

In a 1990 paper [http://people.csail.mit.edu/brooks/papers/elephants.pdf Elephants Don't Play Chess], robotics researcher [[Rodney Brooks]] took direct aim at the physical symbol system hypothesis, arguing that symbols are not always necessary since "the world is its own best model. It is always exactly up to date. It always has every detail there is to be known. The trick is to sense it appropriately and often enough."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brooks 1990|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Connectionism ===
{{Main|Connectionism}}

=== Embodied philosophy ===
{{Main|Embodied philosophy}}

[[George Lakoff]], [[Mark Turner (cognitive scientist)|Mark Turner]] and others have argued that our abstract skills in areas such as [[mathematic]]s, [[ethic]]s and [[philosophy]] depend on unconscious skills that derive from the body, and that conscious symbol manipulation is only a small part of our intelligence.

'''Postmodern philosophy''' is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] movement that arose in the second half of the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century as a critical response to assumptions allegedly present in [[modern philosophy|modernist philosophical ideas]] regarding culture, identity, history, or language that were developed during the 18th-century [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;{{cite web|last1=Duignan|first1=Brian|title=postmodernism (philosophy) (Encyclopædia Britannica)|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/postmodernism-philosophy|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/postmodern|title=Definition of POSTMODERN|author=|date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Postmodernist thinkers developed concepts like [[Difference (philosophy)|difference]], repetition, [[Trace (deconstruction)|trace]], and [[hyperreality]] to subvert "[[grand narratives]]," [[univocity of being]], and epistemic certainty.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2015/entries/postmodernism/|chapter=Postmodernism|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Aylesworth|first=Gary|date=2015|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Spring 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postmodern philosophy questions the importance of power relationships, personalization, and [[discourse]] in the "construction" of truth and world views. Many postmodernists appear to deny that an [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] reality exists, and appear to deny that there are objective moral values.&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

[[Jean-François Lyotard]] defined philosophical postmodernism in ''[[The Postmodern Condition]]'', writing "Simplifying to the extreme, I define postmodern as incredulity towards metanarratives,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge|last=Lyotard|first=J.-F.|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=1979|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where what he means by [[metanarrative]] is something like a unified, complete, universal, and epistemically certain story about everything that is. Postmodernists reject metanarratives because they reject the concept of truth that metanarratives presuppose. Postmodernist philosophers in general argue that truth is always contingent on historical and social context rather than being absolute and universal and that truth is always partial and "at issue" rather than being complete and certain.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Postmodern philosophy is often particularly skeptical about simple binary oppositions characteristic of [[structuralism]], emphasizing the problem of the philosopher cleanly distinguishing knowledge from ignorance, social progress from reversion, dominance from submission, good from bad, and presence from absence.&lt;ref&gt;Sim, Stuart. ''Routledge Companion to Postmodernism''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Victor and Charles Winquist. ''Encyclopedia of Postmodernism'' "Binary Opposition"&lt;/ref&gt; But, for the same reasons, postmodern philosophy should often be particularly skeptical about the complex spectral characteristics of things, emphasizing the problem of the philosopher again cleanly distinguishing concepts, for a concept must be understood in the context of its opposite, such as existence and nothingness, normality and abnormality, speech and writing, and the like.&lt;ref&gt;Derrida, Jacques; Bass, Alan (2001). "7 :Freud and the Scene of Writing". Writing and Difference (New ed.). London: Routledge. p. 276. {{ISBN|0203991788}}. Retrieved 8 September 2017. The model of hieroglyphic writing assembles more strikingly—though we find it in every form of writing—the diversity of the modes and functions of signs in dreams. Every sign—verbal or otherwise—may be used at different levels, in configurations and functions which are never prescribed by its "essence," but emerge from a play of differences.&lt;/ref&gt;

Postmodern philosophy also has strong relations with the substantial literature of [[critical theory]].&lt;ref&gt;''Problematizing Global Knowledge''. Theory, Culture &amp; Society. Vol. 23 (2-3). Sage, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristic claims ==
Many postmodern claims are a deliberate repudiation of certain 18th-century Enlightenment values. Such a postmodernist believes that there is no objective natural reality, and that logic and reason are mere conceptual constructs that are not universally valid. Two other characteristic postmodern practices are a denial that [[human nature]] exists, and a (sometimes moderate) skepticism toward claims that science and technology will change society for the better. Postmodernists also believe there are no objective moral values. Thus, postmodern philosophy suggests equality for all things. One's concept of good and another's concept of evil are to be equally correct, since good and evil are subjective. Since both good and evil are equally correct, a postmodernist then [[tolerate]]s both concepts, even if he or she disagrees with them subjectively.&lt;ref&gt;Baghramian, Maria and Carter, J. Adam, "[https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2017/entries/relativism/ Relativism]", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blackburn|first1=Simon|title=[[The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy]]|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press, UK|entry=Postmodernism|isbn=9780198610137|language=en|quote=In its poststructuralist aspects it includes a denial of... any fixed reality or truth or fact to be the object of enquiry.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postmodern writings often focus on [[deconstruction|deconstructing]] the role that power and ideology play in shaping discourse and belief. Postmodern philosophy shares [[ontology|ontological]] similarities with classical [[Philosophical skepticism|skeptical]] and [[Moral relativism|relativistic]] belief systems, and shares political similarities with modern [[identity politics]].&lt;ref name=britannica /&gt;

The ''[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' states that "The assumption that there is no common denominator in 'nature' or 'truth' ... that guarantees the possibility of neutral or objective thought" is a key assumption of postmodernism.&lt;ref&gt;Ermarth, Elizabeth Deeds. Postmodernism, 1998, doi:10.4324/9780415249126-N044-1. Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Taylor and Francis, https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/thematic/postmodernism/v-1.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]] has characterized the belief that "social science research can never generate objective or trustworthy knowledge" as an example of a postmodernist belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Council|first1=National Research|last2=Education|first2=Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and|last3=Education|first3=Center for|last4=Research|first4=Committee on Scientific Principles for Education|title=Scientific Research in Education|date=2002|publisher=National Academies Press|isbn=9780309082914|pages=20, 25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-François Lyotard]]'s seminal 1979 ''[[The Postmodern Condition]]'' stated that its hypotheses "should not be accorded predictive value in relation to reality, but strategic value in relation to the questions raised". Lyotard's statement in 1984 that "I define postmodern as incredulity toward meta-narratives" extends to incredulity toward science. [[Jacques Derrida]], who is generally identified as a postmodernist, stated that "every referent, all reality has the structure of a differential trace".&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; [[Paul Feyerabend]], one of the most famous twentieth-century philosophers of science, is often classified as a postmodernist; Feyerabend held that modern science is no more justified than witchcraft, and has denounced the "tyranny" of "abstract concepts such as 'truth', 'reality', or 'objectivity', which narrow people's vision and ways of being in the world".&lt;ref name="sep feyerabend"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Preston|first1=John|title=Paul Feyerabend|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/feyerabend/|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|accessdate=19 April 2018|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Phillips|first1=Denis Charles|last2=Burbules|first2=Nicholas C.|title=Postpositivism and Educational Research|date=2000|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9780847691227|page=1|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kidd|first1=Ian James|title=Was Feyerabend a Postmodernist?|journal=International Studies in the Philosophy of Science|date=21 December 2016|volume=30|issue=1|pages=55–68|doi=10.1080/02698595.2016.1240463|quote=This article asks whether the philosophy of Paul K.

Defenders of postmodernism state that many descriptions of postmodernism exaggerate its antipathy to science; for example, Feyerabend denied that he was "anti-science", accepted that some scientific ''theories'' are superior to other theories (even if science itself isn't superior to other modes of inquiry), and attempted conventional medical treatments during his fight against cancer.&lt;ref name="sep feyerabend"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horgan|first1=John|authorlink1=John Horgan|title=Was Philosopher Paul Feyerabend Really Science's "Worst Enemy"?|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/was-philosopher-paul-feyerabend-really-science-s-worst-enemy/|accessdate=19 April 2018|work=[[Scientific American]] Cross-check (blog)|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pierre|first1=Elizabeth Adams St|title=Comment: “Science” Rejects Postmodernism|journal=Educational Researcher|date=July 2016|volume=31|issue=8|pages=25–27|doi=10.3102/0013189X031008025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitional issues ==
Philosopher [[John Deely]] has argued for the contentious claim that the label "postmodern" for thinkers such as [[Derrida]] ''et al.'' is ''premature''.  Insofar as the "so-called" postmoderns follow the thoroughly ''modern'' trend of [[idealism]], it is more an ''ultra''modernism than anything else. A postmodernism that lives up to its name, therefore, must no longer confine itself to the premodern preoccupation with "things" nor with the modern confinement to "ideas," but must come to terms with the way of signs embodied in the semiotic doctrines of such thinkers as the Portuguese philosopher [[John Poinsot]] and the American philosopher [[Charles Sanders Peirce]].&lt;ref&gt;John Deely, ''Four Ages of Understanding: The First Postmodern Survey of Philosophy from Ancient Times to the Turn of the Twenty-First Century'' (Toronto: U. of Toronto, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Writes Deely,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The epoch of Greek and Latin philosophy was based on ''being'' in a quite precise sense: the existence exercised by things independently of human apprehension and attitude. The much briefer epoch of modern philosophy based itself rather on the instruments of human knowing, but in a way that unnecessarily compromised being. As the 20th century ends, there is reason to believe that a new philosophical epoch is dawning along with the new century, promising to be the richest epoch yet for human understanding. The postmodern era is positioned to synthesize at a higher level—the level of experience, where the being of things and the activity of the finite knower compenetrate one another and provide the materials whence can be derived knowledge of nature and knowledge of culture in their full symbiosis—the achievements of the ancients and the moderns in a way that gives full credit to the preoccupations of the two. The postmodern era has for its distinctive task in philosophy the exploration of a new path, no longer the ancient way of things nor the modern way of ideas, but the way of signs, whereby the peaks and valleys of ancient and modern thought alike can be surveyed and cultivated by a generation which has yet further peaks to climb and valleys to find.&lt;ref&gt;John Deely, "Philosophy and Experience," ''American Catholic Philosophical Quarterly'' LXVI.4 (Winter 1992), 299–319, esp. 314–15.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==
===Precursors===
Postmodern philosophy originated primarily in France during the mid-20th century. However, several philosophical antecedents inform many of postmodern philosophy's concerns.

It was greatly influenced by the writings of [[Søren Kierkegaard]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] in the 19th century and other early-to-mid 20th-century philosophers, including [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenologists]] [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Martin Heidegger]], [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] [[Jacques Lacan]], [[structuralism|structuralist]] [[Roland Barthes]], [[Georges Bataille]], and the later work of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]. Postmodern philosophy also drew from the world of the arts and architecture, particularly [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[John Cage]] and artists who practiced [[collage]], and the architecture of [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]] and the [[Pompidou Centre]].

===Early postmodern philosophers===
The most influential early postmodern philosophers were [[Jean Baudrillard]],  [[Jean-François Lyotard]], and [[Jacques Derrida]].  [[Michel Foucault]] is also often cited as an early postmodernist although he personally rejected that label. Following Nietzsche, Foucault argued that knowledge is produced through the operations of ''power'', and changes fundamentally in different historical periods.

The writings of Lyotard were largely concerned with the role of narrative in human culture, and particularly how that role has changed as we have left modernity and entered a "postindustrial" or [[postmodernity|postmodern condition]].  He argued that modern philosophies legitimized their truth-claims not (as they themselves claimed) on logical or empirical grounds, but rather on the grounds of accepted stories (or "[[metanarratives]]") about knowledge and the world—comparing these with Wittgenstein's concept of [[language-game]]s.  He further argued that in our postmodern condition, these metanarratives no longer work to legitimize truth-claims.  He suggested that in the wake of the collapse of modern metanarratives, people are developing a new "language-game"—one that does not make claims to absolute truth but rather celebrates a world of ever-changing relationships (among people and between people and the world).

Derrida, the father of [[deconstruction]], practiced philosophy as a form of textual criticism.  He criticized Western philosophy as privileging the concept of presence and ''logos'', as opposed to absence and markings or writings.

In the United States, the most famous pragmatist and self-proclaimed postmodernist was [[Richard Rorty]].  An analytic philosopher, Rorty believed that combining [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]'s criticism of the analytic-synthetic distinction with [[Wilfrid Sellars]]'s critique of the "[[Myth of the Given]]" allowed for an abandonment of the view of the thought or language as a mirror of a reality or external world.  Further, drawing upon [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]]'s criticism of the dualism between conceptual scheme and empirical content, he challenges the sense of questioning whether our particular concepts are related to the world in an appropriate way, whether we can justify our ways of describing the world as compared with other ways.  He argued that truth was not about getting it right or representing reality, but was part of a social practice and language was what served our purposes in a particular time; ancient languages are sometimes untranslatable into modern ones because they possess a different vocabulary and are unuseful today.  Donald Davidson is not usually considered a postmodernist, although he and Rorty have both acknowledged that there are few differences between their philosophies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/~knobe/rorty.html|title=An interview with Rorty|author=|date=|website=unc.edu|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, D., 1986, "A Coherence Theory of Truth and Knowledge," Truth And Interpretation, Perspectives on the Philosophy of Donald Davidson, ed. Ernest LePore, Basil Blackwell, Oxford, afterwords.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Memory types}}
[[File:Swissbit 2GB PC2-5300U-555.jpg|right|thumb|Example of [[read/write memory|writable]] [[volatile memory|volatile]] random-access memory: Synchronous [[Dynamic RAM]] [[DIMM|modules]], primarily used as main memory in [[personal computers]], [[workstation]]s, and [[Server (computing)|server]]s.]]

'''Random-access memory''' ('''RAM''' {{IPAc-en|r|æ|m}}) is a form of [[computer data storage]] that stores [[data]] and [[machine code]] currently being used. A [[Random access|random-access]] memory device allows [[data]] items to be [[read (computer)|read]] or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory. In contrast, with other direct-access data storage media such as [[hard disk]]s, [[CD-RW]]s, [[DVD-RW]]s and the older [[Magnetic tape data storage|magnetic tapes]] and [[drum memory]], the time required to read and write data items varies significantly depending on their physical locations on the recording medium, due to mechanical limitations such as media rotation speeds and arm movement.

RAM contains [[multiplexer|multiplexing]] and [[demultiplexing]] circuitry, to connect the data lines to the addressed storage for reading or writing the entry. Usually more than one bit of storage is accessed by the same address, and RAM devices often have multiple data lines and are said to be "8-bit" or "16-bit", etc. devices.

In today's technology, random-access memory takes the form of [[integrated circuit]]s.  RAM is normally associated with [[Volatile memory|volatile]] types of memory (such as [[DRAM]] [[DIMM|modules]]), where stored information is lost if power is removed, although non-volatile RAM has also been developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gallagher|first=Sean|title=Memory that never forgets: non-volatile DIMMs hit the market|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/04/memory-that-never-forgets-non-volatile-dimms-hit-the-market/|publisher=Ars Technica|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170708073138/https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/04/memory-that-never-forgets-non-volatile-dimms-hit-the-market/|archivedate=2017-07-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other types of [[Non-volatile memory|non-volatile memories]] exist that allow random access for read operations, but either do not allow write operations or have other kinds of limitations on them. These include most types of [[read only memory|ROM]] and a type of [[flash memory]] called ''[[flash memory#NOR flash|NOR-Flash]]''.

Integrated-circuit RAM chips came into the market in the early 1970s, with the first commercially available DRAM chip, the [[Intel 1103]], introduced in October 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Mary|last=Bellis|url=http://inventors.about.com/library/weekly/aa100898.htm|title=The Invention of the Intel 1103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultrasonic delay lines could only reproduce data in the order it was written. [[Drum memory]] could be expanded at relatively low cost but efficient retrieval of memory items required knowledge of the physical layout of the drum to optimize speed. Latches built out of [[vacuum tube]] [[triode]]s, and later, out of discrete [[transistor]]s, were used for smaller and faster memories such as registers. Such registers were relatively large and too costly to use for large amounts of data; generally only a few dozen or few hundred bits of such memory could be provided.

The first practical form of random-access memory was the [[Williams tube]] starting in 1947.  It stored data as electrically charged spots on the face of a [[cathode ray tube]]. Since the electron beam of the CRT could read and write the spots on the tube in any order, memory was random access. The capacity of the Williams tube was a few hundred to around a thousand bits, but it was much smaller, faster, and more power-efficient than using individual vacuum tube latches. Developed at the [[Victoria University of Manchester|University of Manchester]] in England, the Williams tube provided the medium on which the first electronically stored program was implemented in the [[Manchester Baby]] computer, which first successfully ran a program on 21 June 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Napper | first = Brian | title = Computer 50: The University of Manchester Celebrates the Birth of the Modern Computer | url = http://www.computer50.org/ | accessdate = 26 May 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120504133240/http://www.computer50.org/ | archivedate = 4 May 2012 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, rather than the Williams tube memory being designed for the Baby, the Baby was a [[testbed]] to demonstrate the reliability of the memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Williams|first1=F.C.|last2=Kilburn|first2=T.|title=Electronic Digital Computers|journal=Nature|volume=162|pages=487|date=Sep 1948|doi=10.1038/162487a0|issue=4117|postscript=.}} Reprinted in ''The Origins of Digital Computers''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Williams|first1=F.C.|last2=Kilburn|first2=T.|last3=Tootill|first3=G.C.|title=Universal High-Speed Digital Computers: A Small-Scale Experimental Machine|url=http://www.computer50.org/kgill/mark1/ssem.html|journal=Proc.

[[Magnetic-core memory]] was invented in 1947 and developed up until the mid-1970s. It became a widespread form of random-access memory, relying on an array of magnetized rings.  By changing the sense of each ring's magnetization, data could be stored with one bit stored per ring. Since every ring had a combination of address wires to select and read or write it, access to any memory location in any sequence was possible.

Magnetic core memory was the standard form of memory system until displaced by solid-state memory in integrated circuits, starting in the early 1970s. [[Dynamic random-access memory]] (DRAM) allowed replacement of a 4 or 6-transistor latch circuit by a single transistor for each memory bit, greatly increasing memory density at the cost of volatility.  Data was stored in the tiny capacitance of each transistor, and had to be periodically refreshed every few milliseconds before the charge could leak away. The [[Toshiba]] Toscal BC-1411 [[electronic calculator]], which was introduced in  1965,&lt;ref&gt;[http://collection.sciencemuseum.org.uk/objects/co8406093/toscal-bc-1411-calculator-with-electronic-calculator Toscal BC-1411 calculator] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729145228/http://collection.sciencemuseum.org.uk/objects/co8406093/toscal-bc-1411-calculator-with-electronic-calculator |date=2017-07-29 }}, [[Science Museum, London]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bc"&gt;[http://www.oldcalculatormuseum.com/toshbc1411.html Toshiba "Toscal" BC-1411 Desktop Calculator] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070520202433/http://www.oldcalculatormuseum.com/toshbc1411.html |date=2007-05-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; used a form of DRAM built from discrete components.&lt;ref name="bc"/&gt; DRAM was then developed by [[Robert H. Dennard]] in 1968.

Prior to the development of integrated [[read-only memory]] (ROM) circuits, ''permanent'' (or ''read-only'') random-access memory was often constructed using [[Diode matrix|diode matrices]] driven by [[address decoder]]s, or specially wound [[core rope memory]] planes. {{Citation needed|reason=This paragraph needs a citation.|date=December 2016}}

The two widely used forms of modern RAM are [[static random access memory|static RAM]] (SRAM) and [[dynamic random-access memory|dynamic RAM]] (DRAM).  In SRAM, a [[Bit|bit of data]] is stored using the state of a six transistor [[Memory cell (computing)|memory cell]]. This form of RAM is more expensive to produce, but is generally faster and requires less dynamic power than DRAM. In modern computers, SRAM is often used as [[CPU cache|cache memory for the CPU]].  DRAM stores a bit of data using a transistor and capacitor pair, which together comprise a DRAM cell.  The capacitor holds a high or low charge (1 or 0, respectively), and the transistor acts as a switch that lets the control circuitry on the chip read the capacitor's state of charge or change it.  As this form of memory is less expensive to produce than static RAM, it is the predominant form of computer memory used in modern computers.

Both static and dynamic RAM are considered ''volatile'', as their state is lost or reset when power is removed from the system.  By contrast, [[read-only memory]] (ROM) stores data by permanently enabling or disabling selected transistors, such that the memory cannot be altered.  Writeable variants of ROM (such as [[EEPROM]] and [[flash memory]]) share properties of both ROM and RAM, enabling data to [[Persistence (computer science)|persist]] without power and to be updated without requiring special equipment.  These persistent forms of semiconductor ROM include [[Universal serial bus|USB]] flash drives, memory cards for cameras and portable devices, and [[solid-state drives]]. 
[[ECC memory]] (which can be either SRAM or DRAM) includes special circuitry to detect and/or correct random faults (memory errors) in the stored data, using [[parity bit]]s or [[Error detection and correction#Error-correcting code|error correction codes]].

In general, the term ''RAM'' refers solely to solid-state memory devices (either DRAM or SRAM), and more specifically the main memory in most computers.  In optical storage, the term [[DVD-RAM]] is somewhat of a misnomer since, unlike [[CD-RW]] or [[DVD-RW]] it does not need to be erased before reuse.  Nevertheless, a DVD-RAM behaves much like a hard disc drive if somewhat slower.

==Memory cell==
{{main|Memory cell (computing)}}
The memory cell is the fundamental building block of [[computer memory]]. The memory cell is an [[electronic circuit]] that stores one [[bit]] of binary information and it must be set to store a logic 1 (high voltage level) and reset to store a logic 0 (low voltage level). Its value is maintained/stored until it is changed by the set/reset process. The value in the memory cell can be accessed by reading it.

In SRAM, the memory cell is a type of [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]] circuit, usually implemented using [[field effect transistor|FET]]s. This means that SRAM requires very low power when not being accessed, but it is expensive and has low storage density.

A second type, DRAM, is based around a capacitor. Charging and discharging this capacitor can store a "1" or a "0" in the cell. However, the charge in this capacitor slowly leaks away, and must be refreshed periodically. Because of this refresh process, DRAM uses more power, but it can achieve greater storage densities and lower unit costs compared to SRAM.

==Addressing==
To be useful, memory cells must be readable and writeable. Within the RAM device, multiplexing and demultiplexing circuitry is used to select memory cells. Typically, a RAM device has a set of address lines A0... An, and for each combination of bits that may be applied to these lines, a set of memory cells are activated. Due to this addressing, RAM devices virtually always have a memory capacity that is a power of two.

Usually several memory cells share the same address. For example, a 4 bit 'wide' RAM chip has 4 memory cells for each address. Often the width of the memory and that of the microprocessor are different, for a 32 bit microprocessor, eight 4 bit RAM chips would be needed.

Often more addresses are needed than can be provided by a device. In that case, external multiplexors to the device are used to activate the correct device that is being accessed.

==Memory hierarchy==
{{main|Memory hierarchy}}
One can read and over-write data in RAM. Many computer systems have a memory hierarchy consisting of [[processor register]]s, on-die [[Static random-access memory|SRAM]] caches, external [[CPU cache|caches]], [[DRAM]], [[paging]] systems and [[virtual memory]] or [[swap space]] on a hard drive. This entire pool of memory may be referred to as "RAM" by many developers, even though the various subsystems can have very different [[access time]]s, violating the original concept behind the ''random access'' term in RAM. Even within a hierarchy level such as DRAM, the specific row, column, bank, [[Memory rank|rank]], channel, or [[interleaved memory|interleave]] organization of the components make the access time variable, although not to the extent that access time to rotating [[storage media]] or a tape is variable. The overall goal of using a memory hierarchy is to obtain the highest possible average access performance while minimizing the total cost of the entire memory system (generally, the memory hierarchy follows the access time with the fast CPU registers at the top and the slow hard drive at the bottom).

In many modern personal computers, the RAM comes in an easily upgraded form of modules called [[DIMM|memory module]]s or DRAM modules about the size of a few sticks of chewing gum. These can quickly be replaced should they become damaged or when changing needs demand more storage capacity. As suggested above, smaller amounts of RAM (mostly SRAM) are also integrated in the [[CPU]] and other [[Integrated circuit|ICs]] on the [[motherboard]], as well as in hard-drives, [[CD-ROM]]s, and several other parts of the computer system.

==Other uses of RAM==
[[File:Samsung-1GB-DDR2-Laptop-RAM.jpg|thumb|right|A stick of laptop RAM, roughly half the size of desktop RAM.]]
In addition to serving as temporary storage and working space for the operating system and applications, RAM is used in numerous other ways.

===Virtual memory===
{{main|Virtual memory}}
Most modern operating systems employ a method of extending RAM capacity, known as "virtual memory".  A portion of the computer's [[hard drive]] is set aside for a ''paging file'' or a ''scratch partition'', and the combination of physical RAM and the paging file form the system's total memory.  (For example, if a computer has 2 GB of RAM and a 1 GB page file, the operating system has 3 GB total memory available to it.)  When the system runs low on physical memory, it can "[[paging|swap]]" portions of RAM to the paging file to make room for new data, as well as to read previously swapped information back into RAM.  Excessive use of this mechanism results in [[thrashing (computer science)|thrashing]] and generally hampers overall system performance, mainly because hard drives are far slower than RAM.

===RAM disk===
{{main|RAM drive}}
Software can "partition" a portion of a computer's RAM, allowing it to act as a much faster hard drive that is called a [[RAM disk]]. A RAM disk loses the stored data when the computer is shut down, unless memory is arranged to have a standby battery source.

===Shadow RAM===
Sometimes, the contents of a relatively slow ROM chip are copied to read/write memory to allow for shorter access times. The ROM chip is then disabled while the initialized memory locations are switched in on the same block of addresses (often write-protected). This process, sometimes called ''shadowing'', is fairly common in both computers and [[embedded systems]].

As a common example, the [[BIOS]] in typical personal computers often has an option called “use shadow BIOS” or similar. When enabled, functions that rely on data from the BIOS’s ROM instead use DRAM locations (most can also toggle shadowing of video card ROM or other ROM sections). Depending on the system, this may not result in increased performance, and may cause incompatibilities.  For example, some hardware may be inaccessible to the [[operating system]] if shadow RAM is used. On some systems the benefit may be hypothetical because the BIOS is not used after booting in favor of direct hardware access. Free memory is reduced by the size of the shadowed ROMs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hardwarehell.com/articles/shadowram.htm|title=Shadow Ram|accessdate=2007-07-24|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061029162135/http://hardwarehell.com/articles/shadowram.htm|archivedate=2006-10-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''

==Recent developments==
Several new types of [[NVRAM|''non-volatile'' RAM]], which preserve data while powered down, are under development. The technologies used include [[carbon nanotube]]s and approaches utilizing [[Tunnel magnetoresistance]]. Amongst the 1st generation [[Magnetoresistive random-access memory|MRAM]], a 128 [[Kibibyte|KiB]] ({{nowrap|128 × 2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;}} bytes) chip was manufactured with 0.18&amp;nbsp;µm technology in the summer of 2003.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} In June 2004, [[Infineon Technologies]] unveiled a 16&amp;nbsp;[[Mebibyte|MiB]] (16&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; bytes) prototype again based on 0.18&amp;nbsp;µm technology. There are two 2nd generation techniques currently in development: [[thermal-assisted switching]] (TAS)&lt;ref&gt;The Emergence of Practical MRAM {{cite web |url=http://www.crocus-technology.com/pdf/BH%20GSA%20Article.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427022729/http://www.crocus-technology.com/pdf/BH%20GSA%20Article.pdf |archivedate=2011-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is being developed by [[Crocus Technology]], and [[spin-transfer torque]] (STT) on which [[Crocus Technology|Crocus]], [[Hynix]], [[IBM]], and several other companies are working.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eetimes.com/news/latest/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=218000269|title=Tower invests in Crocus, tips MRAM foundry deal|work=EETimes|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119111746/http://www.eetimes.com/news/latest/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=218000269|archivedate=2012-01-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nantero]] built a functioning carbon nanotube memory prototype 10&amp;nbsp;[[Gibibyte|GiB]] (10&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; bytes) array in 2004. Whether some of these technologies can eventually take significant market share from either DRAM, SRAM, or flash-memory technology, however, remains to be seen.

Since 2006, "[[solid-state drive]]s" (based on flash memory) with capacities exceeding 256 gigabytes and performance far exceeding traditional disks have become available. This development has started to blur the definition between traditional random-access memory and "disks", dramatically reducing the difference in performance.

Some kinds of random-access memory, such as "EcoRAM", are specifically designed for [[server farm]]s, where [[low-power electronics|low power consumption]] is more important than speed.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://blogs.zdnet.com/green/?p=1165 "EcoRAM held up as less power-hungry option than DRAM for server farms"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080630005455/http://blogs.zdnet.com/green/?p=1165 |date=2008-06-30 }}

==Memory wall==
The "memory wall" is the growing disparity of speed between CPU and memory outside the CPU chip.  An important reason for this disparity is the limited communication bandwidth beyond chip boundaries, which is also referred to as ''bandwidth wall''. From 1986 to 2000, [[Central processing unit|CPU]] speed improved at an annual rate of 55% while memory speed only improved at 10%. Given these trends, it was expected that memory latency would become an overwhelming [[bottleneck (engineering)|bottleneck]] in computer performance.&lt;ref&gt;The term was coined in {{cite web |url=http://www.eecs.ucf.edu/~lboloni/Teaching/EEL5708_2006/slides/wulf94.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406111104/http://www.eecs.ucf.edu/~lboloni/Teaching/EEL5708_2006/slides/wulf94.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-06 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

CPU speed improvements slowed significantly partly due to major physical barriers and partly because current CPU designs have already hit the memory wall in some sense.  [[Intel Corporation|Intel]] summarized these causes in a 2005 document.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Platform 2015: Intel® Processor and Platform Evolution for the Next Decade |date= March 2, 2005 |url= http://epic.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/pub/Home/TrendsAndConceptsII2010/HW_Trends_borkar_2015.pdf |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110427072037/http://epic.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/pub/Home/TrendsAndConceptsII2010/HW_Trends_borkar_2015.pdf |archivedate= April 27, 2011 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;First of all, as chip geometries shrink and clock frequencies rise, the transistor [[Leakage (electronics)|leakage current]] increases, leading to excess power consumption and heat... Secondly, the advantages of higher clock speeds are in part negated by memory latency, since memory access times have not been able to keep pace with increasing clock frequencies. Third, for certain applications, traditional serial architectures are becoming less efficient as processors get faster (due to the so-called [[Von Neumann architecture#Von Neumann bottleneck|Von Neumann bottleneck]]), further undercutting any gains that frequency increases might otherwise buy. In addition, partly due to limitations in the means of producing inductance within solid state devices, [[resistance-capacitance]] (RC) delays in signal transmission are growing as feature sizes shrink, imposing an additional bottleneck that frequency increases don't address.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The RC delays in signal transmission were also noted in "Clock Rate versus IPC: The End of the Road for Conventional Microarchitectures"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference |first1=Vikas |last1=Agarwal |first2=M. S. |last2=Hrishikesh |first3=Stephen W. |last3=Keckler |first4=Doug |last4=Burger |title=Clock Rate versus IPC: The End of the Road for Conventional Microarchitectures |url=http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/cart/trips/publications/isca00.pdf |conference=27th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture |conference-url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=339647 |book-title=Proceedings of the 27th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture |location=Vancouver, BC |date=June 10–14, 2000 |access-date=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which projected a maximum of 12.5% average annual CPU performance improvement between 2000 and 2014.

A different concept is the processor-memory performance gap, which can be addressed by [[Three-dimensional integrated circuit|3D integrated circuits]] that reduce the distance between the logic and memory aspects that are further apart in a 2D chip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=790 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1PgYS7zDCM8C&amp;pg=PA790&amp;dq=processor-memory+performance+gap&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jeM5U93YAqTr2QWc74A4&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=processor-memory%20performance%20gap&amp;f=false |accessdate=March 31, 2014 |title=Nanoelectronics and Information Technology |author=[[Rainer Waser]] |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801114150/https://books.google.com/books?id=1PgYS7zDCM8C&amp;pg=PA790&amp;dq=processor-memory+performance+gap&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jeM5U93YAqTr2QWc74A4&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=processor-memory%20performance%20gap&amp;f=false |archivedate=August 1, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Memory subsystem design requires a focus on the gap, which is widening over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0IY7LW5J4JgC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=processor-memory+performance+gap&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jeM5U93YAqTr2QWc74A4&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=processor-memory%20performance%20gap&amp;f=false |page=109 |accessdate=March 31, 2014 |title=Advances in Computer Systems Architecture: 11th Asia-Pacific Conference, ACSAC 2006, Shanghai, China, September 6-8, 2006, Proceedings |author=Chris Jesshope and Colin Egan |publisher=Springer |date=2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801135254/https://books.google.com/books?id=0IY7LW5J4JgC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=processor-memory+performance+gap&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jeM5U93YAqTr2QWc74A4&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=processor-memory%20performance%20gap&amp;f=false |archivedate=August 1, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main method of bridging the gap is the use of [[Cache (computing)|caches]]; small amounts of high-speed memory that houses recent operations and instructions nearby the processor, speeding up the execution of those operations or instructions in cases where they are called upon frequently. Multiple levels of caching have been developed to deal with the widening gap, and the performance of high-speed modern computers relies on evolving caching techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7i9Z69lrYBoC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;dq=processor-memory+performance+gap&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jeM5U93YAqTr2QWc74A4&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=processor-memory%20performance%20gap&amp;f=false |pages=90–91 |accessdate=March 31, 2014 |title=Multiprocessor Systems-on-chips |author=Ahmed Amine Jerraya and Wayne Wolf |publisher=Morgan Kaufmann |year=2005 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801105357/https://books.google.com/books?id=7i9Z69lrYBoC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;dq=processor-memory+performance+gap&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jeM5U93YAqTr2QWc74A4&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=processor-memory%20performance%20gap&amp;f=false |archivedate=August 1, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These can prevent the loss of processor performance, as it takes less time to perform the computation it has been initiated to complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vw4zrPuyKu0C&amp;pg=PA110&amp;dq=processor-memory+performance+gap&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=r-M5U86-NaeC2QXiroHgCA&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=processor-memory%20performance%20gap&amp;f=false |page=110 |accessdate=March 31, 2014 |title=Impact of Advances in Computing and Communications Technologies on Chemical Science and Technology |year=1999 |publisher=National Academy Press |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801135027/https://books.google.com/books?id=vw4zrPuyKu0C&amp;pg=PA110&amp;dq=processor-memory+performance+gap&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=r-M5U86-NaeC2QXiroHgCA&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=processor-memory%20performance%20gap&amp;f=false |archivedate=August 1, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There can be up to a 53% difference between the growth in speed of processor speeds and the lagging speed of main memory access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f0pJYJQMlmoC&amp;pg=PA529&amp;dq=processor-memory+performance+gap&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1eM5U7veEaTx2QXM2oDYCw&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwADgU#v=onepage&amp;q=processor-memory%20performance%20gap&amp;f=false |page=529 |accessdate=March 31, 2014 |title=Experimental and Efficient Algorithms: Third International Workshop, WEA 2004, Angra Dos Reis, Brazil, May 25-28, 2004, Proceedings, Volume 3 |author=Celso C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1490">In [[theoretical computer science]] and [[formal language theory]], a '''ranked alphabet''' is a pair of an [[Alphabet (computer science)|ordinary alphabet]] ''F'' and a function ''Arity'': ''F''→ℕ. Each letter in ''F'' has its [[arity]] so it can be used to build [[Term (logic)|terms]]. Nullary elements (of zero arity) are also called '''constants'''. Terms built with unary symbols and constants can be considered as [[string (computer science)|strings]]. Higher arities lead to proper [[Tree (automata theory)|trees]].

For instance, in the term 
:&lt;math&gt;f(a,g(a),f(a,b,c))&lt;/math&gt;,
''a,b,c'' are constants, ''g'' is unary, and ''f'' is ternary.

Contrariwise,  
:&lt;math&gt;f(a,f(a))&lt;/math&gt;
cannot be a valid term, as the symbol ''f'' appears once as binary, and once as unary, which is illicit, as ''Arity'' must be a function.

In [[mathematical optimization]], the '''Rosenbrock function''' is a non-[[convex function]], introduced by [[Howard Harry Rosenbrock|Howard H. Rosenbrock]] in 1960, which is used as a [[Test functions for optimization|performance test problem]] for optimization [[algorithm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosenbrock|first=H.H.|title=An automatic method for finding the greatest or least value of a function|journal=The Computer Journal|year=1960|volume=3|issue=3|pages=175–184|doi=10.1093/comjnl/3.3.175| issn=0010-4620 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known as '''Rosenbrock's valley''' or '''Rosenbrock's banana function'''.

The global minimum is inside a long, narrow, [[parabola|parabolic]] shaped flat valley. To find the valley is trivial. To converge to the global [[minimum]], however, is difficult.

The function is defined by

&lt;math&gt;f(x, y) = (a-x)^2 + b(y-x^2)^2&lt;/math&gt;

It has a global minimum at &lt;math&gt;(x, y)=(a, a^2)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;f(x, y)=0&lt;/math&gt;. Usually these parameters are set such that &lt;math&gt;a = 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b = 100&lt;/math&gt;. Only in the trivial case where &lt;math&gt;a=0&lt;/math&gt; is the function symmetric and the minimum at the origin.

==Multidimensional generalisations==

Two variants are commonly encountered.  

[[File:Rosenbrock3.gif|thumb|300px|Animation of Rosenbrock's function of three variables. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Simionescu|first=P.A.|title=Computer Aided Graphing and Simulation Tools for AutoCAD users|year=2014|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, FL|isbn=978-1-4822-5290-3|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

One is the sum of &lt;math&gt;N/2&lt;/math&gt; uncoupled 2D Rosenbrock problems, and is defined only for even &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;s:
: &lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{x}) = f(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_N) = \sum_{i=1}^{N/2} \left[100(x_{2i-1}^2 - x_{2i})^2
+ (x_{2i-1} - 1)^2 \right].&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=L. C. W. |last=Dixon |first2=D. J. |last2=Mills |title=Effect of Rounding Errors on the Variable Metric Method |journal=Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications |volume=80 |issue= |year=1994 |url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=179711 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This variant has predictably simple solutions.

A second, more involved variant is
: &lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{i=1}^{N-1} [100 (x_{i+1} - x_i^2 )^2 + (1-x_i)^2] \quad \mbox{where} \quad \mathbf{x} = [x_1, \ldots, x_N] \in \mathbb{R}^N.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/tutorial/optimize.html#unconstrained-minimization-of-multivariate-scalar-functions-minimize|title = Generalized Rosenbrock's function|accessdate = 2008-09-16|work = |publisher = |date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

has exactly one minimum for &lt;math&gt;N=3&lt;/math&gt; (at &lt;math&gt;(1, 1, 1)&lt;/math&gt;) and exactly two minima for &lt;math&gt;4 \le N \le 7&lt;/math&gt;—the global minimum of all ones and a local minimum near &lt;math&gt;(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_N) = (-1, 1, \dots, 1)&lt;/math&gt;.  This result is obtained by setting the gradient of the function equal to zero, noticing that the resulting equation is a rational function of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.  For small &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; the polynomials can be determined exactly and [[Sturm's theorem]] can be used to determine the number of real roots, while the roots can be [[Fundamental theorem of algebra#Bounds on the zeroes of a polynomial|bounded]] in the region of &lt;math&gt;|x_i| &lt; 2.4&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="kok2009"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Schalk |last=Kok |first2=Carl |last2=Sandrock |title=Locating and Characterizing the Stationary Points of the Extended Rosenbrock Function |journal=Evolutionary Computation |volume=17 |issue= 3|pages=437 |year=2009 |doi=10.1162/evco.2009.17.3.437 |pmid=19708775 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For larger &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; this method breaks down due to the size of the coefficients involved.

==Stationary points==

Many of the stationary points of the function exhibit a regular pattern when plotted.&lt;ref name="kok2009"/&gt;  This structure can be exploited to locate them.

==Optimization examples==
[[File:Rosenbrock.png|thumb|left|200px]]

[[File:Nelder-Mead Rosenbrock.gif|thumb|200px|text-top|left|alt=Rosenbrock function Nelder-Mead|Nelder-Mead method applied to the Rosenbrock function]]

The Rosenbrock function can be efficiently optimized by adapting appropriate coordinate system without using any [[gradient descent|gradient information]] and without building local approximation models (in contrast to many derivate-free optimizers). The following figure illustrates an example of 2-dimensional Rosenbrock function optimization by
[[adaptive coordinate descent]] from starting point &lt;math&gt;x_0=(-3,-4)&lt;/math&gt;. The solution with the function value &lt;math&gt;10^{-10}&lt;/math&gt; can be found after 325 function evaluations.

Using the [[Nelder–Mead method]] from starting point &lt;math&gt;x_0=(-1,1)&lt;/math&gt; with a regular initial simplex a minimum is found with function value &lt;math&gt;1.36 \cdot 10^{-10}&lt;/math&gt; after 185 function evaluations. The figure below visualizes the evolution of the algorithm.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11212">'''Strategic environmental assessment''' ('''SEA''') is a systematic [[decision support]] process, aiming to ensure that environmental and possibly other sustainability aspects are considered effectively in policy, plan and program making. In this context, following Fischer (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, T. B. (2007). Theory and Practice of Strategic Environmental Assessment, Earthscan, London.&lt;/ref&gt; SEA may be seen as:

*a structured, rigorous, participative, open and transparent [[environmental impact]] assessment (EIA) based process, applied particularly to plans and programmes, prepared by public planning [[authorities]] and at times private bodies,
*a participative, open and transparent, possibly non-EIA-based process, applied in a more flexible manner to policies, prepared by public planning authorities and at times private bodies,&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed, Kulsum; Sánchez-Triana, Ernesto. 2008. Strategic Environmental Assessment for Policies : An Instrument for Good Governance. © Washington, DC : World Bank. https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/6461&lt;/ref&gt;
*a flexible non-EIA based process, applied to legislative proposals and other policies, plans and programmes in political/cabinet decision-making.

Effective SEA works within a structured and tiered decision framework, aiming to support more effective and efficient decision-making for sustainable development and improved governance by providing for a substantive focus regarding questions, issues and alternatives to be considered in policy, plan and programme (PPP) making.

SEA is an [[evidence-based]] instrument, aiming to add scientific rigour to PPP making, by using suitable assessment methods and techniques. Ahmed and Sanchez Triana (2008) developed an approach to the design and implementation of public policies that follows a continuous process rather than as a discrete intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed, Kulsum; Sánchez-Triana, Ernesto. 2008. Strategic Environmental Assessment for Policies : An Instrument for Good Governance. © Washington, DC : World Bank. https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/6461&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[European Union Directive on Environmental Impact Assessments]] (85/337/EEC, known as the ''[[Environmental impact assessment|EIA]] Directive'') only applied to certain projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31985L0337:EN:HTML Council Directive 85/337/EEC on the Assessment of the Effects of Certain Public and Private Projects on the Environment] (1985-06-27) from [http://eur-lex.europa.eu Eur-Lex]&lt;/ref&gt; This was seen as deficient as it only dealt with specific effects at the local level whereas many environmentally damaging decisions had already been made at a more strategic level (for example the fact that new infrastructure may generate an increased demand for travel).

The concept of strategic assessments originated from regional development / land use planning in the developed world. In 1981 the ''U.S. Housing and Urban Development Department'' published the ''Area-wide Impact Assessment Guidebook''. In Europe the  ''[[Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context]]'' the so-called ''[[Espoo]] Convention'' laid the foundations for the introduction of SEA in 1991. In 2003, the Espoo Convention was supplemented by a [[Protocol on Strategic Environmental Assessment]].

The [[European SEA Directive 2001/42/EC]] required that all member states of the [[European Union]] should have ratified the Directive into their own country's law by 21 July 2004.&lt;ref name=Directive&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001L0042:EN:HTML Directive 2001/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council] (2001-06-27) from [http://eur-lex.europa.eu Eur-Lex]&lt;/ref&gt;

Countries of the EU started implementing the land use aspects of SEA first, some took longer to adopt the directive than others, but the implementation of the directive can now be seen as completed. Many EU nations have a longer history of strong Environmental Appraisal including [[Denmark]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Finland]] and [[Sweden]]. The newer member states to the EU have hurried in implementing the directive.

==Relationship with environmental impact assessment==
For the most part, an SEA is conducted before a corresponding EIA is undertaken. This means that information on the environmental impact of a plan can cascade down through the tiers of decision making and can be used in an EIA at a later stage. This should reduce the amount of work that needs to be undertaken. A handover procedure is foreseen.

==Aims and structure==
The SEA Directive only applies to plans and programmes, not policies, although policies within plans are likely to be assessed and SEA can be applied to policies if needed and in the UK certainly, very often is.

The structure of SEA (under the Directive) is based on the following phases:
* "Screening", investigation of whether the plan or programme falls under the SEA legislation,
* "Scoping", defining the boundaries of investigation, assessment and assumptions required,
* "Documentation of the state of the environment", effectively a ''baseline'' on which to base judgments,
* "Determination of the likely (non-marginal) environmental impacts", usually in terms of Direction of Change rather than firm figures,
* Informing and consulting the public,
* Influencing "Decision taking" based on the assessment and,
* Monitoring of the effects of plans and programmes after their implementation.

The EU directive also includes other impacts besides the environmental, such as material assets and archaeological sites. In most western European states this has been broadened further to include economic and social aspects of [[sustainability]].

SEA should ensure that plans and programmes take into consideration the environmental effects they cause. If those environmental effects are part of the overall decision taking it is called ''Strategic Impact Assessment''.

==In the European Union==
SEA is a legally enforced assessment procedure required by Directive 2001/42/EC (known as the SEA Directive).&lt;ref name=Directive/&gt; The SEA Directive aims at introducing systematic assessment of the environmental effects of strategic land use related plans and programs. It typically applies to regional and local, development, waste and transport plans, within the European Union. Some plans, such as finance and budget plans or civil defence plans are exempt from the SEA Directive, it also only applies to plans that are required by law, which excludes national government's plans and programs, as their plans are 'voluntary', whereas local and regional governments are usually required to prepare theirs.

===United Kingdom===
SEA within the UK is complicated by different Regulations, guidance and practice between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In particular the SEA Legislation in Scotland (and in Northern Ireland, which specifically refers to the Regional Development Strategy) contains an expectation that SEA will apply to strategies as well as plans and programmes. In the UK, SEA is inseparable from the term '[[sustainability]]', and an SEA is expected to be carried out as part of a wider [[Sustainability Appraisal]] (SA), which was already a requirement for many types of plan before the SEA directive and includes social, and economic factors in addition to environmental. Essentially an SA is intended to better inform decision makers on the sustainability aspects of the plan and ensure the full impact of the plan on sustainability is understood.

The United Kingdom in its strategy for sustainable development, ''A Better Quality of Life'' (May 1999), explained sustainable development in terms of four objectives. These are:

*social progress which recognises the needs of everyone
*effective protection of the environment
*prudent use of natural resources
*maintenance of high and stable levels of economic growth and employment.

These headline objectives are usually used and applied to local situations in order to assess the impact of the plan or program.

==Internationally==

===The pan-European region===
The [[Protocol on Strategic Environmental Assessment]] was negotiated by the member States of the [[UNECE]] (in this instance Europe, Caucasus and Central Asia). It required ratification by 16 States to come into force, which it did in July 2010. It is now open to all [[UN]] Member States. Besides its potentially broader geographical application (global), the Protocol differs from the corresponding European Union Directive in its non-mandatory application to policies and legislation – not just plans and programmes. The Protocol also places a strong emphasis on the consideration of health, and there are other more subtle differences between the two instruments.

===New Zealand===
SEA in New Zealand is part of an integrated planning and assessment process and unlike the US is not used in the manner of [[Environmental impact assessment]].  The [[Resource Management Act 1991]] has, as a principal objective, the aim of sustainable management. SEA is increasingly being considered for transportation projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfe.govt.nz/publications/rma/roading-delays-feb03.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
===The OECD DAC – SEA in development co-operation===
[[Development assistance]] is increasingly being provided through strategic-level interventions, aimed to make aid more effective. SEA meets the need to ensure environmental considerations are taken into account in this new aid context. Applying SEA to development co-operation provides the environmental evidence to support more informed decision making, and to identify new opportunities by encouraging a systematic and thorough examination of development options.

The [[OECD]] [[Development Assistance Committee]] (DAC) Task Team on SEA has developed [http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/4/21/37353858.pdf guidance] on how to apply SEA to development co-operation. The document explains the benefits of using SEA in development co-operation and sets out key steps for its application, based on recent experiences.

'''Tricarbon''' (systematically named '''1λ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,3λ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-propadiene''' and '''''catena''-tricarbon''') is an [[inorganic compound]] with the [[chemical formula]] {{Chem|C|2|(μ-C)}} (also written [C(μ-C)C] or {{Chem|C|3}}). It is a colourless gas that only persists in dilution or solution as an [[adduct]]. It is one of the simplest [[saturated and unsaturated compounds|unsaturated]] [[carbene]]s.

It is a small [[carbon]] cluster first [[spectroscopy|spectroscopically]] observed in the beginning 20th century in the tail of a comet by [[William Huggins]] and subsequently identified in [[stellar atmosphere]]s. Tricarbon can be found in interstellar space and can be produced in the laboratory by a process called [[laser ablation]]. Small carbon clusters like tricarbon and [[dicarbon]] are regarded as soot precursors and are implicated in the formation of certain industrial [[diamond]]s and in the formation of [[fullerene]]s. The ground state [[molecular geometry]] of tricarbon has been identified as linear via its characteristic symmetric and antisymmetric stretching and bending vibrational modes and bears [[bond length]]s of 129 to 130 [[picometer]] corresponding to those of [[alkene]]s. The [[ionization potential]] is determined experimentally at 11 to 13.5 [[electronvolt]]s.&lt;ref name="Nicolas"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Nicolas | first = Christophe | display-authors=etal  | date = 2006 | title = Vacuum Ultraviolet Photoionization of C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; | journal = [[Journal of the American Chemical Society|J.

Soc.]] | volume = 128 | issue = 1 | pages = 220–226 | doi = 10.1021/ja055430+ | pmid = 16390150 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the linear tricarbon molecule the '''C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; [[cation]] is bent.

C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has also been identified as a transient species in various [[combustion]] reactions.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

The generation of C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; was investigated by Professor Emeritus [[Philip Skell|Philip S. Skell]] of [[Pennsylvania State University]] in the 1960s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

== Nomenclature ==

The systematic names ''1λ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,3λ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-propadiene'', and ''μ-carbidodicarbon'', valid [[IUPAC]] names, are constructed according to the substitutive and additive nomenclatures, respectively.

In appropriate contexts, tricarbon can be viewed as [[propadiene]] with four hydrogen atoms removed, or as propane with eight electrons removed; and as such, ''propadienediylidene'' or ''propanetetraylidene'', respectively, may be used as a context-specific systematic names, according to substitutive nomenclature. By default, these names pay no regard to the radicality of the tricarbon molecule. In even more specific context, these can also name the non-radical singlet state, whereas the diradical state is named ''propadienediylylidene'', or ''propanediyldiylidene'', and the tetraradical state is named ''propedienetetrayl'' or ''propanetetraylylidene''.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

The '''Van Leer Jerusalem Institute''' (VLJI) is a center for the interdisciplinary study and discussion of issues related to philosophy, society, culture, and education. The Institute was established in order to create a body of knowledge and discourse which gives expression to the wide range of disciplines and opinions in Israel. The contribution of a core of renowned scholars facilitates the implementation of reforms and new approaches in various social spheres.

The Institute is located in Jerusalem's [[Talbiya]] neighborhood, next door to the official residence of the [[President of Israel]]. Its campus also houses the [[Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities]] and the [[Council for Higher Education in Israel|Council for Higher Education]].

According to Daniel Gutwein it used to popularize [[post-Zionist]] ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Left and right post‐Zionism and the privatization of Israeli collective memory Left and right post‐Zionism and the privatization of Israeli collective memory | author=Daniel Gutwein | doi=10.1080/13531040108576157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Van Leer Institute was established in 1959 by the [[Lia Van Leer|Van Leer]] family of the [[Netherlands]]. The stated goals of the institute are to "advance knowledge in the realms of philosophy, society, and culture", to enhance ethnic and cultural understanding, ease social tensions and promote democratic values through academic research, public policy analysis, advocacy and civil society projects. The institute organizes domestic and international conferences, symposia and workshops, and publishes books and periodicals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vanleer.org.il/heb/content.asp?id=6 About the Van Leer Institute], Israel.&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Leer organizes domestic and international conferences, symposia and workshops, publishes periodicals, books and monographs, and promotes pluralistic public dialogue. It houses a 27,000-volume library devoted to philosophy, philosophy of science, historical sociology and political theory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vanleer.org.il/eng/content.asp?id=27 Van Leer website]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105062118/http://www.vanleer.org.il/eng/content.asp?id=27 |date=January 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ofira Seliktar, a scholar specializing in anti-Israeli activities of Israeli scholars, it was used to give a measure of respectability to Post-Zionist scholars.&lt;ref name="Radicals" /&gt;

== Activities ==
The Institute is active in four main areas: Advanced Studies, Jewish Culture and Thinking, Israeli Civil Society, and Mediterranean Neighbours. A variety of methods and approaches are employed in each of these areas with projects, discussion groups, and collaborations with academic institutions, civil society organizations, and government bodies. Activities include conducting studies of public policy and applied social research, developing and running educational programs as well as training programs for educators and community leaders, hosting cultural activities for the general public, and publishing books, anthologies, and journals. The Institute cooperates with a large number of Israeli and international research institutions and conducts joint projects with visiting scholars from around the world. The campus houses two libraries and a variety of different sized halls which host conferences and events.

=== Advanced Studies ===
The Advanced Studies Unit is headed by Dr. Yochi Fischer and is committed to multidisciplinary and comparative research in the fields of humanities and social sciences.

Activities include research groups, workshops, international conferences, and a summer seminar with participants comprising senior scholars in Israel, their international colleagues, and young scholars and intellectuals.

The unit focuses on issues of religion, secularism, and democracy; equality, pluralism, and racism; the state of higher education, especially in the humanities; and issues of history, memory, and reconciliation from a comparative and interdisciplinary perspective.

=== The Polonsky Academy for Advanced Study in the Humanities and Social Sciences ===
The Polonsky Academy, spearheaded by Dr. [[Leonard Polonsky]] and inaugurated in 2014, is an international center for humanities and social sciences that supports young international and Israeli scholars. The Polonsky Program provides these scholars with facilities and full financial support for up to five years to enable them to further their research and better prepare them for their future academic careers.

=== Mediterranean Neighbours ===
VLJI has established the academic discipline of Mediterranean studies which focuses on the study of cultures and societies of countries in the region. This decision was based, inter alia, on the 1995 Barcelona Declaration and on the establishment of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership which redefined the idea of the Mediterranean and cooperation in the Mediterranean basin as an economic, political, and cultural plan of action.

The Mediterranean Neighbours Unit, is headed by Dr. Abigail Jacobson. It was established to promote the study of the region, to influence the way in which the region is portrayed and understood, and to encourage understanding and dialogue between Israelis and their neighbours. Israeli and Palestinian scholars lead pioneering studies and cross-border projects including academic discussion groups, workshops, conferences, and publications.

Specific areas of activity include research, the Journal of Levantine Studies, regional dialogue, and involvement in the Anna Lindh Foundation.

=== Manarat: The Van Leer Center for Jewish-Arab Relations ===
The Manarat Center, headed by Dr. Yonatan Mendel, was established in 2015 to highlight a variety of issues, including the status and rights of Palestinian citizens of Israel, the ramifications of the protracted Israeli-Arab conflict for both Jewish and Arab societies, and Israel’s place in the Middle East. The center is involved in research and discourse regarding the challenges facing Israeli and Palestinian society in an attempt to discover the methods and principles likely to promote understanding, a shared life, mutual respect, reconciliation, justice, and peace. The Manarat Center, aims to promote partnerships between Jewish and Arab organizations.

=== Jewish Culture and Thinking ===
VLJI's Jewish Culture and Thinking Program is headed by Prof. Amnon Raz-Krakotzkin and promotes interdisciplinary research and public events concerning Jewish culture and thought in Israel and the Diaspora. The programs focus on the identity of communities, the streams and phenomena of contemporary Judaism, Judaism and democracy, and expressions of Jewish culture, thought, and creativity. The Jewish Culture and Thinking Program is a home for both established and young scholars in the humanities and social sciences, as well as thinkers, rabbis, and educators from Israel and abroad.

=== Israeli Civil Society ===
The Israeli Civil Society Unit, headed by Prof. Moshe Justman, focuses on creating a body of knowledge on citizenship and civic policy to be incorporated in public discourse and used by decision-makers. Projects — including research groups, discussion groups, round-tables on key current issues relating to social change, local and international conferences, and public symposiums — are thematically clustered around the basic issues of citizenship, social justice, relations between the state and civil society, Arab society in Israel, gender, economics, and education.

=== Public events ===
VLJI hosts an array of public events comprising conferences, workshops, colloquia, symposia, and other public meetings. The wide range of participants include intellectuals from Israeli and international academia and from the worlds of journalism, public policy, and politics.

A '''variable-frequency drive''' ('''VFD'''; also termed ''adjustable-frequency drive'', “variable-voltage/variable-frequency (VVVF) drive”, ''variable speed drive'', ''AC drive'', ''micro drive'' or ''[[inverter (electrical)|inverter]] drive'') is a type of [[adjustable-speed drive]] used in [[electro-mechanical]] drive systems to control [[AC motor]] [[speed]] and [[torque]] by varying motor input [[frequency]] and [[voltage]].&lt;ref name=Campbell&gt;{{cite book | first=Sylvester J. | last=Campbell | authorlink= | year=1987 | title=Solid-State AC Motor Controls | edition= | publisher=Marcel Dekker, Inc. | location=New York | isbn=0-8247-7728-X | pages= 79–189 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jaeschke&gt;{{cite book | first=Ralph L. | last=Jaeschke | authorlink= | year=1978 | title=Controlling Power Transmission Systems | edition= | publisher=Penton/IPC | location=Cleveland, OH | id= |pages=210–215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Siskind&gt;{{cite book | first=Charles S. | last=Siskind | authorlink= | year=1963 | title=Electrical Control Systems in Industry | edition= | publisher=McGraw-Hill, Inc. | location=New York | isbn= 0-07-057746-3 | page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NEMA-Guide&gt;{{cite book | last=NEMA Standards Publication | title=Application Guide for AC Adjustable Speed Drive Systems | year=2007 | url=http://www.nema.org/stds/acadjustable.cfm | accessdate=Mar 27, 2008 | publisher=National Electrical Manufacturers Association (now The Association of Electrical Equipment and Medical Imaging Manufacturers) | location=Rosslyn, VA USA | page=4 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080428091020/http://www.nema.org/stds/acadjustable.cfm | archive-date=April 28, 2008 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

VFDs are used in applications ranging from small appliances to large compressors. About 25% of the world's electrical energy is consumed by electric motors in industrial applications, which can be more efficient when using VFDs in centrifugal load service;&lt;ref name="ABB-energy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy efficiency makes a difference|url=http://www02.abb.com/db/db0003/db002698.nsf/0/a3881ed5c3dbc647c12575080036dafd/$file/energy_efficiency_makes_difference_191108.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, VFDs' global [[market penetration]] for all applications is relatively small. 
	
Over the last four decades, [[power electronics]] technology has reduced VFD cost and size and has improved performance through advances in semiconductor switching devices, drive topologies, simulation and control techniques, and control hardware and software.

VFDs are made in a number of different low- and medium-voltage [[AC/AC converter|AC-AC]] and DC-AC topologies.

== System description and operation ==

[[File:VFD System.png|right|thumb|320px|VFD system]]
A variable-frequency drive is a device used in a drive system consisting of the following three main sub-systems:  AC motor, main drive [[controller (control theory)|controller]] assembly, and drive/operator interface.&lt;ref name=Jaeschke/&gt;{{rp|210–211}}&lt;ref name=NEMA-Guide/&gt;

=== AC motor ===
The AC electric motor used in a VFD system is usually [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase]] [[induction motor]]. Some types of [[Single-phase electric power|single-phase]] motors or [[synchronous motor]]s can be advantageous in some situations, but generally three-phase induction motors are preferred as the most economical. Motors that are designed for fixed-speed operation are often used. Elevated-voltage stresses imposed on induction motors that are supplied by VFDs require that such motors be designed for definite-purpose inverter-fed duty in accordance with such requirements as Part 31 of [[National Electrical Manufacturers Association|NEMA]] Standard MG-1.&lt;ref&gt;NEMA Guide, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controller ===
The VFD controller is a [[solid state (electronics)|solid-state]] power electronics conversion system consisting of three distinct sub-systems: a [[rectifier]] bridge converter, a [[direct current]] (DC) link, and an inverter. [[Voltage source|Voltage-source]] inverter (VSI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below) are by far the most common type of drives. Most drives are [[AC/AC Converter|AC-AC]] drives in that they convert AC line input to AC inverter output. However, in some applications such as common DC bus or [[Solar energy|solar]] applications, drives are configured as DC-AC drives. The most basic rectifier converter for the VSI drive is configured as a three-phase, six-pulse, [[Full-wave rectifier|full-wave]] [[diode bridge]]. In a VSI drive, the DC link consists of a [[capacitor]] which smooths out the converter's DC output [[ripple (electrical)|ripple]] and provides a stiff input to the inverter. This filtered DC voltage is converted to quasi-[[sine wave|sinusoidal]] AC voltage output using the inverter's active switching elements. VSI drives provide higher [[power factor]] and lower [[harmonic distortion]] than [[Phase fired controllers|phase-controlled]] [[current source|current-source]] inverter (CSI) and load-commutated inverter (LCI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below). The drive controller can also be configured as a [[phase converter]] having single-phase converter input and three-phase inverter output.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, pp. 79-83&lt;/ref&gt;

Controller advances have exploited dramatic increases in the voltage and current ratings and switching frequency of solid-state power devices over the past six decades. Introduced in 1983,&lt;ref name="Bose (2006)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bose|first=Bimal K.|title=Power Electronics and Motor Drives : Advances and Trends|year=2006|publisher=Academic|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-0-12-088405-6|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[insulated-gate bipolar transistor]] (IGBT) has in the past two decades come to dominate VFDs as an inverter switching device.&lt;ref name=Bartos21st&gt;{{cite journal  | last =Bartos | first =Frank J. | title =AC Drives Stay Vital for the 21st Century | journal =Control Engineering | publisher =Reed Business Information | date =Sep 1, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference  | first =Robert E. | last = Eisenbrown | title = AC Drives, Historical and Future Perspective of Innovation and Growth | booktitle = Keynote Presentation for the 25th Anniversary of The Wisconsin Electric Machines and Power Electronics Consortium (WEMPEC) | pages =6–10 | publisher =WEMPEC | date =May 18, 2008   | location = University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last =Jahn   | first =Thomas M. |author2=Owen, Edward L.  | title =AC Adjustable-Speed Drives at the Millennium: How Did We Get Here? | journal =IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages =17–25 | publisher =IEEE | date =Jan 2001  | doi =10.1109/63.903985 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In variable-[[torque]] applications suited for Volts-per-Hertz (V/Hz) drive control, AC motor characteristics require that the voltage magnitude of the inverter's output to the motor be adjusted to match the required load torque in a [[linearity|linear]] V/Hz relationship. For example, for 460&amp;nbsp;V, 60&amp;nbsp;Hz motors, this linear V/Hz relationship is  460/60 = 7.67&amp;nbsp;V/Hz. While suitable in wide-ranging applications, V/Hz control is sub-optimal in high-performance applications involving low speed or demanding, dynamic speed regulation, positioning, and reversing load requirements. Some V/Hz control drives can also operate in [[quadratic function|quadratic]] V/Hz mode or can even be programmed to suit special multi-point V/Hz paths.&lt;ref name=BasicsACDrive&gt;{{cite web|title=Basics of AC drives|url=http://www3.sea.siemens.com/step/flash/STEPACDrives/index.htm|accessdate=Apr 18, 2012|page=Hardware-Part 2: slide 2 of 9|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419103737/http://www3.sea.siemens.com/step/flash/STEPACDrives/index.htm|archive-date=April 19, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bose (1980)"&gt;{{cite book | first=Bimal K. | last=Bose | authorlink= | year=1980 | title=Adjustable Speed AC Drive Systems | edition= | publisher=IEEE Press | location=New York | isbn=0-87942-146-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two other drive control platforms, [[vector control (motor)|vector control]] and [[direct torque control]] (DTC), adjust the motor voltage magnitude, angle from reference, and frequency&lt;ref name="Yano"&gt;{{cite web|last=Yano|first=Masao|title=History of Power Electronics for Motor Drives in Japan|url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/images/4/49/Yano2.pdf|accessdate=18 April 2012|page=13|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; so as to precisely control the motor's magnetic flux and mechanical torque.

Although [[space vector modulation|space vector]] [[pulse-width modulation]] (SVPWM) is becoming increasingly popular,&lt;ref name="Bose (2011)"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bose|first=Bimal K.|title=Energy Scenario and Impact on Power Electronics In the 21st Century|url=http://www.peia2011.com/downloads/Bose_fullpaper.pdf|booktitle=PEIA 2011 - Workshop on Power Electronics for Industrial Applications and Renewable Energy Conversion|page=12|location=Doha,Qatar|accessdate=Feb 8, 2012|year=2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502212901/http://www.peia2011.com/downloads/Bose_fullpaper.pdf|archive-date=May 2, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; sinusoidal PWM (SPWM) is the most straightforward method used to vary drives' motor voltage (or current) and frequency. With SPWM control (see Fig. 1), quasi-sinusoidal, variable-pulse-width output is constructed from intersections of a saw-toothed [[carrier signal]] with a modulating sinusoidal signal which is variable in operating frequency as well as in voltage (or current).&lt;ref name=Bartos21st/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bose 2006, p. 183"&gt;Bose (2006), p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, pp. 82–85&lt;/ref&gt;

Operation of the motors above rated nameplate speed (base speed) is possible, but is limited to conditions that do not require more power than the nameplate rating of the motor. This is sometimes called "field weakening" and, for AC&amp;nbsp;motors, means operating at less than rated V/Hz and above rated nameplate speed. [[Permanent magnet]] synchronous motors have quite limited field-weakening speed range due to the constant magnet [[flux linkage]]. Wound-rotor synchronous motors and induction motors have much wider speed range. For example, a 100&amp;nbsp;HP, 460&amp;nbsp;V, 60&amp;nbsp;Hz, 1775&amp;nbsp;[[revolutions per minute|RPM]] (4-pole) induction motor supplied with 460&amp;nbsp;V, 75&amp;nbsp;Hz (6.134&amp;nbsp;V/Hz), would be limited to 60/75 = 80% torque at 125% speed (2218.75&amp;nbsp;RPM) = 100% power.&lt;ref&gt;Bose (1980), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; At higher speeds, the induction motor torque has to be limited further due to the lowering of the breakaway torque{{efn|NEMA Guide defines a motor's breakaway torque as 'The torque that a motor produces at zero speed when operating on a control', and a motor's breakdown torque as 'The maximum torque that it will develop with rated voltage applied at rated frequency on sinewave power, without an abrupt drop in speed.'}} of the motor. Thus, rated power can be typically produced only up to 130-150% of the rated nameplate speed. Wound-rotor synchronous motors can be run at even higher speeds. In rolling mill drives, often 200-300% of the base speed is used. The mechanical strength of the rotor limits the maximum speed of the motor.

[[File:Pwm.png|right|thumb|240px|Fig. 1: SPWM carrier-sine input &amp; 2-level PWM output]]

An [[embedded system|embedded]] [[microprocessor]] governs the overall operation of the VFD controller. Basic [[Computer programming|programming]] of the microprocessor is provided as user-inaccessible [[firmware]]. User programming of [[display device|display]], variable, and function block parameters is provided to control, protect, and monitor the VFD, motor, and driven equipment.&lt;ref name=Bartos21st/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Basics of AC Drives, p. Programming: slide 3 of 7&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic drive controller can be configured to selectively include such optional power components and accessories as follows: 
* Connected upstream of converter -- [[circuit breaker]] or [[fuse (electrical)|fuse]]s, isolation [[contactor]], [[Electromagnetic compatibility|EMC]] filter, line [[inductor|reactor]], passive filter
* Connected to DC link -- [[braking chopper]], braking [[resistor]]
* Connected downstream of inverter—output reactor, sine wave filter, dV/dt filter.{{efn|The mathematical symbol dV/dt, defined as the [[derivative]] of voltage&amp;nbsp;V with time&amp;nbsp;t, provides a measure of rate of voltage rise, the maximum admissible value of which expresses the capability of capacitors, motors, and other affected circuit elements to withstand high current or voltage spikes due to fast voltage changes; dV/dt is usually expressed in V/microsecond.&lt;ref name=EPCOS&gt;{{cite web|title=Film capacitors - Short Definition of Terms|url=http://www.epcos.com/web/generator/Web/Sections/ProductCatalog/Capacitors/FilmCapacitors/PDF/PDF__DefinitionOfTerms,property=Data__en.pdf;/PDF_DefinitionOfTerms.pdf|accessdate=22 May 2012|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref&gt;Basics of AC Drives, p. Hardware - Part 2: slide 7 of 9&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Operator interface ===
The operator interface provides a means for an operator to start and stop the motor and adjust the operating speed. Additional operator control functions might include reversing, and switching between manual speed adjustment and automatic control from an external [[process control]] signal. The operator interface often includes an [[alphanumeric]] display or indication lights and meters to provide information about the operation of the drive. An operator interface keypad and display unit is often provided on the front of the VFD controller as shown in the photograph above. The keypad display can often be cable-connected and mounted a short distance from the VFD controller. Most are also provided with [[input/output|input and output]] (I/O) terminals for connecting push buttons, switches, and other operator interface devices or control signals. A [[serial communications]] [[Computer port (hardware)|port]] is also often available to allow the VFD to be configured, adjusted, monitored, and controlled using a computer.&lt;ref name=Bartos21st/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cleaveland&gt;{{cite journal | last =Cleaveland | first =Peter | title = AC Adjustable Speed Drives | journal =Control Engineering | publisher =Reed Business Information | date =Nov 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, pp. 107-129&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Drive operation ===
[[File:Four quadrant motion control of a motor.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Electric motor speed-torque chart]]
Referring to the accompanying chart, drive applications can be categorized as single-quadrant, two-quadrant, or four-quadrant; the chart's four quadrants are defined as follows:&lt;ref name=TGN8&gt;{{cite web|title=Technical guide No. 8 - Electrical Braking|url=http://www05.abb.com/global/scot/scot201.nsf/veritydisplay/6866afe6c69df93dc1257888004521e1/$file/abb_technical%20guide%20no.8_revb.pdf|accessdate=Apr 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EnergyRegen&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy Regeneration|url=http://www.freescale.com/files/training_pdf/WBNR_ENERGY_REGENERATION.pdf|accessdate=Apr 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Basics of AC Drives, pp. Hardware - Part 1: slides  9-10 of 11&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Quadrant I - Driving or motoring,&lt;ref&gt;Energy Regeneration, slide 3&lt;/ref&gt; forward [[acceleration|accelerating]] quadrant with positive speed and torque 
* Quadrant II - Generating or braking, forward braking-[[deceleration|decelerating]] quadrant with positive speed and negative torque
* Quadrant III - Driving or motoring, reverse accelerating quadrant with negative speed and torque
* Quadrant IV - Generating or braking, reverse braking-decelerating quadrant with negative speed and positive torque.

Most applications involve single-quadrant loads operating in quadrant I, such as in variable-torque (e.g. centrifugal pumps or fans) and certain constant-torque (e.g. extruders) loads.

Certain applications involve two-quadrant loads operating in quadrant I and II where the speed is positive but the torque changes [[electrical polarity|polarity]] as in case of a fan decelerating faster than natural mechanical losses. Some sources define two-quadrant drives as loads operating in quadrants I and III where the speed and torque is same (positive or negative) polarity in both directions.

Certain high-performance applications involve four-quadrant loads (Quadrants I to IV) where the speed and torque can be in any direction such as in hoists, elevators, and hilly conveyors. Regeneration can occur only in the drive's DC link bus when inverter voltage is smaller in magnitude than the motor back-[[Electromotive force|EMF]] and inverter voltage and back-EMF are the same polarity.&lt;ref&gt;Energy Regeneration, slide 6&lt;/ref&gt;

In starting a motor, a VFD initially applies a low frequency and voltage, thus avoiding high inrush current associated with [[Motor controller|direct-on-line starting]]. After the start of the VFD, the applied frequency and voltage are increased at a controlled rate or ramped up to accelerate the load. This starting method typically allows a motor to develop 150% of its rated torque while the VFD is drawing less than 50% of its rated current from the mains in the low-speed range. A VFD can be adjusted to produce a steady 150% starting torque from standstill right up to full speed.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, pp. 95-102&lt;/ref&gt; However, motor cooling deteriorates and can result in overheating as speed decreases such that prolonged low-speed operation with significant torque is not usually possible without separately motorized fan ventilation.

With a VFD, the stopping sequence is just the opposite as the starting sequence. The frequency and voltage applied to the motor are ramped down at a controlled rate. When the frequency approaches zero, the motor is shut off. A small amount of braking torque is available to help decelerate the load a little faster than it would stop if the motor were simply switched off and allowed to coast. Additional braking torque can be obtained by adding a braking circuit (resistor controlled by a transistor) to dissipate the braking energy. With a four-quadrant rectifier (active front-end), the VFD is able to brake the load by applying a reverse torque and injecting the energy back to the AC line.

== Benefits ==

=== Energy savings ===
Many fixed-speed motor load applications that are supplied direct from AC line power can save energy when they are operated at variable speed by means of VFD. Such energy cost savings are especially pronounced in variable-torque centrifugal fan and pump applications, where the load's torque and power vary with the square and [[cube (algebra)|cube]], respectively, of the speed. This change gives a large power reduction compared to fixed-speed operation for a relatively small reduction in speed. For example, at 63% speed a motor load consumes only 25% of its full-speed power. This reduction is in accordance with [[affinity laws]] that define the relationship between various centrifugal load variables.

In the United States, an  estimated 60-65% of electrical energy is used to supply motors, 75% of which are  variable-torque fan, pump, and compressor loads.&lt;ref name="Bose (2009b)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bose|first=Bimal K.|title=The Past, Present, and Future of Power Electronics|journal=Industrial Electronics Magazine, IEEE|date=June 2009|volume=3|issue=2|page=9|doi=10.1109/MIE.2009.932709}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eighteen percent of the energy used in the 40 million motors in the U.S. could be saved by efficient energy improvement technologies such as VFDs.&lt;ref name="Spear (2005)"&gt;{{cite web|last=Spear|first=Mike|title=Adjustable Speed Drives: Drive Up Energy Efficiency|url=http://www.chemicalprocessing.com/articles/2005/489.html?page=1|publisher=ChemicalProcessing.com|accessdate=Jan 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bose (2009a)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bose|first=B.

===Control performance===
AC drives are used to bring about process and quality improvements in industrial and commercial applications' acceleration, flow, monitoring, pressure, speed, temperature, tension, and torque.&lt;ref&gt;Basics of AC drives, p. Overview: slide 5 of 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Fixed-speed loads subject the motor to a high starting torque and to current surges that are up to eight times the full-load current. AC drives instead gradually ramp the motor up to operating speed to lessen mechanical and electrical stress, reducing maintenance and repair costs, and extending the life of the motor and the driven equipment.

Variable-speed drives can also run a motor in specialized patterns to further minimize mechanical and electrical stress. For example, an [[logistic function|S-curve pattern]] can be applied to a conveyor application for smoother deceleration and acceleration control, which reduces the backlash that can occur when a conveyor is accelerating or decelerating.

Performance factors tending to favor the use of DC drives over AC drives include such requirements as continuous operation at low speed, four-quadrant operation with regeneration, frequent acceleration and deceleration routines, and need for the motor to be protected for a hazardous area.&lt;ref name="ABB (DC vs. AC)"&gt;{{cite web|title=DC or AC Drives?

[[File:6SWS.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Six-step drive waveforms]]
[[File:MC Topology.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Topology of direct matrix converter]]
AC drives can be classified according to the following generic topologies:{{efn|A topology is defined in power electronics parlance as the relationship between AC drives' various elements.}}&lt;ref name=Morris&gt;{{cite web|first=Ewan|last=Morris|author2=Armitage, David|title=A Guide to Standard Medium Voltage Variable Speed Drives, Part 2|url=http://www05.abb.com/global/scot/scot216.nsf/veritydisplay/4fb66e46af347939c1256ed800338956/$file/fact%20packs%20part2.pdf|pages= 7–13|accessdate=Mar 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Paes (2011)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Paes|first=Richard|title=An Overview of Medium Voltage AC Adjustable Speed Drives and IEEE Std. 1566 – Standard for Performance of Adjustable Speed AC Drives Rated 375 kW and Larger|journal=Joint Power Engineering Society-Industrial Applications Society Technical Seminar|publisher=IEEE Southern Alberta Chapter|date=June 2011|pages= 1–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Voltage-source inverter (VSI) drive topologies''' (see image):  In a VSI drive, the DC output of the [[diode]]-bridge converter stores energy in the capacitor bus to supply stiff voltage input to the inverter. The vast majority of drives are VSI type with PWM voltage output.{{efn|The term PWM is often used to mean VSI-PWM, which is misleading as not only VSI drives are with PWM output.}}
* '''Current-source inverter (CSI) drive topologies''' (see image): In a CSI drive, the DC output of the [[silicon controlled rectifier|SCR]]-bridge converter stores energy in series-[[Inductor]] connection to supply stiff current input to the inverter. CSI drives can be operated with either PWM or six-step waveform output.
* '''Six-step inverter drive topologies''' (see image):{{efn|The term six-step refers strictly speaking to an inverter waveform output alternative to PWM, some drives being configured as combined six-step and PWM options.}}&lt;ref name=McMurray&gt;{{cite journal|last=McMurray|first=William|title=Power Electronic Circuit Topology|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE|date=April 1988|volume=76|issue=4|pages=428–437|doi=10.1109/5.4428}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Now largely obsolete, six-step drives can be either VSI or CSI type and are also referred to as variable-voltage inverter drives, [[pulse-amplitude modulation]] (PAM) drives,&lt;ref name="Carrow (2000)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carrow|first=Robert S.|title=Electrician's Technical Reference: Variable Frequency Drives|year=2000|publisher=Delmar Thomson Learning|location=Albany, NY|isbn=0-7668-1923-X|pages=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[power inverter|square-wave]] drives or [[chopper (electronic)|D.C. chopper]] inverter drives.&lt;ref&gt;Drury, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;  In a six-step drive, the DC output of the SCR-bridge converter is smoothed via capacitor bus and series-reactor connection to supply via [[Darlington Pair]] or [[Insulated gate bipolar transistor|IGBT]] inverter quasi-sinusoidal, six-step voltage or current input to an induction motor.&lt;ref name="Williams (2003)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sandy, Williams|author2=Baillie, Alastair |author3=Shipp, David |title=Understanding VSDs with ESPs - A Practical Checklist|publisher=Society of Petroleum Engineers|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Load commutated inverter (LCI) drive topologies''':  In an LCI drive (a special CSI case), the DC output of the SCR-bridge converter stores energy via DC link inductor circuit to supply stiff quasi-sinusoidal six-step current output of a second SCR-bridge's inverter and an over-excited synchronous machine.
* '''Cycloconverter or matrix converter (MC) topologies''' (see image):  [[Cycloconverter]]s and MCs are [[AC/AC converter|AC-AC converter]]s that have no intermediate DC link for energy storage. A cycloconverter operates as a three-phase current source via three anti-parallel-connected SCR-bridges in six-pulse configuration, each cycloconverter phase acting selectively to convert fixed line frequency AC voltage to an alternating voltage at a variable load frequency. MC drives are IGBT-based. 
* '''Doubly fed slip recovery system topologies''':  A [[doubly fed electric machine|doubly fed]] [[Induction motor#slip|slip]] recovery system feeds rectified slip power to a smoothing reactor to supply power to the AC supply network via an inverter, the speed of the motor being controlled by adjusting the DC current.

===Control platforms===
{{see also|Dqo transformation|Alpha–beta transformation}}
 
Most drives use one or more of the following control platforms:&lt;ref name=Morris/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drury, pp. 6-9&lt;/ref&gt;
* PWM V/Hz [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] control
* PWM [[field-oriented control]] (FOC) or vector control
* [[Direct torque control]] (DTC).

===Load torque and power characteristics===
Variable-frequency drives are also categorized by the following load torque and power characteristics:
* Variable torque, such as in centrifugal fan, pump, and blower applications
* Constant torque, such as in conveyor and positive-displacement pump applications
* Constant power, such as in machine tool and traction applications.

=== Available power ratings ===
VFDs are available with voltage and current ratings covering a wide range of single-phase and multi-phase AC motors. Low-voltage (LV) drives are designed to operate at output voltages equal to or less than 690&amp;nbsp;V. While motor-application LV drives are available in ratings of up to the order of 5&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;6 MW,&lt;ref name=ACS800Catalog&gt;{{cite journal | title = ACS800 Catalog - Single Drives 0.55 to 5600 kW| date =July 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; economic considerations typically favor medium-voltage (MV) drives with much lower power ratings.  Different MV drive topologies (see Table 2) are configured in accordance with the voltage/current-combination ratings used in different drive controllers' switching devices&lt;ref name="Wu05"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wu|first=Bin|title=High-Power Converters and AC Drives|url=http://www.ee.ryerson.ca/~bwu/seminars/pesc05_seminar.pdf|publisher=IEEE PES|year=2005|accessdate=Feb 3, 2012|page=slide 22}}&lt;/ref&gt; such that any given voltage rating is greater than or equal to one to the following standard nominal motor voltage ratings: generally either 2.3/4.16&amp;nbsp;kV (60&amp;nbsp;Hz) or 3.3/6.6&amp;nbsp;kV (50&amp;nbsp;Hz), with one thyristor manufacturer rated for up to 12&amp;nbsp;kV switching. In some applications a step-up [[transformer]] is placed between a LV drive and a MV motor load. MV drives are typically rated for motor applications  greater than between about 375&amp;nbsp;kW (500&amp;nbsp;HP) and 750&amp;nbsp;kW (1000&amp;nbsp;hp). MV drives have historically required considerably more application design effort than required for LV drive applications.&lt;ref name=BartosMV&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bartos | first =Frank J. | title =Medium-Voltage AC Drives Shed Custom Image  | journal =Control Engineering | publisher =Reed Business Information | date =Feb 1, 2000  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lockley (2008)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lockley|first=Bill |author2=Wood, Barry |author3=Paes, Richard |author4=DeWinter, Frank|title=Standard 1566 for (Un)Familiar Hands|journal=IEEE Industry Applications Magazine|date=Jan–Feb 2008|volume=14|issue=1|pages=21–28|doi=10.1109/MIA.2007.909800}}&lt;/ref&gt; The power rating of MV drives can reach 100&amp;nbsp;MW, a range of different drive topologies being involved for different rating, performance, power quality, and reliability requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, slide 159&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Klug (2005)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MVTopology"/&gt;

While [[harmonics (electrical power)|harmonics]] in the PWM output can easily be filtered by carrier-frequency-related filter inductance to supply near-sinusoidal currents to the motor load,&lt;ref name="Bose 2006, p. 183"/&gt; the VFD's diode-bridge rectifier converts AC line voltage to DC voltage output by super-imposing [[nonlinear system|non-linear]] half-phase current pulses thus creating harmonic current distortion, and hence voltage distortion, of the AC line input. When the VFD loads are relatively small in comparison to the large, stiff power system available from the [[electric power company]], the effects of VFD harmonic distortion of the [[Electrical grid|AC grid]] can often be within acceptable limits. Furthermore, in low-voltage networks, harmonics caused by single-phase equipment such as computers and TVs are partially cancelled by three-phase diode bridge harmonics because their 5th and 7th harmonics are in counterphase.&lt;ref name="Hansen (2000)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Janssen|first=Hansen|author2=Neilsen, Peter |author3=Blaabjerg, Frede |title=Harmonic Cancellation by Mixing Non-Linear Single-Phase and Three-Phase Loads|journal=IEEE Trans. on Industry Applications|date=Jan–Dec 2000|volume=36|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the proportion of VFD and other non-linear load compared to total load or of non-linear load compared to the stiffness at the AC power supply, or both, is relatively large enough, the load can have a negative impact on the AC power waveform available to other power company customers in the same grid.

When the power company's voltage becomes distorted due to harmonics, losses in other loads such as normal fixed-speed AC motors are increased. This condition may lead to overheating and shorter operating life. Also, [[Electrical substation|substation]] transformers and compensation capacitors are affected negatively. In particular, capacitors can cause resonance conditions that can unacceptably magnify harmonic levels. In order to limit the voltage distortion, owners of VFD load may be required to install filtering equipment to reduce harmonic distortion below acceptable limits. Alternatively, the utility may adopt a solution by installing filtering equipment of its own at substations affected by the large amount of VFD equipment being used. In high-power installations, harmonic distortion can be reduced by supplying multi-pulse rectifier-bridge VFDs from transformers with multiple phase-shifted windings.&lt;ref name="Technical Guide No. 6"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Guide to Harmonics with AC Drives - Technical Guide No. 6| date =May 17, 2002 | url =http://www05.abb.com/global/scot/scot201.nsf/veritydisplay/6dff3290e5f2d651c125788d00393a58/$file/ABB_Technical%20guide%20No.6_REVC.pdf| accessdate =Jul 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also possible to replace the standard diode-bridge rectifier with a bi-directional IGBT switching device bridge mirroring the standard inverter which uses IGBT switching device output to the motor. Such rectifiers are referred to by various designations including active infeed converter (AIC), [[active rectification|active rectifier]], IGBT supply unit (ISU), active front end (AFE), or four-quadrant operation. With PWM control and a suitable input reactor, an AFE's AC line current waveform can be nearly sinusoidal. AFE inherently regenerates energy in four-quadrant mode from the DC side to the AC grid. Thus, no braking resistor is needed, and the efficiency of the drive is improved if the drive is frequently required to brake the motor.

Two other harmonics mitigation techniques exploit use of passive or active filters connected to a common bus with at least one VFD branch load on the bus. Passive filters involve the design of one or more [[low-pass filter|low-pass]] LC filter traps, each trap being tuned as required to a harmonic frequency (5th, 7th, 11th, 13th, . . . kq+/-1, where k=integer, q=pulse number of converter).&lt;ref name="IEEE 519"&gt;{{cite journal|title=IEEE Std 519 - IEEE Recommended Practices and Requirements for Harmonic Control in Electrical Power Systems|year=1992|doi=10.1109/IEEESTD.1993.114370|publisher=IEEE|isbn=978-0-7381-0915-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is very common practice for power companies or their customers to impose harmonic distortion limits based on [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] or [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] standards. For example, IEEE Standard 519 limits at the customer's connection point call for the maximum individual frequency voltage harmonic to be no more than 3% of the fundamental and call for the voltage [[total harmonic distortion]] (THD) to be no more than 5% for a general AC power supply system.&lt;ref&gt;IEEE 519, pp. 69-70&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switching frequency foldback===
One drive uses a default switching frequency setting of 4&amp;nbsp;kHz. Reducing the drive’s switching frequency (the carrier-frequency) reduces the heat generated by the [[IGBT]]s.&lt;ref&gt;https://library.e.abb.com/public/79c9b3a80f5edf728525773e007661d6/ACH550_PHPB01U_EN_REVC.pdf [[ABB]] ACH550 Switching Frequency Foldback&lt;/ref&gt;

A carrier frequency of at least ten times the desired output frequency is used to establish the PWM switching intervals. A carrier frequency in the range of 2,000 to 16,000&amp;nbsp;Hz is common for LV [low voltage, under 600 Volts AC] VFDs. A higher carrier frequency produces a better sine wave approximation but incurs higher switching losses in the IGBT, decreasing the overall power conversion efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;https://selinc.com/api/download/21474837051/ Challenges and Solutions of Protecting Variable Speed Drive Motors | Angelo D’Aversa, Bob Hughes, and Subhash Patel | Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories, Inc. | Page 3, Column 1, next to last paragraph&lt;/ref&gt;

===Noise smoothing===
Some drives have a noise smoothing feature that can be turned on to introduce a random variation to the switching frequency. This distributes the acoustic noise over a range of frequencies to lower the peak noise intensity.

===Long-lead effects===
The carrier-frequency pulsed output voltage of a PWM VFD causes rapid rise times in these pulses, the transmission line effects of which must be considered. Since the transmission-line [[impedance (electrical)|impedance]] of the cable and motor are different, pulses tend to reflect back from the motor terminals into the cable. The resulting reflections can produce [[overvoltage]]s equal to twice the DC bus voltage or up to 3.1&amp;nbsp;times the rated line voltage for long cable runs, putting high stress on the cable and motor windings, and eventual insulation failure.  Insulation  standards for three-phase motors rated 230&amp;nbsp;V or less adequately protect against such long-lead overvoltages.  On 460&amp;nbsp;V or 575&amp;nbsp;V systems and inverters with 3rd-generation 0.1-microsecond-rise-time IGBTs, the maximum recommended cable distance between VFD and motor is about 50&amp;nbsp;m or 150&amp;nbsp;feet. For emerging SiC MOSFET powered drives, significant overvoltages have been observed at cable lengths as short as 3 meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dvdtfilter.com/dv-dt-simulation-scenario-1-sic-drive/|title=dv/dt Simulation Scenario 1: SiC Drive - dv/dt Simulation and Mitigation|date=2018-08-16|work=dv/dt Simulation and Mitigation|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solutions to overvoltages caused by long lead lengths include minimizing cable length, lowering carrier frequency, installing dV/dt filters, using inverter-duty-rated motors (that are rated 600&amp;nbsp;V to withstand pulse trains with rise time less than or equal to 0.1&amp;nbsp;microsecond, of 1,600&amp;nbsp;V peak magnitude), and installing LCR low-pass sine wave filters.&lt;ref&gt;Skibinski, p. 274&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Novak (2009)"&gt;{{cite web|last=Novak|first=Peter|title=The Basics of Variable-Frequency Drives|url=http://ecmweb.com/power_quality/variable-frequency-drives-20090501/|publisher=EC&amp;M|accessdate=Apr 18, 2012|date=May 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Finlayson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Finlayson|first=P.T.|title=Output filters for PWM drives with induction motors|date=Jan–Feb 1998|volume=4|issue=1|pages=46–52|journal=IEEE Industry Applications Magazine|doi=10.1109/2943.644886}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dvdtfilter.com/motor-voltage-waveform-simulation/|title=Motor Voltage Waveform Simulation - dv/dt Simulation and Mitigation|work=dv/dt Simulation and Mitigation|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selection of optimum PWM carrier frequency for AC&amp;nbsp;drives involves balancing noise, heat, motor insulation stress, common-mode voltage-induced motor bearing current damage, smooth motor operation, and other factors.

===Motor bearing currents===
{{main|Shaft voltage}}

Carrier frequencies above 5&amp;nbsp;kHz are likely to cause bearing damage unless protective measures are taken.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy13osti/56011.pdf Minimize Adverse Motor and Adjustable Speed Drive Interactions | Advanced Manufacturing Office Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy | U.S. Department of Energy]&lt;/ref&gt;

PWM drives are inherently associated with high-frequency common-mode voltages and currents which may cause trouble with motor bearings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.plantservices.com/articles/2007/022.html|pages=1–2| title=Bearings and Electricity Don't Match|year=2007|journal=PlantServices.com [Plant Services]|publisher=PtmanMedia|last=Yung|first=Chuck|location=Itasca, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt; When these high-frequency voltages find a path to earth through a bearing, transfer of metal or [[electrical discharge machining]] (EDM) sparking occurs between the bearing's ball and the bearing's race. Over time, EDM-based sparking causes erosion in the bearing race that can be seen as a fluting pattern. In large motors, the [[stray capacitance]] of the windings provides paths for high-frequency currents that pass through the motor shaft ends, leading to a circulating type of bearing current.  Poor [[Ground (electricity)|grounding]] of motor stators can lead to shaft-to-ground bearing currents. Small motors with poorly grounded driven equipment are susceptible to high-frequency bearing currents.&lt;ref name="Technical Guide No. 5"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Bearing Currents in Modern AC Drive Systems - Technical Guide No. 5| date =Dec 1, 1999 | url =http://www05.abb.com/global/scot/scot201.nsf/veritydisplay/8c253c2417ed0238c125788f003cca8e/$file/abb_technical_guide_no5_revc.pdf | accessdate =June 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prevention of high-frequency bearing current damage uses three approaches: good cabling and grounding practices, interruption of bearing currents, and filtering or damping of common-mode currents for example through soft magnetic cores, the so-called inductive absorbers. Good cabling and grounding practices can include use of shielded, symmetrical-geometry power cable to supply the motor, installation of shaft grounding brushes, and conductive bearing grease.  Bearing currents can be interrupted by installation of insulated bearings and specially designed electrostatic-shielded induction motors.  Filtering and damping high-frequency bearing can be done though inserting soft magnetic cores over the three phases giving a high frequency impedance against the common mode or motor bearing currents.  Another approach is to use instead of standard 2-level inverter drives, using either 3-level inverter drives or matrix converters.&lt;ref name="Technical Guide No. 5"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Swamy&gt;{{cite conference|booktitle=Proceedings of 11th International Conference on Optimization of Electrical and Electronic Equipment, 2008 (OPTIM 2008)|last=Swamy|first=M.|author2=Kume, T. |title=Present State and a Futuristic Vision of Motor Drive Technology|date=May 2008|pages=XLV–LVI, Fig. 16|publisher=IEEE|doi=10.1109/OPTIM.2008.4602333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since inverter-fed motor cables' high-frequency current spikes can interfere with other cabling in facilities, such inverter-fed motor cables should not only be of shielded, symmetrical-geometry design but should also be routed at least 50&amp;nbsp;cm away from signal cables.&lt;ref name="Technical Guide No. 3"&gt;{{cite journal | title = EMC Compliant Installation and Configuration for a Power Drive System - Technical Guide No. 3| date =Apr 11, 2008 | url =http://te-dep-epc.web.cern.ch/te-dep-epc/Infos/Conferences/EMC%20Workshop/ABBTechnicalGuideEMC.pdf| accessdate =Jul 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dynamic braking===
{{see also|Dynamic braking|Regenerative braking}}
Torque generated by the drive causes the induction motor to run at [[Synchronization (alternating current)|synchronous]] speed less the slip. If the load drives the motor faster than synchronous speed, the motor acts as a [[Electric generator|generator]], converting mechanical power back to electrical power. This power is returned to the drive's DC link element (capacitor or reactor). A DC-link-connected electronic power switch or [[braking chopper|braking DC chopper]] controls dissipation of this power as heat in a set of resistors. Cooling fans may be used to prevent resistor overheating.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Dynamic braking wastes braking energy by transforming it to heat. By contrast, regenerative drives recover braking energy by injecting this energy into the AC line. The capital cost of regenerative drives is, however, relatively high.&lt;ref&gt;Technical Guide No. 8, pp. 26-30&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regenerative drives===
[[File:KIMO TRA U2 mL Gruppe.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Line regenerative variable frequency drives, showing capacitors (top cylinders) and inductors attached, which filter the regenerated power.]]
[[File:2010 Prius Regeneration.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Simplified Drive Schematic for a Popular EHV&lt;ref name="Olszewski (2011)"&gt;{{cite web|last=Olszewski|first=Mitch|title=Evaluation of 2010 Toyota Prius Hybrid Electric Drive System|url=http://ecee.colorado.edu/~ecen5017/notes/OakRidge_2010Prius.pdf|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|accessdate=26 September 2012|year=2011|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Regenerative AC drives have the capacity to recover the braking energy of a load moving faster than the designated motor speed (an ''overhauling'' load) and return it to the power system.

Cycloconverter, Scherbius, matrix, CSI, and LCI drives inherently allow return of energy from the load to the line, while voltage-source inverters require an additional converter to return energy to the supply.&lt;ref name="Dubey"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dubey|first=Gopal K.|title=Fundamentals of Electrical Drives|year=2001|publisher=Alpha Science Int.|location=Pangbourne|isbn=1-84265-083-1|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rashid, p. 902, Table 33.13&lt;/ref&gt;

Regeneration is useful in VFDs only where the value of the recovered energy is large compared to the extra cost of a regenerative system,&lt;ref name="Dubey"/&gt; and if the system requires frequent braking and starting. Regenerative VFDs are widely used where speed control of overhauling loads is required.&lt;ref name=Jaeschke/&gt;&lt;ref name=Siskind/&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, pp. 70–190&lt;/ref&gt;

Some examples:
* Conveyor belt drives for manufacturing, which stop every few minutes. While stopped, parts are assembled correctly; once that is done, the belt moves on. 
* A crane, where the hoist motor stops and reverses frequently, and braking is required to slow the load during lowering.
* Plug-in and hybrid electric vehicles of all types (see image and [[Hybrid Synergy Drive]]).

==Historical systems==
Before solid-state devices became available, variable-frequency drives used rotary machines and the [[General Electric Company]] obtained several patents for these in the early 20th century. One example is US patent 949320 of 1910 which states: "Such a generator finds a useful application in supplying current to induction motors for driving cars, locomotives, or other mechanism which are to be driven at variable speeds".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Faccioli|first1=Giuseppe|title=Variable-frequency generator|url=https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?CC=US&amp;NR=949320A&amp;KC=A&amp;FT=D&amp;ND=3&amp;date=19100215&amp;DB=EPODOC&amp;locale=en_EP#|website=Espacenet|publisher=Espacenet|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another is British patent 7061 of 1911 by [[Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brown Boveri &amp; Cie|title=Improvements in and relating to variable frequency commutator dynamo-electric machines|url=https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?CC=GB&amp;NR=191107061A&amp;KC=A&amp;FT=D&amp;ND=3&amp;date=19110928&amp;DB=&amp;locale=en_EP#|website=Espacenet|publisher=Espacenet|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{about|variegation in botany|histology|Variegation (histology)}}
[[Image:Ficus carica Panascè.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Variegation of fruits and wood in ''[[Ficus carica]] Panascè'', a bicolor (yellow-green) common fig cultivar. This Italian cultivar is a ''[[Chimera (plant)|chimera]]'']]
'''Variegation''' is the appearance of differently coloured zones in the leaves, and sometimes the [[Plant stem|stems]], of plants. Variegated leaves occur rarely in nature. Species with variegated individuals are sometimes found in the [[understory]] of [[tropical rainforest]]s, and this habitat is the source of a number of variegated house plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Variegated Leaves|url=http://www.botgard.ucla.edu/html/botanytextbooks/generalbotany/shootfeatures/generalstructure/leafcolor/variegation.html|website=UCLA College|accessdate=9 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160615002817/http://www.botgard.ucla.edu/html/botanytextbooks/generalbotany/shootfeatures/generalstructure/leafcolor/variegation.html|archive-date=2016-06-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is also sometimes used to refer to colour zonation in [[flower]]s, [[mineral]]s, and the skin, fur, feathers or scales of animals.

== Causes ==
=== Chimeral ===
Because the variegation is due to the presence of two kinds of plant tissue, propagating the plant must be by a vegetative method of propagation that preserves both types of tissue in relation to each other. Typically, stem [[Cutting (plant)|cuttings]], bud and stem [[grafting]], and other propagation methods that results in growth from leaf axil buds will preserve variegation. Cuttings with complete variegation may be difficult if not impossible to propagate. Root cuttings will not usually preserve variegation, since the new stem tissue is derived from a particular tissue type within the root.

[[Image:VariegatedHollyBush.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Variegation in [[holly]] leaves]]
[[Image:PileaCadierei.jpg|thumb|left|Reflective variegation in ''[[Pilea cadierei]]''.]]
Some variegation is due to visual effects caused by [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] of light from the leaf surface. This can happen when an air layer is located just under the [[Epidermis (botany)|epidermis]] resulting in a white or silvery reflection. It is sometimes called blister variegation.

''[[Pilea]]'' (aluminum plant) is an example of a house plant that shows this effect. Leaves of most ''[[Cyclamen]]'' species show such patterned variegation, varying between plants, but consistent within each plant.

Another type of reflective variegation is caused by hairs on parts of the leaf, which may be coloured differently from the leaf. This is found in various ''[[Begonia]]'' species and garden hybrids.

Sometimes venal variegation occurs – the veins of the leaf are picked out in white or yellow. This is due to lack of green tissue above the veins. It can be seen in some aroids.

The [[Silybum marianum|blessed milk thistle]], ''Silybum marianum'', is a plant in which another type of venal variegation occurs, but in this case it is due to a blister variegation occurring along the veins.

=== Pigmentary ===
[[Image:TrifoliumPratense2.jpg|thumb|right|Leaves of [[Red Clover]] (''Trifolium pratense'') have a typical v-shaped variegation.]]
A common cause of variegation is the masking of green [[pigment]] by other pigments, such as [[anthocyanin]]s. This often extends to the whole leaf, causing it to be reddish or purplish. On some plants however, consistent zonal markings occur; such as on some [[clover]]s, [[Bromeliaceae|bromeliads]], certain ''[[Pelargonium]]'' and ''[[Oxalis]]'' species. On others, such as the commonly grown forms of [[Coleus]], the variegation can vary widely within a population.

In ''[[Nymphaea lotus]]'', the tiger lotus, leaf variegations appear under intense illumination.

=== Pathological ===

[[Virus]] infections may cause patterning to appear on the leaf surface. The patterning is often characteristic of the infection. Examples are the ''mosaic viruses'', which produce a mosaic-type effect on the leaf surface or the [[citrus variegation virus]] (CVV). Recently{{when?|date=January 2017}} a virus disease, hosta virus X (HVX) has been identified that causes mottled leaf coloring in [[hostas]]. At first, diseased plants were propagated and grown for their mottled foliage, at the risk of infecting other healthy hostas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hosta Virus X|url=http://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/gardens-gardening/your-garden/help-for-the-home-gardener/advice-tips-resources/pests-and-problems/diseases/viruses/hosta-virus-x.aspx|website=Missouri Botanical Garden|accessdate=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While these diseases are usually serious enough that the gardener would not grow affected plants, there are a few affected plants that can survive indefinitely, and are attractive enough to be grown for ornament; e.g. some variegated [[Abutilon]] varieties.

[[Nutrient]] deficiency symptoms may cause a temporary or variable yellowing in specific zones on the leaf. [[Iron]] and [[magnesium]] deficiencies are common causes of this.

[[Transposable element]]s can cause colour variegation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Barbara McClintock and the Discovery of Jumping Genes (Transposons)|url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/barbara-mcclintock-and-the-discovery-of-jumping-34083#|website=Nature|accessdate=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Defensive masquerade ==
It has been suggested that some patterns of leaf variegation may be part of a defensive "masquerade strategy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lev-Yadun |first=S. |date=2014 |title=Defensive masquerade by plants |url= |journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society |publisher= |volume=113 |issue= |pages=1162–1166 |doi=10.1111/bij.12399 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this, leaf variegation may appear to an insect [[leaf miner]] that the leaf is already infested, and this may reduce parasitization of the leaf by leaf miners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_8108000/8108940.stm |title=The plant that pretends to be ill |last1=Walker |first1=Matt |date=19 June 2009 |website=BBC News |publisher= |access-date=13 April 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nomenclature ==

By convention, the italicised term ''variegata'' as the second part of the Latin [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial]] name, indicates a [[species]] found in the wild with variegation (''[[Aloe variegata]]''). The much more common, non-italicised, inclusion of 'Variegata' as the third element of a name indicates a variegated [[cultivar]] of an unvariegated parent (''[[Aucuba japonica]]'' 'Variegata'). However, not all variegated plants have this Latin tag, for instance many cultivars of ''[[Pelargonium]]'' have some zonal variegation in their leaves. Other types of variegation may be indicated, e.g. ''[[Daphne odora]]'' 'Aureomarginata' has yellow edging on its leaves.

== Garden plants ==
[[Image:Variegated foliage.JPG|thumb|right|Variegated foliage used in an English garden. Plants shown include ''Aralia elata'' 'Aureovariegata' and ''Carex ornithopoda'' 'Variegata']]

Variegated plants have long been valued by gardeners, as the usually lighter-coloured variegation can 'lift' what would otherwise be blocks of solid green foliage. Many gardening societies have specialist variegated plants groups, such as the [[Hardy Plant Society]]'s Variegated Plant Special Interest Group in the UK. Several gardening books which deal exclusively with variegated plants are available.

'''''What Should Legal Analysis Become?''''' is a book by philosopher and politician [[Roberto Mangabeira Unger]]. First published in 1996, the book germinated from lectures Unger gave at Yale Law School, Columbia Law School, and the London School of Economics. In the book, Unger argues that in order to transform society to be more radically democratic, it is necessary to penetrate the specialized professions so that we can talk about, and imagine, institutions effectively. Unger focuses on the legal profession in this book, setting forth a vision of law as "institutional imagination." He presents a program for changing the nature of the legal profession so that less power is vested in legal professionals and institutions, and legal analysis is reoriented to be more egalitarian and advance more effectively the democratic project.

==Reception==

[[Jeremy Waldron]], reviewing ''What Should Legal Analysis Become?'' in the ''[[Columbia Law Review]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Waldron, "Dirty Little Secret" (review of ''What Should Legal Analysis Become?''), 98 Columbia Law Review 510 (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; praised the book as an "eminently readable" text encompassing many of the same themes that Unger explored in his three-volume ''Politics: A Work in Constructive Social Theory''. Waldron notes that Unger's argument in the book has a negative and a positive side. Waldron finds the negative side of Unger's argument—in which Unger attacks contemporary American legal analysis as "incapable of contributing to serious social reform" (as Waldron summarizes the argument)—"exciting," and states that Unger's negative argument "goes right to the heart of the difficulties about political agency that disfigure modern legal scholarship."&lt;ref&gt;Waldron 517&lt;/ref&gt; Waldron finds the positive side of Unger's argument "somewhat less convincing." The positive argument, which contains Unger's exploration of the alternative futures of democracy, Waldron dismisses as "broad-brush sketching of some rather familiar social-democratic ideals .... [that] might have been produced by any intelligent person on the left."&lt;ref&gt;Waldron 512-513&lt;/ref&gt; Waldron sums up his assessment by stating that "so far as the positive suggestions are concerned, one is left frustrated by this book. The negative account of mainstream legal analysis is provocative, and the critique of its orientation to the courts is important and timely."&lt;ref&gt;Waldron 528&lt;/ref&gt;

Robin Bradley Kar contends that Unger's constructive program in ''What Should Legal Analysis Become?'' is inconsistent with his negative criticisms of contemporary American legal interpretation. In his review of the book in the ''[[Yale Law Journal]]'',&lt;ref&gt;"Legal Analysis and the Perversions of Theory (review of ''What Should Legal Analysis Become?''), 106 Yale Law Journal 2685 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Kar argued that Unger's criticism of contemporary legal analysis rests on the idea that we should not rest our interpretations of law upon general "policies of collective welfare and principles of moral and political right,"&lt;ref&gt;Kar 2686&lt;/ref&gt; because such reliance works to suppress important parts of the democratic compromises that help advance radical democratic aims. But, Kar points out, Unger's constructive, positive program rests on "similarly general conceptions of democracy and human nature."&lt;ref&gt;Kar 2690&lt;/ref&gt; Kar concludes that "Unger's entire work thus provides us with a useful moral about the dangers inherent in interpreting the law through the lens of theory."&lt;ref&gt;Kar 2686&lt;/ref&gt;

Lorne Sossin, reviewing the book in the ''University of Toronto Law Journal'',&lt;ref&gt;"The Politics of Imagination" (review of ''What Should Legal Analysis Become?'') 47 University of Toronto Law Journal 523 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; praised ''What Should Legal Analysis Become?'' as a "provocative and enlightening" account of "the myths and contradictions upon which our political and legal institutions rest," one that may "facilitate transforming those institutions into more emancipatory forms."&lt;ref&gt;Sossin 523-524&lt;/ref&gt; Sossin notes that Unger would add "prophecy" and "vision" to the pursuits of critical theory.&lt;ref&gt;Sossin 524&lt;/ref&gt; Sossin concludes that "''What Should Legal Analysis Become?'' is in many ways an illustration of Unger practicing what he preaches—reinventing and recombining ideas and elements of his previous thought into a reinvigorated critique. His analysis never fails to engage, though ... it does leave important questions unanswered."&lt;ref&gt;Sossin 534&lt;/ref&gt;
