'''4797 Ako''', provisional designation {{mp|1989 SJ}}, is a stony Nysian [[asteroid]] from the inner regions of the [[asteroid belt]], approximately 5 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 30 September 1989, by the Japanese astronomers [[Toshiro Nomura]] and [[Kōyō Kawanishi]] at the Minami-Oda Observatory ({{small|[[IAU code#374|374]]}}), Japan.&lt;ref name="MPC-Ako" /&gt; The asteroid was named for the Japanese city of [[Akō, Hyōgo|Akō]].&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt;

== Orbit and classification ==

''Ako'' is a member of the [[S-type asteroid|stony]] subgroup of the [[Nysa family]], which is named after its largest member [[44&amp;nbsp;Nysa]]. It orbits the Sun in the [[Kirkwood gap|inner]] main-belt at a distance of 2.0–2.9&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] once every 3 years and 9 months (1,369 days). Its orbit has an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.18 and an [[orbital inclination|inclination]] of 2[[Degree (angle)|°]] with respect to the [[ecliptic]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;

In 1978, it was first identified as {{mp|1978 VY|9}} at [[Palomar Observatory]], extending the body's [[observation arc]] by 11 years prior to its official discovery observation at Minami-Oda Observatory.&lt;ref name="MPC-Ako" /&gt;

== Physical characteristics ==

=== Rotation period ===

A rotational [[lightcurve]] of ''Ako'' was obtained for the first time from photometric observations made at the U.S. Ricky Observatory, Missouri, in November 2008. It gave a well-defined [[rotation period]] of {{val|4.085|0.001}} hours with a relatively high brightness variation of 0.90 in [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] ({{small|[[LCDB quality code|U=3]]}}), indicative of a non-spheroidal shape.&lt;ref name="Bennefeld-2009c" /&gt;

=== Diameter and albedo ===

According to NASA's space-based [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]] with its subsequent [[NEOWISE]] mission, ''Ako'' measures 6.0 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an [[astronomical albedo|albedo]] of 0.11,&lt;ref name="WISE" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Masiero-2011" /&gt; while the ''Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link'' (CALL) assumes a standard albedo for stony asteroids of 0.21, and calculates a diameter of 4.0 kilometers, as the higher the albedo (reflectivity), the smaller a body's diameter for a certain [[absolute magnitude]] (brightness).&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;

== Naming ==

This [[minor planet]] was named for the city of [[Akō, Hyōgo|Akō]] in the [[Hyōgo Prefecture]], Japan, and for its ancient castle on the [[Seto Inland Sea]].&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt;

Known for its [[Salt#Production|salt production]], Ako is the birthplace of the fictional account of ''[[Chūshingura]]'', a tale about the [[forty-seven Ronin]] who committed [[seppuku]] after avenging their master. The city is also the home of the second discoverer's private Minami-Oda observatory, where Kōyō Kawanishi observes small Solar System bodies.&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt; The official naming citation was published by the [[Minor Planet Center]] on 27 June 1991 ({{small|[[Minor Planet Circulars|M.P.C.]] 18465}}).&lt;ref name="MPC-Circulars-Archive" /&gt;

The '''A18''' is a road in [[England]] that links [[Doncaster]] in [[South Yorkshire]] with [[Ludborough]] in [[Lincolnshire]], via [[Scunthorpe]].

==Route==
===Principal settlements===
* [[Doncaster]]
* [[Hatfield, South Yorkshire|Hatfield]]
* [[Scunthorpe]]
* [[Brigg]]
* [[Humberside International Airport]]
* [[Keelby]]
* [[Laceby]]
* [[Ludborough]] (merging with the [[A16 road (Great Britain)|A16 road]], near [[Louth, Lincolnshire|Louth]])

===Doncaster – Thorne===
[[File:Leger Way - geograph.org.uk - 449144.jpg|thumb|140px|right|[[St. Leger Stakes|Leger]] Way in Doncaster next to [[Doncaster Racecourse]] ]]
The A18 begins as a dual-carriageway and trunk road at the Balby Flyover junction with the [[A630 road|A630]] in [[Balby]] in Doncaster, under which runs the [[East Coast Main Line]]. It meets the [[A638 road|A638]] (former Great North Road) at the Sidings Roundabout then becomes Carr House Road, overlapping the A638. At the Racecourse [[Roundabout]] in [[Belle Vue, Doncaster|Belle Vue]], the A638 exits to the right (former Great North Road), and the road becomes [[St. Leger family|Leger]] Way. Near [[Intake, South Yorkshire|Intake]], it becomes a single carriageway and continues to Scunthorpe. At the [[Sandall Park]] Roundabout the road meets its old route and becomes [[Thorne, South Yorkshire|Thorne]] Road. At the Shaw Lane Roundabout it meets the A630 and runs under a railway line. At the next roundabout, on the edge of Doncaster, the A630 leaves to the right, as a trunk road to the [[M18 motorway (Great Britain)|M18]]. The road, now without trunk (primary) status, passes through [[Edenthorpe]].

[[File:Tudworth Roundabout - geograph.org.uk - 1238913.jpg|thumb|140px|left|Tudworth Roundabout with the [[A614 road|A614]] and M180 – former A18(M)]]
The road enters Dunsville as High Street and becomes Doncaster Road. In Hatfield, it becomes Manor Road and then High Street, and crosses the [[M18 motorway (Great Britain)|M18]]. It becomes Epworth Road and meets the A1146 near [[Hatfield Woodhouse]], then meets the [[A614 road|A614]] from the right from [[Finningley]]. The road becomes Tudworth Road and overlaps the [[A614 road|A614]]; at the Tudworth Roundabout, the A18 continues to the right.

===Thorne – Brigg===
[[File:A18, Scunthorpe - geograph.org.uk - 440386.jpg|thumb|140px|right|[[Gunness]] Straight west of [[Scunthorpe]] towards the [[River Trent|Trent]] ]]
As High Levels Bank, it crosses a flat landscape known as [[Hatfield Chase]] and enters [[North Lincolnshire]]. It runs alongside the large North Engine Drain next to the [[M180 motorway|M180]]. At [[Crowle, Lincolnshire|Crowle]], it meets the [[A161 road|A161]], close to junction 2 of the M180 and crosses Pilfrey Bridge over the Three Rivers. The A18 meets the B1392 (for [[Keadby]]) and passes through [[Gunness]], crossing the B1216 (for [[Burringham]]) as Station Road. It meets the A1077 Scunthorpe ring road and the [[M181 motorway|M181]] at the [[Frodingham, Lincolnshire|Frodingham]] Grange Roundabout.

[[File:Road crossing motorway - geograph.org.uk - 327475.jpg|thumb|140px|left|Crossing the [[M180 motorway|M180]] near Castlethorpe between Scunthorpe and Brigg]]
The road enters the Queensway Roundabout for the trunk road [[A159 road|A159]] at Old Brumby, becoming the non-trunk dual-carriageway Queensway. It passes through New Brumby, and at the Ashby Ville Roundabout it meets the A1029. The road meets the Briggate Lodge Roundabout on the line of [[Ermine Street]], for junction 4 for the M180 and the trunk-road [[A15 road (Great Britain)|A15]].

===Brigg – Ludborough===
[[File:A18 Bridge over New River Ancholme - geograph.org.uk - 178085.jpg|thumb|140px|right|A18 in Brigg over the [[River Ancholme]] ]]
At Scawby Brook, there is a roundabout with the B1206 (for [[Scawby]]), and the road enters [[Brigg]] to the left as Scawby Road, becoming Bridge Street and then Ancholme Way. The B1206 (former A15) leaves to the left and the road enters [[Wrawby]] as Brigg Road and becomes Melton Road.

[[File:A18 road approach at Humberside Airport - geograph.org.uk - 1506627.jpg|thumb|140px|left|Passing [[Humberside Airport]] ]]
The road passes through [[Melton Ross]] and passes next to [[Humberside Airport]]. At the B1210 (for [[Brocklesby]]) junction, the road heads to the right, entering [[Lincolnshire]] and the district of [[West Lindsey]], and passes through [[Great Limber]] as High Street. It meets the B1211 and heads to the right as Barton Street (a [[Roman road]]). Near [[Riby]], the road becomes a trunk road (until its terminus) then a dual-carriageway close to where it enters [[North East Lincolnshire]].

[[File:Approaching Laceby Junction - geograph.org.uk - 306281.jpg|thumb|140px|right|Approaching [[Laceby]] on one of the few dual carriageway sections on the ''Barton Street'' Roman road]]
The road meets the [[A46 road|A46]] Grimsby road, and heads straight on over the roundabout. The A18 used to continue eastwards from here along the present [[A46 road|A46]] into Grimsby, and now continues southwards over [[Welbeck Hill]] along the former B1431. The boundary of Lincolnshire and North East Lincolnshire runs down the middle of the road for about {{convert|3|mi}}. The road re-enters Lincolnshire and the district of [[East Lindsey]]. The road follows the former A16 from Ludborough to near [[Utterby]], where is meets the [[A16 road (England)|A16]].

The last section, between the junction with the A46 at Laceby and the junction with the A16 at Ludborough, was designated by the [[Road Safety Foundation]] as the most dangerous in the country for car drivers, drawing on collated data on the number of fatal and serious-injury collisions in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clark|first1=Eric|title=Hidden dangers of Britain's deadliest roads|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/road-safety/7853739/Hidden-dangers-of-Britains-deadliest-roads.html|accessdate=17 July 2015|publisher=Telegraph|date=1 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a 2015 inquest, a coroner called for an independent review of the A18 near Grimsby; the coroner was reacting to the death of a family after a collision with a lorry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-humber-35757696|title=Coroner calls for 'killer' A18 road review|date=2016-03-08|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-08-29|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the government announced that £175 million would be made available for safety improvements on roads like the A18.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.transport-network.co.uk/175m-to-tackle-50-killer-roads-under-13bn-plans/13560|title=£175m to tackle 50 killer roads, under £1.3bn plans - The Transport Network|website=www.transport-network.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The A18(M) was a short [[motorway]] about {{convert|1|mi}} long that connected the [[M18 motorway (Great Britain)|M18]], from what is now junction 5 north of [[Hatfield, Doncaster|Hatfield]] to the A18. The A18(M) was built in 1972 but was redesignated after the [[M180 motorway|M180]] was built in 1978.

The western end of the M180 from M18 junction 5 to the junction 1 eastbound [[slip road]] was previously part of the A18(M). The eastbound slip road to the roundabout was the eastbound carriageway A18(M). About {{convert|0.5|mi}} of the westbound A18(M) carriageway was abandoned when the M180 was built on a new alignment.

The '''A20''' is a major road in south-east [[England]], carrying traffic from [[London]] to [[Dover]] in [[Kent]]. Parts of the route date back to [[Toll road|turnpike]]s established in the early part of the 18th century. The line of the road throughout Kent runs closely in parallel with the [[M20 motorway]].

==Route==
===London to the M25===
Traffic leaving London at first takes the [[A2 road (Great Britain)|A2 road]]; at [[New Cross]] in the [[London Borough of Lewisham]] the A20 begins and heads in a south-easterly direction, becoming in turn ''Lewisham Way'' and '' Loampit Vale''. The latter road forms a large junction, where the [[A21 road (England)|A21]] separates for [[Hastings]]. The road now runs through ''Lee High Road'' into ''Eltham Road'',  The junction with the A210 contains an unusually long 41 m [[yellow box junction]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/yellow_box_junction_dimensions yellow box junction dimensions - a Freedom of Information request to Transport for London - WhatDoTheyKnow&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  and continues as the ''Sidcup Bypass'', crossing the A222 at [[Frognal Corner]] and the A224 at Crittall's Corner.  Entering Kent, it runs past [[Swanley]] and flows directly onto the [[M20 motorway]].

===Junctions===
The main junctions on the London to M25 section are:
*New Cross (with the A2, road starts here)
*Lewisham Gateway (with the A21 and A2211)
*Sutcliffe Park (with the A210 to Eltham)
*Clifton's Roundabout (with the A205 South Circular)
*Fiveways, New Eltham (with the B263)
*Frognal Corner (with the A222)
*Crittall's Corner (with the A223 and A224)
*Swanley Interchange (M25 Junction 3 / M20 Junction 1)

===The M25 to Dover===
The A20 then passes the racing circuit at [[Brands Hatch]] before descending steeply from the [[North Downs]] [[escarpment]] past [[Wrotham]] and on to the county town of [[Maidstone]]. The route beyond Maidstone travels East, through the villages of [[Bearsted]], [[Harrietsham]], [[Lenham]] and [[Charing]] to [[Ashford, Kent|Ashford]].

The [[A292 road|A292]] takes over the former A20 through Ashford itself, then the road emerges as it heads through [[Willesborough]] and [[Sellindge]] in the direction of [[Hythe, Kent|Hythe]]. It takes a sharp turn left at [[Newingreen]] (the site of the UK's first [[motel]]) before entering [[Folkestone]] via [[Cheriton, Kent|Cheriton]], passing the vehicular entrance to the [[Channel Tunnel]], forming part of the town's original [[Bypass (road)|bypass]] as the [[trunk road]] from the M20. The route then follows the coastline, tunnelling through the hills and descending to the [[dock (maritime)|dock]]s in Dover, where it meets the A2 again coming down from [[Canterbury]].

==History==

Part of the route now followed by the modern road, particularly the western section, was opened as various turnpikes in the 18th century in an effort to improve coaching links between London and the Kent towns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hereshistorykent.org.uk/DisplayArticle.cfm?placeID=13&amp;categoryID=55&amp;placename=Ashford |title=Transport and communications |date= |work= |publisher=Kent County Council |accessdate=22 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306082244/http://hereshistorykent.org.uk/displayarticle.cfm?categoryid=55&amp;placeid=13&amp;placename=ashford |archivedate=6 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early days of the [[Great Britain road numbering scheme]] the A20 ran through [[Eltham, London|Eltham]]. {{convert|0.7|mi}} along Eltham Road the [[Sidcup]] [[Arterial road|Arterial Road]] begins, opened in 1923, which carries traffic south of the two towns instead, leaving the [[A210 road|A210]] and [[A211 road]]s following the original route.  The nearby town of Swanley was bypassed in 1968, and the short link between the two bypasses was constructed in 1988 (to the south of the [[Ruxley|Ruxley Corner]] roundabout).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/wiki/index.php?title=A20_history |title=A20 history |date=20 December 2011 |work= |publisher=The Society for All British and Irish Road Enthusiasts |accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Roundhill Tunnels - geograph.org.uk - 1710434.jpg|thumb|left|The western portals of the Roundhill Tunnel]]
A section of the A20 in Ashford formed part of the Ashford By-Pass, a dual carriageway opened in 1957,&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1957/jul/22/roads-programme#S5CV0574P0_19570722_HOC_330 ROADS PROGRAMME (Hansard, 22 July 1957)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; which used to run from what is now the roundabout with Simone Weil Avenue to the Willesborough roundabout. Simone Weil Avenue is the original A20 bypass, but has been diverted to curtail at Canterbury Road. The eastern end of the old by-pass is now the M20.

The section between Maidstone and Ashford was the only link between the two separate sections of the M20 for 10 years during the 1980s, until the {{convert|14|mi|adj=on}} ''missing link'' of the motorway was completed in May 1991.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://motorwayarchive.ihtservices.co.uk/en/motorways/motorway-listing/m20-london-to-folkestone-and-a20-to-dover/remaining-sections.cfm |title=Remaining sections&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=13 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425061513/http://motorwayarchive.ihtservices.co.uk/en/motorways/motorway-listing/m20-london-to-folkestone-and-a20-to-dover/remaining-sections.cfm |archive-date=25 April 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

North of Folkestone the M20 becomes a dual carriageway and enters the Roundhill Tunnel before crossing over and dropping down into Dover. This part of the A20 was completed in 1993 as a project included in the Parliamentary Bill for the Channel Tunnel.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; During 2011, structural failures in and around the Roundhill Tunnel have caused the A20 to be closed in this area numerous times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/25577.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710011055/http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/25577.aspx |archivedate=10 July 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Albertinus de Virga''' (or '''Albertin de Virga''') was a 15th-century [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] [[cartographer]].

Practically nothing is known of his life, save that he was probably [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]].  Virga is the author of two famous maps:

* 1409 [[portolan chart]], 43 x 68 cm, covering the Mediterranean, Black Sea and Atlantic coast, and signed "A 1409 Alber...Virga me fezit in Vinexia".  Currently held by the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] in Paris, France. (D.7900)&lt;ref&gt;
Gallica, BNF:([http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b59011076/f1 D.7900])&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The [[De Virga world map]], a [[mappa mundi]] 69.6 x 44 cm, signed "A. 141.. Albertin diuirga me fecit in vinexia", where the date has been read as between 1411 and 1415, that was once in the private collection of Albrecht Frigdor of [[Vienna]], but has since gone missing.

It has been tentatively suggested that Virga might also have been the author of a third map, an anonymous [[portolan chart]] dating from the beginning of the 15th century currently held  (Port.40) by the [[Museo Correr]] in [[Venice]], Italy.&lt;ref&gt;This is proposed by Pujades (2007) ''Les cartes portolanes'', but doubted by Campbell (2011) "Anonymous works and the question of their attribution" ([http://www.maphistory.info/PortolanAttributions.html#virga on Virga])&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5997">The term '''''alqueire''''' is documented in [[Portugal]] since the 12th century. It derives from the Arabic ''al kayl'', which designated originally the satchels or baskets carried by [[pack animal]]s for the transport of goods. The capacity of those satchels, more or less standardized by the ability of the pack animals, was taken as a measure of dry goods, especially grain. In Portugal, it was used as a measure of capacity and, eventually, it was used also as a measure of area of productive land. The spread of Portuguese culture took both meanings of the word to different parts of the world.

==Portugal==
[[File:Assorted grains.jpg|thumb|235px|right|The ''alqueire'' was a measure of capacity primarily used for grains]]
[[File:Mature grain.jpg|thumb|right|235px|With time, ''alqueire'' also began to refer to the area of land that could be sown with an alqueire of grain]]

The Arabic ''al-kayl'', used in areas of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] under [[Arabs|Arab]] rule, was imported to northern Portugal around the time of the [[County of Portugal|Portuguese County]], where it became known as ''alqueire''. The first explicit reference dates from 1111, but the alqueire was already in use in the late 11th century. Most likely, the term ''alqueire'' designated a single well-known measure in the Portuguese County. Half century later, in 1145, the municipal ordinances of Coimbra stipulated that the alqueire (of cereal) should have a weight of 6.5 [[arrátel|arráteis]], and thus a capacity for around 3.4 liters. This probably indicates that other alqueires were starting to be used in parallel with the standard.

Throughout most of the first dynasty, reigns of [[Afonso I of Portugal|Afonso Henriques]] to [[Afonso IV of Portugal|Afonso IV]], the legal alqueire was equivalent to the Roman [[Ancient Roman units of measurement#Dry_measures|modius]], i.e. about 8.7 liters. However, the legal alqueire was not used throughout the whole country. King [[Pedro I of Portugal|Pedro I]] (1357) introduced a new alqueire of 9.8 liters and tried to impose it as a standard for the whole kingdom. This alqueire in fact had a wider spread than the previous one, but failed to generalize to the entire territory. With [[Manuel I of Portugal | Manuel I]] (1499), the alqueire of [[Lisbon]], which amounted to 13.1 liters, became the standard for the kingdom. [[Sebastian of Portugal|Sebastião I]] (1575) distributed copies of this standard, in bronze, to the main towns of the kingdom. However, regional standards still survived. Later, probably following the 1755 earthquake, the capacity of the alqueire of Lisbon was adjusted, approaching the 13.9 liters, which would allow easier conversion to the Spanish system.

The main standards used in different regions of Portugal in the nineteenth century were as follows:

* 13.1 liters on the coast between [[Lisbon]] and [[Aveiro, Portugal|Aveiro]]
* 13.9 liters, all over the country
* 14.9 and 15.7 liters, especially in the interior and south
* 17.0, 17.5 and 19.3 liters, almost exclusively in the [[Entre-Douro-e-Minho Province|Entre-Douro-e-Minho]]

At the local level, a multitude of variants of these major patterns were in actual use. Despite the introduction of the metric system in the nineteenth century, traditional alqueires continued to be used.

Since the Middle Ages, the term alqueire also designated units of measure of area of land. Typically, an area alqueire was the area of land that could be sown with an alqueire of seed.

==Brazil==
In the time of the Portuguese Discoveries, the settlers of Brazil adopted both the capacity alqueire and the area alqueire. The area alqueire, with variations propagating throughout their territory, is still widely known:

Even until the 20th century, in conversations with local Azorean seniors, many would refer to both meanings of alqueire: ''"minha terra produziu 40 alqueires de milho por alqueire de terra"'' (''my land produced 40 alqueires of corn per alqueire of land'').&lt;ref name="Ilhas"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ilhas.blogspot.pt/2007/07/alqueires-palmos-e-varaspequenas-e.html |title=Alqueires, palmos e varas…pequenas e grandes! |publisher=:ILIHAS |language=Portuguese |location=Ponta Delgada (Azores), Portugal |accessdate=4 April 2013 |date=31 July 2011 |first=João Nuno |last=Almeida e Sousa}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Azores, lands were distributed to the settlers who explored and expanded the territory; the Crown provided guarantees that who could explore and expand Portuguese patrimony would benefit from their largesse.&lt;ref name=Ilhas/&gt; It was in the [[Moio (unit)|moio]] and ''alqueire'' that many of the rural property-owners obtained their honorific titles.&lt;ref name=Ilhas/&gt;

'''Angle of arrival (AoA)''' measurement is a method for determining the direction of propagation of a radio-frequency wave incident on an [[antenna array]] or determined from maximum signal strength during antenna rotation. AoA determines the direction by measuring the Time Difference of Arrival ([[TDOA]]) at individual elements of the array -- from these delays the AoA can be calculated.  

Generally this TDOA measurement is made by measuring the difference in received phase at each element in the antenna array.  This can be thought of as [[beamforming]] in reverse.  In beamforming, the signal from each element is weighed to "steer" the gain of the antenna array.  In AoA, the delay of arrival at each element is measured directly and converted to an AoA measurement.

Consider, for example, a two element array spaced apart by one-half the wavelength of an incoming RF wave.  If a wave is incident upon the array at boresight, it will arrive at each antenna simultaneously.  This will yield 0° phase-difference measured between the two antenna elements, equivalent to a 0° AoA.  If a wave is incident upon the array at broadside, then a 180° phase difference will be measured between the elements, corresponding to a 90° AoA.

A current application of AoA is in the [[geodesic]] location or [[geolocation]] of [[cell phone]]s. The aim is either to comply with regulations that require cell systems to report the location of a cell phone placing an emergency (i.e., 911) call or to provide a special service to tell the bearer of the cell phone where he is.  Multiple receivers on a base station would calculate the AoA of the cell phone's signal, and this information would be combined to determine the phone's location on the earth.  

AoA is generally used to discover the location of [[Pirate radio|pirate radio stations]] or of any [[military]] radio transmitter.

In [[submarine]] [[acoustics]], AoA is the method to localize objects with active or passive [[ranging]].

In [[optics]], AoA is considered from the perspective of [[interferometry]].

'''Anglo-Celtic''' citizens  are those of [[British people|British]] or [[English people|English]] and [[Celts (modern)|Celtic]] descent.&lt;ref name="oed-angloceltic"&gt;{{citation|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/view/entry/m_en_gb0028300#m_en_gb0028300.003|title=Oxford English Dictionary|quote=Anglo-Celt /aŋɡləʊˈkɛlt/  a person of Irish or British descent (used chiefly outside Ireland and Britain).}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is mainly relevant outside of [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]], particularly in [[Australia]] but also in [[Canada]], the [[United States]], [[New Zealand]] and [[South Africa]], where a significant [[diaspora]] is located.

The term is a combination of the [[combining form]] ''Anglo-'' and the adjective ''Celtic''. ''Anglo-'', meaning ''English''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/view/entry/m_en_gb0028260#m_en_gb0028260 |title=Anglo- |quote=/ˈaŋgləʊ/ combiningForm English: anglophone; of English origin: Anglo-Saxon; English and ...: Anglo-Latin; British and ...: Anglo-Indian Origin: modern Latin, from Latin Anglus 'English' |deadurl=no |accessdate=5 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is derived from the [[Angles]], a [[Germanic people]] who settled in Britain (mainly in what is now England) in the middle of the [[first millennium]]. The name ''[[England]]'' ({{lang-ang|Engla land}} or {{lang|ang|Ængla land}}) originates from these people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/M/monarchy/extract.html The Monarchy of England: Volume I – The Beginnings] by David Starkey (extract at Channel 4 programme 'Monarchy')&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Celts (modern)|Celtic]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/Celt?rskey=E5CxOR&amp;result=1#m_en_gb0132540 |title=Celt |quote=/kɛlt, sɛlt/ noun a native of any of the modern nations or regions in which Celtic languages are (or were until recently) spoken; a person of Irish, Highland Scottish, Manx, Welsh or Cornish descent.}}&lt;/ref&gt; in this context, refers to the people of [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]], [[Wales]], the [[Isle of Man]] and [[Cornwall]].

Recorded usage dates as far back to at least the mid-19th century. A newspaper of the name, ''[[The Anglo-Celt]]'' (pronounced in this case as 'Anglo-Selt'), was founded in [[County Cavan]] in Ireland in 1846. In an 1869 publication, the term was contrasted with [[Anglo-Saxon]] as a more appropriate term for people of Irish and British descent worldwide:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Anglo-Saxon," as applied to the modern British people, and Britannic race, I believe every impartial scholar will agree with me in thinking a gross misnomer. For if it can be shown that there is a large Celtic element even in the population of England itself, still more unquestionable is this, not only with regard to the populations the British Isles generally, but also with reference to the English-speaking peoples of America and Australasia. Even the English are rather Anglo-Celts than Anglo Saxons; and still more certainly is Anglo-Celtic a more accurate term than Anglo-Saxon, not only for that British nationality which includes the Scots, the Irish and the Welsh; but also for that Britannic race, chief elements in the formation of which have been Welsh, Scottish and Irish immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yE07AAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Arthurian%20localities%3A%20their%20historical%20origin%2C%20chief%20country%20and%20Fingalian%20Relations&amp;pg=PA115#v=onepage&amp;q=Anglo-Celtic&amp;f=false|author=John S. Stuart-Glennie|title=Arthurian localities: their historical origin, chief country and Fingalian Relations|publisher=Edmonston and Douglas|location=Edinburgh|year=1869|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term lends itself to the term ''Anglo-Celtic Isles'', an alternative term for the ''British Isles''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The British Isles|work=Carn|volume=Volumes 88-95|author=Celtic League|publisher=Celtic League|year=1995|page=20|quote=One commonly suggested alternative [to ''the British Isles''] is the "Anglo-Celtic Isles". The "Anglo" and "Celtic" parts are usually understood to be separate from each other. This is a hairsplitting distinction. In practice it would be easy to argue that if Ireland, Mann and Great Britain are Anglo-Celtic Isles their peoples must be Anglo-Celts. This is just another way of saying they are British. The obvious answer is to choose a neutral geographical term that can be understood world-wide as referring to these islands. That rules out vague terms like the 'Atlantic Isles' or the 'European Isles'. The 'North Atlantic Isles' sounds like Newfoundland or Greenland to North American ears, and the 'North Europe Isles' excludes Iceland. We are drawn inevitable to the 'West European Isles' as the simple statement of geographical fact. This is why I believe there is no co-incidence that the Irish and the Manx choose it.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use in this term can be seen in a 1914 [[Unionism (Ireland)|Irish unionist]] ballad:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The United Anglo-Celtic Isles&lt;br/&gt;
Will e'er be blessed by Freedoms smiles&lt;br/&gt;
No tyrant can our homes subdue&lt;br/&gt;
While Britons to the Celts are true.&lt;br/&gt;
The false may clamour to betray&lt;br/&gt;
The brave will still uphold our sway&lt;br/&gt;
The triple-sacred flag as yet&lt;br/&gt;
Supreme, its sun shall never set&lt;br/&gt;
— Southern Unionist Ballad ([[Ennis]] Unionist, 1914)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!--
In 2003 [[Plaid Cymru]] MP [[Adam Price]] suggested that [[Liverpool]] replace [[London]] as the capital of the United Kingdom, describing Liverpool as "an Anglo-Celtic city that's ethnically diverse and infectiously inclusive".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2635393.stm Urging to make Liverpool capital of the UK in January 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

The neo-secessionist [[League of the South]] says that its mission is "to protect the historic Anglo-Celtic core culture of the South because the Scots, Irish, Welsh and English have given [[Dixie]] its unique institutions and civilisation".&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.texasls.org/position_papers/0001pp.shtml The League of the South’s Position on Preserving Traditional Southern Culture]'' from 'Texas League of the South'.

In biology, a '''cline''' (from the Greek ''“klinein”'', meaning ''“to lean”'') is a measurable gradient in a single character (or biological trait) of a species across its [[Range (biology)|geographical range]].&lt;ref name="Huxley"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huxley|first1=Julian|title=Clines: an Auxiliary Taxonomic Principle|journal=Nature|date=30 July 1938|volume=142|issue=3587|pages=219–220|doi=10.1038/142219a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; First coined by [[Julian Huxley]] in 1938, the “character” of the cline referred to is usually genetic (e.g [[allele frequency]], [[blood type]]), or phenotypic (e.g. body size, skin pigmentation). Clines can show smooth, continuous gradation in a character, or they may show more abrupt changes in the trait from one geographic region to the next.&lt;ref name="Endler" /&gt;

A cline refers to a spatial gradient in a specific, singular trait, rather than a gradient in a [[population]] as a whole.&lt;ref name= "Huxley biography"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dronamraju|first1=Krishna R.|last2=Needham|first2=Joseph|title=If I Am To Be Remembered: Correspondence Of Julian Huxley|date=1993|publisher=World Scientific|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xrLsCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT195&amp;lpg=PT195&amp;dq=continuous+discontinuous+clines#v=onepage&amp;q=continuous%20discontinuous%20clines&amp;f=false|isbn=9789814505192}}&lt;/ref&gt; A single population can therefore theoretically have as many clines as it has traits.&lt;ref name="Forest genetics" /&gt; Additionally, Huxley recognised that these multiple independent clines may not act in concordance with each other. For example, it has been observed that in Australia, birds generally become smaller the further towards the north of the country they are found. In contrast, the intensity of their plumage colouration follows a different geographical trajectory, being most vibrant where humidity is highest and becoming less vibrant further into the arid centre of the country.&lt;ref name= "Mayr1963"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mayr|first1=Ernst|title=Populations, species, and evolution: an abridgment of Animal species and evolution|date=1963|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qNGQ_uP5njUC|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Because of this, clines were defined by Huxley as being an “auxiliary taxonomic principle”; that is, clinal variation in a species is not awarded taxonomic recognition in the way [[subspecies]] or [[species]] are.&lt;ref name="Huxley" /&gt;

While the terms “[[ecotype]]” and “cline” are sometimes used interchangeably, they do in fact differ in that “ecotype” refers to a population which differs from other populations in a number of characters, rather than the single character that varies amongst populations in a cline.&lt;ref name="Forest genetics"&gt;{{cite book|last1=White|first1=Timothy L.|last2=Adams|first2=W. T.|last3=Neale|first3=David B.|title=Forest Genetics|date=2007|publisher=CABI Publishing|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UHZCeg4BqtkC&amp;pg=PA190&amp;lpg=PA190&amp;dq=ecotypes+and+clines#v=onepage&amp;q=ecotypes%20and%20clines&amp;f=false|accessdate=28 March 2018|isbn=9781845932862}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drivers and the evolution of clines==
[[File:Gene flow (butterflies).svg|thumb|upright=1|Two populations with individuals moving between the populations to demonstrate gene flow.]]
Clines are often cited to be the result of two opposing drivers: [[Natural selection|selection]] and [[gene flow]] (also known as migration).&lt;ref name="Mayr1963" /&gt; Selection causes [[adaptation]] to the local environment, resulting in different genotypes or phenotypes being favoured in different environments. This diversifying force is countered by gene flow, which has a homogenising effect on populations and prevents [[speciation]] through causing [[genetic admixture]] and blurring any distinct genetic boundaries.&lt;ref name="Mayr1963" /&gt;

===Development of clines===
Clines are generally thought to arise under one of two conditions: “primary differentiation” (also known as "primary contact" or "primary intergradation" ), or “secondary contact” (also known as "secondary introgression", or "secondary intergradation").&lt;ref name="Endler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mayr1942" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Joseph" /&gt;

====Primary differentiation====
[[File:Final Primary Differentiation.svg|thumb|upright=1|Primary differentiation is demonstrated using the peppered moth as an example, with a change in an environmental variable such as sooty coverage of trees imposing a selective pressure on a previously uniformly coloured moth population. This causes the frequency of melanic morphs to increase the more soot there is on vegetation.]]
Clines produced through this way are generated by spatial heterogeneity in environmental conditions. The mechanism of selection acting upon organisms is therefore external. Species ranges frequently span environmental gradients (e.g. humidity, rainfall, temperature, or day length) and, according to natural selection, different environments will favour different [[genotype]]s or [[phenotype]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Darwin|first1=Charles R.|title=On the Origin of Species by means of natural selection, or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life|date=1859|publisher=London: John Murray}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, when previously genetically or phenotypically uniform populations spread into novel environments, they will evolve to be uniquely adapted to the local environment, in the process potentially creating a gradient in a genotypic or phenotypic trait.

Such clines in characters can not be maintained through selection alone if lots of gene flow occurred between populations, as this would tend to swamp out the effects of local adaptation. However, because species usually tend to have a limited dispersal range (e.g. in an [[isolation by distance]] model), restricted gene flow can serve as a type of barrier which encourages geographic differentiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wright|first1=Sewall|title=Isolation by Distance|journal=Genetics|date=1943|volume=28|issue=2|pages=114–138|pmc=1209196|pmid=17247074}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some degree of migration is often required to maintain a cline; without it, [[speciation]] is likely to eventually occur, as local adaptation can cause reproductive isolation between populations.&lt;ref name="Endler" /&gt;

A classic example of the role of environmental gradients in creating clines is that of the peppered moth, [[Peppered moth|''Biston betularia'']], in the UK. During the 19th century, when the industrial sector gained traction, coal emissions blackened vegetation across northwest England and parts of northern Wales. As a result of this, lighter [[morph (zoology)|morph]]s of the moth were more visible to predators against the blackened tree trunks and were therefore more heavily predated relative to the darker morphs. Consequently, the frequency of the more [[Crypsis|cryptic]] melanic morph of the peppered moth increased drastically in northern England. This cline in morph colour, from a dominance of lighter morphs in the west of England (which did not suffer as heavily from pollution), to the higher frequency of melanic forms in the north, has slowly been degrading since limitations to sooty emissions were introduced in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saccheri|first1=Illik J.|last2=Rousset|first2=Francois|last3=Watts|first3=Phillip C.|last4=Brakefield|first4=Paul M.|last5=Cook|first5=Laurence M.|title=Selection and gene flow on a diminishing cline of melanic peppered moths|journal=PNAS|date=2008|volume=105|issue=42|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Secondary contact====
{{main|Secondary contact}}
[[File:Secondary Introgression.svg|thumb|upright=1|Secondary contact between two previously isolated populations. Two previously isolated populations establish contact and therefore gene flow, creating an intermediate zone in the phenotypic or genotypic character between the two populations.]] 
Clines generated through this mechanism have arisen through the joining of two formerly isolated populations which differentiated in [[allopatric speciation|allopatry]], creating an intermediate zone. This secondary contact scenario may occur, for example, when climatic conditions change, allowing the ranges of populations to expand and meet.&lt;ref name="Mayr1942" /&gt; Because over time the effect of gene flow will tend to eventually swamp out any regional differences and cause one large homogenous population, for a stable cline to be maintained when two populations join there must usually be a selective pressure maintaining a degree of differentiation between the two populations.&lt;ref name="Endler" /&gt;

The mechanism of selection maintaining the clines in this scenario is often intrinsic. This means that the fitness of individuals is independent of the external environment, and selection is instead dependent on the genome of the individual. Intrinsic, or endogenous, selection can give rise to clines in characters though a variety of mechanisms. One way it may act is through [[heterozygote]] disadvantage, in which intermediate genotypes have a lower relative fitness than either homozygote genotypes. Because of this disadvantage, one allele will tend to become fixed in a given population, such that populations will consist largely of either ''AA'' ([[homozygote|homozygous]] dominant) or ''aa'' (homozygous recessive) individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bazykin|first1=A. D.|title=Hypothetical Mechanism of Speciation|journal=Evolution|date=1969|volume=23|issue=4|pages=685–687|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.1969.tb03550.x|pmid=28562864}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cline of heterozygotes that is created when these respective populations come into contact is then shaped by the opposing forces of selection and gene flow; even if selection against heterozygotes is great, if there is some degree of gene flow between the two populations, then a steep cline may be able to be maintained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fitzpatrick|first1=Benjamin M.|title=Alternative forms for genomic clines|journal=Ecology and Evolution|date=July 2013|volume=3|issue=7|pages=1951–1966|doi=10.1002/ece3.609|pmid=23919142|pmc=3728937}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Richard1993"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harrison|first1=Richard G.|title=Hybrid Zones and the Evolutionary Process|date=1993|publisher=Oxford Univserity Press|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aFJFkVKskYIC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;dq=frequency+dependent+selection+clines#v=onepage&amp;q=frequency%20dependent%20selection%20clines&amp;f=true|accessdate=17 April 2018|isbn=9780195069174}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Because instrinsic selection is independent of the external environment, clines generated by selection against hybrids are not fixed to any given geographical area and can move around the geographic landscape.&lt;ref name="EoE" /&gt; Such [[hybrid zone]]s where hybrids are a disadvantage relative to their parental lines (but which are nonetheless maintained through selection being counteracted by gene flow) are known as “tension zones”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bazykin|first1=A. D.|title=Hypothetical Mechanism of Speciaton|journal=Evolution|date=December 1969|volume=23|issue=4|pages=685–687|doi=10.2307/2406862|pmid=28562864|jstor=2406862}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way in which selection can generate clines is through [[frequency-dependent selection]]. Characters that could be maintained by such frequency-dependent selective pressures include warning signals ([[aposematism]]). For example, aposematic signals in ''[[Heliconius]]'' butterflies sometimes display steep clines between populations, which are maintained through [[Frequency-dependent selection#Positive|positive frequency dependence]].&lt;ref name="Richard1993" /&gt; This is because heterozygosity, [[mutation]]s and [[Genetic recombination|recombination]] can all produce patterns that deviate from those well-established signals which mark prey as being unpalatable. These individuals are then predated more heavily relative to their counterparts with "normal" markings (i.e. selected against), creating populations dominated by a particular  pattern of warning signal. As with heterozygote disadvantage, when these populations join, a narrow cline of intermediate individuals could be produced, maintained by gene flow counteracting selection.&lt;ref name="Richard1993" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mallet|first1=James|last2=Barton|first2=Nicholas H.|title=Strong natural selection in a warning-colour hybrid zone|journal=Evolution|date=1989|volume=43|issue=2|jstor=2409217|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondary contact  could lead to a cline with a steep gradient if heterozygote disadvantage or frequency-dependent selection exists, as intermediates are heavily selected against. Alternatively, steep clines could exist because the populations have only recently established secondary contact, and the character in the original allopatric populations had a large degree of differentiation. As genetic admixture between the population increases with time however, the steepness of the cline is likely to decrease as the difference in character is eroded. However, if the character in the original allopatric populations was not very differentiated to begin with, the cline between the populations need not display a very steep gradient.&lt;ref name="Endler" /&gt; Because both primary differentiation and secondary contact can therefore give rise to similar or identical clinal patterns (e.g. gently sloping clines), distinguishing which of these two processes is responsible for generating a cline is difficult and often impossible.&lt;ref name="Endler" /&gt; However, in some circumstances a cline and a geographic variable (such as humidity) may be very tightly linked, with a change in one corresponding closely to a change in the other. In such cases it may be tentatively concluded that the cline is generated by primary differentiation and therefore moulded by environmental selective pressures.&lt;ref name="Joseph" /&gt;

====No selection (drift/migration balance)====
While selection can therefore clearly play a key role in creating clines, it is theoretically feasible that they might be generated by [[genetic drift]] alone. It is unlikely that large-scale clines in genotype or phenotype frequency will be produced solely by drift. However, across smaller geographical scales and in smaller populations, drift could produce temporary clines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Futuyma|first1=Douglas|title=Evolution|date=2005|publisher=Sinauer Associates}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that drift is a weak force upholding the cline however means that clines produced this way are often random (i.e uncorrelated with environmental variables) and subject to breakdown or reversal over time.&lt;ref name="Endler" /&gt; Such clines are therefore unstable and sometimes called “transient clines”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Polechová|first1=Jitka|last2=Barton|first2=Nick|title=Genetic Drift Widens the Expected Cline but Narrows the Expected Cline Width|journal=Genetics|date=September 2011|volume=189|issue=1|pages=227–235|doi=10.1534/genetics.111.129817|pmid=21705747|pmc=3176109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinal structure and terminology==
[[File:Character-Cline Diagram.svg|thumb|upright=1|Clinal characters change from one end of the geographic range to another. The extent of this change is reflected in the slope of the cline.]]
The steepness, or gradient, of a cline reflects the extent of the differentiation in the character across a geographic range.&lt;ref name="Endler"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Endler|first1=John A.|title=Geographic Variation, Speciation, and Clines|date=1977|publisher=Princeton University Press|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BL12fYUMobwC&amp;dq=rassenkreis+cline|isbn=978-0691081922}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a steep cline could indicate large variation in the colour of plumage between adjacent bird populations. It has been previously outlined that such steep clines may be the result of two previously allopatric populations with a large degree of difference in the trait having only recently established gene flow, or where there is strong selection against hybrids. However, it may also reflect a sudden environmental change or boundary. Examples of rapidly changing environmental boundaries like this include abrupt changes in the heavy metal content of soils, and the consequent narrow clines produced between populations of ''[[Agrostis]]'' that are either adapted to these soils with high metal content, or adapted to "normal" soil.&lt;ref name="Endler" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jain|first1=S K|last2=Bradshaw|first2=A D|title=Evolutionary divergence among adjacent plant populations I. The evidence and its theoretical analysis|journal=Heredity|date=1 August 1966|volume=21|issue=3|pages=407–441|doi=10.1038/hdy.1966.42}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Conversely, a shallow cline indicates little geographical variation in the character or trait across a given geographical distance. This may have arisen through weak differential environmental selective pressure, or where two populations established secondary contact a long time ago and gene flow has eroded the large character differentiation between the populations.

The gradient of a cline is related to another commonly referred to property, clinal width. A cline with a steep slope is said to have a small, or narrow, width, while shallower clines have larger widths.&lt;ref name="Joseph"&gt;{{cite book|title=Numerical Taxonomy|last1=Felsenstein|first1=Joseph|date=2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BW7tCAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=cline+slope+steepness|isbn=9783642690242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of clines==
[[File:Clinal Variation by Huxley.svg|thumb|upright=1|Categories and subcategories of clines, as defined by Huxley.]]
According to Huxley, clines can be classified into two categories; continuous clines and discontinuous stepped clines.&lt;ref name="Huxley" /&gt; These types of clines characterise the way that a genetic or phenotypic trait transforms from one end of its geographical range of the species to the other. 

===Continuous clines===
In continuous clines, all populations of the species are able to interbreed and there is gene flow throughout the entire range of the species. In this way, these clines are both biologically (no clear subgroups) and geographically (contiguous distribution) continuous. 
Continuous clines can be further sub-divided into smooth and stepped clines. 
*Continuous smooth clines are characterised by the lack of any abrupt changes or delineation in the genetic or phenotypic trait across the cline, instead displaying a smooth gradation throughout. Huxley recognised that this type of cline, with its uniform slope throughout, was unlikely to be common. 
*Continuous stepped clines consist of an overall shallow cline, interspersed by sections of much steeper slope. The shallow slope represents the populations, and the shorter, steeper sections the larger change in character between populations.&lt;ref name="hedrick"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hedrick|first1=Philip|title=Genetics of Populations|date=2011|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stepped clines can be further subdivided into horizontally stepped clines, and obliquely stepped clines. 
**Horizontally stepped clines show no intra-population variation or gradation in the character, therefore displaying a horizontal gradient. These uniform populations are connected by steeper sections of the cline, characterised by larger changes in the form of the character. However, because in continuous clines all populations exchange genetic material, the intergradation zone between the groups can never have a vertical slope.&lt;ref name="hedrick" /&gt; 
**In obliquely stepped clines, conversely, each population also demonstrates a cline in the character, albeit of a shallower slope than the clines connecting the populations together. Huxley compared obliquely stepped clines to looking like a “stepped ramp”, rather than taking on the formation of a staircase as in the case of horizontally stepped clines.&lt;ref name="Huxley biography" /&gt;

===Discontinuous stepped clines===
Unlike in continuous clines, in discontinuous clines the populations of species are allopatric, meaning there is very little or no gene flow amongst populations. The genetic or phenotypic trait in question always shows a steeper gradient between groups than within groups, as in continuous clines. Discontinuous clines follow the same principles as continuous clines by displaying either
*Horizontally stepped clines, where intra-group variation is very small or non-existent and the geographic space separating groups shows a sharp change in character
*Obliquely stepped clines, where there is some intra-group gradation, but this is less than the gradation in the character between populations&lt;ref name="Huxley" /&gt;

==Clines and speciation==
[[File:Parapatric Speciation Schematic.svg|thumb|upright=1|[[Parapatric speciation]]]]
It was originally assumed that geographic isolation was a necessary precursor to speciation ([[allopatric speciation]]).&lt;ref name="Mayr1942"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mayr|first1=Ernst|title=Systematics and the Origin of Species from the viewpoint of a zoologist|date=1942|publisher=Columbia University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility that clines may be a precursor to speciation was therefore ignored, as they were assumed to be evidence of the fact that in contiguous populations gene flow was too strong a force of homogenisation, and selection too weak a force of differentiation, for speciation to take place.&lt;ref name="Endler" /&gt; However, the existence of particular types of clines, such as [[ring species]], in which populations did not differentiate in allopatry but the terminal ends of the cline nonetheless do not interbreed, cast into doubt whether complete geographical isolation of populations is an absolute requirement for speciation.

Because clines can exist in populations connected by some degree of gene flow, the generation of new species from a previously clinal population is termed [[parapatric speciation]]. Both extrinsic and intrinsic selection can serve to generate varying degrees of [[reproductive isolation]] and thereby instigate the process of [[speciation]]. For example, through environmental selection acting on populations and favouring particular allele frequencies, large genetic differences between populations may accumulate (this would be reflected in clinal structure by the presence of numerous very steep clines). If the local genetic differences are great enough, it may lead unfavourable combinations of genotypes and therefore to hybrids being at a decreased fitness relative to the parental lines. When this hybrid disadvantage is great enough, natural selection will select for [[Reproductive isolation#Pre-zygotic isolation|pre-zygotic]] traits in the homozygous parental lines that reduce the likelihood of disadvantageous hybridisation - in other words, natural selection will favour traits that promote assortative mating in the parental lines.&lt;ref name="EoE"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jorgensen|first1=Sven|last2=Fath|first2=Brian|title=Encyclopaedia of Ecology|date=2014|publisher=Newnes}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is known as [[Reinforcement (speciation)|reinforcement]] and plays an important role in parapatric and [[sympatric speciation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coyne|first1=Jerry A.|last2=Orr|first2=H. Allen|title=Speciation|date=2004|publisher=Sinauer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Endler" /&gt;

==Clinal maps==
Clines can be portrayed graphically on maps using lines that show the transition in character state from one end of the geographic range to the other. Character states can however additionally be represented using isophenes, defined by Ernst Mayr as “lines of equal expression of a clinally varying character”.&lt;ref name="Mayr1963" /&gt; In other words, areas on maps that demonstrate the same biological phenomenon or character will be connected by something that resembles a contour line. When mapping clines therefore, which follow a character gradation from one extreme to the other, isophenes will transect clinal lines at a right angle.

==Examples of clines==
[[File:Northern red fox &amp; southern desert red fox.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Bergmann's Rule demonstrated showing the difference in size between a larger northern fox, whose range spans colder regions, and a smaller desert fox, whose range is primarily in hot regions.]]
Although the term “cline” was first officially coined by Huxley in 1938, gradients and geographic variations in the character states of species have been observed for centuries. Indeed, some gradations have been considered so ubiquitous that they have been labelled [[Biological rules|ecological “rules”]]. One commonly cited example of a gradient in morphology is [[Gloger's rule|Gloger's Rule]], named after [[C. L. Gloger|Constantin Gloger]], who observed in 1833 that environmental factors and the pigmentation of avian [[plumage]] tend to covary with each other, such that birds found in arid areas near the Equator tend to be much darker than those in less arid areas closer to the Poles.  Since then, this rule has been extended to include many other animals, including flies, butterflies, and wolves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huggett|first1=Richard J.|title=Fundamentals of Biogeography|date=2004|publisher=Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other ecogeographical rules include [[Bergmann’s rule|Bergmann's Rule]], coined by [[Carl Bergmann (anatomist)|Carl Bergmann]] in 1857, which states that [[Homeothermy|homeotherms]] closer to the Equator tend to be smaller than their more northerly or southerly conspecifics.&lt;ref name="Wool" /&gt; One of the proposed reasons for this cline is that larger animals have a relatively smaller surface area to volume ratio and therefore improved heat conservancy – an important advantage in cold climates.&lt;ref name="Wool"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wool|first1=David|title=The Driving Forces of Evolution: Genetic Processes in Populations|date=2006|publisher=CRC Press|page=163|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ydWuuBw6xeYC&amp;dq=huxley+1942+cline|isbn=9781578084456}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of the environment in imposing a selective pressure and producing this cline has been heavily implicated due to the fact that Bergmann’s Rule has been observed across many independent lineages of species and continents. For example, the [[house sparrow]], which was introduced in the early 1850s to the eastern United States, evolved a north-south gradient in size soon after its introduction. This gradient reflects the gradient that already existed in the house sparrow’s native range in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huggett|first1=Richard J.|title=Geoecology: An evolutionary approach|date=1995|publisher=Routledge|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Geoecology.html?id=VyQjwI9UkVIC|isbn=9780415086899}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ring species]]&lt;ref&gt;''Fundamentals of biogeography'', Richard J. Huggett, 2nd ed. (2004), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; are a distinct type of cline where the geographical distribution in question is circular in shape, so that the two ends of the cline overlap with one another, giving two adjacent populations that rarely [[Hybrid (biology)|interbreed]] due to the cumulative effect of the many changes in phenotype along the cline. The populations elsewhere along the cline interbreed with their geographically adjacent populations as in a standard cline. In the case of ''[[Larus]]'' gulls, the habitats of the end populations even overlap, which introduces questions as to what constitutes a species: nowhere along the cline can a line be drawn between the populations, but they are unable to interbreed.&lt;ref name="Larus"&gt;''[[Larus]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In humans, clines in the frequency of blood types has allowed scientists to infer past population migrations. For example, the Type B blood group reaches its highest frequency in Asia, but become less frequent further west. From this, it has been possible to infer that some Asian populations migrated towards Europe around 2,000 years ago, causing genetic admixture in an [[isolation by distance]] model. In contrast to this cline, blood Type A shows the reverse pattern, reaching its highest frequency in Europe and declining in frequency towards Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Birx|first1=H. James|title=Encyclopaedia of Anthropology|date=2006|publisher=SAGE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''compact state''' in the political geography context is a state (country) in which the distance from the center to any boundary does not vary significantly.

Compact states are one of six different shapes for states&lt;ref&gt;De Blij, Harm. J. &amp; Muller, Peter. O. (2010) "Global Geography", p. 528. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. Hoboken. {{ISBN|9780470553039}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are never perfect circles. The benefits of these states are that, controlling for everything else, they are easiest to defend as they have the smallest possible perimeter and they are effective with communication and transportation. Modern examples of compact states include: [[Zimbabwe]], [[Lesotho]], [[Cambodia]], [[Botswana]], [[Poland]], [[Montenegro]].

'''The Danube Promenade''' ({{lang-hu|Dunakorzó}}) is located on the [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]] side of [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]. On the bank of the [[Danube]], this [[promenade]] extends from the [[Széchenyi Chain Bridge]] to the [[Erzsébet Bridge]].
[[Image:kepregidunaparticorso2.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Old Danube Promenade, [[Széchenyi Chain Bridge]], the "new" [[Erzsébet Bridge]], [[Gellért Hill]]]]

== History ==
A row of hotels on the bank of the Danube began to be built in 1867: these were the Hungaria (1867 A. Skalinczky), Bristol, Carlton, and Ritz (Danube Palace). In 1945 at the end of [[World War II]], only the Bristol (Danube Hotel) survived the destruction of the row of hotels on the bank of the Danube. In 1969 the final form of the Bristol Hotel was demolished.

== Buildings and architecture ==
Buildings and landmarks in the promenade include:

*[[Belváros (Budapest)]]
*[[Contra-Aquincum]] (see also [[Pannonia]] or Hungarian: [[:hu:Contra-Aquincum]]) - a 4th-century Roman castle near [[Erzsébet Bridge]]
*[[Gresham-palota]] near to [[Széchenyi Chain Bridge]]
*[[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] near to [[Széchenyi Chain Bridge]]
*[[Vigadó Concert Hall]]

In the midst of boxes of glass hotels is the eccentric [[Neo-Byzantine]] [[Vigadó Concert Hall]], which survived the building boom of the late 1960s. Behind the Vigadó is the local hub of the city, Vörösmarty tér, named after the 19th-century poet [[Mihály Vörösmarty]]. The traditional [[Café Gerbeaud|Gerbeaud]] coffeehouse has long been a great [[people watching]] spot. Váci utca and environs is the area for chic clothing, used books, folk art and sidewalk cafés. Further along the promenade is Március 15 tér, where the remains of a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[bastion]], [[Contra-Aquincum]], were discovered, The Inner City Parish Church’s simple exterior conceals a colorful past: it began as a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] basilica, was used as a mosque and was finally reconceived in the [[Baroque]] style in the 18th century.

&lt;/ref&gt; (DOQ) is [[aerial photography]] or [[satellite imagery]] that has been corrected so that its [[pixels]] are aligned with [[longitude]] and [[latitude]] lines, and have a narrowly defined region of coverage. This is a widely used format introduced by [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS).&lt;ref name="USGS" /&gt; The correction technique is called [[image rectification]] and is a large part of [[photogrammetry]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

DOQs produced by the USGS cover an area measuring 7.5-minutes longitude by 7.5-minutes latitude (the same area covered by a USGS 1:24,000-scale [[topographic map]], also known as a 7.5-minute [[quadrangle (geography)|quadrangle]]) or 3.75-minutes by 3.75-minutes. The second format is also known as a '''digital orthophoto quarter quadrangle''' (DOQQ) because each covers one quarter of a quadrangle (four 1:12,000-scale DOQQs display the same area as one 1:24,000-scale DOQ).&lt;ref&gt;

Baron '''Ferdinand [[Freiherr]] von Richthofen''' [[Royal Society of London|FRSFor]] H[[FRSE]] BGS (5 May 1833{{snd}}6 October 1905), better known in English as {{nowrap|'''Baron von Richthofen''',}} was a [[Germany|German]] traveller, [[geographer]], and [[scientist]]. He is noted for coining the terms "Seidenstraße" and "Seidenstraßen" = "[[Silk Road]](s)" or "Silk Route(s)" in 1877.&lt;ref name=Elisseeff&gt;"Approaches Old and New to the Silk Roads" Vadime Elisseeff in: ''The Silk Roads: Highways of Culture and Commerce''. Paris (1998) UNESCO, Reprint: Berghahn Books (2000), pp. 1-2. {{ISBN|92-3-103652-1}}; {{ISBN|1-57181-221-0}}; {{ISBN|1-57181-222-9}} (pbk)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Waugh&gt;Waugh, Daniel. (2007). "Richthofen's "Silk Roads": Toward the Archaeology of a Concept." ''The Silk Road''. Volume 5, Number 1, Summer 2007, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; He also standardized the practices of [[chorography]] and [[chorology]]. He was an uncle of the [[World War I]] flying ace [[Manfred von Richthofen]], best known as the "[[Red Baron]]".

==Biography==
He was born in [[Pokój|Carlsruhe]], at that time in [[Prussian Silesia]], and was educated in the Roman Catholic Gymnasium in [[Breslau]].

He studied Medicine at the [[University of Wrocław|University of Breslau]] and at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]]. He traveled or studied in the [[Alps]] of [[county of Tyrol|Tyrol]] and the [[Carpathians]] in [[Transylvania]]. In 1860, he joined the [[Eulenburg Expedition]], a [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] expedition which visited [[Ceylon]], [[Japan]], [[Taiwan]], [[Sulawesi|Celebes]], [[Java (island)|Java]], the [[Philippines]], [[Siam]], [[Burma]] between 1860 and 1862. No important work resulted from these travels, for much of Richthofen's records and collections was lost. China was at the time inaccessible owing to the [[Taiping rebellion]], but Richthofen was impressed with the desirability of exploring it.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Richthofen, Ferdinand |volume=23 |page=314}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1862 to 1868, he worked as a geologist in the [[United States]], discovering [[gold mining|goldfield]]s in [[California]]. He then followed up his interest in [[Qing Dynasty|China]] by several more trips there, and also to [[Japan]], [[Burma]], and [[Java]]. In China he located the dried-up lake bed of [[Lopnur]].

He published his geographical, geological, economic, and ethnological findings in three volumes with an atlas, which, however, did not cover the entire field or complete the author's plan. This work appeared at Berlin in 1877-85 under the title of ''China; Ergebnisse eigner Reisen und darauf gegründeter Studien''. In this standard work, the author deals not only with geology but with every subject necessary to a general geographical treatise. Notably he paid close attention to the economic resources of the country he traversed. He also wrote a valuable series of letters to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, and first drew attention to the importance of the coalfields of Shantung, and of Kiaochow as a port.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

He was appointed professor of [[geology]] at the [[University of Bonn]] beginning in 1875, but being fully occupied with his work in China he did not take up professorial duties until 1879. He became professor of [[geography]] at the [[University of Leipzig]] in 1883, and professor of geography at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich Wilhelm University of Berlin]] in 1886. He occupied the latter position until his death. His lectures attracted numerous students who subsequently became eminent in geographical work, and in order to keep in touch with them he established his weekly geographical “colloquium.” Among his most famous students was [[Sven Hedin]], the Swedish explorer. He served as president of the German Geographical Society for many years and founded the Berlin Hydrographical Institute.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

He is noted for coining the terms "Seidenstraße" and "Seidenstraßen" = "[[Silk Road]](s)" or "Silk Route(s)" in 1877.&lt;ref name=Elisseeff/&gt;&lt;ref name=Waugh/&gt; He also standardized the practices of [[chorography]] and [[chorology]].

He died in 1905 in Berlin.

==Anecdotes==
When [[William Gill (explorer)|William Gill]] consulted him about a planned trip to China, he remarked:
{{cquote|Hour after hour he gave up his valuable time to me, and opened volumes from his rich store of information. … Baron von Richthofen possesses in a remarkable manner the faculty of gathering up the details presented to his view; putting them together and generalising on them with rare judgement; forming out of what would be to a lesser genius, but scattered and unintelligible fragments, a uniform and comprehensive whole … not one hint was given me that did not subsequently prove its value; his kind thoughts for my comfort and amusement were never ceasing, and his refined and cultivated intellect and genial manner rendered the recollections of my stay in the German capital some of the most pleasant of my life.}}

The mountain range on the southern edge of the [[Hexi Corridor]] in western China was named [[Richthofen Range]] after him, although the modern name is now [[Qilian Mountains]].  The 12940&amp;nbsp;ft. [[Mount Richthofen]] in [[Rocky Mountain National Park]] is also named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url =  https://books.google.com/books?id=RqIJGW5OoaIC&amp;pg=PA50 | isbn = 978-0-9671466-0-7 | author =  edited by Randy Jacobs, with Robert M.

The '''Frisian Islands''', also known as the '''Wadden Islands''' or the '''Wadden Sea Islands''', form an [[archipelago]] at the eastern edge of the [[North Sea]] in northwestern [[Europe]], stretching from the northwest of the [[Netherlands]] through [[Germany]] to the west of [[Denmark]]. The islands shield the [[mudflat]] region of the [[Wadden Sea]] (large parts of which fall dry during low tide) from the [[North Sea]].

The Frisian Islands, along with the mainland coast in the [[German Bight]], form the region of [[Frisia]] (German and Dutch: ''Friesland''), [[homeland]] of the [[Frisian people]]. Generally, the term Frisian Islands is used for the islands where [[Frisian languages|Frisian]] is spoken and the population is ethnically Frisian. In contrast, the term [[Wadden Islands]] applies to the entire archipelago, including the [[Dutch language|Dutch]]-speaking westernmost islands of [[Texel]] and [[Vlieland]] and [[Danish language|Danish]]-speaking [[Danish Wadden Sea Islands]] further north off the west coast of [[Jutland]].

Most of the Frisian Islands are environmentally protected areas, and an international [[wildlife]] [[nature reserve]] is being coordinated between the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark. [[Natural gas]] and [[crude oil|oil]] drilling continue, however, and in the vicinity of the [[Ems (river)|Ems]], [[Weser]] and [[Elbe]] [[estuary|estuaries]], and [[ship]] [[traffic]] causes tension between wildlife protection and economic values.

==Origins==
During the last [[ice age]], which ended approximately 12,000 years ago, sea level was about {{convert|60|m|ft}} lower than it is now, and part of what is now the North Sea was dry land. With the melting of the ice caps, the sea level rose, reaching the current coast line around the beginning of the [[Holocene]] era, approximately 7,000 years ago. Tidal action transported large quantities of sand to form a line of dunes extending over {{convert|500|km|mi}} from the Netherlands to the mouth of the river [[Elbe]] in Germany. The sea broke through the dunes in many places to form the Wadden Islands, with the low-lying country behind becoming the tidal Wadden [[mudflat]]s.

===Island forming===
The Dutch [[West Frisian Islands|West Frisian]] and the German [[East Frisian Islands]] are [[barrier island]]s.&lt;ref Name="Velde"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; They arose along the breakers' edge where the water surge piled up sediment, and behind which sediment was carried away by the breaking waves. Over time, [[shoal]]s arose, which ultimately were only covered by infrequent storm floods.&lt;ref Name="Velde"/&gt; Once plants began to colonize the sandbanks, the land began to stabilize.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

In contrast, the [[North Frisian Islands]] arose from the remains of old [[Geest (topography)|Geestland]] islands, where the land was partially removed by storm floods and water action and then separated from the mainland. They are, therefore, often higher and their cores are less exposed to changes than the islands to the south. Beyond the core, however, the same processes are at work, as is particularly evident on [[Sylt]], where the south of the island threatens to be broken away and the [[harbour]] at [[List (village)|List]] in the north silts up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

The Danish Islands, the next in the chain to the north, arose from sandbanks. Into the 20th century, silt on the islands was a serious problem. To protect them, small woods were planted.

==Habitation==
Long before the beginning of the modern era, there were already humans inhabiting the Wadden area. Up to 800 AD, most inhabitants lived on [[Artificial dwelling hill|terpen]] (artificial mounds). Living conditions were difficult. The Roman naturalist [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], writing in the first century AD, described the Frisians as ...

&lt;blockquote&gt;
... people who live without trees or shrubs. ... in the east, to the coasts of the ocean, a number of races in such needy conditions exist; but this also applies to the races of peoples which are called the large and small Chaucen, which we have seen in the north. There, two times in each period of a day and a night, the ocean with a fast tide submerges an immense plain, thereby the hiding ... whether the area is sea or land. There this miserable race inhabits raised pieces ground or platforms, which they have moored by hand above the level of the highest known tide. Living in huts built on the chosen spots, they seem like sailors in ships if water covers the surrounding country, but like shipwrecked people when the tide has withdrawn itself, and around their huts they catch fish which try to escape with the expiring tide. It is for them not possible to keep herds and live on milk such as the surrounding tribes. They cannot even fight with wild animals, because all the bush country lies too far away. They braid ropes of sedges and rushes from the marshes with which they make nets to be able to catch fish, and they dig up mud with their hands and dry it more in wind than in the sun, and with soil as fuel they heat their food and their own bodies, frozen in northern wind. Their only drink comes from storing rain water in tanks front of their houses. And these are the races which, if they were now conquered by the Roman nation, say that they will fall into slavery! It is only too true: Destiny saves people as a punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Around 1000, [[Levee|dike]] construction began. Monks were instrumental in this activity, among others those of the monastery of [[Aduard]]. But earlier attempts had been undertaken to dam the sea. At the Frisian [[Peins]] (near [[Franeker]]), a 40-meter section of dike has been discovered that is thought to date from the 1st or 2nd century BC.

In the late [[Middle Ages]], the dike system was gradually strengthened and flooding diminished. Beginning in the 17th century, dikes were built further out to reclaim more land. This activity peaked in the 19th and 20th centuries.

==Conservation of the West Frisian/Dutch coast==
The dunes south of the Wadden Sea were also liable to this process, but human intervention prevented the many storm surges from changing the coast of the provinces [[North Holland]] and [[South Holland]] into separate islands with Wadden mudflats behind them. However, around 1200, storm surges did break up the northern coast of Western Friesland into five islands. Around 1600, four of these along the West coast had been again recovered, but [[Wieringen]], to the south-east of [[Texel]], remained an island up to the 20th century.

==Embankment of the mudflat==
In [[Friesland]] and [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]] plans were made to embank and drain the Wadden Sea. As a result, the islands would have become part of the mainland. As of today, nature and environmental movements have been able to prevent this.

The only plan ever to be carried out was the construction of a causeway from the Frisian [[Holwerd]] to [[Ameland]], in 1872, which was not very successful. Shortly after construction, the causeway had already suffered so much storm damage that the dam was abandoned in 1882. The dam has been almost entirely eroded since then.

In the northern Wadden Sea building dams proved to be considerably simpler. [[Nordstrand, Germany|Nordstrand]] is now so much linked to the rampart by dikes that it is difficult to define it as an island, and also [[Langeness]], [[Oland (Frisian island)|Oland]], [[Nordstrandischmoor]], [[Hamburger Hallig]], [[Sylt]], and [[Rømø]] are all reachable by dams. [[Mandø]] is even reachable without a dam by means of tidal road.

==Development==

===Migration===
The Wadden Islands are in continuous apparent movement. The most important movement is the 'migration': the islands themselves are slowly but certainly moving from West to East. On the West side most of the islands disappear slowly into the sea and on the East side even larger sand-banks arise. This movement is also the reason that most of the villages themselves are on the West side of their island. When they were founded they were situated in the center. Over the course of the last few centuries, many houses and even entire villages disappeared into the sea.

===Hook shaping===
The second movement is the development of a hook shape. Along the sea breaches hook-shaped sand ridges arise, which change form with the moving of the sea arm. By growth of these hooks new shoals arise such as the [[Noorder]] and [[Zuiderhaaks]]. Sometimes such a shoal grows, originating where an island has been 'walking', and the island regains area.

==Islands==

===Dutch Wadden Islands===
{{See also|West Frisian Islands}}
(from West to East)

====Inhabited====
*[[Texel]] (largest and most populous of all the Frisian/Wadden Islands)
*[[Vlieland]]
*[[Terschelling]]
*[[Ameland]]
*[[Schiermonnikoog (island and municipality)|Schiermonnikoog]]

The Dutch islands have a surface of 405.2&amp;nbsp;km² and a total of 23,872 inhabitants.

====Uninhabited====
*[[Noorderhaaks]]
*[[Richel]]
*[[Griend]]
*[[Rif (island)|Rif]]
*[[Engelsmanplaat]]
*[[Simonszand]]
*[[Rottumerplaat]]
*[[Rottumeroog]]
*[[Zuiderduintjes]]

The names of all these places suggest this is the transition area between island and shoal (''plaat'' in Dutch). Noorderhaaks, Rottumerplaat and Rottumeroog are generally considered to be islands, the others are considered to be sandbars and disappear from time to time into the waves. The former island of [[Wieringen]] can be found at the top of [[Noord-Holland]], against the [[Afsluitdijk]].

The German islands have a surface of 448.52&amp;nbsp;km² (173 sq. mi.) and 53,296 inhabitants. It is possible to make a boat excursion from several German Wadden Islands to the small rock island of [[Helgoland]] which is situated {{convert|70|km|0|abbr=on}} off the German coast. Although Heligoland (German: Helgoland) is not a Wadden Island, there are strong cultural links with the Wadden area; for example a [[Heligolandic|dialect of North Frisian]] is spoken there.

Not all these islands are officially considered to be Wadden Islands. For the definition of an island, a minimum of 160 hectares (0.6 sq. mi.) must no longer be submerged during average high water by the North Sea.

===Danish Wadden Islands===
{{See also|Danish Wadden Sea Islands}}
(from South to North)
*[[Rømø]]
*[[Mandø]]
*[[Koresand]] (uninhabited)
*[[Fanø]]
*[[Langli]] (uninhabited)

In the 20th century, south of the Danish island Rømø lay the small island [[Jordsand]], which sank in 1999. North of the Danish island Fanø the sand coast has been opened and closed numerous times in the course of history, but at the moment the coast line is closed, and forms a whole again except for two west coast fjords. The Danish islands have a total surface of 193.8&amp;nbsp;km² (74.5 sq. mi.) and 4,173 inhabitants.

'''[[Gabon]]''' is a country in [[West Africa]], lying along the [[Atlantic Ocean]], just south of the [[Bight of Biafra]].

==Borders==
Gabon has a total of 3,261&amp;nbsp;km of international boundaries. It borders [[Equatorial Guinea]] (335&amp;nbsp;km) and [[Cameroon]] (349&amp;nbsp;km) to the north and the [[Republic of the Congo]] (2,567&amp;nbsp;km) to the east and south. Gabon lies on the [[equator]].
; Maritime claims:
:* Territorial sea: {{Convert|12|nmi|km|abbr=on}}
:* Contiguous zone: {{Convert|24|nmi|km|abbr=on|lk=in}}
:* Exclusive economic zone: {{Convert|200|nmi|km|abbr=on}}

==Climate==
Gabon has the moist, hot climate typical of tropical regions. The hottest month is January, with an average high at Libreville of 31&amp;nbsp;°C and an average low of 23&amp;nbsp;°C. Average July temperatures in the capital range between 20 and 28&amp;nbsp;°C. From June to September there is virtually no rain but high humidity; there is occasional rain in December and January. During the remaining months, rainfall is heavy. The excessive rainfall is caused by the condensation of moist air resulting from the meeting, directly off the coast, of the cold Benguela Current from the south and the warm Guinea Current from the north. At Libreville, the average annual rainfall is more than 2540&amp;nbsp;mm. Farther north on the coast, it is 3810&amp;nbsp;mm.

The left pattern is produced by head/tail breaks, while the right one by natural breaks, also known as [[Jenks natural breaks optimization]].]]
'''Head/tail breaks''' is a [[clustering algorithm]] scheme for data with a heavy-tailed distribution such as [[power laws]] and [[lognormal distribution]]s. The heavy-tailed distribution can be simply referred to the scaling pattern of far more small things than large ones, or alternatively numerous smallest, a very few largest, and some in between the smallest and largest. The classification is done through dividing things into large (or called the head) and small (or called the tail) things around the arithmetic mean or average, and then recursively going on for the division process for the large things or the head until the notion of far more small things than large ones is no longer valid, or with more or less similar things left only.&lt;ref name="Jiang1"&gt;Jiang, Bin (2013). "Head/tail breaks: A new classification scheme for data with a heavy-tailed distribution", ''The Professional Geographer'', 65 (3), 482 – 494.&lt;/ref&gt; Head/tail breaks is not just for classification, but also for visualization of big data by keeping the head, since the head is self-similar to the whole. Head/tail breaks can be applied not only to vector data such as points, lines and polygons, but also to raster data like digital elevation model (DEM).

==Motivation==
The head/tail breaks is mainly motivated by inability of conventional classification methods such as equal intervals, quantiles, geometric progressions, standard deviation, and natural breaks - commonly known as [[Jenks natural breaks optimization]] or [[k-means clustering]] for revealing the underlying scaling pattern of far more small things than large ones. Note that the notion of far more small things than large one is not only referred to geometric property, but also to topological and semantic properties. In this connection, the notion should be interpreted as far more unpopular (or less-connected) things than popular (or well-connected) ones, or far more meaningless things than meaningful ones.

==Method==
Given some variable X that demonstrates a heavy-tailed distribution, there are far more small x than large ones. Take the average of all xi, and obtain the first mean m1. Then calculate the second mean for those xi greater than m1, and obtain m2. In the same recursive way, we can get m3 depending on whether the ending condition of no longer far more small x than large ones is met. For simplicity, we assume there are three means, m1, m2, and m3. This classification leads to four classes: [minimum, m1], (m1, m2], (m2, m3], (m3, maximum]. In general, it can be represented as a recursive function as follows:

     Recursive function '''Head/tail Breaks''':
     Break the input data (around mean or average) as a whole into the head and the tail;  
     // the head for data values greater the mean
     // the tail for data values less the mean
     while (head &lt;= 40%):
         '''Head/tail Breaks'''(head);
     End Function

The resulting number of classes is referred to as ht-index, an alternative index to [[fractal dimension]] for characterizing complexity of fractals or geographic features: the higher the ht-index, the more complex the fractals.&lt;ref name="Jiang2"&gt;Jiang, Bin and Yin Junjun (2014). "Ht-index for quantifying the fractal or scaling structure of geographic features", ''Annals of the Association of American Geographers'', 104(3), 530–541.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Threshold or its sensitivity ===
The criterion to stop the iterative classification process using the head/tail breaks method is that the remaining data (i.e., the head part) are not heavy-tailed, or simply, the head part is no longer a minority (i.e., the proportion of the head part is no longer less than a threshold such as 40%). This threshold is suggested to be 40% by Jiang et al. (2013),&lt;ref name="Jiang3" /&gt; just as the codes above (i.e., head ≤ 40%). But sometimes a larger threshold, for example 50% or more, can be used, as Jiang and Yin (2014)&lt;ref name="Jiang2" /&gt; noted in another article: "this condition can be relaxed for many geographic features, such as 50 percent or even more". However, all heads' percentage on average must be smaller than 40% (or 41, 42%), indicating far more small things than large ones. This sensitivity issue deserves further research in the future.

=== Rank-size plot and RA index ===
A good tool to display the scaling pattern, or the heavy-tailed distribution, is the rank-size plot, which is a scatter plot to display a set of values according to their ranks. With this tool, a new index &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gao|first=Peichao|last2=Liu|first2=Zhao|last3=Tian|first3=Kun|last4=Liu|first4=Gang|date=2016-03-10|title=Characterizing Traffic Conditions from the Perspective of Spatial-Temporal Heterogeneity|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/5/3/34|journal=ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information|language=en|volume=5|issue=3|pages=34|doi=10.3390/ijgi5030034|bibcode=2016IJGI....5...34G}}&lt;/ref&gt; termed as the ratio of areas (RA) in a rank-size plot was defined to characterize the scaling pattern. The RA index has been successfully used in the estimation of traffic conditions. However, it should be noted that the RA index can only be used as a complementary method to the ht-index, because it is ineffective to capture the scaling structure of geographic features.

=== Other Indices based on the head/tail breaks ===
In addition to the ht-index, the following indices are also derived with the head/tail breaks.
* CRG-index.  It is developed as a more sensitive ht-index to capture the slight changes of geographic features.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gao|first=Peichao|last2=Liu|first2=Zhao|last3=Xie|first3=Meihui|last4=Tian|first4=Kun|last5=Liu|first5=Gang|date=2016-10-01|title=CRG Index: A More Sensitive Ht-Index for Enabling Dynamic Views of Geographic Features|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00330124.2015.1099448|journal=The Professional Geographer|volume=68|issue=4|pages=533–545|doi=10.1080/00330124.2015.1099448|issn=0033-0124}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast to the ht-index, which is an integer, CRG-index is a real number. 
* Unified metrics. Two unified metrics (UM1 and UM2) were proposed in an AAAG paper &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gao|first=Peichao|last2=Liu|first2=Zhao|last3=Liu|first3=Gang|last4=Zhao|first4=Hongrui|last5=Xie|first5=Xiaoxiao|date=2017-06-02|title=Unified Metrics for Characterizing the Fractal Nature of Geographic Features|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/24694452.2017.1310022|journal=Annals of the American Association of Geographers|volume=0|issue=0|pages=1–17|doi=10.1080/24694452.2017.1310022|issn=2469-4452}}&lt;/ref&gt; for characterizing the fractal nature of geographic features. One can be used to answer the question of “I know there are far more small things than large ones, but how small (or large) are these small (or large) things?”, whereas the other one to answer “I know there are far more small things than large ones, but how many more?”
* Fht-index: It is a fractional ht-index, which is able to capture fractional hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jiang|first=Bin|last2=Ma|first2=Ding|date=2017|title=How complex is a fractal? Head/tail breaks and fractional hierarchy|arxiv= 1703.00814|journal=Journal of Geovisualization and Spatial Analysis|volume=2|pages=xx–xx. Preprint|doi=10.1007/s41651-017-0009-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fht-index might be of help for creating an intermediate scale between two consecutive map scales, leading to so called continuous map scales.

==Applications==
Instead of more or less similar things, there are far more small things than large ones surrounding us. Given the ubiquity of the scaling pattern, head/tail breaks is found to be of use to statistical mapping, map generalization, cognitive mapping and even perception of beauty
.&lt;ref name="Jiang3"&gt;Jiang, Bin, Liu, Xintao and Jia, Tao (2013). "Scaling of geographic space as a universal rule for map generalization", ''Annals of the Association of American Geographers'', 103(4), 844 – 855.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jiang4"&gt;Jiang, Bin (2013b). "The image of the city out of the underlying scaling of city artifacts or locations", ''Annals of the Association of American Geographers'', 103(6), 1552-1566.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jiang5"&gt;Jiang, Bin and Sui, Daniel (2014). "A new kind of beauty out of the underlying scaling of geographic space", ''The Professional Geographer'', 66(4), 676–686&lt;/ref&gt; It helps visualize big data, since big data are likely to show the scaling property of far more small things than large ones. The visualization strategy is to recursively drop out the tail parts until the head parts are clear or visible enough.&lt;ref name="Jiang6"&gt;Jiang, Bin (2015). "Head/tail breaks for visualization of city structure and dynamics", ''Cities'', 43, 69 - 77.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it helps delineate cities or natural cities to be more precise from various geographic information such as street networks, social media geolocation data, and nighttime images.

=== Characterizing the imbalance ===
As the head/tail breaks method can be used iteratively to obtain head parts of a data set, this method actually captures the underlying hierarchy of the data set. For example, if we divide the array (19, 8, 7, 6, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0) with the head/tail breaks method, we can get two head parts, i.e., the first head part (19, 8, 7, 6) and the second head part (19). These two head parts as well as the original array form a three-level hierarchy:

the 1st level (19),

the 2nd level (19, 8, 7, 6), and

the 3rd level (19, 8, 7, 6, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0).

The number of levels of the above-mentioned hierarchy is actually a characterization of the imbalance of the example array, and this number of levels has been termed as the ht-index.&lt;ref name="Jiang2" /&gt; With the ht-index, we are able to compare degrees of imbalance of two data sets. For example, the ht-index of the example array (19, 8, 7, 6, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0) is 3, and the ht-index of another array (19, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8) is 2. Therefore, the degree of imbalance of the former array is higher than that of the latter array.
[[File:Natural_cities_of_Germany,_created_from_points_of_interest.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The left panel pattern contains 50,000 natural cities, which can be put into 7 hierarchical levels. It looks like a hair ball. Instead of showing all the 7 hierarchical levels, we show 4 top levels, by dropping out 3 low levels. Now with the right panel, the scaling pattern of far more small cities than large ones emerges. It is important to note that the right pattern (or the remaining part after dropping out the tails) is self-similar to the whole (or the left pattern). Thus the right pattern reflects the underlying structure of the left one, and enables us to see the whole.]]

=== Delineating natural cities ===
The term ‘natural cities’ refers to the human settlements or human activities in general on Earth’s surface that are naturally or objectively defined and delineated from massive geographic information based on head/tail division rule, a non-recursive form of head/tail breaks.&lt;ref name="Jiang7"&gt;Jiang, Bin and Miao, Yufan (2015). "The evolution of natural cities from the perspective of location-based social media", ''The Professional Geographer'', 67(2), 295 - 306.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Long"&gt;Long, Ying (2016). "Redefining Chinese city system with emerging new data", ''Applied Geography'', 75, 36 - 48.&lt;/ref&gt;  Such geographic information could be from various sources, such as massive street junctions &lt;ref name="Long"/&gt; and street ends, a massive number of street blocks, nighttime imagery and social media users’ locations etc. Distinctive from conventional cities, the adjective ‘natural’ could be explained not only by the sources of natural cities, but also by the approach to derive them. Natural cities are derived from a meaningful cutoff averaged from a massive number of units extracted from geographic information.&lt;ref name="Jiang6"/&gt; Those units vary according to different kinds of geographic information, for example the units could be area units for the street blocks and pixel values for the nighttime images. A '''[http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=47b1d6fdd1984a6fae916af389cdc57d natural cities model]''' has been created using ArcGIS model builder,&lt;ref name="Ren"&gt;Ren, Zheng (2016). "Natural cities model in ArcGIS", ''http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=47b1d6fdd1984a6fae916af389cdc57d''.&lt;/ref&gt; it follows the same process of deriving natural cities from location-based social media,&lt;ref name="Jiang7"/&gt; namely, building up huge triangular irregular network (TIN) based on the point features (street nodes in this case) and regarding the triangles which are smaller than a mean value as the natural cities.

=== Color rendering DEM ===
Current color renderings for DEM or density map are essentially based on conventional classifications such as natural breaks or equal intervals, so they disproportionately exaggerate high elevations or high densities. As a matter of fact, there are not so many high elevations or high-density locations.&lt;ref name="Jiang8"&gt;Jiang, Bin (2015). "Geospatial analysis requires a different way of thinking: The problem of spatial heterogeneity", ''GeoJournal'', 80(1), 1-13.&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that coloring based head/tail breaks is more favorable than those by other classifications &lt;ref name="Wu"&gt;Wu, Jou-Hsuan (2015). "Examining the new kind of beauty using the human being as a measuring instrument", ''http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:805296/FULLTEXT01.pdf''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ian D. Clark''' (born 1958) is an academic historian and [[Toponymist]] whose primary work has focused on [[Victorian Aborigines|Victorian Aboriginal]] history, aboriginal toponymy and the frontier conflict between [[Indigenous Australians]] and immigrant settlers during the [[History of Victoria|European settlement of Victoria]], Australia.

==Education and career==
Studied Bachelor of Theology at the [[Melbourne College of Divinity]], then a Bachelor of Arts (Hons) and Diploma of Education at [[Monash University]]. He completed his PhD in western Victorian Aboriginal historical geography at Monash University in 1992.

His academic posts have included working as a tutor / lecturer in geography, lecturer in tourism at [[Monash University]], and as a research fellow in history from 1993–1995 at the [[Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies]]. Since 2000 he has worked in the School of Business at the [[University of Ballarat]] first as a senior lecturer in Tourism and now occupies the position of Professor in Tourism.&lt;ref name="uni_profile"&gt;University of Ballarat School of Business ''[http://www.cecc.com.au/clients/uob/staff/staff_details.php?staff_id=12 Prof Ian Clark]'' Staff Profile. Accessed 21 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

He has worked extensively in the Victorian tourism industry with a focus on developing indigenous tourism material and facilities. For a time he was the manager of the Brambuk Aboriginal Cultural Centre in [[Halls Gap, Victoria|Halls Gap]], [[Gariwerd]]. He has also worked as senior researcher in the Koori Tourism Unit of the former Victorian Tourism Commission from 1989–1991.&lt;ref name="uni_profile" /&gt;

In 2005 he was chair of the Victorian State Committee of the Australian National Placenames Survey.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Map Circle 33rd Annual Conference, 2005, ''[http://www.anzmaps.org/docs/amc2005program.pdf Programme and Abstracts]''. Accessed 1 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical research==
He has written extensively on Victorian Aboriginal history including editing the journals of [[George Augustus Robinson]]. He worked with The ''[[Victorian Aboriginal Corporation for Languages]]'' and in 2002 published the ''Dictionary of Aboriginal Placenames of Victoria'' and several related regional placename publications. He was one of the organisers of the second ''Trends in [[Toponymy]]'' conference in Ballarat in 2007, and is researching a book on Aboriginal toponymy for the [[ANU E-Press]] series.&lt;ref&gt;AIATSIS Seminar Series, ''[http://www.aiatsis.gov.au/research/documents/KostanskiClark110411.pdf Old Names, New Purposes: Reflections on Recent Indigenous Naming Policies &amp; Programs]'', Canberra 2011. Accessed 1 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important published research includes work on massacre sites in Western Victoria in the 1995 publication ''Scars in the landscape : a register of massacre sites in Western Victoria 1803–1859''. The interaction between the [[Wurundjeri]] people and the early settlement of [[Melbourne]] was told in the 2004 book – ''A bend in the Yarra : a history of the [[Merri Creek]] Protectorate Station and Merri Creek Aboriginal School 1841–1851'', which Clark co-authored with Toby Heydon.

Clark has also written on the Aboriginal presence on the [[Ballarat goldfields]] in the 1850s noting that while there is no evidence for any direct involvement of Aboriginal people in the events of the [[Eureka Rebellion]] in 1854, aboriginal people may be relevant to the Eureka story through the event taking place on [[Wathaurong]] aboriginal land. The early policing of the Goldfield was done by the [[Native Police Corps]], and oral history that Aboriginal people looked after some of the children of the Eureka miners after the military storming of the Eureka Stockade and subsequent massacre of miners.&lt;ref&gt;Ian D. Clark, ''[http://www.hereticpress.com/Dogstar/History/Bentley/2005-07.pdf Another Side of Eureka – the Aboriginal presence on the Ballarat goldfields in 1854 – Were Aboriginal people involved in the Eureka rebellion?]'', Heretic Press, working paper 2005/2007, accessed 1 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Johann Karl Ehrenfried Kegel''' (October 3, 1784 in Rammelburg - June 25, 1863) was a [[Germany|German]] [[agronomist]] and [[List of explorers|explorer]] of the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]]. He died in [[Odessa]] in 1863. 

==Biography==
Kegel was born in Rammelburg (now part of the town [[Mansfeld]]) and studied in [[Copenhagen]]. In the winter of 1826/1827 he went to [[Saint Petersburg]]. In 1841 he was sent by the Russian government to Kamchatka to investigate possibilities of agriculture and mining in that region. He traveled through Siberia, embarked in [[Okhotsk]], only to arrive [[shipwreck]]ed in Kamchatka. 

From [[Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky|Petropavlovsk]], he undertook various voyages of several months into the heart of the country in order to examine the soil conditions and perform trial sowing. He travelled during the summer, even though traveling during this time was extremely strenuous and paths virtually impassable. His reports describe in detail [[flora]] and [[fauna]], [[soil]], [[geology]] as well as the life of the local population. Kegel discovered [[mineral resource]]s and saw the potential wealth of the country if managed well. In addition, he made proposals for improving the living conditions of the indigenous population and criticized oppression. 

Kegel was loathed by the corrupt local administration, who were not interested in the development of the country but rather in their own profit from [[fur trade]]. When they realized that Kegel was incorruptible, he was victimized whenever possible. Still he succeeded in accomplishing his work and returned - in poor state of health - in 1847. His reports were the most precise ones of this era, but could not be published in his lifetime, since this would have meant loss of freedom or worse.

The '''Lepidoptera of Nauru''' consist of both the [[butterflies]] and [[moth]]s recorded from [[Nauru]], an island country in [[Micronesia]] in the Central Pacific.

According to a recent estimate, there are a total of four [[butterfly]] species present in [[Nauru]], none of which is endemic. The number of moth species is unknown.

This is a list of cricket players who have played representative cricket for [[Tasmania]] in [[Australia]].

It includes players that have played at least one match, in senior [[First class cricket|first-class]], [[List A cricket]], or [[Twenty20]] matches. Practice matches are not included, unless they have officially been classified as first-class, List A or T20 games. The list is in chronological order of the players' first appearances for the Tasmania first team in any form of cricket; where two or more players debuted in the same match, they are ordered by their surnames. The list is complete to the end of the 2010/11 season.

==Tasmania in senior cricket==
Though [[Tasmania cricket team|Tasmania]] took part in the [[Van Diemen's Land v Port Phillip, 1851|first recognised first-class cricket match]] in Australia in 1850/51, it remained on the peripheries of Australian cricket for more than a century, confined to "friendly" first-class matches against other Australian states, primarily [[Victoria cricket team|Victoria]], and touring teams from the other [[Test cricket|Test-playing]] nations. After World War II, even the friendly matches against other Australian states became less frequent. To supplement the limited local schedule, matches were arranged in several seasons for a "[[Tasmania Combined XI]]", with the side consisting of some Tasmanian cricketers and others imported, usually from mainland Australia; matches played by this team do not count as first-class games for the Tasmania cricket team, and are therefore not included in this table.

From the late 1960s, with the import of foreign players, such as [[John Hampshire]], [[Jack Simmons (cricketer)|Jack Simmons]] and [[Alan Knott]], Tasmania was admitted first into the List A competitions and then into first-class competition.

The [[Sheffield Shield]] is the premier domestic cricket competition in Australia. It was founded in 1892, but a Tasmanian representative side was not permitted to enter the competition by the Australian Cricket Board (now [[Cricket Australia]]) until the 1977/78 season. Even then the first two seasons were on a trial basis only.

Whilst they initially struggled to prove competitive at first-class level, the Tasmanian Tigers won their first domestic trophy in 1978/79, capturing the domestic [[List A cricket]] [[Ford Ranger Cup|Gillette Cup]]. This was a success repeated when they won the [[Ford Ranger Cup]] in 2004/05, and again in 2007/08. The Tigers also won their first [[First class cricket]] title in 2006/07, winning the Sheffield Shield, then known as the Pura Cup, in that year. A second success followed in 2010/11. Tasmania has also been twice runners-up in the domestic [[Twenty20]] competition.

[[File:Denali Mt McKinley.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Denali]] in [[Alaska]] is the [[Elevation|highest]] [[Summit|mountain peak]] of [[North America]].  Denali is the third most [[Topographic prominence|topographically prominent]] and third most [[Topographic isolation|topographically isolated]] [[summit]] on Earth after [[Mount Everest]] and [[Aconcagua]].]]

The following sortable table comprises the '''401 [[Summit|mountain peaks]] of [[North America|greater North America]]&lt;ref name=NA&gt;This article defines [[North America|greater North America]] as the portion of the [[Continent|continental landmass]] of the [[Americas]] extending westward and northward from the [[Isthmus of Panama]] plus the [[Island|ocean islands]] surrounding that landmass.  This article defines the ocean islands of greater North America to include the [[Island#Continental islands|coastal islands]] of [[Geography of North America|North America]], the [[Caribbean|islands of the Caribbean Sea]], the [[Lucayan Archipelago]], the [[List of islands of Greenland|islands of Greenland]] ([[Greenland|Kalaallit Nunaat]]), the [[List of islands of Canada|islands of Canada]], and the [[List of islands of Alaska|islands of Alaska]].  The [[Hawaiian Islands]] are not included because they are considered part of [[Oceania]].&lt;/ref&gt; with at least {{convert|3000|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of [[elevation]] and at least {{convert|500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of [[topographic prominence]]'''.&lt;ref name=major&gt;This article defines a significant summit as a summit with at least {{convert|100|m|1|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of [[topographic prominence]], and a major summit as a summit with at least {{convert|500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.  All summits in this article have at least 500&amp;nbsp;meters of topographic prominence.  An [[Ultra-prominent peak|ultra-prominent summit]] is a summit with at least {{convert|1500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[summit]] of a mountain or hill may be measured in three principal ways:
#The [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] of a summit measures the height of the summit above a [[Geoid|geodetic sea level]].&lt;ref name=NAVD_88&gt;All elevations in the 48 [[U.S. state|states]] of the [[contiguous United States]] include an elevation adjustment from the [[National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929]] ([[NGVD 29]]) to the [[North American Vertical Datum of 1988]] ([[NAVD 88]]).  For further information, please see this [[United States National Geodetic Survey]] [http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/faq.shtml#WhatVD29VD88 note].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=range&gt;If the elevation or prominence of a summit is calculated as a range of values, the [[arithmetic mean]] is shown.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is a measure of how high the summit rises above its surroundings.&lt;ref name=prominence&gt;The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is the [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] difference between the summit and its [[Topographic prominence#Definitions|highest or key col to a higher summit]].

'''Lithgow''' is a surname originating from [[Scots language|Scottish]] as a habitational name from [[Linlithgow]], between [[Edinburgh]] and [[Falkirk]], which was probably named with British words related to modern [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''[[llyn]]'' ‘lake’, ‘pool’ + ''llaith'' ‘damp’ + ''cau'' ‘hollow’.In the 13th and 14th centuries the name appears both with and without the first syllable. Originally, Lithgow was the name of the settlement and Linlithgow that of the lake. Lithgow was associated by folk etymology with [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] ''liath'' ‘gray’ + ''cu'' ‘dog’, and such a figure appears on the medieval borough seal. The surname, is well represented in the [[Dominican Republic]], [[South Africa]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], the [[United States]], and the [[UK]].

It may refer to:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5292">[[Maryland]] is among the states in the US that is acquiring [[lidar]] data, complementing the [[National Lidar Dataset (United States)|National Lidar Dataset]] effort to acquire high resolution elevation data across the nation. The [[Maryland Department of Natural Resources]] coordinates with most counties in the state regarding acquisition specifications, post-processing quality control, and in some cases, distribution. However, in general each county initiates the lidar acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dnrweb.dnr.state.md.us/gis/data/lidar/ |title=Samples of LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) Derived Elevation Data |publisher=[[Maryland Department of Natural Resources]] |accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Spring of 2014, the [http://doit.maryland.gov/Pages/default.aspx Maryland Department of Information Technology] announced the addition of several new LiDAR features to [http://imap.maryland.gov/Pages/default.aspx MD iMap], Maryland’s Mapping &amp; GIS Data Portal.  The [http://lidar.salisbury.edu/arcgis/rest/services Maryland Topography Server] and [http://imap.maryland.gov/Pages/lidar-topography-viewer.aspx Topography Viewer], hosted by the [http://www.esrgc.org/ Eastern Shore Regional GIS Cooperative] at [http://www.salisbury.edu/ Salisbury University] have been created to provide open access to statewide elevation information for use in a variety of studies and applications. The Maryland Topography Server maintains the best available elevation data and provides image services in both county and statewide extents.  The Maryland Topography Viewer is a web application that allows users to view and interact with the elevation services hosted on the Topography Server. Users can view, query and more on desktop and mobile devices.  [http://imap.maryland.gov/Pages/lidar.aspx MD iMap] provides access to the Topography Server and Viewer as well as status maps, FAQs, metadata, and more.

The ''' ''n''-vector''' representation is a three-parameter [[mathematical singularity|non-singular]] representation well-suited for replacing [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] as [[horizontal position representation]] in mathematical calculations and computer algorithms.

Geometrically, the ''n''-vector for a given position on an [[ellipsoid]] is the outward-pointing [[unit vector]] that is [[surface normal|normal]] in that position to the ellipsoid. For representing horizontal positions on Earth, the ellipsoid is a [[reference ellipsoid]] and the vector is [[Vector decomposition|decomposed]] in an [[ECEF|Earth-centered Earth-fixed]] [[coordinate system]]. It behaves smoothly at all Earth positions, and it holds the mathematical [[Injective function|one-to-one]] property.

More in general, the concept can be applied to representing positions on the boundary of a strictly [[Convex set|convex]] [[bounded subset]] of ''k''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], provided that that boundary is a [[differentiable manifold]]. In this general case, the ''n''-vector consists of ''k'' parameters.

==General properties==

A [[normal vector]] to a strictly [[convex set|convex]] surface can be used to uniquely define a surface position. ''n''-vector is an  outward-pointing normal vector with [[unit vector|unit length]] used as a position representation. 
&lt;ref name=Gade&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Gade |first1= Kenneth |year= 2010 |title= A non-singular horizontal position representation |journal= The Journal of Navigation |publisher= Cambridge University Press |volume= 63 |issue= 3 |pages=395–417 |url=http://www.navlab.net/Publications/A_Nonsingular_Horizontal_Position_Representation.pdf| format=PDF |doi= 10.1017/S0373463309990415 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For most applications the surface is the [[reference ellipsoid]] of the Earth, and thus ''n''-vector is used to represent a horizontal position. Hence, the angle between ''n''-vector and the equatorial plane corresponds to [[geodetic latitude]], as shown in the figure.

[[Image:n vector and geodetic latitude.png|thumb | upright=1.7 | alt=Alt |The direction of ''n''-vector corresponds to geodetic latitude]]

A surface position has two [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]], and thus two parameters are sufficient to represent any position on the surface. On the reference ellipsoid, [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] are common parameters for this purpose, but as all ''two-parameter representations'', they have [[mathematical singularity|singularities]]. This is similar to [[Rotation formalisms in three dimensions|orientation]], which has three degrees of freedom, but all ''three-parameter representations'' have singularities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Stuelpnagel |first1= John |year= 1964 |title= On the Parametrization of the Three-Dimensional Rotation Group |journal= SIAM Review |publisher= Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics |volume= 6 |issue= 4 |pages=422–430 |doi=10.1137/1006093 |jstor=2027966}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases the singularities are avoided by adding an extra parameter, i.e. to use ''n''-vector (three parameters) to [[Horizontal position representation|represent horizontal position]] and a unit [[quaternion]] (four parameters) to [[Rotation formalisms in three dimensions|represent orientation]].

''n''-vector is a [[Injective function|one-to-one]] representation, meaning that any surface position corresponds to one unique ''n''-vector, and any ''n''-vector corresponds to one unique surface position. 

As a [[Euclidean vector|Euclidean 3D vector]], standard 3D [[Vector calculus|vector algebra]] can be used for the position calculations, and this makes ''n''-vector well-suited for most horizontal position calculations.

== Converting latitude/longitude to ''n''-vector ==

Based on the definition of the [[ECEF]] coordinate system, it is clear that going from latitude/longitude to ''n''-vector, is achieved by:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf n^e=\left[ \begin{matrix}
   \cos (\mathrm{latitude})\cos (\mathrm{longitude})  \\
   \cos (\mathrm{latitude})\sin (\mathrm{longitude})  \\
   \sin (\mathrm{latitude})  \\
\end{matrix} \right]&lt;/math&gt;

The superscript ''e'' means that ''n''-vector is [[Vector decomposition|decomposed]] in the coordinate system ''e'' (i.e. the first component is the [[Scalar resolute|scalar projection]] of ''n''-vector onto the ''x''-axis of ''e'', the second onto the ''y''-axis of ''e'' etc.). Note that the equation is exact both for spherical and ellipsoidal Earth model.

== Converting ''n''-vector to latitude/longitude ==

From the three components of ''n''-vector, &lt;math&gt;n_x^e&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;n_y^e&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;n_z^e&lt;/math&gt;, latitude can be found by using:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{latitude}=\arcsin\left( n_z^e \right)=\arctan\left( \frac{n_z^e}{\sqrt{{n_x^e}^2+{n_y^e}^2}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

The rightmost expression is best suited for computer program implementation.&lt;ref name=Gade/&gt;

Longitude is found using:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{longitude}=\arctan\left(\frac{n_y^e}{n_x^e} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

In these expressions &lt;math&gt;\arctan(y/x)&lt;/math&gt; should be implemented using a call to [[atan2]](''y'',''x'').  The [[Geographical pole|Pole]] [[Mathematical singularity|singularity]] of longitude is evident as [[atan2]](0,0) is undefined. Note that the equations are exact both for spherical and ellipsoidal Earth model.

== Example: Great circle distance==
Finding the [[great circle distance]] between two horizontal positions (assuming spherical Earth) is usually done by means of latitude and longitude. [[great circle distance#Formulas|Three different expressions]] for this distance are common; the first is based on [[Inverse trigonometric function|arccos]], the second is based on [[Inverse trigonometric function|arcsin]], and the final is based on [[Inverse trigonometric function|arctan]]. The expressions, which are successively more complex to avoid [[Numerical stability|numerical instabilities]], are not easy to find, and since they are based on latitude and longitude, the Pole singularities may become a problem. They also contain [[Delta (letter)|deltas]] of latitude and longitude, which in general should be used with care near the ±[[180th meridian|180° meridian]] and the Poles.

Solving the same problem using ''n''-vector is simpler due to the possibility of using [[Vector calculus|vector algebra]]. The arccos expression is achieved from the [[dot product]], while the [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] of the [[cross product]] gives the arcsin expression. Combining the two gives the arctan expression:&lt;ref name=Gade/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 &amp; \Delta \sigma=\arccos\left( \mathbf n_a\cdot \mathbf n_b \right) \\ 
 &amp; \Delta \sigma=\arcsin\left( \left| \mathbf n_a\times \mathbf n_b \right| \right) \\ 
 &amp; \Delta \sigma=\arctan\left( \frac{\left| \mathbf n_a\times \mathbf n_b \right|}{\mathbf n_a\cdot \mathbf n_b} \right) \\ 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf n_a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf n_b&lt;/math&gt; are the ''n''-vectors representing the two positions ''a'' and ''b''. &lt;math&gt;\Delta\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the angular difference, and thus the great-circle distance is achieved by multiplying with the Earth radius. This expression also works at the poles and at the ±180° meridian. Note that ''arctan'' must be replaced by ''[[atan2]]'' in computer program implementation.

There are several other examples where the use of vector algebra simplifies standard problems.&lt;ref name=Gade/&gt; For a general comparison of the various representations, see the [[horizontal position representation| horizontal position representations page]].

'''Jeff Chapman''' (September 19, 1973 &amp;ndash; August 23, 2005), better known by the pseudonym '''Ninjalicious''', was a [[Toronto]]-based [[Urban exploration|urban explorer]], [[fountaineer]], [[writer]] and founder of the urban exploration [[zine]] ''Infiltration: the zine about going places you're not supposed to go''. He was also a prominent author and editor for ''YIP magazine'',&lt;ref name="eye"&gt;"[http://www.eyeweekly.com/archived/article/25265 Ninjalicious, 1973-2005]", ''[[Eye Weekly]]'', published September 1, 2005, accessed May 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as its website, ''Yip.org''.

Chapman died of [[cholangiocarcinoma]] on Tuesday, August 23, 2005 at the age of 31 — three years after a successful [[liver transplant]] at [[Toronto General Hospital]] (a location he loved to explore). Doctors claimed that Chapman's illness was caused by coming into contact with carcinogens during exploring, and family members confirmed that Chapman had been diagnosed with auto-immune diseases after becoming an avid explorer, and that his extended stays at hospitals further hooked him on exploring institutions.&lt;ref name="eye" /&gt;

== Background ==

Chapman attended [[York University]] in the early 1990s and later studied book and magazine publishing at [[Centennial College (Ontario)|Centennial College]].  He went on to serve as Editor at ''[[History Magazine]]'' and as Director of the [[Toronto Architectural Conservancy]] board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.torarchcons.org/jeff.html Jeff Chapman tribute on Toronto Architectural Conservancy website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816082628/http://www.torarchcons.org/jeff.html |date=2007-08-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Works ==

[[Image:Ninjalicious Book Cover.jpg|right|thumb|''Access All Areas'' book authored by Ninjalicious.]]
Chapman first published ''Infiltration'' in 1996. In total, 25 issues were published — covering such urban exploration topics as the navigation of storm drains, evading hotel security and adventuring through abandoned military shelters. He also launched infiltration.org, an online version of the zine, in 1996.

His book, ''Access All Areas: a user's guide to the art of urban exploration'', was published in July 2005, shortly before his death.&lt;ref&gt;Access All Areas: a user's guide to the art of urban exploration, 2005 Ninjalicious (Infilpress) {{ISBN|0-9737787-0-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book serves as a how-to-guide to urban exploration — covering topics from basic stealth and concealment, to [[social engineering (security)|social engineering]] techniques to ethics. Chapman is credited with coining the term "credibility prop", which describes a device, uniform, piece of equipment or other appurtenances used solely to reduce suspicion if one is encountered in a normally restricted area.  A specific example of "credibility prop" is simply being wet (wetness being a good credibility prop for infiltration of a hotel pool).&lt;ref&gt;[http://infiltration.org/hotels-plunge.html A Guide to Getting Wet in Toronto Hotels]&lt;/ref&gt;
He was also featured in CBC Newsworlds program BIG LIfe showing him exploring Toronto.

Jeff and his wife Liz were both interview subjects in the film ''[[BBS: The Documentary]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://bbsdocumentary.dreamhost.com/photos/interviews.html Milky and Liz, listing and photo album of interview subjects from BBS: The Documentary]&lt;/ref&gt; as participants in the Toronto [[Bulletin board system|BBS]] community and other early online communities. He is credited under the handle ''Milky'', though he was also known as ''Milky Puppy'' online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://groups.google.com/group/alt.zines/browse_thread/thread/3ee1675cf8bee3b0 Usenet alt.zines posting, 25 Aug 2005, archived]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Northern England''', also known simply as '''the North''', is the northern part of [[England]], considered as a single [[cultural area]]. It extends from the [[Scotland|Scottish]] border in the north to near the [[River Trent]] in the south, although precise definitions of its southern extent vary. Northern England approximately comprises three [[Regions of England|statistical regions]]: the [[North East England|North East]], [[North West England|North West]] and [[Yorkshire and the Humber]]. These have a combined population of around 14.9 million as of the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 Census]] and an area of 37,331&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (14,414 sq mi). Northern England contains much of [[National parks of England and Wales|England's national parkland]] but also has large areas of urbanisation, including the [[conurbation]]s of [[Greater Manchester]], [[Merseyside]], [[Teesside]], [[Tyneside]], [[Wearside]], and [[Sheffield Urban Area|South]] and [[West Yorkshire Urban Area|West Yorkshire]].

The region has been controlled by many groups, from the [[Brigantes]], the largest [[Britons (historical)|Brythonic]] kingdom of [[Great Britain]], to the Romans, to Anglo-Saxons, Celts and Danes. After the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]] in 1066, the [[Harrying of the North]] brought destruction. The area experienced [[Anglo-Scottish border]] fighting until the [[History of the formation of the United Kingdom|unification of Britain]] under the [[House of Stuart|Stuarts]], with some parts changing hands between England and Scotland many times. Many of the innovations of the [[Industrial Revolution]] began in Northern England, and its cities were the crucibles of many of the political changes that accompanied this social upheaval, from [[trade unionism]] to [[Manchester Liberalism|Manchester Capitalism]]. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the economy of the North was dominated by [[heavy industry]] such as weaving, shipbuilding, steelmaking and mining. The [[Deindustrialization|deindustrialisation]] that followed in the second half of the 20th century hit Northern England hard, and many towns remain deprived compared with those in [[Southern England]].

Urban renewal projects and the transition to a [[service economy]] have resulted in strong economic growth in some parts of Northern England, but a definite [[North–South divide (England)|North–South divide]] remains both in the [[economy of England|economy]] and the [[culture of England]]. Centuries of migration, invasion and labour have shaped Northern culture, and the region retains distinctive dialects, music and cuisine.

For government and statistical purposes, Northern England is defined as the area covered by the three [[Regions of England|statistical regions]] of [[North East England]], [[North West England]] and [[Yorkshire and the Humber]].{{sfn|IPPR North|2012|pages=20–22}} This area consists of the [[ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial counties]] of [[Cheshire]], [[Cumbria]], [[County Durham]], [[East Riding of Yorkshire]], [[Greater Manchester]], [[Lancashire]], [[Merseyside]], [[Northumberland]], [[North Yorkshire]], [[South Yorkshire]], [[Tyne and Wear]] and [[West Yorkshire]], plus the unitary authority areas of [[North Lincolnshire]] and [[North East Lincolnshire]]. This definition will be used in this article, except when otherwise stated.

[[File:Northern England-Historic counties.svg|thumb|left|Northern England as defined along historic county boundaries|upright=0.9|alt=A map of the historical counties of England, with Northern counties highlighted.]]
Other definitions use [[Historic counties of England|historic county]] boundaries, in which case the North is generally taken to comprise [[Cumberland, England|Cumberland]], Northumberland, [[Westmorland]], County Durham, Lancashire and [[Yorkshire]], often supplemented by Cheshire,{{sfn|Wales|2006|pages=13–14}} or are drawn without reference to human borders, using geographic features such as the [[River Mersey]] and [[River Trent]].{{sfn|Russell|2004|pages=15–16}} The [[Isle of Man]] is occasionally included in definitions of "the North" (for example, by the [[Survey of English Dialects]], [[VisitBritain]] and [[BBC North West]]), although it is politically and culturally distinct from England.{{sfn|Wales|2006|pages=13–14}}

Through the North of England run the [[Pennines]], an [[Highland (geography)|upland]] chain, often referred to as "the backbone of England", which stretches from the [[River Tyne|Tyne]] Gap to the [[Peak District]]. Other uplands in the North include the [[Lake District]] with England's highest mountains, the [[Cheviot Hills]] adjoining the border with Scotland, and the [[North York Moors]] near the [[North Sea]] coastline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Nature Conservation Review |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YPQaFxH-AZYC&amp;pg=PA315&amp;dq=pennines+lake+district+north+york+moors+cheviots&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi2z6yO-efdAhUlJsAKHediBawQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=pennines%20lake%20district%20north%20york%20moors%20cheviots&amp;f=false |website=Google Books |publisher=Derek Ratcliffe |accessdate=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The geography of the North has been heavily shaped by the [[ice sheet]]s of the [[Pleistocene]] era, which often reached as far south as the Midlands.

Dense urban areas have emerged along the coasts and rivers, and they run almost contiguously into each other in places.

The [[prevailing winds]] across the British Isles are [[westerlies]] bringing moisture from the Atlantic Ocean; this means that the west coast frequently receives strong winds and heavy rainfall while the east coast lies in a [[rain shadow]] behind the Pennines. As a result, Teesside and the Northumbrian coast are the driest regions in the North, with around {{cvt|600|mm}} of rain per year, while parts of the Lake District receive over {{cvt|3200|mm}}. Lowland regions in the more southern parts of Northern England such as Cheshire and South Yorkshire are the warmest, with average maximum July temperatures of over {{cvt|21|°C}}, while the highest points in the Pennines and Lake District reach only {{cvt|17|°C}}. The area has a reputation for cloud and fog – especially along its east coast, which experiences a distinctive [[sea fog]] known as [[Haar (fog)|fret]] – although the [[Clean Air Act 1956]] and decline of heavy industry have seen sunshine duration increase in urban areas in recent years.&lt;ref name="MetOffice"/&gt;

The English spoken today in the North has been shaped by the area's history, and some dialects retain features inherited from [[Old Norse]] and the [[Insular Celtic languages|local Celtic languages]].{{sfn|Wales|2006|pages=43–45, 55–59}} Dialects spoken in the North include [[Cumbrian dialect|Cumbrian]], [[Geordie]] (Tyneside), [[Manchester dialect|Mancunian]] (Manchester), [[English of Northumbria|Northumbrian]] (Northumberland), [[Pitmatic]] (former mining communities of Northumberland/County Durham), [[Scouse]] (Liverpool) and [[Yorkshire dialect|Tyke]] (Yorkshire). Linguists have attempted to define a Northern dialect area, corresponding to the area north of a line that begins at the Humber estuary and runs up the [[River Wharfe]] and across to the [[River Lune]] in north Lancashire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Accents of English|volume=2|pages=349–350|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1982|isbn=978-0-521-28540-7|first=John C.|last=Wells}}&lt;/ref&gt; This area corresponds roughly to the ''[[sprachraum]]'' of the [[Old English]] [[Northumbrian dialect]], although the linguistic elements that defined this area in the past, such as the use of ''doon'' instead of ''down'' and substitution of an ''ang'' sound in words that end -''ong'' (''lang'' instead of ''long''), are now prevalent only in the more northern parts of the region. As speech has changed, there is little consensus on what defines a "Northern" accent or dialect.{{sfn|Hickey|2015|p=1}}

Northern English accents have not undergone the [[trap-bath split|&lt;small&gt;TRAP&lt;/small&gt;–&lt;small&gt;BATH&lt;/small&gt; split]], and a common [[shibboleth]] to distinguish them from Southern ones is the Northern use of the short a (the [[near-open front unrounded vowel]]) in words such as ''bath'' and ''castle''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/learning/langlit/sounds/changing-voices/phonological-change/trap-bath-split/ |title=The TRAP~BATH Split |website=[[The British Library]] |accessdate=3 March 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161212034113/http://www.bl.uk/learning/langlit/sounds/changing-voices/phonological-change/trap-bath-split/ |archivedate=12 December 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the opposite border, most Northern English accents can be distinguished from [[Scottish English|Scottish accents]] because they are [[non-rhotic]], although a few rhotic Lancashire accents remain.{{sfn|Hickey|2015|pp=11–12}} Other features common to many Northern English accents are the absence of the [[foot-strut split|&lt;small&gt;FOOT&lt;/small&gt;–&lt;small&gt;STRUT&lt;/small&gt; split]] (so ''put'' and ''putt'' are [[homophone]]s), the reduction of the [[definite article]] ''the'' to a [[glottal stop]] (usually represented in writing as ''t{{'}}''), and the T-to-R rule that leads to the pronunciation of ''t'' as a [[rhotic consonant]] in phrases like ''get up'' ({{IPA|[ɡɛɹ ʊp]}}).{{sfn|Hickey|2015|pp=12–13}}

The [[pronouns]] [[Thou|''thou'' and ''thee'']] survive in some Northern English dialects, although these are dying out outside very rural areas, and many dialects have an informal second-person plural pronoun: either ''[[Ye (pronoun)|ye]]'' (common in the North East) or ''[[wikt:yous|yous]]'' (common in areas with historical Irish communities).{{sfn|Hickey|2015|pp=85–86}} Many dialects use ''[[wikt:me|me]]'' as a [[English possessive|possessive]] ("me car") and some treat ''[[wikt:us|us]]'' likewise ("us cars") or use the alternative ''[[wikt:wor|wor]]'' ("wor cars"). Possessive pronouns are also used to mark the names of relatives in speech (for example, a relative called Joan would be referred to as "our Joan" in conversation).{{sfn|Hickey|2015|pp=83–85}}

With urbanisation, distinctive urban accents have arisen which often differ greatly from the historical accents of the surrounding rural areas and sometimes share features with Southern English accents.{{sfn|Hickey|2015|p=1}} Northern English dialects remain an important part of the culture of the region, and the desire of speakers to assert their local identity has led to accents such as Scouse and Geordie becoming more distinctive and spreading into surrounding areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/6927109/British-regional-accents-still-thriving.html |title=British regional accents 'still thriving' |first=Richard |last=Savill |date=3 January 2010 |accessdate=3 March 2017 |newspaper=Daily Telegraph |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160522185109/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/6927109/British-regional-accents-still-thriving.html |archivedate=22 May 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other languages===
There are no recognised minority languages in Northern England, although the Northumbrian Language Society campaigns to have the [[English of Northumbria|Northumbrian dialect]] recognised as a separate language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northumbriana.org.uk/langsoc/ |title=What is the Northumbrian Language Society? |website=The Northumbrian Language Society |year=2013 |accessdate=13 March 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161015204522/http://www.northumbriana.org.uk/langsoc/ |archivedate=15 October 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traces of now-extinct [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic Celtic languages]] from the region survive in some rural areas in the [[Yan Tan Tethera]] counting systems traditionally used by shepherds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cultural Evolution|first= Kate |last=Distin|year=2010 |publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-18971-2|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Language contact|Contact]] between English and [[immigrant language]]s has given rise to new accents and dialects. For instance, the variety of English spoken by Poles in Manchester is distinct both from typical Polish-accented English and from Mancunian.{{sfn|Hickey|2015|pp=459–469}} At a local level, the diversity of immigrant communities means that some languages that are extremely rare in the country as a whole have strongholds in Northern towns: [[Bradford]] for instance has the largest proportion of [[Pashto]] speakers, while Manchester has most [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]] speakers.&lt;ref name="ESL"/&gt;

During the [[ice age]]s, Northern England was buried under ice sheets, and little evidence remains of habitation – either because the climate made the area uninhabitable, or because glaciation destroyed most evidence of human activity.{{sfn|Pettit|White|2012|pp=489, 497}} The northern-most [[cave art]] in Europe is found at [[Creswell Crags]] in northern Derbyshire, near modern-day Sheffield, which shows signs of [[Neanderthal]] inhabitation 50 to 60 thousand years ago, and of a more modern occupation known as the [[Creswellian culture]] around 12,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/archaeology/research/projects/all/?mode=project&amp;id=639 |publisher=Durham University |title=Palaeolithic art and archaeology of Creswell Crags, UK |accessdate=5 March 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017013852/https://www.dur.ac.uk/archaeology/research/projects/all/?mode=project&amp;id=639 |archivedate=17 October 2015 |df= }} The dates given in the source are 28,000 14C years ago for the Gravettian and 12,500 to 12,200 14C years ago for the Magdalenian.

[[File:Hadrian's wall at Greenhead Lough.jpg|thumb|left|Hadrian's Wall, one of the most famous Roman remains in Northern England, is now a [[World Heritage Site]].|alt=A stone wall winding over a hilly landscape]]
Roman histories name the Celtic tribe that occupied the majority of Northern England as the [[Brigantes]], likely meaning "Highlanders". Whether the Brigantes were a unified group or a looser federation of tribes around the Pennines is debated, but the name appears to have been adopted by the inhabitants of the region, which was known by the Romans as [[Brigantia (ancient region)|Brigantia]].{{sfn|Harding|2004|page=23–27}} Other tribes mentioned in ancient histories, which may have been part of the Brigantes or separate nations, are the [[Carvetii]] of modern-day Cumbria and the [[Parisi (Yorkshire)|Parisi]] of east Yorkshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Companion to Roman Britain|first=Michael|last=Todd|chapter=Cities and Urban Life|page=163|isbn=978-0-470-99885-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brigantes allied with the [[Roman Empire]] during the [[Roman conquest of Britain]]: [[Tacitus]] records that they handed the resistance leader [[Caratacus]] over to the Empire in 51.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]], ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+12.36 12:36]&lt;/ref&gt; Power struggles within the Brigantes made the Romans wary, and they were conquered in a war beginning in the 70s under the governorship of [[Quintus Petillius Cerialis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Roman Britain|first=David|last=Shotter|year=2012|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans created the province of "[[Britannia Inferior]]" (Lower Britain) in the North, and it was ruled from the city of [[Eboracum]] (modern [[York]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge Ancient History|volume=XII|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1970|page=706}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eboracum and [[Deva Victrix]] (modern Chester) were the main [[Roman legion|legionary]] bases in the region, with other smaller forts including [[Mamucium]] (Manchester) and [[Cataractonium]] ([[Catterick, North Yorkshire|Catterick]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge Ancient History: Volume 12, The Crisis of Empire, AD 193–337|pages=253–254|first=John|last=Wilkes|chapter=Frontiers and Provinces|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-30199-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Philip Perry's Sketch of the Ancient British History: A Critical Edition|first=Philip|last=Perry|page=8|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4438-0470-7|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; Britannia Inferior extended as far north as [[Hadrian's Wall]], which was the northernmost [[borders of the Roman Empire|border of the Roman Empire]].{{efn|The [[Antonine Wall]], across what is now the [[Central Belt]] of Scotland, was even further north, but Roman control over this area was limited.&lt;ref name="Wall"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of European Peoples, Volume 2|first1=Carl|last1=Waldman|first2=Catherine|last2=Mason|isbn=978-1-4381-2918-1|year=2006|publisher=Infobase}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Although the Romans invaded modern-day Northumberland and part of Scotland beyond it, they never succeeded in conquering the reaches of Britain beyond the [[River Tyne]].&lt;ref name="Wall"/&gt;

The 1066 defeat of the Norwegian king [[Harald Hardrada]] by the Anglo-Saxon [[Harold Godwinson]] at the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]] near York marked the beginning of the end of Viking rule in England, and the almost immediate defeat of Godwinson at the hands of the Norman [[William the Conqueror]] at the [[Battle of Hastings]] was in turn the overthrow of the Anglo-Saxon order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Medieval Scandinavia: An Encyclopedia|page=267|first=Phillip|last=Pulsiano|year=1993|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-8240-4787-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Northumbrian and Danish aristocracy resisted the [[Norman Conquest]], and to put an end to the rebellion, William ordered the [[Harrying of the North]].

After the [[English Reformation]], the North saw several Catholic uprisings, including the [[Pilgrimage of Grace#Lincolnshire Rising|Lincolnshire Rising]], [[Bigod's Rebellion]] in Cumberland and Westmorland, and largest of all, the Yorkshire-based [[Pilgrimage of Grace]], all against [[Henry VIII]].&lt;ref name="Grace"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tudortimes.co.uk/military-warfare/the-pilgrimage-of-grace |title=The Pilgrimage of Grace |date=2 December 2014 |accessdate=3 March 2017 |website=Tudor Times |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161015052650/http://tudortimes.co.uk/military-warfare/the-pilgrimage-of-grace |archivedate=15 October 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His daughter [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] faced another Catholic rebellion, the [[Rising of the North]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The English Catholics in the Reign of Queen Elizabeth|first=John Hungerford |last=Pollen|year=1920|publisher=Longmans|chapter=Chapter IV: The Rising of the North}}&lt;/ref&gt; The region would become the centre of [[recusancy]] as prominent Catholic families in Cumbria, Lancashire and Yorkshire refused to convert to Protestantism.{{sfn|Jewell|1994|pages=177–178}} Royal power over the region was exercised through the [[Council of the North]] at [[King's Manor]], York, which was founded in 1484 by Richard III. The Council existed intermittently for the next two centuries – its final incarnation was created in the aftermath of the Pilgrimage of Grace and was chiefly an institution for providing order and dispensing justice.&lt;ref name="Council"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historytoday.com/stephen-cooper/council-north |title=The Council of the North |first1=Stephen |last1=Cooper |first2=Ashley |last2=Cooper |website=History Today |date=29 April 2015 |accessdate=9 March 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224052534/http://www.historytoday.com/stephen-cooper/council-north |archivedate=24 February 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Northern England was a focal point for fighting during the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]. The border counties were invaded by Scotland in the [[Bishops' Wars|Second Bishops' War]], and at the 1640 [[Treaty of Ripon]] [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] was forced to temporarily cede Northumberland and County Durham to the Scots and pay to keep the Scottish armies there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bcw-project.org/military/bishops-wars/second-bishops-war |title=The Second Bishops' War, 1640 |accessdate=10 March 2017 |website=BCW |date=24 November 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406181642/http://bcw-project.org/military/bishops-wars/second-bishops-war |archivedate= 6 April 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; To raise enough funds and ratify the final peace treaty, Charles had to call what became the [[Long Parliament]], beginning the process that led to the [[First English Civil War]]. In 1641, the Long Parliament abolished the Council of the North for perceived abuses during the [[Personal Rule]] period.&lt;ref name="Council"/&gt; By the time war broke out in 1642, King Charles had moved his court to York, and Northern England was to become a major base of the [[Cavalier|Royalist]] forces until they were routed at the [[Battle of Marston Moor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bcw-project.org/military/english-civil-war/northern-england/index |title=Civil War in Northern England |accessdate=10 March 2017 |website=BCW |date=8 March 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419100720/http://bcw-project.org/military/english-civil-war/northern-england/index |archivedate=19 April 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrial Revolution===

At the beginning of the [[Industrial Revolution]], Northern England had plentiful coal and [[water power]] while the poor agriculture in the uplands meant that labour in the area was cheap. Mining and milling, which had been practiced on a small scale in the area for generations, began to grow and centralise.&lt;ref name="EccHistoryp3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citymetric.com/skylines/economic-history-north-england-part-3-industrial-revolution-arrives-1209 |title=An economic history of the north of England.

The [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine in Ireland]] of the 1840s drove migrants across the [[Irish Sea]], and many settled in the industrial cities of the North, especially Manchester and Liverpool – at the [[United Kingdom Census 1851|1851 census]], 13% of the population of Manchester and [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]] were Irish-born, and in Liverpool the figure was 22%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Building Jerusalem: The Rise and Fall of the Victorian City|first=Tristram|last=Hunt|publisher=Hachette|authorlink=Tristram Hunt|isbn=978-0-297-86594-0|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response there was a wave of [[anti-Catholicism in the United Kingdom|anti-Catholic]] riots and Protestant [[Orange Order]]s proliferated across Northern England, chiefly in Lancashire, but also elsewhere in the North.

Some immigrants were well-to-do industrialists seeking to do business in the booming industrial cities, some were escaping poverty, some were servants or slaves, some were sailors who chose to settle in the port towns, some were Jews fleeing [[pogrom]]s on the continent, and some were migrants originally stranded at Liverpool after attempting to catch an onwards ship to the United States or to colonies of the [[British Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/articles/2007/10/03/031007_migrant_history_manchester_feature.shtml |title=Manchester: Migrant city |first=Jonathan |last=Schofield |website=BBC |date=3 October 2017 |accessdate=10 March 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925071426/http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/articles/2007/10/03/031007_migrant_history_manchester_feature.shtml |archivedate=25 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ciao, pet: A history of Italian immigration to Newcastle and the North East |first=Mike |last=Kelly |date=23 December 2014 |accessdate=10 March 2017 |newspaper=Newcastle Chronicle |url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/ciao-pet-history-italian-immigration-8305071 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160717081018/http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/ciao-pet-history-italian-immigration-8305071 |archivedate=17 July 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Diaspora"&gt;{{cite web|title=Liverpool as a Diasporic City|first=John|last=Herson|url=http://www.ehs.org.uk/dotAsset/26ce2dec-e3c7-41cc-b1f1-c6af42ade9e4.doc|format=DOC|publisher=Liverpool John Moores University|accessdate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, hundreds of thousands from depressed rural areas of the North emigrated, chiefly to the US, Canada, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref name="Diaspora"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://britishheritage.com/north-british-migration-from-the-irish-sea-to-the-allegheny-mountains/ |title=North British Migration: From the Irish Sea to the Allegheny Mountains |date=12 June 2016 |accessdate=13 March 2017 |first=Clare |last=Hopley |website=British Heritage |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151124035831/http://www.britishheritage.com/north-british-migration-from-the-irish-sea-to-the-allegheny-mountains/ |archivedate=24 November 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oz"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Australian People|chapter=Immigration from Northern England|year=2001|page=300|first=James|last=Jupp|isbn=978-0-521-80789-0|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deindustrialisation and modern history===

The [[First World War]] was the turning point for the economy of Northern England. In the [[interwar Britain|interwar years]], the Northern economy began to be eclipsed by the South – in 1913–1914, unemployment in "outer Britain" (the North, plus Scotland and Wales) was 2.6% while the rate in Southern England was more than double that at 5.5%, but in 1937 during the [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom|Great Depression]] the outer British unemployment rate was 16.1% and the Southern rate was less than half that at 7.1%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|title=Roots of Employment|volume=1|first=Frank Davies|last=Newbury|year=1945|page=1|publisher=Cornell University}}&lt;/ref&gt; The weakening economy and [[Interwar unemployment and poverty in the United Kingdom|interwar unemployment]] caused several episodes of social unrest in the region, including the [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|1926 general strike]] and the [[Jarrow March]]. The Great Depression highlighted the weakness of Northern England's specialised economy: as world trade declined, demand for ships, steel, coal and textiles all fell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Economics of the Great Depression|first=Mark|last=Wheeler|publisher=W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research|year=1998|page=31|isbn=978-0-88099-192-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the most part, Northern factories were still using nineteenth-century technology, and were not able to keep up with advances in industries such as motors, chemicals and electricals, while the expansion of the [[National Grid (Great Britain)|electric grid]] removed the North's advantages in terms of power generation and meant it was now more economic to build new factories in the Midlands or South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Regional Development in the 1990s: The British Isles in Transition|chapter=The Macroeconomic Context|first1=Ron|last1=Martin|first2=Peter|last2=Townroe|page=270|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-03688-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The industrial concentration in Northern England made it a major target for [[Luftwaffe]] attacks during the [[Second World War]]. [[The Blitz]] of 1940–1941 saw major raids on [[Barrow Blitz|Barrow-in-Furness]], [[Hull Blitz|Hull]], [[Leeds Blitz|Leeds]], [[Manchester Blitz|Manchester]], [[Liverpool Blitz|Merseyside]], [[Newcastle Blitz|Newcastle]] and [[Sheffield Blitz|Sheffield]] with thousands killed and significant damage to the cities. Liverpool, a vital port for supplies from North America, was especially hard hit – the city was the most bombed in the UK outside London, with around 4,000 deaths across Merseyside and most of the city centre destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/maritime/exhibitions/blitz/blitz.aspx |title=The Blitz |website=Merseyside Maritime Museum |accessdate=10 March 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160528225044/http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/maritime/exhibitions/blitz/blitz.aspx |archivedate=28 May 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rebuilding that followed, and the simultaneous [[slum clearance]] that saw whole neighbourhoods demolished and rebuilt, transformed the faces of Northern cities.{{sfn|Russell|2004|p=65}} Immigration from the "[[New Commonwealth]]", especially [[Pakistan]] and [[Bangladesh]], starting in the 1950s reshaped Northern England once more, and there are now significant populations from the [[Indian subcontinent]] in towns and cities such as Bradford, Leeds, [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] and Sheffield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Anti-Oppressive Social Work: A Guide for Developing Cultural Competence|first=Siobhan|last=Laird|pages=73–74|year=2008|publisher=SAGE|isbn=978-1-4129-1236-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Northern [[metropolitan county]] councils, which were Labour strongholds often with very left-wing leadership (such as [[Militant in Liverpool|Militant-dominated Liverpool]] and the so-called "[[People's Republic of South Yorkshire]]"), had high-profile conflicts with the national government. The increasing awareness of the North–South divide strengthened the distinct Northern English identity, which, despite regeneration in some of the major cities, remains to this day.&lt;ref name="Thatcherism"/&gt;

The region saw several [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] attacks during [[the Troubles]], including the [[M62 coach bombing]], the [[Warrington bomb attacks]] and the [[1992 Manchester bombing|1992]] and [[1996 Manchester bombing]]s.

Yorkshire and the Humber and the North West both had significant populations of Muslims – 6.2% and 5.1% respectively – while Muslims in the North East made up only 1.8% of the population. All other faiths combined comprised less than 2% of the population in all regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/culturalidentity/religion/articles/religioninenglandandwales2011/2012-12-11#religious-affiliation-across-the-english-regions-and-wales |title=Religion in England and Wales 2011 |publisher=Office for National Statistics |date=11 December 2012 |accessdate=3 March 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215055230/https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/culturalidentity/religion/articles/religioninenglandandwales2011/2012-12-11 |archivedate=15 February 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the 19th century there were no universities in Northern England. The first was the [[University of Durham]], founded in 1832 and sometimes counted with the [[Ancient university|ancient universities]] of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], although it post-dates them by many centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://universityhistories.com/2016/08/12/durham-university-last-of-the-ancient-universities-and-first-of-the-new-1831-1871/ |title=Durham University: Last of the Ancient Universities and First of the New (1831–1871) |date=12 August 2016 |accessdate=7 March 2017 |first=Matthew |last=Andrews |website=University Histories |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160813043134/https://universityhistories.com/2016/08/12/durham-university-last-of-the-ancient-universities-and-first-of-the-new-1831-1871/ |archivedate=13 August 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The next universities built in the North were part of the wave of [[Red brick university|redbrick universities]] of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Sea fishing is an important industry for Northern coastal towns. Major fishing ports include [[Fleetwood]], Grimsby, Hull and Whitby. At its height, Grimsby was the largest fishing port in the world, but the Northern fishing industry suffered greatly from a series of events in the second half of the twentieth century: the [[Cod Wars]] with [[Iceland]] and establishment of the [[exclusive economic zone]] ended British access to rich North Atlantic fishing grounds, while the North Sea was badly [[overfishing|overfished]] and the European [[Common Fisheries Policy]] put strict quotas on catches to protect the almost depleted stocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/our-region/east-yorkshire/how-the-cod-war-of-40-years-ago-left-a-yorkshire-community-devastated-1-7636401 |title=How the Cod War of 40 years ago left a Yorkshire community devastated |date=21 December 2015 |first=John |last=Ledger |newspaper=Yorkshire Post |accessdate=12 March 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161102010528/http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/our-region/east-yorkshire/how-the-cod-war-of-40-years-ago-left-a-yorkshire-community-devastated-1-7636401 |archivedate= 2 November 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BrexitFish"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://time.com/4351849/brexit-grimsby-fishing-capital-eu/ |title=Meet the British Fishermen Who Want Out of the E.U. |first=Tara |last=John |date=6 June 2016 |accessdate=12 March 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161214234822/http://time.com/4351849/brexit-grimsby-fishing-capital-eu/ |archivedate=14 December 2016 |df= |newspaper=TIME}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grimsby is now transitioning to the processing of imported [[seafood]] and to offshore wind to replace its fishing fleet.&lt;ref name="BrexitFish"/&gt;

===Leisure and tourism===
[[File:The Promenade and Tower from South Pier, Blackpool, England-LCCN2002696387.tif|thumb|left|Crowded beaches at Blackpool in the 1890s|alt=A postcard of Blackpool promenade.]]
The expansion of the railway network in the second half of the nineteenth century meant most in the North lived within reach of the coast, and seaside towns saw a major tourism boom. By around 1870 Blackpool on the Lancashire coast had become overwhelmingly the most popular destination – not just for Northern families, but many from the Midlands and Scotland as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Blackpool Landlady: A Social History|first=John|last=Walton|page=40|year=1978|isbn=978-0-7190-0723-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other resorts popular with Northerners included [[Morecambe]] in northern Lancashire, [[Whitley Bay]] near Newcastle, Whitby in [[North Yorkshire]], and [[New Brighton, Merseyside|New Brighton]] on the [[Wirral Peninsula]], as well as [[Rhyl]] over the border in [[North Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite-book|title=Lancashire's Seaside Piers: Also Featuring the Piers of the River Mersey|page=9–13|first=Martin|last=Easdown|isbn=978-1-84563-093-5|publisher=Casemate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Forging"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Forging of the Modern State: Early Industrial Britain, 1783–1870|page=395|isbn=978-1-317-87371-6|first=Eric|last=Evans|publisher=Routledge|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same social forces that had built these resorts in the nineteenth century proved to be their undoing in the twentieth. Transport links continued to improve and it became possible to travel overseas quickly and affordably. The Belgian coast at [[Ostend]] became popular with Northern working-class tourists in the first half of the twentieth century, and the introduction of [[package holiday]]s in the 1970s was the death of most Northern seaside resorts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Review of ''Working-Class Organisations and Popular Tourism, 1840–1970'' |url=http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/458 |website=Reviews in History |accessdate=7 March 2017 |first=John K. |last=Walton |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170210155040/http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/458 |archivedate=10 February 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Blackpool has maintained a focus on tourism, and remains one of the most visited towns in England, but visitor numbers are far below their peak and the town's economy has suffered – both employment rates and average earnings remain below the regional average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Coastal Towns: Session 2005–06|publisher=The Stationery Office|author=Housing, Planning, Local Government and the Regions Committee|page=Ev 140–141|isbn=978-0-215-02841-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The individual regions of the North have had their own identities and cultures for centuries, but with industrialisation, mass media and the opening of the North–South divide, a common Northern identity began to develop. This identity was initially a reactionary response to Southern prejudices—the North of the nineteenth century was largely depicted as a dirty, wild and uncultured place, even in sympathetic depictions such as [[Elizabeth Gaskell]]'s 1855 novel ''[[North and South (Gaskell novel)|North and South]]''{{sfn|Russell|2004|pages=87–88}}—but became an affirmation of what Northerners saw as their own personal strengths.{{sfn|Ehland|2007|page=111}}{{sfn|Russell|2004|page=4}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14797585.2015.1134056?journalCode=rcuv20|title=Theorising northernness and northern culture: the north of England, northern Englishness, and sympathetic magic|year=2016|first=Karl|last=Spacken|doi=10.1080/14797585.2015.1134056|journal=Journal for Cultural Research|volume=20|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traits stereotypically associated with Northern England are [[Honesty|straight-talking]], [[Grit (personality trait)|grit]] and warmheartedness, as compared to the supposedly effete Southerners.{{sfn|Ehland|2007|page=111}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=England|first1=Alan|last1=Allport|first2=George|last2=Wingfield|isbn=978-1-4381-0500-0|page=27|year=2007|publisher=Infobase}}&lt;/ref&gt; Northern England—especially Lancashire, but also Yorkshire and the North East—has a tradition of [[matriarchy|matriarchal]] families, where the [[Housewife|woman of the house]] runs the home and controls the family's finances.

Impressions of Northern English cuisine are still shaped by the working-class diet of the early twentieth century, which was heavy on [[offal]], high in calories and often not particularly healthy. Dishes such as [[black pudding]], [[tripe]], [[mushy peas]] and [[meat pie]] remain stereotypical Northern English foods in the national imagination. As a result, there is a concerted effort among Northern chefs to improve the region's image.&lt;ref name="GrimFood"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/06/food-grim-up-north-pie-mushy-peas-toad-in-the-hole |date=6 January 2015 |title=Of course food isn't grim up north |first=Tony |last=Naylor |accessdate=7 March 2017 |newspaper=The Guardian |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170430221703/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/06/food-grim-up-north-pie-mushy-peas-toad-in-the-hole |archivedate=30 April 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Northern dishes, such as [[Yorkshire pudding]] and [[Lancashire hotpot]] have spread across the UK, and only their names now hint at their origin.

The North is known for its often crumbly cheeses, of which [[Cheshire cheese]] is the earliest example. Unlike Southern cheeses like [[Cheddar cheese|Cheddar]], Northern cheeses typically use uncooked milk and a pre-salted curd pressed under enormous weights, resulting in a moist, sharp-tasting cheese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cheese and Culture: A History of Cheese and its Place in Western Civilization|first=Paul|last=Kindstedt|pages=167–170|year=2012|publisher=Chelsea Green|isbn=978-1-60358-412-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wensleydale, another crumbly cheese, is unusual in that it is often served as a side to sweet cakes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cheeseboard.co.uk/wensleydale |title=Wensleydale |website=British Cheese Board |accessdate=7 March 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402181945/http://cheeseboard.co.uk/wensleydale |archivedate= 2 April 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which are themselves well represented in Northern England.

While a variety of beers are popular across Northern England, the region is especially associated with [[brown ale]]s such as [[Newcastle Brown Ale]], [[Double Maxim Beer Company|Double Maxim]] and [[Samuel Smith's]] Nut Brown Ale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Wine, Beer, and Spirits Handbook: A Guide to Styles and Service|page=327|author=The International Culinary Schools at The Art Institutes, Joseph LaVilla|year=2009|isbn=978-0-470-13884-7|publisher=John Wiley and Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beer in the North is usually served with a thick [[Beer head|head]] which accentuates the nutty, malty flavours preferred in Northern beers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/north-south-beer-divide-is-all-in-the-head-1563621.html|title=North-South beer divide is all in the head|date=15 December 1992|first=Michael|last=Jackson|newspaper=The Independent|accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the non-alcoholic side, the North – in particular, Lancashire – was the hub of the [[temperance bar]] movement which popularised [[soft drink]]s such as [[dandelion and burdock]], [[Tizer]] and [[Vimto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Northside – Andrew Martin remembers dandelion and burdock|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/node/158082|first=Andrew|last=Martin|newspaper=New Statesman|date=21 July 2003|accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lost Britain: An A-Z of Forgotten Landmarks and Lost Traditions|first=David|last=Long|isbn=978-1-78243-441-2|year=2015|publisher=Michael O'Mara}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contrasting geography of Northern England is reflected in its literature. On the one hand, the wild moors and lakes have inspired generations of [[Romantic literature in English|Romantic]] authors: the poetry of [[William Wordsworth]] and the novels of the [[Brontë family|Brontë sisters]] are perhaps the most famous examples of writing inspired by these elemental forces. Classics of [[children's literature]] such as ''[[The Railway Children]]'' (1906), ''[[The Secret Garden]]'' (1911) and ''[[Swallows and Amazons]]'' (1930) portray these largely untouched landscapes as worlds of adventure and transformation where their protagonists can break free of the restrictions of society.{{sfn|Cockin|2012|p=218}} Modern poets such as the former [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|Poet Laureate]] [[Ted Hughes]] and [[Oxford Professor of Poetry]] Simon Armitage have found inspiration in the Northern countryside, producing works that take advantage of the sounds and rhythms of Northern English dialects.&lt;ref name="NSBooks"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/2013/11/heathcliff-and-angry-young-men |title=The A-Z of northern fiction |first1=Frances |last1=Wilson |first2=Philip |last2=Maughan |newspaper=New Statesman |date=5 December 2013 |accessdate=23 March 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425100219/http://www.newstatesman.com/2013/11/heathcliff-and-angry-young-men |archivedate=25 April 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Melvyn |last=Bragg |authorlink=Melvyn Bragg |title=London?

Meanwhile, the industrialising and urbanising cities of the North gave rise to many masterpieces of [[social realism]]. Elizabeth Gaskell was the first in a lineage of female realist writers from the North that later included [[Winifred Holtby]], [[Catherine Cookson]], [[Beryl Bainbridge]] and [[Jeanette Winterson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Woman's Historical Novel: British Women Writers, 1900–2000|first=D. |last=Wallace|page=20|year=2004|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-230-50594-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the [[angry young men]] of post-war literature were Northern, and working-class life in the face of deindustrialisation is depicted in novels such as ''[[Room at the Top (novel)|Room at the Top]]'' (1959), ''[[Billy Liar]]'' (1959), ''[[This Sporting Life (novel)|This Sporting Life]]'' (1960) and ''[[A Kestrel for a Knave]]'' (1968).&lt;ref name="NSBooks"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|contribution=Introduction|contributor-first=Blake|contributor-last=Morrison|title=Billy Liar|year=2010|orig-year=1959|first=Keith|last=Waterhouse|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0-14-195803-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sport has been both one of the most unifying cultural forces in Northern England and, thanks to local rivalries such as the Lancashire–Yorkshire [[Roses rivalry]], one of the most divisive. As huge numbers of people moved into recently-built cities with little cultural heritage, local sports teams offered the population a sense of place and identity that was otherwise absent.&lt;ref name="SportAndWorkingClasses"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sport and the Working Classes |first=Mona |last=Dobre-Laza |publisher=the British Council |accessdate=6 March 2017 |pages=6–7 |format=PDF |url=http://www.pages.drexel.edu/~rosenl/sports%20Folder/Sport%20and%20the%20Working%20Classes.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123055332/http://www.pages.drexel.edu/~rosenl/sports%20Folder/Sport%20and%20the%20Working%20Classes.pdf |archivedate=23 November 2015 |df= }} Adapted from {{cite book|title=The British at Play – a social history of British sport from 1600 to the present|first=Nigel|last=Townson|year=1997|publisher=Cavallioti Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many early Northern sports players were working class and needed to miss work to play, with their teams compensating them for lost wages. By contrast, Southern teams, drawing from the traditions of [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public schools]] and [[Oxbridge]], put great emphasis on [[Amateur sports|amateurism]] and the Southern-dominated governing bodies forbade payments to players. This tension shaped the sports of [[association football]] and [[cricket (sport)|cricket]], and led to the schism between the two main forms of [[Rugby football|rugby]]. The North is also associated with the [[animal sport]]s of [[dog racing]] with [[whippet]]s, [[pigeon racing]] and [[ferret legging]], although these are now far more popular in stereotype than in reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/opinion/andrew-vine-it-s-time-to-drop-the-yorkshire-stereotypes-1-6779681|title=It's time to drop the Yorkshire stereotypes|first=Andrew|last=Vine|date=12 August 2014|accessdate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Holder|2005|page=49}}

The first football club in the UK was [[Sheffield F.C.]], founded in 1857. Early Northern football teams tended to adopt the [[Sheffield Rules]] rather than the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Football Association Rules]], but the two codes were merged in 1877.

In response, Preston withdrew from the competition and fellow Lancashire clubs [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] and [[Great Lever F.C.|Great Lever]] followed suit.

The [[Rugby Football Union]], which enforced amateurism, suspended teams who compensated their players for missed work and injury, leading teams from Lancashire, Yorkshire and surrounding areas to split away in 1895 and form the [[Rugby Football League]]. Over time, the RFU and RFL adopted different rules and the two forms of the game – [[rugby union]] and [[rugby league]] – diverged.

Cricket has a strong following in Northern England, and three counties are represented by [[first-class cricket|first-class]] [[county cricket]] teams: [[Durham County Cricket Club|Durham]], [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]] and [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire]]. The [[Roses Match]] (named for the [[Red Rose of Lancaster]] and the [[White Rose of York]]) between Lancashire and Yorkshire is one of the hardest fought rivalries in the sport – the pride of both sides, and their determination not to lose, resulted in the teams developing a slow, stubborn and defensive style that proved unpopular elsewhere in the country.&lt;ref name="S&amp;E"&gt;{{cite book|title=Sport and the English, 1918–1939|pages=150–151|year=2006|first1=Mike|last1=Huggins|first2=Jack|last2=Williams|publisher=Taylor and Francis|isbn=978-0-415-33185-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The London-based [[Marylebone Cricket Club]], which controlled the game at the time, selected few Northern players for [[Test cricket|Test matches]], and this was perceived as a snub to their playing style – the anger united Lancashire and Yorkshire against the South and helped cast a shared Northern identity that transcended the Roses rivalry.&lt;ref name="S&amp;E"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Danced"&gt;{{cite-book|title=We Danced All Night: A Social History of Britain Between the Wars|page=423–424|first=Martin|last=Pugh| authorlink = Martin Pugh (author)|year=2013|isbn=978-1-4481-6274-1|publisher=Random House}}&lt;/ref&gt; This divide was illustrated in the [[1924 County Championship]], when Yorkshire beat London-based [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]] to claim the title. [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] accused Yorkshire of scuffing the pitch and intimidating the [[bowling (cricket)|bowlers]], while the match with Middlesex was so vicious that the team threatened to never play in Yorkshire again.&lt;ref name="S&amp;E"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Danced"/&gt; The Lancashire captain [[Jack Sharp]] on the other hand was quoted as saying "I'm real glad a rose won it.

Although Yorkshire and Lancashire were traditionally more relaxed about professionalism than other counties, cricket did not see the same regional schisms on the topic that rugby and football did – there were debates over [[amateur status in first-class cricket]], but these tensions were given release in the [[Gentlemen v Players]] fixture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Amateurism in British Sport: It Matters Not Who Won Or Lost? |first=Jack |last= Williams |chapter= 'The Really Good Professional Captain Has Never Been Seen!': Perceptions of the Amateur/Professional Divide in County Cricket, 1900–39 |pages=87–91 |isbn= 978-1-136-80290-4 |publisher= Routledge}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the annual [[North v South]] games were among the most popular and competitive in the sport, running annually from 1849 until 1900 and intermittently thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= And God Created Cricket |first=Simon |last=Hughes |pages=64–65 |authorlink= Simon Hughes (cricketer) |isbn= 978-1-4464-2247-2 |year= 2010 |publisher= Random House}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christianity]] has been the largest religion in the region since the Early Middle Ages; its existence in Britain dates back to the late Roman era and the arrival of [[Celtic Christianity]].

The North of England pioneered [[rail transport]]. Milestones include the 1758 [[Middleton Railway]] in Leeds, the first railway authorised by [[Act of Parliament]] and the oldest continually operating in the world; the 1825 [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]], the first public railway to use [[steam locomotives]]; and the 1830 [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]], the first modern main line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Privatized Infrastructure: The Role of Government|pages=19–20|first=Adrian J.|last=Smith|year=1999|publisher=Thomas Telford|isbn=978-0-7277-2712-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today the region retains many of its original railway lines, including the [[East Coast Main Line|East Coast]] and [[West Coast Main Line|West Coast]] main lines and the [[Cross Country Route]]. Passenger numbers on Northern routes increased over 50% between 2004 and 2016, and Northern England handles over half of total UK [[rail freight]], but infrastructure is poorly funded compared to Southern railways: railways in London received £5426 per resident in 2015 while those in the North East received just £223 per resident, and journeys between major cities are slow and overcrowded.{{sfn|Highways England|2016|page=16}}&lt;ref name="RJ"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.railjournal.com/index.php/europe/northern-englands-railways-under-election-spotlight.html|title=Northern England's railways under election spotlight|first=Keith|last=Barrow|date=12 May 2015|accessdate=4 March 2017|publisher=Rail Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; To combat this, the [[Department of Transport]] has devolved many of its powers to Rail North, an alliance of local authorities from the Scottish Borders down to Staffordshire which manages the [[Northern (train operating company)|Northern Rail]] and [[TransPennine Express]] franchises that operate many routes in Northern England.&lt;ref name="RJ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.railnorth.org/news/new-franchises-herald-new-era-for-norths-rail-passengers/ |title=New franchises herald new era for North's rail passengers |date=1 April 2016 |accessdate=4 March 2017 |publisher=Rail North |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220175957/http://www.railnorth.org/news/new-franchises-herald-new-era-for-norths-rail-passengers/ |archivedate=20 December 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, new build such as the [[Northern Hub]] around Manchester, [[High Speed 2]] from Manchester and Leeds to London and [[Northern Powerhouse Rail]] from Liverpool to Hull and Newcastle is planned to increase capacity on important Northern routes and decrease travel times.&lt;ref name="RJ"/&gt;

'''Osama bin Laden's house in Khartoum''' is a pink and beige brick-and-stucco three-storey house on Al-Mashtal Street in the affluent [[Al-Riyadh]] quarter of [[Khartoum]], [[Sudan]], where [[Osama bin Laden]] lived between 1991 and 1996.&lt;ref name="Reeve2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Reeve|first=Simon|title=The new jackals: Ramzi Yousef, Osama Bin Laden and the future of terrorism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VQjpziNmoE4C&amp;pg=PA172|accessdate=7 May 2011|date=27 June 2002|publisher=UPNE|isbn=978-1-55553-509-4|page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sudan.net/completenews.php?nsid=1043&amp;cid=1|title=Bin Laden's Sudan home left empty over attack fears|publisher=Sudan.net, [[Reuters]]|accessdate=7 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Osama bin Laden portrait cropped.jpg|thumb|left|[[Osama bin Laden]]]]
Bin Laden arrived in Sudan in 1991 after falling out with [[Saudi Arabia]]'s ruling family over their support for the [[United States]] in the [[Gulf War]] against [[Iraq]]. He purchased this property and another in [[Soba (city)|Soba]], a one storey unfurnished mud house on the western bank &lt;ref name="ShayLiberman2006"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shay|first1=Shaul|last2=Liberman|first2=Rachel|title=The Red Sea terror triangle: Sudan, Somalia, Yemen, and Islamic terror|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v2ss0vor_DkC&amp;pg=PA43|accessdate=7 May 2011|date=13 October 2006|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-1-4128-0620-6|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; overlooking the [[Blue Nile]]&lt;ref name="Reeve2002,p.175"&gt;Reeve2002,p.175&lt;/ref&gt; where he spent many weekends with his family. He lived in Sudan with his four wives, four sons and daughter.&lt;ref name="Reeve2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ShayLiberman2006"/&gt; Although extremely wealthy, both houses were described as very modest on purpose to adhere to his ideals of humble living.&lt;ref name="Landau2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Landau|first=Elaine|title=Osama bin Laden: a war against the West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kL7GCEWlCFcC&amp;pg=PA58|accessdate=7 May 2011|date=1 January 2002|publisher=Twenty-First Century Books|isbn=978-0-7613-1709-8|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time in the country he heavily invested in the infrastructure and in agriculture and businesses.

Although the house was heavily guarded with guards armed with machine guns on the ground floor,&lt;ref name="Bergen2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bergen|first=Peter L.|title=The Osama Bin Laden I Know: An Oral History of Al Qaeda's Leader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_5bmzlNx1iAC&amp;pg=PA133|accessdate=7 May 2011|date=8 August 2006|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-7432-7892-8|pages=133–136}}&lt;/ref&gt; bin Laden once missed an assassination attempt at this house attempted by [[Takfiri]]s, an ultra extremist group who considered bin Laden's ways as [[Heresy|heretic]]. Following this attack, his house was made more secure with more guards and [[trench]]es dug in front and back of the house. This caused inconvenience to his neighbours who then wished that bin Laden would leave their neighbourhood.&lt;ref name="Bergen2006"/&gt; After living in Sudan for more than 4 years, he left Sudan in May 1996, bitterly disappointed with political developments in the country he had invested so much in.&lt;ref name="Bergen2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jacquard2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacquard|first=Roland|title=In the name of Osama bin Laden: global terrorism &amp; the bin Laden brotherhood|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ffYjXhw4yOUC&amp;pg=PA37|accessdate=7 May 2011|date=January 2002|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0-8223-2991-6|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The property has remained vacant since bin Laden was expelled from the country in 1996 because tenants feared that the United States might bomb it.&lt;ref name="SN"/&gt; However, it is also reported that [[China]] made it their [[Embassy]].&lt;ref name="Bergen2006"/&gt;

==Description==
Richard Miniter describes the house as follows: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;On El Meshtal Street, a visitor finds bin Laden's walled compound. The exterior walls are pink and faded to filth. The house is not the most opulent in this Sudanese version of [[Bel Air, Los Angeles|Bel Air]]. It is a vaguely [[Art Deco]] affair, three stories high, with a ridge running up its front. Everything about the exterior of the house indicates comfort. An aluminium-frame walkway topped with thin wooden slats assures shade from the driveway to the front door. Air conditioners hum.&lt;ref name="Miniter2004"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The house was secured with a compound wall, painted pink but faded. At the sides of the house are a series of walled-in compounds.&lt;ref name="Miniter2004"/&gt; This house was much more spacious and comfortable than the houses he lived in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]] and bin Laden kept his office on second floor. He would even meet people in the open yard in front of his house.&lt;ref name="Miniter2004"/&gt; He also owned guest houses across the street which he purchased as homes for his top officers.&lt;ref name="Miniter2004"/&gt;

It is also said that bin Laden lived a very simple life. He owned no vehicles, and used no modern home appliances such as a [[refrigerator]] or [[air conditioner]]. He was reportedly also involved in experimental farming including [[Al-Damazin Farms]].&lt;ref name="Bergen2006"/&gt; Today, the gate to bin Laden's old house is tightly shut, and the unkempt garden and wild tree branches growing over the wall stand out in such a wealthy, well-maintained part of the city.&lt;ref name="SN"/&gt;

Regions north of the line tend to be [[Temperate climate|temperate]] or [[frigid zone|frigid]], with [[snow]] being a regular feature in winter. Regions south of the line tend to be [[subtropical]] and [[tropical]]. The south is hotter and wetter than the north.

Historically, the North was more developed (employing the latest technology of that time) than the South. But much has changed in recent times, and half of the most developed [[List of cities in China#Tier system|Tier 1 cities]] of China are in the South. It was also in the [[Ming dynasty]] that the economy of the South outpaced that of the North.&lt;ref name="li" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journalism.hkbu.edu.hk/feed/?p=779|title=Living Below China’s Qinling-Huaihe Line Leaves Many Southerners in the Cold|website=www.journalism.hkbu.edu.hk|publisher=Hong Kong University|accessdate=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays, most people acknowledge that divisions within Chinese society do not fall neatly into "north and south" divisions, because of the significant overlap in many [[List of regions of the People's Republic of China|regions of China]].

[[File:China - Southern Song Dynasty-en.svg|thumb|300px|China in the 12th century. The north of the Qinling Huaihe Line was under control of the [[Jin dynasty (1115-1234)|Jin dynasty]], while the south was under control of the [[Song dynasty]].]]
Qinling Huaihe line was first drawn by Chinese geographer Zhang Xiangwen in 1908, defining north China as anything above a line running along the Qinling Mountains in the west and the Huai River the east.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenational.ae/uae/china-s-unlikely-divide-over-home-heat-1.270578|title=China's unlikely divide over home heat|work=The National|access-date=2018-04-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, Premier [[Zhou Enlai]] used the line to create a subsidized district heating system only in the colder north, a system still in effect today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eco-business.com/news/three-year-cut-to-life-expectancy-from-coal-heating/|title=Three-year cut to life expectancy from coal heating|last=Feng|first=Hao|date=2017-12-14|work=Eco-Business|access-date=2018-04-04|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/old-central-heating-rule-leaves-old-shanghai-neighbourhood-shivering-in-winter|title=Old central heating rule leaves old Shanghai neighbourhood shivering in winter|last=hermesauto|date=2018-01-04|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2018-04-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has also led to the north to suffer from heavy air pollution due to coal heating plants, but the south to suffer from lack of heating during the winter months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://qz.com/544419/northern-chinas-dilemma-if-you-want-heat-in-the-winter-it-comes-with-toxic-fumes/|title=Northern China’s dilemma—if you want heat in the winter, it comes with toxic air pollution — Quartz|last=Huang|first=Zheping|website=qz.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The line also represents the 800mm annual [[precipitation]] line of China.&lt;ref name="yan"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=S.S.|first1=Li|last2=J.P.|first2=Yan|last3=J|first3=Wan|title=The characteristics of temperature change in Qinling Mountains|journal=Scientia Geographica Sincia|date=1 June 2012|volume=32|issue=7|pages=853–858}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trout began his career in [[Arkansas]] [[State school|public schools]], for which he taught for nine years. From 1936 to 1939, he taught the seventh grade and served as a [[Principal (school)|principal]] in [[Minden, Louisiana|Minden]] in [[Webster Parish, Louisiana|Webster Parish]] west of Ruston. He then served from 1942 to 1946 in the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War II]], stationed in the [[Pacific Theater of World War II|Central Pacific]] in [[Hawaii]] and the [[Caroline Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;[[American Legion]], "Men &amp; Women in World War II from Lincoln, Morehouse &amp; Union Parishes,'' Victory Publishers, 1946&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, Trout returned to Minden as a school principal&lt;ref name=whoswho/&gt; but in 1947 joined the Louisiana Tech faculty with responsibilities in [[geography]] and sociology.&lt;ref name=mph/&gt; He retired effective September 22, 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Confirmed by the Human Resources Office, Louisiana Tech University.&lt;/ref&gt; Trout held membership in [[Alpha Kappa Delta]], the honor society for sociology, and [[Phi Delta Kappa]], an organization of educators.&lt;ref name=mph/&gt; He was also affiliated with the Southwestern Sociological Association, the Southwest Social Sciences Association, and the [[Lions International]].&lt;ref name=whoswho/&gt;

He is included in a past edition of ''Who's Who in the American Southwest'' and ''Who's Who in America.'' To accommodate the beginning of [[Segregation in the United States|desegregation]], Trout served on the [[Lincoln Parish, Louisiana|Lincoln Parish]] Bi-Racial Committee. He also was a board member of the Ruston Housing Authority. In 1961, Trout was named the Louisiana delegate to the [[White House Conference on Aging]].&lt;ref name=whoswho/&gt; He frequently lectured at civic clubs and within the education system, often peppering his talks with sociological statistics that he had gathered and researched.&lt;ref name=trout/&gt;

On April 10, 1952, Trout married the former Rita Virginia Galloway (1916–2013), a native of [[Arcadia, Louisiana|Arcadia]] in [[Bienville Parish, Louisiana|Bienville Parish]], who was divorced from Rawson Fisher Stovall, Jr. (1913-1946), of [[Dodson, Louisiana|Dodson]] in [[Winn Parish, Louisiana|Winn Parish]].

[[File:A cosmic sense of scale.webm|thumb|This animation gives a sense of the awe-inspiring scale of some of the known objects in our universe.]]

In sciences such as [[physics]], [[geography]], [[astronomy]], [[meteorology]] and [[statistics]], the term '''scale''' or '''spatial scale''' is used for describing or classifying with large approximation the extent or size of a length, distance or area studied or described. For instance, in physics an object or phenomenon can be called microscopic if too small to be visible. In [[climatology]], a [[micro-climate]] is a [[climate]] which might occur in a [[mountain]], [[valley]] or near a lake shore, whereas in [[statistics]] a megatrend is a political, social, economical, environmental or technological [[Trend (statistics)|trend]] which involves the whole [[planet]] or is supposed to last a very large amount of time.

In physics, the concept of scale is closely related to the more accurate concept of [[order of magnitude]].

These divisions are somewhat arbitrary; where, on this table, ''mega-'' is assigned global scope, it may only apply continentally or even regionally in other contexts. The interpretations of ''meso-'' and ''macro-'' must then be adjusted accordingly.

They greatly affect in-town movement and [[traffic]]. Street networks can become very complex in cities. Street networks are very often localized, because there is little non-highway transportation from town to town. The [[United States Numbered Highways|U.S. Highway System]] is like a street network, but it is national, and consists of [[highway]]s instead of streets and roads.

'''Telephone numbers in [[Macau]]''' are eight-digit numbers. Fixed land line numbers starts with 2, and Mobile (cellular) phone numbers starts with 6. Calls from Macau to [[mainland China]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Portugal]] are treated as international calls.

The telephone number for emergency services – [[Public Security Police Force of Macau|Police]], [[Corpo de Bombeiros de Macau|Fire Service and Ambulance]] – is [[999 (emergency telephone number)|999]] for all telephone lines. In addition to 999, two more emergency hotline numbers 110 (mainly for tourists from mainland China) and 112 (mainly for tourists from overseas) can be dialed, however calls made to 110 and 112 are redirected to the 999 call centre.

==Government regulator==

Prior to 1999 telephone regulation was under the '''Direcção dos Serviços de Correios e Telecomunicações (CTT)''' or '''Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones''' under the [[Secretary for Transport and Public Works]].

Since 1999 telephone numbers are under the responsibility of the '''Direcção dos Serviços de Regulação de Telecomunicações (DSRT)''' or '''Bureau of Telecommunications Regulation''' under the [[Secretariat for Transport and Public Works (Macau)|Secretariat for Transport and Public Works]].

'''Planning theory''' is the body of scientific concepts, definitions, behavioral relationships, and assumptions that define the body of knowledge of urban planning. There are eight procedural theories of planning that remain the principal theories of planning procedure today: the rational-comprehensive approach, the incremental approach, the transactive approach, the communicative approach, the advocacy approach, the equity approach, the radical approach, and the humanist or phenomenological approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = How Planners Use Planning Theory| url = http://www.planetizen.com/node/73570/how-planners-use-planning-theory | accessdate = April 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The modern origins of urban planning lie in the movement for urban reform that arose as a reaction against the disorder of the [[industrial city]] in the mid-19th century. Urban planning exists in various forms and it addresses many different issues.&lt;ref&gt;Van Assche, K., Beunen, R., Duineveld, M., De Jong, H. (2012) ''[http://plt.sagepub.com/content/12/2/177.short Co-evolutions of planning and design]''. [[Planning Theory]] 12(2): 177-192&lt;/ref&gt; Urban planning can include [[urban renewal]], by adapting urban planning methods to existing cities suffering from decline. Alternatively, it can concern the massive challenges associated with urban growth, particularly in the [[Global South]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | year=2013 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink1= Paul James (academic) | last2= Holden | first2=Meg | last3= Lewin | first3= Mary | last4= Neilson | first4= Lyndsay | last5= Oakley | first5= Christine | last6= Truter | first6= Art | last7= Wilmoth | first7= David | chapter= Managing Metropolises by Negotiating Mega-Urban Growth | title= Institutional and Social Innovation for Sustainable Urban Development | editor= Harald Mieg and Klaus Töpfer | url=https://www.academia.edu/7207756/Managing_Metropolises_by_Negotiating_Mega-Urban_Growth | publisher= Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 20th century, the term [[sustainable development]] has come to represent an ideal outcome in the sum of all planning goals.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, Stephen (2004). "Planning Sustainable and Livable Cities", Routledge; 3rd edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Blueprint planning ==

Following the rise of empiricism during the industrial revolution, the rational planning movement (1890–1960) emphasized the improvement of the built environment based on key spatial factors. Examples of these factors include: exposure to direct sunlight, movement of vehicular traffic, standardized housing units, and proximity to green-space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Peter|title=The Cities of Tomorrow|year=2008|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=978-0-631-23252-0|pages=13–141}}&lt;/ref&gt; To identify and design for these spatial factors, rational planning relied on a small group of highly specialized technicians, including architects, urban designers, and engineers. Other, less common, but nonetheless influential groups included governmental officials, private developers, and landscape architects. Through the strategies associated with these professions, the rational planning movement developed a collection of techniques for quantitative assessment, predictive modeling, and design. Due to the high level of training required to grasp these methods, however, rational planning fails to provide an avenue for public participation. In both theory and practice, this shortcoming opened rational planning to claims of elitism and social insensitivity.

Although it can be seen as an extension of the sort of civic pragmatism seen in Oglethorpe's plan for Savannah or William Penn's plan for Philadelphia, the roots of the rational planning movement lie in Britain's Sanitary Movement (1800-1890).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Peter|title=The Cities of Tomorrow|year=2008|publisher=Blackwell|location=Publishing|isbn=978-0-631-23252-0|pages=13–47, 87–141}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, advocates such as [[Charles Booth (philanthropist)|Charles Booth]] and [[Ebenezer Howard]] argued for central organized, top-down solutions to the problems of industrializing cities. In keeping with the rising power of industry, the source of planning authority in the Sanitary Movement included both traditional governmental offices and private development corporations.  In London and its surrounding suburbs, cooperation between these two entities created a network of new communities clustered around the expanding rail system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Peter|title=The Cities of Tomorrow|year=2008|publisher=Blackwell|location=Publishing|isbn=978-0-631-23252-0|pages=48–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the best examples of these communities are [[Letchworth]] in Hertfordshire and [[Hampstead Garden Suburb]] in Greater London. In both communities, architects [[Raymond Unwin]] and [[Richard Barry Parker]] exemplify the elite, top-down approach associated with the rational planning movement by using the planning process to establish a uniform landscape and architectural style based on an idealized medieval village.

From Britain, the rational planning movement spread out across the world. In areas undergoing industrialization themselves, British influences combined with local movements to create unique reinterpretations of the rational planning process. In Paris, architect [[Le Corbusier]] adopted rational planning's centralized approach and added to it a dedication to quantitative assessment and a love for the automobile. Together, these two factors yielded the influential planning aesthetic known as "Tower in the Park".  In the United States, [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] similarly identified vehicular mobility as a principal planning metric. However, where Le Corbusier emphasized design through quantitative assessment of spatial processes, Wright identified the insights of local public technicians as the key design criteria. Wright's [[Broadacre City]] provides a vivid expression of what this landscape might look like.

Throughout both the United States and Europe, the rational planning movement declined in the later half of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Planning Futures: New Directions for Planning Theory|first=Philip|last=Allmendinger|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|pages=20–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for the movement's decline was also its strength. By focusing so much on design by technical elites, rational planning lost touch with the public it hoped to serve. Key events in this decline in the United States include the demolition of the Pruitt-Igoe housing project in St. Louis and the national backlash against urban renewal projects, particularly urban expressway projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Transportation: A Geographical Analysis|last=Black|first=William R.|page=29|publisher=The Guilford Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synoptic planning ==
After the “fall” of blueprint planning in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the synoptic model began to emerge as a dominant force in planning. Lane (2005) describes synoptic planning as having four central elements:

:"(1) an enhanced emphasis on the specification of goals and targets; (2) an emphasis on quantitative analysis and predication of the environment; (3) a concern to identify and evaluate alternative policy options; and (4) the evaluation of means against ends (page 289)."&lt;ref name="Lane"&gt;Lane, M. B. (2005). Public Participation in Planning: An Intellectual History. [[Australian Geographer]] , 36 (3), 283–299&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Public participation]] was first introduced into this model and it was generally integrated into the system process described above. However, the problem was that the idea of a single public interest still dominated attitudes, effectively devaluing the importance of participation because it suggests the idea that the public interest is relatively easy to find and only requires the most minimal form of participation.&lt;ref name="Lane"/&gt;

Blueprint and synoptic planning both employ what is called the rational paradigm of planning. The rational model is perhaps the most widely accepted model among planning practitioners and scholars, and is considered by many to be the orthodox view of planning. As its name clearly suggests, the goal of the rational model is to make planning as rational and systematic as possible. Proponents of this paradigm would generally come up with a list of steps that the planning process can be at least relatively neatly sorted out into and that planning practitioners should go through in order when setting out to plan in virtually any area. As noted above, this paradigm has clear implications for public involvement in planning decisions.&lt;ref name="Lane"/&gt;

== Participatory planning ==
[[File:Keskustelutilaisuus Helsingin yleiskaavasta.jpg|thumb|A public consultation event about urban planning in Helsinki]]
'''Participatory planning''' is an urban planning [[paradigm]] that emphasizes involving the entire community in the strategic and management processes of urban planning; or, community-level planning processes, urban or rural. It is often considered as part of [[community development]].&lt;ref name="REFALPHA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifad.org/pub/bsf/cppe/cppe.pdf|title= Comprehensive Participatory Planning and Evaluation|publisher=IFAD|accessdate=2008-10-21| format=PDF| date=December 2000| last=Lefevre | first=Pierre|last2=Kolsteren|first2=Patrick| last3=De Wael| first3=Marie-Paule | last4=Byekwaso| first4=Francis | last5= Beghin|first5=Ivan|location=Antwerp, Belgium}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participatory planning aims to harmonize views among all of its participants as well as prevent conflict between opposing parties. In addition, marginalized groups have an opportunity to participate in the planning process.&lt;ref&gt;[McTague, C. &amp; Jakubowski, S. Marching to the beat of a silent drum: Wasted consensus-building and failed neighborhood participatory planning. Applied Geography 44, 182–191 (2013)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Incrementalism ==

Beginning in the late 1950s and early 1960s, critiques of the rational paradigm began to emerge and formed into several different schools of planning thought. The first of these schools is Lindblom’s [[incrementalism]]. Lindblom describes planning as “muddling through” and thought that practical planning required decisions to be made incrementally. This incremental approach meant choosing from small number of policy approaches that can only have a small number consequences and are firmly bounded by reality, constantly adjusting the objectives of the planning process and using multiple analyses and evaluations.&lt;ref name="Linblom"&gt;Lindblom, C. E. (1959). The science of "muddling through". Public Administration Review, 19 (2), 79–88.&lt;/ref&gt; Lane (2005) explains the public involvement implications of this philosophy. Though this perspective of planning could be considered a large step forward in that it recognizes that there are number of “public interests” and because it provides room for the planning process to be less centralized and incorporate the voices other than those of planners, it in practice would only allow for the public to be involved in a minimal, more reactive rather than proactive way.&lt;ref name="Lane"/&gt;

== Mixed scanning model ==
The mixed scanning model, developed by Etzioni, takes a similar, but slightly different approach. Etzioni (1968) suggested that organizations plan on two different levels: the tactical and the strategic. He posited that organizations could accomplish this by essentially scanning the environment on multiple levels and then choose different strategies and tactics to address what they found there. While Lindblom’s approach only operated on the functional level Etzioni argued, the mixed scanning approach would allow planning organizations to work on both the functional and more big-picture oriented levels.&lt;ref name="Etzioni"&gt;Etzioni, A. (1968). The active society: a theory of societal and political rocesses. New York: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Lane explains though, that this model does not do much more at improving public involvement since the planner or planning organization is still at its focus and since its goal is not necessarily to achieve consensus or reconcile differing points of view on a particular subject.

By the late 1960s and early 1970s, planners began to look for new approaches because as happened nearly a decade before, it was realized that the current models were not necessarily sufficient. As had happened before, a number of different models emerged. Lane (2005) notes that it is most useful to think of these model as emerging from a social transformation planning tradition as opposed to a social guidance one, so the emphasis is more bottom-up in nature than it is top-down.&lt;ref name="Lane"/&gt;

== Transactive planning ==

Transactive planning was a radical break from previous models. Instead of considering public participation as method that would be used in addition to the normal training planning process, participation was a central goal. For the first time, the public was encouraged to take on an active role in the policy setting process, while the planner took on the role of a distributor of information and a feedback source.&lt;ref name="Lane"/&gt; Transactive planning focuses on interpersonal dialogue that develops ideas, which will be turned into action. One of the central goals is mutual learning where the planner gets more information on the community and citizens become more educated about planning issues.&lt;ref name="Friedman"&gt;Friedman, J. (1973). Retracking America: A Theory of Transactive Planning. Garden City, NJ: Anchor Press/Doubleday.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advocacy planning ==
Formulated in the 1960s by lawyer and planning scholar [[Paul Davidoff]], the advocacy planning model takes the perspective that there are large inequalities in the political system and in the bargaining process between groups that result in large numbers of people unorganized and unrepresented in the process. It concerns itself with ensuring that all people are equally represented in the planning process by advocating for the interests of the underprivileged and seeking social change.&lt;ref name="Davidoff"&gt;Davidoff, P. (1965). Advocacy and Pluralism in Planning. Journal of the American Institute of Planners, 31 (4), 331–338.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maziotti"&gt;Mazziotti, D. F. (1982). The underlying assumptions of advocacy planning: pluralism and reform. In C. Paris (Ed.), Critical readings in planning theory (pp. 207–227) New York: Pergamon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Again, public participation is a central tenet of this model. A plurality of public interests is assumed, and the role of planner is essentially the one as a facilitator who either advocates directly for underrepresented groups directly or encourages them to become part of the process.&lt;ref name="Lane"/&gt;

==Radical Planning==
Radical planning is a stream of [[urban planning]] which seeks to manage development in an [[Equity (economics)|equitable]] and [[community]]-based manner. The seminal text to the radical planning movement is ''Foundations for a Radical Concept in Planning'' (1973), by [[Stephen Grabow]] and [[Allen Heskin]].  Grabow and Heskin provided a critique of planning as elitist, centralizing and change-resistant, and proposed a new paradigm based upon systems change, decentralization, communal society, facilitation of human development and a consideration of ecology.  Grab ow and He-skin were joined by ''Head of Department of Town Planning'' from the [[Polytechnic of the South Bank]] [[Shean McConnell]], and his 1981 work ''Theories for Planning''.

In 1987 [[John Friedman]] entered the fray with ''Planning in the Public Domain: From Knowledge to Action'', promoting a radical planning model based on “decolonization”, “democratization”, “self-empowerment” and “reaching out”.  Friedman described this model as an “agropolitan development” paradigm, emphasising the re-localisation of [[primary production]] and [[manufacture]].  In “Toward a Non-[[Euclidean zoning|Euclidian]] Mode of Planning" (1993) Friedman further promoted the urgency of decentralizing planning, advocating a planning paradigm that is normative, innovative, political, transactive and based on a [[Social learning (planning theory)|Social learning]] approach to knowledge and policy.

== Bargaining model ==
The bargaining model views planning as the result of give and take on the part of a number of interests who are all involved in the process. It argues that this bargaining is the best way to conduct planning within the bounds of legal and political institutions.&lt;ref name="McDonald"&gt;McDonald, G. T. (1989). Rural Land Use Planning Decisions by Bargaining. Journal of Rural Studies, 5 (4), 325–335.&lt;/ref&gt; The most interesting part of this theory of planning is that makes public participation the central dynamic in the decision-making process. Decisions are made first and foremost by the public, and the planner plays a more minor role.&lt;ref name="Lane"/&gt;

== Communicative approach ==
{{Main article|Communicative planning}}
The communicative approach to planning is perhaps the most difficult to explain. It focuses on using communication to help different interests in the process understand each other. The idea is that each individual will approach a conversation with his or her own subjective experience in mind and that from that conservation shared goals and possibilities will emerge. Again, participation plays a central role under this model. The model seeks to include as a broad range of voice to enhance the debate and negotiation that is supposed to form the core of actual plan making. In this model, participation is actually fundamental to the planning process happening. Without the involvement of concerned interests there is no planning.&lt;ref name="Lane"/&gt; [[Bent Flyvbjerg]] and Tim Richardson have developed a critique of the communicative approach and an alternative theory based on an understanding of power and how it works in planning.&lt;ref&gt;Flyvbjerg, Bent, 1996, “The Dark Side of Planning: Rationality and ''Realrationalität''”, in Seymour J. Mandelbaum, Luigi Mazza, and Robert W. Burchell, eds., ''Explorations in Planning Theory''. New Brunswick, NJ: Center for Urban Policy Research Press, pp. 383-394.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flyvbjerg, Bent and Tim Richardson, 2002, "Planning and Foucault: In Search of the Dark Side of Planning Theory." In Philip Allmendinger and Mark Tewdwr-Jones, eds., ''Planning Futures: New Directions for Planning Theory.'' London and New York: Routledge, pp. 44-62.&lt;/ref&gt;
Looking at each of these models it becomes clear that participation is not only shaped by the public in a given area or by the attitude of the planning organization or planners that work for it. In fact, public participation is largely influenced by how planning is defined, how planning problems are defined, the kinds of knowledge that planners choose to employ and how the planning context is set.&lt;ref name="Lane"/&gt; Though some might argue that is too difficult to involve the public through transactive, advocacy, bargaining and communicative models because [[transportation]] is some ways more technical than other fields, it is important to note that transportation is perhaps unique among planning fields in that its systems depend on the interaction of a number of individuals and organizations.&lt;ref name="Wachs 2004"&gt;Wachs, M. (2004). Reflections on the planning process. In S. Hansen, &amp; G. Guliano (Eds.), The Geography of Urban Transportation (3rd Edition ed., pp. 141–161). The Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==
[[File:ToysRUs.jpg|thumb|[[Blight (urban)|Blight]] may sometimes cause communities to consider redeveloping and urban planning.]]

Prior to 1950, Urban Planning was seldom considered a unique profession in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Hodge, Gerald and Gordon, David ''Planning Canadian Communities'' (fifth edition), Nelson College Indigenous, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  There were, and are, of course, differences from country to country. For example, the UK's [[Royal Town Planning Institute]] was created as a professional organisation in 1914 and given a Royal Charter in 1959. Town planning focused on top-down processes by which the [[urban planner]] created the plans. The planner would know architecture, surveying, or engineering, bringing to the town planning process ideals based on these disciplines. They typically worked for national or local governments. Urban planners were seen as generalists, capable of integrating the work of other disciplines into a coherent plan for whole cities or parts of cities. A good example of this kind of planner was [[Lewis Keeble]] and his standard textbook, ''Principles and Practice of Town and Country Planning'', published in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;Keeble, Lewis B. (1951) ''Principles and Practice of Town and Country Planning'', Estates Gazette, London&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Changes to the planning process ===

[[Strategic Urban Planning]] over past decades have witnessed the metamorphosis of the role of the urban planner in the planning process. More citizens calling for [[democracy|democratic]] planning &amp; development processes have played a huge role in allowing the [[General public|public]] to make important decisions as part of the planning process. [[Community organizers]] and [[social workers]] are now very involved in planning from the grassroots level.&lt;ref&gt;Forester John. "Planning in the Face of Conflict", 1987, {{ISBN|0-415-27173-8}}, Routledge, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term advocacy planning was coined by [[Paul Davidoff]] in his influential 1965 paper, "Advocacy and Pluralism in Planning" which acknowledged the political nature of planning and urged planners to acknowledge that their actions are not value-neutral and encouraged minority and under represented voices to be part of planning decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plannersnetwork.org/publications/2007_spring/angotti.htm |title=Advocacy and Community Planning: Past, Present and Future |publisher=Planners Network |accessdate=2014-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guy Benveniste|Benveniste]] argued that planners had a political role to play and had to bend some truth to power if their plans were to be implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Benveniste|first=Guy|title=Mastering the Politics of Planning|year=1994|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Real estate developer|Developers]] have also played huge roles in development, particularly by planning projects. Many recent developments were results of large and small-scale developers who purchased land, designed the district and constructed the development from scratch. The [[Melbourne Docklands]], for example, was largely an initiative pushed by private developers to redevelop the waterfront into a high-end residential and commercial district.

Recent theories of urban planning, espoused, for example by [[Nikos Salingaros|Salingaros]] see the city as an [[adaptive system]] that grows according to process similar to those of [[Plant morphology|plants]]. They say that urban planning should thus take its cues from such natural processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zeta.math.utsa.edu/~yxk833/lifeandthegeometry.pdf |title="Life and the geometry of the environment", Nikos Salingaros, November 2010 |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such theories also advocate participation by inhabitants in the design of the urban environment, as opposed to simply leaving all development to large-scale construction firms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zeta.math.utsa.edu/~yxk833/P2PURBANISM.pdf "P2P Urbanism", collection of articles by Nikos Salingaros and others]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the process of creating an urban plan or [[urban design]], carrier-infill is one mechanism of spatial organization in which the city's figure and ground components are considered separately.  The urban figure, namely buildings, are represented as total possible building volumes, which are left to be designed by architects in following stages.  The urban ground, namely in-between spaces and open areas, are designed to a higher level of detail.  The carrier-infill approach is defined by an urban design performing as the carrying structure that creates the shape and scale of the spaces, including future building volumes that are then infilled by architects' designs.  The contents of the carrier structure may include street pattern, [[landscape architecture]], open space, waterways, and other [[infrastructure]].  The infill structure may contain [[zoning]], [[building code]]s, quality guidelines, and [[Solar Access]] based upon a [[Solar Access#Solar envelope|solar envelope]].&lt;ref&gt;Capeluto, I. G. and Shaviv, E. On the Use of 'Solar Volume' for Determining the Urban Fabric. Solar Energy Vol. 70, No. 3, pp. 275–280, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Nels O. [http://www.nelsonelson.com/DSA-Nelson-renewable-city-report.pdf Planning the Productive City], 2009, accessed December 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Carrier-Infill urban design is differentiated from complete urban design, such as in the monumental axis of [[Brasília]], in which the urban design and architecture were created together.

In carrier-infill [[urban design]] or urban planning, the negative space of the city, including landscape, open space, and infrastructure is designed in detail.  The positive space, typically building site for future construction, are only represented as unresolved volumes.  The volumes are representative of the total possible building envelope, which can then be infilled by individual architects.
