'''Adolfo Figueroa-Viñas''', Ph.D. is the first Puerto Rican [[astrophysicist]] at the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) and is an expert in solar and space plasma physics at the [[Heliophysics Science Division]]. As a staff scientist his research interests include studying plasma kinetic physics and magnetohydrodynamics of the solar wind, heliosphere, shock waves, MHD and kinetic simulation of plasma instabilities, and turbulent processes associated with space, solar and astrophysical plasmas.&lt;ref name="NASA"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hsd.gsfc.nasa.gov/staff/bios/cs/Adolfo_Figueroa_Vinas.htm|title=Dr. Adolfo Figueroa Viñas|work=NASA.gov|date=October 13, 2006|accessdate=March 23, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090321001444/http://hsd.gsfc.nasa.gov/staff/bios/cs/Adolfo_Figueroa_Vinas.htm| archivedate= 21 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Viñas was born in [[Arecibo, Puerto Rico]]. He studied at the [[University of Puerto Rico]]-R.U.M. where he received a B.S. and M.S. in physics in 1970 and 1972, respectively. He later studied at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), where he received a Ph.D. in physics in 1980. Between 1970 and 1974, he worked as an instructor and assistant professor of physics at the University of Puerto Rico. He joined [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] in 1980, where he has held multiple positions. He currently is a staff scientist in the Geospace Physics Laboratory of the Heliophysics Science Division at Goddard. He has served as Adjunct Visiting Physics Professor at the [[Universidad de Concepcion]] (Chile), at the [[Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro]] (Brazil), and at the [[University of Alcalá|Universidad de Alcalá de Henáres-Madrid]] (Spain).&lt;ref name="NASA"/&gt;

==NASA==
Viñas has pioneered methods for the analysis of plasma particle detectors on board spacecraft. He has conceived and developed a technique for the determination of the fluid moments of velocity distribution function in space plasma measurements from particle detectors. This method is currently being tested for implementation on board any satellite CPU processing unit with particle detectors, to reduce the amount of data required to compute the moments on ground with only a small amount of measurements required via telemetry to unpack the physical quantities on ground. Viñas has also pioneer work to resolve the geometrical properties, propagation velocity, and characteristics of shock waves from simple conservation principles. His work has received national and international recognition (known as the Viñas-Scudder Method) because it is the most accurate and robust method for in-situ shock characteristics determination from space plasma measurements. The Viñas-Scudder method have been implemented into an Interactive Data Language (IDL) visualization tool named SDAT (Shock and Discontinuities Analysis Tool) for distribution to the scientific community and investigators interested in shock physics.&lt;ref name="NASA"/&gt;

==Currently==
Viñas is a staff astrophysicist at the Geospace Physics Laboratory of the [[Heliophysics Science Division]] at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. Viñas continues actively in research and lecturing at various national and international research centers and universities, He is also a post-doctoral mentor and adviser to many national and international young scientists. He is currently an active member of the American Physical Society (APS), the American Geophysical Union (AGU), and a founding member of the Latin American Association for Space Geophysics (ALAGE).&lt;ref name="NASA"/&gt;

'''Aimé Michel''' (12 May 1919 in [[Saint-Vincent-les-Forts]] – 28 December 1992), was a [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] specialist.

== Biography ==
Educated with diplomas in [[psychology]] and [[philosophy]], '''Aimé Michel''' joined the French Radio Broadcasting&lt;ref&gt;[[Radiodiffusion Française]] which was later known as RTF and then ORTF&lt;/ref&gt; in 1944.  (He had successfully passed an entrance exam for studio sound engineers in 1943.)  In 1946, he worked in the research department, making contact with [[Pierre Schaeffer]] (a member of the association "Work and Culture" (''Travail et Culture'') in association with [[Louis Pauwels]]).

In 1958, with the publication of his book about the 1954 wave of UFOs (''Mystérieux Objets Célestes'') in France, Michel devised a theory called [[orthoténie]] with the help of [[Jacques Bergier]] on the corner of a restaurant tablecloth.&lt;ref&gt;''About Flying Saucers - Mysterious Celestial Objects (OMC)'', Aimé Michel, coll. ''Planet Presence'', Planet Ed, 1966, p.134&lt;/ref&gt; Michel posited so-called "alignments": Straight lines which corresponded to large circles traced and centered on the earth. Michel claimed that UFO sightings could be concentrated along these grid lines. He proposed, for example, that there was a line known as “Bavic” (for “[[Bayonne]] - [[Vichy]]”) where, out of nine UFO observations cited in the press on 24 September 1954, six aligned ([[Bayonne]], [[Lencouacq]], [[Tulle]], [[Ussel, Corrèze|Ussel]], [[Gelles]], [[Vichy]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ignaciodarnaude.com/ufologia/Saunders,BAVIC%20Orthotenic%20Line,FSR71V17N4.pdf |title=Is Bavic Remarkable? |last1=Saunders |first1=David R. |website=Ufologia Heterodoxa |publisher=Ignacio Darnaude Rojas-Marcos |format=PDF |accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A member of the editorial board of ''Lights in the Night'' (''Lumières dans la nuit'') since 1969, he wrote numerous articles on UFOs, mysticism, the animal kingdom as well as other topics in various journals.&lt;ref&gt;(''Arts'', ''[[Science et Vie]]'', ''[[Tout Savoir]]'', ''[[Monde et Vie]]'', ''[[Encyclopédie Larousse]]'' « Découvrir les Animaux » in 1971, ''[[Planète (revue)|Planète]]'' - apologist for [[Réalisme fantastique]] including other participants [[Remy Chauvin]], [[Bernard Heuvelmans]], [[Charles Noël Martin]], [http://perso.wanadoo.fr/autre.realite/Annexe1.htm Jean E. Charon] and [[George Langelaan]] -, ''[[Phénomènes Spatiaux]]'', ''Recherches ufologiques'', ''Question de'', ''France Catholique'', ''Ecclésia'', ''[[Flying Saucer Review]]'', ''[[Archeologia]]'' (with an article on his village where he was born), etc.)&lt;/ref&gt; In the journal ''The Life of the Animals'' (''[[La vie des bêtes]]''), during the 1960s, he authored the column  ''The Mysteries of the Animal Kingdom'' (''Les mystères du monde animal'').  From September 26 to October 10, 1964, Aimé Michel also led cultural workshops on the theme of "Life in the Sidereal Universe" (''La vie dans l'Univers sidéral''), taking place under the auspices of the magazine ''Planet'' (''Planète'') at Cefalu in Sicily.

He wrote the television screenplay [[Mycènes Celui qui vient du futur]]: Mycènes, He who comes from the future.

His readers generally appreciate his interest in "anything that is beyond human" and in challenges of the mind. Described as a free spirit by his entourage, Michel had a stated goal to avoid being limited by external constraints.

He was a friend of the controversial Jacques Bergier and Louis Pauwels, and described himself as a "pathological" rebel.

}}'''Angela "Ala" Paredes''' is an Australia-based [[Filipino people|Filipino]] environmental activist, commercial model and writer, who at various times in her career was also a TV host, VJ, advice columnist, and vocalist for [[Pinoy rock|Filipino alternative]] band Hiraya. Since moving to Australia, she has become one of the correspondents covering Australia for the Philippines' [[ABS-CBN News &amp; Current Affairs]].

== Education and early career ==
Paredes graduated from high school in 2000 at the [[School of the Holy Spirit]] (SHSQC), a private, all-girls [[Roman Catholic school]] in [[Quezon City]]. She then moved on to the [[Ateneo de Manila University]], where she received her Bachelor of Arts in Communication in 2004.

She first ventured into modeling in her junior year in college, doing a commercial for a facial wash, and soon endorsing a clothing line.  Initially, Ala was perceived to have the advantage of a familiar family name: she is the second daughter  of singer [[Jim Paredes]] of the [[APO Hiking Society]]. But she soon became popular in her own right, taking up social causes just as her father, well known for his advocacies, did before her.&lt;ref name="faces"&gt;{{Cite news

Model in Globe Telecom's TV Ad "ARE YOU ONE OF US?" early 2000

== "Unconventional Beauty"==
In her first forays as a television personality, doing television ads, she quickly became a recognizable figure,{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} distinguished by her morena (malay brown) complexion and curly hair, a sharp contrast to the traditional look of models at the time. The [[Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism]] took note of her unusual success and said:
:''Model Ala Paredes has curly hair in a country where long, straight hair is considered the epitome of female beauty.... In an industry that prizes fair skin and straight hair, her morena skin color and loose, voluptuous curls are considered unconventional.''&lt;ref name="pcij"&gt;{{cite journal

At around the same time, Paredes began blogging regularly, with her blog soon becoming popular{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} and earning her a reputation as a celebrity blogger&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pep.ph/news/12586/celebrity-bloggers-judge-candy-magazine39s-2007-teen-blog-awards|title=Celebrity bloggers judge Candy Magazine's 2007 Teen Blog Awards|last=Villafuerte|first=Ingrid|date=March 22, 2007|website=Philippine Entertainment Portal|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} – a role she would later use to promote environmental issues.&lt;ref name="greenpeace"/&gt;

==Media work in the Philippines==
Paredes' modeling career soon burgeoned into a television career.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} She continued modelling occasionally but became a regular VJ for [[ABS-CBN]]'s music channel [[Myx]], and then later the host of IslaMusik, a television show on [[TV5 (Philippines)|ABC 5]] featuring a musicians from all over the Philippines. She also often served as a presenter at numerous events.&lt;ref name="faces"/&gt; As a writer, she also became an advice columnist for Pink magazine.&lt;ref name="faces"/&gt;

== Hiraya vocalist ==
In 2005, Paredes became the frontwoman of a [[Pinoy rock]] band [[Hiraya (Band)|Hiraya]] when the original vocalist left. Guitarist Mark Verzo, bassist Marco Cuneta on bass, and drummer Paulo Tomas recruited her to become the replacement vocalist.&lt;ref name="hiraya"&gt;{{cite web

== Move to Australia ==
In 2006, the Paredes family decided to [[Immigration to Australia|migrate to Australia]] – a decision which Jim Paredes explained was related to a desire for greater personal development.  The move generated some controversy when a copyeditor for a prominent Philippine newspaper wrote a headline that said Mr. Paredes, known for his activism, was "giving up on the Philippines."  Both Jim and Ala Paredes protested that this was a miscategorization of their family's motives for moving.  The paper eventually apologized  to the Paredes family for the original, inaccurate headline of the article.&lt;ref name="lirio"&gt;{{Cite news

Upon graduation, Paredes served as the official courtroom sketch artist at the trial of [[Andal Ampatuan Jr.]], the prime suspect in the [[Maguindanao massacre]].&lt;ref name="SC"/&gt; Paredes had gone on vacation in the Philippines to spend the holidays with relatives, when a friend of hers who worked at the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] called about an open position for a courtroom sketch artist at the Ampatuan trial.&lt;ref name="ampatuan"/&gt; [[Courtroom sketch]]es were needed because media coverage at the trial was restricted.&lt;ref name="SC"&gt;{{cite web

Describing the moment, she said that she ''“immediately called my friend back 10 seconds after receiving her message and accepted the offer. We did not talk about the (pay).”'' Noting the importance of the case, she said that ''“At a time when the nation is still grieving, I feel like this is my way of getting involved,”'' and ''“I thought this is my own way of giving public service, especially when media can’t be there.”''&lt;ref name="ampatuan"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2861">'''Antoninus''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: Άντονίνoς; [[Latin]]: Antoninvs) was a member of the [[Late Roman army#Scholae|Household Cavalry]] under Emperor [[Constantius II]], and later a [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] advisor to the [[Shah]] [[Shapur II]]. He played a key role in providing [[Military intelligence|intelligence]] to the Shah, culminating in the [[Looting|sack]] of [[Siege of Amida|Amida]] in 359 AD.

==Life==
[[Ammianus Marcellinus]] is the only source on Antoninus:

:"There was a certain Antoninus, at first a rich merchant, then an accountant in the service of the governor of [[Mesopotamia (Roman province)|Mesopotamia]], and finally one of his body-guard, a man of experience and sagacity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ammianus Marcellinus|title=Res Gestae|year=1982|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=18.5.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Diarbakir P1050574 20080427124233.JPG|thumb|Walls of [[Amida (Mesopotamia)|Amida]], modern [[Diyarbakır]], looking north from the eastern wall.]]
Ammianus then goes on to describe how Antoninus had been mistreated by the imperial authorities of [[Constantius II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ammianus Marcellinus|title=Res Gestae|year=1982|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=18.5.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having grown tired of losing property and wealth to corruption, Antoninus decided to become [[turncoat]]. After contacting the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] authorities, he crossed the [[Tigris]] river and joined Sassanids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ammianus Marcellinus|title=Res Gestae|year=1982|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=18.5.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antoninus later met [[Ursicinus (Roman general)|Ursicinus]] in the turn of events leading to the [[siege of Amida]]. Ammianus (who was present) noted how Antoninus had come to adopt the dress and customs of the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] [[Court (royal)|court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ammianus Marcellinus|title=Res Gestae|year=1982|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=18.8.5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There is nothing else known about Antoninus' life, aside from the high position in the [[Court (royal)|court]] of [[Shapur II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ammianus Marcellinus|title=Res Gestae|year=1982|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=19.9.8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may in part have been because he spoke both [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and [[Latin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ammianus Marcellinus|title=Res Gestae|year=1982|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=18.5.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Ronold was from 1993 until 2008 the only MW of Norway,&lt;ref name=aftbedre&gt;Dalheim, Ulf, ''Adressa.no'' (October 28, 2008).

Prior to his career in wine he has a background in the research of theoretical physics, nuclear physics and mathematical flow models, with a degree in [[engineering]] from the [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]].

A co-author of several books, including ''Verdt å vite om vin'' and ''Italiensk Vin'', he annually publishes the pocket-sized consumer guides ''Norges beste vinkjøp''.&lt;ref&gt;Wessel, Monica, ''Aftenposten.no'' [http://www.aftenposten.no/kul_und/article1181665.ece Lommebøker med vin] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524041737/http://www.aftenposten.no/kul_und/article1181665.ece |date=May 24, 2011 }} {{no_icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Vinforum''===
In 1986 Ronold and Ola Dybvik founded the publication ''Vinforum''.&lt;ref name=aus/&gt;&lt;ref name=vinforum1-2010&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Dybvik| first = Ola | title = Verdens beste vinbutikk | journal = Vinforum | volume = 24 | issue = 1| pages = 18–21| date = January 2010 | language= Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine is annually published by Pedicel AS in five issues, in addition to six subscriber newsletters that are distributed digitally or as paper edition. Typically ca. 70 pages long, the magazine includes features, wine reviews and a column by [[Jancis Robinson]] MW translated into Norwegian.

The motivation behind founding the magazine was, according to a statement in a 2010 ''Vinforum'' editorial by Dybvik, because the Norwegian [[alcohol monopoly]] chain store [[Vinmonopolet]] "failed in its responsibility to its customers by practicing an arrogance with the inherent insolence of dictating the tastes of the Norwegian people. And worst of all, they managed to convince the Norwegian people they were doing a good job."&lt;ref name=vinforum1-2010-leder&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Dybvik| first = Ola | title = Heia Norge! | journal = Vinforum | volume = 24 | issue = 1| pages = 7| date = January 2010 | language= Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time Vinmonopolet had an [[Italian wine]] selection which totalled 14 labels (including reds, whites and [[Sparkling wine|sparkling]]). This situation has since improved significantly over two decades, with Dybvik declaring in 2010, "we are living in paradise".&lt;ref name=vinforum1-2010/&gt;

In 2003 Ronold and ''Vinforum'' challenged the Norwegian ban on all advertisement of alcoholic drink, after the equivalent ban in Sweden had become overturned following actions by the magazine ''Gourmet'' and it had been demonstrated to oppose [[European Union|EU]] free trade rules. In June 2009 Norwegian supreme court ruled against Ronold and ''Vinforum'', leaving the Norwegian alcoholic advertisement ban intact.&lt;ref&gt;Vermes, Thomas, abcnyheter.no (November 11, 2008).

[http://www.adressa.no/kultur/vin/article1343864.ece Vinforum tapte i Høyesterett] {{no_icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Ola Dybvig sold his 50% shares of ''Vinforum'' publisher Pedicel AS to the publishing house Forlagshuset Vigmostad og Bjørke, a previous publication collaborator, with Arno Vigmostad and Arnstein Bjørke as replacement partners to Arne Ronold.&lt;ref&gt;Bø, Merete, ''DN.no'' (September 27, 2012).

'''Bruce Raymond Voeller''' (May 12, 1934 &amp;ndash; February 13, 1994) was a [[biologist]] and researcher, primarily in the field of [[AIDS]] and [[gay rights]] activist.

==Biography==
Voeller was born in [[Minneapolis]] and raised in [[Oregon]].&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/24/obituaries/dr-bruce-voeller-is-dead-at-59-helped-lead-fight-against-aids.html |title=Dr. Bruce Voeller Is Dead at 59; Helped Lead Fight Against AIDS |first=Wolfgang |last=Saxon |date=1994-02-24 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2008-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was at school, he was assured by a school counselor that he was not homosexual, even though he had felt such feelings very early on.&lt;ref name=stewart&gt;{{cite book |title=Gay and Lesbian Issues |first=Chuck |last=Stewart |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2003 |isbn=1-85109-372-9 |pages=168–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voeller graduated with a bachelor's degree from [[Reed College]] in 1956.&lt;ref name=stewart /&gt; He was awarded a five-year fellowship to the [[Rockefeller University|Rockefeller Institute]],&lt;ref name=nytimes /&gt; and earned a [[Ph.D.]] in biology in 1961.&lt;ref name=stewart /&gt; He became an associate professor at the Institute in 1966. He wrote four books while there, as well as editing others' work, and writing numerous papers and articles. He married Kytja Scott Voeller,&lt;ref name=nytimes /&gt; whom he met at graduate school, and they had three children.&lt;ref name=stewart /&gt;

He [[Coming out|came out]] at the age of 29,&lt;ref name=nytimes /&gt; and divorced from his wife in 1971. After becoming president of the New York [[Gay Activists Alliance]], he decided it was not wide enough in its coverage. Therefore, with some friends, he founded the  [[National Gay and Lesbian Task Force|National Gay Task Force]] in October 1973, and was its director until 1978. The Task Force established affiliations with more than 2000 gay groups, and by 1978 had over 10,000 members.&lt;ref name=stewart /&gt; In 1977, the National Gay Task Force (now the [[National LGBTQ Task Force]]) successfully initiated the first-ever meeting between the White House and more than a dozen gay and lesbian leaders. President Jimmy Carter’s assistant, Midge Costanza, met with Task Force co-chairs and board members as well as representatives of gay and lesbian organizations for a briefing on critical policy issues affecting this constituency. The meeting marked the first time openly gay and lesbian leaders were welcomed at the White House and the first official discussion of gay and lesbian rights in the White House.  Attendees at the White House meeting included: [[Frank Kameny]], Myra Keddell, Charles Brydon, Ray Hartman, Betty Powell, William Kelley,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glhalloffame.org/index.pl?item=9&amp;todo=view_item|title=William B. Kelley|accessdate=2015-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Troy Perry]], [[Jean O'Leary]], [[Elaine Noble]], George Raya and Pokey Anderson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.thetaskforce.org/press/releases/prAPC_032207 |title=Today marks 30th anniversary of first-ever meeting between White House and gay leaders |publisher=TaskForce |date=2007-03-26 |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103014614/http://www.thetaskforce.org/press/releases/prAPC_032207 |archivedate=2013-11-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also founded the Mariposa Foundation, which specializes in sex research, and sexually transmitted diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bnl.gov/bera/activities/globe/bruce_voeller.htm |title=Bruce Voeller |publisher=bnl.gov |accessdate=2008-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the 1980s, [[AIDS]] was known by various names, including GRIDD (Gay Related Immune Defense Disorder). Because this term was inaccurate, Voeller coined the term ''acquired immune deficiency syndrome''.&lt;ref name=stewart /&gt; His partner was Richard Lucik, who was also his associate at Mariposa. Voeller died in 1994 of an AIDS related illness in [[California]], at the age of 59.&lt;ref name=nytimes /&gt;

[[File:Curonian king woman.jpg|thumb|Curonian king woman from Turlava parish in Kuldīga region wearing traditional clothing (1895)]]
'''Curonian Kings''' ({{lang-de|Kurische Könige}}; {{lang-lv|kuršu ķoniņi}}) are a [[Latvian people|Latvian]] cultural group, originally lesser vassals and free farmers that lived in seven villages between [[Kuldīga|Goldingen (Kuldīga)]] and [[Aizpute|Hasenpoth (Aizpute)]] in [[Courland]].

It is unclear how Curonian Kings gained their status, however a popular assumption is that their ancestors were [[Curonians|Curonian]] [[nobility]] prior to conquest by [[Livonian Order]]. They were first mentioned in a document of 1320 and lived in the villages of [[Ķoniņciems]], [[Pliķu ciems]], [[Kalējciems]], [[Ziemeļciems]], [[Viesalgciems]], [[Sausgaļciems]], and [[Dragūnciems]] (now in [[Kuldīga municipality]]). All of them possessed independent farms (did not belong to any lord), but they were not allowed to own their own serfs. They had only one landlord [[komtur]] of Kuldīga and they were related to him only by military service in case of war. Curonians usually served as a [[light cavalry]] in the Livonian Order army. Sources mentions that Curonian Kings fought in the [[Livonian War]] against invading Russians, as Johann Renner's chronicle reports:

::''The Russians protected themselves boldly, and they knocked out a Curonian cadet (who, although only a peasant, is called by them the Curonian king) from his horse.

::—Johann Renner, Lievländische Historien, 1556–1561, C. 124v''

Curonian Kings also was allowed to practice some aspects of paganism during period of [[Livonian Confederation]]. Despite formal Christianisation after Livonian Crusade Curonian Kings owned a sacred forest where nobody was allowed to hunt or walk. It was used as a place of worship and for cremation of the dead. Hunt was allowed only once a year before Christmas but part of the game must be used as offering. Most likely those were Curonian Kings which was described by [[Guillebert de Lannoy]] in 1413 when he traveled from Konigsberg to Novgorod. He writes that there is a sect of curonians who still burns their dead in a sacred groves with garments and weapons with them. Part of this forest has survived until 21st century and local people still maintains it with great respect.

In 1504 master of the Livonian order [[Walter von Plettenberg]] awarded Curonian King Andrejs Peniķis, commander of curonian light cavalry for his loyal service during livonian wars with [[Muscovite Russia]].

It is known that in the 17th century Curonian Kings had their own [[coat of arms|coats of arms]]. In the [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia]] they gradually lost their privileges, but they were still counted as separate class. They were not recognized landlords but maintained middle position between landlords and peasants. However, in 18th century they were likened to [[serfs]], although with smaller [[socage]] duties.

Their status was again recognized in 19th century, although they were not recognized as part of local nobility. In 1860 there were 833 Curonian kings living in [[Courland Governorate]]. While the Curonian tribe had long been assimilated by the Latvians, the Curonian Kings preserved a separate identity and traditions. Differences mandated by traditional rights disappeared as legal basis for them was removed in 1920s after Latvia became independent.

== Notable Curonian Kings ==
* [[Mārtiņš Peniķis]] (1874–1964) – Latvian general, commander in chief of Latvian Army from 1928 to 1934.
* [[Ivars Tontegode]] (1983–) – Latvian film director.
* [[Jānis Peniķis]] (1933–) – Latvian political scientist.

Criss portrayed [[Blaine Anderson]], on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] television series ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fox.com/glee/bios/darren-criss|title=FOX Broadcasting Company – Glee – Bios|publisher=Fox.com|accessdate=September 27, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924153753/http://www.fox.com/glee/bios/darren-criss/|archivedate=September 24, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his first appearance in [[Glee (season 2)|season two]] in the episode "[[Never Been Kissed (Glee)|Never Been Kissed]]", which aired on November 9, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-31749_162-20017760-10391698.html|title= Darren Criss Joins "Glee" Cast|author=Derschowitz, Jessica|work=CBSnews.com|date=September 27, 2010|accessdate=October 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blaine attended Dalton Academy and was lead singer of its glee club, [[The Dalton Academy Warblers]]. Blaine initially served as a friend and mentor for Kurt, the bullied gay member of the Warblers' rival glee club, New Directions. Chemistry between the two characters, combined with fan support for the potential couple, led series co-creator [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]] to pair them romantically onscreen. At the beginning of the [[Glee (season 3)|third season]], Blaine transfers to McKinley High and joins New Directions; concurrently, Criss was promoted from recurring guest star to the show's main cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2011/09/glee-recap-back-to-school-and-basics-in-the-season-3-premiere.html|title={{-'}}Glee' recap: Back to school (and basics) in the Season 3 premiere|first=Amy|last=Reiter|work=Los Angeles Times|date=September 21, 2011|accessdate=September 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the subsequent seasons, Blaine goes off to college and later returns to Dalton to become the vocal director of the Warblers. In the final season, he marries his long-time love, Kurt. Discussing public response to his character, Criss stated that he particularly enjoyed comments from "people from parts of the world who are maybe not as exposed to certain ideologies", but had reconsidered their stance on relationships and human rights as a result of the Blaine and Kurt storyline. He called this response "phenomenal" and said, "I was a straight kid growing up in a very gay community and it's something that I've had to watch so many friends have to struggle with and have no place to go to identify in kind of a grander media culture. To be a small piece of that machine is incredibly wonderful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afterelton.com/people/2011/01/darren-criss-glee-teenage-dream?page=0%2C1|title=Interview: Darren Criss Humbly Calls Himself "Last Grain of Sand"|last=Jensen|first=Michael|date=January 18, 2011|work=[[AfterEllen.com and AfterElton.com|AfterElton.com]]|publisher=[[Logo (TV channel)|Logo]]|accessdate=April 15, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110123164022/http://www.afterelton.com/people/2011/01/darren-criss-glee-teenage-dream?page=0%2C1|archivedate=January 23, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edward Askew (E.A.) Sothern.jpg|thumb|Cabinet card of E. A. Sothern, c. 1870s]]
'''Edward Askew Sothern''' (1 April 1826 – 20 January 1881) was an English actor known for his comic roles in Britain and America, particularly [[Lord Dundreary]] in ''[[Our American Cousin]]''.

== Life and career ==

=== Early years ===
Sothern was born in [[Liverpool]], the son of a merchant. He began studying medicine, and his parents hoped that he would become a minister,&lt;ref name=Timesobit&gt;''[[The Times]]'' obituary, 22 January 1881, p. 9, col. F&lt;/ref&gt; but he decided against pursuing those professions. He worked as a clerk in the late 1840s and married Frances Emily "Fannie" Stewart (d. 1882). He began acting as an amateur in 1848 under the stage name of Douglas Stewart.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Holder, Heidi J. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26040 "Sothern, Edward Askew (1826–1881)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004. Retrieved 7 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1849 he appeared in his first professional engagement at [[Saint Helier]] in [[Jersey]], as Claude Melnotte in [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton|Bulwer Lytton]]'s ''[[The Lady of Lyons]]''. In the early 1850s, he played in various English companies without particular success in [[Portsmouth]], [[Wolverhampton]] and [[Birmingham]].

Sothern travelled to America in 1852, first playing Dr. Pangloss in ''[[The Heir at Law]]'' in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], with John Lacy's company at the [[National Theatre, Boston (1836)|National Theatre]].&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt; He then played at the [[Howard Athenaeum]] in Boston and at [[Barnum's American Museum]] in New York.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; In 1854, he joined the company at [[Wallack's Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;"Edward Askew Sothern" at the ''American Theater Guide''&lt;/ref&gt; In the early part of his career, Sothern's wife often performed with him. By 1856, he had begun using his own name, Sothern, on stage.&lt;ref&gt;Odell, Vol. VI, p. 359&lt;/ref&gt; He had become associated with [[Laura Keene]]'s company in New York by 1856.&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pfaff&gt;Whitley, Edward. [http://digital.lib.lehigh.edu/pfaffs/p132/ "Sothern, Edward Askew (Douglas Stewart)"], The Vault at Pfaff's, Lehigh University's digital library&lt;/ref&gt; He finally gained attention at [[Wallack's Theatre]] in New York starring as Armand in ''Camille''. The critic [[Clement Scott]] noted that while Sothern was "as handsome a man as ever stood on the stage", he was not naturally suited to romantic roles.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, vol. 1, p. 392&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Our American Cousin'' ===
[[File:Lord Dundreary.jpg|thumb|right|Sothern as [[Lord Dundreary]]]]
As a result of his success in ''Camille'', Sothern was given a part in [[Tom Taylor]]'s ''[[Our American Cousin]]'' at [[Laura Keene]]'s Theatre. This piece would later become famous as the play that [[Abraham Lincoln]] was watching when he was assassinated. Sothern's role was [[Lord Dundreary]], a caricature of a brainless English nobleman. At first, he was reluctant to accept the role; it was so small and unimportant that he felt it beneath him and feared it might damage his reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Odell, Vol. VII, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pemberton, p. 318&lt;/ref&gt; He mentioned his qualms to his friend, [[Joseph Jefferson]], who had been cast in the leading role of Asa Trenchard in the play. Jefferson supposedly responded with the famous line: "There are no small parts, only small actors."&lt;ref&gt;Havard, Bernard. ''Walnut Street Theatre'', p. 40, Charleston, SC: Arcadia Publishing, 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-7385-5770-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 October 1858, ''Our American Cousin'' premiered in New York. After a couple of unhappy weeks in the small role, Sothern began portraying the role as a lisping, skipping, eccentric, weak-minded fop prone to nonsensical references to sayings of his "bwother" Sam.&lt;ref&gt;Pemberton, p. 319&lt;/ref&gt; His ad-libs were a sensation, earning good notices for his physical comedy and spawning much imitation and merry mockery on both sides of the Atlantic. His exaggerated, droopy side-whiskers became known as "Dundrearys". Sothern gradually expanded the role, adding gags and business until it became the central figure of the play. The most famous scene involved Dundreary reading a letter from his even sillier brother. The play ran for 150 nights, which was very successful for a New York run at the time.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Sothern made his London debut in the role when the play ran for 496 performances at the [[Haymarket Theatre]] in 1861, earning rave reviews.&lt;ref&gt;"Edward Askew Sothern", ''Virtual American Biographies'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|The Athenaeum]]'' wrote, "it is certainly the funniest thing in the world... a vile caricature of a vain nobleman, intensely ignorant, and extremely indolent".&lt;ref&gt;''The Athenaeum'', 16 November 1861&lt;/ref&gt;

Dundreary became a popular recurring character, and Sothern successfully revived the play many times, making Dundreary by far his most famous role. A number of spin-off works were also created, including Charles Gayler's sequel, ''Our American Cousin at Home, or, Lord Dundreary Abroad'' (Buffalo, New York, 1860,&lt;ref&gt;''Buffalo Daily Courier'', 1 November 1860&lt;/ref&gt; and then New York City, 1861&lt;ref&gt;Brown, T. Allston (1903). ''A History of the New York Stage, Volume I'', New York: Dodd, Mead, p. 450&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[H. J. Byron]]'s ''Dundreary Married and Done For''.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;  Sothern wrote his own play, ''Suspense'', produced for Keene's 1860-61 season.&lt;ref name=Pfaff/&gt; He won wide popularity from his interpretation of Sam Slingsby in [[John Oxenford]]'s ''Brother Sam'' (1862; revived in 1865), a play about Dundreary's brother.

=== 1860s and 1870s ===
In 1864, Sothern created the title role in [[Thomas William Robertson|Tom Robertson]]'s ''[[David Garrick (play)|David Garrick]]'' at the Haymarket Theatre. The play was a great success. ''[[The Times]]'' praised Sothern's acting in the Act II scene where Sothern depicted "the most extravagant form of drunkenness... perpetually brought into contact with the real agony of mind which is now on the point of casting aside the mask of debauchery".&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 6 May 1864&lt;/ref&gt; He also appeared in Robertson's ''Home'' and later claimed to have written some of the best scenes in each work (a claim that was disputed by Robertson).&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Other plays written for the now-famous Sothern were ''The Woman in Mauve'', by Watts Phillips; ''The Favourite of Fortune'' and ''A Hero of Romance'' by [[John Westland Marston|Westland Marston]]; ''A Lesson for Life'' by [[Tom Taylor]]; and ''An English Gentleman'' by [[H. J. Byron]] (1871) at the Haymarket.&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 2 May 1871, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Sothern continued to act mostly in London until 1876, but also toured extensively in the British provinces, North America and Europe.

Sothern became popular with Robertson's crowd, including with the Haymarket's manager, [[John Baldwin Buckstone]], actor [[J. L. Toole]], and dramatists Byron and [[W. S. Gilbert]], who later wrote three plays for him, ''[[Dan'l Druce, Blacksmith]]'' (1876),&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 119–20; 123–24&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Ne'er-do-Weel]]'' (1878),&lt;ref&gt;[http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/gilbert/plays/neerdowell/index.html Information about ''The Ne'er do Weel'' at the G&amp;S Archive], accessed 23 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 124 and 134–35&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Foggerty's Fairy]]'' (1881).&lt;ref name=Foggerty&gt;[http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/gilbert/plays/foggerty/failure.html "Foggerty's Failure: A few background notes on ''Foggerty’s Fairy''"], The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 2007, accessed 23 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  He was known as a sportsman and bon vivant and became famous for his magic tricks, conversation and, especially, his [[practical jokes]] (he was born on [[April fool's day]]).  Sothern and his friends demanded that clerks sell them goods not carried by the store in question, staged mock arguments on public omnibuses, ran fake advertisements in newspapers, paid street urchins to annoy passers-by and so forth.  At one restaurant, Toole and Sothern removed the silver and hid under the table.  When the unfortunate waiter found the dining room empty and the silver gone, he ran to report the theft.  By the time he returned, Toole and Sothern had re-set the table as if nothing had happened.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

Sothern left England to tour in America in early 1876 and wrote to Gilbert to be ready with a play by October that would feature him in a serious role.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 119–20&lt;/ref&gt;  This play eventually became ''Dan'l Druce''.  However, Sothern produced but did not star in the play.  Gilbert soon wrote another play for Sothern, this time a comedy, ''The Ne'er-do-Weel''.  Sothern was not pleased with the work, and Gilbert offered to take it back.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 123–24 and 134–35&lt;/ref&gt;  Although it was eventually produced, Sothern did not appear in it.&lt;ref name=Foggerty/&gt;  Sothern had already paid Gilbert for the play, and Gilbert was unable immediately to pay him back.  After various arrangements between Gilbert and Sothern involving American productions of another Gilbert play, ''[[Engaged (play)|Engaged]]'' (1877), Gilbert finally promised, in 1878, to write a new play for Sothern.  This was to be ''Foggerty's Fairy''.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 134–35 and 166&lt;/ref&gt;

Sothern's biographer T. Edgar Pemberton noted that one role he regretted not playing was Cheviot in ''Engaged''.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;  Sothern continued to tour and perform Dundreary and other works.  In October 1877 at the Academy of Music in New York, he played the title role in ''[[Othello]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, Brander and Hutton, Laurence. [https://archive.org/details/lifeandartofedwi00mattrich ''The Life and art of Edwin Booth and his contemporaries''] (1906), p. 118, Boston: L. C. Page&lt;/ref&gt;

Sothern's next great role was the title role, Fitzaltamont, in a hit revival of Byron's ''The Crushed Tragedian'' (1878, originally named ''The Prompter's Box'') at the Haymarket.  ''The Era'' admired "the sepulchral tones, the glaring eyeballs, the long hair, the wonderful 'stage walk', the melodramatic attitudes" of his portrayal.&lt;ref&gt;''The Era'', 19 May 1878&lt;/ref&gt;  He next appeared in ''The Hornet's Nest'' by Byron at the Haymarket.  ''The Crushed Tragedian'' was not a great success in London, but it became a hit in New York.  ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' raved, "With what elaboration of detail does the actor embody his conception! There is not a gesture, not an intonation, not a movement, but seems to illustrate the character portrayed. He strides across the stage and it is as though he were wading through a sea of gore; he mutters to himself ‘Ha! ha!’ and you know that he is cursing fate with a bitterness loud and deep. always and in all things poor Altamont is exquisitely, indescribably ludicrous."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Pemberton, pp. 91–92&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 1879, he was still at the Haymarket, appearing in [[Lord Lytton]]'s play ''Money'' as Sir Frederick Blount.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 10 April 1879, p. 8, col. B&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Last years and family ===
In the autumn of 1879, after a long summer fishing trip, Sothern was on another [[United States|American]] tour.  ''The Era'' wrote in October 1879 that "It is proposed, during Mr Sothern's [American] engagement, to bring out revivals of ''The Crushed Tragedian'', ''Dundreary'', and ''David Garrick'', the new comedy by Mr Gilbert being reserved for the spring engagement."&lt;ref&gt;''The Era'', Drama in America column, 12 October 1879&lt;/ref&gt;  On 29 February 1880 ''The Era'' reported: "Mr Sothern says that, although his new comedy, by Mr Gilbert, has cost him 3,000 [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]], he would not take 6,000 guineas for it now.  It is a piece of the wildest absurdity ever perpetrated, and all the parts are immense."&lt;ref&gt;''The Era'', 29 February 1880&lt;/ref&gt;  The same issue of ''The Era'' states that definite plans had been made for Sothern to appear at the [[Gaiety Theatre, London]] in ''[[Foggerty's Fairy]]'', as the new play was now called, in October 1880, after the end of his American tour.  Sothern had been ill for much of the time since the fall, although he fulfilled his performing commitments.&lt;ref name=Foggerty/&gt;  Sothern returned to [[England]] for a six-week holiday in June 1880, still planning to produce ''Fogerty's Fairy'' in New York.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;  After one illness and a short European tour, Sothern fell seriously ill in the fall, and his health declined until he died in January 1881, never having performed Gilbert's play.

[[File:Edward Askew Sothern gravestone.JPG|thumb|Sothern's grave in Southampton Old Cemetery]]
Sothern died at his home in Cavendish Square, London, at the age of 54 and is buried in [[Southampton Old Cemetery]], Southampton.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tripadvisor.com/Travel-g186299-d216086/Southampton:United-Kingdom:The.Old.Cemetery.html Information about Sothern's burial site]&lt;/ref&gt;  Sothern was such a notorious practical joker that many of his friends missed his funeral, thinking it was a joke.  His sister, Mary Cowan, was the principal beneficiary of his last will, signed shortly before his death.  A previous will had given most of the estate to his widow and children.  Sothern's widow contested the will but lost, and it took Cowan until 31 May 1881 to obtain probate.&lt;ref name=Foggerty/&gt;  Gilbert suggested that she "underlet" ''Foggerty's Fairy'' to him, and he eventually had it produced.  Later, she wrote to him: "Allow me to say that of all the people with whom I have had any dealings in reference to money since my Brother's death, you have treated me with the greatest kindness &amp; fairness &amp; I feel grateful to you for sparing me any trouble or anxiety."&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;

Sothern and his wife had four children, all of whom became actors: Lytton Edward (1851–1887), [[Edward Hugh Sothern|Edward Hugh (E. H.)]], George Evelyn Augustus T. (b. 1870; who used the stage name Sam Sothern) and Eva Mary.  E. H. Sothern became prominent on the American stage.  Sothern's house in [[Kensington]], London was a resort for people of fashion, and he was as much a favourite in America as in the United Kingdom.

== Famous hoax ==
Sothern's passion for practical joking amounted almost to a mania. He would often falsely announce the death of a friend or send people on fool's errands.&lt;ref&gt;Pemberton, Chapter IV, "Sothern in High Spirits", pp. 199 ''et seq.''&lt;/ref&gt; Among his most elaborate practical jokes was the following.  When the husband of actress [[Adelaide Neilson]], Philip Henry Lee, visited New York in the mid-19th century, he had been warned about the wild, bohemian behaviour of American authors, but expressed his doubt as to the veracity of the stories. Sothern assured him it was true and arranged a private dinner for Lee with twelve "writers and critics", who were really actors.  During the dinner, a quarrel arose over literary matters, culminating in a fight breaking out. The men, apparently drunk, brandished an axe, knives and revolvers. The room was filled with shouts, shots and struggle. Someone thrust a knife into Lee's hand, saying, "Defend yourself! This is butchery, sheer butchery!" Sothern advised him to "Keep cool, and don't get shot", before the joke was exposed.&lt;ref&gt;Pemberton, pp. 223–226&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elizabeth O'Neill''' (1791 – 29 October 1872), also '''Eliza''', was an Irish actress, later [[baronet]]ess.

==Biography==
Born in [[Drogheda]], she was the daughter of an actor and stage manager.&lt;ref name=garr/&gt;  Her first appearance on the stage was made at the [[Crow Street Theatre]] in 1811 as the Widow Cheerly in [[Andrew Cherry]]'s ''The Soldier's Daughter'', and after several years in Ireland she came to London and made an immediate success as [[Juliet Capulet|Juliet]] at [[Covent Garden]] in 1814.  For five years she was the favorite of London town in comedy as well as tragedy, but in the latter she particularly excelled, being frequently compared, not to her disadvantage, with the great [[Sarah Siddons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=O'Neill, Eliza}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1819 she married [[William Wrixon Becher]], an Irish M.P., who was to be created a [[Wrixon-Becher baronets|baronet]] in 1831. After her marriage, she never returned to the stage.&lt;ref name=garr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://garrick.ssl.co.uk/names/SON002|title=CollectionsOnline - Name|website=Garrick.ssl.co.uk|accessdate=28 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://yipp.yale.edu/bio/bibliography/smith-fidelia-ann-hoscott-1827-1908 Fidelia Ann Hoscott Smith Fielding] (1827–1908), also known as '''''Dji'ts Bud dnaca''''' ("Flying Bird"), was the daughter of Bartholomew Valentine Smith (c. 1811–1843) and Sarah A. Wyyougs (1804–1868), and granddaughter of Martha Shantup Uncas (1761–1859).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Biographical information for Smith, Fidelia Ann Hoscott, 1827–1908. Yale Indian Papers Project, Yale University (2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

She married Mohegan mariner William H. Fielding (1811–1843), and they lived in one of the last "tribe houses," a reservation-era log cabin dwelling. She was known to be an independent-minded woman who was well-versed in tribal traditions, and who continued to speak the traditional [[Mohegan-Pequot language|Mohegan Pequot]] language during her elder years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mohegan.nsn.us/heritage/our-history/fidelia-fielding Fidelia Fielding (1827-1908)]. Our History, The Mohegan Tribe, Uncasville, Connecticut (2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mohegan Language==
Fielding insisted upon retaining the everyday use of the Mohegan language during an era when most New England Native peoples were becoming increasingly fluent in English. Her maternal grandmother Martha Uncas spoke it with family members, and other Mohegan people continued to speak and understand some of the language, but by 1900, few were as fluent as Fidelia and her sister. As an adult, Fielding kept four diaries in the language, which later became vital sources for reconstructing the syntax of [[Mohegan-Pequot language|Mohegan Pequot]] and related [[Algonquian languages]].

Fielding was regarded as a ''nanu'' (respected elder woman) and mentor to [[Gladys Tantaquidgeon]], a traditional Mohegan woman who also studied [[anthropology]] at the University of Pennsylvania and served as a research assistant to [[Frank Speck]]. Tantaquidgeon conducted field work and service work for a variety of Native communities and agencies before coming home to [[Uncasville, Connecticut|Uncasville]]. In Uncasville, Gladys and her family founded the Tantaquidgeon Indian Museum, and she became a respected elder herself, working on material and cultural preservation.&lt;ref name="fawcett"&gt;Fawcett, Melissa Jayne. ''Medicine Trail: The Life and Lessons of Gladys Tantaquidgeon''&lt;/ref&gt;

Many modern sources suggest that anthropologist [[Frank G. Speck]], as a child, lived with Fidelia Fielding, but there is no evidence to support that in any Mohegan tribal records or oral memories. Speck recalled, in his own publications and correspondence, that he first met Fielding around 1900, when he was an anthropology student at [[Columbia University]]. Speck was in the midst of a camping trip to Fort Shantok, Connecticut, when he met up with several Mohegan young men---Burrill Tantaquidgeon, Jerome Roscoe Skeesucks, and Edwin Fowler---who introduced him to Fielding. This encounter sparked a lifelong friendship with the Tantaquidgeon family. Speck interviewed Fielding, recording notes on the Mohegan language that he shared with his professor, John Dyneley Prince, who encouraged further research. Fielding eventually allowed Speck to view her personal daybooks (also called diaries) in which she recorded brief observations on the weather and local events, so that he could understand and accurately record the written version of the Mohegan language.

This material that Speck collected from Fielding inspired four publications in 1903 alone: “The Remnants of our Eastern Indian Tribes”  in The American Inventor, Vol. 10, pp.&amp;nbsp;266–268; “A Mohegan-Pequot Witchcraft Tale” in Journal of American Folklore, Vol. 16, pp.&amp;nbsp;104–107; “The Last of the Mohegans” in The Papoose Vol. 1, No. 4, pp.&amp;nbsp;2–5; and “Mohegan Traditions of ‘Muhkeahweesug,’ the Little Men” in The Papoose No . 7, pp.&amp;nbsp;11–14. Speck also co-authored a 1904 article with J. Dyneley Prince, “The Modem Pequots and their Language” in American Anthropologist, n. s., Vol. V pp.&amp;nbsp;193–212.

In 1908, after Fielding's death, her relative John Cooper gave her diaries to Frank Speck for safekeeping. Speck later deposited them in George Gustav Heye's Heye Foundation/Museum of the American Indian in New York City. These documents were later relocated, as part of the Huntington collection, to the [http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/collections/fielding.html Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections at Cornell University], where they are archived today.

==Legacy and honors==
Fidelia Hoscott Fielding died in 1908, and was buried at the Ancient Burial Grounds of the Mohegans at [[Fort Shantok State Park]] in [[Montville, Connecticut]]. A memorial marker was placed there to honor her, at a ceremony with an estimated 1,000 people in attendance on May 24, 1936.&lt;ref name=Inductees /&gt;

Credited with being an instrumental influence in recording and preserving the language, in 1994 she was posthumously inducted into the [[Connecticut Women's Hall of Fame]] under the category ''Education &amp; Preservation''.&lt;ref name=Inductees&gt;{{cite web|title=Fidelia Hoscott Fielding|url=http://www.cwhf.org/inductees/education-preservation/fidelia-hoscott-fielding/|work=Inductees|publisher=Connecticut Women's Hall of Fame|accessdate=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fielding is one of only three American Indians who have been inducted into the [[Connecticut Women's Hall of Fame]]. Years later, Gladys Tantaquidgeon, a Mohegan woman trained by Fielding who similarly insisted on preserving traditional ways, was also inducted into the Hall of Fame.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

During Fielding's lifetime, parents were reluctant to use or teach the Mohegan language to their children, for fear of prejudice or reprisals from the English speakers around them. In the present day, linguists from the [http://moheganlanguage.com/ Mohegan Language Project], including Fidelia Fielding's relative [[Stephanie Fielding]], have been carefully working with materials compiled and archived by Fielding and Speck in order to reconstruct and reanimate Mohegan-Pequot as a living language for new generations.&lt;ref name=Inductees /&gt;

'''George I. Eacker''' ({{circa}} 1774 – January 4, 1804)&lt;ref name=Findagrave/&gt; was a New York lawyer. He fatally shot [[Philip Hamilton]], the oldest son of [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton]], in a [[duel]] on November 23, 1801, in  [[Weehawken]], New Jersey.&lt;ref name=PBS/&gt;&lt;ref name=WashPost/&gt;

== Biography ==
=== Early life and education ===
Eacker was born in [[Palatine, New York]].&lt;ref name=Winfield203/&gt; He was the son of Jacob Eacker, who fought in the [[American Revolution]] and served as a county judge and [[New York State Assembly]]man, and Anna Margaret Finck, daughter of Andreas Finck.&lt;ref name=Simms1882/&gt;&lt;ref name=Frothingham1892/&gt; He had one younger brother, Jacob I., and four sisters.&lt;ref name=Frothingham1892/&gt;

He attended a preparatory school in [[Schenectady, New York]],&lt;ref name=Frothingham1892/&gt; and graduated from [[Columbia College (New York)|Columbia College]] in 1793.&lt;ref name=Columbia1888/&gt; He then studied law under [[Henry Brockholst Livingston]], a future [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States]].

=== Career ===
Eacker was admitted to the New York bar at age 21. He soon built his practice in [[Manhattan]] into a lucrative business, allowing him to take a house on [[Wall Street]] and employ a married couple as his valet and housekeeper.&lt;ref name=Simms1882/&gt; He gained popularity in New York City's well-to-do social circles as a lawyer, [[Freemason]], cavalry captain, and fire brigade inspector.&lt;ref name=Simms1882/&gt;

For an unknown offense in 1798, which historian [[Eric Henry Monkkonen|Eric Monkkonen]] interprets as an earlier duel or conflict, Eacker appeared in court and paid a recognizance, likely as a bond for good behavior.&lt;ref name=Monkkonen2001/&gt;

In 1801, Eacker was appointed as a master in the [[New York Court of Chancery]], then the highest court in the state.&lt;ref name=Frothingham1892/&gt;

Eacker was selected in 1801 to deliver the Fourth of July oration at an [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] celebration held in New York City by a brigade of the New York State Militia, the [[Tammany Society]], and two of the city's labor organizations, the [[General Society of Mechanics and Tradesmen of the City of New York|Mechanics' Society]] and Coopers' Society.&lt;ref name=Frothingham1892/&gt;&lt;ref name=Eacker1801/&gt; The Tammany Society, better known as [[Tammany Hall]], was a [[Democratic-Republican party]] political organization that [[Aaron Burr]] had built into a [[political machine]].&lt;ref name=Golway2014/&gt; In politics, Eacker was known to be aligned with Burr.&lt;ref name=Winfield203/&gt;

According to a supporter, the speech that Eacker delivered was commended by "nearly everybody," except for partisans who were "blinded{{nbsp}}... to every virtue" by "party spirit, which at that time was very bitter".&lt;ref name=Winfield203/&gt; Some accounts questioned whether the speech was critical of [[Alexander Hamilton]], as it was later characterized; according to a 19th century historian who relied on Eacker's younger brother as a source, the speech was entirely patriotic and did not name or allude to Hamilton.&lt;ref name=Simms1882/&gt;

On November 20, 1801, a Friday night,&lt;ref name=Winfield203/&gt; Eacker attended a play at the [[Park Theatre (Manhattan)|Park Theatre]] with his fiancée Harriet Livingston, a daughter of [[Walter Livingston]] and Cornelia Schuyler.&lt;ref name=Simms1882/&gt; [[Philip Hamilton]] (the eldest son of Alexander Hamilton) and [[Stephen Price (theatre manager)|Stephen Price]]&lt;ref name=Rush1801/&gt; approached or entered Eacker's [[Box (theatre)|box]] together and loudly ridiculed him.&lt;ref name=Simms1882/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dawson/&gt; Eacker called them "damned rascals", and in response to that insult, as was not uncommon at the time, they each challenged Eacker to a duel.&lt;ref name=PBS/&gt;

Price faced the 27-year-old Eacker in a duel in [[Weehawken, New Jersey]] on November 22. Four shots were exchanged, but neither party was injured.&lt;ref name=Winfield203/&gt;

At the same location on the following day, Eacker fatally shot the 19-year-old Hamilton in a second duel.&lt;ref name=PBS/&gt;&lt;ref name=Harrison1896/&gt;

In a letter to [[Rufus King]], [[Robert Troup]] wrote of Alexander Hamilton, "Never did I see a man so completely overwhelmed with grief as Hamilton had been."&lt;ref name=King/&gt; Nevertheless, after Philip's death, the elder Hamilton was said to be civil and professional in his relationship with Eacker.&lt;ref name=Simms1882/&gt; Hamilton would later die [[Burr–Hamilton duel|in a duel with Aaron Burr]] only a few years later, on July 11, 1804, on the same dueling ground in Weehawken.

===Personal life and death===
Eacker died on January 4, 1804. His death was attributed to [[consumption (disease)|consumption]], or [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref name=Winfield203/&gt; According to Eacker's brother, the prolonged illness began in January 1802 on a bitterly cold night when Eacker fought a raging fire with his brigade, and contracted a severe cold that "settled upon his lungs" until his death.&lt;ref name=PBS /&gt;&lt;ref name=Simms1882/&gt;

His remains were interred at [[St. Paul's Chapel]] with military honors,&lt;ref name=Simms1882/&gt; and his funeral procession included members of the military, fire brigade, and the Howard Lodge of Freemasons.

Eacker and his fiancée never married. In January 1808, Harriet Livingston married the steamboat inventor [[Robert Fulton]], with whom she had four children.&lt;ref name=Reynolds1911&gt;{{cite book |last=Reynolds |first=Cuyler |title=Hudson-Mohawk Genealogical and Family Memoirs: A Record of Achievements of the People of the Hudson and Mohawk Valleys in New York State, Included Within the Present Counties of Albany, Rensselaer, Washington, Saratoga, Montgomery, Fulton, Schenectady, Columbia and Greene |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b4k-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA302 |year=1911 |publisher=Lewis Historical Publishing Company |pages=302–303}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lancaster1909&gt;{{cite book |title=Historical Papers and Addresses of the Lancaster County Historical Society |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PP47AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA227 |year=1909 |pages=227–228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
Eacker appeared as a minor character in the 2015 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical ''[[Hamilton (musical)|Hamilton]]'', in which the musical number "Blow Us All Away" dramatized his duel with Philip Hamilton. The role of Eacker was originated on Broadway by a member of the show's ensemble, [[Ephraim Sykes|Ephraim M. Sykes]], who also appears as Eacker on the [[Hamilton (album)|original cast recording]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2276">'''Gilbert Dayton Hedden, Sr.''' (April 6, 1897 &amp;ndash; September 14, 1974) was an American industrialist, politician and treasure hunter. He was [[Mayor of Chatham Borough, New Jersey]] from 1934 to 1938&lt;ref name=RollingStone /&gt; and is most notable today for the progress he made in the 1930s towards solving the [[Oak Island]] treasure mystery, described as the costliest treasure hunt ever.&lt;ref&gt;D'Arcy O'Connor, ''The Big Dig: the $10 Million Search for Oak Island's Legendary Treasure,'' 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
In 1919 he became vice president and general manager of the [[Hedden Iron Construction Company]] in [[Hillside, New Jersey]]. They were fabricators and erectors of structural steel. On the sale in 1931 of the business to Bethlehem Steel Company, he became plant manager of the "Hedden" works.

On May 8, 1928, he read an article on Oak Island in ''[[The New York Times Magazine]].'' Hedden was fascinated by the story and determined to purchase the island and search for the treasure. He spent much of his fortune in search of the treasure. His search lasted from 1934 to 1936,&lt;ref name=SI /&gt; when he helped arrange for [[New York University]] engineering professor Edwin Hamilton to take over. Hedden bought the east end of the island in 1935 and attempted to drain the so-called Money Pit with a pump.&lt;ref name=RollingStone&gt;Sullivan, Randall (January 22, 2004). "The curse of Oak Island", ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' (940): 56.&lt;/ref&gt; His discoveries during the search included finding an inscribed stone, believed to be [[Masonic]], at Joudrey's Cove in 1936.&lt;ref name=SI&gt;Nickell, Joe (March–April 2000). "The secrets of Oak Island", ''[[The Skeptical Inquirer]]'' '''24''' (2): 14–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lives and vast amounts of wealth were lost. The treasure still remains, and other treasure hunters have since followed. Hedden is the most notable due to his large investments, [[engineering]] background, and early discoveries.

'''Grafton Njootli''' (March 10, 1947 – c. June 20, 1999) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] politician. He represented the [[electoral district (Canada)|electoral district]] of [[Vuntut Gwitchin (electoral district)|Old Crow]] in the [[Yukon Legislative Assembly]] from 1978 to 1982 as a member of the [[Yukon Progressive Conservative Party]].

Njootli, a community development and [[land claims]] advocate from the [[Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation]], was the first aboriginal person elected to the Yukon Legislative Assembly. He was appointed Minister of Health and Human Resources in the government of [[Chris Pearson (politician)|Chris Pearson]], but was forced to resign from the cabinet on May 25, 1979 after it was revealed that the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] were investigating an allegation that he had physically assaulted a female cab driver.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hougens.com/yukonHistory/facts_year/1970s.aspx?year70=1979 Yukon History]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was subsequently appointed Deputy Speaker of the House on October 14, 1980, and served in that capacity until the dissolution of the legislature in 1982.

Njootli died in June 1999 in a boating accident. His funeral was held on June 22 of that year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hansard.gov.yk.ca/29-legislature/session1/162_nov_2_1999.html Yukon Legislative Assembly ''Hansard''], November 2, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Helmut Horten''' (8 January 1909 [[Bonn]] – 30 November 1987, [[Croglio]], [[Switzerland]]) was a German entrepreneur who built up and owned the fourth-largest chain of department stores in [[Germany]]: the [[Horten AG]].

==Early life==
Helmut Horten was born on January 8, 1909 in [[Bonn]], Germany. His father was a judge.

==Career==
Horten was apprenticed in a [[Düsseldorf]] department store belonging to [[Leonhard Tietz]] before working for the [[Duisburg]] department store of the ''Gebrüder Alsberg'' (Alsberg brothers) company. When the [[Nazism|Nazis]] came to power in 1933, Horten was able to acquire the company from the Jewish owners, Strauß and Lauter, who fled to the [[United States]]. He was aided in this transaction by the banker [[Wilhelm Reinhold]] of the [[Commerzbank|Commerz- and Disconto-Bank]]. The bank was to become a partner in the newly formed Horten &amp; Co.

Until 1939, Horten acquired several other department stores and enjoyed a good relationship with the Nazi government despite that his grandfather, the (later) Catholic saint [[Titus Maria Horten]] died in custody in 1936. Horten was able to acquire the distribution rights to certain goods which were scarce due to war.

After the [[Second World War]] Horten was interned by the [[British Army]] in 1947 in [[Recklinghausen]]. Following a hunger strike he was released in 1948. He soon continued with the consolidation and expansion of his company, which he still owned. Horten introduced [[West Germany|Germany's]] first [[supermarket]] after a visit to the United States, the copying of this business model expanding the group quickly. In 1968, with 25,000 staff and turnover of [[Euro|€]]1 billion, he floated the group on the [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]].

In 1972 Horten sold his majority stake and retired from the business, which controversially lost a great deal of value soon afterwards. In 1994 the chain was bought by [[Galeria Kaufhof|Kaufhof Holding AG]], merged into the German retail group [[METRO AG]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metrogroup.de/servlet/PB/menu/1000094/index.html Metro AG - History]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
[[Image:Canale della Giudecca - Carinthia VII.jpg|thumb|right|150px|''Carinthia VII'', the personal yacht of Heidi Horten]]
In 1960, Horten met 19-year-old [[Austria]]n [[Heidi Horten|Heidi Jelinek]], a woman 32 years his junior, in a hotel bar in [[Velden am Wörthersee]]. The couple married on 23 July 1966 in [[Düsseldorf-Lohausen]] and moved to [[Croglio]] in the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]] of [[Ticino]] at the end of 1968. Horten enjoyed living the life of a wealthy man: he owned a [[BAC 1-11]] as a private jet, a series of private yachts named after [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], and a villa in [[Mülheim an der Ruhr]]. In [[Duisburg]], the centre of his business activities, he made donations to the tennis club, the carnival and the zoo. The Helmut Horten [[Foundation (nonprofit organization)|Stiftung]] promotes medical research.

His widow inherited his $1 billion fortune, and lives today between homes in [[Croglio]], [[Lyford Cay]], by the [[Wörthersee]] in Austria and a penthouse in [[Vienna]]. Rated within the world's 500 richest people by ''[[Forbes magazine|Forbes]]'', she also commissioned and owns one of the [[List of motor yachts by length|world's largest yachts]], in the ''[[Carinthia VII]]''.&lt;ref name=NetWorth&gt;{{cite news|title=Heidi Horten|publisher=''Forbes''|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/heidi-horten}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jeffrey Alexander Sterling''' is an American lawyer and former [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] employee who was arrested, charged, and convicted of violating the [[Espionage Act of 1917|Espionage Act]] for revealing details about [[Operation Merlin]] (covert operation to supply Iran with flawed nuclear warhead blueprints) to journalist [[James Risen]].&lt;ref name="NCBNY20110106"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/politics/Ex-CIA_officer_charged_with_leak_to_reporter-113042189.html|title=Ex-CIA Officer Charged with Leak to Reporter|publisher=NBC New York|accessdate=2011-01-07 |date=2011-01-06|first=Michael|last=Isikoff}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was based entirely on what the judge called "very powerful circumstantial evidence," with no direct evidence that Sterling shared any classified information with Risen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/embarrassing-the-government-is-the-ultimate-crime/|title=Embarrassing the Government Is the Ultimate Crime|work=The American Conservative|access-date=2017-05-29|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://theintercept.com/2015/06/18/jeffrey-sterling-took-on-the-cia-and-lost-everything/|title=How Jeffrey Sterling Took on the CIA — and Lost Everything|last=Maass2015-06-18T19:06:54+00:00|first=Peter MaassPeter|website=The Intercept|access-date=2017-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2015, Sterling was sentenced to 3½ years in prison.&lt;ref name=Sentencing&gt;{{cite news |title=Ex-CIA officer convicted in leak case sentenced to 3½ years in prison |author=Matt Zapotosky |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/ex-cia-officer-convicted-in-leak-case-sentenced-to-3-12-years-in-prison/2015/05/11/fc5427a6-f5a0-11e4-84a6-6d7c67c50db0_story.html |publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]'' |date=May 11, 2015 |accessdate=May 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 and 2017, he filed complaints and wrote letters regarding mistreatment, lack of medical treatment for life-threatening conditions, and false allegations against him by corrections officers leading to further punitive measures.&lt;ref name="shadowproof.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://shadowproof.com/2017/04/29/imprisoned-cia-whistleblower-jeffrey-sterling-put-solitary-officer-threatened/|title=Imprisoned Whistleblower ‘Feared For His Life’ After Threats From Guard|date=2017-04-29|website=Shadowproof|access-date=2017-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was released from prison in January 2018.

==Early life and education==
Sterling was born in [[Cape Girardeau, Missouri]].&lt;ref name="Special to the Beacon"/&gt; Sterling earned a political science degree at [[Millikin University]] in [[Decatur, Illinois]], in 1989. In 1992, he graduated from the [[Washington University School of Law]] in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]] as a [[Juris Doctor]].&lt;ref name=SLToday20110123/&gt;

==CIA employment==
Sterling joined the CIA on May 14, 1993. In 1995, he became operations officer in the [[Iran]] task force of the CIA's Near East and South Asia division. He held a [[top secret]] [[security clearance]] and had access to [[Sensitive Compartmented Information#Sensitive Compartmented Information .28SCI.29 and Special Access Programs .28SAP.29|sensitive compartmented information]], including classified cables, CIA informants, and operations.

After training in [[Persian language|Persian]] in 1997, he was sent first to [[Bonn]], [[Germany]], and two years later to [[New York City]] to recruit [[Iran]]ian nationals as agents for the CIA as part of a secret intelligence operation involving Iran's weapons capabilities.&lt;ref name="NYTIMES20020302"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/02/us/fired-by-cia-he-says-agency-practiced-bias.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|title=Fired by C.I.A., He Says Agency Practiced Bias|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2011-09-08 |date=2002-03-02|first=James|last=Risen}}&lt;/ref&gt; From early 1998 to May 2000, Sterling assumed responsibility as [[case officer]] for a Russian emigre with an engineering background in nuclear physics and production, whom the CIA employed as a carrier to pass flawed design plans to the Iranians.&lt;ref name="NO.1:10CR485(LMB)Doc402"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/jud/sterling/govt-exh-406.pdf|title=USA v. Sterling 10 CIA Exhibits on Merlin Ruse  |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|accessdate=2015-05-12 |date=2015-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2000, Sterling filed a complaint with the CIA's Equal Employment Office about management's alleged racial discrimination practices. The CIA subsequently revoked Sterling's authorization to receive or possess classified documents concerning the secret operation and placed him on administrative leave in March 2001.&lt;ref name="People20020520"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20137092,00.html|title=Out in the Cold: Agent Jeffrey Sterling Charges the CIA with Racial Discrimination|publisher=[[People (Magazine)|People]]|accessdate=2011-01-11 |date=2002-05-20|first=Thomas|last=Fields-Meyer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FBI_wfo010611"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://washingtondc.fbi.gov/dojpressrel/pressrel11/wfo010611.htm |title=Former CIA Officer Arrested for Alleged Unauthorized Disclosure of National Defense Information and Obstruction of Justice |publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation |accessdate=2011-01-08 |date=2011-01-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108102756/http://washingtondc.fbi.gov/dojpressrel/pressrel11/wfo010611.htm |archivedate=2011-01-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the failure of two settlement attempts, his contract with the CIA was terminated on January 31, 2002.&lt;ref name="NO.1:10CR485(LMB)"&gt;{{cite web|url=Case 1:10-cr-00485-LMB Document 1|title=United States of America v.

==Equal Employment lawsuit==
Sterling's lawsuit accusing CIA officials of racial discrimination was dismissed by the judge after the government successfully argued the [[state secrets privilege]] by alleging the litigation would require disclosure of classified information. The [[4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals]] upheld the dismissal, ruling in 2005 that "there is no way for Sterling to prove employment discrimination without exposing at least some classified details of the covert employment that gives context to his claim."&lt;ref name="NPR20050909"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4838701|title=Administration Employing State Secrets Privilege at Quick Clip |publisher=[[NPR]]|accessdate=2011-01-17 |first=Jackie|last=Northam|date=2005-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MSNBC20060109"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10776953/ns/us_news-life/|title=Supreme Court bars appeal of ex-CIA agent: African American former covert officer charged agency with bias |publisher=MSNBC|accessdate=2011-01-11 |date=2006-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ABCRadioNational20060425"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abc.com.au/rn/lawreport/stories/2006/1622740.htm|title=The CIA and control of 'insider tales'|publisher=[[ABC Radio National]]|accessdate=2011-01-17 |date=2006-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NationalJournal20080412"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationaljournal.com/magazine/reforming-the-state-secrets-privilege-20080412?mrefid=site_search |title=Reforming the State Secrets Privilege |work=[[National Journal]] |accessdate=2011-01-17 |first=Stuart |last=Taylor Jr. |date=2008-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309134018/http://nationaljournal.com/magazine/reforming-the-state-secrets-privilege-20080412?mrefid=site_search |archivedate=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conviction under the Espionage Act==
[[File:Fcienglewood.jpg|thumb|[[FCI Englewood]], where Sterling was located]]
Between 2002 and 2004, the U.S. federal government intercepted several interstate emails to and from Sterling, which were "(...) ''routed through a server located in the Eastern District of Virginia'' (...)". The authorities also traced telephone calls between Sterling and—according to a senior government official&lt;ref name="NCBNY20110106"/&gt;—the journalist and book author [[James Risen]]. In the intercepted communications, Sterling allegedly revealed national defense information to an unauthorized person.&lt;ref name="NO.1:10CR485(LMB)"/&gt; In March 2003 Sterling also raised concerns with the [[Senate Intelligence Committee]] about a "poorly executed and dangerous Operation Merlin."&lt;ref name="SIC01"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://exposefacts.org/the-invisible-man-jeffrey-sterling-cia-whistleblower |title=The Invisible Man: Jeffrey Sterling, CIA Whistleblower |publisher=ExposeFacts.org |accessdate=2011-05-12 |date=2015-01-27 |first=Norman |last=Solomon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 22, 2010, U.S. attorney [[Neil H. MacBride]] filed an indictment against Jeffrey Alexander Sterling on the Unlawful Retention and Unauthorized Disclosure of National Defense Information, Mail Fraud, Unauthorized Conveyance of Government Property, and Obstruction of Justice.

The goddess '''Jyoti''' is considered to be a Hindu goddess of light and the "[[Vel]]".  She is the daughter of Lord [[Shiva]] and Goddess [[Parvati]] and is closely associated with her brother Lord [[Murugan]] because she is the goddess of "vel" .

==Legends==
The goddess has two different myths based on her birth.  In the first myth, she emerges from [[Lord Shiva]]'s halo and is a physical manifestation of the lord, her father's grace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mid-day.com/articles/daughters-of-shiva/192003|title=Daughters of Shiva|date=9 December 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second myth, she is born from a spark from Goddess [[Parvati]]'s forehead, similar to how Lord [[Muruga]] is born from six sparks from Lord [[Shiva]]'s forehead.  From her, the [[Devi]] fashions a weapon that she presents to her son as Shakti [[Vel]]. With that weapon, Lord [[Muruga]] destroys the evil demon Surapadman.&lt;ref name="murugan.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://murugan.org/jyoti.htm|title=Skanda's Sister Jyoti|website=murugan.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed that she is in a formless or ''[[arupa]]'' state in all of her brother Lord Muruga's temples.  She is also thought to be the flame that her father [[Nataraja]] (a form of Shiva) holds.&lt;ref name="murugan.org"/&gt;

==Devotion and Worship==
In Shodasam, a major devotional composition by the sage [[Agastya]], the sage discovers and describes the role of the mother Manonmani, her husband ([[Shiva]] in the form Sadisiva) and their daughter Jyoti who are together in the Ajna cakra in our foreheads for each day of the waxing and waning of moon. The sage also recounts that how Jyoti was born of the Pranava pillar of ‘OM'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/GlobalSanatanDharma/posts/240973912700177|title=Global Organization of Hindus|website=www.facebook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goddess is called Saravanabhavai and is worshipped in her Vel form in many [[Muruga]] temples.  She is called Saravanabhavai to show that she is forever intertwined with Saravana or Muruga. In some parts of India, she is worshipped as the goddess Rayaki who is associated with the Vedic Raka.  In North India, she is known as the goddess Jwalaimukhi and highly revered.

The [[The X Factor (UK series 11)|eleventh UK series]] of ''[[The X Factor (UK)|The X Factor]]'' began on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] on 30 August 2014. The live shows started on 11 October. [[Mel B]] mentored the Boys, [[Cheryl Cole|Cheryl Fernandez-Versini]] mentored the Girls, [[Simon Cowell]] mentored the Over 25s and [[Louis Walsh]] mentored the Groups.

The 12 chosen finalists were Paul Akister, [[Andrea Faustini]], [[Jake Quickenden]], Chloe Jasmine, Stephanie Nala, [[Lauren Platt]], [[Fleur East]], [[Ben Haenow]], Jay James, [[Blonde Electra]], [[Stereo Kicks]] and [[Only The Young (band)|Only The Young]].&lt;ref name="finalists"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.itv.com/presscentre/press-packs/x-factor-2014-finalists|title=The X Factor 2014 finalists|date=6 October 2014|publisher=ITV|accessdate=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four wildcards were also chosen, with one from each category: Jack Walton (Boys), Lola Saunders (Girls), [[Stevi Ritchie]] (Over 25s) and Overload Generation (Groups).&lt;ref name="wildcards"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/tv/x-factor/404583/X-Factor-wildcards-revealed-Lola-Jack-Overload-Stevi|title=Welcome back wildcards!

==Boys==
The "Boys" category was mentored by Mel B. Contestants in this category are male soloists aged between 14 and 25. The six candidates at judges' houses were: Paul Akister, Danny Dearden, Andrea Faustini, Jordan Morris, [[Jake Quickenden]], and Jack Walton. Mel B chose:

===Paul Akister===
'''Paul Akister''' (born 11 March 1989) is a pub singer from [[Lancaster, Lancashire]]. He reached judges' houses in 2013, but [[Louis Walsh]] eliminated him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/11/11/x-factor-louis-walsh-paul-akister-mel-b_n_6138194.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer_us=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_cs=ev20ateKEfXD0Vdp9BzhDA|title='X Factor' Judges Mel B And Louis Walsh In New Feud Over Paul Akister's Elimination|date=11 November 2014|last=Welsh|first=Daniel|work=[[Huffington Post UK]]|accessdate=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In week 5, Akister was in the bottom two with Jay James&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ok.co.uk/celebrity-feature/587704/remember-paul-akister-from-x-factor-2014-this-is-what-hes-doing-now |work=OK!|title=Remember Paul Akister from X Factor 2014? This is what he's doing now}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sang [[Clown]] in the final showdown. His mentor [[Mel B]] and [[Cheryl Fernandez-Versini]] voted to save him while [[Simon Cowell]] and Walsh voted to eliminate him. This meant the result went to deadlock and Akister was eliminated. He finished in 9th place also missing a place on The X Factor 2015 Live Tour.&lt;ref name="Result 5"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thevisitor.co.uk/news/outrage-as-lancaster-singer-paul-akister-exits-the-x-factor-1-6943296|title=Outrage as Lancaster singer Paul Akister exits The X Factor|date=10 November 2014|work=The Visitor|accessdate=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Andrea Faustini===
{{main|Andrea Faustini}}
'''Andrea Faustini''' (born 17 June 1994)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andrea-faustini.com|title=Andrea Faustini Fan Club|accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an Italian student who was previously studying Chinese and Korean at the [[Sapienza University of Rome]].&lt;ref name="mirror"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/x-factor-2014-finalist-andrea-4385436|title=X Factor 2014 finalist Andrea Faustini: His story so far|author=Kara O'Neill|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He quit university&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/x_factor/6113202/The-Sun-treats-X-Factors-Andrea-Faustini-to-grub-and-a-London-tour.html|title=X Factor put me on diet... so I've been smuggling biscuits|last=Jones|first=Amy|date=19 November 2014|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|publisher=[[News UK]]|accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and came all the way from [[Rome]] to audition for the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2014-09-20/x-factor-2014-five-ways-to-get-andrea-faustinis-pug-look|title=X Factor 2014: Get Andrea Faustini's pug look with these five fashion choices|date=6 October 2014|work=[[Radio Times]]|publisher=[[Immediate Media Company]]|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 13 he won the Italian variety show ''[[Ti lascio una canzone]]''.&lt;ref name="Irish Mirror"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishmirror.ie/whats-on/x-factor-star-andrea-faustini-4450922|title=X Factor star Andrea Faustini on being bullied at school: Singing gives me strength|last=McPhee|first=Rod|date=16 October 2014|work=[[Irish Mirror]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the eliminations of Jake Quickenden in week 3, Jack Walton in week 4 and Paul Akister in week 5, Faustini became [[Mel B]]'s last remaining act in the competition. He was in the bottom two with Stevi Ritchie in week 7, but was saved after only [[Simon Cowell]] voted to send Ritchie through to the quarter-final but Mel B, [[Cheryl Fernandez-Versini]] and [[Louis Walsh]] all voted to send Faustini through to the quarter-final. However, after the series ended, voting statistics confirmed that Ritchie had received more votes than Faustini meaning that if Walsh sent the result to deadlock, Ritchie would've been sent through to the quarter-final and Faustini would have been eliminated.&lt;ref name="Result 7 part 2"/&gt; He was once again in the bottom two in the semi-final, this time with Lauren Platt. He was saved for a second time with only Fernandez-Versini voted to send Platt through to the final, while Mel B, Walsh and Cowell voted to send Faustini through to the final. However, once again, voting statistics revealed that Faustini had received the fewest public votes meaning if there wasn't a Final Showdown or if Cowell sent the result to deadlock, Platt would have been sent through to the final and Faustini would have been eliminated.&lt;ref name="Result 9"&gt;''X Factor'', UK series 11, week 9&lt;/ref&gt; After reaching the final, he finished in third place in the competition.

On 22 February 2015, it was announced that Faustini had signed a record deal with [[RCA Records]] and would be going to [[Los Angeles]] to record his debut album, due for release later in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/showbiz/rehab/426895/X-Factor-finalist-Andrea-Faustini-signs-record-deal-LA-America|title=X Factor finalist Andrea Faustini signs record deal in LA|last=Ingham|first=James|date=22 February 2015|work=[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]|publisher=[[Northern &amp; Shell]]|accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His debut album ''[[Kelly (Andrea Faustini album)|Kelly]]'' was released on 17 July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a650545/x-factors-andrea-faustini-announces-debut-album-kelly-for-july.html|title=X Factor's Andrea Faustini announces debut album Kelly for July|last=Lee|first=Ben|date=2 June 2015|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stephanie Nala===
'''Stephanie "Steph" Nala''' (born '''Stephanie Nala Edwards'''; 23 April 1994) is from [[Cheshunt]], [[Hertfordshire]]. She used to be in the group [[Luminites]], who made it to the final of ''[[Britain's Got Talent]]'' in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2014/09/20/the-x-factor-2014-britains-got-talent-finalist-steph-nala-ditches-the-luminites-to-go-solo-4876082/|title=The X Factor 2014: Britain's Got Talent finalist Steph Nala ditches the Luminites to go solo|last=Hewlett|first=Emily|date=20 September 2014|work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|publisher=[[DMG Media]]|accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nala ended up in the bottom three in week one but was narrowly saved by the public vote due to the judges reaching deadlock after her sing-off performance with Overload Generation.&lt;ref name="Result 1"&gt;''The X Factor'', UK series 11, week 1&lt;/ref&gt; She was, however, automatically eliminated in week 2 as the contestant with the lowest number of public votes. She finished in 14th place.&lt;ref name="Result 2"&gt;''The X Factor'', UK series 11, week 2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lauren Platt===

In the quarter-final, Platt was in the bottom two with Stereo Kicks but was sent through to the semi-final after the result went to deadlock with [[Louis Walsh]] and [[Mel B]] voting to send Stereo Kicks through to the semi-final while Fernandez-Versini and [[Simon Cowell]] voting to send Platt through to the semi-final.&lt;ref name="Result 8"&gt;''The X Factor'', UK series 11, week 8&lt;/ref&gt; In the semi-final, she was in the bottom two with Andrea Faustini and was eliminated after only Fernandez-Versini voted to send Platt through to the final. After the series finished, voting statistics revealed that Platt received more votes than Faustini meaning if there wasn't a Final Showdown or if Walsh and/or Cowell voted to send Platt through to the final or if the result went to deadlock, Platt would've been sent through to the final and Faustini would've been eliminated.&lt;ref name="Result 9"/&gt;  Her brother then auditioned as part of the dance group Entity Allstars for ''[[Britain's Got Talent (series 9)|Britain's Got Talent]]'' and got the golden buzzer from [[Alesha Dixon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2015-05-09/alesha-dixon-hits-bgt-golden-buzzer-for-entity-allstars|title=Alesha Dixon hits BGT Golden Buzzer for Entity Allstars|last=Daly|first=Emma|date=9 May 2015|work=[[Radio Times]]|publisher=[[Immediate Media Company]]|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jay James''' (born '''Jay James Picton''' in 1983, aged 33)&lt;ref name="Saundersfoot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/film-news/x-factors-welsh-contenders-come-7882009|title=X Factor's Welsh contenders come a cropper at Simon Cowell's house|last=McCrum|first=Kirstie|date=4 October 2014|work=[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a former [[Royal Navy]] fitness instructor from [[Saundersfoot]], in [[Pembrokeshire]].&lt;ref name="Saundersfoot" /&gt; He already had a record deal prior to the show and released his debut album ''[[Play It by Heart]]'' through [[Decca Records]] in 2012.&lt;ref name="before the show" /&gt; The same year, he featured on the song "Fly" by Cinematic, released on [[Black Butter Records]] (home to [[Rudimental]], [[Gorgon City]] and [[Clean Bandit]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earmilk.com/2012/03/27/cinematic-fly-feat-jay-james-picton-video/|title=Cinematic - "Fly" (Feat. Jay James Picton) (Video)|publisher=Earmilk|date=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

James was in the bottom two with Paul Akister in week 5, but he was saved after Walsh sent the vote to deadlock and Akister was eliminated as the contestant with fewest number of public votes.&lt;ref name="Result 5"/&gt; However, the following week, James was in the bottom two with Stevi Richie. The vote again went to deadlock, and James was voted out due to having the fewest public votes. He finished in 8th place. He was given a place in the X Factor Live Tour for coming in the top half, and anybody eliminated after him was in the X Factor Live Tour as well.&lt;ref name="Result 6"/&gt;

===Stevi Ritchie===
{{Main|Stevi Ritchie}}
'''Stevie "Stevi" Ritchie''' (born '''Steven Ritchie'''; 17 September 1980, aged 36) is from [[Colchester]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2014/09/02/x-factor-2014-contestant-stevi-ritchie-changes-name-so-he-doesnt-get-confused-with-porn-star-4854084/|title=X Factor 2014: Contestant Stevi Ritchie changes name to stop confusion with porn star|last=Baillie|first=Katie|date=2 September 2014|work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|publisher=[[DMG Media]]|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was not initially through to the live shows, but Fernandez-Versini brought him back as the Over 25s' wildcard.&lt;ref name="wildcards"/&gt;

After the eliminations of Overload Generation in week 1 and Jack Walton and Lola Saunders in week 4, Ritchie was the last wildcard left in the competition. In week 6, Ritchie found himself in the bottom two with fellow Over 25 Jay James. His mentor Cowell and Walsh opted to send him home, but Mel B and Fernandez-Versini, who picked him as the wildcard act and had the deciding vote, opted to send James home, resulting in Ritchie being saved after the result went to deadlock.&lt;ref name="Result 6"&gt;''The X Factor'', UK series 11, week 6&lt;/ref&gt; The following week, he was in the bottom two again with Andrea Faustini and was eliminated by the judges with only his mentor Cowell voting to send Ritchie through to the quarter-final and Mel B, Fernandez-Versini and Walsh voting to send Faustini through to the quarter-final. However voting statistics confirmed that Ritchie had actually received more votes than Faustini, meaning if Walsh sent the vote to deadlock, Ritchie would have been sent through to the quarter-final and Faustini would have been eliminated.&lt;ref name="Result 7 part 2"&gt;''The X Factor'', UK series 11, week 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the X Factor Stevi participated in Celebrity Big Brother for England, where she came 5th with girlfriend Chloe-Jasmine.

==Groups==
The 'Groups' category was mentored by Louis Walsh. Contestants in this category are either duos or vocal harmony groups, all aged 16 and over. The six candidates at judges' houses were: Blonde Electra, Concept, New Boy Band, New Girl Group, Only The Young, and The Brooks. Walsh chose:

===Blonde Electra===
{{main|Blonde Electra}}
'''Blonde Electra''' (formerly '''Blonde Electric''') are a duo consisting of half-English, half-German sisters Jazzy and Ruby King.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s103/the-x-factor/news/a601335/x-factors-blonde-electric-we-want-to-give-simon-cowell-a-panic-attack.html|title=X Factor's Blonde Electric: 'We want to give Simon Cowell a panic attack'|last=Alexander|first=Susannah|date=5 October 2014|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have drawn comparisons to former ''X Factor'' contestants [[Jedward]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/tv/x-factor/402938/X-Factor-groups-top-three-Blonde-Electric-Only-The-Young-new-boyband|title=X Factor: Louis Walsh puts Blonde Electric, Only The Young, New Boyband in final 12|last=Percival|first=Ash|date=4 October 2014|work=[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]|publisher=[[Northern &amp; Shell]]|accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally called Blonde Electric, they changed their name before the live shows. Explaining the reason for their name change, Jazzy said "Blonde Electric is a little too descriptive. We are going for an independent, strong woman that represents Blonde Electra. That is why, but I like it. I think it's got a good ring to it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/showbiz/s103/the-x-factor/news/a602399/x-factors-blonde-electra-debut-wacky-hair-explain-recent-name-change.html|title=X Factor's Blonde Electra debut wacky hair, explain recent name change|last=Gordon|first=Naomi|date=9 October 2014|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Blonde Electra were automatically eliminated in week 1 after receiving the fewest public votes, coming in 16th place.&lt;ref name="Result 1"/&gt;

===Only The Young===
{{main|Only The Young (band)}}
'''Only The Young''' were a four-piece mixed group consisting of Mikey Bromley (20, [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]]), Parisa Tarjomani (21, [[Ramsgate]]), Betsy-Blue English (19, [[Brighton]]), and Charlie George (17, [[Chartham]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/tv/x-factor/397423/X-Factor-Only-The-Young-performed-at-Wembley-with-Cheryl|title=X Factor hopefuls Only The Young performed at Wembley gig with Cheryl|last=Kelly|first=Emma|date=1 September 2014|work=[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]|publisher=[[Northern &amp; Shell]]|accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group were created and are currently managed by Jo Perry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bouwman|first1=Kimbel|url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/2013/May30_15_29_1.html|website=Hit Quarters|accessdate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only The Young previously featured [[George Shelley (singer)|George Shelley]], who auditioned for the show's [[The X Factor (UK series 9)|ninth series]] and was added to [[Union J]], who made the live shows, eventually finishing in fourth place in the semi-final. This was when Shelley was later replaced by Bromley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sugarscape.com/music/news/a1070905/its-only-the-youngs-2-year-anniversary-lets-celebrate-by-looking-back-at-their-journey-to-the-x-factor/|title=It's Only The Young's 2 year anniversary - Let's celebrate by looking back at their journey to The X Factor|work=Sugarscape}}&lt;/ref&gt; While on the series, Only The Young released their version of [[Bobby "Boris" Pickett]]'s "[[Monster Mash]]" in aid of [[Teenage Cancer Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.justgiving.com/OnlyTheYoung/|title=Only The Young is fundraising for Teenage Cancer Trust|publisher=[[Teenage Cancer Trust]]|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the show, they auditioned for [[Capital (radio network)|Capital's]] [[Summertime Ball]] on 21 June, and were chosen to perform at [[Wembley Stadium]] alongside [[Pharrell Williams]], [[Miley Cyrus]], [[David Guetta]], [[Enrique Iglesias]], [[Little Mix]] and many other artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capitalfm.com/summertime-ball/news/only-the-young/|title=New Band Only The Young Win Chance To Perform At The Capital Summertime Ball|date=1 June 2014|publisher=[[Capital (radio network)|Capital]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

They were in the bottom two with Jake Quickenden in week three, but they were saved after receiving only Mel B's vote against them.&lt;ref name="Result 3"/&gt; They were automatically eliminated in week seven as the act with the fewest public votes on Saturday, coming in 7th place.

Two weeks after being voted off the show, the group announced their first headlining show which would be held in London's Under the Bridge on 28 December 2014, thus becoming the first act of the series to be successful after leaving the show. However, the group have since had to pull out of the event following the death of Tarjomani's mother on 21 December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/x-factor-only-young-singer-4858151|title=X Factor: Only the Young singer Parisa Tarjomani's mum dies|first=Tufayel|last=Ahmed|date=22 December 2014|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 May 2015, the group announced that they had signed a record deal with [[Warner Music]]. The music video of their debut single "[[I Do (Only The Young song)|I Do]]" was released on 8 June 2015, but their [[YouTube]] account was hacked four days later, which led to its deletion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sugarscape.com/music/news/a1078904/only-the-young-hacked/|title=Only The Young thank fans for their support following 'I Do' music video hacking drama|work=Sugarscape}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was re-uploaded the next day (13 June), losing all its previous views.

===Overload Generation===
'''Overload Generation''' (formerly '''Overload''') were a five-piece boy band consisting of Ollie Garland (born 28 November 1994, 22, [[Bristol]]), Jordi Whitworth (born 27 March 1995, 22, [[Essex]]), Ryan Robertson (born 30 January 1996, 21 [[Essex]]), Joey Devries (born 10 August 1994, 22 [[Wales]]) and Andy Fowler (Previously in [[Only One Direction]]. Currently in [[RoadTrip]]) (born 16 February  1994, 24 [[Manchester]]) who have been a five-piece since April 2014.

The group changed their name because of trademarks. They were eliminated in week one after landing in the sing-off with Stephanie Nala and receiving fewer public votes than Nala, as the result went to deadlock. They finished in 15th place.

'''Matthäus Daniel Pöppelmann''' (3.5.1662-17.1.1736) was a [[Germany|German]] master builder who helped to rebuild [[Dresden]] after the fire of 1685.

Pöppelmann was born in [[Herford]]. As court architect for the King of Poland and Elector of Saxony, [[Augustus II the Strong]], he designed the grandiose [[Zwinger (Dresden)|Zwinger]] palace in Dresden.&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Löffler, ''Das Alte Dresden: Geschichte seiner Bauten'',  16th ed. Leipzig: Seemann, 2006, {{ISBN|978-3-86502-000-0}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also in charge of major works at [[Dresden Castle]], [[Pillnitz Castle]] and he designed the Vineyard Church (''Weinbergkirche'') in Pillnitz. Pöppelmann, together with [[Johann Christoph Naumann]], developed an urban plan for a portion of the city of [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]], which was only partially realized, including the [[Saxon Axis]] and other important streetscapes. 

He died in [[Dresden]] in 1736.

[[File:Oscar Pistorius 2 Daegu 2011.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Oscar Pistorius]] running during the [[2011 World Championships in Athletics]] in [[Daegu]], South Korea]]

The '''mechanics of the running blades''' used by South African Paralympic runner [[Oscar Pistorius]] depend on [[Flex-Foot Cheetah|special]] [[carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer]] [[prosthesis|prosthetics]].  Pistorius has double below-the-knee [[amputations]] and competes in both non-disabled and [[T44 (classification)|T44]] amputee [[athletics (sport)|athletics]] events. Pistorius's eligibility to run in international non-disabled events is sanctioned by the International Association of Athletics Federations ([[IAAF]]).

Pistorius began running in 2004 after a rugby knee injury which led to rehabilitation at the [[University of Pretoria]]'s High Performance Centre&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Mike Moon |title=Blade Runner: Oscar Pistorius is forcing the world to rethink what it means to be disabled |url=http://www.rdasia.com/article/2730/ |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AH3zjOKd?url=http://www.rdasia.com/article/2730/ |archivedate=29 August 2012 |magazine=[[Reader's Digest|Reader's Digest Asia]] |year=2012 |accessdate=29 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with coach Ampie Louw.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/mysport/2312850/My-Sport-Oscar-Pistorius.html|author=Davies, Gareth A. (interviewer)|date=23 May 2007|title=My sport: Oscar Pistorius|publisher=The Daily Telegraph (London)|accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first racing blades were fitted by South African [[prosthetist]] Francois Vanderwatt. Because he was unable to find suitable running blades in [[Pretoria]], Vanderwatt ordered some to be made by a local engineer at Hanger Orthopedic Group. These quickly broke, and Vanderwatt referred Pistorius to American prosthetist and Paralympic sprinter [[Brian Frasure]] to be fitted for carbon-fibre blades by [[Iceland]]ic company [[Össur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Felix Gillette |title=Racing tall: A Paralympian stands accused of getting an illegal leg up |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/sports/left_field/2004/11/racing_tall.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AcuKt59K?url=http://www.slate.com/articles/sports/left_field/2004/11/racing_tall.html |archivedate=12 September 2012 |magazine=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=10 November 2004 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pistorius's participation in non-disabled international sprinting competitions in 2007 raised questions about his use of running blades, and the IAAF amended their rules to ban the use of "any technical device that incorporates springs, wheels or any other element that provides a user with an advantage over another athlete not using such a device." After initial studies, Pistorius was ruled ineligible for competitions under these IAAF rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/athletics/2288489/IAAF-call-time-on-Oscar-Pistorius-dream.html|author=Knight, Tom|date=10 January 2008|title=IAAF call time on Oscar Pistorius' dream|publisher=The Daily Telegraph (London)|accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After further research was presented, the Court of Arbitration ([[Court of Arbitration for Sport|CAS]]) ruled that his running prostheses were not shown to provide a net competitive advantage over biological legs.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/may/18/olympicgames2008.athletics |author=Mackay, Duncan|date=18 May 2008|title=Diack relaxed over Pistorius's victory|publisher=The Observer|accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 Pistorius qualified for and competed in both the [[2012 Olympic Games]] and the [[2012 Paralympic Games]] using his running blades, becoming the first amputee sprinter to run in the Olympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/oscar-pistorius-makes-history-double-amputee-sprinter-compete/story?id=16929845|title=Pistorius, 25, Is First Double-Amputee Sprinter to Compete in Olympic Games|author=Shaw, Alexis|publisher=ABC|date=4 August 2012|accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pistorius's athletics prostheses==
The blades are [[transtibial prosthesis|transtibial prostheses]], meaning they replace legs and feet that are amputated below the knee (BK). They were developed by medical engineer [[Van Phillips (inventor)|Van Phillips]] who incorporated Flex-Foot, Inc., in 1984, and in 2000 sold the company to [[Össur]] which now (in 2012) manufactures the blades. They are designed to store kinetic energy like a spring, allowing the wearer to jump and run effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=A Personal Call to a Prosthetic Invention|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/02/sports/olympics/02cheetah.html?ref=sports|date=2008-07-02|accessdate=19 September 2012|publisher=New York Times|author=Pogash, Carol}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carbon fibre is actually a [[carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer]], and is a strong, light-weight material used in a number of applications, including sporting goods like baseball bats, car parts, helmets, sailboats, bicycles and other equipment where rigidity and high [[strength-to-weight ratio]] is important. The polymer used for this equipment is normally [[epoxy]], but other polymers are also used, depending on the application, and other reinforcing fibres may also be included. In the blade manufacturing process, sheets of impregnated material are cut into square sheets and pressed onto a form to produce the final shape. From 30 to 90 sheets may be layered, depending on the expected weight of the athlete, and the mold is then autoclaved to fuse the sheets into a solid plate. This method reduces air bubbles that can cause breaks. Once the result is cooled, it is cut into the shape of the blades. The finished blade is bolted to a carbon fibre socket that is an intimate fit to each of Pistorius' legs. These are custom made and make up the bulk of the total cost, along with the assessment and setting up of the finished prostheses. Each limb costs between $15–18,000 USD.&lt;ref name=blades /&gt;

Pistorius has been using the same Össur blades since 2004. He was born without [[fibula]]e and with malformed feet, and his legs were amputated about halfway between knee and ankle so he could wear prosthetic legs. He wears socks and pads which are visible above the sockets to reduce chafing and to prevent blisters, and the sockets have straps in the front that can be tightened to make the prosthesis fit more snugly.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/column-pistorius-revolutionizes-olympic-notions|title=Column: Pistorius revolutionizes Olympic notions|author=Leicester, John|date=4 August 2012|accessdate=22 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pistorius uses custom-made spike pads on the blades. Before development of the pads, his spikes were changed by roughing up the surface and applying over-the-counter spikes by hand, but the results using this method were inconsistent. Research was conducted in Össur’s Iceland lab using a pressure-sensitive treadmill and film at 500 [[Frame rate|fps]] to measure the blade strike, and produced a spike pad which includes a midsole of two machine-molded pieces of foam of different densities to cushion impact, with a carbon fibre plate on the bottom. The developers attached the pad with contact cement, which can be quickly removed with the application of heat when the spike pad needs to be changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.fastcodesign.com/1670487/how-nike-made-track-spikes-for-oscar-pistorius-s-carbon-fiber-blades|title=How Nike Made Track Spikes For Oscar Pistorius’s Carbon Fiber Blades|author=Wilson, Mark|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the curved design, the blades have to be slightly longer than a runner's biological leg and foot would be. The blades replace the hinge of an ankle with elastic compression that bends and releases the blade with every stride, so the uncompressed blade leaves the user standing on tiptoe. They are designed to move forward, so have no heel support in the back. According to Josh McHugh of [[Wired Magazine]], "The Cheetahs seem to bounce of their own accord. It’s impossible to stand still on them, and difficult to move slowly. Once they get going, Cheetahs are extremely hard to control."&lt;ref name=blades&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/15.03/blade.html?pg=2&amp;topic=blade&amp;topic_set=|author=McHugh, Josh|date=March 2007|publisher=Wired Magazine|title=Blade Runner|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==How the blades work==
[[File:Oscar Pistorius-2.jpg|thumb|upright|Pistorius running in Iceland in 2007.]]

In 2007 Pistorius applied to run in non-disabled track meets. He was at first accepted, but questions quickly arose about whether the blades give him an unfair advantage. After initial research showed the blades did provide an advantage, the [[International Association of Athletics Federations]] (IAAF) changed their rules to ban the use of technical devices that provide an advantage and ruled him ineligible to compete. Pistorius challenged the ruling with additional research and was reinstated by the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] (CAS) in 2008, meaning that he can continue to run in non-disabled meets as long as he uses the equipment that was studied in the research.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/29/paralympics-2012-oscar-pistorius|title=Paralympics 2012: Oscar Pistorius shows what Paralympians can achieve|author=Bull, Andy|date=28 August 2012|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pistorius's performance in the early non-disabled races raised questions because of two major concerns: his pattern of running the races and his leg-swing times. Most sprinters spring out of the blocks with their fastest time and slow down as the race progresses, but Pistorius ran a "negative split," starting slowly and building up speed in the last half of the race (though he no longer uses this pattern). His average time was also less in the 400m race when compared to other runners than in the 200m.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/olympics/2012/writers/david_epstein/08/03/oscar-pistorius-london-olympics/index.html|title=Fair or foul? Experts split over whether Pistorius has advantage|author=Epstein, David|date=4 August 2012|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Controversy about the use of the blades persists, but the research provided considerable information on how they work in application, and other research is expected to follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://theconversation.edu.au/pistorius-loss-to-oliveira-fuels-the-disruptive-technology-debate-9250|title=Pistorius' loss to Oliveira fuels the ‘disruptive technology’ debate|author=Lyons, Keith|date=3 September 2012|accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-disabled sprinters have calves and ankles that return and amplify the energy supplied by their hips and knees, while Pistorius compensates with additional work because he does not have calves and ankles with their associated tendons and muscles. An analysis published by ''[[Engineering &amp; Technology]]'' magazine estimates that in using the blades, Pistorius must generate twice the power from his [[gluteal muscles|gluteal]] and [[quadriceps]] muscles that a normal sprinter would.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://engtechmag.wordpress.com/2012/08/28/london-2012-paralympic-games-oscar-pistorius-blades-an-annotated-graphic|title=London 2012 Paralympic games, Oscar Pistorius’ blades – an annotated graphic|publisher=Engineering &amp; Technology|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources also credit core abdominal muscles and a faster arm swing.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.nbcolympics.com/video/track-and-field/science-of-olympics-how-oscar-pistorius-blades-work.html|title=Science of the Olympics: How Oscar Pistorius' blades work|publisher=NBC|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His trainer estimates that about 85 percent of his power comes from his hips and the rest from his knees. This results in a gait that waddles slightly, as Pistorius swings his upper body to balance the springing action of the blades. The blades compress under his weight, then release as he moves forward, providing forward thrust from the tips as they return to their molded shape. As they spring off, he swings them slightly out to the side and throws them forward for the next stride.&lt;ref name=blades /&gt;

Pistorius is always slow in starting a race because the flexible blades do not provide thrust out of the blocks. Pistorius must begin from an awkward position, swing his leg to the outside and pop straight up from the blocks to begin running, when the preferred method is to push off with horizontal force.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/06/sports/olympics/pistorius-eliminated-track-and-field-roundup.html?pagewanted=all|title=Pistorius Misses Chance at Final, but Remains Upbeat|publisher=The New York Times|author=Borden, Sam|date=5 August 2012|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/08/no-advantage-to-being-an-amputee-a-defense-of-oscar-pistoriuss-prostheses/260878|title='No Advantage to Being an Amputee': A Defense of Oscar Pistorius's Prostheses|author=Simpson, Jake|publisher=The Atlantic|date=8 August 2012|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first 30 meters of a race, he keeps his head down and takes short, quick strides. As he establishes a rhythm, he can raise his head and increase his speed. While some runners jog up and down, losing energy, Pistorius directs energy forward, looking somewhat like he is rolling on wheels. He also compensates for the adjustments ankles make on the turns, breaking the curves into short, straight lines. According to his coach Ampie Louw, Pistorius may be able to use the inward lean to generate force and come out of a turn going faster.&lt;ref name=blades /&gt;

==Research==

===Brüggemann study===
[[File:Oscar Pistorius, the first round of the 400m at the London 2012 Olympic Games.jpeg|thumb|left|Pistorius running in the first round of the 400m at the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London]]

To resolve questions about the blades, Pistorius was asked to take part in a series of scientific tests in November 2007 at the [[German Sport University Cologne]] with Professor of [[Biomechanics]] Peter Brüggemann and IAAF technical expert Elio Locatelli. After two days of tests, Brüggemann reported that Pistorius used about 25 percent less energy expenditure than non-disabled athletes once he achieved a given speed. The study also found that he showed major differences in sprint mechanics, with significantly different maximum vertical ground return forces, and that the positive work or returned energy was close to three times higher than that of a human ankle. The energy loss in the blade during stance phase when the foot was on the ground was measured as 9.3 percent, while that of normal ankle joint was measured at 42.4 percent, showing a difference of more than 30 percent. Brüggemann's analysis stated that the blades allowed lower energy consumption at the same speed, and that the energy loss in the blade is significantly less than in a human ankle at maximum speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.iaaf.org/news/printer,newsid=42896.htmx|title=Oscar Pistorius - Independent Scientific study concludes that cheetah prosthetics offer clear mechanical advantages|date=14 January 2008|publisher=IAAF|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December of that year, Brüggemann stated to ''[[Die Welt]]'' newspaper that Pistorius "has considerable advantages over athletes without prosthetic limbs who were tested by us. It was more than just a few percentage points. I did not expect it to be so clear."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Report: Artificial limbs give paralympic champion competitive edge|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/12/20/sports/athletics20.php|newspaper=[[International Herald Tribune]]|date=20 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study was published in 2008 in ''Sports Technology'',&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://users.auth.gr/~lmademli/Analysi_Vadisis/Pistorius_SportsTechnology2008.pdf |title=Biomechanics of double transtibial amputee sprinting using dedicated sprinting prostheses |first=Gert-Peter |last=Bruggemann |first2=Adamantios |last2=Arampatzis |first3=Frank |last3=Emrich |first4=Wolfgang |last4=Potthast |year=2008 |accessdate=3 October 2012 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; but later researchers stated that the analysis "did not take enough variables into consideration". Commentators have also argued that the IAAF study did not accurately determine whether Cheetahs confer a net advantage because measuring the net advantage or disadvantage conferred on an athlete using Cheetahs is not possible given current scientific knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jonathan Clayton|title=Oscar Pistorius vows to fight Olympics ban|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/more_sport/athletics/article3186862.ece|newspaper=[[The Times]]|location=London|date=15 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the IAAF study may not have measured Pistorius’s performance against appropriate controls. IAAF used five non-disabled athletes, who run 400-meter races in similar times to Pistorius, as controls. However, because Pistorius was relatively new to the sport of running, he may not have trained enough to maximize his physical potential and reach his peak performance when the IAAF study was conducted. In March 2007, approximately 9 months before the IAAF study was conducted, Pistorius’s coach commented that Pistorius had not trained enough to achieve an upper body commensurate with the upper bodies of most elite sprinters. To obtain the most accurate understanding of how the prostheses affect Pistorius’s performance, he should be compared to athletes with similar physical potential. Consequently, the IAAF study may have been flawed because it compared Pistorius, who might have the physical potential to run faster than his current times, against athletes at their peak.

===Weyand, et al. study===
In 2008 a team of seven researchers conducted tests at [[Rice University]], including Peter Weyand, [[Hugh Herr]], Rodger Kram, Matthew Bundle and Alena Grabowski. The team collected [[metabolic]] and mechanical data by indirect [[calorimetry]] and ground reaction force measurements on Pistorius's performance during constant-speed, level treadmill running, and found that the energy usage was 3.8 percent lower than average values for elite non-disabled distance runners, 6.7 percent lower than for average distance runners and 17 percent lower than for non-disabled 400m sprint runners. At sprinting speeds of 8.0, 9.0 and 10.0&amp;nbsp;m/s, Pistorius produced longer foot to ground contact times, shorter leg swing times, and lower average vertical forces than able bodied sprinters. The team concluded that running on the blades appears to be physiologically similar but mechanically different from running with biological legs. The study was published several months later in the ''[[Journal of Applied Physiology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/specialsections/summerolympics/Does-Double-Amputee-Oscar-Pistorius-Have-an-Unfair-Advantage-at-the-2012-Olympic-Games-162598806.html#ixzz26wkjbD00|title=Does Double-Amputee Oscar Pistorius Have an Unfair Advantage at the 2012 Olympic Games?|author=Eveleth, Rose|date=23 July 2012|publisher=Smithsonian Magazine|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://jap.physiology.org/content/107/3/903.abstract|publisher=Journal of Applied Physiology|title=The fastest runner on artificial legs: different limbs, similar function?|first=Peter G.|last=Weyand|first2=Matthew W.|last2=Bundle|first3=Craig P.|last3=McGowan|first4=Alena|last4=Grabowski|first5=Mary Beth|last5=Brown|first6=Rodger|last6=Kram|first7=Hugh|last7=Herr|date=17 February 2009|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kram also stated that Pistorius's "rate of energy consumption was lower than an average person but comparable to other high-caliber athletes."&lt;ref name=study&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.denverpost.com/perspective/ci_21056327/cu-boulder-researchers-help-oscar-pistorius-become-first#ixzz26ya4Ropt|title= CU-Boulder researchers help Oscar Pistorius become first amputee to compete in Olympics: Research shows his prostheses are not an advantage|date=11 July 2012|author=Bryen, Whitney|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lightness and rigidity of the blade compared to muscle and bone may allow blade runners to swing their legs faster than non-disabled runners. In comments on the article, Peter Weyand and biomechanist Matthew Bundle noted that the study found that Pistorius re-positioned his legs 15.7 percent faster than most world record sprinters, allowing for a 15 to 30 percent increase in sprint speed.&lt;ref name=study2&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rami-hashish/oscar-pistorius-prosthetic-legs-advantage_b_1766417.html|title=Oscar Pistorius' Prosthetic Legs: Do They Give Him an Advantage Over Other Olympic Runners?|author=Hashish, Rami|publisher=Huffington Post|date=10 August 2012|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grabowski, et al. study===
In 2008 a research team including Alena Grabowski, Rodger Kram and Hugh Herr conducted a follow-up study of single amputees with running blades which was published in ''[[Biology Letters]]''. Each of six amputees' affected leg performance was compared against that of their biological leg. The team measured leg swing times and force applied to the running surface on a high-speed treadmill at the Biomechanics Laboratory of [[the Orthopedic Specialty Hospital]], and also studied video of sprint runners from the Olympics and Paralympics. They found no difference in leg swing times at different speeds, and recorded leg swing times similar to that of non-disabled sprinters. They also found that single running blades reduced the foot to ground force production of the tested runners by an average of 9 percent. Because force production is generally considered the most significant factor in running speed, the researchers concluded that this reduction in force limited the sprinters' top speed. Grabowski also found that amputees typically increased their leg swing times to compensate for the lack of force.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2009/11/02/rsbl.2009.0729.abstract|title=Running-specific prostheses limit ground-force during sprinting|first=Alena M.|last=Grabowski1|first2=Craig P.|last2=McGowan|first3=William J.|last3=McDermott|first4=Matthew T.|last4=Beale|first5=Rodger|last5=Kram|first6=Hugh M.|last6=Herr|publisher=Biology Letters|date=4 September 2009|accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other discussion===
Discussion continues about the relative advantage or disadvantage of using the blades. Researchers and analysts also point out that the research studies are done on level, stationary treadmills, and do not measure performance from starting blocks or on actual curved tracks. They also do not take into account differences in physiology between amputees and non-amputees, who have such factors as musculature, blade height and weight and differences in blood circulation patterns due to the history of their limb loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www2.teamusa.org/US-Paralympics/Features/2012/August/04/American-blade-runner-Jarryd-Wallace.aspx?p=1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120806200822/http://www.teamusa.org/US-Paralympics/Features/2012/August/04/American-blade-runner-Jarryd-Wallace.aspx?p=1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=6 August 2012 |title=American blade runner: Jarryd Wallace |author=Rosewater, Amy |date=4 August 2012 |accessdate=22 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2012 Paralympics==
A controversy over the effects of running blade length arose at the [[2012 Paralympic Games]], as Brazilian runner [[Alan Oliveira]] and USA runner [[Blake Leeper]] changed to longer running blades within a few months before the 2012 Paralympic Games. This led to marked improvement in their running times. Pistorius complained after the 200m race that the blades provided artificially lengthened running strides, which would be an infringement of the [[International Paralympic Committee|IPC]] rules, regardless of that the blades were within the allowable height limits for the athletes concerned.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/paralympic-sport/9517308/Oscar-Pistorius-blade-controversy-sour-grapes-or-is-South-African-right-to-complain-about-Alan-Oliveiras-blades.html|title=Oscar Pistorius blade controversy: sour grapes or is South African right to complain about Alan Oliveira's blades?|author=Hart, Simon|date=3 September 2012|accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His complaint was supported by single-leg runners including [[Jerome Singleton]] and [[Jack Swift]], who called for the [[T43 (classification)|T43]] double blade and [[T44 (classification)|T44]] single blade classes to be separated in future events, as single blade runners were unable to adjust the height of the prostheses, and must always match the length of their biological leg with a running blade.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Sam Cunningham |title=Oscar 'right to fight' as Paralympics blades row speeds up |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/othersports/article-2198913/Oscar-Pistorius-right-fight-blades-row-speeds-up.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ATEzRGgf?url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/othersports/article-2198913/Oscar-Pistorius-right-fight-blades-row-speeds-up.html |archivedate= 6 September 2012 |newspaper=Daily Mail |date=5 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The improvement in running time and the wide broadcast of the race results provided a public demonstration of how the blade length affects performance. Pistorius' stride length was actually 9 percent longer (2.2m vs 2.0m), but Oliveira took more strides (99 vs 92). The combination of stride length and stride rate led to a clearly unusual performance with the longer blades.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.sportsscientists.com/2012_09_01_archive.html |title=Pistorius vs Oliveira and Technology.

'''Ned Vizzini''' (born '''Edison Price Vizzini''',&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news |last=Yardley |first=William |date=December 20, 2013 |title=Ned Vizzini, 32, Dies; Wrote Teenage Novels |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/21/books/ned-vizzini-author-of-teenage-novels-dies-at-32.html |newspaper=New York Times |location= |publisher= |accessdate=December 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; April 4, 1981 – December 19, 2013) was an American writer. He was the author of four [[young adult fiction|books for young adults]] including ''[[It's Kind of a Funny Story]]'', which [[NPR]] named #56 of the "100 Best-Ever Teen Novels" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Best Young Adult Novels, Best Teen Fiction, Top 100 Teen Novels : NPR|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/08/07/157795366/your-favorites-100-best-ever-teen-novels|accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and which is the basis of the [[It's Kind of a Funny Story (film)|film of the same name]].

Vizzini suffered from [[Major depressive disorder|depression]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2527282/Ned-Vizzini-Young-adult-author-memoir-depression-film-Zach-Galifianakis-Emma-Roberts-commits-suicide-aged-32.html 'Young adult' author whose memoir about depression was made into Zach Galifianakis film commits suicide aged 32] ''[[Daily Mail]]'', 20 December 2013.

==Early life==
Ned Vizzini grew up primarily in the [[Park Slope, Brooklyn|Park Slope]] neighborhood of [[Brooklyn]] in [[New York City]]. He attended [[Stuyvesant High School]] in [[Manhattan]], graduating in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/news/newsreleases/2002/ned_vizzini.html |title=Teen Angst Author and Hunter College Student Ned Vizzini to Speak About Writing and Publishing At May 1 Book Signing |date=April 2002 |accessdate=November 1, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814080830/http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/news/newsreleases/2002/ned_vizzini.html |archivedate=August 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vizzini's characters and situations are said to be based upon his time spent at Stuyvesant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2006-11-07/art/too-hot-to-handle/|title=Too Hot to Handle|author=Catherine Wigginton|date=November 7, 2006|accessdate=April 28, 2008|publisher=Village Voice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Vizzini's first published work was an essay he submitted to the ''[[New York Press]]'', an [[alternative newspaper]], about winning honorable mention at the 1996 [[Scholastic Art &amp; Writing Awards#The Scholastic Art &amp; Writing Awards|Scholastic Art &amp; Writing Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ned Vizzini {{!}} FAQ|url=http://nedvizzini.com/faq/#reader_75|work=What are ten important dates in your life and what happened on those dates?|accessdate=23 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524210631/http://www.nedvizzini.com/faq/#reader_75|archivedate=24 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a freelance writer for the paper, he wrote about everything from family vacations to getting drunk in the street with other kids. The success of Vizzini's work earned him an invitation to contribute a teen-focused article to the ''[[New York Times Magazine]]''.&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Ned Vizzini (1981-)|journal=Something About the Author|year=2008|volume=179|pages=196–198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1998, Vizzini's essay "Teen Angst? Nah!" appeared in ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vizzini|first=Ned|title=Advice; Teen Angst? Nah! - New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/17/magazine/advice-teen-angst-nah.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=April 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, several of his ''New York Press'' columns became the core of his first book, ''Teen Angst? Naaah....'' which is a [[memoir]] of his teenage years. It is a collection of short stories, most of which were originally published in ''The New York Press'' and ''The New York Times Magazine''. The book is broken down by years covering junior high through high school and beyond.&lt;ref name="About" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vizzini|first=Ned|title=Teen Angst? Naaah....|year=2002|publisher=Laurel Leaf|isbn=044023767X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vizzini attended [[Hunter College]], located in Manhattan.

In 2004 his first novel ''[[Be More Chill]]'' was published. A review for the ''[[New York Times Book Review]]'' said that ''Be More Chill'', which is about a high school student named Jeremy Heere who gets a supercomputer pill in his brain that makes him cool, "is so accurate that it should come with a warning."&lt;ref name="About" /&gt; Others have criticized the book for its language and lack of a clear moral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Goodreads {{!}} Be More Chill by Ned Vizzini - Reviews, Discussion, Bookclubs, Lists|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19476.Be_More_Chill#other_reviews|accessdate=April 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Be More Chill'' was later [[Be More Chill (musical)|adapted into a musical]] in summer 2015 with lyrics by [[Joe Iconis]] and premiered at New Jersey’s [[Two River Theatre]]. Three years later, an Off-Broadway production opened at the [[Signature Theater Company|Signature Theater]] in New York.

In 2006 Vizzini's second novel ''[[It's Kind of a Funny Story]]'' was published. It is based on his five-day stay in Brooklyn's [[New York Methodist Hospital|Methodist Hospital]] psychiatric ward. The book recounts fifteen-year-old Craig Gilner's battle with suicidal depression as a result of a taxing school year at Manhattan's Executive Pre-Professional High School that exacerbates his feeling of social inadequacy.&lt;ref name="About" /&gt;

In 2012 Vizzini's third novel ''The Other Normals'' was published. It is an "alternative fantasy"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Healy|first=Cat|title=The Other Normals « Beyond Books|url=http://beyondbooks.ca/?p=5494|accessdate=23 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120035530/http://beyondbooks.ca/?p=5494|archivedate=20 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; about a teenager who falls into a fantasy world that is the basis of his favorite [[role-playing game]].

With [[Nick Antosca]], Vizzini wrote two episodes of the 2012 season of MTV's supernatural drama ''[[Teen Wolf (2011 TV series)|Teen Wolf]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Teen Wolf" Restraint (TV episode 2012) - IMDb|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2337419/|accessdate=April 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, ''[[House of Secrets (2013 novel)|House of Secrets]]'', the first novel in a middle grade fantasy series by Vizzini and filmmaker [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]], was published. It debuted on the ''New York Times'' bestseller list, where it remained for four weeks. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the book an "A-" review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fowler|first=Tara|title=House of Secrets Review {{!}} Book Reviews and News|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20690038,00.html|accessdate=April 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His essays and criticism appeared in ''The New York Times'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vizzini|first=Ned|title=Children’s Books - The Cardturner - By Louis Sachar - NYTimes.com|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/16/books/review/Vizzini-t.html?_r=0|accessdate=April 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Los Angeles Review of Books|The Los Angeles Review of Books]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vizzini|first=Ned|title=Los Angeles Review of Books - A Grosser Power: A Contrarian Look At The Hunger Games|url=http://lareviewofbooks.org/article.php?type=&amp;id=626&amp;fulltext=1&amp;media=|accessdate=April 23, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130419032616/http://lareviewofbooks.org/article.php?type=&amp;id=626&amp;fulltext=1&amp;media=|archivedate=April 19, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vizzini|first=Ned|title="Game of Thrones" parenting lessons - Salon.com|url=http://www.salon.com/2012/03/30/game_of_thrones_parenting_lessons/singleton/|accessdate=April 23, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120805053251/http://www.salon.com/2012/03/30/game_of_thrones_parenting_lessons/singleton/|archivedate=August 5, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vizzini spoke at schools and libraries around the world about mental health, writing, and how students can use writing as a medicine for mental health. He spoke at [[UCLA]]; [[The Dalton School]]; the [[Brooklyn Public Library|Brooklyn]], [[New York Public Library|New York]], and [[Chicago Public Library|Chicago]] Public Libraries; [[Murray State University]]; [[NYU]]; [[The National Council of Teachers of English]]; and a Master's Tea at [[Yale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gotham-artists.com/ned_vizzini.html|title=How Not to Go Crazy in College|work=Gotham Artists|accessdate=February 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vizzini and Antosca were story editors on ABC's 2013 drama series ''[[Last Resort (U.S. TV series)|Last Resort]]''. They are the credited writers of the episode "Nuke It Out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Last Resort" Nuke It Out (TV episode 2012)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2473720/|accessdate=April 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2006 to 2012 Vizzini facilitated a [[writing workshop]] for local [[teenager]]s. The workshops were held monthly in a [[Park Slope]] [[Barnes &amp; Noble]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Teen Writing Workshop with Author Ned Vizzini|url=http://parkslope.patch.com/groups/schools/p/ev--teen-writing-workshop-with-author-ned-vizzini|publisher=Park Slope Patch|accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The teens who attended had the chance to have their work published on the group's blog, "Give Us Money."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Teen Writing Workshop with Author Ned Vizzini - Barnes &amp; Noble Park Slope|url=http://www.nymetroparents.com/brooklyn/2013neweventinfo.cfm?id=53748|publisher=Brooklyn parent|accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Vizzini, who often spoke and wrote about his struggles with severe clinical depression, died by suicide on December 19, 2013 in Brooklyn, New York, at the age of 32.&lt;ref name="lat"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kellogg|first=Carolyn|title=Writer Ned Vizzini has died at 32|url=http://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-et-jc-writer-ned-vizzini-has-died-20131220,0,6354622.story#axzz2o2TauLCt|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New York City chief medical examiner's office said he suffered blunt impact injuries.

'''Pitu Guli''' ({{Cyrl|Питу Гули}}; 1865&amp;ndash;1903) was an [[Aromanians|Aromanian]] revolutionary in [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], a local leader of what is commonly referred to as the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] (IMRO).&lt;ref&gt;Brown, K. (2003) ''The Past in Question: Modern Macedonia and the Uncertainties of Nation'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press) {{ISBN|0-691-09995-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

Born to a poor family in [[Krusevo|Kruševo]], he demonstrated an independent and rebellious nature early in life. He left his home in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] at the age of 17 in search of wealth in the [[Bulgaria]]n capital, [[Sofia]]. In 1885, he returned to Macedonia, as part of a rebel squad of the revolutionary movement against the [[Ottoman Empire]], led by Adam Kalmikov. He was captured and exiled to eastern Anatolia for a period of eight years, seven years of which were spent in the prison in [[Trabzon]]. In 1895, he again returned to Kruševo and became a member of IMARO. From this time on, he was fully committed to the independence of Macedonia from Turkish rule. Between 1897 and 1902 he was again in Sofia, where he also held an eating house. 

[[File:BASA 114K-1-26 Pitu Guli,1903.jpg|left|thumb|Pitu Guli and his squad in 1903. Source: Bulgarian Archives State Agency]]
In March 1903, he began commanding a revolutionary squad, crossing the Bulgarian-Ottoman border heading for [[Kruševo]]. From April to August 1903, he trained and prepared his irregulars for the upcoming [[Ilinden-Preobrazhenie Uprising|Ilinden Uprising]]. He died in Krusevo, defending the [[Krusevo Republic]].

==Legacy==

Following the revolt, Romania, with the support of Austro-Hungary, succeeded in the acceptance of Vlachs as a separate [[millet]] with the decree ([[Irade-i senniye|irade]]) of May 22, 1905 by Sultan Abdulhamid, so the "Ullah millet" ([[Vlach Millet|the millet of the Vlachs]]) could have their own churches and schools&lt;ref&gt;Thede Kahl, Ethnologia Balkanica, Vol. 6 (2002), p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Pitu Guli and his family were [[Bulgarophiles]].&lt;ref&gt;Коста Църнушанов, Македонизмът и съпротивата на Македония срещу него, Университетско изд. "Св. Климент Охридски", София, 1992, стр. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Тодор Балкански, Даниела Андрей, Големите власи сред българите, Знак 94, {{ISBN|9548709082}}, 1996, стр. 60-70.&lt;/ref&gt; Except for 
[[Bulgarian Exarchate|Exarchist]] Vlachs,&lt;ref&gt;''Aromanian consciousness was not developed until the late 19th century, and was influenced by the rise of Romanian national movement. As result, wealthy, urbanized Ottoman Vlachs were culturally hellenised during 17-19th century and some of them bulgarized during the late 19th and early 20th. century.'' Raymond Detrez, 2014, Historical Dictionary of Bulgaria, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, {{ISBN|1442241802}}, p. 520.&lt;/ref&gt; most members of other ethnicities dismissed the IMRO as pro-Bulgarian.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Rossos, Macedonia and the Macedonians: A History, Hoover Press, 2013, {{ISBN|081794883X}},p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philip Jowett, Armies of the Balkan Wars 1912–13: The priming charge for the Great War, Bloomsbury Publishing, 2012, {{ISBN|184908419X}}, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; He is father of Tashko Gulev (Shula Guli), who died in 1913 as soldier of the Bulgarian army in the [[battle of Bregalnica]] against the Serbs, during the [[Second Balkan War]].&lt;ref&gt;Македоно-одринското опълчение 1912-1913 г. Личен състав, Главно управление на архивите, 2006, стр. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; He is also father of the revolutionary of the IMRO, Nikola Gulev (Lakia Guli), one of the people closest to [[Todor Alexandrov]]. He was captured and killed by the Serbian police in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Македонска енциклопедија, МАНУ, Скопје, 2009, стр. 415-416.&lt;/ref&gt; Pitu Guli is a father of Steryo Gulev (Sterya Guli), who took part in the military units formed by the Bulgarian authorities in Vardar Macedonia during World War II to fight the communist [[Yugoslav partisans]]. He reportedly shot himself after Bulgarian withdrawal from Macedonia in 1944, upon the arrival of [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]]'s partisans in Kruševo, in despair over what he saw as a second period of Serbian dominance in Macedonia.&lt;ref&gt;Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Macedonia, Dimitar Bechev, Scarecrow Press, 2009, {{ISBN|0810862956}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ilGfCIF4Ao4C&amp;pg=PA91&amp;lpg=PA91&amp;dq=guli+macedonia+bechev&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VvLWIPeVlY&amp;sig=bPj_zZijSTmHvg5R9ELQivaiFls&amp;hl=bg&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=m10kU_q5E-T9ygP6lYLoAQ&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 91.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pitu Guli is a national hero in the Republic of Macedonia and Bulgaria, and remembered as having fought heroically at [[Mečkin Kamen]] (''Bear's Rock'') near Kruševo, where he was killed during the Ilinden Uprising in defense of the Macedonian [[Kruševo Republic]]. A [[Macedonian Partisans|Macedonian Partisan]] Brigade was named after him. He is also celebrated in folk songs and poetry throughout the region of Macedonia, being mentioned in the [[national anthem]] of the [[Republic of Macedonia]] (''[[Today over Macedonia]]'').

'''Robert Maynard Pirsig''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɜːr|s|ɪ|ɡ}}; September 6, 1928&amp;nbsp;– April 24, 2017) was an American writer and [[philosopher]]. He was the author of the philosophical novels ''[[Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance|Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance: An Inquiry into Values]]'' (1974) and ''[[Lila: An Inquiry into Morals]]'' (1991).&lt;ref name="AP_death " /&gt;

==Early life==
Pirsig was born on September 6, 1928, in [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]],&lt;ref name="Gale"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| title= Robert M(aynard) Pirsig| work= Contemporary Popular Writers| editor-first= Dave |editor-last= Mote| place= Detroit| publisher= St. James Press| year= 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the son of Harriet Marie Sjobeck and [[Maynard Pirsig]]. He was of [[Germans|German]] and [[Swedes|Swedish]] descent.&lt;ref name="ASAW" /&gt; His father was a [[University of Minnesota Law School]] (UMLS) graduate who started teaching at the school in 1934. The elder Pirsig served as the law school dean from 1948 to 1955, and retired from teaching at UMLS in 1970.&lt;ref name= "Tribute to Dean"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.moq.org/links/LinkData/DeanPirsigTribute.html |title= A Tribute to Dean Pirsig| publisher= [[University of Minnesota Law School]]| via= MOQ.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; He resumed his career as a professor at the [[William Mitchell College of Law]], where he remained until his final retirement in 1993.&lt;ref name="Tribute to Dean" /&gt;

A precocious child with an [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] of 170 at age nine, Pirsig skipped several grades and was enrolled at the [[Blake School (Minneapolis)|Blake School]] in Minneapolis.&lt;ref name="ASAW"&gt;{{cite web | title = Robert M. Pirsig | work = It Happened in History | publisher = American Society of Authors and Writers | url = http://amsaw.org/amsaw-ithappenedinhistory-090604-pirsig.html  | access-date = February 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/nov/19/fiction|title=The interview: Robert Pirsig| first= Tim| last= Adams|date=November 18, 2006|publisher=''The Guardian''}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At 14, in May 1943, Pirsig was awarded a high school diploma from the University of Minnesota's laboratory school, University High School (now [[Marshall-University High School]]) where he edited the school yearbook, the Bisbilla. He then entered the [[University of Minnesota]] to study [[biochemistry]] that autumn. In ''Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance'', he described the central character, thought to represent himself,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/25/robert-pirsig-zen-and-the-art-of-motorcycle-maintenance-author-dies-aged-88|title= Robert Pirsig: Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance author dies aged 88|first=|last=|date=April 24, 2017| work= The Guardian |access-date= April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as being far from a typical student; he was interested in science as a goal in itself, rather than as a way to establish a career.

While doing laboratory work in [[biochemistry]], Pirsig became greatly troubled by the existence of more than one workable [[hypothesis]] to explain a given phenomenon, and that the number of hypotheses appeared unlimited. He could not find any way to reduce the number of hypotheses—he became perplexed by the role and source of hypothesis generation within scientific practice. The question distracted him to the extent that he lost interest in his studies and failed to maintain good grades. Finally, he was expelled from the university.&lt;ref name="vitello"/&gt;

In 1946, aged eighteen, Pirsig enlisted in the [[United States Army]]. He was stationed in [[South Korea]] until 1948. Upon his discharge from the Army, he returned to the United States and lived in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], for less than a year, at which point he decided to finish the education he had abandoned. Pirsig earned a bachelor's degree in 1950 from the University of Minnesota.&lt;ref name= "Learning2015"&gt;{{cite book|title= A Study Guide for Robert Pirsig's "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance"| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=o2MODAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT5|date=March 13, 2015|publisher=Gale, Cengage Learning| isbn= 978-1-4103-2079-7| pages= 5–}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then attended [[Banaras Hindu University]] in India, to study [[Eastern philosophy]] and culture. At the [[University of Chicago]], he performed graduate-level work in philosophy and journalism but he did not obtain a degree there. In 1958 he earned a master's degree in journalism from the University of Minnesota.&lt;ref name="vitello"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/24/books/robert-pirsig-dead-wrote-zen-and-the-art-of-motorcycle-maintenance.html|title=Robert M.

==Career==
In 1958, he became a professor at [[Montana State University]] in [[Bozeman, Montana|Bozeman]], and taught creative writing courses for two years. Shortly thereafter he taught at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]].&lt;ref name="NY Post AP dies" /&gt;

Pirsig's published writing consists most notably of two books. The better known, ''[[Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance]]'', develops around Pirsig's exploration into the nature of ''[[quality_(philosophy)|quality]]''. Ostensibly a [[first-person narrative]] based on a motorcycle trip he and his young son Chris had taken from [[Minneapolis]] to [[San Francisco]], it is an exploration of the underlying [[metaphysics]] of [[Western culture]]. He also gives the reader a short summary of the [[history of philosophy]], including his interpretation of the philosophy of [[Socrates]] as part of an ongoing dispute between ''[[Universality_(philosophy)|universalists]]'', admitting the existence of ''[[universals]]'', and the [[Sophism|Sophists]], opposed by Socrates and his student [[Plato]]. Pirsig finds in "Quality" a special significance and common ground between Western and Eastern world views.&lt;ref name="AP_death" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/04/25/525516740/author-robert-pirsig-dies-at-88-motorcycle-trip-inspired-popular-zen-book|title=Robert Pirsig Dies At 88; Motorcycle Trip Inspired Popular 'Zen' Book| website= [[NPR]].org| access-date= April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pirsig had great difficulty finding a publisher for ''[[Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance]]''. When he did, his publisher's internal recommendation stated, "This book is brilliant beyond belief, it is probably a work of genius, and will, I'll wager, attain classic stature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Richardson| first= Mark| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=CFh5lBV_C_sC&amp;pg=PA194#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title= Zen and Now| publisher= Random House Digital, Inc. |date= September 9, 2008| page= 194}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his [[book review]], [[George Steiner]] compared Pirsig's writing to [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky|Dostoevsky]], [[Hermann Broch|Broch]], [[Marcel Proust|Proust]], and [[Henri Bergson|Bergson]], stating that "the assertion itself is valid&amp;nbsp;... the analogies with ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' are patent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first= George| last= Steiner| authorlink= George Steiner| url= http://www.mrbauld.com/steiner.html| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20030428213201/http://www.mrbauld.com/steiner.html| dead-url= yes| archive-date= April 28, 2003| title= Uneasy Rider| work= [[The New Yorker]]| date= April 15, 1974| publisher= Published online at ''mrbauld.com''| pages= 147–150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, Pirsig was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] to allow him to write a follow-up, ''[[Lila: An Inquiry into Morals]]'' (1991), in which he developed a value-based [[metaphysics]], [[Pirsig's Metaphysics of Quality|Metaphysics of Quality]], that challenges our subject–object view of reality. The second book, this time "the captain" of a sailboat, follows on from where ''Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance'' left off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4612367 | title=Robert Pirsig Discusses 'Lila: An Inquiry into Morals' | date=April 21, 2005 | access-date=April 26, 2017 | publisher=[[NPR|National Public Radio]] |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/14/books/books-of-the-times-novelist-continues-a-philosophical-voyage.html|title=Books of The Times; Novelist Continues A Philosophical Voyage|date=October 14, 1991|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pirsig was vice-president of the [[Minnesota Zen Meditation Center]] from 1973 to 1975 and also served on the board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;"Pirsig, Robert M(aynard) (1928–)" (2005). In T. Matthews &amp; T. Watson (eds.), ''Major 21st-Century Writers'' (Vol. 4). Gale Virtual Reference Library. Detroit: Gale.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Robert Pirsig married Nancy Ann James on May 10, 1954. They had two sons: Chris, born in 1956, and Theodore (Ted), born in 1958.&lt;ref name="NY Post AP dies"/&gt;

Pirsig suffered a [[mental breakdown]] and spent time in and out of psychiatric hospitals between 1961 and 1963. He was diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]] and treated with [[electroconvulsive therapy]] on numerous occasions,&lt;ref name="vitello"/&gt; a treatment he discusses in ''Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance''. Nancy sought a divorce during this time;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/nov/19/fiction|title=The interview: Robert Pirsig| last= Adams| first= Tim|date=November 18, 2006|work=The Guardian|access-date=April 25, 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; they formally separated in 1976 and divorced in 1978.&lt;ref name="NY Post AP dies" /&gt; On December 28, 1978, Pirsig married Wendy Kimball in [[Tremont, Maine]].

In 1979, his son Chris, who figured prominently in ''Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance'', was fatally stabbed in a mugging outside the [[San Francisco Zen Center]] at the age of 22.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/20/archives/100-zen-students-keeping-vigil-over-body-of-man-slain-in-street.html |title= 100 Zen Students Keeping Vigil Over Body of Man Slain in Street|last=|first=|date= November 20, 1979 |work= The New York Times |access-date= April 26, 2017 |location= San Francisco |agency= Associated Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pirsig discusses this tragedy in an afterword to subsequent editions of ''Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance'', writing that he and his second wife Wendy Kimball decided not to abort the child they conceived in 1980 because he believed that this unborn child&amp;nbsp;— later their daughter Nell&amp;nbsp;— was a continuation of the "life pattern" that Chris had occupied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first= Robert| last= Pirsig| chapter= Afterword |title= Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance| location= New York| publisher= Bantam Books| year= 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pirsig died aged 88, at his home in [[South Berwick, Maine]], on April 24, 2017, after a period of failing health.&lt;ref name="AP_death" /&gt;

==Recognition==
Pirsig received a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 1974 for General Nonfiction,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.gf.org/fellows/all-fellows/robert-pirsig/ |title=Robert Pirsig |website=Guggenheim Fellowship |access-date=August 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an Outstanding Achievement Award conferred by the [[University of Minnesota]] in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://uawards.umn.edu/outstanding-achievement-award/recipients-outstanding-achievement-award |title=Recipients of the Outstanding Achievement Award |website=University of Minnesota |access-date=August 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 15, 2012, [[Montana State University]] bestowed upon Pirsig an [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] in philosophy during the university's fall commencement. Pirsig was also honored with a commencement speech by MSU Regent Professor Michael Sexson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lists.moqtalk.org/pipermail/moq_discuss-moqtalk.org/2012-December/069040.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130625204309/http://lists.moqtalk.org/pipermail/moq_discuss-moqtalk.org/2012-December/069040.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 25, 2013 |title=[MD&amp;#93; Pirsig's Honorary Doctorate |website=moqtalk.org |date= |access-date=July 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.montana.edu/cpa/news/nwview.php?article=11608 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130403082838/http://www.montana.edu/cpa/news/nwview.php?article=11608 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 3, 2013 |title=MSU to award honorary doctorate to philosopher Robert Pirsig at December commencement |website=montana.edu |publisher=Montana State University |date=November 16, 2012 |access-date=July 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pirsig had been an instructor in writing at what was then Montana State College from 1958–1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/news/montana_state_university/article_52ea42ba-3147-11e2-9b66-0019bb2963f4.html |title= MSU to award honorary doctorate to philosopher Robert Pirsig |work= [[Bozeman Daily Chronicle]] |date=November 18, 2012 |access-date=July 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance'', Pirsig writes about his time at MSC as a less than pleasurable experience that this limited his ability to teach writing effectively, as well as to develop his own philosophies and literature. Due to frailty of health, Pirsig did not travel to Bozeman in December 2012 to accept the accolade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.montana.edu/news/11608/msu-to-award-honorary-doctorate-to-philosopher-robert-pirsig-at-december-commencement|title=MSU to award honorary doctorate to philosopher Robert Pirsig at December commencement|website= montana.edu| publisher= Montana State University|access-date=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NY Post AP dies"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://nypost.com/2017/04/25/author-robert-pirsig-dies-at-88/| title= Author Robert Pirsig dies at 88| agency= Associated Press|date=April 25, 2017| work= [[New York Post]] |access-date=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2352">'''Sallie''' or '''Salomon Kok''', was an [[Antwerp]] diamond dealer from the 20th century, of Jewish-[[Dutch (ethnic group)|Dutch]] descent, who played a role in the [[Flemish Movement]].

Politically, he was rather to the left. Kok became an important investor to the [[Flamenpolitik|Flemish activists]]. Activist publications were financed by him.&lt;ref name="Secessie"&gt;[[Paul Beliën]], [http://www.secessie.nu/pdf/7-3.pdf  ''Een mythe doorprikt: Vlaanderen als bakermat van racisme en antisemitisme''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724191047/http://www.secessie.nu/pdf/7-3.pdf |date=24 July 2011 }} (''A Myth renounced. Flanders as the cradle of racism and anti-Semitism''), in ''Secessie, Kwartaalblad voor de Studie van Separatisme en Directe Democratie'' (''Secession, quarterly for the Study of Separatism and Direct Democracy), April–May–June 2002, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="P.Belien158"&gt;Paul Beliën, ''A Throne in Brussels. Britain, the Saxe-Coburgs and the Belgianisation of Europe'', imprint-academic.com, 2005, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;
Not only he supported Leo Picard’s ''Vlaamsche Post'', spokesman for the radical activists, but in 1917 he was also one of the sponsors of a delegation of socialist activists to the international socialist peace conference in [[Stockholm]]. Like [[Marten Rudelsheim]], he was involved in the [[Antwerp]] section of ''Volksopbeuring'' (popular relief, 1915), which supported impoverished [[Flemings]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ok-o6daGPDYC&amp;pg=PA770&amp;lpg=PA770&amp;dq=%22Bernard+Tokkie%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=862GQfvChy&amp;sig=PHkAMIcLbkuWf-xGcIzVeUinFnU&amp;hl=nl&amp;ei=g3sESuGpB826jAfHvqS7Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4#PPA88,M1, Lieven Saerens , ''Vreemdelingen in een wereldstad: een geschiedenis van Antwerpen en zijn joodse bevolking (1880-1944)''] (''Strangers in a metropolis: a history of Antwerp and its Jewish population (1880-1944))'',  Ed. Lannoo, 2000, {{ISBN|90-209-4109-7}}, {{ISBN|978-90-209-4109-8}}, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; Kok fought for [[Flanders]] as well as for a [[Sionism|Jewish state]].

Ramanujan initially developed his own mathematical research in isolation: "He tried to interest the leading professional mathematicians in his work, but failed for the most part. What he had to show them was too novel, too unfamiliar, and additionally presented in unusual ways; they could not be bothered".&lt;ref&gt;Hans Eysenck (1995). ''Genius,'' p. 197. Cambridge University Press, ISBN 0-521-48508-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Seeking mathematicians who could better understand his work, in 1913 he began a [[postal service|postal]] partnership with the English mathematician [[G. H. Hardy]] at the [[University of Cambridge]], [[England]]. Recognizing the extraordinary work sent to him as samples, Hardy arranged travel for Ramanujan to Cambridge. In his notes, Ramanujan had produced groundbreaking new [[theorem]]s, including some that Hardy stated had "defeated [him and his colleagues] completely", in addition to rediscovering recently proven but highly advanced results.

During his short life, Ramanujan independently compiled nearly 3,900 results (mostly [[identity (mathematics)|identities]] and [[equation]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z__xZ9pNkZMC|title=Ramanujan's Notebooks, Part 5|last=Berndt|first=Bruce C.|date=12 December 1997|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year=|isbn=9780387949413|location=|pages=4|language=en|via=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180303143513/https://books.google.com/books?id=Z__xZ9pNkZMC|archivedate=3 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many were completely novel; his original and highly unconventional results, such as the [[Ramanujan prime]], the [[Ramanujan theta function]], [[partition (number theory)|partition]] formulae and [[mock theta function]]s, have opened entire new areas of work and inspired a vast amount of further research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ono |first=Ken |authorlink=Ken Ono |date=June–July 2006 |title=Honoring a Gift from Kumbakonam |journal=[[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]] |volume=53 |issue=6 |page=650 |url=https://www.ams.org/notices/200606/fea-ono.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=23 June 2007 |publisher=Mathematical Association of America |ref=harv |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621074858/https://www.ams.org/notices/200606/fea-ono.pdf |archivedate=21 June 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly all his claims have now been proven correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |date=August 1999 |title=Rediscovering Ramanujan |journal=[[Frontline (magazine)|Frontline]] |volume=16 |issue=17 |page=650 |url=https://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1617/16170810.htm |accessdate=20 December 2012 |ref=harv |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925201456/http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1617/16170810.htm |archivedate=25 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Ramanujan Journal]]'', a [[peer-reviewed]] [[scientific journal]], was established to publish work in all areas of mathematics influenced by Ramanujan,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ode6xrA2IcYC|title=Analytic and Elementary Number Theory: A Tribute to Mathematical Legend Paul Erdos|last=Alladi|first=Krishnaswami|last2=Elliott|first2=P.

As late as 2011 and again in 2012, researchers continued to discover that mere comments in his writings about "simple properties" and "similar outputs" for certain findings were themselves profound and subtle number theory results that remained unsuspected until nearly a century after his death.&lt;ref name="ono_simpleproperties"&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20039-deep-meaning-in-ramanujans-simple-pattern/ Deep meaning in Ramanujan’s ‘simple’ pattern] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803140127/https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20039-deep-meaning-in-ramanujans-simple-pattern/ |date=3 August 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ono_mock"&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21628904-200-mathematical-proof-reveals-magic-of-ramanujans-genius/ "Mathematical proof reveals magic of Ramanujan’s genius"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170709084351/https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21628904-200-mathematical-proof-reveals-magic-of-ramanujans-genius/ |date=9 July 2017 }}. ''[[New Scientist]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; He became one of the youngest [[Fellow of the Royal Society|Fellows of the Royal Society]] and only the second Indian member, and the first Indian to be elected a [[Trinity College, Cambridge#Notable fellows and alumni|Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge]]. Of his original letters, Hardy stated that a single look was enough to show they could only have been written by a mathematician of the highest calibre, comparing Ramanujan to other mathematical geniuses such as [[Euler]] and [[Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi|Jacobi]].

In 1919, ill health – now believed to have been hepatic [[amoebiasis]] (a complication from episodes of [[dysentery]] many years previously) – compelled Ramanujan's return to India, where he died in 1920 at the age of 32. His last letters to Hardy, written January 1920, show that he was still continuing to produce new mathematical ideas and theorems. His "[[Ramanujan's lost notebook|lost notebook]]", containing discoveries from the last year of his life, caused great excitement among mathematicians when it was rediscovered in 1976.

Ramanujan (literally, "younger brother of Rama", a Hindu deity&lt;ref name="Kanigel1991"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kanigel |first=Robert |title=The Man Who Knew Infinity: a Life of the Genius Ramanujan |location=New York |publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons |year=1991 |isbn=0-684-19259-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|12}}) was born on 22 December 1887 into a [[Tamil Brahmin]] [[Iyengar]] family in [[Erode]], [[Madras Presidency]] (now [[Tamil Nadu]]), at the residence of his maternal grandparents.&lt;ref name="Kanigel1991" /&gt;{{rp|11}} His father, K. Srinivasa Iyengar, originally from [[Thanjavur district]], worked as a clerk in a sari shop.&lt;ref name="Kanigel1991" /&gt;{{rp|17–18}} His mother, Komalatammal, was a [[housewife]] and also sang at a local temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Berndt|Rankin|2001|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; They lived in a small traditional home on Sarangapani Sannidhi Street in the town of [[Kumbakonam]].&lt;ref name="hindu"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Srinivasan|first1=Pankaja|title=The Nostalgia Formula|url=https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/history-and-culture/the-nostalgia-formula/article4013282.ece|accessdate=7 September 2016|publisher=The Hindu|date=19 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family home is now a museum. When Ramanujan was a year and a half old, his mother gave birth to a son, Sadagopan, who died less than three months later. In December 1889, Ramanujan contracted [[smallpox]], though he recovered, unlike 4,000 others who would die in a bad year in the Thanjavur district around this time. He moved with his mother to her parents' house in [[Kanchipuram]], near Madras (now [[Chennai]]). His mother gave birth to two more children, in 1891 and 1894, both failing to reach their first birthdays.&lt;ref name="Kanigel1991" /&gt;{{rp|12}}

On 1 October 1892, Ramanujan was enrolled at the local school.&lt;ref name="Kanigel1991" /&gt;{{rp|13}} After his maternal grandfather lost his job as a court official in Kanchipuram,&lt;ref name="Kanigel1991" /&gt;{{rp|19}} Ramanujan and his mother moved back to Kumbakonam and he was enrolled in the Kangayan Primary School.&lt;ref name="Kanigel1991" /&gt;{{rp|14}} When his paternal grandfather died, he was sent back to his maternal grandparents, then living in Madras. He did not like school in Madras, and tried to avoid attending. His family enlisted a local constable to make sure the boy attended school. Within six months, Ramanujan was back in Kumbakonam.&lt;ref name="Kanigel1991" /&gt;{{rp|14}}

Since Ramanujan's father was at work most of the day, his mother took care of the boy as a child. He had a close relationship with her. From her, he learned about tradition and [[puranas]]. He learned to sing religious songs, to attend [[Puja (Hinduism)|pujas]] at the temple, and to maintain particular eating habits – all of which are part of [[Brahmin]] culture.&lt;ref name="Kanigel1991" /&gt;{{rp|20}} At the Kangayan Primary School, Ramanujan performed well. Just before turning 10, in November 1897, he passed his primary examinations in English, [[Tamil language|Tamil]], geography and arithmetic with the best scores in the district.&lt;ref name="Kanigel1991" /&gt;{{rp|25}} That year, Ramanujan entered [[Town Higher Secondary School]], where he encountered formal mathematics for the first time.&lt;ref name="Kanigel1991" /&gt;{{rp|25}}

By age 11, he had exhausted the mathematical knowledge of two college students who were lodgers at his home. He was later lent a book by [[S. L. Loney]] on advanced trigonometry.&lt;ref name="berndt9"&gt;{{Harvnb|Berndt|Rankin|2001|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Hardy | first=G.

H. Hardy]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; He mastered this by the age of 13 while discovering sophisticated theorems on his own. By 14, he was receiving merit certificates and academic awards that continued throughout his school career, and he assisted the school in the logistics of assigning its 1200 students (each with differing needs) to its approximately 35 teachers.&lt;ref name="Kanigel1991" /&gt;{{rp|27}} He completed mathematical exams in half the allotted time, and showed a familiarity with [[geometry]] and [[infinite series]]. Ramanujan was shown how to solve cubic equations in 1902; he developed his own method to solve the [[Quartic function|quartic]]. The following year, Ramanujan tried to solve the [[Quintic function|quintic]], not knowing that it [[Abel–Ruffini theorem|could not be solved by radicals.]]

In 1903, when he was 16, Ramanujan obtained from a friend a library copy of ''[[Synopsis of Pure Mathematics|A Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure and Applied Mathematics]]'', [[G. S. Carr]]'s collection of 5,000 theorems.&lt;ref name="Kanigel1991" /&gt;{{rp|39}}&lt;ref&gt;''A to Z of mathematicians'' by Tucker McElroy 2005 {{isbn|0-8160-5338-3-}}page 221&lt;/ref&gt; Ramanujan reportedly studied the contents of the book in detail.&lt;ref name= papers/&gt; The book is generally acknowledged as a key element in awakening his genius.&lt;ref name=papers&gt;{{citation | title= Collected papers of Srinivasa Ramanujan | journal=Nature | volume=123 | issue=3104 | first1=Srinivasa | last1=Ramanujan Aiyangar | first2= Godfrey Harold | last2= Hardy | first3= P.

When he graduated from Town Higher Secondary School in 1904, Ramanujan was awarded the K. Ranganatha Rao prize for mathematics by the school's headmaster, Krishnaswami Iyer. Iyer introduced Ramanujan as an outstanding student who deserved scores higher than the maximum.&lt;ref name="Kanigel1991" /&gt; He received a scholarship to study at [[Government Arts College, Kumbakonam]],&lt;ref name="Kanigel1991" /&gt;{{rp|28}}&lt;ref name="Kanigel1991" /&gt;{{rp|45}} but was so intent on mathematics that he could not focus on any other subjects and failed most of them, losing his scholarship in the process.&lt;ref name="Kanigel1991" /&gt;{{rp|47}} In August 1905, Ramanujan ran away from home, heading towards [[Visakhapatnam]], and stayed in [[Rajahmundry]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.thehindu.com/arts/history-and-culture/ramanujan-lost-and-found-a-1905-letter-from-the-hindu/article2745164.ece | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Ramanujan lost and found: a 1905 letter from ''The Hindu'' | date=25 December 2011 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; for about a month.&lt;ref name="Kanigel1991" /&gt;{{rp|47–48}} He later enrolled at [[Pachaiyappa's College]] in Madras.

Without a FA degree, he left college and continued to pursue independent research in mathematics, living in extreme poverty and often on the brink of starvation.&lt;ref name="Kanigel1991" /&gt;{{rp|55–56}}

It was in 1910, after a meeting between the 23-year-old Ramanujan and the founder of the [[Indian Mathematical Society]], [[V. Ramaswamy Aiyer]], also known as Professor Ramaswami, that Ramanujan started to get recognition within the mathematics circles of Madras, subsequently leading to his inclusion as a researcher at the [[University of Madras]].&lt;ref name="krish"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Krishnamurthy|first1=Prof. V.|title=Srinivasa Ramanujan – His life and his genius|url=https://www.krishnamurthys.com/profvk/VK2/Srinivasa_Ramanujan.html|website=www.krishnamurthys.com|publisher=(Expository address delivered on Sep.16, 1987 at Visvesvarayya Auditorium as part of the celebrations of Ramanujan Centenary by the IISC, Bangalore)|accessdate=7 September 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921182431/https://www.krishnamurthys.com/profvk/VK2/Srinivasa_Ramanujan.html|archivedate=21 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adulthood in India==
On 14 July 1909, Ramanujan married Janaki (Janakiammal) (21 March 1899 – 13 April 1994), a girl whom his mother had selected for him a year earlier and who was ten years old when they married.&lt;ref name="History in adult human sexual behavior with children and adolescents in Western societies"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bullough|first1=V.L.|title=History in adult human sexual behavior with children and adolescents in Western societies|date=1990|publisher=Springer-Verlag New York Inc|isbn=9781461396840|pages=71|edition=Pedophilia: Biosocial Dimensions|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nnKEBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA69|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kolata|1987|p=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kanigel1991" /&gt;{{rp|71}} It was not unusual for marriages to be arranged with girls. She came from Rajendram, a village close to Marudur ([[Karur district]]) Railway Station. Ramanujan's father did not participate in the marriage ceremony.&lt;ref name="Janaki"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ramanujan's wife: Janakiammal (Janaki)|url=https://www.imsc.res.in/~rao/ramanujan/newnow/janaki.pdf|publisher=Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai|accessdate=10 November 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121224003120/https://www.imsc.res.in/~rao/ramanujan/newnow/janaki.pdf|archivedate=24 December 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As was common at that time, Janakiammal continued to stay at her maternal home for three years after marriage till she attained puberty. In 1912, she and Ramanujan's mother joined Ramanujan in Madras.&lt;ref name="express"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Janardhanan|first1=Arun|title=A passage to infinity|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/life-style/a-passage-to-infinity-the-untold-story-of-srinivasa-ramanujan/|accessdate=7 September 2016|publisher=Indian Express|date=6 December 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160905150332/https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/life-style/a-passage-to-infinity-the-untold-story-of-srinivasa-ramanujan/|archivedate=5 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the marriage, Ramanujan developed a [[hydrocele testis]].&lt;ref name="Kanigel1991" /&gt;{{rp|72}} The condition could be treated with a routine surgical operation that would release the blocked fluid in the scrotal sac, but his family did not have the money for the operation. In January 1910, a doctor volunteered to do the surgery at no cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ramanujan|first=Srinivasa|editor = P. K. Srinivasan |title= Ramanujan Memorial Number: Letters and Reminiscences |year= 1968|publisher= Muthialpet High School |location=Madras|isbn= | pages=Vol. 1, p100 |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his successful surgery, Ramanujan searched for a job. He stayed at a friend's house while he went from door to door around Madras looking for a clerical position. To make money, he tutored students at Presidency College who were preparing for their F.A. exam.&lt;ref name="Kanigel1991" /&gt;{{rp|73}}

In late 1910, Ramanujan was sick again. He feared for his health, and told his friend R. Radakrishna Iyer to "hand [his notebooks] over to Professor Singaravelu Mudaliar [the mathematics professor at Pachaiyappa's College] or to the British professor Edward B. Ross, of the [[Madras Christian College]]."&lt;ref name="Kanigel1991" /&gt;{{rp|74–75}} After Ramanujan recovered and retrieved his notebooks from Iyer, he took a train from Kumbakonam to [[Viluppuram (city)|Villupuram]], a city under French control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Ranganathan |first=Shiyali Ramamrita |authorlink=Shiyali Ramamrita Ranganathan |title=Ramanujan: The Man and the Mathematician |year=1967 |publisher=Asia Publishing House |location=Bombay |isbn= |ref=harv |url=https://books.google.com/?id=OuTuAAAAMAAJ }}, p.&amp;nbsp;23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Srinivasan (1968), Vol. 1, p99.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912, Ramanujan moved to a house in Saiva Muthaiah Mudali street, [[George Town, Chennai|George Town]], [[Madras]] with his wife and mother where they lived for a few months.&lt;ref name="rao"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rao|title=Ramanujan's wife Janakiammal (Janaki)|url=https://www.imsc.res.in/~rao/ramanujan/newnow/janaki.pdf|website=IMSC|publisher=Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai|accessdate=7 September 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110132908/https://www.imsc.res.in/~rao/ramanujan/newnow/janaki.pdf|archivedate=10 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In May 1913, upon securing a research position at Madras University, Ramanujan moved with his family to [[Triplicane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Ramanujan|url=https://ramanujaninstitute.com/about.html|website=|publisher=The Ramanujan Institute|accessdate=7 September 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006210739/https://ramanujaninstitute.com/about.html|archivedate=6 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pursuit of career in mathematics===
Ramanujan met deputy collector [[V. Ramaswamy Aiyer]], who had founded the Indian Mathematical Society.&lt;ref name="Kanigel1991" /&gt;{{rp|77}} Wishing for a job at the revenue department where Aiyer worked, Ramanujan showed him his mathematics notebooks. As Aiyer later recalled:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I was struck by the extraordinary mathematical results contained in [the notebooks]. I had no mind to smother his genius by an appointment in the lowest rungs of the revenue department.&lt;ref&gt;Srinivasan (1968), Vol. 1, p129.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Aiyer sent Ramanujan, with letters of introduction, to his mathematician friends in Madras.&lt;ref name="Kanigel1991" /&gt;{{rp|77}} Some of them looked at his work and gave him letters of introduction to [[R. Ramachandra Rao]], the district collector for [[Nellore]] and the secretary of the Indian Mathematical Society.&lt;ref&gt;Srinivasan (1968), Vol. 1, p86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Neville |first=Eric Harold |date=January 1921 |title=The Late Srinivasa Ramanujan |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume=106 |issue=2673 |pages=661–662 |doi=10.1038/106661b0 |bibcode = 1921Natur.106..661N|ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranganathan|1967|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rao was impressed by Ramanujan's research but doubted that it was his own work. Ramanujan mentioned a correspondence he had with Professor Saldhana, a notable [[Mumbai|Bombay]] mathematician, in which Saldhana expressed a lack of understanding of his work but concluded that he was not a phony.&lt;ref name="Kanigel1991" /&gt;{{rp|80}} Ramanujan's friend C. V. Rajagopalachari tried to quell Rao's doubts about Ramanujan's academic integrity. Rao agreed to give him another chance, and listened as Ramanujan discussed [[elliptic integral]]s, [[Gaussian hypergeometric series|hypergeometric series]], and his theory of [[divergent series]], which Rao said ultimately converted him to a belief in Ramanujan's brilliance.&lt;ref name="Kanigel1991" /&gt;{{rp|80}} When Rao asked him what he wanted, Ramanujan replied that he needed work and financial support. Rao consented and sent him to Madras. He continued his research, with Rao's financial aid taking care of his daily needs. With Aiyer's help, Ramanujan had his work published in the ''Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society.''&lt;ref name="Kanigel1991" /&gt;{{rp|86}}

One of the first problems he posed in the journal was to find the value of:

: &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{1+2\sqrt{1+3 \sqrt{1+\cdots}}}.&lt;/math&gt;

He waited for a solution to be offered in three issues, over six months, but failed to receive any. At the end, Ramanujan supplied the solution to the problem himself. On page 105 of his first notebook, he formulated an equation that could be used to solve the infinitely [[nested radical]]s problem.

: &lt;math&gt;x+n+a = \sqrt{ax+(n+a)^2 +x\sqrt{a(x+n)+(n+a)^2+(x+n) \sqrt{\cdots}}}&lt;/math&gt;

Using this equation, the answer to the question posed in the ''Journal'' was simply 3, obtained by setting {{math|1=''x'' = 2}}, {{math|1=''n'' = 1}}, and {{math|1=''a'' = 0}}.&lt;ref name="Kanigel1991" /&gt;{{rp|87}} Ramanujan wrote his first formal paper for the ''Journal'' on the properties of [[Bernoulli number]]s. One property he discovered was that the denominators {{OEIS|id=A027642}} of the fractions of Bernoulli numbers were always divisible by six. He also devised a method of calculating {{mvar|B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}} based on previous Bernoulli numbers. One of these methods follows:

It will be observed that if ''n'' is even but not equal to zero,
# {{mvar|B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a fraction and the numerator of {{math|{{sfrac|''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''|''n''}}}} in its lowest terms is a prime number,
# the denominator of {{mvar|B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}} contains each of the factors 2 and 3 once and only once,
# {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1){{sfrac|''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''|''n''}}}} is an integer and {{math|2(2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1)''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} consequently is an ''odd'' integer.

In his 17-page paper, "Some Properties of Bernoulli's Numbers" (1911), Ramanujan gave three proofs, two corollaries and three conjectures.&lt;ref name="Kanigel1991" /&gt;{{rp|91}} Ramanujan's writing initially had many flaws. As ''Journal'' editor M. T. Narayana Iyengar noted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Mr. Ramanujan's methods were so terse and novel and his presentation so lacking in clearness and precision, that the ordinary [mathematical reader], unaccustomed to such intellectual gymnastics, could hardly follow him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seshu Iyer |first=P. V. |date=June 1920 |title=The Late Mr. S. Ramanujan, B.A., F.R.S.|journal=Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society|volume=12 |issue=3 |page=83|ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Ramanujan later wrote another paper and also continued to provide problems in the ''Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;Neville (March 1942), p292.&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1912, he got a temporary job in the Madras [[Accountant General]]'s office, with a salary of 20 rupees per month. He lasted only a few weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Srinivasan (1968), p176.&lt;/ref&gt; Toward the end of that assignment, he applied for a position under the Chief Accountant of the Madras Port Trust.

In a letter dated 9 February 1912, Ramanujan wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Sir,&lt;br&gt;
{{pad|2em}}I understand there is a clerkship vacant in your office, and I beg to apply for the same. I have passed the Matriculation Examination and studied up to the F.A. but was prevented from pursuing my studies further owing to several untoward circumstances. I have, however, been devoting all my time to Mathematics and developing the subject. I can say I am quite confident I can do justice to my work if I am appointed to the post. I therefore beg to request that you will be good enough to confer the appointment on me.&lt;ref&gt;Srinivasan (1968), p31.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Attached to his application was a recommendation from [[E. W. Middlemast]], a mathematics professor at the [[Presidency College, Chennai|Presidency College]], who wrote that Ramanujan was "a young man of quite exceptional capacity in Mathematics".&lt;ref&gt;Srinivasan (1968), p49.&lt;/ref&gt; Three weeks after he had applied, on 1 March, Ramanujan learned that he had been accepted as a Class III, Grade IV accounting clerk, making 30 rupees per month.&lt;ref name="Kanigel1991" /&gt;{{rp|96}} At his office, Ramanujan easily and quickly completed the work he was given, so he spent his spare time doing mathematical research. Ramanujan's boss, [[Francis Spring|Sir Francis Spring]], and S. Narayana Iyer, a colleague who was also treasurer of the Indian Mathematical Society, encouraged Ramanujan in his mathematical pursuits.

===Contacting British mathematicians===
In the spring of 1913, Narayana Iyer, Ramachandra Rao and [[E. W. Middlemast]] tried to present Ramanujan's work to British mathematicians. [[Micaiah John Muller Hill|M. J. M. Hill]] of [[University College London]] commented that Ramanujan's papers were riddled with holes.&lt;ref name="Kanigel1991" /&gt;{{rp|105}} He said that although Ramanujan had "a taste for mathematics, and some ability," he lacked the educational background and foundation needed to be accepted by mathematicians.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from M. J. M. Hill to a C. L. T. Griffith (a former student who sent the request to Hill on Ramanujan's behalf), 28 November 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Hill did not offer to take Ramanujan on as a student, he did give thorough and serious professional advice on his work. With the help of friends, Ramanujan drafted letters to leading mathematicians at Cambridge University.&lt;ref name="Kanigel1991" /&gt;{{rp|106}}

The first two professors, [[H. F. Baker]] and [[E. W. Hobson]], returned Ramanujan's papers without comment.&lt;ref name="Kanigel1991" /&gt;{{rp|170–171}} On 16 January 1913, Ramanujan wrote to [[G. H. Hardy]]. Coming from an unknown mathematician, the nine pages of mathematics made Hardy initially view Ramanujan's manuscripts as a possible fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Snow|first=C. P. |title= Variety of Men |year= 1966|publisher= [[Charles Scribner's Sons]] |location=New York|isbn= | pages=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardy recognised some of Ramanujan's formulae but others "seemed scarcely possible to believe".&lt;ref name="Hardy1920"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hardy |first=G. H.|authorlink=G. H. Hardy|date=June 1920 |title=Obituary, S. Ramanujan |journal=Nature|volume=105 |issue= 7|doi=10.1038/105494a0 |bibcode = 1920Natur.105..494H|ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|494}} One of the theorems Hardy found amazing was on the bottom of page three (valid for {{math|0 &lt; ''a'' &lt; ''b'' + {{sfrac|1|2}}}}):

: &lt;math&gt;
\int\limits_0^\infty \frac{1+\dfrac{x^2}{(b+1)^2}}{1+\dfrac{x^2}{a^2}} \times\frac{1+\dfrac{x^2}{(b+2)^2}}{1+\dfrac{x^2}{(a+1)^2}}\times\cdots\,dx 
= \frac{\sqrt \pi}{2} \times\frac{\Gamma\left(a+\frac12\right) \Gamma(b+1) \Gamma(b-a+1)}{\Gamma(a)\Gamma\left(b+\frac12\right)\Gamma\left(b-a + \frac12 \right)}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Hardy was also impressed by some of Ramanujan's other work relating to infinite series:

: &lt;math&gt;1 - 5\left(\frac12\right)^3 + 9\left(\frac{1\times3}{2\times4}\right)^3 - 13\left(\frac{1\times3\times5}{2\times4\times6}\right)^3 + \cdots = \frac{2}{\pi}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;1 + 9\left(\frac14\right)^4 + 17\left(\frac{1\times5}{4\times8}\right)^4 + 25\left(\frac{1\times5\times9}{4\times8\times12}\right)^4 + \cdots = \frac{2\sqrt 2}{\sqrt\pi\,\Gamma^2\left(\frac34\right)}.&lt;/math&gt;

The first result had already been determined by [[Gustav Conrad Bauer|G. Bauer]] in 1859. The second was new to Hardy, and was derived from a class of functions called [[hypergeometric series]], which had first been researched by [[Leonhard Euler]] and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]]. Hardy found these results "much more intriguing" than Gauss's work on integrals.&lt;ref name="Kanigel1991" /&gt;{{rp|167}} After seeing [[Rogers–Ramanujan continued fraction|Ramanujan's theorems on continued fractions]] on the last page of the manuscripts, Hardy commented that the theorems "defeated me completely; I had never seen anything in the least like them before".&lt;ref name="Kanigel1991" /&gt;{{rp|168}} He figured that Ramanujan's theorems "must be true, because, if they were not true, no one would have the imagination to invent them".&lt;ref name="Kanigel1991" /&gt;{{rp|168}} Hardy asked a colleague, [[John Edensor Littlewood|J. E. Littlewood]], to take a look at the papers. Littlewood was amazed by Ramanujan's genius. After discussing the papers with Littlewood, Hardy concluded that the letters were "certainly the most remarkable I have received" and said that Ramanujan was "a mathematician of the highest quality, a man of altogether exceptional originality and power".&lt;ref name="Hardy1920" /&gt;{{rp|494–495}} One colleague, [[Eric Harold Neville|E. H. Neville]], later remarked that "not one [theorem] could have been set in the most advanced mathematical examination in the world".&lt;ref name="Neville293"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Neville |first=Eric Harold |date=March 1942 |title=Srinivasa Ramanujan |journal=Nature|volume=149 |issue=3776 |page=293 |doi=10.1038/149292a0 |bibcode = 1942Natur.149..292N|ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 February 1913, Hardy wrote Ramanujan a letter expressing his interest in his work, adding that it was "essential that I should see proofs of some of your assertions".&lt;ref&gt;Letter, Hardy to Ramanujan, 8 February 1913.&lt;/ref&gt; Before his letter arrived in Madras during the third week of February, Hardy contacted the Indian Office to plan for Ramanujan's trip to Cambridge. Secretary Arthur Davies of the Advisory Committee for Indian Students met with Ramanujan to discuss the overseas trip.&lt;ref&gt;Letter, Ramanujan to Hardy, 22 January 1914.&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with his Brahmin upbringing, Ramanujan refused to leave his country to "go to a foreign land".&lt;ref name="Kanigel1991" /&gt;{{rp|185}} Meanwhile, he sent Hardy a letter packed with theorems, writing, "I have found a friend in you who views my labour sympathetically."&lt;ref&gt;Letter, Ramanujan to Hardy, 27 February 1913, [[Cambridge University Library]].&lt;/ref&gt;

To supplement Hardy's endorsement, [[Gilbert Walker]], a former mathematical lecturer at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], looked at Ramanujan's work and expressed amazement, urging the young man to spend time at Cambridge.&lt;ref name="Kanigel1991" /&gt;{{rp|175}} As a result of Walker's endorsement, B. Hanumantha Rao, a mathematics professor at an engineering college, invited Ramanujan's colleague Narayana Iyer to a meeting of the Board of Studies in Mathematics to discuss "what we can do for S. Ramanujan".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ram|first=Suresh |title= Srinivasa Ramanujan |year= 1972|publisher= National Book Trust |location=New Delhi|isbn= | page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The board agreed to grant Ramanujan a research scholarship of 75 rupees per month for the next two years at the [[University of Madras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranganathan|1967|pp=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he was engaged as a research student, Ramanujan continued to submit papers to the ''Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society.'' In one instance, Narayana Iyer submitted some of Ramanujan's theorems on summation of series to the journal, adding, "The following theorem is due to S. Ramanujan, the mathematics student of Madras University." Later in November, British Professor Edward B. Ross of [[Madras Christian College]], whom Ramanujan had met a few years before, stormed into his class one day with his eyes glowing, asking his students, "Does Ramanujan know Polish?" The reason was that in one paper, Ramanujan had anticipated the work of a Polish mathematician whose paper had just arrived in the day's mail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranganathan|1967|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his quarterly papers, Ramanujan drew up theorems to make definite integrals more easily solvable. Working off Giuliano Frullani's 1821 integral theorem, Ramanujan formulated generalisations that could be made to evaluate formerly unyielding integrals.&lt;ref name="Kanigel1991" /&gt;{{rp|183}}

Hardy's correspondence with Ramanujan soured after Ramanujan refused to come to England. Hardy enlisted a colleague lecturing in Madras, E. H. Neville, to mentor and bring Ramanujan to England.&lt;ref name="Kanigel1991" /&gt;{{rp|184}} Neville asked Ramanujan why he would not go to Cambridge. Ramanujan apparently had now accepted the proposal; as Neville put it, "Ramanujan needed no converting and that his parents' opposition had been withdrawn".&lt;ref name="Neville293"/&gt; Apparently, Ramanujan's mother had a vivid dream in which the family goddess, [[Namagiri Thayar|the deity of Namagiri]], commanded her "to stand no longer between her son and the fulfilment of his life's purpose".&lt;ref name="Neville293"/&gt; Ramanujan traveled to England by ship, leaving his wife to stay with his parents in India.

==Life in England==
[[File:RamanujanCambridge.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Ramanujan (centre) and his colleague [[G. H. Hardy]] (extreme right), with other scientists, outside the [[Senate House, Cambridge]], c.1914–19]]
[[File:Whewell's Court, Trinity College, Cambridge.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Whewell's Court, [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]]]

Ramanujan departed from Madras aboard the S.S. ''Nevasa'' on 17 March 1914.&lt;ref name="Kanigel1991" /&gt;{{rp|196}} When he disembarked in London on 14 April, Neville was waiting for him with a car. Four days later, Neville took him to his house on Chesterton Road in Cambridge. Ramanujan immediately began his work with Littlewood and Hardy. After six weeks, Ramanujan moved out of Neville's house and took up residence on Whewell's Court, a five-minute walk from Hardy's room.&lt;ref name="Kanigel1991" /&gt;{{rp|202}} [[G. H. Hardy|Hardy]] and [[J. E. Littlewood|Littlewood]] began to look at Ramanujan's notebooks. Hardy had already received 120 theorems from Ramanujan in the first two letters, but there were many more results and theorems in the notebooks. Hardy saw that some were wrong, others had already been discovered, and the rest were new breakthroughs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hardy |first=G. H. |title= Ramanujan|year= 1940 |publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Cambridge|isbn=| page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ramanujan left a deep impression on Hardy and Littlewood. Littlewood commented, "I can believe that he's at least a [[Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi|Jacobi]]",&lt;ref&gt;Letter, Littlewood to Hardy, early March 1913.&lt;/ref&gt; while Hardy said he "can compare him only with [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] or Jacobi."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hardy |first=G. H. |title= Collected Papers of G. H. Hardy|year= 1979 |publisher= [[Oxford University Press|Clarendon Press]] |location=Oxford, England|isbn=| pages=Vol. 7, p720 |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramanujan spent nearly five years in Cambridge collaborating with Hardy and Littlewood, and published part of his findings there. Hardy and Ramanujan had highly contrasting personalities. Their collaboration was a clash of different cultures, beliefs, and working styles. In the previous few decades, the [[foundations of mathematics]] had come into question and the need for [[mathematical rigor|mathematically rigorous]] proofs recognized. Hardy was an atheist and an apostle of proof and mathematical rigour, whereas Ramanujan was a deeply religious man who relied very strongly on his intuition and insights. While in England, Hardy tried his best to fill the gaps in Ramanujan's education and to mentor him in the need for formal proofs to support his results, without hindering his inspiration – a conflict that neither found easy.

Ramanujan was awarded a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree by research (this degree was later renamed PhD) in March 1916 for his work on [[highly composite number]]s, the first part of which was published as a paper in the ''[[Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society]].'' The paper was more than 50 pages and proved various properties of such numbers. Hardy remarked that it was one of the most unusual papers seen in mathematical research at that time and that Ramanujan showed extraordinary ingenuity in handling it.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} On 6 December 1917, he was elected to the London Mathematical Society. In 1918 he was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]], the second Indian admitted to the Royal Society, following [[Ardaseer Cursetjee]] in 1841. At age 31 Ramanujan was one of the youngest Fellows in the history of the Royal Society. He was elected "for his investigation in [[Elliptic function]]s and the Theory of Numbers." On 13 October 1918, he was the first Indian to be elected a [[Trinity College, Cambridge#Notable fellows and alumni|Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref name="Kanigel1991" /&gt;{{rp|299–300}}

===Illness and death===
Throughout his life, Ramanujan was plagued by health problems. His health worsened in England; possibly he was also less resilient due to the difficulty of keeping to the strict dietary requirements of his religion in England and wartime rationing during 1914–1918. He was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]] and a severe [[vitamin]] deficiency at the time, and was confined to a [[sanatorium]]. In 1919 he returned to [[Kumbakonam]], [[Madras Presidency]], and  soon thereafter, in 1920, died at the age of 32. After his death, his brother Tirunarayanan chronicled Ramanujan's remaining handwritten notes consisting of formulae on singular moduli, hypergeometric series and continued fractions and compiled them.&lt;ref name="express"/&gt;

Ramanujan's widow, [[Smt.]] Janaki Ammal, moved to [[Bombay]]; in 1931 she returned to Madras and settled in [[Triplicane]], where she supported herself on a pension from Madras University and income from tailoring. In 1950, she adopted a son, W. Narayanan, who eventually became an officer of the [[State Bank of India]] and raised a family. In her later years, she was granted a lifetime pension from Ramanujan's former employer, the Madras Port Trust, and was also granted pensions from, among others, the [[Indian National Science Academy]] and the state governments of [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[West Bengal]]. She continued to cherish Ramanujan's memory, and was active in efforts towards increasing his public recognition; prominent mathematicians, including George Andrews, [[Bruce C. Berndt]] and [[Béla Bollobás]] made it a point to visit her while in India. She died at her Triplicane residence in 1994.&lt;ref name="Janaki"/&gt;&lt;ref name="express"/&gt;

A 1994 analysis of Ramanujan's medical records and symptoms by Dr. D. A. B. Young&lt;ref&gt;Young, D. A. B. (1994). Ramanujan's illness. Notes and records of the Royal Society of London, 48(1), 107–119.&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that his medical [[symptom]]s—including his past relapses, fevers, and hepatic conditions—were much closer to those resulting from hepatic [[amoebiasis]], an illness then widespread in Madras, rather than tuberculosis. He had two episodes of [[dysentery]] before he left India. When not properly treated, dysentery can lie dormant for years and lead to hepatic amoebiasis, whose diagnosis was not then well established.&lt;ref name="lostnotebook"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.las.illinois.edu/alumni/magazine/articles/2006/lostnotebook/|title=Raiders of the Lost Notebook|accessdate=11 January 2014|last=Peterson|first=Doug|publisher=[[UIUC College of Liberal Arts and Sciences]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112022743/https://www.las.illinois.edu/alumni/magazine/articles/2006/lostnotebook/|archivedate=12 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, if properly diagnosed, amoebiasis was a treatable and often curable disease;&lt;ref name="lostnotebook"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gunn, J.

===Personality and spiritual life===
Ramanujan has been described as a person of a somewhat shy and quiet disposition, a dignified man with pleasant manners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lived a simple life at Cambridge.&lt;ref name="Kanigel1991" /&gt;{{rp|234,241}}  Ramanujan's first Indian biographers describe him as a rigorously orthodox Hindu. He credited his acumen to his [[Kuladevata|family goddess]], [[Namagiri Thayar|Mahalakshmi]] of [[Namakkal]]. He looked to her for inspiration in his work&lt;ref name="Kanigel1991" /&gt;{{rp|36}} and said he dreamed of blood drops that symbolised her  consort, [[Narasimha]]. Afterward he would receive visions of scrolls of complex mathematical content unfolding before his eyes.&lt;ref name="Kanigel1991" /&gt;{{rp|281}} He often said, "An equation for me has no meaning unless it represents a thought of God."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Less Proof, More Truth|journal=New Scientist |issue=2614 |date=28 July 2007 |page=49 |author=Chaitin, Gregory|ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hardy cites Ramanujan as remarking that all religions seemed equally true to him.&lt;ref name="Kanigel1991" /&gt;{{rp|283}} Hardy further argued that Ramanujan's religious belief had been romanticised by Westerners and overstated—in reference to his belief, not practice—by Indian biographers. At the same time, he remarked on Ramanujan's strict [[vegetarian]]ism.&lt;ref name="berndt"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ramanujan: Essays and Surveys|last1=Berndt|last2=Rankin|first1=Bruce C.|first2=Robert Alexander|url=https://books.google.com/?id=TT1T8A94xNcC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;lpg=PA47&amp;dq=Ramanujan+vegetarianism#v=onepage&amp;q=Ramanujan%20vegetarianism&amp;f=false|page=47|publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]]|date=2001|isbn=0821826247|access-date=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical achievements==
In mathematics, there is a distinction between insight and formulating or working through a proof. Ramanujan proposed an abundance of formulae that could be investigated later in depth. [[G.&amp;nbsp;H. Hardy]] said that Ramanujan's discoveries are unusually rich and that there is often more to them than initially meets the eye. As a byproduct of his work, new directions of research were opened up. Examples of the most interesting of these formulae include the intriguing infinite [[Series (mathematics)|series]] for [[pi|{{pi}}]], one of which is given below:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{\pi} = \frac{2\sqrt 2}{9801} \sum^\infty_{k=0} \frac{(4k)!(1103+26390k)}{(k!)^4 396^{4k}}.&lt;/math&gt;

This result is based on the negative [[fundamental discriminant]] {{nowrap|1={{mvar|d}} = −4 × 58 = −232}} with class number {{nowrap|1={{math|''h''(''d'')}} = 2}}. Further, {{nowrap|1=26390 = 5 × 7 × 13 × 58}} and {{nowrap|1=16 × 9801 = 396&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} and is related to the fact that

:&lt;math display="inline"&gt; e^{\pi\sqrt{58}} = 396^4 - 104.000000177\dots. &lt;/math&gt;

This might be compared to [[Heegner number]]s, which have [[Ideal class group|class number]] 1 and yield similar formulae.

Ramanujan's series for {{pi}} converges extraordinarily rapidly (exponentially) and forms the basis of some of the fastest algorithms currently used to calculate {{pi}}. Truncating the sum to the first term also gives the approximation {{sfrac|9801{{sqrt|2}}|4412}} for {{pi}}, which is correct to six decimal places; truncating it to the first two terms gives a value correct to 14 decimal places. See also the more general [[Ramanujan–Sato series]].

One of Ramanujan's remarkable capabilities was the rapid solution of problems, illustrated by the following anecdote about an incident in which [[Mahalanobis|P. C. Mahalanobis]] posed a problem:

{{quote|Imagine that you are on a street with houses marked 1 through {{mvar|n}}. There is a house in between ({{mvar|x}}) such that the sum of the house numbers to the left of it equals the sum of the house numbers to its right. If {{mvar|n}} is between 50 and 500, what are {{mvar|n}} and {{mvar|x}}?' This is a bivariate problem with multiple solutions. Ramanujan thought about it and gave the answer with a twist: He gave a [[continued fraction]]. The unusual part was that it was the solution to the whole class of problems.  Mahalanobis was astounded and asked how he did it. 'It is simple. The minute I heard the problem, I knew that the answer was a continued fraction. Which continued fraction, I asked myself. Then the answer came to my mind', Ramanujan replied."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ranganathan|1967|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Statistics and truth: putting chance to work|year=1997|publisher=World Scientific|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jqWd4oe3iwIC&amp;pg=PA185&amp;dq=%22Which+continued+fraction%22|author=Calyampudi Radhakrishna Rao|accessdate=7 June 2010|page=185|isbn=978-981-02-3111-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

His intuition also led him to derive some previously unknown [[identity (mathematics)|identities]], such as

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \left ( 1+2\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\cos(n\theta)}{\cosh(n\pi)} \right )^{-2} + \left (1+2\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\cosh(n\theta)}{\cosh(n\pi)} \right )^{-2} \\[6pt]
&amp; = \frac {2 \Gamma^4 \left ( \frac34 \right )} \pi = \frac{8\pi^3}{\Gamma^4 \left ( \frac14 \right )}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

for all {{math|''θ''}}, where {{math|Γ(''z'')}} is the [[gamma function]], and related to a special value of the [[Dedekind eta function#Special values|Dedekind eta function]]. Expanding into series of powers and equating coefficients of {{math|''θ''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;}}, {{math|''θ''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and {{math|''θ''&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;}} gives some deep identities for the [[hyperbolic secant]].

In 1918 Hardy and Ramanujan studied the [[Partition function (number theory)#Partition function|partition function]] {{math|''P''(''n'')}} extensively. They gave a non-convergent asymptotic series that permits exact computation of the number of partitions of an integer. [[Hans Rademacher]], in 1937, was able to refine their formula to find an exact convergent series solution to this problem. Ramanujan and Hardy's work in this area gave rise to a powerful new method for finding asymptotic formulae called the [[Hardy–Littlewood circle method|circle method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PartitionFunctionP.html |title = Partition Formula |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100209063949/https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PartitionFunctionP.html |archivedate = 9 February 2010 |df = dmy-all |access-date = 23 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last year of his life, Ramanujan discovered [[mock theta function]]s.&lt;ref name="Fox"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.foxnews.com/science/2012/12/28/mathematician-century-old-secrets-unlocked/ | work=Fox News | title=100-Year-Old Deathbed Dreams of Mathematician Proved True | date=28 December 2012 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130107003536/https://www.foxnews.com/science/2012/12/28/mathematician-century-old-secrets-unlocked/ | archivedate=7 January 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; For many years these functions were a mystery, but they are now known to be the holomorphic parts of harmonic weak [[Maass forms]].

===The Ramanujan conjecture===
{{Main|Ramanujan–Petersson conjecture}}

Although there are numerous statements that could have borne the name ''Ramanujan conjecture,'' there is one that was highly influential on later work. In particular, the connection of this conjecture with conjectures of [[André Weil]] in algebraic geometry opened up new areas of research. That [[Ramanujan conjecture]] is an assertion on the size of the [[Ramanujan tau function|tau-function]], which has as generating function the discriminant modular form Δ(''q''), a typical [[cusp form]] in the theory of [[modular forms]]. It was finally proven in 1973, as a consequence of [[Pierre Deligne]]'s proof of the [[Weil conjectures]]. The reduction step involved is complicated. Deligne won a [[Fields Medal]] in 1978 for that work.&lt;ref&gt;Ono (June–July 2006), p&amp;nbsp;649.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his paper "On certain arithmetical functions", Ramanujan defined the so-called delta-function whose coefficients are called {{math|''τ''(''n'')}} (the [[Ramanujan tau function]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Ramanujan |first= Srinivasa |title= On certain arithmetical functions |journal= Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society |volume= XXII |number= No. 9 |year= 1916 |publisher= [[Cambridge Philosophical Society]] |url= https://ramanujan.sirinudi.org/Volumes/published/ram18.pdf |accessdate= 15 May 2016 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160611175341/https://ramanujan.sirinudi.org/Volumes/published/ram18.pdf |archivedate= 11 June 2016 |df= dmy-all }} The tau function is discussed in pages 194–197.&lt;/ref&gt; He proved many congruences for these numbers such as {{math|''τ''(''p'') ≡ 1 + ''p''&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; mod 691}} for primes {{mvar|p}}. This congruence (and others like it that Ramanujan proved) inspired [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] (1954 Fields Medalist) to conjecture that there is a theory of [[Galois module|Galois representations]] which "explains" these congruences  and more generally all modular forms. {{math|Δ(''z'')}} is the first example of a modular form to be studied in this way. Pierre Deligne (in his Fields Medal-winning work) proved Serre's conjecture. The proof of [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] proceeds by first reinterpreting [[elliptic curve]]s and modular forms in terms of these Galois representations. Without this theory there would be no proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Ono |first1= Ken |authorlink1= Ken Ono |last2= Aczel|first2= Amir D. |authorlink2= Amir Aczel |title= My Search for Ramanujan: How I Learned to Count |date= 13 April 2016 |publisher= [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |pages= 236–237 |isbn= 978-3319255668 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=JZkFDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA236&amp;lpg=PA236&amp;dq=%22ideas+that+were+critical+to+the+proof+of+Fermat's+last+theorem%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22ideas%20that%20were%20critical%20to%20the%20proof%20of%20Fermat's%20last%20theorem%22&amp;f=false |quote= ideas that were critical to the proof of Fermat's last theorem}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ramanujan's notebooks===
{{Further|Ramanujan's lost notebook}}

While still in Madras, Ramanujan recorded the bulk of his results in four notebooks of [[loose leaf|loose-leaf]] paper. They were mostly written up without any derivations. This is probably the origin of the misapprehension that Ramanujan was unable to prove his results and simply thought up the final result directly. Mathematician [[Bruce C. Berndt]], in his review of these notebooks and Ramanujan's work, says that Ramanujan most certainly was able to prove most of his results, but chose not to.

This may have been for any number of reasons. Since paper was very expensive, Ramanujan would do most of his work and perhaps his proofs on [[slate (writing)|slate]], and then transfer just the results to paper. Using a slate was common for mathematics students in the [[Madras Presidency]] at the time. He was also quite likely to have been influenced by the style of [[G. S. Carr]]'s book, which stated results without proofs. Finally, it is possible that Ramanujan considered his workings to be for his personal interest alone and therefore recorded only the results.&lt;ref name="Bruce Berndt on Ramanujan"&gt;{{Cite book|isbn = 0387949410 |title = Ramanujans Notebooks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first notebook has 351 pages with 16 somewhat organised chapters and some unorganised material. The second notebook has 256 pages in 21 chapters and 100 unorganised pages, with the third notebook containing 33 unorganised pages. The results in his notebooks inspired numerous papers by later mathematicians trying to prove what he had found. Hardy himself created papers exploring material from Ramanujan's work, as did [[G. N. Watson]], [[Bertram Martin Wilson|B. M. Wilson]], and Bruce Berndt.&lt;ref name="Bruce Berndt on Ramanujan"/&gt; A fourth notebook with 87 unorganised pages, the so-called [[Ramanujan's lost notebook|"lost notebook"]], was rediscovered in 1976 by [[George Andrews (mathematician)|George Andrews]].&lt;ref name="lostnotebook"/&gt;

==Hardy–Ramanujan number 1729==
{{Main|1729 (number)}}
The number 1729 is known as the Hardy–Ramanujan number after a famous visit by Hardy to see Ramanujan at a hospital. In Hardy's words:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Quotations/Hardy.html |title=Quotations by Hardy |publisher=Gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk |accessdate=20 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716185939/https://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Quotations/Hardy.html |archivedate=16 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I remember once going to see him when he was ill at [[Putney]]. I had ridden in taxi cab number 1729 and remarked that the number seemed to me rather a [[Interesting number paradox|dull one]], and that I hoped it was not an unfavorable omen. "No", he replied, "it is a very interesting number; it is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Immediately before this anecdote, Hardy quoted Littlewood as saying, "Every positive integer was one of [Ramanujan's] personal friends."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.numbertheory.org/obituaries/LMS/ramanujan/page18.html |title=Obituary Notices: Srinivasa Ramanujan |publisher=Hardy, G.H., ''Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society 19'', p. lvii |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305005434/https://www.numbertheory.org/obituaries/LMS/ramanujan/page18.html |archivedate=5 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two different ways are:

:&lt;math&gt;1729=1^3+12^3=9^3+10^3&lt;/math&gt;.

Generalizations of this idea have created the notion of "[[taxicab number]]s".

==Mathematicians' views of Ramanujan==
In his obituary of Ramanujan, which he wrote for ''Nature'' in 1920, Hardy observed Ramanujan's work primarily involved fields less known even amongst other pure mathematicians, concluding:

{{quote|His insight into formulae was quite amazing, and altogether beyond anything I have met with in any European mathematician. It is perhaps useless to speculate as to his history had he been introduced to modern ideas and methods at sixteen instead of at twenty-six. It is not extravagant to suppose that he might have become the greatest mathematician of his time. What he actually did is wonderful enough...when the researches which his work has suggested have been completed, it will probably seem a good deal more wonderful than it does to-day.&lt;ref name="Hardy1920"/&gt;}}

Hardy further said:

{{quote|He combined a power of generalization, a feeling for form, and a capacity for rapid modification of his hypotheses, that were often really startling, and made him, in his own peculiar field, without a rival in his day. The limitations of his knowledge were as startling as its profundity. Here was a man who could work out [[modular equation]]s and theorems... to orders unheard of, whose mastery of continued fractions was... beyond that of any mathematician in the world, who had found for himself the functional equation of the [[Riemann zeta function|zeta function]] and the dominant terms of many of the most famous problems in the analytic theory of numbers; and yet he had never heard of a [[doubly periodic function]] or of [[Cauchy's integral theorem|Cauchy's theorem]], and had indeed but the vaguest idea of what a function of a [[complex variable]] was...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Ramanujan.html |title = Ramanujan quote |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070610103616/https://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Ramanujan.html |archivedate = 10 June 2007 |df = dmy-all |access-date = 23 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When asked about the methods Ramanujan employed to arrive at his solutions, Hardy said that they were "arrived at by a process of mingled argument, intuition, and induction, of which he was entirely unable to give any coherent account."&lt;ref name="cola1"&gt;[https://www.usna.edu/Users/math/meh/ramanujan.html Srinivasa Ramanujan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050325041218/https://www.usna.edu/Users/math/meh/ramanujan.html |date=25 March 2005 }}. Retrieved 2 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that he had "never met his equal, and can compare him only with [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] or [[Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi|Jacobi]]."&lt;ref name="cola1"/&gt;

K. Srinivasa Rao has said,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.imsc.res.in/~rao/ramanujan.html| author=K Srinivasa Rao| title=Srinivasa Ramanujan (22 December 1887 – 26 April 1920)| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416085328/https://www.imsc.res.in/~rao/ramanujan.html| archivedate=16 April 2012| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; "As for his place in the world of Mathematics, we quote Bruce C. Berndt: '[[Paul Erdős]] has passed  on to us Hardy's personal ratings of mathematicians. Suppose that we rate mathematicians on the basis of pure talent on a scale from 0 to 100, Hardy gave himself a score of 25, [[John Edensor Littlewood|J. E. Littlewood]] 30, [[David Hilbert]] 80 and Ramanujan 100.'" During a lecture at [[IIT Madras]] in May 2011, Berndt stated that over the last 40 years, as nearly all of Ramanujan's theorems have been proven right, there had been greater appreciation of Ramanujan's work and brilliance, and that Ramanujan's work was now pervading many areas of modern mathematics and physics.&lt;ref name="Fox"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=youtube.com|title=Bruce Berndt on "Ramanujan's Lost Notebook", IIT Madras, 24th May 2011|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uCAuwOQoxA&amp;feature=related|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151206114320/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uCAuwOQoxA&amp;feature=related|archivedate=6 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Scientific Edge'', the physicist [[Jayant Narlikar]] spoke of "Srinivasa Ramanujan, discovered by the Cambridge mathematician Hardy, whose great mathematical findings were beginning to be appreciated from 1915 to 1919. His achievements were to be fully understood much later, well after his untimely death in 1920. For example, his work on the [[highly composite numbers]] (numbers with a large number of factors) started a whole new line of investigations in the theory of such numbers."

Since Ramanujan's centennial year, his birthday, 22 December, has been annually celebrated as Ramanujan Day by the [[Government Arts College, Kumbakonam]] where he studied and at the [[Indian Institute of Technology Madras|IIT Madras]] in [[Chennai]]. A prize for young mathematicians from developing countries has been created in Ramanujan's name by the [[International Centre for Theoretical Physics]] (ICTP) in cooperation with the [[International Mathematical Union]], which nominate members of the prize committee. The [[Shanmugha Arts, Science, Technology &amp; Research Academy|SASTRA University]], based in the state of [[Tamil Nadu]] in South India, has instituted the [[SASTRA Ramanujan Prize]] of [[US$]]10,000 to be given annually to a mathematician not exceeding the age of 32 for outstanding contributions in an area of mathematics influenced by Ramanujan. Based on the recommendations of a high level committee appointed by the University Grants Commission (UGC), Government of India, Srinivasa Ramanujan Centre, established by SASTRA, has been declared as an OFF-CAMPUS CENTRE under the ambit of SASTRA University. House of Ramanujan Mathematics, a museum on life and works of the Mathematical prodigy, Srinivasa Ramanujan, also exists on this campus. SASTRA purchased the house where Srinivasa Ramanujan lived at Kumabakonam and renovated it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://src.sastra.edu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=234&amp;Itemid=345|title=Sastra University – Srinivasa Ramanujan Center – About Us|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170615164913/https://src.sastra.edu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=234&amp;Itemid=345|archivedate=15 June 2017|df=dmy-all|access-date=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vasavi College of Engineering]] named its Department of Computer Science and Information Technology "Ramanujan Block".

'''Susan Bordo''' is a writer known for her contributions to the field of contemporary [[cultural studies]], particularly in the area of "body studies".

==Overview==
Bordo's writing contributes to a body of feminist, cultural and [[gender studies]], linking modern [[consumer culture]] directly to the formation of [[gender]]ed bodies. She is known for her ''Unbearable Weight: Feminism, Western Culture, and the Body'' (1993), a text that looks at the impact of [[popular culture]] (television, advertisements, and magazines, for example) in shaping the female body while also looking at typical female disorders such as [[hysteria]], [[agoraphobia]], [[anorexia nervosa]] and [[bulimia]] as "complex crystallizations of culture".&lt;ref name=uw35&gt;Bordo, ''Unbearable Weight'', p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Bordo has also garnered attention{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} for her more recent ''The Male Body: A New Look at Men in Public and Private'' (1999), a text which Bordo describes as being "a personal/cultural exploration of the male body from a woman's point of view."

==Professional career==
Bordo received her [[Ph.D.]] from the [[State University of New York at Stony Brook]] in 1982. She currently holds the Otis A. Singletary Chair in the Humanities at the [[University of Kentucky]] where she teaches [[English Studies|English]] and [[Women's studies]]. Bordo specializes in contemporary culture and its relation to the body, focusing on modern female disorders such as anorexia and bulimia, cosmetic surgery, beauty and [[evolution]]ary theory. She also deals with [[racism]] and the body, issues of [[masculinity]] along with issues of [[sexual harassment]].

==Theoretical context==

===Philosophical discourse===
While Bordo's writing works to "reach outside the [[academic]] world",&lt;ref name=l2360&gt;Leitch, p. 2360.&lt;/ref&gt; her theoretical [[prose]] and frank critiques of modern culture in relation to subject, gender and body formations are nonetheless grounded in [[literary theory|theoretical]] frameworks. Bordo's work reflects a background in philosophical [[discourse]] in which issues of [[rationality]], [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]] and [[Cartesian dualism]] are taken up, explored and used to situate the body within culture historically.&lt;ref&gt;Bordo, ''Unbearable Weight'', p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Bordo claims that "[w]hat remains the constant element throughout historical variation is the construction of body as something apart from the true self (whether conceived as [[soul]], [[mind]], [[spirit]], will, [[creativity]], freedom . . .) and as undermining the best efforts of that self".&lt;ref&gt;Bordo, ''Unbearable Weight'', p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; She traces the "body" as a [[concept]] and as a material "thing" back to [[Plato]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] and the [[Bible]] revealing how traditionally the body has been viewed as "animal, as appetite, as deceiver, as prisoner of the soul and confounder of its projects".&lt;ref&gt;Bordo, ''Unbearable Weight'', p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; She also traces the [[Mind-body dualism|dualistic]] nature of the mind/body connection by examining the early philosophies of [[Aristotle]], [[Hegel]] and [[Descartes]], revealing how such distinguishing [[Wiktionary:binary|binaries]] such as spirit/[[matter]] and male activity/female passivity have worked to solidify gender characteristics and categorization. Bordo goes on to point out that while men have historically been associated with the intellect and the mind or spirit, women have long been associated with the body, the subordinated, negatively imbued term in the mind/body [[dichotomy]].

===Materialism===
Bordo argues that "knowledge is 'embodied,' produced from a 'standpoint,' by a body that is located as a material entity among other material entities".&lt;ref name=l2360/&gt; She is therefore situated within a [[materialism|materialist]] framework, for, as [[Susan Hekman]] points out, "Bordo's emphasis on the materiality of the body, what most of us would call the 'real' body, is a function of her central theoretical conviction".&lt;ref name=hrev/&gt; Situating Bordo within a [[feminist theory|feminist]] and materialist theoretical context, her work is often compared and contrasted with [[Judith Butler]]'s writing, writing that deals with gender formation and the body. Hekman provides analyses of Bordo's situatedness within materialist discourse and suggests both differences and similarities in the theoretical concerns of Bordo and Butler. While Bordo does at times imply that the body is a text to be inscribed upon and interpreted, she also emphasizes the materiality and locatedness of bodies within [[Western culture]], whereas Butler's work on the body reflects a greater affiliation with [[postmodern]] thought in "treat[ing] the body as pure text".&lt;ref name=hrev&gt;Hekman, Review&lt;/ref&gt; Bordo questions such a purely textual body for "If the body is treated as pure text, subversive, destabilizing elements can be emphasized and freedom and self-determination celebrated; but one is left wondering, is there a body in this text?".&lt;ref&gt;Bordo, ''Unbearable Weight'', p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; For Bordo, it is the "cultural definitions of the ''body'' and its materiality as they are given to us" that must be resisted, and therefore "real" bodies "must be the focus of feminist analysis and, significantly, feminist resistance".&lt;ref&gt;Hekman, "Material Bodies", p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feminism===
Bordo's critique of gendered, and particularly feminine, bodies stems from both feminist and [[gender studies]] [[methodologies]]. She critiques, re-evaluates, and reconfigures old and new feminist methodology, not excluding certain earlier feminist concerns that focused on the dichotomies of oppressor/oppressed, victimizer/victim, but re-evaluating their effectiveness and application to contemporary feminine concerns. As Bordo points out, feminism of the late 1960s and 1970s viewed "the female body [as] a socially shaped and historically 'colonized' territory".&lt;ref&gt;Bordo, ''Unbearable Weight'', p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a view, she claims, classifies women and the female body predominantly as victims, living passively/submissively within patriarchal society, a [[tabula rasa]] awaiting inscription. Intending to go beyond such a classification, Bordo writes that new feminist critiques looked more towards "racial, economic and class differences among women," while also looking at "both women's collusions with [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] culture and their frequent efforts at resistance".&lt;ref&gt;Bordo, ''Unbearable Weight'', p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural studies===
While situated within feminist and gender studies frameworks, Bordo's theories also stem from a [[cultural studies]] approach where the power of cultural phenomena such as [[television]], [[advertising]] and popular magazines are analyzed in terms of means of domination and of resistance. While certain cultural theorists, for example [[John Fiske (media scholar)|John Fiske]], who wrote ''Television Culture'' (1990), see elements of culture like television as "demonstrating the way representational codes and techniques shape our perception" but also as a means for resistance, where audience members could "decode" such messages and thus be able to "think resistantly about their lives",&lt;ref name=l1026&gt;Leitch, p. 1026.&lt;/ref&gt; Bordo sees cultural coding as a more pernicious, binding and overwhelming force. For Bordo "the rules of femininity have come to be culturally transmitted more and more through the deployment of standardized visual images";&lt;ref&gt;Bordo, "The Body and the Reproduction of Femininity", p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; cultural transmitters such as television and print media work insidiously to "impose models of bodily beauty that get construed as freely chosen options by those victimized by them".&lt;ref name=l1026/&gt;

===Post structuralism===
The notions of culture, power and gender/subject formation that dominate Bordo's writing arise in some degree from [[poststructuralism|poststructuralist]] thought. Susan Hekman points out that "[l]ike an increasing number of contemporary feminist theorists [Bordo] argues for a selective use of [[postmodern]] theories"&lt;ref name=hrev/&gt; and one way Bordo's work can be seen in a poststructuralist/postmodernist light is through her usage of Foucauldian methodology. Bordo appropriates the ideas of [[Michel Foucault]] in critiquing, analyzing and bringing to light "the normative feminine practices of our culture".&lt;ref name=uw27&gt;Bordo, ''Unbearable Weight'', p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; As Bordo points out, Foucault saw power not "as the ''possession'' of individuals or groups" but "as a dynamic or network of non-centralized forces",&lt;ref&gt;Bordo, ''Unbearable Weight'', p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; and such a depiction of power relations is therefore useful in a critique of gender formation/regulation. If, in a Foucauldian sense, power works from below, then "prevailing forms of selfhood and subjectivity (gender among them) are maintained, not chiefly through physical restraint and coercion (although social relations may certainly contain such elements), but through individual [[panopticon|self-surveillance]] and self-correction to norms".&lt;ref name=uw27/&gt; Foucault's theories of power and discipline along with theories on [[human sexuality|sexuality]] serve contemporary feminist aims in revealing how cultural normative practices, expressed through popular media, work to influence femininity (and gendered bodies in general) into homogeneity while at the same time seeming freely chosen. "Like Foucault, [Bordo] focuses on the discourses through which [[society]] produces, understands, defines, and interprets the female body."&lt;ref&gt;Leitch, p. 2361.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing==

===''The Flight to Objectivity: Essays on Cartesianism and Culture'' (1987)===
''The Flight to Objectivity'' represents what Bordo refers to as a "fresh approach" to Descartes' ''Meditations''. She critiques the stable notion of [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]] and [[knowledge]] inherent in Cartesian thought, notions that, in our contemporary society, have become critically distanced, for "[t]he limitations of [[science]] and the interested, even ideological nature of all human pursuits now seem unavoidable recognitions".&lt;ref&gt;Bordo, ''The Flight to Objectivity'', p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Bordo sees that, rather than viewing Descartes from a "coherent abstract or ahistorical" perspective, we need to approach Descartes' philosophical arguments within "the context of the cultural pressures that gave rise to them".&lt;ref&gt;Bordo, ''The Flight to Objectivity'', p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Susan Hekman notes that Bordo's ''The Flight to Objectivity'', while not overtly dealing with theorizations of the body, does point to the fact that "the origin of our culture's text for the body, and particularly the female body, is the work of Descartes".&lt;ref&gt;Bordo, ''The Flight to Objectivity'', p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--is this an error? maybe should be Hekman p62--&gt; The Cartesian division of the mind and the body, where the body is the "prison that the mind must escape to achieve knowledge",&lt;ref&gt;Hekman, "Material Bodies", p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; guides Bordo's further analyses of culturally influenced bodies and the shaping of the female body in particular.

===''Unbearable Weight: Feminism, Western Culture, and the Body'' (1993)===
Bordo's ''Unbearable Weight'' presents a collection of essays that focus on the body's situatedness and construction in Western Society and offers "a cultural approach to the body".&lt;ref name=uw35/&gt; Bordo looks at "obsessive body practices of contemporary culture" and claims that her aim "is not to portray these [[obsessions]] as bizarre or anomalous, but, rather, as the logical (if extreme) manifestations of anxieties and fantasies fostered by our culture".&lt;ref&gt;Bordo, ''Unbearable Weight'', p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Practices such as [[cosmetic surgery]], obsessive [[dieting]] and [[physical training]] represent, for Bordo, how cultural "representations homogenize" and how "these homogenized images normalize".&lt;ref&gt;Bordo, ''Unbearable Weight'', p. 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Unbearable Weight'' also traces the connection between culture and female disorders and Bordo emphasizes the fact that disorders such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia cannot simply be defined from [[medical]] and [[psychological]] standpoints but must be viewed from within a cultural context, as "complex crystallizations of culture".&lt;ref name=uw35/&gt; It is through such female disorders that resistance to dominant [[ideological]] constructs are seemingly played out; however, such a resistance reveals the devastating effects of culture on the contemporary female body. In 2003, the tenth anniversary reissue edition of ''Unbearable Weight'' was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize after its original release date. In the reissue of the book, Bordo considers the cultural images of the female body within the framework of the patriarchy, contemporary feminism, and postindustrial capitalism. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The encyclopedia of literary and cultural theory|last=Waters|first=Melanie|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell Publishing|year=2011|isbn=9781405183123|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Twilight Zones: The Hidden Life of Cultural Images from Plato to O.J.'' (1997)===
''Twilight Zones'' represents Bordo's continued preoccupation and study of cultural images and their saturation within contemporary culture. She utilizes [[Plato]]'s [[parable of the cave]], where images are projected onto the back of the cave presenting the illusion of a [[reality]] its inhabitants identify with and accept as real, claiming that such a [[metaphor]] depicts a particular contemporary concern. She writes that "[f]or us, bedazzlement by created images is no metaphor; it is the actual condition of our lives".&lt;ref&gt;Bordo, ''Twilight Zones'', p. .&lt;/ref&gt; Bordo alludes to constructed images of bodily perfection in contemporary consumer culture such as the portrayal of reconstructed physical bodies in magazines and advertisements as presenting false ideals for the viewers who identify with such images and use them as standards for their own bodies and lives. She writes that "we need to rehabilitate the concept of "truth" for our time . . . focusing on helping the next generation learn to critically see through the illusions and mystifications of the image dominated culture they have grown up in".&lt;ref&gt;Bordo, ''Twilight Zones'', p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Twilight Zones'' also takes up, in various essays, the connection and conversation between academic and non-academic institutions,&lt;ref&gt;Bordo, ''Twilight Zones'', p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; for while not anti-academic herself, Bordo sees academic and intellectual thought as proclaiming itself "'outside' the cave of cultural mystification," as raised up onto "a loftier perch, scrutinizing the proceedings below".&lt;ref&gt;Bordo, ''Twilight Zones'', p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Bordo wants to "bring theory down to earth".&lt;ref&gt;Bordo, ''Twilight Zones'', p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Male Body: A New Look at Men in Public and in Private'' (1999)===
With ''The Male Body'' Bordo shifts her focus from looking specifically at female and feminized bodies to looking at the male body from a female perspective. She includes analyses of the male body that take into consideration the representation of the male body in [[popular culture|popular cultural]] modes of communication such as movies, advertisements and [[literature]], revealing how anxieties over bodily form and beauty are not limited to women but are of concern for men also. She also analyzes attitudes surrounding the [[penis]] and [[gay]] culture in the twentieth century.

=== ''The Creation of Anne Boleyn'' (2014) ===
In ''The Creation of Anne Boleyn,'' Bordo seeks to break down the “sedimented mythology turned into ‘history’ by decades of repetition” and rewrite Boleyn's story as an ambitious woman seeking power without the cache of distorted imagery around her appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/15/books/the-creation-of-anne-boleyn-by-susan-bordo.html|title=For One Royal History Has Added Insult to Injury|last=Schuessler|first=Jennifer|date=April 14, 2013|work=The New York Times|access-date=October 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Destruction of Hillary Clinton'' (2017)===
Bordo examines why "… the most qualified candidate ever to run for president lost the seemingly unloseable election."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bordo|first1=Susan|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2017/apr/03/the-destruction-of-hillary-clinton-sexism-sanders-and-the-millennial-feminists/|title=The destruction of Hillary Clinton: sexism, Sanders and the millennial feminists|publisher=The Guardian|date=April 3, 2017|accessdate=April 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the first Filipino and Southeast Asian to win an Olympic medal, and the only Filipino to win multiple medals.

==Biography==
Born in Sitio Bayog, Bgy.4, Bimmanga, [[Piddig, Ilocos Norte|Piddig]], [[Ilocos Norte]], he began swimming at the Guisit River as a small boy. He started competing in 1921 and collected a total of 144 medals over the next 16 years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120306160643/http://ilocostimes.com/feb06-mar05-06/news_9.htm Lt.Teofilo Yldefonso’s monument unveiled]. ilocostimes.com. February 19, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; He won two bronze medals in the 200 m breaststroke event, at the 1928 and 1932 Olympics, and placed 7th in 1936.

During World War II, Yldefonso fought against the Japanese in [[Bataan]] as part of the [[Philippine Scouts]]. He survived the [[Bataan Death March]], but later died at the Capas Concentration Camp.&lt;ref name="WWII"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/friv/lists.cgi?id=65 |title=Olympians Who Were Killed or Missing in Action or Died as a Result of War |accessdate=24 July 2018 |work=Sports Reference}}&lt;/ref&gt; His remains have never been recovered.&lt;ref name=sportsheroes&gt;{{cite news|last1=Alinea|first1=Eddie|title=Sports Heroes who displayed true heroism during the war|url=http://www.mst.com.ph/sports/149340/sports-heroes-who-displayed-true-heroism-during-the-war.html|accessdate=5 March 2016|publisher=The Standard|date=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
He was named as part of the Hall of Fame by the [[International Swimming Federation]] in 2009. Yldefonso's unorthodox style in swimming which would be later known as the "Yldefonso Stroke" has been adapted by pint-sized swimmers, especially those from Asia, particularly the Japanese.&lt;ref name=sportsheroes/&gt;

Teófilo Yldefonso also had a daughter named Norma Yldefonso which would compete at the 2nd Asian Games held in Manila, Philippines and won a silver medal in the 100m butterfly event.

'''Uziel "Uzi" Gal''' ({{lang-he-n|עוזיאל "עוזי" גל}}, born '''Gotthard Glas'''; 15 December 1923 &amp;ndash; 7 September 2002), was a [[History of the Jews in Germany|German-born]] [[Israel|Israeli]] gun designer, best remembered as the designer and namesake of the [[Uzi]] submachine gun.

==Biography==
Gal was born in [[Weimar]], Germany to Mile and [[Erich Glas]]. When the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] came to power in 1933 he moved first to the [[United Kingdom]] and later, in 1936, to [[Kibbutz]], [[Yagur]] in the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] where he changed his name to Uziel Gal. In 1943, he was arrested for illegally carrying a gun and sentenced to six years in prison. However, he was pardoned and released in 1946, serving less than half of his sentence.&lt;ref name=tommy&gt;{{cite book|title =Tommy Gun: How General Thompson's Submachine Gun wrote History |page=263|first= Bill |last=Yenne |publisher= Macmillan|year= 2009 |ISBN=9780312383268 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gal began designing the [[Uzi]] submachine gun shortly after the founding of Israel and the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]]. In 1951, it was officially adopted by the [[Israel Defense Forces]] and was called the [[Uzi]] after its creator. Gal did not want the weapon to be named after him but his request was ignored. In 1955, he was decorated with [[Israeli Military decorations#Citations (Tzalash)|Tzalash HaRamatkal]] and in 1958, Gal was the first person to receive the Israel Security Award, presented to him by [[Prime Minister of Israel|Prime Minister]] [[David Ben-Gurion]] for his work on the Uzi.

Gal retired from the IDF in 1975, and the following year moved to the [[United States]]. He settled in [[Philadelphia]] so that his daughter, Tamar, who had serious [[brain damage]], could receive extended medical treatment there.

In the early 1980s, Gal assisted in the creation of the [[Ruger MP9]] submachine gun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.janes.com/articles/Janes-Police-and-Homeland-Security-Equipment/Sturm-Ruger-MP-9-9-mm-sub-machine-gun-United-States.html|title=Sturm Ruger MP-9 9 mm sub-machine gun (United States), Sub-machine guns|publisher=[[Jane's Information Group]]|accessdate=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gal continued his work as a firearms designer in the United States until his death from [[cancer]] in 2002.  His body was flown back to [[Yagur]], [[Israel]] for burial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date= 9 September 2002|title=Inventor of Uzi gun dies|publisher=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/2246368.stm|accessdate=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Publius Vedius Pollio''' (died 15 BC) was a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] of [[equestrian (Roman)|equestrian]] rank, and a friend of the Roman emperor [[Augustus]], who appointed him to a position of authority in the [[Roman province|province]] of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]]. In later life he became known for his luxurious tastes and cruelty to his [[slavery in ancient Rome|slaves]] &amp;ndash; when they displeased him, he had them fed to [[lampreys]] that he maintained for that purpose, which was deemed to be an exceedingly cruel act. When Vedius tried to apply this method of execution to a slave who broke a crystal cup, Emperor Augustus (Pollio's guest at the time) was so appalled that he not only intervened to prevent the execution but had all of Pollio's valuable drinking vessels deliberately broken. This incident, and Augustus's demolition of Vedius's mansion in Rome he inherited in his will, were frequently referred to in antiquity in discussions of ethics and of the public role of Augustus.

==Biography==
Publius Vedius Pollio, the son of a [[freedman]], was born in the 1st century BC and attained membership of the [[equestrian (Roman)|equestrian]] order.&lt;ref name=dio&gt;[[Cassius Dio|Dio]] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/54*.html#23 54.23.1].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cil&gt;''Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum'' [http://compute-in.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/pls/epigr/epiergebnis?p_belegstelle=CIL+09,+01556 9.1556] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170508010101/http://compute-in.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/pls/epigr/epiergebnis?p_belegstelle=CIL%2009%2C%2001556 |date=2017-05-08 }}, translated by Braund, no. 431.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vedius Pollio's first certain appearance in historical sources comes after [[Augustus|Octavian]] (later Augustus) became sole ruler of the Roman world in 31 BC; at some point Vedius held authority in the [[Roman province|province]] of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]] on behalf of the emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Syme, p. 28. A [[proconsul]] of Asia under [[Claudius]] cited an enactment of Vedius Pollio, confirmed by Augustus, as a precedent (Braund, no. 586).&lt;/ref&gt; For a mere equestrian to govern this province was anomalous, and there were presumably special circumstances; Vedius' term of office could have been in 31&amp;ndash;30 BC before the appointment of a regular [[proconsul]]ar governor, or after a major [[earthquake]] in 27 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Syme, p. 28; Momigliano ''et al.'', p. 1584.&lt;/ref&gt; He later returned to Rome, and when Alexander and [[Aristobulus IV|Aristobulus]], the sons of [[Herod the Great]], came to the city in about 22 BC, they may have stayed with him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]], ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' [http://pace.cns.yorku.ca/York/york/showText?book=15&amp;chapter=10&amp;chunkId=342&amp;text=anti&amp;version=whiston 15.343] says they stayed in "the house of Pollio", which could refer to either Vedius or [[Gaius Asinius Pollio (consul 40 BC)|Asinius Pollio]]. See Syme, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these services to the state, it was for his reputed [[wikt:luxury|luxury]] and [[cruelty]] that Vedius would become best known.&lt;ref name=dio/&gt; He owned a massive [[villa]] at [[Posillipo]] on the [[Gulf of Naples]],&lt;ref&gt;Pausilypon, the imperial villa near Naples,  R. T. GUNTHER, OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS, 1913&lt;/ref&gt; later described by the poet [[Ovid]] as "like a city".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'' [http://www.tonykline.co.uk/PITBR/Latin/OvidFastiBkSix.htm#_Toc69368011 6.641].&lt;/ref&gt; Most notoriously, he kept a pool of [[lamprey]]s into which [[slavery in ancient Rome|slaves]] who incurred his displeasure would be thrown as food&lt;ref&gt;Dio [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/54*.html#23.2 52.23.2]; [[Pliny the Elder]], ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plin.+Nat.+9.39 9.39]; [[Seneca the Younger]], ''On Clemency'' 1.18.2.&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; a particularly unpleasant means of death, since the lamprey "clamps its mouth on the
victim and bores a dentated tongue into the flesh to ingest blood".&lt;ref&gt;Africa, p. 71, citing {{cite book |author=M. W. Hardisty |author2=I. C. Potter  |title=The Biology of Lampreys |year=1971 |publisher=New York |pages=vol. I, pp. 147&amp;ndash;161 |isbn=0-12-324801-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, he retained, at least for a while, the friendship of Augustus, in whose honour he built a [[shrine]] or [[monument]] at [[Benevento|Beneventum]].&lt;ref name=cil/&gt; On one occasion, Augustus was dining at Vedius' home when a [[cup-bearer]] broke a crystal glass. Vedius ordered him thrown to the lampreys, but the slave fell to his knees before Augustus and pleaded to be executed in some more humane way. Horrified, the emperor had all of Vedius's expensive glasses smashed and the pool filled in. According to [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], Augustus also had the slave freed; [[Cassius Dio|Dio]] merely remarks that Vedius "could not punish his servant for what Augustus also had done".&lt;ref&gt;Seneca the Younger, ''On Anger'' 3.40 (= Braund, no. 432); Dio [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/54*.html#23.2 52.23.2&amp;ndash;4].&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Napoli - Parco archeologico del Pausilypon9.jpg|thumb|Villa of Vedius Pollio, Posillipo]]
There are a number of less certain appearances that may be the same Vedius Pollio. A Vidius or Vedius, possibly the same, is mentioned in a letter of 46 BC as involved in a dispute with the scholar-politician [[Curtius Nicias]].&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Letters to Friends'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Cic.+Fam.+9.10 9.10]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Syme, pp. 25-26, 28.&lt;/ref&gt; As well, [[Ronald Syme]] suggests that the "Publius Vedius" who appears in [[Cicero]]'s letters as a friend of [[Pompey]] may also be Vedius Pollio.&lt;ref name=Syme2330&gt;Syme, p. 23-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero, governor of [[Cilicia]], was travelling near [[Laodicea Combusta|Laodicea]] in 50 BC, when Publius Vedius met him with a large retinue, and several [[onager|wild asses]] and a [[baboon]] in a [[chariot]]. Unimpressed, Cicero wrote to [[Titus Pomponius Atticus|Atticus]], "I never saw a more worthless man."&lt;ref name=CiceroAtticus&gt;Cicero, ''Letters to [[Titus Pomponius Atticus|Atticus]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Cic.+Att.+6.1 6.1].&lt;/ref&gt;  About this possible Vedius Pollio, Cicero adds a further anecdote: Publius Vedius, earlier, had left some items with Vindulus, who meanwhile had died. Vindulus's heir later examined the items and found five portrait-busts of married ladies, including the noted patrician [[Junia Secunda]]. Cicero took these to be trophies of Vedius' sexual conquests,&lt;ref name=Syme2330/&gt; and, while highly praising her publicly,&lt;ref name = "bill"&gt;Smith, William, ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman biography and mythology, Volume 2'', Little and Brown, 1846, p. 657.&lt;/ref&gt; in correspondence, criticizing her for the indiscretion,&lt;ref name=CiceroAtticus/&gt;&lt;ref name=Syme2330/&gt; and her husband and brother for their lack of awareness of her conduct.&lt;ref&gt;Cic. ad Att. vi. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hall, John, ''Politeness and Politics in Cicero's Letters'', Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; (At the same time, an affair, if it did occur, may have been with a sister [[Junia Secunda|Junia Prima]].&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ad Atticum, vi. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Vedius died in 15 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Dio, Roman History, LIV.23&lt;/ref&gt; Among his many heirs, Augustus received a large part of Vedius's estate, including his villa at Posillipo, along with instructions to erect a suitable monument on the site. The emperor demolished at least part of Pollio's house in Rome and constructed in its place a [[colonnade]], the ''[[Porticus of Livia]]'' in honour of his wife, which he dedicated in 7 BC.&lt;ref&gt;http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/wine/pollio.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dio [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/54*.html#23.5 52.23.5&amp;ndash;6],[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/55*.html#8.2 55.8.2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Fasti'' [http://www.tonykline.co.uk/PITBR/Latin/OvidFastiBkSix.htm#_Toc69368011 6.639&amp;ndash;648].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Vedius's treatment of his slaves and Augustus's conduct towards him became popular subjects for anecdotes in antiquity. During or shortly after Augustus's reign, [[Ovid]] praised his demolition of Vedius's house as a grand statement against immoral luxury made even at the emperor's own cost.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Fasti'' [http://www.tonykline.co.uk/PITBR/Latin/OvidFastiBkSix.htm#_Toc69368011 6.645&amp;ndash;648].&lt;/ref&gt;    Scott notes that in replacing the house with a public monument Augustus merely "carried out the terms of the will", and argues that any suggestion he wished to censure Vedius's memory may have been mere "gossip".&lt;ref&gt;Scott, p. 460.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in the 1st century AD, Vedius's story was used by the [[philosopher]] [[Seneca the Younger]] and the [[encyclopedist]] [[Pliny the Elder]]. In two ethical treatises, Seneca used Vedius's treatment of the cup-bearer and Augustus's response to illustrate the extremes to which [[anger]] could lead and the need for [[clemency]].&lt;ref&gt;Seneca the Younger, ''On Anger'' 3.40 (= Braund, no. 432); ''On Clemency'' 1.18.2.&lt;/ref&gt;    Pliny the Elder mentioned Vedius's lampreys in his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' while treating varieties of fish, noting the man's friendship with Augustus while ignoring the story of the latter's clemency.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Elder, ''Natural History'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plin.+Nat.+9.39 9.39].&lt;/ref&gt;    Pliny was no admirer of Augustus and his handling of the story has been seen as "a gratuitous jibe" at the emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Africa, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;    In a highly rhetorical passage, the [[Christian]] writer [[Tertullian]] stated that after executing slaves, Vedius had his lampreys "cooked straight away, so that in their entrails he himself might have a taste of his slaves' bodies too".&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian, ''On the Mantle'' 5.6, translated [http://www.tertullian.org/articles/hunink_de_pallio.htm by Vincent Hunink].&lt;/ref&gt;

In several works, [[Adam Smith]] cited Augustus's intervention to save the cup-bearer in support of an argument that the condition of slaves was better under a monarchy than a democracy. He embellished the story by claiming that Augustus [[manumission|manumitted]] all of Vedius's slaves, a statement not based on any ancient source, in one 1763 lecture even estimating the value of the property their master thus lost.&lt;ref&gt;Africa, pp. 73&amp;ndash;74.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vela Blagoeva''' ({{lang-bg|Вела Благоева}}) (1859–1921) was a [[Bulgaria]]n writer, journalist and teacher and is noted as one of the founders of the women's movement in Bulgaria. After completing a basic education in the Ottoman Empire, she taught until she received a scholarship to further her education in Russia. While taking courses in the Russian [[normal school]] and [[pedagogy]] training courses, she became a socialist. Returning to Bulgaria, she taught school and wrote editorials for a wide number of publications. In 1901, she joined with a group of feminists to found the [[Bulgarian Women's Union]]. Two years later, she organized the first Socialist women's organization and conference held in Bulgaria.

==Biography==
Victoria Atanasova Zhivkova was born on 29 September 1859 in [[Tarnovo]], in [[Ottoman Bulgaria]] to Neda Spiridonova and Atanas Zhivkov. She was the youngest of five children,{{sfn|Daskalova|2006|p=62}} including sisters, Mariola and Rose,{{sfn|Герчева|2011}} and brothers, {{Interlanguage link multi|Georgi Zhivkov|bg|3=Георги Живков}} who was a politician and served three times as head of the National Assembly of Bulgaria,{{sfn|Nenieto|2015}} and [[Nikola Zhivkov]], founder of the first kindergarten in Bulgaria and poet who wrote the lyrics of the national anthem, [[Shumi Maritsa]].{{sfn|''Борба''|2013}} Their father died while the children were young and her older brothers took responsibility for raising the family.{{sfn|Недева|2013}} She finished the middle school for girls in Tarnovo and went to high school in [[Gabrovo]],{{sfn|Daskalova|2006|p=62}} graduating from the Gabrovo Girls' School in 1871. She became a teacher and taught in  [[Berkovitsa]], [[Istanbul]], Tarnovo and [[Varna]]. In 1874, Zhivkova and her brother Nikola used their summer holiday to collect monies to build a girls' school and church in Varna. During the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)|Russo-Turkish War]], she served as a nurse at the 50th field hospital in [[Svishtov]]. When the war ended in 1878,{{sfn|Герчева|2011}} Zhivkova obtained a scholarship from the Slavic Charity Committee of [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]]{{sfn|Daskalova|2006|p=62}} and began attending pedagogical courses at the Mariinsky high school for girls, graduating in 1881.{{sfn|Герчева|2011}} She returned to Bulgaria and taught in [[Edirne]] and later in [[Bitolia]]. Returning to Russia, between 1882 and 1884, she studied in St. Petersburg taking the [[Bestuzhev Courses]] to earn a teaching degree. While in Russia, she was influenced by the student protests against the [[tsarist autocracy]]{{sfn|Daskalova|2006|p=62}} and met [[St. Petersburg University]] student [[Dimitar Blagoev]], whom she married.{{sfn|Герчева|2011}}

===Career===
Blagoeva returned to [[Sofia]] in 1884 and began teaching at the Sofia Exemplary Girls' School. In July 1885,{{sfn|Герчева|2011}} she established with Dimitar the first socialist journal in Bulgaria, ''Modern Trends'' ({{lang-bg|Съвременний показател}}) which they co-edited. She wrote articles about discrimination against teachers, equality and women's education.{{sfn|Daskalova|2006|p=63}} For the duration of the [[Serbo-Bulgarian War]] she volunteered as a nurse at [[Slivnitsa]] and [[Pirot]].{{sfn|Герчева|2011}} Because of her outspoken political ideology and support for [[Socialism]], Blagoevna was repeatedly transferred or dismissed from teaching posts. Between 1884 and 1912, she taught in a succession of schools in Sofia (1884–1885), [[Shumen]] (1886–1887), [[Vidin]] (1897–1890), Veliko Tarnovo (1890–1892), [[Stara Zagora]] (1892–1893), Plovdiv (1893–1896), [[Tulcea|Tulcha]] (1901–1902), Plovdiv (1902–1903), Sofia (1905–1907) and [[Trastenik|Marashki Trustenik]] (1907–1912).{{sfn|Daskalova|2006|p=63}} In 1912, she had health issues and though she retired from teaching, she continued with other endeavors.{{sfn|Герчева|2011}}

In 1894, Blagoeva began the magazine ''Case'' ({{lang-bg|Дело}}) which was founded to disseminate socialist literary works of Bulgarian authors. She featured the poems by {{Interlanguage link multi|Kiril Hristov (poet)|bg|3=Кирил Христов|lt=Kiril Hristov}}, {{Interlanguage link multi|Dimitar Polyanov|bg|3=Димитър Полянов}} (1876-1953) and Ivan St. Andreychin (1872-1934), and prose from [[Anton Strashimirov]]. She edited the journal until 1896, when she was forced to suspend publication, primarily because of her husband's activities.{{sfn|Plovdivska Gimnaziia|2009}} In 1901, she was a co-founder of the first national women’s organization,  [[Bulgarian Women's Union]] ({{lang-bg|Български женски съюз}}) (BZhS){{sfn|Daskalova|2006|p=63}} along with [[Dimitrana Ivanova]], [[Ekaterina Karavelova]], [[Anna Karima]], [[Kina Konova]], [[Julia Malinova]], and others.{{sfn|Bulgarian Association of University Women|2010}} Two years later Blagoeva led the faction that split from the BZhS for ideological differences. She believed that the BzhS had become too focused on upper class women's issues alone and was not focused on the worker's needs. She founded a journal called ''Women's Labor'' ({{lang-bg|Дамски труда}}) where she began advocating for worker's rights.{{sfn|Daskalova|2006|p=63}}

In 1905, Blagoeva founded the first educational group for women workers which focused on a socialist message and by August of that year had organized a conference for socialist women in Sofia. These actions drew criticism, including from her husband, on the basis that male colleagues believed that women should remain part of the united workers movement. While she remained against attempts to unite all women under one umbrella organization, Blagoeva argued with male colleagues that women had the right to make their own decisions. While all of her writings were devoted to socialism, she wrote about women’s emancipation from the societal strictures of [[patriarchy]] and subordination and urged women's independence, equal education, paid labor, access to education and the abolition of punishment for prostitution. She published widely in newspapers and journals including ''Bulgarian collection'' ({{lang-bg|Bulgarska sbirka}}), ''Day'' ({{lang-bg|Den}}), ''Democratic review'' ({{lang-bg|Democraticheski pregled}}), ''Firefly'' ({{lang-bg|Svetulka }}), ''Just Deed'' ({{lang-bg|Pravo delo}}), ''New Times'' ({{lang-bg|Novo vreme}}), ''Red laughter'' ({{lang-bg|Cherven smjah}}), ''School review'' ({{lang-bg|Uchilishten pregled}}) and ''Teacher'' ({{lang-bg|Uchitel}}) and edited Deed ({{lang-bg|Delo}}), Women’s Bulletin ({{lang-bg|Zhenski Bjuletin}}).{{sfn|Daskalova|2006|p=64}} Often her earnings, due to her husband's unemployment for his [[Dissident|dissidence]], were the sole support of their family.{{sfn|Daskalova|2006|p=65}}

{{primary sources|date=October 2015}}
'''Vortimer''' ([[Old Welsh]] Guorthemir, {{lang-cy|Gwerthefyr}}), also known as '''Saint Vortimer''' ({{lang-cy|Gwerthefyr Fendigaid}}, &lt;small&gt;{{abbr|lit.|Literally}}&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;"Vortimer the Blessed"), is a figure in [[Matter of Britain|British tradition]], a son of the 5th-century [[Britons (historical)|Britonnic]] ruler [[Vortigern]]. He is remembered for his fierce opposition to his father's [[Saxons|Saxon]] allies. In [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'', he overthrows his father and reigns as [[List of legendary kings of Britain|King of Britain]] for a brief period before his death restores Vortigern to power.

==Accounts==
Vortimer first appears in the 9th-century work known as the ''[[Historia Brittonum]]''. According to the ''Historia'', Vortigern allows Saxons under [[Hengest]] and [[Horsa]] to settle on the [[Isle of Thanet]], and offers them provisions in exchange for their service as mercenaries.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:History of the Britons|''Historia Brittonum]], ch. 31; 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Vortigern soon proves to be an "ignorant king", and the wily Hengest manipulates him into ceding over more land and allowing more settlers to come from [[Germania]].&lt;ref&gt;[[s:History of the Britons|''Historia Brittonum]], ch. 36–38.&lt;/ref&gt; After a dire period of Saxon encroachment, exacerbated by even more disgraceful behavior on Vortigern's part, Vortimer finally rises up against the Saxons. He pushes them back to Thanet, and meets them in four battles. At the third battle Horsa and Vortimer's brother [[Catigern]] are slain; at the fourth the Saxons are pushed back to sea.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:History of the Britons|''Historia Brittonum]], ch. 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, however, Vortimer dies. He asks his followers to bury him at the place where the Saxons first landed in Britain as a totem against further invasion. However, his followers fail to heed his warning and the Saxons return.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:History of the Britons|''Historia Brittonum]], ch. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Welsh Triads]] his bones were buried "in the Chief Ports of this Island".&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Bromwich ''Trioedd Ynys Prydein'', 2nd edition (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1978) pp. 88-89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three of Vortimer's battle sites are named, and appear to have some correspondence with battles in Kent appearing in the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]''. The ''Chronicle'' does not name Vortimer, and in fact credit Vortigern as the British leader in one of the battles. 

The legendary material in the Historia Brittonum was slightly expanded upon in [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[Historia regum Britanniae]]'', a fictional account of the rulers of Britain. There the Britons abandon Vortigern and elevate Vortimer to be [[list of legendary kings of Britain|king of Britain]].  After he has driven out the Saxons, Vortimer is poisoned by his stepmother [[Rowena, Queen of Britain|Rowena]] (a Saxon) and Vortigern regains the crown.

'''Vril Dox''', also known as '''Brainiac 2''', is a fictional character published by [[DC Comics]]. He first appeared in ''[[Superman]]'' #167 (February 1964), and was created by [[Edmond Hamilton]], [[Cary Bates]], and [[Curt Swan]].

==Publication history==
He is the heir of [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]], one of [[Superman]]'s greatest foes. He is an ancestor of Querl Dox, [[Brainiac 5]] of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]. Vril Dox first appeared in ''[[Superman]]'' #167 (February 1964), by [[Edmond Hamilton]], [[Cary Bates]], and [[Curt Swan]], in a story entitled "The Deadly Duo! - The Team of Luthor and Brainiac!". He was later resurrected in ''[[Invasion! (DC Comics)|Invasion!]]'' #1 (January 1989), by [[Keith Giffen]], [[Bill Mantlo]], and [[Todd McFarlane]]. However, rather than being the adopted son of [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]], due to changes in Post-''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]]'' continuity, he is now a clone of Brainiac.

He went on to star in ''L.E.G.I.O.N. '89'' (February 1989) through ''L.E.G.I.O.N. '94'' (September 1994) by [[Keith Giffen]], [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]], and [[Barry Kitson]]. He returned in the follow-up series ''R.E.B.E.L.S. '94'' (October 1994) through ''R.E.B.E.L.S. '96'' (March 1996) by [[Tom Peyer]] and Arnie Jorgensen, and the subsequent series ''R.E.B.E.L.S.'' (2009-2011).

==Fictional character biography==

===Silver Age===
Vril Dox was a young Coluan who was [[adopted]] by the Computer Tyrants of Colu and declared Brainiac's son (Brainiac 2). He escaped and led a rebellion against the Computer Tyrants which overthrew their rule.&lt;ref&gt;As seen in ''Superman'' #167 (February 1964)&lt;/ref&gt; He later appeared briefly in the ''Secrets of the Legion of Super-Heroes'' miniseries.  His descendants (who had inherited long Coluan lifespans) were his son Pran Dox (Brainiac 3), his grandson Kajz Dox (Brainiac 4) and ultimately his great-grandson Querl Dox, [[Brainiac 5]] of the [[Legion of Super Heroes]].&lt;ref&gt;As seen in ''Secrets of the Legion of Super-Heroes'' #2 (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Crisis===

====''Invasion!''====
{{main|Invasion! (DC Comics)}}
Vril Dox II is a now a clone of Vril Dox (Brainiac), rather than his adopted son, as he is created by Vril Dox himself. He is still regarded as Brainiac's "[[heir]]", as he has inherited the original's high intelligence and [[Machiavelli]]an ethics.

====''L.E.G.I.O.N. '89-94''====
{{main|L.E.G.I.O.N.}}
Vril Dox is the founder of the interplanetary police force [[L.E.G.I.O.N.|Licensed Extra Governmental Interstellar Operatives Network]] (abbreviated as L.E.G.I.O.N., an acronym suggested by Strata but accepted by Dox). It was founded through outright murder when Vril and his allies destroyed a criminal drug ring. Chief Dox tries to manipulate everyone he came across, not generally accepting when they did not follow his plans. He manages to gain control of the bounty hunter [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]]. This is partly by outsmarting and outfighting Lobo and taking advantage of one of the bounty hunter's simple ethics; that he never breaks his word.

Vril leads the Earth's heroes in the 1992 ''Annual'' crossover, they travel to the moon and defeat the [[Eclipso]] entity.

====''R.E.B.E.L.S. '94-96''====
{{main|R.E.B.E.L.S.}}
Vril had a son named Lyrl Dox (Brainiac 3) who rebelled and took over his organization. Vril later regains control of L.E.G.I.O.N by bartering with the demon [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]]. The deal is for the soul of one of his unborn offspring.  After the cancellation of the title, he would only occasionally appear in the more cosmic DCU titles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cosmicteams.com/legion/l-e-g-i-o-n/vrildox.htm&lt;/ref&gt; For example, he appears in the [[Adam Strange#Planet Heist|2004 Adam Strange miniseries]], using robotic soldiers to hunt Strange. Dox, now missing his hair, incorrectly believes Rann had been destroyed at the hands of Strange. Dox's forces assist in the limited series ''[[Infinite Crisis]]''.

====''R.E.B.E.L.S.'' (2009-2011)====
A new 2009 series features [[Starro]] the Conqueror taking control of a now completely automated L.E.G.I.O.N. Dox, along with his old compatriot, Strata, must form a new team to regain his former status. During the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' crossover, Dox comes into contact with the mother of his son, who had recently been killed by L.E.G.I.O.N. drones, and was subsequently revived as a [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]]. Dox was also in an area in which a [[Sinestro Corps]] member was murdered by another Black Lantern. When the ring started to search for a new host, it selected Dox, making him a member of the Sinestro Corps.&lt;ref&gt;''R.E.B.E.L.S.'' (vol. 2) #10&lt;/ref&gt; However, not even the power of the ring was a match for the Black Lanterns, forcing Dox to teleport them to [[Starro]]'s homeworld, despite the fact that his son, Lyrl (who had recently had his intelligence restored by the warlord) was there also. Soon after, the ring rejected Dox, who had repeatedly refused [[Sinestro]]'s mandate that all members of the Sinestro Corps were to gather at Korugar, and declared that he had been discharged from the Corps.&lt;ref&gt;''R.E.B.E.L.S.'' (vol. 2) #11&lt;/ref&gt;

R.E.B.E.L.S. helped to save the Vega system and several galaxies by defeating Starro the Conqueror. The plight of Rann's people was soon resolved by Vril Dox, seeking to restore his reputation after [[Starro]] the Conqueror stole L.E.G.I.O.N. from him and used it to enslave its client worlds. Dox Zeta-beamed Rann into the Vega system, in the orbit previously held by the now destroyed planet [[Tamaran]], and proceeded to terraform Rann and make it suitable to sustain life again.

The restoration of the planet Rann was not Dox's only reason for relocating it into the Vega system. First, by putting [[Rann]] into Tamaran's orbit, it restored the gravitional balance to the Vega system, which had been thrown off by Tamaran's destruction. Secondly, in exchange for restoring their planet, the people of Rann agreed to let Dox rebuild L.E.G.I.O.N. headquarters on Rann.

Tamaranian refugees, led by [[Blackfire (DC Comics)|Blackfire]], attacked Rann believing that since the planet was in Tamaran's orbit they had claim to it. The violence was ended when Vril Dox, who was off-world at the start of the conflict, arrived with Thanagarian warships and stopped the fighting without bloodshed on either side. As it turned out, Dox was off-world negotiating an official end to the [[Rann-Thanagar War]], using Rann's new-found distance from [[Thanagar]] and change in leadership on both sides as leverage.

Dox then went on to mediate the tension between the Rannians and the Tamaranians by proposing that the Tamaranians live on Rann's uninhabited southern continent.

Dox, [[Adam Strange]] and other senior commanders of L.E.G.I.O.N. also ensured peace with the Green Lantern Corps and helped create an alliance between Rannians, Tamaranians and L.E.G.I.O.N. after defeating Starro the Conqueror, ensuring security for Rann, the Vega system and the galaxy, with Dox becoming consort to Blackfire.

===''The New 52''===
In ''Superman Annual'' Vol. 3 #2 Vril Dox is shown to be Brainiac's original identity.&lt;ref&gt;''Superman Annual'' Vol. 3 #2 (September 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rebirth===
When Brainiac's home planet of Colu falls under the threat of four beings that escaped the Source Wall at the end of ''Dark Nights: Metal'', the teams of heroes and villains realize that their armor is pulling them into four teams towards four different energy sources in the form of trees that coincide with the four entities. Batman's team finds Vril Dox, who claims that his father would never put his faith in the Earth heroes, as he only needed their powers to save Colu, but his plan required him at every step. With Brainiac's death at the hands of Amanda Waller, the planet of Colu and Earth are doomed.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League: No Justice'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other versions==
Vril is visited by the time-traveling entity named Waverider, a man on a mission to see which modern-day heroic figure might become a tyrant in ten years' time.

'''William Brocius''' (1845 – March 24, 1882),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lowe|first1=Sam|title=Speaking Ill of the Dead Jerks in Arizona History|date=2012|publisher=Globe Pequot Press|location=Guilford, Conn.|isbn=9780762783755|page=25|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BI3KMhASEMwC&amp;pg=PA25|accessdate=8 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; better known as '''Curly Bill Brocius''', was a [[gunslinger|gunman]], [[cattle raiding|rustler]]  and an [[outlaw]] [[The Cowboys (Cochise County)|Cowboy]] in the [[Cochise County, Arizona|Cochise County]] area of the [[Arizona Territory]] during the early 1880s. His name is likely an alias or nickname, and some evidence links him to another outlaw named William "Curly Bill" Bresnaham, who was convicted of an 1878 attempted robbery and murder in [[El Paso, Texas]].

Brocius had a number of conflicts with the lawmen of the [[Earp family]], and he was named as one of the individuals who participated in [[Morgan Earp]]'s assassination. [[Deputy U.S. Marshal]] [[Wyatt Earp]] and a group of deputies including his brother [[Warren Earp]] [[Earp Vendetta Ride|pursued]] those they believed responsible for Morgan's death. The Earp [[posse comitatus (common law)|posse]] unexpectedly encountered Curly Bill and other Cowboys on March 24, 1882, at [[Iron Springs (Cochise County, Arizona)|Iron Springs]] (present day Mescal Springs).  Wyatt killed Curly Bill during the shootout. In his journal written in October 1881, [[George W. Parsons|George Parsons]] referred to Brocius as "Arizona's most famous outlaw".

== Life in Arizona ==

Brocius arrived in Arizona Territory from either Texas or [[Missouri]] about 1878, and went briefly to the [[San Carlos Reservation]] with a herd of cattle, before arriving in the Arizona Territory.

Brocius was an [[The Cowboys (Cochise County)|Outlaw Cowboy]] and a [[cattle raiding|rustler]], and was for a time also a tax collector for Cochise County Sheriff [[Johnny Behan]], making other rustlers pay taxes on their stolen cattle (the money went into the sheriff's coffers and added to his salary).{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Brocius was known for a mean sense of humor when drunk. He was reported to have perpetrated such "practical jokes" as using gunfire to make a preacher "dance" during a sermon and making Mexicans at a community dance take off their clothes and dance naked. (Both incidents were reported by Wells Fargo agent Fred Dodge in his memoirs, and both incidents are alluded to in the newspapers of the time).&lt;ref name=eagle&gt;{{cite web |title=William "Curlys Bill" Brocius |url=http://www.eaglefreeenterprises.com/pictures/william_brocius.htm |accessdate=May 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

A unauthenticated photo of Brocius is displayed in the [[Bird Cage Theater]] Museum in Tombstone. Two other unauthenticated photos of Brocius have been provided by descendants. Several writers who knew Brocius reported that he was well-built with curly black hair and a freckled complexion.&lt;ref name=eaglefree&gt;{{cite web|title=About William "Curly Bill" Brocius|url=http://www.pictures.eaglefreeenterprises.com/william_brocius.htm|publisher=Eagle Free Enterprises|accessdate=October 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shooting of Fred White, 1880 ==

In a drunken revelry, some of Curly Bill's friends were firing pistols into the air on October 28, 1880,&lt;ref&gt;https://truewestmagazine.com/in-search-of-the-real-curly-bill/&lt;/ref&gt;  in a dark vacant lot between Toughnut and Allen Streets, near where the Birdcage Theater now stands. Tombstone's Town Marshal [[Fred White (marshal)|Fred White]] attempted to disarm Brocius and grabbed his weapon by the barrel. The gun discharged, striking White in the groin.&lt;ref name="barra"&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Barra | first1=Allen | title=Inventing Wyatt Earp: His Life and Many Legends | year=2008 | publisher=University of Nebraska Press | location=Lincoln, Nebraska | isbn=978-0-8032-2058-4 | page=440}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|117}} Wyatt Earp had borrowed Fred Dodge's pistol and he [[pistol-whipping|pistol-whipped]] Brocius. At the preliminary hearing for Brocius afterward, Wyatt testified that he had heard White say: "I am an officer; give me your pistol." When he got close, he saw Brocius remove his pistol from his scabbard and White grab it by the barrel. He said he put his arms around Brocius from behind to see if he had any other weapons, and White "gave a quick jerk and the pistol went off." White fell to the ground, wounded. When the pistol discharged, Wyatt [[pistol whipping|buffaloed]] Brocius and arrested him. Brocius complained, "What have I done? I have not done anything to be arrested for."&lt;ref name=text2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/az-tombstonehistoricaltext2.html|title=The Killing of Marshal Fred White|publisher=Legends of America|accessdate=May 27, 2011|date=December 27, 1880}} Quoted from the December 27, 1880 edition of the ''Arizona Daily Citizen''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brocius fearful of lynching ===

White was carried to a doctor and they initially thought he would recover, and the next day, he gave a statement that exonerated Curly Bill of murder, but that night, White's condition worsened.&lt;ref name=barra/&gt;{{rp|117}} Brocius later claimed that his gun discharged accidentally and reportedly immediately regretted shooting White. He testified at his trial that he did not consider himself to have committed a crime. Brocius waived his right to a preliminary hearing, apparently because he feared a [[Lynching in the United States|lynching]], as White was very popular as town marshal. Brocius was anxious to be moved out of town. [[Pima County, Arizona|Pima County]] Deputy Sheriff Earp and George Collins immediately took Brocius to Tucson for trial.

=== Brocius exonerated of White's death ===

White died two days after Curly Bill shot him. Before dying, White testified that he thought the pistol had accidentally discharged and that he did not believe that Curly Bill shot him on purpose. Wyatt Earp supported this testimony, (ironically, given his later vendetta against Brocius and the rest of the Cowboy gang) as did a demonstration that Brocius's pistol could be fired from half-cock, and the fact that it had been found to contain six rounds, with only one of them fired. After spending most of November and December 1880 in jail awaiting trial, Brocius was acquitted with a verdict of accidental death.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Wyatt told his biographer [[John H. Flood, Jr.]], many years later that he thought that Brocius was still armed at the time and did not notice that Brocius' pistol lay on the ground in the dark, until Brocius was already down.&lt;ref&gt;John H. Flood Manuscript, 1926, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being responsible for the deaths of several other men during his life, Brocius had apparently personally liked White{{Cn|date=September 2018}} and maintained that his death had been an accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wmicentral.com/news/apache_county/what-happened-to-william-graham-aka-curly-bill-brocius/article_86a07a50-6c01-5ce0-9458-ecedf64f055e.html|title=What happened to William Graham aka Curly Bill Brocius?|work=White Mountain Independent|access-date=2018-09-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outlaw Cowboy ==

Brocius was described by contemporary [[Billy Breakenridge]] in his book ''Helldorado: Bringing the Law to the Mesquite'' as being the most deadly pistol shot of the Cowboys, able to hit running jackrabbits, shoot out candle flames without breaking the candles or lantern holders, and shoot quarters from between the fingers of "volunteers". When drunk, Brocius was also known for a mean sense of humor and for such "[[practical joke]]s" as using gunfire to make a preacher "dance" during a sermon or forcing Mexicans at a community dance to take off their clothes and dance naked. [[Wells Fargo]] agent Fred Dodge reported both incidents in his memoirs, and both were alluded to in local newspapers.&lt;ref name=eaglefree/&gt;

=== Shoots Dick Lloyd ===

On March 8, 1881, Brocius and his friend [[Johnny Ringo]] rode to Maxey, near Camp Thomas, Arizona. Cowboy Dick Lloyd got drunk while playing poker in O'Neil and Franklin's [[Western saloon|saloon]]. After shooting and wounding one man, Lloyd rode his horse into the saloon where Brocius was drinking. Brocius and several other men resented the interruption, and about a dozen of them, including Brocius, shot and killed Lloyd. Owner O'Neil took the blame and was acquitted.&lt;ref name=nolan&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VRpiOdgkFDEC&amp;pg=PA472|last=Nolan |first=Frederick |title=The Lincoln County War: A Documentary History |year=2009|publisher=Sunstone Press |location=Santa Fe, NM |isbn=978-0-86534-721-2 |edition=Rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|472}}

=== Shot in face ===

On May 25, 1881, Brocius was drinking heavily in Galeyville with his friend of several months and [[Lincoln County War]] veteran Jim Wallace and eight or nine other cowboys. Wallace insulted Brocius' friend and ally, Tombstone Deputy Marshal [[Billy Breakenridge]].  Breakenridge ignored him, but Brocius took offense and insisted that Wallace accompany him and apologize to Breakenridge. Brocius threatened to kill him. Wallace complied, but Brocius afterward heaped abuse on Wallace, announcing, "You damned Lincoln County son of a bitch, I'll kill you anyhow." Wallace left the saloon and Curly Bill followed him. Feeling threatened, Wallace shot Curly Bill, wounding him in the cheek and neck.&lt;ref name="eagle"/&gt;

Marshal Breakenridge arrested Wallace, but the court ruled he acted in self-defense.&lt;ref name="eagle"/&gt;   Curly Bill may have first met [[Pony Diehl]] around this time, as well. Diehl was implicated in several Cowboy criminal activities later on.

=== Shooting of Haslett brothers ===

In July 1881, Bill Leonard and Harry Head attempted to rob William and Isaac Haslett's general store in [[Hachita Valley|Hachita, New Mexico]]. The Haslett brothers killed Leonard and Head during the hold-up. Some modern researchers state that Brocius and friend Johnny Ringo rode to New Mexico to avenge their friends' deaths and killed both Haslett brothers.&lt;ref name=mcloughlin/&gt; However, no witnesses to this crime were found nor to Curly Bill's involvement in the Hasletts' death.

Four months after Brocius was shot, on October 6, 1881, George Parsons rode through the McLaury brothers' ranch in [[Sulphur Springs Valley]] as part of an Indian scouting party, and noted that Brocius had not yet fully recovered from his wound, but was well enough to ride.&lt;ref name=text3&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legendsofamerica/az-tombstonehistoricaltext3.html |title=Tombstone, Arizona – Historical Accounts |publisher=Legends of America |accessdate=May 27, 2011 |date=May 26, 1880 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Quoted from the May 26, 1881 edition of the ''Arizona Daily Citizen''&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, many historians doubt that Brocius took part in killing William and Isaac Haslett.&lt;ref name=text3/&gt;

=== Participation in Skeleton Canyon Massacre ===

In July, some reports say that Brocius ambushed a Mexican trail herd in what became known as the [[Skeleton Canyon Massacre]]. Six'' [[cowboy|vaqueros]]'' were killed and the remainder captured, then possibly tortured and murdered.&lt;ref name=mcloughlin/&gt; Curly Bill reportedly sold the Mexican [[cattle|beef]] he stole to [[Newman Haynes Clanton]] the next month. When Old Man Clanton was on the trail herding the beef to Tombstone, four others and he were, in turn, ambushed in the [[Guadalupe Canyon Massacre]] and murdered by Mexicans. No contemporary reports of Curly Bill's involvement in these episodes were verified, and Brocius was not charged with any crimes related to these events.&lt;ref name=eagle/&gt;

Brocius was still recovering from being shot in the face by Wallace only six weeks earlier. Some modern researchers doubt that he was well enough to take part in these events.&lt;ref name=text3/&gt;

=== Assassination of Morgan Earp ===

Following the [[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral]] on October 26, 1881, Brocius robbed the Tombstone-[[Bisbee, Arizona|Bisbee]] stagecoach on January 6, 1882, and the Tombstone-[[Benson, Arizona|Benson]] stage the next day. Deputy U.S. Marshal Wyatt Earp gathered a posse and rode after the men, but was unable to find them in the [[Chiricahua Mountains]]. Brocius returned to Tombstone on March 17.&lt;ref name=mcloughlin/&gt; He was named by [[Pete Spence]]'s wife Marietta Duarte as a participant in the assassination of Morgan Earp. Justice of the Peace [[Wells Spicer]] disallowed her testimony because it was [[hearsay]] and because she could not testify against her husband. Lacking evidence, the prosecution dropped all charges against the Cowboys. Deputy U.S. Marshal Wyatt Earp killed outlaw Cowboy [[Frank Stilwell]] in Tucson on March 20, 1882, while guarding his brother Virgil en route to California.

== Death at Iron Springs ==

[[File:Whetstone Mountains, AZ.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The Whetstone Mountains]]
On March 24, 1882, the Earp party was expecting to meet Charlie Smith at [[Iron Springs (Cochise County, Arizona)|Iron Springs]] (later Mescal Springs), in the [[Whetstone Mountains]]. Charlie was bringing cash from Tombstone about {{convert|20|mi}} to the east to help pay posse expenses. As they surmounted the edge of a wash near the springs, they stumbled upon Brocius, [[Pony Diehl]], Johnny Barnes, Frank Patterson, Milt Hicks, Bill Hicks, Bill Johnson, Ed Lyle, and Johnny Lyle, cooking a meal alongside the spring.&lt;ref name="historynet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/wyatt-earps-vendetta-posse.htm|title=Wyatt Earp's Vendetta Posse|date=January 29, 2007|accessdate=February 18, 2011|publisher=HistoryNet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shootout with Wyatt Earp ===
According to Wyatt Earp — and an anonymous report to ''The Tombstone Epitaph''— he was in the lead of the posse when it suddenly came upon The Cowboys' camp less than 30 feet (9m) behind an embankment. Earp dismounted shotgun in hand, and seeing him The Cowboys seized their weapons. [[Texas Jack Vermillion]] remained cool under fire and stuck close to Wyatt during the fight. Lacking cover,  Doc, [[Jack Johnson (posseman)|Johnson]], and [[Sherman McMaster|McMasters]] retreated. [[Warren Earp]] was away on an errand at the time.

Eighteen months prior, Wyatt Earp had protected Brocius against a mob ready to lynch him for killing Town Marshal Fred White, and then provided testimony that helped spare him from a murder conviction. Now Brocius fired at Earp with his shotgun from about {{convert|50|ft}}, but missed, Earp returned fire with his own shotgun, killing Brocius with a load of buckshot to the stomach nearly cutting him in half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kjensli|first=Jan|title=Wyatt Earp – Wyatt Earp – man, life and legend|url=http://www.wyatt-earp.info/english/|accessdate=May 2, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323124602/http://www.wyatt-earp.info/english/|archivedate=March 23, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brocius fell into the water at the edge of the spring.&lt;ref name=shillingberg&gt;{{cite journal|title= Wyatt Earp and the Buntline Special Myth |url=http://www.kshs.org/p/kansas-historical-quarterly-wyatt-earp-and-the-buntline-special-myth/13255 | first=William B. |last= Shillingberg |date=Summer 1976 |volume= 42|number= 2|pages=113–154 |journal=Kansas Historical Quarterly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cowboys fired a number of shots at the Earp party. Texas Jack Vermillion's horse was struck and killed. Earp's long coat was punctured by bullets on both sides. Another bullet struck his boot heel and his saddle horn was hit, as well, burning the saddle hide and narrowly missing Wyatt. Firing his pistol, Earp shot Johnny Barnes in the chest and Milt Hicks in the arm. Vermillion tried to retrieve his rifle wedged in the scabbard under his fallen horse, exposing himself to the Cowboys' gunfire. Doc Holliday helped him gain cover. Earp had trouble remounting his horse due to a [[cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]] belt that had slipped down his legs. He was finally able to get on his horse and retreat. McMasters was grazed by a bullet that cut through the straps of his field glasses.&lt;ref name=historynet/&gt;

Earp biographer John Flood wrote that The Cowboys buried Brocius' body on the nearby ranch of Frank Patterson near the Babocomari River. This is close to the original McLaury ranch site about 5 miles (8&amp;nbsp;km) west of [[Fairbank, Arizona|Fairbank]] (before the McLaurys moved to the Sulphur Springs Valley in late 1880) and is believed to have originally belonged to Frank Stilwell.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Brocius's grave site has never been identified.

=== Proof of death ===

Fred J. Dodge, an undercover operative for [[Wells Fargo]] in Tombstone, asked Curly Bill's associates about his death. He wrote that he talked to "J. B. Ayers, a saloonkeeper of Charleston where the outlaws and rustlers headquartered, told me that the men who were in the fight told him that Wyatt Earp killed Curly Bill and that  they took the body away that night and that they buried him on Patterson's ranch on the Babocomari."&lt;ref name=curly/&gt; The Tombstone ''Nugget'' first put up a $1,000 reward for proof Curly Bill lived, and ''The Tombstone Epitaph'' countered with a $2,000 reward. Neither was ever collected.&lt;ref name=curly/&gt; Brocius was not wanted by the law in Arizona and if he was not dead had no reason to disappear. He also was unlikely to return to Texas, where according to Wyatt Earp's recollection, he was probably still wanted for murder.&lt;ref name=curly&gt;{{cite web|title=William Brocius Graham "Curly Bill" Wyatt Earp vs. Curly Bill|url=http://www.tombstonevigilantes.com/curly.aspx|publisher=Tombstone Vigilantes|accessdate=October 17, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023165752/http://www.tombstonevigilantes.com/curly.aspx|archive-date=October 23, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other names ==

Because of his nickname, "Curly Bill" Brocius has been confused with "Curly Bill" Graham, a different outlaw of the same geographical region and time period. Graham was killed in a gunfight by Deputy Sheriff James D. Houck on October 17, 1887, and buried in [[Young, Arizona]], and is not considered by historians to be the same Curly Bill of Charleston and Tombstone. Brocius' birth date, birth name, and birthplace are not known.&lt;ref name=eaglefree/&gt;

In newspapers of the time, Brocius was known alternately as "Curly Bill" and "Curley Bill." His surname has also been spelled as "Brocious", although the former is the spelling used for his maildrop in Arizona Territory, according to one published letter of the time.&lt;ref name=eaglefree/&gt;

=== Origins in Missouri ===

Historical research into Brocius' death turned up two possible earlier identities. Denis McLoughlin in ''The Encyclopedia of the Old West'' reports that Brocius was from Missouri and named William B. Graham.&lt;ref name=mcloughlin&gt;{{cite book|last=McLoughlin|first=Denis|title=The Encyclopedia of the Old West|year=1977|publisher=Routledge and Kegan Paul|location=London|isbn=978-0-7100-0963-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said Brocius rode for various Texas cow outfits and was known in Kansas.

=== Origins in Texas ===

While on the way to Tucson, Brocius asked Wyatt Earp to recommend an attorney. As reported in ''The Tombstone Epitaph'':&lt;ref name=gatto/&gt;

{{quote|The facts leaked out in this way: On the road to Tucson, Brocius asked Earp where he could get a good lawyer.  Earp suggested that Hereford &amp; Zabriskie were considered a good firm.  Broscius said that he didn't want Zabriskie, as he had prosecuted him once in Texas.}}

Wyatt looked into the story about Brocius' time in Texas and learned that Brocius had been convicted of robbery in El Paso, Texas, during which a man had been killed.  Zabriskie had prosecuted Brocius for the crime, and "he was tried and sentenced to the penitentiary, but managed to make his escape shortly after being incarcerated."&lt;ref name=text2/&gt;&lt;ref name=gatto&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gatto|first1=Steve|title=Arrests Curly Bill After Tombstone Marshal Fred White Is Shot|url=http://www.wyattearp.net/arrestscurly.html|accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''El Paso Daily Times'' speculated that he was the man whom Texas Ranger Thomas Mode shot in the right ear.&lt;ref&gt;(''El Paso Daily Times'', July 18, 1883)&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern researchers have linked Brocius with a man known as William "Curly Bill" Bresnaham, who was convicted in a robbery attempt in Texas in 1878, along with another known cowboy of the Tombstone area named Robert Martin. The men were convicted and sentenced to five years in prison, but both escaped, presumably to the southwest Arizona Territory. Since both Robert Martin and Curly Bill became known as leaders of the rustlers in Arizona Territory, they are likely the same Robert Martin and Curly Bill of the Texas crime.&lt;ref name=eaglefree/&gt;

According to historian [[Robert M. Utley]], Robert Martin was a member of the [[Jesse Evans]] gang of outlaws in [[New Mexico]] during the mid- to late 1870s. [[Billy the Kid]] briefly joined this group before going to work for [[John Tunstall]].&lt;ref name=eaglefree/&gt; Evans's gang, a loose-knit consortium of desperadoes known as [[Jessie Evans Gang|"The Boys"]], ended up fighting against the "Regulators" during the [[Lincoln County War]]. Because of the time frame, the location, and his friendship with Martin, Curly Bill Brocius may have been a member of the Evans gang, as well.&lt;ref name=eaglefree/&gt;

'''William Monsell, 1st Baron Emly''' [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|PC]] (21 September 1812 – 20 April 1894)&lt;ref name=CE&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Catholic Encyclopedia|edition=1|year=1913|article=William Monsell, Baron Emly}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NA&gt;{{cite book|title=Papers of William Monsell, 1817–1899|author=National Archives of Ireland|accessdate=4 April 2006|url=http://www.nationalarchives.ie/genealogy/Private_sources/Monsell.pdf|pages=2–4|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[Anglo-Irish]] landowner and [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] politician. He held a number of ministerial positions between 1852 and 1873, notably as [[Secretary of State for Health|President of the Board of Health]] in 1857 and as [[United Kingdom Postmaster General|Postmaster General]] between 1871 and 1873.

==Background and education==
Monsell was born to William Monsell (1778–1822), of Tervoe, [[Clarina Village|Clarina]], [[County Limerick]],&lt;ref name=NA/&gt; and Olivia, daughter of [[John Allen Johnson-Walsh|Sir John Johnson-Walsh, 1st Baronet]], of Ballykilcavan. He was educated at [[Winchester College|Winchester]] (1826–1830) and [[Oriel College, Oxford|Oriel College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], but he left the university without proceeding to a degree&lt;ref name=CE/&gt; in 1831&lt;ref name=NA/&gt; As his father had died in 1824, he succeeded to the family estates on [[coming of age]] and was a popular landlord, the more so as he was resident.&lt;ref name=CE/&gt; In 1843 he helped found [[St Columba's College, Dublin|St Columba's College]] in [[Whitechurch, County Dublin|Whitechurch]], now part of [[Dublin]].

==Political career==
[[File:William Monsell Vanity Fair 11 February 1871.jpg|thumb|left|"The painstaking Irishman"&lt;br/&gt;As depicted by "Ape" ([[Carlo Pellegrini (caricaturist)|Carlo Pellegrini]]) in [[Vanity Fair (British magazine 1868-1914)|Vanity Fair]], 11 February 1871]]
Monsell served as the Sheriff of [[County Limerick]] in 1835.&lt;ref name=NA/&gt; In 1847, he was elected Member of Parliament for [[Limerick County (UK Parliament constituency)|County Limerick]] as a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]], and represented the constituency until 1874. In 1850, he became a [[Roman Catholic]] and thereafter took a prominent part in Catholic affairs, especially in Parliament. As a friend of [[Nicholas Wiseman|Wiseman]], [[John Henry Newman|Newman]], Montalambert, [[W. G. Ward]], and other eminent Catholics, he was intimately acquainted with the various interests of the Church, and his parliamentary position was often of great advantage to the Church.&lt;ref name=CE/&gt;

In 1852 Monsell was appointed [[Clerk of the Ordnance]] by [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Lord Aberdeen]], a post he retained until 1857, the last two years under the premiership of [[Henry Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]]. In 1855 he was sworn of the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=21762 |date=14 August 1855 |page=3082 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was briefly [[Secretary of State for Health|President of the Board of Health]] under Palmerston in 1857 and later served under [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord Russell]] as [[Paymaster-General]] and [[Vice-President of the Board of Trade]] in 1866 and under [[William Ewart Gladstone]] as [[Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies]] between 1868 and 1871 and as [[United Kingdom Postmaster General|Postmaster-General]] between January 1871 and November 1873.&lt;ref name=CE/&gt; He was also [[Lord Lieutenant of Limerick|Lord Lieutenant of County Limerick]] between 1871 and 1894&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepeerage.com/p15873.htm#i158725 thepeerage.com William Monsell, 1st Baron Emly]&lt;/ref&gt; and Vice-Chancellor of the Royal University of Ireland between 1885 and 1894.&lt;ref name=NA/&gt;

On 12 January 1874 Monsell was raised to the peerage as '''Baron Emly''', of Tervoe in the County of Limerick.&lt;ref name=CE/&gt;&lt;ref name=NA/&gt; He lost much of his popularity in Ireland during his later years, because of his opposition to the [[Irish National Land League]] and to the [[devolution|home rule movement]] in Ireland. His work being chiefly parliamentary, he wrote little, but published some articles in the ''Home and Foreign Review'' and a "Lecture on the Roman Question" (1860).&lt;ref name=CE/&gt;

==Family==
Lord Emly was twice married. He married firstly Lady Anna Maria Charlotte Wyndham-Quin (1814–1855), only daughter of [[Windham Quin, 2nd Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl]], in August 1836,&lt;ref name=CE/&gt; with whom he had two sons, both of whom died in infancy. After her death on 7 January 1855,&lt;ref name=NA/&gt; he married Bertha (1835–1890), youngest daughter the Comte de Montigny of the house of Montigny de Perreux, in 1857, by whom he had one son Gaston (1858–1932), later the second Lord Emly, and one daughter Mary Olivia (1860–1942).&lt;ref name=CE/&gt;&lt;ref name=NA/&gt; Lord Emly died in April 1894, aged 81.

==Biography==
[[File:Yusuf al-Qaradawi.jpg|thumb|left|Al-Qaradawi, during his days at Azhari Institute at Tanta]]
{{Islamism sidebar|Key ideologues}}
Al-Qaradawi was born in 1926 in Saft Turab village in the [[Nile Delta]], now in [[Gharbia Governorate]], Egypt, into a poor family of devout Muslim peasants. He became an orphan at the age of two, when he lost his father. Following his father's death, he was raised by his uncle. He read and memorized the entire [[Quran]] by the time he was nine years old.

He then joined the Institute of Religious Studies at [[Tanta]], and graduated after nine years of study. While in Tanta, Al-Qaradawi first encountered [[Hassan al-Banna|Hassan al Banna]], the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood, when al Banna gave a lecture at his school. Al-Qaradawi has written of the lasting impact of this encounter, describing al Banna as "brilliantly radiating, as if his words were revelation or live coals from the light of prophecy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Ibn al-Qarya wa-l-Kuttab: Malamih Sira wa-Masira, Vol. 1|last = Al-Qaradawi|first = Yusuf|publisher = Dar al-Shorouq|year = 2002|isbn = |location = |pages = 245}}&lt;/ref&gt; He moved on to study Islamic Theology at the [[Al-Azhar Theological Seminary|Al-Azhar University]] in [[Cairo]], from which he graduated in 1953. He earned a diploma in Arabic Language and Literature in 1958 at the Advanced Arabic Studies Institute. He enrolled in the graduate program in the Department of Quran and [[Sunnah]] Sciences of the Faculty of Religion's Fundamentals (Usul al-Din), and graduated with a master's degree in Quranic Studies in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aawsat.com/english/news.asp?section=3&amp;id=13430 Al Qaradawi in Al Azhar] Asharq Aawsat 17 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, he was sent by Al-Azhar University to Qatar to head the Qatari Secondary Institute of Religious Studies. He completed his PhD thesis titled ''Zakah and its effect on solving social problems'' in 1973 with First Merit and was awarded his PhD degree from Al-Azhar.

In 1977, he laid the foundation for the Faculty of [[Shari'ah]] and [[Islamic Studies]] in the [[University of Qatar]] and became the faculty's dean. In the same year he founded the Centre of Seerah and Sunna Research.&lt;ref name="DubaiAward"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quran.gov.ae/en/DIHQAPrograms/IslamicPersonality/Pages/FourthSession.aspx|title=The Islamic Personality&gt; Fourth Session|publisher=Quran|accessdate=11 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|last=Abdelhadi|first=Magdi|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3874893.stm|title=Profile of Sheikh Yusuf Qaradawi|publisher=BBC News|date=7 July 2004|accessdate=11 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Al Qaradawi in Al Azhar"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hamed |first=Ayman |url=http://www.aawsat.com/english/news.asp?section=3&amp;id=13430|title=Al Qaradawi in Al Azhar |publisher=Aawsat.com |date=17 July 2008|accessdate=11 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="alowaisnet.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alowaisnet.org/en/winnersbio/abijjffgihfdfhfbej.aspx|title=Dr. Yousef Al Qaradhawi winner Cultural &amp; Scientific Achievements Sixth Circle 1998–1999|publisher=Alowais|accessdate=11 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also served at the Institute of Imams, Egypt under the [[Ministry of Awqaf (Egypt)|Egyptian Ministry of Religious Endowments]] as supervisor before moving back to Doha as Dean of the Islamic Department at the Faculties of Shariah and Education in [[Qatar]], where he continued until 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quran.gov.ae/en/News/Lists/News%20Center/DispForm.aspx?ID=82|title=Profile of Qaradawi|publisher=Quran|date=26 August 2009|accessdate=11 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His next appointment was in Algeria as Chairman of the Scientific Council of Islamic University and Higher Institutions in 1990–91. He returned to Qatar once more as Director of the Seerah and Sunnah Center at Qatar University, a post he still occupies today.&lt;ref name="Al Qaradawi in Al Azhar"/&gt;

In 1997, Al-Qaradawi helped found the [[European Council for Fatwa and Research]], a council of important and influential Muslim scholars dedicated to researching and writing fatwas in support of Western Muslim minority communities based in Ireland, and he serves as its head.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-cfr.org/en/ECFR.pdf The European Council for Fatwa and Research] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091123015220/http://www.e-cfr.org/en/ECFR.pdf |date=23 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also serves as the chairman of [[International Union for Muslim Scholars]] (IUMS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almisnad-rifaat.com/|title=Law Firms in Qatar, Law offices In Qatar, Legal Firms in Qatar|work=Al Misnad &amp; Rifaat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was imprisoned under [[Farouk of Egypt|King Farouq]] in 1949, then three times during the reign of former President [[Gamal Abdul Nasser]], until he left Egypt for Qatar in 1961.&lt;ref name="Al Qaradawi in Al Azhar"/&gt; He returned to Egypt in 2011 in the wake of the [[2011 Egyptian Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2011/0218/Egypt-revolution-unfinished-Qaradawi-tells-Tahrir-masses|title=Egypt Revolution Unfinished, Qaradawi Tells Tahrir Masses|publisher=[[Christian Science Monitor]] |date=18 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Qaradawi is a principal shareholder and former [[Sharia]] adviser to [[Al Taqwa Bank|Bank Al-Taqwa]], a member bank of the Lugano-Switzerland Al-Taqwa group, a bank that the U.S. states finances terrorism and that the UN Security Council had listed as associated with Al Qaeda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brusselsjournal.com/node/1898|title=Islamic Banking in Britain - The Brussels Journal|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 August 2010, the bank was removed from a list of entities and individuals associated with Al Qaeda maintained by the Security Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne%2BNews/World/Story/A1Story20100803-230121.html|title=10 Taliban taken off UN terror list|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/sc/committees/1267/consolidatedlist.htm The UN -The Consolidated List September 2009] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=https://www.un.org/sc/committees/1267/consolidatedlist.htm&amp;date=2010-02-05 |date=20100205000000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Qaradawi finished 3rd in a 2008 poll on who was the world's leading public intellectual. The poll, [[Top 100 Public Intellectuals Poll|Top 100 Public Intellectuals]], was of the readers of ''[[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect Magazine]]'' (UK) and ''[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]]'' (United States).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/prospect-100-intellectuals/ |title=Intellectuals |publisher=Prospectmagazine.co.uk |date=2009-10-14 |accessdate=2013-04-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930143349/http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/prospect-100-intellectuals/ |archivedate=30 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011 return to Egypt===
After the [[2011 Egyptian Revolution]], Qaradawi made his first public appearance in Egypt after 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/02/17/138093.html |title=Banned Qaradawi returns to lead Friday prayers in Egypt |publisher=Alarabiya.net |date=2011-02-17 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Tahrir Square]], he led Friday prayers on 18 February, addressing an audience estimated to exceed two million Egyptians.&lt;ref&gt;For a complete English translation, see: ''The Tahrir Square Sermon of Shaykh Yûsuf al-Qaradâwî''. Translation by Yahya M. Michot with the collaboration of Samy Metwally, on http://www.hartsem.edu/&lt;/ref&gt; It began with an address of "O Muslims and Copts", referring to Egypt's Coptic Christian minority instead of the customary opening for Islamic Friday sermons "O Muslims".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/19/world/middleeast/19egypt.html|work=The New York Times| first=David D.|last=Kirkpatrick|title=After Long Exile, Sunni Cleric Takes Role in Egypt|date=18 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was reported to have said, "Egyptian people are like the [[genie]] who came out of the lamp and who have been in prison for 30 years." He also demanded the release of political prisoners in Egyptian prisons, praised the [[Copts]] for protecting Muslims in their Friday prayer, and called for the new military rulers to quickly restore civilian rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2011/0218/Egypt-revolution-unfinished-Qaradawi-tells-Tahrir-masses|title=Egypt revolution unfinished, Qaradawi tells Tahrir masses|author=The Christian Science Monitor|date=18 February 2011|work=The Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt; He referred to Mubarak as a ''Tyrannical Pharaoh''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.memri.org/reports/sheikh-yousuf-al-qaradhawi-friday-sermon-cairos-tahrir-square-pray-conquest-al-aqsa |title= Sheikh Yousuf Al-Qaradhawi in Friday Sermon at Cairo's Tahrir Square: Pray for the Conquest of Al-Aqsa  |last= |first= |date=18 February 2011 |website=MEMRI |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 February 2011, he talked about the [[2011 Libyan civil war|protests in Libya]] and issued a [[fatwa]] permitting the killing of [[Muammar Gaddafi]]:&lt;ref&gt;For a complete English translation, see: ''The fatwa of Shaykh Yûsuf al-Qaradâwî against Gaddafi''.

As for me, I protect the people (sha'b) and I issue this fatwa: Whoever among them is able to shoot him with a bullet and to free us from his evil, to free Libya and its great people from the evil of this man and from the danger of him, let him do so!

He also called on Libyan ambassadors around the world to distance themselves from Gaddafi's government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iol.co.za/news/africa/sunni-cleric-says-gaddafi-should-die-1.1030016 Sunni cleric says Gaddafi should die], ''IOL News'', 21 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presstv.ir/detail/166411.html Egyptian cleric: Kill Gaddafi], ''PressTV'', 22 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'', [[Barry Rubin]] drew a parallel between Qaradawi's sermon and the [[Ayatollah Khomeini]] returning to [[Iran]]. He also said that Qaradawi was encouraging the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] to suppress opposition when he made reference to [[Munafiq|hypocrites]] in his sermon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Columnists/Article.aspx?id=209102|title=The Region: Egypt gets its Khomeini|work=The Jerusalem Post - JPost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brookings Institution]] member Shadi Hamid says that Qaradawi is in the mainstream of Egyptian society, and that he also has appeal among Egyptians who are not [[Islamist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2011/0218/Egypt-revolution-unfinished-Qaradawi-tells-Tahrir-masses/(page)/1|title=Egypt revolution unfinished, Qaradawi tells Tahrir masses|author=The Christian Science Monitor|date=18 February 2011|work=The Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Eurasia Review]]'', [[Princeton University]] student Aaron Rock dismisses claims that Qaradawi is the Khomeini of Egypt, but he does see his influence as a sign that [[Islam]] will play a significant role in the shaping of Egypt's politics. He writes, "Neither Qaradawi's popularity nor his rhetoric should distract from the fact that Egyptian revolution's grievances were based on a desire for political liberty and economic opportunity. That said, Islam remains an important framework for public debate and a reservoir of political symbolism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rock|first=Aaron|title=Qaradawi's Return And Islamic Leadership in Egypt|url=http://www.eurasiareview.com/qaradawis-return-and-islamic-leadership-in-egypt-analysis-20032011/|accessdate=20 March 2011|newspaper=Eurasia Review|date=20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views and statements==

===Religious and sectarian views===

====Muslim sects====

=====Extremism=====
Al-Qaradawi has written on the danger of extremist groups of Islam, in his [[dissertation]] on the subject ''Islamic Awakening between Rejection and Extremism''. In it he warns of the dangers of blind obedience, [[bigotry]] and intolerance; rigidity—which deprives people of clarity of vision and the opportunity for dialogue with others; commitment to excessiveness, including the excessive application of minor or controversial Islamic issues to people in non-Muslim countries or to people who have only recently converted to Islam; harshness in the treatment of people, roughness in the manner of approach, and crudeness in calling people to Islam, all which are contrary to the teachings of the Qur'an and Sunnah.&lt;ref name=between&gt;{{cite book|last=al-Qaradawi|first=Yusuf|title=Islamic Awakening between Rejection and Extremism|year=1987|publisher=International Institute of Islamic Thought|page=10|url=http://www.abc.se/home/m9783/ir/d/iare_e.pdf|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160909095446/https://www.abc.se/home/m9783/ir/d/iare_e.pdf|archivedate=9 September 2016|df=dmy-all}} ()&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Al-Qaradawi himself has advocated extremism and anti-semitism, denouncing Jews for their "corruption" and describing [[Adolf Hitler]] as having put Jews "in their place".&lt;ref name=Hitler&gt;{{cite web|title=Sheikh Yousuf Al-Qaradhawi: Allah Imposed Hitler On the Jews to Punish Them – 'Allah Willing, the Next Time Will Be at the Hand of the Believers'|url=http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/3062.htm|date=3 February 2009|publisher=memri.org|accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Qaradawi's Extremism Laid Bare|url=http://www.investigativeproject.org/992/qaradawis-extremism-laid-bare|date=6 February 2009 |publisher=[[Investigative Project on Terrorism]]|accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While others{{who|date=September 2016}} believe Al-Qaradawi is merely "not afraid to state firmly that 'Palestinian martyr operations are a weapon of the weak'".&lt;ref name=moderate&gt;{{cite news|last=Saeed|first=Sohaib|title=Comment If Qaradawi is an extremist, who is left?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/jul/09/religion.politics|accessdate=12 September 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=8 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Sufism=====
Al-Qaradawi has been an avid caller to what he calls "Islamic [[Sufism]]", praising those who practice it as pious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunnah.org/tasawwuf/scholr39.htm|title=On Tassawuf Shaykh Yusuf al-Qaradawi|publisher=Sunnah|accessdate=11 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Shi'as=====
Al-Qaradawi has disparaged [[Shi'ites]] as innovators (''mubtadiʿūn'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2008/916/eg5.htm|title=The politics of sects|publisher=Ahram Weekly|date=5 October 2008|accessdate=11 April 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011081741/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2008/916/eg5.htm|archivedate=11 October 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and warned of the "Shiitization" of the Middle East, saying Shiite Muslims were "invading" Sunni societies.&lt;ref name=invading&gt;{{cite web |title=Shiite's are 'invading' Sunni societies: Qaradawi|url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2008/09/19/56858.html |date=19 September 2008 |publisher=AFP |accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Influential Sunni cleric speaks of Shiite 'invasion'|author=(AFP)|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5g-I5N5oznQqpvBVxaDnjD-uJyswA|agency=AFP|date=18 September 2008|accessdate=15 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the Iranian [[Mehr News Agency]] described Qaradawi as "a spokesman for international Freemasonry and rabbis".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/research/backgrounders/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12305381 Try to be nice about each other, A Sunni preacher upsets the Shias] 25 September 2008, CAIRO, The Economist&lt;/ref&gt; Even fellow members of the [[International Union of Muslim Scholars]] such as [[Mohammad Salim Al-Awa]] criticized Qaradawi for promoting divisions among Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://humanities.tau.ac.il/iranian/en/previous-reviews/10-iran-pulse-en/102-25 | title=Iran and the Arabs: The Shi'itization controversy between al-Qaradawi and Iran | author=Altman, Israel Elad | journal=Iran Pulse | date=October 2008 | volume=25 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129024243/http://humanities.tau.ac.il/iranian/en/previous-reviews/10-iran-pulse-en/102-25 | archivedate=29 November 2014 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, al-Qaradawi has also verbally attacked the [[Alawite]] sect, which many describe as an offshoot of Shia Islam and of which President [[Bashir al-Assad]] is a member, as "more infidel than Christians and Jews" (أكفر من اليهود والنصارى).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.arabic.cnn.com/2013/middle_east/5/31/qardawi.syria-speech/|title=القرضاوي: النصيريون أكفر من اليهود ولو كنت قادرا لقاتلت بالقصير|work=CNNArabic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=abdo&gt;{{cite news |last=Abdo |first=Geneive |title=Why Sunni-Shia conflict is worsening |url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/07/opinion/abdo-shia-sunni-tension/index.html |date=7 June 2013 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 2010, al-Qaradawi met with [[Shia Islam|Shi'a]] scholar Ayatollah [[Hassan al-Saffar]] and urged to work their differences and come together and promote peace and disregard for sectarian strife like what the hardline are doing to create more dissension and discord between Shi'a and Sunni.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2014/07/05/Qaradawi-says-jihadist-caliphate-violates-sharia-.html|title=Qaradawi says 'jihadist caliphate' violates sharia|work=Hassan al-Saffar website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Salafism (Wahhabism)=====
Al-Qaradawi has been a staunch critic of [[Salafism]] ([[Wahhabism]]). He says this group stems its roots from [[Saudi Arabia]] and is just 200-years-old since its establishment compared to Islam which have existed for over 1,400 years who've lived in peace and harmony with Christians, Jews and other faiths. He says this group was created by Saudi Arabia's founder [[Ibn Saud]] together with [[Salafi]] ([[Wahhabi]]) founder [[Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab]] whom was all from [[Hadith of Najd|Najd]] (today [[Riyadh]]) with the help of [[British Army|British]] after toppling the legitimate [[Ottoman Empire|Islamic Empire of Ottomans]] which was mainstream [[Sunni Islam]] at that time and that it also see the oust of [[Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca|Hussein bin Ali (Sharif of Mecca)]] who're the original [[Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques]] in charge of [[Makkah]]'s [[Masjid al-Haram|Al-Masjid al-Haram]] and [[Madinah]]'s [[Al-Masjid an-Nabawi]] for over a thousand years since the time of the [[Muhammad|Islamic Prophet Muhammad]] whom is also the Prophet's direct descendant; the [[Hashemites]], which now resides and rule over [[The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan|Jordan]] which have no natural resources and regarded as among the poorest Arab countries in the [[Middle East]]. Qaradawi warned the world that it were Salafists (Wahhabists) that has caused terrorism all over the world especially groups like [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]], [[Boko Haram]], [[Al-Qaeda]], [[Taliban]], [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Al-Shabaab]], [[Abu Sayyaf]] and other similar groups alike. He also said that [[Israel]] and [[America]] heavily exploits from these groups by funding them since the 1970s until the present-day to pursue their (Western) political agenda in controlling the vast wealth of oil, gas, coal and mine to further destabilized the natural-resource-rich Middle East and beyond. Qaradawi also said that if more terrorist attacks were to occur, Israel will greatly benefit from it as it will give boosts to the sales of Israeli security companies and firms to promote their high-tech equipment globally in both hard and software forms. Qaradawi stated that the deceitful evil implications of those countries' complicity with this group is irreversible and has no end in sight. He compared them ([[takfiri]] groups) to dogs from Hell-fire for using religion to kill the innocents. He further said that [[Ash'aris]], [[Maturidis]] can overcome their tiny existence. He issued a [[fatwa]] (edict) in 2014 denouncing the [[ISIS|Islamic State]] (Daesh) declaration of "[[caliphate]]" and its leader [[Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi]] as "invalid, null and void" from every aspect, every angle of the [[Sharia|Islamic Sharia Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Channel |first=Hanafi Fiqh |title=The Ummah is Ash'ari by Sheikh Dr. Yusuf al-Qaradawi  |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1FHVsKsuFA |date=6 December 2012 |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Arabiyah |first=Al |title=Qaradawi says 'jihadist caliphate' violates sharia |url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2014/07/05/Qaradawi-says-jihadist-caliphate-violates-sharia-.html |date=5 July 2014 |publisher=Al-Arabiyah News |accessdate=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Non-Muslims====
Al-Qaradawi has called for dialogue with Non-Muslims. He also puts emphasis on conversations with the West, including Jews, Christians, and [[secularists]]. He writes that this effort should differentiate itself from a [[debate]], for the latter does not often result in mutual cooperation. Regarding the rights and citizenship of non-Muslim minorities, Qaradawi has said, "those people who live under the protection of an Islamic government enjoy special privileges. They are referred to as 'the Protected People' ([[dhimmi]]) ... In modern terminology, dhimmies are 'citizens' of the Islamic state. From the earliest period of Islam to the present day, Muslims are in unanimous agreement that they enjoy the same rights and carry the same responsibilities as Muslims themselves, while being free to practice their own faiths."

In his book titled ''[[The Lawful and the Prohibited in Islam]]'', al-Qaradawi wrote, "Islam does not prohibit Muslims to be kind and generous to peoples of other religions, even if they are idolaters and polytheists, ... it looks upon the People of the Book, that is, Jews and Christians, with special regard, whether they reside in a Muslim society or outside it. The Qur'an never addresses them without saying, 'O People of the Book' or 'O You who have been given the Book', indicating that they were originally people of a revealed religion. For this reason there exists a relationship of mercy and spiritual kinship between them and the Muslims."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Qaraḍāwī | first = Yūsuf | title = The lawful and the prohibited in Islam = al-Halal wal-haram fil Islam | publisher = American Trust Publications | location = Indianapolis, IN, USA | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-89259-016-5 | page = 334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Jews=====
In May 2008, al-Qaradawi told visiting Rabbis from the Haredi, Anti-Zionist [[Neturei Karta]] sect, "there is no enmity between Muslims and Jews ... Jews who believe in the authentic [[Torah]] are very close to Muslims." He has also expressed his belief that relations between Muslims and Jews became strained with the emergence of [[Zionism]] and the establishment of [[Israel]]. "Muslims are against the expansionist, oppressive Zionist movement, not the Jews." Reportedly, in 1998 the Associated Press quoted al-Qaradawi writing, "There should be no dialogue with these people [Israelis] except with swords."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investigativeproject.org/profile/167/yusuf-al-qaradawi Profile: Yusuf al-Qaradawi] ''[[The Investigative Project on Terrorism]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2005, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that the [[Dublin]]-based [[European Council for Fatwa and Research]], of which al-Qaradhawi is president, had used the antisemitic ''[[Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' in its theological deliberations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zmo.de/pressekit/material/Wall_Street_BG.pdf Islamic Justice Finds a Foothold In Heart of Europe] ''The Wall Street Journal'', 4 August 2005, Vol nr. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Qaradawi's remarks were sharply criticized by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL), which accused him of inciting violence against Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/NR/exeres/788C5421-70E3-4E4D-BFF4-9BE14E4A2E58%2CDB7611A2-02CD-43AF-8147-649E26813571%2Cframeless.htm Sheik Yusuf al-Qaradawi: Theologian of Terror], Anti-Defamation League, 4 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/main_Terrorism/qaradawi_gaza_threats.htm Muslim Brotherhood Ideologue Incites Violence Against Jews and Israel], Anti-Defamation League (ADL), 2 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://lfpress.com/comment/columnists/rory_leishman/2009/10/31/11588271-sun.html Multiculturalists diminish 'rough beast' ravaging Islam] by Rory Leishman, IFPress.com, 31 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/opinion/the-bond-between-nazis-and-islam/story-e6frg6zo-1225890936552 The bond between Nazis and Islam] by Paul Berman, ''The Australian'', 13 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 9 January 2009 sermon during the [[Gaza War (2008–09)|Gaza War]], shown on [[Al-Jazeera]], Qaradawi prayed (as translated by [[MEMRI]]):

{{quote|O Allah, take your enemies, the enemies of Islam. O Allah, take the Jews, the treacherous aggressors. O Allah, take this profligate, cunning, arrogant band of people. O Allah, they have spread much tyranny and corruption in the land. Pour Your wrath upon them, O our God. Lie in wait for them. O Allah, You annihilated the people of Thamoud (An early pagan Arab tribe) with an overpowering blast, and You annihilated the people of 'Aad with a fierce, icy gale, and You destroyed the pharaoh [of [[The Exodus|Exodus]]] and his soldiers – O Allah, take this oppressive, tyrannical band of people. O Allah, take this oppressive, Jewish Zionist band of people. O Allah, do not spare a single one of them. O Allah, count their numbers, and kill them, down to the very last one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memri.org/bin/articles.cgi?Page=archives&amp;Area=sd&amp;ID=SP218309 Sheikh Yousef Al-Qaradhawi On Al-Jazeera Incites Against Jews, Arab Regimes, and the U.S.; Calls on Muslims to Boycott Starbucks and Others; Says 'O Allah, Take This Oppressive, Jewish, Zionist Band of People ...

In a sermon broadcast on ''Qatar TV'' on 26 April 2013 (as translated by [[MEMRI]]), Qaradawi announced that he would not participate in an inter-faith dialogue if Jews were present, stating, "If you invite the Jews, I will not participate. I will participate in a Muslim-Christian meeting, but with the Jews there should be no debate." Qaradawi stated that there can be "no debate whatsoever with those who have committed injustice" and "Those Jews have committed clear injustice against us. They have shed our blood, killed our children, displaced our people, seized our lands, and usurped our rights." Later in his sermon, Qaradawi restated: "I cannot be a part of a conference in which wrongdoing Jews participate. They have committed great injustice, and I cannot possibly shake hands with them. Their hands are soiled with blood. They have murderous, violent, and oppressive hands. I cannot soil my hands by shaking theirs."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memritv.org/clip/en/3825.htm Leading Sunni Scholar Yousuf Al-Qaradawi Refuses to Participate in Interfaith Dialogue with Jews], MEMRITV, Clip No. 3825 (transcript), 26 April 2013.

=====Views on the Holocaust=====
Al-Qaradawi has defended the mass murder of millions during the Holocaust as a "punishment." In a statement that aired on [[Al-Jazeera]] TV on 28 January 2009 during the [[Gaza War (2008–09)|Gaza War]], al-Qaradawi said the following regarding [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Holocaust]] (as translated by [[MEMRI]]):&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memritv.org/clip/en/2005.htm – Sheik Yousuf Al-Qaradhawi: Allah Imposed Hitler upon the Jews to Punish Them – "Allah Willing, the Next Time Will Be at the Hand of the Believers"], MEMRITV, Clip no. 2005, Al-Jazeera TV (Qatar) – 28–30 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Analysis: Yusuf al-Qaradawi – a 'man for all seasons'|url=http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?ID=208978&amp;R=R|work=[[The Jerusalem Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investigativeproject.org/992/qaradawis-extremism-laid-bare Qaradawi's Extremism Laid Bare], Investigative Project on Terrorism, IPT News, 6 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishworldreview.com/people/emerson050610.php3 Intellectual Double Standards on Islamists] by Steve Emerson, Jewish World Review, 6 May 2010/22 Iyar 5770.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://washingtonjewishweek.com/m/Articles.aspx?ArticleID=16491 Islamist movements casts shadow over Egypt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603043317/http://washingtonjewishweek.com/m/Articles.aspx?ArticleID=16491 |date=3 June 2013 }} by [[Robert S.

Allah Willing, the next time will be at the hand of the believers.}}

====Apostasy====
Al-Qaradawi says that [[apostasy]] – Muslims leaving Islam – is a grave danger to the Muslim community and that it is the duty of all Muslims "is to combat apostasy in all its forms and wherefrom it comes, giving it no chance to pervade in the Muslim world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.islamonline.net/i3/ContentServer?pagename=IslamOnline/i3Layout&amp;c=OldArticle&amp;cid=1178724001992 |title=Source of the Punishment for Apostasy |publisher=Islam online |accessdate=11 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805064833/http://www.islamonline.net/i3/ContentServer?pagename=IslamOnline%2Fi3Layout&amp;c=OldArticle&amp;cid=1178724001992 |archivedate=5 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2013, Qaradawi stated on Egyptian television that the application of the death penalty for those who leave Islam is a necessity, stating, "If they had gotten rid of the apostasy punishment Islam wouldn't exist today." Qaradawi also cited several speeches and writings by Muhammad and his followers, such as Surah Al-Ma'idah 5:33, which he quoted as "The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His apostle is that they should be murdered or crucified." Qaradawi further explained, " ... many hadiths, not only one or two, but many, narrated by a number of Muhammad's companions state that any apostate should be killed. Ibn 'Abbas's hadith: 'Kill whoever changes his faith [from Islam].'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huMu8ihDlVA | title=Yusuf al-Qaradawi: Killing Of Apostates Is Essential For Islam To Survive| language =Arabic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=After Saturday Comes Sunday: Understanding the Christian Crisis in the Middle East | first=Elizabeth |last=Kendal | date=8 June 2016 | isbn=1498239862 | publisher=Wipf and Stock | page=36 |chapter=Hasten to Success }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With regards to the punishment of apostasy, al-Qaradawi supports the classical Islamic tradition on some points but differs on others. He considers execution as a penalty in principle, but the only apostates that are to be executed are those that combine other crimes with apostasy (e.g., "incit[ing] a [[war against Islam]]"). He also advocates apostates to be given a chance to repent. Finally, he believes that "hidden apostasy" (where the apostate does not "proclaim" his conversion) may be left to the judgement of God in the [[Hereafter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Apostasy and its Classification in Yusuf Al-Qardawi's View|url=http://www.islamopediaonline.org/fatwa/apostasy-and-its-classification-yusuf-al-qardawis-view|publisher=[[Islamopedia Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While al-Qaradawi believes that the Muslim community is not allowed to punish "intellectual apostasy", where the apostates do not "swagger" about their conversion, he still strongly condemns it. He says "These people are not noticed when they invade or begin to disseminate their falsehood, but they are mostly felt when they affect the minds. They do not use guns in their attacks, however, their attacks are fierce and cunning." Nevertheless, he concedes, "Erudite scholars and well versed jurists ... can not take an action in face of such professional criminals who have firmly established themselves and have not left a chance for law to be enforced on them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onislam.net/english/ask-the-scholar/crimes-and-penalties/apostasy/175287.html|title=Fatwa on Intellectual Apostasy|publisher=OnIslam|accessdate=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political views===

====Freedom and democracy====
Al-Qaradawi has spoken in favor of democracy in the Muslim world, speaking of a need for reform of political climates in the Middle East specifically.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/English/archive/archive?ArchiveId=3779 Reform according to Islam] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070416125743/http://english.aljazeera.net/English/archive/archive?ArchiveId=3779 |date=16 April 2007 }}. [http://english.aljazeera.net/ Al Jazeera English]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muslimnews.co.uk/news/news.php?article=11311 Muslim world needs democracy, says Qaradawi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823013638/http://www.muslimnews.co.uk/news/news.php?article=11311 |date=23 August 2006 }} – The Muslim News – 8 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 February 2011, he held an exclusive interview with OnIslam.net, dismissing the allegation that he wanted a religious state established in Egypt: "On the contrary, my speech supported establishing a civil state with a religious background, I am totally against [[theocracy]]. We are not a state for [[mullah]]s."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onislam.net/english/news/africa/451164-govt-pressures-ban-qaradawi-from-egypt-tv.html Govt pressure bans Qaradawi], 22 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

====Terrorism====
After the [[September 11 attacks]], al-Qaradawi urged Muslims to donate blood for the victims and said:&lt;ref name="11 Sept Response"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islam-online.net/English/News/2001-09/13/article25.shtml |title=Qaradawi Condemns Attacks Against Civilians: Forbidden in Islam |publisher=Islam-online.net |accessdate=11 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Islam, the religion of tolerance, holds the human soul in high esteem, and considers the attack against innocent human beings a grave sin; this is backed by the Qur'anic verse that reads: "Who so ever kills a human being for other than manslaughter or corruption in the earth, it shall be as if he has killed all mankind, and who so ever saves the life of one, it shall be as if he had saved the life of all mankind," (Al-Ma'idah:32). The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, is reported to have said, 'A believer remains within the scope of his religion as long as he doesn't kill another person illegally.' Islam never allows a Muslim to kill the innocent and the helpless.}}

He denies that Palestinian suicide bombing attacks constitute terrorism, claiming, "when Palestinians face such unjust aggression, they tend to stem bloodletting and destruction and not to claim the lives of innocent civilians," but qualifies that with "I do agree with those who do not allow such martyr operations to be carried out outside the Palestinian territories."

Al-Qaradawi has suggested the legitimate use of (defensive) [[suicide bombings]] against enemy combatants in modern times if the defending combatants have no other means of self-defense.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt; The Oxford-based [[Islam in Malaysia|Malaysian Islamic]] Scholar, [[Afifi al-Akiti|Dr. Afifi al-Akiti]], rules that there is no [[Fiqh|Islamic legal]] precedent for this view and that female soldiers can only be killed in direct combat. With regards to suicide bombings he says that they are "breaching the [[Ijma|scholarly consensus]] ... because to endanger one's life is one thing and to commit suicide during the attack is obviously another".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hasan|first=Mehdi|title=Suicide attacks are un-Islamic|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/religion/2009/11/mehdi-hasan--islam-suicide|accessdate=8 May 2011|newspaper=New Statesman|date=5 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regards to male soldiers he states, "It goes without saying that they are considered combatants as soon as they arrive on the battlefield even if they are not in direct combat – provided of course that the remaining conventions of war have been observed throughout, and that all this is during a valid war when there is no [[Hudna|ceasefire]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Afifi al-Akiti|first=Muhammad|title=Al-Akiti of Oxford University and author at Living Islam prohibits targeting Israeli civilians, permits attacking soldiers in times of no recognized cease fire in Palestine|url=http://www.islamopediaonline.org/fatwa/al-akiti-oxford-university-and-author-living-islam-prohibits-targeting-israeli-civilians-permi|publisher=[[Islamopedia Online]]|accessdate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Western governments have met al-Qaradawi to request release of European civilians kidnapped in Iraq and have thanked him officially, praising his cooperation. The [[French Foreign Minister]] [[Michel Barnier]] wrote to al-Qaradawi: "With such a clear condemnation of the abduction of the French hostages you have sent a clear-cut message demonstrating respect for the tenets of Islam."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whatnextjournal.org.uk/Pages/Politics/Welcome.html|title=Qaradawi Is Welcome Peter Roberts Labour Left Briefing, December 2004|publisher=What next journal|accessdate=11 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Israeli-Palestinian conflict====
Al-Qaradawi condones [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] attacks on [[Israeli people|Israelis]] only if Israel continues its oppression and averts peace. A resolution issued by The Islamic [[Fiqh]] Council affiliated to the [[Saudi]]-run [[Muslim World League]] in its 14th session, held in [[Doha]] ([[Qatar]]) on 11–16 January 2003 has upheld his views on the matter.&lt;ref&gt;source?&lt;/ref&gt; Defending bombings against Israeli civilians, al-Qaradawi told ''[[BBC Newsnight]]'' in 2005 that:
* "An Israeli woman is not like women in our societies, because she is a soldier."
* "I consider this type of martyrdom operation as an evidence of God's justice."
* "Allah Almighty is Just; through His infinite Wisdom He has given the weak a weapon the strong do not have and that is their ability to turn their bodies into bombs as Palestinians do."&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

He supports suicide attacks on all Israelis, including women&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mark Oliver and Anushri Patel |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jul/19/july7.uksecurity3|title=Controversy over cleric's visit grows|work=The Guardian|date=19 July 2005|accessdate=11 April 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2004/07_july/07/newsnight.shtml |title=Yusuf Al-Qaradawi tells BBC Newsnight that Islam justifies suicide bombings|publisher=BBC|accessdate=11 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; since he views the Israeli society as a "completely military" society that did not include any civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.islamonline.net/English/News/2001-12/05/article6.shtml |title=Qaradawi Criticizes Al-Azhar for Condemning Jerusalem Attacks |publisher=Islamonline |accessdate=11 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405220500/http://www.islamonline.net/English/News/2001-12/05/article6.shtml |archivedate=5 April 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also considers pregnant women and their unborn babies to be valid targets on the ground that the babies could grow up to join the [[Israeli Army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=4&amp;section=0&amp;article=53683&amp;d=30&amp;m=10&amp;y=2004 |title=Stop Terror Sheikhs, Muslim Academics Demand |publisher=Arab News |accessdate=11 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100911144023/http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=4&amp;section=0&amp;article=53683&amp;d=30&amp;m=10&amp;y=2004 |archivedate=11 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the press conference held by the organizations sponsoring his visit to London, al-Qaradawi reiterated his view that [[suicide attack]]s are a justified form of resistance to Israeli occupation of the rightfully [[Palestinian territories]]. He has also justified his views by stating that all Israeli civilians are potential soldiers, since Israel is a "militarized society". Because of these views, al-Qaradawi has been accused by Western countries and Israel of supporting terrorism.

An article wrote by Jewish editor [[Michael Slackman]] from [[Los Angeles Times]] later ([[The New York Times]]), commenting on suicide bombings conducted by Palestinians against Israelis al-Qaradawi declared during an interview with the newspaper Al Raya in April 2001: "They are not suicide operations. These are heroic martyrdom operations, and the heroes who carry them out don't embark on this action out of hopelessness and despair but are driven by an overwhelming desire to cast terror and fear into the hearts of the oppressors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/may/27/news/mn-3226|title=Islamic Debate Surrounds Mideast Suicide Bombers|work=latimes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Qaradawi is opposed to attacks outside of the Palestinian Territories and Israel, and against non-Israeli targets. For example, on 20 March 2005, he condemned a car bombing that had occurred in Doha, Qatar the previous day. One Briton, Jon Adams was killed. Al-Qaradawi issued a statement that said

{{quote|Such crimes are committed by insane persons who have no religious affiliation and play well into the hands of the enemies ... I urge all Qataris to stand united in facing such an epidemic and uproot it to nip the infection in the bud, otherwise it will spread like wildfire. I, in the name of all scholars in Qatar, denounce such a horrendous crime and pray that it would be the last and implore God to protect this secure country.}}

According to IslamOnline, Qaradawi released a fatwa on 14 April 2004 stating boycott of American and Israeli products was an obligation for all who are able. The fatwa reads in part :

{{quote|If people ask in the name of religion we must help them. The vehicle of this support is a complete boycott of the enemies' goods. Each riyal, dirham ... etc. used to buy their goods eventually becomes bullets to be fired at the hearts of brothers and children in Palestine. For this reason, it is an obligation not to help them (the enemies of Islam) by buying their goods. To buy their goods is to support tyranny, oppression and aggression. Buying goods from them will strengthen them; our duty is to make them as weak as we can. Our obligation is to strengthen our resisting brothers in the Sacred Land as much as we can. If we cannot strengthen the brothers, we have a duty to make the enemy weak. If their weakness cannot be achieved except by boycott, we must boycott them ... American goods, exactly like "Israeli" goods, are forbidden. It is also forbidden to advertise these goods. America today is a second Israel. It totally supports the Zionist entity. The usurper could not do this without the support of America. "Israel's" unjustified destruction and vandalism of everything has been using American money, American weapons, and the American veto. America has done this for decades without suffering the consequences of any punishment or protests about their oppressive and prejudiced position from the Islamic world.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}}}

On 8 May 2013, Qaradawi visited [[Gaza City|Gaza]] and gave a speech in support of [[Hamas]]. He asked all of the [[Palestinian people]] to work with other [[Arab]] people and [[Muslim]]s around the world to destroy Israel, saying inflammatory things such as "Our wish should be that we carry out Jihad to death" and "We should seek to liberate Palestine, all of Palestine, inch by inch."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/05/08/uk-palestinians-gaza-cleric-idUKBRE94714K20130508 |title=Influential Muslim cleric visits Hamas-ruled Gaza |author=Nidal al-Mughrabi |date=8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently according to [[Steven Emerson|The Investigative Project on Terrorism]] report wrote by [[Islamophobia|Anti-Islam]] journalist [[Steven Emerson]], al-Qaradawi published a message in Arabic on his website which was translated by The Investigative Project on Terrorism in which he called on Muslims to join the "greatest battle of liberation" against Israel and against the Jews in general.&lt;ref name="investigativeproject.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investigativeproject.org/4649/qaradawi-calls-muslims-to-arms-against-israel#|title=Qaradawi Calls Muslims to Arms Against Israel and the Jews|author=John Rossomando|work=The Investigative Project on Terrorism}}&lt;/ref&gt; The preacher allegedly protested the closure of Temple Mount after the assassination attempt that killed an Israeli activist, where the third holiest shrine for Islam is located, namely Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa mosque.&lt;ref name="investigativeproject.org"/&gt;

Along the same line citing from New York-based [[Jewish]]-run ADL ([[Anti-Defamation League]]) report, in 24 January 2011 al-Qaradawi had voiced his desire to see Jerusalem conquered in a fatwa in which he claimed that it was the Muslims' duty to "defend" Jerusalem with "their lives, their money and all they pos-sess, or else they will be subject to Allah's punishment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/anti-semitism/muslim-arab-world/c/sheik-yusf-al-qaradawi.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/#.VhVx8_lVhBc|title=Sheik Yusuf al-Qaradawi: Theologian of Terror|work=ADL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, al-Qaradawi argued on the TV show Ala-Masouliyati (I Am Responsible) that it is permissible for suicide bombers to self-detonate if requested by a group. Conversely, individuals are prohibited from carrying out suicide bombings on their own.

On the subject of the [[Western Wall]], Qaradawi said:

{{quote|The Jews' claim to Al-Buraq Wall dates back only to recent times. The longest reign of the Jews lasted for 434 years. Their reign in Palestine dates back to the times of Kings Saul, David and Solomon. Solomon's sons split after his decease: Jude headed for Jerusalem while the state of Israel was established in Shechem, that is Nablus. The Jewish state in Nablus lasted for 298 years and the former for 434. This is the longest period that the Jews reigned. So those who claim that they have a long history in Israel are liars. That history lasted for only 434 years. The Arabs, on the other hand, have been present in Palestine since the days of the Jebusites and the Canaanites, that is 30 centuries before the birth of Christ. Their history under the umbrella of Islam lasted for more than 14 centuries or even longer. Before the advent of Islam, there had been no Jews in Palestine because since 70 C.E. there had been no trace of Jews or Israelis in Palestine. {{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}}}

====Iraq war====

In 2004 the International Union of Muslim Scholars, an organization chaired by al-Qaradawi which counts a great number of prominent individual affiliated to the Muslim Brotherhood and/or Hamas among its members, ruled that "resisting occupation troops in Iraq is a 'duty' on able Muslims in and outside the war-torn country and that aiding the occupier is impermissible."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.islamonline.net/english/news/2004-11/20/article02.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

In an address aired on Qatar TV on 5 January 2007, al-Qaradawi questioned the trial of [[Saddam Hussein]] under American supervision in Iraq, but agreed to it if it were conducted by the Iraqi people "after liberating Iraq from American colonialism". He also suggested that the trial was "an act of vengeance by the Americans" for his missile attacks on Israel. He strongly criticized the way Saddam was hanged:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.memri.org/bin/articles.cgi?Page=countries&amp;Area=iraq&amp;ID=SP142707 |title=Middle East Media Research Institute |publisher=MEMRI |accessdate=11 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|A human soul must be respected. These people did not respect the human soul. The man was calm and kept his cool. He refused to be blindfolded, and insisted upon facing death with open eyes.. and said the two parts of the shahada ... The man died saying: 'There is no God but Allah' ... Anybody whose last words are 'There is no God but Allah' goes to Paradise. The thing that improves [the record] of Saddam Hussein is that in his final years – as the brothers in Iraq tell us – he was a changed man. He began to strictly observe the prayers, to read the Quran, and to do charitable work. He would hasten to do anything that may help people. He would help build mosques, and would say that if anybody wants to build a mosque, the government should pay half the cost of the building materials. When they entered his secret hideout and caught him, they found a prayer carpet and an open Quran.}}

====Hezbollah====
In 2006, in response to Muslim scholar [[Abdullah Ibn Jibreen]]'s fatwa declaring that it was forbidden for Muslims to support or pray for [[Hezbollah]] because they are [[Shia]], al-Qaradawi said that supporting Hezbollah is a religious duty for all Muslims and that resistance, whether in Palestine or Lebanon, is the most noble act. He added "Shias agree with the Sunnis in the main principles of Islam while the differences are only over the branches" and also called upon the Sunnis and Shia of [[Iraq]] to end the civil war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=99984&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=36&amp;parent_id=16 |title=Qaradawi urges Muslims to support Hezbollah |accessdate=30 July 2006 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930210808/http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=99984&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=36&amp;parent_id=16 |archivedate=30 September 2007 }}. Gulf Times&lt;/ref&gt;

Seven years later, during the Syrian Civil War, Qaradawi urged all Sunnis to fight Hezbollah, attacking Hezbollah's leader [[Hassan Nasrallah]] and [[Iran]]: "The leader of the Party of Satan comes to fight the Sunnis ... Now we know what the Iranians want ... They want continued massacres to kill Sunnis."&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-22741588 Syria conflict: Cleric Qaradawi urges Sunnis to join rebels] BBC News, 1 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Qaradawi also stated that he now regretted having advocated rapprochement between Sunnis and Shias and his 2006 defense of Hezbollah.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

====Arab Spring====
Qaradawi declared his support for the rebels led by the [[National Transitional Council]] in the [[2011 Libyan civil war]], urging Arab nations to recognize them and "to confront the tyranny of the regime in Tripoli". He suggested weapons be sent to the rebels to assist the, and said "Our Islamic nation should stand against injustice and corruption and I urge the Egyptian government to extend a helping hand to Libyan people and not to Gaddafi."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Recognise Libyan rebels: Qaradawi|url=http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=421411&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=36&amp;parent_id=16|newspaper=Gulf Times|date=11 March 2011|accessdate=20 March 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314152302/http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=421411&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=36&amp;parent_id=16|archivedate=14 March 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the [[2011 Bahrain protests]], Qaradawi was reluctant to give support: "The protests in Bahrain are sectarian in nature. The Shias are revolting against the Sunnis." He claimed that Shia protesters attack Sunnis and occupied their mosques. He acknowledged that the Shia majority had legitimate concerns in regards to fairness with the Sunnis: "I want them to be real citizens of their country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bharaini Sunnis, Shias should talk to resolve issues: Qaradawi|url=http://www.thepeninsulaqatar.com/qatar/146271-bharaini-sunnis-shias-should-talk-to-resolve-issues-qaradawi.html|accessdate=30 March 2011|newspaper=The Peninsula|date=20 March 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607164907/http://www.thepeninsulaqatar.com/qatar/146271-bharaini-sunnis-shias-should-talk-to-resolve-issues-qaradawi.html|archivedate=7 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Qaradawi said that all Arabs should back up the protesters in the [[2011 Syrian uprising]], saying "Today the train of revolution has reached a station that it had to reach: The Syria station," and "It is not possible for Syria to be separated from the history of the Arab community."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Protests in Syria's Daraa city, journalists banned|url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/middleeast/news/article_1628710.php/Protests-in-Syria-s-Daraa-city-journalists-banned|newspaper=Deutsche Presse-Agentur|date=25 March 2011|accessdate=26 March 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512020612/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/middleeast/news/article_1628710.php/Protests-in-Syria-s-Daraa-city-journalists-banned|archivedate=12 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He declared his support for the protests against what he called Syria's "oppressive regime", claiming "atrocities" were committed by it. He called for victory against the ruling Ba'ath party and claimed the army would be the major factor in the revolt. He claimed that when he offered to mediate negotiations between the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] and the Syrian government, someone deliberately sabotaged it. Qaradawi also expressed his support for the [[2011 military intervention in Libya|No Fly zone put in place by western nations over Libya]], saying "The operation in Libya is to protect the civilians from Gaddafi's tyranny" and slamming Arab League leader [[Amr Moussa]] for criticism of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Qaradawi condemns 'atrocities' against protesters in Syria|author=Nour Abuzant|url=http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=424384&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=57&amp;parent_id=56|newspaper=Gulf Times|date=26 March 2011|accessdate=26 March 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809141330/http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=424384&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=57&amp;parent_id=56|archivedate=9 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women, gender and other issues===
Commenting on the role women played in social active issues:

{{quote|Although over sixty years have passed since the Movement emerged into existence, no women leaders have appeared that can confront secular and [[Marxist]] trends single-handedly and efficiently. This has come about as a result of men's unrelenting attempts to control women's movement, as men have never allowed women a real chance to express themselves and show special leadership talents and abilities that demonstrate their capability of taking command of their work without men's dominance.

I believe that women's Islamic work will succeed and prove itself in the arena of the Islamic Movement only when it gives birth to female Islamic leaders in the fields of Call, thought, science, literature and education.

Accordingly, women as well as men can dedicate themselves to Allah, and play a role in jihad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palestine-info.info/arabic/fatawa/alamaliyat/qaradawi1.htm Advisory opinion of the scholar Dr. Yusuf al-Qaradawi on women's participation in martyrdom operations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531230000/http://www.palestine-info.info/arabic/fatawa/alamaliyat/qaradawi1.htm |date=31 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

I do not think that this is impossible or even difficult. There are genius women just as there are genius men. Ingenuity is not a monopoly for men. It is not in vain that the Holy Quran tells us the story of a woman who led men wisely and bravely and made her people fare the best end: it is the [[Queen of Sheba]], whose story with [[Solomon]] is told in [[An-Naml|Surat Al Naml]]. I have observed in the [[University of Qatar]] that girls make better students than boys.}}

====Rape====

According to Kamal Badr, Qaradawi advocates that rape victims be protected by society:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Thus, many Muslim scholars, led by Sheikh Al-Qaradawi, have maintained that young Muslim men should hasten to marry women who fall as rape victims, so as to reduce their suffering and console them, to compensate them for the loss of the most precious thing that they possess. This reflects mutual love, rapport and altruism that prevail in the Muslim society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aboutislam.net/counseling/ask-about-islam/are-raped-women-punished-in-islam/ “Qaradawi: Muslim men should hasten to marry women who fall as rape victims”] www.aboutislam.net&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Wife beating====
Al-Qaradawi told ''[[The Guardian]]'' that [[domestic violence|wife beating]] was neither "obligatory nor desirable" but that he "accepts it as a method of last resort – though only ''lightly''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Madeleine Bunting |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/oct/29/religion.uk1|title=Friendly fire Madeleine Bunting meets Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi in Qatar|work=The Guardian|date=29 October 2005|accessdate=11 April 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated on Channel 4 News that it was justifiable in certain circumstances&lt;ref name="Red Ken and the Conservative Cleric"/&gt; but the "ideal was for Muslim men never to beat their wives, and if husbands wrongly beat their wives, they have the right to fight back".&lt;ref name="LondonDossier"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legacy.london.gov.uk/news/docs/qaradawi_dossier.pdf|title=Why the Mayor of London will maintain dialogues with all of London's faiths and communities – p. 14 – Women's rights|format=PDF|accessdate=11 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British newspaper ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' writes that al-Qaradawi, in his book ''The Lawful and Prohibited in Islam'', states that wife-beating is permissible after the failure of all other means of persuasion. In such circumstances, a husband may beat his wife "lightly with his hands, avoiding her face and other sensitive areas".&lt;ref name="Red Ken and the Conservative Cleric"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whatnextjournal.org.uk/Pages/Politics/Brettlock.html|title=Red Ken and the Conservative Cleric|publisher=What next journal|accessdate=11 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McCartney|first=Jenny |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/jennymccartney/3608294/Livingstone-lauds-the-man-who-defends-the-killing-of-gays.html |title=Livingstone lauds the man who defends the killing of gays|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=11 July 2004|accessdate=11 April 2010| location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Syal|first=Rajeev|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1466715/For-her-to-be-absolved-from-guilt-a-raped-woman-must-have-shown-good-conduct.html |title='For her to be absolved from guilt, a raped woman must have shown good conduct'|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=11 July 2004|accessdate=11 April 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Al-Qaradawi, Yusuf.

====Female genital mutilation (FGM)====
Qaradawi says [[female genital mutilation]] surgery is forbidden in Islam. He calls on ending and banned to ''Female Circumcision'' in some parts of the Muslim world, especially in rural Africa where most still practice it. His views were supported by Sheikhs in [[Al-Azhar University|Al-Azhar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ikhwanweb.com/article.php?id=19661|title=Qaradawi Calls On Ending Female Circumcision, Considers It Banned In Islamic Law - Ikhwanweb|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Female Masturbation====

Qaradawi urged women to not masturbate and elaborated that its dangerous to stick things into the vagina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.memri.org/tv/sheik-yousuf-al-qaradhawi-risks-female-masturbation |title=Clip #1308 Sheik Yousuf Al-Qaradhawi on the Risks of Female Masturbation |last= |first= |date=27 October 2006 |website=MEMRI |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Homosexuality====

On 5 June 2006, on the Al Jazeera program ''Sharia and Life'', al-Qaradawi (a regular on the program) reiterated orthodox views on homosexuality.&lt;ref name="www_aljazeera_net4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/E3A7EEFB-4016-485A-8D6A-7AA9FD75CBD9.htm|title=Al Jazeera|accessdate=18 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked about the punishment for people who "practise liwaat (sodomy) or sihaaq (lesbian activity)", al-Qaradawi replied: "The same punishment as any sexual pervert – the same as the fornicator." ([[Middle East Media Research Institute|MEMRI]] translation).&lt;ref name="www_memritv_org5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.memritv.org/search.asp?ACT=S9&amp;P1=1170#|title=Memritv|accessdate=18 June 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061002053939/http://www.memritv.org/search.asp?ACT=S9&amp;P1=1170|archivedate=2 October 2006|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The punishment for fornication is [[Flagellation|lashing]].

In an interview with ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', Qaradawi said that his attitude towards homosexuality is the same as that found in Christianity. In the interview he stated, "One year ago, there was a demonstration against me in London because I spoke out against homosexuality. People seem to have forgotten that it wasn't me who came up with this mindset. It's part of God's order spoken of by Moses and even mentioned by Jesus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,376954,00.html|title=Interview with Al-Jazeera Host Yusuf Al-Qaradawi|accessdate=1 March 2011|publisher=SPIEGEL International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However there are rigorous scholarly debates among the [[Madhhab|Islamic School of Law]] ([[Fiqh]]) as to whether LGBT are define by genetic disorders and that it may be permissible or not for those who're scientifically-medically-proven to be part of the LGBT category as with [[hermaphrodite]] denoting whether a person is incline towards the naturality of female or male instinct. Same for [[Mukhannathun]] (Transgender), in which there are many prophetic [[Hadith]] that allows male who have inclinations towards being female (effeminate) that occurred during the Islamic prophet Muhammad's time and that they were accepted as part of the larger community in [[Madinah]] having equal rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Partial Translation of Sunan Abu-Dawud, Book 32: Clothing (Kitab al-Libas)|url=http://cmje.usc.edu/religious-texts/hadith/abudawud/032-sat.php|website=www.usc.edu|publisher=Center for Muslim-Jewish Engagement}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qaradawi is one of many among the leading Islamic scholars who's in this ongoing debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=General Behavior (Kitab al-Adab)|url=http://cmje.usc.edu/religious-texts/hadith/abudawud/041-sat.php|website=www.usc.edu|publisher=Center for Muslim-Jewish Engagement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stoning====

Al-Qaradawi calls "[[stoning]]" un-Islamic for it has nothing to do with Islam at all but laws made by the religion of [[Judaism]]; Jewish Religious Laws. He says there are more than dozens of verses in the [[Torah]] that support stoning for adulterers, fornicators, [[LGBT]] people, and for many other reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yk0OGa8jKZo|title=Stoning has nothing to do with Islam but Judaism, Jewish Laws of Torah|accessdate=15 June 2017|publisher=Al-Qaradawi Institute for Islamic Moderation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Honor killing====

Al-Qaradawi says that [[honor killing]] is a tradition that was carried out thousands of years ago by ancient civilization; the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], [[History of China|Chinese Emperors]], etc. He says, it has nothing to do with Islam; neither [[Qur'an]] nor Sunnah (Prophetic [[Hadith]]). He calls on those who done it to be punishable with death for their crime; a life for a life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hbku.edu.qa/en/cis/qcimr|title=Honor killing has nothing to do with Islam but traditions by Ancient Times, the Romans, Dark Ages, Chinese Emperors|accessdate=10 June 2015|publisher=Al-Qaradawi Centre for Islamic Moderation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mawlid (Muhammad's Birthday)====

Al-Qaradawi fully supports and advocates [[Mawlid]]. He says that to used the birth date of [[Muhammad]] in remembrance of his life story is not [[Bid'ah]] (Innovation). In fact it's encourage in Islam to do good action (Man Sanna Sunnatun Hassanah) based on a Sahih Hadith. And that Allah (God) himself have said in Al-Qur'an, Chapter 21, Verse 107:

{{quote|And We have not sent you, [O Muhammad], except for mercy (rahmah) to all mankind.|[[Al-Qur'an]], 21:107&lt;ref&gt;Al-Quran, Chapter 21, Verse 107, [https://quran.com/21/107], 16 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Al-Qaradawi explains that [[Allah]] (God) is talking about Muhammad's miracle birth as the verse mentions "sent you". In other words, his presence, his birth, his coming. A "mercy" (rahmah) to the worlds. Means mercy to all mankind. It means everything; all of his creations (all creatures).

{{quote|Whoever starts a good action (sunnah) in Islam. He will be rewarded for his actions as well as getting the reward of those who've followed it successively until the [[Day of Judgment]].|[[Muhammad]], narrated by [[Sahih Muslim]], Hadith no. 1017&lt;ref&gt;Innovation in Islam - Explanation, [http://www.islamicacademy.org/html/Articles/English/BID%27AH%20-%20Innovation%20in%20Islam.htm], 17 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Concept of Bid'ah in Islam, [http://www.alahazrat.net/islam/concept-of-bidah-in-islam.php], 19 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It's in this Sahih Hadith that Sheikh Prof. Dr. Yusuf al-Qaradawi emphasizes that '''''good innovative actions''''' is strongly encouraged for as long as it doesn't goes against the [[Sharia]] (Islamic Law). What more involving religion itself than worldly good deeds like holding an old person's hand while crossing the road guiding him/her to safety and many more. It's encouraging for both. He says these is the true meaning and emphasis of Islam, to be the religion of mercy (rahmah) and to do more good than just good so that others may lead by our good examples and that they may successively follows them till [[End Times|End of Time]].&lt;ref&gt;Sheikh Prof. Dr. Yusuf al-Qaradawi on the Importance of Mawlid, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agRUr4gKuDs], 15 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

====Niqab====

Al-Qaradawi says that [[Niqab]] (Veil) is not obligatory in Islam. He has pointed out that a woman's face is not an [[Intimate parts in Islam|Awrah]]. He calls those who don the Niqabs as following tradition and culture before Islam came to Arabia. Those people, be it male or female at that time had to cover their faces from dusty desert and from inhaling dust especially during [[sandstorm]]. [[Al-Azhar University|Al-Azhar]]'s Grand Imam, also an Egyptian Grand Mufti Sheikh [[Muhammad Sayyid Tantawy]] have also called out that Niqab has nothing to do with Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Shaykh Yusuf Qaradawi (HA) on Niqab and "Interaction" of men and women, [http://www.muftisays.com/blog/Muadh_Khan/3331_26-05-2013/shaykh-yusuf-qaradawi-ha-on-niqab-and-quotinteractionquot-of-men-and-women.html], 20 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Niqab in Focus by IslamOnline.net, [http://www.irfi.org/articles4/articles_5001_6000/niqab%20in%20focushtml.htm], 21 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

====Organ transplant====

At the same time Qaradawi issued a fatwa (edict) that organ transplant from living to a living person is permissible in Islam but through donation as donation is considered charity. As for a dead person, only when the brain stops, the transplant can then be carried out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ikhwanweb.com/article.php?id=19661|title=Qaradawi On Organ Transplant - Ikhwanweb|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Qaradawi's affiliation with the Muslim Brotherhood led to his expulsion from Egypt, a country where this organisation was at the time prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.terrorism-info.org.il/en/article/17948&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Qaradawi was a follower of [[Hassan al-Banna|Hasan al-Banna]] during his youth and a longtime member of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]].&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt; He has twice turned down offers to be its leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cesnur.org/2004/qaradawi.htm|title="Al-Qaradawi Turns Down Offer to Assume Leadership of the Muslim Brotherhood" Al Jazeera|publisher=Cesnur|date=12 January 2004|accessdate=11 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview on the [[Dream channel]], al-Qaradawi states the following about his relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood (MB):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ikhwanweb.com/article.php?id=3537|title=Qaradawi: "MB asked me to be a chairman"|publisher=Ikhwanweb|accessdate=11 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 May 2015 al-Qaradawi has been sentenced to death in absentia by an Egyptian court along with the ousted President Mohamed Morsi and over 100 other Egyptians affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2015/05/egypt-morsi-death-sentence-150517102814924.html|title=Death sentence for freedom in Egypt|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As reported by the Interpol website, Qaradawi is wanted by the judicial authorities of Egypt for "Agreement, incitement and assistance to commit intentional murder, helping the prisoners to escape, arson, vandalism and theft."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interpol.int/notice/search/wanted/2014-58772|title=- INTERPOL|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Reality TV
Qaradawi has criticised reality TV programs, saying that the aim of these is to 'mislead the [Muslim] nation'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.memri.org/reports/reality-tv-show-stirs-bahrain |title= Reality TV Show Stirs Up Bahrain  |last= |first= |date=6 May 2004 |website=MEMRI |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception in the Muslim world==
Al-Qaradawi, a forefront of contemporary Muslim thinkers and scholars. His vast contributions include more than 80 books and hundreds of articles on different Islamic issues, ranging from the fundamental principles and laws of Islam to the needs and challenges of modern Muslim societies. His knowledge, intellect, moderation and unrelenting efforts to bring Islam to a larger audience have gained him the respect of millions of Muslims and non-Muslims worldwide. His famous Television program Ash-Shariah wal-Hayat (Sharia and Life) has an estimated 700-800 million viewers worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;King Faisal International Prize, [https://kfip.org/professor-yousef-a-al-qaradawi/ Biography Yousef A. Al-Qaradawi], 10 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his fame. In 2012, Qardawi traded barbs with fellow Muslim cleric [[Abu Abd al-Rahman Ibn Aqil al-Zahiri]] due to what Ibn Aqil perceived as hypocritical positions of Qardawi during the [[Arab Spring]],&lt;ref&gt;Khalid al-Saif, [http://www.alsharq.net.sa/2012/10/06/521116 "This is what Ibn Aqil said about Qardawi!"] 6 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; a charge he denied.

Pakistani scholar, [[Muhammad Taqi Usmani]] stated, "There is no doubt that I—as the lowest student of Islamic [[Fiqh]]—with my benefitting from the books of the outstanding Dr al-Qaradāwī to a very large extent, and my supreme wonderment at the majority of [his works], have found myself, in some particular issues, not in agreement with him in the results that he has arrived at, but these sorts of differences (ikhtilāf) in views based on juristic judgement (ijtihādī) are natural, and cannot be the [sole] basis for judging [their author] so long as the people of knowledge do not deem [the bearers of such opinions] to be weak intellectually, or in religion, and [in any case] the importance of these books and their value in scholarship and da'wa are not affected by this to even the slightest, most insignificant degree."

In addition, he refers to some modern scholars by writing, "What we see today, very unfortunately, is that the one who brings forward elevated ideas in his writings and lofty theories in his speech and his sermons often does not rise above the level of the layman" but exempts Qardawi by saying, "As for the outstanding, erudite scholar, Dr Yūsuf al-Qaradāwī, may God (Most High) preserve him, God (Most High) has indeed made me fortunate enough to accompany him in travels and in residence, and sit with him and closely associate with him in long and repeated meetings. [From this] I found him manifest in his personality exemplary Islamic qualities, for he is a human being before he is a Muslim, and a devoted Muslim before he is a caller to Islam (dā'i), and a caller to Islam before he is a scholar and jurist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Uthmani |first=Muhammad Taqi |title=Yūsuf al-Qaradāwī, as I Have Known Him |url=http://www.suhaibwebb.com/islam-studies/yusuf-al-qaradawi-as-i-have-known-him-by-mufti-taqi-uthmani-h/ |publisher=SuhaibWebb |accessdate=28 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407064234/http://www.suhaibwebb.com/islam-studies/yusuf-al-qaradawi-as-i-have-known-him-by-mufti-taqi-uthmani-h/ |archivedate=7 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Doğu Türkistan Bülteni Haber Ajansı, which supports the [[Turkistan Islamic Party]], attacked Yusuf al-Qaradawi and called his creed "perverted" and claimed that he was followed by "democratic polytheists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=10 December 2016 |title=Amerikancı Sapıkların Alimi Yusuf El Kardavi-Video Haber |url=http://www.doguturkistanbulteni.com/2016/12/10/amerikanci-sapiklarin-alimi-yusuf-el-kardavi/ |newspaper= Doğu Türkistan Bülteni Haber Ajansı |location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Qaradawi was attacked by [[Hani Al-Siba'i]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people= |date=6 October 2010 |year= |title=الدكتور هاني السباعي يفحم الشيخ القرضاوي|trans-title= |medium= |language= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLkz2qU-n5c |accessdate= |format= |time= |location= |publisher= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

===On Syria and Russia===
Qaradawi stated that [[Russia]] is an "enemy of Islam" due to the country's military relations with the Syrian regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onislam.net/english/news/europe/459988-qaradawi-russia-censure-wins-chechen-ire.html |title=Qaradawi Russia Censure Wins Chechen Ire - Europe - News |publisher=OnIslam.net |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His remarks drew harsh criticism from Muslims in Russia. According to [[Chechnya|Chechen]] President [[Ramzan Kadyrov]],  "Qaradawi's statements had given rise to amazement among the Muslims of Russia." Kadyrov asserted that Qaradawi's statements are mainly "directed against the [[Islam in Russia|Muslims of Russia]], who are citizens of this country, were born here and live here, and who care about their country".&lt;ref name="interfax-religion.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=news&amp;div=10080 |title=Interfax-Religion |publisher=Interfax-Religion |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kadyrov claimed that "It is not Russia that is supplying weapons and money for the thousands of mercenaries from all over the world who have flooded Syria and are committing daily terrorist attacks, in which the blood of women, old people and children is shed,"&lt;ref name="interfax-religion.com"/&gt;

===Entry into western countries===
Al-Qaradawi has been banned from entering the United States since 1999 and the United Kingdom since 2008,&lt;ref name="BBC 2008-02-07"&gt;{{cite news|title=Muslim cleric not allowed into UK|date=7 February 2008|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7232398.stm| publisher=BBC News |accessdate=8 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; though he visited London in 2004.&lt;ref name="miausma"&gt;[http://ctc.usma.edu/atlas/Atlas-ResearchCompendium.pdf Militant Ideology Atlas] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110125033625/http://ctc.usma.edu/atlas/Atlas-ResearchCompendium.pdf |date=25 January 2011 }}, Combating Terrorism Center, West Point&lt;/ref&gt; The lobby group [[MEMRI]] said it helped play a role in the measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.memri.org/reports/sheikh-yousef-al-qaradhawi-barred-uk |title= Sheikh Yousef Al-Qaradhawi Barred from U.K.  |last= |first= |date=3 August 2009 |website=MEMRI |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2003, he visited [[Stockholm]], Sweden, for a conference at the [[Stockholm Mosque]] arranged by the [[Muslim Association of Sweden]]. During the conference al-Qaradawi expressed his support for suicide attacks against Israeli civilians, calling the fight against the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian Territories a "necessary Jihad".&lt;ref name=DN&gt;{{cite news|first=Fredrik |last=Malm|authorlink=Fredrik Malm|title=Massmordspredikan i svensk moské|url=http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=572&amp;a=172705 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041104021932/http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=572&amp;a=172705|archivedate=4 November 2004 |publisher=[[Dagens Nyheter]]|date=21 August 2003|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; France announced in March 2012 it will not let him enter.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17512436 France election: Sarkozy vows ban on militant preachers], BBC, 26 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fatwa controversy with MEMRI===
The [[Middle East Media Research Institute]] (MEMRI) (citing ''[[Asharq Al-Awsat]]''), alleges that al-Qaradawi issued a Fatwa following the [[Iraqi insurgency (Iraq War)|Iraqi insurgency]], saying,

&lt;blockquote&gt;All of the Americans in Iraq are combatants, there is no difference between civilians and soldiers, and one should fight them, since the American civilians came to Iraq in order to serve the occupation. The abduction and killing of Americans in Iraq is a [religious] obligation so as to cause them to leave Iraq immediately. The mutilation of corpses [however] is forbidden in Islam.&lt;ref name="www_memri_org11"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.memri.org/bin/articles.cgi?Page=subjects&amp;Area=jihad&amp;ID=SP79404#_edn1|title=Memri| accessdate=18 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Al-Qaradawi, however, denies this allegation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have not published a Fatwa on this issue. At the Egyptian Journalists' Union a few days ago I was asked about the permissibility of fighting against the occupation in Iraq, and I answered that it is permitted. Afterwards I was asked concerning the American civilians in Iraq and I merely responded with the question – are there American civilians in Iraq? It is a matter of common knowledge that in Fatwas such as these I do not use the word "killing" but rather I say "struggle", which is a more comprehensive word than the word "killing" and whose meaning is not necessarily to kill. In addition, I have condemned the taking of hostages on a number of occasions in the past and have demanded that they be released and that their lives not be threatened.&lt;ref&gt;MEMRI as above, citing ''[[Al Hayat]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Shaker Al-Nabulsi]], a former Muslim&lt;ref name="www_memri_org12"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.memri.org/bin/articles.cgi?Page=subjects&amp;Area=jihad&amp;ID=SP79404#_edn20|title=Reactions to Sheikh Al-Qaradhawi's Fatwa Calling for the Abduction and Killing of American Civilians in Iraq|accessdate=13 October 2008|publisher=Memri}}&lt;/ref&gt; who writes for the liberal site Ethal, called for the creation of a petition to the UN calling to put Qaradawi and his like on trial for incitement and support of terrorism.&lt;ref name="www_memri_org12"/&gt;

===Alcohol fatwa controversy===
Al-Qaradawi issued a fatwa in 2008 stating that the consumption of tiny amounts of alcohol (&lt;0.005% concentration or 5/1000) was acceptable for Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harrison |first=Frances |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7342425.stm |title=Alcohol fatwa sparks controversy |publisher=BBC News |date=11 April 2008 |access-date=11 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement was made regarding [[energy drink]]s, where fermentation occurs naturally as part of the production process. This does not contradict{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} the widespread view that consuming alcohol is totally forbidden to Muslims. The fermentation in this process is natural and unavoidable, similarly it is an extremely small proportion.

==Terrorist allegations==

In October 2004 according to Saudi Arabia's newspaper "The Arab News" based in New York and Jeddah, over 2,500 Muslim intellectuals from 23 countries signed a petition addressed to the United Nations to raise awareness on the use of religion for incitement to violence. Al-Qaradawi was mentioned among "the sheikhs of death," as the signatories defined those who manipulate religion to incite violence, for "providing a religious cover for terrorism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabnews.com/node/257332|title=Stop Terror Sheikhs, Muslim Academics Demand|work=Arab News}}&lt;/ref&gt; A charge al-Qaradawi dismissed as baseless and slanderous. For his stance, he was against [[Salafism]] ([[Wahhabism]]) extremist ideology culminating from [[Saudi Arabia]] itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2014/07/05/Qaradawi-says-jihadist-caliphate-violates-sharia-.html|title=Qaradawi says 'jihadist caliphate' violates sharia|work=Al Arabiyah English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Consortium Against Terrorist Finance'' reports that, in 2010, Qaradawi was listed as the chairman of the Sharia supervisory board of [[Qatar Islamic Bank]], one of the Qatari sharia-compliant giants which has allegedly a long history of cooperation with controversial financial entities.&lt;ref name="stopterrorfinance.org"/&gt; He is also a former Sharia adviser and shareholder to [[Al Taqwa Bank|Bank al-Taqwa]], once listed by the U.S and the UN as a terrorist financier associated with al-Qaeda but delisted in 2010.&lt;ref name="stopterrorfinance.org"/&gt;

He is a trustee of the [[Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies]]&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"/&gt; and has been named as the technical consultant for a multimillion-dollar [[English-language]] film about [[Prophet Muhammed|Mohammed]], produced by [[Barrie Osborne]].&lt;ref name="zawya.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GuardianBiopic"/&gt; A 2008 ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' online poll put him at No.3 in the list of the Top 20 Public Intellectuals worldwide.&lt;ref name="foreignpolicy.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2008/06/16/the_world_s_top_20_public_intellectuals|title=The World's Top 20 Public Intellectuals|publisher=Foreign Policy|date=16 June 2008|accessdate=11 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
Al -Qaradawi has authored more than 120 books&lt;ref name="spiegel"/&gt; and his academic style and objective thought are considered to be some of the main characteristics of his works.&lt;ref name="AnaSoage"/&gt; His most famous work is ''The Lawful and Prohibited in Islam''. Professor Mustafa al-Zarqa declared that owning a copy of it was "the duty of every Muslim family".

===''Fiqh al-Zakat''===
His book ''Fiqh al-Zakat'' is considered by some as the most comprehensive work in the area of [[zakat]]. [[Abul Ala Maududi]] commented on it as "the book of this century in Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh)"&lt;ref name="AnaSoage"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DubaiAward"/&gt;
The prominent [[Deobandi]] [[Islamic scholar]] [[Muhammad Taqi Usmani]], said this about the work:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.suhaibwebb.com/islam-studies/yusuf-al-qaradawi-as-i-have-known-him-by-mufti-taqi-uthmani-h/ Yūsuf al-Qaradāwī, as I Have Known Him] ({{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407064234/http://www.suhaibwebb.com/islam-studies/yusuf-al-qaradawi-as-i-have-known-him-by-mufti-taqi-uthmani-h/ |date=7 April 2014 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The first book that read in its entirety of his works is his valuable book Fiqh al-Zakat, and I benefitted much from this great, encyclopedic, rewarding work through which the author did a great service to the second of the pillars of Islam, in a way that the umma needs today, when it comes to the application of zakat at the level of the individual and the group. Indeed this work manifested the genius of its author, and his inventive methodology, not only in the clarification of issues pertaining to zakat and their compilation, but in stimulating research in contemporary topics that no one before him had touched upon, and basing them upon the principles fiqh and its jurisprudential theory.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Fiqh al-Jihad''===
His book ''Fiqh al-Jihad'' has been widely commented on. ''[[The Guardian]]'' writes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/aug/17/islam-jihad-qaradawi|title=Yusuf Qaradawi's new jihad - Ewan Stein|author=Ewan Stein|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Instead Qaradawi encourages a "middle way" conception of jihad: "solidarity" with the Palestinians and others on the front line, rather than violence, is an obligatory form of jihad. Financial jihad, which corresponds with the obligation of alms giving (zakat), counts as well. And Muslims should recognise that technological change means that media and information systems are as much a part of the jihadist repertoire as are guns. Indeed, as long as Muslims are free to use media and other resources to press their case, there is no justification for using force to "open" countries for Islam.}}

This book has also been analyzed by [[University of Southern California]] professor [[Sherman Jackson]] and Tunisian Islamist scholar-politician [[Rachid Ghannouchi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casaw.ac.uk/conf/rj2009/documents/ReThinkingJihad2009Report.pdf Rethinking Jihad: Ideas, Politics and Conflict in the Arab World and Beyond Conference Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911205818/http://www.casaw.ac.uk/conf/rj2009/documents/ReThinkingJihad2009Report.pdf |date=11 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His views on jihad have attracted criticism from some hard line groups.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

The '''Zabbaleen''' ({{lang-arz|زبالين}} ''{{transl|arz|Zabbalīn}}'', {{IPA-arz|zæbbæˈliːn|IPA}}) is a word which literally means "garbage people" in [[Egyptian Arabic]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;Assaad, Ragui. (1996) Formalizing the Informal? The Transformation of Cairo’s Refuse Collection System. ''Journal of Planning Education &amp; Research'', vol. 16, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporary use of the word in Egyptian Arabic is to mean "garbage collectors". In cultural contexts, the word refers to teenagers and adults who have served as [[Cairo]]'s informal garbage collectors since approximately the 1940s. The Zabbaleen (singular: {{lang|arz|زبال}} ''{{transl|arz|Zabbāl}}'', {{IPA-arz|zæbˈbæːl|}}) are also known as Zarraba (singular: Zarrab), which means "pig-pen operators."&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; The word ''{{transl|arz|Zabbalīn}}'' came from the Egyptian Arabic word ''{{transl|arz|zebāla}}'' ({{IPA-arz|zeˈbæːlæ|}}, {{lang|arz|زبالة}}) which means "garbage".

Spread out among seven different settlements scattered in the [[Greater Cairo]] Urban Region, the Zabbaleen population is between 50,000 and 70,000.&lt;ref name=autogenerated15&gt;Fahmi, Wael &amp; Sutton, Keith. (2006) Cairo’s Zabbaleen Garbage Recyclers: Multi-nationals’ Takeover and State Relocation Plans.''Habitat International'', vol. 30, p. 812.&lt;/ref&gt; The largest settlement is [[Mokattam]] village, nicknamed "[[Garbage City]]," located at the foot of the Mokattam Mountains, next to [[Manshiyat naser|Manshiyat Naser]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated10&gt;[http://www.socsci.umn.edu/%7Ebongman/urbansustainability/assad.htm Assad, R., (1998), Upgrading the Mokattam Zabbaleen (Garbage Collectors) Settlement in Cairo: What Have We Learned?], Paper Presented at the Macarthur Consortium on International Peace and Cooperation Symposium on The Challenge of Urban Sustainability.&lt;/ref&gt; The Zabbaleen community in Mokattam Village has a population of around 20,000 to 30,000, over 90 percent of which are [[Coptic Christians]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marinathemovie.com|title=''Marina of the Zabbaleen'', directed by Engi Wassef.

For several generations, the Zabbaleen supported themselves by collecting trash door-to-door from the residents of Cairo for nearly no charge. Notably, the Zabbaleen [[recycle]] up to 80 percent of the waste that they collect, whereas most Western garbage collecting companies can only recycle 20 to 25 percent of the waste that they collect.&lt;ref name=autogenerated17&gt;Fahmi, Wael &amp; Sutton, Keith.

The Zabbaleen use donkey-pulled carts and pick-up trucks to transport the garbage that they collect from the residents of Cairo, transport the garbage to their homes in Mokattam Village, sort the garbage there, and then sell the sorted garbage to middlemen or create new materials from their recycled garbage. The living situation for the Zabbaleen is poor, especially since they live amongst the trash that they sort in their village and with the pigs to which they feed their organic waste. Nevertheless, the Zabbaleen have formed a strong and tight-knit community. However, their existence and way of life has come under threat after the Cairo municipal authorities’ decision in 2003 to award annual contracts of $50 million to three [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] garbage disposal companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2003/661/eg6.htm|title=Cairo Cleanup Conundrums|first=Dena|last=Rashed|publisher=Al-Ahram Weekly|date=October 23–29, 2003|accessdate=October 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rashed"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2003/624/fe1.htm|title=Trashed Lives|first=Dena|last=Rashed|publisher=Al-Ahram Weekly|date=February 6–12, 2003|accessdate=October 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fahmi, Wael &amp; Sutton, Keith.

The government authorities do not compensate the Zabbaleen for these changes, and as a result, the takeover of waste collection threatens the socio-economic sustainability of the Zabbaleen community.&lt;ref name=autogenerated20&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.garbagedreams.com/|title=Garbage Dreams|website=garbagedreams.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the Zabbaleen have faced another challenge when the Egyptian Agricultural Ministry ordered the culling of all pigs in April 2009, in response to national fears over the possible spread of [[H1N1 influenza]].&lt;ref name="Slackman"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/25/world/middleeast/25oink.html?scp=3&amp;sq=garbage%20city%20cairo&amp;st=cse|title=Cleaning Cairo, but Taking a Livelihood|first=Michael|last=Slackman|publisher=The New York Times|date=May 24, 2009|accessdate=October 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fahmi, Wael  &amp; Sutton, Keith. (2010) Cairo’s Contested Garbage: Sustainable Solid Waste Management and the Zabbaleen’s Right to the City.''Sustainability'', vol. 2, p. 1773.&lt;/ref&gt;

This governmental decision poses a major setback to the Zabbaleen because pigs are an essential component to their recycling and sorting system, in which the pigs eat all of the organic waste. Immediately after the culling of pigs, observers have noticed a visible increase of trash piles and piles of rotting food on the streets of Cairo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/20/world/africa/20cairo.html?_r=1|title=Belatedly, Egypt Spots Flaws in Wiping Out Pigs|first=Michael|last=Slackman|publisher=The New York Times|date=September 19, 2009|accessdate=October 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also worries that the Egyptian government is seeking to remove the Mokattam village entirely and relocate the Zabbaleen further outside of Cairo by a further 25&amp;nbsp;km, to a 50-feddan plot (1 feddan = {{convert|1.038|acre|ha|order=flip|disp=or}}) in Cairo's eastern desert settlement of Katameya.&lt;ref&gt;Fahmi, Wael &amp; Sutton, Keith.

==Historical background==

===First wave of migration===
Around the 1910s, a group of Muslim migrants from the Dakhla oasis in the [[Libyan Desert|Western desert]] of [[Egypt]] relocated to [[Cairo]] in an area known as Bab El Bahr, which is situated between Attaba and Ramses square in downtown [[Cairo]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated14&gt;Fahmi, Wael Salah.(2005) The Impact of Privatization of Solid Waste Management on the Zabbaleen Garbage Collectors of Cairo. ''Environment &amp; Urbanization'', vol. 17, no. 2, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated13&gt;Fahmi, Wael  &amp; Sutton, Keith. (2010) Cairo’s Contested Garbage: Sustainable Solid Waste Management and the Zabbaleen’s Right to the City.

(2006) Cairo’s Zabbaleen Garbage Recyclers: Multinationals’ Takeover and State Relocation Plans. ''Habitat International'', vol. 30, p. 811.&lt;/ref&gt; These people are known as the Wahiya (singular: wahi), which means people of the oasis.&lt;ref name=autogenerated13 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt; The Wahiya assumed the sole responsibility for the collection and disposal of Cairo's household waste under the framework of contracts with building owners in Cairo. In this system, the Wahiya paid the owners of buildings an initial sum and then collected monthly fees from the tenants for their services.&lt;ref name=autogenerated14 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated13 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;Fahmi, Wael &amp; Sutton, Keith. (2006) Cairo’s Zabbaleen Garbage Recyclers: Multinationals’ Takeover and State Relocation Plans. ''Habitat International'', vol. 30, p. 812.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second wave of migration===
In the 1930s and 40s, there was a second wave of migration. This new group, mostly landless peasants, is known as the Zabbaleen. The descendants of subsistence farmers, the Zabbaleen originate from the [[El Badari]] district in [[Asyut]], a rural region in [[Upper Egypt]], which is the southern part of Egypt.&lt;ref name=autogenerated14 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated13 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt; As farming ceased to be a viable way of life, the Zabbaleen faced economic hardships which prompted them to migrate to Cairo in search of work. Henceforth, the Wahiya collaborated with the Zabbaleen, who purchased waste from the Wahiya for use as fodder for pig farming. Initially, the Zabbaleen settled in the Imbaba district of the Giza governorate, but were given a four-day eviction notice from the governor of Giza in 1970.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt; Thereafter, the Zabbaleen settled mainly in an abandoned quarry at the foot of the Mokattam hills, east of Cairo, which is under the jurisdiction of the Cairo Governorate.&lt;ref name=autogenerated12&gt;[http://www.waste.nl/content/download/788/5692/file/Field%20study%20report%20Egypt%20ebook.pdf Aziz, H., (2004), 'Improving the livelihood of child waste pickers: experiences with the ‘Zabbaleen’ in Cairo, Egypt'], Waste, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the governor of Cairo granted the Zabbaleen administrative permission to settle in the area, he did not issue a lease or legal tenure. Thus, because of their precarious situation, the Zabbaleen initially lived in makeshift settlements of tin huts, made mostly of barrels that the Zabbaleen found amongst the waste that they collected.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated14 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated13 /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated19"/&gt; This Zabbaleen community later emerged as the informal garbage collectors and recyclers of Cairo. The literal meaning of the word Zabbaleen is garbage-men (singular: Zabbal). The Zabbaleen are also known as Zarraba (singular: Zarrab), which means pig pen operators, because they raise pigs that eat the organic components of the waste that they collect.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;

===1989 agreement between Wahiya and Zabbaleen===
Prior to the migration of the Zabbaleen, the Wahiya had used the refuse, after drying it, as a source of energy, specifically as fuel for public baths and bean cookeries.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; However, this use of dried refuse became obsolete in the 1930s when fuel oil became the preferred fuel for public baths and bean cookeries. This coincided with the migration of the Zabbaleen, who used the organic components of the wastes to feed their pigs.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; Thus, the Wahiya began to sell the organic refuse to the Zabbaleen.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; Because the Zabbaleen needed to obtain waste food before it rots, they preferred to collect the refuse themselves using their own donkey carts.

Therefore, the Zabbaleen can be distinguished from the Wahiya in at least two significant ways.

First, the Wahiya retained control over the access and collection rights to the monthly fees paid by the residents, whereas the Zabbaleen usually do not have a share in the monthly fees paid by residents. In fact, the Zabbaleen are often obliged to pay the Wahiya in order to gain access to the waste garbage.&lt;ref name=autogenerated15 /&gt; However, what the Zabbaleen do acquire are the rights to the refuse itself.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Assaad, Ragui. (1996) Formalizing the Informal? The Transformation of Cairo’s Refuse Collection System. ''Journal of Planning Education &amp; Research'', vol. 16, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the relationship between the Wahiya and the Zabbaleen was hierarchically constituted. The Wahiya acted as the middlemen between the Zabbaleen and Cairo's households.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt; Quoting Assaad, "The wahiya assume overall responsibility for regular removal of the wastes ''vis-à-vis'' residents and building owners and are responsible for collection of the wastes from individual dwelling units to the street level. The Zabbaleen, on the other hand, are responsible for the haulage and disposal of the wastes."&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

[[File:Zabbaleen-donkey.jpg|thumb|A [[Donkey]] at Mokattam Hill in Cairo]] 
Second, the Zabbaleen are the group that actually collects the garbage on donkey-pulled carts, separate out recyclables, breed pigs, an important component of their recycling system, and engage in a highly efficient process of recycling, whereas the Wahiya do not.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt; The Zabbaleen also sell the sorted secondary materials such as paper, tin, glass, plastic materials, rags, and aluminum cans to intermediaries.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;Fahmi, Wael Salah.(2005) The Impact of Privatization of Solid Waste Management on the Zabbaleen Garbage Collectors of Cairo.''Environment &amp; Urbanization'', vol. 17, no.2, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; Because Cairenes are generally not aware of the distinction between the wahiya and the Zabbaleen (also called zarraba), they continue to refer to both groups as Zabbaleen. It should be noted, however, that these two groups are distinct, serving different functions in the [[informal economy]] of collecting Cairo's [[municipal solid waste]] (MSW).&lt;ref&gt;Assaad, Ragui. (1996) Formalizing the Informal? The Transformation of Cairo’s Refuse Collection System.''Journal of Planning Education &amp; Research'', vol. 16, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to government pressures to upgrade and modernize the refuse collection system, the Wahiya and the Zabbaleen made an agreement which resulted in the establishment of the Environmental Protection Company, as a private-for-profit company in 1989.&lt;ref name=autogenerated13 /&gt; Within the framework of the EPC, the wahiya contracted groups of Zabbaleen to collect and dispose of MSW. The Wahiya continued to collect the user fees from tenants, but also resumed the responsibility to cover hauling costs out of the fees they collected for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Assaad, Ragui. (1996) Formalizing the Informal? The Transformation of Cairo’s Refuse Collection System. ''Journal of Planning Education &amp; Research'', vol. 16, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; The formation of the EPC was significant in that it established the Wahiya and the Zabbaleen as key participants in the collection of MSW, even though responsibility for MSW had been shared between the municipal sanitation service and the Zabbaleen since many prior decades.&lt;ref name=autogenerated14 /&gt;

The municipal authorities grew increasingly intolerant of the Zabbaleen's donkey carts, which, according to Assaad, were considered an eyesore and a traffic hazard by the government.&lt;ref&gt;Assaad, Ragui. (1996) Formalizing the Informal? The Transformation of Cairo’s Refuse Collection System.''Journal of Planning Education &amp; Research'', vol. 16, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; This was precisely in the neighborhoods that were being more fully served given Cairo's narrow, winding streets that are not wide-enough for large garbage trucks. Regardless, in the early 1990s, according to Fahmi &amp; Sutton, the garbage collectors had to comply with the municipality's requirements to use motorized trucks, rather than donkey carts, as the authorities introduced a system of mechanization to transport solid waste.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt; Because the Zabbaleen were required to accommodate to these new requirements for a mechanized system without any government support, including technical, financial, or educational support, they resorted to the selling of small plots of land back in their ancestral villages, use of personal savings, or credit loans to acquire the necessary capital to purchase the trucks.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt; According to Fahmi, within the EPC, the Wahiya conducted administration, marketed the company's services, collected the fees from tenants, and supervised service deliveries. On the other end, the Zabbaleen, "many of whom might otherwise have been homeless and without employment, collected and transported the waste." In more recent years, as the Zabbaleen became more involved in the work, some received a minimal fee from the Wahiya.&lt;ref name=autogenerated14 /&gt;

==Zabbaleen settlements==

===Main settlements===
There are seven main settlements, in which the Zabbaleen reside in the Greater Cairo Urban Region: Ein El Sira, Moatamdia, El Bargil, Tora, Ezbet el Nakhl, [[Helwan]], and Mokattam.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt; Due to urban expansion, most of these 7 settlements have been moved by municipal authorities to more peripheral locations.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt; The number of Zabbaleen living in these areas total to about 60,000-70,000.&lt;ref name=autogenerated20 /&gt;  Of these settlements, Mokattam, also often known as [[Garbage City]], east of Cairo, is the largest settlement, situated at the foot of Mokattam mountain, with approximately 20,000 inhabitants. The Zabbaleen Settlement of Mokattam was created as a result of a series of [[evictions]] from the [[Imbaba]] area located in the [[Giza]] governorate, notably when the Zabbaleen were given a four-day eviction notice from the governor of Giza in 1970.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greiss, S &amp; et al. [http://www.swlf.ait.ac.th/IntlConf/Data/ICSSWM%20web/FullPaper/Session%20VIII/8_02%20_Yasmin_.pdf  Recycling the Rejects of the Rejects; Protection of the Environment and Poverty Alleviation by Job Creation to Youth] Proceedings of the international Conference on Sustainable Solid Waste Management, p. 410.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Mokattam village is relatively close to the center of Cairo, it is very inaccessible because it is situated on a plateau surrounded by the cliffs of the Mokattam hills on one side and by the [[Manshiet Nasser]] squatter settlement on the other side.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt; Vehicular access to the Zabbaleen Mokattam is possible only through three entrances, two of which are accessible only by crossing through the crowded, narrow, and steep streets of Manshiet Nasser.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt; Because of the high congestion and road traffic, conflicts between the residents of the Manshiet Nasser settlement and the Zabbaleen, who need to haul their donkey carts loaded with garbage through the streets of Manshiet Nasser have often broken out. Occasionally, these conflicts took on religious overtones, as the inhabitants of the Manshiet Nasser settlement are mostly [[Muslims]], whereas the inhabitants of the Mokattam settlement are mostly [[Coptic Christians]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt;

Mokattam village is situated at the foot of the Mokattam mountains, which has proven to be a precarious geographic location. In 1993, there was a rockslide from Mokattam Mountain, which fell near the bordering area of the Zabbaleen settlement, resulting in the deaths of 40 people.&lt;ref name=autogenerated11&gt;Fahmi, Wael &amp; Sutton, Keith. (2006) Cairo’s Zabbaleen Garbage Recyclers: Multinationals’ Takeover and State Relocation Plans.''Habitat International'', vol. 30, p. 815.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, in 2008, another rock slide from the Mokattam hills killed more than 100 people in El-Duweiqa, another shantytown in the Mokattam district.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/news/duweiqa-still-between-rock-and-hard-place|title=Duweiqa: Still Between a Rock and Hard Place|first=Pakinma|last=Amer|publisher=Al-Masry-Al-Youm|date=November 17, 2009|accessdate=October 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rock slides have brought attention to the precarious location of shantytowns located below the Mokattam mountains as well as to the Zabbaleen.&lt;ref&gt;Fahmi, Wael  &amp; Sutton, Keith. (2010) Cairo’s Contested Garbage: Sustainable Solid Waste Management and the Zabbaleen’s Right to the City.''Sustainability'', vol. 2, p. 1766.&lt;/ref&gt; Some attribute these frequent rock slides to various development and construction activities on Mokattam Mountain's upper plateau on which the upper middle class residential district of Mokattam City is located.&lt;ref&gt;Fahmi, Wael  &amp; Sutton, Keith. (2010) Cairo’s Contested Garbage: Sustainable Solid Waste Management and the Zabbaleen’s Right to the City. ''Sustainability'', vol. 2, p. 1766.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Living conditions===
The living conditions in [[Mokattam]] Village, and the other Zabbaleen settlements, are poor. According to Assad,{{who|date=June 2012}} in the 1970s, “the streets were so stacked with heaps of assorted refuse that some of them could not be located. The air was heavily polluted by the smoke generated from fires that were either lit deliberately to dispose of unwanted waste, or resulted from the spontaneous combustion of organic residues.”&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt; There have been frequent fires in Mokattam, two of which were particularly severe and devastated the settlement in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt; In its early years, the Mokattam Settlement lacked basic services; there were no health centers, pharmacies, or schools. Basic amenities such as piped water, sewage networks, and electricity were also missing.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt; During the beginning decades of the Mokattam settlement, the community suffered from “high mortality and morbidity rates (especially among children), poor environmental conditions, and low income.”&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt; In 1983, the average household income per month was estimated at LE 70(approximately US$11.50 in January 2005) within the lowest 10th percentile of national urban income levels, with an average large household size of 8 persons.&lt;ref name=autogenerated15 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt; However, the living conditions of the Mokattam settlement improved after the Mokattam settlement received significant funding from the [[World Bank]], in its upgrading program known as the Zabbaleen Environmental Development Program (ZEDP) in 1981 and from other international donors.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt;

===Health===
The Zabbaleen community is characterized by both low health and high rates of disease, especially those related to their garbage collecting activities.&lt;ref&gt;Greiss, S &amp; et al.[http://www.swlf.ait.ac.th/IntlConf/Data/ICSSWM%20web/FullPaper/Session%20VIII/8_02%20_Yasmin_.pdf  Recycling the Rejects of the Rejects; Protection of the Environment and Poverty Alleviation by Job Creation to Youth] Proceedings of the international Conference on Sustainable Solid Waste Management, p. 491.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Assad,  "reported infant [[mortality rates]], particularly from [[tetanus]], were extremely high. In 1981, infant mortality was estimated at about 240 deaths per thousand births (EQI Report #3, 1981: 36)."&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt; This infant mortality rate dropped to 117 per thousand in 1991, but the infant mortality rate in the Mokattam community is still substantially higher than the average infant mortality rate of Cairo for the 1990-95 period, which was 45.6 per thousand.&lt;ref name=autogenerated11 /&gt;

==Religion==
[[File:Church of Saint Simon, Muquattam, Cairo, Egypt1.jpg|thumb|Church of [[Simon the Tanner#Virgin Mary and St. Simon the Tanner Cathedral.2C Cairo|Saint Simon]], Muquattam, Cairo]]
[[File:St. Simon the Tanner's Hall.JPG|thumb|[[Simon the Tanner#Virgin Mary and St. Simon the Tanner Cathedral.2C Cairo|St. Simon the Tanner]]'s Hall]]

Egypt is a Muslim-majority country. However, over 90 percent of the Zabbaleen community in the Mokattam village are Coptic Christians.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Communities where almost everyone is Christian are rare to find in Egypt outside of the Zabbaleen community of Mokattam. According to Engi Wassef, in her commentary in her documentary film ''[[Marina of the Zabbaleen]]'', many people in the Zabbaleen village say that even if they could live outside of the village or buy a house elsewhere, they would not because they are happy to live within their own religious community and freely practice their religion.&lt;ref name=autogenerated19&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marinathemovie.com|title=''Marina of the Zabbaleen'', directed by Engi Wassef. Produced by "Torch Films"|website=marinathemovie.com|accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cave church===
The local Coptic Church in Mokattam Village was established in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socsci.umn.edu/%7Ebongman/urbansustainability/assad.htmAssad, R., (1998), Upgrading the Mokattam Zabbaleen (Garbage Collectors) Settlement in Cairo: What Have We Learned?], Paper Presented at the Macarthur Consortium on International Peace and Cooperation Symposium on The Challenge of Urban Sustainability.&lt;/ref&gt; After the establishment of the church, the Zabbaleen felt more secure in their location and only then began to use more permanent building materials, such as stone and bricks, for their homes. Given their previous experience of eviction from Giza in 1970, the Zabbaleen had lived in temporary tin huts up till that point.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt; In 1976, a large fire broke out in Manshiyat Nasir, which led to the beginning of the construction of the first church below the Mokattam mountain on a site of 1,000 square meters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cavechurch.com/Tin_Church/chronology.asp Cave Church Chronology], Retrieved: October 23, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; More churches have been built into the caves found in Mokattam. Currently, there are seven cave churches hidden among the caves of Mokattam Mountain. The Monastery of St. Simon the Tanner is the largest and it has an amphitheater with a seating capacity of 20,000.&lt;ref name=samaan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samaanchurch.com/en/|title=Saint Samaan The Tanner Monastery|website=samaanchurch.com|accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated18&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/tanner.htm|title=The Monastery of Saint Simon (Simeon) the Tanner|accessdate=2010-10-23|author=Lara Iskander}}, from official website of TourEgypt&lt;/ref&gt; This church is the largest church in the Middle East. It is named after the Coptic Saint, [[Simon the Tanner]], who lived at the end of the 10th century, when Egypt was ruled by the Muslim [[Fatimid]] [[Caliph]] [[Al-Muizz Lideenillah]]. [[Simon the Tanner]] is the Coptic Saint who is associated with the legend of the moving of the Mokattam Mountain. Adjacent churches to the Monastery of St. Simon the Tanner include the St. Bola's Church, St. Marks Church, and St. Simon the Tanner's Hall.&lt;ref name=samaan /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated18 /&gt; The cave churches of Mokattam are also a point of interest for many tourists visiting Cairo.

==Zabbaleen recycling methods==
Many sources state that the Zabbaleen have created one of the most efficient [[recycling]] systems in the world, which recycles up to 80 percent of all the waste that they collect.&lt;ref name=autogenerated17 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated20 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated12 /&gt; In contrast, most Western garbage collecting companies can only recycle about 20 to 25 percent of the waste that they collect.&lt;ref name=autogenerated20 /&gt; According to Fahmi, 2005, "it was estimated that, in 1997, the Zabbaleen informally handled one-third of the garbage of Cairo’s 14 million people, mainly that from poorer districts," meaning that  the Zabbaleen collected up to 3,000 tons of garbage every day.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; The Zabbaleen are able to recycle up to 80 percent of the waste that they collect through their family-run micro-enterprises that generate jobs, including those for production of handmade crafts from rags and paper, and incomes from some 40,000 people.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt; In fact, according to Fahmi, "in the mid-1990s, nearly 700 Zabbaleen families owned collection enterprises, 200 owned and operated small- and medium-scale recycling enterprises, and 120 owned trading enterprises, in addition to maintenance workshops and community-based service businesses."&lt;ref name="Fahmi, Wael Salah 2005 p. 158"&gt;Fahmi, Wael Salah.(2005) The Impact of Privatization of Solid Waste Management on the Zabbaleen Garbage Collectors of Cairo. ''Environment &amp; Urbanization'', vol. 17, no. 2, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; What is distinctive about the Zabbaleen from many other urban informal waste collecting-groups that scavenge trash for useful products is that the Zabbaleen invest heavily in their tools and know-how for recycling.  These Zabbaleen micro-entrepreneurs have invested "an estimated 2.1 million Egyptian pounds (LE) (US $ 1⁄4 LE 6.19 -May 2004 rates) in trucks, plastic granulators, paper compactors, cloth grinders, aluminium smelters, and tin processors."&lt;ref&gt;Fahmi, Wael &amp; Sutton, Keith. (2006) Cairo’s Zabbaleen Garbage Recyclers: Multi-nationals’ Takeover and State Relocation Plans. ''Habitat International'', vol. 30, p. 813.&lt;/ref&gt; By investing in such infrastructure, the Zabbaleen continually upgraded and enhanced their methods of recycling plastic, paper, cardboard, glass, metal, and fabrics. Thus, the city of [[Cairo]] and its administration had been able to manage its solid waste at almost no cost to the municipal administration because of such efforts by the Zabbaleen.&lt;ref name="Fahmi, Wael Salah 2005 p. 158"/&gt; Hence, the income that the Zabbaleen generate is mainly derived from their recycling and sorting activities, not from the minimal fees (LE 2-4) that they collect from residents.

===Trash collecting procedure===
There is a gender division of labor in the process of collecting and sorting the trash in the Zabbaleen system. Usually, it is the Zabbaleen men, sometimes accompanied by children, who go pick up the trash door-to-door from each household.&lt;ref&gt;Fahmi, Wael  &amp; Sutton, Keith. (2010) Cairo’s Contested Garbage: Sustainable Solid Waste Management and the Zabbaleen’s Right to the City. ''Sustainability'', vol. 2, p. 1768.&lt;/ref&gt; This trash is completely unsorted because there is not a system of recycling at the source in Egypt. It is rare for girls to go to collect the trash and it stops almost entirely after girls reach the age 10.&lt;ref name="autogenerated19"/&gt; The means of transportation that the Zabbaleen use to transport the trash that they collect are donkey-pulled carts and pickup trucks. After the Zabbaleen pick up the trash, they take the trash back to their village, a trip that may take anywhere from between 10 minutes to an hour.&lt;ref name="autogenerated19"/&gt;

===Sorting===
When the men return to the village with the collected trash, usually their families are waiting for them so that they can begin sorting the trash. The majority of those who sort the trash are women, while certain families specialize in sorting certain materials such as paper, plastic, aluminum, glass, etc. The women and children sort the garbage into 16 different types of trash and sort out the recyclables.&lt;ref name=autogenerated19 /&gt; The sorting of garbage is a time-consuming task in which women and children may spend up to 10 to 12 hours each day separating the garbage.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt; First, the trash is sorted into the main 16 categories, such as paper, plastic, cardboard, cans, etc. So for example, all different types of paper are placed into one pile while all different [[types of plastic]] are placed in another pile. Sorting within categories does not take place until after the trash is sorted first into the major categories.&lt;ref name=autogenerated19 /&gt; Then sorting within the category takes place. For instance, the major category of paper would be sorted into white paper, yellow paper, thick paper, newspaper, thin paper, etc. Each sub-sorted material is then sold to factories and middle-men for a marginal profit.

===Use of pigs===
The initial and very integral step of sorting the trash is the responsibility of Zabbaleen community members who own pigs. The pigs are fed the organic waste. After the organic waste has been eaten by the pigs, the rest of the trash is sorted into different categories such, as PT plastic, paper, cans, etc.&lt;ref name="autogenerated19"/&gt; Thus, as Engi Wassef, the director of ''Marina of the Zabbaleen'' notes, "One of the reasons why Coptic Christians are given a kind of monopoly status on the garbage collection and sorting system is because the Muslim religion does not allow for breeding or eating or living near pigs. It's considered a dirty animal."&lt;ref name="autogenerated19"/&gt;

In addition to their use in sorting out organic waste, pigs are an important source of income. After the pigs have grown, the Zabbaleen sell the pig-meat to large tourist facilities. According to Fahmi and Sutton, "Hitherto, the Zabbaleen claimed to collect 6,000 tons of MSW a day, of which 60% was food waste and organic garbage which their pigs consume. Every 6 months, the waste collectors sell adult pigs, 5 to 15 pigs to a trader for LE 7 per kilogram (US$ 1.25 per kilogram). The trader then takes pigs to the slaughterhouses, where a kilogram is sold for LE 30–35 (US$ 5–6.25). The waste collectors can earn around LE 450 (US$ 80) per pig."&lt;ref&gt;Fahmi, Wael  &amp; Sutton, Keith. (2010) Cairo’s Contested Garbage: Sustainable Solid Waste Management and the Zabaleen’s Right to the City. ''Sustainability'', vol. 2, p. 1774.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creation of goods using recycled materials===
After the sorting of materials is finished, the Zabbaleen sell the sorted materials, such as paper, tin, rags, plastic materials, cloth, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Fahmi, Wael  &amp; Sutton, Keith. (2010) Cairo’s Contested Garbage: Sustainable Solid Waste Management and the Zabbaleen’s Right to the City.''Sustainability'', vol. 2, p. 1768.&lt;/ref&gt; The Zabbaleen sell these sorted materials to factories that then reuse these products, such as paper, in the creation of new material. According to Engi Wassef, the director of the documentary film, ''Marina of the Zabbaleen'', [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PT plastic]], which is the plastic used to make plastic bottles for water and other beverages, is one of the most highly sought out materials.&lt;ref name=autogenerated19 /&gt; In the case of PT plastic, the Zabbaleen would even export this material to China. However, the simple re-sale of sorted materials is not the only activity that the Zabbaleen do in terms of re-using these materials. They also create new materials from the materials that they have sorted. For example, granulators are used to change regular opaque-colored plastic into small plastic pellets. From these plastic pellets, a variety of plastic product can then be made, including garbage bags and plastic hangers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated19 /&gt; Handmade crafts are also made from rags and paper.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt; Thus, the Zabbaleen system is a multi-tier system that is not limited to the simple collection of waste but also encompasses the creation of new materials from found recyclables.

===International recognition===
The official website of the documentary ''Garbage Dreams'' states that, "Far ahead of any modern 'Green' initiatives, the Zabbaleen survive by recycling 80 percent of the garbage they collect."&lt;ref name=autogenerated20 /&gt; By comparison, most Western garbage collecting companies can only recycle about 20 to 25 percent of the waste that they collect.&lt;ref name=autogenerated20 /&gt; After the takeover of the municipal waste collection, the three private companies, two from Spain and one from Italy, that were awarded with contracts to dispose of Cairo's trash were only required to recycled 20 percent of the trash that they collect.&lt;ref name=autogenerated20 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated16&gt;Fahmi, Wael  &amp; Sutton, Keith. (2010) Cairo’s Contested Garbage: Sustainable Solid Waste Management and the Zabaleen’s Right to the City. ''Sustainability'', vol. 2, p. 1772.&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of the trash that foreign companies do not recycle are placed into new landfills.&lt;ref name=autogenerated16 /&gt; The efficiency and environmental-friendliness of the Zabbaleen "waste collection and recycling system received major world recognition and approval at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992."&lt;ref name=autogenerated9&gt;Fahmi, Wael &amp; Sutton, Keith. (2006) Cairo’s Zabaleen Garbage Recyclers: Multi-nationals’ Takeover and State Relocation Plans. ''Habitat International'', vol. 30, p. 810.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mega-Cities Project sought to encourage the Zabbaleen system of waste collection and recycling as a model to be encouraged in other developing world cities such as Manila and Mumbai.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9 /&gt; The Zabbaleen waste collection system has received international funding from the World Bank, the Ford Foundation and Oxfam for specific projects to upgrade and improve the recycling of solid waste.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9 /&gt;

==Contracting out municipal waste collection==

===Selling of contracts to foreign companies===
In 2003, the government of Egypt sold annual contracts reaching US$50 million to international companies to collect Cairo's [[Municipal solid waste|solid waste]]. The three companies that were awarded with contracts for cleaning Cairo are FCC and Urbaser, Enser (both Spanish companies), and AMA (an Italian) company. The Egyptian Company for Garbage Collection, a domestic company was also awarded with contracts.&lt;ref&gt;Fahmi, Wael  &amp; Sutton, Keith. (2010) Cairo’s Contested Garbage: Sustainable Solid Waste Management and the Zabbaleen’s Right to the City.''Sustainability'', vol. 2, p. 1770.&lt;/ref&gt; There was a precedent for this approach to trash collection two years earlier, in 2001, when the government agreed to sign a contract with Onyx, a French company, to manage the waste of [[Alexandria]], the second largest city in Egypt. Through this contract, the Egyptian government agreed to pay $446 million to Onyx for the treatment of one million tons of waste per year for 15 years, a sum that was ten times greater than what the government had previously paid before for its municipal waste management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2002/575/sc3.htm|title=Capital Collection|first=Dena|last=Rashed|publisher=Al Ahram Weekly|date=February 28 – March 6, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact on Cairo===
Significantly, the foreign companies, despite the large value of their contracts, are only required to recycle 20 percent of the waste that they collect; the remaining 80 percent are placed into landfills.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Fahmi, Wael  &amp; Sutton, Keith. (2010) Cairo’s Contested Garbage: Sustainable Solid Waste Management and the Zabbaleen’s Right to the City.''Sustainability'', vol. 2, p. 1772.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the Zabbaleen recycle up to 80 percent of all the MSW that they collect. The foreign companies collected the trash from garbage bins placed at central collection points on the streets. However, many inhabitants of Cairo preferred the door-to-door garbage pick-up done by the Zabbaleen, especially because the bins were not plentifully located or located in inconvenient places.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Thus, residents expressed their discontent with the new system, especially because they were being charged more for what seemed to be a more inconvenient system. Under the new system, residents were required to pay a monthly bill for garbage collection that accompanies their electricity bill. The garbage collection fee was based upon the percentage of each electricity bill so that the garbage collection fee increases proportionately to electricity consumption.&lt;ref name="Rashed"/&gt; Two years after the new system was imposed, Rashed writes in the Al-Ahram Weekly, "residents of the governorate have been voicing increasingly vociferous complaints that the companies are working well below full capacity. The streets are not as clean as they were during the first days of the privatisation. Both company workers, and garbage receptacles, appear to be increasingly thin on the ground."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/694/sc3.htm|title=Unfinished Business|first=Dena|last=Rashed|publisher=Al Ahram Weekly|date=June 10–16, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact on Zabbaleen===
The subcontracting of MSW collection to foreign companies had an immediate negative impact upon the Zabbaleen community as documented in Mai Iskander's film, [[Garbage Dreams]]. Contracting out MSW to foreign companies meant that the Zabbaleen would lose access to garbage, which was the basis of their recycling and sorting activities. In the documentary [[Garbage Dreams]], Laila, a social worker in Mokattam Village, says, "The city contracted with foreign waste disposal companies because they perceived the Zabbaleen to be old-fashioned. But they didn't come tell us, "You need to modernize your ways." This was all done behind our backs. "we're replacing you with the companies." So we can be like the developed countries."&lt;ref name="autogenerated20"/&gt; In contrast, because officials from the Cairo Cleaning and Beautification Authority (CCBA) regarded the Zabbaleen recycling methods as unhygienic and backwards, they were optimistic about the process and hoped for a positive impact on Cairo's environment. However, because the mechanized equipment of the foreign companies are too large for the streets of Cairo, citizens were required to bring their trash to designated collection centers and bins, which were not always placed in easily accessible locations.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Therefore, residents preferred to continue to have their trash picked up from their doors by the Zabbaleen, who were able to come directly to their doors even if their homes were located in narrow alleys. Eventually, the foreign companies realized that they needed the Zabbaleen and thus, subcontracted them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/news/managing-cairo’s-solid-waste-we-need-get-our-hands-dirty-too|title=Managing Cairo's Solid Waste: We Need to Get Our Hands Dirty Too|first=Dana|last=Moussa|publisher=Al-masry Al-Youm|date=June 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system failed, however, because the companies underpaid the Zabbaleen. According to Fahmi and Sutton, "while company sources mention salaries ranging between LE 300 to LE 450 per month (US $50–$75), some Zabbaleen claim that the salaries on offer are actually closer to LE 150 per month." One Zabbal with eight children gave a similar figure: whereas he used to make LE 10 a day (US $1.60), foreign contractors offered him LE 5 a day.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

==Pig cull==

===Government order===
In April 2009, the first cases of the [[H1N1]] influenza were found in Mexico. By the end of that month, it was estimated that up to 169 people died due to the epidemic.&lt;ref name="Fraser"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8024946.stm|title=Egypt Slaughters Pigs to Stop Flu|first=Christian|last=Fraser|publisher=BBC News|date=April 29, 2009|accessdate=November 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
All of the deaths, except for one, occurred in Mexico. Egypt responded to this outbreak of H1N1 by ordering the culling of its swine population, an act which had a devastating impact on the livelihood of 70,000 Zabbaleen families.&lt;ref name="Fraser"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fahmi, Wael 2010"&gt;Fahmi, Wael &amp; Sutton, Keith. (2010) Cairo’s Contested Garbage: Sustainable Solid Waste Management and the Zabaleen’s Right to the City. Sustainability, vol. 2, p. 1774.&lt;/ref&gt; This decision was made not by the Health Ministry, but directly by the Parliament.&lt;ref name="Khalil"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/news/swine-flu-was-it-ever-really-threat|title=Swine Flu: Was it Every Really a Threat?|first=Ashraf|last=Khalil|publisher=Al-Masr Al-Youm|date=February 13, 2001|accessdate=November 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; International organizations, including the [[United Nations]] criticized the Egyptian government for its decision.&lt;ref name="Nadim"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/01/health/01egypt.html|title=Culling Pigs in Flu Fight, Egypt Angers Herders and Dismays U.N.|first=Audi|last=Nadim|publisher=The New York Times|date=April 30, 2009|accessdate=November 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt was the only country in the world to take such a drastic decision as to cull an estimated 300,000 pigs.&lt;ref name="Slackman"/&gt; This decision was made despite the general agreement that [[H1N1]] is not transmitted by pigs. Furthermore, there were no cases of swine flu found in Egypt during the time when the pig cull was executed.&lt;ref name="Fahmi, Wael 2010"/&gt; The actual slaughter of the pigs was ordered by the Egyptian Agricultural Ministry in April 2009.&lt;ref name="Fahmi, Wael 2010"/&gt; Although government authorities stated that the slaughtering itself was humane, and in accordance with Islamic law, witnesses testify a lot of cruelty and violence in the culling. According to Slackman, "Piglets were documented being stabbed and tossed into piles, large pigs beaten with metal rods, their carcasses dumped in the sand."&lt;ref name="Slackman"/&gt; [[H1N1]] influenza was officially declared as a pandemic by the [[World Health Organization]] in June 2009. The pandemic was then declared to be officially over by the [[World Health Organization]] on August 10, 2010.

===Explanations for the cull===
When first ordering the pig cull, the Egyptian government asserted that it was a precaution to forestall national fears of the imminent pandemic.&lt;ref name="Fahmi, Wael 2010"/&gt; Later, after the pig cull, the government stated that its decision to order the pig cull was directly affected by the global breakout of [[H5N1 virus]], more commonly known as bird flu, several years earlier and a fear that the two strains of viruses could possibly combine to form a more lethal virus.&lt;ref name="Khalil"/&gt; Later, the Egyptian government openly stated that the pig cull was no longer just an act to prevent swine flu; rather, it was part of a plan to clean up the Zabbaleen and allow them to live in sanitary conditions. According to Sabir Abdel Aziz Galal, chief of the infectious disease department in the Ministry of agriculture, "We want them to live a better life. humanely treated; it's a very difficult life."&lt;ref name="Slackman"/&gt; In contrast to the explanations officially given by the Egyptian government, many other observers, especially in the Western media, as well as the Zabbaleen themselves perceived a religious bias in the execution of the pig cull. In a [[New York Times]] article, Slackman asserted that, "The Zabbaleen are Christians. Egypt is a majority Muslim country. The Zabbaleen are convinced that the government wants to use the swine flu scare not to help improve their lives but to get pigs out of Egypt. Islam prohibits eating pork."&lt;ref name="Slackman"/&gt; In another New York Times article, Audi writes, "Most of Egypt's pig farmers are Christians, and some accuse the government of using swine flu fears to punish them economically."&lt;ref name="Nadim"/&gt; According to Rev. Samaan Ibrahim, a priest from a Zabbaleen neighborhood, "The bottom line is pigs are not welcome in Egypt."&lt;ref name="Slackman"/&gt; In an article by the [[BBC]], Fraser argues along a similar line, saying that the Coptic Christian minority were targeted by the government for a main source of their income, the rearing of pigs.&lt;ref name="Fraser"/&gt; A similar opinion is voiced by Engi Wassef in her documentary, ''[[Marina of the Zabbaleen]]''. Fahmi and Sutton echo a similar explanation: "The adverse effect of the slaughtering of the pigs on the Zabbaleen's livelihoods might be part of the ongoing gentrification of garbage city for land speculations and the taking over of their recycling economy by entrepreneurial businesses."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Fahmi, Wael &amp; Sutton, Keith. (2010) Cairo’s Contested Garbage: Sustainable Solid Waste Management and the Zabbaleen’s Right to the City. Sustainability, vol. 2, p. 1775.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect on the Zabbaleen===
[[File:Trash on a Street in Moqattam Village.jpg|thumb|Increased trash on a street in Mokattam village after pig cull]]

The pig cull negatively affected the Zabbaleen in several ways. First, because the pigs eat the organic waste, they are a vital component in their recycling system, the pig cull literally destroyed the Zabbaleen recycling system. Deprived of their pig herds, the Zabbaleen stopped collecting such organic trash, leaving food piles to rot in the streets, leading to the increase of trash in the streets.&lt;ref name="Fahmi, Wael 2010"/&gt; According to Engi Wassef, recycling and sorting activities in the Zabbaleen villages all but ceased after the pig cull, because without the pigs, the sorting and recycling activities of the Zabbaleen became economically unfeasible. Less trash was brought into the village, because there was no place to put the trash. Hence, the entire recycling system was broken, placing the Zabbaleen out of work.

Another negative effect of the pig cull on the Zabbaleen was the loss of the economic value of the pigs themselves. According to Fahmi and Sutton, pigs are the main source of income for the Zabbaleen.&lt;ref name="Fahmi, Wael 2010"/&gt; Before the cull, the Zabbaleen had collected 6,000 tons of MSW daily, of which 60 percent was organic waste which was consumed by the pigs.&lt;ref name="Fahmi, Wael 2010"/&gt; Every six months, the Zabbaleen would take their pigs to traders, earning around 450LE (approximately 80 USD) per pig.&lt;ref name="Fahmi, Wael 2010"/&gt; Although the Egyptian government made financial compensations for some of pigs slaughtered; compensations were not given to all of the Zabbaleen who lost pigs to the cull and those who received compensation received far less money compared to what they would have received  from selling the pigs to traders. According to one Zabbaleen pig breeder, "The government paid me between LE 50 (US$ 10) and LE 250 (US$ 50) for each pig I lost, depending on its size, whilst meat processors would have given me as much as LE 1,000 (US$ 200)."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The pig cull also resulted in increased cases of malnutrition and anaemia in Zabbaleen children because prior to the cull, pork had been the only affordable source of animal protein for most of the Zabbaleen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8185844.stm|title=Struggling After Egypt's Pig Cull|first=Christian|last=Fraser|publisher=BBC News|date=August 6, 2009|accessdate=November 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect on Cairo===
Many observers noticed an immediate increase in piles of trash on the streets of Cairo after the pig cull. Because in the Zabbaleen system of recycling, it is the pigs who initially eat the organic waste, the pig cull had a negative effect on the cleanliness of Cairo's streets. According to Khalil in an article by Al Masry Al Youm, "The elimination of the pigs prompted more trash than usual to immediately start clogging the streets of the capital."&lt;ref name="Khalil"/&gt; In a New York Times article from September 2009, Slackman states that the Egyptian government was warned before its actual execution that the pig cull, if executed, "the city would be overwhelmed with trash."&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/20/world/africa/20cairo.html?_r=1|title=Belatedly, Egypt Spots Flaws in Wiping Out Pigs|first=Michael|last=Slackman|publisher=The New York Times|date=September 19, 2009|accessdate=November 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slackman notes that after the pig cull, "rotting food piles up on the streets of middle-class neighborhoods like Heliopolis and in the poor streets of communities like Imbaba."&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; In an article by Bloomberg, Williams also observes a garbage crisis piling up on the streets of Cairo after the pig cull.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aMODvyHlOBAE|title=Swine-Flue Slaughter Leaves Cairo without Pigs to Devour Trash|first=Daniel|last=Williams|publisher=Bloomberg|date=September 28, 2009|accessdate=November 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This piling up of organic MSW became hazardous because the organic waste then became a source of infectious diseases and led to an increase of rat infestation.&lt;ref name="Fraser"/&gt;
