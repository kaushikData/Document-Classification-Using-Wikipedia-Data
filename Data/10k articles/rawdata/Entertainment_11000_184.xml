== History ==

=== Academic research ===
3D Repo version control system—still in its early stages of doctoral research—was originally demonstrated at the joint [[SIGGRAPH]] and Web3D conference in [[Los Angeles]], [[United States]] in August 2012 featuring the [[London King's Cross railway station#Restoration|King's Cross Station Redevelopment]] project by [[Arup Group|Arup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doboš|first=Jozef|last2=Steed|first2=Anthony|date=2012|title=3D Revision Control Framework|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2338714.2338736|journal=Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on 3D Web Technology|series=Web3D '12|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=121–129|doi=10.1145/2338714.2338736|isbn=9781450314329}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doboš|first=Jozef|last2=Steed|first2=Anthony|date=2012|title=3D Diff: An Interactive Approach to Mesh Differencing and Conflict Resolution|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2343045.2343064|journal=ACM SIGGRAPH 2012 Talks|series=SIGGRAPH '12|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=15:1–15:1|doi=10.1145/2343045.2343064|isbn=9781450316835}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, 3D Repo attended an invited lecture at [[German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence]] (DFKI) in [[Saarbrücken]], [[Germany]] which led to a collaboration and development of the first [[Representational state transfer|REST]] [[Application programming interface|API]] for the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://domino.mpi-inf.mpg.de/internet/events.nsf/0/7941CF10F149CE95C1257A8D00513219|title=Campus Event Calendar: Jozef Dobos (10/08/2012 in D 3 2/VizCenter, DFKI)|website=domino.mpi-inf.mpg.de|language=en|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doboš|first=Jozef|last2=Sons|first2=Kristian|last3=Rubinstein|first3=Dmitri|last4=Slusallek|first4=Philipp|last5=Steed|first5=Anthony|date=2013|title=XML3DRepo: A REST API for Version Controlled 3D Assets on the Web|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2466533.2466537|journal=Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on 3D Web Technology|series=Web3D '13|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=47–55|doi=10.1145/2466533.2466537|isbn=9781450321334}}&lt;/ref&gt; The front-end visualization was programmed in XML3D and was featured at Web3D 2013 in [[San Sebastián]], [[Spain]]. The main scientific advancement was the introduction of externalized web 3D resources in various encodings that enabled interactivity and prevented web browsers from becoming unresponsive while loading very large 3D models over the [[Internet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=3drepoorg|title=XML3DRepo: A REST API for Version Controlled 3D Assets on the Web|date=2013-06-17|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1BTzVgxI5I&amp;feature=youtu.be|accessdate=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[SIGGRAPH#SIGGRAPH Asia|SIGGRAPH Asia]] 2012 in [[Singapore]] also introduced a native Android application and the very first 3D differencing tool ''Interactive 3D Diff''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.3ders.org/articles/20121105-3d-repo-open-source-revision-control-framework-for-large-3d-models.html|title=3D Repo: open source Revision Control Framework for large 3D models|work=3ders.org|access-date=2017-11-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doboš|first=Jozef|last2=Simondetti|first2=Alvise|last3=Steed|first3=Anthony|date=2012|title=Visualizing 3D Models in Aid of Public Consultation|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2407696.2407705|journal=SIGGRAPH Asia 2012 Symposium on Apps|series=SA '12|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=9:1–9:1|doi=10.1145/2407696.2407705|isbn=9781450319164}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doboš|first=Jozef|last2=Steed|first2=Anthony|date=2012|title=3D Diff: An Interactive Approach to Mesh Differencing and Conflict Resolution|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2407746.2407766|journal=SIGGRAPH Asia 2012 Technical Briefs|series=SA '12|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=20:1–20:4|doi=10.1145/2407746.2407766|isbn=9781450319157}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent collaboration with Prof Niloy Mitra at [[University College London]] led to the development of a reverse engineering system ''3D Timeline'' presented at [[Eurographics]] 2014 in [[Strasbourg]], [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doboš|first=Jozef|last2=Mitra|first2=Niloy J.|last3=Steed|first3=Anthony|date=2014-05-01|title=3D Timeline: Reverse engineering of a part-based provenance from consecutive 3D models|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cgf.12311/abstract|journal=Computer Graphics Forum|language=en|volume=33|issue=2|pages=135–144|doi=10.1111/cgf.12311|issn=1467-8659}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Interactive 3D Diff which required prior correspondence information, i.e. matching object-level identifiers between revisions, 3D Timeline reverse engineered the relationships and changes between 3D components over multiple revisions without prior correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=3drepoorg|title=3D Timeline: Reverse Engineering of a Part-based Provenance from Consecutive 3D Models (EG 2014)|date=2014-01-23|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTmnm1sLf14&amp;feature=youtu.be|accessdate=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Commercial development ===
Based on the potential commercial impact of 3D Repo, the project was awarded VEIV Advance Scholarship&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://veiv.cs.ucl.ac.uk/materials-for-students-and-supervisors/forms-guides/201-veiv-advance-scholarship|title=UCL Centre VEIV Advance Scholarship|last=Steed|first=Anthony|website=veiv.cs.ucl.ac.uk|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to devise a business plan.

Specter, the Pipo Monkeys' leader, finds a Monkey Helmet, and hires the human scientist {{Nihongo|Dr. Tomoki|Dr. トモウキ|Dokutā Tomouki}} to aid him in his evil plans. They establish television stations protected by the Freaky Monkey Five where they plan to broadcast TV shows worldwide. The [[television]] shows that are broadcast on every television put every human except the twins, Kei and Yumi (Satoru and Sayaka outside of North America), their aunt Aki, and Natalie (Natsumi outside of North America) into a mindless trance. When Natsumi informs Kei and Yumi that Spike (Kakeru), Jimmy (Hikaru) and the Professor were all infected by the television show, Kei and Yumi go out to catch the monkeys and thwart Specter and Tomoki.

Their mission was to go to every movie set and capture all the monkeys there and destroy the satellite there. Kei and Yumi easily capture Monkey White, Monkey Blue, and Monkey Yellow. When they reach the TV Station where Monkey Pink is, Kei and Yumi's attempts to capture her fail and she escapes. They manage to capture Monkey Red afterwards.

When they reach Tomoki City, Tomoki challenges them to a battle in his giant Tomo-King robot. Tomoki, after being defeated by Kei and Yumi, and being humiliated by Specter, lets them take his rocket to space to defeat his former partner. Once they reach Specter's outer space base of operations: Space Station SARU-3, they capture all the monkeys and deactivate the movie sets on their way to Specter. When they reach Specter, he tells them his plan about how he will use his space station to cut the earth in half and keep half of it for the monkeys (leaving the other half, originally meant for Tomoki, to the humans). Afterwards he gets in his new Gorillac Mech and tries to activate his plan. He is defeated and the two escape from the satellite, leaving Tomoki to give his life to deactivate the Twin Heavens. He survives. After Specter is defeated, Monkey Pink releases him and the rest of the Freaky Monkey Five, leaving them to be caught again in extremely similar missions. To complete the game one hundred percent, all the four hundred and forty-two monkeys have to be caught, all the time trials have to be completed with a gold time, and all the items, CDs, Video Tapes (except 28), Car Skins, Genie Dance tracks, books, etc. have to be bought. The game holds a total of four hundred and thirty-four monkeys if the secret code monkeys are not caught.

==Gameplay==
{{See also|Ape Escape#Gameplay|l1=Gameplay of the Ape Escape series}}
Playing as either Satoru or Sayaka, gameplay follows that of [[Ape Escape#Gameplay|the previous games]] in which the player must catch several monkeys by using various gadgets controlled with right analogue stick. While there are fewer gadgets in this game than previous entries, a new feature in this game is the ability to morph into different forms through a device built by Aki.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Ape Escape 3 :: PS2 Game Review | work = | publisher = Kidzworld | url = http://www.kidzworld.com/article/6386-ape-escape-3-playstation-2-video-game-review | accessdate = 2009-04-01| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090416144719/http://www.kidzworld.com/article/6386-ape-escape-3-playstation-2-video-game-review| archivedate= 16 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some monkeys may also try to steal the player's Stun Club or Time Net and use it against them, and can even force them out of the level by catching them with their own net. Playing as Sayaka has an additional benefit; owing to her pop idol status, certain monkeys will go star-struck upon sight of Sayaka, allowing for an easy capture.

===''Mesal Gear Solid''===
A minigame featured in the game is ''{{ill|Mesal Gear Solid: Snake Escape|jp|メサルギアソリッド}}'', a spoof of ''[[Metal Gear|Metal Gear Solid]]'' (the name is a pun on {{Nihongo|"metal"|メタル|metaru}} and {{Nihongo|"monkey"|猿|saru}}.) In this game, players control Pipo Snake, a monkey loaded with [[Solid Snake]]'s battle data, sent on a mission to rescue Snake and destroy a monkey-like Metal Gear. Gameplay is similar to ''Metal Gear Solid'' in which players have to use stealth and weapons to sneak around undetected and rescue prisoners. Players are equipped with a Banana Pistol for stunning enemies and Pineapple Grenades for breaking open flimsy walls. Similarly, the original PlayStation 2 editions of ''[[Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater]]'' include a ''Snake vs. Monkey'' mode in which Snake has to capture monkeys.

[[Image:Mahmoud Ahmadinejad at Columbia 6 by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Two men argue at a political protest in [[New York City]].]]
Whereas formal arguments are static, such as one might find in a textbook or research article, '''argumentative dialogue''' is dynamic. It serves as a published record of justification for an [[logical assertion|assertion]].  Arguments can also be interactive, in which the proposer and the interlocutor have a more symmetrical relationship.  The [[premise]]s are discussed, as well the validity of the intermediate [[inference]]s.  For example, consider the following exchange, illustrated by the [[No true Scotsman]] fallacy:

: Argument: "No Scotsman puts sugar on his porridge."
: Reply: "But my friend Angus likes sugar with his porridge." 
: Rebuttal: "Ah yes, but no true Scotsman puts sugar on his porridge." 

In this dialogue, the proposer first offers a premise, the premise is challenged by the interlocutor, and finally the proposer offers a modification of the premise. This exchange could be part of a larger discussion, for example a murder trial, in which the defendant is a Scotsman, and it had been established earlier that the murderer was eating sugared porridge when he or she committed the murder. 

In argumentative dialogue, the rules of interaction may be negotiated by the parties to the dialogue, although in many cases the rules are already determined by social [[mores]].  In the most symmetrical case, argumentative dialogue can be regarded as a process of discovery more than one of justification of a conclusion.  Ideally, the goal of argumentative dialogue is for participants to arrive jointly at a conclusion by mutually accepted inferences.  In some cases however, the validity of the conclusion is secondary. For example; emotional outlet, scoring points with an audience, wearing down an opponent or lowering the sale price of an item may instead be the actual goals of the dialogue. Walton distinguishes several types of argumentative dialogue which illustrate these various goals:
* Personal quarrel
* Forensic debate
* Persuasion dialogue
* Bargaining dialogue
* Action seeking dialogue
* Educational dialogue

Van Eemeren and Grootendorst identify various stages of argumentative dialogue. These stages can be regarded as an argument protocol. In a somewhat loose interpretation, the stages are as follows:

* Confrontation: Presentation of the problem, such as a debate question or a political disagreement
* Opening: Agreement on rules, such as for example, how evidence is to be presented, which sources of facts are to be used, how to handle divergent interpretations, determination of closing conditions.
* [[Argumentation]]: Application of logical principles according to the agreed-upon rules
* Closing: This occurs when the termination conditions are met. Among these could be for example, a time limitation or the determination of an arbiter.

Van Eemeren and Grootendorst provide a detailed list of rules that must be applied at each stage of the protocol.  Moreover, in the account of argumentation given by these authors, there are specified roles of protagonist and antagonist in the protocol which are determined by the conditions which set up the need for argument.

Many cases of argument are highly unsymmetrical, although in some sense they are dialogues. A particularly important case of this is [[political argument]].

Much of the recent work on argument theory has considered argumentation as an integral part of language and perhaps the most important function of language ([[Paul Grice|Grice]], [[John Searle|Searle]], [[J. L. Austin|Austin]], [[Karl Popper|Popper]]). This tendency has moved [[argumentation theory]] away from the realm of pure formal logic.

One of the original contributors to this trend is the philosopher [[Chaim Perelman]], who together with [[Lucie Olbrechts-Tyteca]] introduced the French term ''La nouvelle rhetorique'' in 1958 to describe an approach to argument which is not reduced to application of formal rules of inference.  Perelman's view of argumentation is much closer to a [[juridical]] one, in which rules for presenting evidence and rebuttals play an important role.  Though this would apparently invalidate [[semantic]] concepts of truth, this approach seems useful in situations in which the possibility of reasoning within some commonly accepted model does not exist or this possibility has broken down because of ideological conflict.  Retaining the notion enunciated in the introduction to this article that ''logic'' usually refers to the structure of argument, we can regard the logic of rhetoric as a set of protocols for argumentation.

[[File:Auton Trilogy.jpg|thumb|right|VHS covers of the original UK releases]]

The '''''Auton'' trilogy''' is a series of [[direct-to-video]] [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] productions based on the long running [[BBC]] [[science fiction]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]''. The three films in the series are ''Auton'' (1997), ''Auton 2: Sentinel'' (1998; working title, ''Auton 2: The Rapture'') and ''Auton 3'' (1999; working title, ''Auton 3: Awakening''). They were produced by the independent [[BBV]] company and are sequels to the [[Third Doctor]] stories ''[[Spearhead from Space]]'' and ''[[Terror of the Autons]]''. All three films have been reissued on DVD.

All story elements relating to ''Doctor Who'' were licensed from their respective authors.

==Synopses==
When a [[Nestene]] energy unit and several Autons are reactivated at a [[UNIT]] facility, a plot for world domination that predates mankind is set in motion.

At a top secret [[UNIT]] facility known only as "the Warehouse", Dr Sally Arnold has been studying a [[Nestene]] energy unit with no results. As a last resort, she subjects the artifact to cosmic signals from UNIT's most powerful deep space scanning satellite. This causes a violent energy release that kills her assistant, Janice. The energy unit has disappeared.

A containment team, led by a [[psychic]] UNIT operative named Lockwood, has been dispatched. Among Lockwood's abilities is the ability to access all information from any computer mainframe in the world with his mind.

They soon learn that the Nestene energy unity has taken on a mobile form, and that there is an [[Auton]] copy of senior archivist Graham Winslet. The real Winslet is still alive, his mind being used by the Autons as a resource of information. The energy unit then merges with the Auton Winslet.

Several dormant Autons in the Warehouse come back to life and the building becomes a battlefield. They are eventually defeated with the weapon created by the [[Third Doctor|Doctor]] and [[Liz Shaw (Doctor Who)|Liz Shaw]] in ''Spearhead from Space''. The Auton Winslet then liquefies and escapes through a ventilation shaft.

===''Auton 2: Sentinel''===
{{Infobox film

}}

Two years after the Warehouse incident, a lorry transporting [[Auton]]s from the Warehouse to another [[UNIT]] facility is hijacked by its own cargo. Meanwhile, Lockwood is troubled by extremely active dreams. UNIT learns that the transfer of the Autons was authorized by Lockwood. When he later remembers signing the transportation docket, it becomes evident that the [[Nestene Consciousness]] is using Lockwood's psychic abilities to their own ends. 

UNIT's Internal Security Division launches an investigation on Lockwood, pairing him with another [[psychic]] operative named Natasha Alexander. While Lockwood's abilities are owed to an alien implant, Natasha claims to have been psychic since birth.

The escaped Autons are traced to Sentinel Island. There the Auton Winslet has installed himself as the local vicar. He has brainwashed most of the island's inhabitants and the Autons have killed those who resisted. They are using the combined mental energy of the church's congregation to awaken a Nestene creature buried beneath.

There are dormant Nestenes lying underground around the world. They were put in place before the development of the human race. Their locations have become known to humanity as holy sites and are connected by [[ley line]]s.

When Lockwood and Natasha arrive at the church, they succeed in reviving the Nestene. The Nestene attempts to awaken the others. Lockwood tries to defeat it, but instead absorbs the creature into his own mind.

===''Auton 3''===
{{Infobox film

}}

Lockwood and Natasha have returned from Sentinel Island, coming on shore in the town of Millhampton. Computers around the world are failing. They are being invaded by the [[Nestene Consciousness]] through Lockwood's implant.

Meanwhile, the entire population of Millhampton has disappeared. They have been absorbed into the mind of another revived Nestene below the city. The only survivor is the real Winslet, who is still being used by the Nestenes at the local psychiatric hospital.

Lockwood and Natasha are both being used by another psychic [[UNIT]] operative named Palmer to lead them to the heart of the Nestene activity. Palmer monitors their movements through a constant link with Natasha's mind.

Meanwhile, Natasha is used by the Nestenes to lure Lockwood to the hospital, which the Autons are using as the centre of their operation. There the Auton Winslet is trying to free the Nestene energy from Lockwood's mind so it can infect every computer in the world and revive all the dormant Nestene creatures. Lockwood resists by convincing himself that everything he sees is a dream.

When Dr Arnold arrives, his resolve is broken. He is then forced to sacrifice his own life to destroy the Nestene plan.

==Trivia and continuity==
*''Auton'' was originally intended to include [[Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart|Brigadier Alistair Lethbridge-Stewart]], but actor [[Nicholas Courtney]] had to decline due to the fact he was ill during production. The character of the Brigadier was replaced by Lockwood, who would also appear in the next two films.
*In ''Auton 2: Sentinel'', it is revealed that Lockwood is actually the codename of the otherwise unnamed UNIT Operative 8954B.
*The call sign Greyhound Leader, used in ''[[Doctor Who]]'' successively by Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart, [[List_of_UNIT_personnel#Brigadier_Winifred_Bambera|Brigadier Bambera]],&lt;ref&gt;Brigadier Winifred Bambera is Greyhound Leader in ''[[Battlefield (Doctor Who)|Battlefield]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[List_of_UNIT_personnel#Kate_Stewart|Kate Stewart]],&lt;ref&gt;Kate Stewart is addressed as Greyhound Leader by the helicopter crew transporting the TARDIS in "[[Day of the Doctor]]".&lt;/ref&gt; is used by three different characters in the trilogy: Lockwood (''Auton''), Colonel Wilson (''Auton 2: Sentinel'') and Ross Palmer (''Auton 3: Awakening'').
*A spoof of these dramas, titled "The Auton Diaries", is included on the VHS and DVD releases of ''Auton 3: Awakening''. The plot involves an out of work Auton finding new employment at BBV.
*BBV's ''Do You Have a Licence to Save this Planet'' includes an ''Auton 3''-style Auton.
*[[Nicholas Briggs]], who directed the first two films and wrote all three, would go on to play the voices of the [[Daleks]] and [[Cybermen]] in the  2005 revival, as well as original Dalek voice actor, [[Peter Hawkins]], in ''[[An Adventure in Space and Time]]'' and government official, Rick Yates, in ''[[Torchwood: Children of Earth]]''.
*In a chase scene about 13 minutes into ''Auton 3: Awakening'', the Autons have shadows longer than their own bodies, the sun being low in the sky.  However, 10 seconds later they are seen with much shorter shadows, revealing that different parts of the chase were filmed at significantly different times of day.
*US retailer Who North America (http://www.whona.com) contributed US$10,000 to the Auton 3 project.
*When admiring the warehoused Auton-killing device near the end of the first film, Lockwood compliments its absent designer: "Not a bad bit of workmanship, Doctor John Smith." The [[Third Doctor]] built the device in his première serial, ''[[Spearhead from Space]]'', at the end of which he asked his new employer, [[Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart]], to use the name John Smith on his UNIT credentials.

==Critical reception==
In 2012, Rae was featured in the esteemed ''Forbes'' 30 Under 30 Entertainment List for her work with ''Awkward Black Girl''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=30 Under 30 Entertainment: Issa Rae|url=https://www.forbes.com/pictures/mfl45edfge/issa-rae/|publisher=''Forbes''|accessdate=December 13, 2013|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The show also won the Shorty Award for Best Web Show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Me|url=http://www.issarae.com/about-me/|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics have praised ''Awkward Black Girl'' for its witty humor and unique, realistic portrayal of African-American women. ''New York Times'' critic Jon Caramica describes the show as “full of sharp, pointillist humor that’s extremely refreshing.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Caramanica|first=Jon|title=Life's Hard, Web Series Gracefully Illustrates|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/14/arts/television/issa-rae-and-awkward-black-girl-are-breaking-ground.html|publisher=''NY Times''|accessdate=December 13, 2013|date=July 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On her site beyondblackwhite.com, Christelyn Karazin blogs, “Aren't you tired of seeing black women look like idiots on television? Here's a girl—whom I suspect is a lot like the women who read this blog—quirky, funny, a little unsure of herself, rocks her hair natural and is beautifully brown skinned.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Karazin|first=Christelyn|title=Friday Funny: "Awkward Black Girl" Needs Us or We’ll Never Know If J Will Hook Up with Jay!|url=http://www.beyondblackwhite.com/friday-funny-awkward-black-girl-needs-us-or-well-never-know-if-j-will-hook-up-with-jay/|publisher=beyondblackandwhite.com|accessdate=December 13, 2013|date=August 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Erin Stegeman of ''The Tangled Web'' praises ''Awkward Black Girl'' for defying stereotypes of African American women and being “an uber-relatable slice of life, narrated by J’s inner-ramblings that run through any awkward person’s mind.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stegeman|first=Erin|title=Awkward Black Girl|url=http://tangledwebwewatch.com/2013/07/21/the-tangled-web-team-reviews-the-mis-adventures-of-awkward-black-girl/#eastsiders|publisher=''The Tangled Web''|accessdate=December 13, 2013|date=July 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In its honest portrayal of the African-American experience and its depiction of the main character, J, as a "cultural mulatto," ''Awkward Black Girl'' belongs to the "New Black Aesthetic," a term coined by African-American novelist [[Trey Ellis]] to describe an artistic movement that aims to create fuller meanings of black identity by exploring intra-racial diversity, reexamining stereotypes, and presenting blackness authentically.

'''''Backstreet Project''''' is an [[American comic book]] created by [[Nick Carter (musician)|Nick Carter]] and [[Stan Lee]]. The comic features members of Carter's band the [[Backstreet Boys]] as themselves as well as a team of superheroes called "Cyber Crusaders". The book was available for purchase at their concerts and online stores in 2000–2001.

==Publication history==
Nick Carter, who was a comic fan, made an original concept of the comic planned as a six-issue series. In February 2000, he met Stan Lee through his manager from [[The Firm, Inc.|The Firm]]. Carter told him about his concept, and Lee was interested. However, they ultimately decided to make it into only one issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Backstreet Project|year=2000|publisher=Stan Lee Media|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
It begins when the Backstreet Boys are in the midst of one of their concerts. As they are performing on stage, a spaceship crashes near the stadium. The members rush into the woods to the crash site and there they find an alien who was on the ship. The alien gives each of them an enchanted amulet embedded with mystic crystals and they learn that she is on a mission of protecting Earth from an alien invasion that would happen soon. When they wear the amulets their DNA gets twisted by a virtual genetic cyclone that gives each of them astonishing super powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.backstreetproject.com/story.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000817093928/http://www.backstreetproject.com/story.htm|archivedate=2000-08-17|title=Backstreet Project: Story Preview!|accessdate=2012-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The superhero form of the Backstreet Boys are called '''Cyber Crusaders'''.

[[File:Ballpits530.jpg|thumb|right|A child playing in a ball pit]] 
A '''ball pit''' (originally called "'''ball crawl'''" and also known as a '''ball pool''' or '''ball pond''') is a padded box or pool filled with small colorful hollow plastic balls generally no larger than {{convert|3|in|cm}} in diameter. Instead of balls, other spherical objects can be used, such as balloons. It is typically employed as a recreation and exercise for children.

[[File:Bollhav.jpg|thumb|A ball pit as part of a larger play area]]
Ball pits are often found at nurseries, [[carnival]]s, [[amusement park]]s, [[Family fun center|fun center]]s, [[fast-food restaurants]], and large [[video arcade]]s.  [[Chuck E. Cheese's]] and (now defunct) [[Discovery Zone]] formerly had ball pits and they were frequently incorporated into larger play structures, such as [[maze]]s, [[Playground slide|slide]]s, and [[jungle gym]]s.

Ball pits may be rented for [[party|parties]], and smaller versions are sold for use in the home. While ball pits are traditionally intended for children, some are large enough to accommodate [[adult]]s.

Ball pits may be used together with a [[trampoline]], or combining the two by filling a closed trampoline with the balls.

==Urban legends==
Beginning in the late 1990s, a number of [[urban legend]]s arose about children being severely injured or even killed due to ball-pit encounters with venomous [[snake]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://urbanlegends.about.com/library/blsnakes.htm|title=Snakes in the Ball Pit - Urban Legends|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[hypodermic needle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://urbanlegends.about.com/library/blneedle.htm|title=Needles Hidden Under Gas Pump Handles Are an Urban Legend|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is no truth to these stories,&lt;ref name="webmd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/parenting/news/20010831/bounce-carefully-in-ball-pit#1|title=Bounce Carefully in the Ball Pit|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; workers have reported finding dirty diapers, half-eaten food and syringes in ball pits.&lt;ref name="webmd"/&gt;

==In popular culture==
In the ''[[Rugrats]]'' episode, "Piggy's Pizza Palace", the Rugrats jump on a costumed pig named Piggy as an act of revenge to get Angelica's tickets back. Thus, it caused the ball pit structure to split right open and all of the balls fall out all over the restaurant. 

In season 3 episode 14, ("The Einstein Approximation") of the TV series ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'', Sheldon seeks inspiration in a ball pit at a [[shopping mall|mall]], and then hides from Leonard, who becomes frustrated as he spends a good amount of time and effort trying to retrieve Sheldon from the ball pit, but Sheldon keeps saying "Bazinga".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=VanDerWerff|first1=Todd|title=The Big Bang Theory: “The Einstein Approximation”|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/the-big-bang-theory-the-einstein-approximation-37774|accessdate=August 25, 2016|date=February 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Potts|first1=Kimberly|title=Every Inside Joke on The Big Bang Theory, Alphabetized|url=http://www.vulture.com/2015/10/big-bang-theory-inside-jokes-alphabetized.html|accessdate=August 25, 2016|date=October 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, a [[YouTube]] vlogger under the name ''[[Roman Atwood]]'' made a video of transforming the living room of his home into a massive ball pit, intended as a prank for his girlfriend who has returned from a trip. He later collaborates with another vlogger,  [[Freddie Wong]], to create a comedy video involving giant ball pit and "ball monster" prank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Waxman|first1=Olivia B.|title=Watch a Guy Surprise His Girlfriend by Turning Their House into a Giant Ball Pit|url=http://time.com/3674421/house-ball-pit-prank/|accessdate=August 25, 2016|work=TIME.com|date=January 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, a pop-up "ball pit bar" opened in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/03/san-francisco-ball-pit-bar-is-latest-in-line-of-th.html|title=San Francisco "Ball Pit Bar" Is the Latest Crazy Themed Bar|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bamboo Harvester''' (1949–1970) was the name of the [[American Saddlebred]]/[[part-Arabian]] horse that portrayed [[Mister Ed]] on the 1961–1966 comedy series of the same name. Foaled in 1949, the [[gelding]] was trained by [[Will Rogers]]' protégé, Les Hilton. He was born in the [[Los Angeles]] area but sources disagree as to whether his birthplace was in [[El Monte, California|El Monte]]&lt;ref name="BeckClark2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ken Beck|author2=Jim Clark|title=The Encyclopedia of TV Pets: A Complete History of Television's Greatest Animal Stars|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VKS1-aBvXawC&amp;pg=PT267|year=2002|publisher=Thomas Nelson Inc|isbn=978-1-4185-5737-9|page=267ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; or at Harvester Farms in [[Chatsworth, Los Angeles|Chatsworth, California]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chatsworthhistory.com/Documents/PastPresent/Harvester%20Farms%20-%20CHS.pdf "Harvester Farms"] in ''Chatsworth Past &amp; Present'', February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1997-02-02/entertainment/9701300966_1_harvester-poultry-farm-stud-farm "Mr. Ed's Home May Become A Landmark"], ''[[Los Angeles Daily News]]'' as reprinted in ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'', February 2, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, two years after the cancellation of ''Mister Ed'', at the age of 19, Bamboo began to suffer from a variety of age related ailments, including [[kidney]] problems and [[arthritis]]. He was [[animal euthanasia|euthanized]] in 1970.

A second palomino horse, which had posed for still pictures used in [[press kit]]s for the show, survived until 1979. After Bamboo Harvester's death in 1970, the second horse was unofficially known as ''Mister Ed''.

== Death ==

By 1968, Bamboo Harvester was suffering from a variety of health problems. Controversy surrounds the story of his demise, and there are at least two separate versions of what happened, both from plausible sources which might reasonably be expected to have the correct story.  In one version, he was euthanized in 1970 with no publicity, and buried at Snodgrass Farm in [[Oklahoma]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
| url = https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/1551

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, a different version was given by [[Alan Young]]. Young wrote that he had frequently visited his former co-star in retirement. He states that Mr. Ed died from an inadvertent tranquilizer administered while he was "in retirement" in a stable in [[Burbank, California]], where he lived with his trainer, Lester Hilton. Young says Hilton was out of town visiting relatives and a temporary caregiver might have seen Ed rolling on the ground, struggling to get up. Young said Ed was a heavy horse and he was not always strong enough to get back on his feet without struggling. The theory is that the caregiver thought the horse was in distress and administered a tranquilizer and for unknown reasons the horse died within hours. The remains were cremated and scattered by Hilton in the Los Angeles area at a spot known only to him.&lt;ref name="Young1"&gt;Young, Alan. ''Mr. Ed and Me'' 1994, St. Martins Press, New York, {{ISBN|0-312-11852-X}}, pp. 181-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this version it was a different horse that died in Oklahoma in February 1979 which widely thought to be Bamboo Harvester, but instead this horse was mere one that posed for the still pictures of "Mr. Ed" used by the production company for the show's press kits. After Bamboo Harvester's death in 1970, this horse was unofficially known as Mister Ed, which led to him being reported as such (including sardonic comments on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'s'' [[Weekend Update]]) following his own death.&lt;ref name="OnlyInOK"&gt;
{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young said when the Oklahoma horse death story came out in 1979, he knew it was not the real Mr. Ed, but did not have the heart to "shatter their illusions" that the horse being memorialized was not the real Mr. Ed. He believes it was a horse used for early publicity photos.&lt;ref name="Young1"/&gt;

The real Bamboo Harvester was laid to rest in 1970, on the farm at Snodgrass Farm in [[Tahlequah, Oklahoma]], with no marker. It wasn't until summer 1990, 'Mr. Ed' fans of Oklahoma dedicated a standing granite gravestone to honor the grounds of his grave, though the epitaph uses his stage name and image as 'Mr. Ed', and does not mention his death date of 1970.

[[Adventure Gamers]], in a review for all three episodes, praised its story, art style and the well integration of puzzles, but criticized the slow movement speed, and the occasional frustration, giving it 3½ out of 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://adventuregamers.com/articles/view/31568|title=Bear With Me Review|website=Adventure Gamers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italian magazine [[The Games Machine (Italy)|The Games Machine]] gave it 7.9 out of 10, stating "Bear With Me is a nice, old-style point and click adventure, with logical and well designed puzzles, although not too challenging, and a story that blends humour and drama. Not a milestone in the genre, but adventure fans should give it a chance.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thegamesmachine.it/bear-with-me/bear-with-me-recensione-pc/|title=Bear With Me Recensione PC - The Games Machine|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Episode 1===
[[Hardcore Gamer]] was less positive in its review for the first episode of the series, arguing "The first episode of Bear With Me still hints at a greater game to come, nicely setting a proper noir tone with some occasional creepy bits and a gleeful dose of snark throughout.", but "it sadly says a lot that the initial outing feels more like a demo for the game than an actual full-fledged chapter of the story."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hardcoregamer.com/2016/08/08/review-bear-with-me-episode-1/220075/|title=Review: Bear With Me: Episode 1 - Hardcore Gamer|website=www.hardcoregamer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[LeveL]] magazine, on the other hand, gave it 8/10 and praised it as "The first episode of a dark adventure, where childlike elements are mixed with an adult story in a perfect harmony of a noir story".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.level.cz/starsi-cisla/level-267/|title=LEVEL 267 - LEVEL|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mone/&gt;

'''''Chico's Angels''''' is a live comedy production in [[Los Angeles]] which [[parody|parodies]] the 1976–1981 television series ''[[Charlie's Angels]]''. Starring three [[drag queen]]s in the title roles, the show has been performed regularly at the Cavern Club Theatre in [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles|Silver Lake]] since July 25, 2003. It was co-created by Oscar Quintero, who performs as one of the leads, and Kurt Koehler, who also directs the show.

==Overview==
Like ''Charlie's Angels'', the show focuses on three female private detectives who investigate crimes on assignment from their mysterious boss, whom they have never seen in person. In ''Chico's Angels'', the ladies are brassy, gaudily dressed Mexican women who often insult and argue with each other.&lt;ref name="BWW 2014-07"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/los-angeles/article/CHICOS-ANGELS-Opens-Tonight-at-the-Cavern-Club-Theatre-and-Runs-Through-817-20140711 |title=''CHICO'S ANGELS'' Opens Tonight at the Cavern Club Theatre and Runs Through 8/17 ("Love Boat Chicas") |website=BroadwayWorld.com |date=July 11, 2014 |accessdate=February 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Official episodes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicosangels.com/Angelcases.htm |title=''Chico's Angels'': Case Files |website=ChicosAngels.com |accessdate=July 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; BroadwayWorld.com described it as "a Latino drag queen/[[Three Stooges]] version of the 70s series",&lt;ref name="BWW 2014-07"/&gt; and Siran Babayan wrote in ''[[LA Weekly]]'', "It’s like an [[Agatha Christie]] novel, only with drag queens."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.laweekly.com/event/chicos-angels-2-love-boat-chicas-5442828 |title=''Chico's Angels'' 2: Love Boat Chicas |first=Siran |last=Babayan |work=[[LA Weekly]] |date=March 2015 |accessdate=July 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[TMZ]] said, "Imagine if the Angels were a bit more masculine, a whole lot trampier and spoke English as a second language."&lt;ref name="TMZ"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tmz.com/2007/07/25/charlies-angels-run-for-the-border/ |title=Charlie's Angels Run for the Border |publisher=[[TMZ]] |date=July 25, 2007 |accessdate=July 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bill Raden wrote for ''LA Weekly'', "this trio of blowsy, somewhat earthier angels comes with cha-cha heels on their gumshoes, a decidedly bitchy attitude and a virtue that can be summed up in one word—cheap".&lt;ref name="LAW 2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.laweekly.com/calendar/chicos-angels-chicas-in-chains-2167289 |title=''Chico's Angels'': Chicas in Chains |work=LA Weekly |first=Bill |last=Raden |date=October 7, 2010 |accessdate=August 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early history ==
[[File:Izzet Orujova in Sevil.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Movie "Sevil" in 1932.]]
[[File:The game of love.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Movie "Game of love" in 1935.]]
[[File:Fatali khan.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Movie "Fatali khan" in 1947.]]
The film industry in [[Azerbaijan]] dates back to 1898. In fact, Azerbaijan was among the first countries involved in [[cinematography]]. When the [[Lumière brothers]] of France premiered their first motion picture footage in Paris on December 28, 1895, little did they know how rapidly it would ignite a new age of photographic documentation. These brothers invented an apparatus, patented in February 1895, which they called the "[[Cinématographe]]" (from which the word "cinematography" is derived). It is not surprising that this apparatus soon showed up in [[Baku]] – at the turn of the 19th century, this bay town on the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] was producing more than 50 percent of the world's supply of oil. Just like today, the oil industry attracted foreigners eager to invest and to work.&lt;ref name="cinemainazerbaijan"&gt;[http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/53_folder/53_articles/53_100years.html Celebrating 100 Years in Film, not 80] by Aydin Kazimzade. Azerbaijan International, Autumn 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Frenchman by the name of [[Alexandre Michon]] was among the first entrepreneurs who came and settled in Baku. A photographer and cameraman by profession, he is believed to have lived in [[Baku]] for more than 25 years where he set up a photo studio. Mishon became active in forming a scientific photo circle in [[Baku]] and became its secretary. From 1879 to 1905, he documented landscapes, episodes from oil extraction, the refining process, as well as the [[oil gusher]]s and terrifying fires that broke out in the oil fields. In 1898, Mishon began shooting motion pictures that depicted everyday life in Baku. It was his intention to exhibit them in Paris.

[[Alexandre Michon|Michon]]'s footages still exist up to date in the archives of the Union of Cinematographers of [[Azerbaijan]]. [[The Folk Dance of Caucasus]] was later used in a documentary, and the scenes from [[The Oil Gush Fire in Bibiheybat]] were shown in France in 1995, in a film commemorating the 100th anniversary of world cinema.

The Newspaper Announcement about Michon's films:

''"On Sunday, August 2, 1898, A. Michon, will show some motion pictures that he has taken with a Lumière movie camera and which has been improved by the engineer Jules Carpentier. These films of the Caucasus and Central Asia have been prepared for the forthcoming International Paris Exhibition and will be presented only once in Baku at the V. I. Vasilyev-Vyatski Circus Theater.

''"The following films will be shown: Fire resulting from an oil gusher at Bibi-Heybat oil field, [[Farewell Ceremony for His Majesty Emir of Bukhara on "Velikiy Kniaz Alexei" Steamboat]], a folk dance of the Caucasus, and scenes from the comedy, 'So, You Got Caught,' which was performed recently in one of Baku's parks. For more detailed information, see the posters. The event starts at 21:00 (9 p.m.)."''

The event was an enormous success and Michon repeated it on August 5, replacing the final two works with those showing life in Balakhani outside of Baku.

Michon's footage still exists. "Folk Dance of the Caucasus" was later used in a documentary and scenes from "Oil Gush Fire in Bibi-Heybat" were shown in France in 1995, in a film commemorating the 100th anniversary of world cinema. On November 27, 1899 writer, scientist and social activist Hasan Zardabi in the "Kaspi" entitled an article in which he wrote, ''"Now we have in our hands a toy machine-called "kinemato-graphe." This wonderful machine was produced only a short time ago and gives the impression of being just a toy. You can find this machine which is called 'stroboscope' in many optician shops."''

== Early 20th century ==
[[File:Huseyn Arablinski.jpg|thumb|130px|[[Huseyn Arablinski]], famous Azerbaijani actor of the early 20th century.]]
In 1915 the [[Pirone brothers]] of [[Belgium]] set up a film production laboratory in [[Baku]]. They invited film director [[Boris Svetlov]] from [[St. Petersburg]] ([[Russia]]) to work for them and produce ''The Woman'', ''An Hour before His Death'' and ''An Old Story in a New Manner''. It was Svetlov who also directed the film entitled ''[[In the Kingdom of Oil and Millions]]'' which later became so well known.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|title=In the Kingdom of Oil and Millions|id=0212583}}, 1916.&lt;/ref&gt; The famous Azerbaijani actor [[Huseyn Arablinski]] played Lutfali, the main role in this film.&lt;ref name="cinemainazerbaijan"/&gt;

In 1916 The first version of the operetta ''"[[Arshin Mal Alan (operetta)|Arshin Mal Alan]]"'' was directed by Svetlov. During this era of "silent" film the musical selections were performed by in-house musicians. Two of the women's roles in the film were played by men. Gulchohra was played by [[Ahmad Aghdamski]] and Aunt Jahan was played by Y. Narimanov.

In 1919, during the short-lived [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]], a documentary called [[The Celebration of the Anniversary of Azerbaijani Independence]] was filmed on Azerbaijan's independence day, May 28, and premiered in June 1919 at several theatres in [[Baku]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Azerbaijani cinema in 1920-1935: Silent films | work = | publisher = OCAZ.eu| date = | url = http://www.ocaz.eu/cinema-theatre.html| doi = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Soviet period ==
[[File:Maiden Tower Legend film.jpg|thumb|left|130px|First Azerbaijani Soviet film [[The Maiden Tower Legend]] (1924)]]
After the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] power was established in 1920, [[Nariman Narimanov]], Chairman of the [[Revolutionary Committee of Azerbaijan]], signed a decree nationalizing Azerbaijan's cinema. The [[People's Education Commissariat]], which functioned somewhat like a Ministry, created an art department which included a film section headed by [[Hanafi Teregulov]] and [[Muslim Magomayev (composer)|Muslim Magomayev]], a notable composer and opera singer. In 1922 the government of Azerbaijan decided to create the first cinema factory which became the forerunner of today's film studio ''[[Azerbaijanfilm]]''.&lt;ref name="cinemainazerbaijan"/&gt;

In 1923 the [[Azerbaijan Photo Film Institution]] (APFI) was established by a special decree of the Council of People's Commissars. The Institution controlled all the movie houses and distribution bureaus. Thus, a new epoch in the history of Azerbaijani cinema began – a period when Soviet ideology, not individual entrepreneurship, dominated the film industry.

APFI shot its first film ''[[The Maiden Tower Legend]]'' in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|title=Qiz qalasi|id=1407280}}, 1924.&lt;/ref&gt; This film was the first Azerbaijani Soviet and was based on the legend about the [[Maiden Tower (Baku)|Maiden Tower]].

In the 1930s, Russian director [[Boris Barnet]] filmed ''[[By the Bluest of Seas]]'' in Azerbaijan. The film, which is set on one of the country's islands in the Caspian Sea, has received renown from modern film critics.&lt;ref name="Digital Fix"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homecinema.thedigitalfix.com/content/id/75071/by-the-bluest-of-seas.html|author=Anthony Nield|title=By the Bluest of Seas|work=The Digital Fix|date=February 6, 2012|accessdate=August 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosenbaum"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jonathanrosenbaum.net/2004/02/glimspe-of-a-rare-bird/ |author=[[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] |title=Glimpse of a Rare Bird [on Boris Barnet] (upgraded) |work=Jonathanrosenbaum.net |date=February 6, 2004 |accessdate=August 10, 2015 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160815081641/http://www.jonathanrosenbaum.net/2004/02/glimspe-of-a-rare-bird/ |archivedate=August 15, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NFSA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfsa.gov.au/calendar/?type=boris-barnet|title=Boris Barnet|work=[[National Film and Sound Archive]]|accessdate=August 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cine-Vue"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cine-vue.com/2012/11/dvd-review-barnets-outskirts-bluest-of.html|author=Ben Nicholson|title=DVD Review: Barnet's 'Outskirts' &amp; 'Bluest of Seas'|work=Cine-vue.com|accessdate=August 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ozus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepages.sover.net/~ozus/bythebluestofseas.html|author=[[Dennis Schwartz]]|title=BY THE BLUEST OF SEAS (U SAMOGO SINEGO MORYA)|work=[[Ozus' World Movie Reviews]]|date=January 21, 2015|accessdate=August 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Film Comment"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Friel|first1=Patrick|title=Home Movies: By the Bluest of Seas|journal=Film Comment|issue=January/February 2013|url=http://www.filmcomment.com/article/by-the-bluest-of-seas-boris-barnet-dvd-review/|accessdate=August 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|people=Prof. Nicole Brenez|date=November 19, 2008|title=Nicole Brenez on By the Bluest of Seas|medium=video|language=French|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7ghMxw548w|accessdate=August 17, 2015|time=0:30|publisher=''Also Like Life''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The 1940s ==

In 1940 film directors {{ill|Mikhail Mikhailov (director)|lt=Mikhail Mikhailov|az|Mikayıl Mikayılov}} and [[Vladimir Yeremeyev]] shot a documentary titled ''{{ill|Twentieth Spring|az|İyirminci bahar (film, 1940)}}'' on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the Soviet government in Azerbaijan. 
During World War II in 1941 and 1942 short sound movies "The Motherland's Son" and ''{{ill|Bakhtiyar (film)|lt=Bakhtiyar|az|Bəxtiyar (film, 1942)}}'' (film director A.

== The 1950s ==
In the late 1940s and early 1950s Baku film studio`s main style was artistic-documentary and publicist. During this period "Fatali Khan" (1947, film director V.I.Dzigan) and "The Baku Lights" (1950, film directors I.V.Xeyfits, A.G.Zarkhi and R.Tahmasib) were shot.  
In the middle of the 1950s new stage of Azerbaijani films development began. Movie industry development led to the widening of their subjects during those years. Film subjects included mainly labor and life of workers, collective farmers and others. "Under The Broiling Sun" (1957, film director L.Safarov), "Black Stones" (1958, film director A.Quliyev), "The Shades Are A Creeping" (1958, film directors I.Afandiyev and Sh.Sheykhov), "His Large Heart" (1959, film director A.Ibrahimov), "A True Friend" (1959, T.Tagizade), "Could He Be Forgiven" (1960, film director Tahmasib), "Our Street" (1961, film director A.Atakishiyev), "A Large Pier" (1962, film director H.Ismayilov), "A Telephone Girl", "There Is Such An Island As Well" 1962,1963, film director H.Seyidbayli), "Stepmother" (1959, film director H.Ismayilov) are bright examples of Azerbaijani film that shot during these years. 
In 1950 colored full-length documentary "Soviet Azerbaijan" (film directors M.Dadashov, F.Kiselyov) was made on the occasion of 30th anniversary of Soviet government victory in Azerbaijan. This film won Cannes (France) international film festival special prize in 1951.
"In the gulf named after S.M.Kirov", "He Who Searches Will Find" (1955, 1969, film directors S.Mammadov), "Along way of happiness" "Our Azerbaijan" (1957, 1959, film director M.Dadashov). "Baku and its residents" (1957, film director L.Safarov), "Spring of Azerbaijan culture" (1960, film directors Ch.Mammadov, Kh.Babayev), "M.F.Akhundov" (1962, film director N.Badalov) ."Epos about Caspian oil industry worker" (1953), and "Sea conquerors" (1959) were made by world fame film director R.L.Karmen in "Baki kinostudiyasi" (Baku film studio). He was awarded Lenin prize for these works (1960).

"On Distant Shores", devoted to brave guerrilla Mehdi Huseynzade (1958, film director T.Tagizade), is one of the achievements of Azerbaijan, as well as former soviet film. 

== Cinema in the Azerbaijan Republic ==
In 1991, after Azerbaijan gained its independence from the [[Soviet Union]], first [[Baku International Film Festival]] ''East-West'' was held in Baku. In December 2000, the former [[President of Azerbaijan]], [[Heydar Aliyev]], signed a decree proclaiming August 2 professional holiday of filmmakers of Azerbaijan.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.kinoconfederacia.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=46&amp;Itemid=60 Azerbaijan Cinematographers Union] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927094256/http://www.kinoconfederacia.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=46&amp;Itemid=60 |date=2007-09-27 }} Confederation of Cinematographers Unions&lt;/ref&gt;

Now that the [[USSR]] does not exist anymore, Azerbaijani filmmakers are again dealing with issues similar to those faced by cinematographers prior to the establishment of the Soviet Union in 1920. Once again, both choice of content and sponsorship of films are largely left up to the initiative of the filmmaker.

In 1995, the director [[Rustam Ibrahimbeyov]] won an Academy Award for [[Burnt by the Sun]] as Best Foreign Film. This moment is described as one of the proudest event in Azerbaijan cinema history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurochannel.com/en/Azerbaijani-cinema.html Presentation of the Azerbaijan cinema on Eurochannel website]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1082">'''Creep Mouse''' is an informal game played with [[babies]]. In the game, one ([[child]], [[teenager]], or [[adult]]) marching his or her two fingers up from the infant's toes towards the baby's midsection, reciting a rhythmic verse something like “Here, comes, the, creep, mouse, from, the, barn, into, the, house” once the walking fingers reach the midsection, the baby is then tickled and the sounds  “giddy giddy getchya” are made, much to the baby's amusement. This game is often repeated with an increased cadence with each round.

In the [[United Kingdom]], this game is played along to the song [[Round and round the garden]].

'''Daniel Dos Santos''' (born 1978) is an American speculative fiction artist whose work has appeared on book covers by publishers [[Tor Books|Tor]], [[Bantam Books|Bantam]], [[Pyr (publisher)|Pyr]], and many more, as well as a variety of magazine and comic covers and interiors.  He has been nominated for the [[Hugo Award]] seven times.

A love of comics led Dos Santos to an interest in art.  During his final year of high school, he served an internship with [[Steven Stroud]].&lt;ref name="greenwich"&gt;{{cite web | title = Daniel Dos Santos Biography | work = Greenwich Workshop| url = http://www.greenwichworkshop.com/dossantos/| accessdate = 2014-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following graduation, he attended the [[School of Visual Arts]] in New York City, where he began to focus on speculative art.&lt;ref name="tor" /&gt; Dos Santos and Stroud founded a studio in [[Shelton, Connecticut]], after he graduated.&lt;ref name="greenwich" /&gt;

Dos Santos, along with [[Irene Gallo]], has hosted a series of live art demonstrations at the [[Society of Illustrators]] in [[Manhattan]] called "Art Out Loud." The series began as a collaborative painting demo, but changed over time to better reflect the way in which artists actually work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Spotlight on Daniel Dos Santos, Artist | work = Locus Online | publisher = Locus | date = 2010-10-23 | url = http://www.locusmag.com/Perspectives/2010/10/spotlight-on-daniel-dos-santos-artist/ | accessdate = 2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dos Santos has been nominated for the [[Hugo Award for Best Professional Artist]] each year since 2009.  Dos Santos received the Rhodes Family Award for special achievement in illustration in 2000, as well as the [[The Starr Foundation|Starr Foundation Award]] for 2001.&lt;ref name="greenwich" /&gt; He has received the 2007 [[Jack Gaughan Award]] for Best Emerging Artist and won the first [[Chesley Award for Best Cover Illustration – Paperback]] in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bio |work=The Art of Dan Dos Santos |url=http://www.dandossantos.com/bio.htm |accessdate=2014-06-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130626062857/http://www.dandossantos.com/bio.htm |archivedate=2013-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Silent Drill Platoon Rifle Inspection Routine.jpg|right|thumb|The [[U.S. Marine Corps]] [[Silent Drill Platoon]] performs the rifle inspection routine in front of spectators seated in the Reviewing Stands during the Battle Colors Ceremony held at Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego, California.]]

A '''drill team''' can be one of four different entities:{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

# A '''military drill team''' is a marching unit that performs routines based on [[military drill]]. Military drill teams perform either armed or unarmed.
# A '''[[dance squad|dance drill team]]''' creates routines based on precision dance movements rather than military drill. These teams usually do not carry anything, but may use props in field production numbers. They may perform to recorded music, or the live music of an accompanying marching band.
# A team that execute routines carrying either one or multiple '''flags''' or '''pom-poms.''' This team's movements are also based in dance and may also have a heavy influence of gymnastics as well. These teams also may perform to music, either live or recorded.
# A team that is '''mounted''' (horse, motorcycle, etc.) or advances some type of '''mobile object''' (library carts, lawn chairs, or even garbage bins).  May also include teams of dogs and handlers.

==Military drill team==
A military drill team is a marching unit that performs routines based on military drill. These teams often perfect their proficiency and then choose to compete against other programs. These competitions are generally called "drill meets", and are held all across the world. The top American bladed (bayonet-only) independent drill meet was Pro America&lt;ref&gt;[http://iaxd.org/index.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103135051/http://iaxd.org/index.htm |date=January 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the top American independent armed drill meet is the Isis World Drill Championships&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.i-w-d-c.com]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303234503/http://www.i-w-d-c.com/ |date=March 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for post high school professional exhibition drillers in the nation. [[Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] (JROTC) programs may also compete in the National High School Drill Team Championships&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://drill.thenationals.net|title=Drill Main Flash-like HomePage|work=thenationals.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; held in Daytona Beach, Florida. There are two divisions for competing, Unarmed, and Armed. During the summers, most drill teams go to drill camps&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.competitive-outcomes.com|title=Competitive Outcomes - Drill Team Training Camps, JROTC, and Honor Guard Training|work=Competitive Outcomes}}&lt;/ref&gt; to hone their skills. Also see high school "military" drill teams in high school. Washington, Idaho, California.

=== United States ===
[[File:SGuards.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina]]'s elite senior drill platoon, [[The Summerall Guards]], performing their signature combination of Prussian high-step and German close-order drill]]

All of the [[United States]] military service branches have an official drill team part of their respective service [[honor guard]]. The [[military academy|service academies]] have drill teams, as well as many college and university [[ROTC]] (Reserve Officer Training Corps) and high school [[JROTC]] (Junior ROTC) units. Additionally, many community-based organizations such as the Army Cadet Corps, [[Naval Sea Cadets]], [[Young Marines]], and [[Civil Air Patrol]] maintain military drill teams. Formerly, some of these units were called '''Crack Squad'''s.&lt;ref&gt;p. 42 Bell, Walter ''Return to Glory Hole''Trafford Publishing, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
The Canadians have the Canadian Cadet Organization. The organization consists of the  [[Royal Canadian Sea Cadets]], [[Royal Canadian Army Cadets]], and [[Royal Canadian Air Cadets]]. All three branches of the organization have drill competitions throughout the year. Some of these competitions are hosted by the Regional Cadet Support Units.

'''Canadian drill competitions consist of the following''':
* Fall in
* Drill Team dress and deportment
* Drill Team Commander's dress and deportment
* Compulsory drill procedures at the halt
* Compulsory drill procedures on the march
* Drill performance in a precision routine (optional)

=== Norway ===
The Norwegian military consist of only one single company sized drill team, consisting of a band and a drill platoon. The team is one of five infantry companies that are assigned the mission to protect His Majesty the King of Norway and the royal family, as well as guarding the Royal Palace. The 3rd company, HMKG are also used to represent the Norwegian armed forces at state-related matters such as state-visits, ceremonies, national festivities, and were also prominent in the Winter World Cup 2010 as guards. As of 2012, His Majesty the King's Guard is also responsible for the safety and defence of the city of Oslo, in case of a national crisis. A total of six companies make up His Majesty The King's Guard ([[Hans Majestet Kongens Garde]]), and is a part of the Norwegian army.

The band is hand picked through interviews and playing tests prior to the draft date. The band consists of signal horns, a drumline, a pit and the main band. Most of the members year goes to practising and basic military training as the year is a part of their military service. The band is probably the only troop that almost never have "green" duty (as in field duty). Also, the band never stand guard at the castle nor the other guarding posts around Oslo, neither does the drill platoon.

The drill platoon consists of 32–40, first-year servicing soldiers. These are all hand picked through a rigorous selection process that lasts from their drafting at the start of October till December. The soldiers go through basic military training as well as having to learn how to march, weapons drill, and how to perform synchronically. Throughout the selection process, the soldiers have to prove themselves worthy a spot on the drill team, as these soldiers will be representing not only the King's guard, but also the Norwegian military and the Norwegian state both national and internationally. Everything in their daily duty from the bed, room, facilities, closets, uniforms, and physique needs to be at excellent standards 24/7. These men strive for perfection in all that they do and are often seen running around the various woods nearby the base as well as working out at the gym. Every year, these soldiers finish their service with one of the highest average physical results in the army. Their uniforms are spotless and wrinkleless, in addition their boots are so well polished that you can literally reflect yourself in them. As opposed to what one might think, these soldiers draft year have been compared to as even harder than what the first-year service in the special forces is. Though most likely not as hard physically, the mentality and the pressure in being the best of the best puts these soldiers under a tremendous amount of pressure every hour of every day, every day of the year. Their rigorous training results in being one of the best drill teams in the world.

The band and drill platoon (3rd company) is the only drill team that have been invited to the legendary [[Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo]] nine times, 2012 being the most recent.

===The drill meet===
A drill meet is a competition for military-style drill teams. The [[Military of the United States|US military's]] [[honor guard]] units have drill teams; however, they do not compete against each other in a drill meet such as this. The only exception to this is Pro America&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.IAXD.org]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091020103345/http://www.iaxd.org/ |date=October 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where individuals compete, but not the full drill teams. US high school [[JROTC]] and college [[ROTC]] teams often compete against each other.

====Phases====
Each meet has different phases:

Many drill meets differ regarding what events are offered and what divisions of competition are presented. Drill meets generally include both an armed and unarmed divisions. Events offered generally include several different phases: inspection, color guard regulation drill, and, in addition, (drill based on a service's drill manual) an [[exhibition drill]] in which they march intricate maneuvers along with manipulating equipment including [[rifle]]s, sometimes with fixed [[bayonet]]s.

[[File:Norvegians musicians.jpg|thumb|Musicians of His Majesty the King Guard band and drill team (Norway)]]

*'''Inspection (I) ''': Each team goes through a standard military inspection for an up-close critique of their bearing, knowledge and overall appearance.
*'''[[Regulation drill]] (RD) ''': A fixed list of verbal commands, armed or unarmed from a service's drill and ceremonies manual (see also [[Military parade]]), given by a single cadet commander. This cadet commander must memorize these commands at most every meet and the team must perform these movements as per regulations.
*'''[[Exhibition drill]] (XD) ''': XD is based in RD, but is then infused with a Driller's imagination. XD has different categories:
** '''Solo/one-man''' (A single driller)
** '''Tandem/two-man''' (2 drillers)
** '''Small team''' (4–8 drillers) (Note: this category replaces '''tetrad''' and '''squad''')
** '''Platoon/flight''' (9–26 Drillers)
*'''[[Color guard]] regulation drill''' (CGR): The military color guard is not to be confused with a marching band's color guard (see [[Color guard (flag spinning)]] for more information), although music-related color guards have their roots in the military version. This is similar to the drill team RD phase in that there is a fixed list of commands from a service's drill and ceremonies manual that the cadet commander must memorize and execute with his/her color guard unit. Units are often required to "case" (commands required to cover the colors for transport/storage), and/or "uncase" (commands required to uncover the colors for competition/display) as a part of the competition.

====Weapons====
Each of the above phases can be marched by an armed (with a military [[sword]], [[saber]], or [[rifle]]) or unarmed team. NOTE: Many drill meets allow the use of a sword in the unarmed division, but never a rifle of any kind. All drill teams can march a [[guidon (United States)|guidon]].
*Standard drill team rifles in the United States are the [[M1 Garand]], [[M14 rifle|M14]], or the [[M1903 Springfield rifle]]. Armed teams usually use a [[Drill purpose rifle|demilitarized version of the rifle]] or a facsimile, which may be light-weight for spinning (such as for marching show band use).
*Unarmed teams concentrate on varied body and arm movements with intricate steps. Armed teams then add manipulation of the equipment, known as "[[manual of arms]]" in regulation drill events.

====Judging====
The current system used almost all military drill competitions includes multiple military judges each looking at the unit as a whole while they are competing at differing angles. These judges then grade every aspect of the performance on their own score sheets. This grading is based strictly on the military drill manuals in use for the meet (i.e., Army TC 3-21.5, Marine Corps Order P-5060.20, Air Force Manual 36-2203, etc.) Using this evaluating technique closely parallels what most of these individuals have done throughout their military careers at various levels throughout their training (most of these evaluators come from military training facilities and/or base honor guards). Judges score teams within ranges from POOR, to AVERAGE, to EXCEPTIONAL. Most meets using this system have a "Judge's Notes" section where judges are either encouraged or required (depending on the meet) to write some candid notes for the team to utilize to interpret the numerical scores delivered on the score sheets.

==Dance and semi-military teams==

===Texas===

Dance drill teams evolved from early pep squads and military-style drum and bugle corps that performed in the stands and/or during halftimes at football games.

[[Gussie Nell Davis]], from [[Farmersville, Texas]], created a pep squad at [[Greenville High School (Texas)|Greenville High School]] in [[Greenville, Texas|Greenville]], Texas in 1929. The team was called the "Flaming Flashes", and they performed at every [[Halftime show|football game halftime]]. During Miss Davis’ ten years at Greenville, the team evolved from just simple marching, stunts, and holding up letters, to twirling batons, performing basic dance steps, and eventually, with some help from the band director at Port Arthur High School in southeast Texas, becoming a precision drum and bugle corps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.danceadts.com/edsupport/newprogram/history_drillteam.htm|title=American Dance/Drill Team®|work=danceadts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kay Teer Crawford]], a high school cheerleader in the Rio Grande Valley during the early 1930s, had an idea of forming a team from the girls who were not selected for cheerleader.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/01/sports/kay-teer-crawford-88-guided-drill-teams-growth.html&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from college, Kay returned to [[Edinburg High School (Texas)|Edinburg High School]] to teach physical education and to direct the Sergeanettes in 1936. They marched on the field with a “military swing” style, and eventually evolved into an acclaimed precision dance group. Crawford is equally noted with Gussie Nell Davis as having started the "drill team" concept, but it was Crawford who later started the national dance competition industry.

In 1939, the president of [[Kilgore College]], Dean B.E. Masters, contacted Gussie Nell Davis about coming to [[Kilgore, Texas|Kilgore]], Texas, to start a group that would “be interesting and keep the folks in their seats at half-time.” They also needed to recruit women to the school since the enrollment was primarily made up of men who were seeking to learn more about the oil business. Dr. Masters was not quite sure what he wanted, but he knew he did not want a traditional drum and bugle corps. He wanted something new, something that did not yet exist, and left the decisions up to Miss Davis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rangerette.com/MessageCenterDetail.aspx?ContentID=10|title=Brief History|work=rangerette.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110164757/http://rangerette.com/MessageCenterDetail.aspx?ContentID=10|archivedate=2013-11-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miss Davis created the “[[Kilgore College Rangerettes|Rangerettes]]" to perform at Kilgore College football game halftimes. The Rangerettes almost immediately became the gold standard for all teams, both high school and college, and almost all Texas drill teams now consist of a line of performers with the officers in front of the team leading them in at every game.

In [[Tyler, Texas|Tyler]], Texas, just 30 miles from Kilgore, the second college drill team to be created in Texas was the [http://www.tjc.edu/belles/ Tyler Junior College Apache Belles] in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tjc.edu/belles/info/8/about_the_belles|title=About the Belles Information - Belles|work=tjc.edu|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224181356/http://www.tjc.edu/belles/info/8/about_the_belles|archivedate=2013-12-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fierce but friendly rivalry between the Apache Belles and the Rangerettes developed quickly, and continues to this day.

Much like Miss Davis, Barbara Tidwell, a former Kilgore College Rangerette, was recruited by Southwest Texas State University (now [[Texas State University]]) in 1960 to create the “Strutters”, the first drill team at a four-year college.

There are over a thousand high school drill teams in the state of Texas today with over 30,000 students participating every year. The traditional uniform for these teams usually consists of a white hat with white boots. The officers of the teams also typically wear an all white uniform, while the line members wear school colors. Teams perform visual routines at football games, both in the stands during the game, and on the field at halftime. During the spring, teams often perform at basketball game halftimes, and compete in many different dance styles at competitions sponsored by dance and drill team companies.

Traditionally, Texas high school drill teams have been all female, but males have auditioned and been selected to teams in recent years.

===California===

The first dance-drill teams in [[California]] were school affiliated. Teams in [[California]] now typically identify as either a pep squad, drill team, dance team, dance-drill team, or dance company. But these affiliations began to widen greatly as parks &amp; recreation programs, independent performing arts programs, and dance studios opened across the state in the late 1980s and developed their own dance-related programs. More traditional drill teams march in parades with school marching bands during the fall/winter, perform field shows (halftime shows) at athletic events, and compete at indoor dance/drill competitions during the late-winter and/or spring seasons.

After moving from [[Texas]] to [[California]] following her collegiate studies, drill team founder Dr. [[Kay Teer Crawford]] eventually started the world's first national precision dance-drill team competition in 1967: [[Miss Dance Drill Team USA]] (aka U.S. Nationals &amp; Pageant, MDDTUSA). In 1981, Crawford also created the world's first international dance competition: Miss Dance Drill Team International. The U.S. National dance competition and world championships are now held annually in Southern [[California]].

But there are now numerous drill team &amp; dance team competition circuits in California (i.e. [[Miss Dance Drill Team USA]], Varsity/USA/UDA, CADTD, etc.). And while most current school-affiliated teams do not compete on the festival level, those that do are consistently adjudicated in the following areas as developed by Dr. [[Kay Teer Crawford]] (Different competition circuits place different point/percentage weight on the importance of each of the following three areas in determining a final score):

*Routine choreography
*Technical execution
*Showmanship

There are also quite a variety of categories in which a team can compete. Examples are as follows:

*Jazz
*Lyrical
*Contemporary
*Military
*Kick
*Hip Hop
*Pom/songleader
*Character
*Novelty
*Prop
*Dance-drill
*Co-ed dance
*Show production

Unlike other states where schools are placed in separate divisions based on their school attendance size (as associated with state-organized athletic organizations), no such affiliation currently exists in California because dance is not considered an athletic sport. As a result, competition divisions are sub-divided into size of the performance group in a given routine, with teams allowed to compete in as many sizes as they wish:

*Small
*Medium
*Intermediate
*Large

All teams are adjudicated on a point system, with total points deciding ordinal rankings in determining winners.

===Washington===

In Washington state, the phrase "drill team" usually refers to high school performance/spirit teams that compete in the "drill" and/or "military" category at local, regional and statewide "dance/drill" competitions. Drill routines (sometimes referred to as "drills") typically entail (indeed some argue ''should'' entail):

*highly regimented procedures for entering and exiting the stage;
*precise symmetry and/or spacing in the team's formations (a.k.a. line straightness);
*precise transitions between formations that do not compromise line straightness;
*perfect or near-perfect synchronization and sharpness in the teams' marching and other bodily movements; and
*interesting music selection.
*(Many drill teams incorporate [[kickline]]s into their routines; many other successful drill routines have been accomplished without them.)

Judging is currently known as ordinal judging and ratings categorized by superior, exceptional, excellent, and good.

The WIAA Dance/Drill competition is the annual championship event for qualified dance and drill teams held annually in the last weekend of March.

&lt;br /&gt;A Washington drill team member, or "driller", is not a dancer, but a dancer can be a driller. Since the foci of drill are presentation and spatial precision, drillers do not necessarily need attributes typically ascribed to dancers, such as a high level of flexibility (although this is a large portion of what many teams exhibit in their routines and part of their score) or an aptitude for expressing emotions with the body. This generally allows for larger team sizes, with most teams having about 20 or more members.

===Utah===
In Utah, most 3A, 4A, 5A, and 6A schools have a drill team. This sport is incredibly competitive in this state, probably due to the high number of dancers. Tryouts are normally held the school year before the performing season during the months of April and May, giving teams the entire summer to work on their technique. During this time, drill teams often attend a dance camp to learn small dances to perform at school events such as sports games and assemblies. Along with these shorter routines, teams also learn longer and more technical competition routines to compete at a few invitational competitions and later a regional competition. The teams that place at the top at region (usually the top 4) go to state to compete against other teams in other regions. 

Performed dance styles include military, kick, character, lyrical, hip hop, pom, jazz, and officer, among others.

Every year at region and state competitions, teams compete in military and dance, and every other year, compete in kick or character.

*Dance - Dance routines feature technique and performance above all. Teams are judged on their precision, flexibility, leaps, turns, kicks, and other skills such as projection, facials, vocals, and visuals. 
*Military - Military is a unique style and surprising at first. Military routines use intricate formations, walking patterns, arm sequences, kicks, and drop splits, and require the team to appear as one person, every move being incredibly precise and sharp. Facials are typically intense or neutral, and the music is usually instrumental. It is typically part of a marching ensemble, or marching band.
*Kick - A kick routine is all about legs. The majority of the routine is kicking, either in a line, partnership, or alone. Scores are based on the number of kicks in the routine, how together they are, how high they are, and how straight and pointed the legs and feet are.
*Character - Character is about becoming a certain person, thing, or idea and performing as such. Technique is still a priority like in other styles, but it must be done as the character. Teams are judged on how well they fit the persona, use any props, their technique, and their performance as a whole in the way of projection and facials.

''''' Electra '''''  (French title: ''Électre'') is a two-act play written in 1937 by French dramatist [[Jean Giraudoux]].  It was the first Giraudoux play to employ the staging of [[Louis Jouvet]]. Based on the classic myth of antiquity, ''Electra'' has a surprisingly tragic force, without losing the spirit and sparkling humor that made Jean Giraudoux one of the most important playwrights of the mid twentieth century.

==Original productions==
''Électre'' was translated into English as ''Electra'' in 1955 by Winifred Smith,&lt;ref&gt;Bentley, Eric, ''The Modern Theatre, Volume 1, 5 Plays, edited by Eric Bentley'', Anchor, January, 1955, ASIN  B00150AB5S&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 1964 by Phyllis La Farge and Peter H. Judd.&lt;ref&gt;Giraudoux, Jean (1964), '' Three Plays, vol 2'', Translated by Phyllis La Farge and Peter H. Judd, Hill and Wang, New York&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Robert (1968), ''Jean Giraudoux; Three Faces of  Destiny'', p. 157, University of Chicago Press, Chicago. {{ISBN|0-226-11248-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Électre'' was first performed on 13 May 1937&lt;ref&gt;Grossvogel, David I. (1958), '' 20th Century French Drama'', p. 341, Columbia University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; in Paris at the [[Théâtre de l'Athénée]] in a production by [[Louis Jouvet]].&lt;ref&gt;Inskip, Donald, (1958), '' Jean Giraudoux, The Making of a Dramatist'', p. 182, Oxford University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
[[Agamemnon]], The King of Argos, had sacrificed his daughter [[Iphigenia]] to the gods.  In revenge, his wife, [[Clytemnestra]], assisted by her lover, Aegisthus, killed him on his return from the [[Trojan War]].  [[Orestes]], the son was banished, but the second daughter Electra was allowed to remain: "She does nothing, says nothing. But she is there". As the play opens, Aegisthus wants to marry her to the palace gardener in order to deflect towards "the house of Théocathoclès anything that might cast an unfortunate light on the [[Atreus|house of Atreus]]."

Electra, with the assistance of her easily dominated brother Orestes, who has returned from banishment, relentlessly seeks the murderer of her father, while feeling an implacable hatred for her mother.  Eventually Electra and Orestes themselves are destroyed by the curse that follows the house of  Atreus.

Giraudoux's play is a rewriting of the myth, taken from an epic passage in [[Homer]]'s [[Odyssey]].  It had previously been rendered in tragedies by [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]], and [[Euripides]] in the 5th century BC.

With many anachronistic changes, including the role of the [[bourgeois]] couple as a burlesque reflection of the tragic couple, Elektra is another example of the timelessness of the tragedy. Written in 1937, it would in effect be a "bourgeois tragedy", according to Jean Giraudoux himself.

== The quest for the truth ==
This is the main theme of the play. Electra comes from the Greek ''Elektra'' which means "light". Electra is there to shed light on the events, to illuminate the truth. Thanks to her presence, many characters will reveal "their" truth, such as Agathe in Act II, 6. In addition, Electra and Aegisthus declare themselves throughout the play.

The character of the beggar (at once god, beggar and director) helps restore the truth. It is he who explains how the story unfolds, who recounts the murder of Agamemnon, and also that of Aegisthus and Clytemnestra.

The last scene shows Electra, in restoring the truth, cursed and dispossessed, decimating the city. The splendor of this truth was too violent. The last line, "It has a beautiful name, Narses, it is called the dawn" ends the play on a delicious note of ambiguity.

== Characters ==

=== Characters ===

* [[Electra]]. As mentioned previously, it is really the central character. Daughter of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra, she hates her mother who killed her father with the help of her lover Aegisthus, who is now Regent to the throne. She awaits the arrival of Orestes in revenge.
* [[Orestes]]. Electra's brother, he was very young exile and returned to his family by appearing as a mere alien.
* [[Clytemnestra]]. Mother of Electra and Orestes, Agamemnon's widow and lover of Aegisthus, queen of Argos.
* [[Aegisthus]]. Regent, he holds the power in the city of Argos. The play begins on the consequences of his ideas: Electra married the gardener, and thus deter the Gods of their views on the line of Atreus.
* The Chairman. Second President of the court, he cares for his peace and opposes Aegisthus.
* Agatha. President's wife, she is young and pretty, and decides to deceive her husband.
* The gardener. Future husband of Electra, he looks after the garden of the palace. He belongs to the same family as the President.
* The [[Erinyes|Eumenides]]. Girls at the beginning of the play, they grow several years in a few hours. They are related to the gods and justice.
* The Beggar. Enigmatic character: ((Citation | Never has there been a beggar as perfect as a beggar, as rumor has it that this must be a God)).
* Narses. Friend of the Beggar.

'''Frank Garcia''' (May 8, 1927 – July 15, 1993) was a [[Illusionist|magician]] and professional [[gambling|gambler]]. He was known as "The Man With The Million Dollar Hands." His specialty was [[gambling]] scams and [[cheating]].

The son of [[Spanish people|Spanish]] [[immigrants]], he decided to become a magician after seeing a performance of [[David (Fu Manchu) Bamberg|David "Fu Manchu" Bamberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.magicnook.com/forum/bioFG.htm |title=Biographies Page F-G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As "The Gambling Investigator" he demonstrated and exposed cheating methods at [[trade shows]] and to [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] organizations throughout the United States and on [[television]] shows. Frank Garcia wrote and lectured about the subject throughout his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cardcheaters.com/garcia-frank.htm |title=Frank Garcia - CardCheater.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garcia made "close-up" work his domain. His repertory of [[card manipulation]]s, sponge-ball magic, cups and balls, and sleight-of-hand was highly regarded by his peers.&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/20/obituaries/frank-garcia-a-master-magician-who-aided-the-police-dies-at-66.html |title=A Master Magician Who Aided the Police | work=The New York Times | first=Wolfgang | last=Saxon | date=July 20, 1993 | accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frank was a frequent guest on TV talk shows including The Dick Cavett Show, and David Suskind, sometimes performing magic and sometimes revealing the scams of crooked gamblers such as three card monte players on the streets of New York.

== Published works ==
Garcia wrote 12 books in his life. The books were written about [[card shark|card cheating]],  gambling, and most especially close-up card magic.  Some of his magic books are considered collectors items.
His most famous books were:
* Encyclopedia of Sponge Ball Magic (1976)
* Million Dollar Card Secrets (1972)
* Super Subtle Card Miracles (1973)
* Exclusive Card Secrets (1980)
* Exclusive Card Miracles (1980)
* The Close Up Card Magic of Frank Garcia, Part I (1982)
* The Close Up Card Magic of Frank Garcia, Part II (1982)
* Marked Cards And Loaded Dice (1962) which was later released as How To Detect Crooked Gambling (1977)
* All In A Nutshell (1974)
* Don't Bet On It ! (1978)
* Magic With Cards (1974)  (co-authored with George Schindler)
* Amedeo's Continental Magic  (co-authored with George Schindler)

==Death==
Frank died at age 66 on July 15, 1993 from a stroke in his apartment right before he was going to move in with his wife for the first time. His wife, Betty Moss, now lives alone with her son.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;

'''Free TV''' ({{lang-ar|فري تي في}}), stylized as '''free{{sup|tv}}''', is a 24-hour pan-Arab musical television channel owned by [[Nasr Mahrous]] and headquartered in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]]. Its main target demographic is teenagers, high school and college students and young adults. It has special partnerships with [[Nasr Mahrous#FreeMusic Art Production|FreeMusic]], [[Universal Music Group]] and [[Sony Music]].&lt;ref name="FB"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/FreeTVMusic/about|title=Free TV – About|website=Facebook|language=Arabic|access-date=December 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the channel's owner, it was planned that Free TV would be launched in the summer of 2014, however, it was introduced to the world in 2015, via [[Nilesat]].&lt;ref name="bldna"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bldnaalyoum.com/10655|title=إنطلاق قناة "فرى تى فى" بعيد الفطر|last=|first=|date=May 25, 2015|work=Bldna Al Youm|language=Arabic|access-date=December 19, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasr Mahrous said also that the name of the channel was chosen in order to be similar with "FreeMusic", the name of the record label he owns.&lt;ref name="bldna" /&gt;

[[File:NasrMahrous2.jpg|thumb|[[Nasr Mahrous]], owner of the channel.]]

Its main objective is to combine different cultures through the language of entertainment, and to be a showcase of modern and classic Arab and international music blended together.

Free TV is rated on the top of the musical television channels in [[North Africa]] and the [[Middle East]], for providing an exclusive, outstanding and quality content of clips and programs, and creating awareness about new talents, songs and albums from all over the [[Arab world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.youm7.com/story/2015/7/21/%D9%86%D8%B5%D8%B1-%D9%85%D8%AD%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B3--%D9%85%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%AC%D8%A2%D8%AA-%D9%84%D9%84%D8%AC%D9%85%D9%87%D9%88%D8%B1-%D9%81%D9%89-%D9%81%D8%B1%D9%89-%D8%AA%D9%89-%D9%81%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%82%D8%A8%D9%84%D8%A9/2273166#.VkC1E_krJdg|title=نصر محروس: مفاجآت للجمهور فى "فرى تى فى" الفترة المقبلة|date=July 21, 2015|work=Youm 7|language=Arabic|access-date=December 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.egypttoday.co.uk/breakingnews/%D9%86%D8%B5%D8%B1-%D9%85%D8%AD%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B3-%D9%8A%D8%B7%D9%84%D9%82-%D9%82%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%87-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D8%B6%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%81%D8%B1%D9%89-%D8%AA%D9%89-%D9%81%D9%89.html|title=نصر محروس يطلق قناته الفضائية "فرى تى فى|date=May 25, 2015|work=Egypt Today|language=Arabic|access-date=December 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''French impressionist cinema''' ('''first avant-garde''' or '''narrative avant-garde''') refers to a group of French films and filmmakers of the 1920s.

Film scholars have had much difficulty in defining this movement or for that matter deciding whether it should be considered a movement at all. [[David Bordwell]] has attempted to define a unified stylistic paradigm and set of tenets. &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Others, namely [[Richard Abel (cultural historian)|Richard Abel]], criticize these attempts and group the films and filmmakers more loosely, based on a common goal of "exploration of the process of representation and signification in narrative film discourse." &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Still others such as [[Dudley Andrew]] would struggle with awarding any credibility at all as "movement." &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

== Filmmakers and films (selection) ==
*[[Abel Gance]] (''[[La Dixième symphonie]]'' 1918, ''[[J'accuse (1919 film)|J’Accuse]]'' 1919, ''[[La Roue]]'' 1922, and, above all, ''[[Napoléon (1927 film)|Napoléon]]'' 1927)
*[[Jean Epstein]] (''[[Coeur fidèle]]'' 1923, ''Six et demi onze'' 1927, ''La Glace a Trois Face'' 1928, and ''[[The Fall of the House of Usher (1928 French film)|
The Fall of the House of Usher]]'' 1928) 
*[[Germaine Dulac]] (''[[The Smiling Madame Beudet]]'' 1922)
*[[Marcel L'Herbier]] (''El Dorado'' 1921)
*[[Louis Delluc]] – (''[[La Femme de nulle part]]'' 1922)
*[[Jean Renoir]] (''[[Nana (1926 film)|Nana]]'' 1926)

== Periodization ==

1. Pictorialism (beginning in 1918): made up of films that focus mainly on manipulation of the film as image, through camerawork, mise-en-scene, and optical devices.

2. Montage (beginning in 1923): at which point rhythmic and fast-paced editing became more widely used.

3. Diffusion (beginning in 1926): at which point films and filmmakers began to pursue other stylistic and formal modes.

== Stylistic paradigm ==

Based on David Bordwell’s family resemblance model: &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;

'''I. Camerawork'''

A.	Camera distance: close-up (as synecdoche, symbol or subjective image)

B.	Camera angle (high or low)

C.	Camera movement (independent of subject, for graphic effects, point of view)

'''II. Mise-en-scene'''

A.	Lighting (single source, shadows indicating off-screen actions, variety of lighting situations)

B.	Décor

C.	Arrangement and movement of figures in space

'''III. Optical devices'''

A.	As transitions

B.	As magical effects

C.	As emphasizing significant details

D.	As pictoral decoration

E.	As conveyors of abstract meanings

F.	As indications of objectivity (mental images, semi-subjective images, optical subjectivity)

'''IV. Characteristic editing patterns'''

A.	Temporal relations between shots (Flashback or fantasy)

B.	Spatial relation between shots (synthetic, glance/object, crosscutting)

C.	Rhythmic relations between shots

== Relation to/deviation from Hollywood stylistics ==

However, even Marcel L’Herbier, one of the chief filmmakers associated with the movement, admitted to an ununified theoretical stance: "None of us – Dulac, Epstein, Delluc or myself – had the same aesthetic outlook. But we had a common interest, which was the investigation of that famous cinematic specificity. On this we agreed completely." &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;

Richard Abel’s re-evaluation of Bordwell’s analysis sees the films as a reaction to conventional stylistic and formal paradigms, rather than Bordwell’s resemblance model. Thus Abel refers to the movement as the Narrative Avant-Garde. He views the films as a reaction to narrative paradigm found in commercial filmmaking, namely that of Hollywood, and is based on literary and generic referentiality, narration through intertitles, syntactical continuity, a rhetoric based on verbal language and literature, and a linear narrative structure &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;, then subverts it, varies it, deviates from it.

== Criticism ==

The movement is also often credited with the origins of film criticism and Louis Delluc is often cited as the first film critic. The movement published journals and periodicals reviewing recent films and discussing trends and ideas about cinema.

Cine-clubs were also formed by filmmakers and enthusiasts, which screened hand picked films: select American fare, German and Swedish films, but most often films made by the members of the clubs themselves.

== Theory ==

The narrative avant-garde did have a theoretical base, although its divergent articulation by different writer-filmmakers has confused the issue to a certain extent. Much of it is an extension of [[Symbolist]] [[poetics]] that posit a realm beyond matter and our immediate sense experience that art and the artist attempt to reveal and express &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;. Bordwell goes on to point out the massive holes in this theorization, that the true nature of reality and experience are never established. Holes aside, the narrative avant-garde explores the perception of reality, and does so through two main concepts: subjectivity and photogénie. Neither of these terms is easily explainable, if at all, but that is part of the point — for these filmmakers explored an unattainable understanding that can only be reached for. French impressionism destabilized familiar or objective ways of seeing, creating new dynamics of human perception. Using strange and imaginative effects, it altered traditional views and aimed to question the norm of the film industry at the time.

;''[[Subjectivity]]''

Through the properties noted above in Bordwell’s stylistic paradigm, filmmakers sought to portray the internal state of the character or characters and in some of the later and more complex films attempt to bring the audience into the equation as subjective participant.

;''Photogénie''

Photogénie occurs at the meeting of the profilmic (what is in front of the camera) and the mechanical and the filmmaker. It is above all a defamiliarization of the spectator with what appears on screen. It is a property that cannot be found in "reality" itself, a camera that is simply switched on does not record it, and a filmmaker cannot simply point it out. As Aitken summarizes, "…fully realized photogénie could only be manifested when its latent power was employed to express the vision of the film-maker, so that the inherent poetry of the cinema could be harnessed, and developed in a revelatory manner by the auteur" &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;. However, the narrative avant-garde lacked a theoretical and philosophical base upon which these notions rest and thus the concept of photogénie is always on the edge of an inexplicable mysticism that many critics cannot accept.

The '''Haus des Rundfunks''' ("Broadcasting House"), located in the [[Westend (Berlin)|Westend]] district of [[Berlin]], the capital city of [[Germany]], is the world's oldest self-contained broadcasting centre. Designed by [[Hans Poelzig]] in 1929 after he won an architectural competition, the building contains three large centrally located broadcasting spaces, which are shielded from street noise by the surrounding office wings. It is used today by local [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] broadcaster [[Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg]] (RBB) to make programmes carried by its ''Inforadio'', ''Kulturradio'', and ''Radio Berlin 88,8'' channels. The building's large broadcasting spaces are occasionally also used to host concerts.

==History==
The building, the ground plan of which is a triangle with two curved sides and a 150-metre-long straight façade clad with ceramic tiles, was constructed between 1929 and 1930 and inaugurated on 22 January 1931 as the seat of the ''[[Reichs-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft]]''. The large, central broadcasting space was finished in 1933. On 22 March 1935 the first regular [[television]] service in Germany ''[[Fernsehsender Paul Nipkow]]'' was begun here, but moved to a separate building on nearby Theodor-Heuss-Platz in 1937. The Haus des Rundfunks also had an important influence on the development of [[stereophonic sound]] and its adoption by radio broadcasting. Some radio programming continued during the war, notably the ''[[Wunschkonzert]] für die Wehrmacht'' ("Request Concert for the Armed Forces"), broadcast from the Haus des Rundfunks on Sunday afternoons from 1939 to 1941.

After [[World War II]], the Haus des Rundfunks became something of a [[Cold War]] issue: although situated in the British Sector of [[West Berlin]], it was used by the [[Berliner Rundfunk]] radio station, which was controlled by the [[Soviet occupation zone|Soviet occupation]] forces, until the station moved to [[East Berlin]] in 1952. The building was not handed over to the West Berlin mayor [[Otto Suhr]] by the Soviet military command until 5 July 1956. After considerable renovation work, it was used from the end of 1957 as the home of [[Sender Freies Berlin]]s, which was to merge on 1 May 2003 merged with [[Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg]].

==The building==
The Haus des Rundfunks was one of the first buildings in Europe dedicated solely to broadcasting and is exceeded in age only by the [[Münchner Funkhaus]]. It is thus especially noteworthy that the building still offers ideal conditions for broadcast production today. At the time, Hans Poelzig had almost no examples to emulate but he developed ideas which are still valid today: the office and editorial rooms are located in the outer areas of the building, thereby surrounding the three large studio complexes. The largest broadcasting space is the heart of the building, and as well as this there is also a smaller broadcasting room and an area which, with its diversity of acoustic characteristics, is used for the production of [[radio drama]].

Poelzig put a great deal of thought into the acoustic properties of the studios. The chairs in the large broadcasting space were specially designed so that seats had the same sound-absorbing qualities whether occupied or not. In the smaller broadcasting room a hundred wall panels could be flipped. One side of the panels absorbed sound, the other reflected it. In this way very different reverberation effects could be achieved.

The company was founded in 1994 as a film production company. It underwent a comprehensive expansion into the media industry through investing and now produces movies, TV shows, &amp; music and operates a film studio, TV production company, a talent agency, a record label, and movie theaters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trmusic.com.cn/intro/about.htm www.trmusic.com.cn/intro/about.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;
In February 2011, Huayi Brothers revealed their plans to create the largest TV and film studio complex in East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://asiapacificarts.usc.edu/article@apa?huayi_brothers_to_build_east_asias_largest_film_and_tv_studio_complex_16432.aspx | title = Huayi Brothers to build East Asia's largest film and TV studio complex | publisher = Asia Pacific Arts | date = 2011-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, they announced that they aim to earn 10 billion yuan in the box office by 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://asiapacificarts.usc.edu/article@apa?huayi_brothers_unveils_their_moneymaking_plan_16522.aspx | title = Huayi Brothers unveils their moneymaking plan | publisher = Asia Pacific Arts | date = 2011-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of April 2015, the company was worth US$7.9 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://variety.com/2015/biz/asia/chinese-media-stocks-stage-major-rally-in-us-and-asian-markets-1201469237/|title= Chinese Media Stocks Stage Major Rally in U.S. and Asian Markets|author= Patrick Frater|date= April 9, 2015|accessdate= April 14, 2015|work=[[variety.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 the company announced that it had agreed to invest as much as $150 million in Studio 8, the production company launched by former [[Warner Bros.]] executive Jeff Robinov, but the partnership never materialized.

'''''Interview''''' is a remake of Dutch film maker [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]]'s 2003 [[Interview (2003 film)|movie of the same name]].  The American version, which premiered in 2007, stars [[Steve Buscemi]] as Pierre Peders (originally played by [[Pierre Bokma]]), a fading political journalist interviewing a [[soap opera]] star, Katya, played by [[Sienna Miller]] (originally played by [[Katja Schuurman]]).  This film also features [[Tara Elders]] as Maggie, Molly Griffith as a waitress, and Philippe Vonlanthen as an autograph seeker.  Steve Buscemi is also a director of this American adaptation. [[Katja Schuurman]], the actress who played Sienna Miller's part in the original movie, has a small cameo as a woman leaving a limo towards the end of the movie.

== Plot ==
Pierre Peders (Buscemi) is a tough political correspondent infuriated by his editor's insistence he cover a tabloid-level story about the [[paparazzi]] favorite Katya (Miller). Pierre's chagrin increases given the news of a searing [[White House]] [[scandal]] that is just breaking; instead of covering the piece, Peders must visit a posh [[Manhattan]] restaurant and interview Katya, whom he instantly detests. The one-on-one is more of a disaster than either could have predicted, but by some strange twist of fate, Pierre is injured and brought back to Katya's [[loft]]. Once there, [[liquor]] is downed, [[cocaine]] is consumed, minor violence erupts, and the two begin to "dance a [[pas de deux]]" &amp;mdash; attempting, not so subtly, to outmaneuver one another psychologically, as dark secrets and long-hidden vulnerabilities emerge.

Katya teases Peders into kissing her, which Peders passionately does, but as her cell phone rings and reality reasserts itself, Katya demands that he stop. Peders is exasperated and complains that she doesn't let him finish what she starts, unlike the male [[prostitute]] he once visited. During another of Katya's phone calls, Peders uses Katya's [[laptop]] and opens a folder containing what he believes is Katya's [[diary]]. He is able to barely conceal his surprise when Katya eyes him suspiciously, by saying he is merely [[Googling]] her, as per an earlier suggestion by her.

When Katya's attention returns to her phone call, Peders e-mails a particularly expressive and emotional diary passage to himself. Later, unable to forget what he had read, Peders betrays his snooping by asking Katya what has made her lose hope. After an emotional outburst about her loss of privacy, she admits that she has [[cancer]]. At this, Peders is immediately contrite about the way he has been treating her. He learns that no one knows about Katya's illness; she feels that saying it aloud will make it more "real".  Peders promises not to reveal the truth about her health; Katya demands that Peders reveal something about himself in return.

As Katya films the confession with a [[camcorder]], Peders admits that, as a reporter, he has made up stories and sources, and that he essentially caused his [[alcoholic]] former wife's death. (He took his time responding to her distress call to him - by the time he arrived, she was already dead.)
Katya swaps out the camcorder tape when Peders is unaware, and a while later, Peders attempts to do the same.  On a clandestine phone call to his editor, Peders - against his promise to Katya - tells him that Katya has cancer.  Peders leaves Katya's loft, and as he is walking outside, she calls him on his cell phone.

Katya reveals that not only did she lie about having cancer, (the diary Peders believed was hers was actually the diary of the character she played) but she has Peders' confessional tape. She inquires whether she should send it to his editor first or the police.  Peders smugly retorts that he swapped the tape first; Katya disagrees and says he only has her rehearsal tape.
The movie ends with Peders and Katya watching their tapes - Peders wearing a sullen expression. Katya sips a glass of [[wine]] while watching Peders' confessional tape, but it is unknown if she will follow through with her threat.

The '''Lieutenant Marvels''' are [[fictional character]]s, a team of [[superhero]]es in the [[Fawcett Comics]] and [[DC Comics]] universes. They first appeared in ''[[Whiz Comics]]'' #21 in 1941.  The physical appearance of the three characters was based on three real-life members of the Fawcett Comics staff: Paul Peck (Tall Billy), Ed Hamilton (Hill Billy), and Frank Taggart (Fat Billy).&lt;ref&gt;C.C. Beck, "The Human Qualities of the Captain Marvel Characters" in Fawcett Companion, ed. P.C. Hamerlinck (Raleigh, NC: TwoMorrows Publishing, 2001), 28-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==
The Lieutenants appeared periodically in the adventures of Captain Marvel and the [[Marvel Family]] through the early 1950s, and also when the characters were revived by [[DC Comics]] in the 1970s under the title ''Shazam!'', although rarely. They were [[retcon]]ned out of existence during the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' in 1985. Some people, such as Jonathan Woodward in his ''Annotated Crisis on Infinite Earths'' website, suggest that the Lieutenant Marvels died in the last battle of the ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'',&lt;ref&gt;Woodwards, Jonathan (2001). "Issue #12, March '86: "Final Crisis". ''The Annotated Crisis on Infinite Earths''. Retrieved from http://www.prismnet.com/~woodward/chroma/crisis12.html on October 27, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; although ''[[Who's Who in the DC Universe]]'' claims they survived but lost their powers.

The characters were reintroduced in ''[[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Trials of Shazam!]]'' #2 (2006), only to lose their powers in the same issue. They also appeared as inhabitants of [[Earth-5]] in [[Grant Morrison]]'s ''[[The Multiversity]]'' miniseries in 2015.

==Fictional team history==
[[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]] has its own Billy Batson, and he travels to the W.H.I.Z. radio station with two other Billy Batsons, one from the [[Western United States]] and one from the [[Southern United States]], to visit [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|the "real" Billy]]. To prevent confusion, the western Billy suggests he be called "Tall" Billy, the southern Billy is renamed "Hill" Billy and Brooklyn's Billy is given the title "Fat" Billy. At the "real" Billy's suggestion, all four Billys form the Billy Batson Club. Billy reveals he is Captain Marvel to them, and says they should only say "Shazam!" when he gives them a wink.

The nefarious [[Dr. Sivana]] hatches a plan to kill the "real" Billy Batson and sends his three henchmen to find out where Billy lives. Sivana's goons mistakenly find the other Billy Batsons instead and capture them. The mysterious Captain Death captures Tall Billy, Nazi Agent Herr Geyer captures Fat Billy, and bandit "Biggy" Brix captures Hill Billy. Sivana uses them as bait to trap the real Billy after hearing he is their friend, having Brix deliver a note, and demanding he comes to the Mill as Billy. When this happens he is knocked out and captured.

Sivana and his henchmen gag Billy and tie him and the other Billys to a log heading towards a buzzsaw, then leave. Billy is able to remove his gag on the buzzsaw, but his shout of "Shazam" can not be heard over the roar of the buzzsaw. With seconds to spare, Billy enlists the aid of his club members and they all shout "Shazam!" together.

When the smoke clears, Captain Marvel sees that the other Billys have transformed as well, into Tall Marvel, Hill Marvel, and Fat Marvel. Hill Marvel remarks that they have each changed into Captain Marvel but Fat Marvel counters that by saying that there is only one Captain Marvel. Tall Marvel suggests that they are really [[Lieutenant]] Marvels, hence the trio's name.

The Captain and his three Lieutenants easily defeat Sivana and his henchmen, knocking their plane down and apparently killing all the villains except Sivana. After shouting "Shazam!" and transforming back into their civilian identities, the three Billys head back home.  The Lieutenants returned from time to time during the Fawcett Comics era to aid their hero. In ''[[Captain Marvel Adventures]]'' #4 they are again kidnapped by Sivana's henchmen. Captain Marvel follows the kidnappers to Sivana's base. The three Billys are tied up under three sharp pendulums. However Billy transforms with them and they defeat the henchmen. They hear a noise in a shed, and find Sivana's daughter Beautia bound and gagged inside. They release her and she reveals Sivana did this. They fly away before Sivana detonates tons of dynamite under the house, then defeat him. They were probably put in suspended animation until 1973, along with many Marvel characters, by the Sivanas. They make their first DC appearance in ''[[Shazam!]]'' #30, when the whole Marvel Family is called upon to destroy Sivana's steel menagarie, which is threatening to wreck [[Pittsburgh]].

The Lieutenant Marvels exist, without powers though still helping the Marvel Family to fight crime, on Earth-5, as seen in ''[[The Multiversity]]'' miniseries by writer [[Grant Morrison]].

==Powers and abilities==
By shouting "Shazam!", the three Billy Batsons are transformed into the Lieutenant Marvels.  In this form, they each have the powers of Captain Marvel: the wisdom of [[Solomon]], the strength of [[Hercules]], the stamina of [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]], the power of [[Zeus]], the courage of [[Achilles]], and the speed of [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]].  Since they have to share the power, they are each only one-third as powerful as Captain Marvel.

==In other media==
In the [[direct-to-video]] [[animated film]] ''[[Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths]]'', three superpowered henchmen with powers similar to the Marvels are employed by [[Superwoman#In other media|Superwoman]], a criminal, [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] incarnation of Wonder Woman,&lt;ref&gt;http://forums.comicbookresources.com/showthread.php?t=308181&amp;page=2&lt;/ref&gt; and referred to as her Lieutenants. However, instead of the "classic" Lieutenant Marvels, the trio appear as criminal counterparts of Captain Marvel, [[Captain Marvel Jr.]], and [[Uncle Marvel]] (listed in the film's credits as, respectively, "Captain Super", "Captain Super Jr.", and "Uncle Super").

In the TV series ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'', [[Mary Marvel|Mary Batson]] and [[Captain Marvel Jr.|Freddy Freeman]] as  Lieutenant Marvel and Sergeant Marvel joined the team during the five year jump but did not appear in the second season leaving the characters' fate unknown.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/youngjustice/backstage/interview12.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Mallory Lewis was born '''Mallory Hurwitz Tarcher''' in [[New York City]]. She is the daughter of [[Jeremy Tarcher (screenwriter)|Jeremy Tarcher]] and [[Shari Lewis]], creator of Lamb Chop.&lt;ref name=Cnn080398&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/TV/9808/03/shari.lewis.obit/|title=CNN - 'Lamb Chop' creator Shari Lewis dead at 64 - August 2, 1998|date=August 3, 1998|work=[[CNN]]|accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Growing up, Lewis used to sleep with Lamb Chop.&lt;ref name=people020276&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20066121,00.html|title=Master Puppeteer Shari Lewis &amp; Publisher Jeremy Tarcher: It's Not a Match Between Dummies|date=February 2, 1976|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Tarcher worked closely with her mother as producer of ''[[Lamb Chop's Play-Along]]''. Jeremy Tarcher had also been part of Shari Lewis's show on [[PBS]].&lt;ref name=Cnn080398/&gt; After her mother's death in 1998,&lt;ref name=latimes092007&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/sep/20/news/wk-kidsa20|title=Like mom, she's in the family business  - Los Angeles Times|author=Lynne Heffley|date=September 20, 2007|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the advice of family friend the late [[Dom DeLuise]], Tarcher decided that Lamb Chop should live on for her many [[fan (aficionado)|fans]] and has begun performing with Lamb Chop. It was during this time that she changed her surname to her mother's, of Lewis as an homage.&lt;ref name=Talkingcomedy/&gt; While Lamb Chop may be described as "sassy",&lt;ref name=latimes092007/&gt; "please" and "thank you" are part of the [[Repertory|repertoire]].&lt;ref name=dailynews/&gt; Lewis has the same hand size as her mother.&lt;ref name=Kentuckynewera&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=266&amp;dat=20010601&amp;id=UBYsAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=iW0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4078,6152254|title=Lamb Chop Is Now In The Capable Hands Of Mallory Lewis|date=June 1, 2001|work=[[Google News]]|publisher=[[Kentucky New Era]]|accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewis said of her decision to take up the puppet: "My mom was one of the world's greatest entertainers. I don't want to challenge that. I don't think it's wise to go there. But I do want to do everything that I can do for Lamb Chop. I'll help keep her going". Lewis had never attempted to imitate Lamb Chop's voice but upon receiving a [[Posthumous recognition|posthumous award]] for Shari, Lewis performed with the puppet, discovering that she had her mother's ability to affect the voice without [[Ventriloquism|lip movement]].&lt;ref name=Talkingcomedy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkingcomedy.com/SI-Vent-2005/tv-siVENT05/SL-TV-siVENT05.html|title=SHARI LEWIS: Shari Had a Little Lamb…And Turned a Simple Sock Into a Superstar|author=J.C.

Lewis is also a writer of children's books, some of which star [[Zoey &amp; Me (book series)|Zoey]], a baby [[orangutan]] character she also puppeteers.

Lewis performs extensively for military support organizations such as the [[United Service Organizations|USO]] and the [[Fisher House Foundation]], performing arts centers, and at state fairs around the country.

[[Image:Gavotte from French suite n. 5.jpg|thumb|250px|This music manuscript was written by Johann Sebastian Bach and contains the ''Gavotte'' from his ''French Suite No. 5'' (BWV 816).]]

'''Music manuscripts''' are [[handwriting|handwritten]] sources of [[music]]. Generally speaking, they can be written on [[paper]] or [[parchment]]. If the manuscript contains the [[composer]]'s handwriting it is called an [[autograph]]. Music manuscripts can contain [[musical notation]] as well as texts and images. There exists a wide variety of types from sketches and fragments, to compositional [[sheet music|scores]] and presentation copies of [[music composition|musical works]].

==Earliest music manuscripts==
The earliest written sources of Western European music can be found in medieval manuscripts of the late 9th century that contain liturgical texts.&lt;ref&gt;Willi Apel, ''The Notation of Polyphonic Music'', 5th ed. (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Medieval Academy of America, 1961).{{page needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Above these texts small symbols ([[neume]]s) indicated the shape of the melodic lines. Only a few manuscripts survive from that time. New systems were devised over the centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Chew and Richard Rastall, " Mensural notation from 1500" (Notation, §III,  History of Western Notation, 4), ''New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', rev. ed., 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparation of manuscripts and copying of music==
In the distant past, each composer was required to draw their own [[staff (music)|staff]] lines (staves) onto blank paper. Eventually, staff paper was manufactured pre-printed with staves as a labor-saving technique. The composer could then compose music directly onto the lines in pencil or ink.

In the 20th century, music staff paper was often printed onto [[vellum]] or [[onionskin]]: a durable, semi-transparent paper which made it easier for the composer to correct mistakes and revise his work, and also enabled copies of the manuscript to be reproduced through the [[ozalid |ozalid process]]. Also at this time, a music copyist was often employed to hand-copy individual parts (for each musician) from a composer's musical score. Neatness, speed, and accuracy were desirable traits of a skilled copyist.

With the advent of the personal computer in the late 1980s and beyond, music manuscript is becoming a lost art, as all of the "drawing" of each note, symbol, staff, written instruction, etc., can now be accomplished by a [[Computer graphics|graphics]] computer software made for this purpose, such as [[Dorico]], [[Finale (software)|Finale]] or [[Sibelius (software)|Sibelius]]. Even individual parts of an [[orchestration|orchestral]] score can be extracted and printed with this method. [[MIDI composition|MIDI]] software is also available, which enables the composer to play notes, melodies, chords, etc. on a [[piano]]-type keyboard and have the result transcribed into manuscript format.{{clarify|date=August 2014|reason=What is "manuscript format"? What does a computer have to do with a handwritten source of music?}}

'''National School of Drama''' (or '''NSD''') is a theatre training institute situated at [[New Delhi]], [[India]]. It is an autonomous organization under [[Ministry of Culture (India)|Ministry of Culture]], [[Government of India]]. It was set up in 1959 by the [[Sangeet Natak Akademi]], and became an independent school in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qYfH1tOwsHcC&amp;pg=PA676&amp;dq=%22national+school+of+drama%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0 Training - National School of Drama]''The Columbia encyclopedia of modern drama'', by Gabrielle H. Cody, Evert Sprinchorn. Columbia University Press, 2007. {{ISBN|0-231-14422-9}}. ''Page 766''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 it was granted [[deemed university]] status, but in 2011 it was revoked on the institute's request.

==''History''==
The origins of the school can be traced back to a seminar in 1954, where the idea of a Central institution for theatre was mooted, subsequently, a draft scheme was prepared in 1955, and the [[Sangeet Natak Akademi]], which had [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] as its president, started drawing plans for the institution. Meanwhile, elsewhere in Delhi, Bharatiya Natya Sangh (BNS) with assistance from [[UNESCO]], independently established the 'Asian Theatre Institute' (ATI) on 20 January 1958, and in July 1958, ATI was taken over by the [[Sangeet Natak Akademi]] (SNA), India’s National Academy of Music, dance and drama of [[Government of India]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2009/20090315/spectrum/main1.htm National School of Drama ..over the past 50 years] [[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]] 15 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ns/&gt;

In the following year, the government merged it with the newly founded school, and thus NSD was established in April 1959 under the auspices of [[Sangeet Natak Akademi]]. Initially, the school was situated at [[Nizamuddin West]] and was called 'National School of Drama and Asian Theatre Institute, whose first batch passed out in 1961. During his tenure as the director of the institution, [[Ebrahim Alkazi]] (1962–1977), not just overhauled the syllabus, but also had the students dig and build platforms for a theatre in the backyard of a rented [[Kailash Colony]] house, where NSD had moved.&lt;ref name=hin&gt;{{cite news |title=Theatre is revelation (Interview) |url=http://www.hindu.com/mag/2008/02/24/stories/2008022450160500.htm |publisher=''[[The Hindu]]'' |date=24 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later when it moved to its present location, he also designed two theatres for NSD, including a 200-seat studio theatre, and the open-air Meghdoot theatre, under a banyan tree.&lt;ref name=ns/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=COkXM9n7KUcC&amp;pg=PA168&amp;dq=%22National+School+of+Drama%22#PPA168,M1 National School of Drama] ''The World Encyclopedia of Contemporary Theatre: Asia/Pacific'', by Don Rubin. Published by Taylor &amp; Francis, 2001. {{ISBN|0-415-26087-6}}. Page 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975 it became an [[Autonomous entity|autonomous]] organization, under the erstwhile Ministry of Education and Ministry of Culture, Department of Culture, with the name 'National School of Drama' and relocated in May 1975, to its present premises at [[Bahawalpur House]], the residence of [[Bahawalpur (princely state)|Bahawalpur]] a former [[princely state]]. However, the place is generally known by adjacent (now demolished) [[Mandi House]], the former residence of Raja of erstwhile [[Mandi State|Mandi princely state]].&lt;ref name=ns/&gt; In 1999, the School organized its first National Theatre Festival, 'Bharat Rang Mahotsav', generally held during the second week of January each year.

In 2008, the institution celebrated its golden jubilee at its annual theatre festival, ''[[Bharat Rang Mahotsav]]'', with a gathering of its alumni from all over the country,&lt;ref&gt;[http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/Features/Culture_Cauldron/National_School_of_Drama_celebrates_golden_jubilee_in_style/rssarticleshow/2694072.cms National School of Drama celebrates golden jubilee in style] [[The Economic Times]], 12 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; the festival’s satellite edition in Mumbai showcased plays of NSD graduates, including Ratan Thiyam’s Prologue, Bansi Kaul (Aranyadhipati Tantiya), Neelam Mansingh Chowdhury (The Suit), Sanjay Upadhyay (Harsingar), [[Baharul Islam (actor)|Baharul Islam]] (Akash), Mohan Maharishi (Dear Bapu) and [[M K Raina]] (Stay Yet Awhile).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/the-graduates/255144/|title=The Graduates|date=28 December 2007|publisher=Indian Express|accessdate=2 April 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004221012/http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/the-graduates/255144/|archivedate=4 October 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waman Kendre was appointed as Director the school in 2013.

===Deemed university status===
On 16 March 2005, the Government of India granted the NSD the status of [[deemed university]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pib.nic.in/release/rel_print_page1.asp?relid=7814 National School of Drama gets Deemed University Status][[Ministry of Human Resource Development (India)|Ministry of Human Resource Development]] 16 March 2005."The Government has declared the National School of Drama, New Delhi as Deemed to be University with immediate effect."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/mar162005/update11.asp ''NSD declared deemed university''] [[Deccan Herald]] 16 March 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2010 the NSD Society asked for the deemed university status to be revoked since "[it] could undermine the professional training, autonomy, and flexibility required in the creative fields such as theatre." Thus, in October 2011 the status was revoked on request of NSD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2518525.ece |title=The Hindu : News / National : NSD loses deemed varsity status on own request  |work=thehindu.com |accessdate=9 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oerol''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈurɔl}}) is a cultural festival on the island of [[Terschelling]] in the [[Netherlands]] that is held annually in June. The ten-day festival is focused on live, public [[theatre]] as well as music and visual arts. 

In the Terschelling dialect, ''Oerol'' means "everywhere" or literally "overall" in the sense of covering the entire land (''oeral'' in standard [[West Frisian language|Frisian]]). Oerol takes its name from an old Terschelling tradition, when for a short time in early spring cattle were allowed to roam freely on the island, grazing on any and all available greenery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.oerol.nl/english/what.htm
|title = What is Oerol?|accessdate = 2008-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''oerol'' tradition continued until the arrival of paved roads, since cars and bicyclists collided at night with sleeping cattle; it was finally ended during the German occupation of the island in [[World War II]].

The premise of the festival is to use the entire island as a stage, although two primary stages (''Groene Strand'' and ''Westerkeyn'') are set up. Beaches, woods, dunes and other landscapes can function as performance spaces, and shows have also taken place in farm sheds, boathouses and an army bunker. Tickets are sold in the form of "passports" allowing access to the island for part or all of the week, and then tickets are available for the individual performances.&lt;ref name="Terschellings Oerol Festival"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.oerol.nl/english/index.htm|title = Terschellings Oerol Festival|accessdate = 2008-02-23|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080418080549/http://www.oerol.nl/english/index.htm|archivedate = 2008-04-18|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Street theatre acts, art, and podium musical performances are free during the festival. Over 50,000 people visited the island and some 95,000 tickets were sold for the 2007 festival.&lt;ref name="Terschellings Oerol Festival"/&gt; The 2009 Oerol Festival took place from June 12-21, and in 2010, the Oerol Festival took place from June 11-20. In 2011, the Festival took place from June 17-27. The 2012 dates are June 15-24.

'''''Oh! Calcutta!''''' is an [[avant-garde]] theatrical [[revue]], created by British drama critic [[Kenneth Tynan]]. The show, consisting of sketches on sex-related topics, debuted [[Off-Broadway]] in 1969 and then in the [[West End theatre|West End]] in 1970. It ran in London for over 3,900 performances, and in New York initially for 1,314. Revivals enjoyed even longer runs, including a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] revival that ran for 5,959 performances, making the show the longest-running revue in Broadway history at the time.

As of 2018, its revival was still the longest-running revue in Broadway history, the second longest-running revival, after ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]'', and the [[List of the longest-running Broadway shows|eighth longest-running]] Broadway show ever.

The show sparked considerable controversy at the time, because it featured extended scenes of total nudity, both male and female. The title is taken from a painting by [[Clovis Trouille]], itself a  [[pun]] on "''O quel cul t'as!''" [[French language|French]] for "What an [[Buttocks|arse]] you have!".&lt;ref&gt;Clovis Trouille's portrait of a reclining nude shown from behind entitled "Oh Calcutta, Calcutta!" - a pun in French - was chosen as the title for the 1969 musical revue. (The French phrase "oh quel cul t'as" translates roughly as "oh what a lovely arse you have".)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and productions==
Tynan came up with the idea of putting on an erotic revue in the summer of 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Tynan, Kathleen (editor) ''Kenneth Tynan Letters'', London, Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Tynan had hoped that [[Harold Pinter]] would direct the production, in order to give it avant-garde legitimacy, but Pinter declined.  Sketches were written by, amongst others, [[Samuel Beckett]], [[John Lennon]], [[Sam Shepard]], [[Leonard Melfi]], [[Edna O'Brien]], [[Jules Feiffer]], and Tynan, and featured the cast naked. [[Peter Schickele]] (aka "PDQ Bach"), Robert Dennis and [[Stanley Walden]] were the revue's [[composer]]s, known as The Open Window.  Beckett's contribution, ''[[Breath (play)|Breath]]'', was used as a Prologue in the original New York staging, but Beckett eventually withdrew permission for its use.

The musical opened off-Broadway at the [[Village East Cinema|Eden Theatre]] on June 21, 1969, transferred to the [[Belasco Theatre]] on February 17, 1971, and closed on August 12, 1972 after a total of 1,314 performances. It was directed by [[Jacques Levy]] (later the songwriting partner of [[Bob Dylan]] on his album ''[[Desire (Bob Dylan album)|Desire]]'') and choreographed by [[Margo Sappington]]. The cast included Raina Barrett, Mark Dempsey, Katie Drew-Wilkinson, Boni Enten, [[Bill Macy]], [[Alan Rachins]], [[Leon Russom]], [[Margo Sappington]], Nancy Tribush and George Welbes,&lt;ref&gt;Front piece, OH! CALCUTTA!, Copyright 1969 by Grove Press, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the 3 "Open Window" composers.

The musical premiered in London on July 27, 1970 at [[Roundhouse (venue)|The Roundhouse]], and transferred to the [[West End theatre|West End]] [[Royalty Theatre]] on September 30, 1970, running through January 27, 1974. The show then transferred to the [[Duchess Theatre]] on January 28, 1974, where it ran until 1980, for a total of 3,918 performances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guidetomusicaltheatre.com/shows_o/ohcalcutta.htm Oh!Calcutta! listing] guidetomusicaltheatre.com, accessed July 31, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadwayworld.com/bwidb/productions/Oh%21_Calcutta%21_9224/ Oh Calcutta West End listing] broadwayworld.com, accessed July 31, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duchess-theatre.co.uk/  Duchess Theatre history] duchess-theatre.co.uk, accessed July 31, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The London show was produced by [[Michael White (producer)|Michael White]].&lt;ref name="Indie Walsh"&gt;{{cite news | first1=John | last1=Walsh | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/john-walsh-meets-michael-white-sultan-of-swingers-1327457.html | title=John Walsh meets...

[[File:NYC-Oh Calcutta-1981.jpg|thumb|180px|Billboard on Broadway in 1981]]
A revival opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the [[Edison Theatre]] on September 24, 1976 and closed on August 6, 1989 after 5,959 performances, again directed and choreographed by Levy and Sappington. The revival briefly became the longest-running show in [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] history. It remains Broadway's [[List of the longest-running Broadway shows|eighth longest-running show]] and the longest-running revue in Broadway history.&lt;ref&gt;Rich, Frank.[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/08/theater/critic-s-notebook-the-asterisks-of-oh-calcutta.html "The Asterisks of Oh Calcutta"] ''New York Times'', August 8, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[pay-per-view]] video production played on [[closed-circuit television]] in select cities in 1971, and was released theatrically in 1972; in both cases many cities and municipalities banned its showing. Frank Herold, an editor who worked on the film, provides commentary on this in a brief post he contributed to the project's Internet Movie Database page.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/user/ur12967066/ Oh! Calcutta!] imdb.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spanish-language premiere production opened on October 9, 1977 at Teatro Principe in Madrid, Spain, directed by Juan Jose Alonso Millan, who also translated the show.

==Sketches and songs==
''Note: the musical revue was in the form of sketches. These are taken from the 1971 production shown on pay-per-view. Lyrics and music by Robert Dennis, Peter Schickele and Stanley Walden (unless otherwise noted).''

===Act 1===
;Prologue: Samuel Beckett's "[[Breath_(play)|Breath]]" (until license withdrawn by author)

;Taking Off the Robe
The actors dance and remove their robes to the opening song ("Taking Off the Robe" (Oh! Calcutta!)).

;Jack and Jill
A boy and a girl who just met are in their own playland, with the boy constantly trying to find ways to seduce the girl who is afraid of him because he's a boy.  The sketch ends with the girl in a coma after the boy rapes her ("Jack &amp; Jill").

;A Suite of Five Letters
A song of five letters written by anonymous authors about their sexual preferences ("Suite for Five Letters").  Actually they were letters to the editor from various newspapers from olden times in London and later in the Suite, contemporary letters from sexual newspapers of the day.

;Dick and Jane
An uptight girl gets a lesson in loosening up after her lover is sick of her constantly stiff ways ("Dick &amp; Jane").

;Will Answer All Serious Replies
A young couple start to rethink getting into the [[Swinging (sexual practice)|swingers lifestyle]] after meeting the middle-aged couple who answer their ad ("(Will Answer All) Sincere Replies").

;Delicious Indignities
A chaste woman is caught by her admirer, who then proceeds to learn that she isn't as chaste as he thinks she is ("Delicious Indignities (or The Deflowering of Helen Axminster") was written by [[Sherman Yellen]]).

;Was It Good for You, Too?
A man participates in a sex study and the whole experience ends up turning into one big farce ("Was It Good For You Too? (Green Pants, I Like the Look)").  The scene plays like the [[Marx Brothers]] at a sex research facility.

===Act 2===
; "Who, Whom (Exchanges of Information)" (Added during run)

; Life Is Over Much Too Soon
A pre-filmed section, where the actors are nude outside doing interpretive dance ("Much Too Soon"), music and lyrics by Jacques Levy, Dennis, Schickele, and Walden.

; One on One
Another nude interpretive dance ("One on One (Clarence and Mildred)").

; Rock Garden
After a man rambles on about painting the fence and building a rock garden, his son talks about what girls ''really'' like ("Rock Garden").

; Four in Hand
A newcomer to a [[masturbation]] game can't seem to think of anything to masturbate to ("Four in Hand").  (The first draft of this sketch was written by [[John Lennon]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{IBDB name|6852|John Lennon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.specialsections.absoluteelsewhere.net/LennonLoreLegacy/oh_calcutta.html|title=Lennon Lore  &amp; Legacy: Oh! Calcutta!|website=Absolute Elsewhere: The Spirit Of John Lennon|accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Finale
Players come out to sing the final song and dance, also doing voiceover as to what the theater patrons are really thinking about the experience.  Examples include: "She has pretty eyes" (the joke being that all of the actors are nude at this point), "How come none of the guys have [[Erection|hard-ons]]?" "That's my boyfriend—that IS a hard-on", and "If they showed this in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], [[Spiro Agnew|Agnew]] would shit!" ("Coming Together, Going Together").

==Critical response==
[[Clive Barnes]], in his 1969 ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' review, wrote that "the humor is so doggedly sophomoric and soporific", adding "The failure here is almost exclusively a failure of the writers and the producers. The director, Jacques Levy, has done his best with the weak material at hand&amp;nbsp;... the nude scenes, while derivative, are attractive enough. The best effects&amp;nbsp;— including the rather sweet grope-in immediately after the intermission&amp;nbsp;— have been taken from Robert Joffrey's ballet 'Astarte', and the show uses the same projected media designers&amp;nbsp;... In sum, 'Oh! Calcutta!' is likely to disappoint different people in different ways, but disappointment is the order of the night."&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Clive. [https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/05/10/specials/tynan-calcutta.html  "Theater: 'Oh, Calcutta!' a Most Innocent Dirty Show"]. ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 18, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Irving Wardle]], writing in ''[[The Times]]'' in 1970, said: "I have seen better revues than ''Oh! Calcutta!'' but none based on ideas that strike me as more sympathetic. Namely that the ordinary human body is an object well worth attention: and that there is no reason why the public treatment of sex should not be extended to take in not only lyricism and personal emotion but also the rich harvest of bawdy jokes." He noted that the enjoyment and lack of embarrassment of the cast helped the audience to accept the more insubstantial elements of the revue's material and that the stage sets' screen projections assisted the dance numbers considerably, concluding: "In many ways it is a ghastly show: ill-written, juvenile, and attention-seeking. But it is not a menace".&lt;ref name="The Times Wardle"&gt;{{cite news | title=Sometimes funny – not a menace | publisher=Times Newspapers Limited | work=The Times | date=28 July 1970 | first1=Irving | issue=57929 | last1=Wardle | ref=pg.7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Obscenity allegations===
The 1970 Roundhouse, London production attracted the attention of the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]]'s Obscene Publications Squad, which sent two officers to a preview of the show. One of the officers returned twice more before recommending a prosecution under the [[Theatres Act 1968|1968 Theatres Act]] for obscenity. The [[Director of Public Prosecutions (England and Wales)|Director of Public Prosecutions]] sent its panel of experts&amp;nbsp;— including two retired headmistresses&amp;nbsp;— to see the Roundhouse production and their judgement that it was not obscene enabled it to transfer to London's West End.&lt;ref name="The Guardian Travis"&gt;{{cite news | first1=Alan | last1=Travis | url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/dec/23/alantravis | title=How two dames saved Oh!

The {{nihongo|'''Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan'''|海遊館|Kaiyūkan|known as the '''Kaiyukan'''}} is an aquarium located in the ward of [[Minato-ku, Osaka|Minato]] in [[Osaka, Osaka|Osaka]], [[Japan]], near Osaka Bay. It is one of the largest [[public aquarium]]s in the world,&lt;ref name="gojapango"/&gt; and is a member of the Japanese Association of Zoos and Aquariums (JAZA).

The aquarium is about a five-minute walk from [[Osakako Station]] on the [[Osaka Municipal Subway]] [[Chūō Line (Osaka)|Chūō Line]], and is next to the [[Tempozan Ferris Wheel]].&lt;ref name="gojapango"/&gt;

==Exhibits==

The walk-through aquarium displays marine life in several habitats comprising 27 tanks in 16 main exhibits with a total volume of 10,941 tons of water. The habitats are from the [[Pacific Ring of Fire|Ring of Fire]] area of the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The largest tank is {{Convert|9|m|0}} deep and holds {{Convert|5400|m3|0}} of water and a variety of fish including [[manta rays]] and 2 [[whale sharks]].&lt;ref name="aqua_exhibition"/&gt;

The tanks used in the aquarium are made of {{Convert|314|tonne|0}} of [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|acrylic glass]]. The largest single pane measures six meters by five meters by thirty centimeters and weighs roughly 10 tons.  At the thicknesses used, regular [[glass]] would be unwieldy and would not have the desired transparency.

The "New Interactive Area" that opened in 2013 allows visitors to see the animals up close and possibly touch them. In the "New Interactive Area", 3 zones are constructed, the Arctic zone, in which you see rounding ringed seals, Falkland Islands Zone, where you can see the rockhopper penguins, and the Maldives Zone, in which you can directly touch sharks and rays. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://planetyze.com/en/japan/osaka/osaka-aquarium-kaiyukan|title=Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan  - Osaka Travel Guide {{!}} Planetyze|website=Planetyze|language=en|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Our Little Genius''''' is a [[game show]] produced for the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network that was pulled before making it to air, hosted by [[Kevin Pollak]].&lt;ref name="hollywoodreporter"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/kevin-pollak-turns-genius-91959|title = Kevin Pollak turns "Genius"|first = James|last = Hibberd|date = December 3, 2009|work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate = December 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program was slated to premiere on Fox on January 13, 2010, at 9:15 PM Eastern following ''[[American Idol]]'' with a special 45-minute episode, with further episodes being 60 minutes.&lt;ref name = "realitytvworld"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.realitytvworld.com/news/fox-debut-mark-burnett-our-little-genius-game-show-january-13-9993.php|title = FOX to debut Mark Burnett's "Our Little Genius" game show January 13|first = Christopher|last = Rocchio|date = November 25, 2009|work = Reality TV World|accessdate = December 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the show was postponed on request by its creator and eventually [[list of television series canceled before airing an episode|canceled]] before any episodes aired due to two separate issues related to the show's integrity.

According to Fox, [[child prodigy|child prodigies]] would answer trivia questions to win money for their families; their parents would be able to appeal to experts for help.&lt;ref name = "realitytvworld"/&gt;

==Cast and crew==
The show's producers were (in alphabetical order): Noah Bonnett, Mark Burnett, Lauren Franson, Ron Muccianti, Dave Schapiro, Tod Schellinger, John Stevens, Jenny Tyson and Chris Wagner.  Music was produced by David Vanacore. The film editors were Robert M. Malachowski Jr. and Hudson Smith. The casting department was Jennifer Cron and Joshua Robinson.

==Removal from schedule==
On January 7, 2010, one week before its scheduled premiere, the show's creator, [[Mark Burnett]], announced that he'd asked Fox to postpone it due to concerns about its integrity. Burnett said that issues with how information was relayed to contestants were serious enough that he felt compelled to reshoot the episodes. Fox supported Burnett's decision, and added that all contestants would keep their winnings.&lt;ref name="NYTInteg"&gt;Wyatt, Edward. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/08/business/media/08genius.html Integrity Concerns Force Fox to Postpone Child Quiz Show]. [[The New York Times]], 2010-01-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that some contestants may have known what questions were going to be asked (though not the answers) rather than just the topics to be covered.&lt;ref name="NYTInteg"/&gt;  The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that Burnett's main concern was that contestants somehow got more information than they should have prior to taping.&lt;ref&gt;Fernandez, Maria Elena. [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2010/01/fox-pulls-our-little-genius-before-it-premieres-under-strange-circumstances.html Fox pulls 'Our Little Genius' before it premieres]. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 2010-01-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the abrupt pulling of the series, ''[[American Idol]]'' aired for 90 minutes that night, with a repeat showing of the "[[Once Upon a Time in Springfield]]" episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' following at 9:30 PM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/01/07/foxs-our-little-genius-pulled-from-schedule-will-it-return/38003 |title=Fox’s Our Little Genius Pulled From Schedule, Will It Return?|last1=Gorman|first1=Bill |publisher=Tvbythenumbers.com |date=7 January 2010 |accessdate=2016-09-13|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110020712/http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/01/07/foxs-our-little-genius-pulled-from-schedule-will-it-return/38003|archivedate=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "variety-fox-pulls-little-genius"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118013460.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1|title = FOX Pulls "Our Little Genius"|last = Schneider|first = Michael|date = January 7, 2010|work = Variety|accessdate = January 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegations of cheating==
''The New York Times'' reported that a member of the production team gave a prospective contestant and his parents specific answers to at least four questions. If the show were found to be deliberately rigged, it would mark the first known instance of such a deception in America since the [[quiz show scandals]] of the late 1950s. Rigging a game show is a felony under the [[Communications Act of 1934]] ({{usc|47|509}}), which was added to the law in 1960 in the wake of the scandals.  The [[Federal Communications Commission]] has opened an inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Wyatt, Edward [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/20/business/media/20genius.html F.C.C. Opens an Inquiry for a Game Show on FOX]. ''[[The New York Times]]'', 2010-02-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Puppet Theatre Barge''' is a unique, fifty-seat [[marionette|marionette theatre]] on a converted barge in London. The theatre presents [[puppet|puppet shows]] for children and adults and is moored in [[Maida Vale#Little Venice|Little Venice]] throughout the year and in [[Richmond-upon-Thames]] during the summer.

The company produces shows taken from traditional children’s tales such as the [[Brer Rabbit]] stories, [[Aesop's Fables]] and original work featuring [[Punch and Judy|Punch]], as well as drama by writers&lt;ref&gt;Middleton, Gren, 1999, "Why promote text-based drama for live animation?", in ''Contemporary Theatre Review'', volume 9, issue 4, p. 41, OPA {{ISBN|90-5755-008-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Federico García Lorca]], and has also commissioned original plays from contemporary published writers, such as [[Wendy Cope]],&lt;ref&gt;Cope, Wendy, 1991, ''The River Girl'', London: Faber and Faber Limited {{ISBN|0-571-16062-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Howard Barker]]&lt;ref&gt;Barker, Howard, 1993, ''All He Fears'', London: Calder Publications Ltd {{ISBN|0-7145-4235-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barker, Howard, 1995, "Dire la mélancolie, l'exprimer par le corps", in ''Puck'', volume 8, p. 77-79, Institut International de la Marionnette&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Finuala Dowling]].

== History ==
[[File:London - The Puppet Barge - 2953.jpg|thumb|Barge interior]]
Gren Middleton and Juliet Rogers formed Movingstage Marionette Company in 1979. After a couple of years touring marionette shows, Middleton and Rogers bought an old 80&amp;nbsp;ft Thames lighter of riveted iron construction, built in the 1930s and converted it into a double-bridge string marionette theatre.

The Puppet Theatre Barge was opened to the public on 28 January 1982&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Keith &amp; Shaw, Phyllida, 1992, ''On the Brink of Belonging: A national enquiry into puppetry'', p. 77, London: Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation {{ISBN|978-0-903319-60-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; at Camden Lock in north London. Its first performance was [[The Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner]], by [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]].&lt;!-- Deleted image removed:  [[File:Barge1983 001.JPG|thumb|The Puppet Barge at Camden Lock shortly after opening]]  --&gt;In 1988, the barge moved to the basin at Little Venice, near Paddington.

The first two summer tours, in 1982 and 1983, were undertaken up the [[Grand Union Canal]], performing at Pitstone Wharf in Buckinghamshire, over the Tring summit. From 1984 until 2008 the barge toured every summer up the [[River Thames]], performing daily shows as far upstream as [[Sandford-on-Thames]], near Oxford. Over the years, the barge staged performances at [[Abingdon, Oxfordshire|Abingdon]], [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]], [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], [[Henley-upon-Thames]], [[Marlow, Buckinghamshire|Marlow]], [[Cliveden]], [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] and [[Walton-upon-Thames]].

In 2017, theatre critic Darren Luke Mawdsley visited the Puppet Theatre Barge to watch The Flight of Babuscha Baboon. He described his visit as, '...a pleasure; an example of the rich and diverse arts offering that our fabulous city has to offer.'

In 1995, Juliet Rogers designed [[News Bunny]], the station mascot for the short-lived UK TV Station [[LIVE TV]].

Since 2009, the barge has put on shows in Little Venice from October to June and spent the summer months moored at [[Richmond-upon-Thames]].

'''Radio in Mexico''' is a mass medium with 98 percent national penetration and a wider diversity of owners and programming than on television. In a model similar to that of [[radio in the United States]], Mexican radio in its history has been largely commercial, but with a strong state presence and a rising number of noncommercial stations in the 2000s and early 2010s. In August 2015, there were 1,999 legal radio stations, almost 75 percent of them on the FM band.&lt;ref name="cuadro"&gt;[http://www.ift.org.mx/sites/default/files/contenidogeneral/industria/cuadroestadisticodedistribuciondeestaciones160518.pdf IFT Distribution of Stations: August 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===The 1920s: Pioneers and establishment===
The development of Mexican radio would take place simultaneously in various cities around the country, as opposed to the rather centralized, Mexico City-based development of television. The first radio broadcasts in Mexico took place in 1921, as part of celebrations of the centennial of the signing of the [[Treaty of Córdoba]], which formalized Mexican independence. On September 27, 1921, during the Centennial International Commercial Exposition in Mexico City, a small radio station was set up by the government and run by Agustín Flores, an inspector in the General Directorate of Telegraphy. That same night, the Gómez Fernández brothers mounted their first radio transmissions, also in Mexico City; their station, with 20 watts power, would operate until January 1922, with programs of one hour on Saturday and Sunday.&lt;ref name="fmb"&gt;Fernando Mejía Barquera, [http://radiomex.blogspot.com/2007/09/historia-mnima-de-la-radio-en-mxico.html "Historia mínima de la radio en México (1920–1996)"], 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

A month later, Constantino de Tárnava, a ham radio operator in [[Monterrey]], [[Nuevo León]], began regular transmissions of a station he called TND (Tárnava Notre Dame); de Tárnava would later own [[XEH-AM]], one of Nuevo León's first licensed radio stations.&lt;ref name="alisky"/&gt; The next year, radio stations would begin operations in Mexico City, [[Pachuca]], [[Cuernavaca]], [[Guadalajara]], [[Morelia]], [[San Luis Potosí, San Luis Potosí|San Luis Potosí]], [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua]], and [[Ciudad Juárez]]. Also in 1922, the National Radio League (''Liga Nacional de Radio''), the first radio association in Mexico, was formed.

On May 8, 1923, the station "El Universal/La Casa del Radio" (later CYL) came to air in Mexico City with 50 watts of power. The station was co-owned by the ''[[El Universal (Mexico)|El Universal]]'' newspaper and Raúl Azcárraga, owner of the La Casa del Radio chain of radio stores.&lt;ref name="fmb"/&gt; [[Andrés Segovia]] and [[Manuel Ponce]] were among the luminaries present at the station's formal inauguration that evening. That September, the station would increase its power to 500 watts; it would leave the air in 1928.

On September 15, the "El Buen Tono" cigarette company began the operation of its own station. This station would receive the CYB callsign after Mexico was assigned a range of international callsigns in 1924, and upon the switch of Mexico's callsign assignments to "X" in 1929, it would become [[XEB-AM|XEB]], the oldest Mexican radio station still in operation today.&lt;ref name="fmb"/&gt; 1924 also saw the launch of radio stations by the ''[[Excélsior]]'' newspaper (CYX) and the [[Secretariat of Public Education (Mexico)|Secretariat of Public Education]] (CZE, later XFX). The latter station, on 560&amp;nbsp;kHz, would operate until 1929, and the SEP would not operate another radio station until the 1960s.

The first communications law, the Electric Communications Law, was promulgated in 1926 by President [[Plutarco Elías Calles]]. Article 12 of the law provided that radio programming "should not harm the security of the State" or "the established government".&lt;ref name="fmb"/&gt;

In 1929, callsigns were reassigned again. Mexico received the range XAA to XPZ; callsigns beginning in XE would be used for broadcasting.&lt;ref name="fmb"/&gt; In the 1940s, the XH callsign series would be used for new FM and TV stations, though certain stations of both types that were co-owned with existing AM stations were allowed to use XE calls (such as [[XEWV-FM]] in [[Mexicali]] or [[XET-TV]] in [[Monterrey]]).

===1930s: Consolidation of Mexican radio===
The 1930s saw the development of many new radio stations in Mexico. [[XEN-AM|XEN]] (then on 710&amp;nbsp;kHz), Radio Mundial, provided the Mexico City area with the world's first all-news radio station in 1930.&lt;ref name="fmb"/&gt; But the most important new radio station in 1930 was [[XEW-AM|XEW]] 900, owned by [[Emilio Azcárraga Vidaurreta]]. Known as the "Voice of Latin America", XEW marked the changing of a guard in Mexican radio development and the beginning of its consolidation as a viable business. It specialized in developing daily programming that attracted viewers, and thus advertisers. Azcárraga's empire grew with the sign-on of [[XEQ-AM|XEQ]] in 1938.

The National Revolutionary Party, predecessor to the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]], launched station XEFO (originally known as "XE-PNR") 940&amp;nbsp;kHz in Mexico City on January 1, 1931. The station served as a method of disseminating party ideology and propaganda and was the primary news and propaganda source for the party during the 1934 presidential elections that brought [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] into power.&lt;ref name="eesr"&gt;Enrique E. Sánchez Ruiz, "Orígenes de la radiodifusión en México". Guadalajara: ITESO, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; The station was sold in 1941 and was succeeded by two separate outlets: [[XEQR-AM|XEQR]] on 1030, owned by Francisco Aguirre Jiménez, and [[XERED-AM|XERCN]] 1110, owned by Rafael Cutberto Navarro and his Radio Cadena Nacional.

In 1931, the regime of ''permits'' for broadcast stations was changed to one where the government awarded ''concessions'' to use and operate stations on the radio spectrum, considered a public good ultimately owned by the state. Concessions awarded to stations were valid for up to 50 years. Likewise, in 1933, the government established a limit of 10 percent of broadcast time dedicated to commercial announcements, as well as the ability for the government to broadcast messages over commercial radio stations.&lt;ref name="fmb"/&gt;

In 1937, this latter feature of Mexican radio would produce [[La Hora Nacional]], one of the world's oldest continuously-aired radio programs, which is broadcast at 10pm Sunday nights on all Mexican radio stations. La Hora Nacional was produced by the new Autonomous Dependency for Press and Publicity (DAPP),&lt;ref name="fmb"/&gt; which built station XEDP on AM and shortwave counterpart XEXA but disappeared in 1939 with its stations to languish with little government support until the early 1940s. In 1969, the government set a quota of 12.5 percent of the airtime of all broadcast stations to be allotted for its uses.

In 1937, the Mexican Association of Radio Broadcasters was formed as the first industry association; soon renamed to the Mexican Association of Commercial Radio Broadcasters (AMERC, ''Asociación Mexicana de Radiodifusoras Comerciales''), it initially consisted of 20 radio stations, half of them in Mexico City.&lt;ref name="fmb"/&gt;

The 1930s also saw the development of the first [[border blaster]]s, stations that took advantage of Mexico's higher power limits and looser regulatory requirements for AM radio stations and boomed their signals toward the United States, often with paid preaching programs. The original border blaster, John Brinkley's XER in [[Ciudad Acuña, Coahuila|Villa Acuña, Coahuila]], was replaced with XERA in 1935. XERA broadcast at 500 kilowatts and operated until 1939, when it was shut down amidst a treaty with the United States.&lt;ref name="xerf"&gt;[http://www.ominous-valve.com/xerf.html History of XERF]&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the decade, the first university broadcasters came into operation: [[XEUN-AM|XEUN]], the station of the [[Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México]], and [[XEXQ-AM|XEXQ]], operated by the [[Universidad Autónoma de San Luis Potosí]].&lt;ref name="fmb"/&gt;

===1940s: Networking===
1940 saw a further pioneering effort in radio. Station [[XEQK-AM|XEQK]] in Mexico City, which had struggled since signing on in 1938, began transmitting the time, every minute on the minute, interspersed with short commercial announcements. The transmissions were enough of a success, both in terms of audience and advertising money, that the station dropped its other programs in 1942.&lt;ref name="hora"&gt;[http://www.imer.mx/la-nueva-hora-exacta-eslinea-de-tiempo-de-la-hora-exacta/ IMER: History of La Hora Exacta]&lt;/ref&gt; "La QK", as it was popularly known, quickly became renowned for its distinctive "Hora Exacta" time format; it would be sold to IMER in 1983, and the format would remain on the air until 2003.

In 1941, the foundation of [[Radio Programas de México]], half-controlled by the Azcárraga family and Clemente Serna Martínez, marked the beginning of a networking frenzy in Mexico. Stations in interior Mexico not only received access to better programming produced in Mexico City and recorded on vinyl and magnetic tape but also to national advertisers. Within a decade, RPM had 92 affiliates, forming a network that at its height included more than half of the country's radio stations.&lt;ref&gt;Arturo Merayo Pérez, ''La radio en Iberoamérica: evolución, diagnóstico, prospectiva''. Comunicación Social, 2007: 246.&lt;/ref&gt; Regional and semi-national networks included Radiodifusoras Asociadas, S.A. (RASA), which mostly had stations in the [[Bajío]] region, and Radio Central Radiofónica, with its affiliate portfolio located in central Mexico.

Also in 1941, the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Radio, or CIR, was founded as a chamber of commerce for the radio industry. In the early 1970s, it expanded its focus to include television and changed its name to the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Radio y la Televisión (CIRT).&lt;ref name="fmb"/&gt;

In 1947, [[XHRF-FM|XERF-AM]] was founded in Villa Acuña,&lt;ref name="xerf"/&gt; which would begin a new generation of border blaster radio stations including [[XEPRS-AM|XERB]] and [[XETRA-AM|XETRA]] in Tijuana, Baja California. While border blasters usually programmed in English, they had to meet the requirements of their Mexican concessions, including broadcast of [[La Hora Nacional]] and the [[Himno Nacional Mexicano|Mexican national anthem]]. That same year, the government renewed its radio efforts with the launch of [[XEX-AM|XEX]] 730 in Mexico City, a 500,000-watt radio station which used the equipment of the former XERA in Villa Acuña and was intended as a national-level radio station.

===1950s: Recorded music, the beginnings of FM and the expansion of AM===
The 1950s saw development on all frequencies. While the number of stations on the whole grew from 201 in 1951 to 332 in 1959, almost all on AM, the 1950s were a decade where Mexico began its forays into television and [[FM broadcasting|FM radio]]. The first television station in Mexico, [[XHTV-TV|XHTV]] in Mexico City, signed on August 31, 1950; two years later, the capital city saw the birth of the nation's first FM radio station, [[XHFM-FM (Mexico City)|XHFM]].&lt;ref name="fmb"/&gt; XHFM, known as "Radio Joya", would close in 1957 after its studios were severely damaged in an earthquake. However, FM stations were slowly beginning to appear across the country: [[XEOYE-FM|XEOY-FM]] and [[XERFR-FM|XERPM-FM]] in Mexico City and [[XET-FM]] in Monterrey were all on air by the end of the decade, and there would be 49 FM stations across the country for 1969.

On the AM band, which still represented the vast majority of radio stations, listeners and advertisers, live programming was steadily supplanted by recorded music. Smaller stations with fewer resources to produce live programming are among the first to convert, though broadcasters in all markets quickly find out that playing recordings dramatically lowered their stations' overhead. Meanwhile, more networks sprung up, and in some cases, smaller stations ceded their operation rights to the networks, who came to control dozens of radio stations across the country. This transformation was key in the development of large radio groups.&lt;ref name="fmb"/&gt;

At the same time, however, there was tension between radio stations in Mexico City and those in the nation's interior. The networks began to install ''repetidoras'' (repeaters) of their programming; XEW, for instance, established such stations in San Luis Potosí, Monterrey, [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]], Oaxaca and Guadalajara, among other cities. These stations, which merely served to rebroadcast programming entirely produced in the capital, were seen as a serious threat by the regional broadcasters, who banded together to form the Coordinating Committee of Broadcasters in the States (CCRE).&lt;ref name="werner"&gt;Michael Werner, "Radio". ''Concise Encyclopedia of Mexico'', 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1950s and 1960s also saw the least radio activity on behalf of the government. With the closure of the SEP's radio stations, only Radio UNAM and [[XEJB-AM|XEJB]], the radio station of the state government of Jalisco, were on the air. The number of new radio stations served as important cultural links between Mexico's urban centers and its many rural villages; one 1954 summary of radio in interior Mexico noted that "radio is certainly one of the instruments of integration in Mexico."&lt;ref name="alisky"&gt;Marvin Alisky, "Mexico's Rural Radio", ''The Quarterly of Film, Radio and Television'' 8.4 (Summer 1954): 405–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1960s: Stereo FM and new radio groups===
1960 saw the promulgation of a new Federal Radio and Television Law,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dof.gob.mx/nota_to_imagen_fs.php?codnota=4621574&amp;fecha=19/01/1960&amp;cod_diario=198690 Ley Federal de Radio y Televisión] (1960)&lt;/ref&gt; which divided broadcasting stations into two categories; concessions, which were commercial stations with the ability to broadcast advertising, and permits, which were noncommercial and awarded to nonprofit entities. The law, which remained in effect with modifications for 54 years, also forced stations to get approval from the [[Secretariat of Communications and Transport (Mexico)|SCT]] to receive special approval for programming in foreign languages.&lt;ref&gt;UPI, "Mexico Adopts Radio-TV Code", ''Los Angeles Times'' 21 January 1960&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, the first locally owned, cultural radio station, XEYT in [[Teocelo, Veracruz]] (now [[XEYTM-AM]]), came to air under the auspices of the Centro de Promoción Social y Cultural A.C. In the same state, in [[Huayacocotla]], shortwave station and radio school XEJN-OC took to air with literacy programming broadcast to literacy centers throughout the station's broadcast area; after 35 years, its transmissions would move to FM, with the station becoming [[XHFCE-FM]].&lt;ref name="fmb"/&gt;

In 1967, Joaquín Vargas Gómez, who had visited the United States and was impressed with its [[FM stereo]] stations, worked to bring the system to Mexico. He founded Stereorey, a network of stereo FM stations with a beautiful music format; among the most important stations in the network were [[XHSRO-FM]] 92.5 in Monterrey and [[XHMVS-FM|XHV-FM]] 102.5 in Mexico City. Stereorey eventually became the cornerstone of a larger media empire, known as [[MVS Comunicaciones]], which also included other radio stations and pay television systems. The 1960s also saw the foundation of [[Grupo ACIR]] and [[Radio Fórmula]], two of the country's largest radio groups; [[Grupo Radiorama]] would follow in the early 1970s.

===The expansion of public radio===
1968 saw the return of the Secretariat of Public Education to radio for the first time since the 1940s with the sign-on of [[XEEP-AM]] 1060 "Radio Educación".&lt;ref name="fmb"/&gt; However, it came to air with subpar and antiquated equipment, a program schedule that included a break of several hours in the middle of the day, and a small staff. It was not until the government of [[Luis Echeverría]] in 1972 that Radio Educación would receive new facilities, upgraded equipment and an expanded budget.

In 1976, Radio Fórmula entered into financial difficulties; two years later, it sold three of its seven stations to the federal government. The government's acquisition of [[XEB-AM]], [[XEMP-AM]] and [[XEDTL-AM|XERPM-AM]] led to the creation of a group within the [[Dirección General de Radio, Televisión y Cinematografía|General Directorate of Radio, Television and Film (RTC)]] of [[SEGOB]]. When the [[Instituto Mexicano de la Radio]] was created in 1983, uniting the radio stations operated by various government dependencies into one agency, this trio of AM radio stations served as its core.&lt;ref name="fmb"/&gt;

1979 saw the launch of a new variety of AM radio station. [[XEZV-AM]] came to air in [[Tlapa de Comonfort|Tlapa de Comonfort, Guerrero]], operated by the [[National Indigenist Institute]].&lt;ref name="fmb"/&gt; "The Voice of the Mountains" was part of an initiative to promote educational and social development in indigenous regions of Mexico. In 1982, four more stations were launched; today, the INI's successor, the [[Comisión Nacional para el Desarrollo de los Pueblos Indígenas|CDI]], operates the [[Sistema de Radiodifusoras Culturales Indigenistas]] composed of 15 medium-wave radio services and several experimental FM radio stations broadcasting in 31 languages.

===The rise of FM===
By 1970, the FM band was still underdeveloped due to the high prices for FM receivers. In order to develop FM, the Association of FM Broadcasters was formed that year to promote lower prices for FM receivers and increased advertiser interest. Its membership consisted of Vargas Gómez and representatives for [[XEW-FM]], Núcleo Radio Mil and [[Grupo Imagen|Radio Imagen]], which owned two Mexico City FMs.&lt;ref name="fmb"/&gt; They succeeded in expanding the reach of the FM band; there were 174 FM stations in 1980, more than double the 65 on the air in 1970.

In 1980, AM radio stations captured 77 percent of the Mexican radio audience. However, in the five years that followed, the tables turned in favor of FM, which had a 64.9 percent market share as opposed to AM's 35.1 percent. The FM band's stereo capabilities and the increased prevalence of portable radios with improved sound quality would lead to the development of AM as a specialized talk radio band, with music radio stations migrating to FM.&lt;ref name="fmb"/&gt;

In 1996, the [[Federal Commission of Telecommunications (Mexico)|Federal Telecommunications Commission]] (COFETEL) was created to replace many of the regulatory functions of the SCT in the telecommunications sector. However, the SCT continued issuing concessions and permits until 2006, when it began exercising control over broadcasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.etcetera.com.mx/articulo/cofetel_creacion,_evolucion_y_desafios_judiciales/19277/|title=Cofetel: creación, evolución y desafíos judiciales|first=Clara Luz|last=Álvarez|work=Etcétera|date=2013-05-22|accessdate=2015-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Grupo ACIR announced its intention to merge with Radiópolis (now [[Televisa Radio]]), the radio division of [[Televisa]], with the latter taking a 27.8 percent stake in ACIR. However, this was shot down by antitrust authorities, who expressed concern that the combination of ACIR and Televisa would squeeze smaller competitors out of the advertising market.&lt;ref&gt;Graham Gori, "Mexico Moves to Bar Televisa's Radio Deal", ''New York Times'' 5 December 2000: W1&lt;/ref&gt;

===The AM-FM migration===
The precursor to the AM-FM migration of 2008 came in 1994, when the CIRT successfully lobbied for the government to award FM frequencies to 80 AM stations across the country, turning them into combo stations.&lt;ref name="contralinea"&gt;Claudia Villegas Cárdenas, [http://www.contralinea.com.mx/c7/html/politica/due%F1os.html Los dueños de la radio y la televisión en México], ''Contralínea'' 2004&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 2003, the Mexican radio industry was still dominated by AM radio stations, with 855 compared to 628 FM stations.&lt;ref name="conpermiso"/&gt;

In 2008, the government of [[Felipe Calderón]] announced a scheme to move as many AM radio stations as possible to the FM band, in order to increase broadcast quality for listeners and permit the widespread development of future radio technologies on the FM band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=CNN Expansión|url=http://www.cnnexpansion.com/actualidad/2008/09/15/la-sct-fija-migracion-radial-de-am-a-fm|date=2008-09-15|accessdate=2015-09-04|title=La SCT fija migración radial de AM a FM}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of stations, mostly outside of the largest metropolitan areas, either moved to FM after a year of AM-FM simulcasting or became AM and FM combo radio stations. Most AM stations that did not migrate were stations serving indigenous communities, in large metropolitan areas or border regions where there was no room to migrate stations, or stations that were forced to become AM-FM combos in order to guarantee the continuity of radio service in parts of their coverage areas.

However, even in the largest of markets, the decline of AM radio is such that some stations are no longer economically viable. [[XEDA-AM]] in Mexico City signed off in May 2015 after seeing listenership, commercial advertising income and federal government advertising all drop; its owner stated that "there's no market for AM".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Fernando|last=Mejía Barquera|work=Milenio|url=http://www.milenio.com/firmas/fernando_mejia_barquera/Radio-mexicana-reto-digitalizacion_18_538926113.html|title=Radio mexicana: el reto de la digitalización|date=2015-06-18|accessdate=2015-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After initially authorizing it for stations within 320 kilometers of the United States-Mexico border in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;"Mexico Authorizes Transmission of HD Radio Broadcasting", ''Wireless News'' 27 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Cofetel adopted the [[HD Radio]] standard, as used in the United States, for digital radio transmissions nationwide in 2011. Several large broadcasters, such as IMER, Radio Centro and Radio Fórmula, have equipped stations with HD Radio. In the 1990s, Mexico experimented with [[digital audio broadcasting]] (DAB) technology; adoption of it, however, was never attempted as a group of radio station owners in northern Mexico, concerned about the United States' decision to not use DAB and worried that they would lose access to US audiences, lobbied the CIRT to not take action.&lt;ref name="fmb"/&gt;

The 2000s have been marked by an increase in the number of new noncommercial radio stations, such as those awarded to state governments and universities, as well as the first licensed [[community radio]] stations in decades.&lt;ref name="conpermiso"/&gt; This has largely occurred because there were no new commercial radio stations put out for bid between 1995 and 2015. In 2003, 88% of Mexican radio stations were commercial; that figure was 75% for 2015.&lt;ref name="cuadro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="conpermiso"/&gt;

===2010s: Broadcasting reform, a radio station auction and more station migrations===
In 2013 and 2014, as part of the reforms of the [[Pacto por México]], constitutional reform and a new telecommunications and broadcasting law were passed. The reforms created a new and more autonomous broadcasting regulator, the [[Federal Telecommunications Institute]], and also replaced the concession/permit system with a three-tiered classification of station concessions, consisting of commercial use, public use, and social use tiers. The social use tier further includes subcategories for community and indigenous radio stations, for which the 106-108 MHz sub-band is reserved moving forward.&lt;ref name="lineam"/&gt; By May 2018, nearly four years after the passage of the ''Ley Federal de Telecomunicaciones y Radiodifusión'', the IFT had awarded concessions to 50 community and 7 indigenous stations.{{r|cuadro}}

Equally significant was the IFT-4 radio station auction, the first of its kind, which took place in early 2017. The auction originally sought to award 255 frequencies (191 FM and 66 AM) nationwide, but due to lack of interest in some areas and the presence of a controversial bidder (Tecnoradio) inflating prices for some stations, only 141 stations, including 114 FM and 27 AMs, were awarded in the auction, the first new commercial stations in more than 20 years.

A technical change made in 2016 reduced mandatory station spacing on FM from 800 to 400 kHz, which immediately opened the door to a number of new stations in major cities. A total of 41 stations in major cities and border areas, almost all commercial, were allowed to move to FM in 2017. Additionally, a frequency made available by the move to 400 kHz was awarded to be Mexico City's first community station, [[XHCDMX-FM]] "Violeta Radio", which is slated to begin transmissions in late 2018.

==Commercial radio==
1,452, or 72%, of Mexico's 1,999 licensed radio stations are commercial.&lt;ref name="cuadro"/&gt; Commercial radio in Mexico is largely owned at the regional or national level. Five large radio groups dominate the Mexican radio landscape: [[Grupo Radio Centro]], [[Grupo ACIR]], [[MVS Radio]], [[Radio Fórmula]], [[Grupo Radiorama|Radiorama]] and [[Televisa Radio]], with a variety of local and regional broadcasters as well. Mid-size groups include [[NRM Comunicaciones]], [[Grupo Imagen]], and the government's [[Instituto Mexicano de la Radio]]. These groups either own large amounts of stations, form regional alliances with broadcasters, or have large syndication and advertising networks. Some analysts consider Mexico's radio markets to be oligarchical, with the vast majority of audiences and advertising revenue concentrated in few hands.&lt;ref name="contralinea"/&gt; Many commercial radio formats are national, with networks formed by owned-and-operated and affiliated stations; for instance, MVS Radio owns the [[La Mejor]] and [[Exa FM]] formats, carried by a mix of MVS Radio-owned stations and local affiliates in various cities.

==Noncommercial radio==

Mexican law divides noncommercial radio station concessions into four types: public, social, social community and social indigenous.&lt;ref name="lineam"&gt;{{cite news|work=Notimex|url=http://eleconomista.com.mx/industrias/2015/07/24/ift-publica-lineamientos-otorgar-concesiones|title=IFT publica lineamientos para otorgar concesiones|date=2015-07-24|accessdate=2015-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--private use concessions aren't on radio or TV--&gt; These distinctions replaced permits with the Federal Telecommunications and Broadcasting Law, passed in 2014.

===Public radio===
Public radio is more prevalent in Mexico than in the United States, and governments at various levels and other public institutions have made significant forays into the radio space. The federal government owns radio stations through the [[Instituto Mexicano de la Radio]] (IMER), the SRCI stations (see below), and the Secretariat of Public Education and its [[XEEP-AM|Radio Educación]] on AM and shortwave. Many state governments operate radio stations or even statewide radio networks. The most extensive is [[CORTV]] in the state of Oaxaca, with a network of 32 transmitters plus a 33rd station in [[Oaxaca, Oaxaca]], while some radio services, such as [[XHZH-FM]] Radio Zacatecas, are one-station. Additionally, there are some municipally owned radio stations, the largest being [[XHCUN-FM]] in [[Cancún]].{{mexico-inf|FM|accessdate=2015-08-14}}

Public radio services are constrained by small budgets. In 2010, [[Radio France International]] received a budget of 576 million euros, while IMER received the equivalent of 8 million euros.&lt;ref&gt;Miguel Flores Vilchis, [http://www.comunicacionsocial.uam.mx/semanario/v-xvii/num8/num8.pdf "Raquítico, el gasto asignado a la radio pública en México: Atonal Flores, de RFI"], ''Semanario de la [[Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana|UAM]]'' 17.8 (October 11, 2010): 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===University radio===
The first university radio station was Radio [[Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México|UNAM]],&lt;ref name="fmb"/&gt; which broadcast originally on AM, shortwave and FM in Mexico City. It was soon followed by [[XEXQ-AM|XEXQ]], the AM station of the [[Universidad Autónoma de San Luis Potosí]]. While the first university radio stations were on AM, as part of the AM-FM migration and also due to the general growth of noncommercial radio stations in Mexico, many universities have expanded to include FM radio stations. In some cases, such as the [[XHUDG-FM|Universidad de Guadalajara]] and [[XHUSH-FM|Universidad de Sonora]] systems, the stations have become radio networks with expanded coverage and even local optouts.

Private universities also own radio stations, which hold social concessions; the [[Universidad Autónoma de Durango]] (3 stations), [[XHELI-FM|Universidad Vasco de Quiroga]] and [[Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education]] ([[XHTEC-FM]]) are examples of privately owned university radio stations.&lt;ref name="mexico-inf-FM"/&gt;

===Indigenous radio===
The government-owned [[Sistema de Radiodifusoras Culturales Indigenistas]] (System of Indigenous Cultural Broadcasters) owns and operates some 25 AM and FM services offering programming in 31 indigenous languages; the first of these was launched in 1979. Each station is locally staffed by between 8 and 12 people.&lt;ref&gt;José Manuel Ramos Rodríguez, "Indigenous Radio Stations in Mexico: A Catalyst for Social Cohesion and Cultural Strength", ''Radio Journal: International Studies in Broadcast &amp; Audio Media'' December 2005: 155–70.&lt;/ref&gt; The stations offer local programs and public service material and are often the only radio stations with indigenous programming in their respective communities.

The LFTR in 2014 opened the door to indigenous radio stations owned directly by the indigenous communities; as of May 2018, seven indigenous radio stations have been awarded or created as a result of transitions from preexisting permits.

===Community radio===
Community radio was slow to develop in Mexico. During the [[1999 UNAM strike]], a pirate radio station called La Ke Huelga, still in operation, served as the launching pad for people that would later be involved in a variety of community radio stations, including [[XHCD-FM]] in Hermosillo and [[XHECA-FM]] in Amecameca, Estado de México. Some community radio stations were established to serve remote areas, like [[XHHCC-FM]]; others broadcast in indigenous languages, as is the case for [[XHBAK-FM]]. The development of community radio in Mexico has been limited due to harassment by the authorities, crackdowns on pirate radio stations, and the red tape involved in obtaining a permit. The Mexican branch of the [[World Association of Community Radio Broadcasters]], AMARC México, did not manage to obtain permits for community radio stations until 2005; until then, Radio Teocelo was the only permitted community radio station in Mexico.&lt;ref name="conpermiso"&gt;Aleida Calleja and Beatriz Solis, [http://library.fes.de/pdf-files/bueros/mexiko/05371.pdf ''Con permiso: la radio comunitaria en Mexico''], Fundación Friedrich-Ebert: 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Noncommercial stations owned by commercial radio groups===
Some noncommercial stations are related to commercial radio groups. The largest operator of such stations is Grupo Radiofónico ZER, which holds permits for noncommercial radio stations in the Bajío region and in [[XEARZ-AM|Mexico City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Gabriel|last=Sosa Plata|work=El Universal|url=http://blogs.eluniversal.com.mx/wweblogs_detalle.php?p_fecha=2013-07-23&amp;p_id_blog=118&amp;p_id_tema=18801|date=2013-07-23|accessdate=2015-08-16|title=¿De la radio "comercial" a la radio "cultural"?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Culture of the Soviet Union}}
'''All-Union Radio''' ({{Lang-ru|Всесоюзное радио|translit=Vsesoyuznoye radio}}) was the [[radio]] broadcasting organisation for the [[USSR]] under [[Gosteleradio]], operated from 1924 until the [[dissolution of the USSR]]. The organization was based in [[Moscow]].

==History==
===Beginning===
Following the [[October Revolution]] control over radio resources was given to the People’s Commissariat for Posts and Telegraphs. Then, in 1924 it was transferred to a joint-stock company whose members were the Russian Telegraph Agency, a major electric factory, and the PCPT,10 but in 1928 was returned to the People’s Commissariat for Posts and Telegraphs. The first All-Union Radio station, was opened upon [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]]'s initiative (for a "paperless newspaper" as the best means of public information) in November 1924. On November 23, 1924 the first regular broadcast was produced in Moscow on the [[Comintern]] radio station, using the [[ Shukhov radio tower]]. In 1925, the Radio Commission of the Central Committee of the RCP(B) was organized for overall supervision of radio broadcasting. 

On 30 October 1930, from [[Tiraspol]], [[MASSR]], started broadcasting in the [[Romanian language]] a Soviet station of 4 [[Kilowatt|kW]] whose main purpose was the anti-[[Romania]]n propaganda to [[Bessarabia]] between [[Prut]] and [[Dniester]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Rodica Mahu]], [http://www.ziarulring.ro/stiri/8814/radio-moldova-se-revendica-de-la-radio-tiraspol Radio Moldova se revendica de la Radio Tiraspol] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521170957/http://www.ziarulring.ro/stiri/8814/radio-moldova-se-revendica-de-la-radio-tiraspol |date=2013-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context in which a new radio mast, M. Gorky, built in 1936 in Tiraspol, allowed a greater coverage of the territory of [[Moldova]], the [[Romanian Radio Broadcasting Company|Romanian state broadcaster]] started in 1937 to build [[Radio Basarabia]], to counter [[Soviet propaganda]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romania-actualitati.ro/radiofonie_romaneasca_radio_basarabia-35596 Radiofonie românească: Radio Basarabia]&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Cold War]] started, Americans launched the station [[Radio Free Europe]] while Western broadcasts were launched in the [[Eastern bloc]].

===Radio jamming===

Beginning in 1948, the USSR made use of [[radio jamming]] to prevent its citizens from listening to political broadcasts of the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC) and the [[Voice of America]] (VOA) and other western radio programs.&lt;ref name=Woodard53&gt;George W. Woodard, "Cold War Radio Jamming," in A. Ross Johnson and R. Eugene Parta (eds.), ''Cold War Broadcasting: Impact on the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.'' Budapest: Central European University Press, 2010, pg. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Over time this initial effort was escalated dramatically, with the approximately 200 jamming stations with a total between 3 and 4 megawatts of output power in 1952 expanded to about 1,700 transmitters with a combined 45 megawatts of output power.&lt;ref name=Woodard53 /&gt; By this latter date, the list of jammed foreign broadcasts had been expanded to include not only the successors to the BBC and VOA, [[Radio Free Europe]] and [[Radio Liberty]], but also [[Deutsche Welle]], [[Radio Vatican]], [[Kol Israel]], and others.&lt;ref name=Woodard53 /&gt; Total electricity consumed in the course of this jamming operation has been valued at tens of millions of dollars annually, exclusive of site construction and personnel costs.&lt;ref name=Woodard53 /&gt;

Jamming was initially attempted by means of superimposed random speech which mimicked station interference.&lt;ref name=Woodard64&gt;Woodard, "Cold War Radio Jamming," pg. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the ineffectiveness of this method, however, a move was later made to the generation of random noise to obscure human speech.&lt;ref name=Woodard64 /&gt; From the early 1970s, [[satellites]] generating swinging carrier signals were used to interfere even more effectively.&lt;ref name=Woodard64 /&gt;

Nevertheless, people continued (or attempted) to listen to Western broadcasts. In fact, there was even no jamming of these signals   (excluding Radio Free Europe) at all, from 1963-1968{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}, and from 1973-1980{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}. In 1963, a further attempt was made to draw USSR radio listeners from western broadcasts by launching a radio station favouring Moscow city and [[Moscow oblast|oblast]]. The jamming stopped in 1988 (Radio Free Europe was, however, unblocked in August 1991).

===Collapse of the USSR===

As the USSR began to fall in the 1980s, the radio organisation of the USSR began to shut down as private services were introduced and the USSR's stations were relaunched and refocused.

==Stations==
===Domestic===
* [[All Union First Programme]] -the national network of the [[USSR]], focusing on the political and economic life of the Soviet Union. 
* [[Radio Mayak]] - music and speech based entertainment. 
* [[Radio Yunost]] - the station for young people.
* [[Radio Orfey]] - culture, education, classical music.

===International===

{{unreferenced|date=August 2012}}
In [[Programming language|computer programming]], a '''return code''' or an '''error code''' is an enumerated message that corresponds to the status of a specific [[software application]]. They are typically used to identify faults, such as those in faulty [[computer hardware|hardware]], [[software]], or incorrect user input.

==In systems software==

[[Exit status]] is the return code of computer programs running as [[process (computing)|processes]], and is communicated through [[system call]]s.

==In networking software==

[[Network protocol]]s typically support returning status codes. In the [[TCP/IP stack]], it's a common feature of higher level protocols. For example:

* [[List of HTTP status codes]]
* [[List of FTP server return codes]]
* [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol#Protocol overview]]

==Error codes and exception handling==
Error codes are used in various methods of solving the [[semipredicate problem]]. They are generally similar to [[exception handling]] in programming languages that support it.

Error codes are slowly disappearing from the programmer's environment as modern [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] [[programming languages]] replace them with [[Exception handling|exceptions]].{{editorializing|date=April 2017}}{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Exceptions have the advantage of being handled with explicit blocks of code, separate from the rest of the code.  While it is considered poor practice in methodologies that use error codes and return codes to indicate failure, programmers often neglect to check return values for error conditions. That negligence can cause undesirable effects, as ignored error conditions often cause more severe problems later in the program. Exceptions are implemented in such a way as to separate the error handling code from the rest of the code. Separating the error handling code from the normal logic makes programs easier to write and understand, since one block of error handling code can service errors from any number of function calls. Exception handling also makes the code more readable than implementations with error codes, since exception handling does not disrupt the flow of the code with frequent checks for error conditions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="630">In [[Stagecraft|technical theater]], '''spot rigging''' is the practice of using a [[fly system]] to fly something specific for a show which does not use the venue's standard rigging. For example, flying [[Theatrical scenery|scenery]] on an ordinary [[batten]] would not qualify as spot rigging; flying a chandelier on a dedicated line would be. Likewise, if a wall were being flown in on a batten which was installed at an angle neither parallel nor perpendicular to the [[proscenium]] line, it would qualify as spot rigging, because custom setting of lift lines would be required.

'''''Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic''''' (sometimes known simply as '''''Knights of the Old Republic''''' or '''''KOTOR''''') is a [[role-playing video game|role-playing]] [[video game]] set in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' universe. Developed by [[BioWare]] and published by [[LucasArts]], the game was released for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] on July 15, 2003, and for [[Microsoft Windows]] on November 19, 2003. The game was later ported to [[Mac OS X]], [[iOS]], and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] by [[Aspyr]], and it is playable on the [[Xbox 360]] and [[Xbox One]] via their respective backwards-compatibility features.

The story of ''Knights of the Old Republic'' takes place almost 4000 years before the formation of the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]], where [[Darth Malak]], a Dark Lord of the [[Sith]], has unleashed a Sith armada against the [[Galactic Republic|Republic]]. The player character, as a [[Jedi]], must venture to different planets in the galaxy in order to defeat Malak. Players choose from three character classes and customize their characters at the beginning of the game, and engage in round-based combat against enemies. Through interacting with other characters and making plot decisions, the alignment system will determine whether the player's character aligns with the light or dark side of [[the Force]].

The game was directed by [[Casey Hudson]], designed by [[James Ohlen]], and written by [[Drew Karpyshyn]]. LucasArts proposed developing a game tied to ''[[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones]]'', or a game set thousands of years before the prequels. The team chose the latter as they thought that they would have more creative freedom. [[Ed Asner]], [[Ethan Phillips]], and [[Jennifer Hale]] were hired to perform voices for the game's characters, while the soundtrack was composed by [[Jeremy Soule]]. Announced in 2000, the game was delayed several times before its release in July 2003.

The game received critical acclaim upon release, with critics applauding the game's characters, story, and sound. It was nominated for numerous awards, and is considered one of the [[List of video games considered the best|best games ever made]]. A sequel, ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II – The Sith Lords]]'', developed by [[Obsidian Entertainment]] at BioWare's suggestion, was released in 2004. The [[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (series)|series]]' story continued with the 2011 release of ''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'', a [[MMORPG]] developed by BioWare.

==Gameplay==
Players choose from three basic [[character class]]es at the beginning of the game, and later choose from three Jedi subclasses. Beyond class, a character has "skills" stats, [[skill tree|tiered]] "feats", and later on, tiered [[the Force|Force]] powers, similar to magic spells in fantasy games. Feats and Force powers are generally unlocked upon [[Experience level|level-up]], while the player is given skill points to distribute among their skills every level.

Combat is round-based; time is divided into discrete rounds, and combatants attack and react simultaneously, although these actions are presented sequentially on-screen. The number of actions a combatant may perform each round is limited. While each round's duration is a fixed short interval of real time, the player can configure the combat system to pause at specific events or at the end of each round, or set the combat system to never automatically pause, giving the illusion of real-time combat. Combat actions are calculated using DnD rules, particularly [[d20 System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/299385/Classic_Postmortem_BioWares_Star_Wars_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic.php|title=Classic Postmortem: BioWare's Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic | author= | date=July 14, 2017 |work=[[Gamasutra]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; While these are not displayed directly on the screen, the full breakdown for each action (including die rolls and modifiers) is accessible from a menu.

For much of the game, the player can have up to two companions in their [[Party (role-playing games)|party]]. These companions will participate in combat. They can be manually controlled by the player, or act autonomously if the player does not give them any input. Outside of combat, the companions will randomly engage the player or each other in dialogue, sometimes unlocking additional quests. They will also participate in conversations the player has with other [[non-player characters]].

Non-combat interaction with other characters in the game world is based upon a dialogue menu system. Following each statement, the player can select from a list of menu responses. The dialogue varies based on the gender and skills of the main character.

The alignment system tracks actions and speech—from simple word choices to major plot decisions—to determine whether the player's character aligns with the light or dark side of [[the Force]] . Generosity and altruism lead to the light side, while selfish or violent actions will lead the player's character to the dark side, which will alter the character's appearance, turning their eyes yellow and their skin pale.

In addition to the standard role-playing gameplay, there are several minigame events that come up over the course of the game. The player can participate in swoop racing to earn money, and sometimes interplanetary travel will be interrupted by enemy starfighters, which begins a minigame where the player controls a turret to shoot down the opposing starcraft. The player can also engage in a card game known as pazaak, which is similar to the game of [[blackjack]], to gamble money.

==Story==
The story takes place approximately 4,000 years before the rise of the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]]. [[Darth Malak]], a former [[Jedi]], Dark Lord of the [[Sith]] and [[Revan|Darth Revan]]'s former apprentice, has unleashed a Sith armada against the [[Galactic Republic|Republic]]. Malak's aggression has left the Jedi scattered and vulnerable; many Jedi Knights have fallen in battle and others have sworn allegiance to Malak.

The game opens with the player's character—the player can choose a face and be male or female (canonically a male&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The New Essential Chronology to Star Wars|first=Daniel|last=Wallace|isbn=978-0-345-44901-6|date=October 25, 2005|publisher=[[Del Rey Books|Del Rey]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;)—awakening aboard a Republic ship, the ''Endar Spire'', which is under attack by Malak's forces over the city world of Taris. Republic soldier Trask Ulgo soon arrives and informs the player character that they are under attack. Fighting their way to the escape pods, Trask and the player character are soon confronted by Sith Lord Darth Bandon. With no other options, Trask sacrifices himself while the player continues to make their way to the escape pods. The player character soon meets up with Carth Onasi, a skilled pilot and Republic war hero, and they escape the doomed warship.

Crashing on the surface of Taris, the player character is knocked unconscious and Carth pulls them away from the wreckage. After suffering a strange vision, the player character awakens in an abandoned apartment with Carth, who explains that Taris is currently under martial law by Malak's forces who are currently searching for the Jedi Knight [[Bastila Shan]], known for her mastery of battle meditation, a Force technique which strengthens one's allies and weakens one's enemies during battle. Carth and the player character go in search of her and manage to meet new companions along the way, such as the Twi'lek street urchin Mission Vao and her Wookiee companion Zaalbar. The group eventually finds and rescues Bastila from the Black Vulkar gang. With the help of utility droid T3-M4 and Mandalorian mercenary Canderous Ordo, the group escapes Taris aboard the ''Ebon Hawk'', moments before the planet surface is decimated by Malak's fleet in a vain effort to kill Bastila.

While taking refuge at the Jedi Academy on Dantooine, the player's character trains to be a Jedi, discovers a "Star Map", and learns of the "Star Forge", the probable source of Malak's military resources. The player's character and their companions search planets across the galaxy—[[Dantooine]], Manaan, [[Tatooine]], [[Kashyyyk]], and Korriban—for more information about the Star Forge, gaining new companions along the way such as the Cathar Jedi Juhani, assassin droid HK-47, and 'Grey' Jedi Jolee Bindo. Through the course of their travels, the player will eventually discover their character's true identity—the brainwashed Darth Revan, whom the Jedi Council on Dantooine took in and subjected to memory modification so that he would no longer be a threat to the galaxy, the various visions they had been experiencing being Revan's memories. Darth Revan had been injured when attacking a Republic planet because Darth Malak turned his ship's guns on his former master, intent on usurping him. Because Bastila was aboard Revan's ship with a Jedi strike force, she was able to heal him and bring him to the Jedi Council on Dantooine. Her actions lead to the force bond between her and Revan, which plays a role later in the game.

Depending on the character's alignment, upon ultimately reaching the Star Forge they either defeat the Sith (the light-side path) or usurp control from Malak (the dark-side path). A light-aligned character is hailed as a savior and hero; a dark-side character stands before the remaining Sith forces as the new Dark Lord of the Sith.

===Characters and locations===
{{Further|List of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic characters}}
Eventually joining the main character's quest are veteran Republic pilot [[Carth Onasi]], the [[Twi'lek]] teenager Mission Vao and her [[Wookiee]] companion Zaalbar, the [[Jedi]] [[Bastila Shan]], 'Grey' Jedi Jolee Bindo, utility droid T3-M4, Mandalorian mercenary Canderous Ordo, and assassin [[droid (Star Wars)|droid]] [[HK-47]] if he is bought. Juhani, another Jedi, may also join the party if she is not killed fighting the main character. Several of these characters, including Canderous Ordo, HK-47 and T3-M4, also appear in the sequel, ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II&amp;nbsp;– The Sith Lords]]''. Republic soldier Trask Ulgo is also playable briefly on the ''Endar Spire''. Antagonists include Black Vulkar gang leader Brejik, crime boss Davik Kang, bounty hunter Calo Nord, Zaalbar's twisted brother Chuundar, Malak's Sith apprentice Darth Bandon, Sith Admiral Saul Karath, Sith Overseer Uthar Wynn, Rakatan tribe leader The One, and Darth Malak, the Dark Lord of the Sith. On several planets the main character deals with Czerka Corporation, a company operating on several planets that allied itself with the Sith, engaged in slave trade and other nefarious practices. Major allies that help the player's party along the way are Hidden Bek gang leader Gadon Thek, Jedi Masters Vandar Tokare and Zhar Lestin, game hunter Komad Fortuna, Zaalbar and Chuundar's father Freyyr, Uthar's Sith apprentice Yuthura Ban, Republic representative Roland Wann, the Rakatan tribe "The Elders", and Republic Admiral Forn Dodonna.

Action takes place on the planets [[Tatooine]], Dantooine, [[Kashyyyk]], Korriban, Manaan, Rakata Prime, and Taris; aboard the Republic cruiser ''Endar Spire'' and Saul Karath's ship ''Leviathan''; and on the Star Forge space station. A space station near Yavin is a playable location in the PC, Mac OS X, and mobile versions of the game and is available to Xbox players via download from [[Xbox Live]]. Travel between these locations happens aboard the freighter ''[[Ebon Hawk]]'', which is also a playable location.

==Production==

===Development===
In July 2000, [[BioWare]] announced that they were working with [[LucasArts]] to create a Star Wars [[role-playing video game]] for the [[personal computer|PC]] and [[History of video game consoles (sixth generation)|next-generation consoles]].&lt;ref name=IGN_first&gt;{{cite web | last = IGN staff | url = http://pc.ign.com/articles/082/082553p1.html | title = Star Wars RPG Announced | work = [[IGN]] | accessdate = July 5, 2009 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071018204940/http://pc.ign.com/articles/082/082553p1.html | archivedate = October 18, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Joint BioWare [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] Greg Zeschuk commented that "The opportunity to create a richly detailed new chapter in the Star Wars universe is incredibly exciting for us. We are honored to be working with the extremely talented folks at Lucas Arts, developing a role-playing game based upon one of the most high-profile [[license]]s in the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = IGN staff | url = http://ps2.ign.com/articles/082/082574p1.html | title = First-Ever Star Wars RPG | work = [[IGN]] | accessdate = July 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was officially unveiled as ''Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic'' at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3 2001]]. At this point, the game had been in development for around six months.&lt;ref name="GS-E3-01"&gt;{{cite web | last = Ajami | first = Amer | url = http://gamespot.com/pc/rpg/starwarsknightsoftor/news.html?sid=2762052&amp;mode=all | title = E3 2001: LucasArts unveils BioWare RPG | work = [[GameSpot]] | accessdate = July 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Pre-production|Preproduction]] started in 2000, but the discussions started back in 1999," LucasArts' Mike Gallo said, "The first actual [[e-mail]]s were in October or November of '99. That's when we first started talking to BioWare. But some really serious work finally started at the beginning of 2000."&lt;ref name = GS_Mar02_Q&amp;A&gt;{{cite web | last = GameSpot staff | url = http://gamespot.com/xbox/rpg/starwarsknightsoftor/news.html?sid=2852907&amp;mode=all | title = Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic Q&amp;A (Mar 6, 2002) | work = [[GameSpot]] | accessdate = July 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{rquote|right|The thing that seems to stand out is that the current game is almost exactly what we envisioned almost three years ago.|Project director Casey Hudson in April 2003&lt;ref name = CVG_Apr_03&gt;{{cite web | last = Bishop | first = Stuart | url = http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=90074 | title = Interview: Knights fever | work = [[ComputerAndVideoGames.com]]| accessdate = July 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The decision to set the game four thousand years before ''[[Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace]]'' was one of the first details about the game made known.&lt;ref name = IGN_first /&gt; LucasArts gave BioWare a choice of settings for the game. "LucasArts came to us and said that we could do an [[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones|Episode II]] game," BioWare CEO Raymond Muzyka said. "Or LucasArts said we could go 4,000 years back, which is a period that's hardly been covered before."&lt;ref name = CVG_Nov02_Interview /&gt; BioWare chose to set the game four thousand years before the films as it gave them greater creative freedom.&lt;ref name = CVG_Nov02_Interview /&gt; They aimed to create content similar to that from the films but different enough to be a definite precursor.&lt;ref name = GS_Oct03_Q&amp;A&gt;{{cite web | last = GameSpot staff | url = http://gamespot.com/pc/rpg/starwarsknightsoftor/news.html?sid=6077401&amp;mode=all | title = Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Q&amp;A (Oct 28, 2003) | work = [[GameSpot]] | accessdate = July 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concept work had to be sent to [[Skywalker Ranch|"the ranch"]] to be approved for use. Muzyka noted that very little of their content was rejected: "It was more like, 'Can you just make his head like this rather than like that.' So it was all very feasible. There were good suggestions made and they made the game better, so we were happy to do them. It was a good process really and I think we were pleasantly surprised how easy LucasArts was to work with."&lt;ref name = CVG_Nov02_Interview&gt;{{cite web | last = Bishop | first = Stuart | url = http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=83466 | title = Interview: Bump in the Old Republic Knights | work = [[ComputerAndVideoGames.com]] | accessdate = July 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zeschuk said that "Overall, we were really happy with the results. We felt like we had enough freedom to truly create something wonderful."&lt;ref name = GS_Oct03_Q&amp;A /&gt;

Gallo said that BioWare and LucasArts were aiming for a gameplay time of around sixty hours: "''[[Baldur's Gate]]'' was 100 hours of gameplay or more. ''[[Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn|Baldur's Gate 2]]'' was 200 hours, and the critical-path play through ''Baldur's Gate 2'' was 75 hours... We're talking smaller than that [for ''Knights of the Old Republic''], dramatically, but even if it's 60 percent smaller, then it's still 100 hours. So our goal for gameplay time is 60 hours. We have so many areas that we're building--worlds, spaceships, things like that to explore--so we have a ton of gameplay."&lt;ref name = GS_Mar02_Q&amp;A /&gt;

Project director Casey Hudson said that one of the greatest achievements and one of the greatest risks was the combat system. "We wanted to create something that combined the strategic aspects of our ''Baldur's Gate'' series and ''[[Neverwinter Nights]]'' but which presented it through fast, cinematic 3D action," Hudson said. "That required us to make something that hadn't really been done before."&lt;ref name = GS_Oct03_Q&amp;A /&gt; The developers intended to make the game have more open-ended gameplay. Gallo compared some situations to ''[[Deus Ex (video game)|Deus Ex]]'': "You have several ways to get through an area and you might need a character who has a specific skill to do that."&lt;ref name = GS_Mar02_Q&amp;A /&gt;

===Technical===
LucasArts and BioWare settled on developing ''Knights of the Old Republic'' for the PC and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]]. The Xbox was chosen over other consoles because of BioWare's background of developing PC games and greater familiarity with the Xbox than other consoles: "We could do the things we wanted to do on the Xbox without as much effort as we'd need to do it on the [[PlayStation 2|PS2]] or [[Nintendo GameCube|GameCube]]," Gallo said.&lt;ref name = GS_Mar02_Q&amp;A /&gt; Other factors included the console's recent success and the opportunity to release one of the Xbox's first RPGs.&lt;ref name = GS_Mar02_Q&amp;A /&gt; BioWare had previously developed ''[[MDK2]]'' for the [[Dreamcast]] and PlayStation 2. Hudson said that "Having experience in developing for other consoles gave us the proper mindset for implementing this game on the Xbox, and, by comparison, the Xbox was relatively easy to develop for."&lt;ref name = GS_Oct03_Q&amp;A /&gt;

Hudson did, however, note that there were some challenges during development. One of the difficulties was in deciding how much graphical detail to provide. "Since our games generally have a lot of AI and scripting, numerous character models, and huge environments, we stress the hardware in a very different way than most games," Hudson said.&lt;ref name = GS_Oct03_Q&amp;A /&gt; This made it difficult to predict how well the game would run.&lt;ref name = GS_Oct03_Q&amp;A /&gt; The game uses the [[Odyssey Engine]], based on the [[Aurora Engine]] (previously developed by BioWare for use in ''[[Neverwinter Nights]]'') but completely rewritten for ''Knights of the Old Republic''.&lt;ref name = GS_Mar02_Q&amp;A /&gt; It was highly detailed for its time: grass waves in the wind, dust blows across [[Tatooine]] and puffs of sand rise as the player walks across the seabed.&lt;ref name = CVG_Nov02_Interview /&gt;

Hudson noted that the differences between consoles and PCs mean that the graphics would have to be modified. "You typically play console games on a TV across the room while PC games are played on a monitor only inches away."&lt;ref name = GS_Oct03_Q&amp;A /&gt; Console games put effort into close-up action and overall render quality; PC games emphasize what can be done with high resolutions and super-sharp textures. Hudson also noted that the difference between a game controller and mouse-and-keyboard setup influenced some design decisions.&lt;ref name = GS_Oct03_Q&amp;A /&gt; The PC version features an extra location the player can visit and more NPCs, items and weapons; these additions were later made available on the Xbox version through [[Xbox Live]]. The PC version supports higher display resolutions (up to 1600x1200) and has higher-resolution textures.&lt;ref name = CVG_Oct_03&gt;{{cite web | last = Bishop | first = Stuart | url = http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=97355 | title = Interview: Bioware's PC Knights exposed! | work = [[ComputerAndVideoGames.com]]| accessdate = August 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sound===
While the main game, graphics engine and story were developed by BioWare, LucasArts worked on the game's audio.&lt;ref name = GS_Mar02_Q&amp;A /&gt; ''Knights of the Old Republic'' contains three hundred different characters and fifteen thousand lines of speech. "One complete copy of the ''Knights of the Old Republic'' script fills up 10 5-inch binders," voice department manager Darragh O'Farrell noted.&lt;ref name = GS_Apr03_Q&amp;A /&gt; A cast of around a hundred voice actors, including [[Edward Asner|Ed Asner]], [[Raphael Sbarge]], [[Ethan Phillips]], [[Jennifer Hale]], and [[Phil LaMarr]] was assembled. "Fortunately, with a game this size, it's easy to have an actor play a few different characters and scatter those parts throughout the game so you'll never notice it's the same actor you heard earlier," O'Farrell said.&lt;ref name = GS_Apr03_Q&amp;A&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | url = http://gamespot.com/xbox/rpg/starwarsknightsoftor/news.html?sid=6025565&amp;mode=all | title = Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Q&amp;A (Apr 23, 2003) | work = [[GameSpot]] | accessdate = July 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voice production started six months before the game's [[Beta test|beta]] release. The voice production team were given the script 90% complete to work with. "There were a few changes made during recording, but most of the remaining 10 percent will be dealt with in our pickup session," O'Farrell said, "The pickup session is right at the end of the project, where we catch performance issues, tutorial lines, verbal hints, and anything else that we might have overlooked."&lt;ref name = GS_Apr03_Q&amp;A /&gt; A game the size of ''Knights of the Old Republic'' would typically take seven weeks to record; two weeks of recording all-day and all-night meant LucasArts were able to record all voices in five weeks. Actors were recorded one at a time, as the non-linear nature of the game meant it was too complicated and expensive to record more than one actor at a time.&lt;ref name = GS_Apr03_Q&amp;A /&gt;

Most of the dialogue recorded was spoken in [[Galactic Basic]] (represented by [[English language|English]]); however, around a tenth of the script was written in [[Languages in Star Wars#Huttese|Huttese]]. Mike Gallo used [[Ben Burtt]]'s ''Star Wars: Galactic Phrase Book &amp; Travel Guide'' to translate English into Huttese. "The key to recording alien dialogue is casting the right actor for the part," O'Farrell said, "Over the years I've had actors take to Huttese like a fish to water, but the opposite is also true. In the past I've had to line-read (when an actor copies my performance) 150-plus Huttese lines to an actor in order to make it work."&lt;ref name = GS_Apr03_Q&amp;A /&gt;

Award-winning composer [[Jeremy Soule]] was signed to compose the game's score.&lt;ref name = Soule&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.music4games.net/Features_Display.aspx?id=145 | title = Interview with composer Jeremy Soule at PLAY! San Jose | work = Music 4 Games | accessdate = July 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; "It will be a ''Star Wars'' score, but it will all be original, and probably the things that will remain will be [[Star Wars music#First appearance in Episode IV|the Force themes]] and things like that," Gallo said.&lt;ref name = GS_Mar02_Q&amp;A /&gt; Soule was unable to write a full orchestral score for ''Knights of the Old Republic'' due to technical limitations: "At the time we only had an 8 [[megabit]] per second [[MIDI]] system. That was state of the art... I had to fool people into thinking they were hearing a full orchestra. I’d write [[woodwind]]s and [[drum]]s, or woodwinds, [[French horn|horn]]s and drums, or [[string section|strings]] and drums and [[brass instrument|brass]]. I couldn’t run the whole orchestra at once, it was impossible."&lt;ref name = Soule /&gt;

===Release===
When announced at E3 2001, ''Knights of the Old Republic'' was originally scheduled for a late 2002 release.&lt;ref name="GS-E3-01" /&gt; In August 2002 it was announced on the game's forums that its release had been delayed: the Xbox version was to be released in spring 2003 and the PC version in summer 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Parker | first = Sam | url = http://gamespot.com/pc/rpg/starwarsknightsoftor/news.html?sid=2877085&amp;mode=all | title = Knights of the Old Republic delayed| work = [[GameSpot]]| accessdate = August 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further delay was announced in January 2003, with both versions of the game expected to be released in fall 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Sulic| first = Ivan| url = http://pc.ign.com/articles/384/384147p1.html| title = The Republic Gets Older| work = [[IGN]]| accessdate = August 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zeschuk attributed the delay to BioWare's focus on quality: "Our goal is to always deliver a top-notch gameplay experience, and sometimes it can be very difficult to excel in all areas. We keep working on tackling each individual issue until we feel we've accomplished something special."&lt;ref name = GS_Oct03_Q&amp;A /&gt;

The Xbox version of ''Knights of the Old Republic'' [[Going gold|went gold]] on July 9, 2003 with a release date of July 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Parker | first = Sam | url = http://gamespot.com/xbox/rpg/starwarsknightsoftor/news.html?sid=6071224&amp;mode=all| title = Knights of the Old Republic goes gold| work = [[GameSpot]]| accessdate = August 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It sold 250,000 copies in the first four days of its release, making ''Knights of the Old Republic'' the fastest-selling Xbox title at the time of its release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | url = http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=94652| title = KOTOR breaks sales record on Xbox| work = [[ComputerAndVideoGames.com]]| accessdate = August 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the game's release, it was announced that free downloadable content would be available through Xbox Live at the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | url = http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=94319| title = KOTOR Xbox live downloads - new details| work = [[ComputerAndVideoGames.com]]| accessdate = August 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PC version of the game went gold on November 11, 2003 and was released on November 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Thorsen | first = Tor| url = http://gamespot.com/pc/rpg/starwarsknightsoftor/news.html?sid=6081750&amp;mode=all| title = PC Knights of the Old Republic golden| work = [[GameSpot]]| accessdate = August 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was re-released as part of the ''[[Star Wars: The Best of PC]]'' collection in 2006.&lt;ref name="best-pc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/jediknight2jedioutcast/news.html?sid=6161767 |last=Sinclair |first=Brendan |title=Star Wars gets bundled |work=GameSpot |accessdate=June 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was released on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] on May 14, 2012 for Mac OS X. The game was released for the iPad on May 30, 2013. The iPad version includes the Yavin Station DLC that was previously released for Xbox and PC.

The game was also launched on Android's Google Play Store on December 22, 2014.

In October 2017, Microsoft made the [[Xbox One]] console backward compatible with the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] version of the game, as part of a 13-game curated catalog.

A typical stump speech consisted of [[malapropisms]] (the substitution of a word for a word with a similar sound), [[nonsense]] sentences, and [[pun]]s delivered in a parodied version of [[African American Vernacular English|Black Vernacular English]]. The stump speaker wore blackface makeup and moved about like a clown. Topics varied from pure nonsense to parodies of politics, science, and social issues. Although both the topic itself and the black character's inability to comprehend it served as sources of comedy, minstrels used such speeches to deliver social commentary that might be considered taboo in another setting. The stump speech was an important precursor to modern [[stand-up comedy]].

==Performance==
The stump speech was usually the highlight of the ''olio'', the minstrel show's second act. The stump speaker, typically one of the buffoonish endmen known as ''[[tambourine|Tambo]]'' and ''[[bones (instrument)|Bones]]'', mounted some sort of platform and delivered the oration in an exaggerated parody of [[African American Vernacular English|Black Vernacular English]] that hearkened to the [[Yankee]] and [[frontiersman]] stage dialects from the theatre of the period.&lt;ref name="Watkins 92"&gt;Watkins 92.&lt;/ref&gt; The speech consisted of a barrage of [[malapropism]]s, [[non sequitur (absurdism)|non sequiturs]], [[pun]]s, and [[nonsense]]. The stump speaker gestured wildly, contorted his body, and usually fell off his stump at some point.&lt;ref&gt;Toll, ''Blacking Up'', 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Speakers often took on the persona of popular minstrel show characters, such as the black [[dandy]] [[Zip Coon]].&lt;ref&gt;McWilliams 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his guide to staging a minstrel show, Charles Townsend offers this advice: &lt;blockquote&gt;''Stump Speeches'' are always very popular, if original in thought, and well delivered. …In delivering a stump speech, let your costume be as comical as possible. If you are tall, wear a tight fitting suit, which will make you appear taller yet. On the contrary, if you are short and stout, emphasize it by wearing very loose clothing. Some stump speakers come on in a ragged suit and damaged "plug" hat, carrying an old-fashioned valise and huge umbrella. A negro stump speech, being only a [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]], admits of any peculiarities you may choose to introduce.&lt;ref&gt;Townsend 122–3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Content==
The content of the stump speech varied widely. Some were pure nonsense, such as [[Richard Pelham]]'s "A Brief Battering at the Blues". Historian Robert Toll offers this excerpt as typical of the type:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Feller-feller and oder fellers, when [[Joan of Arc|Joan of Ark]] and his broder [[Noah's Ark]] [[crossing the Rubicon|crossed de Rubicund]] in search of [[Decameron|Decamoran]]'s horn, and meeting dat solitary horseman by de way, dey anapulated in de clarion tones of de clamurous rooster, de insignificition of de — de — de — [[Camptown Races|de hop-toad am a very big bird — du da — du da day]] — does it not prove dat where gold is up to a discount of two cups of coffee on de dollar, dat bolivers must fall back into de radience of de-de — anything else, derefore, at once and exclusively proving de fact dat de afore-mentioned accounts for de milk in de cocoa-nut!&lt;ref&gt;Marc 28, quoting Toll, ''Blacking Up''. Spelling and punctuation as in the original.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Listen|filename=A Meeting of the Limkiln Club.ogg|title="A Meeting of the Limkiln Club"|description=A blackface stump speech by the [[American Quartet (ensemble)|American Quartet]], 1902|format=[[Ogg]]}}
Other stump speeches were send-ups of science or philosophy that parodied the [[Lyceum movement|lyceum lectures]] popular with the educated middle class in the 1850s.&lt;ref&gt;Butsch 85.&lt;/ref&gt;  One example was [[Billy Whitlock]]'s "Locomotive Lecture", a comical look at the [[steam engine]]. Others satirized political and social issues such as [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]] or [[public education]]. For example, [[Frank Brower]] of the [[Virginia Minstrels]] delivered a "Definition of the Bankrupt Laws".&lt;ref&gt;Nathan 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the [[American Civil War]], [[women's rights]] was a popular target of the stump speech's ridicule. The women's rights lecture became a standard part of the repertoire for many troupes, who joked about women being interested in "polytick" only because "de majority ob em am strongly tached to parties."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Toll, ''Blacking Up'', 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Another speech claimed that

&lt;blockquote&gt;There hev bin women in the world who hev done suthin'. There wuz the Queen of Sheba, who was eggselled only by Solomon, and all that surprised her in him wuz that he could support 3,000 women. ...And there was [[Joan of Arc]], who whipped the English, who was maid of New Orleans, which wuzn't the same as [[Noah's Ark]], for that was ''made'' of gopher wood, besides the latter was pitched without and pitched within. There wuz Queen Elizabeth, who wuz the virgin queen; and [[Jane Grey Swisshelm|Mrs. Swisshelm]]; there's [[Lucy Stone]], and [[Anna Dickinson]]; there's [[Lucretia Mott]], and Mrs. Jinks, all uv whom showed thet women cood seese to be women, and be ez neer to men ez nacher allowed them. Thet's what all our sex want—to be ez neer men ez possible.&lt;ref&gt;"Speech on Women's Rights", 136–7. Spelling and punctuation as in original.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] period, black Congressmen became a popular subject, portrayed as bumblers whose incompetence prevented them from posing any threat to the white-dominated government.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Stump speeches not only poked fun at these topics but also at the caricatured black speakers' ability to understand them.&lt;ref name="Watkins 92"/&gt; Nevertheless, the blackface makeup acted as a [[jester|fool]]'s mask, allowing minstrels to discuss topics that might otherwise be taboo.&lt;ref&gt;Toll, ''Blacking Up'', 161.&lt;/ref&gt; Many troupes developed stump specialists who were well known for covering specific material. For example, [[Eph Horn]] was known for his women's rights lecture.&lt;ref&gt;Toll, "Commentary", 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

The stump speech is one important antecedent of modern [[stand-up comedy]]. The double-talk of Professor [[Irwin Corey]], [[Norm Crosby]], and [[Al Kelly]] originated there.&lt;ref&gt;Marc 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Such performances influenced print media as well, as exemplified by the dialect essays and editorials that appeared in American newspapers such as the ''[[New York Clipper]]'' in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;McWilliams 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6602">{{DISPLAYTITLE:Supplements to the ''Satyricon''}}
[[Petronius]]'s ''[[Satyricon]]'', the only extant realistic classical Latin novel (probably written c. AD 60), survives in a very fragmentary form. Many readers have wondered how the story would begin and end.

Between 1629 and the present several authors in various languages have attempted to round the story out. In certain cases, following a well-known conceit of historical fiction, these invented supplements have been claimed to derive from newly discovered manuscripts.

==José Antonio González de Salas, 1629==

[[:la:Josephus Antonius Gonsali de Salas|José Antonio González de Salas]] (born 1588, died 1654) published an edition of the ''Satyricon'' in 1629; it was reissued in 1643 with a portrait. It included linking passages (in Latin) which de Salas claimed to have taken from an earlier Paris edition, but this does not exist. It is assumed that he invented them. The only English translation including these passages is by [[W. C. Firebaugh]].

* W. C. Firebaugh, 1922, ''Petronius: Satyricon''. [http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/gutbook/lookup?num=5225 Available online.]

==François Nodot, 1693==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Pieter Burmann the Elder]] --&gt;

In October, 1690, [[François Nodot]], a French writer and [[mercenary soldier]], announced a remarkable discovery to the French academies. A certain Du Pin, a French officer, had been present at the [[Siege of Belgrade (1688)|sack of Belgrade]] in 1688 and came across a manuscript, a copy of which he had sent to Nodot. It proved to contain supplements to the known text of the ''Satyricon''. Nodot's claims were initially accepted and the supplements were thought to be genuine. They were published as such in 1693, but soon gave rise to suspicion. They were conclusively shown to be spurious by [[Pieter Burmann the Elder]] (whose Latin edition of Petronius appeared in 1709), yet they were sometimes printed in editions of the real fragments down to the early 20th century. They were translated into English by [[William Burnaby]] in 1694, into French by Héguin de Guerle, and into various other languages; translations incorporating the Nodot supplements continued to appear in print until the early 20th century. They are currently included (in English) in at least three online versions of the ''Satyricon''.

==José Marchena, 1800==

[[José Marchena Ruiz de Cueto]], a Spaniard, was at [[Basle]] in 1800, attached to the staff of the French general [[Jean Victor Marie Moreau|Moreau]]. In his spare time he wrote scholarly notes on ancient sexuality, and eventually constructed a supplement to Petronius which illustrated his researches. He translated the fragment into French, attached the notes, and published the book as ''Fragmentum Petronii'' (Paris? 1800), claiming that the fragment was by Petronius and the translation and notes were by a certain "Lallemand", a Doctor of Theology. In Marchena's preface, dedicated to the Napoleonic Army of the Rhine, he states that he found the fragment in a manuscript of the work of Saint Gennadios on the Duties of Priests; close examination had revealed that it was a palimpsest and that this fragment formed the underlying text.

According to [[Stephen Gaselee (diplomat)|Stephen Gaselee]] "in every line it has exactly the Petronian turn of phrase." An English translation of both text and notes is included in Firebaugh's translation of the ''Satyricon''. The Latin text of the fragment, very rare in its original edition, is included in the 1854 W. K. Kelly translation of the ''Satyricon''.

H. C. Schnur's German translation of the ''Satyricon'', published in 1968, includes an original supplement to the story written by the translator.

==Ellery David Nest, 2003==

In a self-published volume, Ellery David Nest has devised new episodes that immediately precede the opening of the real text of the ''Satyricon''. Elaborate fictional claims are made concerning the origin of these episodes, which are said to derive from a manuscript found at Morazla by Reinhardt Struch of Oberhausen University, by way of a Latin edition by David S. Johnson, ''The New Satyricon: The Recovered Books'' (Monticello Park Press). In the blurb, Nest is said to be Professor Emeritus at Carlboro State University in East Manchester, and to have held positions at the University of Osnanich in ancient language studies, and at the Steed Road College as director of the Latin Scholars group. All these names and places, apparently including the name of Nest himself, are fictional.

[[Image:Noises Off Set Front.jpg|thumb|right|Modern-day rotating set for the play ''[[Noises Off]]''.]]
'''Theatrical scenery''' is that which is used as a setting for a [[theatrical]] production. Scenery may be just about anything, from a single chair to an elaborately re-created street, no matter how large or how small, whether the item was custom-made or is the genuine item, appropriated for theatrical use.

==History==
The history of theatrical scenery is as old as the [[theatre]] itself, and just as obtuse and tradition bound. What we tend to think of as 'traditional scenery', i.e. two-dimensional [[canvas]]-covered '[[Flats (theatre)|flat]]s' painted to resemble a [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] surface or vista, is a relatively recent innovation and a significant departure from the more ancient forms of theatrical expression, which tended to rely less on the actual representation of space senerial and more on the conveyance of action and mood. By the [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]an era, the occasional painted backdrop or theatrical prop was in evidence, but the show itself was written so as not to rely on such items to convey itself to the [[audience]]. However, this means that today's set designers must be that much more careful, so as to convey the setting without taking away from the actors.

==Contemporary scenery==
[[File:Marcel Jambon - Giuseppe Verdi - Otello Act I set design model.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|1895 set design model by Marcel Jambon for Act I of [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[Otello]]'' for a production in Paris.]]
Our more modern notion of scenery, which dates back to the 19th century, finds its origins in the dramatic spectacle of ''[[opera buffa]]'', from which the modern opera is descended. Its elaborate settings were appropriated by the 'straight', or dramatic, theatre, through their use in comic operettas, burlesques, pantomimes and the like. As time progressed, stage settings grew more realistic, reaching their peak in the [[David Belasco|Belasco realism]] of the 1910-'20s, in which complete diners, with working soda fountains and freshly made food, were recreated [[Parts of a theatre#Stage|onstage]]. Perhaps as a reaction to such excess and in parallel with trends in the arts and [[architecture]], scenery began a trend towards abstraction, although realistic settings remained in evidence, and are still used today. At the same time, the musical theatre was evolving its own set of scenic traditions, borrowing heavily from the [[American burlesque|burlesque]] and [[vaudeville]] style, with occasional nods to the trends of the 'straight' theatre. Everything came together in the 1980s and 1990s and, continuing to today, until there is no established style of scenic production and pretty much anything goes. Modern [[stagecraft]] has grown so complex as to require the highly specialized skills of hundreds of artists and craftspeople to mount a single production.

==Types of scenery==
The construction of theatrical scenery is frequently one of the most time-consuming tasks when preparing for a show. As a result, many theatres have a place for storing scenery (such as a [[loft]]) so that it can be used for multiple shows. Since future shows typically are not known far in advance, theatres will often construct stock scenery that can be easily adapted to fit a variety of shows. Common stock scenery types include:
* [[Theater drapes and stage curtains|Curtains]]
* [[Flats (theatre)|Flats]]
* [[Platform (theatre)|Platforms]]
* [[Scenery wagon]]s

[[File:Video_check_from_Airman.jpg|thumb|[[U.S. Air Force]] [[Airman]] Daniel Johnson performs a function check on his video camera before shooting.]] 
A '''videographer''' is a person who works in the field of [[videography]] and/or [[video production]], recording moving images and sound on [[video tape]], digital, or any future [[data storage medium]], disk, other electro-mechanical device.  [[News broadcasting]] relies heavily on [[live television]] where videographers engage in [[electronic news gathering]] (ENG) of [[local news]] stories.

==Overview==
On a set, in a [[television studio]], the videographer is usually a [[camera operator]] of a [[professional video camera]], sound, and lighting. As part of a typical [[electronic field production]] (EFP) [[television crew]], videographers usually work with a [[television producer]].  However, for smaller productions (e.g. corporate and [[event videography]]), a videographer often works alone with a [[single-camera setup]] or in the case of a [[multiple-camera setup]], as part of a larger [[television crew]] with [[lighting technician]], [[Grip (job)|grips]] and [[sound operator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://work.chron.com/videographer-job-description-6725.html work.chron.com, videographer]&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, videographers are distinguished from [[cinematographer]]s in that they use digital hard-drive, flash cards or tape drive video cameras vs. 70mm [[IMAX]], 35mm, 16mm or Super 8mm mechanical film cameras. Videographers manage smaller, event scale productions (commercials, documentaries, legal depositions, live events, short films, training videos, [[Wedding videography|weddings]]), differing from individualized large production team members. The advent of high definition digital video cameras, however, has blurred this distinction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://promo.unm.edu/the-internships/position-descriptions/videographer.html unm.edu,  The University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, Videographer ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, it is becoming more and more common for people to talk about "filming" with a [[camcorder]] even though no "film" is involved.  Similarly, the term "taping" is often used (for lack of a better term) though no tape (or film) is involved, where live video is recorded directly to video tape, a [[direct to disk recording]] using a [[hard disk recorder]], or a [[tapeless camcorder]] using [[flash media]].

Videographers maintain and operate a variety of video camera equipment, sound recording devices, edit footage, and stay up to date with technological advances. With modern video camcorders, professional studio quality videos can be produced at low cost rivaling large studios.  Many major studios have stopped using film as a medium due to [[Linear video editing|linear-editing devices]] no longer being made and the availability for amateurs to produce acceptable videos using DSLRs ([[Digital single-lens reflex camera]]). Videographers use [[Non-linear editing system|non-linear editing]] software on home computers.

'''Vivian Van Damm''' (28 June 1889 – 14 December 1960) was a prominent London theatre [[impresario]] from 1932 until 1960, managing the [[Windmill Theatre]] in London's Great Windmill Street, which was a British institution, famed for its pioneering ''[[tableaux vivants]]'' of motionless female nudity, and for its reputation of having 'never closed' during [[London Blitz|the Blitz]]. {{Citation Needed|date=August 2018}}

==Early life==
Van Damm, known as "VD", came from a middle-class London family of Dutch Jewish origin. He left school at 14 to work in a garage, and later{{when|date=January 2015}} abandoned the motor trade to manage West End cinemas.

==Windmill Theatre==
In 1931, [[Laura Henderson]] opened the tiny, one-tier [[Windmill Theatre]] as a playhouse, but it was not profitable, and she soon resorted to showing films. She then hired Van Damm, and they produced ''Revudeville'', a programme of continuous variety, comprising 18 entertainment acts.  That was also a commercial failure, so they included nudity to emulate the [[Folies Bergère]] and the [[Moulin Rouge]]. 

The key element was Van Damm's exploitation of a legal loophole (or zone of tolerance) that nude statues could not be banned on moral grounds.  This led to the legendary "Windmill Girls". The girls had to remain motionless, the [[Lord Chamberlain]]'s ruling being, "If you move, it's rude". To ward off criticism he used his own daughter, under the stage name of Betti Talbot, as one of the nudes. The Hollywood film ''[[Tonight and Every Night]]'', starring [[Rita Hayworth]], told some of the story of the Windmill, though it contained no nudity.&lt;ref&gt;Val Guest 'So you want to be in pictures' p.97-98&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Damm's flair for public relations created the legend of the theatre that "never closed". Newspapers in [[World War II]] carried pictures of plucky Windmill girls in tin hats on fire-watching duty, and stories of showgirls giving [[V-sign]]s to German bombers. Indeed, except for a 12-day period in 1939, when all London theatres were ordered closed, the Windmill remained open throughout the Blitz.

Laura Henderson bequeathed the Windmill Theatre to Vivian Van Damm in 1944, and he ran it until his death in December 1960. He left it to his daughter, [[Sheila van Damm]], a [[rally driver]]. The Windmill Theatre closed on 31 October 1964.
