[[Image:Stylised Lithium Atom.svg|right|thumb|200px|Stylized [[lithium]]-7 atom: 3 protons, 4 neutrons, &amp; 3 electrons (total electrons are ~{{frac|1|4300}}th of the mass of the nucleus). It has a mass of 7.016&amp;nbsp;'''u'''. Rare lithium-6 (mass of 6.015&amp;nbsp;'''u''') has only 3 neutrons, reducing the atomic weight (average) of lithium to 6.941.]]

The '''atomic mass''' (''m''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;) is the [[mass]] of an atom. Its unit is the [[Atomic mass unit|unified atomic mass units]] (symbol: u, or Da) where 1 unified atomic mass unit is defined as {{frac|1|12}} of the mass of a single carbon-12 atom, at rest.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|file=A00496|title=atomic mass}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For atoms, the protons and neutrons of the nucleus account for almost all of the mass, and the atomic mass measured in u has nearly the same value as the [[mass number]].

When divided by [[Atomic mass unit|unified atomic mass units]] or [[dalton (unit)|daltons]] to form a pure numeric ratio, the atomic mass of an atom becomes a [[dimensionless number|dimensionless value]] called the '''relative isotopic mass''' (see section below). Thus, the atomic mass of a carbon-12 atom is 12&amp;nbsp;u or 12&amp;nbsp;daltons (Da), but the relative isotopic mass of a carbon-12 atom is simply 12.

The atomic mass or relative isotopic mass refers to the mass of a single particle, and therefore is tied to a certain specific [[isotope]] of an element. The dimensionless [[standard atomic weight]] instead refers to the average (mathematical [[mean]]) of atomic mass values of a typical naturally-occurring mixture of isotopes for a sample of an element.  Atomic mass values are thus commonly reported to many more significant figures than atomic weights. Standard atomic weight is related to atomic mass by the abundance ranking of isotopes for each element. It is usually ''about'' the same value as the atomic mass of the most abundant isotope, other than what looks like (but is not actually) a [[rounding]] difference.

The atomic mass of atoms, ions, or atomic nuclei is slightly less than the sum of the masses of their constituent [[protons]], [[neutrons]], and [[electron]]s, due to [[Mass–energy equivalence#Binding energy and the .22mass defect.22|binding energy mass loss]] (as per ''E''=''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/41699/atomic-mass Atomic mass], Encyclopædia Britannica on-line&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relative isotopic mass: the same quantity as atomic mass, but with different units ==
'''Relative ''isotopic'' mass''' (a property of a single atom) is not to be confused with the averaged quantity  [[atomic weight]] (see above), that is an average of values for many atoms in a given sample of a chemical element.

Relative isotopic mass is similar to atomic mass and has exactly the same numerical value as atomic mass, whenever atomic mass is expressed in [[Atomic mass unit|unified atomic mass units]]. The only difference in that case, is that relative isotopic mass is a pure number with no units. This loss of units results from the use of a scaling ratio with respect to a carbon-12 standard, and the word "relative" in the term "relative isotopic mass" refers to this scaling ''relative'' to carbon-12.

The relative isotopic mass, then, is the mass of a given isotope (specifically, any single [[nuclide]]), when this value is scaled by the mass of [[carbon-12]], when the latter is set equal to 12. Equivalently, the relative isotopic mass of an isotope or nuclide is the mass of the isotope relative to 1/12 of the mass of a carbon-12 atom.

For example, the '''relative isotopic mass''' of a carbon-12 atom is exactly 12. For comparison, the '''atomic mass''' of a carbon-12 atom is exactly 12 [[dalton (unit)|daltons]] or 12 [[Atomic mass unit|unified atomic mass units]]. Alternately, the atomic mass of a carbon-12 atom may be expressed in any other mass units: for example, the atomic mass of a carbon-12 atom is about 1.998467052 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−26&lt;/sup&gt; kilograms.

As in the case of atomic mass, no nuclides other than carbon-12 have exactly whole-number values of relative isotopic mass. As is the case for the related ''atomic mass'' when expressed in [[Atomic mass unit|unified atomic mass units]] or [[dalton (unit)|daltons]], the relative isotopic mass numbers of nuclides other than carbon-12 are not whole numbers, but are always close to whole numbers. This is discussed more fully below.

== Similar terms for different quantities ==
The atomic mass and relative isotopic mass are sometimes confused, or incorrectly used, as synonyms of [[standard atomic weight]] (also known as atomic weight) and the standard atomic weight (a particular variety of atomic weight, in the sense that is a standardized atomic weight). However, as noted in the introduction, atomic weight and standard atomic weight represent terms for (abundance-weighted) averages of atomic masses in elemental samples, not for single nuclides. As such, atomic weight and standard atomic weight often differ numerically from relative isotopic mass and atomic mass, and they can also have different units than atomic mass when this quantity is not expressed in [[Atomic mass unit|unified atomic mass units]] (see the linked article for [[atomic weight]]).

The atomic mass (relative isotopic mass) is defined as the mass of a single atom, which can only be one [[isotope]] (nuclide) at a time, and is not an abundance-weighted average, as in the case of relative atomic mass/atomic weight. The atomic mass or relative isotopic mass of each isotope and nuclide of a chemical element is therefore a number that can in principle be measured to a very great precision, since every specimen of such a nuclide is expected to be exactly identical to every other specimen, as all atoms of a given type in the same energy state, and every specimen of a particular nuclide, are expected to be exactly identical in mass to every other specimen of that nuclide. For example, every atom of oxygen-16 is expected to have exactly the same atomic mass (relative isotopic mass) as every other atom of oxygen-16.

In the case of many elements that have one naturally occurring isotope ([[mononuclidic element]]s) or one dominant isotope, the actual numerical similarity/difference between the atomic mass of the most common isotope, and the (standard) relative atomic mass or (standard) atomic weight can be small or even nil, and does not affect most bulk calculations. However, such an error can exist and even be important when considering individual atoms for elements that are not mononuclidic.

For non-mononuclidic elements that have more than one common isotope, the numerical difference in relative atomic mass (atomic weight) from even the most common relative isotopic mass, can be half a mass unit or more (e.g. see the case of [[chlorine]] where atomic weight and standard atomic weight are about 35.45). The atomic mass (relative isotopic mass) of an uncommon isotope can differ from the relative atomic mass, atomic weight, or standard atomic weight, by several mass units.

Atomic masses expressed in [[Atomic mass unit|unified atomic mass units]] (i.e. relative isotopic masses) are always close to whole-number values, but never (except in the case of carbon-12) exactly a whole number, for two reasons:

*protons and neutrons have different masses, and different nuclides have different ratios of protons and neutrons.
*atomic masses are reduced, to different extents, by their [[binding energy|binding energies]].

The ratio of atomic mass to [[mass number]] (number of nucleons) varies from about 0.99884 for &lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;Fe to 1.00782505 for &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H.

Any [[mass defect]] due to [[nuclear binding energy]] is experimentally a small fraction (less than 1%) of the mass of equal number of free nucleons. When compared to the average mass per nucleon in carbon-12, which is moderately strongly-bound compared with other atoms, the mass defect of binding for most atoms is an even smaller fraction of a dalton ([[unified atomic mass unit]], based on carbon-12). Since free protons and neutrons differ from each other in mass by a small fraction of a dalton (about 0.0014 '''[[atomic mass unit|u]]'''), rounding the relative isotopic mass, or the atomic mass of any given nuclide given in daltons to the nearest whole number always gives the nucleon count, or mass number. Additionally, the neutron count ([[neutron number]]) may then be derived by subtracting the number of protons ([[atomic number]]) from the mass number (nucleon count).

==Mass defects in atomic masses==
[[Image:Binding energy curve - common isotopes.svg|thumb|right|300 px|Binding energy per nucleon of common isotopes. A graph of the ratio of mass number to atomic mass would be similar.]]
The amount that the ratio of atomic masses to mass number deviates from 1 is as follows: the deviation starts positive at [[hydrogen]]-1, then decreases until it reaches a local minimum at helium-4. Isotopes of lithium, beryllium, and boron are less strongly bound than helium, as shown by their increasing mass-to-mass number ratios.

At carbon, the ratio of mass (in daltons) to mass number is defined as 1, and after carbon it becomes less than one until a minimum is reached at [[iron]]-56 (with only slightly higher values for iron-58 and [[nickel]]-62), then increases to positive values in the heavy isotopes, with increasing atomic number. This corresponds to the fact that [[nuclear fission]] in an element heavier than [[zirconium]] produces energy, and fission in any element lighter than [[niobium]] requires energy. On the other hand, [[nuclear fusion]] of two atoms of an element lighter than [[scandium]] (except for helium) produces energy, whereas fusion in elements heavier than [[calcium]] requires energy. The fusion of two atoms of He-4 to give [[beryllium]]-8 would require energy, and the beryllium would quickly fall apart again. He-4 can fuse with [[tritium]] (H-3) or with He-3, and these processes occurred during [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]]. The formation of elements with more than seven nucleons requires the fusion of three atoms of He-4 in the so-called [[triple alpha process]], skipping over lithium, beryllium, and boron to produce carbon.

==Measurement of atomic masses==
Direct comparison and measurement of the masses of atoms is achieved with [[mass spectrometry]].

==Conversion factor between atomic mass units and grams==
The standard scientific unit used to quantify the amount of a substance in macroscopic quantities is the [[mole (unit)|mole]] (symbol: mol), which is defined arbitrarily as the amount of a substance which has as many atoms or molecules as there are atoms in 12&amp;nbsp;grams of the carbon isotope C-12. The number of atoms in a mole is called [[Avogadro's number]], the value of which is approximately 6.022 × 10{{smsup|23}}.

One mole of a substance always contains almost exactly the ''[[standard atomic weight]]'' or ''[[molar mass]]'' of that substance; however, this may or may not be true for the ''atomic mass,'' depending on whether or not the element exists naturally in more than one isotope. For example, the [[standard atomic weight]] of [[iron]] is 55.847 g/mol, and therefore one mole of iron as commonly found on earth has a mass of 55.847&amp;nbsp;grams. The ''atomic mass'' of the &lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;Fe isotope is 55.935 u and one mole of &lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;Fe atoms would then in theory have a mass of 55.935 g, but such amounts of pure &lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;Fe have never been found (or separated out) on Earth. However, there are 22 [[mononuclidic element]]s of which essentially only a single isotope is found in nature (common examples are fluorine, sodium, aluminum and phosphorus) and for these elements the [[standard atomic weight]] and atomic mass are the same. Samples of these elements therefore may serve as reference standards for certain atomic mass values.

The formula used for conversion between [[atomic mass unit]]s and [[SI]] mass in grams for a single atom is:

::&lt;math&gt;1\ {\rm{u}}={M_{\rm{u}} \over N_{\rm A}}\ = {{1\ \rm{g/mol}} \over N_{\rm A}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;M_{\rm u}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Molar mass constant]] and &lt;math&gt;N_{\rm A}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Avogadro constant]].

==Relationship between atomic and molecular masses==
Similar definitions apply to [[molecule]]s. One can compute the [[molecular mass]] of a compound by adding the atomic masses of its constituent atoms (nuclides). One can compute the [[molar mass]] of a compound by adding the relative atomic masses of the elements given in the [[chemical formula]]. In both cases the multiplicity of the atoms (the number of times it occurs) must be taken into account, usually by multiplication of each unique mass by its multiplicity.

==History==
{{main|History of chemistry|Unified atomic mass unit}}
The first scientists to determine relative atomic masses were [[John Dalton]] and [[Thomas Thomson (chemist)|Thomas Thomson]] between 1803 and 1805 and [[Jöns Jakob Berzelius]] between 1808 and 1826. Relative atomic mass (''Atomic weight'') was originally defined relative to that of the lightest element, hydrogen, which was taken as 1.00, and in the 1820s [[Prout's hypothesis]] stated that atomic masses of all elements would prove to be exact multiples of that of hydrogen. Berzelius, however, soon proved that this was not even approximately true, and for some elements, such as chlorine, relative atomic mass, at about 35.5, falls almost exactly halfway between two integral multiples of that of hydrogen. Still later, this was shown to be largely due to a mix of isotopes, and that the atomic masses of pure isotopes, or [[nuclide]]s, are multiples of the hydrogen mass, to within about 1%.

In the 1860s [[Stanislao Cannizzaro]] refined relative atomic masses by applying [[Avogadro's law]] (notably at the [[Karlsruhe Congress]] of 1860). He formulated a law to determine relative atomic masses of elements: ''the different quantities of the same element contained in different molecules are all whole multiples of the atomic weight'' and determined relative atomic masses and molecular masses by comparing the [[vapor density]] of a collection of gases with molecules containing one or more of the chemical element in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ed084p1779 | title = Origin of the Formulas of Dihydrogen and Other Simple Molecules | first = Andrew | last = Williams | volume = 84 | year = 2007 | issue = 11 | journal = [[Journal of Chemical Education|J. Chem. Educ.]] | pages = 1779|bibcode = 2007JChEd..84.1779W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, until the 1960s chemists and physicists used two different atomic-mass scales. The chemists used a "atomic mass unit" (amu) scale such that the natural mixture of [[oxygen]] isotopes had an atomic mass 16, while the physicists assigned the same number 16 to only the atomic mass of the most common oxygen isotope (&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O, containing eight protons and eight neutrons). However, because [[oxygen-17]] and [[oxygen-18]] are also present in natural oxygen this led to two different tables of atomic mass. The unified scale based on carbon-12, &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C, met the physicists' need to base the scale on a pure isotope, while being numerically close to the chemists' scale.

The term ''atomic weight'' is being phased out slowly and being replaced by ''relative atomic mass'', in most current usage. This shift in nomenclature reaches back to the 1960s and has been the source of much debate in the scientific community, which was triggered by the adoption of the [[unified atomic mass unit]] and the realization that weight was in some ways an inappropriate term. The argument for keeping the term "atomic weight" was primarily that it was a well understood term to those in the field, that the term "atomic mass" was already in use (as it is currently defined) and that the term "relative atomic mass" might be easily confused with ''relative isotopic mass'' (the mass of a single atom of a given nuclide, expressed dimensionlessly relative to 1/12 of the mass of carbon-12; see section above).

In 1979, as a compromise, the term "relative atomic mass" was introduced as a secondary synonym for atomic weight. Twenty years later the primacy of these synonyms was reversed, and the term "relative atomic mass" is now the preferred term.

However, the term "''standard'' atomic weights" (referring to the standardized expectation atomic weights of differing samples) has not been changed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1992/pdf/6410x1535.pdf |title='Atomic weight': The name, its history, definition, and units|journal=Pure Appl.

S.|issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;, because simple replacement of "atomic weight" with "relative atomic mass" would have resulted in the term "standard relative atomic mass."

[[File:Moon and red blue haze.jpg|thumb|[[Moon]] seen through the Belt of Venus. Note that the full Moon is near the centre of the field of view, which means that the Sun must be behind the camera, just below the horizon.]]
The '''Belt of Venus''', '''Venus's Girdle''', or '''antitwilight arch''' is an [[atmospheric phenomenon]] visible shortly before [[sunrise]] or after [[sunset]], during [[civil twilight]], when a pinkish glow extending roughly [[horizontal coordinate system|10–20°]] above the horizon surrounds the observer.

In a way, the Belt of Venus is actually [[alpenglow]] visible above the horizon during twilight, near the [[antisolar point]]. Like [[alpenglow]], the [[backscatter]] of reddened [[sunlight]] also creates the Belt of Venus. Unlike alpenglow, the sunlight [[refracted]] by the fine [[particulates]] that cause the rosy arch of the Belt hovers high in the atmosphere and persists long after sunset or before sunrise. 

As twilight progresses, the glow is separated from the horizon by the dark band of [[Earth's shadow]], or "dark segment." The arch's light pink color is due to the [[backscatter]] of reddened light from the rising or setting [[Sun]]. A very similar effect can be seen during a total [[lunar eclipse]]. The [[zodiacal light]], which is caused by the [[diffuse reflection]] of sunlight from the [[interplanetary dust]] in the [[Solar System]], is also a similar phenomenon.

The name of the phenomenon alludes to the ''cestus'', a girdle or breast-band, of the Ancient Greek goddess [[Aphrodite]], customarily equated with the Roman goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]. Since the greatest elongation (separation) between Venus and the Sun is only about 46 degrees, the [[planet]] [[Venus]], even when visible, is never located opposite the sun and hence is never located in the Belt of Venus.

'''Birds Korea''' is an organisation dedicated to the conservation of [[bird]]s and their [[habitat]]s in [[South Korea]] and the wider [[Yellow Sea]] Eco-region.

== History and Activities ==

Founded in 2004 and based in the port city of [[Busan]], Birds Korea has regularly updated websites in both [[English language|English]] and [[Korean language|Korean]]. Birds Korea works on a wide range of conservation projects, including research, advocacy, and education programs. As such, the organisation has received wide domestic and international coverage of their work in both online and mainstream media, on issues ranging from Korean outbreaks of [[H5N1]] avian influenza (2005–2006), to the impacts of the [[Taean]] oil spill (2007), to pilot restoration work at the [[Mokpo]] Namhang urban wetland (2007–2008), and to concerns over avian biodiversity threatened by the proposed [[Grand Korean Waterway|Korean Grand Canal Project]] (2008).

Most notably, in 2006 Birds Korea developed the [[Saemangeum]] [[Shorebird]] Monitoring Program (SSMP) in partnership with the [[Australasian Wader Studies Group]], monitoring the impacts of the world's largest known coastal reclamation (the 40,100 ha Saemangeum) on populations of migratory shorebirds. Prior to [[Saemangeum Seawall|seawall]] closure in April 2006, [[Saemangeum]] was considered to be the single most important shorebird site in the Yellow Sea (Barter, 2002).  The SSMP documented (following [[Saemangeum Seawall|seawall]] closure) very major declines of several species of [[wader|shorebirds]] within the Saemangeum reclamation area and adjacent wetlands (Moores et al., 2006; Rogers et al., 2006; Moores et al., 2007), and through further coordinated survey effort (e.g. the 2008 Birds Korea National Shorebird Survey), declines of species such as [[spoon-billed sandpiper]] ''Eurynorhynchus pygmeus'' (critically endangered) and [[great knot]] ''Calidris tenuirostris'' at the national level too. SSMP and other shorebird data gathered in 2008 is to be published in time for the Tenth Conference of the Parties of the [[Ramsar Convention]] (to be held in [[Changwon|Changwon City]], [[South Korea]], between October 28 and November 4, 2008), to inform and influence the increasingly urgent debate on the need to better conserve the intertidal habitats and biodiversity of the Yellow Sea.

The '''Deep Carbon Observatory''' ('''DCO''') is a global research program designed to transform understanding of [[Carbon|carbon's]] role in Earth. DCO is a community of scientists, including biologists, physicists, geoscientists and chemists, whose work crosses several traditional disciplinary lines to develop the new, integrative field of deep carbon science. To complement this research, the DCO’s infrastructure includes public engagement and education, online and offline community support, innovative data management, and novel instrumentation development.&lt;ref name=aboutDCO&gt;{{cite web| url = http://deepcarbon.net/about/about-dco | title = About the DCO | publisher = Deep Carbon Observatory | date = Dec 1, 2013 |accessdate=Aug 2, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2007, [[Robert Hazen]], a Senior Staff Scientist at the [[Carnegie Institution]]’s Geophysical Laboratory (Washington, DC, USA) spoke at the [[Century Association|Century Club]] in New York, on the origins of life on Earth and how geophysical reactions may have played a critical role in the development of life on Earth. [[Jesse H. Ausubel|Jesse Ausubel]], a faculty member at [[Rockefeller University]] and Program Director at the [[Alfred P. Sloan Foundation]], was in attendance and later sought out Hazen’s book, ''Genesis: The Scientific Quest for Life’s Origins''.

After two years of planning and collaboration, Hazen and colleagues officially launched the Deep Carbon Observatory (DCO) in August 2009, with its secretariat based at the Geophysical Laboratory of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, DC. Hazen and Ausubel, along with input from over 100 scientists invited to participate in the Deep Carbon Cycle Workshop in 2008, expanded their original idea. No longer focused solely on the origin of life on Earth, the group instead clarified their position to further human understanding of Earth, carbon, that critical element, had to take center stage.&lt;ref name=aboutDCO/&gt;

==Deep Carbon Cycle==
The Deep Carbon Observatory's research considers the global [[carbon cycle]] beyond Earth's surface. It explores high-pressure and extreme temperature organic synthesis, complex interactions between organic molecules and minerals, conducts field observations of deep microbial ecosystems and of anomalies in petroleum geochemistry, and constructs theoretical models of lower crust and upper mantle carbon sources and sinks.

==Research Programs==
The Deep Carbon Observatory is structured around four Science Communities: Reservoirs and Fluxes, Deep Life, Deep Energy, and Extreme Physics and Chemistry.

===Reservoirs and Fluxes===
The Reservoirs and Fluxes Community explores the storage and transport of carbon in Earth’s deep interior. The subduction of tectonic plates and volcanic outgassing are primary vehicles for [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|carbon fluxes]] to and from deep Earth, but the processes and rates of these fluxes, as well as their variation throughout Earth's history, remain poorly understood. In addition DCO research on primitive [[chondritic]] meteorites indicates that Earth is relatively depleted in highly volatile elements compared to chondrites, though DCO's research is further examining whether large reservoirs of carbon may be hidden in the mantle and core. Members of the Reservoirs and Fluxes Community are conducting research as a part of the [[Deep Earth Carbon Degassing Project]] to make tangible advances towards quantifying the amount of carbon outgassed from the Earth’s deep interior (core, mantle, crust) into the surface environment (e.g. biosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, atmosphere) through naturally occurring processes.

===Deep Life===
The Deep Life Community documents the extreme limits and global extent of subsurface life in our planet, exploring the evolutionary and functional diversity of Earth’s deep biosphere and its interaction with the carbon cycle. The Deep Life Community maps the abundance and diversity of subsurface marine and continental microorganisms in time and space as a function of their genomic and biogeochemical properties, and their interactions with deep carbon. By integrating ''in situ'' and ''in vitro'' assessments of biomolecules and cells, the Deep Life Community explores the environmental limits to the survival, metabolism and reproduction of deep life. The resulting data informs experiments and models that study the impact of deep life on the carbon cycle, and the deep biosphere’s relation to the surface world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://deepcarbon.net/content/deep-energy | title = DCO Deep Energy Community | publisher = Deep Carbon Observatory | date = Jun 22, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the Deep Life Community are conducting research as a part of the Census of Deep Life, which seeks to seeks to identify the diversity and distribution of microbial life in continental and marine deep subsurface environments and to explore mechanisms that govern microbial evolution and dispersal in the deep biosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://codl.coas.oregonstate.edu/ | title = Census of Deep Life | accessdate = Sep 28, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deep Energy===
The Deep Energy Community is dedicated to quantifying the environmental conditions and processes from the molecular to the global scale that control the origins, forms, quantities and movements of reduced carbon compounds derived from deep carbon through deep geologic time.  The Deep Energy Community uses field-based investigations of approximately 25 globally representative terrestrial and marine environments to determine processes controlling the origin, form, quantities and movements of abiotic gases and organic species in Earth’s crust and uppermost mantle. Deep Energy also uses DCO-sponsored instrumentation, especially revolutionary isotopologue measurements, to discriminate between the abiotic and biotic methane gas and organic species sampled from global terrestrial and marine field sites. Another research activity of Deep Energy is to quantify the mechanisms and rates of fluid-rock interactions that produce abiotic hydrogen and organic compounds as a function of temperature, pressure, fluid and solid compositions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://deepcarbon.net/content/deep-life | title = DCO Deep Life Community | publisher = Deep Carbon Observatory | date = Jun 22, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extreme Physics and Chemistry===
As a result of a series of workshops, the DCO initiated an additional Science Community to examine the physics and chemistry of carbon under extreme conditions. The overarching goal of the Extreme Physics and Chemistry Community is to improve the understanding of the physical and chemical behavior of carbon at extreme conditions, as found in the deep interiors of Earth and other planets. Extreme Physics and chemistry research explores [[thermodynamics]] of carbon-bearing systems, [[chemical kinetics]] of chemical deep carbon processes, high-pressure [[biology]] and [[biophysics]], physical properties of [[aqueous solution|aqueous fluids]], [[Density functional theory|theoretical modeling]] for carbon and its compounds at high pressures and temperatures, and solid-fluid interactions under extreme conditions. The Extreme Physics and Chemistry Community also seeks to identify possible new carbon-bearing materials in Earth and planetary interiors, to characterize the properties of these materials and to identify reactions at conditions relevant to Earth and planetary interiors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://deepcarbon.net/content/extreme-physics-and-chemistry | title = DCO Extreme Physics and Chemistry | publisher = Deep Carbon Observatory | date = Jun 22, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Integrating Discovery===
As the DCO nears its completion in 2020, it is integrating the discoveries made by its research communities into an overarching model of carbon in Earth, as well as other models and products aimed at both the scientific community and wider public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Synthesizing Our Understanding of Earth's Deep Carbon|url=https://eos.org/project-updates/synthesizing-our-understanding-of-earths-deep-carbon|website=Eos|accessdate=28 February 2017|date=February 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Carbon In Earth"==
"Carbon in Earth", Volume 75 of ''[[Reviews in Mineralogy and Geochemistry]]'' (''RiMG'') was released as an open access publication on March 11, 2013. Each chapter of "Carbon in Earth" synthesizes what is known about deep carbon, and also outlines unanswered questions that will guide future DCO research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.minsocam.org/MSA/RIM/Rim75.html | title = Carbon in Earth | publisher = Reviews in Mineralogy and Geochemistry Open Access publication, Volume 75 | date = 2013-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Deep Carbon Observatory encourages open access publication, and is striving to become a leader in Earth sciences in this regard. DCO funding can be used to defray the costs of open access publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deepcarbon.net/dco/dco-open-access-and-data-policies |title=DCO Open Access and Data Policies |publisher=Deep Carbon Observatory |date=Jan 22, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328220731/http://deepcarbon.net/dco/dco-open-access-and-data-policies |archivedate=2014-03-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deep Carbon Observatory Data Science==
Recent advances in data generation techniques lead to increasingly complex data. At the same time, science and engineering disciplines are rapidly becoming more and more data driven with the ultimate aim of better understanding and modeling the dynamics of complex systems. However complex data requires integration of information and knowledge across multiple scales and spanning traditional disciplinary boundaries. Significant advances in methods, tools and applications for data science and informatics over the last five years can now be applied to multi- and inter-disciplinary problem areas. Given these challenges, it is clear that each DCO Research Community faces diverse data science and data management needs to fulfill both their overarching objectives and their day-to-day tasks. The Deep Carbon Observatory Data Science Team handles the data science and data management needs for each DCO program and for the DCO as a whole, using a combination of informatics methods, use case development, requirements analysis, inventories and interviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://tw.rpi.edu/web/project/DCO-DS | title = Deep Carbon Observatory Data Science | publisher = Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute | date = August 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''Energy Performance Investment''' is a funding solution that enables entities (the end beneficiary) to acquire [[Energy conservation measure|Energy Conservation Measures]] (ECM) via a third party investor and pay for them from the financial value of the proven energy savings achieved using a pay-as-you-save mechanism.

This investment model is similar in principle to an [[Energy Performance Contract]] (EPC) but with the exception that no guarantees are made as to the level of energy savings. Instead under the EPI the financial value of the proven and verified energy savings from the invested solution are shared between the end beneficiary and the investor at a predefined ratio. The third party investment is not a loan or a lease.

One of the key benefits of the EPI investment mechanism to the end beneficiary is that they only pay a proportion of the value achieved resulting in a reduction in their energy costs. Should no financial saving be achieved then the end beneficiary has nothing to pay i.e. they make no capital investment and will never be worse off.

Typically the measurement of the financial savings achieved is performed by a party unrelated to all other parties involved in the arrangement in order to ensure independence.

The first EPI was performed by Decarbon Limited in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David Lloyd Leisure raises the bar in energy saving|url=http://www.edie.net/news/news_story.asp?id=21998&amp;title=David+Lloyd+Leisure+raises+the+bar+in+energy+saving|publisher=edie Energy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''energy derivative''' is a [[derivative contract]] based on (derived from) an underlying energy asset, such as [[natural gas]], [[crude oil]], or [[electricity]].&lt;ref&gt;Investopedia article on energy derivatives&lt;/ref&gt; Energy derivatives are [[exotic derivatives]] and include exchange-traded contracts such as [[Futures contract|futures]] and [[Option (finance)|options]], and over-the-counter (i.e., privately negotiated) derivatives such as forwards, [[Swap (finance)|swaps]] and options. Major players in the energy derivative markets include major trading houses, oil companies, utilities, and financial institutions.

Energy derivatives were criticized after the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|2008 financial crisis]], with critics pointing out that the market artificially inflates the price of oil and other energy providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Behind Oil Price Rise: Peak Oil or Wall Street Speculation?|url=http://axisoflogic.com/artman/publish/Article_64370.shtml|publisher=Axis of Logic|accessdate=29 March 2012|author=F. William Engdahl|date=Mar 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

The basic building blocks for all derivative contracts are futures and swaps contracts. In [[energy market]]s, these are traded in New York [[NYMEX]], in Tokyo [[TOCOM]] and online through the [[IntercontinentalExchange]]. A future is a contract to deliver or receive oil (in the case of an oil future) at a defined point in the future. The price is agreed on the date the deal/agreement/bargain is struck together with volume, duration, and contract index. The price for the futures contract at the date of delivery (contract expiry date) may be different. At the expiry date, depending upon the contract specification the "futures" owner may either deliver/receive a physical amount of oil (extremely rare), they may [[Settlement (finance)|settle]] in cash against an expiration price set by the exchange, or they may close out the contract prior to expiry and pay or receive the difference in the two prices. In futures markets you always trade with a formal exchange, every participant has the same counterpart.

A swap is an agreement whereby a floating price is exchanged for a fixed price over a specified period. It is a financial arrangement that involves no transfer of physical oil; both parties settle their contractual obligations by means of a transfer of cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Idle regulation may impact gas prices|url=http://old.post-gazette.com/pg/12064/1214103-28.stm|publisher=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|accessdate=29 March 2012|author=Tracie Mauriello|date=March 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement defines the volume, duration, fixed price, and reference index for the floating price (e.g., ICE Brent). Differences are settled in cash for specific periods usually monthly, but sometimes quarterly, semi-annually or annually.

Swaps are also known as "contracts for differences" and as "fixed-for-floating" contracts, terms that summarize the essence of these financial arrangements. The amount of cash is determined as the difference between the price struck at the initiation of the swap and the settlement of the index. In a swap contract, you trade with your counterpart (a company/institution/individual) and take risk on their capacity to pay you any amount that may be due at settlement. Thus, investors should carefully enter into a swap agreement with other party considering all these parameters.

==History==
The first energy derivatives covered petroleum products and emerged after the [[1970s energy crisis]] and the fundamental restructuring of the world petroleum market that followed. At roughly the same time, energy products began trading on derivatives exchange with crude oil, heating oil, and gasoline futures on NYMEX and gas oil and [[Brent Crude]] on the [[International Petroleum Exchange]] (IPE).

==Applications==

There are three principal applications for the energy derivative markets:
# [[Risk management]] ([[Hedge (finance)|hedging]])
# [[Speculation]] (trading)
# Investment portfolio [[Diversification (finance)|diversification]]

=== Risk management ===
This describes the process used by corporations, governments, and financial institutions to reduce their risk exposures to the movement of oil prices. The classic example is the activity of an [[airline company]], [[jet fuel]] consumption represents up to 23% of all costs and fluctuations can affect airlines significantly.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}  The airline seeks to protect itself from rises in the jet fuel price in the future. In order to do this, it purchases a [[Swap (finance)|swap]] or a call option linked to the jet fuel market from an institution prepared to make prices in these instruments. Any subsequent rise in the jet price for the period is protected by the derivative transaction. A cash settlement at the expiry of the contract will fund the financial loss incurred by any rise in the physical jet fuel, allowing the companies to better measure future cash flows.

There are limitations to be considered when using energy derivatives to manage risk. A key consideration is that there is a limited range of derivatives available for trading. Continuing from the earlier example, if that company uses a specialized form of jet fuel, for which no derivatives are freely available, they may wish to create an approximate hedge, by buying derivatives based on the price of a similar fuel, or even crude oil. When these hedges are constructed, there is always the risk of unanticipated movement between the item actually being hedged (crude oil), and the source of risk the hedge is intended to minimize (the specialized jet fuel).

'''Energy in Libya''' describes [[energy]] and [[Electricity generation|electricity production]], consumption, and import in [[Libya]]. The [[Economy of Libya#Oil sector|petroleum industry]] is the primary engine of the [[Economy of Libya|Libyan economy]].

==Overview==
From 2004 to 2008, Libyan energy production increased by 21.5% and energy exports increased by 27%. [[Domestic energy consumption]] in Libya was likely driven by industry and [[population growth]]. During this period, according to the [[International Energy Agency]], the world population grew 5.3%, and the Libyan population grew 9.4%. As a net exporter of oil, Libya's energy production was also stimulated by growing populations in countries like [[Egypt]] (12.2% growth in that period), [[Yemen]] (13.4%), [[Sudan]] (16.4%), [[Saudi Arabia]] (2.9%), and [[Italy]] (3%).

Note the "lake-reflection" effect which is not real because there is no water in between.]]

A '''false sunrise''' is any of several [[atmospheric optics|atmospheric]] [[optical phenomena]] in which the [[Sun]] appears to have [[sunrise|risen]], but is actually still some distance below the horizon. A number of different atmospheric conditions can be responsible for this effect, all of which divert the [[sunlight]] in such a way as to allow it to reach the observer's eye, thereby giving the impression that the light comes directly from the Sun itself. The spread of light can sometimes be deceivingly similar to a true sun.

Several atmospheric phenomena that may alternatively be called a "false sunrise" are:

* Simple reflection of the sunlight off the bottom of the clouds.
* A type of [[halo (optical phenomenon)|ice crystal halo]], such as an [[upper tangent arc]] or, more commonly, an upper [[light pillar|sun pillar]] (similar to a [[subsun]], but extending above the sun instead of below it). Like all [[halo (optical phenomenon)|halos]], these phenomena are caused by the reflection and/or refraction of sunlight by [[ice crystals]] suspended in the atmosphere, often in the form of [[cirrus cloud|cirrus]] or [[cirrostratus cloud]]s. The temperature on the ground is irrelevant to their occurrence, meaning that halos can be seen throughout the year and in all climates.
* A type of [[mirage]], specifically the [[Novaya Zemlya effect]]. Restricted mainly to the polar regions, this phenomenon was named after its first observation on [[Novaya Zemlya]] during the third polar expedition led by [[Willem Barentsz]] in 1596/97, when the Sun was seen above the horizon "in his full roundnesse"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/threevoyageswil00bekegoog#page/n353/mode/2up|title=The Three Voyages of William Barents to the Arctic Regions, (1594, 1595, and ...|website=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; two weeks before its predicted return after the [[polar night]]. The account, written by officer [[Gerrit de Veer]], was met with general scepticism for centuries, and not until modern times was the effect proven to be genuine.&lt;ref&gt;Siebren van der Werf, ''Het Nova Zembla verschijnsel. Geschiedenis van een luchtspiegeling'' ("The Novaya Zemlya phenomenon. History of a mirage"), 2011; {{ISBN|978 90 6554 0850}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "false sunrise" should not be confused with "false dawn", which is a term sometimes used to refer to the [[zodiacal light]].

'''Fictional geography''' is the use of maps, text and imagery to create lands and territories to accompany works of fiction. Depending on the completeness and complexity of the work, varying media, levels of collaboration and a number of other factors, the depiction of geographical components to works of fiction can range from simple drawings of a small area as in ''[[The Twenty-One Balloons]]'' by [[William Pène du Bois]] to an entire fictional world as in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[Tolkien]] or even an entire galaxy as in ''[[Star Trek]]'' and its variants.

==Middle-earth==
One of the most notable examples of fictional geography is that created by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] to produce the [[Shire (Middle-earth)|Shire]] and its expansion to include all of [[Middle-earth]].

[[File:Graylag geese (Anser anser) in flight 1700.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Greylag geese (''[[Anser anser]]''). Birds are one of only four taxonomic groups to have [[evolution|evolved]] powered [[flight]].]]

A number of [[animal]]s have [[evolution|evolved]] '''aerial locomotion''', either by powered [[flight]] or by [[gliding (flight)|gliding]]. '''Flying and gliding animals''' (''volant'' animals) have evolved separately many times, without any single ancestor. [[Flight]] has evolved at least four times, in the [[insect]]s, [[pterosaur]]s, [[bird]]s, and [[bat]]s. Gliding has evolved on many more occasions. Usually the development is to aid [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] animals in getting from tree to tree, although there are other possibilities. Gliding, in particular, has evolved among [[rainforest]] animals, especially in the rainforests in [[Asia]] (most especially [[Borneo]]) where the [[tree]]s are tall and widely spaced. Several species of [[aquatic animal]]s, and a few [[amphibians]] and [[reptiles]] have also evolved to acquire this gliding flight ability, typically as a means of evading predators.

==Types==
Animal aerial locomotion can be divided into two categories—powered and unpowered. In unpowered modes of locomotion, the animal uses aerodynamics forces exerted on the body due to wind or falling through the air. In powered flight, the animal uses muscular power to generate aerodynamic forces. Animals using unpowered aerial locomotion cannot maintain altitude and speed due to unopposed drag, while animals using powered flight can maintain steady, level flight as long as their muscles are capable of doing so.

===Unpowered===
These modes of locomotion typically require an animal start from a raised location, converting that [[potential energy]] into [[kinetic energy]] and using aerodynamic forces to control trajectory and angle of descent. Energy is continually lost to drag without being replaced, thus these methods of locomotion have limited range and duration.
* [[Free fall|Falling]]: decreasing altitude under the force of [[gravity]], using no adaptations to increase [[Drag (physics)|drag]] or provide [[lift (force)|lift]].
* [[Parachuting]]: falling at an angle greater than 45° from the [[Horizontal plane|horizontal]] with adaptations to increase drag forces. Very small animals may be carried up by the [[wind]]. Some gliding animals may use their gliding membranes for drag rather than lift, to safely descend.
* [[gliding (flight)|Gliding flight]]: falling at an angle less than 45° from the horizontal with lift from adapted [[airfoil|aerofoil]] [[Patagium|membranes]]. This allows slowly falling directed horizontal movement, with streamlining to decrease drag forces for aerofoil efficiency and often with some maneuverability in air. Gliding animals have a lower [[aspect ratio (wing)|aspect ratio]] (wing length/breadth) than true flyers.

===Powered flight===
Powered [[flight]] has evolved only four times (first in insects, then in pterosaurs, birds and bats). It uses muscular power to generate aerodynamic forces and to replace energy lost to drag.
* [[Bird flight#Flapping|Flapping]]: moving [[wing]]s to produce lift and thrust. May ascend without the aid of the wind, as opposed to gliders and parachuters.

===Externally powered===
Ballooning and soaring are not powered by muscle, but rather by external aerodynamic sources of energy: the wind and rising thermals, respectively. Both can continue as long as the source of external power is present. Soaring is typically only seen in species capable of powered flight, as it requires extremely large wings.
* [[Ballooning (spider)|Ballooning]]: being carried up into the air from the aerodynamic effect on long strands of silk in the wind. Certain silk-producing [[arthropod]]s, mostly small or young spiders, secrete a special light-weight [[Gossamer (spider silk)|gossamer silk]] for ballooning, sometimes traveling great distances at high altitude. 
* [[Lift (soaring)|Soaring]]: gliding in rising or otherwise moving air that requires specific physiological and morphological adaptations that can sustain the animal aloft without flapping its wings. The rising air is due to [[thermals]], [[ridge lift]] or [[lift (soaring)|other meteorological features]]. Under the right conditions, soaring creates a gain of altitude without expending energy. Large wingspans are needed for efficient soaring.

Many species will use multiple of these modes at various times; a hawk will use powered flight to rise, then soar on thermals, then descend via free-fall to catch its prey.

==Evolution and ecology==

===Gliding and parachuting===
While gliding occurs independently from powered flight,&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.nature.com/news/2011/11/new_theory_on_bat_flight_has_e_1.html]&lt;/ref&gt; it has some ecological advantages of its own. Gliding is a very [[energy]]-efficient way of travelling from tree to tree. An argument made is that many gliding animals eat low energy foods such as leaves and are restricted to gliding because of this, whereas flying animals eat more high energy foods such as [[fruit]]s, [[nectar]], and insects.&lt;ref name="rainforest"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.szgdocent.org/resource/ff/f-rain1a.htm | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060709003610/http://www.szgdocent.org/resource/ff/f-rain1a.htm | archivedate=2006-07-09 |title=Life in the Rainforest |accessdate=15 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to flight, gliding has evolved independently many times (more than a dozen times among extant vertebrates); however these groups have not radiated nearly as much as have groups of flying animals.

Worldwide, the distribution of gliding animals is uneven as most inhabit rain forests in [[Southeast Asia]]. (Despite seemingly suitable rain forest habitats, few gliders are found in India or New Guinea and none in Madagascar.) Additionally, a variety of gliding vertebrates are found in [[Africa]], a family of [[Hylidae|hylids]] ([[flying frog]]s) lives in [[South America]] and several species of gliding squirrels are found in the forests of northern Asia and North America.&lt;ref name=Corlett&gt;{{cite book |last1=Corlett |first1=Richard T. |title=Tropical rain forests : an ecological and biogeographical comparison |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |date=2011 |location=Chichester |isbn=978-1444332551 |pages=197, 200 |edition=2nd |author2=Primack, Richard B. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R0j8NROHQi8C&amp;pg=PA197&amp;lpg=PA197&amp;dq=south+american+gliding+frog&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sRvEGT5a8F&amp;sig=cLFndvIrNFzOzlBTzPuGh93AQg0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PFRJT-86gefRAf_SrKUO&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=south%20american%20gliding%20frog&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various factors produce these disparities. In the forests of Southeast Asia, the dominant canopy trees (usually [[Dipterocarpaceae|dipterocarp]]s) are taller than the canopy trees of the other forests. A higher start provides a competitive advantage of further glides and farther travel. Gliding predators may more efficiently search for prey. The lower abundance of insect and small vertebrate prey for carnivorous animals (such as lizards) in Asian forests may be a factor.&lt;ref name=Corlett/&gt;  In Australia, many mammals (and all mammalian gliders) possess, to some extent, prehensile tails.

===Powered flight===
[[File:Homology.jpg|upright|thumbnail| [[Homology (biology)|Analogous flying adaptions in vertebrates]]: {{ordered list |1=pterosaur ([[Pterosauria]]) |2=bat ([[Chiroptera]]) |3=bird ([[Aves]])}}]]

Powered flight has evolved unambiguously only four times—[[birds]], [[bats]], [[pterosaurs]], and [[insects]]. In contrast to gliding, which has evolved more frequently but typically gives rise to only a handful of species, all three extant groups of powered flyers have a huge number of species, suggesting that flight is a very successful strategy once evolved. [[Bat]]s, after [[rodent]]s, have the most species of any [[mammal]]ian order, about 20% of all mammalian [[species]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Simmons |first1=N.B. |title=Mammal Species of the World: A Taxonomic and Geographic Reference|date=2005|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, MD|pages=312–529 |author2=D.E. Wilson, D.C. Reeder}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bird]]s have the most species of any class of terrestrial [[vertebrate]]s. Finally, [[insect]]s (most of which fly at some point in their life cycle) have more species than all other animal groups combined.

The evolution of flight is one of the most striking and demanding in animal evolution, and has attracted the attention of many prominent scientists and generated many theories. Additionally, because flying animals tend to be small and have a low mass (both of which increase the surface-area-to-mass ratio), they tend to fossilize infrequently and poorly compared to the larger, heavier-boned terrestrial species they share habitat with. Fossils of flying animals tend to be confined to exceptional fossil deposits formed under highly specific circumstances, resulting in a generally poor fossil record, and a particular lack of transitional forms. Furthermore, as fossils do not preserve behavior or muscle, it can be difficult to discriminate between a poor flyer and a good glider.

[[Insect wing#Evolution|Insects were the first to evolve flight]], approximately 350 million years ago. The developmental origin of the insect wing remains in dispute, as does the purpose prior to true flight. One suggestion is that wings initially were used to catch the wind for small insects that live on the surface of the water, while another is that they functioned in parachuting, then gliding, then flight for originally arboreal insects.

[[Pterosaurs]] were the next to evolve flight, approximately 228 million years ago. These reptiles were close relatives of the dinosaurs (and sometimes mistakenly considered dinosaurs by laymen), and reached enormous sizes, with some of the last forms being the largest flying animals ever to inhabit the Earth, having wingspans of over 9.1&amp;nbsp;m (30&amp;nbsp;ft). However, they spanned a large range of sizes, down to a 250&amp;nbsp;mm (10&amp;nbsp;in) wingspan in ''[[Nemicolopterus]]''.

[[Bird flight#Evolution of bird flight|Birds]] have an extensive fossil record, along with many forms documenting both their evolution from small theropod dinosaurs and the numerous bird-like forms of theropod which did not survive the mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous. Indeed, ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' is arguably the most famous transitional fossil in the world, both due to its mix of reptilian and avian anatomy and the luck of being discovered only two years after Darwin's publication of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''. However, the ecology and this transition is considerably more contentious, with various scientists supporting either a "trees down" origin (in which an arboreal ancestor evolved gliding, then flight) or a "ground up" origin (in which a fast-running terrestrial ancestor used wings for a speed boost and to help catch prey).

[[Bat]]s are the most recent to evolve (about 60 million years ago), most likely from a fluttering ancestor&lt;ref name="Kaplan2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kaplan |first1=Matt |title=Ancient bats got in a flap over food |journal=Nature |year=2011 |doi=10.1038/nature.2011.9304}}&lt;/ref&gt;, though their poor fossil record has hindered more detailed study.

Only a few animals are known to have specialised in soaring: the larger of the extinct [[pterosaur]]s, and some large birds. Powered flight is very energetically expensive for large animals, but for soaring their size is an advantage, as it allows them a low wing loading, that is a large wing areas relative to their weight, which maximizes lift.&lt;ref name="berkeleyenter"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/vertebrates/flight/enter.html | title=Vertebrate Flight |accessdate=15 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soaring is very energetically efficient.

==Biomechanics==

===Gliding and parachuting===
During a free-fall with no aerodynamic forces, the object accelerates due to gravity, resulting in increasing velocity as the object descends. During parachuting, animals use the aerodynamic forces on their body to counteract the force or gravity. Any object moving through air experiences a drag force that is proportion to surface area and to velocity squared, and this force will partially counter the force of gravity, slowing the animal's descent to a safer speed. If this drag is oriented at an angle to the vertical, the animal's trajectory will gradually become more horizontal, and it will cover horizontal as well as vertical distance. Smaller adjustments can allow turning or other maneuvers. This can allow a parachuting animal to move from a high location on one tree to a lower location on another tree nearby.

During gliding, lift plays an increased role. Like drag, lift is proportional to velocity squared. Gliding animals will typically leap or drop from high locations such as trees, just as in parachuting, and as gravitational acceleration increases their speed, the aerodynamic forces also increase. Because the animal can utilize lift and drag to generate greater aerodynamic force, it can glide at a shallower angle than parachuting animals, allowing it to cover greater horizontal distance in the same loss of altitude, and reach trees further away.

===Powered flight===
Unlike most air vehicles, in which the objects that generate lift (wings) and thrust (engine/propeller) are separate and the wings remained fixed, flying animals use their wings to generate both lift and thrust by moving them relative to the body. This has made the flight of organisms considerably harder to understand than that of vehicles, as it involves varying speeds, angles, orientations, areas, and flow patterns over the wings.

A [[Bird flight|bird]] or [[bat]] flying through the air at a constant speed moves its wings up and down (usually with some fore-aft movement as well). Because the animal is in motion, there is some airflow relative to its body which, combined with the velocity of its wings, generates a faster airflow moving over the wing. This will generate lift force vector pointing forwards and upwards, and a drag force vector pointing rearwards and upwards. The upwards components of these counteract gravity, keeping the body in the air, while the forward component provides thrust to counteract both the drag from the wing and from the body as a whole. [[Pterosaur]] flight likely worked in a similar manner, though no living pterosaurs remain for study.

[[Insect flight]] is considerably different, due to their small size, rigid wings, and other anatomical differences. Turbulence and vortices play a much larger role in insect flight, making it even more complex and difficult to study than the flight of vertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Shizhao |last2=Zhang |first2=Xing |last3=He |first3=Guowei |last4=Liu |first4=Tianshu |title=Lift Enhancement by Dynamically Changing Wingspan in Forward Flapping Flight|date=Sep 2013|arxiv=1309.2726|doi=10.1063/1.4884130 |volume=26 |journal=Physics of Fluids |page=061903|bibcode=2014PhFl...26f1903W}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two basic aerodynamic models of insect flight. Most insects use a method that creates a spiralling [[leading edge]] [[vortex generator|vortex]].&lt;ref name="physics"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.physics.emory.edu/~weeks/lab/papers/jwang-arf05.pdf |title=DISSECTING INSECT FLIGHT |author=Wang, Z.

As they fling open, the air gets sucked in and creates a vortex over each wing. This bound vortex then moves across the wing and, in the clap, acts as the starting vortex for the other wing. Circulation and lift are increased, at the price of wear and tear on the wings.&lt;ref name="physics"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aerodynamics"/&gt;

==Limits and extremes==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2012}}

===Flying/soaring===
* Largest. The largest known flying animal was formerly thought to be ''[[Pteranodon]]'', a [[pterosaur]] with a wingspan of up to {{Convert|7.5|m}}. However, the more recently discovered [[azhdarchid]] pterosaur ''[[Quetzalcoatlus]]'' is much larger, with estimates of the wingspan ranging from {{Convert|9|to|12|m}}. Some other recently discovered azhdarchid pterosaur species, such as ''[[Hatzegopteryx]]'', may have also wingspans of a similar size or even slightly larger. Although it is widely thought that ''Quetzalcoatlus'' reached the size limit of a flying animal, it should be noted that the same was once said of ''Pteranodon''. The heaviest living flying animals are the [[kori bustard]] and the [[great bustard]] with males reaching {{Convert|21|kg}}. The [[wandering albatross]] has the greatest wingspan of any living flying animal at {{Convert|3.63|m}}. Among living animals which fly over land, the [[Andean condor]] and the [[marabou stork]] have the largest wingspan at {{Convert|3.2|m}}. Studies have shown{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} that it is physically possible for flying animals to reach {{Convert|18|m|adj=on}} wingspans, but there is no firm evidence that any flying animal, not even the azhdarchid pterosaurs, got that large.
* Smallest. There is no real minimum size for getting airborne. Indeed, there are many bacteria floating in the atmosphere that constitute part of the [[aeroplankton]]. However, to move about under one's own power and not be overly affected by the wind requires a certain amount of size. The smallest flying vertebrates are the [[bee hummingbird]] and the [[bumblebee bat]], both of which may weigh less than {{Convert|2|g}}. They are thought to represent the lower size limit for [[endotherm (biology)|endotherm]] flight.
* Fastest. The fastest of all known flying animals is the [[peregrine falcon]], which when diving travels at {{Convert|300|km/h}} or faster. The fastest animal in flapping horizontal flight may be the [[Mexican free-tailed bat]], said to attain about {{convert|160|km/h}} based on ground speed by an aircraft tracking device;&lt;ref name=McCracken&gt;{{cite journal |author1=McCracken, Gary F. |author2=Safi, Kamran |author3=Kunz, Thomas H. |author4=Dechmann, Dina K. N. |author5=Swartz, Sharon M. |author6=Wikelski, Martin |title=Airplane tracking documents the fastest flight speeds recorded for bats |url=http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/3/11/160398 |journal=Royal Society Open Science |date=9 November 2016 |doi=10.1098/rsos.160398 |volume=3 |page=160398|bibcode=2016RSOS....360398M }}&lt;/ref&gt; that measurement does not separate any contribution from wind speed, so the observations could be caused by strong [[tailwind]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Photopoulos |first1=Julianna |title=Speedy bat flies at 160km/h, smashing bird speed record|journal=New Scientist |date=9 November 2016 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2112044-speedy-bat-flies-at-160kmh-smashing-bird-speed-record/ |accessdate=11 November 2016 |quote=But not everyone is convinced. Graham Taylor at the University of Oxford says that errors in estimating bat speed by measuring the distance moved between successive positions could be huge. “So I think it would be premature to knock birds off their pedestal as nature's fastest fliers just yet,” he says."These bats are indeed flying very fast at times, but this is based on their ground speed," says Anders Hedenström at the University of Lund in Sweden. "Since they did not measure winds at the place and time where the bats are flying, one can therefore not exclude that the top speeds are not bats flying in a gust."}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Slowest. Most flying animals need to travel forward to stay aloft. However, some creatures can stay in the same spot, known as hovering, either by rapidly flapping the wings, as do [[hummingbird]]s, [[hoverfly|hoverflies]], [[dragonfly|dragonflies]], and some others, or carefully using thermals, as do some [[birds of prey]]. The slowest flying non-hovering bird recorded is the [[American woodcock]], at {{Convert|8|km/h}}.
* Highest flying. There are records of a [[Rüppell's vulture]] ''Gyps rueppelli'', a large vulture, being sucked into a jet engine {{Convert|11,550|m}} above [[Côte d'Ivoire]] in West Africa. The animal that flies highest most regularly is the [[bar-headed goose]] ''Anser indicus'', which [[Bird migration|migrate]]s directly over the [[Himalayas]] between its nesting grounds in [[Tibet]] and its winter quarters in [[India]]. They are sometimes seen flying well above the peak of [[Mount Everest]] at {{Convert|8,848|m}}.

===Gliding/parachuting===
* Most efficient glider. This can be taken as the animal that moves most horizontal distance per metre fallen. [[Flying squirrel]]s are known to glide up to {{Convert|200|m}}, but have measured [[glide ratio]] of about 2. [[Flying fish]] have been observed to glide for hundreds of metres on the drafts on the edge of waves with only their initial leap from the water to provide height, but may be obtaining additional lift from wave motion. On the other hand, [[albatross]]es have measured lift/drag ratios of 20,&lt;ref name=fili&gt;[http://www.sierrafoot.org/mather/fact_checks/lift_to_drag_ratios.html#table2 Fillipone]&lt;/ref&gt; and thus fall just 1 meter (foot) for every 20 in still air.
* Most maneuverable glider. Many gliding animals have some ability to turn, but which is the most maneuverable is difficult to assess. Even [[Chrysopelea paradisi|paradise tree snake]]s, [[Chinese gliding frog]]s, and [[gliding ant]]s have been observed as having considerable capacity to turn in the air.

==Extant flying and gliding animals==

===[[Invertebrates]]===

====[[Arthropods]]====
[[File:Beeinflightfromfront.jpg|thumb|right|A [[bee]] in flight.]]
* [[Insects]] (flying). The first of all animals to evolve flight, insects are also the only invertebrates that have evolved flight. The species are too numerous to list here. [[Insect flight]] is an active research field. 
** [[Gliding bristletail]]s (gliding). Directed aerial gliding descent is found in some tropical arboreal [[Archaeognatha|bristletails]], an ancestrally wingless sister taxa to the winged insects. The bristletails median caudal filament is important for the [[glide ratio]] and gliding control &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Yanoviak | first1=SP | last2=Kaspari | first2=M | last3=Dudley | first3=R | year=2009 | title=Gliding hexapods and the origins of insect aerial behaviour | url=| journal=Biology Letters | volume=5 | issue=4| pages=510–2 | doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.0029 | pmid=19324632 | pmc=2781901}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Gliding ant]]s (gliding). The flightless workers of these insects have secondarily gained some capacity to move through the air. Gliding has evolved independently in a number of arboreal ant species from the groups [[Cephalotini]], [[Pseudomyrmecinae]], and [[Formicinae]] (mostly ''[[Camponotus]]''). All arboreal [[dolichoderine]]s and non-cephalotine [[myrmicine]]s except ''[[Daceton armigerum]]'' do not glide. Living in the rainforest canopy like many other gliders, gliding ants use their gliding to return to the trunk of the tree they live on should they fall or be knocked off a branch. Gliding was first discovered for ''[[Cephalotes atreus]]'' in the [[Peru]]vian rainforest. ''Cephalotes atreus'' can make 180 degree turns, and locate the trunk using visual cues, succeeding in landing 80% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Yanoviak | first1=S.

** Gliding immature insects. The wingless immature stages of some insect species that have wings as adults may also show a capacity to glide. These include some species of [[cockroach]], [[mantid]], [[katydid]], [[stick insect]] and [[true bug]]. [http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/skydiving-spiders-discovered-in-south-america-115082100793_1.html]
* [[Spiders]]. Although typically flightless some may engage in aerial locomotion as described below.
**[[Ballooning (spider)|Ballooning spiders]] (parachuting). The young of some species of spiders travel through the air by using silk draglines to catch the wind, as may some smaller species of adult spider, such the [[money spider]] family. This behavior is commonly known as "ballooning". [[Ballooning (spider)|Ballooning spiders]] make up part of the [[aeroplankton]].
** [[Gliding spiders]] (gliding). Some species of arboreal spider of the genus ''[[Selenops]]'' can glide back to the trunk of a tree should they fall. [http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/skydiving-spiders-discovered-in-south-america-115082100793_1.html]

====[[Molluscs]]====
* [[Flying squid]] (gliding). Several oceanic [[squids]], such as the [[Todarodes pacificus|Pacific flying squid]], will leap out of the water to escape predators, an adaptation similar to that of [[flying fish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Packard|first=A.|title=Cephalopods and fish: the limits of convergence |journal=Biological Reviews |date=1972 |volume=47 |issue=2 |pages=241–307 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-185X.1972.tb00975.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller squids will fly in shoals, and have been observed to cover distances as long as {{Convert|50|m}}. Small fins towards the back of the mantle do not produce much lift, but do help stabilize the motion of flight. They exit the water by expelling water out of their funnel, indeed some squid have been observed to continue jetting water while airborne providing thrust even after leaving the water. This may make flying squid the only animals with jet-propelled aerial locomotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Maciá | first1=Silvia | last2=Robinson | first2=Michael P. | last3=Craze | first3=Paul | last4=Dalton | first4=Robert | last5=Thomas | first5=James D. | date=2004 | title=New observations on airborne jet propulsion (flight) in squid, with a review of previous reports | url=http://mollus.oxfordjournals.org/content/70/3/297.full.pdf+html | journal=Journal of Molluscan Studies | volume=70 | issue=3| pages=297–299 | doi=10.1093/mollus/70.3.297}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[neon flying squid]] has been observed to glide for distances over {{Convert|30|m|4=-1}}, at speeds of up to {{Convert|11.2|m/s}} [http://www.afp.com/en/news/topstories/it-bird-it-plane-no-its-squid].

===[[Vertebrates]]===

====[[Fish]]====
[[File:Band-wing flyingfish.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cheilopogon|Band-winged flying fish]], with enlarged [[pectoral fin]]s]]
* [[Flying fish]] (gliding). There are over 50 [[species]] of flying [[fish]] belonging to the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Exocoetidae]]. They are mostly [[marine (ocean)|marine]] fishes of small to medium size. The largest flying fish can reach lengths of {{Convert|45|cm}} but most species measure less than {{Convert|30|cm|abbr=on}} in length. They can be divided into two-winged varieties and four-winged varieties. Before the fish leaves the water it increases its speed to around 30 body lengths per second and as it breaks the surface and is freed from the drag of the water it can be traveling at around {{Convert|60|km/h}}.&lt;ref name="Piper 2007"&gt;[[Ross Piper|Piper, Ross]] (2007), ''Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals'', [[Greenwood Press (publisher)|Greenwood Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; The glides are usually up to {{Convert|30|-|50|m|-1}} in length, but some have been observed soaring for hundreds of metres using the updraft on the leading edges of waves. The fish can also make a series of glides, each time dipping the tail into the water to produce forward thrust. The longest recorded series of glides, with the fish only periodically dipping its tail in the water, was for 45 seconds (Video here &lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7410421.stm BBC NEWS | Science/Nature | Fast flying fish glides by ferry&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;). It has been suggested that the genus ''[[Exocoetus]]'' is on an evolutionary borderline between flight and gliding. It flaps its enlarged [[pectoral fin]]s when airborne, but still seems only to glide, as there is no hint of a power stroke.&lt;ref name="berkeley"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/vertebrates/flight/gliding.html | title=Vertebrate Flight: gliding and parachuting |accessdate=15 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been found that some flying fish can glide as effectively as some flying birds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/science/la-sci-flying-fish-20100911,0,2807712.story Flying fish perform as well as some birds - Los Angeles Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Halfbeak]]s (gliding). A group related to the Exocoetidae, one or two hemirhamphid species possess enlarged pectoral fins and show true gliding flight rather than simple leaps. Marshall (1965) reports that ''[[Euleptorhamphus viridis]]'' can cover {{Convert|50|m}} in two separate hops.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, N.B. (1965) The Life of Fishes. London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson. 402 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Freshwater butterflyfish]] (possibly gliding). ''Pantodon buchholzi'' has the ability to jump and possibly glide a short distance. It can move through the air several times the length of its body. While it does this, the fish flaps its large pectoral fins, giving it its common name.&lt;ref&gt;Berra, Tim M. (2001). ''Freshwater Fish Distribution''. San Diego: Academic Press. {{ISBN|0-12-093156-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is debated whether the freshwater butterfly fish can truly glide, Saidel et al. (2004) argue that it cannot.
* [[Freshwater hatchetfish]] (possibly flying). There are 9 species of freshwater hatchetfish split among 3 genera. Freshwater hatchetfish have an extremely large sternal region that is fitted with a large amount of muscle that allows it to flap its pectoral fins. They can move in a straight line over a few metres to escape predators {{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}.

====[[Amphibians]]====
Gliding has evolved independently in two families of tree frogs, the [[Old World]] Rhacophoridae and the [[New World]] Hylidae. Within each lineage there are a range of gliding abilities from non-gliding, to parachuting, to full gliding.
* [[Rhacophoridae]] [[flying frog]]s (gliding). A number of the Rhacophoridae, such as [[Wallace's flying frog]] (''Rhacophorus nigropalmatus''), have adaptations for gliding, the main feature being enlarged toe membranes. For example, the [[Malayan flying frog]] ''Rhacophorus prominanus'' glides using the membranes between the toes of its limbs, and small membranes located at the heel, the base of the leg, and the forearm. Some of the frogs are quite accomplished gliders, for example, the [[Chinese flying frog]] ''Rhacophorus dennysi'' can maneuver in the air, making two kinds of turn, either [[flight dynamics|roll]]ing into the turn (a [[banked turn]]) or [[flight dynamics|yaw]]ing into the turn (a [[crabbed turn]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=McKay | first1=M.

[[File:Ptychozoon kuhli underside cropped.JPG|thumb|right|The underside of [[Ptychozoon kuhli|Kuhl's flying gecko]] ''[[Ptychozoon kuhli]]''. Note the gliding adaptations: flaps of skin on the legs, feet, sides of the body, and on the sides of the head.]]

====[[Reptiles]]====
Several lizards and snakes are capable of gliding:

* [[Draco lizard|''Draco'' lizards]]. There are 28 species of [[lizard]] of the [[genus]] ''[[Draco lizard|Draco]]'', found in [[Sri Lanka]], [[India]], and [[Southeast Asia]]. They live in trees, feeding on tree ants, but nest on the forest floor. They can glide for up to {{Convert|60|m}} and over this distance they lose only {{Convert|10|m|4=-1}} in height.&lt;ref name="Piper 2007"/&gt; Unusually, their patagium (gliding membrane) is supported on elongated ribs rather than the more common situation among gliding [[vertebrate]]s of having the patagium attached to the limbs. When extended, the ribs form a semicircle on either side the lizard's body and can be folded to the body like a folding fan.
* [[Holaspis|Gliding lacertid]]s. There are two species of gliding [[lacertid]], of the genus ''[[Holaspis]]'', found in [[Africa]]. They have fringed toes and tail sides and can flatten their bodies for gliding/parachuting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_8150000/8150333.stm Tiny lizard falls like a feather]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ptychozoon|''Ptychozoon'' flying gecko]]s. There are six species of gliding gecko, of the genus ''[[Ptychozoon]]'', from Southeast Asia. These lizards have small flaps of skin along their limbs, torso, tail, and head that catch the air and enable them to glide.&lt;ref name="scienceblogs1"&gt;[http://scienceblogs.com/tetrapodzoology/2010/06/ptychozoon_parachute_geckos.php Ptychozoon: the geckos that glide with flaps and fringes (gekkotans part VIII) – Tetrapod Zoology&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Luperosaurus|''Lupersaurus'' flying gecko]]s. A possible sister-taxon to ''Ptychozoon'' which has similar flaps and folds and also glides.&lt;ref name="scienceblogs1"/&gt;
* [[Thecadactylus|''Thecadactylus'' flying gecko]]s. At least some species of ''Thecadactylus'', such as ''T. rapicauda'', are known to glide.&lt;ref name="scienceblogs1"/&gt;
* [[Cosymbotus|''Cosymbotus'' flying gecko]]. Similar adaptations to ''Ptychozoon'' are found in the two species of the gecko genus ''[[Cosymbotus]]''.
* ''[[Chrysopelea]]'' snakes. Five species of snake from Southeast Asia, [[Melanesia]], and [[India]]. The [[paradise tree snake]] of southern [[Thailand]], [[Malaysia]], [[Borneo]], [[Philippines]], and [[Sulawesi]] is the most capable glider of those snakes studied. It glides by stretching out its body sideways and opening its ribs so the belly is concave, and by making lateral slithering movements. It can remarkably glide up to {{Convert|100|m}} and make 90 degree turns.

====[[Birds]]====
{{Main|Bird flight}}
[[File:Flying mallard duck - female.jpg|thumb|right|Birds are a successful group of flying vertebrate.]]
* [[Bird]]s (flying, soaring) — Most of the approximately 10,000 living species can fly ([[flightless bird]]s are the exception). Bird flight is one of the most studied forms of aerial locomotion in animals. See [[List of soaring birds]] for birds that can soar as well as fly.

====[[Mammals]]====
[[Bat]]s are the only mammal with flapping or powered [[Bat flight|flight]].  A few other mammals glide or parachute; the best known are [[flying squirrel]]s and [[Colugo|flying lemur]]s.

* [[Bat]]s (flying). There are approximately 1,240 bat species, representing about 20% of all classified mammal species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Tudge | first=Colin | title=The Variety of Life | publisher=Oxford University Press | date=2000 | isbn=0-19-860426-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Flying squirrel]]s (subfamily [[Petauristinae]]) (gliding). There are 43 species divided between 14 genera of flying [[squirrel]]. Flying squirrels are found almost worldwide in tropical ([[Southeast Asia]], [[India]], and [[Sri Lanka]]), temperate, and even [[Arctic]] environments. They tend to be [[nocturnal]]. When a flying squirrel wishes to cross to a tree that is further away than the distance possible by jumping, it extends the cartilage spur on its elbow or wrist. This opens out the flap of furry skin (the [[patagium]]) that stretches from its wrist to its ankle. It glides spread-eagle and with its tail fluffed out like a parachute, and grips the tree with its claws when it lands. Flying squirrels have been reported to glide over {{Convert|200|m}}.
* [[Anomalure]]s or scaly-tailed flying squirrels (family [[Anomaluridae]]) (gliding). These brightly coloured African rodents are not squirrels but have evolved to a resemble flying squirrels by [[convergent evolution]]. There are seven species, divided in three genera. All but one species have gliding membranes between their front and hind legs. The genus ''Idiurus'' contains two particularly small species known as [[flying mice]], but similarly they are not true mice.
* [[Colugo]]s or "flying lemurs" (order [[Dermoptera]]) (gliding). There are two species of colugo. Despite their common name, colugos are not [[lemur]]s; true lemurs are [[primate]]s. Molecular evidence suggests that colugos are a [[sister group]] to primates; however, some mammalogists suggest they are a sister group to [[bat]]s. Found in Southeast Asia, the colugo is probably the mammal most adapted for gliding, with a patagium that is as large as geometrically possible. They can glide as far as {{Convert|70|m}} with minimal loss of height.
* [[Sifaka]], a type of lemur, and possibly some other primates (possible limited gliding/parachuting). A number of primates have been suggested to have adaptations that allow limited gliding and/or parachuting: sifakas, [[indri]]s, [[galago]]s and [[saki monkey]]s. Most notably, the sifaka, a type of [[lemur]], has thick hairs on its forearms that have been argued to provide drag, and a small membrane under its arms that has been suggested to provide lift by having aerofoil properties.&lt;ref name="darrennaish.blogspot.com"&gt;[http://darrennaish.blogspot.com/2006/09/literally-flying-lemurs-and-not.html Darren Naish: Tetrapod Zoology: Literally, flying lemurs (and not dermopterans)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://scienceblogs.com/tetrapodzoology/2010/08/literally_flying_lemurs.php Literally, flying lemurs (and not dermopterans) – Tetrapod Zoology&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100816034946/http://scienceblogs.com/tetrapodzoology/2010/08/literally_flying_lemurs.php |date=16 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Flying phalanger]]s or wrist-winged gliders (subfamily [[Petaurinae]]) (gliding). Possums&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/animals/GlidingPossums.htm Gliding Possums] &amp;mdash; Environment, New South Wales Government&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cronin, Leonard &amp;mdash; "''Key Guide to Australian Mammals''", published by Reed Books Pty.

Ltd., Sydney, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; found in [[Australia]], and [[New Guinea]]. The [[Patagium|gliding membranes]] are hardly noticeable until they jump. On jumping, the animal extends all four legs and stretches the loose folds of skin. The subfamily contains seven species. Of the six species in the genus ''[[Petaurus]]'', the [[sugar glider]] and the [[Biak glider]] are the most common species. The lone species in the genus ''[[Gymnobelideus]]'', [[Leadbeater's possum]] has only a vestigial gliding membrane.
* [[Petauroides volans|Greater glider]] (''Petauroides volans'') (gliding). The only species of the genus ''[[Petauroides]]'' of the family [[Pseudocheiridae]]. This [[marsupial]] is found in [[Australia]], and was originally classed with the flying phalangers, but is now recognised as separate. Its flying membrane only extends to the elbow, rather than to the wrist as in [[Petaurinae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Myers | first=Phil | url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Pseudocheiridae.html | title=Family Pseudocheiridae |accessdate=15 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Acrobatidae|Feather-tailed possum]]s (family [[Acrobatidae]]) (gliding). This family of [[marsupials]] contains two genera, each with one species. The [[feathertail glider]] (''Acrobates pygmaeus''), found in [[Australia]] is the size of a very small mouse and is the smallest mammalian glider. The [[feathertail possum]] (''Distoechurus pennatus'') is found in [[New Guinea]], but does not glide. Both species have a stiff-haired feather-like tail.

==Extinct flying and gliding animals==
[[File:Coloborhynchus piscator jconway.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pterosaur]]s included the largest known flying animals]]

===Reptiles===
* Extinct reptiles similar to ''Draco'' (gliding). There are a number of unrelated extinct lizard-like reptiles with similar "wings" to the ''Draco ''lizards. ''[[Icarosaurus]]'', ''[[Coelurosauravus]]'', ''[[Weigeltisaurus]]''&lt;!-- Palaeontology28:413 --&gt;, ''[[Mecistotrachelos]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/animals/070612_gliding_reptile.html Ancient Gliding Reptile Discovered | LiveScience&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Kuehneosaurus]]''. The largest of these, ''Kuehneosaurus'', has a wingspan of {{Convert|30|cm}}, and was estimated to be able to glide about {{Convert|30|m|sigfig=1}}.
* [[Sharovipterygidae]] (gliding). These strange reptiles from the Upper [[Triassic]] of Kyrgyzstan and [[Poland]] unusually had a membrane on their elongated hind limbs, extending their otherwise normal, [[flying-squirrel]]-like patagia significantly. The forelimbs are in contrast much smaller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1=J. | last1=Dzik | first2=Tomasz | last2=Sulej | title=An early Late Triassic long-necked reptile with a bony pectoral shield and gracile appendages | volume=64 | issue=4 | journal=Acta Palaeontologica Polonica | pages=805–823 | year=2016 | url=https://www.app.pan.pl/archive/published/app61/app002762016.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Longisquama insignis]]'' (possibly gliding/parachuting). This small reptile may have had long paired feather-like scales on its back, however it has been more recently argued that the scales form just a single dorsal frill. If paired, they may have been used for parachuting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Stauth | first=David | url=http://www.caf.wvu.edu/~rwhitmor/ornithology/Ancient%20feathered%20animal%20challenges%20dinosaur-bird%20link.htm | title=Ancient feathered animal challenges dinosaur-bird link | date=2000 | accessdate=15 April 2006 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040611055757/http://www.caf.wvu.edu/~rwhitmor/ornithology/Ancient%20feathered%20animal%20challenges%20dinosaur-bird%20link.htm | archivedate=11 June 2004 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Galaxy/8152/longisquama.html | title=Controversial Fossil Claimed to Sink Dinosaur-Bird Link |accessdate=15 April 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630141141/http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Galaxy/8152/longisquama.html|archivedate=2006-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Everything you can make out is consistent with it being a small, tree-living, gliding animal, which is precisely the thing you'd expect birds to evolve out of," says Larry Martin, senior curator at the Natural History Museum at the [[University of Kansas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newswise.com/articles/view/19479/ Dinosaur Profs Worlds Apart on Link to Birds&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Pterosaur]]s (flying). Pterosaurs were the first flying vertebrates, and are generally agreed to have been sophisticated flyers. They had large wings formed by a [[patagium]] stretching from the torso to a dramatically lengthened fourth finger. There were hundreds of species, most of which are thought to have been intermittent flappers, and many soarers. The largest known flying animals are pterosaurs.
* ''[[Hypuronector]]'' (gliding). This bizarre drepanosaur displays limb proportions, particularly the elongated forelimbs, that are consistent with a flying or gliding animal with [[patagia]].&lt;ref&gt;Renesto, S., Spielmann, J. A., Lucas, S. G., &amp; Spagnoli, G. T. (2010).

New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-avian dinosaurs===
* [[Theropod]]s (gliding/flying). There were several species of theropod [[dinosaur]] thought to be capable of gliding or flying, that are not classified as birds (though they are closely related). Some species (''[[Microraptor]] gui'', ''Microraptor zhaoianus'', ''[[Cryptovolans pauli]]'', and ''[[Changyuraptor]]'') have been found that were fully feathered on all four limbs, giving them four 'wings' that they are believed to have used for gliding or flying. One species, ''[[Deinonychus|Deinonychus antirrhopus]]'', may display partial volancy, with the young being capable of flight while the adults are flightless, a characteristic also seen in some modern birds like the [[Horned coot]] and the [[Flying steamer duck]].
* ''[[Yi (dinosaur)|Yi]]'' is unique among gliding dinosaurs for the development of membranous wings, unlike the feathered airfoils of other theropods. Much like modern anomalures it developed a bony rod to help support the wing, albeit on the wrist and not the elbow.

===Fish===
* [[Thoracopteridae]] (gliding) is a lineage of [[Triassic]] [[flying fish]]-like [[Perleidiformes]], having converted their pectoral and pelvic fins into broad wings very similar to those of their modern counterparts. The [[Ladinian]] genus ''[[Potanichthys]]'' is the oldest member of this clade, as well as the earliest aerial vertebrate known, suggesting that these fish began exploring aerial niches soon after the [[Permian-Triassic extinction event]].

===Mammals===
[[File:Volaticotherium.jpg|thumb|right|[[Volaticotheridae|Volaticotherids]] predate bats as mammalian aeronauts by at least 110 million years]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2210">The '''Fuji Bamboo Garden''' (富士竹類植物園 Fuji Chikurui Shokubutsuen?) is [[Japan]]’s only [[botanical garden]] specializing in [[bamboo]]. Fuji Bamboo Garden is located in [[Nagaizumi]], which is part of Japan's Shizuoka Prefecture (southwest of [[Tokyo]]). The garden is located at the base of [[Mount Fuji]], from where the garden's name originated. The garden occupies over 2 acres of land. Fuji Bamboo Garden is said to be the world’s largest collection of bamboo, holding more than 450 varieties of bamboo from all around the world. The garden contains approximately 100,000 bamboo plants. The types of bamboo in the garden range from [[black bamboo]] to [[moso bamboo]]. The garden has benches to sit on, as well as bamboo sheds each holding a special type of bamboo.

Fuji Bamboo Garden is not only a garden, but also has a museum full of  bamboo art and history brought from all over the world, such as musical instruments from [[Indonesi]]a, woven bamboo baskets from [[Africa]], blankets made from bamboo, bamboo fishing gear and even furniture made from bamboo. The garden also offers a small gift shop.

==History==
The garden was founded in 1955, although bamboo keepers were said to have started planting the garden sometime around 1951.

'''GMA News TV''' (GNTV) (visually rendered in its logo in all [[capital letter]]s) is a [[Commercial broadcasting|commercial broadcast]] [[television network]] in the [[Philippines]]. It is owned and operated by [[DWDB-TV|Citynet Network Marketing and Productions Inc.]], a wholly owned subsidiary of [[GMA Network, Inc.]], together with [[ZOE Broadcasting Network|ZOE Broadcasting Network Inc.]] (ZOE TV) of [[Jesus Is Lord Church]] leader [[Eddie Villanueva]] as its main content provider. Launched on February 28, 2011, GNTV is the second television network joint-ventured between ZOE and GMA after its predecessor [[Q (TV network)|QTV]], which in turn was launched in 2005. Its flagship station is [[DZOE-TV|DZOE-TV Channel 11]], a frequency currently owned by ZOE Broadcasting, and it is beamed through provincial relay stations run by GMA Network. Its studios are located at the 22/F Strata 2000 Building, F. Ortigas Jr. Road (formerly Emerald Avenue), [[Ortigas Center]], [[Pasig City]] and [[GMA Network Center]], [[EDSA (road)|EDSA]] corner Timog Avenue, [[Diliman]], [[Quezon City]]; with its transmitter facilities (also owned by ZOE-TV) located at [[Tower of Power (transmitter)|GMA Tower of Power]], Tandang Sora, Barangay Culiat, Quezon City.

==History==
GMA News TV was created as a replacement for "[[Q (TV network)|Q]]", a network which primarily featured imported dramas and lifestyle-oriented programming aimed towards women. Both GMA News TV and Q are products of an agreement between ZOE-TV and GMA's subsidiary Citynet in 2005, allowing the latter to lease the entire airtime of ZOE-TV Channel 11, in exchange of upgrading the former's facilities and a offpeak timeslot for its programs on Channel 11 and its affiliate [[GMA Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.philstar.com/business/2005/04/28/275585/gma-network-partners-zoe-broadcasting-channel-11|title=GMA Network partners with Zoe Broadcasting Channel 11|publisher=[[The Philippine Star]]|date=April 28, 2005|accessdate=April 28, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; GMA News TV was unveiled on February 7, 2011, and Q was discontinued on February 20, 2011 in preparation for the launch of the new service, which occurred on February 28, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pep.ph/guide/tv/7578/gma-network-launches-gma-news-tv-on-channel-11 PEP Entertainment Guide/Television&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gmanews.tv/story/212269/gma-network-launches-gma-news-tv GMA News Online, Business Top Stories&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/214089/gma-news-tv-goes-on-air GMA News TV goes on air] retrieved via www.gmanews.tv 02-28-2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3YoYOiPz84 GMA News TV Station ID 2011] retrieved via www.youtube.com via gmatv user 09-10-2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programming==
{{Main article|List of programs broadcast by GMA News TV|l1=List of programs broadcast by GMA News TV}}
Most of GMA News TV's programming consists of news, public affairs and sports programming produced by [[GMA News and Public Affairs]] including entertainment, lifestyle, cooking shows, talk shows, infotainment, local and foreign drama, comedy and reality series, travel, foreign animated series, infomercials and local and foreign movie blocks and additional programming produced by GMA Entertainment TV carried over from [[Q (TV network)|Q]].

As part of its agreement to operate [[DZOE-TV]] as a carrier of GMA News TV (dating back to the establishment of Q), it also airs religious programming produced by [[ZOE Broadcasting Network|ZOE]] during off-peak hours.

==International==
Later in 2011, GMA would also launch a 24-hour international feed of GMA News TV, as a compliment to its two other international channels ([[GMA Pinoy TV]] and [[GMA Life TV]]). It began to be offered as a preview channel in Australia on FetchTV, IPS/AccessTV in Japan, GUdTV in Guam and on [[OSN]], with an official launch planned for the third quarter of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/226308/business/gma-network-launches-third-international-channel|title=GMA Network launches third international channel|work=GMA News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmapinoytv.com.ph/ver1/article.php?aid=328|title=gmapinoytv.com.ph|work=gmapinoytv.com.ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmapinoytv.com.ph/ver1/article.php?aid=612|title=gmapinoytv.com.ph|work=gmapinoytv.com.ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/220742/business/earnings-gma-network-posts-18-growth-in-q1-revenues|title=EARNINGS: GMA Network posts 18% growth in Q1 revenues|work=GMA News Online|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822165431/http://www.gmanews.tv/story/220742/business/earnings-gma-network-posts-18-growth-in-q1-revenues|archivedate=2011-08-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ganga Talao''' (commonly known as '''Grand Bassin''') is a [[crater lake]] situated in a secluded mountain area in the district of [[Savanne]], deep in the heart of [[Mauritius]].  It is about 1800 feet above sea level. The first group of pilgrims who went to Ganga Talao were from the village of Triolet and it was led by Pandit Giri Gossayne from Terre Rouge in 1898.

It is considered the most sacred [[Hindu]] place in Mauritius&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationsonline.org/album/Mauritius/slides/Grand%20Bassin.html Bird's eye view]. Retrieved on 5 May 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sagar Shiv Mandir]] is located on the bank of the lake and is dedicated to [[Lord Shiva]]. There are temples dedicated to other Gods including Lord [[Hanuman]], Goddess [[Ganges in Hinduism|Ganga]], and Lord [[Ganesh]] along the Grand Bassin.  During [[Shivaratri]], many pilgrims in [[Mauritius]] walk bare feet from their homes to the lake.

==Etymology==
Ganga Talao literally means the 'Lake of Ganga'; an allusion to the Grand Bassin's symbolic connection with the Indian river [[Ganges|Ganga (Ganges)]]

== History ==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2018}}
In 1866, when Pandi Sanjibonlal came back to Mauritius after his first indentured contract was over, he came as a merchant via Reunion Island and brought with him the souvenir of Grand Bassin and cloth from India to be sold to the resident labourers. With the money gained, he bought the mansion of Mr Langlois at Triolet and materialised his dream of making Grand bassin a pilgrimage place. The Hindus believe firmly that they should, as often as possible, visit and take a bath in the Ganga to celebrate the main festival of Shiva. Panditji had already won esteem of the French as a landowner, so he easily got permission to go on his project.

During his stay as indentured labourer he had spotted the divine appeal of Grand Bassin. He converted the existing building into a temple and after some problems with the law he was allowed to proceed with the changes. Some artisans who were engaged in building Sockalingam Meenatchee Ammen Kovil in Port Louis helped in giving the temple the present shape. He went to India and brought back a huge Shivalingam, along with other deities, and had them consecrated in the sanctorium. The only temple in Mauritius where Bhairo Baba (a deity in the form of a dog) is consecrated inside a temple along with Shiva parivar. He was the first to start the pilgrimage towards Grand Bassin following the consecration in 1866. The consecration was a huge festival where he donated land, cart with oxen and huge amount of money to the officiating priests (Caturvedi and others from Plaine des Papayes.

Others could not go save his servants because the labourers were not allowed to take leave for religious purposes.  Through word of mouth all labourers stated their wish to participate. He used his contacts and requested for permission. A first delegation headed by himself and some other rich retired labourers including Jhummun Gosagne Napal accompanied him in 1895, following the route he had already made in previous years when only his close friends have been there. The first halt was in Port Louis Madras road where he possessed a house. From there the next resting place was Vacoas at Padarath Ojha's place and then the procession with jhal and dholak and small kanvars moved to Grand Bassin. This was the nth time that Shivaratri was celebrated at Triolet under the priestship of Pandit Sanjibonlal.

In the meantime, other folk tales were added to that place and it got the name of Paritalao. It was believed that fairies used to come and dance during the night there. So, it is Sanajibonlall also popularly known as Mousse Langlois ke Baba who put dreams of Ganga in the subconscious mind of Jhummun Gossagne and helped to make the festival look as it is celebrated today. Later Prime Minister Ramgoolam brought Ganga water from Gomukh and mixed it with the already pure water of Grand Bassin and renamed it Ganga talao.

In 1897 Shri Jhummon Giri Gosagne Napal, a ‘pujari’ (priest) of Triolet together with a 'pujari' priest from Goodlands Sri Mohanparsad saw in a dream the water of the lake of Grand Bassin springing from the ‘Jahnvi’, thus forming part of Ganga. The news of the dream spread rapidly and created quite a stir in the Hindu community. The following year, pilgrims trekked to Grand Bassin to collect its water to offer to Lord Shiva on the occasion of Maha Shivaratri. The lake was then known as the ‘Pari Talao’. In 1998 it was declared a "sacred lake". In 1972, some holy water from the Ganges River was mixed  establishing a symbolic link with the sacred Indian River  and the lake was renamed Ganga Talao.&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120230417/http://whc.unesco.org/en/349/|date=January 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Events ==
During the Maha Shivaratri most of the devotees leave their homes and start a journey to Grand Bassin on foot. It has been a tradition that volunteer people offer foods and drinks to the pilgrims ''(the devotees)''.

== Mangal Mahadev - Shiva Statue ==
{{dablink|For the main article see [[Mangal Mahadev]]}}
Mangal Mahadev is {{convert|33|m|abbr=on}}-tall statue of the Hindu god, [[Shiva]], standing with his [[trident]] at the entrance of Ganga Talao. Inaugurated in 2007, it is the tallest statue in Mauritius and a faithful copy of the Shiva statue in [[Sursagar Lake]] in [[Vadodara|Vadodara,Gujarat]] in India. 

== Durga Mata Murti and Shiva Murti ==
The statues are of 108 ft tall. Durga Pooja and Navaratri are celebrated very grandly with many Hindu Mauritians assembling near the statue for the grand celebrations. 

Shiva Ratri is also celebrated very grandly and it is a national holiday. Very auspicious day to hindus at Mauritius.

[[Image:Garrigue 2007-09-20.JPG|thumb|250px|Garigue, in [[France]].]]
'''Garigue''' or '''phrygana''' is a type of low, soft-leaved [[scrubland]] [[ecoregion]] and [[plant community]] in the [[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub]] [[biome]].

It is found on [[limestone]] soils in [[southern France]] and around the [[Mediterranean Basin]], generally near the seacoast where the moderated [[Mediterranean climate]] provides annual summer [[drought]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The term has also found its way into [[haute cuisine]], suggestive of the resinous flavours of a garigue [[shrubland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saultenprovence.com/GB/ProduitsDetail.asp?IdProduit=34 Bienvenue sur le site officiel de l'office de tourisme de la région de Sault&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061021002854/http://www.saultenprovence.com/GB/ProduitsDetail.asp?IdProduit=34 |date=2006-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitat and vegetation==
[[File:Garrigue herault.jpg|thumb|250px|Garigue in [[Languedoc]], [[Occitanie]].]]
[[Image:Cistus-and-Senecio.JPG|thumb|250px|''[[Cistus]]'' and ''[[Senecio]]'' are characteristic plants of the garigue.]]
UNEP World Conservation Monitoring Centre described garigue as "discontinuous bushy associations of the Mediterranean [[calcareous]] [[plateau]]s, which have relatively [[alkaline soil]]s. It is often composed of [[kermes oak]], [[lavender]], [[thyme]], and white [[cistus]]. There may be a few isolated trees."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unep-wcmc.org/forest/eu_gap/Technical%20Report.pdf UNEP World Conservation Monitoring Centre, "European Forests and Protected Areas: Gap Analysis", 2000] (pdf file)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Renault, J.-M. (2000): La Garrigue - grandeur nature. - Barcelona: Les créations du Pélican.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hubert Delobette, Alice Dorques, ''Trésors retrouvés de la garrigue'', Le Papillon Rouge Éditeur, 2003 {{ISBN|2-9520261-0-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garigue is discontinuous with widely spaced bush associations with open spaces, and is often extensive. It is associated with limestone and base rich soils, and calcium associated plants.

Aside from dense thickets of kermes oak that punctuate the garigue landscape, [[juniper]] and stunted [[holm oak]]s are the typical trees; aromatic lime-tolerant shrubs such as [[lavender]], [[Salvia officinalis|sage]], [[rosemary]], [[wild thyme]] and ''[[Artemisia (plant)|Artemisia]]'' are common garigue plants.

===Allelopathy===
The aromatic oils and soluble [[monoterpene]]s of such herbs leached into garigue soils from [[leaf litter]] have been connected with plant [[allelopathy]], which asserts the dominance of a plant over its neighbors, especially [[annual (plant)|annuals]], and contributes to the characteristic open spacing and restricted [[flora]] in a garigue.&lt;ref&gt;John D. Thompson, ''Plant Evolution in the Mediterranean'' (2005:148ff).&lt;/ref&gt; The fines (charred wood and smoke residues, or [[charcoal]] dust) of periodic brush fires also have had an effect on the patterning and composition of the garigues. Clear summer skies and intense [[solar radiation]] have induced the evolution of protective physiologies: the familiar glaucous, grayish-green of garigue landscapes is produced by the protective white hairs and light-diffusing, pebbled surfaces of many leaves typical of garigue plants.

==Similar ecoregions==
''garigue'' is a common general word for the shrubland  [[habitat]] [[ecosystem]]s in southern France along with [[Maquis shrubland|maquis]], which are known elsewhere in the [[Mediterranean region]] as [[matorral]] and ''tomillares'' in Spain, [[macchia]] in Italy, ''phrygana'' in Greece, ''garig'' in Croatia, and ''batha'' in Israel.

In [[California chaparral and woodlands|California]] a similar Mediterranean climate [[ecoregion]] is named [[chaparral]]; in [[Chile]] it is named the [[Chilean Matorral|Chilean matorral]];  in [[South Africa]] it is named [[fynbos]]; and in [[Western Australia|Australia]] it is named [[Esperance Mallee|mallee]]. All are in the Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub biome.

===Maquis===
Both garigue and maquis are associated with the [[Mediterranean climate]] within the [[Mediterranean region]]. However, the distinction is not clear and term use is inconsistent.

[[Maquis shrubland]] is broadly similar to garigue, but the vegetation is more dense, being composed of numerous closely spaced shrubs. Maquis is associated with siliceous (acid) soils, unlike the relatively alkaline [[calcareous]] soils of the garigue. Its plant communities are often suites associated with [[holm oak]]. [[Calcifuges]] such as ''[[Erica]]'' and ''[[Calluna]]'' are present in the maquis [[ecoregion]].

==Conservation==
[[Deforestation]] of the indigenous oak forest since the [[Late Bronze Age]], for cultivation of [[olive]]s, [[viticulture|vines]] and grain, the introduction of sheep and especially goats and charcoal-making for heat and iron-working, exposed the land surface to weathering and resulted in [[erosion]] of the topsoil.&lt;ref&gt;Braudel, Fernand. ''The Mediterranean in the Age of Philip II''&lt;/ref&gt;   The wild garigue, then, is a man-formed landscape. The intensity of grazing pressure has had a direct response in the [[ecotope]], reflected today in the decline of goat-pasturing.&lt;ref&gt;Z. Henkin ''et al.'', "Suitability of Mediterranean oak woodland for beef herd husbandry" ''Agriculture, Ecosystems &amp; Environment'' '''109'''.3/4, (September 2005:255-261).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the word==
First cited in the [[French language]] in 1546, the singular word ''garigue'' is borrowed from the Provençal dialect of Occitan ''garriga,'' equivalent to [[old French]] ''jarrie.'' Etymologist Oscar Bloch states that it is most likely related to the Gascon ''carroc,'' meaning ''rock'' and to the Germanic Swiss ''Karren,'' a kind of [[sedimentary rock]]. These related words could stem from a supposed ''carra,'' or ''rock,'' which could be a remnant of a pre-Latin language, to judge from its geographic distribution even before Celtic times, and possibly akin to Basque ''*karr-'', ''harri'', 'rock'.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, Oscar, ''Dictionnaire étymologique de la langue française,'' p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that Gallic and Latin incorporated these words and then transmitted them in various forms to the [[Romance languages]].&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, Oscar: "Garrigue," page 270, ''Dictionnaire Etymologique,'' Paris, 1950&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

===Cultivation===
The dense, thrifty growth of garigue flora has recommended many of its shrubs and [[Subshrub|sub-shrubs]] for uses as [[ornamental plant]]s in traditional and [[xeriscape|drought tolerant garden]]s. Many shrubs and flowering perennials of the garigue are mainstays of the English "mixed border" of herbaceous and [[woody plant]]s found in [[English garden]]s, and around the world, though often grown under cooler, moister conditions.

Some have become [[invasive species]] in the [[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub]] biome's other ecoregions beyond the Mediterranean Basin on other continents, including the [[California chaparral and woodlands]].

===Viticulture===
Grapes that are grown in the ''garigues'' region of France are said to produce [[French wine|wines]] with a "barnyard" or "earthy" tone, or "the herbal scent of lavender that fills the hills of Provence in the summer time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2828">The '''Global Change Master Directory''' is a directory of Earth Science data sets and related tools/services, many of which are targeted for the use, analysis, and display of the data.    The directory holds  more than 28,000 data set descriptions, known as DIFs (Directory Interchange Format).  This format is compatible with the Federal Geographic Data Committee's (FGDC) standard and the international ISO 19115 standard.  More than 2,500 descriptions of tools and services, known as SERFs (Services Entry Resource Format), are also available to users.  The purpose of the directory is to provide users with information on the availability of data and services that will meet their needs, along with efficient access to those data and services.  Links are provided, when available, to connect directly to the data or services of interest.

The directory is part of [[NASA]]'s Earth Observing System Data and Information System ([[EOSDIS]]) and also serves as NASA's contribution to the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS), through which it is also known as the International Directory Network  [http://idn.ceos.org (IDN)]. The international participants contribute descriptions of data and services that are held around the world and have provided valuable guidance in the development and direction of the project over the years.

The directory also offers an online [[metadata]] authoring tools for those wishing to share knowledge of available data.   One of the cornerstones to effective searches within the directory is  twelve sets of controlled keywords that assist in normalizing the search.   The development of these keywords was initiated over a decade ago.  Currently, over 7,000 keywords are controlled, with new sets created for better search refinements, as time permits.   The keyword sets are widely used throughout the world and are being translated into many languages.  Within the GCMD and the IDN, these controlled keywords can be used in combination with a full-text search engine and also for search refinements.

In addition, virtual subsets of the directory can be created as [http://gcmd.nasa.gov/collaborate/portals.html "portals"] for groups wishing to identify their contributions or for those wishing to select a subset for their special interest group.  The directory currently receives approximately 8 million hits per month.

[[File:Alternative Energies.jpg|thumb|The [[wind]], [[Sun]], and [[biomass]] are three renewable energy sources]]
'''''Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy''''' is a 2007 book by Australian academic [[Mark Diesendorf]].  The book puts forward a set
of policies and strategies for implementing the most promising [[clean energy]] technologies by all spheres of government, business and community organisations. ''Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy'' suggests that a mix of [[efficient energy use]], [[renewable energy]] sources and [[natural gas]] (as a transitional fuel) offers a clean and feasible energy future for Australia.&lt;ref name=unsw&gt;UNSW Press. [http://www.sustainabilitycentre.com.au/GreenhouseFlyer.pdf : Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829114459/http://www.sustainabilitycentre.com.au/GreenhouseFlyer.pdf |date=2007-08-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and themes==
The book is a comprehensive guide to sustainable energy systems&lt;ref name=on&gt;[http://www.foe.org.au/resources/chain-reaction/chain-reaction-editions/chain-reaction-100/book-reviews  Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy: Review by Patrick O'Neill] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070905055607/http://www.foe.org.au/resources/chain-reaction/chain-reaction-editions/chain-reaction-100/book-reviews |date=2007-09-05 }} ''Chain Reaction 100'', August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and is structured in three sections:
* Introduction to the basic concepts and latest scientific evidence regarding global warming.
* Assessment of energy technologies, including coal, nuclear and more sustainable alternatives.
* Discussion of policies and strategies needed to overcome the non-technical barriers to renewable energies and energy efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publish.csiro.au/?act=view_file&amp;file_id=EC137p31a.pdf Scientific approach to an emotional – and political – issue] ''ECOS'', June–July 2007, p.31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diesendorf argues that:

* Ecologically sustainable energy technologies based on energy efficiency, renewable energy and natural gas are commercially available today, and that their implementation could halve Australia’s [[greenhouse gas emissions]] within a few decades.
* To implement these technologies, new policies must be developed and implemented by all three levels of government.
* The main barriers are neither technical nor economic, but rather our social institutions and the political power of the big greenhouse gas emitting industries: coal, oil, aluminium, cement and motor vehicles.&lt;ref name=unsw/&gt;

==Wind power variability==
Early in his career, Mark Diesendorf was a principal research scientist with [[CSIRO]] where he was involved in early research on integrating [[wind power]] into electricity grids.  This issue is discussed in some detail in ''Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy''.

Diesendorf explains that large-scale wind power is not "intermittent", because it does not start up or switch off instantaneously.  In practice, the variations in thousands of wind turbines, spread out over several different sites and wind regimes, are smoothed.  As the distance between sites increases, the correlation between wind speeds measured at those sites, decreases.  This has been confirmed recently by studies conducted by [[Graham Sinden]] from [[Oxford University]]:&lt;ref name = nine&gt;Diesendorf, Mark (2007). ''Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy'', p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[Graham Sinden] analysed over 30 years of hourly wind speed data from 66 sites spread out over the United Kingdom.  He found that the correlation coefficient of wind power fell from 0.6 at 200 km to 0.25 at 600 km separation (a perfect correlation would have a coefficient equal to 1.0.) There were no hours in the data set where wind speed was below the cut-in wind speed of a modern wind turbine throughout the United Kingdom, and low wind speed events affecting more than 90 per cent of the United Kingdom had an average recurrent rate of only one hour per year.&lt;ref name = nine/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Diesendorf goes on to say that every conventional power station breaks down unexpectedly from time to time, causing an immediate loss of all its power.  That is true intermittency, according to Diesendorf, and it is a particular type of variability that switches between full power and no power.  Once a conventional power station has broken down, it may be offline for weeks, much longer than windless periods.&lt;ref&gt;Diesendorf, Mark (2007). ''Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy'', p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotes==

* "The enhanced greenhouse effect is arguably the most dangerous environmental problem and the most difficult political issue to be faced by the world in the 21st century." (p.&amp;nbsp;1)
* "The recent push for a revival of nuclear energy has been based on its claimed reduction in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions where it substitutes for coal-fired power stations.  In reality, only reactor operation is CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-free.  All other stages of the nuclear fuel chain -- mining, milling, fuel fabrication, enrichment, reactor construction, decommissioning, and waste management -- use fossil fuels and hence emit CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;..." (p.&amp;nbsp;252)
* "Global wind-power capacity continues to expand and, apart from the blip in 2006, its costs continue to decline steadily.  Wind power is one of the few energy supply technologies that are ready for wide dissemination today, unlike coal with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture and sequestration and unlike nuclear power.  Wind can deliver deep cuts in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, while providing a hedge against fluctuating fossil fuel prices and reducing energy import dependence." (p.&amp;nbsp;126)

==Critical reception==

Dick Nichols, in ''Green Left'', states that ''Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy'' brings together much useful material about global warming and possible solutions:

: Diesendorf's book concentrates into one volume a succinct analysis of global warming, a rebuttal of climate change scepticism, a thorough summary of the state of development of each renewable energy technology, a masterly demolition of false “solutions” to greenhouse (like [[carbon sequestration]] and nuclear power) and a presentation of strategies and policies for uprooting carbon-intensive power production in Australia.  Add in chapters on saving energy and transport and urban redesign and ''Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy'' illuminates the reader about all the main features of the many-sided debate on how to make sustainable energy production the heart of the attack on climate change.&lt;ref&gt;Dick Nichols, [http://www.greenleft.org.au/2008/745/38612 How can sustainable energy solve greenhouse?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204143908/http://www.greenleft.org.au/2008/745/38612 |date=2008-12-04 }} ''Green Left'', 5 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nichols suggests that if there’s one serious shortcoming in ''Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy'' it’s "a failure to consistently trace what rate of implementation of energy efficiency and uptake of renewable energy sources is necessary to confront the greenhouse emergency".

Patrick O'Neill, in ''Chain Reaction'',  suggests that ''Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy'' is a comprehensive guide to sustainable energy systems, and that the book is "simply a joy to read".  O'Neill explains that whilst an immense amount of technical and scientific detail is presented, the language is simple and the book is well laid out. It also covers often ignored areas of the sustainable energy discussion such as population issues, morality, social justice and equity. In conclusion, O'Neill states that the book is a "wonderfully energising piece of sedition", which calls for a "coordinated national strategy for non-violent action".&lt;ref name=on/&gt;

George Wilkenfield, in ''Australian Review of Public Affairs'', is more critical and suggests the book feels "strangely anachronistic", partly because it treats climate change as an issue that can be resolved through grassroots activism or by the opposition of protest movements to unjust regimes. Wilkenfield explains that "this rather misses the point that the continuing rise in global greenhouse gas emissions is not a byproduct of injustice or repression but of economic freedom in the West and the unrelenting economic growth by which repressive regimes such as China’s buy legitimacy. In general, very few people want to be freed from consumption—most want the freedom to consume even more".  Wilkenfield goes on to say that Diesendorf misses some of the dynamics of consumption: energy use gives people comfort, speed, privacy and convenience. Many people actually enjoy driving and like their cars, and would continue to use them as long as they could afford to, even if public transport were available.&lt;ref name=george&gt;George Wilkenfield, [http://www.australianreview.net/digest/2007/08/wilkenfeld.html Cutting greenhouse emissions—What would we do if we really meant it?] ''Australian Review of Public Affairs'', August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, in the end, Wilkenfield concedes that ''Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy'' is very suitable as a textbook, or as a handbook for activists, journalists or the more committed reader who is not afraid of numbers.&lt;ref name=george/&gt;

[[Image:InternalWaves Gibraltar ISS009-E-09952 54.jpg|thumb|250px|'''Internal wave'''s (marked with arrows) caused by tidal flow through the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] and made visible by sea surface roughness enhance sunlight backscatter]]
'''Internal waves''' are [[gravity wave]]s that [[oscillation|oscillate]] within a fluid medium, rather than on its surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2274199/Caught-camera-Huge-UNDERWATER-wave-spanning-hundreds-miles-observed-International-Space-Station.html|title=Caught on camera: Huge UNDERWATER wave spanning hundreds of miles observed from the International Space Station|author=|date=|website=dailymail.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; To exist, the fluid must be [[stratification (water)|stratified]]: the density must decrease continuously or discontinuously with depth/height due to changes, for example, in temperature and/or salinity. If the density changes over a small vertical distance (as in the case of the [[thermocline]] in lakes and oceans or an [[atmospheric inversion]]), the waves propagate horizontally like surface waves, but do so at slower speeds as determined by the density difference of the fluid below and above the interface. If the density changes continuously, the waves can propagate vertically as well as horizontally through the fluid.

Internal waves, also called internal gravity waves, go by many other names depending upon the fluid stratification, generation mechanism, amplitude, and influence of external forces. If propagating horizontally along an interface where the density rapidly decreases with height, they are specifically called interfacial (internal) waves. If the interfacial waves are large amplitude they are called internal solitary waves or internal [[soliton]]s. If moving vertically through the atmosphere where substantial changes in air density influences their dynamics, they are called anelastic (internal) waves. If generated by flow over topography, they are called [[Lee waves]] or [[mountain waves]]. If the mountain waves break aloft, they can result in strong warm winds at the ground known as [[Chinook winds]] (in North America) or [[Foehn]] winds (in Europe). If generated in the ocean by tidal flow over submarine ridges or the continental shelf, they are called internal tides. If they evolve slowly compared to the Earth's rotational frequency so that their dynamics are influenced by the [[Coriolis effect]], they are called [[inertia gravity waves]] or, simply, [[inertial waves]]. Internal waves are usually distinguished from [[Rossby wave]]s, which are influenced by the change of [[Coriolis frequency]] with latitude.

==Visualization of internal waves==
An internal wave can readily be observed in the kitchen by slowly tilting back and forth a bottle of salad dressing - the waves exist at the interface between oil and vinegar.

Atmospheric internal waves can be visualized by [[wave cloud]]s: at the wave crests air rises and cools in the relatively lower pressure, which can result in water vapor condensation if the [[relative humidity]] is close to 100%. Clouds that reveal internal waves launched by flow over hills are called [[lenticular clouds]] because of their lens-like appearance. Less dramatically, a train of internal waves can be visualized by rippled cloud patterns described as [[herringbone sky]] or [[mackerel sky]]. The outflow of cold air from a thunderstorm can launch large amplitude internal solitary waves at an [[atmospheric inversion]]. In northern Australia, these result in [[Morning Glory cloud]]s, used by some daredevils to glide along like a surfer riding an ocean wave. Satellites over Australia and elsewhere reveal these waves can span many hundreds of kilometers.
&lt;!-- [[Image:permissions pending...|thumbnail|A train of internal waves propagating over the [[Gulf of Mexico]] after being launched at an [[atmospheric inversion]] by cold-air outflows from a thunderstorm over Texas. The crests of the waves are visualized by clouds.]] --&gt;

Undulations of the oceanic thermocline can be visualized by satellite because the waves increase the surface roughness where the horizontal flow converges, and this increases the scattering of sunlight (as in the image at the top of this page showing of waves generated by tidal flow through the [[Strait of Gibraltar]]).

==Buoyancy, reduced gravity and buoyancy frequency==
According to [[Archimedes principle]], the weight of an immersed object is reduced by the weight of fluid it displaces. This holds for a fluid parcel of density &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; surrounded by an ambient fluid of density &lt;math&gt;\rho_0&lt;/math&gt;. Its weight per unit volume is &lt;math&gt;g(\rho-\rho_0)&lt;/math&gt;, in which &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the acceleration of gravity. Dividing by a characteristic density, &lt;math&gt;\rho_{00}&lt;/math&gt;, gives the definition of the reduced gravity:

:&lt;math&gt;g^\prime \equiv g \frac{\rho-\rho_0}{\rho_{00}}&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;\rho&gt;\rho_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g^\prime&lt;/math&gt; is positive though generally much smaller than &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;. Because water is much more dense than air, the displacement of water by air from a surface [[gravity wave]] feels nearly the full force of gravity (&lt;math&gt;g^\prime \sim g&lt;/math&gt;). The displacement of the [[thermocline]] of a lake, which separates warmer surface from cooler deep water, feels the buoyancy force expressed through the reduced gravity. For example, the density difference between ice water and room temperature water is 0.002 the characteristic density of water. So the reduced gravity is 0.2% that of gravity. It is for this reason that internal waves move in slow-motion relative to surface waves.

Whereas the reduced gravity is the key variable describing buoyancy for interfacial internal waves, a different quantity is used to describe buoyancy in continuously stratified fluid whose density varies with height as &lt;math&gt;\rho_0(z)&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose a water column is in [[hydrostatic balance|hydrostatic equilibrium]] and a small parcel of fluid with density &lt;math&gt;\rho_0(z_0)&lt;/math&gt; is displaced vertically by a small distance &lt;math&gt;\Delta z&lt;/math&gt;. The [[buoyancy|buoyant]] restoring force results in a vertical acceleration, given by &lt;ref name=Tritton&gt;{{harv|Tritton|1990|pages = 208–214}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sutherland&gt;(Sutherland 2010, pp 141-151)&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2 \Delta z}{dt^2} = - g^\prime = - g (\rho_0(z_0)-\rho_0(z_0+\Delta z))/\rho_0(z_0) \simeq - g \left(-\frac{d\rho_0}{dz} \Delta z\right)/\rho_0(z_0)&lt;/math&gt;

This is the spring equation whose solution predicts oscillatory vertical displacement about &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; in time about with frequency given by the [[Brunt–Väisälä frequency|buoyancy frequency]]:

:&lt;math&gt; N = \left(-\frac{g}{\rho_0} \frac{d\rho_0}{dz}\right)^{1/2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The above argument can be generalized to predict the frequency, &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;, of a fluid parcel that oscillates along a line at an angle &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt; to the vertical:

:&lt;math&gt;\omega = N \cos\Theta&lt;/math&gt;.

This is one way to write the dispersion relation for internal waves whose lines of constant phase lie at an angle &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt; to the vertical. In particular, this shows that the [[Brunt–Väisälä frequency|buoyancy frequency]] is an upper limit of allowed internal wave frequencies.

==Mathematical modeling of internal waves==

The theory for internal waves differs in the description of interfacial waves and vertically propagating internal waves. These are treated separately below.

===Interfacial waves===

In the simplest case, one considers a two-layer fluid in which a slab of fluid with uniform density &lt;math&gt;\rho_1&lt;/math&gt; overlies a slab of fluid with uniform density &lt;math&gt;\rho_2&lt;/math&gt;. Arbitrarily the interface between the two layers is taken to be situated at &lt;math&gt;z=0.&lt;/math&gt; The fluid in the upper and lower layers are assumed to be [[flow velocity#irrotational flow|irrotational]]. So the velocity in each layer is given by the gradient of a [[velocity potential]], &lt;math&gt;{\vec{u}=\nabla\phi,}&lt;/math&gt; and the potential itself satisfies [[Laplace's equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2\phi=0.&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming the domain is unbounded and two-dimensional (in the &lt;math&gt;x-z&lt;/math&gt; plane), and assuming the wave is [[periodic function|periodic]] in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; with [[wavenumber]] &lt;math&gt;k&gt;0,&lt;/math&gt; the equations in each layer reduces to a second-order ordinary differential equation in &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;. Insisting on bounded solutions the velocity potential in each layer is

:&lt;math&gt;\phi_1(x,z,t) = A e^{-kz} \cos(kx - \omega t)&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_2(x,z,t) = A e^{kz} \cos(kx - \omega t),&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; the [[amplitude]] of the wave and &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; its [[angular frequency]]. In deriving this structure, matching conditions have been used at the interface requiring continuity of mass and pressure. These conditions also give the [[dispersion (water waves)|dispersion relation]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=O.M. | last=Phillips | title=The dynamics of the upper ocean | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1977 | edition=2nd | isbn=978-0-521-29801-8 | oclc=7319931 | page=37 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\omega^2 = g^\prime k&lt;/math&gt;

in which the reduced gravity &lt;math&gt;g^\prime&lt;/math&gt; is based on the density difference between the upper and lower layers:

:&lt;math&gt;g^\prime = \frac{\rho_2-\rho_1}{\rho_2+\rho_1}\, g,&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; the [[Earth's gravity]]. Note that the dispersion relation is the same as that for deep water [[surface ocean wave|surface waves]] by setting &lt;math&gt;g^\prime=g.&lt;/math&gt;

===Internal waves in uniformly stratified fluid===

The structure and dispersion relation of internal waves in a uniformly stratified fluid is found through the solution of the linearized conservation of mass, momentum, and internal energy equations assuming the fluid is incompressible and the background density varies by a small amount (the [[Boussinesq approximation (water waves)|Boussinesq approximation]]). Assuming the waves are two dimensional in the x-z plane, the respective equations are

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_x u + \partial_z w = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\rho_{00} \partial_t u = - \partial_x p&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\rho_{00} \partial_t w = - \partial_z p - \rho g&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\partial_t \rho = -w d\rho_0/dz&lt;/math&gt;

in which &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the perturbation density, &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the pressure, and &lt;math&gt;(u,w)&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity. The ambient density changes linearly with height as given by &lt;math&gt;\rho_0(z)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\rho_{00}&lt;/math&gt;, a constant, is the characteristic ambient density.

Solving the four equations in four unknowns for a wave of the form &lt;math&gt;\exp[i(kx+mz-\omega t)]&lt;/math&gt; gives the dispersion relation

:&lt;math&gt;\omega^2 = N^2 \frac{k^2}{k^2+m^2} = N^2 \cos^2\Theta&lt;/math&gt;

in which &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Brunt–Väisälä frequency|buoyancy frequency]] and &lt;math&gt;\Theta=\tan^{-1}(m/k)&lt;/math&gt; is the angle of the wavenumber vector to the horizontal, which is also the angle formed by lines of constant phase to the vertical.

The [[phase velocity]] and [[group velocity]] found from the dispersion relation predict the unusual property that they are perpendicular and that the vertical components of the phase and group velocities have opposite sign: if a wavepacket moves upward to the right, the crests move downward to the right.

==Internal waves in the ocean==
[[File:ISS034-E-032377annotated.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Internal Wave trains around Trinidad, as seen from space]]
Most people think of waves as a surface phenomenon, which acts between water (as in lakes or oceans) and the air. Where low density water overlies high density water in the [[ocean]], internal waves propagate along the boundary. They are especially common over the [[continental shelf]] regions of the world oceans and where [[brackish]] water overlies salt water at the outlet of large rivers. There is typically little surface expression of the waves, aside from slick bands that can form over the trough of the waves.

Internal waves are the source of a curious phenomenon called '''[[dead water]]''', first reported in 1893 by the Norwegian oceanographer [[Fridtjof Nansen]], in which a boat may experience strong resistance to forward motion in apparently calm conditions. This occurs when the ship is sailing on a layer of relatively fresh water whose depth is comparable to the ship's draft. This causes a wake of internal waves that dissipates a huge amount of energy.&lt;ref name=Cushman-Roisin&gt;{{harv|Cushman-Roisin and Beckers|2011|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties of internal waves==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2010}}
Internal waves typically have much lower frequencies and higher amplitudes than [[ocean surface wave|surface gravity waves]] because the density differences (and therefore the restoring forces) within a fluid are usually much smaller. Wavelengths vary from centimetres to kilometres with periods of seconds to hours respectively.

The atmosphere and ocean are continuously stratified: [[potential density]] generally increases steadily downward. Internal waves in a continuously stratified medium may propagate vertically as well as horizontally. The [[dispersion relation]] for such waves is curious: For a freely-propagating internal wave [[wave packet|packet]], the direction of propagation of energy ([[group velocity]]) is perpendicular to the direction of propagation of wave crests and troughs ([[phase velocity]]). An internal wave may also become confined to a finite region of [[altitude]] or depth, as a result of varying stratification or [[wind]]. Here, the wave is said to be ''ducted'' or ''trapped'', and a vertically [[standing wave]] may form, where the vertical component of [[group velocity]] approaches zero. A ducted internal wave ''mode'' may [[Wave propagation|propagate]] horizontally, with parallel [[group velocity|group]] and [[phase velocity]] [[Vector (geometry)|vectors]], analogous to [[wave propagation|propagation]] within a [[waveguide]].

At large scales, internal waves are influenced both by the rotation of the Earth as well as by the stratification of the medium. The frequencies of these geophysical wave motions vary from a lower limit of the [[Coriolis frequency]] ([[inertial waves|inertial motions]]) up to the [[Brunt–Väisälä frequency|Brunt–Väisälä]] frequency, or buoyancy frequency (buoyancy oscillations). Above the [[Brunt–Väisälä frequency]], there may be [[Evanescent wave|evanescent]] internal wave motions, for example those resulting from partial [[reflection (physics)|reflection]]. Internal waves at tidal frequencies are produced by [[tide|tidal flow]] over topography/bathymetry, and are known as [[internal tides]]. Similarly, [[atmospheric tides]] arise from, for example, non-uniform solar heating associated with [[diurnal motion]].

==Onshore transport of planktonic larvae==
Cross-shelf transport, the exchange of water between coastal and offshore environments, is of particular interest for its role in delivering [[meroplankton]]ic [[larva]]e to often disparate adult populations from shared offshore larval pools.&lt;ref&gt;Botsford LW, Moloney CL, Hastings A, Largier JL, Powell TM, Higgins K, Quinn JF (1994) The influence of spatially and temporally varying oceanographic conditions on meroplanktonic metapopulations. Deep-Sea Research Part II 41:107–145&lt;/ref&gt; Several mechanisms have been proposed for the cross-shelf of planktonic larvae by internal waves. The prevalence of each type of event depends on a variety of factors including bottom topography, stratification of the water body, and tidal influences.

===Internal tidal bores===
Similarly to surface waves, internal waves change as they approach the shore. As the ratio of wave amplitude to water depth becomes such that the wave “feels the bottom,” water at the base of the wave slows down due to friction with the sea floor. This causes the wave to become asymmetrical and the face of the wave to steepen, and finally the wave will break, propagating forward as an internal bore.&lt;ref&gt;Defant A (1961) Physical Oceanography, 2nd edn. Pergamon Press, New York&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cairns JL (1967) Asymmetry of internal tidal waves in shallow coastal waters. Journal of Geophysical Research 72:3563–3565&lt;/ref&gt; Internal waves are often formed as tides pass over a shelf break.&lt;ref&gt;Rattray MJ (1960) On coastal generation of internal tides. Tellus 12:54–62&lt;/ref&gt; The largest of these waves are generated during [[spring tide|springtides]] and those of sufficient magnitude break and progress across the shelf as bores.&lt;ref&gt;Winant CD, Olson JR (1976) The vertical structure of coastal currents. Deep-Sea Research 23:925–936&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Winant CD 1980"&gt;Winant CD (1980) Downwelling over the Southern California shelf. Journal of Physical Oceanography 10:791–799&lt;/ref&gt; These bores are evidenced by rapid, step-like changes in temperature and salinity with depth, the abrupt onset of upslope flows near the bottom and packets of high frequency internal waves following the fronts of the bores.&lt;ref&gt;Shanks AL (1995) Mechanisms of cross-shelf dispersal of larval invertebrates and fish. In: McEdward L (ed) Ecology of marine invertebrate larvae. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL, p 323–336&lt;/ref&gt;

The arrival of cool, formerly deep water associated with internal bores into warm, shallower waters corresponds with drastic increases in [[phytoplankton]] and [[zooplankton]] concentrations and changes in plankter species abundances.&lt;ref name="Leichter JJ 1998"&gt;Leichter JJ, Shellenbarger G, Genovese SJ, Wing SR (1998) Breaking internal waves on a Florida (USA) coral reef: a plankton pump at work? Marine Ecology Progress Series 166:83–97&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, while both surface waters and those at depth tend to have relatively low primary productivity, [[thermocline]]s are often associated with a [[chlorophyll]] maximum layer. These layers in turn attract large aggregations of mobile zooplankton&lt;ref name="Mann KH 1991"&gt;Mann KH, Lazier JRN (1991) Dynamics of marine ecosystems. Blackwell, Boston&lt;/ref&gt; that internal bores subsequently push inshore. Many taxa can be almost absent in warm surface waters, yet plentiful in these internal bores.&lt;ref name="Leichter JJ 1998"/&gt;

===Surface slicks===
While internal waves of higher magnitudes will often break after crossing over the shelf break, smaller trains will proceed across the shelf unbroken.&lt;ref name="Winant CD 1980"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cairns JL (1968) Thermocline strength fluctuations in coastal waters. Journal of Geophysical Research 73:2591–2595&lt;/ref&gt; At low wind speeds these internal waves are evidenced by the formation of wide surface slicks, oriented parallel to the bottom topography, which progress shoreward with the internal waves.&lt;ref name="Ewing G 1950"&gt;Ewing G (1950) Slicks, surface films and internal waves. [[Journal of Marine Research]] 9:161–187&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;LaFond EC (1959) Sea surface features and internal waves in the sea. Indian Journal of Meteorology and Geophysics 10:415–419&lt;/ref&gt; Waters above an internal wave converge and sink in its trough and upwell and diverge over its crest.&lt;ref name="Ewing G 1950"/&gt; The convergence zones associated with internal wave troughs often accumulate oils and [[flotsam]] that occasionally progress shoreward with the slicks.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur RS (1954) Oscillations in sea temperature at Scripps and Oceanside piers. Deep-Sea Research 2:129–143&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shanks AL 1983"&gt;Shanks AL (1983) Surface slicks associated with tidally forces internal waves may transport pelagic larvae of benthic invertebrates and fishes shoreward. Marine Ecology Progress Series 13:311–315&lt;/ref&gt; These rafts of flotsam can also harbor high concentrations of larvae of [[invertebrates]] and fish an order of magnitude higher than the surrounding waters.&lt;ref name="Shanks AL 1983"/&gt;

===Predictable downwellings===
Thermoclines are often associated with chlorophyll maximum layers.&lt;ref name="Mann KH 1991"/&gt; Internal waves represent oscillations of these thermoclines and therefore have the potential to transfer these phytoplankton rich waters downward, coupling [[benthic]] and [[pelagic]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;Haury LR, Brisco MG, Orr MH (1979) Tidally generated internal wave packets in Massachusetts Bay. Nature 278:312–317&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haury LR, Wiebe PH, Orr MH, Brisco MG (1983) Tidally generated high-frequency internal wave-packets and their effects on plankton in Massachusetts Bay. [[Journal of Marine Research]] 41:65–112&lt;/ref&gt; Areas affected by these events show higher growth rates of suspension feeding [[ascidiacea|ascidians]] and [[bryozoa]]ns, likely due to the periodic influx of high phytoplankton concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;Witman JD, Leichter JJ, Genovese SJ, Brooks DA (1993) Pulsed Phytoplankton Supply to the Rocky Subtidal Zone: Influence of Internal Waves. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 90:1686–1690&lt;/ref&gt; Periodic depression of the thermocline and associated downwelling may also play an important role in the vertical transport of planktonic larvae.

===Trapped cores===
Large steep internal waves containing trapped, reverse-oscillating cores can also transport parcels of water shoreward.&lt;ref name="Scotti A 2004"&gt;Scotti A, Pineda J (2004) Observation of very large and steep internal waves of elevation near the Massachusetts coast. Geophysical Research Letters 31:1–5&lt;/ref&gt; These non-linear waves with trapped cores had previously been observed in the laboratory&lt;ref&gt;Manasseh R, Chin CY, Fernando HJ (1998) The transition from density-driven to wave-dominated isolated flows. Journal of Fluid Mechanics 361:253–274&lt;/ref&gt; and predicted theoretically.&lt;ref&gt;Derzho OG, Grimshaw R (1997) Solitary waves with a vortex core in a shallow layer of stratified fluid. Physics of Fluids 9:3378–3385&lt;/ref&gt; These waves propagate in environments characterized by high [[shear (fluid)|shear]] and [[turbulence]] and likely derive their energy from waves of depression interacting with a shoaling bottom further upstream.&lt;ref name="Scotti A 2004"/&gt; The conditions favorable to the generation of these waves are also likely to suspend sediment along the bottom as well as plankton and nutrients found along the benthos in deeper water.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18808">This is a '''list of Superfund sites in Kansas''' designated under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) environmental law.  The CERCLA federal law of 1980 authorized the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to create a list of [[Pollution|polluted]] locations requiring a long-term response to clean up hazardous material contaminations.&lt;ref&gt;P.L. 96-510, {{USC|42|9601|9675}}), December 11, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;   These locations are known as [[Superfund]] sites, and are placed on the [[National Priorities List]] (NPL).  

The NPL guides the EPA in "determining which sites warrant further investigation" for [[environmental remediation]].&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;  As of March 26, 2010, there were 11 Superfund sites on the National Priorities List in [[Kansas]].&lt;ref name="NPL"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/npl/ |title=National Priorities List |publisher=United States Enivironmental Protection Agency |accessdate=April 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One more site has been proposed for entry on the list.&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;  Five sites have been cleaned up and removed from the list.&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10262">'''[[Southeast Alaska]]''' has an unusual climate that allows a large number of '''edible plant''' and '''edible mushroom''' species to grow. The area consists primarily of the [[Tongass National Forest]], which is a [[Temperate rainforest]]. This rainforest has plenty of precipitation and the temperature remains relatively constant, therefore many plant and fungi species flourish there. On a geological time scale, fairly recently during the [[Little Ice Age]],  [[glacier]]s were abundant in Southeast Alaska. The ice age's last maximum ended about 10,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Bally, A. W., and Allison R. Palmer. The Geology of North America: An Overview. Boulder, CO: Geological Society of America, 1989. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=January 2015}} Once the glaciers retreated, they left behind nutrient-rich sediments. These nutrients in the soil enriched the ecosystem of the area.

==Tlingit Use==
Historically the [[Tlingit]] people of the Pacific Northwest foraged off of the land. The [[Tlingit cuisine]] included everything from [[whale]]s to [[deer]], and from [[clam]]s to [[plant]]s. Often the Tlingit people included in their diet  many edible items from the surrounding native vegetation along with what ever seafood and wild game they were able to find. Hunting and fishing expeditions were not always successful, in which case, meals were made using the local [[berries]], [[fungus]], and [[seaweed]]. Because winters were long and cold in the Pacific Northwest, the Tlingit people used preserving methods in order to be able to use the gathered vegetation all winter long.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, Wallace M. The Tlingit: An Introduction to Their Culture and History. Auke Bay, AK: Heritage Research, 1997. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=January 2015}} Many of the edible plants that are consumed today in Southeast Alaska are eaten because of the knowledge passed down from many generations of Tlingit.

==Fungi==
The temperate rainforest of the Tongass National Forest often produces a great amount of [[mushroom]]s in the summer and fall months. Fungi can be used for dyeing natural fibers and  as a food source.  In the ecosystem, Fungi cycle nutrients, aggregate soil, retain water, and are a source of food for many animals. There are many kinds of fungi, including [[Chanterelle]]s, [[Bolete]]s, [[Morel]]s, and [[Puffball]]s.

===Limits on harvesting===
Generally speaking individuals are permitted to harvest mushrooms in the Tongass National Forest without a special license. However, it is expected that harvesters help protect the natural resources from damage. For commercial harvest, a permit is required. Harvesters must check with a local forest ranger to make sure all harvesting is legal.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Orson K., and Hope Miller. North American Mushrooms: A Field Guide to Edible and Inedible Fungi. Guilford, CT: Falcon Guide, 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=January 2015}}

Many species of mushrooms and berries can be poisonous, but look similar to the edible species. Harvesting the entire mushroom allows for easier identification as does taking note of the surroundings where the fungus was found. All harvested mushrooms need to be cooked, not eaten raw.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Orson K., and Hope Miller. North American Mushrooms: A Field Guide to Edible and Inedible Fungi. Guilford, CT: Falcon Guide, 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=January 2015}}

[[File:Espejo (3207185886).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Ripple in water is a surface wave.]]

A '''mechanical wave''' is a [[wave]] that is an oscillation of [[matter]], and therefore transfers energy through a [[Transmission medium|medium]].&lt;ref&gt;Giancoli, D. C. (2009) Physics for scientists &amp; engineers with modern physics (4th ed.). Upper Saddle River, N.J.: Pearson Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; While waves can move over long distances, the movement of the [[Transmission medium|medium of transmission]]—the material—is limited. Therefore, the oscillating material does not move far from its initial equilibrium position. Mechanical waves transport energy. This energy propagates in the same direction as the wave. Any kind of wave (mechanical or electromagnetic) has a certain energy. Mechanical waves can be produced only in media which possess elasticity and inertia.

A mechanical wave requires an initial energy input. Once this initial energy is added, the wave travels through the medium until all its energy is transferred. In contrast, [[electromagnetic wave]]s require no medium, but can still travel through one.

One important property of mechanical waves is that their amplitudes are measured in an unusual way, displacement divided by [[wavelength#Angular wavelength|(reduced) wavelength]]. When this gets comparable to unity, significant [[nonlinear]] effects such as harmonic generation may occur, and, if large enough, may result in chaotic effects. For example, waves on the surface of a body of water break when this dimensionless amplitude exceeds 1, resulting in a foam on the surface and turbulent mixing. Some of the most common examples of mechanical waves are water waves, sound waves, and [[seismic waves]].

There are three types of mechanical waves: [[transverse wave]]s, [[longitudinal wave]]s, and [[surface wave]]s.

==Transverse wave==

To see an example, move an end of a [[Slinky]] (whose other end is fixed) to the left-and-right of the Slinky, as opposed to to-and-fro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=College Physics: Reasoning and Relationships |edition=illustrated |first1=Nicholas |last1=Giordano |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2009 |isbn=    978-0-534-42471-8 |page=387 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BwistUlpZ7cC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=BwistUlpZ7cC&amp;pg=PA387 Extract of page 387]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Light]] also has properties of a transverse wave, although it is an electromagnetic wave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Wave Phenomena |edition=illustrated |first1=Dudley H. |last1=Towne |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |year=2014 |isbn=978-0-486-14515-0 |page=139 |url=https://books.google.be/books?id=uZgJCAAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=uZgJCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA139 Extract of page 139]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Longitudinal wave==

{{Main|Longitudinal wave}}
Longitudinal waves cause the medium to vibrate parallel to the direction of the wave. It consists of multiple compressions and rarefactions. The rarefaction is the farthest distance apart in the longitudinal wave and the compression is the closest distance together. The speed of the longitudinal wave is increased in higher index of refraction, due to the closer proximity of the atoms in the medium that is being compressed. [[Sound]] is considered a longitudinal wave.

==Surface waves==

{{Main|Surface wave}}
This type of wave travels along a surface that is between two media. An example of a surface wave would be waves in a pool, or in an ocean, lake, or any other type of water body. There are two types of surface waves, namely [[Rayleigh wave]]s and [[Love wave]]s.

Rayleigh waves, also known as ''ground roll'', are waves that travel as ripples with motion similar to those of waves on the surface of water. Rayleigh waves are much slower than [[body wave (seismology)|body wave]]s, at roughly 90% of the velocity of {{clarify span|text=bulk waves|explain=What are "bulk waves"?|date=October 2018}} for a typical homogeneous elastic medium. Rayleigh waves have energy losses only in two dimensions and are hence more destructive in [[earthquake]]s than conventional bulk waves, such as [[P-wave]]s and [[S-wave]]s, which lose energy in all three directions.

A Love wave is a surface wave having horizontal waves that are shear or transverse to the direction of propagation. They usually travel slightly faster than Rayleigh waves, at about 90% of the body wave velocity, and have the largest amplitude.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18997">{{short description|A period of either rapid or just accelerated post-glacial sea level rise}}
'''Meltwater pulse 1B''' ('''MWP1b''') is the name used by [[Quaternary]] [[geologist]]s, [[paleoclimatologist]]s, and [[oceanographer]]s for a period of either rapid or just accelerated [[post-glacial]] [[sea level rise]] that occurred between 11,500 and 11,200 years ago at the beginning of the [[Holocene]] and after the end of the [[Younger Dryas]].&lt;ref name="Cronin2012"/&gt; Meltwater pulse 1B is also known as '''catastrophic rise event 2''' ('''CRE2''') in the Caribbean Sea.&lt;ref name="BlanchonOthers1995"/&gt; 

Other named, postglacial meltwater pulses are known most commonly as meltwater pulse 1A0 (meltwaterpulse19ka), [[meltwater pulse 1A]], [[meltwater pulse 1C]], meltwater pulse 1D, and meltwater pulse 2. 
It and these other periods of proposed rapid sea level rise are known as ''meltwater pulses'' because the inferred cause of them was the rapid release of [[meltwater]] into the oceans from the collapse of continental ice sheets.&lt;ref name="Cronin2012"&gt;Cronin, T.M. (2012) ''Rapid sea-level rise.'' Quaternary Science Reviews. 56:11-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sea level ==
There is considerable unresolved disagreement over the significance, timing, magnitude, and even existence of meltwater pulse 1B. It was first recognized by Fairbanks in his [[coral reef]] studies in [[Barbados]]. From the analysis of data from cores of coral reefs surrounding Barbados, he concluded that during meltwater pulse 1B, sea level rose {{convert|28|m|ft|sp=us}} in about 500 years about 11,300 calendar years ago.&lt;ref name="Fairbanks2012"&gt;Fairbanks, R.G . (1989) "A 17 000 year glacio-eustatic sea level record: influence of glacial melting rates on the Younger Dryas event and deep-ocean circulation". ''Nature''. 342:637–642.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 1996 and 2010, Bard and others published detailed analysis of data from cores from coral reefs surrounding [[Tahiti]]. They concluded that meltwater pulse 1B was, at best, just an acceleration of sea level rise at about 11,300 calendar years ago and it was, at worst, not statistically different from a constant rate sea level rise between 11,500 and 10,200 calendar years ago. They argued that meltwater pulse 1B was certainly not an abrupt jump in sea level, which they would consider to be a ''meltwater pulse''. They argue that the {{convert|28|m|ft|sp=us}} rise in sea level estimated by Fairbanks from cores is an artifact created by differential tectonic uplift between different sides of a tectonic structure lying between the two Barbados cores used to identify meltwater pulse 1B and calculate its magnitude.&lt;ref name="BardOthers1996"&gt;Bard, E., B. Hamelin, M. Arnold, L. Montaggioni, G. Cabioch, and others (1996) ''Deglacial sea-level record from Tahiti corals and the timing of global meltwater discharge.'' Nature. 382: 241-244.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BardOthers2010"&gt;Bard, E., B. Hamelin, and D. Delanghe-Sabatier (2010) ''Deglacial Meltwater Pulse 1B and Younger Dryas Sea Levels Revisited with Boreholes at Tahiti.'' Science. 327:1235-1237.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other differing estimates about the magnitude of meltwater pulse 1B have been published. In 2010, Standford and others found it to be "robustly expressed" as a multi-millennial interval of enhanced rates of sea-level rise between 11,500 and 8,800 calendar years ago with peak rates of rise of up to 25&amp;nbsp;mm/yr.&lt;ref name="StanfordOthers2010"&gt;Stanford, J.D., R. Hemingway, E.J. Rohling, P.G. Challenor, M. Medina-Elizalde, and A.J. Lester (2011) ''Sea-level probability for the last deglaciation: a statistical analysis of far-field records.'' Global and  Planetary Change. 79:193–203.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Liu and Milliman reexamined the original data from Barbados and Tahiti and reconsidered the mechanics and sedimentology  of reef drowning by sea level rise. They concluded that meltwater pulse 1B occurred between 11,500 and 11,200 calendar years ago, a 300-calendar year interval, during which sea level rose {{convert|13|m|ft|sp=us}} from {{convert|-58|m|ft|sp=us}} to {{convert|-45|m|ft|sp=us}}, giving a mean annual rate of around 40mm/yr&lt;ref name="LiuOthers2004"&gt;Liu, J.P., and J.D. Milliman (2004) ''Reconsidering Melt-water Pulses lA and lB: Global Impacts of Rapid Sea- level Rise.'' Journal of Ocean University of China. 3(2):183–190.&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have revised the estimated magnitude of meltwater pulse 1B downward to between {{convert|7.5|m|ft|sp=us}} and less than {{convert|6|m|ft|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name="BlanchonOthers1995"&gt;Blanchon, P., and J. Shaw (1995) ''Reef drowning during the last deglaciation: Evidence for catastrophic sea-level rise and ice-sheet collapse.'' Geology. 23(1):4-8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WhitehouseOthers2013"&gt;Whitehouse, P.L., and S.L. Bradley (2013) ''Eustatic sea-level changes since the Last Glacial Maximum.'' In: Elias, S.A., ed., pp. 439–451. ''Encyclopedia of Quaternary Sciences'', 2nd Edition. Elsevier (Amsterdam).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Source(s) of meltwater pulse 1B ==
Given the disagreement over its timing, magnitude, and even existence, it has been very difficult to constrain the source of meltwater pulse 1B. In his modeling of global [[glacial isostatic adjustment]], Peltier assumed that the  predominant source for MWP-1B was the [[Antarctic Ice Sheet]]. However, no justification for this assumption is provided in his papers.&lt;ref name="Peltier1994a"&gt;Peltier, W.R. (1994), ''Ice age paleotopography.''

Annual Review Earth and Planetary Science. 32:111–149.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Leventer and others argue that the timing of [[deglaciation]] in eastern [[Antarctica]] roughly coincides with the onset of meltwater pulse 1B and the Antarctic Ice Sheet is a likely source.&lt;ref name="LeventerOthers2006a"&gt;Leventer, A., [[Eugene Domack|E.

McClennen (2006) ''Marine sediment record from the East Antarctic margin reveals dynamics of ice sheet recession.''

However, later studies involving the surface exposure dating of [[glacial erratic]]s, [[nunatak]],s and other formerly glaciated exposures using cosmogenic dating contradicted the above arguments and assumptions.&lt;ref name="CarlsonOthers2012a"&gt;Carlson, A.E., and P.U.

They also concluded that the ice sheet retreat and thinning accelerated for the West Antarctic Ice Sheet only after 7,000 calendar years ago.&lt;ref name="CarlsonOthers2012a"/&gt; Although other researchers have concluded that the abrupt decay of the [[Laurentide Ice Sheet]] might have been sufficient to have been responsible for meltwater pulse 1B, its sources remain an unresolved mystery.&lt;ref name="CarlsonOthers2012a"/&gt; For example, recent research in West Antarctica found that sufficient deglaciation contemporaneous with meltwater pulse 1B occurred to readily explain this rapid period of global sea level rise.&lt;ref name="FogwillOthers2015a"&gt;Fogwill, C., C.

Fortunately, a variety of [[Proxy (climate)|paleoclimate and paleohydrologic proxies]],which can be used to reconstruct the prehistoric discharge of the [[Mississippi River]], can be found in the [[sediment]]s of the Louisiana continental shelf and slope, including the [[Orca Basin|Orca]] and Pygmy basins, within the [[Gulf of Mexico]].&lt;ref name="Biller2012a"&gt;Biller, N.B.

For example, meltwater pulse 1A in the Barbados coral record matches quite well with a group of two separate Mississippi River meltwater flood events, MWF-3 (12,600 radiocarbon years ago) and MWF-4 (11,900 radiocarbon years ago). In addition, meltwater pulse 1B in the Barbados coral record matches a cluster of four Mississippi River superflood events, MWF-5, that occurred between 9,900 and 9,100 radiocarbon years ago. In 2003, Aharon reported that flood event MWF-5 consists of four separate and distinct superfloods at 9,970-9,870; 9,740-9,660; 9,450-9,290; and 9,160-8,900 radiocarbon years ago.&lt;ref name="Aharon2003a"/&gt; The discharge at the mouth of the Mississippi River during three of the four superfloods of MWF-5 is estimated to have varied between 0.07 and 0.08 sverdrups (million cubic meters per second). The superflood at 9450-9290 radiocarbon years ago is estimated to have had a discharge of 0.10 sverdrups (million cubic meters per second).&lt;ref name="Aharon2003a"/&gt; This research also shows that the Mississippi superfloods of MWF-5 occurred during the [[Preboreal]]. The same research found an absence of either meltwater floods or superfloods discharging into the Gulf of Mexico from the Mississippi River during the preceding thousand years, which is known as the ''cessation event'', that corresponds with the Younger Dryas stadial.&lt;ref name="Biller2012a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MecklerOthers2008a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aharon2003a"/&gt;

The Pleistocene deposits blanketing the Louisiana Continental shelf and slope between the mouth of the Mississippi River and Orca and Pygmy basins largely consist of sediments transported down the Mississippi River mixed with variable additions of local biologically generated carbonate. Because of this, the provenance of the meltwater and superfloods can be readily inferred from the sediment's composition. The composition of the sediments brought into the Gulf of Mexico and deposited on the Louisiana continental shelf and slope during the superfloods of MWF-5 reflect an abrupt change in mineralogy, fossil content, organic matter, and amount after 12,900 calendar years ago at the start of the Younger Dryas interval. First, after 12,900 calendar years ago, smectite-rich sediments from the Missouri River drainage are progressively and quickly replaced by sediments, which are associated with the Great Lakes region and  further south along the Mississippi River, as indicated by their clay mineralogy. Second, after 12,900 calendar years ago, the overall quantity of sediment being transported down the Mississippi River abruptly decreases with a corresponding and significantly increased proportion of locally produced biologically generated carbonate and organic matter. Third, after 12,900 calendar years ago, various analyses, e.g. C/N ratio and Rock–Eval Pyrolysis, indicate that the type of organic matter present changes from organic matter that was reworked from old formations by glacials to well-preserved Holocene organic matter that is mainly of marine origin. Finally, after 12,900 calendar years ago, the presence of reworked nanofossils disappear from sediments accumulating on the Louisiana continental shelf and slope.&lt;ref name="Montero-SerranoOthers2009"&gt;Montero-Serrano, J.C., V. Bout-Roumazeilles, N. Tribovillard, T. Sionneau, A.Riboulleau, A. Bory, and B. Flower (2009) ''Sedimentary evidence of deglacial megafloods in the northern Gulf of Mexico (Pigmy Basin).'' Quaternary Science Reviews. 28:3333–3347.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SionneauOthers2010"&gt;Sionneau, T.V., B.P. Bout-Roumazeilles, A. Flower, N. Bory, C. Tribovillard, B. Kissel, B. Van Vliet-Lanoë, and J.C. Montero Serrano (2010) ''Provenance of freshwater pulses in the Gulf of Mexico during the last deglaciation.'' Quaternary Research. 74:235–245.&lt;/ref&gt;

The above changes in the nature of accumulating sediments indicate that after the start of the Younger Dryas, the southern route for Laurentide Ice Sheet meltwater was largely blocked.  On the rare occasions it could flow southward, glacial meltwater flowed through Lake Agassiz and sometimes the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River. As the water moved through either Lake Agassiz or other proglacial lakes, they completely trapped and removed any glacial outwash and the older, reworked organic material and reworked nanofossils that the outwash contained. As a result, the sediment carried by the Mississippi River after the start of the Younger Dryas consisted of illite and chorite enriched sediments from the Great Lakes region that lacked any reworked nanofossils. These changes argue that the superfloods of MWF-5 which fed Meltwater Pulse B are related to either rare periods of southerly discharge of meltwater through Lake Agassiz, nonglacial periods of climate-enhanced discharge within the Mississippi River Basin, or a combination of both.&lt;ref name="Montero-SerranoOthers2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SionneauOthers2010"/&gt;

== Antarctic iceberg discharge events ==
In case of the Antarctica Ice Sheet, an equivalent well-dated, high-resolution record of the discharge of icebergs from various parts of the Antarctic Ice Sheet for the past 20,000 calendar years is also available. Research by Weber and others constructed a record from variations in the amount of iceberg-rafted debris versus time and other environmental proxies in two cores taken from the ocean bottom within Iceberg Alley of the Weddell Sea. The cores of ocean bottom sediments within Iceberg Alley provide a spatially integrated signal of the variability of the discharge of icebergs into the marine waters by the Antarctic Ice Sheet because it is a confluence zone in which icebergs calved from the entire Antarctic Ice Sheet drift along currents, converge, and exit the Weddell Sea to the north into the Scotia Sea.&lt;ref name="WeberOthers2014a"&gt;Weber, M.E., P.U. Clark, G. Kuhn, A. Timmermann, D. Sprenk, R. Gladstone, X. Zhang, G. Lohmann, L. Menviel, M.O. Chikamoto, T. Friedrich, and C. Ohlwein (2014) ''Millennial-scale variability in Antarctic ice-sheet discharge during the last deglaciation.'' Nature. 510(7503):134–138.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 20,000 and 9,000 calendar years ago, Weber and others documented eight well-defined periods of increased [[iceberg]] [[Ice calving|calving]] and discharge from various parts of the Antarctic Ice Sheet. Five of these periods, AID5 through AID2 (Antarctic Iceberg Discharge events), are comparable in duration and have a repeat time of about 800–900 calendar years. The largest of the Antarctic Iceberg Discharge events is AID2. Its peak intensity at about 11,300 calendar years ago, which is synchronous with meltwater pulse 1B in the Barbados sea-level record, is consistent with a significant Antarctic contribution to meltwater pulse 1B. The lack of a sea level response in the Tahiti coral record might indicate a regionally specific sea-level response to a [[deglaciation]] event only from the Pacific sector of the Antarctica Ice Sheet.&lt;ref name="WeberOthers2014a"/&gt;

This maximum period is a natural example of [[solar variation]], and one of many that are known from proxy records of past solar variability. The Modern Maximum reached a double peak once in the 1950s and again during the 1990s.

Many species of [[Staphylinidae]] (commonly known as “rove beetles”) have developed complex interspecies relationships with ants, known as [[myrmecophily]]. Rove Beetles are among the most rich and diverse families of myrmecophilous beetles, with a wide variety of relationships with ants. Ant associations range from near free-living species which prey only on ants, to obligate [[inquilines]] of ants, which exhibit extreme morphological and chemical adaptations to the harsh environments of ant nests. Some species are fully integrated into the host colony, and are cleaned and fed by ants. Many of these, including species in tribe Clavigerini, are [[Myrmecophagy|myrmecophagous]], placating their hosts with glandular secretions while eating the brood&lt;ref&gt;Lapeva-Gjonova, Albena (April 2013). “Ant-Associated Beetle Fauna in Bulgaria: A Review and New Data”. ''Psyche'' (Cairo: Hindawi Pub. Co.) 2013: 1-14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy==
Staphylinidae is currently considered to be the largest family of beetles, with over 58,000 species described. As such, many myrmecophilous species are unknown. The majority of studied myrmecophilous Rove Beetles belong to the subfamily [[Aleocharinae]], including the commonly studied genera ''[[Pella (genus)|Pella]]'', ''[[Dinarda]]'', ''[[Tetradonia]]'', ''[[Ecitomorpha]]'', ''[[Ecitophya]]'', ''[[Atemeles]]'', and ''[[Limechusa]]'', and to the subfamily [[Pselaphinae]], which includes ''[[Claviger]]'' and ''[[Adranes]]''. There are also representatives of [[Scydmaenidae]], which includes 117 myrmecophilous species in 20 genera&lt;ref&gt;O'Keefe, Sean (2000). "Ant-Like Stone Beetles, Ants, and Their Associations (Coleoptera: Scydmaenidae; Hymenoptera: Formicidae; Isoptera)". ‘’J. N. Y. Entomol. Soc.’’ (NYC: N. Y. Entomol. Soc.) 108 (3/4): 273–303.&lt;/ref&gt; The Aleocharinae possess defensive glands on their abdomens, which are used in myrmecophilous species to prevent attacks by their host ant and in more extreme cases to integrate completely into the colony. Many Pselephinae species have [[trichomes]], tufts of hairs which hold placating pheromones. Pselephines have evolved trichomes independently at least four times, most notably in all members of Clavigerini, but also in ''Attapsenius'' and ''Songius'' genera.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Joe; Eldredge, Taro (10 Dec 2012), "The Bizarre, Beetle-Biased World of Social Insect Exploitation", ‘’Scientific American’’&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology and Behavior==
Due to their large number and diversity, myrmecophilous Rove Beetles occupy an array of behaviors. Myrmecophilous interactions can be generalized into categories, in three of which Staphylinids can be found. The synecthrans, or “persecuted guests,” the synoeketes, or “tolerated guests,” and the symphiles, or “true guests.”&lt;ref&gt;Mynhardt, Glené (2013). "Declassifying Myrmecophily in the Coleoptera to Promote the Study of Ant-Beetle Symbioses". ‘’Psyche’’ (Cairo: Hindawi pub co) 2013: 1–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Synecthrans===

Synecthran Staphylinids live on the periphery of the host colony and are not accepted into the colony. The majority are in the subfamily Aleocharinae, having defensive glands on their terminal abdominal segments. Species in this group, such as those in the genus ''Pella'', commonly lay their eggs in the refuse heaps of their host ant, where the larvae feed on the discarded carcasses of ants. If detected by the host ant, the larvae enters a typical defense position, facing the ant with its abdomen tip raised. Usually this behavior results in the ant palpating the beetle’s abdomen and stopping the attack.&lt;ref&gt;Holldobler, B.; Moglich, M.; Maschwitz, U. (1981). "Myrmecophilic Relationship Of ''Pella'' (coleoptera: Staphylinidae) To ''Lasius fuliginosus'' (hymenoptera: Formicidae)". ''Psyche''(Cairo: Hindawi Pub Co.) 88: 347–374&lt;/ref&gt; At least two members of ''Pella, P. funestus'' and ''P. humeralis'', produce several of their host ant’s alarm pheromones to avoid aggression.&lt;ref name="skills"&gt;Stoeffler, Michael; S. Maier, Tanja; Till, Tolasch; L. M. Steidle, Johannes (2007). "Foreign-language Skills in Rove-Beetles? Evidence for Chemical Mimicry of Ant Alarm Pheromones in Myrmecophilous ''Pella'' Beetles (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae)". ‘’J Chem Ecol’’ (NYC: Springer Pub) 33: 1382–1392&lt;/ref&gt; Other species, like members of ''Myrmechusa, Aenictonia'', and ''Anommatochara'', prey on raiding columns or on the nests of Driver ants (''[[Dorylus]]'').&lt;ref name="social"&gt;R. Herman, Henry, ed.; H. Kistner, David (1979). ‘’Social Insects’’ 1,3. Waltham: Academic Press Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Myrmechusa'' species attack the ants from the rear before pulling them from the main column. If pursued, they rapidly wave their abdomens through the air, releasing a noticeable scent. Ants encountering this scent seem disoriented and take almost 20 minutes to recover.&lt;ref&gt;.

Staphylinidae)". “Ann. Entomol. Soc. Am” 58 (1): 28–44&lt;/ref&gt;

===Synoeketes===
[[File:Vatesus with ants.jpg|thumbnail|Loricate ''Vatesus'' Sp. with host ants]]
Synoeketetic Staphylinids live in close contact with their host ants but are not integrated into the colony. These species may be further categorized as neutral, mimetic, loricate, and symphiloid synoeketes. Neutral synoeketes ignore and are ignored by their host, but feed on refuse. There are few Staphylinid neutral synoeketes, but some are found in the genus ''Athetini'', which live in the debris and fungal chambers of leaf cutter ants (''[[Atta (genus)|Atta]]'').&lt;ref name="social" /&gt; Mimetic synoeketes are myrmecoid, resembling their host ant morphologically. Many mimetic species are guests of Driver ants, which are blind. Driver ants however have strong senses of touch, suggesting mimics fool their hosts tactilely. It is also possible that mimicry may reduce predation from more visual animals, such as birds. Loricate, or “tear-drop shaped”, synoeketes are “defensive forms”. They typically exhibit long tapering bodies with broad thoraxes and smooth bodies, which prevent aggressing ants from gripping them. Symphiloids strongly resemble “true guests,” but are not fully integrated into the colony. They are often mimics, and in some species have developed trichomes.&lt;ref&gt;M. Wheeler, William (1960). ‘’Ants: Their Structure, Development, and Behavior.’’ 9. NYC: Columbia Univ Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Syneoketes generally live on or inside of ant nests, where they feed on refuse and may steal food from their hosts. There is some overlap between synoeketes and other categories, especially in loricate species and synecthrans, and symphiloids and symphiles, where the behavior of “true guests” may be difficult to determine.

===Symphiles===
[[File:Myrmecoid staphylinidae.jpg|thumbnail|Myrmecoids ''Labidopullus ashei, Beyeria vespa, Pseudomimeciton'' sp., and ''Ecitophya bicolor'']]
Symphilic Staphylinids have been fully integrated into the host ant’s society. Symphilic species have undergone complex morphological adaptations, many becoming myrmecoid. Most have developed trichomes, which secrete appeasement pheromones. The most extreme adaptations, found in members of tribe Clavigerini, include the reduction of mouthparts for [[trophallaxis]] and the fusing of many body and antennal segments. While most symphiles use antennal contact to stimulate food giving from their host, at least one member of Clavigerini, ''Claviger testaceus'', secretes a chemical to induce regurgitation from its host ant ''[[Lasius flavus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cammaerts, R. (1992). "Stimuli inducing the regurgitation of the workers of ''Lasius flavus'' (Formicidae) upon the myrmecophilous beetle ''Claviger testaceus'' (Pselaphidae)". “Behavioural Processes” (ScienceDirect) 28 (1-2): 81–95&lt;/ref&gt; Symphiles typically take on many roles in the colony, raising young, feeding and grooming adults, and helping transport food and larvae. Many Staphylinids are capable of following ant pheromone trails, although they are not limited to following trails laid by their host ant. This allows symphiles of army ants to migrate with the colony.&lt;ref&gt;W. Rettenmeyer, Carl; D. Akre, Roger (1968). "Trail-Following by Guests of Army Ants (Hymenoptera: 
Formicidae: Ecitonini)". ''J. Kans. Entomol. Soc.'' (Kans. Entomol. Soc.) 41 (2): 165–174&lt;/ref&gt; Most species are [[Kleptoparasitism|kleptoparasites]] being fed by other members of the colony, often through [[trophallaxis]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parker|first=Joseph|date=2016|title=Myrmecophily in beetles (Coleoptera): evolutionary patterns and biological mechanisms.|url=https://authors.library.caltech.edu/84320/1/mn22_65-108_printable.pdf|journal=Myrmecological News|volume=201, 22|pages=65-108|via=https://authors.library.caltech.edu/}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Almost all species have also been observed feeding on the brood. Some of these species die if kept away from the appropriate ant colonies, and others lay their own eggs in ant brood galleries, effectively making them [[Obligate parasite|obligate parasites]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

==Chemical Mimicry==
[[Chemical mimicry]] refers to the production of one species’ chemical signals by another species. Many myrmecophilous Staphylinids have evolved chemical mimicry to deter or placate ants. Synecthrans, as non tolarated guests, primarily produce defensive secretions. ''Pella'' species produce two compounds found in their host ant ''[[Lasius fuliginosus]]'', [[undecane]] and sulcatone, which elicit aggressive and panic reactions respectively. Although it seems counterintuitive to release an aggressive alarm pheromone as a defense, the presence of sulcatone stops the aggression response to undecane. Ants exposed to the defensive secretion act less aggressively and avoid the odor.

For Staphylinids accepted into the host colony chemical mimicry is used more for camouflage. The majority of the chemical signals used are cuticular hydrocarbons, which are produced in the cuticle of the host ant at certain concentrations and are palpated to determine the identity of an ant. Species in close contact with their host ants are able to pick up the host’s hydrocarbons and imitate the ant’s hydrocarbon pattern, thus appearing in scent at least to be the same species as the host ant. As hydrocarbon patterns are specific to an individual colony, the Rove Beetles are generally restricted to one nest. The production of a new hydrocarbon pattern takes time, during which the beetle is vulnerable to detection and attack.&lt;ref name="skills" /&gt; Some species, such as ''[[Zyras comes]]'', produce volatile pheromones as well as cuticular hydrocarbons, which may provide it more protection than contact based pheromones while traveling with its host in foraging trails.&lt;ref&gt;Akino, Toshiharu (2002). "Chemical camouflage by myrmecophilous beetles ''Zyras comes'' (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) and Diaritiger fossulatus (Coleoptera: Pselaphidae) to be integrated into the nest of ''Lasius fuliginosus'' (Hymenoptera: Formicidae)". ''Chemoecology'' (NYC: Springer pub) 12 (2): 83–89&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nanmu''' (Chinese: [[wikt:楠木|楠木]]) is a type of wood that was frequently used for boat building, architectural woodworking and wood art in [[China]]. [[Ming Dynasty]] era writings indicate this wood as superior durable [[softwood]]. A recent excavation of a tomb in Lija village in [[Jing'an County]], [[Jiangxi Province]] found 47 coffins made of nanmu wood that are reported to be about 2500 years old dating back to the Eastern [[Zhou Dynasty]] period and belongs to the [[Dongyi]] State of [[Xu (state)|Xu]].

The trees that produce nanmu wood are evergreens that have a long straight trunk which grow to 35 meters in height and one meter in diameter. More than 30 varieties exist which are found south of the [[Yangtze River]]. There are also nanmu trees on [[Hainan Island]] and in [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yangmu nanmu is found in [[Sichuan]]. Zinan nanmu is found in southeast and south central China. Zinanmu nanmu is found in Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhenjiang. Zhennan nanmu is found in Guizhou and Sichuan. The finest of all the nanmu woods is Hongmao Nanmu (''[[Phoebe (plant)|Phoebe Hungmaoensis]]'') from Hainan Island.

Nanmu wood comes from several species of tree, including:
*''[[Phoebe nanmu]]''
*''[[Nantou litsea]]''
*''[[Konishi nathaphoebe]]''
*''[[Machilus]] nanmu''

Nanmu is a very knotty wood. It does not react to humidity and temperature much in the way of expansion or contraction and makes superior furniture which tends not to get loose or crack because of changes in climate.&lt;ref name="ming-mai"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;br /&gt;

Nanmu was used in architectural woodworking and boat-building due to its resistance to decay. The wood dries with little splitting or warping. After drying the wood is of medium-density and does not change shape. Nanmu can be sanded to a mirror finish.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2883">'''Net Smelter Return (NSR)''' is the net revenue that the owner of a mining property receives from the sale of the mine's metal/non metal products less transportation and [[refining]] costs.  As a [[royalties|royalty]] it refers to the fraction of net smelter return that a mine operator is obligated to pay the owner of the royalty agreement.  The royalty is paid in variable or fixed payments based on sales revenue received by a mining operator in return for mining output.  It is contingent only on the sales price and quantity of product sold.&lt;ref name=royalgold&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalgold.com/new/frames/royalties.htm|title=Royal Gold definitions|accessdate=2011-07-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515053040/http://www.royalgold.com/new/frames/royalties.htm|archivedate=2011-05-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is named so due to the fact most of the time, mining output sold requires further processing by [[smelter]]s; the mining products purchased directly by smelters are sold to them for a discounted (net) price based on how much further processing is needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minval.com/royalty_mineral.html|title=Mineral Production Royalties|accessdate=2011-07-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120906103202/http://www.minval.com/royalty_mineral.html|archivedate=2012-09-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The mining lease specifies the selling price (prices are different in [[spot market|spot]] and [[forward market]]s) and is used to verify the exact amount of product that's produced and sold between royalty payments.

One advantage NSR royalties have over other royalties is that usually, payments are higher in the short term because capital costs and exploration costs cannot be used as deductions (some royalties don't have to be paid until after other costs such as loans/amortization are taken care of).  Also, mine life and royalty expiration dates need to be taken into consideration.  The royalty can be called a Net Value Royalty when deductions are based solely on the contract.&lt;ref name=royalgold/&gt;

Alternatively the '''Gross Smelter Return''' is a percentage of gross revenue paid by mine owner that isn't subject to any deductions.&lt;ref name=royalgold/&gt;

==Examples of transactions involving net smelter return royalties==

*[[Franco-Nevada]]'s 7.29% NSR royalty on [[Newmont Mining]]'s Gold Quarry open pit mine in Nevada, which cost the company US$103.5 million, realized $250 million in royalty payments before being acquired.  The NSM royalty in this case gave Franco Nevada the option of collecting in cash or in-kind (metal product output).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miningweekly.com/article/franconevada-buys-729-nsr-royalty-on-newmont-property-2008-12-23|title=Franco-Nevada buys 7,29% NSR royalty on Newmont property |date=2008-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate''' ({{lang-no|Norges vassdrags- og energidirektorat}} or '''NVE''') is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[government agency]] established in 1921. It is under the [[Norwegian Ministry of Petroleum and Energy|Ministry of Petroleum and Energy]] and regulates the country's [[water resources]] and [[energy supply]]. Its mandate includes [[contingency plan]]ning for [[flood]]s, serving as a centre of expertise for [[hydrology]], [[research and development]], and increasing [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]]. It is a member of the [[Council of European Energy Regulators]].

The directorate is based in [[Oslo]], and has regional offices in [[Hamar]], [[Førde]], [[Tønsberg]], [[Trondheim]] and [[Narvik]]. It also establishes international contacts and undertakes work abroad in [[developing country|developing countries]] for the [[Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation]]. {{As of|2006}}, it has over 400 [[employee]]s. Its website includes statistics on Norwegian energy consumption, production and prices and a [[database]] of Norwegian [[lake]]s and [[water catchment area]]s.

The directorate holds administrative responsibility for the Watercourse Regulation Act (1917), Industrial Concession Act (1917), Energy Act (1990) and Water Resources Act (2000). Within the scope of these acts, the directorate can also issue new regulations.

The '''Odalar Mosque''' ({{lang-tr|Odalar Câmîi}}, meaning "the mosque of the barracks" after the nearby accommodations of the married [[Janissary|Jannisaries]] established in this quarter in the 18th century. Also: ''Kemankeş Mustafa Paşa Câmîi'') was an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[mosque]] in [[Istanbul]].&lt;ref name=mw188&gt;Müller-Wiener (1977), p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; The building was originally a [[Byzantine]]-era [[Eastern Orthodox]] church of unknown dedication.&lt;ref name=mw188/&gt; In 1475, after the [[Fall of Constantinople]] (1453), it became a [[Roman Catholic]] church, dedicated to '''[[Saint Mary]] of [[Constantinople]]''', until finally it was converted into a mosque by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in 1640.&lt;ref name=mw188/&gt; The mosque was destroyed by fire in 1919, and since then has fallen into ruin.&lt;ref name=mw188/&gt; As of 2011, only some walls remain, hidden among modern buildings.

==Location==
The ruins of the building lie in [[Istanbul]], in the district of [[Fatih]], in the neighborhood of Salmatomruk, not far from Edirne Kapı (the ancient [[Walls_of_Constantinople#Gate_of_Charisius|Gate of Charisius]]), more or less halfway between the [[Chora Church]] and the [[Fethiye Mosque]].&lt;ref name=we1&gt;Westphalen (1998), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The few remains lie in a courtyard and can be accessed through modern blocks built on ''Müftu Sokaĝi 20-22''.&lt;ref name=we1/&gt;

==History==
===Byzantine Age===

Between the ninth and the tenth century&lt;ref name=we40&gt;Westphalen (1998) p.40&lt;/ref&gt; a church with an underlying basement and a [[crypt]] was erected on the top of the sixth hill of [[Constantinople]], on a plateau which is limited by the open air [[cistern of Aetius]] (now [[Vefa Stadium|a football field]]) and by the unidentified Byzantine edifice denominated in Ottoman times as ''[[Bogdan Saray|Boĝdan Saray]]''.&lt;ref name=we1/&gt; The dedication of this building is uncertain,&lt;ref name=mw188/&gt; but it was probably part of a complex which also included today's [[Kasım Ağa Mosque]] and the İpek Cistern, and was almost certainly the ''[[katholikon]]'' of a monastery.&lt;ref name=we1/&gt;

The edifice has been identified for a long time as the [[Theotokos]] ''en te Petra'', but without conclusive evidence.&lt;ref name=ey72&gt;Eyice (1955) p.72&lt;/ref&gt;
During the Byzantine period, several monasteries lay in the area; the Monastery of [[Manuel the Armenian|Manuel]], that devoted to St. John in Petra, and the [[nunnery]] dedicated to the ''[[Theotokos]] Kecharitomene'' ("full of grace" or "favoured (by God)").&lt;ref name=we1/&gt; The latter was founded at the beginning of the 12th century by Empress [[Eirene Doukaina]], and is known above all because of its detailed and extant ''[[typikon]]''.&lt;ref name=ja196&gt;Janin (1953), p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; The nearby church of the ''Theotokos tas Kellararias'', used by the nuns of the ''Karithomene'' as a burial place, and that of ''Hagios Nikolaos'', both mentioned in the ''typikon'' of the nunnery, are possible candidates for the identification.&lt;ref name=we2&gt;Westphalen (1998), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the Odalar Mosque could also be identified with a nearby church dedicated to [[Saints Sergius and Bacchus]], which lay ''plesion tes Aetiou kinsternes'' ([[Greek Language|Greek]] "near the cistern of Aetios": not to be confounded with [[Little Hagia Sophia|the homonymous church]] which lies near [[Hagia Sophia]]) because of the discovery in the vicinity of a [[monogram]]med [[Capital (architecture)|capital]] (unfortunately found not ''[[In_situ#Archaeology|in situ]]'').&lt;ref name=ja559&gt;Janin (1953), p. 559.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1150 and 1175  a new church of the [[cross-in-square]] plan was built above the old one (possibly destroyed by fire or menaced by a landslide).&lt;ref name=mw188/&gt;&lt;ref name=we43&gt;Westphalen (1998) p.43&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ottoman Age===
[[File:THEODOSIA 01.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Genoese Fortress of Caffa. From here were deported the Italians which populated the Kefeli Mahalle in Istanbul]]

The documented history of the edifice begins in 1475, shortly after the [[Fall of Constantinople]], when [[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|Sultan]] [[Mehmed II]] conquered the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] colony of [[Caffa]], in [[Crimea]]. About 40,000 [[Romance-speaking Europe|Latin]], [[Greeks|Greek]], [[Armenian People|Armenian]] and [[Jewish]] inhabitants who lived in Caffa ("Caffariotes" or, in [[Turkish Language|Turkish]], ''Kefeli'') were then deported to Istanbul and relocated to this quarter, which was named after them ''Kefe [[Mahalle]]si''.&lt;ref name=mw188/&gt;&lt;ref name =ma308&gt;Mamboury 1953) p. 308&lt;/ref&gt; The Latins, mainly [[Genoa|Genoese]], were authorized to use in their quarter as churches the building and, together with the Armenians, another edifice known later as [[Kefeli Mosque]], which was dedicated to Saint Nicholas.&lt;ref name=mw188/&gt;

The edifice, dedicated then to [[Saint Mary|Saint Mary of Constantinople]] ({{lang-it|Santa Maria di Costantinopoli}}), was officiated by the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], which before the Ottoman conquest had also a monastery in the city on the [[Black Sea]].&lt;ref name=we48&gt;Westphalen (1998), p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Here was brought from Caffa a large [[icon]] of the [[Hodegetria]] type, which now is kept in the Dominican monastery of [[Church of SS Peter and Paul, Istanbul|SS. Peter and Paul]] in [[Galata]].&lt;ref name =ma308/&gt; Due to all that, at the beginning of the sixteenth century the church of Saint Mary had turned into the center of this quarter predominantly inhabited by Italians, but the building fell soon in disrepair.&lt;ref name=we48/&gt; Under Sultan [[Murad IV]] (r. 1623–1640) the decision was taken to exclude from the walled city the Christians who were not Ottoman subjects and to resettle them in [[Galata]] and [[Beyoğlu|Pera]].&lt;ref name=we49&gt;Westphalen (1998), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, and after riots between Christian and Muslims, the church was closed in 1636, and in 1640 it was transformed into a mosque by ''Sadrazam'' ([[Grand Vizier]]) [[Kemankeş Mustafa Pasha]] (d. 1644).&lt;ref name=mw188/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gülersoy (1976) p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; As mentioned above, only the Hodegetria Icon could be moved with great difficulties to Galata.&lt;ref name =ma308/&gt;

After the relocation of the married [[Janissaries]] in the quarter in 1782, the mosque got the appellation of ''Odalar'' (In [[Turkish Language|Turkish]] "''Oda''" means "room" but also "barrack of the Janissaries"). Previously these were lodged at the ''Eski Odalar'' ("Old Barracks") near [[Şehzade Mosque]], which were destroyed in the fire of 1782.&lt;ref name=we1/&gt; The building decayed steadily (by the mid-19th century the dome had collapsed), and it was heavily damaged by the fire of Salmatomruk on 2 July 1919. When the quarter was rebuilt with modern criteria the edifice was not restored, and fell into ruin.&lt;ref name=we52 /&gt;

==Architecture==
As mentioned above, several constructive phases can be recognized in the building during the Byzantine period. The first church, erected in the middle Byzantine age, had an almost square plan (about 11.65 m x 10 m ) with three apses, and was oriented toward the East.&lt;ref name=mw188/&gt;  In 1935, only the tripartite sanctuary and the ''[[Bema]]'' were still visible.&lt;ref name=we37&gt;Westphalen (1998) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; The church was built on a basement composed of 24 vaulted rooms and a vaulted [[crypt]] with an apse, which is supposed to have been a chapel containing [[relics]].&lt;ref name=we24&gt;Westphalen (1998) p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;  These rooms had at first a profane usage, later they were used as burial place&lt;ref name=ey72/&gt; and finally as a cistern.&lt;ref name=we47&gt;Westphalen (1998) p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

The second church, erected at the end of the twelfth century, used also 16 small rooms of the abandoned first church's basement as substructure. The [[masonry]] was made of stone and bricks, and was erected with the technique of the ''recessed brick'',&lt;ref name=ma308/&gt;&lt;ref name=ja560&gt;Janin (1953), p. 560.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=we53&gt;Westphalen (1998) p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=we78&gt;Westphalen (1998) p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;  typical of the Byzantine architecture of the middle period.&lt;ref&gt;Krautheimer (1986), p. 400. Another example of edifices of Constantinople where this technique was used is the mosque of [[Eski Imaret Mosque|Eski Imaret]]&lt;/ref&gt; In this technique, alternate courses of bricks are mounted behind the line of the wall, and are plunged in a [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]]'s bed. Due to that, the thickness of the mortar layers is about three times greater than that of the bricks layers. In this building, three or four rows of bricks alternate with single rows of stones,&lt;ref name=we53/&gt; and the bricks are arranged to form several patterns.&lt;ref name=we78/&gt;

The second church was of the [[cross-in-square]] type with an almost square ''[[Cella#Christian_churches|naos]]'' about 10.5 m wide: it had four columns sustaining the dome through [[pendentives]], three [[apse]]s - the central one having a polygonal shape -&lt;ref name=mw188/&gt; and a [[narthex]] embracing the edifice on the west and north sides.&lt;ref name=we52&gt;Westphalen (1998) p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ja560/&gt; The dome was about 4.4. m wide, lay on a [[Tholobate|drum]] and was adorned with frescoes.&lt;ref name=we52/&gt; East of the ''naos'' lay a tripartite sanctuary composed of a ''bema'' flanked by a ''[[prothesis (altar)|prothesis]]'' and a ''[[diaconicon|diakonikon]]''.&lt;ref name=we60&gt;Westphalen (1998) p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; The floor of the new church was 3.3 m above that of the first church.&lt;ref name=mw188/&gt;  The edifice can be described as a middle-sized Byzantine church, similar to the nearby [[Eski Imaret Mosque|Church of Christ Pantepoptes]].&lt;ref name=we67&gt;Westphalen (1998) p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

From a relation of Pietro Demarchis, bishop of [[Santorini]], who visited Istanbul in 1622, we know that at that time the columns of the church had been taken away by the Turks and substituted with wooden pillars, and that the dome was covered with frescoes.&lt;ref name=we48/&gt; Moreover, part of the building was already menacing ruin.&lt;ref name=we48/&gt; Just after the conversion to mosque, to the building were added a [[mihrab]], a [[minbar]] and a [[minaret]]. After the fire of 1919, the building fell into ruin (the roof collapsed and the minaret crashed already in the 1820s), but luckily it was thoroughly studied and surveyed by the German Archaeologist Paul Schatzmann in 1934/1935.&lt;ref name=we5&gt;Westphalen (1998), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the Greek scholar Alexandros G. Paspates, in the East part of the basement of the Mosque sprung a [[Holy water in Eastern Christianity|water source]] ({{lang-el|αγίασμα}}, {{lang|el-latn|hagíasma}}, {{lang-tr|ayazma}}) dedicated to [[Saint John the Baptist]], abandoned for a long time.&lt;ref name=ma308/&gt;

==Paintings==

During the excavation of 1934/1935 up to four [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] layers covered with frescoes on blue background were uncovered.&lt;ref name=ey72/&gt;&lt;ref name=ma308/&gt; A [[fresco]] representing a [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]] on Throne with angels was found in the crypt.&lt;ref name=ja560/&gt; In the basement rooms were found fragments of paintings having as subject funerary themes.&lt;ref name=we85&gt;Westphalen (1998) p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; In the inferior church were discovered two [[deesis]], a fresco representing [[Saint Mercurius|the soldier Saint Mercurius]]  - of unparalleled technique among the known Byzantine works of this age - and prophets.&lt;ref name=ja560/&gt; These paintings were executed either in the tenth or in the middle of the eleventh century, belonging so to the first church. The diakonikon of the second church was adorned with frescoes showing saints and episodes of the [[Life of the Virgin]].&lt;ref name=ja560/&gt;&lt;ref name=we85/&gt; The best preserved frescoes (among them Saint Mercurius) were detached, restored and are on display at the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museum|Archaeological Museum of Istanbul]].&lt;ref name=ma308/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3028">'''Paper composite panels''' are a phenolic resin/cellulose [[composite material]] made from partially recycled [[paper]] and [[phenolic resin]]. Multiple layers of paper are soaked in phenolic resin, then molded and baked into net shape in a heated form or press.  Originally distributed as a commercial kitchen surface in the 1950s, it has recently been adapted for use in [[skateboard]] parks as well as various other applications, such as residential counters, cabinetty, fiberglass cores, guitar fingerboards, signage, exterior wall cladding, and a variety of architectural applications.

== Composition ==
There are several manufacturers in North America who use a different composition of materials to form the final product.  One composition is [[cellulose]] fiber and phenolic resin (a type of [[polymer]]) which is combined and baked for a smooth hard surface.  The natural fibers are made from plant, animal and mineral sources. However most natural fibers are predominantly cellulosic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.networx.com/article/eco-clad-sustainable-siding Eco-Clad sustainable siding].  Retrieved 2016-04-01&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Cellulose strand.svg|Molecular structure of a cellulose strand
&lt;/gallery&gt;

# Cellulose derived from tree pulp is turned into large rolls of paper. 
# The paper is then soaked in  phenolic resin and goes up to a heating chamber to be dried out before being rolled back up. 
# Then hundreds of these sheets are laid on top of each other and with the use of [[compression molding]] the stack is compacted. 
Because of the resin's [[thermoset]] properties the resulting cooled material is hard.

== Applications ==
It was used for the [[Boeing 747]] for their air tables, hydroforming dyes, vacuum chuck faces, work holders, and proofing materials. Architecturally, it is used for countertops. It has also been used for whaleboard in fiberglass boat building. Other commercial uses include cutting boards, prep tables, and pizza peels.

Since the last quarter of the 20th century, phenolic resin and cellulose based compound materials have been used as an alternative to ebony and rosewood to make stringed instrument fingerboards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.premierguitar.com/Magazine/Issue/2010/Apr/Martin_OMC_16OGTE_Acoustic_Guitar_Review.aspx ''Martin OMC-16OGTE Acoustic Guitar Review'', Premier Guitar, March 18, 2010].  Retrieved 2016-04-01&lt;/ref&gt;  From 2012, Gibson Guitar Corporation replaced the ebony fingerboard on the production [[Gibson Les Paul Custom|''Custom'']] with paper composite panels (Richlite).

== Properties ==
While it is formed of many layers of paper laminated together, it appears to be a solid material, and as such is not considered to be a [[sandwich panel]].  The panels' resistance to high temperature has been claimed to be up to 350 F.

[[File:Wagnersmaidens.jpg|thumb|250px|The three Rhinemaidens at play in the waters of the [[Rhine]]. Illustration from ''Stories of the Wagner Opera'' by [[H. A. Guerber]], 1905.]]
The '''Rhinemaidens''' are the three [[Naiad|water-nymphs]] (''Rheintöchter'' or "Rhine daughters") who appear in [[Richard Wagner]]'s opera cycle ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]''(1869-1876). Their individual names are '''Woglinde''', '''Wellgunde''' and '''Flosshilde''' ('''Floßhilde'''), although they are generally treated as a single entity and they act together accordingly. Of the 34&amp;nbsp;characters in the ''Ring'' cycle, they are the only ones who did not originate in the [[Old Norse]] ''[[Edda]]s''. Wagner created his Rhinemaidens from other  legends and myths, most notably the ''[[Nibelungenlied]]'' which contains stories involving water-sprites ([[Neck (water spirit)|nixies]]) or [[mermaid]]s. The key concepts associated with the Rhinemaidens in the ''Ring'' operas—their flawed guardianship of the [[Rhine River|Rhine]] gold, and the condition (the renunciation of love) through which the gold could be stolen from them and then transformed into a means of obtaining world power—are wholly Wagner's own invention, and are the elements that initiate and propel the entire drama.

The Rhinemaidens are the first and the last characters seen in the four-opera cycle, appearing both in the opening scene of ''[[Das Rheingold]]'', and in the final climactic spectacle of ''[[Götterdämmerung]]'', when they rise from the Rhine waters to reclaim the ring from [[Brynhildr|Brünnhilde]]'s ashes.  They have been described as morally innocent, yet they display a range of sophisticated emotions, including some that are far from guileless. Seductive and elusive, they have no relationship to any of the other characters, and no indication is given as to how they came into existence, beyond occasional references to an unspecified "father".

The various musical themes associated with the Rhinemaidens are regarded as among the most lyrical in the entire ''Ring'' cycle, bringing to it rare instances of comparative relaxation and charm. The music contains important melodies and phrases which are reprised and developed elsewhere in the operas to characterise other individuals and circumstances, and to relate plot developments to the source of the narrative. It is reported that Wagner played the Rhinemaidens' lament at the piano, on the night before he died in Venice, in 1883.&lt;ref&gt;Gutman, p. 634&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
Alone of the ''Ring's'' characters, the Rhinemaidens do not originate from  the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' or ''[[Prose Edda]]'', the Icelandic sources for most of Norse mythology.&lt;ref name = "Holman_174"&gt;Holman, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sprite_(folklore)#Water_sprite|Water-sprites]] (German: ''Nixen'') appear in many European myths and legends, often but not invariably in a form of disguised malevolence. Wagner drew widely and loosely from those legends when compiling his ''Ring'' narrative, and the probable origin of his Rhinemaidens is in the German ''Nibelungenlied''.&lt;ref name = "Cooke79_139"&gt;Cooke (1979), p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; In one part of the ''Nibelungenlied'' narrative [[Hagen (legend)|Hagen]] and [[Gunther]] encounter certain "wise women" (thereafter described as water-sprites), bathing and refreshing themselves in the waters of the [[Danube]]. Hagen creeps softly towards them, but he is seen, whereupon the sprites retreat and mock him from a distance. Hagen then steals their clothes. To obtain the return of these, one of the sprites, Hadeburg, promises falsely that Hagen and Gunther will find honor and glory when they enter [[Attila|Etzel]]'s kingdom. After their clothes are returned, another sprite, Sigelinde (a name Wagner would adopt again for use elsewhere), tells Hagen that her sister has lied. If they go to Etzel's land, they will die there.&lt;ref&gt;Mowat translation, stanzas 1528–54, pp. 142–43&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ring4.jpg|thumb|left|Alberich steals the gold: ''Das Rheingold'', Scene I – part of a series of ''Ring'' illustrations by [[Arthur Rackham]].]]
This story, itself unrelated to the ''Ring'' drama, is echoed by Wagner both in the opening ''[[Das Rheingold]]'' scene and in the first scene in Act III of ''[[Götterdämmerung]]''. Wagner first adapted the story for use in his early [[libretto]] of ''[[Sigurd|Siegfried's Death]]'' (which eventually became ''Götterdämmerung''), introducing three unnamed water-maids (''Wasserjungfrauen''),&lt;ref&gt;The number of sprites in the ''Nibelungenlied'' plot is not specified. Two are named, and the text suggests the possibility of a third.&lt;/ref&gt; and locating them in the [[Rhine]], where they warn Siegfried of his impending death.&lt;ref name = "Cooke79_139" /&gt; Later these water-maids became Rhinemaidens (''Rheintöchter''), and were given individual names: Flosshilde, Wellgunde, and Bronnlinde.&lt;ref name = "Newman_464"&gt;Newman, p. 464&lt;/ref&gt; As Wagner continued working on his reverse chronology from Siegfried's death, he arrived at what he determined was the initial act of the drama—[[Alberich]]'s theft of the Rhine gold. Believing that a simple abduction of the unguarded gold would lack dramatic force, Wagner made the Rhinemaidens the guardians of the gold, and he introduced the "renunciation of love" condition.&lt;ref name="Cooke79_138–40"&gt;Cooke (1979), pp. 138–40&lt;/ref&gt; Bronnlinde became Woglinde, probably to avoid confusion with [[Brynhildr|Brünnhilde]].&lt;ref name="Newman_464" /&gt;

Wagner may also have been influenced by the Rhine River-based German legend of [[Lorelei]], the lovelorn young maiden who drowns herself in the river and becomes a siren, luring fishermen onto the rocks by her singing.&lt;ref name = "Cooke79_138"&gt;Cooke (1979), p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; Further possible sources lie in [[Greek mythology]] and literature. Similarities exist between the maiden guardians in the [[Hesperides]] myth and the Rhinemaidens of ''Das Rheingold''; three females guard a highly desired golden treasure that is stolen in the telling of each tale.&lt;ref name = "Cooke79_140"&gt;Cooke (1979), p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; Wagner was an enthusiastic reader of [[Aeschylus]], including his ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'' which has a chorus of [[Oceanids]] or water nymphs. One author, Rudolph Sabor, sees a link between the Oceanids' treatment of [[Prometheus]] and the Rhinemaidens' initial tolerance of Alberich.&lt;ref name=Sabor&gt;Sabor pp. 91–2&lt;/ref&gt; Just as in Greek myth the Oceanids are the daughters of the [[Titan (mythology)|titan]] sea god [[Oceanus]], in [[Norse mythology]]—specifically the ''[[Poetic Edda]]''—the [[jötunn]] (similar to a [[giant (mythology)|giant]]) sea [[List of Germanic deities and heroes|god]] [[Ægir]] has [[Daughters of Ægir|nine daughters]]. The name of one of these means "wave" (''Welle'' in German) and is a possible source for Wellgunde's name.&lt;ref name=Sabor/&gt;

Wagner's operas do not reveal where the Rhinemaidens came from, or whether they have any connection to other characters. Whereas most of the characters in the cycle are inter-related, through birth, marriage, or sometimes both,&lt;ref&gt;Exceptions are Fasolt and Fafner who are only related to each other, and the Woodbird who is alone.&lt;/ref&gt; the Rhinemaidens are seemingly independent. The identity of their father who entrusted them with the guardianship of the gold&lt;ref&gt;"Father ... ordered us cleverly to guard the bright treasure...": Flosshilde in ''Das Rheingold'', Scene 1 (p. 26)&lt;/ref&gt; is not given in the text. Some Wagnerean scholars have suggested that he may be a "Supreme Being" who is the father of [[Woden|Wotan]] and all the gods—indeed, of all creation.&lt;ref name="Holman_173–75"&gt;Holman, pp. 173–75&lt;/ref&gt; Others take the German ''Rheintöchter'' literally and say that they are the daughters of the Rhine River.&lt;ref name=Spencer&gt;Spencer p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever is surmised, the Rhinemaidens are in a different category from Wotan and the other gods, who are destroyed by fire at the end of ''Götterdämmerung'', while the Rhinemaidens swim happily away in the river, bearing their recovered treasure.

== Nature and attributes ==
[[File:Ring17.jpg|thumb|The Rhinemaidens lament the loss of the gold as, far above, the gods cross [[bifröst|the rainbow bridge]] into Valhalla. ''Das Rheingold'', Scene IV (Arthur Rackham)]]
The Rhinemaidens have been described as the drama's "most seductive but most elusive characters",&lt;ref name="Holman_173–75" /&gt; and in one analysis as representatives of "seduction by infantile fantasy".&lt;ref&gt;Cooke (1979), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; They  act essentially as a unity, with a composite yet elusive personality. Apart from Flosshilde’s implied seniority, demonstrated by occasional light rebukes and illustrated musically by awarding the role to a deeper-voiced [[contralto]] or [[Mezzo-soprano|mezzo]], their characters are undifferentiated.&lt;ref name="Holman_173–75" /&gt; In ''The Perfect Wagnerite'', his 1886 analysis of the ''Ring'' drama as political allegory, [[George Bernard Shaw]] describes the Rhinemaidens as "thoughtless, elemental, only half-real things, very much like modern young ladies".&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The attributes most apparent initially are charm and playfulness, combined with a natural innocence; their joy in the gold they guard derives from its beauty alone, even though they know its latent power.&lt;ref name = "Holman_175"&gt;Holman, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; However, this veneer of childlike simplicity is misleading; aside from proving themselves irresponsible as guardians, they are also provocative, sarcastic and cruel in their interaction with Alberich.&lt;ref&gt;''Das Rheingold'', Scene I&lt;/ref&gt; When the demigod [[Loki|Loge]] reports that the Rhinemaidens need Wotan's help to regain the gold, [[Frigg|Fricka]], the goddess of marriage, calls them a "watery brood" (''Wassergezücht'') and complains about the many men they have lured away with their "treacherous bathing".&lt;ref&gt;Mann, ''Das Rheingold'' p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; They are beguiling and flirtatious with Siegfried,&lt;ref&gt;''Götterdämmerung'', Act III Scene I&lt;/ref&gt; but finally wise as revealed by the undisclosed counsel which they give to Brünnhilde.&lt;ref&gt;''Götterdämmerung'', Act III Scene III&lt;/ref&gt; Sabor sees the personality of the Rhinemaidens as a blend of the "good hearted nature" of the Oceanids and the "austerity" (including the willingness to drown people) of the daughters of Ægir.&lt;ref name=Sabor/&gt;

The first lines sung by Woglinde in the ''Ring'' are dominated by wordless vocalisations. ''Weia! Waga! ... Wagala weia! Wallala weiala weia!'' This attracted comment both at the 1869 premiere of ''Rheingold'' and the 1876 premiere of the entire ''Ring'', with Wagner's work being dismissed as "Wigalaweia-Musik".&lt;ref name=Spencer/&gt; In a letter to [[Nietzsche]] dated 12 June 1872, Wagner explained that he had derived ''Weiawaga'' from old German and that it was related to ''Weihwasser'', meaning holy water. Other words were intended as parallels to those found in German nursery lullabies ('Eia Poppeia', 'Heija Poppeia' and 'Aia Bubbeie' are common forms). Thus Woglinde's lines portray both the childish innocence of the Rhinemaidens and the holiness of Nature.&lt;ref name=Spencer/&gt;

The Rhinemaidens' sorrow in the loss of the gold is deep and heartfelt. As the gods are crossing [[bifröst|the rainbow bridge]] into [[Valhalla]] at the end of ''Das Rheingold'', Loge ironically suggests that, in the absence of the gold, the maidens should "bask in the gods’ new-found radiance".&lt;ref&gt;Cooke (1979), p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; The maidens' lament then becomes a stern reproof: ''"Tender and true are only the depths"'', they sing; ''"False and cowardly is all that rejoices up there"''.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, ''Das Rheingold'', p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; In the final ''Götterdämmerung'' scene they show ruthlessness as, having recovered the ring, they drag the hapless Hagen down into the waters of the Rhine.&lt;ref&gt;''Götterdämmerung'', Act III Scene III finale&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rhinemaidens are the only prominent characters seen definitely alive at the end of the drama; the fates of a few others are ambiguous, but most have certainly perished.&lt;ref&gt;Holman, pp. 399–402&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the relative brevity of their roles in the context of the four-opera cycle, they are key figures; their careless guardianship of the gold and their provocation of Alberich are the factors which determine all that follows. Wagner himself devised the "renunciation of love" provision  whereby the gold could be stolen and then used to forge a ring with power to rule the world. Since the ring is made from the stolen gold, only its restoration to the Rhinemaidens' care in the waters of the Rhine will lift the curse on it. Hence, the return of the stolen property provides a unifying thematic consistency to Wagner's complex story.&lt;ref name = "Holman_174" /&gt;

== Role in the Ring Operas ==

=== Das Rheingold, Scene 1 ===
[[File:Ring3.jpg|thumb|left|[[Alberich]] tries to reach the Rhinemaidens ([[Arthur Rackham]])]]
As the musical prelude climaxes, Woglinde and Wellgunde are seen at play in the depths of the Rhine. Flosshilde joins them after a gentle reminder of their responsibilities as guardians of the gold. They are observed by the Nibelung dwarf [[Alberich]] who calls out to them: "I'd like to draw near if you would be kind to me".&lt;ref&gt;Mann, ''Das Rheingold'' p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; The wary Flosshilde cries: "Guard the gold! Father warned us of such a foe".&lt;ref&gt;Mann. ''Das Rheingold'' p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; When Alberich begins his rough wooing the maidens relax: "Now I laugh at my fears, our enemy is in love",&lt;ref&gt;Mann, ''Das Rheingold'' p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; says Flosshilde, and a cruel teasing game ensues. First, Woglinde pretends to respond to the dwarf's advances but swims away as he tries to embrace her. Then Wellgunde takes over, and Alberich's hopes rise until her sharp retort: "Ugh, you hairy hunchbacked clown!"&lt;ref&gt;Mann, ''Das Rheingold'' p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Flosshilde pretends to chastise her sisters for their cruelty and feigns her own courtship, by which Alberich is quite taken in until she suddenly tears away to join the others in a mocking song. Tormented with lust, Alberich furiously chases the maidens over the rocks, slipping and sliding as they elude him, before he sinks down in impotent rage. At this point the mood changes: as a sudden brightness penetrates the depths, a magical golden light reveals, for the first time, the Rhinegold on its rock. The maidens sing their ecstatic greeting to the gold, which rouses Alberich's curiosity. In response to his question Woglinde and Wellgunde reveal the gold's secret: measureless power would belong to the one who could forge a ring from it. Flosshilde scolds them for giving this secret away, but her concerns are dismissed—only someone who has forsworn love can obtain the gold, and Alberich is clearly so besotted as to present no danger. But their confidence is misplaced; in his humiliation Alberich decides that world mastery is more desirable than love. As the maidens continue to jeer his antics he scrambles up the rock and, uttering a curse on love, seizes the gold and disappears, leaving the Rhinemaidens to dive after him  bewailing their loss.&lt;ref&gt;Holman, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Das Rheingold, Scene 4 ===
As Wotan, Fricka and the other gods start to cross the rainbow bridge leading to [[Valhalla]], they hear a melancholy song from the depths of the Rhine—the maidens, mourning the loss of the gold. Embarrassed and irritated, Wotan tells Loge to silence the maidens, but as the gods continue across the bridge the  lament rises again, now with bitter words of reproach to the gods for their heartlessness.&lt;ref&gt;Holman, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Götterdämmerung, Act 3 Scene 1 ===
[[File:Albert Pinkham Ryder 004.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Sigurd|Siegfried]] encounters the Rhinemaidens. Oil on canvas by [[Albert Pinkham Ryder]], c. 1875–91]]
Some time has passed (at least two generations). In a remote wooded valley where the Rhine flows, the ageless Rhinemaidens continue to mourn for the gold, pleading with the "[[Sól (Sun)|Sun-woman]]" to send them a champion who will return the gold to them. Siegfried's horn is heard, and he soon appears, having lost his way while hunting. The maidens greet him with their old playfulness and offer to help him, for the price of the ring on his finger. After a flirtatious exchange, Siegfried offers, apparently sincerely, to give them the ring. But instead of wisely simply accepting his offer, the mood of the naive, formerly flirtatious  Rhinemaidens suddenly becomes solemn: they warn Siegfried he will be killed that very day unless he delivers the ring to them. But brave Siegfried will never submit to any such implied threat and declares: "By threatening my life and limb, even if it weren't worth as much as a finger, you won't get the ring from me!"&lt;ref name= Mann&gt;Mann, ''Götterdämmerung'', p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; The maidens are scornful of his folly: "Farewell, Siegfried. A proud woman will today become your heir, scoundrel! She'll give us a better hearing".&lt;ref name= Mann/&gt; Siegfried is not aware that it is to Brünnhilde that they refer. They swim off, leaving a puzzled Siegfried to ponder their words and to admit to himself that he could happily have seduced any one of them.&lt;ref&gt;Holman, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Götterdämmerung, Act 3 Scene 3 ===
In her final soliloquy, [[Brynhildr|Brünnhilde]] thanks the Rhinemaidens for their "good advice". They have apparently told her the full story of Siegfried's ensnarement and betrayal, and advised that only the return of the ring to the waters of the Rhine can lift its curse. Brünnhilde sings: "What you desire I will give you: from my ashes take it to yourselves. The fire...will cleanse the curse from the ring".&lt;ref name= Mann2&gt;Mann, Götterdämmerung, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; She exhorts the Rhinemaidens to "carefully guard it" in the future, then leaps into the flames of Siegfried's pyre. The fire blazes up to fill the stage, representing the destruction of the gods. As the Rhine overflows its banks the Rhinemaidens appear, making for the ring. Hagen, who covets the ring, shouts to them "Get back from the ring!" (''Zurück vom Ring!''),&lt;ref name= Mann2/&gt; the last words of the drama. He is seized by Woglinde and Wellgunde and dragged into the Rhine's depths, as Flosshilde grabs the ring, holds it aloft, and joins her sisters  swimming in circles as the waters of the Rhine   gradually subside.&lt;ref&gt;Holman,  p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rhinemaidens' music ==
The music associated with the Rhinemaidens has been portrayed by the Wagner commentator James Holman as "some of the seminal music in the ''Ring''";&lt;ref name= Holman176&gt;Holman, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; other descriptions have noted its relative charm and relaxation.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, p. 253&lt;/ref&gt;

In  Woglinde's opening song to the Rhine: "Weia! Waga! Woge, du Welle,..." (''Das Rheingold'', Scene 1)  the melody is [[pentatonic]], using the notes  E flat, F, A flat, B flat and C.&lt;ref&gt;North p.16&lt;/ref&gt; The song begins with a two-note falling step (F followed by E flat), a figure which recurs in many musical [[Leitmotif|motives]] throughout the ''Ring''.&lt;ref name= Holman176/&gt; The melody itself is reprised during Fricka's denunciation of the Rhinemaidens in ''Das Rheingold'', Scene 2 and, dramatically, at the end of ''Götterdämmerung'' when, after Brünnhilde's immolation, the Rhinemaidens rise from the river to claim the ring from Siegfried's funeral pyre. Its first five notes, with an altered rhythm, become the motive of the sleeping Brünnhilde in ''Die Walküre'', Act 3.&lt;ref&gt;Cooke (1967 audio) Ex.25&lt;/ref&gt; A variant of the tune becomes the Woodbird's greeting "Hei! Siegfried" in Act 2 of ''Siegfried''. The Rhinemaidens and the Woodbird, in [[Deryck Cooke]]'s analysis, are related through nature,&lt;ref&gt;Cooke (1967 audio) Ex. 23&lt;/ref&gt; as "fundamentally innocent allies of the natural world".&lt;ref&gt;Holman, p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Rhinemaidens' joy and greeting to the gold": "Heiajaheia, Heiajaheia! Wallalallalala leiajahei! Rheingold! Rheingold!..." (''Das Rheingold'' Scene 1) is a  triumphant greeting song based on two elements, which are developed and transformed later in the ''Ring'' and put to many uses. For example, the joyful "heiajaheia" cries are converted, in ''Rheingold'' Scene 2, into a dark [[Major and minor|minor]] version as Loge reports the theft of the gold to the gods and the consequent rising power of the Nibelungen.&lt;ref&gt;Cooke (1967 audio), Ex. 30&lt;/ref&gt; The "Rheingold!" repetition is sung by the Rhinemaidens to the same falling step that marked the start of Woglinde's song. This figure recurs constantly in the later stages of the drama; in ''Das Rheingold'' Scene 3 a  minor [[Key (music)|key]] version is used as a motive for the evil power of the ring that Alberich has forged from the gold.&lt;ref&gt;Cooke (1967 audio) Ex. 34–35&lt;/ref&gt; It comes to represent the theme of servitude to the ring; in ''Götterdämmerung'', enslaved to the ring by his desire for it, Hagen utters his "Hoi-ho" call to his vassals using the same minor two-note figure.&lt;ref&gt;Cooke (1967 audio), Ex. 37–38&lt;/ref&gt;

The   lament "Rheingold! Rheingold! Reines Gold!..." (''Das Rheingold'' Scene 4) is sung by the maidens at the end of ''Das Rheingold'', as the gods begin to cross the Rainbow Bridge into Valhalla. It begins with the music from the greeting, but develops into what [[Ernest Newman]] describes as a "haunting song of loss", which becomes increasingly poignant before it is drowned by the orchestral [[Dynamics (music)#Relative loudness|fortissimo]]   that ends the opera.&lt;ref name= Newman518&gt;Newman, pp. 518–59&lt;/ref&gt;  A slow version of the lament is played on the horns in ''Siegfried'', Act 2, as Siegfried enters [[Fafnir (Norse mythology)|Fafner]]'s cave to claim the gold—the lament, says Cooke, serves to remind us of the gold's true ownership.&lt;ref&gt;Cooke (1967 audio), Ex. 27–28&lt;/ref&gt; The lament is played spiritedly during the ''Götterdämmerung'' prologue, as part of the orchestral interlude known as ''Siegfried's Rhine Journey'',  before a shadow falls across the music as it descends into the minor key of the "servitude" motive.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, p. 629&lt;/ref&gt;

Newman describes the Rhinemaidens' scene with Siegfried": Frau Sonne..." and "Weilalala leia..." (''Götterdämmerung'', Act 3 Scene 1),   as a "gracious woodland idyll".&lt;ref&gt;Newman, p. 655&lt;/ref&gt; The musical elements associated with the Rhinemaidens in this scene have not previously been heard; Holman describes them as alluding to the maidens' seductive nature, as well as conveying a sense of nostalgia and detachment, as the drama approaches its conclusion.&lt;ref name= Holman176/&gt;

== On stage ==
[[File:1876Rhinemaiden machinery.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A contemporary picture of the machinery used for the swimming Rhinemaidens at the 1876 premiere of the ''Ring'', as seen from backstage]]

From the first complete production of the ''Ring'', at the [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus]] in 1876, it was established that the Rhinemaidens should be depicted in conventional human form, rather than as mermaids or with other supernatural features, notwithstanding Alberich's insult to Wellgunde: "Frigid bony fish!" (''Kalter, grätiger Fisch!'').&lt;ref&gt;''Das Rheingold, Scene 1&lt;/ref&gt; The staging of their scenes has always been a test of ingenuity and imagination, since Wagner's stage directions include much swimming and diving and other aquatic gymnastics.&lt;ref&gt;See libretto, ''Das Rheingold'', Scene 1, ''Götterdämmerung'', Act III Scene I&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, therefore, much use has been made of backdrops and lighting to achieve the necessary watery effects. Until the [[Second World War]], under the influence of [[Cosima Wagner]] and her (and Wagner's) son [[Siegfried Wagner|Siegfried]], a policy of "stifling conservatism" was applied to Bayreuth stagings of the ''Ring'' operas.&lt;ref name= Holman373&gt;Holman, pp. 373–76&lt;/ref&gt; Although there had been some innovation in productions staged elsewhere, it was not until the postwar revival of the Festival in 1951 that there were any significant changes in Bayreuth's presentation of the ''Ring'' operas. Since 1976, in particular, innovation at the Festival and elsewhere has been substantial and imaginative.&lt;ref name= Holman373/&gt;

In the original 1876 production, the Rhinemaidens were wheeled around on stands behind semi-transparent screens. The [[stage machinery]] and the lighting effects were designed by Carl Brandt, who was the foremost stage technician of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Sabor p.167&lt;/ref&gt; One innovation which Cosima did eventually approve was the replacement of the wheeled stands with giant, invisible "fishing rods" on which the Rhinemaidens were dangled.&lt;ref name="Sabor_a"&gt;Sabor p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; Wires continued to be used in the Bayreuth productions of Siegfried Wagner and, later, those of his widow [[Winifred Wagner|Winifred]], who ran the Bayreuth Festival until the end of the Second World War. Similar techniques have been used in more modern productions. In the 1996 Lyric Opera of [[Chicago]] ''Ring'' cycle, repeated in 2004–05, the Rhinemaidens were suspended on [[bungee cord]]s anchored in the [[fly system|fly space]] above the stage, enabling them to dive up and down, as intended by Wagner. The Rhinemaidens were played on-stage by gymnasts, mouthing words sung by singers standing in a corner of the stage.&lt;ref&gt;Holman, p. 390&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Weber|first= W|title= Rhinemaidens Turn Bungee Jumpers |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/02/arts/music/02circ.html|work=New York Times|accessdate= 29 April 2008| date=2 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Covent Garden Rhinemaidens.jpg|thumb|220px|Keith Warner's Covent Garden production uses lighting to convey the impression of being underwater and nudity to display the natural innocence of the Rhinemaidens.]]
The 1951 Festival production, by Siegfried's and Winifred's son [[Wieland Wagner|Wieland]], broke with tradition and featured an austere staging which replaced scenery and props with skilful lighting effects. The Rhinemaidens, along with all the other characters, were plainly dressed in simple robes, and sang their roles without histrionics. Thus the music and the words became the main focus of attention.&lt;ref name= Holman373/&gt; Wieland was influenced by [[Adolphe Appia]], whose ''Notes sur l'Anneau du Nibelungen'' (1924–25) had been dismissed by Cosima: "Appia seems to be unaware that the ''Ring'' was performed here in 1876. It follows that the staging is definitive and sacrosanct."&lt;ref name="Sabor_a" /&gt; However, Wieland and his brother [[Wolfgang Wagner|Wolfgang]] praised Appia: "...&amp;nbsp;the stylised stage, inspired by the music and the realisation of three-dimensional space – constitute the initial impulses for a reform of operatic stagings which led quite logically to the 'New Bayreuth' style."&lt;ref&gt;Programme for 1955 Bayreuth Festival quoted Sabor p.201&lt;/ref&gt;

The innovative centenary Bayreuth ''Ring'', directed by [[Patrice Chéreau]], did away altogether with the underwater concept by setting the Rhinemaiden scenes in the lee of a large hydro-electric dam, as part of a 19th-century [[Industrial Revolution]] setting for the operas.&lt;ref&gt;Holman, p. 381&lt;/ref&gt; For the scene with Siegfried in ''Götterdämmerung'', Chéreau altered the perpetual youth aspect of the Rhine Maidens by depicting them as "no longer young girls merrily disporting themselves; they have become tired, grey, careworn, and ungainly".&lt;ref&gt;Hans Schürman: An Annotated Synopsis based on Patrice Chéreau's production of ''Götterdämmerung'', Bayreuth Festival 1977. Published by Phillips as a programme note to 1980 recording of the Festival production.&lt;/ref&gt; Since this production "the assumption of unrestricted interpretive license has become the norm".&lt;ref name= Holman373/&gt; For example, Nikolaus Lehnhoff, in his 1987 [[Bayerische Staatsoper]] production, placed the Rhinemaidens in a salon and had their lament at the end of ''Rheingold'' played on a gramophone by Loge.&lt;ref&gt;Sabor p.204&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1876Rhinemaidens.jpg|thumb|220px|The 1876 premiere cast of the ''Ring'' included [[Lilli Lehmann]] (centre) as Woglinde. She was the first of many significant singers to play one of the Rhinemaidens.]]
[[Peter Hall (theatre director)|Peter Hall]] directed the Bayreuth ''Ring'' after Chéreau. His version, staged 1983–86, portrayed the natural innocence of the Rhinemaidens in the simplest of ways; they were naked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Henahan|first= D|title= Opera: ''Das Rheingold'' at festival in Bayreuth|url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B00EED61339F934A15754C0A965948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all|work=New York Times|accessdate= 29 April 2008| date=27 July 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Keith Warner]] adapted this feature in his ''Ring'' production for the [[Royal Opera House]] [[Covent Garden]], first staged 2004–06. A Covent Garden spokesman explained "The maidens are children of innocence, a vision of nature – and as soon as someone appears they hastily throw on some clothes to protect their modesty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Alleyne|first= R|title= Rhinemaidens in the nude make Wagner a sell-out at the ROH|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1479297/Rhinemaidens-in-the-nude-make-Wagner-a-sell-out-at-the-ROH.html|work=Daily Telegraph|accessdate= 9 April 2008| location=London | date=18 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Warner relies on lighting to achieve an underwater effect, Hall used a [[Pepper's ghost]] illusion: mirrors at a 45° angle made the Rhinemaidens appear to swim vertically when the performers were in fact swimming horizontally in a shallow basin.&lt;ref&gt;Sabor p.192&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the roles of the Rhinemaidens are relatively small, they have been sung by notable singers better known for performing major roles in Wagnerian and other repertoire. The first person to sing the part of Woglinde in full was [[Lilli Lehmann]] at Bayreuth in 1876.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, p. 474&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, when the Bayreuth Festival re-opened after the Second World War, the same part was taken by [[Elisabeth Schwarzkopf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Wagner Society Library Information|url= http://www.wagnersociety.org/Library.HTM|publisher= The Wagner Society|accessdate= 9 October 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509145313/http://www.wagnersociety.org/Library.HTM|archivedate=9 May 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Bayreuth Rhinemaidens include  [[Helga Dernesch]] who sang Wellgunde there between 1965 and 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Randel, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lotte Lehmann]]  played Wellgunde at the [[Hamburg State Opera]] between 1912 and 1914 and the [[Vienna State Opera]] in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= The Lotte Lehmann Chronology|url= http://voxnovamedia.com/lehmann/chronology/index.html|author = Gary Hickling|publisher= [[Lotte Lehmann Foundation]]|accessdate= 5 June 2010|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100425062744/http://voxnovamedia.com/lehmann/chronology/index.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate= 25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Recorded Rhinemaidens have included [[Sena Jurinac]] for [[Wilhelm Furtwängler|Furtwängler]] and [[RAI]],&lt;ref&gt;Sabor, pp. 228–29&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lucia Popp]] and [[Gwyneth Jones (soprano)|Gwyneth Jones]] for [[Georg Solti]],&lt;ref&gt;Sabor, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Helen Donath]] and [[Edda Moser]] for [[Herbert von Karajan|Karajan]].&lt;ref&gt;CD recording DG 457 781 2 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Secondary Organic Aerosols''' or '''SOA''' are [[molecule]]s produced via [[oxidation]] over several generations of a parent organic molecule.&lt;ref name=jpca&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Secondary Organic Aerosol Formation from Low-NOx Photooxidation of Dodecane: Evolution of Multigeneration Gas-Phase Chemistry and Aerosol Composition|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jp211531h|journal = The Journal of Physical Chemistry A|date = 2012-06-21|issn = 1089-5639|pages = 6211–6230|volume = 116|issue = 24|doi = 10.1021/jp211531h|first = Lindsay D.|last = Yee|first2 = Jill S.|last2 = Craven|first3 = Christine L.|last3 = Loza|first4 = Katherine A.|last4 = Schilling|first5 = Nga Lee|last5 = Ng|first6 = Manjula R.|last6 = Canagaratna|first7 = Paul J.|last7 = Ziemann|first8 = Richard C.|last8 = Flagan|first9 = John H.|last9 = Seinfeld|bibcode = 2012JPCA..116.6211Y}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to primary organic aerosols, which are emitted directly from the [[biosphere]], secondary organic aerosols are formed via [[nucleation#Homogeneous|homogeneous nucleation]] through the successive oxidation of [[gas]]-phase [[organic compound]]s. These gas-phase species exert high [[vapor pressure]]s, meaning they are volatile and stable in the gas-phase, however, upon oxidation, the increased [[chemical polarity|polarity]] of the molecules results in a reduction of vapor pressure. After sufficient oxidation, the vapor pressure is sufficiently low that the gas-phase compound partitions into the [[solid]]-phase, producing secondary organic matter.

SOAs represent a significant proportion of [[aerosol]]s contained in the [[troposphere]].&lt;ref name=jpca/&gt;

A common misconception is that the aerosol refers to the solid phase of the compound, where in reality, by definition, it is the combination of the gas- and solid-phases which constitute the aerosol.

{{Weather}}

'''Spring''' is one of the four conventional [[Temperate climate|temperate]] [[season]]s, following [[winter]] and preceding [[summer]]. There are various technical definitions of spring, but local usage of the term varies according to local climate, cultures and customs. When it is spring in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], it is [[autumn]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] and vice versa. At the spring (or vernal) [[equinox]], [[Daytime (astronomy)|days]] and nights are approximately twelve hours long, with day length increasing and night length decreasing as the season progresses.

Spring and "springtime" refer to the season, and also to ideas of rebirth, rejuvenation, renewal, resurrection and regrowth. [[Subtropical]] and [[tropical]] areas have climates better described in terms of other seasons, e.g. dry or wet, monsoonal or cyclonic. Cultures may have local names for seasons which have little equivalence to the terms originating in Europe.

== Meteorological reckoning ==
Meteorologists generally define four seasons in many climatic areas: spring, summer, autumn (fall) and winter. These are demarcated by the values of their average temperatures on a monthly basis, with each season lasting three months. The three warmest months are by definition summer, the three coldest months are winter and the intervening gaps are spring and autumn. Spring, when defined in this manner, can start on different dates in different regions.

Thus, in the [[United States|US]] and [[United Kingdom|UK]], spring months are March, April and May,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Spring |title=Spring|work=Glossary of Meteorology|accessdate=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Met Office: Spring|url=https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/learning/seasons/spring|accessdate=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in [[New Zealand]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherwatch.co.nz/content/poll-do-you-want-dates-our-seasons-changed |title=Do you want the dates of our seasons changed? |publisher=New Zealand weatherwatch |accessdate=2014-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Australia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian Bureau of Meteorology - Climate Glossary - Seasons|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/glossary/seasons.shtml|website=Australian Bureau of Meteorology|publisher=bom.gov.au|accessdate=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; spring conventionally begins on September 1 and ends November 30.

[[Sweden|Swedish]] meteorologists define the beginning of spring as the first occasion on which the average daytime temperature exceeds zero degrees Celsius for seven consecutive days, thus the date varies with latitude and elevation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.se/18200/20090313 |title=Sweden braces for warm spring weather |publisher=Thelocal.se |date= |accessdate=2013-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Astronomical and solar reckoning==
[[File:Equinozio da Pizzo Vento,tramonto fondachelli fantina, sicilia.JPG|thumb|alt=blue sky and sun setting behind mountain|Astronomical [[vernal equinox]] seen from the site of Pizzo Vento at [[Fondachelli-Fantina|Fondachelli Fantina]], [[Sicily]]]]
In some cultures in the Northern Hemisphere (e.g. Germany), the astronomical [[March equinox|vernal equinox]] (varying between 19 and 21 March) is taken to mark the first day of spring, and the [[summer solstice]] (around 21 June) is taken as the first day of summer. In Persian culture the first day of spring is the first day of the first month (called [[Farvardin]]) which begins on 20 or 21 March. In other traditions, the equinox is taken as mid-spring.

In the [[Chinese calendar|traditional Chinese calendar]], the [[Chun (season)|"spring" season]] ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|春}}}})  consists of the days between [[Lichun]](February 3–5), taking [[Chunfen]] (March 20th-22nd) as its midpoint, then ending at [[Lixia]] (May 5–7). Similarly, according to the [[Celtic tradition]], which is based solely on daylight and the strength of the noon sun, spring begins in early February (near [[Imbolc]] or [[Candlemas]]) and continues until early May ([[Beltane]]).

==Ecological reckoning==
The beginning of spring is not always determined by fixed calendar dates. The [[Phenology|phenological]] or [[Ecology|ecological]] definition of spring relates to biological indicators, such as the blossoming of a range of plant species, the activities of animals, and the special smell of soil that has reached the temperature for micro [[flora]] to flourish. These indicators, along with the beginning of spring, vary according to the local [[climate]] and according to the specific [[weather]] of a particular year. Most ecologists divide the year into six seasons that have no fixed dates. In addition to spring, ecological reckoning identifies an earlier separate '''prevernal''' (early or pre-spring) season between the hibernal (winter) and vernal (spring) seasons. This is a time when only the hardiest flowers like the crocus are in bloom, sometimes while there is still some snowcover on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Michael Allaby | title = A Dictionary of Zoology | year = 1999 | url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O8-prevernal.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130602225322/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O8-prevernal.html | archivedate = 2013-06-02 | accessdate= 2012-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During early spring, the axis of the Earth is increasing its tilt relative to the Sun, and the length of daylight rapidly increases for the relevant hemisphere. The hemisphere begins to warm significantly, causing new plant growth to "spring forth," giving the season its name.{{cn|date=February 2017}} 

Any [[snow]] begins to melt, swelling streams with [[Surface runoff|runoff]] and any [[frost]]s become less severe. In climates that have no snow, and rare frosts, air and ground temperatures increase more rapidly.

Many flowering plants bloom at this time of year, in a long succession, sometimes beginning when snow is still on the ground and continuing into early summer.{{cn|date=March 2016}} In normally snowless areas, "spring" may begin as early as February (Northern Hemisphere) or August (Southern Hemisphere), heralded by the blooming of deciduous magnolias, cherries, and quince.{{cn|date=March 2016}} Many temperate areas have a dry spring, and wet autumn (fall), which brings about flowering in this season, more consistent with the need for water, as well as warmth. [[Subarctic]] areas may not experience "spring" at all until May.

While spring is a result of the warmth caused by the changing orientation of the Earth's axis relative to the Sun, the weather in many parts of the world is affected by other, less predictable events. The rainfall in spring (or any season) follows trends more related to longer cycles&amp;mdash;such as the [[solar cycle]]&amp;mdash;or events created by ocean currents and ocean temperatures&amp;mdash;for example, the [[El Niño]] effect and the [[Southern Oscillation Index]].

Unstable spring weather may occur more often when warm air begins to invade from lower [[latitude]]s, while cold air is still pushing from the [[Polar region]]s. Flooding is also most common in and near mountainous areas during this time of year, because of snow-melt which is accelerated by warm rains. In North America, [[Tornado Alley]] is most active at this time of year, especially since the [[Rocky Mountains]] prevent the surging hot and cold air masses from spreading eastward, and instead force them into direct conflict. Besides [[tornado]]es, [[supercell|supercell thunderstorm]]s can also produce dangerously large [[hail]] and very high winds, for which a [[severe thunderstorm warning]] or [[tornado warning]] is usually issued. Even more so than in winter, the [[jet stream]]s play an important role in unstable and severe Northern Hemisphere weather in springtime.{{cn|date=March 2016}}

In recent decades, [[season creep]] has been observed, which means that many [[phenology|phenological]] signs of spring are occurring earlier in many regions by around two days per decade.

Spring in the Southern Hemisphere is different in several significant ways to that of the Northern Hemisphere for several reasons, including:
#there is no land bridge between [[Southern Hemisphere]] countries and the [[Antarctic]] zone capable of bringing in cold air without the temperature-mitigating effects of extensive tracts of water;
#the vastly greater amount of ocean in the Southern Hemisphere at most latitudes;
#at this time in Earth's geologic history the Earth has an orbit which brings it in closer to the Southern Hemisphere for its warmer seasons;
#there is a circumpolar flow of air (''[[Roaring Forties|the roaring 40s and 50s]]'') uninterrupted by large land masses;
#no equivalent jet streams; and
#the peculiarities of the reversing ocean currents in the Pacific.{{cn|date=March 2016}}

In some regions,{{which|date=March 2016}} the first spring festival of the new year is [[Carnival]], 40 days before Easter.{{cn|date=March 2016}}

===Easter===
{{Main|Easter}}
[[File:Unfinished pysanka.jpg|thumb|100px|[[Easter eggs]], such as this Ukrainian one, signify the [[Resurrection of Jesus]].]]
Easter is the most important religious feast in the Christian [[liturgical year]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Aveni, "The Easter/Passover Season: Connecting Time's Broken Circle," ''The Book of the Year: A Brief History of Our Seasonal Holidays'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004), 64–78.&lt;/ref&gt;
Christians believe that [[Jesus]] was [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrected]] from the dead on the "third day"&lt;ref&gt;This resurrection is commonly said to have occurred "on the third day after resting for the Sabbath(Friday sundown to Saturday sundown), including the day of crucifixion." (e.g. Luke 24:21 KJV)&lt;/ref&gt; (two days ''after'' his [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]]), and celebrate this resurrection on Easter Day, two days after [[Good Friday]]. The date of Easter varies between 22 March and 25 April (which corresponds to between 4 April and 8 May in the [[Gregorian Calendar]] for the [[Eastern Orthodox|Eastern]] and [[Oriental Orthodox]] Churches using the [[Julian Calendar]]). In the Southern Hemisphere Easter occurs during [[autumn]].

===May Day===
{{Main| May Day}}
{{Further|Beltane}}
1 May is the date of many [[public holiday]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Aveni, "May Day: A Collision of Forces," ''The Book of the Year: A Brief History of Our Seasonal Holidays'' (Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]], 2004), 79–89.&lt;/ref&gt; In many countries, May Day is synonymous with [[International Workers' Day]], or [[Labour Day]], which celebrates the social and economic achievements of the [[labour movement]]. As a day of celebration, the holiday has ancient origins, and it can relate to many customs that have survived into modern times. Many of these customs are due to May Day being a [[cross-quarter day]], meaning that (in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] where it is almost exclusively celebrated) it falls approximately halfway between the [[spring equinox]] and [[summer solstice]]. In the Celtic tradition, this date marked the end of spring and the beginning of summer.

'''Stainless steel fibers''' are manufactured [[fibers]] composed of [[stainless steel]]. Composition may include [[carbon]] (C), [[silicon]] (Si), [[manganese]] (Mn), [[phosphorus]] (P), [[sulfur]] (S), and other elements.

==Producers==
Currently stainless steel fibers are manufactured primarily in Europe.

==Properties==
#Oxydation Withstanding
#Electrical Conductivity
#thermal resistance 

==Application==
The most common uses for stainless steel fibers is in the field of the electrical and textiles industry such as anti-radiation cloth, thermal resistant fabric, and anti-static brushes. Many people also use stainless steel fibers in [[weaving]]. Increasingly common today are stainless steel fibers in clothing, including [[radiation]] protection for [[pregnant]] women{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}. Stainless steel yarns are woven, braided, and knit into many industrial fabrics. For additional variety, stainless steel yarns are twisted with other fibers such as [[wool]], [[nylon]], [[cotton]], and synthetic blends to produce yarns which add novelty effects to the end cloth. Stainless steel and other metal fibers are used in [[communication]] lines such as telephone lines and [[cable television]] lines. Stainless steel fibers are also used in [[carpet]]s. They are dispersed throughout the carpet with other fibers so they are not detected. The presence of the fibers helps to conduct electricity so that the [[Static electricity|static]] shock is reduced. These types of carpets are often used in computer-use areas where risks of electrostatic discharge are much greater. Other uses include [[tire]] cord, [[missile]] nose cones, work clothing such as protective suits, space suits, and cut resistant gloves for [[butcher]]s and other people working near bladed or dangerous machinery.

[[Image:Porters.PNG|right|thumb|250px|Comparison of transport proteins]]
A '''uniporter'''  is an [[integral membrane protein]] that transports a single type of [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] species ([[Electric charge|charged]] or uncharged) across a cell membrane. It may use either [[facilitated diffusion]] and transport along a [[diffusion]] gradient or transport against one with an [[active transport]] process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordreference.com/abstract/10.1093/acref/9780198529170.001.0001/acref-9780198529170-e-20301?rskey=4US0W9&amp;result=20204 Article in ''The Oxford Dictionary of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology'']&lt;/ref&gt;. They can be either  [[ion channel]]s or [[carrier protein]]s.

Uniporter carrier proteins work by binding to one [[molecule]] of [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] at a time. Uniporter channels open in response to a stimulus and allow the free flow of specific molecules.

There are several ways in which the opening of uniporter channels may be regulated:

# [[Voltage]] – Regulated by the difference in voltage across the membrane
# [[Stress (physics)|Stress]] – Regulated by physical [[pressure]] on the transporter (as in the [[cochlea]] of the [[ear]])
# [[Ligand]] – Regulated by the binding of a ligand to either the intracellular or extracellular side of the [[cell (biology)|cell]]

Uniporters are involved in many [[Biology|biological]] processes, including [[action potential]]s in [[neuron]]s. Voltage-gated [[sodium channel]]s are involved in the propagation of a [[nerve impulse]] across the neuron. During transmission of the signal from one neuron to the next, [[calcium]] is transported into the [[presynaptic neuron]] by voltage-gated [[calcium channel]]s. [[Potassium leak channel]]s, also regulated by voltage, then help to restore the resting [[membrane potential]] after impulse transmission.

In the ear, [[sound wave]]s cause the stress-regulated channels in the ear to open, sending an impulse to the [[vestibulocochlear nerve]] (VIII).

Vyacheslav continues to travel: he has been to many places of local conflicts and ecological disasters. In 2013 he’s planning to make a journey entitled, “Ruta del Che” (“The way of Che Guevara”), by motorcycle in South America along the route of [[Ernesto Che Guevara]], and has begun creating a feature-length fictional film, “The Year of Spring” ({{lang-ru|Год весны}}).&lt;ref name="Forbes" /&gt;

'''Young Bosnia''' ({{lang-sh|Mlada Bosna}}/Млада Босна) was a [[revolutionary movement]] active in the [[Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] before [[World War I]]. The members were predominantly school students, primarily [[Bosnian Serbs]], but also [[Bosnian Muslims]] and [[Bosnian Croats]]. There were two key ideologies promoted amongst the members of the group, the [[Yugoslavist]] (unification into a [[Yugoslavia]]), and the [[Pan-Serb]] (unification into [[Serbia]]). Young Bosnia was inspired from a variety of ideas, movements, and events; such as German [[romanticism]], [[anarchism]], Russian [[revolutionary socialism]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], and the [[Battle of Kosovo]].

==Background==
The rise to power of the popular [[Karađorđević dynasty]] in Serbia in the 1900s after the [[May Overthrow]] of the Obrenović dynasty by the Serbian Army in 1903, stimulated support by both Serbs and South Slavs for their unification into a state led by Belgrade.{{sfn|Djokić|2003|p=59}} Support for revolutionary Yugoslavism in Bosnia grew with the rise of the [[Serbo-Croatian Progressive Organization]] in 1911, and drew in support for the cause from Serbs as well as Croats and some Muslims.&lt;ref name=Pavlowitch-90/&gt;

==Formation, membership and ideology==
It was formed during the 1900s in the [[Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (an annexed condominium of [[Austria-Hungary]]), with significant influence from neighbouring [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]].&lt;ref name=B2&gt;{{cite book|author=John R.

== Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria ==
{{Main article|Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria}}
Two notable organizations are referred to in connection with Young Bosnia: [[Narodna Odbrana]] and [[Black Hand (Serbia)|Black Hand]].
During a Serbian [[kangaroo court]] in French-occupied [[Salonika]] in 1916–17, Chief of Serbian Military Intelligence [[Dragutin Dimitrijević Apis]] testified that he had organized the [[assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]], in Sarajevo on 28 June 1914, (the assassin was [[Gavrilo Princip]]). In the process, he used not only his power over elements of the Serbian military, but also the Black Hand. Leaders of the Black Hand in turn had penetrated Narodna Odbrana and used that organization to infiltrate the arms and assassins into Sarajevo.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''"The political union of the Yugoslavs [..] was my basic idea [..] I am a Yugoslav nationalist, aiming for the unification of all Yugoslavs, and I do not care what form of state, but it must be free from Austria"''&lt;br&gt;-[[Gavrilo Princip]] during his trial{{sfn|Banac|1988}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

 [[File:Vidovdanski heroji.jpg|thumbnail|Vidovdan Heroes' Memorial in Sarajevo]]

Claimed members of Young Bosnia who participated in the assassination were:

*[[Danilo Ilić]] (1891 – 3 February 1915)
*[[Veljko Čubrilović]] (1 July 1886 – 3 February 1915)
*Miško Jovanović (executed 3 February 1915)
*[[Nedeljko Čabrinović]] (2 February 1895 – 20 January 1916)
*[[Vladimir Gaćinović]] (25 May 1890 – 11 August 1917)
*[[Trifko Grabež]] (June 1895 – February 1916)
*[[Gavrilo Princip]] (25 July 1894 – 28 April 1918)
*[[Muhamed Mehmedbašić]] (1886 – 29 May 1943)
*[[Cvjetko Popović]] (1896 – 9 June 1980)
*[[Vaso Čubrilović]] (14 January 1897 – 11 June 1990)

An evening before the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, Princip, Čabrinović and Ilić visited the grave of [[Bogdan Žerajić]] for the last time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Stand To!: The Journal of the Western Front Association|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gPAWAQAAIAAJ|year=2003|publisher=The Association|page=44|quote=On the evening before 28 June 1914 Princip, Cabrinovic and Ilic paid a last visit to the grave of Bogdan Zerajic in Sarajevo. Zerajic had planned an assault ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Žerajić's proclamation "He who wants to live, let him die. He who wants to die, let him live", was quoted by [[Gavrilo Princip]] in one of the songs he wrote ({{lang-sr|Ал право је рекао пре Жерајић, соко сиви: Ко хоће да живи, нек мре, Ко хоће да мре, нек живи}}).&lt;ref name="Marković1961"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marković|first=Marko|title=Članci i ogledi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1UYjAAAAMAAJ|year=1961|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
===Museum of Young Bosnia===
The Museum of Young Bosnia was built in the period of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]] in 1953, at the place where the assassination took place.  It commemorates the assassins, popularly known in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia as the "[[Vidovdan]] heroes". At the front of the museum was a plaque, inscribed: "From this place, on 28 June 1914, Gavrilo Princip, expressed with his shot the people's revolt against tyranny and their centuries-old struggle for freedom. (Са овога мјеста 28. јуна 1914. године Гаврило Принцип својим пуцњем изрази народни протест против тираније и вјековну тежњу наших народа за слободом.)"  In 1992, soldiers of the [[Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] destroyed both the plaque and Princip's footprints.  German forces had removed the 1930 plaque in 1941. The [[Museum of Sarajevo 1878–1918|museum]] still exists today, but nowadays documents aspects of life in Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina during Austro-Hungarian rule.
