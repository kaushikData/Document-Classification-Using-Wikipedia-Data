[[Image:PriestleyChart.gif|thumb|right|320px|A redacted version of Priestley's ''Chart of Biography'' (1765)]]
In 1765, 18th-century British [[polymath]] [[Joseph Priestley]] published '''''A Chart of Biography''''' and its accompanying prose description as a supplement to his ''[[Lectures on History and General Policy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''A Chart of Biography''. London: J. Johnson, St. Paul's Church Yard, 1765 and Joseph Priestley, ''A description of a chart of biography''. [Warrington] : Printed at Warrington, 1764; ''A Description of a Chart of Biography''. Warrington: Printed by William Eyres, 1765.&lt;/ref&gt; Priestley believed that the chart and ''[[A New Chart of History]]'' (1769) would allow students to "trace out distinctly the dependence of events to distribute them into such periods and divisions as shall lay the whole claim of past transactions in a just and orderly manner."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Sheps, 141-2.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''Chart of Biography'' covers a vast timespan, from 1200 BC to 1800 AD, and includes two thousand names. Priestley organized his list into six categories: Statesman and Warriors; Divines and Metaphysicians; Mathematicians and Physicians (natural philosophers were placed here); Poets and Artists; Orators and Critics (prose fiction authors were placed here); and Historians and Antiquarians (lawyers were placed here). Priestley's "principle of selection" was fame, not merit; therefore, as he mentions, the chart is a reflection of current opinion. He also wanted to ensure that his readers would recognize the entires on the chart. Priestley had difficulty assigning all of the people listed to individual categories; he attempted to list them in the category under which their most important work had been done. [[Machiavelli]] is therefore listed as a historian rather than a statesman and [[Cicero]] is listed as a statesman instead of an orator. The chart was also arranged in order of importance; "statesmen are placed on the lower margin, where they are easier to see, because they are the names most familiar to readers."&lt;ref&gt;Sheps, 144.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McLachlan, 253; Sheps, 142-5.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Both ''Charts'' were popular for decades—the ''[[A New Chart of History]]'' went through fifteen editions by 1816.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The trustees of Warrington were so impressed with Priestley's lectures and charts that they arranged for the [[University of Edinburgh]] to grant him a [[Doctor of Laws|Doctor of Law degree]] in 1764.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, 118-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Australia ==
Architectural education in Australia varies depending on the university offering the course. All Australian architecture schools and programs have recently moved to some variation on the 3 + 2 Bologna model, with a three-year undergraduate degree, followed by a two-year course-work based Master of Architecture professional degree. Some universities also require 6–12 months of practice work experience between the two degrees. Registration as an architect is via state-based boards and requires a minimum of two years practice experience under the supervision of a registered architect. In addition there are double degrees offered by many universities, such as those combining architecture with construction or landscape architecture. Some universities also offer masters programs in architecture via coursework or research. Many architecture faculties offer related programs in landscape architecture, urban planning, urban design, property and construction. Entry to Australian architecture programs is highly competitive and the proportion of students at some architecture schools from outside Australia is very high, up to 40%.

==France==

In France, architectural education is offered in various independent schools of architecture, both private and public. The first step of architectural education is the ''Diploma of Studies in Architecture'', a three-year degree equivalent to a Bachelor of Architecture. This degree does not allow registration as an architect, awardees must pursue a [[Master of Architecture]] in order to obtain vocational qualification.

==India==
In India, Bachelor of Architecture lasts for five years. Specialised institutes founded by the government of India, for excellence in the field of architecture and planning are SPAs (Schools of Planning and Architecture). They are Institutes of National Importance through an act in the Parliament, on the lines of IITs, NITs and IIMs. Currently there are three such SPAs, with the MHRD ([[Ministry of Human Resource Development]]) mulling over setting up more such institutes.

==Turkey==
Architectural education is offered in various universities as a four-year program. The language of the program depends on the university.

== United Arab Emirates ==
The [[American University of Sharjah]] is the first university outside of North America to offer a B.Arch. that is officially accredited by the US-based [[National Architectural Accrediting Board]] (NAAB).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aus.edu/media/news/show_article.php?Article=950 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827010056/http://www.aus.edu/media/news/show_article.php?Article=950 |archivedate=2010-08-27 }} AUS architecture program becomes first outside North America to receive prestigious NAAB accreditation&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
{{main|Architectural education in the United Kingdom (19c-20c)}}
Architectural education differs slightly in the [[United Kingdom]]. A five-year course used to exist in a similar fashion to the United States, but the 1960s saw the introduction of the [[sandwich course]] and a split of the B.Arch. into a 3-year BA (Hons.) degree (or in some cases BSc) followed by a year working in practice, after which a 2-year MA, PG-DipArch, M.Arch. or B.Arch. is completed. A further year of work completes the student's education upon the passing of Part III final examinations (See below). Registration as an architect is then permissible by the [[Architects Registration Board]]. Many UK universities offer postgraduate programs by coursework and research in architecture and related fields such as landscape architecture, planning, and urban design.

===The RIBA three-part examinations===
In effect, for most students to become an architect in the United Kingdom they must pass or be exempted from parts I,II and III of the RIBA's examinations. Completion of the three-year BA or BSc gives an exemption from Part I. Completion of the two-year DipArch, M.Arch. or B.Arch. gives exemption from Part II and the final two years of supervised practical training, with supplemental examinations and assignments, makes up the requirements for Part III.

An alternative route to qualification exists by sitting the exams directly - currently this administered by [[Oxford Brookes University]] on behalf of the RIBA.

==United States==
The Bachelor of Architecture is accredited by the [[National Architectural Accrediting Board]] (NAAB) as a [[professional degree]], allowing the recipient to qualify for the [[Architect Registration Examination]] (ARE). NAAB-accredited B.Arch. programs must include at least 150 semester credit hours, or the quarter-hour equivalent, of which at least 45 semester hours, or the quarter-hour equivalent are in general studies.

There are also universities that offer a four-year degree such as a Bachelor of Science in Architectural Studies or a Bachelor of Science in Architecture (B.S.Arch) or a Bachelor of Arts in Architectural Studies (B.A.Arch). These are non-accredited, pre-professional degrees, and so these students must enroll in a [[Master of Architecture]] (M.Arch) program to be professionally licensed. However, enrolling in a pre-professional program often gets a student into a shorter M.Arch program.  Any architecturally-related curriculum may eventually make licensure possible, depending upon the laws or regulations of the jurisdiction in which you wish to be licensed.

The course of study of the Bachelor of Architecture includes studio courses on [[design]] and [[aesthetics|aesthetic theory]], as well as practical courses on [[structures]], [[HVAC|building mechanical systems]], [[electrical engineering|electrical systems]], [[plumbing]] and [[construction]]. Student work is often in the form of drawings and renderings, either through [[computer-aided design]] or [[technical drawing|drafting]] by hand. Students also build physical models and create presentation boards for drawings and graphics.

In nearly all architecture schools in the United States, student life and work revolves around a studio class. Other classes in the architecture curriculum are designed to support the concepts emphasized in studio. One particularly rigorous aspect of studio classes is the "critique" or "review." Students "pin-up" their models and presentation drawings for instructors (and students) who offer constructive criticism.

Colleges and universities in the United States where either an NAAB accredited Bachelor of Architecture or Master of Architecture degree can be obtained are listed below. Many schools offer an M.Arch as the first professional degree, preceded by a nonprofessional B.A./B.S. in Architecture undergraduate degree.

'''Birdie Alexander''' (March 24, 1870 - August 2, 1960) was an [[United States|American]] educator and music teacher. She was a charter member of the [[National Association for Music Education|Music Supervisors' National Conference]]. Alexander is credited with laying the foundations of music education in the [[Dallas]] public schools.

== Biography ==
Alexander was born on March 24, 1870 in [[Lincoln County, Tennessee]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fal07|title=Alexander, Birdie|last=Swann|first=Lelle|date=9 June 2010|website=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, she and her family moved to Texas and she attended school in [[Forney, Texas]] and also at [[Mary Nash College]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She returned to Tennessee to study piano and voice at [[Ward-Belmont College|Ward Seminary]], graduating in 1891.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When she graduated, she and her family moved to [[Dallas]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/18900921/el_paso_heraldpost/|title=Miss Alexander Taken by Death|last=|first=|date=2 August 1960|work=El Paso Herald-Post|access-date=2018-04-04|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|page=1|language=en|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander became the [[Dallas Independent School District|Dallas Public School's]] music supervisor and worked there for twelve years during which she established a "first rate system of music education."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She organized special concerts for students with conductor [[Walter Fried]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Alexander was a charter member of the  [[National Association for Music Education|Music Supervisors' National Conference]], founded in 1907.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; When officials cut back on music programs, Alexander created her own music [[textbook]], published in 1912, called ''Songs We Like to Sing''.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Alexander was also instrumental in bringing a [[Victor Talking Machine Company|victrola]] to play music for her students.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She was also invited to lecture on music education at the [[University of Texas at Dallas|University of Texas]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3013585/el_paso_heraldpost/|title=Music Teacher Survives TB and a Broken Back|last=Carroll|first=Ann|date=21 June 1957|work=El Paso Herald-Post|access-date=2018-04-04|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander moved to [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]] for health reasons in 1913 after contracting [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Her brother-in-law, Robert B. Homan, Sr., was a physician and ran a [[sanatorium]] in El Paso called [[Homan's Sanatorium|Homan's San]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Alexander stayed at the sanatorium for four years where she worked in the office and didn't feel that she would be able to go back to teaching music.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Eventually, Alexander began to give piano lessons for her niece and word began to spread and soon Alexander had many students.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; There were times when she had more students than she could teach and in those situations, she would refer them to other teachers.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Alexander was made an honorary life member of the [[Music Teachers National Association|National Music Teachers' Association]] of Texas in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/68871574|title=Miss Alexander Taken by Death|last=|first=|date=2 August 1960|work=El Paso Herald-Post|access-date=2018-04-04|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|page=2|language=en|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formerly, she had served as president of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/18872309/el_paso_herald/|title=Miss Goff Elected Scy.

[[File:Café des Phares, Place de la Bastille, Paris.JPG|thumb|The Café des Phares (Paris) - the first café philosophique in the world]]
'''Café philosophique''' ("cafe-philo") is a grassroots forum for philosophical discussion, founded by philosopher [[Marc Sautet]] in Paris, France, on December 13, 1992.&lt;ref name = "chaplin282"&gt; Chaplin, p. 282 ''Philosopher Marc Sautet started the first "cafe-philo" at the Cafe des Phares on the Place de la Bastille in Paris.''&lt;/ref&gt;

There were about 100 "cafés-philo" operating throughout France and some 150 cafés-philos internationally at the time of Sautet's death in 1998.&lt;ref name ="simons"&gt;{{cite news | first1 = Marlise | last1 = Simons | title = Thought For Food: Cafes Offer Philosophy In France | newspaper = New York Times | date = May 2, 1998 | pages = B9 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/02/arts/thought-for-food-cafes-offer-philosophy-in-france.html?pagewanted=all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept ==

The subjects discussed at the cafes had a range that varied from the Santa Claus myth to truth to beauty to sex to death. They posed such questions as ''What is a fact?'' and ''Is hope a violent thing?'' Sautet made the discussions seem fun and exciting. The concept was to bring people together in a public friendly forum where they could discuss ideas. A cafe tended to have this type of atmosphere where people were relaxed drinking coffee and carrying on conversations. This concept ultimately developed into Café Philosophique that he founded.&lt;ref name ="cafephilo"&gt;[http://www.philodialogue.com/history.htm Cafe philo]&lt;/ref&gt;

Thousands of participants in philosophy cafes worldwide have adopted Sautet's idea as a way to enhance their thinking. Ideas are thrown out with concern for accuracy and philosophical rigor. The concepts discussed were in the spirit of tolerance and openness. The idea of Sautet's philosophy cafes have spread around the world. The concept that started in France and subsequently entered England, Germany, Belgium, Austria, Switzerland, Finland and eventually throughout Europe is now in Canada, South America, Greece, Australia, Japan and the United States.&lt;ref name = "steeped"/&gt; Due to this success, the French president [[Jacques Chirac]] sent a founding member on a good will mission to Latin America to introduce the concept there.&lt;ref name ="simons"/&gt;

== History ==

=== Predecessors ===

The [[French Institute for Scotland]] in [[Edinburgh]] also runs a café philosophique in Edinburgh - continuing a tradition that dates back to the days of the great Francophile philosopher [[David Hume]]. Staff of The French Institute for Scotland are also involved in teaching philosophy in Scottish primary schools, as an example in [[Clackmannan]]. In England, a Cafe Philosophique has been meeting in a Cromford (Derbyshire) bookshop cafe since being founded by Wirksworth philosopher-potter Evan Rutherford in 1993, and by 2009 had held around 100 meetings. The public evenings are usually led by members and associates of the ever-changing group rather than by professional philosophers, but prospective speakers are welcome to propose topics; the text of some of the talks can be read online.

The [[Ottoman empire]] expanded throughout Europe in the 17th century. From [[Vienna, Austria|Vienna]] came the idea of a place where men could meet and discuss various topics over coffee or tea ([[Viennese coffee house]] culture). Adapted to Western culture, the Turkish "coffee cafes" became the place where friends met for a drink. The tradition of the [[Agora]] was moved from the public square to the center city cafe. Philosophers, poets, writers, and intellectuals of all types made these places their new meeting places.

In 1686 the Sicilian [[Francesco Procopio dei Coltelli]] started ''[[Café Procope]]'' in ''rue de l'Ancienne Comédie'', in the Latin Quarter of Paris known as the [[6th arrondissement of Paris|6th arrondissement]]. It was the first café in Paris. Certain intellectuals that have frequented the cafe for philosophical discussions throughout history have been [[Victor Hugo]], [[Paul Verlaine]], [[Honoré de Balzac]] [[Pierre Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais]], [[François-Marie Arouet]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Georges Danton]], [[Jean-Paul Marat]], [[Honoré de Balzac]] and [[Denis Diderot]] amongst others.

For about 30 years in Paris, poets, painters, writers and part of the [[surrealist]] movement went to cafés of [[Montparnasse]]. Also in Paris after World War II the cafes of the Latin quarter saw a form of [[existentialism]]. The philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] conducted philosophical discussions at the [[Café de Flore]]. These "coffee philos" were the historical beginnings of Sautet's "cafés-philos".

=== Café philosophique ===

Sautet started the idea of philosophy cafes in the [[Place de la Bastille]] neighborhood of Paris at the Café des Phares on December 13, 1992.&lt;ref name = "chaplin282"/&gt; He would gather some friends at his "café philos" each Sunday at 11 A.M. and opened up philosophical debates ("conceptual fisticuffs") for some two hours. His philosophy was a return to the basic principles of reasoning intended for the general public, not [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mail-archive.com/ctrl@listserv.aol.com/msg38904.html ''Steeped in Thought: The Philosophy Café Movement''] by Joshua Glenn, contributing editor, Britannica.com&lt;/ref&gt; The first meetings started with only a dozen or so people. Soon university students showed up, followed by eccentric citizens off the street, off-duty cab drivers, and idle wealthy women.&lt;ref name ="obit"&gt;Obituary - "The Times" newspaper of London (UK): Apr 1, 1998.  pg. 21&lt;/ref&gt; This became a weekly event that grew in popularity to about 200 people at each meeting.&lt;ref name="steeped"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.zftrans.com/bbs/simple/index.php?t15052.html# |title=Steeped in Thought: The Philosophy café Movement |access-date=2009-05-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004043657/http://www.zftrans.com/bbs/simple/index.php?t15052.html# |archive-date=2011-10-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sautet returned philosophy to the general public in Café Philosophique. In so doing, he was rejected by scholars as being unfaithful to the normal philosophy taught in [[higher education]].&lt;ref&gt;Marinoff, p. 338&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Canadian English]], the term '''[[college]]''' usually refers to a technical, applied arts, or applied science school. These are [[Tertiary education|post-secondary]] institutions granting [[Academic certificate|certificate]]s, [[diploma]]s, [[associate's degree]], and [[bachelor's degrees]].

==Terminology==

In English [[Canada]], the term "[[College#Canada|college]]" is usually used to refer to technical schools that offer specialized professional or vocational education in specific employment fields. They include colleges of applied arts and technology, colleges of applied sciences, etc.

In [[Ontario]] and [[Alberta]], and formerly in [[British Columbia]], there are also institutions which are designated [[University college#Canada|university college]]s, as they only grant under-graduate degrees. This is to differentiate between universities, which have both under-graduate and graduate programs and those that do not. There is a distinction between "college" and "university" in Canada. In conversation, one specifically would say either "They are going to university" (i.e., studying for a three- or four-year degree at a university) or "They are going to college" (suggesting a technical or career college).

*[[List of Ontario Colleges of Applied Arts and Technology|Ontario Colleges]]
*[[New Brunswick Community College]]

===Quebec===
{{main|College education in Quebec}}
In [[Quebec]], mostly with speakers of [[Quebec English]], the term "college" is seldom used for post secondary education. Instead the word "[[CEGEP]]" ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|iː|dʒ|ɛ|p}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|eɪ|ʒ|ɛ|p}}) has become the more common term. CEGEP is a loanword from the French acronym '''Cégep''' or '''CÉGEP''' (''Collège d'enseignement général et professionnel''), meaning "College of General and Vocational Education". A CEGEP is a public [[College education in Quebec|college]] in the [[Education in Quebec|Quebec education system]], offering either a two-year diploma, which allows on to continue onto university (unless one applies as a 'mature' student, meaning 21 years of age or over, and out of the educational system for at least two years), or a three-year diploma in a variety of trades and technologies (e.g. nursing, mechanical engineering or computer science).

===Differences from American and British usage===

In American English, (and in formal British English as well) the word [[college]] is especially used for what Canadians would call the undergraduate level of a university, but in popular use it refers to all post secondary studies. Canadians, on the other hand, use the word [[university]] for both undergraduate and graduate post-secondary studies.

== Other uses  ==

===Art college===

These are schools specializing in fine arts and design which have four-year undergraduate programs. Many are universities, meaning they also have the ability to grant postgraduate degrees; in Canada these include the [[Nova Scotia College of Art and Design University|Nova Scotia College of Art and Design University (NSCAD)]], [[Emily Carr University of Art and Design]], and [[Ontario College of Art and Design University|Ontario College of Art and Design University (OCAD)]]. The [[Alberta College of Art and Design|Alberta College of Art and Design (ACAD)]] currently grants undergraduate degrees only, and thus does not have the status of university.

===Military college===

The [[Royal Military College of Canada]], a full-fledged degree-granting university, does not follow the naming convention used by the rest of the country, nor does its sister school [[Royal Military College Saint-Jean]] or the now closed [[Royal Roads Military College]].

===Institution within a university===

The term "college" also applies to distinct entities within a university (usually referred to as "[[federated school|federated colleges]]" or "affiliated colleges"),to the residential colleges in the United Kingdom. These colleges act independently, but in affiliation or federation with the university that actually grants the degrees. For example, [[University of Trinity College|Trinity College]] was once an independent institution, but later became federated with the [[University of Toronto]], and is now one of its residential colleges. Occasionally, "college" refers to a subject specific faculty within a university that, while distinct, are neither ''federated'' nor ''affiliated''—College of Education, College of Medicine, College of Dentistry, College of Biological Science,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uoguelph.ca/cbs/&lt;/ref&gt; among others.

===Collegiate institutes (high school)===

In a number of Canadian cities, high schools are called "[[collegiate institute]]s" (C.I.), a complicated form of the word "college" which avoids the usual "post-secondary" connotation. The term "collegiate institute" first appeared in Ontario after the 1900s in the name of high schools because at the higher grades it was one of very few forms of education besides a "formal" university. Another reason is that going back in history secondary schools have traditionally focused on academic, rather than vocational subjects and ability levels, for example, collegiates offered Latin while vocational schools offered technical courses. In Ontario at one time schools that focused on vocational educational were "officially" called High school/ secondary school and went up to grade 12, while schools that went up to grade 13, and prepared students for University were called "Collegiate Institute"

Due to their early history when education streams were few or non-existent, some early schools (which were mostly private at the time) were composed of levels reaching and including university at times. In Ontario and Quebec these now private secondary schools, such as [[Upper Canada College]]) choose to still use the word "college" in their names.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/general/elemsec/privsch/search.asp Private Elementary and Secondary Schools] search form on the Ministry of Education of Ontario web site—enter "college" in the "name contains" field and check the "secondary" checkbox&lt;/ref&gt; Some secondary schools elsewhere in the country, particularly ones within the [[separate school]] system, may also use the word "college" or "collegiate" in their names.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sbinfo.edu.gov.on.ca/schadv.asp Find a School or School Board] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908182055/http://sbinfo.edu.gov.on.ca/schadv.asp |date=2009-09-08 }} search form on the Ministry of Education of Ontario web site—click "Secondary" and "Separate"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Association===

A small number of the oldest professional associations use "college" in the name in the British sense, such as the [[Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada]].

Prior to 1987, the University existed as a campus of the University of Zambia Federal System with two schools; namely: School of Business and Industrial Studies (SBIS) and School of Environmental Studies (SES). The campus was referred to as the University of Zambia at Ndola (UNZANDO) until 1 December 1987. As of 1 January 1989 the Zambia Institute of Technology (ZIT) was incorporated into the Copperbelt University to form the School of Technology. Since 1987, the University has significantly grown from only two faculties to ten by the end of 2013; it now provides very unique programmes that have not been replicated elsewhere. The total number of students in 2017 was 11,900 and having had over 54,000 students in the past 25 years. The University too is proud of its graduates who are holding key responsibilities in various sectors of the economy within the country and beyond. At its first graduation ceremony in 1992, the University had only 100 students then graduating from the various disciplines but graduating average of 1,500 as at 2017.

In 2014, the School of Medicine received US$1 million in donation from the [[Council of Zambian Jewry]],  of the [[African Jewish Congress]] and the [[World Jewish Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/14643/zambian_jews_support_one_of_zambia_s_medical_schools_with_a_generous_donation Zambian Jews support one of Zambia's medical schools with a generous donation], World Jewish Congress, April 18, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Deutsche Verkehrsfliegerschule''' (DVS), German Air Transport School, was a [[Covert operation|covert military-training organization]] operating as a [[Flight training|flying school]] in [[Germany]]. It began during the [[Weimar Republic]] in [[Staaken]], [[Berlin]] in 1925 and its head office was transferred in 1929 to [[Broitzem]] airfield near [[Braunschweig]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://deposit.ddb.de/cgi-bin/dokserv?idn=975984101&amp;dok_var=d1&amp;dok_ext=pdf&amp;filename=975984101.pdf Dirk Richhardt, ''Auswahl und Ausbildung junger Offiziere 1930–1945''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522081531/http://deposit.ddb.de/cgi-bin/dokserv?idn=975984101&amp;dok_var=d1&amp;dok_ext=pdf&amp;filename=975984101.pdf |date=2011-05-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DVS was outwardly a flying school for commercial pilots, but in fact became a secret military arm training military aviators for the future [[Luftwaffe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goldenyears.ukf.net/reg_D-7.htm Golden Years of Aviation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201093531/http://www.goldenyears.ukf.net/reg_D-7.htm |date=2008-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This training facility grew in importance in the initial stages of [[Nazi Germany]], while [[Deception|camouflaging]] as a harmless civilian organization (''Tarnorganisation''), at the time of [[German re-armament|Germany's rearmament]] in violation of the [[Versailles Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhm.de/lemo/html/biografien/SagebielErnst/index.html Ernst Sagebiel 1892-1970]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On May 31, 1945, after Nazi Germany's [[Aftermath of World War II|defeat in World War II]], the [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|American Military Government]] issued a special law outlawing the Nazi Party and all of its branches. Known as "Law number five", this [[Denazification]] decree disbanded the ''Deutsche Verkehrsfliegschule'' and its facilities were taken over by the occupying forces.

Some flying schools in Germany operatie under the same name in different locations in the country. All of them were established after the war.

The founding of the University of Mitrovica was part of a wider Kosovo government initiative to facilitate the access through higher education throughout Kosovo. This initiative included the opening of universities besides the University of Pristina in Prizren, Peja, Mitrovica and Gjilan.&lt;ref name="kryeministri-ks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kryeministri-ks.net/?page=2,9,3454|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302173835/http://www.kryeministri-ks.net/?page=2,9,3454 |archive-date=2014-03-02 |dead-url=yes|title=Prime Minister Tha&amp;ccedil;i: These projects are changing the lives of Gjilan&amp;#146;s citizens for the better, they are modernizing Gjilan and giving it a new look, a European look  - News - The Republic of Kosovo - The Office of the Prime Minister|accessdate=2014-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The programs where all accredited by KAA in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;KAA Accreditation Certificate – 01.10.2012 – 30.09.2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the opening of the University of Mitrovica, Mitrovica already hosted the Faculty of Applied Technical Sciences of the University of Pristina (FATS).&lt;ref&gt;External Evaluation Report. Faculty of Applied Technical Sciences renamed (FATS) of University of Pristina at Mitrovice, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

FATS cooperated with the German TU Bergakademie Freiberg &lt;ref&gt;KAA Accreditation Report – 2012, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Hochschule Ruhr West.&lt;ref&gt;KAA: External Evaluation Report. Faculty of Applied Technical Sciences (FATS) of University of Pristina at Mitrovice, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rector of the University of Mitrovica is Mr. Alush Musa.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.masht-gov.net/advCms/?id=20,2529,82,10,2013&amp;lng=Eng, retrieved 27.02.2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the academic year 2014/15 the University of Mitrovica had 2700 students enrolled, with who have worked 80 professors and assistants full-time, and 105 part times.

The corner stone for the new building for the existing faculties in Mitrovica was laid at 26.12.2012. The new building for the existing faculty costed 1.600.000&amp;nbsp;euro. The new public university of Mitrovica – it’s campuses – are planned to cost about 14.000.000&amp;nbsp;Euro.&lt;ref&gt;M-Magazin: Laying the cornerstone of the public university in Mitrovica, url, 01.03.2014.)Also: (http://www.masht-gov.net/advCms/?id=20,2529,82,10,2013&amp;lng=Eng, 16.02.2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''engineer's degree''' is an advanced [[academic degree]] in [[engineering]] that is conferred in [[Europe]], some countries of [[Latin America]], North Africa and a few institutions in the [[United States]].

In the [[United States]], the engineer's degree is at a more advanced level than a standard US master's degree. It may include a graduate thesis, and [[dissertation]] at the level of the doctorates such as the Ph.D.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=49–58|publisher=The [[UNESCO]] Press|location=Paris|date=1974|author=Antoly I. Bologomov|url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED107515.pdf|title=Comparability of Engineering Courses and Degrees}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== North America ==
=== United States ===
In the [[United States]], the engineer's degree normally requires a further year of study beyond a master's degree, or two years from a bachelor's degree, and often includes a requirement for a research thesis.&lt;ref name=MIT&gt;{{cite web|url=https://odge.mit.edu/gpp/degrees/masters/engineers-degree/|title=Engineer’s degree|publisher=MIT|accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stanford&gt;{{cite web|url=https://aa.stanford.edu/academics/graduate-programs/degree-engineer-post-ms-program|publisher=Stanford University|title=Degree of Engineer — Post MS Program|accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SCU&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scu.edu/engineering/academic-programs/department-of-electrical-engineering/graduate/engineers-degree/|title=Engineer's degree|publisher=Santa Clara University|accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Naval Postgraduate School]] the thesis is required to be "more extensive and complete in problem scope and solution than a master's thesis", although "not necessarily meeting the test of original research and contribution to fundamental knowledge that is applied to Ph.D. dissertations".&lt;ref name=NPS&gt;{{cite web|url=https://my.nps.edu/web/ece/engineer-degree|title= Electrical Engineer Degree Program|publisher=Naval Postgraduate School|accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], the engineer degree is explicitly set at the level of the preliminary Ph.D. examination, i.e. not including the research or thesis components.&lt;ref name=UCLA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalog.registrar.ucla.edu/ucla-catalog2017-85.html|title=UCLA General Catalog 2017-18|at=Engineer Degree|publisher=UCLA|accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The availability of degrees and the specific requirements differ considerably between institutions and between specialties within an institution. In the past, it was not uncommon for a would-be engineer to earn an engineering degree as their first and only college degree. But since [[World War II]] this has fallen out of favor, and it becomes continually more difficult to find a school that offers this option.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

A degree with some form of the word ''engineer'' or ''engineering'' in the title is not necessarily an engineer's degree. Particularly, a "[[Master of Engineering]]" (M.Eng.) or "[[Bachelor of Engineering]]" (B.Eng.) degree is ''not'' an Engineer's degree, nor is any other bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degree. Rather, the engineer's degree is in a category of its own. For example, a student with a B.S. and M.S. in [[electrical engineering]] might next earn the degree ''Electrical Engineer''. The person would then have a B.S. in E.E., a M.S. in E.E., and an E.E. degree. The former two are degrees in engineering, and only the latter degree is actually an engineer's degree.

=== Canada ===
Through the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB), [[Canadian Council of Professional Engineers|Engineers Canada]] accredits Canadian undergraduate engineering programs that meet the standards of the profession. Graduates of those programs are deemed by the profession to have the required academic qualifications to pursue further training towards becoming a licensed professional engineer in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineerscanada.ca/e/pr_accreditation.cfm|title=Accreditation Resources|work=Engineers Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[P.Eng]] license is the ultimate qualification for the practicing professional engineering in Canada.

In Canada, A CEAB-accredited engineer degree is the minimum academic requirement for registration as a P.Eng ([[professional engineer]]) anywhere in Canada, and the standard against which all other engineering academic qualifications are measured.&lt;ref name="apegm.mb.ca"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apegm.mb.ca/CEAB.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202014748/http://www.apegm.mb.ca/CEAB.html |archivedate=2014-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A graduate of a non-CEAB-accredited program must demonstrate that his or her education is at least equivalent to that of a graduate of a CEAB-accredited program.&lt;ref name="apegm.mb.ca"/&gt;

== Latin America ==
In [[Latin America]], a degree or title of "Ingeniero" is awarded after completing five years of college.  This may be translated as "Engineer", however, its international academic equivalence depends on each country's educational system, and can be compared to a six-year post-master's degree. Its award may imply obtaining a state [[licence]] to legally practice in the field, or a professional certification outside the academic environment.

=== Mexico ===
{{see also|Licentiate (degree)#Mexico}}
In [[Mexico]], the educational system follows closely that of the [[United States]]. University education is structured in three cycles, as ''Licenciatura'' (bachelor's degree), ''Maestría'' (master's degree), and ''Doctorado'' (doctorate).

The ''Ingeniero'' (Engineer) degree is awarded depending on the nature of the studies pursued. In order to be called an Engineer, one must have passed certain courses related to engineering and been awarded a professional [[credential]] (''cédula profesional'') that certifies him or her as an engineer. The graduate has different abilities and capabilities related to the nature of the title Engineer. In this case, having a professional [[credential]] (''cédula profesional'') in engineering allows you to undertake various engineering-only activities, and certifies the ability of the engineer to exercise their profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ceead.org.mx/LiteratureRetrieve.aspx?ID=137818|title=Ley del Ejercicio Profesional|last=LA H. XLIX LEGISLATURA DEL ESTADO DE MEXICO|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For engineering, completing all taught courses of a ''Licenciatura'' does not automatically award the graduate the title and [[licence]] of ''Ingeniero''; for this, it depends on the name of the career and having the prefix ''Ingeniería'' attached to the name of the degree. It is the case that many people finish all courses in an engineering program, they obtain the [[diploma]] and title of Engineer, and the professional credential, after getting their professional [[credential]] (''cédula profesional'').

Degrees in engineering require four to five years to complete. After this, the graduate may enroll in a postgraduate program, such as a [[master's degree]], or in exceptional cases, directly into a [[doctoral degree]].

=== Chile ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}
In Chile, the educational system does not strictly follow that of the United States. University education is structured in four cycles, as ''Licenciatura'' (bachelor's degree), ''Título Profesional'' (professional title), ''Magíster'' (master's degree) and ''Doctorado'' (doctorate or Ph.D).

In this case, the ''engineer'' status is a general denomination for a person who has a professional title in engineering (Título Profesional en Ingeniería). The title is obtained after six years of study; in this way including a bachelor's degree in science, which is obtained after four years of study.

As in other countries, students only need to obtain the bachelor's degree to enter a master's degree or doctoral program, which commonly take two and three years, respectively. Since a professional title will take six years of study, after obtaining this title the graduate can enroll directly into a [[doctoral degree]]. In this manner, the international academic equivalence of a professional title in Chile corresponds to a six-year post-master's degree.

== Europe (prior to the Bologna Process) ==
prior to the [[Bologna Process]], In most countries of [[continental Europe]], universities specializing in technical fields have traditionally awarded their students an engineer's degree after five years. This degree was typically the first university-awarded degree after finishing [[secondary education]], and completing it granted qualifications to further pursue a [[doctorate]].

Following German custom in higher education, the engineer's degree is called ''[[Diplom]]''. In addition to [[Germany]] itself, this system was common in states like [[Austria]], [[Belarus]], [[Belgium]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Finland]], [[Greece]], [[Hungary]], [[Montenegro]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]], [[Serbia]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], [[R. Macedonia]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Vietnam]].

=== Germany and Austria ===

In [[German language|German]], the traditional engineer's degree is called ''Diplom-Ingenieur''. This supersedes Ing. (Grad) the old form in Germany. (''Dipl.-Ing.'', in Austria also ''DI'') . This degree is generally equivalent to a [[Master's degree]], which is not to be confused with the old ''[[Magister (degree)|Magister]]'' degree. Most programs that used to lead to a ''Dipl.-Ing.'' degree lead to master's degrees today, as the ''Diplom-Ingenieur'' as an academic title is phased out because of the [[Bologna Process]]. However, some universities continue to hand out so-called equivalence certificates that certify the equivalence of a ''Dipl.-Ing.'' with the newly introduced M.Sc. Degrees.

The German "Universities of Applied Sciences" (''[[Fachhochschule]]'') award the traditional engineering degree ''Diplom-Ingenieur (FH)'' (''Dipl.-Ing. (FH)''). A requirement for the degree is to write a ''[[Diplom]]'' [[thesis]]. This is also being modified by the [[Bologna Process]], as bachelor's and master's degrees from a University of Applied Sciences are equal to degrees from a ''traditional'' university.&lt;ref&gt;Beschluss der Kultusministerkonferenz vom 10.10.2003 i.d.F. vom 07.02.2008)&lt;/ref&gt;
Universities of Applied Sciences are phased out and they are changed to universities with own faculties and research institutes. These universities are strongly focused on fields like computer science, engineering or business schools. Subjects like Law or Human Medicine etc. which requires a ''Staatsexamen'' (state exam) can only be studied at ''traditional'' universities. Since 2009, most Universities in Germany offer bachelor's degree programmes (B.Sc., B.Eng., M.Sc., M.Eng, M.C.A. and others) and Master programmes that lead to the academic degree Master of Science, Master of Engineering, Master of Business Administration and others.

In Austria there also exists the ''Ingenieur'' (respectively ''Ing.''). This is not an academic degree as it is given to graduates of a so-called ''HTL'' (''Höhere Technische Lehranstalt'') which is a high school with a very technical background. Graduates of these schools are allowed to start their studies at universities. The title ''Ingenieur (Ing.)'' could only be obtained after proof of at least three years of practice, which requires higher technical knowledge in the field of education.

With a revision of the Austrian engineer’s law (Ingenieurgesetz 2017&lt;ref&gt;Ingenieurgesetz 2017 [https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokument.wxe?Abfrage=BgblAuth&amp;Dokumentnummer=BGBLA_2017_I_23 BGBl. I Nr. 23/2017]&lt;/ref&gt;) in May 2017, the requirements of the conferment of the degree were tightened. Next to the existing requirements for graduation from a technical high school (HTL) and a verifiable practical experience of three years, the replicant must take an oral examination with a certified committee to prove advanced skills and knowledge in their field. As a result, the degree was included in the [[National Qualifications Framework]] on level 6, the same level as that of the bachelor's degree. The engineering degree does not meet the requirements to enter a master's program in Austria.

=== France ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}
In [[France]], the engineer's degree is called ''[[Diplôme d'Ingénieur]]'' (often abbreviated as ''Dipl. Ing.''), which is a postgraduate engineering degree (recognized as Master of Science in Engineering in the United States) delivered primarily by the French engineering [[Grandes Ecoles]] while the academic title is ''Ingénieur Diplômé'' (''ID''; Graduate Engineer) but is never used before the holder's name. While the title "Ingénieur" is unregulated and can be used even without an academic degree, anyone misusing the title "Ingénieur Diplomé" is liable for a fine and prison sentence.

The engineer's degree in France is obtained after five to six years of engineering studies after the [[Baccalauréat]] (high school diploma). The degree deliverance is regulated by the [[Commission des titres d'ingénieur]] (CTI) independent organism. The CTI mandates the French engineering schools (mainly [[Grandes Écoles]]) to deliver the ''Diplôme d'Ingénieur''. This degree has been officially considered as a European [[Master's Degree]] since the [[Bologna Process]].

After the French ''Baccalaureat'', about top 10 per cent of the students are accepted in "[[Classes Préparatoires aux Grandes Écoles]]" (intensive preparatory classes), where mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology and technology disciplines are taught. After two years of study in preparatory classes, students must take competitive national examinations (written and oral) in order to compete for a place in the engineering [[Grandes Ecoles]].

Otherwise, the ''Diplôme d'Ingénieur'' can be also delivered by engineering faculties affiliated to a French public university, but the curriculum must be accredited by the CTI. Admission to such programs is based on continuous assessments rather than a nationwide competitive examination.

=== United Kingdom ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}
The highest engineer qualification in the UK and Ireland is the [[Chartered Engineer (UK)|Chartered Engineer]] (C.Eng) which is a minimum of eight years but usually 12 years of education, training and professional peer reviewed practice process. Chartered Engineer is a terminal qualification. The academic qualification. which is minimum for gaining chartership in engineering is the Master of Engineering (MEng) or BEng plus MSc or MA in addition to four to six years peer-reviewed professional practice including a project report / thesis. In England, Northern Ireland and Wales this is a four-year course or a 'sandwich' five-year course (with one year spent working in industry). In Scotland, it is a five-year course. The Bachelor of Engineering (BEng) is usually a three-year course (four in Scotland), or can also include a year in industry. Many universities offer the BEng, and may then allow a transfer to the MEng.

The [[City and Guilds of London Institute]] have established a recognized route to higher engineering qualifications with the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET), the Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IMechE) and The Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE). CGLI has align the Graduate Diploma (level 6) and Postgraduate Diploma (level 7) with the registration requirements for Incorporated Engineer and Chartered Engineer status. The Graduate Diploma is set at the same level as the final year of a British BEng and its Postgraduate Diploma is set at the same level as the final year of a British MEng.
UK Professional institutions have delegated authority from the engineering council to approve university degrees and also award the Chartered Engineer qualification in a specific discipline.  For example, IMechE awards C.Eng, MIMechE, ICE awards CEng, MICE, and IET awards CEng, MIET.

Engineers who have been awarded a BEng(Ordinary) or BEng(Honours) and have appropriate training and experience in the workplace are able to apply to become an Incorporated Engineer (IEng), if the qualification has been accepted for this classification, by the engineering council. If an engineer has studied beyond the BEng for an MSc or has an MEng, they may apply to become a Chartered Engineer (CEng), once they have completed the required amount of postgraduate work-based competency training and experience. Competency and training requirements are met over a period of four to eight years in practice for a total of eight to 12 years education, training and professional responsibility. Formal structured postgraduate training schemes such as the monitored professional development programme administered by IMechE enables the engineer in training to satisfy the requirements for Chartered Engineer faster.[5]

Chartered Engineer and [[Incorporated Engineer]] titles awarded by the Engineering Council UK, are similar but not equivalent to North American Professional Engineer (PEng/PE) and Professional Technologist (PTech) designations, but with often a far greater geographical recognition. The UK and North American system of regulating engineering professional qualifications is very different and not equivalent. In the US and Canada engineering is a regulated profession in terms of practice and enforced by law and licensing. It is more than the regulation of engineering titles—like the UK. This means that many UK chartered Engineers who are grandfathered to the title or are non degree holders (HNC/HND) will not be recognized formally as professional engineers in Canada and US. There is strict interpretation of qualifications and education because there are legal implications. There is no back door entry or experiential exemption from the formal academic requirements. This is simply because of the legal legislation on practice. This licensed based engineering governance legal framework does not exist in the UK.

MIET-Member of the Institution of Engineering and Technology is recognised as regulated engineering profession by virtue of the Statutory Instruments n.2007/2781-The European Communities (Recognition of Professional Qualifications) Regulation 2007-Directive European Union 2005/36/EC. http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/qualifications/regprof/index.cfm?fuseaction=profession.regProfs&amp;profId=6361&amp;mode=desc&amp;cId=0&amp;quid=3

This meaning retains the 19th century idea that "real" engineers were military personnel, while "other" engineers were civilians.

=== Spain ===
The situation in [[Spain]] is very similar to France but without the ''[[grandes écoles]]'' and Germany-UK in relation to the Technical Engineering Degrees. Long cycle Engineer's degrees (Ingenieros) traditionally used to be (at least nominally) six-year programs but the tendency since the mid-1990s has been to reduce them to five years. The last step to get the degree is the ''Proyecto de Fin de Carrera'' (Degree Project), which involves a combination of application development and some research work. Students submit a dissertation that they have to defend. The Spanish official name for the degree is ''Ingeniero'' (Engineer), or other degree called ''Ingeniero Técnico'' (Technical Engineer), which is a three to four years degree (involving also a Final Degree Project) and is equivalent to a Bachelor of Engineering, the Technical Engineer in Spain has full competencies and legal authority in their field. A distinctive characteristic of Spanish engineering degrees is that the average duration of studies up to graduation is about 40 percent above the nominal duration and that the drop-out rate is considerable due to stricter examination standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unifi.it/tree/dl/oc/a5.pdf "National systems of engineering education, QA and accreditation"], TREE – Teaching and Research in Engineering in Europe&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Portugal ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}
In Portugal, Engineer ({{lang-pt|engenheiro}}, feminine: ''engenheira'', abrev.: ''eng.'') is a professional degree reserved for the effective members of the [[Ordem dos Engenheiros|Portuguese Institution of the Engineers (OE, ''Ordem dos Engenheiros'')]] and [[Ordem dos Engenheiros Técnicos|Portuguese Institution of Technical Engineers (OET, ''Ordem dos Engenheiros Técnicos'')]]. There is not an academic degree of ''engenheiro'', despite the title being used informally to refer to anyone who has a degree in engineering, even a nonmember of the OE or OET.

Until the [[Bologna Process]], having a ''licenciado'' (five-year) degree in engineering was a previous condition to be able to be admitted to the OE. Presently, admission to the OE requires a post-Bologna ''licenciado'' (3 years) degree or a ''mestre'' (five-year) master in engineering. OE members holders of a post-Bologna ''licenciado'' degree are now classified as E1 grade engineers, while holders of a pre-Bologna ''licenciado'' or a ''mestre'' are classified as E2 grade engineers.

=== Italy ===
In [[Italy]] until 2001 there were two degrees: a three-year ''diploma in ingegneria'' (BEng level, title abbrev. "dipl. ing.") and a five-year ''laurea in ingegneria'' (MEng level, title abbrev. "ing."). Since 2001 reform, the bachelor's level is called ''laurea'' (abbrev. "L") and master's degree level is called ''laurea specialistica'' or ''laurea magistrale'' (abbrev. "LS"). Accordingly, today after three years of engineering studies, the degree called ''laurea in ingegneria'' (BEng level) and the title of ''dottore in Ingegneria'' (abbrev. "dott.") can be obtained. After two additional years of engineering studies, the degree called ''laurea magistrale in ingegneria'' (MEng level) and the title of ''dottore magistrale in Ingegneria'' (abbrev. "dott.") can be obtained. After a "state exam" you become "Ingegnere" (abbrev. Ing).&lt;ref&gt;In Italy the state accreditation system, degrees and titles are regulated by state law. See regulations (in Italian) [http://www.miur.it/atti/2000/dm0804l.htm DM 4 Agosto 2000] for "laurea" (bachelor) and [http://www.miur.it/atti/2000/dm001128.htm DM 28 Novembre 2000] for "laurea specialistica" (BEng(Hon)-master). Chartered professions (including engineering) are regulated by state law 328/01 [http://www.miur.it/regolame/2001/professioniregolam/AgrArch/DPR328_2001.htm ("D.P.R. 5 giugno 2001, n. 328")].
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greece ===
In Greece, the title of "Engineer" is awarded by two parallel and complementary parts of public higher education.

The title "Diplomate (Graduated) Engineer" is awarded after completion of the five-year engineering study course (300 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]], [[ISCED]] 7) at a University or a Technical University. The Diploma is equivalent to an Integrated master's degree. (Institutions have been issuing certificates of equivalence; officially recognized by the Greek legislation since August 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fme.aegean.gr/sites/default/files/docs/2017/fek114.pdf|title=Government's Gazette. Law 4485/2017 ΦΕΚ Α 114 / Article 46 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title of "Certified Engineer" is awarded after completion of the four-year course of engineering studies, equivalent to Honours bachelor's degree (240 ECTS, ISCED 6), at a Technological Educational Institute - T.E.I.

The newly founded University of Western Attica, in 2018, (after merging the former TEI of Athens and Piraeus) is the only University to award degrees, and not diplomas, equivalent to bachelor's degree (240 ECTS, ISCED 6).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uniwa.gr/en/feng/|title=Faculty of Engineering, UniWA |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Belgium ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}
In Belgium, there are three types of engineering degrees :
* "Burgerlijk Ingenieur" /"Ingénieur civil" or "Master of Science in Engineering" (abbrev. "ir.") - 5 years study (3 BSc. + 2 MSc.)
* "Bio-ingenieur"/ "Bioingénieur" or "Master of Science in Bioscience Engineering" (abbrev. "ir.") - 5 years study (3 BSc. + 2 MSc.)
* "Industrieel Ingenieur" or "Master of Science in Engineering Technology" (abbrev. "Ing.") - five years study in the Walloon region (3 BSc. + 2 MSc.) Four years of study in Flanders ( 3 BSc. + 1 MSc.).

Names are traditionally prefixed with the ir. and/ or Ing. titles, although this practice is not as widespread as in the Netherlands. Use of these titles are regulated and protected by law.
Belgium is particularly noteworthy as having a system under which demands made on students of engineering are particularly severe.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

=== The Netherlands ===
In the [[Netherlands]], somebody holding an engineer's degree is an ''ingenieur''. There are two types of engineers with different abbreviations:
* ''ir.'' is obtained by university graduates (''Wetenschappelijk onderwijs'' or WO). It is the highest engineer qualification. - five years study (3 B.Sc. + 2 M.Sc.)
* ''ing.'' is obtained by graduates from polytechnics (''hoger beroeps onderwijs'' or HBO). - four years study (4 B.Eng. or B.ASc.)

Names are traditionally prefixed with the ''ir.'' or ''ing.'' titles. Use of these titles are regulated and protected by Dutch law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0001854/DerdeBoek/TitelII/Artikel435/geldigheidsdatum_07-05-2013 "Artikel 435 lid 3 Wetboek van strafrecht"] (in Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Bologna agreement the titles are increasingly interchanged with the English-language degrees (B.Sc., BBE, M.Sc., etc.).

Completion of Dutch engineering qualifications have historically demanded a lot of effort. On average the five-year course takes seven years to finish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studenten.net/studieleven/nieuws/17783/uitwonende_studenten_doen_langer_over_studie "Opleidingen met een zogenoemd 'zwaar wiskundig profiel' als Bouwkunde, Econometrie en Elektrotechniek zorgen voor de meeste vertraging bij wo-studenten"] (in Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbs.nl/nl-NL/menu/themas/onderwijs/publicaties/artikelen/archief/2010/2010-3078-wm.htm "Vooral bij techniek, industrie en bouwkunde is de wo-studieduur veel langer"] (in Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Finland ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}
In [[Finnish language|Finnish]], the engineer's degree is called ''[[diplomi-insinööri]]'' and abbreviated ''dipl.ins.'', ''DI'' or ''M.Sc.(Tech.)''. It is possible to obtain after five years of studying, or even faster, but the average is around six years. Under the Bologna process, this is split into two parts, the first being one where the students can get the intermediate ''tekniikan kandidaatti'' (''B.Sc.(Tech.)'') degree.

The degree of ''[[insinööri (AMK)]]'' is a bachelor's degree from a Finnish University of Applied Sciences (''[[ammattikorkeakoulu]]''), similar to a German ''[[Fachhochschule]]'', but it is not interchangeable with the academic ''tekniikan kandidaatti''.

Due to the Bologna process, a new master's degree called ''insinööri (ylempi AMK)'' or "engineer (higher amk)" has been introduced. It carries a requirement of two years of work experience after the degree of ''insinööri (AMK)'' and further studies.

=== Poland, Czech Republic and Slovakia ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}
In the western Slavic-speaking countries, the engineer's degree is called ''inżynier'' ([[Polish language|Polish]]), ''inžinier'' ([[Slovak language|Slovak]]) or ''inženýr'' ([[Czech language|Czech]]), and the abbreviation is ''inż.'' in [[Poland]], and ''Ing.'' in the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]], which may be written before the person's name.

In the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]], the degree of ''Ing.'' is given for complete university studies in technical (like engineering), economic or agricultural fields. In one of these cases it can be equivalent to a ''[[Master of Science in Engineering]]''.

In [[Poland]], the degree of ''inżynier'' is available after 3.5 or 4 years of studies (like the ''[[licencjat]]'' in non-engineering science) after a final thesis is completed. A ''magister inżynier'' (abbreviated ''mgr inż.'') refers to a ''[[Master of Science in Engineering]]'', after completing five years of study and a written thesis. Originally there were "inżynier" studies that lasted for four years, and afterward one could obtain the "magister" title in two years of studies—the total of six years resulted in two degrees, "magister" and "inżynier". In the early 1960s a new track of studies was developed to speed up education and the "magister inżynier" five-year track was created. Whichever way one obtained the education the "magister inżynier" (mgr inż. before the name) was the equivalent degree with "inżynier" designating the professional level and "magister" designating the academic level.
After the [[Bologna process]] the first level is "inżynier," obtainable after nominally three years of studies (although some are longer) with the same professional privileges as before, and "masters" after one or two years gives the same academic and professional designation as before. But the ultimate shortening of the period of studies resulted in some professional groups (e.g. architects) demanding that "magister inżynier" be made a basis for professional rights.

=== Belarus and Ukraine ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}
In [[Belarus]] and [[Ukraine]], the degree is ''спеціаліст інженер'' (specialist inzhener), a first degree after five years of study.

=== Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Ex-Yugoslavia ===
In [[Croatia]], the old system included the engineer's degrees ''diplomirani inženjer'' (abbr. ''dipl.ing.'') which was awarded by university faculties, and a lower ranked engineer's degree ''inženjer'' (abbr. ''ing.'') which was awarded by polytechnics, in a similar vein to the situation in the [[Netherlands]]. The old ''dipl.ing.'' degree could later be upgraded to a ''magistar'' (abbr. ''mr.'', [[Magister (degree)|Magister degree]]) and then a ''doktor'' (abbr. ''dr.'', [[Doctorate]]). The situation was the same in other countries previously part of [[Yugoslavia]]. In [[Serbian language|Serbian]], the abbreviation is ''dipl.inž''.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Klajn, Rečnik jezičkih nedoumica (NOLIT, Beograd)&lt;/ref&gt; Serbian titles of ''magistar'' (abbr. ''mr'', [[Magister (degree)|Magister degree]]) and ''doktor'' (abbr. ''dr'', [[Doctorate]]) in abbreviated versions are used without full stop as a punctuation mark at the end.

=== Romania ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}
[[Romania]] followed the French system. One needs a baccalaureate diploma to be accepted at the university. The engineering degree was called ''Diploma de inginer'', and the graduate was called a ''Inginer diplomat''. These five years of study are equivalent to a Bologna Master(M.Sc/M.Eng/MCA). The five-year course concludes with a comprehensive set of specialising exams (''examen de diploma''). Marks nine and 10 are considered exceptional. Some universities had called ''Diploma de Sub-inginer'' which was a three-year course equivalent with a college degree. Following the [[Bologna process]], the graduates obtain the ''Inginer licentiat'' degree, after following a four-year program. In this case the ''Inginer Master'' degree is obtained after an additional one- or two-year graduate program.

== Europe (according to the Bologna Process) ==
{{main|Bologna process}}

Following the introduction of the [[Bologna process]], universities divide higher-education studies in three cycles, corresponding to a three to four-year [[bachelor's degree]], a one to two-year [[master's degree]], and a [[doctoral degree]]. Accordingly, engineering studies are now divided in two parts: first, the [[bachelor's degree]] (''baccalaureus'', three to four years), and the second optional part (one to two years), after which either the traditional engineer's degree or a [[master's degree]] (e.g. MEng or MSc) is awarded. These can often, however, still be combined into a single 'integrated' degree programme in many countries, normally lasting five or six years (although only four years in England, Wales and Northern Ireland).  But in the UK when one considers the whole formation of a fully qualified Chartered Engineer or Incorporated Engineer it is a minimum of eight years. Countries have varied in the implementation of the Bologna process, meaning the combination of first (bachelor's) and second (master's) cycles, even when taken as a single degree, can last from four to six years, although many countries have set five years as the minimum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|author=European Commission/EACEA/Eurydice|date= 2015|title=The European Higher Education Area in 2015: Bologna Process Implementation Report|publisher= Luxembourg: Publications Office of the European Union|url=https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/mwikis/eurydice/index.php/Publications:The_European_Higher_Education_Area_in_2015:_Bologna_Process_Implementation_Report|pages=54–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most traditional universities continue to have a primary academic degree program, for example, a five-year ''Civilingenjör'' in Sweden, that is distinct from the 3+2 scheme that awards the bachelor's and master's degrees but a student who has done both at a Swedish technical university will in most cases also fulfill the requirements for the ''civilingenjör'' degree.

In France, engineering is taught in ''écoles d’ingénieurs'', which are part of the French ''[[grandes écoles]]'' system. Since the [[Bologna Process]], the ''Diplôme d’Ingénieur'' is officially considered to be at the level of a European master's degree.

== Russia ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}
As of 2012 in [[Russia]], following degrees correspond to the "engineer's degree" in the sense of this article:
* '''Инженер''' - "engineer", which was formerly awarded after four, five, six years of study, may also contain clarification on the nature of engineering field, such as "mining engineer" or "systems engineer".
* '''Инженер по специальности''' - "engineer at specialty" (where specialty's name is mentioned), currently awarded after five or six years of study, may also contain clarification on the nature of engineering field, such as "engineer-ecologist at specialty Rational usage of natural resources and protection of the environment"
* '''Инженер-исследователь по специальности''' - "engineer-researcher at specialty" (where specialty's name is mentioned), was formerly awarded after seven years of study
* '''Бакалавр по направлению''' - "bachelor at area" (where area's name is mentioned), currently awarded after four years of study, and "area" is an engineering area, corresponding to one or more of former "specialties"
* '''Магистр по направлению''' - "magister (master) at area" (where area's name is mentioned), currently awarded after two years of study to those already having any higher-education degree, and "area" is an engineering area, corresponding to one or more of former "specialties"
Anything but "bachelor" is considered "second-level" higher education and gives access to postgraduate education for "candidate of sciences" degree, "bachelor" is considered "first-level" higher education degree and gives access to study for master's (magister) degree.

Post-graduate scientific degrees in engineering areas include '''кандидат технических наук''' - "candidate of technical sciences" and '''доктор технических наук''' - "doctor of technical sciences". Sometimes in English translations "...of technical sciences" is exchanged for "...of engineering".

== Pakistan ==
In Pakistan, engineering qualifications include the following:

* '''BE (Bachelor of Engineering)''' or '''BS/BSc Engineering (Bachelor of Science in Engineering)''' - four years' duration.

* '''ME (Master of Engineering)''' or '''MS/MSc Engineering (Master of Science in Engineering)''' - 1.5 to 2 years' duration.

* '''PhD (Engineering)''' - minimum three years' duration.

[[Pakistan Engineering Council]] (PEC) is the responsible government body for accreditation of undergraduate engineering degrees, registration of engineers and regulation of engineering profession. PEC is a full signatory of [[Washington Accord]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ieagreements.org/accords/washington/signatories/&lt;/ref&gt; and International Professional Engineer (IntPE) Agreement (IPEA).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ieagreements.org/agreements/ipea/members/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Turkey ==
In [[Turkey]] typical length of study for bachelor's degree at any engineering program is four years. Owner of a valid degree which is given by an engineering faculty at Turkish universities, can be called ''Mühendis'', meaning "Engineers". The ''"Mühendis"'' title is limited by law to people with a valid engineering degree, and the use of the title by others (even persons with much more work experience) is illegal. (Law No: 3458 ''Law about Engineers and Architects 28.06.1938'' Publish no:3945) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmmob.org.tr/hukuk/yasal-cerceve/3458-sayili-muhendislik-ve-mimarlik-hakkinda-kanun|title=3458 Sayılı Mühendislik ve Mimarlık Hakkında Kanun|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person may earn a master's degree in the same field as the bachelor's and be called as ''"Yüksek Mühendis"'' (meaning Higher Engineer).

== Bangladesh ==
In [[Bangladesh]], the engineering degree is referred to as B.Sc. Engineering (Bachelor of Science in Engineering) at the undergraduate level. Likewise, a master's degree is referred to as Master of Engineering (M.Eng) and Master of Science in Engineering (M.Sc.Engg). At the undergraduate level, the course takes four years whereas a master's degree usually takes 1.5 years. Graduated engineers who are members of [[Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh]] are legally and formally allowed to use 'Engr.' before their names.

== India ==
The engineering courses in India are regulated and set up under the aegis of the [[University Grants Commission of India]] (UGC), [[All India Council for Technical Education]] (AICTE) and National Board of Accreditation (NBA).

In India, engineering qualifications include the following:
* '''Bachelor's degrees''' (four years after class 12 and three years after [[Diploma in Engineering]]): BE ([[Bachelor of Engineering]]) and BTech ([[Bachelor of Technology]]). Both are same. Admission is usually through an engineering entrance examination.

* '''Master's degrees''' (two or more years after BE and BTech): ME ([[Master of Engineering]]), MTech ([[Master of Technology]]) and MSc (Eng) ([[Master of Science in Engineering]]). Admission usually requires qualification in the [[Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering]] or some work experience in an engineering field. The MTech and ME degrees are same and of two years' duration. MTech/ME usually has coursework in the first year and a project in the second year. The MSc (Eng) degree is usually research oriented and may requires two or more years to complete.

* '''Doctoral degrees''' (three to five years): PhD (Doctor of Philosophy). Admission requirements vary across universities but usually include a master's degree in engineering or a bachelor's degree in engineering with an exceptionally good academic record.

== Vietnam ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}
In [[Vietnam]], The degree is ''Bằng kỹ sư'' (specialist kỹ sư), a first degree after five years of study. The Ministry of Education of Vietnam has also issued separate regulation for the naming of degrees not in accordance with international regulation. The Engineer's degree is named "[[The Degree of Engineer]]" in the degree (e.g. ''The Degree of Engineer in Information Technology''). The degree of engineer is ranked at the same academic level as a bachelor's degree or master's degree, and is often known literally as an "engineer diploma" (abbreviated Dipl.-Ing. or DI).

=== Mathemagenic effects ===
In 1966 he coined the term [[mathemagenic]] for behaviors that lead to learning, one of the first theories of learning that focused on internal processes. His ideas were based on his observation that what students learned from instruction is a transformed version of the knowledge their instructor intended to impart, we he thought required more than just the stimulus-response model of [[behaviorism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=Dills |editor-first1=Charles |editor-last2=Romiszowski|editor-first2=Alexander |date=1997 |title=Instructional Development Paradigms |url= |location=[[Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey]] |publisher=Educational Technology Publications |page=258 |isbn=0-87778-294-6 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1785">'''Generative Linguistics in the Old World''' (known by its acronym '''GLOW''') is an international organization, founded in 1977 and based in the [[Netherlands]]. Its goal is to further the study of [[Generative grammar|Generative Grammar]] by organizing an annual Spring [[linguistics conference]] and periodical summer schools, and by publishing a newsletter that discusses current intellectual (and organizational) issues in the study of Generative Grammar.

It was founded in an attempt to provide an annual meeting for European researchers in Generative Grammar who felt themselves largely excluded from other organizations in the late 1970s.  Its founding document, the so-called ''GLOW Manifesto'' authored by [[Jan Koster]], [[Henk van Riemsdijk]] and [[Jean-Roger Vergnaud]], declared that "generative linguistics acquired a new momentum in Europe after [[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky]]'s [1973 paper] 'Conditions on transformations'" and sought to reflect that momentum with a new organization.  

By the beginning of the 21st century, GLOW had emerged as one of the leading organizations in linguistics internationally, as well as in Europe.  "Sister conferences" to the annual GLOW meeting in Europe have been organized under the rubric "GLOW Asia" in Japan, Korea and India, and the European GLOW conference itself has travelled as far south as [[Morocco]] (and as far north as [[Tromsø]]).  The 2015 Colloquium was held in [[Paris]], the 2016 meeting took place [[Göttingen]], in 2017 [[Leiden]] was the host, and in 2018 it is [[Budapest]]’s turn.

'''''Getting it Wrong from the Beginning: Our Progressivist Inheritance from Herbert Spencer, John Dewey, and Jean Piaget''''' is a 2002 book by [[Kieran Egan (educationist)|Kieran Egan]] criticizing the traditional [[Progressive education|progressivist]] foundations of modern education in the [[Western World]]. Egan primarily focuses on the work of [[Herbert Spencer]], [[John Dewey]], and [[Jean Piaget]] as the most influential sources of contemporary [[educational philosophy]].&lt;ref name=Turner&gt;Turner, D.(2006). Book Reviews. Educational Review, 58(4), 489-516.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Limond&gt;Limond, D. (2005). Getting it wrong from the beginning: our progressive inheritance from Herbert Spencer, John Dewey, and Jean Piaget. Educational Review, 57(1), 113-114.&lt;/ref&gt;  Egan identifies this book in its introduction as being a companion to his previous work ''[[The Educated Mind]]''.&lt;ref name=GIR&gt;Egan, K. (2002). Getting it wrong from the beginning. Binghamton, New Haven: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main Arguments ==
Kieran Egan states in his introduction: "I want to make the case here that most of the beliefs most of the people hold about education today are wrong in fairly fundamental ways."&lt;ref name=GIR /&gt; According to Egan, Herbert Spencer was one of the key figures in proliferating the progressive foundations of education.  These ideas were further championed by John Dewey and supported with research and writing by Jean Piaget.  Egan's assertion is that these foundations are fundamentally flawed.&lt;ref&gt;Aeschliman, M. (2003). Cults of Ignorance. National Review, 55(8), 48-50.&lt;/ref&gt;  The core tenets of progressivism he questions are: the idea that things (especially learning) always go from simple to complex, the notion that the matters of the mind can be treated like those of the biological body, and that all child-learning should occur as a child learns during play.  He also questions the call for [[utilitarianism]] in education and the value of [[educational research]].  In this book, Egan provides examples and [[logic]] based arguments which counter these ideas.&lt;ref name=GIR /&gt;

== Criticism ==
The book has been criticized for not providing adequate solutions to the problems it identifies in education.&lt;ref name=Turner /&gt;&lt;ref name=Limond /&gt; Readers looking to hear the author's proposed solutions would be advised to read his other work, most notably ''[[The Educated Mind|The Educated Mind: How Cognitive Tools Shape Our Understanding]]''.

There are 76 universities in Spain, most of which are supported by state funding. 24 Spanish universities are private, of which 7 are affiliated with the [[Catholic Church]].

Former degrees were:
*''Licenciatura'' or ''ingeniería'', can last four, five or six years.
*''Diplomatura'' or ''ingeniería técnica'', degree courses of shorter duration, 3 years.

Under the new [[European Higher Education Area]], these former undergraduate degrees are being replaced by the ''título de grado'' ([[Bachelor's degree]]) or the ''título de máster'' ([[Master's degree]]).

==History==
The origins of '''higher education in Spain''' date back to [[Al-Andalus]], the period of [[Islam]]ic rule. [[Madrasah]]s were established in the Andalusian cities of [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]], [[Seville]], [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], [[Granada]] ([[Madrasah of Granada]]), [[Murcia]], [[Almería]], [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] and [[Cádiz]] during the [[Caliphate of Córdoba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|contribution=education|title=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|year=2008|contribution-url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/179408/education|accessdate=2008-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Problems of definition make it difficult to date the origins of universities. The first [[medieval university|medieval European universities]] were simply groups of scholars, the word "[[university]]" being derived from the [[Latin]] ''universitas'', meaning ''[[corporation]]''.  Nonetheless, the University of [[Palencia]] appears to have been the first high education institution in Spain, while the [[University of Salamanca]] (Universidad de Salamanca) is the oldest existing Spanish university.  Founded in 1218, during a period of expansion that had begun in the 11th century, this University is considered to be one of the oldest in Western Europe.  The university was founded as a "General School of the kingdom" by King Alfonso IX of León in 1218 so that the Leonese people could study at home without having to leave for Castile.

The reign of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand, King of Aragon]], and [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella I, Queen of Castile]], saw a professionalisation of the apparatus of government in Spain, which led to a demand for men of letters (''letrados'') who were university graduates (''licenciados''), of Salamanca, Valladolid and [[Alcalá de Henares]].  These men staffed the various councils of state, including, eventually, the ''Consejo de Indias'' and ''Casa de Contratacion'', the two highest bodies in metropolitan Spain for the government of the [[Spanish Empire]] in the [[New World]].

Many of the medieval universities in Western Europe were born under the aegis of the [[Catholic Church]], usually as cathedral schools or by [[papal bull]] as [[Studium Generale|Studia Generali]].  In the early medieval period, most new universities were founded from pre-existing schools, usually when these schools were deemed to have become primarily sites of higher education.  Many historians state that universities and cathedral schools were a continuation of the interest in learning promoted by monasteries.

In Europe, young men proceeded to university when they had completed their study of the ''[[trivium (education)|trivium]]''&amp;ndash;the preparatory arts of [[grammar]], [[rhetoric]], and [[logic]]&amp;ndash;and the ''[[quadrivium]]'': [[arithmetic]], [[geometry]], music, and [[astronomy]]. (See [[degrees of Oxford University]] for the history of how the ''trivium'' and ''quadrivium'' developed in relation to degrees, especially in [[English-speaking world|anglophone]] universities).

Several of the world's [[List of oldest universities in continuous operation|oldest universities]] are located in Spain or were founded by Spanish scholars across the world at the time of the [[Spanish Empire]].

The [[University of Salamanca]], founded by King [[Alfonso IX]] of Leon in 1218 is the world's 8th oldest [[university]]. The oldest existing universities both in Asia ([[University of Santo Tomas]]) and the Americas ([[Universidad Autonoma de Santo Domingo|University of Santo Domingo]]) were founded by Spanish religious orders in the 16th century.

The creation of the Spanish Empire brought a significant expansion in royal positions for university-trained lawyer-bureaucrats who were not nobles and were dependent on and loyal to the crown. The multiple royal councils needed university-trained men, as did royal government in the Indies.  These were men who had studied Roman Law. "The law schools of universities were the training ground of the Crown's advisers."&lt;ref&gt;[[J.H. Parry|Parry, J.H.]] ''The Spanish Seaborne Empire''. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press 1990, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[medieval university|medieval European universities]] were simply groups of scholars, the word "[[university]]" being derived from the [[Latin]] ''universitas'', meaning ''[[corporation]]''. The [[University of Palencia]] appears to have been the first high education institution in Spain and the third in the world, after [[Bologna university|Bologna]] and [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], while the [[University of Salamanca]] is the oldest existing Spanish university.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150923213646/http://www.der.uva.es/historia.html Historia - Facultad de Derecho] Universidad de Valladolid&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1218, during a period of expansion that had begun in the 11th century, Salamanca is considered to be the third oldest in Western Europe. The university was founded as a "General School of the kingdom" by [[Alfonso IX of León|Alfonso IX]] in 1218 so that the Leonese people could study at home without having to leave for Castile.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|contribution=education|title=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|year=2008|contribution-url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/179408/education|accessdate=2008-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edificio neogótico y monumental.... Colegio el Pilar (Madrid).jpg|thumb|[[Colegio del Pilar (Madrid)|El Pilar]] is a school with a long list of [[old boys]] (former pupils), including one Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elconfidencial.com/espana/2012-02-19/el-pilar-un-colegio-de-dirigentes_232887/&lt;/ref&gt;]]

From the [[Instituto San Isidro|Imperial School]] to [[St. Bartholomew Major College|St. Bartholomew's College]] or [[Our Lady of Mount Zion College, Palma, Majorca|Our Lady of Mount Zion]], the Spanish set up a solid educational system as well as one of the first prominent fee-paying schools in Europe. [[Stonyhurst College]] in [[Lancashire]], was one of the many English boarding schools founded by Spanish Jesuits under the Empire, and was originally established in the [[Spanish Netherlands]] in 1593. The aim of these schools was to provide English boys with a Roman Catholic education during the rule of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Parsons, Catholic Encyclopaedia (1913)&lt;/ref&gt;

High-ranking army men and senior administrators of the empire usually pursued a rigorous education for their sons in Spain. The aim was to continue producing future leaders to serve the Spanish Empire and its interests, often resulting in a well-developed final product of colonial governors.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Hugh; El Imperio Español de Carlos V (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these schools were established by Catholic orders such as the [[Jesuits]], with the intention of emphasizing catholic values at heart, since the Catholic Church was arguably the greatest promoter of the Spanish Empire.

==Admission==
Admission to the Spanish university system is determined by the ''nota de corte'' (literally, "cutoff grade") that is achieved at the end of the two-year ''[[Education in Spain|Bachillerato]]'', an optional course that students can take from the age of 16 when the period of obligatory [[secondary education]] (''[[Education in Spain|Educación Secundaria Obligatoria]]'', or ESO) comes to an end.  A number between 1 and 10, the ''nota de corte'' is a combination of the grade achieved from the Bachillerato exams which the students take at school, and the average grade (''nota de media'') obtained from the university selection exam (commonly known as ''la Selectividad'' but officially named "Prueba de Acceso a la Universidad" or PAU) that the students will take at the local university.

The most popular courses at public universities demand the highest ''nota de corte'', while for private universities cost is normally the factor that determines which course a student will follow (that is, the most popular courses are inevitably the most expensive).{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

== Ranking ==
There are several rankings for Spanish Universities. The best known ones are the [[Shanghai Jiao Tong]], [[Quacquarelli Symonds|QS]] and THE Ranking. These are international rankings, however, there are also some national rankings comprising the "50 carreras" (50 degrees) from the "[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]" newspaper, the [[Spanish National Research Council|CSIC]] or the [[IAIF]] ranking of the [[Complutense University of Madrid|UCM]].

Spain's Higher Educations system has been [[Webometrics|ranked]] top-5th by the Spanish [[Spanish National Research Council|CSIC]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.webometrics.info/Distribution_by_Country.asp&lt;/ref&gt; only after the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom and Canada.

== National Rankings ==

=== IAIF Ranking - El País ===

It was published in 2009 and was said {{By whom|date=November 2014}} to be the best Spanish ranking ever. It was done by the Instituto de Análisis Industrial y Financiero (Industrial and Financial Analysis Institute) of the Universidad Complutense de Madrid and ranked the 69 Spanish universities:

=== Shanghai Ranking ===

The Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) is first published in June 2003 by the Center for World-Class Universities (CWCU), Graduate School of Education (formerly the Institute of Higher Education) of Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China, and updated on an annual basis. Despite its prestige, many people criticize them because they don't take into account the size of the universities for their rankings.

The '''History of [[Stonyhurst College]]''' as a school dates back to 1593 when its antecedent, the [[College of St Omer|Jesuit College at St Omer]], was founded in [[Flanders]] to educate English Catholics. The history of the present school buildings dates as far back as 1200 AD.

==Stonyhurst Hall==
{{see|Stonyhurst}}

The earliest Deed concerning the "Stanihurst" dates from 1200 AD and can now be found in the Arundell Library in the College, whilst the earliest evidence of a building on the site is from 1372 when John de Bayley was licensed to have an oratory there; the archway in the Bayley Room, within the 'Blind Tower', is believed to date from the fourteenth century, and may well be the only remnant of that earlier building.&lt;ref&gt;''A Stonyhurst Handbook for Visitors and Others'', third edition, 1963&lt;/ref&gt;  The oldest portion of the extant buildings however, the Shireburn Mansion (Stonyhurst Hall), was founded by the [[Roman Catholic]], Richard Shireburn, a descendant of the Bayley family, whose son attended the College at St Omers. He built the gatehouse and open cupolas (known as "the towers") on top of an older settlement dating from 1592. The design of the gatehouse incorporates four of the Classical orders (Doric, Ionic, Corinthian and Composite). Three similar designs appear on [[Merton College|Merton]] and [[Wadham College|Wadham]] Colleges  and the Schools building in Oxford, though Stonyhurst's predates them all by more than a decade.&lt;ref&gt;''A Stonyhurst Handbook for Visitors and Others'', 3rd edition, 1963, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; In places the exterior walls of this part of the building are as much as six feet deep.&lt;ref&gt;''A Stonyhurst Handbook for Visitors and Others'', third edition, 1963, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Civil Wars, [[Oliver Cromwell|Oliver Cromwell's]] army encamped near the Hall on their way to the [[Battle of Preston (1648)|Battle of Preston]] in 1648. Cromwell spent the night at Stonyhurst and slept on a table in the middle of the Great Hall in full armour. He is said to have preferred this option to a bed because of fear of assassination and mistrust of his Catholic, royalist hosts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stonyhurst.ac.uk/article_395.shtml Stonyhurst General News]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was quoted as saying it was "the best half house" he had seen (the Hall was at that time still unfinished).

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Shireburn's successor and grandson, Sir Nicholas Shireburn, began a massive building plan to extend the "half house", and completed the great hall, gardens and avenue so that it could be a great manor house. Two ponds, each measuring {{convert|660|ft|m}} by {{convert|112|ft|m}} were constructed in 1696, along with the "causeway" between, today known as the Avenue. His son Richard was poisoned in the gardens in 1702, and with no male heir Nicholas ceased building. Upon his death in 1717, the buildings passed to his wife and then to their sole heir, Mary, the Duchess of Norfolk. The Duchess was married to [[Thomas Howard, 8th Duke of Norfolk]], and lived in [[Arundel Castle]] in Sussex. Unoccupied, the buildings began to fall into disrepair. Eventually, the houses were inherited by her cousin, [[Lulworth Castle|Thomas Weld]] in 1754. Already living in Lulworth Castle, and not needing an extra house, Thomas, an old boy of St Omers, donated it to the [[Society of Jesus]], with {{convert|30|acre|m2}} of land, in 1794.

The original hall has been altered and extended over the years to become one of the largest inhabited buildings in Europe and achieving [[Grade I listed]] status from [[English Heritage]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stonyhurst.ac.uk/article_31.shtml The College] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010115747/http://www.stonyhurst.ac.uk/article_31.shtml |date=2010-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The village of [[Hurst Green, Lancashire]] developed with the hall. Richard Shireburn built the village school in 1686. He also built an almshouse upon Longridge Fell, the predecessor of the Shireburn Almshouse, which his son Nicholas built c.1707. The latter was dismantled in 1946 and re-erected in the village.

==The College==
===1593-1794===
{{main|College of St Omer}}

The story of the school starts at [[Saint-Omer|St Omer]] in what was then the Spanish Low Countries in 1593, where a college was founded by Father [[Robert Parsons (Jesuit)|Robert Parsons]] for English boys, unable to receive a [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] education in [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] England. As such it was one of a number of expatriate English schools operating on the European mainland during the centuries when Catholicism was proscribed in England. 

In 1762, when the French ''[[Parlement]]'' turned against the Jesuits, the school, in what was then a part of France, was forced to move. During subsequent decades, when the Jesuit Order was suppressed in most countries, the college was one of the institutions through which it managed to maintain a continuous existence. 

After St Omer (still known in Stonyhurst parlance by its old English name of St. Omers), the college settled in [[Bruges]] where it continued until 1773 when it was again forced to move, reassembling at [[Liège (city)|Liège]], under the protection of its bishop. 

In 1794 yet another move was forced upon the school, and a new home was found at Stonyhurst Hall in [[Lancashire]], an ideal county for the school to settle in because it was still a Catholic stronghold&lt;ref&gt;T. E. Muir, ''Stonyhurst'', pp. 55-61, esp. p.56: Lancashire, the "very Catholic county"&lt;/ref&gt; and its rural, isolated character provided the hope that the school would be left alone by the authorities. Not taking any chances however, a number of hiding places were created throughout the building should the Jesuits face persecution again, and when [[Stonyhurst Saint Mary's Hall|Saint Mary's Hall]] was constructed in the following century, a secret escape tunnel, which still survives, was also built linking the seminary to an exit in the gardens.

The honour of being last student at Liege and the first at Stonyhurst was claimed by a George Lambert Clifford whose bust is today on display in the Do Room; it is recorded that he and fellow pupil from Liege, Charles Brooke were the first of the migrants to arrive at the Stonyhurst mansion and raced down the Avenue together, but whilst his antagonist was waiting to be let in, Clifford spotted an open window and darted in, to be remembered by posterity as Stonyhurst's first pupil.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitson, ''Stonyhurst College, Present and Past'', (Preston, 1888), pp. 32-33&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===1794–1980s===
When Clifford and his fellow pupils of [[Liège (city)|Liège]] first arrived at Stonyhurst Hall, the buildings were in an extremely bad state of disrepair, and a temporary structure was built next to the east wing to house the boys. This "temporary" building still exists, and is known as ''Shirk''. 

A number of other buildings were added in the early 19th century, including the new church of St Peter's, in the Gothic style of the chapel at [[King's College, Cambridge]]. 

By the 1880s new building works began on the school, including removal of the ''grand stairs'' in the quad and subsequently the west wing. The temporary structures of 'Shirk' and the new west wing served the school well, but by late 19th century it needed to expand again and work was started on the south front, including the building of the Boys Chapel and the Academy Room. The south front took a considerable amount of time to build, because much of the land was swamp, resulting in the need for deeper foundations, which also created extra space. The work began in 1876 to replace the Old Playground front of 1809; the total cost of the construction (minus architect's fees) was £123,205.5s.6d. (less than the cost of refurbishing the dormitories in the same building 130 years later).&lt;ref&gt;''A Stonyhurst Handbook for Visitors and Others'', 3rd  edition, p. 33, 1963&lt;/ref&gt;

Stonyhurst was notable for its scientific activities, including the meteorological records of the Observatory (built in 1838). The school also prided itself on producing gentlemen philosophers: ''philosophers'' was the term used for students pursuing a course of education above secondary level at a time when Catholics were forbidden from attending Oxford or Cambridge both by English law and also by a Papal prohibition. Gas lighting was another early technological innovation at the school during this period, and the school had its own power station. 

From the 1960s onwards, the Stonyhurst went through a number of changes, partly reflecting those in the Catholic Church after the [[Second Vatican Council]], but also attributable in part to the growing secular tone of British society. The number of Jesuit instructors fell steadily, reflecting the changed priorities of Catholic religious orders and the dwindling numbers of the English Jesuit province. These changes led to the closing of another Jesuit boys' public school, [[Beaumont College]], in 1966; Beaumont and Stonyhurst amalgamated. With the addition of these new pupils, Stonyhurst had to expand again and the New Wing was built beside the wing erected in the 1800s to house the Arundell Library.

The former preparatory school to [[Beaumont College]], [[St John's Beaumont]] continues to send a significant number of its leavers to Stonyhurst.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===1986–2006===
After Fr Michael Bossy's fifteen-year headmastership, in 1986 the college acquired its first lay headmaster, Giles Mercer. Mercer brought in a number of changes during his time, and developed particular areas of the school. By the end of the 1980s, the school opened a new indoor swimming pool, new squash courts, a new gym and various refurbished classrooms and playrooms. Scenes from the film ''[[Three Men and a Little Lady]]'' were shot at the College.

In 1993, the school celebrated 400 years since its foundation at [[Saint-Omer]], and in 1994 200 years since its foundation at Stonyhurst Hall. Mercer set up the Centenaries appeal to raise money for new building works, including the refurbishment of the science laboratories, the Bread rooms (now English department classrooms), the language classrooms, the Ambulacrum (sports hall) and numerous other areas. The appeal also went towards building the new Centenaries Theatre. As part of the celebrations a play written by Fr William Hewett SJ was performed at the new theatre outlining the history of Stonyhurst.

Adrian Aylward succeeded Mercer in 1996, and the school continued to flourish during his ten-year leadership. In 1997, Stonyhurst began its run-up to becoming fully co-educational, and introduced girls to the preparatory school, [[Stonyhurst Saint Mary's Hall|St Mary's Hall]]. A building project was undertaken, such that by the time of Aylward's departure as headmaster refurbishment had taken place in the following areas of the school: the Old Infirmary (converted from girls' to Jesuit community accommodation), Lower Grammar, Grammar and Higher Line Playrooms, all dormitories (cubicles replaced by rooms on two storeys), the plunge (converted into dormitories and changing rooms on two storeys), the Sodality Chapel (restored), the Top Refectory, the Do Room, the Long Room, the Bayley Room, the More Library, the Syntax Wing and the shooting range. Five I.T. suites were created, CCTV was installed at all entrances, some disguised as Victorian lamp-posts, the back of the building outside the music basement was tidied up, and new landscaping and redesign of the road layout accompanied the building of the all-weather sports pitch on Harry Meadow. Classrooms were re-decorated and renamed after Saints associated with the school. At the same time, academic standards improved, with Oxbridge entry standing at around 10% in 2003. On a point of principle, Aylward withdrew Stonyhurst from academic league tables, claiming that they were of little relevance and devalued the worth of the individual.{{cn|date=February 2013}} The Stonyhurst Access Appeal was set up in 2003 to widen access to the College to those from lower-income families and to generate funds for further redevelopment. Adrian Aylward also steered the school through a difficult investigation into claims of alleged child abuse said to have taken place in the 1970s.{{cn|date=February 2013}} In 2005, after ten years, Aylward announced his resignation from June 2006. Andrew Johnson succeeded Aylward in September 2006.

===2006–Present===
As headmaster, Andrew Johnson has presided over continued alterations to the building. A new spiritual centre (the Emmaus Centre) has opened adjoining the Do Room, the Sodality Chapel has been re-dedicated, and most recently the Campion Room has been converted into a new study centre. The school has returned to the league tables as Johnson works to improve the school's academic standing. New procedures have been put in place to support and prepare Oxbridge applicants, and a new mentoring system established. Extra-curricular activities have been increased, particularly with a view to community-based work, such as the "[[Pedro Arrupe|Arrupe]] Programme"{{clarify|date=January 2018}}. Johnson also inspired the renaming of Saint Mary's Hall to [[Stonyhurst Saint Mary's Hall]], and is encouraging the prep school's doubling in size. Johnson is keen to transform Stonyhurst's academic performance as well as its standing, focusing on the quality of teaching, and moving the school towards greater academic selection.

===Parishes===
During the 19th century, Stonyhurst was a leading Jesuit centre. In 1794, it was the only Jesuit college in the country. From Stonyhurst, the Jesuits would travel to the Catholics in the surrounding towns to say Mass. Over time, churches were built for the Catholics in those places. The Jesuit priests from Stonyhurst built St Mary's Church in [[Clayton-le-Moors]] in 1810, [[St Ignatius Church, Preston]] in 1833, [[St Stephen's Church, Skipton]] in 1836, [[Church of Saint Francis Xavier, Liverpool|St Francis Xavier Church, Liverpool]] in 1840, the [[Church of St. Walburge, Preston|St Walburge's Preston]] in 1854, both [[Our Lady Immaculate and St Joseph Church, Prescot]] and [[Sacred Heart Church, Blackpool]] in 1857, [[Holy Cross Church, St Helens]] in 1860, [[St Joseph and St Francis Xavier Church, Richmond]] in 1866, Sacred Heart Church in [[Accrington]] in 1869 and [[Church of St Mary, Lowe House]] in 1924.

===Clayton-le-Moors and Accrington===
From 1810 to 1873, the Jesuits served the Catholics in Clayton-le-Moors from St Mary's Church, until they handed over the administration of the church over to the [[Diocese of Salford]] who continue to serve the parish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lan-opc.org.uk/Clayton-le-Moors/stmary/ St Mary, Clayton le Moors] from ''Online Parish clerks of Lancashire'' retrieved 13 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Jesuits arrived in Accrington in 1852 to start a mission and dedicated the parish to [[Oswald of Northumbria]]. In 1869, a church was built on Blackburn Road and was dedicated to the [[Sacred Heart]] instead. On 5 August 1869 the church was opened by the first [[Bishop of Salford]], [[William Turner (bishop of Salford)|William Turner]]. In 1931, the parish needed expansion and Our Lady's Chapel was built in [[Huncoat]]. In 1958, the Jesuits handed over the administration of the church to the [[Diocese of Salford]]. In June 2003, the church was closed. Later that year, it was damaged in a fire and then demolished.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/LAN/Accrington/SacredHeartoriginallyStOswald.shtml St Oswald] from [[Genuki]] retrieved 13 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accringtonobserver.co.uk/news/local-news/anger-as-firebugs-hit-church-1265604 Anger as firebugs hit church] from ''[[Accrington Observer]]'', 8 September 2003, retrieved 18 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''interactive course''' typically describes material of an [[education]]al nature delivered in a format which allows the user to directly impact the materials' content, pace, and outcome. Interactive, as defined by the [[Merriam-Webster]] [[online dictionary]], is "involving the actions or input of a user".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/interactive|title=Definition of INTERACTIVE|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of such material would be a [[computer]]-based presentation requiring a user to select the correct answer to a given question before proceeding to the next topic.

These types of courses are almost always computer-based, and most likely to be delivered to the user through the [[Internet]]. Due to their convenient delivery, availability, and almost endless subject matter, interactive [[Course (education)|course]]s have become a major tool for those seeking to provide, as well as to obtain, [[Higher education|education]], training, or [[certification]] in a given area of study.

With growing accessibility and availability of computers and the Internet, many schools, [[university|universities]], businesses, and government agencies are turning to interactive courses to train and educate their [[student]]s and staff through [[Massive open online course|MOOC's]] and customized internal [[learning platform]]s by third-party providers.

== Biography==

James Wyckoff earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[economics]] from [[Denison University]] in 1974 and a [[Ph.D.]] in economics from the [[University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill]], in 1982. After his graduation, he became an assistant professor of economics at the [[University of Oklahoma, Norman]] (1982-86) before moving to the [[University at Albany, SUNY]] in 1986, where he worked as assistant professor of [[public administration]] before being promoted to associate professor and then to full professor. Intermittedly, Wyckoff also served as chair of Albany's Department of Public Administration and Policy (1996-98) and as Acting Dean of its Graduate School of Public Affairs (1998-2000). Since 2008, Wyckoff has been a professor at the [[University of Virginia]]'s [[Curry School of Education]] and [[Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy]], where he was honoured with the position of Curry Memorial Professor of Education in 2011. In 2010, he moreover became Director of EdPolicyWorks, also known as the Center on Education Policy and Workforce Competitiveness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://batten.virginia.edu/sites/default/files/person/cv/WyckoffCV2018.pdf Curriculum vitae of James Wyckoff from the website of the University of Virginia.

== Research==

James Wyckoff's research focuses on teacher labour markets, in particular on the preparation, recruitment, assessment and retention of teachers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://batten.virginia.edu/school/people/james-h-wyckoff Faculty profile of James H. Wyckoff on the website of the University of Virginia. Retrieved April 13th, 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt; within which he has frequently collaborated with [[Donald Boyd]], [[Susanna Loeb]] and [[Hamilton Lankford]]. However, in the 1990s, Wyckoff has also performed research on e.g. school choice, finding (with Lankford) parents to trade-off between the relative quality of school offerings, the tuition of religious schools, the characteristics of other students in public and religious schools, and their family's socioeconomic characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/027277579290040A Lankford, H., Wyckoff, J. (1992). Primary and secondary school choice among public and religious alternatives. ''Economics of Education Review'', 11(4), pp. 317-337.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysing the sorting of teachers by qualifications in [[New York (state)|New York]] with Lankford and Loeb, Wyckoff found that low-income, low-achieving and non-white students, especially in urban schools, are generally taught by the least skilled teachers, with salaries rarely leaning against and sometimes even contributing to this sorting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3102/01623737024001037 Lankford, H., Loeb, S., Wyckoff, J. (2002). Teacher Sorting and the Plight of Urban Schools: A Descriptive Analysis. ''Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis'', 24(1), pp. 37-62.]&lt;/ref&gt; In further research with Boyd, they find teacher labour markets' spatial scope to be very small as teachers display strong preferences for proximity, which in turn makes it more difficult for urban schools to recruit new, well-qualified teachers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pam.20072 Boyd, D. et al. (2005). The draw of home: How teachers' preferences for proximity disadvantage urban schools. ''Journal of Policy Analysis and Management'', 24(1), pp. 113-132.]&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, they attribute teacher sorting to a combination of more qualified teachers being more likely to leave schools with very low-performing students and schools with such students generally experiencing higher turnover than other schools,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/000282805774669628 Boyd, D. et al. (2005). Explaining the short careers of high-achieving teachers in schools with low-performing students. ''American Economic Review'', 95(2), pp. 166-171.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022487105285943 Boyd, D.J. et al. (2006). Complex by Design: Investigating Pathways Into Teaching in New York City Schools. ''Journal of Teacher Education'', 57(2), pp. 155-166.]&lt;/ref&gt; though high growth in student achievement can effectively act as a retention mechanism for effective teachers in low-achieving schools.&lt;ref&gt;[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pam.20545 Boyd, D. et al. (2011). The role of teacher quality in retention and hiring: Using applications to transfer to uncover preferences of teachers and schools. ''Journal of Policy Analysis and Management'', 30(1), pp. 88-110.]&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, effective teachers tend to leave low-achieving schools (but not high-achieving schools) within their second and third years at these schools, thereby likely contributing to the widening of the learning outcomes between students; by contrast, less effective teachers tend to leave both low- and high-performing schools within their first year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Donald |last=Boyd |first2=Pam |last2=Grossman |first3=Hamilton |last3=Lankford |first4=Susanna |last4=Loeb |first5=James |last5=Wyckoff |display-authors=1 |title=Who Leaves? Teacher Attrition and Student Achievement |work=NBER Working Paper No. 14022 |date=May 2008 |doi=10.3386/w14022 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly, they also find that the main driver behind teachers' turnover decisions in [[New York City]] is their (negative) perception of the school administration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/0002831210380788 Boyd, D. et al. (2011). The influence of school administrators on teacher retention decisions. ''American Educational Research Journal'', 48(2), pp. 303-333.]&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting teacher turnover evidently harms students' test scores in math and English language arts, especially in schools with many Black and low-performing students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/0002831212463813 Ronfeldt, M., Loeb, S., Wyckoff, J. (2013). How Teacher Turnover Harms Student Achievement. ''American Educational Research Journal'', 50(1), pp. 4-36.]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, narrowing the gap between the qualifications of teachers in high- and low-performing schools is possible; for example, the NYC Teaching Fellows and Teach for America initiatives were able to substantially reduce such a gap between New York City's low- and high-poverty schools over 2000-2005 by substituting uncertified teachers in high-pverty schools by academically qualified teachers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/pam.20377 Boyd, D. et al. (2008). The narrowing gap in New York City teacher qualifications and its implications for student achievement in high-poverty schools. ''Journal of Policy Analysis and Management'', 27(4), pp. 793-818.]&lt;/ref&gt; Further research by Wyckoff and his co-authors on teachers' preparation and recruitment has found that teachers with reduced pre-job coursework often provide smaller initial gains in both math and English language arts when compared to teachers who completed a university-based teacher education programme, though most differences disappear as the cohort matures&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/edfp.2006.1.2.176 Boyd, D. et al. (2006). How changes in entry requirements alter the teacher workforce and affect student achievement. ''Education Finance and Policy'', 1(2), pp. 176-216.]&lt;/ref&gt; and that teacher preparation programmes' vary in their impact on teachers' value added to student test score performance, with practice-based preparation being particularly effective for new teachers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/0162373709353129 Boyd, D.J. et al. (2009). Teacher Preparation and Student Achievement. ''Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis'', 31(4), pp. 416-440.]&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the past, Wyckoff has been cautious to call for specific policies regarding teacher certification and preparation, arguing that the verdict on their impact on teacher quality and student achievement was still out.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4150019?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Boyd, D. et al. (2007). The effect of certification and preparation on teacher quality. ''Future of Children'', , 17(1), pp. 45-68.]&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, teachers who have the highest value-added to student test performance have distinctly different instructional practice profiles, e.g. consistently scoring better on Explicit Strategy Instruction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/669901 Grossman, P. et al. (2013). Measure for measure: The relationship between measures of instructional practice in middle school English language arts and teachers' value-added scores. ''American Journal of Education'', 19(3), pp. 445-470.]&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, together with [[Thomas Dee]], Wyckoff has also evaluated IMPACT, the high-powered teacher-evaluation system introduced by [[Michelle Rhee]] in [[Washington D.C.]], and found that dismissal threats increased the voluntary attrition of low-performing teachers and improved the performance of remaining teachers, while financial incentives were effective in further improving the performance of high-performing teachers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/wly/jpamgt/v34y2015i2p267-297.html Dee, T.S., Wyckoff, J.

KCSE stands for the '''Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education''', which is taken at the completion of Secondary Education. 

The first KCSE exam was held in 1989 at the same time as the last [[Kenya Advanced Certificate of Education]] (KACE), which it replaced as the entrance requirement for Kenyan universities. 

The top student was Naeem Samnakay, who had also been the top student in the first [[KCPE]] exam four years previously.

Initially, KCSE was a minimum of ten subjects. KCSE has since been reviewed twice, and the minimum number of subjects is now seven. 

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Compulsory subjects 
! Group two 
! Group three 
! Group four
! Group five
|-
| [[English language|English]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]], Mathematics
| Biology, Physics, Chemistry and Biological Science (taken by blind candidates) 
| History and Government, Geography, Christian Religious Education, Islamic Religious Education and Hindu Religious Education
| Home Science,  Art and Design, Agriculture, Computer Studies, Aviation
| French, German, Arabic, Music, Business Studies 
|-
|}

For grading, candidates must take all the three compulsory subjects, at least two sciences, one humanities and at least one practical or technical subject (see table below).

The examination is taken over October and November, and the results are released in February the following year.

The KCSE examinations are taken under very strict supervision from invigilators to avoid cheating and run for a period of about one month. Cheating in these examinations attracts severe penalties from the [[Kenya National Examination Council]], and students caught cheating get their grades cancelled. 

The exams usually start on October 22 and end in late November. From December, the exam is graded and the results are released in late December the same year.  

Examination results are announced to the public by the Minister for Education, and the top hundred students and schools are released to the media the day of the results announcement. School rankings are divided into the top 100 private schools, public schools and provincial schools. 

The grading of the examination is as thus:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Grade || Percentage mark
|-
| A || 80-100
|-
| A- || 75-79
|-
| B+ || 70-74
|-
| B  || 65-69
|-
| B- || 60-64
|-
| C+ || 55-59
|-
| C  || 50-54
|-
| C- || 45-49
|-
| D+ || 40-44
|-
| D  || 35-39
|-
| D- || 30-34
|-
| E  || 0-29
|}

In Kenya, this examination is the entrance to public and private universities and the pass mark is grade C+. Students who attain a lower mark than C+ join other tertiary institutions for non-degree courses. Over time, stringent measures have been taken by the government to ensure and sustain the credibility of the KCSE examination. However, there have been instances of breaches of these measures leading to examination vices such as leakage to some selected students who if undetected end up scoring high grades. In detected cases, such students have been punished by having their results cancelled and examination officials who participated in the cheating charged in a court of law.

Each year, hundreds of thousands of students take the examination after four years of the Secondary School Course and this examination is a major determinant of the individual's future career. A good grade guarantees one a place in one of the public or private universities in the country.

'''Kim Mu-che''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 11th century) was a scholar and educator under the [[Goryeo Dynasty]], and founder of one of the [[Twelve Assemblies of Goryeo]].  He passed the [[gwageo|literary examination]] in 1035, and rose to a position of rank.  Under the reign of [[Munjong of Goryeo|Munjong]], Kim opened a private academy called Seowondo (西園徒, or "Western Garden Assembly"), which became one of the leading educational institutions of the kingdom.  This and the other Twelve Assemblies came to be preferred over the national academy (the [[Gukjagam]]).&lt;ref&gt;Lee (1984), p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Loanwords from Japan ===

Many loanwords entered into Korean from [[Japan]], especially during the [[Japanese forced occupation]], when the teaching and speaking of Korean was prohibited.&lt;ref name="Hopfner"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=EhXrBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT35|title=Moon Living Abroad in South Korea|last=Hopfner|first=Jonathan|publisher=[[Moon Publications]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-59880-250-4|location=Berkeley, CA|pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those Konglish words are loanwords from, and thus similar to, [[Wasei-eigo]] used in Japan.

A simple example would be how the meaning of the English word "cunning" changes when used in a Konglish sentence. In South Korea, ''keonning'' means cheating, as the loanword was adapted from [[Japanglish]] ''kanningu'' ({{lang|ja|カンニング}}), which means "cheating".&lt;ref name="Smith2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ja.scribd.com/document/12826618/Korea-Herald-20080116|title=Time to clean up cunning Konglish|last=Smith|first=Sean|date=January 16, 2008|publisher=The Korea  Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; Konglish words may or may not have a similar meaning to the original word when used, and a well-known [[brand name]] can become a generalized trademark and replace the general word: older Korean people tend to use the word ''babari'' ("[[Burberry]]") or ''babari-koteu'' ("Burberry coat"), which came from Japanese ''bābari-kōto'' (meaning "gabardine raincoat") to refer to all [[trench coat]]s.&lt;ref name="Smith2008" /&gt; Coates made by Burberry are called ''beobeori-koteu'' ({{lang|ko|버버리 코트}}), rather than ''babari-koteu'' in Korean (as the brand name, entered to Korean language directly from English, is ''Beobeori'').

=== Pseudo-Konglish loanwords ===
Some foreign-origin words such as ''areubaiteu'' ({{lang|ko|아르바이트}}, {{IPA-ko|a.ɾɯ.ba.i.tʰɯ|}}, "[[part-time]]"), a loanword from [[German language|German]] ''{{lang|de|Arbeit}}'' ({{IPA-de|ˈar.baɪ̯t|}}, "work"), are sometimes mistakenly considered as Konglish and are corrected into "accurate" English loanword forms such as ''pateutaim'' ({{lang|ko|파트타임}}, {{IPA-ko|pʰa.tʰɯ.tʰa.im|}}).

=== Apartment names ===
A  trend in  the naming of apartment buildings in [[Seoul]] is  blending English words together because developers believe this will enhance the luxury  brand image of the properties.&lt;ref name="Suk2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20150722001132|title='Konglish' floods into apartment brand names|date=July 22, 2015|publisher=The Korea Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of apartment names with blended English words include: Luxtige, Blesstige, Tristige and Forestige, XI; these words are  combinations of luxury, bless, prestige, trinity, forest, extra and intelligence.&lt;ref name="Suk2015" /&gt;

== Criticism ==
Misuse or corruption of the English language by Koreans learning [[English as a foreign language]] have also been referred to as Konglish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2076122|title=Konglish inquiry traces evidence back to poor textbooks|author=Jeremy Garlick|date=24 December 2003|publisher=JoongAng Daily|accessdate=2 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/special/special_list.asp?categoryCode=221|title=Konglish Special News Section|publisher=Korea Times|accessdate=2 August 2009}} This section has photos and short descriptions which highlight Konglish use around Korea.

[[North Korean defectors]] can have trouble integrating into South Korean society because much of the Konglish used there is not used in North Korea. This can lead to confusion, misunderstandings and delay in integration into the society. This is not the sole cause of the linguistic divide between the two nations as some Korean words are also used differently between the two countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2882555|title=A wordy problem faces the Koreas|author=Lee Eun-joo|date=10 November 2007|publisher=JoongAng Daily|accessdate=2 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Konglish problems exist between the North and South they also exist between the metropolitan and rural.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=1998509|title=[VIEWPOINT]Divided by a common language|author=Rick Ruffin|date=23 June 2003|publisher=JoongAng Daily|accessdate=2 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahn Jung-hyo, a Korean-English translator who is the author of "A False English Dictionary," was noted for saying that improper use of Konglish in other countries is likely to bring shame to Korea.&lt;ref name="fighting"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=1904723|title=English?

He felt that it was both inventive and clever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2009/04/117_42610.html|title=Secret Pact With Lower Class|author=John Huer|date=5 April 2009|publisher=Korea Times|accessdate=2 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that article Huer criticized Koreans for their bad English and improper use of loanwords, though.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/opinon/2009/07/202_49030.html|title=Is English in Korea Only for Koreans?|author=John Huer|date=24 July 2009|publisher=Korea Times|accessdate=2 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Konglish usage could even be viewed as art, yet there is a difference between a cultural use of a word like "Fighting!" and the bad grammar and vocabulary seen on signs, packages, and TV around Korea. Sebastian Harrisan has suggested that calling these kinds of things Konglish masks the problem with English education in Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/special/2009/07/177_2918.html|title=The State of the Art|author=Sebastian Harrisan|date=15 May 2007|publisher=Korea Times|accessdate=2 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Korean government has been criticized by civic groups for their use of Konglish in slogans and focusing too much on English education. They feel that the heavy focus on English will damage the Korean language and doesn't benefit international competitiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2008/01/117_18210.html|title=Groups Call for Scrapping of `English-Worshipping'|author=Kim Rahn|date=30 January 2008|publisher=Korea Times|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117091424/http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2008/01/117_18210.html|archivedate=January 17, 2010|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[Jasper Kim]], a law professor at [[Ewha Womans University]], wrote that Konglish is necessary in a global context and that strict adherence to grammatical rules shouldn't trump getting the message across.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreaherald.co.kr/service/print.asp?tpl=print&amp;sname=Special&amp;img=/img/pic/ico_spe_pic.gif&amp;id=200608240028|title=[New Perspective]Konglish as a second language?|author=Jasper Kim|date=24 August 2008|publisher=Korea Herald|accessdate=2 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spread of Konglish in the Korean language has been cited as a reason to increase Koreans' exposure to native English speakers, especially during their educational time. Koreans instructing others can lead to cementing errors into the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/include/print.asp?newsIdx=35124|title=Future of English Language Teaching|author=Tory S. Thorkelson|date=26 November 2008|publisher=Korea Times|accessdate=2 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poor planning in the education system can result in unqualified Korean teachers being chosen to teach English with little or no time to prepare. These teachers end up using Konglish in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreaherald.co.kr/service/print.asp?tpl=print&amp;sname=Special&amp;img=/img/pic/ico_spe_pic.gif&amp;id=200609270062|title=Korea`s `English` classrooms: Held hostage by Konglish?|author=Cho Ji-hyun|date=27 September 2006|publisher=Korea Herald|accessdate=2 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even teachers who prepare may end up using official materials that contain numerous errors and Konglish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreaherald.co.kr/service/print.asp?tpl=print&amp;sname=Special&amp;img=/img/pic/ico_spe_pic.gif&amp;id=200405190009|title=[A READER'S VIEW]High stakes in English tests|author=Andrew Finch|date=19 May 2004|publisher=Korea Herald|accessdate=2 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can create a feeling of passiveness towards learning structurally and technically correct English.

'''Lancero''' (''English: [[Lancer]]'') is a military course and a denomination within the [[Colombian Army]]. The course takes place at the School of Lanceros of Colombia in [[Tolemaida]], [[Department of Tolima]] in [[Colombia]].
[[File:Torre de Salto Tolemaida.jpg|thumb|300px]]

== Overview ==
The Colombian Army has been in a [[Colombian armed conflict|military conflict]] with rebel [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]] since the 1960s.  This has led the Colombian Government and its military forces to develop courses specifically aimed to the training of both soldiers and officers for this kind of [[warfare]].  The term Lancero was chosen as a way to honor a specific unit of fighters (Lanceros) that helped the army of [[Simón Bolívar]] in his conflict for the independence of Colombia.  This unit showed special bravery and strength during the [[Vargas Swamp Battle]].

==History of the Course==
The course was created as a result of the reform that took place inside the National Army of Colombia organization during the early 60s as a way to specialize and refocus the national army towards an [[Irregular military|irregular conflict]] with armed peasants in the mountains of Colombia. Inexperienced and with little knowledge of guerrilla warfare the Colombian Army sent its own officers to [[Fort Benning]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], United States so they could take the Ranger Course that takes place there and as a way to apply their acquired knowledge in Colombia's specific situation.

The techniques learned in the American course were modified and taught to [[Sergeant]]s, [[Lieutenant]]s, [[Ensign (rank)|Ensigns]], [[Corporal]]s and some enlisted and ranking officers of the Naval Infantry. This techniques were later spread across all the Colombian military components.

In 1959 the army created companies of Lanceros. These newly created companies were more agile and flexible thus, leading to more successful operations. They were added as supportive personnel for units where the enemy was even more aggressive and active.

In 1966 an outbreak of dispersed bandits called for the creation of even sharper and faster units. This year the Colombian Army's military command put into effect a more extensive training program to combat the rebels; this program would later become a single course called "''Contraguerrillas''"

Since this time the Lancero course has focused on the training of Soldiers, Army Officers and even Police Officers for the needs of a country with an [[Asymmetric warfare|enemy that hides among the civilian population]]. After more than forty years the course has gained some notoriety among military personnel around the [[Earth|globe]] largely due to its focusing on guerrilla warfare and not on regular military warfare.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejercito.mil.co/index.php?idcategoria=92 Escuela de Lanceros - Ejército Nacional de Colombia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Lancero and Lanza concept==
The term Lancero which can be translated as [[lancer]] has  subsequently led to the use of the term Lanza ([[Lance]]) as a way to refer to a fellow soldier. In fact the course has emphasized on the importance of cooperative work between two soldiers as a way to accomplish goals (one being the Lanza or spear and the other one being the lancero or lance carrier). Thus, the terms Lanza and Lancero are both colloquial and honoring ways to call a fellow soldier or an officer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.militaryphotos.net/forums/showthread.php?t=128137 French Foreign Legion in Colombian Lancero course - Military Photos&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''National archives''' are central [[archive|archives]] maintained by [[countries]]. This article contains a '''list of [[national archives]]'''.

Among its more important tasks are to ensure the accessibility and preservation of the information produced by governments, both analogically and digitally, for the government itself, researchers and generations to come.

Some national archives collections are large, holding millions of items spanning several centuries, while others created recently have modest collections. In the last decade, digitization projects have made possible to browse records and contents online, although no archive have their entire collections published on the web.

'''Louise Ernestine Howard''' (''née'' '''Matthaei'''; 26 December 1880 – 11 March 1969) was a classics scholar, international civil servant and supporter of [[organic farming]].

== Early life and career ==

Born at [[Kensington]], she was the fourth daughter and the youngest of five children of the commission merchant Carl Hermann Ernst Matthaei and the musician Louise Henriette Elizabeth Sueur. Her eldest sister was the botanist [[Gabrielle Howard]]. The family was of German, French and Swiss ancestry. Howard attended [[South Hampstead High School]] and [[Newnham College, Cambridge]]. After obtaining a number of scholarships and prizes, she graduated with [[first-class honours]] in both parts of the classical [[tripos]] and eventually obtained a research fellowship. Howard was seen as a strict but encouraging and sympathetic teacher, having been appointed lecturer and director of studies in classics at Newnham College in 1909.&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;{{citation|title=Howard, Louise Ernestine|last=Oldfield|first=Sybil|work=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/37576|accessdate=2 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the outbreak of the [[First World War]], the half-German Howard, a supporter of the [[Spartacus League]], attempted to procure an understanding of [[German Empire|Germany]] and fight against collective paranoia. She was dismissed by the [[University of Cambridge]] because her father was German.&lt;ref name=levenback&gt;{{citation|title=Virginia Woolf and the Great War|last=Levenback|first=Karen L.|publisher=Syracuse University Press|year=1999|isbn=0815605463}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1918, Howard became an assistant to [[Leonard Woolf]]. She is alleged to have been the historical model for Miss Kilman, the repulsive and over-educated woman in Virginia Woolfe's famous novel [[Mrs Dalloway]].

Two years later, in Geneva, she successfully completed examination and joined the agricultural section of the [[International Labour Organization]]. In 1924, she became its chief.&lt;ref name="odnb" /&gt;

== Marriage ==

In 1931, she married her brother-in-law [[Albert Howard]], a botanist and widower of her sister Gabrielle who had died the previous year. Albert Howard had no children by either of the sisters. By getting involved in her husband's campaign against the use of chemicals in agriculture, she continued her sister's support for his work, becoming known as Lady Howard when he received a knighthood in 1934. In the 1930s and 1940s, Lady Howard helped Germans fleeing from the Nazi regime. After her husband's death in 1947, she founded the  Albert Howard Foundation, which merged with the [[Soil Association]] in 1953. Lady Howard was honorary vice president of the latter until her death in [[Blackheath, London]], in 1969.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

== Publications ==

* ''The Lover of the Nations'', 1915.
* ''Studies in Greek Tragedy'', 1918.
* ''Labour in Agriculture, an International Survey'', 1935.

'''Mary D. (McGaha) Lowman''' (January 27, 1842 – June 12, 1912)&lt;ref name=century/&gt;&lt;ref name=kshs/&gt;&lt;ref name=dates/&gt; was a schoolteacher and the mayor of [[Oskaloosa, Kansas]], in the late 1880s. She was the first woman in Kansas to be elected mayor with a city council composed entirely of women.

==Biography==
Mary D. McGaha was born on a farm in [[Indiana County, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name=century/&gt; She became a schoolteacher and in 1866 married a man named George W. Lowman, with whom she had two children.&lt;ref name=century/&gt; They moved to Kansas and settle in the small town of Oskaloosa, where she became a teacher of recently [[Emancipation Proclamation|emancipated]] black students.&lt;ref name=century/&gt;

In 1885, she became the city's deputy [[county clerk]] and deputy [[recorder of deeds|register of deeds]].&lt;ref name=century/&gt;&lt;ref name=leslie1888/&gt; In 1888, the women of Oskaloosa, dissatisfied with poor city management, decided to run an entire slate of women for municipal office.&lt;ref name=century/&gt;&lt;ref name=leslie1888/&gt; (Although American women did not yet have a national [[Women's suffrage in the United States|right to vote]], Kansas women had been given the right to vote in some municipal elections one year earlier.)&lt;ref name=weatherford/&gt; The "Oskaloosa Improvement Ticket"&lt;ref name=murray/&gt; won by a two-to-one margin,&lt;ref name=leslie1888/&gt; making Lowman the first woman in Kansas to serve as mayor with a city council composed entirely of women.&lt;ref name=century/&gt; Newspapers across the country covered the unusual election of an all-women municipal administration.&lt;ref name=kshs/&gt; Lowman was elected only a year after [[Susanna M. Salter]] became the nation's first woman mayor.

When Lowman and her council took office, the city treasury was empty and the city in debt.&lt;ref name=century/&gt; Lowman and her 5-member council were re-elected after their first year in office, with two members of the council being replaced by other women.&lt;ref name=century/&gt;&lt;ref name=kshs/&gt; After two years in office, Lowman and her council left the city with a replenished treasury.&lt;ref name=century/&gt; 

Lowman died in 1912 of burns received when her clothing caught fire at a cookstove.&lt;ref name=kshs/&gt;

'''Music for People''' ('''MfP''') is a non-profit organization dedicated to music-making and music improvisation as a means of self-expression. Their primary activities include organizing workshops for improvisational music, hosting a four-year ''Musicianship and Leadership Program'' that provides training in music facilitation, and publishing various resources related to improvisational music.

Music for People was founded in 1986 by cellist [[David Darling (musician)|David Darling]] and flautist [[Bonnie Insull]]. The core of the teaching methods center on [[Humanistic education]].

Graduates of the ''Musicianship and Leadership Program'' facilitate a wide range of music events and programs such as [[drum circle]]s and [[flute circle]]s.

== Philosophy ==
The philosophy of Music for People is encapsulated in a Bill of Musical Rights that centers on the need for musical self-expression, authenticity, and acceptance of the full range of music traditions and the musical contributions of all people, regardless of their level of experience.&lt;ref name="MBR"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.MusicForPeople.org/rights.html |title=A Bill of Musical Rights |author=David Darling |date=1997 |work=Music for People |accessdate=2012-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The approach to music facilitation is generally unconventional, using a playful teaching style&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.windovertheearth.com/Mdarling.html |title=Wind over the Earth |author=Micky Houlihan |date=1997 |accessdate=2012-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed by David Darling beginning with his work leading workshops as part of the [[Paul Winter Consort]] beginning in 1980. The approach to tonal and rhythmic improvisation has been found to have positive social influences, both similar to and contrasting with clinical [[music therapy]] approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kalani Das |title=The Way of Music - Creating Sound Connections in Music Therapy |publisher=Sarsen Publishing |location=Denton, Texas |isbn=978-1-60725-278-8 |edition=First |year=2011 |url=http://kalanimusic.com/products/books/the-way-of-music/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the core techniques used is ensemble playing, where participants have varying levels of musical experience, come from different genres of music, and often include instruments that typically do not play together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lynn Miller |title=SpiritArts - Transformation through Creating Art, Music and Dance |publisher=Expressive Therapy Press |location=Phoenixville, Pennsylvania |isbn=978-0-615-84150-2 |edition=First |year=2013 |page=65 |url=http://spiritarts.us/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darling's dedication to Arts-in-Education innovation and creativity earned him the 1995 Artist of the Year Award from Young Audiences, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Houle |first1=Arthur |title=Five Minutes With ... David Darling |journal=The American Music Teacher |date=April 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Music for People has prompted many offshoots, such as the Improv Collective at Fredonia University&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fredonia.edu/music/improv/|title=The Improv Collective |author=David Rudge, Ph.D.|date=2011|accessdate=2012-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and the classical music program at DePauw University that incorporates music improvisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Making Up the Classics |author=Alexandra Alter |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122781195665062021 |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=November 28, 2008 |accessdate=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== A Musical Bill of Rights ==

This sums up the philosophy promoted by the organization:&lt;ref name="MBR" /&gt;

* Human beings need to '''express''' themselves daily in a way that invites physical and emotional release.
* Musical self-expression is a joyful and healthy means of communication available to absolutely everyone.
* There are as many '''different ways''' to make music as there are people. 
* The human '''voice''' is the most natural and powerful vehicle for musical self-expression. The differences in our voices add richness and depth to music.
* Sincerely expressed '''emotion''' is at the root of meaningful musical expression. 
* Your music is more '''authentically expressed''' when your body is involved in your musical expression.
* The European tradition of music is only '''one sound'''. All other cultures and traditions deserve equal attention. 
* Any combination of people and instruments can '''make music''' together. 
* There are '''no "unmusical" people''', only those with no musical experience. 
* Music improvisation is a '''unique''' and '''positive''' way to build skills for life-expression. 
* In improvisation as in life, we must be responsible for the '''vibrations''' we send one another.

== Resources ==
The techniques used in music education have been published in a handbook on musical forms and structures,&lt;ref&gt;Oshinsky, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
as well as a set of three CDs of interviews with [[David Darling (musician)|David Darling]] and Julie Weber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.DarlingConversations.com/ |title=The Darling Conversations |author=David Darling |author2=Julie Weber |date=2008 |accessdate=2012-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also supplementary information relating to the Musicianship and Leadership program relating to the development of activities in music workshops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.musicforpeople.org/pdf/TenQsJune07.pdf |title=Ten Questions that can be applied to any Music for People Return to Child activity|author=James Oshinsky |date=2007 |accessdate=2012-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Association of Head Teachers''' ('''NAHT''') is a [[trade union]] and professional association representing more than 28,500 members in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Members hold leadership positions in early years; primary; special and secondary schools; independent schools; sixth form and FE colleges; outdoor education centres; pupil referral units, social services establishments and other educational settings.

The union was founded in 1897 as the '''National Federation of Head Teachers' Associations'''.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Cook, ''The Routledge Guide to British Political Archives: Sources since 1945'', p.337&lt;/ref&gt;  Membership grew from just over 1,000 in 1898 to 10,000 in 1947, and 20,000 by the 1980s.  For many years, membership was restricted to headteachers, but deputy headteachers were admitted from 1985, and assistant headteachers from 2000.&lt;ref&gt;National Association of Head Teachers, "[http://www.naht.org.uk/welcome/about-naht/history/ History]"&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12712">The '''National Association of Schools of Art and Design''' ('''NASAD'''), founded in 1944, is an accrediting organization of colleges, schools and universities in the [[United States]]. The organization establishes standards for graduate and undergraduate degrees. Member institutions complete periodic peer review processes to become, and remain, accredited. NASAD accreditation should not be confused with [[regional accreditation]].

==Standards for accreditation==
The National Association for Schools of Art and Design has stringent criteria for accrediting schools. For example, the NASAD requires that schools clearly publish their tuition rates and course descriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASAD Handbook 2012-13|url=http://nasad.arts-accredit.org/site/docs/Handbook/NASAD_HANDBOOK_2012-13.pdf|accessdate=9 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130327164157/http://nasad.arts-accredit.org/site/docs/Handbook/NASAD_HANDBOOK_2012-13.pdf|archivedate=27 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, board members assess the schools' art curricula and promote new standards to advance art education.

==Institutional members==
As of January 16, 2016 the National Association of Schools of Art and Design has 367 accredited institutional members:&lt;ref&gt;[http://nasad.arts-accredit.org/index.jsp?page=Member%20Lists Member Lists&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''National Botanic Garden of Israel''' ('''The Botanical Garden for the Native Plants of Israel in memory of Montague Lamport''') [[Hebrew]]: הגן הבוטני לצמחי ארץ ישראל ע"ש מונטג'יו למפורט), not to be confused with [[Jerusalem Botanical Gardens]], which was originally planned as its successor, is a [[botanical garden]] located on the [[Mount Scopus]] campus of the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. It covers an area of 25 dunams and contains 950 varieties of plants, 40% of them wild.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Green-Israel/People-and-The-Environment/The-Revival-of-Mount-Scopus-Botanical-Garden The revival of Mount Scopus Botanical Garden, [[Jerusalem Post]]]&lt;/ref&gt; 
==Overview==
The first botanical garden in the [[Land of Israel]], it records all the wild plants of Israel and the Middle East. The garden is located in the northern part of the Hebrew University campus on [[Mount Scopus]] in [[Jerusalem]]. Around the garden are many burial caves from the [[Second Temple]] period. In the western part of the garden is a small amphitheater. The garden is also a [[Nature reserve|Ecological nature reserve]] and [[National parks and nature reserves of Israel|National park]]. It incorporates a  Natural Teaching Center, the largest botanical library in Israel and a meteorological station. On the western side of the garden is trail walk named after the Israeli author [[Avigdor Hameiri]]. In the center of the trail, next to the main entrance, is a stone tablet inscribed with his famous song poem "On the summit of Mount Scopus."

== History ==
[[File:Visit Tomb of Nicanor 2011 29.jpg|thumb|Cave of Nicanor]]
The garden was established in 1931 on the northern side of the Hebrew University on Mount Scopus by [[Otto Warburg (botanist)|Otto Warburg]], who founded the university's Department of Botany  together botanist [[Alexander Eig]]. It was the first botanical garden in the [[Land of Israel]]. The garden was a highlight of the scientific and educational work of botanist Alexander Eig who continued to teach at the university until his death. He planted the first tree in the garden. He established a program to protect the local flora.  He collected plants in  Syria, Turkey, Iraq and Lebanon, brought seedlings from 350 [[Cedrus]].
 
The garden was the first home of the [[Jerusalem Biblical Zoo]]. The  Mt. Scopus period lasted from 1947 to 1950. In 1948, when there was no food in Jerusalem, zookeepers had to hunt stray dogs near garbage dumps to feed the carnivorous animals, many of which perished. Non-dangerous species had to be released. In 1950, with UN help, the animals were moved down into the city by weekly convoys.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sbl-site.org/publications/article.aspx?articleId=579 The Jerusalem Biblical Zoo]&lt;/ref&gt;

The garden had been neglected over 19 years, when the Mount Scopus campus was in an enclave under Israeli control surrounded by Jordan. Indeed in 1954 a new botanical garden was opened in western Jerusalem, near the [[Jewish National and University Library]], on the new campus of the [[Hebrew University]] in Givat Ram. In 1958 two Israelis soldiers were killed in the garden by Jordanian ambush, also the "United States Chairman of the Commission" that came to mediate was killed in this incident.

In 1980, it was decided to renew the garden, which was inaugurated in 1988.

The garden is the first in the world to be recognized as an "ecological garden," designed for nature conservation. Many of the species are very rare or non-existent in the wild.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.haaretz.com/1.5074714 A garden variety, [[Haaretz]]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Burial caves ===
[[file:Pinsker-Oshiskin.jpg|thumb|Graves of Leon Pinsker and Menachem Ussishkin]]
The [[Cave of Nicanor]] is an ancient burial cave from the [[Second Temple]] period discovered in 1902. An inscription  marked it as the grave of "Nicanor" who built the doors on the [[First Temple]] in [[Jerusalem]]. In 1934, the remains of [[Leon Pinsker]] from [[Odessa]] were reburied in the Nicanor cave at the initiative of [[Menachem Ussishkin]], who envisaged a national pantheon on Mt. Scopus.  However, the only other person buried there was Ussishkin himself, who died in 1941. A national leaders plot was established on [[Mount Herzl]] after the founding of the state in 1948, in part because Mount Scopus became an enclave in [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|Jordanian-ruled territory]].

'''openSAP''' is an Enterprise MOOC platform for massive open online courses, or [[MOOC]]s. It is provided by [[SAP SE|SAP]] and hosted at the [[Hasso Plattner Institute]] in Potsdam, Germany. Everyone can enroll in openSAP courses, which are provided free of charge.

While the MOOC concept is already quite popular in academia, SAP is one of the first companies to build a platform dedicated to MOOCs and adopt it for business-related training purposes. Compared to traditional e-learning formats, openSAP courses return to tried and trusted classroom concepts and transfer them to an online medium in the following way:

* Courses have a defined duration (typically six weeks) to which students need to adhere
* Courses are based on lectures (delivery through video), supporting material (slide decks, handouts), and self-tests.
* Students need to submit homework on a weekly basis and adhere to deadlines. The homework is graded and contributes to the points required to receive a record of achievement.
* Students can discuss the course content in an online forum.
* Courses end with a final exam.
* Some courses include peer assessments where learners can submit their work for review by their peers and content experts. This helps the learner to develop their ideas with feedback - just like in a classroom setting.

The average duration of the video lectures is 90 minutes per week. Combined with additional self-study and homework, the average effort required to complete an openSAP course successfully is four to six hours per week. This makes it easy for students to combine courses with their other responsibilities.

==The first openSAP course==
The first openSAP course was held from May 27 through July 15, 2013.

* 18,033 learners were enrolled on day 1 of the course.
* When the final exam ended, this number had increased to 40,386.
* 15,748 learners actively participated in the course.
* 10,795 learners took the final exam.
* 9,383 graded records of achievement were distributed.

==Peer Assessment==
Peer assessment features as an element in many openSAP courses around design and development. In 2016, openSAP saw 2,100 learners submit prototypes, built on SAP Splash and Build, as part of one of its courses.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19003">'''Pay-for-Performance (Federal Government)''' is a method of employee motivation meant to improve performance in the [[United States]] [[federal government]] by offering incentives such as salary increases, bonuses, and benefits.  It is a similar concept to [[Merit pay|Merit Pay]] for public teachers and it follows basic models from [[Performance-related pay|Performance-related Pay]] in the private sector.  According to recent studies, however, there are key differences in how pay-for-performance models influence federal employees in public service roles.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, James, Annie Hondeghem, and Lois Recascino Wise. “Revisiting the Motivational Based of Public Service: Twenty Years of Research and an Agenda for the Future.” Public Administration Review, 2010: pg. 681-690&lt;/ref&gt; [[James L. Perry|James Perry]] is one scholar who has conducted such studies.  His research reveals that public servants tend to be more intrinsically motivated, and thus, are prone to have a negative reaction to monetary incentives.  There is still debate, however, on what exactly makes the public sector different.

==History==

Pay-for-performance programs first began in the private sector. As consultants, academic experts, and employee advocate groups analyzed merit pay systems' success in private businesses, they recommended expanding this method into the public sector.&lt;ref&gt;Milkovich and Alexandra K. Wigdor. Pay for Performance: Evaluating Performance Appraisal and Merit Pay. Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press, 1991: pg.13&lt;/ref&gt;   One vital omission in the process of implementation, however, is that the policy makers failed to consider that the stakeholders in the private sector differ from those in the public sector.

The first trial run of a pay-for-performance system came in the late 1970s.  In 1978 U.S. President Jimmy Carter introduced the broad outlines of the [[Civil Service Reform Act]] in his [http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/poldocs/uspressu/SUaddressJCarter.pdf State of the Union] message.  It was the first time a U.S. President had ever included civil service reform among his major legislative proposals.

The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 created the Office of Personnel Management, to oversee the human resource management of the federal government, and the Merit Systems Protection Board, to regulate the merit system and prevent any abuse. The major provisions in the act included, but were not limited to, performance appraisals for all employees, merit pay on a variety of levels (but focusing on managerial levels), and modifications for dealing with poor performers.&lt;ref&gt;Milkovich and Alexandra K. Wigdor. Pay for Performance: Evaluating Performance Appraisal and Merit Pay. Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press, 1991: pg. 20-22&lt;/ref&gt; This merit pay system was a break in the long tradition of automatic salary increases based on length of service. Under the new act, employees only got half of their traditional automatic salary increase. The remaining non-automatic portion was divided up according to performance rating. A key part of this system was that it was revenue neutral—this meant that when some employees benefited under the new system, others would of necessity be receive less than in the previous system.

The greatest benefits of the Act were that it clarified job expectations and defined goals and objectives. The clearest shortcoming was that it failed to establish a “demonstrable relationship between pay and performance.” &lt;ref&gt;Milkovich and Alexandra K. Wigdor. Pay for Performance: Evaluating Performance Appraisal and Merit Pay. Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press, 1991: pg.27&lt;/ref&gt; This failure had a number of causes—most notably a lack of adequate funding. Managers who performed satisfactorily often found themselves receiving less pay than their non-managerial counterparts because the non-managerial employees were still under the previous pay system. Some complained that this merit system seemed arbitrary and many employees did not perceive it as a fair assessment of performance and effort.  Furthermore, the public became upset when they saw certain senior executives in the government receiving large paychecks. It became apparent that the Act was not an effective means of civic service reform.
[[File:Ronald Reagan - NARA - 558523.jpg|thumb|President Ronald Reagan]]
When Ronald Reagan was elected in 1982, he significantly reduced the size and cost of many portions of government, thereby greatly limiting the Civil Service Reform Act. Satisfying the need for new legislation, the Performance Management and Recognition System (PMRS) was enacted on November 8, 1984. Most notably, the PMRS provided a greater level of evaluation accuracy and imposed minimum and maximum levels of pay increase to limit disparity among merit pay employees. PMRS also created Performance Standard Review Boards for each department and required that at least half of the board be members who were under the merit pay system. This requirement ensured that at least some board members had a vested interest in dealing with potential problems and concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Milkovich and Alexandra K. Wigdor. Pay for Performance: Evaluating Performance Appraisal and Merit Pay. Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press, 1991: pg. 28-28&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it was considered a significant improvement over its predecessor, PMRS only lasted from 1984 to 1991. The demise of PMRS was caused by poor discrimination among performance levels, inadequate performance findings, and little demonstrable evidence that the system improved performance.  Over 50 percent of the employees felt like the size of the rewards was inadequate, and more than 75 percent of the managers stated that their performance evaluations provided little guidance for development purposes, mentioning that “insufficient funds [had] resulted in meaningless performance awards.”&lt;ref&gt;Milkovich and Alexandra K. Wigdor. Pay for Performance: Evaluating Performance Appraisal and Merit Pay. Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press, 1991: pg. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the PMRS was abandoned, various proposals have surfaced and even a few agencies have tried variations of pay-for-performance systems.  The [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=STEPHEN LOSEY |url=http://www.federaltimes.com/article/20100806/BENEFITS01/8060302/1001 |title=DoD ends pay-for-performance system for most intel workers |publisher=FederalTimes.com |date=2010-08-06 |accessdate=2011-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Department of Homeland Security]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/xnews/releases/press_release_0607.shtm |title=DHS: Fact Sheet: DHS and OPM Final Human Resource Regulations |publisher=Dhs.gov |date=2002-11-25 |accessdate=2011-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; have both developed systems, but they were annulled when President Barack Obama signed the [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010|National Defense Authorization Act]] on October 28, 2009.  There has yet to be a new pay-for-performance system implemented on a nationwide scale for the United States Federal Government.

==Research==

When these federal pay for performance systems failed, many were surprised because it had worked so well within the private sector. Much of this failure was attributed to the fact that most of the research on pay for performance had been done in the private rather than public sector.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, James, Trent A. Engbergs, and So Yun Jun. “Back to the Future? Performance-Related Pay, Empirical Research, and the Perils of Persistence.” Theory to Practice, 2009: pg.47&lt;/ref&gt; These perplexing and inconsistent results between the private and public sectors led academia to question why pay-for-performance programs in the public sector were not as effective. Research revealed that two main factors contributed to poor public sector motivation and performance: (1) the public sector has unique budgeting restrictions that make it difficult to effectively implement such a program, and (2) the type of motivation that affects employees in the federal public sector is different from the motivators that work for employees of private business firms.

===Unique Characteristics of the Public Sector===
A limited and restricted budget is one of the biggest factors that have prevented the public sector from successfully implementing a pay for performance program.  As noted by Antoinette Weibel, the private sector simply has more money and will always be more fluid with cash than any public sector organization.  [[Profit motive]] will always matter in the private sector because a business organization's function is to maximize profits.&lt;ref&gt;Weibel, Antoinette, Katja Rost, and Margit Osterloh. “Pay for Performance in the Public Sector—Benefits and (Hidden) Costs.” Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Since public organizations operate on tax revenue, they are expected to act responsibly for that stewardship of resources. Public institutions also operate in nonmarket conditions and are subject to unique rules and expectations.  This makes budgeting for incentives very difficult because unlike private sector businesses, public organizations cannot arrange their incentives around the company profit.  By their very nature of receiving funds instead of generating them, public organizations can never have the same freedom that private organizations have in providing incentives in the work force.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, James, Trent A. Engbergs, and So Yun Jun. “Back to the Future? Performance-Related Pay, Empirical Research, and the Perils of Persistence.” Theory to Practice, 2009: pg. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

As important as the budget differences are to the issue of pay for performance, the difference in how federal and private sector employees respond to motivators is even more crucial. Weibel has demonstrated that public servants tend to gravitate more to intrinsic motivation, but two key researchers, [[Edward L. Deci]] and Robert Eisenburger, have disagreed as to whether extrinsic motivation is harmful to intrinsically motivated individuals.  Deci designed a study that involved college students who were given an "interesting" activity to perform.  Some of those students were provided tangible rewards (e.g. money) as an extrinsic motivation and were observed by researchers to see how they reacted. From these studies, Deci argued that some activities provide their own inherent reward, so motivation for such activities is not dependent on external rewards.  Deci goes even further to show that when extrinsic rewards are placed on these activities, it is detrimental to performance because it puts a market price on something they already value internally.&lt;ref&gt;Deci, Edward L. “Effects of Externally Mediated Rewards on Intrinsic Motivation.” Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 18:1, 1971: pg. 105-115.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eisenberger designed a study meant to refute Deci's claim.  His results reported that “perceived competence partially mediated the positive relationship found between performance-contingent reward and intrinsic motivation.”&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberger, Robert W.; Pierce, David; and Cameron J., Judy:  Effects of Reward on Intrinsic Motivation, 1999: pg 678&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the detrimental effects of providing tangible rewards, discussed in the Deci studies, occurred under highly restricted, easily avoidable conditions.

Although a push for providing extrinsic motivation is still politically popular, research continues to lean toward the understanding of Deci and Perry—that the public sector is fundamentally different from the private sector.  Since those who work for government or non-profit organizations are more likely to be in the mindset of serving others, they tend to be motivated more intrinsically.  They perform tasks because of loyalty or an internalized sense of duty, and/or enjoyment.  Giving employees a performance-contingent monetary incentive to do something they already enjoy can decrease his/her motivation to do it as the person is then likely to view its action as externally driven rather than as internally appealing.&lt;ref&gt;Weibel, Antoinette, Katja Rost, and Margit Osterloh. “Pay for Performance in the Public Sector—Benefits and (Hidden) Costs.” Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory, 2009: pg. 387-412&lt;/ref&gt;

Weibel contributed further to Perry and Deci's findings when she and her team examined the benefits and costs of an extrinsically motivated system, and compared this system in the public and the private sectors.  This clearly defined scope allowed the pay-for-performance policies in each sector to be evaluated individually.  The authors’ hypothesis was that the public sector has specific characteristics (the same as those diagnosed by Deci and Perry) that would make pay for performance ineffective, calling the proposed adoption for such policies “naïve.” &lt;ref&gt;Weibel, Antoinette, Katja Rost, and Margit Osterloh. “Pay for Performance in the Public Sector—Benefits and (Hidden) Costs.” Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory, 2009: pg. 397&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent Developments===

Research has continued to support the notion that although incentive systems may be effective and efficient in one organizational context, they can be ineffective or even counterproductive in others.  [[Daniel H. Pink|Daniel Pink]] has been another persuasive voice who has drawn on many of these studies to call for new methods of motivation in the workplace. [[Image:Daniel H pink.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Daniel H. Pink in London]] He cites an [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] study in which the research team repeatedly demonstrated that as long as the tasks being undertaken are purely mechanical, performance-related pay works to improve results.  The moment a task required any cognitive skill, the incentives became detrimental to performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Dan Ariely |author2=Uri Gneezy |author3=George Loewenstein |author4=Nina Mazar  |last-author-amp=yes |url=http://www.bos.frb.org/economic/wp/wp2005/wp0511.pdf |title=Large Stakes and Big Mistakes, Working Paper |publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Working Papers pg: 05-11|date=2005-07-23 |accessdate=2012-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Others, such as Weibel, have also urged caution in implementing the pay-for-performance models of old.  In the federal government, this is especially important because intrinsically motivated public service agents are shown to have a “higher incentive to invest in expert knowledge than extrinsically motivated ones and therefore function as the ‘[[institutional memory]]’ of public service.”&lt;ref&gt;Weibel, Antoinette, Katja Rost, and Margit Osterloh. “Pay for Performance in the Public Sector—Benefits and (Hidden) Costs.” Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory, 2009: pg. 390&lt;/ref&gt;

To preserve that institutional memory and continue to attract intrinsically motivated employees, the government will likely need alternative models to replace or supplement the popular business model of performance-related pay.  Some have suggested an incentive plan that focuses on employees' internal motivation.  Instead of cash bonuses or raises, employees may instead be given discretionary time to work on creative projects in which they have a personal interest, as has been implemented by companies such as [http://gigaom.com/collaboration/mix-up-the-workweek-by-setting-your-own-20-percent-time/ Google and 3M].  Another alternative to a strictly intrinsically based model may be a hybrid in which monetary rewards and intrinsic incentives are offered, giving the employees of both dispositions the motivation to increase performance.  It is unclear what the next step of action will be for the federal government, but since the issue of pay for performance is so politically popular it is unlikely that the issue will go away any time soon.

The President’s Management Agenda (PMA) and Office of Budget and Management asked federal government agencies to maximize performance as well as reevaluate and restructure human capital. These agencies were also required to amend ineffective policies on performance management. The PMA recommended streamlining the system of compensating and rewarding federal employees. One way is move from the present General Schedule approach to a system that emphasizes performance-based wages&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fedweek.com/issue-briefs/pay-for-performance-possible-but-takes-much-work-says-mspb/|title=Pay for Performance Possible but Takes Much Work, Says MSPB|date=2018-06-06|work=FEDweek|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In the USA and many countries of Western Europe, pay for performance plans are used collectively. In Hong Kong, the popularity of pay for performance is increasing gradually both in the public and private sectors&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/business/article/1916506/science-shows-pay-performance-works-if-used-properly|title=Science shows pay for performance works, if used properly|work=South China Morning Post|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

A '''postdoctoral researcher''' or '''postdoc''' is a person professionally conducting research after the completion of their doctoral studies (typically a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]]).  The ultimate goal of a postdoctoral research position is to pursue additional research, training, or teaching in order to have better skills to pursue a career in academia, research, or any other fields.&lt;ref&gt;[https://postdocs.cornell.edu/structure-postdoctoral-study Postdoctoral study], Cornell University{{full citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=September 2018}} Postdocs often, but not always, have a temporary academic appointment, sometimes in preparation for an academic [[Faculty (academic staff)|faculty]] position. They continue their studies or carry out research and further increase expertise in a specialist subject, including integrating a team and acquiring novel skills and research methods. Postdoctoral research is often considered essential while advancing the scholarly mission of the host institution; it is expected to produce relevant publications in peer-reviewed academic journals or conferences. In some countries, postdoctoral research may lead to further formal qualifications or certification, while in other countries it does not.&lt;ref name=whatisapostdoc/&gt;&lt;ref name=kendall/&gt;

Postdoctoral research may be funded through an appointment with a salary or an appointment with a [[stipend]] or sponsorship award. Appointments for such a research position may be called '''postdoctoral research fellow''', '''postdoctoral research associate''' or '''postdoctoral research assistant'''. Depending on the type of appointment, postdoctoral researchers may work independently or under the supervision of a [[principal investigator]]. However, a designated postdoctoral research appointment may also be taken up when other suitable positions are not available, rather than merely pursuing the deepening of scholarly experience. In many English-speaking countries, postdoctoral researchers are colloquially referred to as "postdocs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalpostdoc.org/postdocs|publisher=NationalPostDoc.org|title=National Postdoctoral Association: Career Development Resources|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316003026/http://nationalpostdoc.org/postdocs|archivedate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional variations in postdoctoral employment==

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]] in 2003, 25% of PhD graduates in the natural sciences continued to undertake postdoctoral research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grad.ac.uk/cms/ShowPage/Home_page/Resources/What_Do_PhDs_Do_/Physical_Sciences_and_Engineering/p!eklggFa|title=UK GRAD Programme: Physical sciences and engineering PhD graduates from 2003 at a glance|accessdate=2007-12-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929102616/http://www.grad.ac.uk/cms/ShowPage/Home_page/Resources/What_Do_PhDs_Do_/Physical_Sciences_and_Engineering/p%21eklggFa|archivedate=29 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the landmark ruling in the employment tribunal (Scotland) Ball vs Aberdeen University 2008 case (S/101486/08), researchers who have held successive fixed-term contracts for four years' service are no longer temporary employees but are entitled to open-ended contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ucu.org.uk/index.cfm?articleid=3571 | title=UCU – University and College Union – Research staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the US, a postdoctoral scholar is an individual holding a doctoral degree who is engaged in mentored research or scholarly training for the purpose of acquiring the professional skills needed to pursue a career path of his or her choosing.&lt;ref name=whatisapostdoc&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402085942/http://www.nationalpostdoc.org/policy/what-is-a-postdoc|archivedate=2015-04-02|url=http://www.nationalpostdoc.org/policy/what-is-a-postdoc | title=What is a Postdoc?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postdoctoral researchers play an important role in spearheading [[postgraduate research]] activity in the US. The median salary of postdoctoral researchers is $42,000 a year for up to 5 years after receiving their doctoral degrees—44% less than the $75,000 average for tenured positions.&lt;ref name="nsf.gov"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind12/pdf/c03.pdf | title=Science and Engineering Labor Force. In Science and Engineering Indicators 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Postdoctoral Association]] (NPA)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal
 | pmid = 20930810

| author1 = Gewin
| first1 = V
| title = The spread of postdoc unions

| issue = 7316
| pages = 739–41
| doi = 10.1038/467638a
}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a member-driven organization that provides a voice for postdoctoral scholars in the United States.

Postdoctoral research may be required for obtaining a [[tenure-track]] faculty position, especially at research-oriented institutions. Post-doctoral appointments that were traditionally optional have become mandatory in some fields as the degree of competition for tenure-track positions in academia has significantly increased over previous decades. In fact, the small supply of the professional positions in academia compared to the growing number of postdoctoral researchers makes it difficult to find tenure-track positions. In 2008, the proportion of postdoctoral researchers who got a tenure or tenure-track within 5 years after they received a doctoral degree was about 39%;&lt;ref name="nsf.gov" /&gt; nearly 10% of postdoctoral researchers were still waiting for tenure-track positions over 40 in 2003.&lt;ref name="sigmaxi.org"&gt;http://www.sigmaxi.org/postdoc/highlights.pdf {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323153949/http://www.sigmaxi.org/postdoc/highlights.pdf |date=23 March 2012 }}{{full citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=September 2018}}

On the other hand, 85 percent of engineering doctoral degrees holder are likely to initially go into business or industry sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pathwaysreport.org/rsc/pdf/19089_PathwaysRept_Links.pdf | title=Pathway Through Graduate School and Into Careers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the circumstances, providing doctoral students as well as postdoctoral researchers with necessary skills for nonacademic positions has become one of the important roles for graduate schools and institutions. The [[America COMPETES Act]] recognized the importance of graduate student support for obtaining skills needed when they pursue nonacademic careers, and required [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) to increase or decrease funding for the Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) programs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=12759&amp;org=DGE&amp;from=home | title=Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship Program}}&lt;/ref&gt; at least at the same rate as it increases or decreases funding for the Graduate Research Fellowship.  There are no comprehensive data of international postdoctoral researchers in the US because of the less-organized survey and the difficulty in counting international postdoctoral researchers. The proportion of postdoctoral researchers on temporary visas reached 53.6% in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/infbrief/nsf12317/ | title=Graduate Enrollment in Science and Engineering Grew Substantially in the Past Decade but Slowed in 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The life sciences hold the largest percentage of postdoctoral researchers on temporary visas; in 2008, approximately 56% of postdoctoral researchers in the life sciences were temporary residents. Of these postdoctoral researchers on temporary visas, four out of five earned their PhD outside of the United States.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=How Economics Shapes Science|last=Stephan|first=Paula|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0-674-04971-0|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=166–167, 195|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There exists fear that foreign PhD's are taking postdoctoral research positions from American researchers. The influx of foreign PhD's has influenced the supply of ready-researchers, and thereby, the wages.  One estimate claims that a 10% increase in the supply of foreign postdoctoral researchers lower the position salary by 3–4%.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the US, life sciences have a greater share than other fields due to higher federal funding of life and medical science areas since mid 1990 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/about/congress/115/highlights/cu17_0508.jsp|title=Budget of NSF for the fiscal year 2015.}}&lt;/ref&gt;. One survey shows that 54% of postdoctoral researchers major in life sciences, whereas those who majored in physical science, mathematics, and engineering account for 28%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aau.edu/policy/postdoctoral.aspx | title=Postdoctoral Education Survey Summary of Results}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, postdoctoral researchers in California formed a union, [[UAW Local 5810]] in order to secure better working conditions such as the right to file a complaint for alleged discrimination or sexual harassment through a formal grievance procedure.&lt;ref name="KM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2010/08/california-postdocs-embrace-union.html|title=California Postdocs Embrace Union Contract|author=Kristen Minogue|publisher=Science Insider|date=Aug 13, 2010|accessdate=June 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In California, new postdoctoral appointments receive at least the NIH postdoctoral minimum salary ($39,264 in 2011) and many receive annual pay raises of 5–7% or more in accordance with the NIH’s Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Awards (NRSA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award (NRSA) Stipends, Tuition/Fees and Other Budgetary Levels Effective for Fiscal Year 2012|url=http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-12-033.html|publisher=National Institutes of Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, postdoctoral researchers in Boston organized the "[http://futureofresearch.org/ Future of Research]" Symposium to respond to a conversation about the state of biomedical research&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Rescuing US biomedical research from its systemic flaws|url = http://www.pnas.org/content/111/16/5773|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date = 2014-04-22|issn = 0027-8424|pmc = 4000813|pmid = 24733905|pages = 5773–5777|volume = 111|issue = 16|doi = 10.1073/pnas.1404402111|first = Bruce|last = Alberts|first2 = Marc W.|last2 = Kirschner|first3 = Shirley|last3 = Tilghman|first4 = Harold|last4 = Varmus}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the perspective of junior scientists. The meeting included panel discussions with academics concerned about the scientific enterprise, a video message from [[Massachusetts]] senator [[Elizabeth Warren]], and workshops discussing training, funding, the structure of the biomedical workforce, and metrics and incentives in science which were used to generate recommendations in a white paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Shaping the Future of Research: a perspective from junior scientists|url = http://f1000research.com/articles/3-291/v2|journal = F1000Research|pmc = 4304227|pmid = 25653845|doi = 10.12688/f1000research.5878.2|first = Gary S.|last = McDowell|first2 = Kearney T.

===India===

Most of India's premier engineering, science and management institutes (like [[Indian Institutes of Technology]] (IITs), [[Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research]] (IISERs) and [[Indian Institutes of Management]] (IIMs)) have postdoctoral positions. The salary typically varies from INR 40,000 – 70,000 per month. For example, IIT Kharagpur, IIT Delhi, IIT Kanpur, IIT Bombay, IIT Madras, IISER Mohali, IISER Pune, IISER Kolkata, IIM Kolkata offer postdoctoral fellowships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=IIT Delhi|first1=PostDoc|title=Postdoc in IIT Delhi|url=http://www.iitd.ac.in/content/post-doctoral-fellows-pdf|publisher=IIT Delhi|accessdate=2015-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
Salaried appointments at the minimum Level A, Step 6 for academic salaries, for doctoral qualified employees (beginning in 2008) are set at A$75,612 p.a. at the [[University of Sydney]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usyd.edu.au/hr/eb/2006/AC_annual_rates.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090823140512/http://www.usyd.edu.au/hr/eb/2006/AC_annual_rates.pdf |archivedate=23 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}, Retrieved on 4 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; A$75,404 p.a. at the [[University of Melbourne]],&lt;ref&gt;http://policy.unimelb.edu.au/UOM0115#section-1.1.1, Retrieved on 4 June 2012{{full citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=September 2018}} and A$75,612 p.a. at the [[University of New South Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hr.unsw.edu.au/services/salaries/acadsal.html, Retrieved on 4 June 2012{{full citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Alternatively the Australian Research Council (ARC) provides Postdoctoral Fellowships.

=== China ===
The postdoctoral system in China was founded in 1985 upon suggestion by Chinese American physicist and Nobel laureate [[Tsung-Dao Lee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.people.cn/90001/90776/90881/7214766.html|title=China establishes 4,300 postdoc research centers |publisher=People's Daily|date=November 29, 2010|accessdate=November 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Office of the National Administrative Committee of Postdoctoral Researchers ({{zh|s=全国博士后管理委员会办公室}}) regulates all postdoctoral mobile stations ({{zh|s=博士后科研流动站}}) at universities and postdoctoral work stations ({{zh|s=博士后科研工作站}}) at institutes and enterprises in mainland China. Applicants to postdoctoral positions have to pass a detailed medical check-up in order to enter the stations ({{zh|s=进站}}). Postdoctoral researchers are required to undergo regular evaluations, and submit a research report for evaluation at the end of the postdoctoral period to obtain approval to leave the stations ({{zh|c=出站}}). Those who are approved to leave the stations will receive a postdoctoral certificate from the national administration office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinapostdoctor.org.cn/website/program/Info_Show.aspx?InfoID=7a9dbfe3-1b57-4bf5-bf12-ce3a89d0addb|title=关于印发《博士后管理工作规定》的通知|website=中国博士后网|author= Ministry of Personnel of the PRC|accessdate=26 October 2018|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some universities, postdoctoral researchers who fail to leave their stations normally, either due to failing their evaluations or early withdrawal from the stations ({{zh|c=退站}}), may be asked to pay back the grants or even the salaries that they have received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hr.fudan.edu.cn/97/ac/c10839a104364/page.htm|title=复旦大学博士后退站流程|website=Fudan University|accessdate=26 October 2018|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xxgk.sjtu.edu.cn/2013/0113/1239.html|title=上海交通大学关于调整博士后相关管理工作规定的通知|website=Shanghai Jiao Tong University|accessdate=26 October 2018|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pharm.sdu.edu.cn/info/1092/8216.htm|title=药学院博士后流动站管理工作实施细则|website=School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Shandong University|accessdate=26 October 2018|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://renshichu.xaut.edu.cn/info/1120/1113.htm|title=西安理工大学博士后研究人员管理办法|website=Xi'an University of Technology|accessdate=26 October 2018|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sus.edu.cn/info/1008/9665.htm|title=上海体育学院博士后管理办法|website=Shanghai University of Sport|accessdate=26 October 2018|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://postdoc.ecupl.edu.cn/s/305/t/91/59/ea/info23018.htm|title=华东政法大学师资博士后研究人员工作协议|website=East China University of Political Science and Law|accessdate=26 October 2018|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muchong.com/html/201209/4944886.html|title=求助：博后中途退站——退还之前发放生活补贴？|website=小木虫|accessdate=26 October 2018|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the way that the postdoctoral system is managed, postdoctoral research is widely mistaken to be an academic degree in China. Also, the government's administration of the postdoctoral system is blasted for hindering innovative research, as too much effort is spent on evaluations, and overemphasis on performance prevents the creation of a relaxing research environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.guancha.cn/Education/2015_03_10_311685.shtml|title=两会热点校长说：校长后加副部级丢人 把博士后当成学位很荒唐|work=Guancha|date=March 10, 2015|accessdate=November 18, 2018|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Russ i tog.jpg|thumb|The russ of 2005 at 17th of May parade in Oslo, Norway]]

The '''''russefeiring''''' ({{lang-en|"russ celebration"}}) is a traditional celebration for [[Norway|Norwegian]] upper secondary school (high school/prep school) pupils in their final spring semester. Pupils that take part in the celebrations are known as '''russ'''. The russefeiring traditionally starts on around 20 April (With some starting earlier/later depending on the regional county) and ends on 17 May, the [[Norwegian Constitution Day|Norwegian Constitution day]]. Participants wear coloured overalls (Usually red, blue, or black). Some make groups, name a bus, car or van (Often making a name or logo). Some also decide to celebrate almost continually during this period. Some of the Russ that buy a bus, van or car party in this bus the entire night until school every day from the start to 17 May. Drunkenness and public disturbances are regularly linked to the celebration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.an.no/nyheter/article6663597.ece|title=Avisa Nordland - Fauske-russ herjet museumsområde|author=Lars Antonsen 99 22 65 78la@an.no|work=www.an.no|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=10110264|title=Russ raserte rekkehusområde - mistenker promillekjøring|author=Ola Mjaaland|work=VG|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.budstikka.no/nyheter/russ-kobles-til-smuglerol-1.7882142|title=Budstikka - Russ kobles til smuglerøl|author=Per Erik Hagen og Jørgen Dahl Kristensen|work=www.budstikka.no|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.budstikka.no/nyheter/russ-besjet-i-meny-butikk-1.7863161|title=Budstikka - Russ bæsjet i Meny-butikk|author=Jørgen Dahl Kristensen|work=www.budstikka.no|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.budstikka.no/nyheter/politiet-det-er-bare-tragisk-det-blir-ikke-russ-pa-tobonn-neste-ar-1.7858156|title=Budstikka - Politiet: – Det er bare tragisk.

==History==
The modern Norwegian ''russefeiring'' dates back to 1905, when the red ''russ'' caps (russelue) were introduced to graduation celebrations as a sign of the imminent acceptance into the system of higher education. The caps were initially only used by boys, and were inspired by [[Germany|German]] students, who in 1904 wore red caps when they visited Norway. In 1916, blue caps were introduced at the [[Oslo Commerce School]], a prestigious high school specializing in [[economics]], in order to separate them from the common graduates. Later, celebrations were gradually extended, similarly coloured overalls (russedress) were added, and the caps were saved for the final day of celebrations.

[[Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson]], Nobel Prize laureate in literature, attempted to convey the spirit of the russ-celebration in the poem "Jeg velger meg April" ("I choose April"). The russ have figured in a number of poems and song lyrics, especially those from the early 20th century.

As time passed, students graduating from vocational courses were allowed to participate in the celebrations, and additional overall and cap colours were gradually introduced by some of the vocational graduates. The celebrations then became a general celebration of the end of upper secondary school ([[videregående skole]]).

In Norway, most pupils turn 18 just before the russefeiring. The age of 18 is both the age limit for buying alcohol and acquiring a driver's license. Therefore, the growing festivities also led to increased alcohol consumption, and in the '70s the tradition of buying old cars, vans, buses and even lorries and painting them in the same colours as the overalls became common.

These cars would be extensively decorated, and serve as mobile homes and party venues for the russ during the russefeiring. They would be outfitted with tables, chairs, bunk beds, sound and lighting systems, and melodic horns. These vehicles were named ''russebiler'' (russ cars). Over the '80s it became fairly common to rip the cargo beds off lorries and build log cabins on the frames instead. However, due to safety issues this practice was banned during the early '90s. Also regulations were introduced that required every russ vehicle to have a designated non-russ driver. This, together with the no-tolerance policy on alcohol consumption by drivers introduced in the late 90s, greatly reduced the number of accidents involving russ vehicles.

Russ cars and buses would gather for impromptu partying on school grounds, parking lots, beaches and other suitable places. Sometimes up to several hundreds of cars and buses would gather in one place. Eventually, these events became organized by commercial interests, who then also took over responsibility for the security of the participants. Still russ gather their vehicles for impromptu partying, but in smaller numbers.

By the early 2000s authorities were once again worried about impact of the partying and alcohol consumption during the russefeiring. In an attempt to reduce the extent of the celebrations, some of the final exams in public schools were moved to early may. Traditionally, these had all been taking place in late May and early June. The idea was that forcing the pupils to prepare for exams instead of partying would reduce the extent of the problem. This had no noticeable effect, however, and resistance from pupils' organizations moved the exams back, with the argument that the only effect was to have pupils sacrifice grades for partying.

==Duration==
The festivities start anytime between 11 April and May 1 (different dates for each city). On this date, russ are allowed to put on their overalls, board their vehicles, and officially become russ. From then on celebrations continue almost non-stop until 17 May (the [[Norwegian Constitution Day|national day]]). On this day the russ are awarded their caps, and participate in the traditional 17 May parades. In the meantime, there are a number of smaller and bigger events for russ to participate in. The dates of the biggest parties are usually the 1st where the students are 'christened' with personalized russ names which are written on their caps, and 16 May, which is the second biggest party night, as these two dates are followed by national holidays ([[May day]] and [[Norwegian Constitution Day]]).

==Function==
Russefeiring is a long-standing tradition and a major cultural phenomenon in [[Norway]]. Apart from being a celebration of the imminent end of 12 or 13 years of compulsory schooling, it has also become a rite of passage into adulthood, and a farewell to classmates from the [[videregående skole]] (upper secondary school) who will now go their separate ways in search for jobs or higher education. It is therefore an important period in the lives of most Norwegian adolescents.

In the period, there are several russetreff, translated ''russ meeting''. At these events ten thousands of russ meet in an allocated area for one or more days. There are concerts, bus competitions in several circles (bus with the best sound systems, best lighting systems, best design, bus of the year and "Lord of the Rings"), and the sale of beer and food.

While russefeiring is optional, there are few pupils who do not participate in any way, although the extent of involvement varies individually. However, there are pupils who, due to personal or religious reasons, do not consume alcohol, and therefore object to the nature of many of the celebrations, which contribute to its image as the "treukersfylla" ("the three-week binge"). These pupils do not partake in common festivities to the same degree that other russ do and sometimes create their own events such as the "kristenruss" ("christian russ"), do.

===Overall colours===
There are several different types of ''russ'' differing in the colour of the caps and traditional uniforms most students carry during the entire ''russ'' period. The colour of the uniforms usually reflects what type of study the person is completing (see below). However, in some regions such as [[Stavanger]], the colour is determined by the school. Typically in these areas, if the headmaster of the school was a blue russ, the students will also be blue regardless of what they are studying (vocational students will still usually be black russ).

;Red (rødruss)
:''Allmennfag'' (general studies) (mathematics, physics, biology, history, literature, English etc); media and communication, art, music, dance and drama; and athletics. This is the most common colour.
;Blue (blåruss)
:Business Administration studies (Økonomi &amp; Administrasjon)
;Black (svartruss)
:[[Vocational]] courses (like electronics, carpentry or culinary programs). As Norwegian vocational studies consist of 2 years of schooling and 1 or 2 years of apprenticeship, black russ can choose to celebrate at the end of school, at the end of the apprenticeship, or both. Some red russ choose black in order to stand out, although most red and blue russes do not acknowledge them as real russes. In fact, since most black russ are under 18 years old, they chose to order the red overalls in order to enter party sites where only those over 18 are allowed.
;Green (grønnruss)
:[[Agricultural]] courses, also used by some as an alternative to orange ''russ''.
;White (hvitruss)
:In some regions, athletics students or healthcare students use white uniforms. Christian ''russ'' choosing to celebrate without alcohol sometimes use this colour, but most often wear the same colours as their classmates. Christian ''russ'' might form their own groups to have fun together without peer pressure towards drinking alcohol and achieving the knot requirements.
;Miscellaneous
:Occasionally, children in the last year of [[kindergarten]] dress up as "pink ''russ''" (''rosaruss''), or girls as pink ''russ'' and boys as light blue ''russ''. In some places, pupils finishing the last year of middle school (''ungdomsskolen'') dress up as "orange ''russ''" (''oransjeruss'') or "green ''russ''" (''grønnruss''). These celebrations have not become very common.

==The russ board==
It is common to appoint a russpresident, a party coordinator, a newspaper editor, some journalists, a contraceptive responsible person and some other funny titles to some russ.

The russepresident is responsible for about everything with the russ and to give an interview to a local newspaper and hold a speech on Constitution Day. The party coordinator organizes parties with different themes (for instance "What are you going to be when you're fully educated?", "bad taste" and "halloween"). The newspaper editor and the journalists make a russenewspaper. The contraceptive responsible gets some thousand condoms from the Red Cross to pass out to the russ (The Red Cross decided to give away condoms for free to russ because of the massive increase in Chlamydia, Herpes and Gonorrhea after May one year).

=="Knots and happenings"==
Ståkuka translates roughly to 'noisy week'. Ståkuka is the last week in April where there are different themes to dress up to. There is a different theme for each day and the typical themes are:

* Change sex day
* Army day
* Pajamas day
* Hero day
* Emo day
* Business day

On army day it is very common for different schools or different coloured russ to "attack" each other with water balloons and water guns. Often younger students are taken hostage and dipped in water.

This is typically frowned upon by teachers and cleaning staff as windows tend to be broken and hallways tend to be soaking wet.

===Knots===
The '''russ knots''' ({{lang-no|Russeknuter}}) on the string of the russ' cap are a wide variety of rewards signaling that the student has fulfilled a certain accomplishment during the russ period. They can be simple knots or tokens attached to the string. Lists of assignments and associated knots are publicized each year by russ committees at schools and communities. The knot often consists of an item representing the accomplishment. For instance, passing through the back seat of a car stopping on a red light (inspired by the [[television advertisement]] for the sweet ''[[Mentos]]''), earns them a piece of wrapping from the sweet. The ''russ knot list'' was first introduced in the 1940s.

The [[knot rules]] are sometimes criticized because they can involve illegal acts, such as public nudity or public sexual intercourse, outright assault and possibly self-harming actions such as consuming large amounts of alcohol in a short span of time (earning a beer cap or wine cork). Other more benign tasks exist, such as putting a ''for sale'' sign on a police car, or spending the night at a teacher's house and making him/her breakfast in the morning, all without being noticed. Counting both national and local lists, there can be hundreds of different tasks that can be performed to gain knots, with huge varieties between districts and individual schools. Due to criticism in media, many of the russ knots are removed and replaced by other knots every year to decrease its severe impact on the students. Some of the previous knots have been physically dangerous when it involves drinking 24 bottles of beer within 24 hours, or place half a box of [[snus]] under ones lip for a certain period of time. This can lead to alcohol poisoning and severe brain damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tisdall|first1=Jonathan|title=Unsafe sex "a joke"|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article1015772.ece|publisher=''[[Aftenposten]]''|accessdate=25 April 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016030532/http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article1015772.ece|archivedate=September 16, 2008|language=Norwegian|date=April 12, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few russ knot examples:

* Spending a night in a tree (earns a stick from the tree)
* Eating a [[Big Mac]] hamburger in two bites (earns a piece of the wrapping)
* Drinking a bottle of wine in 20 minutes (earns the wine cork)
* Crawling through a [[supermarket]] while barking and biting customers' legs (earns a dog biscuit)
* Spending a school day crawling on hands and knees (earns a toy shoe)
* Spending the entire russ period sober (earns a fizzy drink cork)
* Drinking 24 beers in 24 hours (girls) or 12 hours (boys)
* Go for a swim before 1 May
* Ask random people in a mall if they can lend one a [[condom]] (earns the condom)
* Stage a false break up with a random 16-year-old in public
* Sit in a [[roundabout]] with a sign saying in Norwegian: "{{lang|No|Vi drikker hvis dere tuter!}}" ("We'll have drink if you honk your horn!").
* Host an aerobic class at the local pub and get at least ten people to join.
It is common for every school to have about 100 knots. If a russ does 50 or 70 of them he or she can choose to do three extra embarrassing or hard knots to become an eliteruss.

A few eliteruss knot examples:

* Tattoo Russ and the year he or she were russ on his or her body (For instance "Russ 09").
* Make out with 10 people in one night.
* Give more than {{currency|1,000|NOK2}} (about {{currency|100|UK}} and about {{currency|120|US}}) to charity.
* Dye their hair in the colour they are russ (black, red or blue).

===Vans (Russebiler) and buses (Russebusser)===
In the older days russ often traveled around in an open lorry, either used as-is or with a self-made log cabin added to the cargo area. Today, groups of russ commonly go together to buy a ''russ'' van. In eastern Norway, such as the capital Oslo, the posh suburb of Bærum, and other surrounding cities and areas, russ often choose to have a full-scale bus. Russ vans are typically 15- to 20-year-old [[Volkswagen Caravelle (disambiguation)|Volkswagen Caravelle]]s or [[Chevrolet Van|Chevy Vans]]. The vehicle is painted in their respective ''russ'' colour, either by having it professionally sprayed or with regular wall paint. [[Decal]]s and other decorations are common.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Spektrum.jpeg|thumb]] --&gt;
Russ vehicles bought cheap have a reputation for being in terrible technical condition. Inexperienced and intoxicated drivers, and in some cases even highly flammable alcohol spills, have contributed to fatal traffic accidents and fires in these vehicles. The Norwegian police take part in a concerted effort to improve the situation. Russ who acquire a bus are required by law to hire a professional bus driver for the duration of the celebration, while van drivers might be an older sibling, friend, or a ''russ'' who chooses to abstain from alcohol.

In the ''russ'' vehicle, modern tradition requires a powerful audio equipment inside the vehicle, and on buses also on the roof (the largest systems allowed have forty speaker boxes which can generate over sixty thousand watts and be among the best sound systems in the world, rivaling those used by famous artists on concert tours).&lt;!-- need citation for "...be among the best sound systems in the world, rivaling those used by famous artists on concert tours" or this part of sentence needs to be deleted --&gt; Some buses have had over 60 speaker boxes. Other accessories include sweaters and caps with the group's chosen logo and a bus song or slogan. It is also common to have some sort of theme for the interior and name/concept. Many buses have expensive theme interior, sometimes a bar, and plenty of flat-screens. A party light system is also common in buses.

These buses can be a large financial burden; contributions of up to $30,000 per member have occurred. In some cases, the teenager's parents invest most of the money needed for the buses. However, the average is between $2000 and $6000 per member. Including sponsors, the cost of a bus can reach over {{currency|2,000,000|nok2}}. ({{currency|250,000|usd}})

While some are willing to spend very high sums of money during the russ festivities, mostly on the van/bus but also on clothes, effects, parties (there are special happenings for russ all over the country) and alcohol, most aim to buy a cheap van together with a group of friends. An old van can be passed on to the next generation of russ several times before it is discarded.

It is customary to spend substantial amounts of time working on the vehicle, finding a concept, refurbishing the inside, painting the outside and applying for funding during the weeks (and sometimes years) before the festivities start. Logos of sponsors are written onto the vehicle together with other decorations. Some undertake major rebuilds of the interior, like building a bar counter or beds within the bus. It is not uncommon to start planning the bus several years before the celebration. Everything in the russ celebration is taken care of by the russ themselves, except the bigger events. In these events one will find shops where they sell alcohol and food, international artist performing and the most important, "russekåringen" (lit. "The Russ Awards"), where they designate the different buses as the winner of either the best theme, interior design, sound system, light system, best live-bus, and the most prestigious; the bus of the year.

===Cards (Russekort)===
[[File:Russekort sognruss2003.jpg|thumb|Russekort from 2003]]
Most ''russ'' have personalized calling cards featuring their name, their photograph and a short slogan. These cards are swapped with other ''russ'' and handed out to children and family members. To many children, collecting ''russ'' cards is an important activity during the entire russ period, but especially May, culminating on May 17.

===Newspapers (Russeavis)===
To finance some of the administrative costs, many high schools create ''russ'' newspapers containing fake news, a column written by the ''russ'' president, official knot rules for the specific school, and other content, mostly humorous. The most important feature of a ''russ'' newspaper, however, is a section that presents every class and every student with a photograph and a personalized biography, typically written by friends in a jocular and satirical style. The class may also write a similar entry on their main teacher; the teacher, in turn, writes about their class.
The Russ' newspaper is written and published by Russ' executive board (Russens Hovedstyre).

A '''safari park''', sometimes known as a '''wildlife park''', is a [[zoo]]-like commercial [[drive-in]] tourist attraction where visitors can drive their own vehicles or ride in vehicles provided by the facility to observe freely roaming animals. The main attractions are frequently large animals from Sub-Saharan Africa such as [[giraffe]]s, [[lion]]s, [[rhinoceros]], [[elephant]]s, [[hippopotamus]], [[zebra]]s, [[ostrich]]es, and [[antelope]].

A safari park is larger than a zoo and smaller than a [[game reserve]]. For example, [[African Lion Safari]] in [[Hamilton, Ontario]], Canada is {{convert|750|acre|km2}}. For comparison, [[Lake Nakuru]] in the [[Great Rift Valley, Kenya]], is {{Convert|168|km2}}, and a typical large game reserve is [[Tsavo East National Park|Tsavo East]], also in [[Kenya]], which encompasses {{Convert|11747|km2}}.

Safari parks often have other associated tourist attractions: [[golf courses]], carnival rides, cafes/restaurants, [[ridable miniature railways]], and gift shops.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

==History==
[[File:Giraffes at west midlands safari park.jpg|thumb|right|[[Giraffe]]s being fed by visitors in the [[West Midland Safari Park]], England]]
The predecessor of safari parks is [[Africa U.S.A. Park]] (1953–1961) in [[Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;Life, Vol.49, No.5, August 1, 1960, pp.1,30.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[lion]] drive-through opened in 1963 in [[Tama Zoo|Tama Zoological Park]] in [[Tokyo]]. In double-glazed buses, visitors made a tour through a one-hectare enclosure with twelve African lions.

The first drive-through safari park outside of Africa opened in 1966 at [[Longleat Safari Park|Longleat]] in [[Wiltshire]], England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article737168.ece The lions and loins of Longleat] ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' Retrieved February 18, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/?id=trZX7dbuW54C&amp;pg=PA554 |work=New Scientist|date=2 Dec 1982|accessdate= 18 February 2011|title=Safari parks, after the honeymoon|author=Gail Vines|pages=554–557}}&lt;/ref&gt; Longleat, Windsor, Woburn and arguably the whole concept of safari parks were the brainchild of Jimmy Chipperfield (1912–1990), former co-director of [[Chipperfield's Circus]], although a similar concept is explored as a plot device in [[Angus Wilson]]'s "[[The Old Men at the Zoo]]" which was published five years before Chipperfield set up Longleat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Longleat's [[Marquess of Bath]] agreed to Chipperfield's proposition to fence off {{Convert|40|ha|-1}} of his vast Wiltshire estate to house 50 lions.
Knowsley, the [[Earl of Derby]]'s estate outside [[Liverpool]], and the [[Duke of Bedford]]'s Woburn estate in [[Bedfordshire]] both established their own safari parks with Chiperfield's partnership.
Another circus family, the Smart Brothers, joined the safari park business by opening a park at [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] for visitors from London. The former [[Windsor Safari Park]] was in [[Berkshire, England]], but closed in 1992 and has since been made into a [[Legoland Windsor|Legoland]]. 
There is also Chipperfield's "Scotland Safari Park" established on [[Baronet]] Sir John Muir's estate at [[Blair Drummond]] near [[Stirling]], and the American-run "West Midland Safari and Leisure Park" near [[Birmingham]].
One park along with Jimmy Chipperfield at [[Lambton Castle]] in the [[North East England]] has closed.

Between 1967 and 1974, [[Lion Country Safari]], Inc. opened 6 animal parks, one near each of the following American cities: [[West Palm Beach, Florida]]; [[Los Angeles, California]]; [[Grand Prairie, Texas]]; [[Atlanta, Georgia]]; [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]; and [[Richmond, Virginia]]. The first park, in South Florida, is the only [[Lion Country Safari]] still in operation.

[[Burgers' Zoo]] at [[Arnhem, Netherlands]], opened a "safari park" in 1968 within a traditional [[zoo]]. In 1995, Burgers' Safari modified this to a walking safari with a {{Convert|250|m|sing=on}} board walk. Another safari park in the Netherlands is [[Safaripark Beekse Bergen]].

Most safari parks were established in a short period of ten years, between 1966 and 1975.

'''Ovitigala Vithanage Samantha''' aka '''Samantha Vithanage''' (died 2002) was a third year Management student of the [[University of Sri Jayewardenepura]], [[Sri Lanka]], who pioneered an [[Anti-raggers in Sri Lankan universities|anti-ragging campaign]], and was killed on 7 November 2002 while in a discussion to stop the brutal practice of [[ragging]] in the faculty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailynews.lk/2004/06/10/new16.html University students protest student's slaying] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605025205/http://www.dailynews.lk/2004/06/10/new16.html |date=5 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His death was a landmark incident in the anti-ragging movement of Sri Lankan universities which provoked many students and academic staff of universities to act against [[Ragging in Sri Lanka|ragging]].

On 7 November 2002, the anti-ragging campaigners sat down for a discussion with the pro-rag [[Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna|JVP]] controlled student council - ''General Students Union of University of Sri Jayawardanepura'' (Progressive Front), who defended the practice. The meeting took place at the premises of Department of Marketing Management. Midway through the discussion, a mob of around 200 JVP supporters armed with clubs and stones stormed into the room and viciously attacked Vithanage and others in the anti-ragging camp. The attackers stabbed their victims with shards of glass and Vithanage who was struck, fell to the floor. President of the General Students Union at that time, Sujith Kuruwita crashed a heavy computer monitor on his head.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailynews.lk/2002/11/18/fea02.html Death by killing] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120804174337/http://www.dailynews.lk/2002/11/18/fea02.html |date=4 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vithanage was seriously injured. Pro-ragging students also blocked the vehicle carrying the injured to the hospital, delaying proper medical treatment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.island.lk/2002/11/17/featur04.html The "village" in our political culture: A postscript to an undergrad’s death]&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later Samantha Vithanage died.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.groundviews.org/2009/11/30/ragging-in-our-universities-a-symptom-or-a-disease/ Ragging in our universities: A symptom or a disease?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.wsws.org/articles/2002/dec2002/jvp-d02.shtml JVP-inspired violence leads to crackdown on Sri Lanka campuses] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218173940/http://www.wsws.org/articles/2002/dec2002/jvp-d02.shtml |date=18 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The University Lecturers Association of the Sri Jayawardanapura University (SJU) denouncing the killing of Samantha had stated "This inhumane student slaughter is the most brutal killing and the worst black mark in the history of the SJU."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesundayleader.lk/archive/20050807/review.htm Lest we forget...]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vikramabahu Karunaratne|Dr. Vikramabahu Karunaratne]] accused [[Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna]] - a [[Marxist-Leninist]], [[political party]] for the murder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailynews.lk/2002/11/12/new01.html PM orders report on murder of J'pura student ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016224116/http://www.dailynews.lk/2002/11/12/new01.html |date=16 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; General Students Union of University of Sri Jayawardanepura is a member of the [[Inter University Students' Federation]], a [[students' union]] affiliated to JVP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.colombopage.com/archive_10B/Jul29_1280411563CH.php | title=Sri Lanka Marxist student union lodges complaint with HRC | publisher=Colombo Page | year=2010 | accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Samantha Vithagane fund was created in memory of the slain student Samantha Vithanage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailynews.lk/2004/07/06/new15.html Samurdhi students funds misappropriated] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016224155/http://www.dailynews.lk/2004/07/06/new15.html |date=16 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the death of 22-year-old Vithanage subdued the rag at the [[University of Sri Jayewardenepura]] for a while, it has not totally eradicated the practice.

[[Image:TTUstudentunion.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Student Activity Center on the campus of [[Texas Tech University]]]]
A '''student center''' is a type of building found on [[university]] campuses. In the [[United States]], such a building may be called a '''student union''', '''student commons''', '''union''' or '''student center'''. The term "student union" refers most often in the [[United States]] to a building, while in other nations a "[[students' union]]" is the [[student government]].  Nevertheless, the [[Association of College Unions International]] (largely US-based) has several hundred campus organizational members in the US; there is no sharp dichotomy in interpretation of ''union'' in this context.  The US usage in reference to a location is simply a shortened form of '''student union building'''.

==History==
The first student union in America was [[Houston Hall (University of Pennsylvania)|Houston Hall]], at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], which opened January 2, 1896&lt;ref&gt;''Building America's First University: An Historical and Architectural Guide to the University of Pennsylvania'' George E. Thomas, David Bruce Brownlee, p3&lt;/ref&gt; and remains in operation to this day.  The first Ohio Union at [[Ohio State University]] was Enarson Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ohiounion.osu.edu/about_the_union/history|title=The Ohio Union at Ohio State University|website=ohiounion.osu.edu|accessdate=2015-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The building opened in 1911 and was the first student union to be built at a state university and the fourth of its kind in the United States.&lt;ref name="What was the first student union"&gt;{{cite web |title=What was the first student union |url=http://library.osu.edu/find/collections/the-ohio-state-university-archives/buckeye-history/faqs/ |work=What was the first student union|accessdate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oklahoma State University]]'s student center opened in 1950. Subsequent additions, and renovations in 2010, have made the building one of the largest student activity centers in the world at {{convert|611000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://union.okstate.edu/renovation/BuildingHistory.htm |title=OSU Student Union Building History |publisher=Union.okstate.edu |date=September 9, 1950 |accessdate=February 24, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720020635/http://union.okstate.edu/renovation/BuildingHistory.htm |archivedate=July 20, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orgs.okstate.edu/ntso/ANTSHE%20Pages/antshe%20page.htm ANSTHE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325014557/http://www.orgs.okstate.edu/ntso/ANTSHE%20Pages/antshe%20page.htm|date=2009-03-25}}, Oklahoma State University, retrieved April 23, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Some student centers carry unique origins and historical significance with some on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. [[William Pitt Union|The William Pitt Union]] was originally constructed in 1898 as a hotel and was converted into a student center in 1956.&lt;ref name="williampittunion"&gt;http://www.williampittunion.pitt.edu/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; Some student activity centers on the [[National Register of Historic Places|NRHP]] include [[O'Hara Student Center]] ([[University of Pittsburgh]]), [[McKenny Hall]] ([[Eastern Michigan University]]), and the [[Tivoli Brewery Company (building)|Tivoli Student Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.city.pittsburgh.pa.us/cp/maps/historical/Oakland-Civic-Center-CHD.pdf| title=Oakland Civic Center City Designated Historic District| publisher=City of Pittsburgh Historic Review Commission| accessdate=2009-07-10| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100108054002/http://www.city.pittsburgh.pa.us/cp/maps/historical/Oakland-Civic-Center-CHD.pdf| archivedate=2010-01-08| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.ypsilantihistoricalsociety.org/publications/spring2009.pdf |accessdate=2011-02-12 |date=Spring 2009 |publisher=[[Ypsilanti Historical Society]] |pages=14–15 |format=PDF |title=Charles McKenny Union: An EMU Icon |last1=German |first1=Pamela |last2=Robinson |first2=Veronica |work=Ypsilanti Gleanings}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tivoli Student Union was originally home to the Trevoli Brewing Company but since has been converted to serve several institutions in [[Auraria, Denver|Denver]], [[Colorado]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dumondchemicals.com/html/tivoli_student_union.htm] $20 Million Makeover For Denver's Historic Tivoli's Student Union&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the [[University of Vermont]]'s student center became the first [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED Gold certification]] by the [[U.S. Green Building Council]].&lt;ref name="Vermont Student union opens"&gt;{{cite web|title=Vermont Student union opens|url=http://www.uvm.edu/~arch/?Page=projects/commons.html&amp;SM=pastprojectsmenu.html|work=Vermont Student union opens|accessdate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other examples of student centers include [[West Virginia University]]'s [[Mountainlair]], the [[J. Wayne Reitz Union]] at the [[University of Florida]], the [[Bronco Student Center]] at [[California State Polytechnic University, Pomona|Cal Poly Pomona]], the [[McCormick Tribune Campus Center]] at the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]], and the [[Price Center]] at [[University of California, San Diego|UC San Diego]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Purpose==

Broadly speaking, the facility is devoted to student recreation and socialization.  A student center or student union is the community center of the college, serving students, faculty, staff, alumni, and guests. A student activity center might offer a variety of programs, activities, services, and facilities.&lt;ref name="Association of College Unions International"&gt;{{cite news|title=Association of College Unions International defines union|url=http://www.acui.org/content.aspx?menu_id=30&amp;id=296|accessdate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It may contain lounges, wellness centers, dining facilities or vendors, and entertainment venues. The student center is often the center of [[student affairs]] and activities and may house the offices of the student government or other student groups. It may also act as a small [[conference center]], with its meeting rooms rented out to student groups and local organizations holding conferences or competitions.

Depending on the school and its location it might have unique amenities such as a bowling alley, cultural or prayer rooms and unique services.

'''Subgoal labeling''' is giving a name to a group of steps, in a [[wikt:step-by-step|step-by-step]] description of a [[wikt:process|process]], to explain how the group of steps achieve a related [[subgoal]]. This concept is used in the fields of [[cognitive science]] and [[educational psychology]].

Lower-level steps of a [[Worked-example effect|worked example]] are grouped into a meaningful unit and labeled. This [[labeling]] helps learners identify the [[structural]] information from incidental information.&lt;ref name="improves performance and transfer in mobile app development learning"/&gt; [[Learning]] subgoals can reduce [[cognitive load]] when [[problem solving]] because the learner has fewer possible problem-solving steps to focus.&lt;ref name="improves performance and transfer in mobile app development learning"/&gt; Subgoal-labeled worked examples might provide learners with [[mental model]] frameworks. In a recent study, Learners who were given labels for subgoals used those labels when explaining how they solved a problem, suggesting that's how they mentally organized the information.&lt;ref name="improves performance and transfer in mobile app development learning"/&gt;

== Introduction ==
Generally problem solving adopts a very procedural approach. Problem solving in the areas of science, technology, engineering and mathematics ([[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]]) has been highly procedural. The best approach so far is to teach these procedures through instructional text accompanied by specific worked examples. The role of instructional text is to define and describe the problem solving procedures whereas how to apply these procedures is shown through worked examples.&lt;ref name="stem education"/&gt; Students can learn from step-by-step approach of worked examples which later can be helpful to them in solving similar problems on their own.&lt;ref name="improve K-12 teacher performance"/&gt; Novices, however, often find it difficult to distinguish domain specific information and the information specific to solving that problem, which increases their cognitive load.&lt;ref name="effects on transfer"/&gt; This cognitive load can be reduced by use of subgoal labeling which is achieved by grouping functionally-similar steps under a label that describes that function. This approach can be helpful to students to form a mental model of the domain related problem which later can guide them to solve different problems in that domain.&lt;ref name="effects on transfer"/&gt; Understanding the structure of worked example can help students identify the similarities between different problems thus encouraging self-explanation and learning.&lt;ref name="subgoal learning model"/&gt;

== Application ==
Subgoal labels have been used in worked examples to teach learners to solve problems in STEM domains &lt;ref name="stem education"/&gt;  Pairing subgoal labeled instructional text with subgoal labeled worked examples can further improve learners performance in problem solving in a computer-based learning environment (e.g. [[E learning|online learning]]) without personal interaction with an instructor.&lt;ref name="improve K-12 teacher performance"/&gt;&lt;ref name="effects on transfer"/&gt;  Subgoal labels can be used in different important areas such as teaching and learning novel problem solving, in training teachers to teach technical subjects (e.g. teaching computer programming), [[Multiagent|multi agent]] programming, professional development, online learning and other types of lifelong learning (e.g. Subgoal labeled instruction material helped novices to program in [[App Inventor for Android]]).&lt;ref name="improves performance and transfer in mobile app development learning"/&gt;&lt;ref name="improve K-12 teacher performance"/&gt;&lt;ref name="effects on transfer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="subgoal learning model"/&gt;&lt;ref name="multi agent problemsolving"/&gt;

The '''Universidade da Paz''' (UNPAZ) is a private undergraduate university in [[Dili]], [[East Timor]]

==Background==
UNPAZ was one of a [[List of universities in East Timor|number of universities]] that emerged after Timorese independence from Indonesia in 1999. It was founded after unresolved internal issues with UNDIL ([[Universidade Dili]]) in Masquerinhas. For its first few months it operated from temporary premises, before purchasing land to build a new campus southwest of the city centre.&lt;ref&gt;Coordinates:   8°33'54"S  125°32'52"E, shown [http://wikimapia.org/18656019/UNPAZ-Universidade-da-Paz here].&lt;/ref&gt; By 2005, most of the main campus buildings were established and several hundred students were attending classes, taught by returning expatriate and local Timorese. Most of the student body were participants in the struggle for Timorese independence, including ex-[[Falintil]] guerrillas, who had been denied a university education during the conflict before 1999.

The founding and present rector is Prof. Lucas da Costa, a Timorese economist, who also serves as a member of parliament for the [[Democratic Party (East Timor)|Partidu Demokratiku]] (PD). Former lecturers include Dr. Jacqueline Aquino Siapno (later of Seoul National University), the ex-wife of politician [[Fernando de Araújo (East Timorese politician)|Fernando `Lasama' de Araujo]], and environmental scientist [[Demetrio do Amaral de Carvalho]], the [http://www.goldmanprize.org/2004/islands 2004 Goldman Environmental Prize winner].

==Current status==
The university offers degrees in several disciplines, including social science, public health, engineering, and the sciences. Its faculties include Public Health, Engineering, and Agricultural Technology. It has over 150 Instructors, many on part-time contracts but few with doctorates, and 3,500 students.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://competence-program.asia/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Assessment-of-the-State-of-Science-Education-in-Timor-Leste.pdf Curt Gabrielson, Teresinha A Soares, Agustinho Ximenes. 2010. Assessment of the State of Science Education in Timor Leste.]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an outreach program to teach in East Timor's rural districts. Campus expansion and development is supported by grants from the European Commission.

UNPAZ faces challenges common to other Timorese universities. The university sector in the country was totally destroyed by violence in the late 1990s and is not yet fully rebuilt, meaning a lack of tertiary education resources and trained personnel. The language of instruction at UNPAZ varies and has been primarily Bahasa Indonesia. It has received some national and international financial assistance but relies largely on student fees. It is building up library resources, partly with international assistance. Internet connections were poor for several years.

A 2010 report on science education in East Timor notes the considerable lack of human and physical resources for teaching STEM subjects and that, at UNPAZ, laboratory facilities exist for each science subject but are not fully equipped.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

'''Vilnius University''' ({{lang-lt|Vilniaus universitetas}}; [[#Changes of the name|former names exist]]) is the [[List of oldest universities in continuous operation|oldest university]] in the [[Baltic states]] and one of the oldest in [[Northern Europe]]. It is the largest [[university]] in [[List of universities in Lithuania|Lithuania]].

The university was founded in 1579 as the [[Jesuit]] Academy (College) of Vilnius by [[Grand Duke of Lithuania]] and [[King of Poland]], [[Stephen Báthory]]. It was the third oldest university (after the [[Cracow Academy]] and the [[University of Königsberg|Albertina]]) in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. In the aftermath of the [[Third Partition of Poland]] (1795) and the [[November Uprising]] (1830–1831), the university was closed down and suspended its operation until 1919. In the [[aftermath of World War I]] the university saw failed attempts to restart it by [[Lithuania]] (December 1918) and invading [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] forces (March 1919). It finally resumed operations as Stefan Batory University in [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] (August 1919), a period followed by another [[Polish–Soviet War|Soviet occupation]] in 1920, and the less than two-years of the [[Republic of Central Lithuania]], [[Republic of Central Lithuania general election, 1922|incorporated]] into Poland in 1922.

Following [[Soviet invasion of Poland]] in September 1939, the university was briefly administered by the Lithuanian authorities (from October 1939), and then after [[Occupation and annexation of the Baltic states by the Soviet Union (1940)|Soviet annexation of Lithuania]] (June 1940), punctuated by a period of German occupation after [[German invasion of the Soviet Union]] (1941–1944), administrated as Vilnius State University by the [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. In 1945 the Polish community of [[student]]s and [[scholar]]s of Stefan Batory University was [[Polish population transfers (1944–1946)|transferred]] to [[Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dzieje nauki polskiej |last= Iłowiecki |first=Maciej |year=1981 |publisher=Wydawnictwo „Interpress” |location=Warszawa |page=241 |isbn=83-223-1876-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Lithuania regained its independence in 1990, following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], it resumed its status as one of the prominent universities in Lithuania.

The wide-ranging Vilnius University ensemble represents all major architectural styles that predominated in [[Lithuania]]: [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], [[Renaissance]], [[Baroque]] and [[Classicism]].

The university has been known by many names during its history. Due to its long history of Jewish, Polish and Russian influence or rule, the city portion of its name is rendered as Vilna ([[Latin language|Latin]]), Wilna ([[German language|German]]) or Wilno ([[Polish language|Polish]]), in addition to Lithuanian Vilnius (see [[History of Vilnius]]).

===History by period===

====Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth====
[[File:Bronze door of Vilnius University library.Lithuania.jpg|thumb|left|A bronze door at the Vilnius University Library commemorates the first [[Martynas Mažvydas|Lithuanian book]].]]
In 1568, the [[Lithuanian nobility]]&lt;ref name=Zin&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lietuvų kalbos istorija (Senųjų raštų kalba) |last=Zinkevičius |first=Zigmas |authorlink=Zigmas Zinkevičius |year=1988 |pages=159|publisher=Mintis |location=Vilnius |isbn=5-420-00102-0|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt; asked the [[Jesuits]] to create an institution of higher learning either in [[Vilnius]] or [[Kaunas]]. The following year [[Walerian Protasewicz]], the [[List of bishops of Vilnius|bishop of Vilnius]], purchased several buildings in the city center and established the Vilnian Academy (Almae Academia et Universitas Vilnensis Societatis Jesu). Initially, the academy had three divisions: [[trivium (education)|humanities]], [[philosophy]], and [[theology]]. The curriculum at the college and later at the academy was taught in [[Latin language|Latin]].&lt;ref name=Zin2&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lietuvų kalbos istorija (Senųjų raštų kalba) |last=Zinkevičius |first=Zigmas |authorlink=Zigmas Zinkevičius |year=1988 |pages=160|publisher=Mintis |location=Vilnius |isbn=5-420-00102-0|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="O'Connor2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kevin O'Connor|title=Culture and customs of the Baltic states |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Dl2i1Fkd_cC&amp;pg=PA81|accessdate=10 March 2011 |year=2006 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-33125-1|pages=81–}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of the 17th century there are records about special groups that taught [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]-speaking students Latin, most probably using [[Konstantinas Sirvydas]]' compiled dictionary.&lt;ref name=Zin3&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lietuvų kalbos istorija (Senųjų raštų kalba) |last=Zinkevičius |first=Zigmas |authorlink=Zigmas Zinkevičius |year=1988 |pages=161|publisher=Mintis |location=Vilnius |isbn=5-420-00102-0|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first students were enrolled into the Academy in 1570. A library at the college was established in the same year, and [[Sigismund II Augustus]] donated 2500 books to the new college.&lt;ref name=Zin/&gt; In its first year of existence the college enrolled 160 students.&lt;ref name=Zin/&gt;

On April 1, 1579, [[Stefan Batory]] [[King of Poland]] and [[Grand Duke of Lithuania]], upgraded the academy and granted it equal status with the [[Jagiellonian University|Kraków Academy]], creating the Alma Academia et Universitas Vilnensis Societatis Iesu. His edict was approved by [[Pope]] [[Gregory XIII]]'s [[Papal bull|bull]] of October 30, 1579. The first [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the Academy was [[Piotr Skarga]]. He invited many scientists from various parts of Europe and expanded the library, with the sponsorship of many notable persons: [[Sigismund II Augustus]], Bishop [[Walerian Protasewicz]], and [[Kazimierz Lew Sapieha]]. Lithuanians at the time comprised about one third of the students (in 1568 there were circa 700 students), others were [[Germans]], [[Poles]], [[Swedish people|Swedes]], and even [[Hungarians]].&lt;ref name=Zin/&gt;

[[File:Vilnius University Great Courtyard 2, Vilnius, Lithuania - Diliff.jpg|thumb|right|The Grand Courtyard of Vilnius University and [[Church of St. Johns, Vilnius|Church of St. Johns]].]]

In 1575, Duke [[Mikołaj Krzysztof Radziwiłł]] and [[Elżbieta Ogińska]] sponsored a printing house for the academy, one of the first in the region. The printing house issued books in [[Latin]] and [[Polish language|Polish]] and the first surviving book in [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] printed in the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] was in 1595. It was ''Kathechismas, arba Mokslas kiekvienam krikščioniui privalus'' authored by [[Mikalojus Daukša]].

The academy's growth continued until the 17th century. The following era, known as [[The Deluge (history)|The Deluge]], led to a dramatic drop in the number of students who matriculated and in the quality of its programs. In the middle of the 18th century, education authorities tried to restore the academy. This led to the foundation of the first [[observatory]] in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] (the fourth such professional  facility in Europe), in 1753, by [[Tomasz Żebrowski]]. The [[Commission of National Education]] ({{lang-pl|Komisja Edukacji Narodowej}}), the world's first ministry of education, took control of the academy in 1773, and transformed it into a modern [[University]]. The language of instruction (as everywhere in the commonwealth's higher education institutions) changed from [[Latin]] to [[Polish language|Polish]].&lt;ref name="Lerski1996 2"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jerzy Jan Lerski|title=Historical dictionary of Poland, 966-1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QTUTqE2difgC&amp;pg=PA74|accessdate=10 March 2011|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-313-26007-0|pages=74–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cornis-PopeNeubauer2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marcel Cornis-Pope|author2=John Neubauer|title=History of the literary cultures of East-Central Europe: junctures and disjunctures in the 19th and 20th centuries |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5pAwqsSyTlsC&amp;pg=PA19|accessdate=10 March 2011|date=13 September 2006|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|isbn=978-90-272-3453-7|pages=19–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TapperPalfreyman2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ted Tapper|author2=David Palfreyman |title=Understanding mass higher education: comparative perspectives on access|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hd4FT_l2GDYC&amp;pg=PA141|accessdate=10 March 2011|date=23 December 2004|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-35491-2|pages=141–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks to the [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the academy, [[Marcin Poczobutt-Odlanicki]], the academy was granted the status of "Principal School" ({{lang-pl|Szkoła Główna}}) in 1783. The commission, the secular authority governing the academy after the dissolution of the [[Jesuit]] order, drew up a new statute. The school was named Academia et Universitas Vilnensis.

====Partitions====
After the [[Partitions of Poland|Partitions of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], [[Vilnius]] was annexed by the [[Russian Empire]]. However, the Commission of National Education retained control over the academy until 1803, when Tsar [[Alexander I of Russia]] accepted the new statute and renamed it The Imperial University of Vilna (Императорскiй Виленскiй Университетъ). The institution was granted the rights to the administration of all education facilities in the former [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. Among the notable personae were the curator (governor) [[Adam Jerzy Czartoryski]] and rector [[Jan Śniadecki]].

[[File:Vilnius University, Lithuania, Sept. 2008.jpg|thumb|left|[[Vilnius University Library]] Courtyard]]

The university flourished. It used Polish as the instructional language, although [[Russian language|Russian]] was added to the curriculum.&lt;ref name="O'Connor2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wandycz1974"&gt;{{cite book|author=Piotr Stefan Wandycz|title=The lands of partitioned Poland, 1795-1918|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TVMmGKsbWJ4C&amp;pg=PA95|accessdate=9 March 2011|year=1974|publisher=University of Washington Press|isbn=978-0-295-95358-8|pages=95–}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became known for its studies of [[Belarusian culture|Belarusian]] and [[Lithuanian culture]].&lt;ref name="Wandycz1974"/&gt; By 1823, it was one of the largest in Europe; the student population exceeded that of the [[Oxford University]]. A number of students, among them poet [[Adam Mickiewicz]], were arrested in 1823 for [[conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] against the tsar (membership in [[Filomaci]]). In 1832, after the [[November Uprising]], the university was closed by Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia]].

Two of the faculties were turned into separate schools: the Medical and Surgical Academy (''Akademia Medyko-Chirurgiczna'') and the Roman Catholic Academy (''Rzymsko-Katolicka Akademia Duchowna''). But soon they were closed as well with Medical and Surgical Academy transformed into Medical faculty of [[University of Kiev]] (now [[Bogomolets National Medical University]]), and latter one being transformed into [[Saint Petersburg Roman Catholic Theological Academy]] (after the October Revolution of 1917 moved to Poland where it became [[John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin|Catholic University of Lublin]]). The repression that followed the failed uprising included banning the [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Lithuanian language]]s; all education in those languages was halted.

====1918-1939====
Lithuania declared its independence in February 1918. The university, with the rest of Vilnius and Lithuania, was opened three times between 1918 and 1919. The Lithuanian National Council re-established it in December 1918, with classes to start on January 1, 1919. [[Soviet westward offensive of 1918–1919|An invasion]] by the [[Red Army]] interrupted this plan. A Lithuanian communist, [[Vincas Kapsukas-Mickevičius]], then sponsored a plan to re-open it as "Labor University" in March 1919 in the short-lived [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic (1918–1919)|Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic]] (later, [[Lithuanian–Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]]), but the city was [[Vilna offensive|taken by Poland]] in April 1919. Marshall [[Józef Piłsudski]] reopened it as [[Stefan Batory]] University (''Uniwersytet Stefana Batorego'') on August 28, 1919. The city would fall to the Soviets again in 1920, who transferred it to the Lithuanian state after their defeat in the [[battle of Warsaw (1920)|battle of Warsaw]]. Finally, in the aftermath of the [[Żeligowski's Mutiny]] and [[Republic of Central Lithuania general election, 1922]], the [[Vilnius Region]] was subsequently annexed by Poland. In response to the dispute over the region, many Lithuanian scholars moved to [[Vytautas Magnus University]] in [[Kaunas]], the interwar capital.&lt;ref name=venclova&gt;{{Cite book|title=FOUR CENTURIES OF ENLIGHTENMENT: A Historic View of the University of Vilnius, 1579-1979|author=[[Tomas Venclova]]|url=http://www.lituanus.org/1981_2/81_2_01.htm |date=Summer 1981 |publisher=[[Lituanus]]|accessdate=2009-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:VU bibliotekos Smuglevičiaus salė.JPG|thumb|P. Smuglevičius hall in the [[Vilnius University Library]].]]

The university quickly recovered and gained international prestige, largely because of the presence of notable scientists such as [[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], [[Marian Zdziechowski]], and [[Henryk Niewodniczański]]. Among the students of the university at that time was future [[Nobel prize]] winner [[Czesław Miłosz]]. The university  grew quickly, thanks to government grants and private donations. Its library contained 600,000 volumes, including historic and cartographic items which are still in its possession.&lt;ref name=venclova/&gt;

In 1938 the university had:
* 7 institutes
* 123 professors
* 104 scientific units (including two hospitals)
* 3110 students

The university's international students included 212 [[Russians]], 94 [[Belarusians]], 85 [[Lithuanians]], 28 [[Ukrainians]] and 13 [[Germans]]. Anti-Semitism increased during the 1930s and a system of [[ghetto benches]], in which Jewish students were required to sit in separate areas, was instituted at the university.&lt;ref name=melz&gt;{{cite book|author=Emanuel Melzer|title=No way out: the politics of Polish Jewry, 1935-1939|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=co3KJikOaBYC&amp;pg=PA75|accessdate=10 March 2011|year=1997|publisher=Hebrew Union College Press|isbn=978-0-87820-418-2|pages=74–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Violence erupted; the university was closed for two weeks during January 1937.&lt;ref name=melz/&gt; In February Jewish students were denied entrance to its grounds.&lt;ref name=melz/&gt; The faculty was then authorized to decide on an individual basis whether the segregation should be observed in their classrooms and expel those students who would not comply.&lt;ref name=melz/&gt; 54 Jewish students were expelled but were allowed to return the next day under a compromise in which in addition to Jewish students, Lithuanian, Belarusian, and "Polish democratic" students were to be seated separately.&lt;ref name=melz/&gt; Rector of the university, [[Władysław Marian Jakowicki]], resigned his position in protest over the introduction of the ghetto benches.&lt;ref name="Hass1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ludwik Hass |title=Wolnomularze polscy w kraju i na śwíecíe 1821-1999: słownik biograficzny |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r9wqAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=11 March 2011 |year=1999 |publisher=Rytm|isbn=978-83-87893-52-1|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====World War II====
Following the [[invasion of Poland]] the university continued its operations. The city was soon [[Soviet invasion of Poland|occupied by the Soviet Union]]. Most of the professors returned after the hostilities ended, and the faculties reopened on October 1, 1939. On October 28, [[Vilnius]] was transferred to [[Lithuania]] which considered the previous eighteen years as an occupation by Poland of its capital.&lt;ref name=End&gt;D. Trenin. The End of Eurasia: Russia on the Border Between Geopolitics and Globalization. 2002, p.164&lt;/ref&gt; The university was closed on December 15, 1939 by the authorities of the Republic of Lithuania.&lt;ref name="LiekisLiekis2010"/&gt; All the faculty, staff, and its approximately 3,000 students dismissed.&lt;ref name=aradzik/&gt; Students were ordered to leave the dormitories; 600 ended in a refugee camp.&lt;ref name="LiekisLiekis2010"/&gt; Professors had to leave their university flats. Following the [[Lithuanization]] policies, in its place a new university, named Vilniaus universitetas, was created. Its faculty came from the [[Kaunas University]].&lt;ref name="LiekisLiekis2010"/&gt; The new charter specified that Vilnius University was to be governed according to the statute of the [[Vytautas Magnus University]] of [[Kaunas]], and that [[Lithuanian language]] programs and faculties would be established. Lithuanian was named as the official language of the university.&lt;ref name="LiekisLiekis2010"/&gt; A new academic term started on 22 January; only 13 of the new students had former Polish citizenship.&lt;ref name="LiekisLiekis2010"/&gt;

Polish Law and Social Sciences, Humanities, Medical, Theological, Mathematical-Life sciences faculties continued to [[Education in Poland during World War II|work underground]] with lectures and exams held in private flats until 1944.&lt;ref name=tarkowski&gt;{{pl icon}} Mikołaj Tarkowski, [http://vebba.pl/ug/wp-content/mikolaj-tarkowski-usb.pdf Wydział Prawa i Nauk Społecznych Uniwersytetu Stefana Batorego w Wilnie 1919-1939, - przyczynek do dziejów szkolnictwa wyższego w dwudziestoleciu międzywojennym] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227040642/http://vebba.pl/ug/wp-content/mikolaj-tarkowski-usb.pdf |date=2008-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Polish professors who took part in the underground courses included [[Iwo Jaworski]], [[Kazimierz Petrusewicz]] and [[Bronisław Wróblewski]].&lt;ref name=tarkowski/&gt; The diplomas of the underground universities were accepted by many [[Poland|Polish]] universities after the war. Soon after the [[Soviet occupation of Baltic states|annexation of Lithuania]] by the Soviet Union, while some Polish professors were allowed to resume teaching, many others (along with some Lithuanian professors) who were deemed "[[reactionary]]" were arrested and sent to prisons and [[gulag]]s in Russia and [[Kazakhstan]]. Between September 1939 and July 1941, the Soviets arrested and deported nineteen Polish faculty and ex-faculty of the University of Stefan Batory, of who nine perished: Professors [[Stanisław Cywinski]], [[Władysław Marian Jakowicki]], [[Jan Kempisty]], [[Józef Marcinkiewicz]], [[Tadeusz Kolaczyński]], [[Piotr Oficjalski]], [[Włodzimierz Godłowski]], [[Konstanty Pietkiewicz]], and [[Konstanty Sokol-Sokolowski]], the last five victims of the [[Katyn massacre]].&lt;ref name=aradzik&gt;Adam Redzik, [http://www.gomezurdanez.com/polonia/adamredzikpolishuniversitas.pdf Polish Universities During the Second World War], ''Encuentros de Historia Comparada Hispano-Polaca / Spotkania poświęcone historii porównawczej hiszpańsko-polskiej'' conference, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The city was occupied by Germany in 1941, and all institutions of higher education for Poles were closed. From 1940 until September 1944, under Lithuanian professor and activist [[Mykolas Biržiška]], the University of Vilnius was open for Lithuanian students under supervision of the German occupation authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vu.lt/site_files/InfS/Leidiniai/Vilnius_University_1579_2004.pdf History]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, many of Polish students took part in [[Operation Ostra Brama]]. The majority of them were later arrested by the [[NKVD]] and suffered repressions from their participation in the [[Armia Krajowa]] resistance.

====Soviet period (1945-1990)====
[[File:2011 0825 Vilnius 55.jpg|thumb|Petras Repšys’ fresco "The Seasons of the Year" (painted in 1976-1984) with motifs from [[Baltic mythology]] at the Centre of Lithuanian Studies.]]

Educated Poles were transferred to [[People's Republic of Poland]] after World War II under the guidance of [[State Repatriation Office]]. As the result many of former students and professors of Stefan Batory joined universities in Poland. To keep contact with each other, the professors decided to transfer whole faculties. After 1945, most of the mathematicians, humanists and biologists joined the [[Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń]], while a number of the medical faculty formed the core of the newly founded [[Medical University of Gdańsk]]. The [[Toruń]] university is often considered to be the successor to the Polish traditions of the Stefan Batory University.

In 1955&lt;ref name="Hist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.countries.ru/index.cgi?pid=1397|title=Страны мира|publisher=Countries|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the University was named after [[Vincas Kapsukas]]. After it had been awarded the [[Order of the Red Banner of Labour]] in 1971 and the [[Order of Friendship of Peoples]] in 1979, its full name until 1990 was Vilnius Order of the Red Banner of Labour and Order of Friendship of Peoples V. Kapsukas State University.&lt;ref name="Hist"/&gt; Though restrained by the Soviet system, Vilnius University grew and gained significance and developed its own, Lithuanian identity. Vilnius University began to free itself from Soviet ideology in 1988, thanks to the policy of [[glasnost]].

====After 1990====

On March 11, 1990, [[Lithuania]] declared independence, and the university regained autonomy. Since 1991, Vilnius University has been a signatory to the [[Magna Charta of the European Universities]]. It is a member of the [[European University Association]] (EUA) and the [[Conference of Baltic University Rectors]].

=== Research ===
[[File:VU TSPMI.jpg|350px|thumbnail]]
In cooperation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Military Academy and other partners, IIRPS conducts research in the area of domestic policy, governance, international relations, foreign policy and diplomacy of both Lithuania and other countries. The Institute organizes international annual conferences and guest lectures. Recently, IIRPS has taken part in co-hosting Baltic Development Forum, which included such prominent guests as President of EC [[Jose Manuel Barroso]], Deputy Director of WTO [[Rufus H. Yerxa]]. Institute's guests included such figures as NATO General Secretary [[A. F. Rasmussen]] and OSCE Secretary General [[Marc Perrin de Brichambaut]].

==== Projects ====
Some of the projects the Institute has successfully participated in:
*'''Russia and the Wider East Central Europe: A Fundamentally Transformed Relationship'''. The overall goal of the project is to facilitate dialogue and mutual understanding between Russia and East Central European (ECE) countries in addressing bilateral and regional issues of common interest and concern. The project applies an extended rather than a narrow definition of the region and seeks to address relations of Russia with the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. IIRPS was given a grant by the [[Friedrich Ebert Foundation]].
*'''Russia's search for identity and political practice, 1990-2010'''. The goal of the project is to analyse the variety and rivalry of identity discourses in the new Russian state in 1990–2010 and to reveal how this constant conceptualization is manifesting itself through political practices and contributes to the formation of the contemporary politics. Instead of unitary depiction of Russia (e.g. as “new empire”, “post-totalitarian state”) the project seeks to demonstrate how different actors participate in the process of Russia's identity representation and how different ways and means are used in creating these representations, thus showing the inconsistencies, breaks and variety of the newly created and modified identity discourses.The discourses of the government (power) and specialised/expert discourses which have certain relationship to power or are cooperating with it (media, the community of historians, cinema, academic, legal discourses) are analysed.

==== Publications ====
Apart from scientific papers prepared by IIRPS VU scientists the Institute issues periodicals wherein results of scientific research are published.
*“Politologija”. The quarterly journal devoted to political science published since 1999.
*[[Lithuanian Annual Strategic Review]]. Published in cooperation with the Lithuanian  Military Academy of General Jonas Žemaitis. The goal of the paper is a complex and permanent analysis and summation of the essential changes taking place on the international, systemic, regional and national planes, which are important to the Lithuanian national security.
*[[Lithuanian Foreign Policy Review]]. Published in English in cooperation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Lithuania in English since 1998.
*[[Lithuanian Political Science Yearbook]]. IIRPS VU issues the yearbook of Lithuanian political science wherein articles of Lithuanian politologists devoted to the policy theory, public administration, international policy and other topics are published.
*Post Scriptum. Newspaper “Post Scriptum” issued by the IIRPS VU student corporation “RePublica” twice a year wherein students make an attempt to go deeper into important public phenomena, try to assess various social processes in an analytical way, seek the meeting grounds for the attitude towards the underlying problems shaped by different academic subjects.

The essay became the basis for a successful [[spoken word]] song released in 1999 by [[Baz Luhrmann]], "'''Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen)'''", also known as "'''The Sunscreen Song'''".&lt;ref name="Sunscreen Song"&gt;"The Sunscreen Song (class of '99)" is used as an alternative title on [[:File:Everybody'sfreetowearsunscreen.jpg|the cover of the single]]; see also [https://www.amazon.com/Everybodys-Free-Quindon-Tarver/dp/B00000JHTT#productDescription the single's "Editorial Reviews" on Amazon], and [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/features/daily/march99/sunscreen0318.htm "The Cyber-Saga of the 'Sunscreen' Song"] by the ''Washington Post''.&lt;/ref&gt; The song inspired numerous [[Parody|parodies]].

==''Chicago Tribune'' column==
[[Mary Schmich]]'s [[Column (periodical)|column]] "Advice, like youth, probably just wasted on the young" was published in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' on June 1, 1997.&lt;ref name="Original Chicago Tribune article"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/columnists/chi-schmich-sunscreen-column,0,4054576.column |title=Original published article |publisher=Chicago Tribune |author=Mary Schmich |date=1997-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the column's introduction Schmich presents the essay as the [[commencement speech]] she would give if she were asked to give one.

In the speech she insistently recommends the wearing of [[sunscreen]], and dispenses other advice and warnings which are intended to help people live a happier life and avoid common frustrations. She later explained that the initial inspiration for what advice to offer came from seeing a young woman [[sunbathing]], and hoping that she was wearing sunscreen, unlike what she herself did at that age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/features/daily/march99/sunscreen0318.htm |title=The Cyber-Saga of the 'Sunscreen' Song |publisher=Washington Post |author=Frank Ahrens |date=1999-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The essay soon became the subject of an [[urban legend]] which claimed it was an [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] commencement speech given by author [[Kurt Vonnegut]]. In reality, MIT's commencement speaker in 1997 was [[Kofi Annan]] and Vonnegut had never been a commencement speaker there.&lt;ref name="nytimes-vonnegut-quote" /&gt; Despite a follow-up article by Schmich on August 3, 1997,&lt;ref name="Follow-up Chicago Tribune article"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-08-03/news/9708030176_1_mr-vonnegut-sunscreen-speech-speech-one-friday-afternoon |title=Follow-up article |publisher=Chicago Tribune |author=Mary Schmich |date=1997-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; the story became so widespread that Vonnegut's lawyer began receiving requests to reprint the speech.&lt;ref name="nytimes-vonnegut-quote" /&gt; Vonnegut commented that he would have been proud had the words been his.&lt;ref name="nytimes-vonnegut-quote"&gt;{{Citation | last=Fisher | first=Ian | title=It's All the Talk of the Internet's Gossip Underground | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=1997-08-06 | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F04E2D71F3DF935A3575BC0A961958260&amp;sec=technology&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schmich published a short gift book adaptation of the essay, ''Wear Sunscreen: A Primer for Real Life'', in 1998. A tenth anniversary edition was published in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The essay was used in its entirety by Australian film director [[Baz Luhrmann]] on his 1998 album ''[[Something for Everybody (Baz Luhrmann album)|Something for Everybody]]'', as "Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen)". It was released in some territories in 1997, with the speech (including its opening words, "Ladies and Gentlemen of the Class of '97") completely intact. This version appeared in the [[Triple J Hottest 100]] of that year at number 16 in the countdown, and was released on the [[Triple J Hottest 100, 1997|subsequent CD]] in early 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/hottest100_08/history/1997.htm|title=history - triple j hottest 100 - 2008 - triple j|date=26 December 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also known as "The Sunscreen Song",&lt;ref name="Sunscreen Song" /&gt; it sampled Luhrmann's remixed version of the song "[[Everybody's Free (To Feel Good)]]" by [[Rozalla]], and opened with the words, "Ladies and Gentlemen of the Class of '99" (instead of "'97", as in the original column). It was later released as a [[Single (music)|single]] in 1999.

Luhrmann explained that Anton Monsted, [[Puretone|Josh Abrahams]], and he were working on the remix when Monsted received an email with the supposed Vonnegut speech. They decided to use it but were doubtful of getting through to Vonnegut for permission before their deadline, which was only one or two days away. While searching the Internet for contact information they came upon the "Sunscreen" authorship controversy and discovered that Schmich was the actual author. They emailed her and, with her permission, recorded the song the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hollywoodandvine.com/bazluhrmann/main.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20021205041240/http://hollywoodandvine.com/bazluhrmann/main.html |title=Something for Everybody |publisher=Something for Everybody |date=2002-12-05 | archivedate = 2002-12-05 |accessdate=2009-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song features a spoken-word track set over a mellow backing track. The "Wear Sunscreen" speech is narrated by Australian voice actor [[Lee Perry (voice actor)|Lee Perry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imdb.com/name/nm1043022/ |title=Lee Perry (I) |publisher=Imdb.com |date=1959-12-16 |accessdate=2009-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The backing is the choral version of "Everybody's Free (To Feel Good)", a 1991 song by [[Rozalla]], used in Luhrmann's film ''[[William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet]]''. The chorus, also from "Everybody's Free", is sung by [[Quindon Tarver]].

The song was a top ten hit across Europe, but largely obscure in the US until Aaron Scofield, a producer in Phoenix, Arizona, edited the original 12" version into a segment of a syndicated radio show called ''Modern Mix''. This show played on many stations in the United States. In Portland, Oregon—where ''Modern Mix'' played on KNRK—listeners began requesting the track. KNRK program director Mark Hamilton edited the song for time and began playing it regularly. He distributed the song to other program directors that he networked with and the song exploded in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SQ0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA84 |title=Baz Luhrmann Goes to the Top of the Class By Applying His Sunscreen |publisher=Billboard Magazine |date=1999-04-03| accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song reached number 24 on the [[Billboard Hot 100 Airplay]] in the United States; by the time it was released as a commercial single in the country, radio airplay had declined significantly, and only managed to peak at number 45 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]]. It also peaked at number one in the United Kingdom and Ireland, partly due to a media campaign by [[BBC Radio 1|Radio&amp;nbsp;One]] DJ [[Chris Moyles]].

There are four versions of the song: the original 7:09 minute mix from the album ''Baz Luhrmann Presents: Something for Everybody''; a 1999 single release which features a 5:05 minute edit that lacks both choruses; "Geographic's Factor 15+ Mix" that runs for 4:42 minutes; and a "2007 Mix" of the original 7:09 minute version released on the 10th Anniversary Edition of the ''William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet'' soundtrack on which the opening words are changed to "Ladies and gentlemen of the class of 2007".

There are two videos for the song: one which uses the 1999 5:05 minute single edit of the song (the version in which [[Quindon Tarver]] is not featured), directed and animated by [[Bill Barminski]]; and another using the 7:09 minute edit made by the Brazilian advertising agency DM9DDB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfq_A8nXMsQ|title=Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen) Bill Barminski's version|publisher=youtube|date=2007-05-24|accessdate=2010-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfq_A8nXMsQ|title=Everybody's Free to Wear Sunscreen!

The song also appeared in Germany and was soon followed by a German version with the title "Sonnencreme".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunscreen.de/ | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20010122045300/http://www.sunscreen.de/ |title=everybody's free (to wear sunscreen) |publisher=Brainfusion |date=2001-01-22 | archivedate = 2001-01-22 |accessdate=2009-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German translation is narrated by the German actor Dieter Brandecker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004WPV2 |title=Sonnencreme (Everybody's...)

A Russian adaptation of the song, recorded live by [[Silver Rain Radio]], was performed by Alex Dubas and Yolka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alex-dubas.livejournal.com/90854.html |script-title=ru:О пользе солнцезащитных кремов |language=Russian |publisher=Blog of Alex Dubas |date=2009-12-20 |accessdate=2011-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811075358/http://alex-dubas.livejournal.com/90854.html |archivedate=2011-08-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 10, 2008 the song re-entered the [[UK Singles Chart]] at number 72.

This version was released as a remix to Baz Luhrmann's 1999 version.  The remix was written by Mau Kilauea and dubbed as a "Tropical Remix" because of the choice of instrumentation.  The song was posted to Soundcloud on Mau Kilauea's page and reposted by Spinnin' Records.  The song became a first hit for Mau Kilauea.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==Parodies==
The Baz Luhrmann song version inspired numerous [[Parody|parodies]]. [[John Safran]] released a song entitled "Not the Sunscreen Song" which peaked at #20 in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Steffen Hung |url=http://www.australian-charts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=John+Safran&amp;titel=Not+The+Sunscreen+Song&amp;cat=s |title=John Safran - Not The Sunscreen Song |publisher=australian-charts.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American comedian [[Chris Rock]] enjoyed great success with his spoken word song "[[No Sex (In the Champagne Room)]]" which was in turn parodied on ''[[Mad TV]]'' as "Ain't No Blacks on the TV Screen" in the style of Rock's stand-up. The song was also parodied in an episode of ''[[Disney's House of Mouse]]'' performed by [[Jiminy Cricket]]. The comedy group [[Three Dead Trolls in a Baggie]] also made a parody entitled "The Sunscreen Marketing Board". [[Jegsy Dodd]] and the Original Sinners' version, "Grumpy Old Men", was voted favourite track of 2005 by BBC Radio&amp;nbsp;1 listeners in their annual [[Festive&amp;nbsp;50]] poll.

[[Angelos Epithemiou]]'s live tour included a parody of the song titled "Don't Muck About".

A parody entitled "Mow Against The Grain" appears on the [[King of the Hill (soundtrack)|''King of the Hill'' soundtrack album]].

Another parody by comedian Simmi Areff was played on South African radio station [[East Coast Radio (South Africa)|East Coast Radio]] at the conclusion of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]].

Another parody was created in 1999 by London Capital Radio Breakfast Show host Chris Tarrant, who created a version called "wear slippers" which consisted of him reading an alternative version of the sunscreen lyrics and demonstrated his disdain for Baz Luhrmann's version.

      <comment>Changed instance of World Champion of Public Speaking to World Championship of Public Speaking, as this is the correct and official title. Working on moving the page to World Championship of Public Speaking, as the current page title is inaccurate. Also deleted a sentence that stated this contest is referred to by various alternate titles and listed World Championship of Publish Speaking as one of those titles. This was wrong, as World Championship of Public Speaking is the only correct title.</comment>

==Impact==
According to [[CNN]], the contest grew as individuals and corporations worldwide encouraged employees to improve their skill at public speaking.&lt;ref name="BlakeHow"/&gt;

Winners and finalists "snag lucrative gigs on the corporate speaking circuit," becoming full-time professional speakers, speaking coaches, and paid speaking consultants, and they sell books and DVDs to fans.&lt;ref name="BlakeHow"/&gt;
