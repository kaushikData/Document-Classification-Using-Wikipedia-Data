'''Adam Charles Roberts''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FRSL}} (born 30 June 1965)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://authorities.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;PAGE=First |title=Roberts, Adam (Adam Charles) |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] Authorities |accessdate= 13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[British people|British]] science fiction and fantasy novelist. In 2018 he was elected Vice-President of the [[H.G. Wells Society]].

==Career==
He has a [[academic degree|degree]] in [[English studies|English]] from the [[University of Aberdeen]] and a PhD from [[Cambridge University]] on [[Robert Browning]] and the Classics. He teaches [[English literature]] and [[creative writing]] at [[Royal Holloway, University of London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/profile/adam-roberts |title=Adam Roberts |publisher=The Guardian |date=2012-06-20 |accessdate=2015-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adam Roberts has been nominated three times for the [[Arthur C. Clarke Award]]: in 2001 for his [[debut novel]], ''[[Salt (novel)|Salt]]'', in 2007 for ''[[Gradisil]]'' and in 2010 for ''[[Yellow Blue Tibia]]''. He won both the 2012 [[BSFA Award for Best Novel]], and the [[John W. Campbell Memorial Award]], for ''Jack Glass''. It was further shortlisted for [[The Kitschies]] Red Tentacle award. His short story "Tollund" was nominated for the 2014 [[Sidewise Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.locusmag.com/News/2014/06/2014-sidewise-award-finalists/ |title=2014 Sidewise Award Finalists |publisher=Locus|date=2014-06-06 |accessdate=2014-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roberts' science fiction has been praised by many critics both inside and outside the genre, with some of the latter going so far as to describe him as being on a par with such past masters of the genre as Pel Torro, John E. Muller, and Karl Zeigfreid.

In May 2014, Roberts gave the second annual [[Tolkien Lecture]] at [[Pembroke College, Oxford]], speaking on the topic of Tolkien and Women.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tolkienlecture.org/2014/05/14/adam-roberts-lecture-podcast-now-available/ Adam Roberts Lecture Podcast Now Available], ''The J.R.R.

'''Apidya''' (titled {{nihongo|'''Abidja'''|アビヂャ}} in Japanese characters below the title) is a [[Shoot 'em up#Scrolling shooters|horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up]] video game developed by [[Kaiko GmbH|Kaiko]] and released by [[Play Byte]] in 1992 for the [[Amiga]]. It was Kaiko's second game developed. Despite being labelled II in the title it is not a sequel to any game, but has the digits placed there simply for a gag. &lt;ref name="Kaiko Interview"&gt;{{cite interview |title=Interview|first=Chris|last=Huelsbeck|interviewer=T.R.

==Plot==
The story revolves around Ikuro, whose wife Yuri has been poisoned by Hexaae, an evil lord of black magic. Ikuro uses magic to transform into a deadly [[bee]] and vows to find an antidote for Yuri and wreak revenge on Hexaae.

==Gameplay==
The game is a horizontally scrolling shooter, with some elements similar to early, classic shoot 'em ups. The player controls a bee capable of launching a number of projectiles which can damage or destroy enemy targets. The game uses the power-up bar system pioneered by ''[[Gradius]]''. Destroyed enemies sometimes leave a power-up in the form of a red-and-yellow flower. The player may collect these flowers and activate new weapons and enhancements. A 'build-up' weapon, similar to the 'beam' weapon in ''[[R-Type]]'', also features. If the fire button is held down for a second or two, the bee produces a hissing noise and releasing the fire button will then cause the bee to fire a large, organic projectile (a giant bee sting) which can wipe out waves of small enemies, or damage larger ones. If the player's bee is hit by enemy fire or crashes into the terrain, a life will be lost and the current stage is restarted except for the end bosses of the first 3 stages, that will continue till all lives are lost. Once all lives are lost the game ends. A co-operative two-player mode is possible, in which the second player controls a smaller companion drone, which can launch small projectiles and shield the first player. The drone can sustain 5 small projectiles per life but won't survive large projectiles or collisions and the stage doesn't reset if it dies, the large bee is the alpha which must survive to advance. The alpha bee dying resets the stage as with normal play minus end stage bosses for the first 3 stages.
An alternating two player mode is also possible.

The game consists of five themed levels: a meadow, a pond, a sewer filled with mutated enemies, a bio-technological machine and a final level where the player must battle five final bosses. The final level offers plenty of points for slain enemies, offering a semi status quo for players as they will recover some lost lives from restarting the level.
Each level is divided up into a number of stages (usually three where the last is the end boss, that doesn't reset upon losing a life only on credit). There are also a number of hidden bonus levels. In the first two levels, nearly all the enemies are real creatures which may be found in a meadow or pond. The later levels feature mutant and inorganic creations. During "Techno Party", the bee morphs into a more mechanized form for the duration of that level. The first boss is unique, it cannot be harmed so the player must survive till it vacates the game.
There are four difficultly settings. When the difficulty is set to "easy", it is not possible to play the last level, the ending sequence is skipped and the player is directed straight to the end credits.

==Music==
The musical soundtrack to the game was composed by game musician [[Chris Hülsbeck]]. A high-quality arrangement of the soundtrack was released as a CD album in 1992. The soundtrack of level 4 features several samples from [[L.A. Style]]'s ''[[James Brown Is Dead]]''.

There have also been live performances of the game's music:{{cn|date=July 2015}}

* An Apidya suite was performed live by a full symphonic orchestra in 2003 at the [[Symphonic Game Music Concert]]-series in Leipzig, Germany.
* Music from Apidya was part of the 2006 PLAY! A [[Video Game Symphony]] concert in Stockholm, Sweden.
* Music from Apidya (as well as many of Hülsbeck's other works) was played by a symphonic orchestra at the Symphonic Shades concert in 2008.

==Reception==
The game was largely praised as a fine example of the shoot 'em up genre. [[Amiga Power]] magazine described the game as offering "more playability than any other shoot 'em up" and awarded the game 89% in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ramshaw |first1=Mark |title=none |journal=[[Amiga Power]] |volume= |issue=13 |pages=64–65 |publisher=Future Publishing |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amiga Format]] magazine awarded the game 90%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Leach |first1=James |title=none |journal=[[Amiga Format]] |volume= |issue=35 |pages=83 |publisher=Future Publishing |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
An unofficial [[Game Boy Advance|GBA]] Apidya technical demo followed years later{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} and an unofficial Windows [[Video game remake|remake]] of the first level was released in 2002&lt;ref&gt;[http://apidya.vg-network.com/ Apidya 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; but neither was ever completed.

'''Ball culture''', the '''house system''', the '''ballroom community''' and similar terms describe an underground [[LGBT]] [[subculture]] in the United States in which people "walk" (i.e., compete) for [[Trophy|trophies]] and prizes at events known as balls. Some who walk also dance; others compete in [[Drag (clothing)|drag]] categories, designed to emulate other genders and social classes. Most participants in ball culture belong to groups known as "houses".&lt;ref name="HIV/AIDS risk reduction strategies for"&gt;{{cite web|last=Podhurst |first=L. |author2=Credle J. |title=HIV/AIDS risk reduction strategies for Gay youth of color in the "house" community.

Houses serve as alternative families, primarily consisting of Black and Latino [[gay]], [[Gender variance|gender nonconforming]] and [[transgender]] youth, and are meant to be [[safe space]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.standardhotels.com/culture/a-gif-guide-to-voguing--short-history|title=A GIF Guide to Voguing (+ Short History)|access-date=2017-05-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Houses are led by “mothers” and “fathers,” providing guidance and support for their house “children.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bailey|first=Marlon|date=|title=Gender/Racial Realness:  Theorizing the Gender  System in Ballroom Culture|url=|journal=Feminist Studies|volume=37|pages=365–386}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most houses operate in the same way. Houses exist across the United States and in over 15 cities, most being in the northeast.

*''Face'': The face category is about who has a classically beautiful face. Judges examine the eyes, the nose, the teeth, the lips and the structure of the face. While the category may call for an effect, ultimately the judges will only look at the face of a competitor, which should not have much makeup and should appear flawless.
*''Body'': This category is about health. The judges will be looking for someone who looks attractive, and healthy. Do not confuse this with sexiness, as there is a completely different category for that.
*''Sex Siren'': Participants will do their best to tease, and titillate the judges. Some do so by stripping all their clothes off, others do it through erotic dancing, and some combine the two in order to attempt to win.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=BRTB TV (BALLROOM THROWBACKS)|title=BQ SEX SIREN @ VOGUE NIGHTS 5/11/2015|date=2015-05-12|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI9XnM5VHis|accessdate=2017-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
As a [[counterculture|countercultural]] phenomenon, ball culture is rooted in necessity and defiance.

According to findings by Dr. Genny Beemyn addressed in their book ''Trans Bodies, Trans Selves'', members of the underground [[LGBT|LGBTQ+]] community in large cities of the late nineteenth century began to organize masquerade balls known as "drags" in direct defiance of laws banning citizens from wearing clothes of the opposite gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Trans Bodies, Trans Selves|last=Beemyn|first=Genny|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=0199325359|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his essay "Spectacles of Colors", [[Langston Hughes]] describes his experience at a drag ball in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SsgPcfpjhBcC&amp;pg=PA208&amp;dq=langston+hughes+spectacles+in+color&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjohcfVzfzZAhUD72MKHWLdCLEQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Collected Works of Langston Hughes|last=Hughes|first=Langston|date=2001|publisher=University of Missouri Press|isbn=9780826214102|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Strangest and gaudiest of all Harlem spectacles in the '20s, and still the strangest and gaudiest, is the annual Hamilton Club Lodge Ball at Rockland Palace Casino. I once attended as a guest of A'Lelia Walker. It is the ball where men dress as women and women dress as men. During the height of the New Negro era and the tourist invasion of Harlem, it was fashionable for the intelligentsia and social leaders of both Harlem and the downtown area to occupy boxes at this ball and look down from above at the queerly assorted throng on the dancing floor, males in flowing gowns and feathered headdresses and females in tuxedoes and box-back suits." —Langston Hughes&lt;/blockquote&gt;In the subsequent decades, drag balls eventually developed the modern, mainstream format we know today.

The modern ballroom culture has existed for at least five decades. However, it remains largely underground and unknown for this particular community of Black and Latino queer youth. It began in Harlem more than 50 years ago, and has now expanded rapidly to other major cities such as [[Chicago]], Atlanta, Baltimore, Charlotte, Cleveland, Detroit, and Philadelphia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Moreover, with the advancements of social media, it has migrated to other countries such as [[Canada]], [[Japan]], and the [[United Kingdom|UK]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bailey|first=Marlon M.|date=2014-04-21|title=Engendering space: Ballroom culture and the spatial practice of possibility in Detroit|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0966369X.2013.786688|journal=Gender, Place &amp; Culture|volume=21|issue=4|pages=489–507|doi=10.1080/0966369X.2013.786688|issn=0966-369X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ball culture also known as "house ball culture," was first captured in Jennie Livingston's documentary, ''Paris is Burning'' (1990).

===New York City===
[[Cross dressing ball]]s had existed since the thirties, consisting of primarily white men, they competed in fashion shows in bars 2 or 3 times a year. Black queens would sometimes participate but rarely won any prizes.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Due to discrimination, Black queens Crystal Labeija and her friend Lottie began their own drag ball titled 'House of Labeija,' kickstarting the ballroom scene in New York.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In 1989, The House of Latex was created as a call to action in the ballroom community to bridge the gap between [[HIV]]-STI prevention and ballroom culture.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Washington, DC ===
{{more citations needed|date=June 2018}}
This account from the metropolitan Washington, D.C. area describes how ball culture and drag houses developed about 1960:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Some regular house parties became institutionalized as drag "houses" and "families." The leader, or "mother," often provided not only the opportunity for parties but also instruction and mentoring in the arts of make-up, selecting clothes, lip-synching, portraying a personality, walking, and related skills. Those taught became "drag daughters," who in turn mentored others, creating entire "drag families." Drag houses became the first social support groups in the city's gay and lesbian community. House names often came from addresses of the house 'mother', such as Mother Billy Bonhill's Belmont House at 15th and Belmont NW, or associations with the "mother's" chosen personality, as Mame Dennis's Beekman Place.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The dance styles which later characterized drag houses had not been developed; competitions between houses involved standard drag performances in which entertainers lip-synced or, rarely, sang. In contrast to the New York houses in Paris Is Burning, some of the Washington, D.C. house mothers were white. However, African-American drag queens were a prominent part of the community:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Venues for drag shows and competitions were a constant challenge in the 1960s. The Uptown Lounge sponsored monthly drag contests, an event later duplicated at Johnnie's on Capitol Hill. Chunga's drag shows at the Golden Key Club in North Beach, Maryland were a popular Sunday event. The major hotels' resistance to drag events was not broken until February 1968 when African-American drag impresario Black Pearl staged the gala Black Pearl International Awards at the Washington Hilton. It was the drag event of the year.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Washington, D.C. ball community consists primarily of African-American and Latino participants, and has adopted many attributes seen in Paris Is Burning. Nineteen-sixties-style drag shows and competitions still exist, with their own audience. Ball patrons will find similar categories (such as "banjee thug realness" and "vogue") as an audience member.

The Washington ballroom scene was founded in 1986 by Icon Lowell Adonis-Khanh (Lowell Thomas Hickman) and Icon Eric Christian-Bazaar. During the 1990s, more houses appeared in the area due to the efforts of Twain Miyake-Mugler ("father" of the House of Miyake Mugler, D.C. Chapter), Icon Harold Balenciaga (founder of the house of Balenciaga), Icons Shannon Garcon and Whitney Garcon (founders of the House of Garcon&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://projects.aljazeera.com/2014/on-the-runway/|title=Ovahness Ball|work=Al Jazeera America|access-date=2018-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and charter members of The Legendary House of Miyake-Mugler).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://walk4mewednesdays.com/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302220820/http://walk4mewednesdays.com/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-03-02|title=Walk For Me Online|date=2013-03-02|access-date=2018-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city hosts a series of annual balls, in which contestants compete for trophies and cash prizes.{{anchor|Personality}}

===Dance===
The most notable influence of ball culture on mainstream society is [[Vogue (dance)|voguing]], a dance style originating in Harlem ballrooms during the first half of the 20th century and popularized by the video for [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s "[[Vogue (Madonna song)|Vogue]]", released in 1990 (one year before the documentary ''[[Paris Is Burning (film)|Paris Is Burning]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuJQSAiODqI|title=Madonna - Vogue (video)|last=|first=|date=|website=Youtube|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dance group Vogue Evolution, from ''[[America's Best Dance Crew]]'', has again sparked interest in voguing.&lt;ref name="ninja"&gt;[http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/arts/story.html?id=523c9eac-b15e-4824-ad95-9c92ff811018&amp;k=61095] ''Ottawa Citizen'' September 6, 2006{{dead link|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Vogueing was a powerful dance movement that originated in '70s and '80s New York among the predominantly black gay community in Harlem. Vogueing started in Drag Balls that were held by the queer community of color. The competitions were divided up into Houses that then competed in different categories, in which one of the categories was Voguing. It was during these dance offs that 'vogueing' was born. It was a non-violent battle of elegance and femininity named after a certain fashion magazine as it mirrored the poses held by models. It was all about arm and hand movements, with dancers often playing out elaborate scenes such as applying makeup or taking phone calls while dancing down the catwalk.&lt;ref name="Marra"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Staging desire : Queer readings of American theater history (Triangulations: lesbian/gay/queer theater/drama/performance).|last=Marra|first=K|location=Ann Arbor |publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=2002|isbn=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=November 2018}}

Willi Ninja was recognized as the "Grandfather of Vogue." Vogueing with its angular body movements, exaggerated model poses and intricate mime-like choreography and the colorful characters who populated Willi Ninja's world were introduced to the public at large by “Paris Is Burning,” the award-winning 1990 documentary about New York’s drag vogue-ball scene. Vogueing had been around for years, but Willi Ninja brought it to a level of visibility and perfection in performance that no one had ever reached.&lt;ref name="Marra"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=November 2018}}

===Language===
Ball-culture terms are sometimes used more generally; "drag mother" may apply to any drag queen in a mentorship role, and "drag house" may refer to a group of drag performers allied personally or professionally. "Fierce" and "fierceness," "work it" and "working it," "fabulous" and "fabulousness" are heard in ''Paris Is Burning'' and appeared in the lyrics of "[[Supermodel (You Better Work)]]", a 1992 hit by [[drag queen]] [[RuPaul]]. These terms became more widely used in [[gay slang]], fashion industry [[jargon]] and mainstream [[colloquialism|colloquial]] language.&lt;ref&gt;''Fantabulosa: A Dictionary of Polari and Gay Slang'' by Paul Baker&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reading: to read a person is to highlight and exaggerate all of the flaws of a person, from their ridiculous clothes, to their flawed makeup and anything else the reader can come up with. It is a battle of wit, in which the winner is one who gets the crowd to laugh the most.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vogue.com/article/art-of-shade-instagram-account|title=The Art of Shade Is the Instagram Account You Never Knew You Needed|work=Vogue|access-date=2017-05-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Throw shade (slang)|Shade]]: shade is an art form that developed from Reading. Rather than the aim to insult, someone works with the medium of backhanded compliments. An example is to suggest that someone's beautiful dress makes people almost forget that she has a five o'clock shadow.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* [[Yas (slang)|Yas]]: emphatic yes, the longer the "a" the greater the pleasure expressed
* Voguing: dance invented in Harlem and performed notably by [[Willi Ninja]]&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2018/01/09/linguistic-legacy-paris-is-burning/|title=The linguistic legacy of Paris is Burning - OxfordWords blog|date=2018-01-09|work=OxfordWords blog|access-date=2018-05-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Walking: walking to acquire the admiration of ball contestants
* Mopping: shoplifting clothes to wear for a ball&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
* Working, or "work" for short : an exclamatory phrase used to connote admiration and content with someone's actions

===Music===
Ball culture has been fertile ground for new forms of [[house music]] and other genres of [[electronic dance music]] through its [[Disc jockey|DJs]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004RJEM ''Hang the DJ''] (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The culture has also influenced a wave of [[LGBT hip hop|queer hip hop]] artists such as [[Zebra Katz]], [[House of Ladosha]] and [[Le1f]] .&lt;ref name=swag&gt;[http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/8793-we-invented-swag/ "We Invented Swag: NYC's Queer Rap"].

In 2006, [[Beyoncé]] told a reporter from ''[[The Independent]]'' "how inspired she's been by the whole drag-house circuit in the States, an unsung part of black American culture where working-class gay men channel ultra-glamour in mocked-up catwalk shows.

In 2012, the show entertained over 100,000 U.S. troops and their families at 17 military installations throughout 10 countries in association with Armed Forces Entertainment.  In 2013, the show was redesigned into a modern dinner theatre experience in partnership with Norwegian Cruise Line, to perform indefinitely on their new Breakaway sailing year-round from NYC.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cirque-dreams-entertainment-brand-celebrates-20-years-of-global-growth--expansion-with-7-shows-and-tours-in-2013-215553531.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cirque Dreams Illumination===

===Cirque Dreams Pandemonia===
A show featuring "surreal visual stylings and bursts into the air, sideways and upside-down.  Inventive acrobatics and free-ranging whimsy, unleashed in a playground of imagination and Technicolor atmospherics."{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

===Cirque Dreams &amp; Dinner===
[[Norwegian Cruise Line]] offers a version of the company's shows, which according to USA today is "nothing like anything currently found at sea."&lt;ref&gt;http://travel.usatoday.com/cruises/legacy/item.aspx?type=blog&amp;ak=84875.blog A sneak peek at Norwegian Cruise Line's epic plans for new entertainment&lt;/ref&gt; The show features aerialists flying overhead, acrobats, contortionists, muscle men, jokesters and musicians all performing while the guests eat dinner. The show's artistic director claims if rough seas take place they will just become part of the show.

==Legal issues==
[[Cirque du Soleil]] filed a [[trademark infringement]] lawsuit against them and others in the late 1990s over the use of the word ''cirque'' ('circus' in [[French language|French]]). After a six-year battle, Cirque Dreams along with others who used the name ''cirque'' were successful in defeating the lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tampabay.com/features/performingarts/article972823.ece | title=Cirque Dreams founder sets his creation apart | work=Tampa Bay Times | date=2009-02-03 | accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tess2.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4010:2uk23d.4.2 | work=United States Patent and Trademark Office | title=Word Mark: CIRQUE DREAMS | date=2004-06-17 | accessdate=2012-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chica en Comparsa, Carnavales de Maturin.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Comparsa on the streets of [[Maturín]], [[Venezuela]].]]
A '''comparsa''' is a group of singers, musicians and dancers that take part in [[carnivals]] and other festivities in [[Spain]] and [[Latin America]]. Its precise meaning depends on the specific regional celebration. The most famous comparsas are those that participate in the [[Carnival of Santiago de Cuba]]. In Brazil, comparsas are called [[carnival block]]s, as those seen in the [[Rio Carnival|Carnival of Rio de Janeiro]] and other [[Brazilian carnival]]s. In the US, especially at the [[New Orleans Mardi Gras]], comparsas are called [[krewe]]s, which include [[Float (parade)|floats]].

== Spain ==
[[File:Carnaval de Malaga 1925 comparsa Pescadores Calabreses Bonitos Tangos.jpg|thumb|right|200px|1925 book of songs by the Pescadores Calabreses comparsa from the Carnival of [[Málaga]], [[Spain]].]]
In Spain, the term comparsa can have different meanings depending on the celebration.

=== Cádiz ===
In [[Cádiz]] and other parts of [[Andalusia]], comparsas are groups of singers that take part in carnivals, especially the [[Carnival of Cádiz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mintz|first1=Jerome R.|title=Carnival song and society: gossip, sexuality, and creativity in Andalusia|date=1997|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=185973183X|page=xxx}}&lt;/ref&gt; They sing comedy routines and the best comparsa is chosen in a contest. Other ensembles can also be found at the carnival, such as [[chirigota]]s, coros de carnaval, and cuartetos carnavalescos.

=== Santa Cruz de Tenerife ===
In the [[Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife]], comparsas are similar to Brazilian carnival blocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5RUKAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA302 | page = 302 | title = Continuum encyclopedia of popular music of the world, Volumes 3-7 | editor = John Shepherd | publisher = Continuum | year = 2005 | isbn = 0826474365 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Caribbean==
=== Cuba ===
{{see also|Conga (music)}}
Cuban comparsas originate in the eastern part of the island, specifically in the streets of [[Santiago de Cuba]]. Comparsas are groups of singers, musicians and dancers. The singers and musicians form part of the [[conga (music)|conga]], the ensemble that specifically plays the carnival music (a genre also called conga). The rest of the comparsa is formed by dancers with defined costumes and choreographies. Apart from the large [[Carnival of Santiago de Cuba]], there is a carnival in Havana with slightly different customs. Famous comparsas from Santiago include Los Hoyos, Paso Franco, Guayabito, San Agustín, San Pedrito and Alto Pino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Henken|first1=Ted A.|last2=Celaya|first2=Miriam|last3=Castellanos|first3=Dima|title=Cuba|date=2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, CA|page=408|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Pe_XAQAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Famous comparsas from Havana include La Sultana, El Alacrán and [[Guaracheros de Regla]].

=== Dominican Republic ===
[[File:Diablo Cojuelo, diablo Mambero.jpg|thumb|180x180px|Diablo Cojuelo tradicional del carnaval Dominicano]]
Dominican Republic comparsas or troupes are dance groups choosing a traditionally festive or allegorical subject to typical Dominican things, organizing a presentation with costumes and mask. Diablo Cojuelo is the most popular character in the Dominican carnival and each province has unique elements.

=== Belize ===
Throughout the country, particularly in [[Corozal Town]] and [[San Pedro Town]], comparsas are groups of street dancers which perform carnival season. The dancers dress up in traditional Mayan clothes.

==South America==
=== Argentina ===
In Argentina, comparsas are very similar to the Brazilian [[carnival block]]s, being followed by carriages.

=== Uruguay ===
In Uruguay, a comparsa makes reference to a group of [[candombe]] dancers and drummers.

[[File:SharonStone32.JPG|thumb|[[Sharon Stone]] at the Deauville American Film Festival in 1991]]

The '''Deauville American Film Festival''' ({{lang-fr|'''Festival du cinéma américain de Deauville'''}}) is a yearly [[film festival]] devoted to [[Cinema of the United States|American cinema]], taking place since 1975 in [[Deauville]], France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/26/world/europe/26iht-srgaDEAUVILLE26.html|publisher=The New York Times|title=A French Town's Bright Shine Belies Its Size|author=Christopher F.

It was established by Lionel Chouchan, André Halimi, and then Mayor of [[Deauville]] [[Michel d'Ornano]], with support from the [[Groupe Lucien Barrière]] in providing a luxurious setting for the Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deauville American Film Festival history|url=http://www.festival-deauville.com/DEV/index.php?pid=49|website=www.festival-deauville.com|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although not competitive at its origin, the festival began to award prizes in 1995, for [[feature film]]s, and 1998 for [[short film]]s.

== History ==

=== 2011-2012: Beginnings and mainstream success. ===
Dr. Panda (previously TribePlay) was founded in 2011 by Thijs Bosma&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/tribeplay-rebrands-as-dr-panda-in-honor-of-childrens-game-franchise/617061|title=TribePlay Rebrands as Dr. Panda in Honor of Children;s Game Franchise|work=Social Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and began development for the future Dr. Panda franchise in early 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://drpanda.com/word-thijs-bosma-drpanda-founder-ceo/&lt;/ref&gt; By March 2012, Dr. Panda launched their first game, ''Dr. Panda Teach Me!'' on the App Store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-A0pFzwu990|title=Dr.Panda Teach Me! Trailer |work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the company has released 29 more titles that have surpassed 50 million downloads in over 100 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bestappsforkids.org/health/dr-panda-bathtime/|title=Dr. Panda Bath Time|work=Best Apps for Kids}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us.blastingnews.com/lifestyle/2016/09/dr-panda-releases-dr-panda-bath-time-on-september-8-2016-001106701.html|title=Dr. Panda releases ‘Dr. Panda Bath Time’ on September 8, 2016|work=Blasting News}}&lt;/ref&gt; making them the third largest developer of paid kids apps worldwide on iOS—and largest independent developer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/pressreleases/238917/TribePlay_Changes_Name_to_Dr_Panda_as_its_ChildrenrsquosEducational_Games_Surpass_40_Million_Installs.php|title=TribePlay Changes Name to Dr. Panda as its Children's Educational Games Surpass 40 Million Installs|work=Gamasutra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2013-Present: Rebranding and expansion. ===
Dr. Panda expanded into 3D graphics with the release of ''Dr. Panda Home'' in 2013. It was featured as one of ''[[The Guardian]]'''s Best 20 Android Apps of the Week in 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/29/best-android-apps-virgin-tv-ridiculous-fishing|title=20 best Android apps and games this week|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was awarded with an "Editor's Choice Award" by ''Children's Technology Review''.&lt;ref&gt;http://reviews.childrenstech.com/ctr/review.php?id=17358&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, TribePlay rebranded to Dr. Panda to better reflect the personality and popularity of the game franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/tribeplay-rebrands-as-dr-panda-in-honor-of-childrens-game-franchise/617061|title=TribePlay Rebrands as Dr. Panda in Honor of Children;s Game Franchise|work=Social Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2016, the company launched the ''Dr. Panda Plush Toy'' along with official ''Dr. Panda T-shirts'' that are available to buy from the US Amazon store.&lt;ref&gt;http://drpanda.com/dr-panda-plush-toy/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Dr-Panda-Plush-Toy/dp/B010SIECE8/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01B12QBBC/ref=s9_dcacsd_bhz_bw_c_x_2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Popular games ==
According to the company's official [http://www.drpanda.com website], Dr. Panda games combines role play, open-ended play and expressive characters.&lt;ref&gt;https://venturebeat.com/2015/03/17/dr-panda-passes-40-million-installs-showing-that-kids-in-china-and-the-west-play-the-same-way/&lt;/ref&gt; Each game explores a different aspect of everyday life from cooking and traffic, to gardening and art.&lt;ref&gt;https://thenextweb.com/asia/2012/12/04/china-based-tribeplay-raises-750000-to-produce-monthly-dr-panda-kids-games/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dr. Panda's Restaurant 2 ===
''Dr. Panda's Restaurant 2'' is an interactive cooking-based game for children aged 6–8. It follows the main character Dr. Panda as he tries to run his beach-side restaurant as efficiently as possible, satisfying various customers that visit during the day. The customers in the game are animals ranging from hippos and elephants to polar bears, and each customer orders a dish of their liking when they arrive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bidnessetc.com/34914-apple-inc-free-app-of-the-week-childrens-game-dr-pandas-restaurant-2/|title=Apple Inc. Free App Of The Week: Children's Game "Dr. Panda's Restaurant 2"|work= BisnessEtc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game aims to educate children on the concept of preparing food, and familiarizes them with basic ingredients and the steps involved in preparing dishes like pastas and pizzas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bidnessetc.com/34914-apple-inc-free-app-of-the-week-childrens-game-dr-pandas-restaurant-2/|title=Apple Inc.

At the top of the screen is a choice of seven building elements, including brick, water, electricity, roads, nature, money and a heart. To discover the more than 70 buildings, kids will need to combine the elements in different ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/gudmundsen/2014/08/02/apps-lego-lovers/13364029/|title=Two terrific town-building apps for LEGO lovers|work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Enfield Savoy Theatre''''' (previously the '''''Enfield Cinema'''''; subsequently the '''''Hoyts Savoy Theatre'''''; also known as the '''''Enfield Savoy''''') was a [[Movie theater|theatre and cinema]] located at 306-308 [[Hume Highway#Route|Liverpool Road]], {{NSWcity|Enfield}}, a suburb in the [[Inner West|inner west]] region of [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]]. The building now functions as a [[hardware store]].

==History==
Designed by the architectural firm Kaberry and Chard,&lt;ref name="Strathfield"&gt;{{cite web|title=Enfield Savoy Cinema|url=https://strathfieldheritage.org/recreation-and-shops/enfield-savoy-cinema/|website=Strathfield Heritage|accessdate=12 February 2018|date=15 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the theatre was opened on 16 November 1927, with a seating capacity of 1,878.&lt;ref name="Cinema treasures"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roe|first1=Ken|title=Hoyts Savoy Theatre in Sydney, AU - Cinema Treasures|url=http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/35280#|website=cinematreasures.org|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928 Enfield Council valued the building at [[Australian pound|A£]]17,000.&lt;ref name="Strathfield"/&gt;

In 1930 there was an armed hold up at the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article126204629 |title=SHOTS FIRED. |newspaper=[[The Maitland Daily Mercury]] |issue=18,534 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=1 September 1930 |accessdate=13 February 2018 |page=1 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, Western Suburbs Cinemas Ltd, a company which also operated the ''Strathfield Melba'' and ''Homebush Theatre'' in Sydney’s western suburbs took over management of the Enfield Savoy.&lt;ref name="Strathfield"/&gt;

The theatre was redesigned in the [[Art Deco#Australia and New Zealand|Art Deco]] style in 1938.&lt;ref name="Past lives"&gt;{{cite web|title=Savoy Cinema/Quality House/Whitewood Warehouse/Poliak Building Supply Co. – Enfield, NSW|url=https://pastlivesofthenearfuture.com/2012/03/21/savoy-cinemawhitewood-warehousepoliak-building-supply-co-enfield-nsw/|website=Past/Lives of the Near Future|accessdate=12 February 2018|date=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The façade and interior were rebuilt under guidance of architect G N Kentworthy who also designed ''Cremorne Orpheum'' Theatre and a Christie organ was added and was opened by organist Dennis Palmistra.&lt;ref name="Cinema treasures"/&gt; The instrument was originally installed in the Hoyts De Luxe Theatre, Melbourne, then the Hoyts Plaza Theatre, Sydney.&lt;ref name="Strathfield"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cinema treasures"/&gt; The cinema was renamed the ''Savoy'' and reopened by the Mayor of Enfield in July 1938.&lt;ref name="Strathfield"/&gt; 

In 1944 Western Suburbs Cinemas Ltd was taken over by [[Hoyts]] resulting in a name change to the ''Hoyts Savoy Theatre''.&lt;ref name="Strathfield"/&gt;

The last film shown at the cinema was ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' in 1960.&lt;ref name="Past lives"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Strathfield"/&gt;

==Later years==
After the cinema closed, the building had various retail uses including Shoppers World (1960),&lt;ref name="Cinema treasures"/&gt; carpet and furniture store (1981),&lt;ref name="Cinema treasures"/&gt; Quality House, Whitewood Warehouse, and the Poliak Building Supply Company.&lt;ref name="Cinema treasures"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Past lives"/&gt;

A campaign in 2017 to list the building on the local heritage register was unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="McKee"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McKee|first1=Jillian|title=Two iconic theatres miss out on heritage listing|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/inner-west/two-iconic-theatres-miss-out-on-heritage-listing/news-story/c756b3c076fac7843ff24195d29eec68|website=The Daily Telegraph|date=3 July 2017|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4602">Rigging in entertainment can be broken down into two main subjects – [[theatrical rigging]] and [[arena rigging]]. All the same skills apply in both genres. The first takes place in a [[theatre (structure)|theatre]], and typically involves the theatre's permanent [[fly system]]. The other in an [[arena]] or "exposed structure venue" such as a [[convention center]], [[ballroom]], [[warehouse]] etc. Many arena riggers find themselves hanging a full [[proscenium]] theater in an arena environment.&lt;ref&gt;'''Entertainment Rigging''' [http://www.beyondrigging.com/2014/04/stage-rigging-books-recommendation/ "'''Great Stage Rigging Books Sharing'''"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Circus rigging, comprising aerial acrobatic apparatuses that support human beings under dynamic loading conditions, and stabilization rigging for large scale fabric tension structures (big tops), is, perhaps, under appreciated in the general rigging field, and may be considered by some to be a separate field. However, the principles of physics and the standards of engineering that apply to theatrical and arena rigging still hold true in circus rigging, and much of the same equipment and many of the same devices are commonly used. All the same skills apply in this genre as well.

Chain motors and trusses are not used as often in tented circuses as in arena or theater rigging, however arena circuses make regular use of them. In both tented and arena circuses, crane-bars or frames stabilized by guy cables, hung from fiber rope block and tackle systems are common, as are systems supporting and tensioning safety nets.

High (or low) wire rigging, while simple in principle and application, requires substantial load-path capacity, as wire walkers generally require high tension in their systems.

Automation rigging is used by many circuses, to fly both human beings and scenic or prop elements.

In theatrical rigging the venue may have anything from a dead pull scenery flying system, a [[Theatrical rigging#Hemp rigging system|hemp rigging system]], a [[Theatrical rigging#Counterweight rigging system|counterweight rigging system]], a [[winch]] or [[hoist (device)|hoist]] driven [[Theatrical rigging#Automated rigging system|automated rigging system]], or any hybrid of the aforementioned, used to fly props, people and scenery.

==Stations==
Both of these rigging disciplines have four basic stations.

===Ground rigger===
Maintains safe perimeters underneath high work being done, maintains a safe path and perimeter around aerial work platforms, monitors the movement of aerial work platforms, assembles rigging on the ground for high work being done, attaches gear and assemblies to lines for high work being done, marks or "lays " out points on the floor and moves designators for high work (rigging points and laser plumbs), assembles and checks out [[Motion control|motion control systems]], makes attachments to lifting frames, lighting trusses, audio, video and scenery for hoisting or flying, does visual and mechanical safety inspections.

===Bucket rigger===
Has all of the skills and responsibility of a ground rigger and must also be able to operate an [[aerial work platform]], must be able to identify suitable structure and attachment for rigging, must be able to lift 100&amp;nbsp;lbs, must have advanced rope skills, be able to apply rope work mechanical advantages, as well as knowledge of materials, manufacturing methods and the proper applications of different rigging systems..

===High rigger/ Up rigger===
Is virtually identical to a bucket rigger, only they apply their trade while standing, sitting on or hanging from an exposed structural member.

===Climbing or rope access rigger===
Has all of the previous skills and responsibilities of the other 3 riggers and they must also have exceptional rope skills. They must also be very physically fit and able to pull their own body weight up into structural ceilings on belay while applying personal fall protection as they go. They must be proficient with harness positioning systems and advanced rope friction and hauling systems.

==Training==
Most entertainment rigging training is done either by [[apprenticeship]] or formal training through unions i.e. [[IATSE]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iatselocal720.com/&lt;/ref&gt; The recognized entertainment rigging certification is the E.T.C.P. arena and theater rigging certification programs.&lt;ref&gt;http://etcp.esta.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information==
An eye popper is a small, [[dome]]-shaped piece of [[rubber]] or similar material resembling a half of a rubber ball; the shape of a smile is often imprinted on the dome. When pressed, the toy inverts, but after a few seconds, it pops back into its original shape, making a loud popping sound. If resting on the ground when this happens, the toy [[Deflection (physics)|will fly]] several feet into the air. The eye popper's behavior resembles the process by which a ball compresses upon hitting a hard surface.&lt;ref name="Hopper Popper"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Katz|first=David|title=Hopper Popper|year=2005|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Fantasy]] [[comics]]''' have been around as long as the medium itself.

==History==
{{Original research|section|date=August 2016}}In the US market, early years of fantasy comics began in the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]] and were populated with such notable works range from All-American comics' (and later DC comics') Greek myth inspired super hero [[Wonder Woman]] to [[Dell]]'s [[Tarzan (comics)|Tarzan]].

Starting in the late 1940s through the mid-1950s horror-themed fantasy anthologies gained prominence; the most famous of these include [[EC Comics]]' ''[[Tales from the Crypt (comics)|Tales from the Crypt]]'','' [[Haunt of Fear]]'', and ''[[Vault of Horror]]''; and lesser notable titles such as [[American Comics Group]] ''[[Adventures into the Unknown]]'' and'' [[Forbidden Worlds]]'' though this trend saw its prevalence cease with the publication of [[Fredric Wertham|Dr. Fredric Wertham]]'s book ''[[Seduction of the Innocent]]'' which directly led to a Senate hearing of the influence of comics on juvenile violence. Though fantasy comics were able to survive in this new atmosphere though in a diminished capacity compared to its much stronger output in these early years.

Fantasy-themed super heroes continued to populate comics through the 1950s and regained popularity in the 1960s with such characters as [[Steve Ditko]]'s [[Doctor Strange]] published by [[Marvel comics]] and [[Jack Kirby]]'s [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] both appearing in two of Marvel's fantasy-themed anthologies – [[Strange Tales]] and [[Journey into Mystery]].

In the 1970s, [[Conan the Barbarian]],  created by [[Robert E. Howard]], became one of the most popular publications of [[Marvel Comics]]. After some changes of publishers, it continued to be published in the 2010s.

In the 1990s, [[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]], created by [[Neil Gaiman]], [[Sam Kieth]] and [[Mike Dringenberg]] was popular.

'''''Hitman 2''''' is a [[stealth video game]] developed by [[IO Interactive]] and published by [[Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment]] for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]]. It is the seventh entry in the ''[[Hitman (franchise)|Hitman]]'' video game series and is the sequel to the 2016 game ''[[Hitman (2016 video game)|Hitman]]''. The game was released on 13 November 2018 and was met with generally positive reviews.

== Synopsis ==
Following the events of ''[[Hitman (2016 video game)|Hitman]]'', [[Agent 47]] embarks on a mission to hunt the mysterious "Shadow Client" and disassemble his militia. His first lead is the location of one of the Shadow Client's lieutenants, Alma Reynard. 47 is able to gain some intel on the Shadow Client's activities from Reynard's home in [[New Zealand]] before eliminating her. Impressed with 47's performance, Providence authorizes him and the ICA to hunt down the rest of the Shadow Client's militia. When 47 asks Diana why the ICA would be willing to work with Providence, she replies that both organizations share interests in putting a stop to the Shadow Client, whose activities are now causing a global panic. She also reveals that Providence secretly promised to her to reveal 47's past.

Following the intel gained from Reynard, 47 is sent to [[Miami]] to assassinate tech giant Robert Knox and his daughter Sierra, the owner and heir of Kronstadt Industries. Not only have they secretly sold advanced weapons to war criminals, but they are also Providence members who defected to the Shadow Client's side, presumably to protect themselves from his attacks. Meanwhile, the remaining members of Providence descend into consternation as more of their operatives are killed worldwide. Despite this, Providence manages to identify the Shadow Client as Lucas Grey, the former head of security to deceased Providence key-holder Eugene Cobb. Grey, now located in Central Europe, pursues his own plans with hacktivist Olivia Hall and insists that they need 47's help if they are to dismantle Providence.

47 heads to [[Colombia]] next in order to assassinate drug lord Rico Delgado and his top lieutenants, who have been using their smuggling network to aid Grey and his militia. Diana reports the mission's success to Providence while visiting the graves of her family in [[Surrey]]. Flashbacks reveal that she witnessed her parents being killed by a car bomb after they attempted to bring the company responsible for her brother's death to court. Shortly after Grey steals an item from the Ether Corporation in [[Johannesburg]], his militia use a hostage situation to publicly reveal Providence's existence. 47 is then sent to [[Mumbai]] to track down and eliminate the pirates who killed a Providence operative in [[Shanghai]]. After the mission, 47 follows Grey's trail to [[Romania]], back to the very same asylum where he was created by Dr. Ort-Meyer. He encounters Grey, who reveals that they were both previously kept in the lab to be raised as assassins for Providence. 47 regains some of his memories, remembering that Grey was Subject 6, and that they both made a pact to take revenge on those responsible for turning them into assassins.

The revelation leads to Diana meeting with Grey and Hall in [[Berlin]]. Grey reveals that Ort-Meyer, the scientist responsible for his and Agent 47's creation, was a member of Providence, who are controlled by a leader known as "the Constant" and three executive members known as "the Partners." After Grey and 47's original plan to take down the Partners failed, they decided to erase 47's memories, though Grey was able to escape before his memories were wiped. Grey's current objective is to capture the Constant, as he is the only person who knows the identities of the Partners. His only lead, however, is that 47 knew the identity of the first Constant. Grey then reveals that the item he had stolen from the Ether Corporation was an antidote that may counteract 47's memory loss. Initially reluctant to work with Grey, Diana eventually abides by 47's wish to take the antidote. The antidote allows 47 to remember that the first Constant was a legendary Cold War spymaster codenamed "Janus". In order to get close to Janus, Diana files a false report implicating Janus as the true Shadow Client while claiming Grey was just a subordinate, giving 47 pretext to infiltrate Janus' home in the suburbs of [[Vermont]].

Investigating several clues, Agent 47 finds evidence that Janus was planning to meet the Constant at a gala held by "The Ark Society," a plutocratic survivalist group created within Providence. Hall is able to pinpoint the meeting location on a remote island in the North Atlantic, but they find out that the Constant, revealed as the man who hired Diana and 47 at the end of ''Hitman'', has implanted himself with a suicide chip that will instantly release lethal poison into his body if he is compromised. 47 is then dispatched to eliminate Zoe and Sophia Washington, twin sisters and newly appointed chairwomen of the Ark Society who each hold a kill-switch for the Constant. Once the Washington sisters are neutralized, 47 and Grey proceed to capture and extract the Constant. 47, Grey, and Diana interrogate the Constant, pointing out that by being captured, his life is forfeit to the Partners. Defeated, the Constant reveals that Providence is made up of the Ingram, Carlisle, and Stuyvesant families, with each family having a representative that serves as a "Partner."

As 47 and Grey head out to confront the three families, the Constant taunts Diana about facts she still doesn't know about Agent 47. A final flashback reveals that 47 was responsible for the car bomb that killed Diana's parents all along.

== Gameplay ==
''Hitman 2''{{'s}} [[gameplay]] is similar to its 2016 predecessor, as Agent 47, a contract assassin working for the International Contract Agency (ICA), travels to various locations around the globe to eliminate high-profile targets. The game features six missions, which are set in six distinct locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/gaming/971041/Hitman-2-release-date-trailer-2018-Season-2 |title=Hitman 2 release date and first trailer revealed, no 2018 Season 2 |first=Gary |last=Jones |work=[[Express.co.uk]] |date=7 June 2018 |accessdate=8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the missions in the game will take place at a racetrack in [[Miami]], where 47 must assassinate one of the drivers and her tech mogul father, while another, set in the fictional area of Santa Fortuna, [[Colombia]], has him hunting the leaders of a local cartel.

The other four missions of the game were announced on 23 October 2018. The locations are [[Hawke's Bay Region|Hawke's Bay]], [[Mumbai]], a fictional [[Vermont]] suburb, and the mysterious Isle of Sgàil in the [[North Atlantic]].

The game introduces concussive gadgets, which can be used to render an NPC unconscious, and reintroduces the briefcase, which allows the player to conceal and carry large weapons, such as sniper rifles, in public without arousing suspicion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-06-07-io-interactive-unveils-hitman-2-out-in-november |title=IO Interactive unveils Hitman 2, out in November |first=Matt |last=Wales |work=[[Eurogamer]] |date=7 June 2018 |accessdate=8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game's announcement was accompanied by the release of a [[cooperative multiplayer]] [[Game mode|mode]] titled ''Sniper Assassin'', available immediately to those who pre-order ''Hitman 2''.

In addition to [[Agent 47]], players can play as Knight and Stone, both of whom have access to unique ammo types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/06/07/hitman-2-sniper-assassin-is-deep-fun-and-full-of-potential |title=Hitman 2: Sniper Assassin Is Deep, Fun and Full of Potential |first=Collin |last=McGregor |work=[[IGN]] |date=7 June 2018 |accessdate=8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with its predecessor, ''Hitman 2'' features the time-limited "Elusive Targets" missions. British actor [[Sean Bean]] portrays the first Elusive Target in the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-10-17-sean-bean-will-be-killed-off-again-this-time-as-hitman-2s-first-elusive-target |title=Sean Bean will be killed off again, this time as Hitman 2's first elusive target |first=Tom |last=Phillips |work=[[Eurogamer]] |date=17 October 2018 |accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''hivinau''' is a dance from [[Tahiti]] where the dancers turn in pairs around the orchestra. It is often either the first or the last dance of a dance festival, or used as a transition between two dances.

Although an old dance, it is not traditional, the name hivinau probably derived from a yell by the officers of any passing European ship: "Heave now!", and the subsequent turning of the wheel with anchor chain by the crew.

Imagine 2 circles, one of men, another of women, turning around the centre axis where the orchestra sits, as whether the anchor is to be heaved. Every time a male and female dancer meet each other, they turn to each other, yell: "Hiri, haʻa, haʻa" and may perform some knee or hip shakes respectively.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2522">An '''interconnect agreement''' is a business [[contract]] between telecommunications organizations for the purpose of interconnecting their networks and exchanging telecommunications traffic. Interconnect agreements are found both in the [[public switched telephone network]] and the [[Internet]].

In the public switched telephone network, an interconnect agreement invariably involves settlement fees based on [[Calling party|call source]] and [[Called party|destination]], connection times and duration, when these fees do not cancel out between operators. 

On the Internet, where the concept of a "[[telephone call|call]]" is generally hard to define, settlement-free [[peering]] and [[Internet transit]] are common forms of interconnection. A contract for interconnection within the Internet is usually called a [[peering agreement]].

Interconnect agreements are typically complex [[contractual agreement]]s involving payment schemes and schedules, coordination of [[Policy-based routing|routing policies]], [[acceptable use policy|acceptable use policies]], traffic balancing requirements, technical standards, coordination of network operations, dispute resolution, etc. Legal and regulatory requirements are often an issue. For example, network operators may be forced by law to interconnect with their competitors. In the United States, the [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]] mandated methods of interconnection and the compensation models for doing so.

'''Lew Bloom''' (August 8, 1859 &amp;ndash; December 12, 1929) was an American [[vaudeville]] performer and stage actor who popularized the comical [[tramp]] character. After retiring from the stage in the 1910s, he became a prolific [[art collector]] and [[Art dealer|dealer]] and also painted his own original works.

Decades after his death, art conservators discovered that Bloom was the perpetrator of an [[art forgery]] involving an oil portrait that he claimed depicted the wife of President [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[First Lady]] [[Mary Todd Lincoln]].

==Early life==
Bloom was born '''Ludwig Pflum''' in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] to Ludwig and Louisa (''née'' Moyer) Pflum. His parents, who immigrated from Germany, had six other children: Susannah, Susan Deborah, Louisa, Charles, Edward and Adolph (who died as a child). Bloom's father worked as a [[Cooper (profession)|cooper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Montgomery|first=Morton Luther |title=Historical and Biographical Annals of Berks County, Pennsylvania, Embracing a Concise History of the County and a Genealogical Record of Representative Families|year=1909|publisher=J.H. Beers &amp; Company|page=874}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family eventually moved to [[Reading, Pennsylvania]] where Bloom attended Poplar Street School. Around 1871, the family moved to [[Williamsburg, Pennsylvania|Williamsburg]] where Bloom began working as a [[jockey]]. In 1873, he joined the Potter Hart Colossus Circus where he performed a "bounding jockey act" in which he rode horses and performed [[acrobatics]]. During his time at the circus, "Ludwig Pflum" changed his name to "Lew Bloom" and would use that name for the remainder of his performing career.&lt;ref name="readingobit"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=19291213&amp;id=blExAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5uEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1702,2814709|title=Death Claims Originator Of Tramp Act|date=December 13, 1929|work=Reading Eagle|page=2|accessdate=March 1, 2015|location=Reading, Pennsylvania}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Early years===
Bloom spent several years touring in variety shows with his jockey act before relocating to [[Dover, Delaware]] where he competed in horse [[Match racing|match races]]. He then returned to Reading where he and a friend opened the Drovers' Hotel. The establishment was the first to introduce [[cabaret]] to Reading. Bloom performed song and dance acts at the hotel and also began competing as a [[Lightweight#Professional boxing|lightweight boxer]].&lt;ref name="readingobit"/&gt;

Bloom later became the [[stage manager]] for his friend's second establishment, The General Taylor Hotel. He left after two years to work as a [[clown]] in the Shelby, Pullman &amp; Hamilton Circus. After a year, Bloom returned to Reading where formed a partnership with vaudevillian Howard Monroe. The duo performed song and dance numbers and comedy skits in [[blackface]] until Bloom left the duo and went to New York to perform comedy as a solo act.&lt;ref name="readingobit"/&gt;

===Stage and vaudeville===
In 1885, Bloom was cast in the play ''Nobody's Claim'', followed by a role in ''The Red Spider'' in 1888. It was his role in the latter production where he first conceived of the [[tramp]] persona.&lt;ref name="readingobit"/&gt;&lt;ref name=DePastino157&gt;{{cite book|last=DePastino|first=Todd|title=Citizen Hobo: How a Century of Homelessness Shaped America|year=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0-226-14378-3|page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bloom's "Society Tramp" character was a philosophical, shabbily dressed homeless man who drank frequently and was generally treated poorly by other characters. Despite his lowly status, the tramp would make light of his predicament and maintained a positive and comicial outlook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Curtis|first=James|title=W.C. Fields: A Biography|year=2003|publisher=A.A. Knopf|isbn=0-375-40217-9|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Louvish|first=Simon|authorlink=Simon Louvish|title=Chaplin: The Tramp's Odyssey|year=2009|publisher=Faber &amp; Faber|isbn=0-571-23768-1|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kusmer"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kusmer|first=Kenneth L. |title=Down and Out, on the Road: The Homeless in American History|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-195-04778-8|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, tramp characters like Bloom's included slapstick comedy routines as well as dancing or [[pantomime]].&lt;ref name="kusmer"/&gt; One of Bloom's tramp character's jokes was, "I don't spend all my time in saloons. I can't. They have to close up some time."&lt;ref name=Slide56&gt;{{cite book|last=Slide|first=Anthony|authorlink=Anthony Slide|title=The Encyclopedia of Vaudeville|year=2012|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|isbn=978-1-61703-249-3|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bloom's tramp character became a big hit with audiences and was quickly copied by hundreds of other performers of the era including [[Nat M. Wills]] and Charles R. Sweet.&lt;ref name="readingobit"/&gt;&lt;ref name=DePastino157/&gt; [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[W. C. Fields]] also established long and successful stage and film careers portraying their version of the tramp persona.&lt;ref name=Glyn200&gt;{{cite book|last=Vincent|first=Glyn Vincent|title=he Unknown Night: The Genius and Madness of R. A. Blakelock, an American Painter|year=2003|publisher=Grove Press|isbn=0-802-14064-5|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bloom would later insist he originated the character and that he was "the first stage tramp in the business".&lt;ref name=DePastino157/&gt;

Bloom's stage career peaked in the 1890s.&lt;ref name=Slide56/&gt; Throughout the decade, he continued to portray tramps in various stage productions by [[Charles Hale Hoyt]] including ''A Black Sheep'', ''On the Bowery'', ''A Milk White Flag'', ''A Day and a Night'' and ''A Society Tramp''. After leaving Hoyt in 1892, Bloom and his wife (whom he married in 1892), known as "Miss Jane Cooper", toured the vaudeville circuit with their comedy act "A Picture of Life". Bloom played his usual tramp role while his wife played the comic foil - a "New England spinster" or a "city maiden."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=18990115&amp;id=y8AhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LZ0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6058,2644891|title=Bud Bloom, Reading, The Original Tramp|date=January 15, 1899|work=Reading Eagle|page=9|accessdate=March 1, 2015|location=Reading, Pennsylvania}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1909, Bloom's tramp persona had run its course and his career began to wane. At least one critic during that time said that Bloom had become "the worst act on the bill" of vaudeville shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Orpheum review|date=August 28, 1909|work=Goodwin's Weekly|page=8|location=Salt Lake City, Utah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
After retiring from performing in the late 1910s, Bloom lived in [[Mount Penn, Pennsylvania]] where he spent his time painting in his studio and collecting and dealing art.&lt;ref name="readingobit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="reading4"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=19070406&amp;id=DowtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lJsFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2175,549832&amp;hl=en|title=Paintings Of Lew Bloom Exhibited|date=April 6, 1907|work=Reading Eagle|page=4|accessdate=September 2, 2015|location=Reading, Pennsylvania}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began purchasing artwork during his stage career.&lt;ref name="readingobit"/&gt; Between 1889 and 1892, he purchased thirty to forty paintings from artist [[Ralph Albert Blakelock]].&lt;ref name=Glyn200/&gt; Upon his sister Susan's death in 1910, he inherited her art collection.&lt;ref name="brudereck"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.readingeagle.com/article.aspx?id=365893|title=Berks man bilked Honest Abe's kin?|last=Brudereck|first=Jason|date=February 18, 2012|publisher=readingeagle.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1907, Bloom exhibited seven pieces of his original works at the Reinhard Rieger Gallery in Mount Penn. The exhibition also included a copy of ''The Brooklet In the Meadow'', by Herman Rheudesela that Bloom painted (the original painting was also exhibited).&lt;ref name="reading4"/&gt;
Bloom later moved to New York and occasionally returned to his hometown of Reading to spend time with his family and attend [[Elks Club]] meetings. He also trained horses for Metropolitan Race Clubs in the New York and Pennsylvania area and in [[Cuba]].&lt;ref name="readingobit"/&gt;

==Death==
On December 10, 1929, Bloom was admitted to [[Bellevue Hospital]] in [[Manhattan, New York City]]. He died there two days later of "complication of diseases" at the age of 70.&lt;ref name="readingobit"/&gt; Bloom's funeral was held at the Seidel Funeral Chapel in Reading on December 16. He was buried at [[Charles Evans Cemetery]] the following morning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=19291215&amp;id=cFExAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5uEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2544,3326317|title=Lew Bloom To Be Buried Here|date=December 15, 1929|work=Reading Eagle|page=2|accessdate=March 1, 2015|location=Reading, Pennsylvania}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mary Todd Lincoln hoax==
In early 1929, Bloom made news when he announced that he had acquired a previously unknown oil portrait of former [[First Lady]] [[Mary Todd Lincoln]], the widow of slain president [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Bloom claimed shortly before President Lincoln was [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|assassinated on April 14, 1865]], Mary Lincoln commissioned painter [[Francis Bicknell Carpenter]] (who had lived at the [[White House]] for six months during Lincoln's presidency and had previously painted ''[[First Reading of the Emancipation Proclamation of President Lincoln]]'') to paint a portrait of her as gift to her husband. After the President's death, Bloom claimed that Mary Lincoln was unable to pay Carpenter for the painting and asked him to destroy it. According to Bloom, Carpenter kept the painting and eventually sold it to a wealthy Philadelphia shipbuilder named Jacob G. Neafie who was a great fan of President Lincoln's.&lt;ref name="cohen"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/arts/design/portrait-of-mary-todd-lincoln-is-deemed-a-hoax.html|title=Mrs. Lincoln, I Presume?

To validate his claim of the portrait's authenticity, Bloom attached a notarized [[affidavit]] to it and displayed the portrait at Milch Galleries in Manhattan. Shortly before his death in December 1929, he sold the portrait to President and Mary Lincoln's granddaughter [[Jessie Harlan Lincoln]], the daughter of the Lincolns' eldest and only surviving son [[Robert Todd Lincoln]].&lt;ref name="wetterich2"/&gt; The exact sale price is unknown, but is believed to be between $2,000 to $3,000 (approximately ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|2000|1929|r=-3}}}} to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|3000|1929|r=-3}}}} today).&lt;ref name="hageman"/&gt; The portrait was the subject of considerable media attention and was written about in the February 12, 1929 edition of the ''[[New York Times]]'' and the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. It was later mentioned in various books about the Lincolns, including [[Carl Sandburg]]'s 1932 biography ''Mary Lincoln: Wife and Widow''.&lt;ref name="cohen"/&gt;

In 1976, [[Robert Todd Lincoln Beckwith]], the last undisputed Lincoln descendant, donated the portrait to the Illinois State Historical Library (now known as the [[Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum]]). At the time, the portrait was estimated to be worth $400,000 (approximately ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|400000|1929|r=-3}}}} today). In 1978, art conservators at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] noted that the portrait had been "heavily retouched" and contained significant elements that were added after the original painting had been completed. After a partial [[Art restoration|restoration]], it was discovered that the facial area of the subject had been altered. The woman in the portrait was noted to have coloring that was brighter than the original 1929 portrait and that the face of the woman was "different, plainer" than Mary Todd Lincoln's.&lt;ref name="cohen"/&gt;  The conservators also discovered that the subject was wearing a [[cross necklace]] which Mary Lincoln would not have worn as she was not a  [[Roman Catholic]]. As the painting had been owned by the Lincoln family, the authenticity of the painting was not immediately questioned. The conservators that worked on the initial restoration reasoned that the added paint was likely the result of "heavy handed" retouches by other conservators or by Francis Bicknell Carpenter who was known to "fiddle with" his finished paintings.&lt;ref name="wetterich3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galesburg.com/article/20120214/News/302149994/?Start=3|title=Fake Mary Todd painting makes it even more famous|last=Wetterich|first=Chris|date=February 14, 2012|publisher=galesburg.com|page=3|accessdate=March 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of resemblance to the woman in the portrait to the real Mary Lincoln was rationalized as "artistic idealization". For the next 32 years, the portrait hung at the [[Illinois Executive Mansion]] in [[Springfield, Illinois]].&lt;ref name="cohen"/&gt;

In April 2010, art conservator Barry Bauman was hired to clean the portrait as it had accumulated dirt and grime after years of being displayed. Bauman also hoped to restore the portrait to its previous 1929 appearance. During the restoration, Bauman soon discovered that a layer of [[varnish]] sat on top of the paint indicating that someone had altered the original. After removing the varnish, Bauman discovered that the woman Bloom claimed was Mary Todd Lincoln was an unknown woman who bore no resemblance to the former First Lady. It was noted that the woman's coloring was "...much fresher, a much warmer, a much redder toned, flesh toned..." than the original painting depicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galesburg.com/article/20120214/News/302149994/?Start=1|title=Fake Mary Todd painting makes it even more famous|last=Wetterich|first=Chris|date=February 14, 2012|publisher=galesburg.com|pages=1–2|accessdate=March 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bauman also discovered that a [[brooch]] bearing the face of Abraham Lincoln worn by the subject covered a floral brooch. Bauman also inspected the signature of Francis Bicknell Carpenter and the date, both of which were added on top of the varnish layer. After comparing the signature to Carpenter's other paintings, the signature was deemed a forgery.&lt;ref name="wetterich2"/&gt;

After the portrait was completely restored, Bauman determined that while it had been painted in the 1860s (likely around 1864), the woman in the portrait was not Mary Todd Lincoln and the painting was not the work of Francis Bicknell Carpenter. The real subject of the portrait and the artist remain unknown.&lt;ref name="wetterich3"/&gt; Bauman also determined that Bloom, who also painted his own works, had likely altered the original portrait himself. Bauman also believed Bloom painted over the original portrait, forged Carpenter's name and created the fake affidavit.&lt;ref name="cohen"/&gt;  Bloom's claim that the portrait was given to his sister Susan by Jacob G. Neafie's daughter in appreciation of her care for the ailing Anna Neafie was proven to be false. Susan Bloom was born in 1855 and was only five years old when Anna Neafie died in 1860. James M. Cornelius, the curator of the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum, believes that Bloom was able to pull off the hoax because all the participants in his story were dead. Cornelius also believes that Bloom sought the Lincolns out to not only make money from the sale of the portrait but to legitimatize its authenticity. Bloom was likely aware that the surviving Lincolns were eager to portray Mary and her son Robert Todd Lincoln in a more sympathetic light after the family had received a great deal of negative publicity after Robert had his mother forcibly institutionalized in 1875.&lt;ref name="cohen"/&gt;

== Plot ==

The novel begins with a note from the author, which is an integral part of it. Unusually, the note describes entirely fictional events. It serves to establish and enforce one of the book's main themes: the relativity of truth.

''Life of Pi'' is subdivided into three sections:

===Part one===
In the first section, the main character, by the name of Piscine Patel, an adult [[Canadian]], reminisces about his childhood in [[India]]. His father owns a zoo in [[Puducherry district|Pondicherry]]. The livelihood provides the family with a relatively affluent lifestyle  and some understanding of [[animal psychology]].

The narrator describes how he acquired his full name, Piscine Molitor Patel, as a tribute to the [[Piscine Molitor|swimming pool in France]]. After hearing schoolmates tease him by transforming the first name into "Pissing", he establishes the short form of his name as "[[Pi]]" when he starts secondary school. The name, he says, pays tribute to the [[transcendental number]] which is the ratio of the [[circumference]] of a [[circle]] to its diameter.

In recounting his experiences, Pi describes several other unusual situations involving proper names: two visitors to the zoo, one a devout [[Muslim]], and the other a committed atheist, bear identical names; and a 450-pound [[Bengal tiger|tiger]] at the zoo bears the name Richard Parker as the result of a clerical error, in which human and animal names were reversed.&lt;ref&gt;Martel, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

Pi is raised as a [[Hindu]] who practices [[vegetarianism]]. At the age of fourteen, he investigates [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]], and decides to become an adherent of all three religions, much to his parents' dismay, saying he "just wants to love God."&lt;ref&gt;Martel, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bluerectangle.com/book_reviews/view_one_review/2077|title=''Life of Pi'' (review)|author=|date=|work=|publisher=|accessdate=2011-10-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529235852/http://bluerectangle.com/book_reviews/view_one_review/2077|archivedate=29 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He tries to  understand God through the lens of each religion, and comes to recognize benefits in each one.

A few years later in February 1976, during the period when Indian Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]] declares "[[The Emergency (India)|The Emergency]]", Pi's father decides to sell the zoo and immigrate with his wife and sons to Canada.

===Part two===
The second part of the novel begins with Pi's family aboard the ''Tsimtsum'', a [[Japan]]ese freighter that is transporting animals from their zoo to [[North America]]. A few days out of port from [[Manila]], the ship encounters a [[storm]] and sinks. Pi manages to escape in a small [[lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]], only to learn that the boat also holds a [[spotted hyena]], an injured [[Grant's zebra]], and an [[orangutan]] named Orange Juice. Much to the boy's distress, the hyena kills the zebra and then Orange Juice. A tiger has been hiding under the boat's [[tarpaulin]]: it's Richard Parker, who had boarded the lifeboat with ambivalent assistance from Pi himself some time before the hyena attack. Suddenly emerging from his hideaway, Richard Parker kills and eats the hyena.

Frightened, Pi constructs a small raft out of rescue flotation devices, tethers it to the bow of the boat and makes it his place of retirement. He begins [[Classic Conditioning|conditioning]] Richard Parker to take a submissive role by using food as a positive reinforcer, and seasickness as a punishment mechanism, while using a whistle for signals. Soon, Pi asserts himself as the alpha animal, and is eventually able to share the boat with his feline companion, admitting in the end that Richard Parker is the one who helped him survive his ordeal.

Pi recounts various events while adrift in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. At his lowest point, exposure renders him blind and unable to catch fish. In a state of [[delirium]], he talks with a marine "echo", which he initially identifies as Richard Parker having gained the ability to speak, but it turns out to be another blind castaway, a Frenchman, who boards the lifeboat with the intention of killing and eating Pi, but is immediately killed by Richard Parker.

Some time later, Pi's boat comes ashore on a floating island network of [[algae]] and inhabited by hundreds of thousands of [[meerkats]]. Soon, Pi and Richard Parker regain strength, but the boy's discovery of the [[carnivorous algae|carnivorous]] nature of the island's plant life forces him to return to the [[ocean]].

Two hundred and twenty-seven days after the ship's sinking, the lifeboat washes onto a beach in [[Mexico]], after which Richard Parker disappears into the nearby [[jungle]] without looking back, leaving Pi heartbroken at the abrupt farewell.

===Part three===
The third part of the novel describes a conversation between Pi and two officials from the Japanese Ministry of Transport, who are conducting an inquiry into the shipwreck. They meet him at the hospital in Mexico where he is recovering. Pi tells them his tale, but the officials reject it as unbelievable. Pi then offers them a second story in which he is adrift on a lifeboat not with zoo animals, but with the ship's cook, a [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] sailor with a broken leg, and his own mother. The cook amputates the sailor's leg for use as [[fishing bait]], then kills the sailor himself as well as Pi's mother for food, and soon he is killed by Pi, who dines on him.

The investigators note parallels between the two stories. They soon conclude that the hyena [[symbol]]izes the cook, the zebra the sailor, the orangutan Pi's mother, and the tiger represents Pi. Pi points out that neither story can be proven and neither explains the cause of the shipwreck, so he asks the officials which story they prefer: the one without animals or the one with animals. They eventually choose the story with the animals. Pi thanks them and says: "And so it goes with God." The investigators then leave and file a report.

== Major themes ==

===Life is a story===
''Life of Pi'', according to Yann Martel, can be summarized in three statements: "Life is a story... You can choose your story... A story with God is the better story."&lt;ref name="Yann Martel Interview"&gt;{{cite web|last=Renton|first=Jennie|title=Yann Martel Interview|publisher=Textualities|url=http://textualities.net/jennie-renton/yann-martel-interview/|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   A recurring theme throughout the novel seems to be believability. Pi at the end of the book asks the two investigators "If you stumble at mere believability, what are you living for?"&lt;ref name="Novel: Life of Pi"&gt;{{cite book|last=Martel|first=Yann|title=Life of Pi|year=2001|publisher=Knopf Canada|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Gordon Houser there are two main themes of the book: "that all life is interdependent, and that we live and breathe via belief."&lt;ref name="Gordon Houser"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Houser|first=Gordon|title=The Life of Pi|journal=The Christian Century|year=2003|volume=120|number=3|page=34+|url=http://www.christiancentury.org/reviews/2011-04/life-pi-yann-martel|accessdate=5 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Growth through adversity ===
PBS has described Martel's story as one of "personal growth through adversity."&lt;ref name=PBS&gt;{{cite web|title=Life of Pi' Author Reveals to PBS..org That The Inspiration For His Best-Selling Book And Now Hit Film Came From A Little Known Book About A Shipwrecked German Boy|url=http://community.nytimes.com/movie/442403/Life-Of-Pi/overview?Permid=27#comment27|accessdate=15 May 2013}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main character learns that "tigers are dangerous" at a young age when his father forces him to watch the zoo's Royal Bengal tiger patriarch, Mahisha, devour a live goat. Later, after he has been reduced to eking out a desperate existence on the lifeboat with the company of a fully grown tiger, Pi develops "alpha" qualities as he musters the strength, will and skills he needs to survive.&lt;ref name=PBS /&gt;

== Inspiration ==

In a 2002 interview with [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]], Martel said "I was sort of looking for a story, not only with a small 's' but sort of with a capital 'S'&amp;nbsp;– something that would direct my life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last= Martel |first= Yann |subjectlink= Yann Martel |title = Conversation: Life of PI| url = https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/entertainment-july-dec02-martel_11-11/ |interviewer= [[Ray Suarez]] |work= [[PBS NewsHour]] |publisher= [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] |date= 11 November 2002 |accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spoke of being lonely and needing direction in his life, and found that writing the novel met this need.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/article817994.ece |last=Martel |first=Yann |authorlink=Yann Martel | title = Triumph of a castaway adrift in the sea of his imagination |work=The Sunday Times |location=UK |accessdate=19 October 2010 |date=27 October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Richard Parker and shipwreck narratives===

The name of Martel's tiger, Richard Parker, was inspired by a character in [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s nautical adventure novel ''[[The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket]]'' (1838). In this book, Richard Parker is a mutineer who is stranded and eventually cannibalized on the hull of an overturned ship (and there is a dog aboard who is named Tiger).  The author also had in mind another occurrence of the name, in the famous legal case [[R v Dudley and Stephens]] (1884) where a shipwreck again results in the [[cannibalism]] of a cabin boy named Richard Parker, this time in a lifeboat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2012/07/nautical-coincidence-lifeboat-morality-richard-parker-and-the-mignonette/ Oldsaltblog.com]&lt;/ref&gt; A third Richard Parker drowned in the sinking of the ''Francis Spaight'' in 1846, described by author [[Jack London]], and later the cabin boy (not Richard Parker) was cannibalized.

Having read about these events, Yann Martel thought, "So many victimized Richard Parkers had to mean something."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.canongate.net/News/BehindLifeOfPi | title = Yann Martel on tigers, cannibals and Edgar Alan Poe |date=14 May 2002 |publisher=[[Canongate Books]] |accessdate=1 September 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080318173941/http://www.canongate.net/News/BehindLifeOfPi |archivedate=18 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&amp;docId=309590 | title = How Richard Parker Came to Get His Name |author=Martel, Yann |authorlink=Yann Martel |publisher=Amazon.com |accessdate=1 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moacyr Scliar===

Martel has mentioned that a book review he read of [[Brazilian people|Brazilian]] author [[Moacyr Scliar]]'s 1981 novella ''[[Max and the Cats]]'' accounts in part for his novel's premise. Scliar's story describes a [[German Jews|Jewish-German]] refugee crossing the Atlantic Ocean with a [[jaguar]] in his boat.&lt;ref name="powells"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.powells.com/fromtheauthor/martel.html |title=From the Author&amp;nbsp;– Yann Martel&amp;nbsp;– Powell's Books |publisher=Powells.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130114040757/http://www.powells.com/fromtheauthor/martel.html |archivedate=14 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/11/books/books-of-the-times-fleeing-the-nazis-with-a-jaguar-that-may-be-real.html | title = Books of The Times; Fleeing the Nazis With a Jaguar That May Be Real | last=Mitgang | first=Herbert | authorlink=Herbert Mitgang |date=11 July 1990 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=2 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scliar said that he was perplexed that Martel "used the idea without consulting or even informing me," and indicated that he was reviewing the situation before deciding whether to take any action in response.&lt;ref name="Rohter furor"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/06/books/tiger-in-a-lifeboat-panther-in-a-lifeboat-a-furor-over-a-novel.html?pagewanted=all | title = Tiger in a Lifeboat, Panther in a Lifeboat: A Furor Over a Novel |last=Rohter |first= Larry |authorlink=Larry Rohter |date=11 July 1990 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=2 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://veja.abril.com.br/061102/p_128.html Veja.abril.com]&lt;/ref&gt; After talking with Martel, Scliar elected not to pursue the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |first=Moacyr |last=Scliar |subjectlink=Moacyr Scliar |interviewer=Eleanor Wachtel |title=Writers &amp; Company |publisher=CBC Radio 1 |date=16 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A dedication to Scliar "for the spark of life" appears in the author's note of ''Life of Pi''. Literary reviews have described the similarities between ''Life of Pi'' and ''Max and the Cats'' as superficial. Reviewer Peter Yan wrote: "Reading the two books side-by-side, one realizes how inadequate bald plot summaries are in conveying the unique imaginative impact of each book,"&lt;ref name="BooksInCanada"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.booksincanada.com/article_view.asp?id=4377 |title=Review |publisher=Books in Canada |date= |accessdate=2012-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and noted that Martel's distinctive narrative structure is not found in Scliar's novella. The themes of the books are also dissimilar, with ''Max and the Cats'' being an [[allegory]] for [[Nazism]].&lt;ref name="SLC volue 29"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journals.hil.unb.ca/index.php/scl/article/view/12746/13689 |title="Hollow at the core": Deconstructing Yann Martel’s Life of Pi &amp;#124; Stratton &amp;#124; Studies in Canadian Literature / Études en littérature canadienne |publisher=Journals.hil.unb.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Life of Pi'', 211 of 354 pages are devoted to Pi's experience in the lifeboat, compared to ''Max and the Cats'', in which 17 of its 99 pages depict time spent in a lifeboat.&lt;ref name="SLC volue 29" /&gt;

== Narrative structure ==
According to the reviewer Peter Yan,
&lt;blockquote&gt;'Life of Pi' is told from two alternating points of view, the main character Pi in a flashback and Yann Martel himself, who is the "visiting writer" (Martel 101) interviewing Pi many years after the tiger in the boat story. This technique of the intrusive narrator adds the documentary realism to the book, setting up, like a musical counter-point, the myth-making, [[unreliable narrator]], Pi. The reader is left to ponder at the end whether Pi's story is an allegory of another set of parallel events.&lt;ref name="BooksInCanada"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Setting ==
The novel is a work of fiction set in the summer of 1977 that draws on places and historical events in India. The Patel Family's discussions of the political situation refer to [[The Emergency (India)|the Emergency]] period of the mid-1970s, when [[Indira Gandhi]]'s administration ruled by decree, curtailed press freedoms, and imprisoned political opponents. Pondicherry is a former French colony in India. It does have an [[Indian Coffee House]] and [[Botanical garden|Botanical Gardens]]. The Botanical Garden had a zoo in 1977 but did not have any animals bigger than a deer. [[Munnar]], the destination for the Patel family's vacation, is a small but popular hill station in [[Kerala]]. [[Madurai]], also referenced in the novel, is a popular tourist and pilgrimage site in [[Tamil Nadu]].

== Characters ==

=== Piscine Molitor "Pi" Patel ===
{{Quote box | align = right | width = 27em | border = 1px | quoted = true | quote = He acquires layer after layer of diverse spirituality and brilliantly synthesizes it into a personal belief system and devotional life that is breathtaking in its depth and scope.

Piscine Molitor Patel, known to all as just "Pi", is the narrator and protagonist of the novel. He was named after a [[Piscine Molitor|swimming pool in Paris]], despite the fact that neither his mother nor his father particularly liked swimming. The story is told as a narrative from the perspective of a middle-aged Pi, now married with his own family, and living in Canada. At the time of main events of the story, he is sixteen years old. He recounts the story of his life and his 227-day journey on a lifeboat when his ship sinks in the middle of the Pacific Ocean during a voyage to North America.

=== Richard Parker ===
[[File:Panthera tigris7.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Bengal tiger]]]]

Richard Parker is a royal Bengal tiger who is stranded on the lifeboat with Pi when the ship sinks. Richard Parker lives on the lifeboat with Pi and is kept alive with the food and water Pi delivers. Richard Parker develops a relationship with Pi that allows them to coexist in their struggle.

In the novel, a hunter named Richard Parker is hired to kill a panther thought to have killed seven people within two months. Instead, he accidentally immobilizes a female Bengal tiger with tranquilizer darts while her cub escapes hiding in a bush. Parker names the cub Thirsty after his enthusiasm when drinking from a nearby river. The paperwork that accompanies the shipment of the two tigers to Pi's family's zoo in Pondicherry states that the cub's name is "Richard Parker" and the hunter's given name is "Thirsty" and his surname is "None Given", due to a mix-up with the names. Pi's father finds the story so amusing that they continue to call the tiger "Richard Parker".

== Reception ==

Brian Bethune of ''[[Maclean's]]'' describes ''Life of Pi'' as a "head-scratching combination of dense religious allegory, zoological lore and enthralling adventure tale, written with warmth and grace".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www2.macleans.ca/2010/04/13/the-missing-half-of-his-new-novel | title = The missing half of Yann Martel's new novel: His plan for his long-awaited follow-up to 'Life of Pi' didn't quite work out |author=Bethune, Brian |date=13 April 2010 |publisher=[[Maclean's]] |accessdate=31 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Master Plots'' suggested that the "central themes of ''Life of Pi'' concern religion and human faith in God".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Cockeram | first = Paul | title = Life of Pi | journal = Master Plots 4 edition | pages = 1–3 | date = November 2010 | url = | issn = | id = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Life of Pi.|journal=The Review of Contemporary Fiction|year=2003|volume=23|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gary Krist of ''[[The New York Times]]'' praised the book, but added that at times Martel "pushes the didactic agenda of his story too hard."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/07/books/taming-the-tiger.html|title=Taming the Tiger|last=Krist|first=Gary|date=2002-07-07|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-03-07|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[U.S. President]] [[Barack Obama]] wrote a letter directly to Martel, describing ''Life of Pi'' as "an elegant proof of God, and the power of storytelling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/entertainment/books/life-of-pi-author-martel-hears-from-obama-90198067.html|title=Life of Pi author Martel hears from Obama|date=8 April 2010|work=[[Saskatoon StarPhoenix]]|publisher=[[Winnipeg Free Press]]|accessdate=6 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7353">{{Culture of Peru}}
The '''Music Of Peru''' is an amalgamation of sounds and styles drawing on  [[Peru]]'s [[Andean music|Andean]], [[Music of Spain|Spanish]], and [[Music of Africa|African]] roots. Andean influences can perhaps be best heard in wind instruments and the shape of the melodies, while the African influences can be heard in the rhythm and percussion instruments, and European influences can be heard in the harmonies and stringed instruments. [[Pre-Columbian era|Pre-Columbian]] Andean music was played on drums and wind instruments, not unlike the European [[pipe and tabor]] tradition. Andean tritonic and pentatonic scales were elaborated during the colonial period into hexatonic, and in some cases, diatonic scales.

==History==
{{expand section|date=January 2014}}
[[Image:Yma Sumac in Italy.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Yma Sumac]] Stories published in the 1950s claimed that she was an Incan princess, directly descended from Atahualpa.]]
The earliest printed [[polyphonic music]] in Peru, indeed anywhere in the Americas, was "[[Hanacpachap cussicuinin]]," composed or collected by [[Juan Pérez Bocanegra]] and printed in 1631.&lt;ref name="Listen"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kerman|first1=Joseph |authorlink1=Joseph Kerman|last2=Tomlinson|first2=Gary |authorlink2=Gary Tomlinson|last3=Kerman|first3=Vivian|title=Listen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ro2l-vP9tUC|accessdate=July 2014|edition=6th|year=2007|publisher=[[Bed-St. Martin's]]|location=Boston|isbn=0-312-43419-7|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instruments==

===Stringed instruments===
Peruvian music is dominated by the national [[musical instrument|instrument]], the [[charango]].  The charango is member of the [[lute]] family of instruments and was invented during the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] by musicians imitating the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[vihuela]].  In the [[Canas, Peru|Canas]] and [[Titicaca]] regions, the charango is used in courtship rituals, symbolically invoking [[mermaid]]s with the instrument to lure the woman to the male performers.  Until the 1960s, the charango was denigrated as an instrument of the rural poor.  After the revolution in 1959, which built upon the [[Indigenismo]] movement (1910&amp;ndash;1940), the charango was popularized among other performers. Variants include the [[walaycho]], [[chillador]], [[chinlili]], and the larger and lower-tuned [[charangon]].

While the Spanish [[guitar]] is widely played, so too is the Spanish-in-origin [[bandurria]]. Unlike the guitar, it has been transformed by Peruvian players over the years, changing from a 12-string, 6-course instrument to one having 12 to 16 strings in a mere 4 courses. [[Violins]] and [[harps]], also of European origin, are also played.

===Percussion instruments===
The [[cajón]] is an important percussion instrument developed by African slaves. People imply the [[cowbell (instrument)|cowbell]] may also be of African origin. While the rhythms played on them are often African-influenced, some percussive instruments are of non-African origin. For example, of European origin is the [[Bass drum|bombo]], and of Andean origin are the [[wankara]] and [[tinya]] respectively.

===Wind instruments===
In addition to the [[ocarina]] and [[waqra phuku]], there are Peruvian wind instruments of two basic types, [[panpipes]] and [[flutes]], both of Native Andean origin and built to play [[tritonic]], [[pentatonic]] and [[hexatonic]] scales, though some contemporary musicians play instruments designed to play European [[diatonic]] scales. Of the former variety, there are the [[Siku (instrument)|siku]] (or ''zampoña'') and [[Antara (instrument)|antara]]. Of the latter variety, there are the [[pinkillu]], [[tarka (flute)|tarka]], and [[quena]] (qina) flutes.

Each [[companion dog]] is rescued in connection with local [[Animal welfare|animal rescue]] groups. They are then given basic [[obedience training]] and any additional training that will help them assimilate into their new lives and then finally placed in their "forever" home.

According to the [[ASPCA]], every year between 6 and 8 million dogs and cats are abandoned at [[Animal shelter|shelters]] in the United States.

Pets can increase your opportunities for exercise and [[Outdoor activity|outdoor activities]] and opportunities for [[socialization]]. Caring for a pet encourages responsibility and adherence to a daily schedule.

Pets for Vets developed a program focusing on addressing these issues by bringing together animals needing to be rescued and veterans needing a companion for a better [[quality of life]]. Not every veteran qualifies for a [[psychiatric]] [[service dog]], however everyone who wants one can benefit from a companion or pet animal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14845">[[File:Pit-Interior of Teatro La Fenice-Venice.jpg|400px|thumb|The pit of [[La Fenice]]]]  
A '''pit orchestra''' is a type of [[orchestra]] that accompanies performers in [[musicals]], [[operas]], [[ballet]]s, and other shows involving music. The terms was also used for orchestras accompanying [[silent movies]] when more than a piano was used.&lt;ref&gt; Mervyn Cooke, ''A History of Film Music'' Cambridge Univ. Press, 2008 {{ISBN|978-0-521-81173-6}}. pp. 18–21&lt;/ref&gt;  In performances of [[opera]]s and [[ballet]]s, the pit orchestra is typically similar in size to a [[symphony orchestra]], though it may contain smaller string and brass sections, depending upon the piece.  Such orchestras may vary in size from approximately 30 musicians (early Baroque and Classical opera) to as many as 90–100 musicians (Wagnerian opera). However, because of financial, space, and volume concerns, the [[musical theatre]] pit orchestra in the 2000s is considerably smaller (at most 20–30 musicians, including not more than ten [[string instruments|string players]]).

==Description==
Typically, pit orchestras play in a lowered area in front of the stage called an [[orchestra pit]]. Inside the pit, the [[conductor (music)|conductor]] stands facing towards the stage with his or her back towards the audience to coordinate the music with the vocals and actions of the [[singing|singers]], [[dancing|dancers]] and [[acting|actors]], while the orchestra sits facing the conductor. The conductor may also sit at one or more keyboards and conduct as well as play, which often means the use of more head and facial gestures rather than hand gestures.  This is often the case when a show only requires a small orchestra, or on national tours, where the instrumentation is often reduced from the original arrangement and one or two keyboard players substitute for several instruments. In some cases, theatres do not have a pit; in this case, the pit orchestra may play in a room near the stage, watching the conductor's gestures using a video monitor.  

Music parts for pit orchestra [[woodwind]] players in musical theatre are normally divided into "reed books". Orchestration varies with each show based on the type of music that will be performed, such as jazz, classical, or blues. For example, a Reed 1 Book may contain music for piccolo, flute, Eb alto saxophone, Bb clarinet, and/or oboe. A musician handed a reed book would be expected to play each part. Because the musician plays so many different instruments, he or she is referred to as a "doubler" (even though the Reed Books may have up to eight instruments each).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bretpimentel.com/doubling/shows/showsfaq.php|title=Woodwind doubling in Broadway musicals FAQ|accessdate=26 December 2008|author=Bret Pimentel}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Musicians who play in pit orchestras are not only required to play multiple instruments at times, but they must also be familiar and able to play in multiple keys, styles, and tempos and make a switch instantaneously. The orchestration for a musical is written in a key best suited to range of the singer. Some keys are more difficult to play in than others because of the increased attention that greater amounts of sharps and flats require. Musicals also tend to have a number of styles which can range from a soulful ballad to a syncopated funk tune to a driving hard rock song. Many musicians have been trained to play in a certain style, such as classical music, but in order to play in pit orchestras, musicians must be able to play a range of different styles. Because musicals are live, many elements can change from show to show;  pit orchestra musicians consequently should be able to play different tempos every night and even skip through their music to a new spot if an actor or singer makes an error.

==Preparation==

As with any orchestra or similar ensemble, a pit orchestra rehearses with the singers and dancers before the public performances commence. The rehearsals are led by the [[conducting|conductor]]/[[music director]], who sets the tempos, starts the songs and musical interludes and indicates pauses and endings of sections.

Although members of a pit orchestra are not required to demonstrate great stage presence, and they may work out of sight from much of the audience, they can generally be seen from the balcony seats and are thus required to adhere to standard rules of dress and appearance (e.g., formal clothes) &lt;ref&gt;Karen A. Hagberg. ''Stage presence from head to toe: a manual for musicians''. 2003 p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

Preparation by musicians in a pit orchestra consists of much more than attending rehearsals. Before the first rehearsal, ensemble musicians individually practice their parts, particularly difficult sections (rapid passages, very high or low-register sections) and exposed passages (e.g., instrumental solos). Performers often listen to a recording of the show to learn the tempos and playing styles, particularly if there are sections where the pit orchestra has complex parts which depend on the onstage actors or singers' parts (e.g., a big orchestra chord might have to coincide with the firing of a prop gun onstage).

==Size==
Pit orchestras can range from large orchestras to small rock combos (e.g., guitar/keyboards/bass/drums). While a pit orchestra usually plays in the orchestra pit, there are times when they are on stage in the background (this is usually for rock musicals). In some cases, one or more members of the pit orchestra may have to appear in costume on stage with their instrument and play music as part of a scene. Below are pit orchestra examples from five major theatrical license companies: [[Music Theatre International]], [[Tams-Witmark]], [[Samuel French, Inc.]], Rodgers and Hammerstein Theatricals, and Theatrical Rights Worldwide (excluding any conductor scores unless needed). These show the varying sizes of pit orchestras. Note that string parts are often written with the intent of having two musicians play a specific part, especially in older musicals.

In the 2000s, due to budget constraints, some musicals have replaced instruments from musical arrangements with keyboards. For example, instead of hiring a small [[string section]], a musical may hire one or two [[synthesizer]] players to perform the string parts or the horn parts. Some musicals have used prerecorded [[backing track]] music for shows, which has led to controversy.

Cases of [[child prostitution]] are known and prosecuted, however no measures are taken to [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitate]] these juveniles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gvnet.com/childprostitution/Lebanon.htm Child Prostitution – Lebanon]. Gvnet.com.

[[Sex trafficking]] is a problem in the Lebanon.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

==Overview==
Street prostitution occurs in the country, the prostitutes are mainly Lebanese or Syrian.&lt;ref name="executive" /&gt; Prostitution also occurs in 'bars', especially in the [[Hamra, Beirut|Hamra]] area of [[Beirut]] and in [[Maameltein]]. The bars are licensed, but not for prostitution. They usually have 'secret' rooms at the back and the women, mostly Egyptians, Syrians and Sudanese, are controlled by a "Mom". They keep their liquor licenses and a blind eye is turned to the illegal activities because of bribes to the police.&lt;ref name="executive" /&gt;

Some Lebanese prostitutes work independently from hotels or rented apartments.&lt;ref name="executive" /&gt;

[[Male prostitution]] is on the rise in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Streib|first1=Matthew|title=Living outside of society: Palestinian refugee rentboys in the Lebanon|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2006/07/17/living-outside-of-society-palestinian-refugee-rentboys-in-the-lebanon/|website=PinkNews|accessdate=23 January 2018|format=17 July 2006,}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Du Verdie|first1=Paul|title=Male prostitution on the rise in Lebanon|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/02/male-prostitution-rise-lebanon-201425114310918216.html|website=Aljazeera|accessdate=23 January 2018|date=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Super night clubs===
Super night clubs serve as places of introduction between prostitutes and clients. The clients may chat with an 'artiste' if they buy a bottle of [[champagne]]. During the chat a 'date' may be arranged for the next day. No sexual services are permitted on the premises, and the woman negotiates her own price for the 'date'.&lt;ref name="executive" /&gt;

The clubs operate with the implicit consent of the [[Sûreté Générale]] (General Directorate of General Security), who set strict regulations. The women working in the clubs must be foreign nationals, Lebanese women are not allowed in the clubs. The migrant women must have a contract to enter the country, and are issued with an 'artiste' visa, to which strict conditions are attached.&lt;ref name="executive" /&gt;&lt;ref name="foreign"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anderson|first1=Sulome|title=Sex for Sale in Beirut|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2012/02/09/sex-for-sale-in-beirut/|website=Foreign Policy|accessdate=24 January 2018|language=en|date=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The women must be at the club between 8pm to 5am, Sûreté or police may enter the club at any time to check the artistes are all present. The women must live in a hotel room, often adjacent to or in the same building as the club. They must be in the hotel between finishing work (5am) until 1pm. After 1pm they may leave the hotel on a 'date'. The telephone number and car registration number of the client must be recorded when the women leave the hotel.&lt;ref name="executive" /&gt;&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

There are about 130 clubs, mainly in Maameltein. A lot of the women working in them are of East European and North African origin.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt; 11,284 women entered Lebanon under the 'artiste' program in 2016, more than double the number of women that entered under this program in 2015.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt; Their artiste visas do not exceed six months, and they are deported if they are caught overstaying their visa.&lt;ref name="US state"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2008/nea/119120.htm|title=2008 Human Rights Report: Lebanon|date=2009-02-25|website=Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor|publisher=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=20 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1931, whilst the country was under French control,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stmaron.org/marhist11.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060629110712/http://stmaron.org/marhist11.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=29 June 2006 |title=Aspects of Maronite History (Part Eleven) The twentieth century in Western Asia |author=Beggiani, Chorbishop Seely |publisher=Stmaron.org |access-date=17 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a new law regulated prostitution. Prostitutes needed to be registered and were only allowed to work in licensed brothels. To obtain a licence they had to be over 21, not be a [[virgin]] and have undergone a medical examination. The law criminalised working anywhere else. It also criminalised anybody facilitating working outside licence requirements.&lt;ref name="spl" /&gt;

At the start of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1975, all of the licensed brothels were located near [[Martyrs' Square, Beirut|Martyrs' Square]] in the Zeitoun district of downtown Beirut. All these brothels were destroyed during the fighting.&lt;ref name="executive" /&gt; No licences have been issued since to prostitutes or brothels.&lt;ref name="spl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="executive" /&gt;&lt;ref name="foreign" /&gt;

As a result of licences not being issued, brothels operated illegally until a new law was passed in 1998 criminalising businesses making rooms available for commercial sex.&lt;ref name="spl" /&gt;

The "super night clubs" were originally regular night clubs catering to the tourist trade in the 1960s. They closed down during the Civil War, and after the end of the war there were insufficient tourists to make them viable. The business model was changed to its current format and the clubs reopened.&lt;ref name="executive" /&gt;

==Syrian Civil War==
The [[Civil War in Syria]] has led to an influx of Syrian refugees into the sex trade in Lebanon. Syrian women and girls are highly vulnerable to sex trafficking.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt; Some adult refugee women have been coerced into prostitution. A forced prostitution ring, run by a Syrian pimp, was dismantled in 2016 by Lebanese police, which raided the ''Chez Maurice'' and ''le Silver'' brothels, both located in the Maameltein, known for its red-light district.&lt;ref name="lemonde"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/proche-orient/article/2016/07/30/les-refugiees-syriennes-au-liban-proies-des-proxenetes_4976500_3218.html|title=Les réfugiées syriennes au Liban, proies des proxénètes|date=30 July 2016|website=Le Monde|accessdate=11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the women and girls were recruited from Syria with false promises of work and subjected to commercial sexual exploitation where they experienced mental, physical, and sexual abuse and forced abortions.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in Lebanon}}
Lebanon is a source and destination country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking and a transit country for Eastern European women and children subjected to sex trafficking in other Middle Eastern countries. Women from Eastern Europe and North Africa enter Lebanon to work in the adult entertainment industry through Lebanon’s artiste visa program, which sustains a significant commercial sex industry and enables sex trafficking. Some women from East and West Africa are subjected to sex trafficking in Lebanon.&lt;ref name="state17"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lebanon 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2017/271225.htm|website=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=24 January 2018}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Syrian women and girls are highly vulnerable to sex trafficking. Syrian girls are brought to Lebanon for sex trafficking, sometimes through the guise of early marriage. Lebanese pimps coerce some Syrian LGBTI refugees into prostitution.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

The 2011 anti-trafficking law prohibits all forms of human trafficking. Prescribed penalties for sex trafficking range from five to 15 years imprisonment, which are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

In 2016, the internal security forces (ISF) anti-trafficking unit investigated 20 cases of suspected trafficking, involving 87 victims of sexual exploitation and child trafficking, and referred 26 suspected traffickers to the judiciary. The directorate of general security (DGS) investigated 14 potential trafficking cases involving artiste visa holders and four were referred to judicial or law enforcement authorities for further investigation.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks Lebanon as a '[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 2]]' country.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

Music training has been shown to help improve intellectual development and ability, though no connection has been found as to how it affects emotion regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schellenberg|first=Glen E.|author2=Mankarious, Monika |title=Music training and emotion comprehension in childhood|journal=Emotion|date=October 2012|volume=12|issue=5|pages=887–891|doi=10.1037/a0027971|pmid=22642351}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Numerous studies have been conducted to show that individual personality can have an effect on music preference, mostly using personality, though a recent meta-analysis has shown that personality in itself explains little variance in music preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schäfer|first=Thomas|last2=Mehlhorn|first2=Claudia|title=Can personality traits predict musical style preferences?

== Personality and music preference ==

===Personality===
Various questionnaires have been created to both measure the big five personality traits and musical preferences. The majority of studies attempting to find the correlation between personality and musical preferences administered questionnaires to measure both traits.&lt;ref name="Zwiegenhaft"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zweigenhaft|first=Richard L.|title=A Do Re Mi Encore|journal=Journal of Individual Differences|date=1 January 2008|volume=29|issue=1|pages=45–55|doi=10.1027/1614-0001.29.1.45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="premuzic furnham freixanet muro"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chamorro-Premuzic|first=Tomas|author2=Gomà-i-Freixanet, Montserrat |author3=Furnham, Adrian |author4= Muro, Anna |title=Personality, self-estimated intelligence, and uses of music: A Spanish replication and extension using structural equation modeling.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2009|volume=3|issue=3|pages=149–155|doi=10.1037/a0015342}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="premuzic fagan furnham"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chamorro-Premuzic|first=Tomas|author2=Fagan, Patrick |author3=Furnham, Adrian |title=Personality and uses of music as predictors of preferences for music consensually classified as happy, sad, complex, and social.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2010|volume=4|issue=4|pages=205–213|doi=10.1037/a0019210}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Premuzic Swami Furnham Maakip"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chamorro-Premuzic|first=Tomas|author2=Swami, Viren|author3=Furnham, Adrian|author4=Maakip, Ismail|date=1 January 2009|title=The Big Five Personality Traits and Uses of Music|journal=Journal of Individual Differences|volume=30|issue=1|pages=20–27|doi=10.1027/1614-0001.30.1.20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kopacz"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kopacz|first=Malgorzata|title=Personality and music preferences: The influence of personality traits on preferences regarding musical elements|journal=Journal of Music Therapy|year=2005|volume=42|issue=3|pages=216–239|doi=10.1093/jmt/42.3.216}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Langmeyer rudan tarnai"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Langmeyer|first=Alexandra|author2=Guglhör-Rudan, Angelika |author3=Tarnai, Christian |title=What Do Music Preferences Reveal About Personality?|journal=Journal of Individual Differences|date=1 January 2012|volume=33|issue=2|pages=119–130|doi=10.1027/1614-0001/a000082}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rentfrow gosling 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rentfrow|first=Peter J.|author2=Gosling, Samuel D. |title=The do re mi's of everyday life: The structure and personality correlates of music preferences.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1 January 2003|volume=84|issue=6|pages=1236–1256|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.84.6.1236|pmid=12793587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others used questionnaires to determine personality traits, and then asked participants to rate musical excerpts on scales such as liking, perceived complexity, emotions felt, and more.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bonneville-Roussy|first=Arielle|last2=Rentfrow|first2=Peter J.|last3=Xu|first3=Man K.|last4=Potter|first4=Jeff|title=Music through the ages: Trends in musical engagement and preferences from adolescence through middle adulthood.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0033770|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|language=en|volume=105|issue=4|pages=703–717|doi=10.1037/a0033770}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ladinig schellenberg"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ladinig|first=Olivia|author2=Schellenberg, E.

In general, the plasticity traits (openness to experience and extraversion) affect music preference more than the stability traits (agreeableness, neuroticism, and conscientiousness),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miranda|first=Dave |author2=Morizot, Julien |author3=Gaudreau, Patrick|title=Personality Metatraits and Music Preferences in Adolescence: A Pilot Study|journal=International Journal of Adolescence and Youth|date=27 March 2012|volume=15|issue=4|pages=289–301|doi=10.1080/02673843.2010.9748036}}&lt;/ref&gt; but each trait is still worth discussing. The personality traits have also been shown to correlate significantly with the emotional effect music has on people. Individual personality differences can help predict the emotional intensity and valence derived from music.&lt;ref name="Vuoskoski"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vuoskoski|first=Jonna K.|author2=Eerola, Tuomas |title=Measuring music-induced emotion: A comparison of emotion models, personality biases, and intensity of experiences|journal=Musicae Scientiae|date=13 July 2011|volume=15|issue=2|pages=159–173|doi=10.1177/1029864911403367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Openness to experience ====

Of all the traits, openness to experience has been shown to have the greatest effect upon genre preference.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Zwiegenhaft /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nusbaum 199–204"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nusbaum|first=E.

One study looking at how personality traits affect music-induced emotion found that of all the traits, openness to experience was the best predictor of higher emotionally intense reactions to sad and slow music.  The most common feelings described from sad music were nostalgia, peacefulness, and wonder, and openness to experience correlated positively with all these feelings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vuoskoski|first=Jonna K.|author2=Thompson, William F. |author3=McIlwain, Doris |author4=Eerola, Tuomas |title=Who enjoys listening to sad music and why?|journal=Music Perception|date=February 2012|volume=29|issue=3|pages=311–317|doi=10.1525/mp.2012.29.3.311}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sad music has also been theorized to allow for greater experience of aesthetic experiences and beauty.&lt;ref name="Vuoskoski thompson" /&gt;  Furthermore, open individuals show a preference for diverse musical styles, but do not prefer popular forms of contemporary music, indicating that there are limits to this openness.&lt;ref name="Rawlings ciancarelli" /&gt; However, this is only true up to a certain point, as another study looked at music's ability to produce "chills" in the listeners.  Although this study found that openness was the best predictor of genre preference, there is no way to use openness to experience to predict who gets chills from music.  Instead, the only measure for that was frequency of listening to music and the self-rated value of the importance of music in one's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nusbaum|first=Emily C.|author2=Silvia, Paul J. |title=Shivers and Timbres: Personality and the Experience of Chills From Music|journal=Social Psychological and Personality Science|date=7 October 2010|volume=2|issue=2|pages=199–204|doi=10.1177/1948550610386810}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study examined how openness to experience and frequency of listening are related and how they affect music preference.  While listening to classical music excerpts, those rated high in openness tended to decrease in liking music faster during repeated listenings, as opposed to those scoring low in openness, who tended to like music more with repeated plays.  This suggests novelty in music is an important quality for people high in openness to experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hunter|first=Patrick G|author2=Schellenberg, Glen E. |title=Interactive effects of personality and frequency of exposure on liking for music|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|date=20 October 2010|volume=50|pages=175–179|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2010.09.021|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study had people take a personality test before and after listening to classical music with and without written lyrics in front of them.  Both the music with and without lyrics showed some effect at actually changing people's self-rated personality traits, most significantly in terms of openness to experience, which showed some significant increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Djikic|first=Maja|title=The effect of music and lyrics on personality|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=August 2011|volume=5|issue=3|pages=237–240|doi=10.1037/a0022313}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead of personality affecting music preference, here classical music altered the assessment of their own personalities and make people assess themselves as more open.

Openness to experience is also positively correlated with intellectual or cognitive use of music, which means that this individual enjoys analyzing complex musical compositions.&lt;ref name="premuzic fagan furnham" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Premuzic Swami Furnham Maakip" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rentfrow gosling 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Premuzic furnham freixanet muro" /&gt; Furthermore, individuals more open prefer a greater number of melodic themes in a work of music.&lt;ref name="Steele young"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Steele|first=Anita|author2=Young, Sylvester |title=A descriptive study of myers-briggs personality types of professional music educators and music therapists with comparisons to undergraduate majors|journal=Journal of Music Therapy|year=2011|volume=48|issue=1|pages=55–73|doi=10.1093/jmt/48.1.55|pmid=21866713}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kopacz /&gt;

==== Conscientiousness ====
Conscientiousness is negatively correlated with intense and rebellious music, such as rock and heavy metal music.&lt;ref name="Langmeyer rudan tarnai" /&gt; While previous studies have found a relationship between conscientiousness and emotional regulation, these results do not apply cross culturally—specifically, researchers did not find this relationship in Malaysia.&lt;ref name="Premuzic Swami Furnham Maakip" /&gt;

==== Extraversion ====

Extraversion is another good predictor of music genre preference and music use.  Energetic extroverts have been linked to preferences in happy, upbeat and conventional music, as well as energetic and rhythmic music, such as rap, hip hop, soul, electronic, and dance music.&lt;ref name="premuzic fagan furnham" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Langmeyer rudan tarnai" /&gt;  Additionally, extroverts tend to listen to music more and have background music present in their lives more often.&lt;ref name="ChamorroPremuzic2010" /&gt; One study compared introverts and extroverts to see who would be more easily distracted by background music with and without lyrics.  It was assumed that since extroverts listen to background music more they would be able to tune it out better, but that was proved untrue.  No matter how much music people listen to they are still equally affected and distracted by music with lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Avila|first=Christina |author2=Furnham, Adrian |author3=McClelland, Alastair|title=The influence of distracting familiar vocal music on cognitive performance of introverts and extraverts|journal=Psychology of Music|date=9 November 2011|volume=40|issue=1|pages=84–93|doi=10.1177/0305735611422672}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cheerful music with fast tempos, many melodic themes, and vocals are also preferred by extroverts.&lt;ref name="Rentfrow gosling 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kopacz /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown 18" /&gt; They are more likely than others to listen to music in the background while doing other activities, such as running, being with friends, or studying.&lt;ref name="Premuzic furnham freixanet muro" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Premuzic Swami Furnham Maakip" /&gt;&lt;ref name="premuzic fagan furnham" /&gt; This group also tends to use music to counter the monotony of everyday tasks, such as ironing.&lt;ref name="Premuzic Swami Furnham Maakip" /&gt;  In a Turkish study, researchers found that extroverts preferred rock, pop, and rap because these genres facilitated dance and movement.

Another study examined music teachers and music therapists, assuming that people who like and study music would be more extroverted.  The results showed that music teachers were definitely higher in extraversion than the general public.  Music therapists were also higher on extraversion than introversion, though they scored significantly lower than the teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Steele|first=Anita Louise|author2=Young, Sylvester |title=A descriptive study of Myers-Briggs personality types of professional music educators and music therapists with comparisons to undergraduate majors|journal=Journal of Music Therapy|date=Spring 2011|volume=48|issue=1|pages=55–73|pmid=21866713|doi=10.1093/jmt/48.1.55}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Differences can probably be attributed to teaching being a profession more dependent on extraversion.

==== Agreeableness ====

Agreeable individuals preferred upbeat and conventional music.&lt;ref name="Langmeyer rudan tarnai" /&gt;  Additionally, listeners with high agreeableness displayed an intense emotional response to music which they had never before listened to.&lt;ref name="Ladinig schellenberg" /&gt; Agreeableness is also a good predictor of the emotional intensity experienced from all types of music, both positive and negative.  Those scoring high in agreeableness tend to have more intense emotional reactions to all types of music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ladinig|first=Olivia|author2=Schellenberg, Glenn E. |title=Liking unfamiliar music: Effects of felt emotion and individual differences|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=May 2012|volume=6|issue=2|pages=146–154|doi=10.1037/a0024671}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Neuroticism ====

The more neurotic a person is, the less likely they are to listen to intense and rebellious music (such as alternative, rock and heavy metal); they will likely prefer upbeat and conventional music, such as country, sound tracks, and pop music.&lt;ref name="Langmeyer rudan tarnai" /&gt;  Additionally, neuroticism is positively correlated with emotional use of music.&lt;ref name="premuzic fagan furnham" /&gt;&lt;ref name="premuzic furnham freixanet muro" /&gt; Those who scored high in neuroticism were more likely to report use of music for emotional regulation and experience higher intensity of emotional affect, especially negative emotion.&lt;ref name="premuzic fagan furnham" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Premuzic Swami Furnham Maakip" /&gt;

==Individual and situational influences on musical preferences==
Situations have been shown to influence individual’s preferences for certain types of music. Participants in a study from 1996 provided information about what music they would prefer to listen to in given situations, and indicated that the situation greatly determined their musical preferences. For example, melancholic situations called for sad and moody music, while an arousal situation would call for loud, strong rhythm, invigorating music.&lt;ref name="north hargreaves 2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=North|first=Adrian|author2=Hargreaves, David |title=Situational influences on reported musical preference|journal=Psychomusicology|year=1996|volume=15|pages=30–45|doi=10.1037/h0094081}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender===

Women are more likely than men to respond to music in a more emotional way.&lt;ref name="Premuzic furnham freixanet muro"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chamorro-Premuzic|first=Tomas|authorlink=Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic|author2=Gomà-i-Freixanet, Montserrat |author3=Furnham, Adrian |author4= Muro, Anna |title=Personality, self-estimated intelligence, and uses of music: A Spanish replication and extension using structural equation modeling.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2009|volume=3|issue=3|pages=149–155|doi=10.1037/a0015342}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, females prefer popular music more than males.&lt;ref name="Rawlings ciancarelli"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rawlings|first=D.|author2=Ciancarelli, V. |title=Music Preference and the Five-Factor Model of the NEO Personality Inventory|journal=Psychology of Music|date=1 October 1997|volume=25|issue=2|pages=120–132|doi=10.1177/0305735697252003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study of personality and gender in preference for exaggerated bass in music, researchers found that males demonstrated more of a preference for bass music than females. This preference for bass music is also correlated with [[Anti-social behavior|antisocial]] and [[borderline personality disorder|borderline]] personalities.&lt;ref name="McCown Keiser Mulhearn Williamson"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCown|first=William|author2=Keiser, Ross |author3=Mulhearn, Shea |author4= Williamson, David |title=The role of personality and gender in preference for exaggerated bass in music|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|year=1997|volume=23|issue=4|pages=543–547 |doi=10.1016/s0191-8869(97)00085-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Age===

Age is a strong factor in determining music preference. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barret|first=Frederick S.|author2=Grimm, Kevin J. |author3=Robins, Richard W. |author4=Wildschut, Tim |author5=Constantine, Sedikides |author6=Janata, Petr |title=Music-evoked nostalgia: Affect, memory, and personality|journal=Emotion|date=June 2010|volume=10|issue=3|pages=390–403|doi=10.1037/a0019006|pmid=20515227}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study of adolescent preferences of music in England, researchers found that girls regarded music as a worthwhile activity more than boys, but both boys and girls agreed that it does not need to be taught in schools. There is also evidence that preferences and opinions toward music can change with age.&lt;ref name="crowther"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crowther|first=R|author2=Durkin, K |title=Sex- and age-related differences in the musical behavior, interests and attitudes towards music of 232 secondary school students|journal=Educational Studies|year=1982|volume=8|issue=2|pages=131–139|doi=10.1080/0305569820080206}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a Canadian study concerning how adolescent music preferences relate to personality, researchers found that adolescents who preferred heavy music demonstrated low self-esteem, higher levels of discomfort within the family, and tended to feel rejected by others.  Adolescents who preferred light music were preoccupied with doing the proper thing, and had difficulty balancing independence with dependence. Adolescents who had eclectic music preferences had less difficulty negotiating adolescence, and were flexible using music according to mood and particular needs at the time.&lt;ref name="schwartz fouts g"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schwartz|first=Kelly|author2=Fouts, Gregory |title=Music preferences, personality style, and developmental issues of adolescents|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|year=2003|volume=32|issue=3|pages=205–213|doi=10.1023/a:1022547520656}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season of the year===

Season of the year can also affect preferences.  After reflecting upon fall or winter seasons, participants preferred reflective and complex music, whereas after reflecting upon summer or spring, participants preferred energetic and rhythmic music. However, "pop" music seems to have a universal appeal, despite the season.&lt;ref name=Pettijohn&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pettijohn|first=Terry F.|author2=Williams, Greg M. |author3=Carter, Tiffany C. |title=Music for the Seasons: Seasonal Music Preferences in College Students|journal=Current Psychology|date=26 November 2010|volume=29|issue=4|pages=328–345|doi=10.1007/s12144-010-9092-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Familiarity===

Familiarity and complexity both have interesting effects on musical preferences.  As seen in other types of artistic media, an inverted U relationship is apparent       when relating subjective complexity on liking music excerpts. Individuals like complexity to a certain degree, then begin to dislike the music when complexity gets too high. Furthermore, there is a clear positive monotonic relationship between familiarity and liking of music.&lt;ref name="north hargreaves"&gt;{{cite journal|last=North|first=Adrian|author2=Hargreaves, David |title=Subjective complexity, familiarity, and liking for popular music|journal=Psychomusicology|year=1995|volume=14|pages=77–93|doi=10.1037/h0094090}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self views===

Music preferences can also be influenced by how the individual wants to be perceived, especially in males.&lt;ref name="premuzic fagan furnham" /&gt;  Music preferences could be used to make self-directed identity claims.  Individuals might select styles of music that reinforce their self-views. For examples, individuals with a conservative self-view preferred conventional styles of music, while individuals with an athletic self view preferred vigorous music.&lt;ref name="Rentfrow gosling 2003" /&gt;

===Mood===

Active mood is another factor that affects music preference.  Generally whether people are in a good or bad mood when they hear music affects how they feel about the type of music and also their emotional response.&lt;ref name="Vuoskoski" /&gt; On that line of thinking, aggression has been shown to improve creativity and emotional intensity derived from music.  People with aggressive disorders find music to be a powerful emotional outlet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pool|first=Jonathan|author2=Odell-Miller, Helen |title=Aggression in music therapy and its role in creativity with reference to personality disorder|journal=The Arts in Psychotherapy|year=2011|volume=38|pages=169–177|doi=10.1016/j.aip.2011.04.003|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, the value people put on music and frequency of listening affects their reactions to it.  If people listen to a certain type of music and add emotional experience to songs or a genre in general, this increases the likelihood of enjoying the music and being emotionally affected by it.&lt;ref name="Nusbaum 199–204"/&gt;  This helps explain why many people might have strong reactions to music their parents listened to frequently when they were children.

'''RT Arabic''', formerly known as '''Rusiya Al-Yaum''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: روسيا اليوم, meaning ''Russia Today''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rian.ru/society/20070504/64916151.html|title=Началось вещание телеканала "Россия сегодня" на арабском языке|work=РИА Новости|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a Russian free-to-air television news channel broadcasting in Arabic and headquartered in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]]. Rusiya Al-Yaum started broadcasting on 4 May 2007.

The channel covers a wide variety of events worldwide from the point of view of the Russian government. It also features interviews, debates and stories about cultural life in Russia and major cities.

==History==

The work at “Rusiya Al-Yaum” began in February, 2006 right after the successful start of its English counterpart “[[RT (TV network)|RT]]” in December, 2005. The test of the first Russian channel in Arabic began on May 4, 2007, and soon started broadcasting in full. At the moment people from the Middle East, North Africa and Europe have open access to the satellite signal of the channel. The potential audience of the channel is 350 million people. The channel can also be watched on the Internet all over the world. As of November 2012, it also became available on [[MyTV (Arabic)|myTV]], an [[Over-the-top content|over-the-top technology]] platform in [[North and South America]].&lt;ref name="Browse Channels"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.my-tv.us/MainMenu/Products/Channels_List|title=myTV - Page Not Found|publisher=|accessdate=6 May 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120628150431/http://my-tv.us/MainMenu/Products/Channels_List|archivedate=28 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The channel staff includes experienced Russian and Arab journalists, Russian Arabists and orientalists. Today the multinational team consists of more than 500 employees including natives of Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, Yemen, Lebanon, Mauritania, Morocco, Palestine, Syria, Sudan, Tunisia, Oman and other countries. The channel has correspondents in Lebanon, Palestine, Iraq, Egypt, Israel, Great Britain and the USA. The channel also stated in 2007 that it plans to get its own exclusive materials from Syria, Jordan and Iraq in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://russarabbc.ru/en/about/detail.php?ID=1502|title=TV Channel “Rusiya Al-Yaum” Takes Part in the Russian-Emirati Business Forum|publisher=|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editor-in-chief==

Previously, when ANO TV-Novosti announced plans to launch [[Arabic language]] channel the editor-in-chief's position was taken by [[Akram Khuzam]] ([[Al Jazeera]] Channel's former Moscow Bureau chief). But later he decided to come back to Syria and to start his new project there.
[[Margarita Simonyan]], since 2005 editor-in-chief of Russia Today TV news channel broadcasting in English, has been appointed editor-in-chief of Rusiya Al-Yaum TV channel. In her new post, Margarita Simonyan became responsible for the work of both English language Russia Today and Rusiya Al-Yaum, broadcasting in Arabic. Aidar Aganin has been appointed Deputy Editor-in-chief of Arabic Channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aib.org.uk/single-editor-in-chief-for-russia-today/|title=Single editor-in-chief for Russia Today|publisher=|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Rock &amp; Chips''''' is a [[Television in the United Kingdom|British television]] [[comedy-drama]] and [[prequel]] to the [[sitcom]] ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]''. The show is set in [[Peckham]], south-east London, during the early 1960s, focusing primarily on the lives of [[Del Boy|Del Trotter]], Freddie Robdal and Joan and Reg Trotter. [[Nicholas Lyndhurst]], who played Rodney in ''Only Fools and Horses'', plays Robdal alongside [[James Buckley (actor)|James Buckley]] (Del Boy), [[Kellie Bright]] (Joan), [[Shaun Dingwall]] (Reg) and [[Phil Daniels]] (Grandad). The Shazam Productions and [[BBC]] co-production was written by ''Only Fools and Horses'' creator [[John Sullivan (writer)|John Sullivan]], directed by Dewi Humphreys and produced by [[Gareth Gwenlan]].

The 90 minute production was conceived in 1997 and commissioned in 2003, with the premise established in the final episode of ''Only Fools and Horses'' in 2003. It was shelved and ''Only Fools and Horses'' spin-off ''[[The Green Green Grass]]'' was developed; its success led to the prequel being recommissioned in July 2009. Filming began in October in London and the production was first broadcast on [[BBC One]] and [[BBC HD]] on 24 January 2010. It was the second most watched programme of the day but gained mixed reviews from critics.

==Plot==
The story starts in February 1960, by setting up the characters. [[List of Only Fools and Horses characters#Joan Trotter|Joan Trotter]] ([[Kellie Bright]]) is in an unhappy marriage with the lazy [[List of Only Fools and Horses characters#Reg Trotter|Reg]] ([[Shaun Dingwall]]), whose father [[Grandad (Only Fools and Horses)|Ted]] ([[Phil Daniels]]) has just moved in. Her 15-year-old son [[Del Boy|Derek]], often shortened to Del Boy, ([[James Buckley (actor)|James Buckley]]) and his friends [[Boycie]], [[Trigger (Only Fools and Horses)|Trigger]], [[List of Only Fools and Horses characters#Jumbo Mills|Jumbo Mills]] and new-in-town [[Denzil (Only Fools and Horses)|Denzil]] (Stephen Lloyd, [[Lewis Osborne]], Lee Long and Ashley Gerlach) are still in school, following an increase in the [[school-leaving age]]. Joan works at the local cinema with Trigger's aunt [[List of Only Fools and Horses characters#Reenie Turpin|Reenie Turpin]] (Emma Cooke) and Raymond (Billy Seymour) for cinema manager Ernie Rayner ([[Robert Daws]]), and at the Town Hall as "a part-time filing clerk who sometimes makes the tea". Convicted thief [[List of Only Fools and Horses characters#Freddie Robdal|Freddie Robdal]] ([[Nicholas Lyndhurst]]) has just been released from [[Dartmoor (HM Prison)|Dartmoor Prison]] and returned to Peckham with explosives expert Gerald "Jelly" Kelly ([[Paul Putner]]).

At the Town Hall, Joan asks Mr Johnson ([[Colin Prockter]]) about applying for a flat in the new [[high-rise]] estate; she is told she is unlikely to get a tenancy, as preference will be given to those with young children. At the ''Nag's Head'', Freddie and Reg meet, and Reg invites him to his house to continue drinking. After meeting Joan and buying her a drink, Freddie realises that she is a Trotter, a family he has a dislike for. After they return to the Trotters' house, Freddie shows his affection for Joan.

At the cinema, Joan is promoted to part-time assistant manager and Rayner tells her that the safe sometimes contains over £2,000 at weekends. She later tells Freddie, after he goes round to her house to offer Reg some work (Reg was not at home as Freddie told him to meet him at the pub). They talk about art, and he invites her (and Reg) to his house-warming party.

In March, Joan has a [[Marilyn Monroe]] hairstyle and the safe at the cinema is broken into. Ahead of the party, Freddie gives Reg the use of his car, to return unused decorating materials to [[Guildford]] and he takes his father, Reenie and her boyfriend Clayton Cooper ([[Roger Griffiths]]) with him. They run out of petrol on the way, leaving Freddie and Joan the only ones at the party. They dance, and Freddie admits that he wanted to be alone with Joan so they could talk about art. They end the night by sleeping together.

In June, Reenie accompanies Joan to a pregnancy testing clinic, while the boys are on the Jolly Boys Outing to [[Margate]] (providing Freddie and Jelly the opportunity to burgle a jewellers). On their journey home, Reenie tells Joan about Freddie's time in prison and she realises he burgled the cinema. After Freddie tells Kelly he thinks he's in love with Joan, Reg announces her pregnancy in the pub. While Joan is completing a housing request form, Freddie goes to see her and she fails to acknowledge the baby is his.

The Trotters' housing application is successful in August, and September sees them view a flat in the new [[Walter Raleigh|Sir Walter Raleigh]] House, which they have moved into in October. In November, Joan has her baby, which she calls [[Rodney Trotter|Rodney]] (after the "handsome actor" [[Rod Taylor]], and to the surprise of everyone else). The closing scene sees Joan enter the balcony of her flat with Rodney in her arms. After telling him that Del will be very rich one day, Joan sees Freddie on a balcony in a tower opposite; she shows him Rodney and nods her head, to his delight.

Throughout, the story tells of Del's strained relationship with his father and his affection for his mother; Reg's [[affair]] with the barmaid at the Nag's Head; Del and Jumbo selling goods from the docks out of the back of a van; Del and Boycie's attempt at dating Pam and Glenda (Jodie Mooney and Katie Griffiths); Joan fending off advances from her perverted boss and provides an introduction to [[List of Only Fools and Horses characters#Roy Slater|Roy Slater]] (Calum MacNab) and [[List of Only Fools and Horses characters#Albie Littlewood|Albie Littlewood]] (Jonathan Readwin).

==Production==
Writer [[John Sullivan (writer)|John Sullivan]] had the idea for a prequel to the sitcom ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'' in 1997;&lt;ref name="Inde1299676"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/tv-radio/lovely-jubbly-del-boys-back-ndash-as-a-teenager-1299676.html |title=Lovely jubbly! Del Boy's back – as a teenager|first=Andrew|last=Johnson|work=[[The Independent]]|publisher=[[Independent News &amp; Media]]|date=11 January 2009|accessdate=23 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; its commission was announced in 2003&lt;ref name="Inde1299676" /&gt; and the premise for the series was established in the final ''Only Fools and Horses'' episode "[[Sleepless in Peckham]]" in 2003, where Rodney discovers a photograph of Freddie Robdal from 1960. His uncanny resemblance to Rodney confirmed that he, and not Reg, was Rodney's biological father. A lot of the groundwork for this had been both laid and explored in the Episode "The Frog's Legacy" the 1987 Christmas Day hour-long special. In the episode Rodney goes to ask about his father to which Albert diplomatically replies 'They're rumours Rodney. That's all. Rumours.' The proposed prequel, was to be titled ''Once Upon a Time in Peckham'', it would see young versions of Del, Boycie, Denzil and Trigger, and Sullivan said "Joanie will be a key character, and during the film will give birth to Rodney."&lt;ref name="Inde1299676" /&gt; However, the prequel was shelved, and spin-off ''[[The Green Green Grass]]'' was developed to follow secondary characters, Boycie, Marlene and their son Tyler, as they escape the London Mafia and attempt to live in the [[Shropshire]] countryside.

On 3 July 2009, the BBC announced that the prequel had been commissioned as a 90-minute comedy drama, titled ''Sex, Drugs &amp; Rock 'n' Chips'', to be co-produced by the BBC and Sullivan's production company, Shazam Productions.&lt;ref name="BBCPO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/07_july/03/chips.shtml|title=BBC One brings back the Trotters – but the year is 1960 in ''Sex, Drugs &amp; Rock 'n' Chips''|publisher=BBC Press Office|date=3 July 2009|accessdate=3 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Parker |first=Robin |url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/commissioning/trotters-to-return-in-only-fools-and-horses-prequel/5003174.article?referrer=RSS |title=Trotters to return in ''Only Fools and Horses'' prequel|publisher=Broadcastnow.co.uk |date=3 July 2009|accessdate=3 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally scheduled for August,&lt;ref name="BBCPO" /&gt; filming began in October 2009 in London,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/2670957/Inbetweeners-star-plays-Del-Boy-in-TV-prequel.html|title=''Inbetweeners'' star plays Del Boy in TV prequel|last=Robertson|first=Colin|date=7 October 2009|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|publisher=[[News International]]|accessdate=31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/10_october/05/chips.shtml |title=Shooting starts on ''Sex, Drugs &amp; Rock 'n' Chips''|publisher=BBC Press Office |date=5 October 2009|accessdate=14 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; lasting 19 days.&lt;ref name="Deacon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/michaeldeacon/100022975/yet-another-bbc-star-complains-about-budget-cuts/|title=Yet another BBC star complains about budget cuts|last=Deacon|first=Michael|date=20 January 2010|work=[[telegraph.co.uk]]|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|accessdate=31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicholas Lyndhurst]], who played Rodney in ''Only Fools and Horses'', would play villain and art connoisseur Freddie Robdal in a reprise of his role in the "Sleepless in Peckham" photograph, [[Kellie Bright]] (''[[Bad Girls (TV series)|Bad Girls]]'', ''[[The Archers]]'') would play the "glamorous" Joan Trotter, her husband Reg would be portrayed by [[Shaun Dingwall]] (''[[Soldier Soldier]]'', ''[[Doctor Who]]''), and his father by [[Phil Daniels]] (''[[Quadrophenia (film)|Quadrophenia]]'', ''[[EastEnders]]''). [[James Buckley (actor)|James Buckley]] (''[[The Inbetweeners]]''), would play the teenage Derek, Joan and Reg's son, portrayed by [[David Jason]] in ''Only Fools and Horses''. Dewi Humphreys (''[[The Green Green Grass]]'') would direct. It was announced in January 2010 that the production would be shown on 24 January on [[BBC One]] with the title ''Rock &amp; Chips''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2010/01_january/15/rock.shtml|title=''Rock &amp; Chips'': introduction|date=15 January 2010|publisher=BBC Press Office|accessdate=31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The drama was produced by [[Gareth Gwenlan]], who worked on ''Only Fools and Horses'' between 1988 and 2003. Speaking to the ''[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]'', he described it as "essentially a love story" between Joan and Freddie, and he said that Lyndhurst "told me he thinks it's the best thing he's ever done". Speaking about the casting of Lyndhurst, he said he "would make a marvellous villain, which is something people will never have seen him do on TV before".&lt;ref name="WesternMail"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/showbiz-and-lifestyle/showbiz/2010/01/23/new-york-paris-peckham-brecon-91466-25653843/|title=New York, Paris, Peckham, Brecon... ''Rock &amp; Chips''|last=Rees|first=Claire|date=23 January 2010|work=[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|accessdate=1 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking about continuing the story, Gwenlan said that the production was "run on the idea it'll be turned into a series. This one lays the groundwork and John [Sullivan] has enough for about two more series."&lt;ref name="WesternMail" /&gt;

On 13 September 2010, while promoting the third series of ''[[The Inbetweeners]]'' on [[BBC Radio 5 Live]], James Buckley confirmed that ''Rock &amp; Chips'' would return for two more specials, one for Christmas 2010, and the other for Easter 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a279052/bbc-orders-two-rock--chips-specials.html BBC orders two 'Rock &amp; Chips' specials]&lt;/ref&gt; John Sullivan died on 23 April 2011, five days before the final episode was broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13176198 |title=Comedy writer John Sullivan OBE dies |work=BBC News |date=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Locations===
The 'Nags Head' pub used in the pilot episode is a de-furbished version of the existing 'Pelton Arms' pub in Greenwich, which maintains the 'Only Fools And Horses' look, style and 'feel'.  The prefabricated [[Excalibur Estate]] in [[Catford]] was used as a location in the opening episode.

===John Sullivan's comments===
Sullivan said when the production was announced that it would "give us a bit of an insight into why Del and Rodney turned out {{sic|they}} way they did" in a period "before [[The Beatles]] and [[Mary Quant]] made London the coolest place on the planet" when "the staple diet was [[rock salmon]] and chips and the flicks offer the only hint of glamour".&lt;ref name="BBCPO" /&gt; Expanding further on the basis for the prequel, he said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;... the most important person in the flat [in ''Only Fools and Horses''] was never, ever seen; it was the spirit of Del's (and Rodney's) beloved mother Joan who had passed away 17 years before, and throughout the run of the series Del constantly referred to her and past events within the Trotter Family. ... But much of his historical information was at best contradictory, and {{sic|at worse}} outright lies. We were left with a situation where the only person who really knew what had happened was an unreliable witness, so I decided to return to those misty days of 1960 to meet all those characters we'd only ever heard about ...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/comedy/2010/01/john-sullivan-on-rock-chips.shtml|title=John Sullivan on ''Rock &amp; Chips''|last=Sullivan|first=John|date=18 January 2010|work=BBC Comedy Blog|publisher=BBC|accessdate=31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Nicholas Lyndhurst's comments===
In an interview in the press pack for the production, Lyndhurst described Freddie Robdal as "a villain – charming, but nasty", and comparing him to Rodney, said that: "They're from two entirely different suitcases as far as I'm concerned. I didn't want to bring into it anything that I'd already done with Rodney and fortunately there wasn't any opportunity to do so. They're like chalk and cheese."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2010/01_january/15/rock2.shtml|title=''Rock &amp; Chips'': Q&amp;A with Nicholas Lyndhurst|date=15 January 2010|publisher=BBC Press Office|accessdate=31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking about the 19-day filming schedule and the "not great" budget, he also told Michael Deacon of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I was very pleased it was made at all. ... There were people who said, 'I don't think we're going to do this', and we had to wait months to get the green light. We thought, 'Well, we haven't got the budget we want, we haven't got the schedule we want, so we're going to have to make it as brilliant as we can.' It was a costume drama and it needed a costume drama budget, and it didn't get that.&lt;ref name="Deacon" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

| ShortSummary =Set in 1960, Joan Trotter is in an unhappy marriage with the work-shy Reg, with whom she has a teenage son, Derek ("Del Boy"). However, the reappearance in Peckham of bank robber, "art connoisseur" and womaniser Freddie Robdal, recently released after a ten-year prison sentence, will bring about changes in Joan's life. ''Rock &amp; Chips'' centres on the relationships between the glamorous Joan Trotter, Del's useless father Reg, the safe-cracker Freddie Robdal and the young [[Del Boy]]. It also features teenage incarnations of some of the original show's regular characters, including [[Boycie]], [[Trigger (Only Fools and Horses)|Trigger]], [[Denzil Tulser|Denzil]], and Jumbo Mills. The Trotter family have not yet moved into their flat in [[Walter Raleigh]] House (later [[Nelson Mandela]] House), but there are some recognisable settings such as the mean streets of Peckham and the Nag's Head circa 1960.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inthenews.co.uk/entertainment/tv/del-boy-back-in-only-fools-and-horses-prequel-$1308917 ]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ted and Reg are still drawing the dole, and hard-working Joan is struggling to keep the family afloat by returning to her old job at the cinema, while asking her mother-in-law Violet to look after baby Rodney. A 16-year-old Del has left school and is exploring employment opportunities around the docks – including a nice line in selling 45s straight off the back of a boat from America – and Rodney's father Freddie Robdal has been temporarily detained in [[Wormwood Scrubs (HM Prison)|Wormwood Scrubs]] [[at Her Majesty's pleasure]].

It was the second most-watched programme of the day, behind the first ''Dancing on Ice'' programme of the evening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/jan/25/rock-and-chips-tv-ratings|title=TV ratings: ''Rock &amp; Chips'' serves up more than 7m|last=Brook|first=Stephen|date=25 January 2010|work=[[guardian.co.uk]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|accessdate=31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Final figures showed it was seen by 8.42&amp;nbsp;million viewers on BBC One and 279,000 on BBC HD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barb.co.uk/viewing/weekly-top-10? |title=Weekly Top 10 Programmes |publisher=[[Broadcasters' Audience Research Board|BARB]] |accessdate=14 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130113222519/http://www.barb.co.uk/viewing/weekly-top-10 |archivedate=13 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sam Wollaston for ''[[The Guardian]]'' said he was missing the interplay between Rodney and Del Boy from the original, and that the only fun in the drama was "recognising the nods, working out who's who and how it all fits into place. Otherwise, it's pretty lame."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/jan/25/rock-and-chips-24|title=''Rock &amp; Chips'' and ''24''|last=Wollaston|first=Sam|date=25 January 2010|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|accessdate=31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Daily Mirror]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s [[Jim Shelley (TV critic)|Jim Shelley]] didn't find the storyline "interesting or convincing", finding Lyndhurst's performance as Freddie "laughable" and saying it was "bizarre" that the storyline "virtually abandoned its main character (the young Del Boy) and its best actor (the engaging James Buckley from The Inbetweeners) who played him".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.mirror.co.uk/shelleyvision/2010/01/trotter-spin-off-was-one-del-o.html|title=Trotter spin off was one Del of a bad idea|last=Shelley|first=Jim|authorlink=Jim Shelley (TV critic)|date=25 January 2010|work=[[Daily Mirror|Mirror.co.uk]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Independent]]'', [[Tom Sutcliffe (broadcaster)|Tom Sutcliffe]] said that "the narrative's focus was blurred and the pacing weirdly off – quite a lot of the time you were well ahead of the drama and hanging around for it to catch up with you".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/the-weekends-television-the-bible-a-history-sun-channel-4brrock--chips-sun-bbc1br24-sun-sky-1-1877684.html|title=The Weekend's Television: ''The Bible: A History'', Sun, Channel 4; ''Rock &amp; Chips'', Sun, BBC1; ''24'', Sun, Sky 1|last=Sutcliffe|first=Tom|date=25 January 2010|work=[[The Independent]]|publisher=[[Independent News &amp; Media]]|accessdate=31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benji Wilson from ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' also wasn't impressed saying the viewer would have been disappointed if they "tuned in wanting to be entertained, enthused, or anything in between", and that it was an "ocean-going stinker".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/7055424/Rock-and-Chips-BBC-One-review.html|title=''Rock &amp; Chips'', BBC One, review|last=Wilson|first=Benji|date=22 January 2010|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|accessdate=31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, ''[[The Scotsman]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Paul Whitelaw said that, despite a "disjointed" plot and it being "overstretched at 90 minutes": "It was actually pretty good. Not great, not perfect, but a watchable production from which everyone emerged with their dignity intact." He said that Buckley "delivered a charming performance in what was effectively a supporting role. Wisely choosing to suggest Del's familiar mannerisms without opting for outright impersonation, he carried off a difficult task with modest [[wikt:élan|élan]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/features/TV-review-Rock-and-Chips.6009537.jp|title=TV review: ''Rock and Chips'' &amp;#124; ''The Bible: A History''|last=Whitelaw|first=Paul|date=25 January 2010 |work=[[The Scotsman]]|publisher=[[Johnston Press]]|accessdate=31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[The Stage]]'', Harry Venning found the performances "top notch" and praised the script as "first class", saying "the comic moments were of the highest quality and beautifully crafted into the narrative".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/feature.php/27090/tv-review|title=TV review|last=Venning|first=Harry|date=1 February 2010|work=[[The Stage]]|accessdate=10 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Billen from ''[[The Times]]'' described Bright's portrayal of Joan as "winsome", said Lyndhurst "produced a detailed performance" and that "''Rock &amp; Chips'' was better than the sequel that preceded it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article6998800.ece|title=''Rock &amp; Chips''; ''24''; ''The Bible: A History''|last=Billen|first=Andrew|date=25 January 2010|work=[[Times Online]]|publisher=[[News International]]|accessdate=31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keith Watson in the ''[[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]]'' also praised the performances of Buckley and Bright, saying "They deserved a show all to themselves." Although he found the period detail "squeaky clean" and "unconvincing", he closed his review by saying: "Somehow it made me care about the Trotters in a way decades of ''Only Fools and Horses'' never came close to."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/metrolife/810247-rock-chips-is-a-worthy-prequel-to-only-fools-and-horses|title=''Rock &amp; Chips'' is a worthy prequel to ''Only Fools and Horses''|last=Watson|first=Keith|date=25 January 2010|work=[[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]]|publisher=[[Associated Newspapers]]|accessdate=1 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Rogers v. Grimaldi''''', 875 F.2d 994 (2d Cir. 1989)&lt;ref name="Rogers2d"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Rogers v. Grimaldi |vol=875 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=994 |pinpoint= |court=2d Cir. |date=1989 |url=https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/524053/ginger-rogers-v-alberto-grimaldi-mgmua-entertainment-co-and-pea/ |accessdate=2017-10-20 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a trademark and intellectual freedom case, known for establishing the "''Rogers'' test" for protecting uses of trademarks that implicate intellectual freedom issues.

Noted artist [[Ginger Rogers]] sued [[Alberto Grimaldi]] and MGM for production and distribution of the 1986 [[Federico Fellini]] film ''[[Ginger and Fred]]'', a film about Pippo and Amelia, two Italian cabaret performers whose routine emulated the more famous pairing of [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Ginger Rogers]].  Rogers claimed that the film violated her [[Lanham Act]] trademark rights, right of publicity, and was a "[[false light]]" defamation.&lt;ref name="Rogers2d"/&gt;

The Second Circuit, on appeal, noted that, "This appeal presents a conflict between Rogers' right to protect her celebrated name and the right of others to express themselves freely in their own artistic work. Specifically, we must decide whether Rogers can prevent the use of the title ''Ginger and Fred'' for a fictional movie that only obliquely relates to Rogers and Astaire."&lt;ref name="Rogers2d"/&gt;

The lower court found Grimaldi not liable.&lt;ref name="RogersSDNY&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Rogers v. Grimaldi |vol=695 |reporter=F.Supp. |opinion=112 |pinpoint= |court=S.D.N.Y. |date=1988 |url=https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2345732/rogers-v-grimaldi/ |accessdate=2017-10-20 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Second Circuit affirmed, with Judge [[Jon O. Newman]] writing for the panel that "suppressing an artistically relevant though ambiguous[ly] title[d] film" on trademark grounds would "unduly restrict expression."&lt;ref&gt;''Rogers'', 875 F.2d at 1001.&lt;/ref&gt;  The court held that "In sum, we hold that section 43(a) of the Lanham Act does not bar a minimally relevant use of a celebrity's name in the title of an artistic work where the title does not explicitly denote authorship, sponsorship, or endorsement by the celebrity or explicitly mislead as to content."&lt;ref&gt;''Rogers'', 875 F.2d at 1005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge [[Thomas Griesa]] concurred in the judgment, but wrote separately to argue that the Second Circuit had not needed to establish a general rule.

The "Rogers test", so-called, has since been cited by numerous courts, adopting its reasoning to protect the use of trademarks in works of creative expression.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''[[E.S.S. Entertainment 2000, Inc. v. Rock Star Videos, Inc.]]'', [https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1226414/ess-entertainment-2000-v-rock-star-videos/ 547 F.3d 1095] (9th Cir. 2008) (depicting plaintiff's logo in a video game featuring real locations did not infringe the plaintiff's trademark rights); ''[[University of Alabama Board of Trustees v. New Life Art., Inc.]]'', 683 F.3d 1266 (11th Cir. 2012) (depicting University and athletic trademark logos in documentary-style paintings of famous plays did not infringe the University's trademarks).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Romeo &amp; Julia''''' is the official [[soundtrack]] for [[Terminaator]]'s [[Musical theatre|musical]] "Romeo &amp; Julia" ([[Romeo and Juliet]]), made for Eesti Nuku- ja Noorsooteater (Estonian Puppet and Youth Theatre). Unlike the soundtrack for "[[Risk (Terminaator album)|Risk]]", this one wasn't released under the name of Terminaator.

Later, a new song was written for [[Hele Kõrve|Hele Kõre]] and [[Kristjan Kasearu]], titled "Romeo ja Julia". It was written for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2007]] and was also added in the play and released as a single, but it's absent from the earlier released soundtrack.

'''''Rudé právo''''' ([[Czech language|Czech]] for '''''Red Justice''''' or '''''The Red Truth''''') was the official [[newspaper]] of the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Milan Smid|title=Czech Republic|url=http://www2.mirovni-institut.si/media_ownership/pdf/czech%20republic.pdf|publisher=Mirovni Institut|accessdate=18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and profile==
''Rudé právo'' was founded in 1920 when the party was splitting from the [[social democrat]]s and their older daily ''Právo lidu'' (''People's Right''). During the 1920s and 1930s it was often [[censorship|censor]]ed and even temporarily stopped. In autumn 1938 the party was abolished and during the German occupation and [[World War II]] that came soon afterwards the newspaper became an underground mimeographed pamphlet. After the communist take-over in 1948 it became the leading newspaper in the country, the Czechoslovak equivalent of the [[Soviet Union]]'s ''[[Pravda]]'', highly [[propaganda|propagandistic]] and sometimes obedient to the government. Its [[Slovak language|Slovak]] equivalent in [[Slovakia]] was ''[[Pravda (Slovakia)|Pravda]]''.

''Rudé právo'' had a [[Newspaper circulation|circulation]] of over one million daily, making it the most widely distributed newspaper in Czechoslovakia. The communist government promoted its sales, for example, by sometimes forbidding other newspapers to be sold before 10am, or [[kiosk]] owners might be paid to not sell other papers at all, or the presses that printed rival newspapers could just be ordered not to print them.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} 

Following the [[Velvet Revolution]], ''Rudé právo'' was privatised in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Daniela Gawrecká|title=Who Watches the Watchmen?|url=http://www.soc.cas.cz/sites/default/files/soubory/who_watches_the_watchmen.pdf|publisher=Institute of Sociology|accessdate=17 February 2015|location=Prague|format=Discussion Paper|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, some editors founded a new daily, ''[[Právo]]'', unaffiliated with the party but taking advantage of the existing reader base.

==In popular culture==
* In the book ''Life is Elsewhere'' by Milan Kundera, Jaromil, the protagonist, makes a reference to reading ''Rudé právo''.
* In the 2006 movie ''[[Bobby (2006 film)|Bobby]]'', [[Svetlana Metkina]] plays a Czechoslovak reporter for ''Rudé právo'' who is granted an interview with [[Robert F. Kennedy]].

The {{nihongo|'''Sapporo Television Broadcasting, Co., Ltd.'''|札幌テレビ放送株式会社|Sapporo Terebi Hōsō Kabushiki Gaisha}} is a [[TV station]] of [[Nippon News Network|Nippon News Network (NNN)]] and Nippon Television Network System (NNS) in [[Hokkaidō]], [[Japan]].

'''''Shababnews''''' '''("Youth News")''' is a [[television]] programme in [[Jordan]].

The first TV News Programme for young people in [[Arabic]] was launched on [[JRTV|Jordan Television]] on April 5, 2007.  ''Shababnews'' runs for half an hour every week on Thursdays at 5pm and is targeted at teenagers up to 15 years old.  In a region where news is often an official 'product', it is an interesting development, following over two dozen similar programmes in Europe, some of which have been on air for over thirty years.

The ''Shababnews'' programmes are available to Arabic speakers all over the world, via the web-site.

The first edition of ''Shababnews'' included a report on one of the biggest local health problems confronting young people -- [[diabetes]].  A [[cartoon]] analysis of the causes of the illness was inter-cut with material from Jordan, including an interview with a young person with diabetes.  The programme also reported on two 15-year-old local entrepreneurs and students from [[The Music and Ballet School of Baghdad]] reflecting on the war and violence in [[Iraq]].  Later programmes have had reports on child labour and plastic bags.

''Shababnews'' states that it aims to highlight the issues that concern young people and give space for their voices, calling for changes and improvements.  It was established with funding from the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] government and technical assistance from [[Jemstone Media]], a [[NGO]] active in the region for more than 12 years.

The programme has been accepted as an associate member of the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU) network of youth news TV programmes, which means that Jordan can be a window on the Arab world for young people in Europe.

The ''Shababnews'' presenters are:  Mohamed al Rimawi and Malak al Khouri.  The rest of the team includes: Reema Awadalah, Lana Afanah, Nahed Katatba, Alia Hattouk and Rand Jammal.  The studio director is Majed abu Rabieh.

In [[popular music]], a '''side project''' is a project undertaken by one or more people already known for their involvement in another band. It can also be an artist or a band temporarily switching to a different style.&lt;!--EXAMPLES: artist Devin Townsend doing Ocean Machine side project, bands Coil or King Crimson doing some side projects with full crew.--&gt;

Usually these projects emphasize a different aspect of that person's or that band's musical interests that they feel they cannot explore within the boundaries established by their main project. Side projects can later become full-time endeavours, but should not be confused with quitting a band for a solo career or another band. Peter Hartlaub of ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' called the solo side project "the biggest longshot bet in mainstream music".&lt;ref name="SFC 2010-04-06"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hartlaub|first=Peter|date=6 April 2010|title=When band guys go solo on side, it rarely works|url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/When-band-guys-go-solo-on-side-it-rarely-works-3268107.php|newspaper=''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''|access-date=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]'' described the side project as "a break from the other band members, a chance to toy with different genres and recording methods, a fling with no long-term commitment".&lt;ref name="NYT 2013-02-22"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pareles|first=Jon|author-link=Jon Pareles|date=22 February 2013|title=Postal Service and Breeders on Spring Tours|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/24/arts/music/postal-service-and-breeders-on-spring-tours.html|newspaper=''[[The New York Times]]''|access-date=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There can be [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] reasons to pursue side projects,&lt;ref name="Philly.com 1996-01-21"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.philly.com/1996-01-21/entertainment/25651816_1_weezer-matt-sharp-rentals|title=Rockers' Menu: A Main Band, With A Project On The Side|last=Moon|first=Tom|date=21 January 1996|website=Philly.com|publisher=[[Philadelphia Media Network]]|accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and side projects can have the benefit of protecting [[Independent music|indie]] credibility.&lt;ref name="Philly.com 1996-01-21"/&gt;

==Overview==
One example of [[music]]al side projects is [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]'s decision in 1978 to have each member of the band, [[Gene Simmons]], [[Paul Stanley]], [[Ace Frehley]] and [[Peter Criss]], simultaneously release solo albums. In 1992, [[The Melvins]] released solo [[Extended play|EP]]s in a similar fashion.

"Side project" may also refer to pursuits of famous individuals outside of their primary fields. For instance, [[Wicked Wisdom]] is a "side project" of actress [[Jada Pinkett Smith]]. Side projects often occur at a crossroads of a celebrity's career.

A side project can also be a band that takes on an "[[alter ego]]", usually in order to play a different style of music that their fans are not used to. An  example of this type of side project would be the band [[Weezer]], who is also the [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] cover band Goat Punishment.

Another example of a side project is when in 1990, [[Jesper Strömblad]] of [[Ceremonial Oath]] decided to start a side project known as [[In Flames]] because he wanted to start a new project that combined [[Iron Maiden]] and [[death metal]] all together which he said he had never heard of before, the side project then grew into a band in 1995 and is now one of the most influential Metal bands of all time, and still together without Jesper.

A '''stereographer''' is a professional in the field of [[stereoscopy]] and [[visual effects]] using the art and techniques of stereo photography, 3D photography, or stereoscopic 3D film to create a visual perception of a 3-dimensional image from a flat surface. 

==Responsibilities==
The role of a stereographer in modern 3D movies can be summarized as:
* Being part of the film (movie) crew, ideally at the script and screen play revision phase for the best 3D experience. If not possible, then at the very least at the Camera and Scene blocking stage
* Creating a depth script for "3D mood" treatment of the movie. This is a creative process with the [[film director|director]], the technical conclusions of which are shared with the [[director of photography]] for final recommendations.
* For modern digital movie projection, also coordinating to a certain extent with [[set designer|set]] and [[costume designer]]s to creatively suggest minimizing of high contrast colors that may cause stereo crosstalk
* On-location co-ordination with the director of photography to assist in stereo framing and implementation of the depth script. A good stereographer knows how to augment but not restrict the cinematographer.
* Suggest [[Cutaway (filmmaking)|cutaway]]s, cat-in-the-window shots and other time permitting takes to assist the editor with options (footage) to maintain proper depth cuts, during [[post-production]].
* Being present at all post-production sessions to recommend tricks of the trade for unavoidable errors that need to be corrected, and final tweaking of stereo for comfortable viewing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="898">'''Strolling players''' were  travelling theatre groups in [[Tudor period]] in [[England]], who toured the country delivering theatrical performances. They performed in "Inn Courtyards", which were houses of noble men. One of the most popular plays performed by these strolling players was [[Robin Hood]].&lt;ref name="elizabethian theatre"&gt;http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/TUDtheatre.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The English government of the period was concerned that plays such as Robin Hood would promote rebellious acts. The emergence of the [[Black death]] also increased fear that the strolling players would be responsible for spreading disease. The strolling players were subsequently banned in 1572. The only actors allowed to perform around the country were those who were employed by noblemen.&lt;ref name="elizabethian theatre"/&gt;

'''''The Dinner''''' (Dutch: '''''Het diner''''') is a novel by the Dutch author [[Herman Koch]]. The book was first published by [[Ambo Anthos]] in 2009. It was translated into English by [[Sam Garrett (translator)|Sam Garrett]], published in Great Britain in 2012, and the United States in 2013. The book became an international [[bestseller]] with many translations and has been adapted into three films.

==Plot==
The story is narrated by Paul Lohman, a former history teacher. He and his wife Claire meet at a fancy restaurant in [[Amsterdam]] with his elder brother Serge, a prominent politician and contender for the position of Dutch prime minister, and his wife Babette. The plan is to discuss over dinner how to handle a crime committed by their teenage sons, Michel and Rick, respectively. The violent act of the two boys had been filmed by a security camera and shown on TV, but, so far, they have not been identified. The parents have to decide on what to do. They debate over dinner causing tension throughout the evening.

== Composition ==
The book belongs to the genre of stories told by an [[unreliable narrator]].&lt;ref name=preston/&gt; The story is organized in sections that are headed by the sequential courses of the dinner, from aperitif to digestif,&lt;ref name=maslin/&gt; and frequently interrupted by some form of disruption during the meal as well as [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s. The novel starts with what appears to be a skeptical "attitude towards the fashionable, the fancy and the fussy" that may appeal to the reader only to turn—"slowly and fiendishly"—to make the reader think about the nature of their own indignations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.salon.com/2013/02/18/the_dinner_the_dutch_answer_to_gone_girl_maybe_not_but_no_less_thrilling/ |author=Laura Miller| title='The Dinner': The Dutch answer to 'Gone Girl'? Maybe not, but no less thrilling |work=Salon |date=February 17, 2013| accessdate=April 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
By 2012 the book had already sold a million copies in Europe.&lt;ref name=akbar&gt;{{cite web|  url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-dinner-by-herman-koch-trans-sam-garrett-7979304.html | author=Arifa Akbar | title=The Dinner, By Herman Koch, trans. Sam Garrett | publisher=[[The Independent]] | date=July 28, 2012|  accessdate=April 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arifa Akbar (''[[The Independent]]'') noted that the "sly" and "riveting" novel seems to head in one direction, then "is galloping down another, unexpected path" and finds that it "may thrill, chill or cheat", whereby its "spectacular style triumphs over substance".&lt;ref name=akbar/&gt; The book was twice reviewed by ''[[The New York Times]]''. [[Janet Maslin]]  found the morality of the story "really sickening", none of the four characters at the dinner is "really sane" and compared it negatively to [[Gillian Flynn]]’s ''[[Gone Girl (novel)|Gone Girl]]'' where the characters are vicious but also sympathetic.&lt;ref name=maslin&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/books/the-dinner-by-herman-koch.html?smid=tw-share&amp;_r=1&amp; | author=[[Janet Maslin]]|  title=Now Serving Spite and Dutch Malaise|  publisher=[[The New York Times]] | date=February 6, 2013|  accessdate=April 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Claire Messud]] noted a "bracing nastiness" in the book as more and more secrets are disclosed.&lt;ref name=messud&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/10/books/review/the-dinner-by-herman-koch.html | author=Claire Messud | title=Nasty Bits | publisher=[[The New York Times]] | date=March 8, 2013 | accessdate=April 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She opines that "The Dinner" is, to some extent, "attuned to a distinctly European society, one simultaneously more ostentatious in its apparent "civilization" and more ashamed of its underlying savagery".&lt;ref name=messud/&gt; [[Alex Preston]] (''[[The Guardian]]'') indicated that the book is about the nature of evil and found it to be a well-paced and entertaining novel that shows "brutal violent creatures" under "the thin facades of decency and manners."&lt;ref name=preston&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jul/29/the-dinner-herman-koch-review|  author=[[Alex Preston]] | title= The Dinner by Herman Koch – review|  publisher=[[The Guardian]]|  date=July 28, 2012|  accessdate=April 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lisa Zeidner (''[[The Washington Post]]'') recognized [[black humor]] in the novel as in the unlikely choice of a public restaurant for the delicate discussion. She opined that Koch illustrates the absurdities of our privileged daily lives and pokes fun at "Dutch mediocrity".

[[File:Benjamin Franklin 1759.jpg|thumb|220px|Portrait of [[Benjamin Franklin]], author of "The Speech of Polly Baker".]]
'''"The Speech of Polly Baker"''' (1747) is the fictional story of a woman put on [[trial (law)|trial]] in 1747 for having an [[illegitimate child]].  She had been convicted four times in the past for this same crime.  Each time, she said, the full blame was placed on her shoulders but not the father's.  In later versions, the story ends as she is set free and marries one of the [[magistrate]]s in charge of her trial.

This story was actually written by [[Benjamin Franklin]] as a protest to the unfairness of the early [[judicial system]] charging women for having illegitimate children while not charging the fathers, although he did not disclose this until decades later; therefore Polly Baker is one of Franklin's many [[Pseudonym|aliases]]. Franklin himself had an illegitimate son named [[William Franklin]]. See [[Illegitimacy in fiction]].

==The Speech of Polly Baker==

===Preface===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The speech of Polly Baker, before a Court of Judicature, at [[Connecticut]] near [[Boston]] in New England; where she was prosecuted the Fifth Time, for having a [[Legitimacy (family law)|Bastard]] Child: Which influenced the Court to dispense with her Punishment, and induced one of her Judges to marry her the next day.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Polly Baker's speech===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
May it please the Honourable Bench to indulge me a few Words: I am a poor unhappy Woman; who have no Money to Fee Lawyers to plead for me, being hard put to it to get a tolerable Living. I shall not trouble your Honours with long Speeches; for I have not the presumption to expect, that you may, by any Means, be prevailed on to deviate in your Sentence from the Law, in my Favour. All I humbly hope is, that your Honours would charitably move the Governor’s Goodness on my Behalf, that my Fine may be remitted. This is the Fifth Time, Gentlemen, that I have been dragg’d before your Courts on the same Account; twice I have paid heavy Fines, and twice have been brought to public Punishment, for want of Money to pay those Fines. This may have been agreeable to the Laws; I do not dispute it: But since Laws are sometimes unreasonable in themselves, and therefore repealed; and others bear too hard on the Subject in particular Circumstances; and therefore there is left a Power somewhere to dispense with the Execution of them; I take the Liberty to say, that I think this Law, by which I am punished, is both unreasonable in itself, and particularly severe with regard to me, who have always lived an inoffensive Life in the Neighbourhood where I was born, and defy my Enemies (if I have any) to say I ever wrong’d Man, Woman, or Child. Abstracted from the Law, I cannot conceive (may it please your Honours) what the Nature of my Offence is. I have brought Five fine Children into the World, at the Risque of my Life: I have maintained them well by my own Industry, without burthening the Township, and could have done it better, if it had not been for the heavy Charges and Fines I have paid. Can it be a Crime (in the Nature of Things I mean) to add to the Number of the King’s Subjects, in a new Country that really wants People? I own I should think it rather a Praise worthy, than a Punishable Action. I have debauch’d no other Woman’s Husband, nor inticed any innocent Youth: These Things I never was charged with; nor has any one the least cause of Complaint against me, unless, perhaps the Minister, or the Justice, because I have had Children without being Married, by which they have miss’d a Wedding Fee. But, can even this be a Fault of mine? I appeal to your Honours. You are pleased to allow I don’t want Sense; but I must be stupid to the last Degree, not to prefer the honourable State of Wedlock, to the Condition I have lived in. I always was, and still am, willing to enter into it; I doubt not my Behaving well in it, having all the Industry, Frugality, Fertility, and Skill in Oeconomy, appertaining to a good Wife’s Character. I defy any Person to say I ever Refused an Offer of that Sort: On the contrary, I readily Consented to the only Proposal of Marriage that ever was made me, which was when I was a Virgin; but too easily confiding in the Person’s Sincerity that made it, I unhappily lost my own Honour, by trusting to his; for he got me with Child, and then forsook me: That very Person you all know; he is now become a Magistrate of this County; and I had hopes he would have appeared this Day on the Bench, and have endeavoured to moderate the Court in my Favour; then I should have scorn’d to have mention’d it; but I must Complain of it as unjust and unequal, that my Betrayer and Undoer, the first Cause of all my Faults and Miscarriages (if they must be deemed such) should be advanced to Honour and Power, in the same Government that punishes my Misfortunes with Stripes and Infamy. I shall be told, ’tis like, that were there no Act of Assembly in the Case, the Precepts of Religion are violated by my Transgressions. If mine, then, is a religious Offence, leave it, Gentlemen, to religious Punishments. You have already excluded me from all the Comforts of your Church Communion: Is not that sufficient? You believe I have offended Heaven, and must suffer eternal Fire: Will not that be sufficient? What need is there, then, of your additional Fines and Whippings? I own, I do not think as you do; for, if I thought, what you call a Sin, was really such, I would not presumptuously commit it. But how can it be believed, that Heaven is angry at my having Children, when, to the little done by me towards it, God has been pleased to add his divine Skill and admirable Workmanship in the Formation of their Bodies, and crown’d it by furnishing them with rational and immortal Souls? Forgive me Gentlemen, if I talk a little extravagantly on these Matters; I am no Divine: But if you, great Men, (*) must be making Laws, do not turn natural and useful Actions into Crimes, by your Prohibitions. Reflect a little on the horrid Consequences of this Law in particular: What Numbers of procur’d Abortions! and how many distress’d Mothers have been driven, by the Terror of Punishment and public Shame, to imbrue, contrary to Nature, their own trembling Hands in the Blood of their helpless Offspring! Nature would have induc’d them to nurse it up with a Parent’s Fondness. ’Tis the Law therefore, ’tis the Law itself that is guilty of all these Barbarities and Murders. Repeal it then, Gentlemen; let it be expung’d for ever from your Books: And on the other hand, take into your wise Consideration, the great and growing Number of Batchelors in the Country, many of whom, from the mean Fear of the Expence of a Family, have never sincerely and honourably Courted a Woman in their Lives; and by their Manner of Living, leave unproduced (which I think is little better than Murder) Hundreds of their Posterity to the Thousandth Generation. Is not theirs a greater Offence against the Public Good, than mine? Compel them then, by a Law, either to Marry, or pay double the Fine of Fornication every Year. What must poor young Women do, whom Custom has forbid to sollicit the Men, and who cannot force themselves upon Husbands, when the Laws take no Care to provide them any, and yet severely punish if they do their Duty without them? Yes, Gentlemen, I venture to call it a Duty; ’tis the Duty of the first and great Command of Nature, and of Nature’s God, Increase and multiply: A Duty, from the steady Performance of which nothing has ever been able to deter me; but for its Sake, I have hazarded the Loss of the public Esteem, and frequently incurr’d public Disgrace and Punishment; and therefore ought, in my humble Opinion, instead of a Whipping, to have a Statue erected to my Memory.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Themes and genre ==
On the surface "The Speech of Polly Baker" appears to be a light-hearted and "amusing story". However, Franklin presents a protest against legislation that punished women for out-of-wedlock sexual relations by imposing fines and whippings while the father of the child went without punishment. Through her use of rhetorical questions to the magistrates, Franklin shows the inequity of the prevailing justice system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Maestro, Marcello |year=1975 |title=Benjamin Franklin and the Penal Laws |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |volume= 36|issue=3 |pages=551–562 |jstor=2708664 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin creates a sympathetic fictional character in Polly Baker. According to [[literary critic]] Etta Madden, Baker's assertion that she's worthy of a statue in the [[town square]] reflects and mocks "[[Cotton Mather|Mather]]'s memorializing of saints in his ''[[Magnalia Christi Americana]]''" as well as the execution sermons [[Puritans]] espoused to make "lessons of wayward females." Furthermore, Madden explains that Baker's rational speech shows echoes of [[Anne Hutchinson]], although some might not find her speech rational at all. Therefore, Madden argues, the piece shows more complexity that is initially apparent.&lt;ref&gt;''The Heath Anthology of American Literature''. Paul Leiter, ed. Houghton Mifflin. New York. 2006. p. 807&lt;/ref&gt; Another critic (Aldridge) argues that if taken out of the context of American literature, "The Speech of Polly Baker" can be considered as a "universal myth along the lines of Don Juan and Faust."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Levine, Robert S.  |year=1985 |title=Early American Literature: A Comparatist Approach by A. Owen Aldridge |journal=Modern Philology |volume=82 |issue=4 |pages=429–431 |jstor= 437038 |doi= 10.1086/391415|pmid= |pmc= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publication history ==
"The Speech of Polly Baker" was first published in April&lt;ref&gt;''The Heath Anthology of American Literature''. Paul Leiter, ed. Houghton Mifflin. New York. 2006. p. 815&lt;/ref&gt; or May 1747&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/ilej/image1.pl?item=page&amp;seq=1&amp;size=1&amp;id=gm.1747.5.x.17.x.x.u29 Bodleian Library archive of ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'']&lt;/ref&gt; in ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]''. Initially the piece was published anonymously, but in 1905 it was included in ''The Writings of Benjamin Franklin'', although the editor had yet to prove Franklin's authorship. Max Hall, in ''Benjamin Franklin and Polly Baker: The History of a Literary Deception'' (1960) proved conclusively that Franklin wrote the piece, a conclusion accepted by scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Maestro, Marcello |year=1975 |title=Benjamin Franklin and the Penal Laws |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |volume= 36|issue=3 |pages=551–562 |jstor=2708664 |doi= |pmid= |pmc= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Theme Park Studio''''' is an amusement park simulator game being developed by Pantera Entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url        =http://funding.themeparkstudio.com/projects/theme-park-studio-3/| title =Theme Park Studio| date =15 May 2014| website =Theme Park Studio| accessdate =20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project began seeking funding on Kickstarter in 2013 and has been released in phases since February 2014.&lt;ref name=kickstarter&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1011099242/theme-park-studio-create-the-ultimate-theme-park/posts|title=Theme Park Studio - Kickstarter Update #17|publisher=Kickstarter|accessdate=24 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It allows users to design and build their own theme parks featuring [[roller coaster]]s and flat rides; similar to ''[[RollerCoaster Tycoon 3]]''. The game utilizes [[Oculus Rift]], [[HTC Vive]], and [[OSVR]] to allow users to experience roller coasters in a virtual reality format.&lt;ref name="Worth"&gt;{{cite news|last1=WP|first1=Rainier|title='Theme Park Studio' Gets Release Date - Trailer|url=http://worthplaying.com/article/2016/10/25/news/101017/|accessdate=2 December 2016|work=WorthPlaying|date=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
''Theme Park Studio'' will allow users to design and build their own custom theme parks with the use of an extensive toolset. Users will be able to place pathways, scenery, foliage and a combination of flat rides and roller coasters to produce a virtual theme park of their imagination.

The game also features other modules such as terrain editing and the ability to easily manipulate the environment through weather and lighting. Users will have the ability to script their own mini games and work with a wide variety of particle effects.

==Development==
''Theme Park Studio'' was announced on 20 November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themeparkreview.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=64403 |title=Announcing "Theme Park Studio" - A new simulation game! |publisher=Pantera Entertainment |date=9 December 2013 |accessdate= 25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2013, Pantera began a [[Kickstarter]] campaign that successfully raised 101,433 US dollars by its end date in May.&lt;ref name=Kickstarter&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1011099242/theme-park-studio-create-the-ultimate-theme-park |title=Theme Park Studio (Kickstarter) |publisher=Kickstarter|accessdate=8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 February 2014, Pantera released Phase 1 of the Early Access campaign on Steam&lt;ref name=Steam&gt;{{cite web|url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/254590 |title=Theme Park Studio (Steam Early Access) |publisher=Steam|accessdate=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the game has gradually been rolled out in further stages including the ability to design and animate flat rides, as well as being able to design and test roller coasters.

The game is being released in phases via [[Steam (software)|Steam]]. The first three phases released include access to building paths, foliage, structures, flat rides, and a present library of roller coasters.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} 

On 25 November 2016, the game was released via retail.&lt;ref name="Worth"/&gt; Later, on 2 December 2016, the game was brought out of Steam Early Access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tagliaferri|first1=Simone|title=Il progettista di parchi giochi|url=http://multiplayer.it/recensioni/177107-theme-park-studio-il-progettista-di-parchi-giochi.html|accessdate=2 December 2016|work=Multiplayer.it|date=2 December 2016|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theorycraft is prominent in [[multiplayer video game|multiplayer games]], where players attempt to gain competitive advantage by analyzing game systems. As a result, theorycraft can lower barriers between players and game designers. Game designers must consider that players will have a comprehensive understanding of game systems; and players can influence design by exploiting game systems and discovering dominant or unintended strategies.&lt;ref name="game studies"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gamestudies.org/1102/articles/paul |title=Optimizing Play: How Theorycraft Changes Gameplay and Design |access-date=13 March 2016 |quote=The growth in the role of theorycrafting offers room to analyze how games change over time and how players can influence a game’s design by reshaping how they play..}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The way players theorycraft varies from game to game, but often games under the same genres (e.g. [[Collectible card game|collectable card games]], [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|mmorpg’s]], [[turn-based strategy]]) will have similar theorycrafting methods. Communities develop standardize ways to communicate their findings, including use of specialized tools to measure and record game data, and terminology and simulations to represent certain data. Theorycrafts proven potent usually find inclusion in [[Metagaming|the metagame]].

'''Tin Pan Alley''' is the name given to the collection of New York City [[History of music publishing|music publisher]]s and [[songwriter]]s who dominated the [[American popular music|popular music]] of the United States in the late 19th century and early 20th century. The name originally referred to a specific place: West 28th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues in the [[List of Manhattan neighborhoods#Neighborhoods between Midtown and Downtown|Flower District]]&lt;ref&gt;Dickerson, Aitlin (March 12, 2013) [https://www.npr.org/2013/03/12/170668579/bowery-boys-are-amateur-but-beloved-new-york-historians "'Bowery Boys' Are Amateur But Beloved New York Historians"] ''[[National Public Radio|NPR]]''&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Manhattan]]; a plaque (see [[#plaque|below]]) on the sidewalk on 28th Street between Broadway and Sixth commemorates it.&lt;ref&gt;Mooney Jake (October 17, 2008) [https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/17/tin-pan-alley-was-never-very-pretty/ "City Room: Tin Pan Alley, Not So Pretty"] ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Gray|Gray, Christpher]] (July 13, 2003) [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/13/realestate/streetscapes-west-28th-street-broadway-sixth-tin-pan-alley-chockablock-with-life.html "Streetscapes: West 28th Street, Broadway to Sixth; A Tin Pan Alley, Chockablock With Life, if Not Song"] ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, Luke J. (ndg) [https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-remnants-of-tin-pan-alley "The Remnants of Tin Pan Alley"] ''[[Atlas Obscura]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Tom (April 8, 2016) [http://daytoninmanhattan.blogspot.com/2016/04/a-tin-pan-alley-survivor-no-38-west.html "A Tin Pan Alley Survivor -- No. 38 West 28th Street "] ''Daytonian in Manhattan''&lt;/ref&gt;

The start of Tin Pan Alley is usually dated to about 1885, when a number of music publishers set up shop in the same district of [[Manhattan]]. The end of Tin Pan Alley is less clear cut. Some date it to the start of the [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s when the [[phonograph]], radio, and motion pictures supplanted [[sheet music]] as the driving force of American popular music, while others consider Tin Pan Alley to have continued into the 1950s when earlier styles of [[American popular music]] were upstaged by the rise of [[rock &amp; roll]], which was centered on the [[Brill Building]].

The origins of the name "Tin Pan Alley" are unclear. One account claims that it was a derogatory reference to the sound of many pianos (comparing them to the banging of tin pans). Others claim it arose from songwriters modifying their pianos to produce a more [[percussive]] sound. After many years, the term came to refer to the U.S. [[music industry]] in general.

==Origin of the name==
Various explanations have been advanced to account for the origins of the term "Tin Pan Alley". The most popular account holds that it was originally a derogatory reference by [[Monroe H. Rosenfeld]] in the ''[[New York Herald]]'' to the collective sound made by many "cheap upright pianos" all playing different tunes being reminiscent of the banging of tin pans in an alleyway.&lt;ref&gt;Charlton (2011), p.3 Quote: the "term Tin Pan Alley referred to the thin, tinny tone quality of cheap upright pianos used in music publisher's offices."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hamm341&gt;Hamm (1983), p.341&lt;/ref&gt; This article has not been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Pop, Rock, and Soul Reader: Histories and Debates|last=Brackett|first=David|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=0195125711|location=Irvington, New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Simon Napier-Bell]] quotes an account of the origin of the name which was published in a 1930 book about the music business. In this version, popular songwriter [[Harry von Tilzer]] was being interviewed about the area around 28th Street and Fifth Avenue, where many music publishers had their offices. Von Tilzer had modified his expensive Kindler &amp; Collins piano by placing strips of paper down the strings to give the instrument a more percussive sound. The journalist told von Tilzer, "Your Kindler &amp; Collins sounds exactly like a tin can. I'll call the article 'Tin Pan Alley'."&lt;ref&gt;Naper-Bell, Simon, ''Ta-ra-ra-Boom-de-ay: The Beginning of the Music Business'', (2014), p.7: quoted from Goldberg, Isaac and George Gershwin, ''Tin Pan Alley: A Chronicle of the American Popular Music Racket'', (1930)&lt;/ref&gt;

With time, this nickname was popularly embraced and came to describe the American music publishing industry in general.&lt;ref name=hamm341 /&gt;  The term then spread to the United Kingdom, where "Tin Pan Alley" is also used to describe [[Denmark Street]] in London's [[West End of London|West End]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Daley|first=Dan|title=Pop's street of dreams|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/3609741/Pops-street-of-dreams.html|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=February 23, 2011|date=January 8, 2004|quote="We used to think of Tin Pan Alley, which is what they called Denmark Street years ago when all the music publishers were there, as rather old-fashioned," recalls Peter Asher}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1920s the street became known as "Britain's Tin Pan Alley" because of its large number of music shops.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicpilgrimages.com/interest/index.php?alias=tin_pan_alley.html "Tin Pan Alley (London)"], ''musicpilgrimages.com'', 2009-11-07&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of song publishing in New York City==
In the mid-19th century, [[copyright]] control of melodies was not as strict, and publishers would often print their own versions of the songs popular at the time. With stronger copyright protection laws late in the century, songwriters, composers, lyricists, and publishers started working together for their mutual financial benefit. Songwriters would literally bang on the doors of Tin Pan Alley businesses to get new material.

The commercial center of the popular music publishing industry changed during the course of the 19th century, starting in [[Boston]] and moving to [[Philadelphia]], [[Chicago]] and [[Cincinnati]] before settling in [[New York City]] under the influence of new and vigorous publishers which concentrated on vocal music. The two most enterprising New York publishers were Willis Woodard and [[T.B. Harms]], the first companies to specialize in popular songs rather than [[hymn]]s or [[classical music]].&lt;ref&gt;Hischak, Thomas S. (ndg) [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/A2257382?q=Tin+pan+alley&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=1&amp;_start=1#firsthi "Tin Pan Alley"] on Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online/Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Naturally, these firms were located in the entertainment district, which, at the time, was centered on [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]].  Witmark was the first publishing house to move to West 28th Street as the entertainment district [[Tenderloin, Manhattan|gradually shifted uptown]], and by the late 1890s most publishers had followed their lead.&lt;ref name=hamm341 /&gt;

The biggest music houses established themselves in New York City, but small local publishers &amp;ndash; often connected with commercial printers or music stores &amp;ndash; continued to flourish throughout the country, and there were important regional music publishing centers in Chicago, [[New Orleans]], [[St. Louis]], and [[Boston]]. When a tune became a significant local hit, rights to it were usually purchased from the local publisher by one of the big New York firms.

==In its prime==
{{Multiple image|direction=vertical|image1=I'm a yiddish cowboy Tough guy Levi 1908.jpg|width1=200|image2=I'm a Yiddish Cowboy - Edward Meeker (1908).ogg|width2=200|footer=''I'm a Yiddish Cowboy'' (1908)}}

The song publishers who created Tin Pan Alley frequently had backgrounds as salesmen. The background of Isadore Witmark was selling water filters. [[Leo Feist]] had sold corsets, and [[The Little Lost Child|Joe Stern and Edward B. Marks]] had sold neckties and buttons respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ian Whitcomb|Whitcomb, Ian]] (1973) ''After the Ball''. Allen Lane, p.44&lt;/ref&gt; The music houses in lower Manhattan were lively places, with a steady stream of songwriters, [[vaudeville]] and Broadway performers, musicians, and "[[song-plugger|song pluggers]]" coming and going.

Aspiring songwriters came to demonstrate tunes they hoped to sell. When tunes were purchased from unknowns with no previous hits, the name of someone with the firm was often added as co-composer (in order to keep a higher percentage of royalties within the firm), or all rights to the song were purchased outright for a flat fee (including rights to put someone else's name on the sheet music as the composer). An extraordinary number of [[Ashkenazi_Jews|Jewish East European]] immigrants became the music publishers and song writers on Tin Pan Alley &amp;ndash; the most famous being [[Irving Berlin]]. Songwriters who became established producers of successful songs were hired to be on the staff of the music houses.

"Song pluggers" were pianists and singers who represented the music publishers, making their living demonstrating songs to promote sales of sheet music. Most music stores had song pluggers on staff. Other pluggers were employed by the publishers to travel and familiarize the public with their new publications. Among the ranks of song pluggers were [[George Gershwin]], [[Harry Warren]], [[Vincent Youmans]] and [[Al Sherman]]. A more aggressive form of song plugging was known as "booming": it meant buying dozens of tickets for shows, infiltrating the audience and then singing the song to be plugged. At [[Shapiro, Bernstein &amp; Co.|Shapiro Bernstein]], Louis Bernstein recalled taking his plugging crew to cycle races at [[Madison Square Garden (1890)|Madison Square Garden]]: "They had 20,000 people there, we had a pianist and a singer with a large horn. We'd sing a song to them thirty times a night. They'd cheer and yell, and we kept pounding away at them. When people walked out, they'd be singing the song. They couldn't help it."&lt;ref&gt;Naper-Bell, Simon, ''Ta-ra-ra-Boom-de-ay: The Beginning of the Music Business'', (2014), p.6&lt;/ref&gt;

When vaudeville performers played New York City, they would often visit various Tin Pan Alley firms to find new songs for their acts. Second- and third-rate performers often paid for rights to use a new song, while famous stars were given free copies of publisher's new numbers or were paid to perform them, the publishers knowing this was valuable advertising.

Initially Tin Pan Alley specialized in melodramatic ballads and comic novelty songs, but it embraced the newly popular styles of the [[cakewalk]] and [[ragtime music]]. Later on [[jazz]] and [[blues]] were incorporated, although less completely, as Tin Pan Alley was oriented towards producing songs that amateur singers or small town bands could perform from printed music.  In the 1910s and 1920s Tin Pan Alley published pop-songs and dance numbers created in newly popular jazz and blues styles.

==Influence on law and business==
A group of Tin Pan Alley music houses formed the ''Music Publishers Association of the United States'' on June 11, 1895, and unsuccessfully lobbied the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] in favor of the [[Treloar Copyright Bill]], which would have changed the term of copyright for published music from 24 to 40 years, renewable for an additional 20 instead of 14 years. The bill would also have included music among the subject matter covered by the [[Manufacturing clause]] of the [[International Copyright Act of 1891]].

The [[American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers]] (ASCAP) was founded in 1914 to aid and protect the interests of established publishers and composers. New members were only admitted with sponsorship of existing members.

The term and established business methodologies associated with Tin Pan Alley persisted into the 1960s when innovative artists like Bob Dylan helped establish new norms.  Referring to the dominant conventions of music publishers of the early 20th century, "Tin Pan Alley is gone," Bob Dylan proclaimed in 1985, "I put an end to it. People can record their own songs now."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/10/13/497780610/bob-dylan-titan-of-american-music-wins-the-2016-nobel-prize-in-literature|title=Bob Dylan, Titan Of American Music, Wins 2016 Nobel Prize In Literature|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions to World War II==
During the [[Second World War]], Tin Pan Alley and the federal government teamed up to produce a war song that would inspire the American public to support the fight against the Axis, something they both "seemed to believe … was vital to the war effort."&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;Smith, Kathleen E. R. (2003) ''God Bless America: Tin Pan Alley Goes to War''. Lexington, Kentucky: University Press of Kentucky. pp.2–6&lt;/ref&gt; The Office of War Information was in charge of this project, and believed that Tin Pan Alley contained "a reservoir of talent and competence capable of influencing people's feelings and opinions" that it "might be capable of even greater influence during wartime than [George M. Cohan's "Over There" during World War I]."&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt; The song "Over There" can be said to be the most popular and resonant patriotic song associated with World War I.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt; Due to the large fan base of Tin Pan Alley, the government believed that this sector of the music business would be far-reaching in spreading patriotic sentiments.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;

In the United States Congress, congressmen quarrelled over a proposal to exempt musicians and other entertainers from the draft in order to remain in the country to boost morale.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt; Stateside, these artists and performers were continuously using available media to promote the war effort and to demonstrate a commitment to victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hajduk|first=John|date=Dec 2003|title=Tin Pan Alley on the March: Popular Music, World War II, and the Quest for a Great War Song|url=|journal=Popular Music and Society|volume=26|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the proposal was contested by those who strongly believed that only those who provided more substantial contributions to the war effort should benefit from any draft legislation.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;

As the war progressed, those in charge of writing the would-be national war song began to understand that the interest of the public lay elsewhere. Since the music would take up such a large amount of airtime, it was imperative that the writing be consistent with the war message that the radio was carrying throughout the nation. In her book, God Bless America: Tin Pan Alley Goes to War, Kathleen E.R. Smith writes that "escapism seemed to be a high priority for music listeners," leading "the composers of Tin Pan Alley [to struggle] to write a war song that would appeal both to civilians and the armed forces."&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt; By the end of the war, no such song had been produced that could rival hits like "Over There" from World War I.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;

Whether or not the number of songs circulated from Tin Pan Alley between 1939 and 1945 was greater than during the First World War is still debated. In his book ''The Songs That Fought the War: Popular Music and the Home Front'', [[John Bush Jones]] cites Jeffrey C. Livingstone as claiming that Tin Pan Alley released more songs during World War I than it did in World War II.&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;John Bush Jones, ''God Bless America: Tin Pan Alley Goes to War'' (Lebanon: University Press of Kentucky, 2003) 32–33&lt;/ref&gt; Jones, on the other hand, argues that "there is also strong documentary evidence that the output of American war-related songs during World War II was most probably unsurpassed in any other war."&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt;

'''UA:Pershyi''' ({{lang-uk|UA:Перший}},&lt;small&gt; [[Romanization of Ukrainian|tr.]]:&lt;/small&gt; ''UA:Pershyi'',&lt;small&gt; IPA:&lt;/small&gt; [[Help:IPA/Ukrainian|uɐ:pɛrʃɪj]]) is the national [[television channel]] in [[Ukraine]], operated by the [[National Public Broadcasting Company of Ukraine]]. It is the only Ukrainian TV channel covering over 97% of Ukraine's territory. Its programs are oriented toward all levels of Ukrainian society and national minorities. Among priority directions of the network are information, [[popular science]], culture, entertainment and sports. The channel traces its origin to the original Soviet '''UT''' (Ukrainian Television) and after [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] '''UT-1'''. In 2002 it changed its name to '''Pershyi Natsionalnyi''' (First National). Since 2015 it carries its current name.

== History ==
The first attempt at Ukrainian television broadcasting was on February 1, 1939, and lasted for 40 minutes. The second attempt was well over six years after the conclusion of [[World War II]], on November 6 and 7, 1951, in time for [[October Revolution Day]], when the Kiev studio broadcast two shows. The next attempt was conducted on May 1, 1952 when the studio broadcast a concert anchored by Novela Separionova featuring local singers. The new television studios at 26 [[Khreschatyk]] for television broadcasting opened their doors in 1953. It was the third official telecenter established in the [[Soviet Union]] after Moscow (1934) and Leningrad (1937-38). Until 1956 the studio was only presenting a couple of shows per day; from November that year regular programming started. Live broadcasting (which makes the first generation TV announcers proud today) was the only form of broadcasting up to the introduction of [[videotape]] recording in the mid-1960s.

On 20 January 1965, TV viewers in some Ukrainian [[oblast]]s (regions) could see a screen with two big capital letters "УТ" ("UT") that symbolized the beginning of the united national station for the [[Ukrainian SSR]], by now named ''Ukrainian Television''. Its time on air was over 200 hours in 1965. On 6 March 1972, UT started to go on air on two channels at a time &amp;ndash; УТ-1 (UT-1) and УТ-2 (UT-2), and adopted SECAM colour in 1976. At the end of the 1970s the building of the UT on [[Khreshchatyk]] was reconstructed and the employees got three new studios, but the question of building a new modern TV-center was raised soon. The construction of the new UT headquarters started in 1983 and was finished in 1993.  (By this point in time the former Soviet Union had dissolved and Ukraine was one of the resultant newly-independent countries.) The new center was built at 42 Melnykov Street and was officially inspected by the [[President of Ukraine]], [[Leonid Kravchuk]].

In 2002 the [[National Television Company of Ukraine]] and the [[Ukrainian Space Agency]] started to broadcast Pershyi Natsionalnyi (as First National) (UT-1) through a [[satellite]] abroad. In 2004 UT2 ended its operations and as a result [[Ukrainian Television and Radio|UTR]] started its broadcasting on UT-2's frequency. UT-1 was renamed ''First Channel''. In 2005 [[Taras Stets'kiv]] became the president of the [[National Television Company of Ukraine]]. First Channel prepared to and held the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2005]] successfully in [[Kiev]]. In 2006 [[Vitaliy Dokalenko]] was appointed as the president of the [[National Television Company of Ukraine]] by former Ukrainian president [[Viktor Yushchenko]]. In 2010 [[Yehor Benkendorf]], former chief producer of [[Inter (TV channel)|Inter TV channel]], was appointed as the president of the [[National Television Company of Ukraine]] by Ukrainian president [[Viktor Yanukovich]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kyivpost.com/news/opinion/op_ed/detail/62539/ TV-managed democracy coming soon to nation&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 September 2008, State Television went through a major rebranding that included an updated [[logo]], idents change and new program openers. The new logo consisted of the word ''Pershyi'' (''First'').&lt;ref name=encukr&gt;[http://1tv.com.ua/about/1tvnews/08/09/04/13/45.html Перший національний відтепер ПЕРШИЙ] in the [http://www.1tv.com.ua Перший канал. Офіційний сайт]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 April 2015, the channel went through another rebranding. The logo has changed to a newly created public broadcaster's after signing the bill ''On amendments to some laws of Ukraine on Public Television and Radio Broadcasting of Ukraine'' into law by [[Petro Poroshenko]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1tv.com.ua/news/channel/67485 UA: Суспільне мовлення] in the [http://www.1tv.com.ua UA:Перший. Офіційний сайт]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, this channel broadcasting [[Eurovision Song Contest 2018]] in [[1080p]] and stereo sound for several [[Cable television|cable]], [[Satellite television|satellite]] and [[IPTV]] operators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://1tv.com.ua/news/channel/102343|title=Євробачення-2018 в HD-якості|date=7 May 2018|website=1tv.com.ua|language=Ukrainian}}&lt;/ref&gt; It's currently unknown when this channel will broadcast for this resolution majorly.
