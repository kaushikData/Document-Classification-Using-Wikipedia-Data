==Plot==
Simin wants to leave the country with her husband, Nader, and daughter, Termeh, as the former does not want Termeh to grow up under the prevailing conditions. This desire is not shared by Nader, who is concerned for his father, who lives with the family and suffers from [[Alzheimer's disease]]. When Nader determines to stay in [[Iran]], Simin files for [[Divorce (Islamic)|divorce]].

The [[family court]] judges the couple's problems insufficient to warrant divorce and rejects Simin's application. She leaves her husband and daughter and moves back in with her parents. On the recommendation of Simin, Nader hires Razieh, a young, deeply religious woman from a poor suburb, to take care of his father while he is at work. Razieh has applied for the job without consulting her hot-tempered husband, Hodjat, whose approval, according to tradition, would have been required. Her family is financially dependent on the job, and she takes her daughter to the house with her.

Razieh soon becomes overwhelmed by taking care of Nader's father, which is physically and emotionally demanding. She finds the work very heavy, especially as she is pregnant. The job even tests her religious beliefs when the old man [[Urinary incontinence|wets himself]], and she must call a hotline to determine whether it would be sinful for her to clean him.

One day, Nader and Termeh return to discover her grandfather lying unconscious on the floor in his bedroom, with one of his arms tied to the bed. Razieh is nowhere to be found. When she returns, Nader accuses her of neglecting his father and of having stolen money from his room (unbeknownst to Nader, Simin used the money to pay [[Moving company|movers]]). Outraged, Nader shoves Razieh out of the apartment. She falls in the stairwell outside. Hodjat's sister later calls Simin to inform her that Razieh is in the hospital because she has suffered a [[miscarriage]].

A [[Prosecutor|prosecution]] is assigned to determine the cause of the miscarriage and Nader's potential responsibility for it. If it is proved that Nader knew of Razieh's pregnancy and caused the miscarriage, he could be sentenced for murder. Nader accuses Razieh of neglecting his father. The hot-headed and aggressive Hodjat physically confronts Nader on several occasions, and threatens him, his family, and Termeh's teacher, who testifies on Nader's behalf. When Hodjat is [[Detainment|detained]] for another outburst, Razieh reveals that he has [[mental disorder]]s, and that he is under [[therapy]], leading to his release. Nader learns that the reason Razieh was absent that day was because she had gone to visit a [[physician]], which Razieh had avoided revealing earlier. This news, combined with Hodjat's explosive temper, causes Nader to wonder if Hodjat is [[Physical abuse|physically abusive]] to Razieh and had caused her miscarriage.

Termeh protects Nader's position with a false statement and Simin, fearing for Termeh's safety, attempts to arrange a financial deal with Razieh and Hodjat, to pay [[Blood money (restitution)|blood money]] for the loss of their child. Nader is initially outraged by Simin's suggestion, as he feels that it would be an admission of guilt. But he also must admit that he lied about his knowledge of Razieh's pregnancy. However, Razieh reveals to Simin she has serious doubts as to whether Nader's actions caused the miscarriage, considering she had earlier been hit by a car while retrieving Nader's father when he had wandered out of the apartment and had first experienced symptoms of the miscarriage that night. Razieh fears that without the money Nader can provide in or out of court Hodjat will not be able to pay back his debtors, destroying their family. After another full-blown argument, Simin forces Termeh to leave with her. Nader agrees to the payment and asks Razieh to swear on the [[Qur'an]] that he is the cause of her miscarriage. Since she has doubts, she refuses, though Hodjat tries to force her to avoid dishonor in front of his creditors.

Later, at the family court, Nader and Simin have filed for a divorce once again. The judge makes their separation permanent, and asks Termeh which parent she chooses to live with. She states that she has made a decision, but asks that the judge tell her parents to wait outside before she tells him.

==Production==
The concept came from a number of personal experiences and abstract pictures which had been in [[Asghar Farhadi]]'s mind for some time. Once he decided to make the film, about a year before it premiered, it was quickly written and financed. Farhadi described the film as the "logical development" from his previous film, ''[[About Elly]]''. Like Farhadi's last three films, ''A Separation'' was made without any government support. The financing went without trouble much thanks to the success of ''About Elly''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wiseman|first=Andreas|date=18 February 2011|url=http://www.screendaily.com/reports/one-on-one/asghar-farhadi/5024047.article|title=One on One: Asghar Farhadi|work=[[Screen International|Screen Daily]]|accessdate=19 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production was granted {{USD|25000}} in support from the [[Motion Picture Association]]'s [[Asia Pacific Screen Awards|APSA]] Academy Film Fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff writer |date=4 February 2011 |url=http://www.businessofcinema.com/news.php?newsid=17677 |title=Berlin debut for MPA &amp; APSA supported Iranian film |work=Business of Cinema |publisher=Join The Dots Media |accessdate=17 February 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wYgxMWI8?url=http://www.businessofcinema.com/news.php?newsid=17677 |deadurl=yes |archivedate=17 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--Hello Steven--&gt;
In September 2010, Farhadi was banned from making the film by the Iranian [[Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance]], because of an acceptance speech held during an award ceremony where he expressed support for several Iranian film personalities. Notably he had wished to see the return to Iranian cinema of [[Mohsen Makhmalbaf]], an exiled filmmaker and Iranian opposition profile, and of the imprisoned political filmmaker [[Jafar Panahi]], both of whom had been connected to the [[Iranian Green Movement]].

===Critical reception===
The film has been met with universal acclaim from film critics. It currently holds a 99% "fresh" rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 161 reviews with an average rating of 8.9/10. The website's critical consensus states, "Morally complex, suspenseful, and consistently involving, ''A Separation'' captures the messiness of a dissolving relationship with keen insight and searing intensity",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/a_separation_2011/|title=A Separation (2011)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a score of 95 on [[Metacritic]] based on 41 reviews,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/a-separation|title=A Separation Reviews|work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive|CBS Interactive Inc.]]|accessdate=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the best-reviewed film of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/feature/best-and-worst-films-of-2011|title=The Best and Worst Movies of 2011|last=Dietz|first=Jason|date=5 February 2012|accessdate=16 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deborah Young of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' wrote from the Berlinale:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Just when it seemed impossible for Iranian filmmakers to express themselves meaningfully outside the bounds of censorship, Asghar Farhadi's ''Nader and Simin, A Separation'' comes along to prove the contrary. Apparently simple on a narrative level yet morally, psychologically and socially complex, it succeeds in bringing Iranian society into focus for in a way few other films have done.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Young noted how Farhadi portrayed Iran's social and religious divisions, and complimented the film's craft:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As in all the director's work, the cast is given top consideration and their realistic acting results in unusual depth of characterization. All five main actors stand out sharply in Mahmood Kalari's intimate cinematography. Though the film lasts over two hours, Hayedeh Safiyari's fast-moving editing keeps the action tensely involving from start to finish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Young |first=Deborah |date=15 February 2011 |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/nader-simin-a-separation-berlin-99930 |title=Nader and Simin, A Separation: Berlin Review |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |accessdate=17 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a strongly positive review from ''[[Screen Daily]]'', Lee Marshall wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Showing a control of investigative pacing that recalls classic Hitchcock and a feel for ethical nuance that is all his own, Farhadi has hit upon a story that is not only about men and women, children and parents, justice and religion in today's Iran, but that raises complex and globally relevant questions of responsibility, of the subjectivity and contingency of "telling the truth", and of how thin the line can be between inflexibility and pride – especially of the male variety – and selfishness and tyranny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=15 February 2011 |url=http://www.screendaily.com/reviews/latest-reviews/nader-and-simin-a-separation/5023837.article |title=Nader And Simin – A Separation |last=Marshall |first=Lee |work=[[Screen Daily]] |accessdate=2 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Alissa Simon from ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called it Farhadi's strongest work yet and described it:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Tense and narratively complex, formally dense and morally challenging... The provocative plot casts a revealing light on contempo Iranian society, taking on issues of gender, class, justice and honor as a secular middle-class family in the midst of upheaval winds up in conflict with an impoverished religious one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117944617/ |title=Nader and Simin, a Separation |last=Simon |first=Alissa |date=15 February 2011 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=2 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]] for ''[[The New Republic]]'' wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;You cannot watch the film without feeling kinship with the characters and admitting their decency as well as their mistakes. The American films made this year that deal with the internal detail and difficulty of family life – like ''[[The Descendants]]'' — are airy, pretty and affluent compared with ''A Separation''. With the best will in the world, [[George Clooney]] cannot discard his aura of stardom, yet the actors in the Iranian film seem caught in their characters’ traps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tnr.com/article/film/100434/separation-iran-oscars-foreign-film-hatami-farhadi|title=How Iran Produced the Best Film of 2011—and What Americans Can Learn From It|last=Thomson|first=David|authorlink=David Thomson (film critic)|date=7 February 2012|website=[[The New Republic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The film won the Fajr Film Festival's [[Crystal Simorgh]]s for Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Cinematographer and Best Sound Recorder. It also received the Audience Favourite Film award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff writer|date=19 February 2011|url=http://www.tehrantimes.com/index_View.asp?code=236083|title='Crime' crowned best film of Fajr festival|work=[[Tehran Times]]|accessdate=19 February 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wbTiGsYd?url=http://www.tehrantimes.com/index_View.asp?code=236083|deadurl=no|archivedate=19 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It won the top award, the [[Golden Bear]] for Best Film, at the [[61st Berlin International Film Festival]].

'''''Across the Line''''' is a 2015 Canadian drama film directed by [[Director X]]. It was set and shot in Nova Scotia.

==Plot==
The film is set in North Preston, Nova Scotia where Mattie ([[Stephan James]]), a black hockey player, is being considered for a professional career. However, his hopes are threatened by growing racial strife at his school while his brother Carter ([[Shamier Anderson]]) is involved in criminal activity. Mattie also has a romantic interest in Jayme ([[Sarah Jeffery]]), who already has a white boyfriend.

The film's storyline was inspired by the 1989 [[Cole Harbour District High School]] race riots.&lt;ref name=HCH13Apr2016 /&gt;

==Cast==
* [[Stephan James]] as Mattie Slaughter
* [[Sarah Jeffery]] as Jayme Crawley
* [[Shamier Anderson]] as Carter Slaughter
* Lanette Ware as Velma
* Steven Love as John
* Jim Codrington as Fraser Crawley

==Production==
The film was originally titled ''Undone''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://alumni.dal.ca/alumni-story/from-law-to-filmmaking-floyd-kane-llb96/ | title=Alumni Spotlight - A creative lawyer: Floyd Kane (LLB'96) | date=23 November 2015 | first=Jane | last=Doucet | publisher=Dalhousie University | accessdate=13 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was produced by Floyd Kane, Michael Donovan, Mark Gosine and Amos Adetuyi and was written by Kane, a native of East Preston, NS. Kane attended Cole Harbour High school when a race riot erupted at the school in 1989.

==Release==
The first screening of ''Across the Line'' was September 19, 2015 at the [[Atlantic Film Festival]] where it won the award for Best Atlantic Feature.&lt;ref name=HCH20Sep2015&gt;{{cite news | url=http://thechronicleherald.ca/artslife/1312366-undone-wins-best-atlantic-feature-at-atlantic-film-festival-awards | title=Undone wins best Atlantic feature at Atlantic Film Festival Awards | first=Andrea | last=Nemetz | date=20 September 2015 | newspaper=Chronicle Herald | accessdate=13 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HCH13Apr2016&gt;{{cite news | url=http://thechronicleherald.ca/artslife/1312095-atlantic-filmfest-undone-finds-hope-amid-racial-tension | title=Atlantic filmfest: Undone finds hope amid racial tension | first=Elissa | last=Barnard | date=18 September 2015 | newspaper=Chronicle Herald | accessdate=13 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film opened in limited release in British Columbia and Ontario on April 8, 2016, with screenings in various Canadian cities throughout that month.&lt;ref name="HCH06Apr2016"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://thechronicleherald.ca/artslife/1354640-director-x-makes-film-debut-with-drama-inspired-by-n.s.-racial-tensions-in-1989 | title=Director X makes film debut with drama inspired by N.S. racial tensions in 1989 | author=The Canadian Press | date=6 April 2016 | newspaper=Chronicle Herald | accessdate=13 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The ''[[National Post]]'' assessed the film at 2.5/4 stars, noting the story's unwavering focus on racial themes was "to the detriment of the film's depth and realism" but noted that video producer Director X "makes the transition to feature film-making look easy".&lt;ref name=NP /&gt;

In 2017, the film was the subject of an episode of ''The Filmmakers'', the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s web talk series on Canadian film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/arts/the-filmmakers/racism-sports-and-the-east-coast-director-x-s-film-exposes-something-dangerous-and-problematic-1.4316912 "Racism, sports and the East Coast: Director X's film exposes something 'dangerous and problematic'"]. [[CBC Arts]], October 2, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:An Oak Tree (conceptual art installation).jpg|thumb|300px|''An Oak Tree'' by [[Michael Craig-Martin]]. 1973]]
'''''An Oak Tree''''' is a conceptual [[work of art]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.modernart.ie/en/page_135922.htm Irish Museum of Modern Art Website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521121506/http://www.modernart.ie/en/page_135922.htm |date=May 21, 2009 }} modernart.ie&lt;/ref&gt; created by [[Michael Craig-Martin]] in 1973. The piece, described as being an [[oak tree]], is installed in two units&amp;nbsp;– a pristine installation of a glass of water on a glass shelf on metal brackets 253 centimetres above the ground, and a text mounted on the wall. When first exhibited, the text was given as a handout.&lt;ref name=bery&gt;Bery, Bryony. [http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=-1&amp;workid=27072&amp;searchid=false&amp;roomid=false&amp;tabview=text&amp;texttype=11 "An Oak Tree 1973: Technique and condition text"], [[Tate]], June 2005.

The text takes the form of a Q&amp;A about the artwork, in which Craig-Martin describes changing "a glass of water into a full-grown oak tree without altering the [[accident (philosophy)|accidents]] of the glass of water," and explains that "the actual oak tree is physically present but in the form of the glass of water." 
Craig-Martin considered "the work of art in such a way as to reveal its single basic and essential element, belief that is the confident faith of the artist in his capacity to speak and the willing faith of the viewer in accepting what he has to say".&lt;ref name=manchester/&gt;

The ''[[Catholic Herald]]'' compared the work to the [[Roman Catholic]] doctrine of [[Transubstantiation]] and the [[Real Presence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What Tate Modern teaches us about transubstantiation|url=http://archive.catholicherald.co.uk/article/8th-march-2002/12/what-tate-modern-teaches-us-about-transubstantiati|newspaper=Catholic Herald|date=8 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original is in the [[National Gallery of Australia]], and an artist's copy is on loan to the [[Tate]] gallery.

==Artwork==
''An Oak Tree'' is a [[work of art]] created by [[Michael Craig-Martin]] in 1973, and is now exhibited with the accompanying text, originally issued as a leaflet.&lt;ref name=bery/&gt; The text is in red print on white; the object is a French [[Duralex]] glass, which contains water to a level stipulated by the artist and which is located on a glass shelf, whose ideal height is 253 centimetres with matte grey-painted brackets screwed to the wall.&lt;ref name=bery/&gt; The text is behind glass and is fixed to the wall with four bolts.&lt;ref name=bery/&gt; Craig-Martin has stressed that the components should maintain a pristine appearance and in the event of deterioration, the brackets should be resprayed and the glass and shelf even replaced.&lt;ref name=bery/&gt;

The text contains a semiotic argument,&lt;ref name=sherwin&gt;[[Brian Sherwin|Sherwin, Brian]]. [http://www.myartspace.com/blog/2007/08/art-space-talk-michael-craig-martin.html "Art Space Talk: Michael Craig-Martin"], myartspace.com, 16 August 2007. Retrieved 31 October 2008.&lt;!-- NOTE TO EDITORS This is part of a site with editorial oversight, not a solo blog.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; in the form of questions and answers,&lt;ref name=manchester/&gt; which explain that it is not a glass of water, but "a full-grown oak tree," created "without altering the accidents of the glass of water."&lt;ref name =CMtext/&gt; The text defines accidents as "The colour, feel, weight, size...". The text includes the statement "It's not a symbol. I have changed the physical substance of the glass of water into that of an oak tree. I didn't change its appearance. The actual oak tree is physically present, but in the form of a glass of water."&lt;ref name=CMtext/&gt; and "It would no longer be accurate to call it a glass of water. One could call it anything one wished but that would not alter the fact that it is an oak tree."&lt;ref name=CMtext/&gt;

The impossible is deliberately asserted and the text examines the impossibility of the assertion, which uses the idea of [[transubstantiation]] in the same way as the [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] religious belief that bread and wine, while maintaining an unchanged appearance, are changed into [[Jesus Christ|Christ]]'s body and blood.&lt;ref name=manchester/&gt; Craig-Martin has a Catholic background&lt;ref&gt;Crane, Charlie.

Retrieved 10 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He sees belief of both artist and viewer as having a key place in art, and that in ''An Oak Tree'' he had "deconstructed the work of art in such a way as to reveal its single basic and essential element", namely this belief.&lt;ref name=manchester/&gt;

''An Oak Tree'' was a turning point in his artistic development: prior to it his concern had been deconstruction, and afterwards he was "trying to put the pieces together again."&lt;ref name=manchester/&gt; Subsequently, using the rationale of [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'', he worked with drawings of utilitarian objects and flat areas of colour, with the goal of discarding meaning, which is "both persistent and unstable", although he states that people's need to create associations and meanings makes this goal unachievable.&lt;ref name=manchester/&gt;

==History==
''An Oak Tree'' was first shown in an exhibition of Craig-Martin's work at the Rowan Gallery, off [[Bond Street]], London, in 1974.&lt;ref name=manchester/&gt;&lt;ref name=cork&gt;Cork, Richard. [http://www.newstatesman.com/200610090033 "Losing our vision"], ''[[New Statesman]]'', 9 October 2006. Retrieved 11 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Many visitors assumed that Craig-Martin was playing the ultimate con trick, as there seemed no evidence of work on display in the white-walled gallery.&lt;ref name=cork/&gt; However, high up on a wall was the glass of water and the glass shelf of the work ''An Oak Tree''.&lt;ref name=cork/&gt; At this time the accompanying text was available as a leaflet.&lt;ref name=manchester/&gt;

The original was purchased by the [[National Gallery of Australia]] in Canberra in 1977; an artist's copy is on loan to the [[Tate]] gallery in London from a private collection.&lt;ref name=sherwin/&gt;&lt;ref name=tate&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?workid=27072 An Oak Tree 1973], [[Tate]]. Retrieved 2 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Craig-Martin said, "''An Oak Tree'' has had a great life as an artwork. It is nearly always on view somewhere, and has been shown all over the world—the text has been translated into at least 20 languages. The only place it has never been shown is in the US."&lt;ref name=sherwin/&gt;

It was once barred by Australian officials from entering the country as "vegetation".&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3724/is_/ai_n9313373/ Damien, the oak tree and me]. ''Spectator'',  Dec 27, 2003  by Bidgood, Jonathan&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-112411749/damien-oak-tree-and.html&lt;/ref&gt; Craig-Martin was forced to inform them that it was really a glass of water. He said, "It was of course a wonderfully funny incident, particularly because it extended into 'real life' the discussion about belief and doubt, and fact and fiction I was addressing in the work."&lt;ref name=sherwin/&gt;

==Critical reaction==
''An Oak Tree'' is a celebrated artwork,&lt;ref name="Hubbart"&gt;[[Sue Hubbard]]. [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/reviews/michael-craigmartin-a-is-for-umbrella-gagosian-gallery-london-764282.html "A is for Umbrella"], ''[[The Independent]]'', 11 December 2007. Retrieved 4 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; which the [[Irish Museum of Modern Art]] says is now recognised as a turning point in the development of [[conceptual art]], although initially it was met with surprise, if not scorn.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title= Michael Craig-Martin at the Irish Museum of Modern Art | publisher=ARTINFO  | date= October 5, 2006| url=http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/21219/michael-craig-martin-at-the-irish-museum-of-modern-art/ | accessdate=2008-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as "questioning the nature of reality."&lt;ref name=Hubbart/&gt;

The ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' states that "to fail to consider it a great work of art because it fails to give rise to a distinctively aesthetic kind of pleasure does not actually undermine the project at all. Conceptual art, as we now know, is about conveying meaning through a vehicular medium, and not to provide its audience with experiences of, say, beauty. Any attack on this fundamental feature of conceptual art targets not so much an individual piece but the artform as such."&lt;ref&gt;Schellekens, Elisabeth. "[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/conceptual-art/ Conceptual Art]". ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Fall 2008 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In his [[Richard Dimbleby Lecture]] on 23 November 2000, Sir [[Nicholas Serota]] said, "We may not 'like' Craig-Martin's work, but it certainly reminds us that the appreciation of all art involves an act of faith comparable to the belief that, through [[transubstantiation]], the bread and wine of Holy Communion become the body and blood of Christ."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/theres-no-need-to-be-afraid-of-the-present-625001.html The Independent]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Damien Hirst]] said, "That piece is, I think, the greatest piece of conceptual sculpture, I still can't get it out of my head."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Craig-Martin [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/11/24/sm_michaelcraigmartin.xml&amp;page=2 Out of the ordinary]. Telegraph Magazine, 24 November 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Cork]] called its original display in 1974 "one of the most challenging moments" of contemporary art.&lt;ref name=cork/&gt;

[[Anthony Caro]] said, "Some of the stuff that's called art is just damned stupid. I mean, 'That glass of water's an oak tree' kind of thing."&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, James. [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2005/jan/08/art2 "Heavy metal pioneer"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 8 January 2005. Retrieved 5 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Art critic [[David Lee (art critic)|David Lee]] and the founders of the [[Stuckism]] art movement, [[Billy Childish]] and [[Charles Thomson (artist)|Charles Thomson]] also oppose it.&lt;ref name=sherwin/&gt;

In response to [[Nigel Gosling]]'s praise of the work, [[Giles Auty]] said, "How would the self-same critic react if, on ordering oak planks for an outhouse, he were sent instead a bucketful of water? Would he gently muse on 'the subtle and obscure waters of identity'—or make immediate reflections on the mental wellbeing of his timber suppliers?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O5-CraigMartinMichael.html "Craig-Martin, Michael"], ''A Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Art''. Retrieved from encyclopedia.com, 5 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brian Sewell]] asked why "the miracle" was "a work of art fit only for a gallery, and not some thaumaturgical object venerated in a church?"&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Sewell|Sewell, Brian]]. "If only Michelangelo had become a greengrocer", ''[[Evening Standard]]'', p 34, 25 February 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[ArtWatch International|Michael Daley]] wrote that the work was "not a hard-won, skilful depiction of a glass and a shelf" and that for twenty years "instead of ridiculing the self-deluding, pretentious offerings of Craig-Martin and his like, critics fawned and eulogised."&lt;ref&gt;Daley, Michael.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4853">'''Anti-fashion''' is an umbrella term for various styles of dress which are explicitly contrary to the [[fashion]] of the day. Anti-fashion styles may represent an attitude of indifference or may arise from political or practical goals which make fashion a secondary priority. The term is sometimes even used for styles championed by high-profile designers, when they encourage or create trends that do not follow the mainstream fashion of the time. This anti-fashion was adopted in response to the 'overly fashion conscious' fans of bands such as the [[Sex Pistols]].&lt;ref name = "communication"&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[Grunge]] is an example of the oppositional style of dress while the [[rational dress]] of the Victorian era, which allowed ladies to swim or bicycle, is an example of a functional anti-fashion.&lt;ref name = "alternative"&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wy_-5HFcOrwC&amp;pg=PA77 |title=Alternative femininities |author=Samantha Holland |chapter=Anti-fashion and feminism|isbn=9781859738085 |date=2004-09-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A trend for feminist women to dress in ways that do not follow the norms for women's clothing has been described as anti-fashion, though research suggested many women who dress this way do not choose to label themselves this way, in the opinion of author Samantha Holland this is because the women do not like the confrontational overtones of the term.&lt;ref name = "alternative"/&gt;

==History==
In the 1990s, a [[minimalist]] style described as anti fashion emerged on both sides of the Atlantic where young people would typically wear simple clothes such as black jeans and white T-shirts without a visible brand name. Another period of anti-fashion has taken place in the 1950s with the advent of rock and roll, especially with young adolescent women.

Instead of the standard of wearing a dress or skirt, particularly hoop skirts and poodle skirts, many young women wore [[jeans]] and plaid shirts, or simple plain [[T shirt]]s in rebellion with the [[gender role]]s and societal norms at that time. This fashion has the roots of many modern anti-fashion trends, such as grunge, decades later.

==Examples==
Another example, this time from the early 20th century, was promoted by the legendary designer [[Coco Chanel|Gabrielle Chanel]] - a  "poor girl" woman's style where rich ladies could look like regular women while still dressing in clothes that showed their quality under close inspection.&lt;ref name = "adorned"&gt;{{citation

The dress sense of the [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] has been described as anti fashion, in that it reflects indifference to current fashion in favor of traditional style.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Anti-fashion has also been used to describe simple fashion adopted by hardcore [[punk subculture|punks]] in the 1980s. At its strictest, it consists of a plain white T-shirt, black trousers or plain jeans and black boots, with the hair cut short.

==2017 Museum exhibition studying anti-fashion==
Starting in May 2017 fashion/anti-fashion is one of the thematic fashion pairings which was examined in an exhibit studying the works of [[Rei Kawakubo]] at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]'s in New York.&lt;ref&gt;Time magazine. Kawakubo announcement of 2017 exhibit. [http://time.com/4540904/comme-des-garcons-rei-kawakubo-met-gala-theme-2017/]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Bolton (curator)|Andrew Bolton]], the curator for the Kawakubo exhibit at the Met stated that the exhibit in May 2017 will be an austere, all-white maze hosting approximately 150 Comme ensembles. Both the exhibit and accompanying book by Bolton are based upon the recurrent fashion dichotomies concentrating on eight thematic oppositions listed as: (1) fashion/anti-fashion; (2) design/not design; (3) model/multiple; (4) then/now; (5) high/low; (6) self/other; (7) object/subject; and (8) clothes/not clothes.&lt;ref name="Lynn Yaeger 2017"&gt;Lynn Yaeger.

[[File:Антон-Митов-автопортрет.jpg|thumb|200px|Self-portrait (date unknown)]]
[[File:Anton Mitov - Pazar na zelenchutzi v Sofia.jpg|thumb|325px|Pottery Market in Sofia (1917)]]
'''Anton Stefanov Mitov''' (Bulgarian: Антон Стефанов Митов; 1 April 1862, [[Stara Zagora]] - 20 August 1930, [[Sofia]]) was a Bulgarian painter, art critic, art historian, social activist and corresponding member of the [[Bulgarian Academy of Sciences]].

==Biography ==
When he was fifteen, [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] troops burned his hometown and massacred over 14,000 people. His  family fled to [[Svishtov]], where they lived in poverty. He took a job as a clerk in Romania and remained there until Bulgaria was [[Liberation of Bulgaria|liberated]] in 1878, returning home determined to be an artist. In 1881, after working as a telegraph operator for two years, he saved enough money to enroll at the [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Firenze]] where he studied under the direction of [[Giuseppe Ciaranfi]]. Upon his return home, he worked as a journalist and a teacher in Stara Zagoda, [[Plovdiv]], [[Varna]] and Sofia.

In 1896, he was one of the co-founders of the [[National Academy of Arts]]&lt;br /&gt; in Sofia, where he taught art history, drawing and perspective. He served two terms as its Director, from 1912 to 1918, and from 1924 to 1927. In 1898, he was part of a team of artists that decorated the [[Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, Sofia|Alexander Nevsky Cathedral]]. One of the first Bulgarian painters to exhibit internationally, he played a decisive role in dispelling the image of his country as a cultural backwater.

He was also active in the nation's political and cultural life, making contributions to many newspapers such as ''Balkan Dawn'', ''Evening Post'' and ''World'' as well as the magazine ''Art'' (usually under pseudonyms, such as "Tonino" and "Arnold"). He also lectured extensively and did book illustrations (those for ''[[Under the Yoke]]'' by [[Ivan Vazov]] are, perhaps, best known).

Among his works are the first [[seascape]]s painted in Bulgaria, although he specialized in [[Genre art|genre]] art and portraits. A street in Plovdiv is named after him. His brother [[Georgi Mitov|Georgi]] was also a well-known painter.

'''''Club Dread''''' (also known as '''''Broken Lizard's Club Dread''''') is a 2004 American [[comedy horror|horror comedy]] film directed by [[Jay Chandrasekhar]] and written by and starring the comedy troupe [[Broken Lizard]]—Chandrasekhar, [[Kevin Heffernan (actor)|Kevin Heffernan]], [[Steve Lemme]], [[Paul Soter]], and [[Erik Stolhanske]]. [[Brittany Daniel]], [[Bill Paxton]], and [[Jordan Ladd]] play supporting roles.

Though the story is set on an island in Costa Rica, filming took place in Mexico.

==Plot==
Pleasure Island is a resort off the coast of [[Costa Rica]], owned by famous musician Coconut Pete. Staff members Rolo, Stacy, and Kelly sneak into the jungle to have sex. They are ambushed by a masked figure, who stabs Rolo to death. The killer chases the girls through the jungle. The killer pushes Kelly off a cliff and decapitates Stacy before she can reach help.

The resort staff remain unaware of the killings until Carlos' body is found behind the kitchen. Dave relates a story about a former employee who lost his mind and murdered his fellow staff members; though Pete insists it's a story made up to scare guests around the campfire, the mounting death toll suggests otherwise. Putman alerts the others when he finds Cliff murdered in a hedge maze. A message left by the killer suggests that he is targeting only the staff. All communication devices and transportation have been stolen or destroyed.

Hank, a former FBI agent, convinces the staff to continue with their jobs and allow him to catch the killer. Yu remains intent on warning the guests, despite warnings not to do so from the killer. When she lures the guests to the beach to make the announcement, she is attacked by the killer. Hank intervenes, but the killer slashes his throat and turns on Yu. Their bodies are found the next day.

The staff begins to suspect one of the guests, Penelope. Juan, believing her innocent, tries to eliminate her as a suspect. Putman disappears into the jungle after having a nightmare. Sam and Dave find a shrine of photos of Lars and his friends, in which all of the faces except Lars' have been replaced with Pete's; suspicion turns on Lars and the staff lock Lars in a room. The killer electrocutes one of the guests, causing a power failure. Putman returns, and he and Jenny deduce that Lars is not the killer, but Lars has escaped.

When Pete is found dead, the staff members turn on each other. Jenny tries to convince the group that they must work together to survive until the shuttle from the mainland returns for the guests. They reject this and split into smaller groups. Dave manages to restore the electricity. Jenny and Lars are drawn by music to the electricity hut where they find Dave's severed head. Putman is next to be killed.

During a party in the nightclub, Jenny and Lars discover Dave and Putman's bodies. The guests see the corpses and a panic ensues. Penelope, Juan, Lars and Jenny find Sam's apparently lifeless body in a mud bath. While they consider their next move, Sam leaps from the bath with a machete and grabs Lars.

Sam reveals that he wanted to kill everyone on the island because Pete had intended to sell the island to the military, but decided to give the island to Dave. Jealous, Sam decided that Dave would mismanage the resort and destroy it. Lars grabs the machete, allowing the others to escape. Penelope is lost among the party-crazed guests, and Jenny and Juan lock themselves in the nightclub. They see Sam drowning Penelope in a large tank. Juan smashes the tank and rescues Penelope. Sam prepares to kill them, but Lars appears and stabs Sam.

Sam pursues Lars, Jenny, Penelope, and Juan as they escape through the jungle. Cornered on a cliff, they jump to the water below. They find the resort's damaged boats, and try to cobble together enough working parts to leave the island. Sam appears and kills Juan, then attacks Jenny and Penelope. Lars overcomes Sam, and Sam is bisected by a rope attached to the power boat. As they motor away, Sam's lower half continues to pursue them despite his fatal wounds.

==Soundtrack==
On one of the disc's commentary tracks the filmmakers state that they screened the film for [[Jimmy Buffett]], who was so amused that he requested permission to sing some of the film's songs on one of his live tours.

==Critical reception==
''Club Dread'' has received mixed reviews, scoring 45 on review aggregator site [[Metacritic]] based on 28 critics reviews, and 29% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 96 reviews. According to Rotten Tomatoes the consensus was "Comedy is too hit-or-miss in this slasher spoof".

==Alternate version==
In 2005, an unrated edition was released to [[DVD]]. This version of the film contains an additional 15 minutes of footage for a 118-minute running time. It features several extended scenes, and also restores a subplot involving two cops (played by Paco Mauri and [[Tony Amendola]]) that was absent in the theatrical edition. Director [[Jay Chandrasekhar]] states in one of the disc's commentary tracks that the original R-rated version is still the director's cut.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6564">'''Corpus Vasorum Antiquorum''' ("corpus of ancient vases"; abbreviated '''CVA''') is an international [[research project]] for [[ceramic]] documentation of the [[Classical antiquity|classical area]].

==Overview==
CVA is the first and oldest research project of the [[Union Académique Internationale]]. The first project meeting was organized by [[Edmond Pottier]] in [[Paris]] in 1919. The final decision was to publish a comprehensive catalogue of painted [[Pottery of ancient Greece|ancient Greek vase]]s. He was also the publisher of the first [[File folder|fascicle]] for the [[Louvre]] in 1922.  At that time six countries were part of the project. Today the project covers a compendium of more than 100,000 vases located in collections of 26 participating countries. At present day only public collections located in museums are added to the catalogue.

Every participating country is completely responsible for its own scope, while the [[Union Académique Internationale]] in Brussels has the patronage traditionally led by a French scientist. Currently in charge is {{Interlanguage link multi|Juliette de La Genière|fr}}.

The CVA publishes Greek and Italian ceramics of the classical period between the seventh millennium B.C. and the [[late Antiquity]] (third-fifth century A.D.). The publications are divided into [[File folder|fascicles]] by country and museum. By the end of 2007 a total of 350 volumes consisting of 40,000 fascicles were published. One of the largest amounts of publications was done in Germany: 84 volumes and 3 supplements.

Since 2004 all textual descriptions and images are freely accessible as a web-based database (CVA Online). Languages allowed for publication are English, French, German and Italian. Further publication rules have to be fulfilled. This often requires a restoration of the actual objects. For example: fragments have to be distinctively different from restored parts. For older restorations this is often not the case.

The documentation of a vessel is done in several steps. First the vessel is described in its overall condition followed by an iconographic interpretation. If possible an artist or a workshop will be determined. Integral parts of the documentation are photographs and hand-drawings depending on the condition of the vessel and the projects budget. The Austrian commission used for the first-time of the CVA a [[3D scanner|3D-Scanner]] for documentation of vessel shapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | author=Hubert Mara |author2=Elisabeth Trinkl |author3=Paul Kammerer |author4=Ernestine Zolda | title = 3D-Acquisition and Multi-Spectral Readings for Documentation of Polychrome Ceramics in the Antiquities Collection of the Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna | url = http://www.archimuse.com/ichim07/papers/mara/mara.html  | booktitle = Proceedings of the International Cultural Heritage Informatics Meeting (ICHIM)  | year = 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kunsthistorisches2009"&gt;{{citation | author=Kunsthistorisches Museum - Antikensammlung | title = Scientific projects of the KHM: Corpus Vasorum Antiquorum KHM Band 5 (Attisch rotfigurige Vasen Band 4 | url = http://www.khm.at/de/erfahren/forschung/forschungsprojekte/antikensammlung/corpus-vasorum-antiquorum-khm-band-5/ | booktitle = Annual report of the KHM (see also) | date = 2009-12-09 | publisher=online services and annual report }}&lt;/ref&gt; A follow-up project using 3D-acquisition was granted.&lt;ref name="Austrian2007"&gt;{{citation | author=Austrian Science Foundation (FWF) | title = Attische Keramik im KHM Wien  | url = http://pf.fwf.ac.at/de/wissenschaft-konkret/project-finder/19156 | date = 2007-10-06 | publisher=online services }}&lt;/ref&gt; The high-resolution 3D-datasets of the Austrian projects were processed using the [[GigaMesh Software Framework]] providing digital profile lines and unwrappings (or rollouts) as basis for the figures of the final publication.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2160">The '''Council for Maintaining the Occupations''' ({{lang-fr|Conseil pour le Maintien des Occupations}}), or '''CMDO''', was a revolutionary committee formed during the [[May 1968 events in France]] originating in the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]].&lt;ref name="Vienet1968TheCouncil"&gt;René Viénet (1968) ''[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/enrages08.html The "Council for Maintaining the Occupations" and Councilist Tendencies]''. Enragés and Situationists in the Occupations Movement (Paris, May 1968). Translated by Loren Goldner and Paul Sieveking.&lt;/ref&gt; The council favored the continuation of [[wildcat strike|wildcat]] [[general strike]]s and [[factories occupation|factory occupations]] across France, maintaining them through [[direct democracy|directly democratic]] [[workers' councils]].&lt;ref name="Vienet1968TheCouncil"/&gt; Within the revolutionary movement, it opposed the influence of major [[trade unions]] and the [[French Communist Party]] who intended to contain the revolt and compromise with General [[Charles de Gaulle]].&lt;ref name="Debord1969TheBeginning"&gt;Guy Debord, Mustapha Khayati, René Riesel, Christian Sébastiani, Raoul Vaneigem, René Viénet (1969) ''[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/beginning.html The Beginning of an Era]''. Internationale Situationniste #12 (Paris, September 1969).Translated by Ken Knabb.&lt;/ref&gt;

The council implemented a policy of equal representation for its participants. It was described by [[Situationist International|Situationist]] [[René Viénet]] as "essentially an uninterrupted general assembly, deliberating day and night. No faction or private meetings ever existed outside the common debate." It was formed on the evening of May 17, by supporters of the [[Occupation Committee of the Sorbonne|Sorbonne Occupation Committee]].&lt;ref name="Vienet1968TheCouncil"/&gt;

'''''Crime Illustrated''''' was a black-and-white magazine published by [[EC Comics]] in late 1955 and early 1956. Part of EC's [[List of Entertaining Comics publications#Picto-Fiction|Picto-Fiction]] line, each magazine featured three to five stories. The format alternated panels of typography with panels of illustrations. Thus, it was arranged in tiers like a comic book but eliminated hand-lettering, balloons and panel borders.

The first issue appeared with a cover date of November–December 1955. ''Crime Illustrated'' ran for a total of two issues. The Picto-Fiction magazines lost money from the start, and when EC's distributor went bankrupt, they had no choice but to cancel them.

==Writers==
The editor of ''Crime Illustrated'' was [[Al Feldstein]]. As with EC's comics, Feldstein was the most prolific writer of this title, and generally wrote up to three stories per issue. In addition to stories credited to him, Feldstein also wrote using the pseudonyms Maxwell Williams and Alfred E. Neuman. In a move suggested by publisher [[William Gaines]], Feldstein included retellings of previous stories: the first issue's "Fall Guy for Murder" and "Mother's Day", and the second issue's "Screenplay for Murder" and "Pieces of Hate". Writers included [[Jack Oleck]] (who had contributed to EC's earlier publications), Richard Smith and John Larner.

==Artists==
Artists featured in ''Crime Illustrated'' include [[Joe Orlando]], [[Bernard Krigstein]], [[Reed Crandall]], [[Graham Ingels]], [[George Evans (comics)|George Evans]], [[Jack Davis (cartoonist)|Jack Davis]] and [[Johnny Craig]].

==Reprints==
''Crime Illustrated'' was reprinted along with the other Picto-Fiction magazines in hardbound volumes by Russ Cochran (and [[Gemstone Publishing]]) in 2006 as part of his ''Complete EC Library''. These reprints also included the first-time publication of the third issue (assembled in 1956 but never published by EC).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21969">[[File:Cae halle germany 2010.jpg|thumb|Critical Art Ensemble in Halle/Saale, Germany performing "Radiation Burn: A Temporary Monument to Public Safety", October 15th 2010.]]'''Critical Art Ensemble''' ('''CAE''') is a collective of five [[tactical media]] practitioners of various specializations including computer graphics and web design, film/video, photography, text art, book art, and performance. For CAE, tactical media is situational, ephemeral, and self-terminating. It encourages the use of any media that will engage a particular socio-political context in order to create molecular interventions and semiotic shocks that collectively could diminish the rising intensity of authoritarian culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.critical-art.net/TacticalMedia.html Critical Art Ensemble]&lt;/ref&gt;
Since its formation in 1987 in Tallahassee, Florida,{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} CAE has been frequently invited to exhibit and perform projects examining issues surrounding information, communications and bio-technologies by museums and other cultural institutions. These include the Whitney Museum and the New Museum in NYC; the Corcoran Museum in Washington D.C.; the ICA, London; the MCA, Chicago; Schirn Kunsthalle, Frankfurt; Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris; the London Museum of Natural History; Kunsthalle Luzern, and dOCUMENTA 13.

The collective has written 7 books, and its writings have been translated into 18 languages.

Its work has been covered by art journals, including Artforum, Kunstforum, and The Drama Review. Critical Art Ensemble is the recipient of awards, including the 2007 Andy Warhol Foundation Wynn Kramarsky Freedom of Artistic Expression Grant, the 2004 John Lansdown Award for Multimedia, and the 2004 Leonardo New Horizons Award for Innovation.

==History==

===1986–1990===

Formed in 1987, CAE's focus has been on the exploration of the intersections between art, [[critical theory]], technology, and political activism. In 1986, [[Steve Kurtz]] and Steve Barnes began a collaboration to make low-tech videos with students. They credited each person who contributed to the productions under the signature of Critical Art Ensemble. During the summer of 1987, the group transformed into a broad-based artist and activist collective with six core members: Steve Kurtz, Steve Barnes, Dorian Burr, Beverly Schlee, [[Ricardo Dominguez (professor)]] and Hope Kurtz. In 1987, the group's first multimedia exhibitions were held at Club Nu in Miami and Pappy's Lounge in Jackson, Mississippi. In 1988, the group's first events are produced: ''Political Art In Florida?'' in collaboration with [[Group Material]], and ''Frontier Production'' in collaboration with [[Thomas Lawson (artist)|Thomas Lawson]]. In 1988-89, CAE begin to release their books of plagiarist text poetry (of which there are six in all). In 1989, the group collaborate with [[Gran Fury]] to release ''Cultural Vaccines'', a multimedia event in Tallahassee, Florida, which critiques U.S. policy on HIV. In 1990, the group collaborated with Prostitutes of New York to create ''Peep Show'' which premiered at Window on Gaines in Tallahassee, Florida.

===1991–1995===

In 1991, a body of work titled ''Fiesta Critica'' was developed in Indiantown, Florida, with local migrant workers; addressing Floridian agricultural labour relations. CAE produces an Easter fiesta platform to show the works. In 1992, the group produces ''Exit Culture'' as a series of works developed for [[Highway Culture]]. They also propose ''The Electronic Disturbance'' to [[Autonomedia]] publishers. In 1993, the group is invited to perform their first appearance in Europe at the Audio/Visual Experimental festival in the Netherlands. They complete the associational documentary series ''Apocalypse and Utopia''. In 1994, [[Autonomedia]] publishes ''The Electronic Disturbance'' and construction begins to create CAE's website [http://www.critical-art.net Critical Art Ensemble]. CAE projects begin to appear in both real and virtual forms as the ''Useless Technology'' project is performed as street action and launched online. The concept of electronic civil disobedience is introduced at the ''Terminal Futures'' conference in London. In 1995, the concept of the data body is introduced in lectures at the [[Ars Electronica]]. The group tours around Europe with the performance of ''Body Count''.

===1996–2000===

In 1996, [[Autonomedia]] publishes ''Electronic Civil Disobedience'' (the companion text to ''The Electronic Disturbance''), and research begins for the book ''Flesh Machine''. In 1997, the group tours ''Flesh Frontiers and Shareholder's Briefing''. [[Castelvecchi]] publishes the Italian translation of ''The Electronic Disturbance''. The group goes to [[Documenta X]] in Kassel, Germany to begin the editing and conceptualizing process for the book ''README: Ascii Culture and the Revenge of Knowledge'' at Hybrid Workspace. The performance of ''Flesh Machine'' is toured, premiering in Vienna and closing in Helsinki at Kiasma Museum of Contemporary Art in summer 1998. [[L'Eclat]] publishes the French anthology of CAE's writings titled ''La Resistance Electronique''. In 1998, [[Autonomedia]] publishes ''Flesh Machine'' and the German translation is published by Passagen. The group's street action occurs in Sheffield, UK, with the performance of ''The International Campaign for Free Alcohol and Tobacco for the Unemployed''. [[Castelvecchi]] publishes the Italian translation of ''Electronic Civil Disobedience''. In 1999, ''The Society for Reproductive Anachronisms'' is premiered at Rutgers University in the student cafeteria. Work begins on ''Cult of the New Eve'' (CoNE) and is premiered at St. Clara Hospital in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. A new book project is begun, entitled ''Digital Resistance: Explorations in Tactical Media''. In 2000, [[Autonomedia]] publishes ''Digital Resistance: Explorations in Tactical Media'' and the German anthology of CAE's writings on electronic media is published by Passagen.&lt;ref&gt;
Critical Art Ensemble, 'Timeline', pp. 132-135.&lt;/ref&gt;

The group has exhibited and performed at diverse venues internationally, ranging from the street, to the museum, to the internet. Museum exhibitions include the Whitney Museum and The New Museum in NYC; The Corcoran Museum in Washington D.C.; The ICA, London; The MCA, Chicago; Schirn Kunsthalle, Frankfurt; Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris; and The London Museum of Natural History.

===2003–2004===
Free Range Grain was a performance-based project which tested foods to contest the global food trade system. The project used basic molecular biology techniques over a 72-hour period to test foods that others deemed suspicious of "contamination" even when the authorities were guarding against them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.critical-art.net/Biotech.html Critical Art Ensemble]&lt;/ref&gt; This performance sought to explore biotechnology and the science behind it, as the artists felt it was "one of the most misunderstood areas of production in the cultural landscape".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.critical-art.net/FRG.html Critical Art Ensemble]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works and artistic approach==

===Performance style===
In its performances, CAE creates various performative identities, such as that of a group of scientists or a corporation. Instead of using fancy, high-tech machinery they use 'high school lab equipment as well as common household supplies and groceries',&lt;ref name="sholette1"&gt;Sholette 2005, p.51.&lt;/ref&gt; which brings the scientific difficulty down to a level at which the public can understand and engage with because the worlds of science and technology in the modern world are 'increasingly privatised'.&lt;ref name="sholette1"&gt;Sholette 2005, p.51.&lt;/ref&gt; This playful style, however, contrasts with the groups numerous books and manifestos which have an analytical focus.&lt;ref name="sholette1"&gt;Sholette 2005, p.51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicola Triscott is the founder of [[Arts Catalyst|The Arts Catalyst]]. In her writings about the CAE, she states that their participatory theatre 'aims to involve the public in the processes of biotechnology in order to contribute to the development of an informed and critical public discourse on contemporary bioscience'.&lt;ref name="triscott2"&gt;Triscott 2009, p.151.&lt;/ref&gt; This provides people with knowledge of how science can be interesting and that it can be misused if in the wrong hands. Their works have ranged from genetically modified food, the Human Genome Project (CoNE), reproductive technologies, genetic screening and transgenics. The way they approach this style is through directly engaging with the science and presenting techniques generally unknown to the public in a performative way.&lt;ref name="triscott2"&gt;Triscott 2009, p.151.&lt;/ref&gt;

:The work of the CAE continues to entertain, inform and show the public how biotechnology can be demonstrated via performance.&lt;ref name="sholette1"&gt;Sholette 2005, p.51.&lt;/ref&gt; 

:As part of their critical objectives, they target their attention on private corporations unknown in the public sector who misuse biotechnology. This tactical response is what the CAE have termed 'Fuzzy Biological Sabotage' (or FBS if abbreviated).&lt;ref&gt;Sholette 2005, p.52.&lt;/ref&gt;

:Using harmless biological species including plants, insects and reptiles, they make sophisticated pranks 'to operate in the grey, in-between spaces as yet unregulated by institutional regimes'&lt;ref&gt;Sholette 2005, p. 52. cited in [http://www.critical-art.net/MolecularInvasion.html ''Molecular Invasion'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publications===

The collective has written 7 books, and its writings have been translated into 18 languages. Its books include: ''The Electronic Disturbance'' (1994), ''Electronic Civil Disobedience &amp; Other Unpopular Ideas'' (1996), ''Flesh Machine: Cyborgs, Designer Babies, &amp; New Eugenic Consciousness'' (1998), ''Digital Resistance: Explorations in Tactical Media'' (2001), ''Molecular Invasion'' (2002), ''Marching Plague'' (2006), and the project book ''Disturbances'' (2012).

CAE is noted for having written the article [http://www.critical-art.net/books/ted/ted2.pdf Nomadic Power and Cultural Resistance], in which CAE argues that with the creation of the [[internet]] the power of the elite has become mobile to the extent that it is difficult for a dissident to directly confront the authority, comparing the untrackable, elusive mobility to that of the [[Scythians]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Electronic Disturbance'', 11-30. New York: Autonomoedia, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; They demolished the idea that power cannot corrupt and co-opt network and hypertext technologies, that such technologies have a predetermined and manifest destiny of freedom.&lt;ref name="reader2003"&gt;The New Media Reader. New York: The MIT, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; CAE goes on to observe that occupation theory &lt;!-- why is there no page on this theory? --&gt;itself is challenged by [[cyberspace]] and the difficulties it presents in terms of focusing a group effort against one authority as opposed to a singular hacker, fiddling with code. An important distinction is made that when rebellious acts are carried out by an individual as opposed to a group in singularity, that the dissenter is seen as a vandal instead of a protester. The article mentions that resistance in the form posters, pamphleteering, street theater and public art have been useful in the past but now that the public is electronically engaged one must bring their resistance methods online.
&lt;ref name="reader2003"/&gt;

===Molecular Invasion===

In correlation to CAE's work "Molecular Invasion (2002)" the collective hosted an exhibit about genetically modified crops. They planted [[Monsanto]]'s genetically modified seeds that were designed to be immune to Monsanto's commercial pesticide [[Roundup (herbicide)|roundup]] (Glyphosate). They successfully grew these crops in their exhibit however once the plants were fully grown they applied an enzyme inhibitor that was reverse engineered to the plants that eradicated the protection that these crops had against the pesticide. The plants quickly died. This exhibit was a statement against genetically modified foods.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

===Cult of the New Eve===

In 1999, CAE began a new project to draw attention to the ways in which scientific discourses surrounding biotechnologies drew upon promissory religious rhetoric. This participatory performance was titled ''Cult of the New Eve'' (or CoNE when abbreviated) and included a "communion" using a random library of the entire genome of the first female donor to the [[Human Genome Project]] taken from a blood sample. CAE spliced the genome and inserted it into yeast, which was then placed into host wafers and beer given to audience members who were willing to participate. The genome from the donor is intended to represent a 'New Eve… a sacrosant Messiah'.&lt;ref&gt;Critical Art Ensemble 2000, pp.167-173&lt;/ref&gt; The project also offers public and online preaching, baptisms, communion, sacred theological and cosmological texts and prophecies.&lt;ref&gt;Critical Art Ensemble, 'Performing a Cult', pp.167-173&lt;/ref&gt;

===GenTerra===

CAE created a performance titled ''GenTerra'' which raised issues surrounding ethics and safety in performative science. This was done through an investigation into creating transgenic life forms and seeing the consequences of potentially releasing them into the environment. It was the audience members who had to decide whether the bacteria was harmful or not in a game of 'genetic Russian roulette'.&lt;ref name="triscott3"&gt;Triscott 2009, p.164&lt;/ref&gt; Triscott states through her own experience of participating in the performance that members of the audience were given the opportunity to grow and store their own bacteria, with full instructions and guidance. With the aid of a spinning machine, bacteria were spun with only one of ten chambers holding active bacteria. The purpose of ''GenTerrra'' is to 'introduce bioproducts to the audience, and demonstrate the practical applications of such research, such as disease treatment and xenotransplantation'.&lt;ref name="triscott3"&gt;Triscott 2009, p.164&lt;/ref&gt; As CAE wear lab-coats and appear as professional scientists, they simulate actual biotechnology corporations, emphasizing their intentions even further.&lt;ref&gt;Triscott 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collective structure===
CAE attributes the collective's longevity to their structure which has contributed to positive attitudes throughout the group. The number of members, ranging from three to eight and known as a 'cellular structure'&lt;ref name="critical1"&gt;Critical Art Ensemble 2001, pp.70-73&lt;/ref&gt; has managed to be sustained without members feeling alienated. As each member has the opportunity to show off their individual strengths and weaknesses, the risk of conflict and mistrust is reduced. They do not believe in equality; rather that every member has 'a voice in the production process [of a project]; however the member with the greatest expertise in the area has authority over the final product'.&lt;ref name="critical1"/&gt;

===Amateurism===
CAE has also stated that amateurs have the ability to see through dominant paradigms, are more free to recombine elements of paradigms thought long dead, and can apply everyday life experience to their deliberations. Most important, however, amateurs are not invested in institutional systems of knowledge production and policy construction, and hence do not have irresistible forces guiding the outcome of their process…'.&lt;ref&gt;Sholette 2005, p.52. cited in Critical Art Ensemble 2001, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future projects===

'Since 2006, CAE has changed the focus of its work towards a critique of US defense policy, and has moved away from its interrogation of biotechnology'.&lt;ref&gt;Triscott 2009, p.166&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

===Steve Kurtz's Trial===
In 2004, one of its founders, [[Steve Kurtz]], was arrested on suspicion of [[bioterrorism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/03/arts/design/03kenn.html?_r=2&amp;oref=slogin|title=The Artists in the Hazmat Suits|last=Kennedy|first=Randy|date=July 3, 2005|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2009-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the morning of 11 May 2004, he woke to find that his wife Hope had died in her sleep. He called 911. Police became suspicious after noticing his biology lab which he kept in his own home. They contacted the FBI and Kurtz was detained for 24 hours before being interrogated and his house searched for biohazardous materials. The house was given the all clear, yet a week later, Kurtz's CAE collaborators were ordered to appear before a grand jury to investigate possible violations of the law regarding biological weapons. The jury met in July 2004 and cleared Kurtz of all "bioterrorism" charges, however the FBI continued to press charges against the artist and the case dragged on for four years.&lt;ref&gt;Triscott 2009, p.154.&lt;/ref&gt; The case was widely covered in the US and international press, and sparked outrage among artists and scientists worldwide. A website was created for people to donate money to help Kurtz pay his mounting legal fees. The case was dismissed in 2008. [http://caedefensefund.org -- CAE DEFENSE FUND --] According to Nicola Triscott, the FBI 'thought they had a situation out of which they could manufacture a terrorism case, which potentially brought great personal rewards', based upon the 'Lackawanna Six Sleeper Cell' case where six Yemeni Americans were convicted of supporting al-Qaeda&lt;ref&gt;Triscott 2009, p.165.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
Critical Art Ensemble is the recipient of awards, including the 2007 Andy Warhol Foundation Wynn Kramarsky Freedom of Artistic Expression Grant [http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/wbfo/news.newsmain?action=article&amp;ARTICLE_ID=1200924&amp;sectionID=1 UB Art Professor "Strange Culture" Case Goes to Court | WBFO], the 2004 John Lansdown Award for Multimedia [http://www.inria.fr/presse/pre122.fr.html], and the 2004 Leonardo New Horizons Award for Innovation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8633">The following '''is a list of unproduced [[David Lynch]] projects''' in roughly chronological order. During his long career, American film director [[David Lynch]] has worked on a number of projects which never progressed beyond the pre-production stage under his direction. Some of these projects fell into [[development hell]] or were officially cancelled.

== 1970s ==

=== ''Gardenback'' ===
Before starting work on ''[[Eraserhead]]'', he worked on a script titled ''Gardenback'', based on his painting of a hunched figure with vegetation growing from its back. ''Gardenback'' was a surrealist script about adultery, featuring a continually growing insect that represented one man's lust for his neighbor. He presented the script to the [[American Film Institute|AFI]], but they rejected it as they felt the planned 45-minute runtime was too long for such a figurative, nonlinear script.

=== ''Ronnie Rocket'' ===
{{main article|Ronnie Rocket}}
After the success of ''Eraserhead'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allrovi.com/movies/movie/eraserhead-v15947 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111055138/http://www.allrovi.com/movies/movie/eraserhead-v15947 |archivedate=2012-01-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lynch decided to focus on the screenplay of his second film, entitled ''[[Ronnie Rocket]]'', which he also wanted to direct. The film's plot would have told the story of a detective seeking to enter a mysterious second dimension, aided by his ability to stand on one leg. He is being obstructed on this quest by a strange landscape of odd rooms and a threatening train; while being stalked by the "Donut Men", who wield electricity as a weapon. In addition to the detective's story, the film was to show the tale of Ronald d'Arte, a teenage dwarf, who suffers a surgical mishap which leaves him dependent on being plugged into an electrical supply at regular intervals; this dependence grants him an affinity over electricity which he can use to produce music or cause destruction. The boy names himself Ronnie Rocket and becomes a rock star, befriending a tap-dancer named Electra-Cute. [[Michael J. Anderson]] and [[Dexter Fletcher]] were attached to the lead role at different times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2013/07/david-lynch-says-infamous-never-made-project-ronnie-rocket-is-still-a-possibility-95724/|title=David Lynch Says Infamous Never Made Project ‘Ronnie Rocket’ Is Still A Possibility|first=Kevin|last=Jagernauth|publisher=IndieWire}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the project never materialized due to financial conflicts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/vaporware-no-more-31-lost-projects-were-hoping-to--2543|title=Vaporware no more: 31 lost projects we’re hoping to see in the wake of Chinese Democracy|date=23 November 2008|work=[[The A.V. Club]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; so Lynch left the production and decided to direct ''[[The Elephant Man]]'' instead. Also, Anderson finally worked with Lynch in ''[[Twin Peaks]]''.

== 1980s ==

=== ''Venus Descending'' ===
In 1987, after the success of ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'', Lynch was hired by a [[Warner Bros.]] executive to direct a film based on the life of famous actress [[Marilyn Monroe]], based on the best-selling book ''Goddess''. He co-wrote the script with writer [[Mark Frost]], the first of many collaborations for the two. The film would have revolved around the last few months of life of Monroe (named Rosilyn Ramsay for legal reasons), before her supposed assassination at hands of Bobby Kennedy (renamed Phillip Malloy). However, one of the project's producers decided to drop it, and Lynch decided to focus on ''[[#One Saliva Bubble|One Saliva Bubble]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lynchnet.com/upfilms.html|title=David Lynch - Unproduced Works|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''One Saliva Bubble'' ===
On May 20, 1987, Lynch and Mark Frost finished their script for a film project entitled ''One Saliva Bubble''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lynchnet.com/osbscript.html|title=One Saliva Bubble Screenplay|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's plot centered around the small town of Newtonville, KS, where a secret government project goes amok. The result is an exchange of identities of several of the townsfolk. [[Steve Martin]] was attached to star in the lead role, although [[Martin Short]] was also rumored to take that part. In the chapter 'Marty Throws A Party Just To Sing' of his 2014 autobiography, I Must Say: My Life as a Humble Comedy Legend, Martin Short states, "We bought the house on the basis of the income I was about to make from two pending movies. You can guess what happened next. Practically the second we signed the mortgage, one of the two movies, a David Lynch film with Steve Martin entitled, 'One Saliva Bubble', fell through." &lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books/about/I_Must_Say.html?id=zGuBAwAAQBAJ&lt;/ref&gt; However, the film never came to fruition for unknown reasons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scriptshadow.net/weird-scripts-week-one-saliva-bubble/|title=Weird Scripts Week! - One Saliva Bubble|date=11 June 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; so Lynch left the project to focus on ''[[#Northwest Passage|Northwest Passage]]'' (which would later become ''[[Twin Peaks]]'').

== 1990s ==

=== Untitled ''Twin Peaks'' spin-off ===
During the filming of ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' around the 1990s, Lynch considered at one point to release a spin-off film of the series film ''[[Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me]]'' centered around the character [[Audrey Horne]]. Actress [[Sherilyn Fenn]] was attached to reprise her role. However, the project was not made and the main plot later inspired Lynch's film ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/sherilyn-fenn-talks-david-lynch-and-how-twin-peaks-200898|title=Sherilyn Fenn talks David Lynch and how Twin Peaks should have ended|date=22 January 2014|work=[[The A.V. Club]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me'' sequel ===
Before the release of ''[[Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me]]'', Lynch planned to release a sequel to the film for being a continuation of [[Twin Peaks|the series]] after its cancellation. He also planned a third film. However, these plans were scrapped after the bad reception of ''Fire Walk with Me''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidlynch.de/empire2001.html|title=David Lynch interview Empire November 2001|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Dream of the Bovine'' ===
Around 1994, Lynch and ''Twin Peaks'' writer [[Robert Engels]] co-wrote a script entitled ''Dream of the Bovine''. Engels described the script as being about "three guys, who used to be cows, living in [[Van Nuys]] and trying to assimilate their lives.” [[Harry Dean Stanton]] was attached to star and he and Lynch tried to convince [[Marlon Brando]] to co-star, but Brando was not interested, calling the script "pretentious bullshit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dangerousminds.net/comments/marlon_brando_and_harry_dean_stanton_in_drag_directed_by_david_lynch_it_alm|title=MARLON BRANDO AND HARRY DEAN STANTON IN DRAG, DIRECTED BY DAVID LYNCH: IT ALMOST HAPPENED|publisher=Danergous Minds}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Mulholland Drive'' television series ===
In 1998, Lynch conceived the idea to make a TV series entitled ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)#Development|Mulholland Drive]]''. The project started as a 90-minute pilot produced by [[Touchstone Television]] and intended to be picked by the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network. However, during the filming of the pilot, ABC decided to not pick up the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/may/11/cannes2001.culture|title=Now you see it|first=Andrew|last=Pulver|date=11 May 2001|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Lynch reworked the pilot as a [[Mulholland Drive (film)|feature film]], which was released in 2001.

== 2010s ==

=== ''Antelope Don’t Run No More'' ===
In 2010, Lynch wrote his first film since ''[[Inland Empire (film)|Inland Empire]]'', entitled ''Antelope Don't Run No More''. The film is said to be set in [[Los Angeles]] and features "space aliens, talking animals, and a beleaguered musician named Pinky". Lynch was unable to secure financing for the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thefilmstage.com/news/is-david-lynch-making-a-new-film-with-netflix/|title=Is David Lynch Making a New Film with Netflix?|first=Jordan|last=Raup|date=1 July 2018|work=The Film Stage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Fantasy Bedtime Hour''''' &lt;!--do NOT change it to "was" --&gt;is&lt;!--per [[MOS:TV]]--&gt; [[public-access television]] [[cable TV]] program on [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] channel 29.  It can be described by its tagline, "Two girls in bed ill equipped to handle fantasy novel concepts discuss [[Lord Foul's Bane]]" (the novel by [[Stephen R. Donaldson]]).

Each of the forty episodes in the series consists of Heatherly Stankey and Julie Breithaupt in bed together, reading and discussing the text.  According to a [[San Francisco Chronicle]] reviewer, the women are supposedly, but not actually, nude beneath the covers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/06/23/DDGETDCGPN1.DTL&amp;hw=fantasy+bedtime+hour&amp;sn=001&amp;sc=1000 What's on TV? Oh, the usual sci-fi fantasy, read by women in bed.(Neva Chonin, Chronicle Critic at Large)Thursday, June 23, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; There is a reading with paraphrase, a quick analysis, a reenactment or "fantasy action sequence", and then a discussion with an 'expert' - the experts being individuals who have actually finished and understood the book.  Toward the end of the series, Stephen R. Donaldson himself appeared in some episodes as the "expert". A highlight of the show are the "charts" drawn during the program to illustrate some concept from the reading.

[[Image:Beflockung.jpg|thumb|A [[T-shirt]] printed with a flocking technique (lower half)]]
'''Flocking''' is the process of depositing many small fiber particles (called '''flock''') onto a surface. It can also refer to the texture produced by the process, or to any material used primarily for its flocked surface. Flocking of an article can be performed for the purpose of increasing its value in terms of the tactile sensation, aesthetics, color and appearance. It can also be performed for functional reasons including insulation, slip-or-grip friction, and low reflectivity.

==Uses==
Flocking is used in many ways. One example is in [[model building]], where a [[grass]]y texture may be applied to a surface to make it look more realistic. Similarly, it is used by model car builders to get a scale [[carpet]] effect. Another use is on a [[Christmas tree]], which may be flocked with a fluffy white spray to simulate [[snow]]. Other things may be flocked to give them a [[velour]] texture such as [[t-shirts]], [[wallpaper]], [[Box#Decorative_boxes|gift/jewellery boxes]], or [[upholstery]].
[[File:Rayon flock ESM.png|thumb|Scanning electron microscope image of the end of a flock fiber in bulk sample from a card manufacturing plant]]
Besides the application of velvety coatings to surfaces and objects there exist various flocking techniques as a means of color and product design. They range from screen printing to modern digital printing in order to refine for instance fabric, clothes or books by multicolor patterns. Presently, the exploration of the flock phenomenon can be seen in the fine arts. Artist, Electric Coffin, is known for their many colorful flocked works, including a 50-foot piece in Facebook's Seattle headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cityartsmagazine.com/so-many-likes/|title=So Many Likes - City Arts Magazine|date=2017-03-21|work=City Arts Magazine|access-date=2018-09-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flocking in the automotive industry is used for decorative purposes and may be applied to a number of different materials. Many rally cars also have a flocked dashboard to cut down on the sun reflecting through the windscreen. A view on the present state-of-the-art of flocking can be found in the first international exhibition "Flockage: the flock phenomenon" in the [[Russell-Cotes Art Gallery &amp; Museum]] in [[Bournemouth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://russell-cotes.bournemouth.gov.uk/News/2008/FreeGalleryTalkFlock.asp | title=For the Love of Flock – Flocking Lovely! | publisher=[[Russell-Cotes Art Gallery &amp; Museum]] | work=Free Gallery Talk | date=May 9, 2008 | accessdate=2008-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[photography|photographic]] industry, flocking is one method used to reduce the reflectivity of surfaces, including the insides of some [[Bellows (photography)|bellows]] and [[lens hood]]s. It is also used to produce light-tight passages for [[Photographic film|film]] such as in [[135 film]] cartridges.

Flock consists of synthetic fibers that look like tiny hairs. Flock print feels somewhat velvet and a bit elevated. The length of the fibers can vary in thickness which co-determines the appearance of the flocked product. Thin fibers produce a soft velvety surface, thicker fibers a more bristle-like surface.

High-quality [[model cars]] are known to use flocking for decorative purposes. Premium model maker [[AUTOart]] is well known for its use of flocking in their [[model cars]].

==Process==
[[File:Flocking texture.png|thumb|A diagram of flocking texture. 1 fiber 2 adhesive 3 substrate]]
Flocking is defined as the application of fine particles to adhesive coated surfaces. Nowadays, this is usually done by the application of a high-voltage [[electrostatics|electric field]]. In a flocking machine the "flock" is given a [[Electric charge|negative charge]] whilst the [[Substrate (materials science)|substrate]] is earthed. Flock material flies vertically onto the substrate attaching to previously applied glue. A number of different substrates can be flocked including textiles, fabric, woven fabric, paper, PVC, sponge, toys, and automotive plastic.

The majority of flocking done worldwide uses finely cut [[natural fiber|natural]] or [[synthetic fiber]]s. A flocked finish imparts a decorative and/or functional characteristic to the surface. The variety of materials that are applied to numerous surfaces through different flocking methods create a wide range of end products. The flocking process is used on items ranging from retail consumer goods to products with high technology military applications.

==History==
Historians write that flocking can be traced back to circa 1000 BC, when the [[China|Chinese]] used resin glue to bond natural fibers to fabrics. Fiber dust was strewn onto adhesive coated surfaces to produce flocked wall coverings in [[Germany]] during the [[Middle Ages]]. In France, flocked wall coverings became popular during the reign of [[Louis XIV of France]]. {{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

==Health issues==
{{main|Flock worker's lung}}
Flocking can expose workers to small nylon particulates, which inhaled can cause [[flock worker's lung]], a type of [[interstitial lung disease]]. Other exposure in the flocking industry can include [[acrylic adhesive]]s, ammonium ether of [[potato starch]], [[heat transfer oil]], [[tannic acid]], and [[zeolite]].&lt;ref name=UpToDate&gt;{{cite journal |title = Flock worker's lung |journal =UpToDate |first1 = David J. |last1 = Kern |first2 = Robert S. |last2 = Crausman |date = 19 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Franklin Runyon Sousley''' (September 19, 1925 – March 21, 1945) was a [[United States Marine]] who was killed in action during the  [[Battle of Iwo Jima]] in [[World War II]]. He is best known for being one of the six flag-raisers who helped raise the second [[Flag of the United States|U.S. flag]] atop Mount Suribachi on February 23, 1945 as shown in the iconic photograph ''[[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima]]''.

The [[Marine Corps War Memorial]] located in Arlington, Virginia, which was modeled after the flag-raising photograph, depicts bronze statues of each of the six Marine flag-raisers.

==Early life==
Sousley was born in [[Hill Top, Fleming County, Kentucky|Hill Top, Kentucky]], the second child born to Merle Duke Sousley (1899–1934) and Goldie Mitchell (November 9, 1904 – March 14, 1988). When he was two years old, his five-year-old brother, Malcolm Brooks Sousley (November 24, 1923 – May 30, 1928), died due to [[appendicitis]].  Franklin attended a two-room schoolhouse in nearby Elizaville, and attended Fleming County High School in nearby [[Flemingsburg]] from ninth to twelfth grade. His younger brother Julian was born in May 1933, and his father died due to [[diabetes]] complications a year later, at age 35. At only nine years old, Franklin was the sole male-figure in the family, and assisted his mother in raising Julian. Sousley graduated from Fleming High School in May 1943, and resided in [[Dayton, Ohio]] as a worker in a refrigerator factory.

==World War II==

=== U.S. Marine Corps ===
Sousley received his draft notice, and chose to join the [[United States Marine Corps]] on January 4, 1944. Later, he underwent extensive combat training in California and [[Hawaii]] as a member of the E Company, [[2nd Battalion, 28th Marine Regiment]], [[Fifth Marine Division]].

==== Battle of Iwo Jima ====

===== Flag raising(s) =====
[[File:Iwo Jima Suribachi DN-SD-03-11845.JPEG|thumb|250px|Mount Suribachi on Iwo Jima]]
Sousley landed with his unit at the southeast end of Iwo Jima near Mount Suribachi which was the 2nd Battalion, 28th Marines objective on February 19, 1945, and fought in the battle for the capture of the island. At 8 AM, On February 23, a 40-man patrol (mostly from Third Platoon, Easy Company) led by E Company's executive officer, First Lieutenant [[Harold G. Schrier|Harold Schrier]], was sent up Mount Suribachi to seize and occupy the crest. Schrier who volunteered to lead the patrol, was to raise the battalion's American flag to signal that the mountaintop was captured. The patrol reached the top and the flag was raised by Lt. Schrier, Platoon Sergeant [[Ernest Ivy Thomas, Jr.|Ernest Thomas]], and Sergeant [[Henry Oliver Hansen|Henry Hansen]] approximately 10:30 AM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ruralfloridaliving.blogspot.com/2012/07/famous-floridian-friday-ernest-ivy.html] Rural Florida Living. CBS Radio interview by Dan Pryor with flag raiser Ernest "Boots" Thomas on February 25, 1945 aboard the [[USS Eldorado (AGC-11)]]: "''Three of us actually raised the flag''"&lt;/ref&gt;

Around noon, Marine Sgt. [[Michael Strank]], a squad leader of Second Platoon, Easy Company, was ordered by his company commander to take three Marines from his rifle squad and raise a larger replacement flag on top of Mount Suribachi. Strank chose Cpl. [[Harlon Block]], Pfc. [[Ira Hayes]], and Pfc. Franklin Sousley. On the way up the four Marines laided telephone communication wire (or took supplies up). Pfc. [[Rene Gagnon]], the Second Battalion's runner (messenger) for Easy Company, was ordered by the battalion commander to take the replacement flag up the mountain and return with the first flag.

Once on top, Strank ordered Hayes and Sousley to find a steel pipe to attach the replacement flag unto. After a Japanese iron pipe was found and the flag attached to it, Strank, Block (Block was misidentified as Sgt. Hansen, until January 1947), Hayes, and Sousley assisted by Gagnon and Pfc. [[Harold Schultz]] (on June 23, 2016, the Marine Corps announced that Navy Corpsman [[John Bradley (United States Navy)|John Bradley]] was not in Rosenthal's photo and Schultz was)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marines.mil/News/News-Display/Article/810457/usmc-statement-on-iwo-jima-flagraisers/ USMC Statement on Marine Corps Flag Raisers], Office of U.S. Marine Corps Communication, 23 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt; raised the replacement flag at approximately 1 PM as the first flagstaff was lowered under Lt. Schrier's orders. Strank had called to Gagnon and Schultz to help raise the heavy flagstaff. Once raised, the flagstaff was secured by rocks, and rope tied to it in three places (Bradley assisted some Marines in this) and staked into the ground due to the very high winds on Mount Suribachi.

The second raising was immortalized forever by the black and white photograph of the flag raising by [[Joe Rosenthal]] of the [[Associated Press]]. Marine photographer Sergeant [[Bill Genaust]] also filmed this flag raising in color. In March 1945, Genaust, Thomas and Hansen (first flag-raisers), Strank, Block, and Sousley were killed in action on Iwo Jima.

===== Death =====
[[File:USMC-00932.jpg|thumb|Sousley is fourth from left in "Gung Ho" photo]]
On March 30, 1945, the Marine Corps was ordered by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Roosevelt]] (after he saw Rosenthal's photo in the newspapers and the battle was over on March 26) to send the flag raisers in Rosenthal's photo to [[Washington D.C.]] to participate in a much needed [[war bond]] selling tour.&lt;ref&gt;The Mighty Seventh War Loan: {{cite web |url=http://www.bucknell.edu/x36352.xml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406193329/http://www.bucknell.edu/x36352.xml |archivedate=2013-04-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Strank and Block were killed on March 1 and Sousley on March 21. The book ''[[Flags of Our Fathers]]'' (2000) by [[James Bradley (author)|James Bradley]] (son of Navy corpsman John Bradley who accompanied the 40-man patrol up the mountain), says Sousley was shot in the back by a Japanese [[sniper]] as he was walking down an open road which was a known area of enemy sniper fire, and speculated that he lost his focus or thought the Japanese had stopped firing. According to the book, a fellow Marine saw Sousley lying on the ground and asked, "How bad are you hit?"  Sousley's last words were, "Not bad, I can't feel a thing." He then died of his injuries. However, Rene Gagnon, who knew Sousley personally for several months and saw Sousley the day he was killed, had signed an [[affidavit]] for the Marine Corps reporting that Sousley was killed instantly.

Sousley's body was originally buried at the 5th Marine Division Cemetery on the island of Iwo Jima. A service was held there in the morning of March 26 by the division's surviving Marines which included Ira Hayes and other members of Sousley's company and platoon before they departed Iwo Jima that day. Sousley's remains were reinterred on May 8, 1947, in Elizaville Cemetery in Fleming County, Kentucky.

The '''history of flower arrangement''' dates back to [[ancient Egyptian]] times.

== The Ancient Egyptians ==
The earliest known flower arranging dates back to ancient Egypt.  Egyptians were decorating with flowers as early as 2,500 BCE.  They regularly placed cut flowers in [[vase]]s,&lt;ref name = "Encyclopædia Britannica"&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/210629/floral-decoration, Encyclopædia Britannica,  "Floral decoration," retrieved 15 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  and highly stylized arrangements were used during burials, for processions, and simply as table decorations. Illustrations of arranged flowers have been found on Egyptian carved stone reliefs and painted wall decorations.

Flowers were selected according to symbolic meaning, with emphasis on religious significance.  The [[lotus flower]] or [[Nelumbo|water lily]], for example, was considered sacred to [[Isis]] and was often included in arrangements.  Many other flowers have been found in the tombs of the ancient Egyptians, and [[garlands]] of flowers were worn by loved ones and left at the tombs.&lt;ref name="National Geographic"&gt;http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/06/060629-egypt-flowers.html, John Roach, National Geographic News, "Ancient Flowers Found in Egypt Coffin", 29 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  These included blue [[scilla]], poppy-flowered [[anemone]], ''[[Iris sibirica]]'', [[delphinium]], [[narcissus (plant)|narcissus]], [[palm tree]], [[papyrus]] and [[rose]].&lt;ref name = "Encyclopædia Britannica" /&gt; Egyptian wall paintings depicting roses have been found in tombs dating from the fifth century B.C. to Cleopatra’s time&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.flowermonthclub.com/flower-history|title=History of Flowers - Fresh Flower Facts {{!}} Flower of the Month Club|work=The Fresh Cut Flower of the Month Club|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== The Ancient Greeks and Romans ==
The [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]]&lt;ref name = "Encyclopædia Britannica" /&gt; and the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] also used flowers. The ancient Greeks used flowers and herbs for adornment and decorations included in artwork. They did not often use vases, focusing instead on [[garlands]] and [[wreaths]]. They would place plant material, such as olive branches, in terracotta. The leafy branches were probably used for weddings. They also tossed petals onto floors and beds. Like the Egyptians, the Greeks and Romans had preferences for the flowers and foliage they used.

The most popular foliage used by the Greeks and the Romans were [[acorn]]s, [[oak]] leaves, [[Bay Laurel|laurel]], [[ivy]], [[bay]]{{clarify|date=August 2018}} and [[parsley]]. [[Laurel wreath]]s were presented to winners of athletic competitions in the ancient [[Olympics]]; these wreaths were also awarded to individuals winning competition in poetic meets, while in Rome they symbolized a military victory and crowned the successful commander in honor of his triumph. The garland wreath was a symbol to the Greeks of power, honor, allegiance, dedication; it was awarded in honor of athletes, poets, civic leaders, soldier, and heroes.

The preferred flowers include roses, [[hyacinths]], [[honeysuckle]], [[Violet (plant)|violets]], and [[lilies]].  Other flowers such as [[tulips]], [[Consolida|larkspur]], and [[Tagetes|marigold]]s were also selected for their shape, color, and form.

Wealth and power led the Romans and Greeks to the greater luxury in the use of flowers which, like the Egyptian, were used in religious rites. At banquets, roses were strewn on the floor to a depth of one foot, and the flowers "rained" from the ceiling. The fragrance of so many roses was almost suffocating. The Romans used the roses at many meals and because of its overwhelming fragrance it{{vague|date=February 2014}} was known as the "Hour of Rose". 

== Ancient China ==
The Chinese were making flower arrangements as far back as 207 BCE to 220 CE, in the [[Han Dynasty|Han era of ancient China]].  Flowers were an integral component of religious teaching and medicine.

Practitioners of [[Buddhist|Buddhism]], [[Taoist|Taoism]], and [[Confucian]]ism placed cut flowers on their altars, a practice which dates back to 618-906 CE.  They created paintings, carvings, and embroidered items with depictions of flowers.  The paintings can be found on vases, plates, scrolls, and silk, while carvings were done on wood, bronze, jade and ivory.

Buddhist teachings forbade the taking of a life, so religious practitioners worked sparingly when taking cuttings from plants.  Flowers and leaves that were used to make basket arrangements were selected based on their symbolic meaning.  For example, the [[bamboo]], the [[peach]] tree, and the [[pear]] tree symbolized [[longevity]].  The [[wikt:tiger lily|tiger lily]], the [[pomegranate]], and the [[orchid]] symbolized [[fertility]].  The most honored of all flowers was the [[peony]].  Considered the “king of flowers”, it symbolized wealth, good fortune, and high status.

During the period 500CE to 1453CE, the [[Byzantine Empire]] made its contribution to floral arrangements, which typically included a cone shape design.  The foliage was placed in [[chalice]]s and [[urn]]s, which were further decorated with brightly colored flowers and fruit.  Flowers commonly included in these arrangements were [[Bellis perennis|daisies]], lilies, [[cypress]], [[carnations]], and [[pine]].  Ribbons were also commonly used, and leaves and tiny flowers were set in arching lines to give an twisted effect to garlands.

== Flower arranging reaches Europe ==
Flower arranging arrived in [[Europe]] around 1000 CE, and was particularly popular in churches and monasteries where flowers and plants were used for food as well as for decoration.  As [[crusade]]rs came back from the [[Middle East]], they brought with them new and interesting plants.  As a result, European countries began experimenting with plants that were previously unknown to them.

'''MIDDLE AGES (''AD 476–1400'')'''

During this era, monks were known for having gardens with herbs and wildflowers. In the later part of the Gothic period flowers reached a more dominant role, such as flowers beginning to blossom in altar pictures, manuscripts, and paintings.

An important aspect of the monastery plan was to include a medicinal herb garden, which would “furnish the physician with the pharmaceutical products needed for his cures. A dependence on the power of herbs without reference to their Creator [God] was, however, regarded as improper for a Christian” [12]. Because God “causes herbs to grow,” their medical utility is fundamentally spiritual [13]. In addition, many plants were used by monks and Christians in general in sacred rituals and ceremonies. They often had associations appealing to spiritual bases as well as to medicinal effects.

'''RENAISSANCE(''AD 1400–1600'')'''

The flower design started in Italy and grew through Europe. Paintings of impressive floral arrangements in vases were popular. In the paintings, fruit blossoms and leaves were woven into garlands to decorate walls and vaulted ceilings, and petals were piled into baskets or strewn on the floors, streets, or allowed to float down from balconies.

'''BAROQUE ARRANGEMENTS (''AD 1600–1775'')'''

At the beginning of this period floral designs were symmetrical and oval-shaped, with asymmetric crescents and S-shapes becoming popular later on.{{when|date=February 2014}}

'''DUTCH'''–'''FLEMISH ARRANGEMENTS (''AD 1600–1750'')'''

The baroque arrangements in the Dutch-Flemish style were more compact and proportioned. Their major characteristic was the variety of flowers within the bouquet.

'''FRENCH ARRANGEMENTS (''AD 1600–1814'')'''

During the French Baroque period, a soft, almost fragile appeal became a major characteristic of floral design. Arrangements were asymmetrical using the C-crescent or the S-shape. In the empire period they used simple lines in triangle shapes and strong color contrast. The typical empire design would be arranged in an urn containing an abundance of large richly colored flowers.

'''GEORGIAN ARRANGEMENTS (''AD 1714–1760'')'''

The designs in this period were formal and symmetrical and often tightly arranged with a variety of flowers. Oriental design became influential due to active trading. At the end of the period the designs became more informal due to the fact that the fragrance of the flowers, which were believed to rid the air of diseases, became more important. Small, handheld arrangements called [[nosegays]] or tussie-mussies were used to carry sweet scents, and also helped mask the odors of society where bathing was often believed to be unhealthy.

'''VICTORIAN ARRANGEMENTS (''AD 1820–1901'')'''

Flowers were considered fashionable in this period. Large mass flowers were placed tightly into containers to create compact arrangements that were asymmetrical and stacked tightly. There was no definite style, but many different flowers and colours  made the arrangement look almost unplanned. The tussie-mussie bouquets were still serving to eliminate odors. At the end of this period attempts were made to set up rules for a proper arranging of flowers, which is when it became an artful skill or profession in Europe.

The [[Italian Renaissance]] helped to give an extra spark to the art of flower arranging in Europe. It was during this time period that a wide variety of arrangement styles began to develop. By the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, flower arrangements were commonplace and a wide variety of materials were used to make containers, including [[marble]], heavy [[Venetian glass]], and [[bronze]].

Flower arrangements made during this time introduced a whole new element&amp;nbsp;– the usage of tropical fruits. These arrangements also focused on creating colour contrast. Some of the popular flowers included the Lilium Candidum (or Madonna Lily, used as a symbol for fertility and chastity), narcissus, pinks, iris, [[jasmine]], [[pansies]], French marigolds, [[cornflowers]], and [[rosemary]].

'''''Intellectuals and Society''''' is a non-fiction book by [[Thomas Sowell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The National Review]]|authorlink=Thomas Sowell|first=Thomas|last=Sowell|date=July 17, 2012|title=Why Aren’t Race Riots News?|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/309578/why-aren-t-race-riots-news-thomas-sowell}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.org/publications/tir/article.asp?a=812 The Independent Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; The book was initially published on January 5, 2010 by [[Basic Books]].

[[Intellectual]]s are defined as "idea workers" that exercise profound influence on policy makers and public opinion, but are often not directly accountable for the results. ''Intellectuals and Society'' examines the record of these idea workers and the conditions, methods and incentives driving their points of view that, according to Sowell, have often resulted in disaster for societies where intellectuals have been allowed "undue influence". 

==Undue influence of intellectuals==
Sowell explained undue influence of intellectuals as follows:

:"Those whose careers are built on the creation and dissemination of ideas — the intellectuals — have played a role in many societies out of all proportion to their numbers. Whether that role has, on balance, made those around them better off or worse off is one of the key questions of our times.

:The quick answer is that intellectuals have done both. But certainly, during the 20th century, it is hard to escape the conclusion that intellectuals have on balance made the world a worse and more dangerous place. Scarcely a mass-murdering dictator of the 20th century was without his supporters, admirers, or apologists among the leading intellectuals — not only within his own country, but in foreign democracies, where intellectuals were free to say whatever they wanted.

:...intellectuals are people whose end products are intangible ideas, and they are usually judged by whether those ideas sound good to other intellectuals or resonate with the public. Whether their ideas turn out to work — whether they make life better or worse for others — is another question entirely."&lt;ref&gt;Sowell, T. "Intellectuals and Society" (January 5, 2010), National Review Online. Retrieved June 14, 2009 [http://article.nationalreview.com/419693/intellectuals-and-society/thomas-sowell The National Review]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
Sowell argues that intellectuals, whom he defines as people whose occupations deal primarily with ideas (writers, historians, academics, etc.), usually consider themselves as "anointed", or as endowed with superior intellect or insight with which to guide the masses and those who have authority over them. Sowell contends that several characteristics mark such intellectuals.&lt;ref&gt;Sowell, Intellectuals... pp. 4–116; 281–319&lt;/ref&gt;

===Working with ideas===
An intellectual’s{{clarify|date=March 2016}} work begins and ends with ideas, not the practical application of ideas to real world problems. These purveyors of ideas may be at all points of the political and ideological spectrum, although Sowell generally reserves his sharpest criticisms for those on the left. Certain common patterns in intellectuals, he argues, cut across specific political ideologies. Intellectuals, for example, show a marked preference for third parties,{{clarify|date=March 2016}} working outside the established power structures and applying what is presumed to be superior insight, to control the resources and decision making processes of the masses and their official leaders. This preference sometimes makes outwardly competing ideologies appear more alike than different. For example both [[National Socialism]] and [[Stalinism]] attempted to [[micro-manage]] the lives of their citizens; both implemented sweeping [[propaganda]] campaigns to [[Reframing|reframe]] reality, and both resulted in leadership by an elite outside group. This, apparently, despite the fact that both movements were notoriously anti-intellectual.&lt;ref&gt;Sowell, Intellectuals… pp. 75–157&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lack of real accountability===
The work of intellectuals is ultimately not subject to external (real world) verifiability, as compared to those engaged in more practical pursuits with readily observable results. An intellectual, for example, can condemn a military operation for "excessive force" but has no accountability in regards to the actual outcome of that operation. By contrast, a military commander who fails to deploy sufficient force at the appropriate time can pay with his own life and that of his men. The acclaim given to intellectuals, despite their predictions having failed, is a prime example of the lack of ultimate accountability, Sowell maintains.&lt;ref&gt;Sowell, Intellectuals… p. 4–31&lt;/ref&gt;

===Narrow and specialized knowledge===
Intellectuals usually have thorough knowledge in their areas of expertise. Outside these fields, however, they may be as uninformed as the average person. Too often, Sowell argues, this does not stop them from attempting to influence public opinion in areas where they are not fully qualified. Sowell lists several examples that he argues support his thesis.&lt;ref&gt;Sowell, Intellectuals… p. 13-50&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intellectual climate of distortion and misinformation===
Sowell states that intellectuals often assume that their specialized knowledge qualifies them to guide others, as do experts in any field of endeavor, practical or otherwise. Sowell argues that what is crucial is their influence on the people who wield decision making power. The presumption of insight often creates a climate that influences the way events are reported by the media, and may make politicians hesitant to take certain approaches to problem-solving. Before World War II, for example, British intellectuals played a large role in the process of creating the opposition to re-armament, which proved to be a deadly mistake.&lt;ref&gt;Sowell, Intellectuals… pp. 203–281&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verbal virtuosity (rhetoric) versus evidence or logic===
Sowell suggests that intellectuals rely heavily on what he calls "verbal virtuosity" (clever phrasing, vague [[euphemism]]s, witty quotes, deceptive labeling, name-calling and sneering asides) to substitute for evidence, logic and analysis. Other tactics of "verbal virtuosity" include dismissing opposing ideas as simplistic, portraying those making opposing arguments as morally unworthy, invoking "rights" which have no legal basis, vague calls for "change", reliance on the abstract versus the concrete, and a constant "filtering of reality".&lt;ref&gt;Sowell, Intellectuals… pp. 10–241&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ego-involvement and personalization===
The presumption of wisdom and/or virtue causes intellectuals{{clarify|date=March 2016}} to personalize situations where contending ideas are involved. This often results in: (a) the demonization of opponents, and (b) personal fulfillment serving as a substitute for debate and evidence. Sowell does not make it clear if intellectuals acquired these traits from politicians, or the other way around.&lt;ref&gt;Sowell, Intellectuals… pp. 75–157&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Israeli sculpture''' designates [[sculpture]] produced in the [[Land of Israel]] from 1906, the year the "[[Bezalel Academy of Art and Design|Bezalel School of Arts and Crafts]]" (today called the Bezalel Academy of Art and Design) was established. The process of crystallization of Israeli sculpture was influenced at every stage by international sculpture. In the early period of Israeli sculpture, most of its important sculptors were immigrants to the Land of Israel, and their art was a [[wikt:synthesis|synthesis]] of the influence of European sculpture with the way in which the national artistic identity developed in the Land of Israel and later in the State of [[Israel]].

Efforts toward the development of a local style of sculpture began in the late 1930s, with the creation of "[[Canaanism|Caananite]]" sculpture, which combined influences from European sculpture with motifs taken from the East, and particularly from [[Mesopotamia]]. These motifs were formulated in national terms and strived to present the relationship between Zionism and the soil of the homeland. In spite of the aspirations of abstract sculpture, which blossomed in Israel in the middle of the 20th century under the influence of the "New Horizons" movement and attempted to present sculpture that spoke a universal language, their art included many elements of earlier "Caananite" sculpture. In the 1970s, many new elements found their way into Israeli art and sculpture, under the influence of international [[conceptual art]]. These techniques significantly changed the definition of sculpture. In addition, these techniques facilitated the expression of political and social protest, which up to this time had been downplayed in Israeli sculpture.

==History==
[[File:Bezalel Sculpture Class, 1914.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Bezalel sculpture class, 1914]]
An attempt to find indigenous 19th-century Israeli sources for the development of "Israeli" sculpture is problematic from two points of view.  First, both the artists and Jewish society in the Land of Israel were lacking the national Zionist motifs which would accompany the development of Israeli sculpture in the future.  This applies, of course, also to non-Jewish artists of the same period.  Second, art history research has failed to find a tradition of sculpture either among the Jewish communities of the Land of Israel or among the Arab or Christian residents of that period.  In research conducted by Yitzhak Einhorn, Haviva Peled, and Yona Fischer, artistic traditions of this period were identified, which include ornamental art of a religious (Jewish and Christian) nature, which was created for pilgrims and, therefore, for both export and local needs.  These objects included decorated tablets, embossed soaps, seals, etc. with motifs borrowed for the most part from the tradition of graphic art.&lt;ref&gt;See, Yona Fischer  (Ed.),  Art and Art in the Land of Israel in the Nineteenth Century (Jerusalem, The Israel Museum, 1979).  [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his article "Sources of Israeli Sculpture"&lt;ref&gt;Gideon Ofrat, Sources of the Land of Israel Sculpture, 1906-1939 (Herzliya: Herzliya Museum, 1990).  [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gideon Ofrat]] identified the beginning of Israeli sculpture as the founding of the Bezalel School in 1906. At the same time, he identified a problem in trying to present a unified picture of that sculpture. The reasons were the variety of European influences on Israeli sculpture, and the relatively small number of sculptors in Israel, most of whom had worked for long periods in Europe.

At the same time, even at the Bezalel – a school of art founded by a sculptor – sculpture was considered a lesser art, and the studies there concentrated on the art of painting and the crafts of graphic and design.  Even in the "New Bezalel", founded in 1935, Sculpture did not occupy a significant place. While it is true that a department of sculpture was set up in the new school, it closed a year later, because it was viewed as a tool to help students learn three-dimensional design and not as an independent department. In its place a department of pottery&lt;ref&gt;See, Gideon Efrat, The New Bezalel, 1935-1955 (Jerusalem: Bezalel Academy of Art and Design, 1987)  pp. 128-130.  [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; opened and flourished. There were exhibitions by individual sculptors during these years both in the Bezalel Museum and in the Tel Aviv Museum, but these were exceptions and were not indicative of the general attitude toward three-dimensional art. An ambiguous attitude toward sculpture by the artistic establishment could be felt, in various incarnations, well into the 1960s.

===Early sculpture in the Land of Israel===

The beginning of sculpture in the Land of Israel, and of Israeli art in general, is usually designated as 1906, the year of the founding of the Bezalel School of Arts and Crafts in Jerusalem by [[Boris Schatz]]. Schatz, who studied sculpture in Paris with [[Mark Antokolski]], was already a well-known sculptor when he arrived in Jerusalem.  He specialized in relief portraiture of Jewish subjects in an academic style.

Schatz's work attempted to establish a new Jewish-Zionist identity He expressed this by using figures from the Bible within a framework derived from European Christian culture. His work "Matthew the Hasmoneum" (1894), for example, depicted the Jewish national hero [[Mattathias|Mattathias ben Johanan]] grasping a sword and with his foot on the body of a Greek soldier. This kind of representation is connected to the ideological theme of "The Victory of Good Over Evil", as expressed, for example, in the figure of Perseus in a sculpture from the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;See, Alec Mishory, Behold, Gaze, and See (Tel Aviv: Am Oved, 2000) pp. 53–55. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; Even a series of memorial plaques Schatz created for the leaders of the Jewish settlement is derived from Classical art, combined with the descriptive tradition in the spirit of the Ars Novo tradition. The influence of Classical and [[Renaissance art]] on Schatz can be seen even in the copies of sculptures he ordered for Bezalel, which he displayed in the Bezalel Museum as examples of ideal sculpture for the students in the school. These sculptures include "[[David (Verrocchio)|David]]" (1473–1475) and "Putto with a Dolphin" (1470) by [[Andrea del Verrocchio]].&lt;ref&gt;] See, Alec Mishory, Behold, Gaze, and See (Tel Aviv: Am Oved, 2000) p. 51. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

The studies at Bezalel tended to favor painting, drawing, and design, and as a result the amount of three-dimensional sculpture turned out there was limited. Among the few workshops which opened at the school was one in [[woodcarving]], in which reliefs of various Zionist and Jewish leaders were produced, along with workshops in decorative design in applied art using techniques such as hammering copper into thin sheets, setting gems, etc. In 1912 a department for [[ivory]] design, which also emphasized the applied arts, was opened.&lt;ref&gt;Nurit Shilo-Cohen, Schatz’s Bezalel  (Jerusalem, The Israel Museum, 1983) pp. 55–68.  [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of its activities workshops were added that functioned nearly autonomously. In a memo issued in June 1924, Schatz outlined all of the major fields of activity of Bezalel, among them stone sculpture, which was founded primarily by students of the school within the framework of the "Jewish Legion" and the workshop on woodcarving.&lt;ref&gt;] Nurit Shilo-Cohen, Schatz’s Bezalel  (Jerusalem, The Israel Museum, 1983) p.98.  [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides Schatz, there were several other artists in Jerusalem in the early days of Bezalel who were working in the field of sculpture. In 1912 [[Ze'ev Raban]] immigrated to the Land of Israel at Schatz's invitation and served as an instructor in sculpture, sheet copper work, and anatomy at Bezalel. Raban had trained in sculpture at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich, and later at the [[Ecole des Beaux-Arts]] in [[Paris]] and the [[Royal Academy of Fine Arts (Antwerp)|Royal Academy of Fine Arts]] in [[Antwerp]], Belgium. In addition to his well-known graphic work, Raban created figurative sculptures and reliefs in the academic "Oriental" style, such as the terracotta figurine of the Biblical figures "Eli and Samuel" (1914), who are depicted as Yemenite Jews.  However Raban's most important work focused on embossments for jewelry and other decorative items.&lt;ref&gt;About the jewelry design of Raban, see Yael Gilat, “The Ben Shemen Jewelers’ Community, Pioneer in the Work-at-Home Industry: From the Resurrection of the Spirit of the Botega to the Resurrection of the Guilds,” in Art and Crafts, Linkages, and Borders, edited by Nurit Canaan Kedar, (Tel Aviv: The Yolanda and David Katz Art Faculty, Tel Aviv University, 2003), 127–144. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other instructors at Bezalel also created sculptures in the realistic academic style. [[Eliezer Strich]], for instance, created busts of people in the Jewish settlement. Another artist, [[Yitzhak Sirkin]] carved portraits in wood and in stone.

The main contribution to Israel sculpture of this period can be contributed to Abraham Melnikoff, who worked outside the framework of Bezalel. Melnikoff created his first work in Israel in 1919, after he arrived in the Land of Israel during his service in the "[[Jewish Legion]]". Until the 1930s, Melnikoff produced a series of sculptures in various kinds of stone, mostly portraiture done in [[terracotta]] and stylized images carved out of stone. Among his significant works is a group of symbolic sculptures depicting the awakening of the Jewish identity, such as "The Awakening Judah" (1925), or memorial monuments to [[Ahad Ha'am]] (1928) and to [[Max Nordau]] (1928). In addition, Melnikoff presided over presentations of his works in exhibits of Artists of the Land of Israel in the [[Tower of David]].

The "Roaring Lion" monument (1928–1932) is a continuation of this trend, but this sculpture is different in the way it was perceived by the Jewish public of that period.  Melnikoff himself initiated the building of the monument, and funding for the project was attained jointly by the Histadrut ha-Clalit, the Jewish National Council, and [[Alfred Mond]] (Lord Melchett). The image of the monumental [[lion]], sculpted in granite, was influenced by primitive art combined with Mesopotamian art of the 7th and 8th centuries A.D.&lt;ref&gt;Haim Gamzo compared the sculpture to the image of the Assyrian lion from Khorsabad, found in the collection of the Louvre.  See Haim Gamzo, The Art of Sculpture in Israel (Tel Aviv: Mikhlol Publishing House Ltd., 1946) (without page numbers). [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; The style is expressed primarily in the anatomical design of the figure.

[[File:Zaid1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Alexander Zaïd monument by [[David Polus]]]]
[[File:Zeev ben-zvi-meskin.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Aharon Meskin]] by [[Zeev Ben-Zvi]]]]
The sculptors who started to produce works at the end of the 1920s and the beginning of the 1930s in the Land of Israel demonstrated a wide variety of influences and styles. Among them were a few who went by the teachings of the Bezalel School, while others, who arrived after studying in Europe, brought with them the influence of early French Modernism on art, or the influence of Expressionism, especially in its German form.

Among the sculptors who were Bezalel students, the works of [[Aaron Priver]] stand out. Priver arrived in the Land of Israel in 1926 and began to study sculpture with Melnikoff. His work displayed a combination of a tendency toward realism and an archaic or moderately primitive style. His feminine figures of the 1930s are designed with rounded lines and sketchy facial features. Another pupil, [[Nachum Gutman]], better known for his paintings and drawings, traveled to [[Vienna]] in 1920, and later went to [[Berlin]] and [[Paris]], where he studied sculpture and printmaking and produced sculptures on a small scale which show traces of expressionism and a tendency toward a "primitive" style in the depiction of its subjects.

The works of [[David Ozeransky]] (Agam) continued the decorative tradition of [[Ze'ev Raban]].  Ozeransky even worked as a laborer on the sculptural decorations Raban created for the YMCA building in Jerusalem. Ozeransky's most important work of this period is "Ten Tribes" (1932) – a group of ten square decorative tablets, which describe in symbolic terms the ten cultures associated with the history of the Land of Israel. Another work that Ozeranzky was involved in creating during this period was "The Lion" (1935) that stands atop the Generali Building in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;see: Yael Gilat, Artists Write the Myth Again: Alexander Zaid’s Memorial and the Works That Followed in its Footsteps, Oranim Academic College Website [In Hebrew]    &lt;http://info.oranim.ac.il/home/home.exe/16737/23928?load=T.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he was never a student at the institution, the work of [[David Polus]] was anchored in the Jewish academism which Schatz formulated at Bezalel. Polus began to sculpt after he was a stonemason in the labor corps. His first significant work was a statue of "David the Shepherd" (1936–1938) in [[Ramat David]]. In his monumental work 1940 "[[Alexander Zeid|Alexander Zeid Memorial]]", which was cast in concrete at "Sheik Abreik" and stands near the [[Beit She'arim]] National Park, Polus represents the man known as "The Watchman"  as a horseman looking out over the view of the Jezreel Valley. In 1940 Polus placed at the base of the monument two tablets, in archaic-symbolic style, whose subjects were "the thicket" and "the shepherd."&lt;ref&gt;Yael Gilat, Artists Write the Myth Again: Alexander Zaid’s Memorial and the Works That Followed in its Footsteps, Oranim Academic College Website [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;  While the style of the main statue  is realistic, it became known for its attempt to glorify its subject and emphasize his connection with the land.

In 1910 the sculptress [[Chana Orloff]] emigrated from the Land of Israel to France and began studies in the [[École Nationale des Arts Décoratifs]]. Her work, beginning with the period of her studies, emphasizes her connection to French art of the time. Particularly evident is the influence of Cubist sculpture, which moderated in her work with the passage of time. Her sculptures, mostly human images carved in stone and wood, designed as geometric spaces and flowing lines. A significant portion of her work is devoted to sculptural portraits of figures from French society.&lt;ref&gt;See Haim Gamzo, Chana Orloff (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 1968). [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; Her connection with the Land of Israel, Orloff preserved through an exhibition of her works in the Tel Aviv Museum.&lt;ref&gt;] Her museum exhibitions during those years took place in the Tel Aviv Museum of Art in 1935, and in the Tel Aviv Museum of Art and the Haifa Museum of Art in 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another sculptor who was greatly influenced by Cubism is Zeev Ben Zvi.  In 1928, after his studies in Bezalel, Ben Zvi went to study in Paris.  Upon his return, he served for short periods as an instructor in sculpture at Bezalel and at the "New Bezalel."  In 1932 his first exhibition was held at the Bezalel national antiquities museum, and a year later he mounted an exhibition of his works at the Tel Aviv Museum.  His sculpture "The Pioneer" was displayed at the Orient Fair in Tel Aviv in 1934.  In Ben Zvi's work, as in Orloff's, the language of the Cubists, the language in which he designed his sculptures, did not abandon realism and stayed within the boundaries of traditional sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;Haim Gamzo, The Sculptor Ben-Zvi (Tel Aviv: HaZvi Publications, 1955). [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of French realism can also be seen in the group of Israeli artists who were influenced by the realistic trend of early twentieth-century French sculptors like [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Aristide Maillol]], etc. The symbolic baggage of both their content and their style showed up as well in the work of Israeli artists, such as [[Moses Sternschuss]], [[Raphael Chamizer]], [[Moshe Ziffer]], [[Joseph Constant]] (Constantinovsky), and [[Dov Feigin]], most of whom studied sculpture in France.

One of this group of artists – Batya Lishanski – studied painting in Bezalel, and took courses in sculpture in the Parisian [[École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts]]. When she returned to Israel, she created figurative and expressive sculpture, which showed the clear influence of Rodin, who emphasized the corporeality of his sculptures. The series of monuments that Lishanski created, the first of which was "Labor and Defense" (1929),  which was built over the grave of [[Ephraim Chisik]] - who died in the battle for the Hulda Farm (today, Kibbutz [[Hulda, Israel|Hulda]]) - as a reflection of the Zionist utopia during that period: a combination of the redemption of the land and the defense of the homeland.

The influence of German art and particularly of German expressionism can be seen in the group of artists who arrived in the Land of Israel after receiving their training in art in various German cities and in Vienna.  Artists such as [[Jacob Brandenburg]], [[Trude Chaim]], and [[Lili Gompretz-Beatus]], and George Leshnitzer produced figurative sculpture, primarily portraiture, designed in a style that wavered between impressionism and moderate  expressionism.  Among the artists of that group [[Rudi Lehmann|Rudolf (Rudi) Lehmann]], who started teaching art in a studio he opened in the 1930s, stands out.  Lehmann had studied sculpture and wood carving with a German named L. Feurdermeier, who specialized in animal sculptures. The figures that Lehmann created  showed the influence of expressionism  in the gross design of the body, which emphasized the material from which the sculpture was made and the way the sculptor worked on it. In spite of the overall appreciation of his work, Lehmann's primary importance was as a teacher of the methods of classical sculpture, in stone and wood, to a large number of Israeli artists.

===Caananite to abstract, 1939–1967===

At the end of the 1930s, a group called "[[Canaanism|The Caananites]]" – a broad sculptural movement, primarily literary in nature – was founded in Israel. This group tried to create a direct line between the early peoples living in the Land of Israel, in the second millennium before the Christian Era, and the Jewish people in the Land of Israel in the 20th century, at the same time striving toward the creation of a new-old culture which would separate itself from Jewish tradition. The artist most closely associated with this movement was the sculptor [[Itzhak Danziger]], who returned to the Land of Israel in 1938 after studying art in [[England]]. The new nationalism that Danziger's "Caananite" art suggested, a nationalism that was anti-European and full of Eastern sensuality and exoticism, reflected the attitude of many of the people living in the Jewish community in the Land of Israel. "The dream of Danziger's generation", [[Amos Keinan]] wrote after Danziger's death, was "to merge with the Land of Israel and with the land, to create a specific image with recognizable signs, something that is from here and is us, and imprint the stamp of that something special that is us on history.&lt;ref&gt;Amos Kenan, “Greater Israel,” Yedioth Ahronoth, 19 August 1977. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from nationalism, the artists created sculpture which expressed a symbolic expressionism in the spirit of British sculpture of the same period.

In Tel Aviv Danziger  founded a sculpture studio in the courtyard of his father's hospital, and there he critiqued and taught young sculptors such as [[Benjamin Tammuz]], [[Kosso Eloul]], [[Yehiel Shemi]], [[Mordechai Gumpel]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;] The Story of Israeli Art, Benjamin Tammuz, Editor (Jerusalem: Masada Publishing House, 1980), p. 134. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to Danziger's pupils, the studio became a gathering place for artists in other fields.  In this studio Danziger created his first significant works – "Nimrod" (1939) and "Shebaziya" (1939).

From the moment it was first displayed, the statue "Nimrod" became the center of a dispute in the culture of Eretz Israel; in this sculpture Danziger presented the figure of [[Nimrod]], the biblical hunter, as a lean youth, naked and uncircumcised, with a sword to pressed close to his body, and a falcon on his shoulder. The form of the statue was reminiscent of the primitive art of the Assyrian, Egyptian, and Greek cultures, and similar in spirit to European sculpture of this period. In its form the statue displayed a unique combination of [[homoerotic]] beauty and pagan idol worship. This combination was at the center of the criticism of the religious community in the Jewish settlement. At the same time other voices declared it the model for the 'new Jewish man'. In 1942 an article appeared in the newspaper "HaBoker" declaring that "Nimrod is not just a sculpture, it is the flesh of our flesh, the spirit of our spirit. It is a milestone and a monument. It is the epitome of ingenuity and daring, of monumentality, of the youthful rebellion that characterizes an entire generation...Nimrod will be forever young."&lt;ref&gt;Cited in: Sara Breitberg Semel, “Agripas vs. Nimrod,” Kav, No. 9 (1999). [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first showing of the sculpture in the "General Exhibition of the Young People of Eretz Israel", in [[Habima Theatre]] in May, 1942&lt;ref&gt;] This exhibition is dated according to Gamzo’s critique, which was published on May 2, 1944.&lt;/ref&gt; engendered the persistent argument over the "Caananite"  movement. Because of the exhibition, [[Yonatan Ratosh]], founder of the movement, got in touch with him and requested a meeting with him.  The criticism against "Nimrod" and the Caananites was coming not just from religious elements who, as mentioned above, protested against this representative of the pagan and the idolatrous, but also from secular critics who condemned the removal of everything "Jewish". To a large extent, "Nimrod" ended up in the middle of a dispute that had been started long before.

In spite of the fact that Danziger later expressed doubts about "Nimrod" as a model for Israeli culture, many other artists adopted the Caananite approach to sculpture. Images of idols and figures in the "primitive" style showed up in Israeli art until the 1970s. In addition, the influence of this group can be seen to a significant degree in the work of the "New Horizons" group, most of whose members experimented with the Caananite style early in their artistic careers.

==="New Horizons" group===

In 1948, a movement called "[[New Horizons]]" ("Ofakim Hadasim") was founded. It identified with the values of European modernism, and particularly with abstract art. [[Kosso Eloul]], [[Moshe Sternschuss]], and [[Dov Feigin]] were appointed to the group of founders of the movement, and were later joined by other sculptors. The Israeli sculptors were perceived as a minority not only because of the small number of them in the movement, but primarily because of the dominance of the medium of painting in the view of the leaders of the movement, especially [[Joseph Zaritsky]]. In spite of the fact that most of the sculptures of members of the group were not "pure" abstract sculpture, they included elements of abstract art and metaphysical symbolism.  Non-abstract art was perceived as old-fashioned and irrelevant. Sternschuss, for example, described the pressure that was put upon members of the group not to include figurative  elements in their art. It was a long struggle that began in 1959, the year that was considered by members of the group as the year of "the victory of abstraction"&lt;ref&gt;Yona Fischer and Tamar Manor-Friedman, The Birth of Now (Ashdod: Ashdod Museum of Art, 2008), p. 10.  [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; and reached its peak in the mid-1960s. Sternschuss even told a story about an incident in which one of the artists wanted to display a sculpture that was considerably more avante-garde than what was generally accepted.  But it had a head, and because of this, one of the members of the board testified against him on this issue.&lt;ref&gt;On the subject of kibbutz pressure, see Gila Blass, New Horizons (Tel Aviv: Papyrus and Reshefim Publishers, 1980), pp. 59–60. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gideon Ophrat, in his essay on the group, found a strong connection between the painting and sculpture of "New Horizons" and the art of the "Caananites."&lt;ref&gt;See Gideon Ophrat, “The Secret Canaanism in ‘New Horizons’,” Art Visits [Bikurei omanut], 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of the "international" hue of the artistic forms that the members of the group exhibited, many of their works showed a mythological depiction of the Israeli landscape. In December 1962, for example, Kosso Eloul organized an international symposium on sculpture in [[Mitzpe Ramon]]. This event  served as an example of the growing interest of the sculptures in the Israeli landscape, and in particular in the desolate desert landscape. The landscape was perceived, on the one hand, as the basis for the thought processes for creating many monuments and memorial sculptures. [[Yona Fisher]] speculated, in his research on art in the 1960s, that the interest of sculptors in the "magic of the desert" arose not just from a romantic yearning for nature, but also from an attempt to inculcate in Israel an environment of "Culture" rather than "Civilization".&lt;ref&gt;] Yona Fischer and Tamar Manor-Friedman, The Birth of Now  (Ashdod: Ashdod Museum of Art, 2008), pp. 30–31.  [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

The test with regard to the works of each member of the group lay in the different way he dealt with abstraction and with landscape.  The crystallization of the abstract nature of Dov Feigin's sculpture, was part of a process of an artistic search that was influenced by international sculpture, particularly that of [[Julio González (sculptor)|Julio González]], [[Constantin Brâncuși]], and [[Alexander Calder]]. The most important artistic change took place in 1956, when Feigin changed over to metal (iron) sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;See: L. Orgad, Dov Feigin (Tel Aviv: The Kibbutz  HaMeuhad [The United Kibbutz], 1988), pp. 17–19. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; His works from this year onward, such as "Bird" and "Flight" were constructed by welding together strips of iron which were placed in compositions full of dynamism and movement. The transition from linear sculpture to planar sculpture, using cut and bent copper or iron, was a process of natural development for Feigin, who was influenced by the works of [[Pablo]] Picasso done using a similar technique.

In contrast to Feigin, Moshe Sternschuss shows a more gradual development in his move toward abstraction. After finishing his studies at Bezalel, Sternschuss went to study in Paris.  In 1934 he returned to Tel Aviv and was among the founders of the Avni Institute ofArt and Design.  Sternschuss' sculptures during that period displayed an academic modernism, although they were lacking the Zionist features present in art of the Bezalel School. Beginning in the middle of the 1940s, his human figures displayed a marked tendency toward abstraction, as well as a growing use of geometric forms. One of the first of these sculptures was "Dance" (1944),  which was displayed in an exhibition next to "Nimrod" in this year. Actually, Sternschuss' work never became completely abstract, but continued to deal with the human figure by non-figurative means.&lt;ref&gt;See: Irit Hadar, Moses Sternschuss  (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 2001).  [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

When Itzhak Danziger returned to Israel in 1955, he joined "New Horizons" and began making metal sculptures. The style of the sculptures he developed was influenced by constructivist art, which was expressed in its abstract forms. Nonetheless, much of the subject matter of his sculptures was clearly local, as in sculptures with names associated with the Bible, such as "Horns of Hattin" (1956), the place of Saladin's victory over the crusaders in 1187, and The Burning Bush (1957), or with places in Israel, such as "Ein Gedi" (1950s), "Sheep of the Negev" (1963), etc. To a considerable extent this combination characterized the works of many of the artists of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;] A similar analysis of the narrative of Israeli sculpture appears in Gideon Ophrat’s article, “The Secret Canaanism” in ‘New Horizons’,” Studio, No. 2 (August, 1989). [In Hebrew]  The article appears also in his book, With Their Backs to the Sea: Images of Place in Israeli Art and Literature, Israeli Art (Israeli Art Publishing House, 1990), pp. 322–330.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yechiel Shemi]], also one of Danziger's pupils, moved to metal sculpture in 1955 for a practical reason. This move facilitated the move to abstraction in his work. His works, which made use of the technique of soldering, welding, and hammering into thin strips, was one of the first sculptors from this group that worked with these techniques.26  In works such as "Mythos"  (1956) Shemi's connection with the "Caananite" art from which he developed can still be seen, but soon after he eliminated all identifiable signs of figurative art from his work.

Israeli-born [[Ruth Tzarfati]] studied sculpture in Avni's studio with Moses Sternschuss, who became her husband. In spite of the stylistic and social closeness between Zarfati and the "New Horizons" artists, her sculpture shows overtones that are independent from the rest of the members of the group.  This is expressed primarily in her display of figurative sculpture with curved lines. Her sculpture "She Sits" (1953), depicts an unidentified female figure, using lines characteristics of European expressive sculpture, such as the sculpture of Henry Moore. Another group of sculpture, "Baby Girl" (1959) shows a group of children and babies designed as dolls in grotesque expressive poses.

===Sculpture of protest===
[[File:He Walked through the Fields.jpg|thumb|right|250px|He Walked through the Fields (1967) by Yigal Tumarkin]]
In the early 1960s, American influences, particularly abstract expressionism, pop art, and somewhat later, conceptual art, began to appear in Israeli art. In addition to new artistic forms, [[pop art]] and conceptual art brought with them a direct connection to the political and social realities of the time. In contrast, the central trend in Israeli art was towards a preoccupation with the personal and the artistic, ignoring to a large extent a discussion of the Israeli political landscape. Artists who concerned themselves with social or Jewish issues were looked on by the artistic establishment as anarchists.&lt;ref&gt;See: Yona Fischer and Tamar Manor-Friedman, The Birth of Now (Ashdod: Ashdod Museum of Art, 2008), p. 76.  [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first artists whose works expressed not only international artistic influences, but also the tendency to deal with current political issues, was [[Yigal Tumarkin]], who returned to Israel in 1961, at  the encouragement of Yona Fischer and Sam Dubiner, from East Berlin, where he had been the set manager of the Berliner Ensemble theater company, under the direction of Berthold Brecht.&lt;ref&gt;Igael Tumarkin, “Danziger in the Eyes of Igael Tumarkin,” Studio, No. 76 (October–November 1996), pp. 21–23. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; His early sculptures were created as expressive assemblages, put together from parts of various kinds of weapons.  His sculpture "Take Me Under Your Wings"(1964–65), for example, Tumarkin created a sort of steel casing with rifle barrels sticking out of it. The mixture that we see in this sculpture of the nationalistic dimension and the lyric, and even erotic, dimension, was to become a striking element in Tumarkin's political art in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Ginton, Allen, The Eyes of the Country: Visual Arts in a Country Without Borders  (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 1998), p. 28.  [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; A similar approach can be seen in his famous sculpture "He Walked in the Fields" (1967) (the same name as [[Moshe Shamir]]'s famous story), which protested against the image of the "mythological Sabra"; Tumarkin strips off his "skin" and exposes his torn innards from which weapons and ammunition protrude and his stomach, which contains a round bomb that looks suspiciously like a uterus. During the 1970s Tumarkin's art evolved to include new materials influenced by "[[Land art]]," such as dirt, tree branches, and pieces of cloth.  In this way, Tumarkin sought to sharpen the focus of his political protest against what he saw as the one-sided approach of Israeli society toward the Arab-Israeli conflict.

After the Six-Day War Israeli art began to demonstrate other expressions of protest than those of Tumarkin.  At the same time, these works did not look like conventional works of sculpture, made of wood or metal.  The main reason for this was the influence of various kinds of avant-garde art, which developed for the most part in the United States and influenced young Israeli artists.  The spirit of this influence could be seen in a tendency toward active artistic works that blurred both the boundaries between the different fields of art and the separation of the artist from social and political life.  The sculpture of this period was no longer perceived as an independent artistic object, but rather as an inherent expression of physical and social space.

===Landscape sculpture in conceptual art===

Another aspect of these trends was the growing interest in the boundless Israeli landscape. These works were influenced by [[Land Art]] and a combination of the dialectical relationship between the "Israeli" landscape and the "Eastern" landscape. In many works with ritualistic and metaphysical traits, the development or direct influence of the Canaanite artists or sculptors can be seen, along with the abstraction of "New Horizons", in the various relationships with the landscape.

One of the first projects in Israel under the banner of conceptual art was carried out by [[Joshua Neustein]]. In 1970 Neustein, collaborated with [[Georgette Batlle]] and [[Gerry Marx]] on "Jerusalem River Project".  For this project speakers installed across a desert valley played looped sounds of a river in East Jerusalem, in the foothills of [[Abu Tor]] and Saint Claire's Convent, and all the way to the [[Kidron Valley]]. This imaginary river not only created an extraterritorial museum atmosphere, but also hinted in an ironic way at the feeling of messianic redemption after the Six Day War, in the spirit of the [[Book of Ezekiel]] (Chapter 47) and the [[Book of Zechariah]] (Chapter  14).&lt;ref&gt;Ginton, Allen, The Eyes of the Country: Visual Arts in a Country Without Borders  (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 1998), pp. 32–36.  [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yitzhak Danziger]], whose works had begun portraying the local landscape several years earlier, expressed the conceptual aspect in a style he developed as a distinctive Israeli variation of Land Art. Danziger felt that there was a need for reconciliation and improvement in the damaged relationship between man and his environment. This belief led him to plan projects which combined the rehabilitation of sites with ecology and culture. In 1971, Danziger presented his project "Hanging Nature", in a collaborative project in The [[Israel Museum]]. The work was composed of hanging fabric on which was a mixture of colors, plastic emulsion, cellulose fibers, and chemical fertilizer, on which Danziger was growing grass using a system of artificial light and irrigation. Next to the fabric, slides showing the destruction of nature by modern industrialization were screened. The exhibition requested the creation of an ecology unity, which would exist as "art" and as "nature" simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;Yona Fischer , in: Itzhak Danziger,  Place (Tel Aviv: Ha Kibbutz HaMeuhad Publishing House, 1982. (The article is untitled and preceded by the following quotation: “Art precedes science.”  The pages in the book are unnumbered).  [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; The "repair" of the landscape as an artistic event was developed by Danziger in his project "The Rehabilitation of the Nesher Quarry", on the northern slopes of [[Mount Carmel]]. This project was created as a collaboration between Danziger, [[Zeev Naveh]] the ecologist, and [[Joseph Morin (researcher)|Joseph Morin]] the soil researcher.  In this project, which was never finished, they attempted to create, using various technological and ecological means, a new environment among the fragments of stone left in the quarry.  "Nature should not be returned to its natural state," Danziger contended. "A system needs to be found to re-use the nature which has been created as material for an entirely new concept."&lt;ref&gt;From "Rehabilitation of the Nesher Quarry, Israel Museum, 1972, " in: Yona Fischer, in Itzhak Danziger,  Place (Tel Aviv: Ha Kibbutz HaMeuhad Publishing House, 1982. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; After the first stage of the project, the attempt at rehabilitation was put on display in 1972 in an exhibit at the Israel Museum.

In 1973 Danziger began to collect material for a book that would document his work.  Within the framework of the preparation for the book, he documented places of archaeological and contemporary ritual in Israel, places which had become the sources of inspiration for his work. The book, ''Makom'' (in [[Hebrew]] - ''place''), was published in 1982, after Danziger's death, and presented photographs of these places along with Danziger's sculptures, exercises in design,  sketches of his works and ecological ideas, displayed as "sculpture" with the values of abstract art, such as collecting rainwater, etc.  One of the places documented in the book is Bustan Hayat  [could not confirm English spelling-sl ] at Nachal Siach in Haifa, which was built by Aziz Hayat in 1936. Within the framework of classes he gave at the Technion, Danziger conducted experiments in design with his students, involving them also with the care and upkeep of the Bustan.

In 1977 a planting ceremony was conducted in the [[Golan Heights]] for 350 Oak saplings, being planted as a memorial to the fallen soldiers of the Egoz Unit.  Danziger, who was serving as a judge in "the competition for the planning and implementation of the memorial to the Northern Commando Unit," suggested that instead of a memorial sculpture, they put their emphasis on the landscape itself, and on a site that would be different from the usual memorial. ”We felt that any vertical structure, even the most impressive, could not compete with the mountain range itself. When we started climbing up to the site, we discovered that the rocks, that looked from a distance like texture, had a personality all of their own up close."&lt;ref&gt;Itzhak Danziger, The Project for the Memorial to the Fallen Soldiers of the Egoz Commando Unit.  [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; This perception derived from research in Bedouin and Palestinian ritual sites in the Land of Israel,  sites in which the trees serve both as a symbol next to the graves of saints and as a ritual focus, "on which they hang colorful shiny blue and green fabrics from the oaks [...]  People go out to hang these fabrics because of a spiritual need, they go out to make a wish."&lt;ref&gt;] Amnon Barzel, “Landscape as an Artistic Creation” (Interview with Itzhak Danziger), Haaretz (July 27, 1977). [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972 group of young artists who were in touch with Danziger and influenced by his ideas created a group of activities that became known as "Metzer-Messer"  in the area between [[Kibbutz]] [[Metzer]] and the Arab village [[Meiser]] in the north west section of the Shomron. [[Micha Ullman]], with the help of youth from both the kibbutz and the village, dug a hole in each of the communities and implemented an exchange of symbolic red soil between them. [[Moshe Gershuni]] called a meeting of the kibbutz members and handed out the soil of Kibbutz Metzer to them there, and [[Avital Geva]] created in the area between the two communities an improvised library of books recycled from Amnir Recycling Industries.&lt;ref&gt;See: Ginton Allen, The Eyes of the Country: Visual Arts in a Country Without Borders  (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 1998), pp. 88–89.  [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another artist influenced by Danziger's ideas was [[Yigal Tumarkin]], who at the end of the 1970s, created a series of works entitled, "Definitions of Olive Trees and Oaks," in which he created temporary sculpture around trees. Like Danziger, Tumarkin also related in these works to the life forms of popular culture, particularly in Arab and Bedouin villages, and created from them a sort of artistic-morphological language, using "impoverished" bricolage methods.  Some of the works related not only to coexistence and peace, but also to the larger Israeli political picture.   In works such as "Earth Crucifixion" (1981) and "Bedouin Crucifixion" (1982), Tumarkin referred to the ejection of Palestinians and Bedouins from their lands, and created "crucifixion pillars" for these lands.&lt;ref&gt;Yigal Zalmona, Onward: The East in Israeli Art (Jerusalem: The Israel Museum, 1998), pp. 82–83.  For documentation of much of Danziger’s sculptural activity, see Igael Tumarkin, Trees, Stones, and Fabrics in the Wind (Tel Aviv: Masada Publishing House, 1981. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another group that operated in a similar spirit, while at the same time emphasizing Jewish metaphysics, was the group known as the "Leviathians," presided over by Avraham Ofek, Michail Grobman, and Shmuel Ackerman.  The group combined conceptual art and "land art" with Jewish symbolism.  Of the three of them, Avraham Ofek had the deepest interest in sculpture and its relationship to religious symbolism and images.  In one series of his works Ofek used mirrors to project Hebrew letters, words with religious or cabbalistic significance, and other images onto soil or man-made structures.  In his work "Letters of Light" (1979), for example, the letters were projected onto people and fabrics and the soil of the Judean Desert.   In another work Ofek screened the words "America," "Africa," and "Green card" on the walls of the Tel Hai courtyard during a symposium on sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;] See: The Story of Israeli Art, Benjamin Tammuz, Editor (Jerusalem: Masada Publishing House, 1980), pp. 238–240.  Also Gideon Efrat, Abraham Ofek House (Kibbutz Ein Harod, Haim Atar Museum of Art, 1986), primarily pp. 136–148.  [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abstract sculpture===

[[File:Dead Sea Sculpture1986.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Dead Sea Sculpture (1986) by [[Buky Schwartz]]]]
At the beginning of the 1960s [[Menashe Kadishman]] arrived on the scene of abstract sculpture while he was studying in [[London]]. The artistic style he developed in those years was heavily influenced by English art of this period, such as the works of Anthony Caro, who was one of his teachers. At the same time his work was permeated by the relationship between landscape and ritual objects, like Danziger and other Israeli sculptors. During his stay in Europe, Kadishman created a number of totemic images of people, gates, and altars of a talismanic and primitive nature.&lt;ref&gt;] Pierre Restany, Kadishman (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 1996), pp. 43-48. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these works, such as "Suspense" (1966), or "Uprise" (1967–1976), developed into pure geometric figures.

At the end of this decade, in works such as "Aqueduct" (1968–1970) or "Segments" (1969), Kadishman combined pieces of glass separating chunks of stone with a tension of form between the different parts of the sculpture.  With his return to Israel at the beginning of the 1970s, Kadishman began to create works that were clearly in the spirit of "Land Art."  One of his main projects was carried out in 1972.  In the framework of this project Kadishman painted a square in yellow organic paint on the land of the Monastery of the Cross, in the Valley of the Cross at the foot of the Israel Museum. The work became known as a "monument of global nature, in which the landscape depicted by it is both the subject and the object of the creative process."&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Restany, Kadishman (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 1996), p. 127. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Israeli artists also created abstract sculptures charged with symbolism. The sculptures of [[Michael Gross (artist)|Michael Gross]] created an abstraction of the Israeli landscape, while those of [[Yaacov Agam]] contained a Jewish theological aspect. His work was also innovative in its attempt to create [[kinetic art]]. Works of his such as "18 Degrees" (1971) not only eroded the boundary between the work and the viewer of the work but also exhorted the viewer to look at the work actively.

Symbolism of a different kind can be seen in the work of [[Dani Karavan]]. The outdoor sculptures that Karavan created, from "[[Monument to the Negev Brigade]]" (1963-1968) to "White Square" (1989) utilized avant-garde European art to create a symbolic abstraction of the Israeli landscape. In Karavan's use of the techniques of modernist, and primarily brutalist, architecture, as in his museum installations, Karavan created a sort of alternative environment to landscapes, redesigning it as a utopia, or as a call for a dialogue with these landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;See: Ruti Director, “When Politics Becomes Kitsch,” Studio, no. 92 (April 1998), pp. 28–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Micha Ullman continued and developed the concept of nature and the structure of the excavations he carried out on systems of underground structures formulated according to a minimalist aesthetic.  These structures, like the work "Third Watch" (1980), which are presented as defense trenches made of dirt, are also presented as the place which housed the beginning of permanent human existence.&lt;ref&gt;See: Amnon Barzel, Israel: The 1980 Biennale (Jerusalem: Ministry of Education, 1980). [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Buky Schwartz]] absorbed concepts from conceptual art, primarily of the American variety, during the period that he lived in [[New York City]]. Schwartz's work dealt with the way the relationship between the viewer and the work of art is constructed and deconstructed. In the [[video art]] film "Video Structures" (1978-1980) Schwartz demonstrated the dismantling of the geometric illusion using optical methods, that is, marking an illusory form in space and then dismantling this illusion when the human body is interposed.&lt;ref&gt;See: Video Zero:  Written on the Body – A Live Transmission, the Screened Image – the First Decade, edited by Ilana Tannenbaum (Haifa: Haifa Museum of Art, 2006), p. 48, pp. 70–71. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; In sculptures such as "Levitation" (1976) or "Reflection Triangle" (1980), Schwartz dismantled the serious geometry of his sculptures by inserting mirrors that produced the illusion that they were floating in the air, similarly to Kadishman's works in glass.

===Representative sculpture of the 1970s===

[[Performance art]] began to develop in the [[United States]] in the 1960s, trickling into Israeli art towards the end of that decade under the auspices of the "[[Ten Plus]]" group, led by [[Raffi Lavie]] and the "[[Third Eye (performance artists)|Third Eye]]" group, under the leadership of [[Jacques Cathmore]].&lt;ref&gt;See: Video Zero:  Written on the Body -- A Live Transmission, the Screened Image – the First Decade, edited by Ilana Tannenbaum (Haifa: Haifa Museum of Art, 2006) pp. 35–36. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;  A large number of sculptors took advantage of the possibilities that the techniques of Performance Art opened for them with regard to a critical examination of the space around them.  In spite of the fact that many works renounced the need for genuine physical expression, nevertheless the examination they carry out shows the clear way in which the artists related to physical space from the point of view of social, political, and gender issues.

[[Pinchas Cohen Gan]] during those years created a number of displays of a political nature.  In his work "Touching the Border" (January 7, 1974) iron missiles, with Israeli demographic information written on them, were sent to Israel's border. The missiles were buried at the spot where the Israelis carrying them were arrested. In "Performance in a Refugees Camp in Jericho", which took place on February 10, 1974 in the northeast section of the city of Jericho near [[Khirbat al-Mafjar]] (Hisham's Palace), Cohen created a link between his personal experience as an immigrant and the experience of the Palestinian immigrant, by building a tent and a structure that looked like the sail of a boat, which was also made of fabric. At the same time, Cohen Gan set up a conversation about "Israel 25 Years Hence", in the year 2000, between two refugees, and accompanied by the declaration, "A refugee is a person who cannot return to his homeland."&lt;ref&gt;See: Jonathan Allen, The Eyes of the Country: Visual Arts in a Country Without Borders  (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 1998), pp. 142–151.  [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another artist, [[Efrat Natan]], created a number of performances dealing with the dissolution of the connection between the viewer and the work of art, at the same time criticizing Israeli militarism after the Six Day War. Among her important works was "Head Sculpture," in which Natan consulted a sort of wooden sculpture which she wore as a kind of mask on her head. Natan wore the sculpture the day after the army's annual military parade in 1973, and walked with it to various central places in Tel Aviv. The form of the mask, in the shape of the letter "T," bore a resemblance to a cross or an airplane and restricted her field of vision."&lt;ref&gt;See: Video Zero:  Written on the Body -- A Live Transmission, the Screened Image – the First Decade, edited by Ilana Tannenbaum (Haifa: Haifa Museum of Art, 2006), p. 43. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

A blend of political and artistic criticism with poetics can be seen in a number of paintings and installations that Moshe Gershuni created in the 1970s. For Gershuni, who began to be famous during these years as a conceptual sculptor, art and the definition of esthetics was perceived as parallel and inseparable from politics in Israel. Thus, in his work "A Gentle Hand" (1975–1978), Gershuni juxtaposed a newspaper article describing abuse of a Palestinian with a famous love song by [[Zalman Shneur]] (called: "All Her Heart She Gave Him" and the first words of which are "A gentle hand", sung to an Arab melody from the days of the Second Aliyah (1904–1914). Gershuni sang like a muezzin into a loudspeaker placed on the roof of the Tel Aviv Museum. In works like these the minimalist and conceptualist ethics served as a tool for criticizing Zionism and Israeli society.&lt;ref&gt;See: Irit Segoli, “My Red is Your Dear Blood,” Studio, No. 76 (October–November 1996), pp. 38–39. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Gideon Gechtman hasifa 005.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Exposure (Installation view), 1975 by [[Gideon Gechtman]]]]
The works of [[Gideon Gechtman]] during this period dealt with the complex relationship between art and the life of the artist, and with the dialectic between artistic representation and real life.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Efrat, “The Heart of the Matter,” Gideon Gechtman: Works 1971-1986, Autumn 1986, unnumbered. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; In the exhibition "Exposure" (1975), Gechtman described the ritual of shaving his body hair in preparation for heart surgery he had undergone, and used photographed documentation like doctors' letters and x-rays which showed the artificial heart valve implanted in his body. In other works, such as "Brushes" (1974–1975), he uses hair from his head and the heads of family members and attaches it to different kinds of brushes, which he exhibits in wooden boxes, as a kind of box of ruins (a reliquary). These boxes were created according to strict minimalistic esthetic standards.

Another major work of Gechtman's during this period was exhibited in the exhibition entitled "Open Workshop" (1975) at the [[Israel Museum]]. The exhibition summarized the sociopolitical "activity" known as "Jewish Work" and, within this framework," Gechtman participated as a construction worker in the building of a new wing of the Museum and lived within the exhibition space.  on the construction site.  Gechtman also hung obituaries bearing the name "Jewish Work" and a photograph of the homes of Arab workers on the construction site.  In spite of the clearly political aspects of this work, its complex relationship to the image of the artist in society is also evident.

==1980s and 1990s==
In the 1980s, influences from the international postmodern discourse began to trickle into Israeli art. Particularly important was the influence of philosophers such as Jacques Derrida and Jean Baudrillard, who formulated the concept of the semantic and relative nature of reality in their philosophical writings. The idea that the artistic representation is composed of "simulacra", objects in which the internal relation between the signifier and the signified is not direct, created a feeling that the status of the artistic object in general, and of sculpture in particular, was being undermined.

Gideon Gechtman's work expresses the transition from the conceptual approach of the 1970s to the 1980s, when new strategies were adopted that took real objects (death notices, a hospital, a child's wagon) and gradually converted them into objects of art.&lt;ref&gt;See: Neta Gal-Atzmon, “Cycles of Original and Imitation: Works 1973-2003,” in Gideon Gechtman, Hedva, Gideon, and All the Rest (Tel Aviv: Association of Painters and Sculptors) (Unnumbered looseleaf folder).  [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; The real objects were recreated in various artificial materials.  Death notices, for example, were made out of colored neon lights, like those used in advertisements.  Other materials Gechtman used in this period were formica and imitation marble, which in themselves emphasized the artificiality of the artistic representation and its non-biographical nature.

[[File:Nahum Tevet, Painting Lesson, no 5.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Nahum Tevet]]&lt;br&gt;Painting Lesson, no 5, 1986&lt;br&gt;Acrylic and industrial paint on wood; found object&lt;br&gt;[[Israel Museum]] collection]]
During the 1980s, the works of a number of sculptors were known for their use of plywood. The use of this material served to emphasize the way large-scale objects were constructed, often within the tradition of do-it-yourself carpentry. The concept behind this kind of sculpture emphasized the non-heroic nature of a work of art, related to the "Arte Povera" style, which was at the height of its influence during these years. Among the most conspicuous of the artists who first used these methods is [[Nahum Tevet]], who began his career in the 1970s as a sculptor in the minimalist and conceptual style. While in the early 1970s he used a severe, nearly monastic, style in his works, from the beginning of the 1980s he began to construct works that were more and more complex, composed of disassembled parts, built in home-based workshops. The works are described as "a trap configuration, which seduces the eye into penetrating the content [...] but is revealed as a false temptation that blocks the way rather than leading somewhere."&lt;ref&gt;Sarit Shapira, One Thing at a Time (Jerusalem: Israel Museum, 2007), p. 21. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; The group of sculptors who called themselves "Drawing Lessons,"  from the middle of the decade, and other works, such as "Ursa Major (with eclipse)" (1984) and "Jemmain" (1986)  created a variety of points of view, disorder, and spatial disorientation, which "demonstrate the subject's loss of stability in the postmodernist world."&lt;ref&gt;See: Nahum Tevet in the “Check-Post” exhibition (Website of the Haifa Museum of Art).&lt;/ref&gt;

The sculptures of [[Drora Domini]] as well dealt with the construction and deconstruction of structures with a domestic connection.  Many of them featured disassembled images of furniture.  The abstract structures she built, on a relatively small scale, contained absurd connections between them.  Towards the end of the decade Domini began to combine additional images in her works from compositions in the "ars poetica" style.&lt;ref&gt;See: Drora Dumani in the “Check-Post” exhibition (Website of the Haifa Museum of Art).&lt;/ref&gt;

Another artist who created wooden structures  was the sculptor [[Isaac Golombek]]. His works from the end of the decade included familiar objects reconstructed from plywood and with their natural proportions distorted.  The items he produced had structures one on top of another. [[Itamar Levy]], in his article "High Low Profile" [Rosh katan godol],&lt;ref&gt;See: Itamar Levy, “High Low Profile,” Studio: Journal of Art, No. 111 (February 2000), pp. 38-45.  [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; describes the relationship between the viewer and Golombek's works as an experiment in the separation of the sense of sight from the senses of touching and feeling. The bodies that Golombek describes are dismantled bodies, conducting a protest dialogue against the gaze of the viewer, who aspires to determine one unique, protected, and explainable identity for the work of art. While the form of the object represents a clear identity, the way they are made distances the usefulness of the objects and disrupts the feeling of materiality of the items.

A different kind of construction can be seen in the performances of the [[Zik Group]], which came into being in the middle of the 1980s. Within the framework of its performances, the Group built large-scale wooden sculptures and created ritualistic activities around them, combining a variety of artistic techniques. When the performance ended, they set fire to the sculpture in a public burning ceremony. In the 1990s, in addition to destruction, the group also took began to focus on the transformation of materials and did away with the public burning ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;The Zik Group: Twenty Years of Work, edited by Daphna Ben-Shaul (Jerusalem: Keter Publishing House, 2005).  [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another effect of the postmodern approach was the protest against historical and cultural narratives. Art was not yet perceived as ideology, supporting or opposing the discourse on Israeli hegemony, but rather as the basis for a more open and pluralistic discussion of reality.  In the era following the "political revolution"  which resulted from the 1977 election, this was expressed in the establishment of the "identity discussion," in which parts of society that up to now had not usually been represented in the main Israeli discourse were included.

In the beginning of the 1980s expressions of the trauma of the [[Holocaust]] began to appear in Israeli society. In the works of the "second generation" there began to appear figures taken from [[World War II]], combined with an attempt to establish a personal identity as an Israeli and as a Jew.  Among the pioneering works were [[Moshe Gershuni]]'s installation "Red Sealing/Theatre" (1980) and the works of [[Haim Maor]]. These expressions became more and more explicit in the 1990s. A large group of works was created by [[Igael Tumarkin]], who combined in his monumental creations dialectical images representing the horrors of the Holocaust with the world of European culture in which it occurred. The artist [[Penny Yassour]], for example, represented the Holocaust in a series of structures and models in which hints and quotes referring to the war appear. In the work "Screens" (1996), which was displayed at the "Documenta" exhibition, Yassour created a map of German trains in 1938 in the form of a table made out of rubber, as part of an experiment to present the memory and describe the relationship between private and public memory.&lt;ref&gt;] See: Galia Bar Or, “Parodoxical Space,” Studio, No. 109 (November–December 1999), pp. 45–53. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; The other materials Yassour used – metal and wood that created different architectonic spaces – produced an atmosphere of isolation and horror.

Another aspect of raising the memory of the Holocaust to the public consciousness was the focus on the immigrants who came to Israel during the first decades after the founding of the State.  These attempts were accompanied by a protest against the image of the Israeli "[[Sabra (person)|Sabra]]" and an emphasis on the feeling of detachment of the immigrants. The sculptor [[Philip Rentzer]] presented, in a number of works and installations, the image of the immigrant and the refugee in Israel.  His works, constructed from an assemblage of various ready-made materials, show the contrast between the permanence of the domestic and the feeling of impermanence of the immigrant. In his installation "The Box from Nes Ziona" (1998), Rentzer created an Orientalist camel carrying on its back the immigrants' shack of Rentzer's family, represented by skeletons carrying ladders.&lt;ref&gt;See: “Immigrant With a Compulsion,” Ynet  website: http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3476177,00.html   [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to expressions of the Holocaust, a growing expression of the motifs of Jewish art can be seen in Israeli art of the 1990s. In spite of the fact that motifs of this kind could be seen in the past in art of such artists as [[Arie Aroch]], [[Moshe Castel]], and [[Mordechai Ardon]], the works of Israeli artists of the 1990s displayed a more direct relationship to the world of Jewish symbols. One of the most visible of the artists who used these motifs, [[Belu Simion Fainaru]] used Hebrew letters  and other symbols as the basis for the creation of objects with metaphysical-religious significance. In his work "Sham" ("There" in Hebrew) (1996), for example, Fainaru created a closed structure, with windows in the form of the Hebrew letter [[Shin (letter)|Shin]] (ש). In another work, he made a model of a synagogue (1997), with windows in the shape of the letters, [[Aleph]] (א) to [[Zayin]] (ז) - one to seven - representing the seven days of the creation of the world.&lt;ref&gt;David Schwarber, Ifcha Mistabra: The Culture of the Temple and Contemporary Israeli Art (Ramat Gan: Bar Ilan University), pp. 46–47.  [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1990s we also begin to see various representations of [[Gender]] and sexual motifs.  [[Sigal Primor]] exhibited works that dealt with the image of women in Western culture.  In an environmental sculpture she placed on Sderot Chen in Tel Aviv-Jaffa, Primor created a replica of furniture made of stainless steel. In this way, the structure points out the gap between personal, private space and public space. In many of Primor's works there is an ironic relationship to the motif of the "bride", as seen Marcel Duchamp's work, "The Glass Door". In her work "The Bride", materials such as cast iron, combined with images using other techniques such as photography, become objects of desire.

In her installation "Dinner Dress (Tales About Dora)" (1997), [[Tamar Raban]] turned a dining room table four meters in diameter into a huge crinoline and she organized an installation that took place both on top of and under the dining room table. The public was invited to participate in the meal prepared by chef Tsachi  Bukshester and watch what was going on under the table on monitors placed under the transparent glass dinner plates.&lt;ref&gt;For documentation on the installation, see: “Dinner Dress” and the associated video on YouTube.&lt;/ref&gt; The installation raises questions about the perceptions of memory and personal identity in a variety of ways.  During the performance, Raban would tell stories about "Dora," Raban's mother 's name, with reference to the figure "Dora" – a nickname for [[Ida Bauer]], one of the historic patients of [[Sigmund Freud]]. In the corner of the room was the artist [[Pnina Reichman]], embroidering words and letters in English, such as "all those lost words" and "contaminated memory," and counting in [[Yiddish]].&lt;ref&gt;See: Levia Stern, “Conversations About Dora,” Studio: Journal of Art, No. 91 (March 1998), pp. 34–37. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

The centrality of the gender discussion in the international cultural and art scene had an influence on Israeli artists. In the video art works of [[Hila Lulu Lin]], the protest against the traditional concepts of women's sexuality stood out. In her work "No More Tears" (1994), Lulu Lin appeared passing an egg yolk back and forth between her hand and her mouth. Other artists sought not only to express in their art homoeroticism and feelings of horror and death, but also to test the social legitimacy of homosexuality and lesbianism in Israel. Among these artists the creative team of [[Nir Nader]] and [[Erez Harodi]], and the performance artist [[Dan Zakheim]] stand out.

As the world of Israeli art was exposed to the art of the rest of the world, especially from the 1990s, a striving toward the "total visual experience,"&lt;ref&gt;Amitai Mendelson, “The Opening and Closing Spectacles: Rumblings About Art in Israel,1998-2007,” Real-time (Jerusalem: Israel Museum, 2008).  [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; expressed in large-scale installations and in the use of theatrical technologies, particularly of video art, can be seen in the works of many Israeli artists.  The subject of many of these installations is a critical test of space. Among these artists can be found [[Ohad Meromi]] and [[Michal Rovner]], who creates video installations in which human activities are converted into ornamental designs of texts. In the works of [[Uri Tzaig]] the use of video to test the activity of the viewer as a critical activity stands out. In "Universal Square" (2006), for example, Tzaig created a video art film in which two football teams compete on a field with two balls. The change in the regular rules created a variety of opportunities for the players to come up with new plays on the space of the football field.

Another well-known artist who creates large-scale installations is [[Sigalit Landau]]. Landau creates expressive environments with multiple sculptures laden with political and social allegorical significance. The apocalyptic exhibitions Landau mounted, such as "The Country" (2002) or "Endless Solution" (2005), succeeded in reaching large and varied segments of the population.

In Israel there are many memorial sculptures whose purpose is to perpetuate the memory of various events in the history of the Jewish people and the State of Israel. Since the memorial sculptures are displayed in public spaces, they tend to serve as an expression of popular art of the period.  The first memorial sculpture erected in the Land of Israel was “[[The Roaring Lion]]”, which [[Abraham Melnikoff]] sculpted in [[Tel Hai]]. The large proportions of the statue and the public funding that Melnikoff recruited towards its construction, was an innovation for the small Israeli art scene. From a sculptural standpoint, the statue was connected to the beginnings of the “Caananite” movement in art.

The memorial sculptures erected in Israel up to the beginning of the 1950s, most of which were memorials for the fallen soldiers of the War of Independence, were characterized for the most part by their figurative subjects and elegiac overtones, which were aimed at the emotions of the Zionist Israeli public.&lt;ref&gt;See: Gideon Efrat, “The Dialectic of the 1950s: Hegemony and Multiciplicity,”  in: Gideon Efrat and Galia Bar Or, The First Decade: Hegemony and Multiciplicity  (Kibbutz Ein Harod, Haim Atar Museum of Art, 2008), p. 18. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;  The structure of the memorials was designed as spatial theater.  The accepted model for the memorial included a wall with a wall covered in stone or marble, the back of which remained unused. On it, the names of the fallen soldiers were engraved. Alongside this was a relief of a wounded soldier or an allegorical description, such as descriptions of lions.  A number of memorial sculptures were erected as the central structure on a ceremonial surface meant to be viewed from all sides.&lt;ref&gt;See: Avner  Ben-Amos, “The Theater of Memory and Death: Memorials and Ceremonies in Israel,” in Drora Dumani, Everywhere: Israeli Landscape with Memorial  (Tel Aviv: Hargol, 2002).  [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the design of these memorial sculptures we can see significant differences among the accepted patterns of memory of that period. [[Hashomer Hatzair]] (The Youth Guard) kibbutzim, for example, erected heroic memorial sculptures, such as the sculptures erected on Kibbutz [[Yad Mordechai]] (1951) or Kibbutz [[Negba]] (1953), which were expressionist attempts to emphasize the ideological and social connections between art and the presence of public expression.  Within the framework of [[HaKibbutz Ha’Artzi]] intimate memorial sculptures were erected, such as the memorial sculpture “Mother and Child”, which [[Chana Orloff]] erected at Kibbutz [[Ein Gev]] (1954) or [[Yechiel Shemi|Yechiel Shemi's]] sculpture on Kibbutz Hasolelim (1954).  These sculptures emphasized the private world of the individual and tended toward the abstract.&lt;ref&gt;See: Galia Bar Or, “Universal and International: The Art of the Kibbutz in the First Decade,” in Gideon Efrat and Galia Bar Or, The First Decade: Hegemony and Multiciplicity  (Kibbutz Ein Harod, Haim Atar Museum of Art, 2008), p. 88. [In Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most famous memorial sculptors during the first decades after the founding of the State of Israel was [[Nathan Rapoport]], who immigrated to Israel in 1950, after he had already erected a memorial sculpture in the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] to the fighters of the Ghetto (1946–1948).  Rapoport’s many memorial sculptures, erected as memorials on government sites and on sites connected to the War of Independence, were representatives of sculptural expressionism, which took its inspiration from Neoclassicism as well. At Warsaw Ghetto Square at Yad Vashem (1971), Rapoport created a relief entitled “The Last March”, which depicts a group of Jews holding a Torah scroll. To the left of this, Rapoport erected a copy of the sculpture he created for the Warsaw Ghetto. In this way, a “Zionist narrative” of the Holocaust was created, emphasizing the heroism of the victims alongside the mourning.

In contrast to the figurative art which had characterized it earlier, from the 1950s on a growing tendency towards abstraction began to appear in memorial sculpture. At the center of the “Pilots’ Memorial" (1950s), erected by [[Benjamin Tammuz]] and [[Aba Elhanani]] in the Independence Park in Tel Aviv-Yaffo, stands an image of a bird flying above a Tel Aviv seaside cliff. The tendency toward the abstract can also be seen the work by [[David Palombo]], who created reliefs and memorial sculptures for government institutions like the Knesset and Yad Vashem, and in many other works, such as the memorial to [[Shlomo Ben-Yosef]] that [[Itzhak Danziger]] erected in [[Rosh Pina]]. However, the epitome of this trend toward avoidance of figurative images stands our starkly in the “Monument to the Negev Brigade” (1963–1968) which [[Dani Karavan]] created on the outskirts of the city of [[Beersheva]]. The monument was planned as a structure made of exposed concrete occasionally adorned with elements of metaphorical significance. The structure was an attempt to create a physical connection between itself and the desert landscape in which it stands, a connection conceptualized in the way the visitor wanders and views the landscape from within the structure. A mixture of symbolism and abstraction can be found in the “Monument to the Holocaust and National Revival”, erected in Tel Aviv’s [[Rabin Square]] (then “Kings of Israel Square”). [[Igael Tumarkin]], creator of the sculpture, used elements that created the symbolic form of an inverted pyramid made of metal, concrete, and glass. In spite of the fact that the glass is supposed to reflect what is happening in this urban space,&lt;ref&gt;Yigal Tumarkin, "Monument to the Holocaust and Revival", in Tumarkin (Tel Aviv: Masada Publishing House, 1991 (unnumbered pages)&lt;/ref&gt; the monument didn’t express the desire for the creation of a new space which would carry on a dialogue with the landscape of the “Land of Israel”. The pyramid sits on a triangular base, painted yellow, reminiscent of the “Mark of Cain”. The two structures together form a [[Magen David]].  Tumarkin saw in this form “a prison cell that has been opened and breached. An overturned pyramid, which contains within itself, imprisoned in its base, the confined and the burdensome.”&lt;ref&gt;] Yigal Tumarkin, "Monument to the Holocaust and Revival", in Tumarkin (Tel Aviv: Masada Publishing House, 1991 (unnumbered pages)&lt;/ref&gt; The form of the pyramid shows up in another work of the artists as well. In a late interview with him, Tumarkin confided that the pyramid can be perceived also as the gap between ideology and its enslaved results: “What have we learned since the great pyramids were built 4200 years ago?[...]  Do works of forced labor and death liberate?”&lt;ref&gt;Michal K. Marcus, In the Spacious Time of Yigal Tumarkin.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s memorial sculptures began to be built in a theatrical style, abandoning the abstract. In the “Children’s Memorial” (1987), or the “Yad Vashem Train Car” (1990) by [[Moshe Safdie]], or in the Memorial to the victims of “The Israeli Helicopter Disaster” (2008), alongside the use of symbolic forms, we see the trend towards the use of various techniques to intensify the emotional experience of the viewer.

==Characteristics==
[[File:בית רוקח13.JPG|thumb|250px|Women sculptures of Lea Majaro-Mintz]]
Attitudes toward the realistic depiction of the human body are complex. The birth of Israeli sculpture took place concurrently with the flowering of avantgarde and modernist European art, whose influence on sculpture from the 1930s to the present day is significant. In the 1940s the trend toward primitivism among local artists was dominant.  With the appearance of “Canaanite” art we see an expression of the opposite concept of the human body, as part of the image of the landscape of “The Land of Israel.” That same desolate desert landscape became a central motif in many works of art until the 1980s.  With regard to materials, we see a small amount of use of stone and marble in traditional techniques of excavation and carving, and a preference for casting and welding. This phenomenon was dominant primarily in the 1950s, as a result of the popularity of the abstract sculpture of the “New Horizons” group. In addition, this sculpture enabled artists to create art on a monumental scale, which was not common in Israeli art until then.

'''John Scotus Eriugena''' or '''Johannes Scotus Erigena''' ({{IPAc-en|dʒ|oʊ|ˈ|h|æ|n|iː|z|_|ˈ|s|k|oʊ|t|ə|s|_|ɪ|ˈ|r|ɪ|dʒ|ə|n|ə}}; c. 815 – c. 877) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] theologian, [[Neoplatonism|neoplatonist]] philosopher, and poet. He wrote a number of works, but is best known today for having written ''The Division of Nature'', which has been called the final achievement of ancient philosophy, a work which "synthesizes the philosophical accomplishments of fifteen centuries." 

Eriugena argued on behalf of something like a [[Pantheism|pantheistic]] definition of nature.&lt;ref name=Weinstein/&gt; He translated and made commentaries upon the work of [[Pseudo-Dionysius]], and was one of the few Western European philosophers of his day that knew Greek, having studied in Athens. Famously, he is said to have been stabbed to death by his students at [[Malmesbury]] with their pens.

==Name==
The form "Eriugena" of his [[Epithet|byname]] is used by John Scotus to describe himself in one manuscript.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}  It means 'Ireland (Ériu)-born'. 'Scottus' in the [[Middle Ages]] was the Latin term for "[[Gaels|Irish]] or [[Gaels|Gaelic]]", so his name translates as "John, the Irish-born Gael." 'Scotti" was the name that the Romans called the Irish.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|scot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spelling 'Scottus' has the authority of the early manuscripts until perhaps the 11th century. Occasionally he is also named 'Scottigena' ("Irish-born") in the manuscripts.

He is not to be confused with the later philosopher [[Duns Scotus|John Duns Scotus]].

==Life==
Johannes Scotus Eriugena was an Irishman, educated in Ireland.  He moved to France (about 845) and took over the Palace School at the invitation of [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian]] King [[Charles the Bald]]. He succeeded [[Alcuin of York]] (735–804) as head of the [[Carolingian Schools|Palace School]].&lt;ref name=eriugena&gt;{{Citation | chapter = John Scotus Erigena | url = https://archive.org/details/ageofbelief007499mbp |title=The Age of Belief | editor-first = Anne | editor-last = Freemantle | series  = [[The Mentor Philosophers]] | publisher = Houghton Mifflin Company | date = 1954–1955 | pages = [https://archive.org/stream/ageofbelief007499mbp#page/n77/mode/2up 72–87]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The reputation of this school, part of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]], seems to have increased greatly under Eriugena's leadership, and the philosopher himself was treated with indulgence by the king. Whereas Alcuin was a schoolmaster rather than a philosopher, Eriugena was a noted [[Greek language|Greek]] scholar, a skill which, though rare at that time in Western Europe, was used in the learning tradition of Early and Medieval Ireland, as evidenced by the use of Greek script in medieval Irish manuscripts.&lt;ref name=eriugena/&gt; He remained in France for at least thirty years, and it was almost certainly during this period that he wrote his various works.

The latter part of his life is unclear. There is a story that in 882 he was invited to [[Oxford]] by [[Alfred the Great]], laboured there for many years, became abbot at [[Malmesbury, Wiltshire|Malmesbury]], and was stabbed to death by his pupils with their ''[[stylus|styli]]''. Whether this is to be taken literally or figuratively is not clear,&lt;ref name=carab&gt;{{Citation | volume = John Scottus Eriugena | title = Great Medieval Thinkers | first = Deirdre | last = Caribine | publisher = Oxford University Press | page = 14}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and some scholars think it may refer to some other Johannes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Jean Scot Érigène, sa vie, son oeuvre, sa pensée | first = M | last = Cappuyns | place = Louvain, [[Belgium|BE]]; Mont César | year = 1933 | pages = 252–53}}. Figuratively, present day professors might recognize the irony in dying from the results of their students' pens.&lt;/ref&gt; He probably never left France, and the date of his death is generally given as 877.&lt;ref&gt;The nineteenth-century French historian, [[Hauréau]] advanced some reasons for fixing this date.&lt;/ref&gt; From the evidence available, it is impossible to determine whether he was a [[cleric]] or a [[layman]]; the general conditions of the time make it likely that he was a cleric and perhaps a [[monk]].

==Works==
His work is largely based upon [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]], [[Pseudo-Dionysius]], [[Maximus the Confessor]], and the [[Cappadocian Fathers]], and is clearly Neoplatonist. He revived the [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendentalist]] standpoint of Neoplatonism with its "graded hierarchy" approach. By going back to [[Plato]], he revived the [[nominalist]]–[[Medieval realism|realist]] debate.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dermot Moran]], ''The Philosophy of John Scottus Eriugena: A Study of Idealism in the Middle Ages'', Cambridge University Press, 2004, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first of the works known to have been written by Eriugena during this period was a treatise on the [[Eucharist]], which has not survived.  In it he seems to have advanced the doctrine that the Eucharist was merely symbolical or commemorative, an opinion for which [[Berengarius of Tours|Berengar of Tours]] was at a later date censured and condemned. As a part of his penance, Berengarius is said to have been compelled to burn publicly Eriugena's treatise. So far as we can learn, however, Eriugena was considered orthodox and a few years later was selected by [[Hincmar]], [[archbishop of Reims]], to defend the [[free will|doctrine of liberty of will]] against the extreme [[predestination|predestinarianism]] of the monk [[Gottschalk (theologian)|Gottschalk]] (Gotteschalchus). Many in the Church opposed Gottschalk's position because it denied the inherent value of good works. The treatise ''De divina praedestinatione'' composed for this occasion has been preserved, and it was probably from its content that Eriugena's orthodoxy became suspect.&lt;ref name = eriugena /&gt;

Eriugena argues the question of predestination entirely on speculative grounds, and starts with the bold affirmation that philosophy and religion are fundamentally one and the same. Even more significant is his handling of authority and reason. Eriugena offered a skilled proof that there can be predestination only to the good, for all folk are summoned to be saints.&lt;ref name = eriugena /&gt; The work was warmly assailed by Drepanius Florus, canon of Lyons, and Prudentius, and was condemned by two councils: that of [[Valence, Drôme|Valence]] in 855, and that of [[Langres]] in 859. By the former council his arguments were described as ''Pultes Scotorum'' ("Irish porridge") and ''commentum diaboli'' ("an invention of the devil").

Eriugena believed that all people and all beings, including animals, reflect attributes of God, towards whom all are capable of progressing and to which all things ultimately must return.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Eriugena was a believer in ''[[apocatastasis]]'' or [[universal reconciliation]],{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} which maintains that the universe will eventually be restored under God's dominion (see also [[Christian Universalism]]).&lt;ref name="nndb"&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.nndb.com/people/756/000095471/ | chapter = Johannes Scotus Erigena | title = Notable Names Database | accessdate = 5 August 2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Translation of Pseudo-Dionysius===
At some point in the centuries before Eriugena a legend had developed that Saint [[Denis]], the first [[Bishop of Paris]] and patron saint of the important [[Basilica of St Denis|Abbey of Saint-Denis]], was the same person as both the [[Dionysius the Areopagite]] mentioned in Acts 17.34, and [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]], a figure whose writings were not yet being circulated in the West in the ninth century (it was not until the sixteenth century, except by [[Peter Abelard|Abelard]],{{cn|date=March 2017}} that it was realised that these two figures were not connected). Accordingly, in the 820s ambassadors from the Byzantine emperor to the court of [[Louis the Pious]] donated Louis a Greek manuscript of the Dionysian corpus, which was immediately given to the Abbey of Saint Denis in the care of Abbot [[Hilduin]]. Hilduin proceeded to direct a translation of the Dionysian corpus from Greek into Latin, based on this single manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Rorem, 'The Early Latin Dionysius: Eriugena and Hugh of St Victor’, "Modern Theology" 24:4, (2008), p. 602.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after, probably by the middle of the ninth century, Eriugena made a second Latin translation of the Dionysian corpus, and much later wrote a commentary on "The Celestial Hierarchy". This constitutes the first major Latin reception of the Areopagite. It is unclear why Eriugena made a new translation so soon after Hilduin's. It has often been suggested that Hilduin's translation was deficient; though this is a possibility, it was a serviceable translation. Another possibility is that Eriugena's creative energies and his inclination toward Greek theological subjects motivated him to make a new translation.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Rorem, ‘The Early Latin Dionysius: Eriugena and Hugh of St Victor’, "Modern Theology" 24:4, (2008), p602.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eriugena's next work was a Latin translation of Dionysius the Areopagite undertaken at the request of Charles the Bald. This also has been preserved, and fragments of a commentary by Eriugena on Dionysius have been discovered in manuscript. {{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}A translation of the Areopagite's writings was not likely to alter the opinion already formed as to Eriugena's orthodoxy. [[Pope Nicholas I]] was offended that the work had not been submitted for approval before being given to the world, and ordered Charles to send Eriugena to Rome, or at least to dismiss him from his court. {{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} There is no evidence, however, that this order was carried out.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

At the request of the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine]] emperor [[Michael III]] (ca. 858), Eriugena undertook some translation into [[Latin language|Latin]] of the works of Pseudo-Dionysius and added his own commentary. {{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

With this translation, he was the first since Saint Augustine to introduce the ideas of Neoplatonism from the Greek into the Western European intellectual tradition, where they were to have a strong influence on Christian theology. {{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

===''Periphyseon''===
{{Main|De divisione naturae}}
Eriugena's great work, ''De divisione naturae'' (''On the Division of Nature'') or ''Periphyseon'', which was condemned by a [[council at Sens]] by [[Honorius III]] (1225), who described it as "swarming with worms of [[heresy|heretical]] perversity," and by [[Gregory XIII]] in 1585, is arranged in five books. The form of exposition is that of [[dialogue]]; the method of reasoning is the [[syllogism]]. Nature (''Natura'' in Latin or ''physis'' in Greek) is the name of the most comprehensive of all unities, that which contains within itself the most primary division of all things, that which is (being) and that which is not (nonbeing).  

The Latin title refers to these four divisions of nature: (1) that which creates and is not created; (2) that which is created and creates; (3) that which is created and does not create; (4) that which is neither created nor creates. The first is God as the ground or origin of all things, the last is God as the final end or goal of all things, that into which the world of created things ultimately returns. The second and third together compose the created [[universe]], which is the manifestation of God, God in process, ''Theophania''; the second is the world of [[Plato]]nic ideas or [[Theory of forms|forms]], and the third is a more [[Pantheism|pantheistic]] world, or a [[Pandeism|pandeistic]] one,&lt;ref name=Weinstein&gt;[[Max Bernhard Weinstein]], ''Welt- und Lebensanschauungen, Hervorgegangen aus Religion, Philosophie und Naturerkenntnis'' ("World and Life Views, Emerging From Religion, Philosophy and Nature") (1910), page 283-84: "Johannes Scotus Erigena.... läßt in einer seiner mehreren Ansichten alles von Gott emaniert sein. Gottes Klarheit, welche mit Recht auch Dunkelheit genannt wird, breite sich über alles aus. Die ungeformte Materie soll nur das Unendliche bedeuten, welches, da es formlos sei, alle Formen in sich enthalte. Gott hat die Welt aus seinem eigenen Wesen gebildet. Jedes Geschöpf ist eine Theophanie, ein Sichoffenbarmachen Gottes. Gott sei an sich vorhanden wie ein Gedanke im Menschen bestehe; er manifestiere sich in der Welt durch sich selbst, wie ein Gedanke, der sich denkt, sich selbst zur Erkenntnis komme. So sei Gott ohne die Welt absolut negativ. Es klingt wie eine Blasphemie, wenn gesagt wird, Gott wisse nicht, was er sei, und er werde erst geschaffen mit der Schöpfung, indem er sich in seiner Schöpfung offenbart, die Schöpfung so aus Nichts hervorbringend. Das ist auch fast so abstrakt wie die indische Tad-Anschauung. Freilich bleibt es bei diesem absoluten, und ja auch nicht zu durchdringenden, Pandeismus nicht. Wie der Indier muß Scotus Gott doch etwas zuschreiben, Willen, und die Geschöpfe sind dann Willensakte. Der Wille ist persönlich als Emanation Gottes (als Christus) gedacht, wie wohl auch die Ursachen (zusammengefaßt als Heiliger Geist), die Scotus von Gott ausgehen läßt, Emanationen sind, und die Wirkungen, die wieder von ihnen ausgehen, Emanationen ihrer selbst darstellen."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Jean-Jacques Gabut|Jean-Jacques Gabut]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=50FDDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT23&amp;dq=pand%C3%A9isme&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiByZ3owbveAhULxVkKHQRbBscQ6AEINTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=pand%C3%A9isme&amp;f=false Origines et fondements spirituels et sociologiques de la maçonnerie écossaise]'', 2017: ''Par ailleurs, un certain panthéisme, ou plutôt « pandéisme », se dégage de son œuvre où l'inspiration néoplatonicienne complète parfaitement la stricte orthodoxie chrétienne.'' ("Moreover, a certain pantheism, or rather ''pandeism'', emerges from his work where Neo-Platonic inspiration perfectly complements the strict Christian orthodoxy."&lt;/ref&gt; depending on the interference of God. 

Thus we distinguish in the divine system beginning, middle and end. These three are in essence one; the difference is only the consequence of our finite comprehension. We are compelled to envisage this eternal process under the form of time, to apply temporal distinctions to that which is extra- or supra-temporal. It is in turn through our experience that the incomprehensible divine is able to frame an understanding of itself.

''The Division of Nature'' has been called the final achievement of ancient philosophy, a work which "synthesizes the philosophical accomplishments of fifteen centuries." It is presented, like Alcuin's book, as a dialogue between Master and Pupil. Eriugena anticipates [[Thomas Aquinas]], who said that one cannot know and believe a thing at the same time. Eriugena explains that reason is necessary to understand and interpret revelation. "Authority is the source of knowledge, but the reason of mankind is the norm by which all authority is judged."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/ageofbelief007499mbp The Age of Belief], ''cit.'', [https://archive.org/stream/ageofbelief007499mbp#page/n85/mode/2up p. 80]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Eriugena's work is distinguished by the freedom of his speculation, and the boldness with which he works out his [[logic]]al or [[dialectic]]al system of the universe.  He marks, indeed, a stage of transition from the older [[Plato]]nizing philosophy to the later scholasticism.  For him philosophy is not in the service of theology.  The above-quoted assertion as to the substantial identity between philosophy and religion is repeated almost word for word by many of the later scholastic writers, but its significance depends upon the selection of one or other term of the identity as fundamental or primary. For Eriugena, philosophy or reason is first, primitive; authority or religion is secondary, derived.

His influence was greater with [[mysticism|mystics]] than with logicians, but he was responsible for a revival of philosophical thought which had remained largely dormant in western Europe after the death of [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]].

After Eriugena another medieval thinker of significance was [[Berengar of Tours]], professor at the monastic school in the French city.  Berengar believed that truth is obtained through reason rather than revelation.  [[St. Peter Damian]] agreed with [[Tertullian]] that it is not necessary for people to philosophize because God has spoken for them. Damian was prior of [[Fonte Avellana]] and afterward [[Cardinal-Bishop of Ostia]]. He died in 1072. [[Lanfranc]] (1005–89) was prior of [[Bec (placename element)|Bec]] in Normandy. Like Damian he believed mostly in faith, but admitted the importance of reason. [[St. Anselm]] was a pupil and successor of St. Peter Damian.&lt;ref name=eriugena/&gt;

{{Quotation|On the whole, one might be surprised that even in the seventeenth century pantheism did not gain a complete victory over theism; for the most original, finest, and most thorough European expositions of it (none of them, of course, will bear comparison with the ''[[Upanishads]]'' of the ''[[Vedas]]'') all came to light at that period, namely through [[Giordano Bruno|Bruno]], [[Nicolas Malebranche|Malebranche]], [[Spinoza]], and Scotus Erigena.  After Scotus Erigena had been lost and forgotten for many centuries, he was again discovered at Oxford and in 1681, thus four years after Spinoza's death, his work first saw the light in print.  This seems to prove that the insight of individuals cannot make itself felt so long as the spirit of the age is not ripe to receive it.  On the other hand, in our day (1851) pantheism, although presented only in [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]]'s eclectic and confused revival thereof, has become the dominant mode of thought of scholars and even of educated people. This is because [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] had preceded it with his overthrow of theistic [[dogmatism]] and had cleared the way for it, whereby the spirit of the age was ready for it, just as a ploughed field is ready for the seed.|[[Schopenhauer]], ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', Vol. I, "Sketch of a History of the Doctrine of the Ideal and the Real".}}

[[Leszek Kołakowski]], a Polish Marx scholar, has mentioned Eriugena as one of the primary influences on Hegel's, and therefore Marx's, dialectical form.  In particular, he called ''De Divisione Naturae'' a prototype of Hegel's ''Phenomenology of Spirit''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = L | last = Kołakowski | title = Main Currents of Marxism | year = 1976 | volume = 1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
==Joke==
[[William of Malmesbury]]'s humorous anecdote illustrates both the character of Eriugena and the position he occupied at the French court. The king having asked, ''Quid distat inter sottum et Scottum?'' (What separates a sot [drunkard] from an Irishman?), Eriugena replied, ''Tabula tantum'' (''Only a Table'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=William of Malmesbury|authorlink=William of Malmesbury|title=Gesta pontificum Anglorum|chapter=Book 5}}Quoted in [[Helen Waddell]], ''[[The Wandering Scholars]]'' (Garden City: Doubleday, 1955), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

William of Malmesbury is not considered a reliable source on John Scotus Eriugena by modern scholars. For example, his reports that Eriugena is buried at Malmesbury  is doubted by scholars  who say that William confused John Eriugena with a different monk named John. William’s report on the manner of Eriugena’s death, killed by the pens of his students, also appears to be a legend. “It seems certain that this is due to confusion with another John and that the manner of John’s death is borrowed from the Acts of St. [[Cassian of Imola]]. Feast: (at Malmesbury), 28 January.”&lt;ref&gt;‘John the Sage, mentioned in R.P.S. (11th century) as resting at Malmesbury with Maedub and Aldhelm. He should probably be identified with the John whose tomb William of Malmesbury described and whose epitaph he transcribed. He believed that this was John Scotus Eriugena, the Irish philosopher of the 9th century, and that he was killed by the pens of his students after settling at Malmesbury. It seems certain that this is due to confusion with another John and that the manner of John’s death is borrowed from the Acts of St. Cassian of Imola. Feast: (at Malmesbury), 28 January .’ “John the Sage” The Oxford Dictionary of Saints. David Hugh Farmer. Oxford University Press 2003. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press. University of Oxford. 12 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pyhiinvaeltaja.wordpress.com/2010/02/10/st-john-of-malmesbury/ St John of Malmesbury?]. wordpress.com (2010-02-10)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;”Today (28 January) we commemorate St John ‘the Wise’ of Malmesbury (8th century). Or do we? There do seem to be several confusions and misattributions in this story, which was a good research exercise rather than particularly enlightening. Two sources were useful, Farmer and the Victoria County History: ‘At this time, about 870, according to the tradition recorded by William of Malmesbury, (fn. 59) John Scotus Erigena, the philosopher, at the instigation of King Alfred took up his residence at the abbey as a fugitive from the Continent; after some years he was murdered by his pupils. He was buried first in St. Laurence’s Church, but the body preternatural portents. The terms of the epitaph as given by William imply that the dead scholar was regarded as a martyr; and it seems clear that he bases the story on an old tradition and a tomb bearing an epitaph of a ‘John the Wise’ who is termed saint and martyr. (fn. 60) This John, however, almost certainly cannot have been the famous philosopher; he may possibly have been John the Old Saxon whose unfortunate régime at Athelney (Som.) nearly ended in murder. (fn. 61) John the Old Saxon escaped from Athelney, but when and how he died we do not know; it is possible that he is to be identified with the John the Wise of Malmesbury.’” From: [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=36532 ‘House of Benedictine monks: Abbey of Malmesbury’], A History of the County of Wiltshire: Volume 3 (1956), pp. 210-231.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[William wrote] ‘that John quitted Francia because of the charge of erroneous doctrine brought against him. He came to King Alfred, by whom he was welcomed and established as a teacher at Malmesbury, but after some years he was assailed by the boys, was later translated to the left of the high altar of the abbey church, chiefly as the result of whom he taught, with their styles, and so died. It never occurred to any one to identify the Old Saxon abbat of Athelney with the Irish teacher of Malmesbury—with the name John as the single point in common—until the late forger, who passed off his work as that of Ingulf, who was abbat of Croyland towards the end of the eleventh century (‘Descr. Comp.’ in Rer. Angl. Script. post Bedam, p. 870, Frankfurt, 1601); and the confusion has survived the exposure of the fraud. It is permissible to hold that William has handed down a genuine tradition of his monastery, though it would be extreme to accept all the details of what happened more than two centuries before his birth as strictly historical (see an examination of the whole question in Poole, app. ii.).’ ''Dictionary of National Biography'', 1885-1900, Volume 51 Scotus by Reginald Lane-Poole.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jumblies Theatre''' is a Canadian [[community art|Community Arts]] [[Theatre]] Company with the overall concept of [[social]] [[inclusion (value and practice)|inclusion]].

==Origins==
{{peacock|date=June 2016}}
'''Jumblies Theatre''' was founded in 2001 by its [[Artistic Director]], [[Ruth Howard (artist)|Ruth Howard]]. Ruth’s work is inspired by various artistic traditions, including the British [[community theatre|Community Play]] form, pioneered by the Colway Theatre Trust, and brought to [[Canada]] in the 1990s by Dale Hamilton.

In bringing the [[community theatre|community play]] form to [[Toronto]],  [[Ruth Howard (artist)|Ruth Howard]] and '''Jumblies Theatre''', adapted it  to reflect her evolving artistic interests and Toronto’s  [[Urban culture|urban community]] realities. The company maintains [[community art]]s’ guiding principles of inclusive [[community]] engagement, a value that ‘everyone is welcome’, and a focus on artistic quality and respect for process and product.

==Mandate==

"Jumblies makes art in everyday and unexpected places, with, for and about the people and stories found there. Our art weaves into and grows out of life’s details and rituals; our community is open-ended and based on people doing something together. We dismantle boundaries and connect disparate elements. We create fleeting utopias with lasting ripples. We say 'everyone is welcome', and grapple with the implications – aesthetic, social and practical – of meaning it." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jumblies Theatre|url=http://www.jumbliestheatre.org/|accessdate=June 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice==

Jumblies has three intertwining strands: '''Jumblies Projects''', creating new works through multi-year residencies, passing through phases of research, creation, production and legacy; '''Jumblies Studio''', training and mentoring artists and providing opportunities for professional development and hands-on learning; '''Jumblies Offshoots''', maintaining relationships with communities, artists, and past projects; '''Jumblies At Large''', collaborating with mainstream arts organizations and infiltrating community arts practice in to mainstream arts.

'''Jumblies Projects''' are typically [[artist residency|residencies]], which involve hundreds of community participants and dozens of  professional [[artist]]s from a range of disciplines and cultural traditions. [[Toronto]] residency neighbourhoods to date include [[Riverdale, Toronto|South Riverdale]], [[Lawrence Heights]], Davenport-Perth and [[Etobicoke, Ontario|Central Etobicoke]], [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]].

Jumblies makes art with, for and about people and places, forms cross-sectoral partnerships, employs diverse artists, and engages local people to create new works.

The '''Jumblies Studio''' has several components, including mentorship, consultancy, seminars and symposia, print and digital resources and Artfare Essentials, an intensive week-long course on the principles and practices of art that engages with and creates community. The Studio has delivered Artfare Essentiasl in Toronto and across Canada, including in Vancouver, Nipissing First Nation, Regina and Montreal; trained many interns; held additional professional development workshops and seminars; published two collection of essays (Out of Place); and supported and incubated new projects.

Former Jumblies Studio Interns have gone on to establish independent '''Offshoot''' organizations as legacies of Jumblies' former residencies in the Davenport West area of Toronto (Arts4All), Central Etobicoke (MABELLEarts), Scarborough (The Community Arts Guild), as well as other community arts projects and organizations in Toronto and Ontario, including Aanmitaagzi Storymakers in Nipissing First Nation, Edge of the Woods Festival (Huntsville), and Making Room Community Arts (Parkdale, Toronto).

This is a list of lists by year of '''''[[The New York Times]]'' Non-Fiction Best Sellers'''.

[[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]] was first published without fanfare on October 12, 1931.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', October 12, 1931. 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=miller&gt;{{cite book |editor=Ezra Greenspan (editor)|title=[[Book History (journal)|Book History]] |volume=Volume Three |chapter=The Best-Seller List as Marketing Tool and Historical Fiction |author=Laura J.

A national list was created April 9, 1942 in ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' (Sundays) as a supplement to the regular paper's city lists (Monday edition).&lt;ref name=miller/&gt; The national list ranked by weighting how many times the book appeared in each city list.&lt;ref name=miller/&gt; A few years later, the city lists were eliminated leaving only the national rankings, which was compiled according to "reports from leading booksellers in 22 cities," a system which remains essentially unchanged to this day (though the specifics have changed).&lt;ref name=miller/&gt;

A separate category for "Advice, How-To and Miscellaneous" books was created January 1, 1984. Its number one bestseller (''The Body Principal'' by Victoria Principal) had been number ten and number twelve on the non-fiction lists for the two preceding weeks.&lt;ref&gt;

'''''Little Birds''''' is [[Anaïs Nin]]'s second published work of [[erotic literature|erotica]], which appeared in 1979 two years after her death,&lt;ref&gt;London: W. H. Allen, 1979 {{ISBN|0491022182}}--London: Penguin, 1990 {{ISBN|0-14-014663-6}} (also in Twentieth Century Classics, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;
but was apparently written in the early 1940s when she was part of a group "writing pornography for a dollar a day."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Master of the red Martini, a review of "The Chameleon Poet: A Life of George Barker" by Robert Fraser |author=Ian Sansom |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=2002-03-02 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/mar/02/biography.highereducation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is a collection of thirteen short stories. The sexual topics covered are quite varied, ranging from [[pedophilia]] to [[lesbianism]], but linked by an interest in female subjectivity&lt;ref&gt;A. T. Salvatore ed., ''Anaïs Nin's Narratives'' (2004) p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; and in the dialectic of discourse and intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;P. Jason, ''The Critical Response to Anaïs Nin'' (1996) p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the same characters that appear in ''[[Delta of Venus]]'', her first published book of erotica, re-occur here.

==Title and themes==

The 'little birds' of the title story refer both to the actual birds used by its [[Exhibitionism|exhibitionist]] protagonist to [[Grooming (sexology)|attract]] young schoolgirls to his attic, and (metaphorically) to the girls' flight when he finally [[Indecent exposure|exposes]] himself.&lt;ref&gt;Anaïs Nin, ''Delta of Venus &amp; Little Birds'' (1996) p. 294-7&lt;/ref&gt;

In other stories, Nin calls into question the objectifying tendencies of the [[male gaze]]; both male and female complicity in [[Self-defeating personality disorder|masochism]]; and the pornographic genre itself through her subtle subversion.&lt;ref&gt;A. T. Salvatore ed., ''Anaïs Nin's Narratives'' (2004) p. x, p. 18 and p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conditions of writing==

While writing her erotica, and organising that of her fellow writers such as [[George Barker (poet)|George Barker]], Nin referred to herself jokingly as the "madam of this snobbish literary house of prostitution" for a client who examined sexual activity "to the exclusion of aspects which are the fuel that ignites it. Intellectual, imaginative, romantic, emotional."&lt;ref name="Delta_Preface"/&gt; In her 1976 preface to ''Delta of Venus'' she said "I had a feeling that Pandora's box contained the mysteries of woman's sensuality, so different from man's and for which man's language was inadequate.... Here in the erotica I was writing to entertain, under pressure from a client who wanted me to 'leave out the poetry.' I believed that my style was derived from a reading of men's works. For this reason I long felt that I had compromised my feminine self. I put the erotica aside. Rereading it these many years later, I see that my own voice was not completely suppressed. In numerous passages I was intuitively using a woman's language, seeing sexual experience from a woman's point of view. I finally decided to release the erotica for publication because it shows the beginning efforts of a woman in a world that had been the domain of men."&lt;ref name="Delta_Preface"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Anaïs Nin]] |title=[[Delta of Venus]] |chapter=Preface |date=September 1976 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5knBgSwxc |archivedate=October 25, 2009 |chapter-url=http://www.geocities.com/arsenio_grilo/a_nin_1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Susie Bright]] saw the results as forming part of a pioneering feminist erotica.&lt;ref&gt;Susie Bright ed, ''Totally Heterotica'' (1995) p. 2 and p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

The furniture of the [[Louis XV]] period (1715-1774) is characterized by curved forms, lightness, comfort and asymmetry; it replaced the more formal, boxlike  and massive furniture of the [[Style Louis XIV]]. It employed [[marquetry]], using inlays of exotic woods of different colors, as well as ivory and mother of pearl.

The style had three distinct periods. During the early years (1715-1730), called the Regency, when the King was too young to rule, furniture followed the massive, geometric Style Louis XIV style.  From 1730 until about 1750, the period known as the first style, it was much more asymmetrical, ornate and exuberant, in the fashion called ''[[rocaille]]''.  From about 1750 to the King's death in 1774, a reaction set in against the excesses of the rocaille.  The Second Style of Louis XV showed the influences of [[neo-classicism]], based on recent archeological discoveries in Italy and Greece. it featured Roman and Greek motifs.  The later furniture false eatured decorative elements of [[Chinoiserie]] and other exotic styles.&lt;ref&gt;Duchet, Robert, ''Caractéristique des Styles'' (1988), pp. 136-37&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis XV furniture was designed not for the vast palace state rooms of the Versailles of Louis XIV, but for the smaller, more intimate salons created by Louis XV and by his mistresses, [[Madame de Pompadour]] and [[Madame DuBarry]].  It included several new types of furniture, including the commode and the chiffonier, and many pieces,  particularly chairs and tables, were designed to be moved easily rearranged or moved from room to room, depending upon the kind of function.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé, ''Les Styles de l'architecture et du mobilier'', pp. 63-73&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==History==
With the death of Louis XIV on 1 September 1715, his grandson, Louis XV, born in 1710, became King.  Because of his young age, France was ruled by a Regent, [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|Philippe of Orleans]], until 1723.  During this period, the style of furniture changed little from the Louis XIV period; it was massive, lavishly decorated and solemn, designed for the gigantic state halls of the new [[Palace of Versailles]].  In 1722 Louis XV moved from Paris, where he had lived with the Regent, to Versailles, began his own rule, and gradually imposed his own taste on the arts, architecture, and furniture.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé, pp. 63-67&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis left the exterior of Versailles and the other palaces largely unchanged, but beginning in 1738 he extensively redesigned the interiors, creating the ''petits apartments'', or smaller apartments and salons for himself, the Queen, [[Marie Leczinska]], whom he married in 1725, and later, for his primary mistresses, [[Madame Pompadour]] and [[Madame du Barry]]. In these salons the traditional etiquette and formality of Louis XIV was abandoned.  These new suites of smaller rooms were furnished in a new style that  met the needs of comfort, intimacy and elegance.  Beginning in about 1730, His preference was for the style called ''[[rocaille]]'', a term which referred to an ornamental decoration resembling a stylized seashell, a style which expressed gaiety and fantasy. The ornament appeared rarely on the exteriors of the new buildings, but lavishly in the interiors, on the walls, ceilings, and furniture.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé, pp. 63-67&lt;/ref&gt; The architects [[Robert de Cotte]] and [[Ange-Jacques Gabriel]] remade the interiors of the [[Palace of Versailles]], the [[Palace of Fontainebleau]], and the [[Château de Compiègne]] in the new style.&lt;ref&gt;Wiegandt, ''Le Mobilier Français- Régence Louis XV'', pg. 9-13&lt;/ref&gt;

Palatial residences with rocaille interiors soon appeared In Paris.  They included the [[Hôtel Soubise]] in Paris, (now the National Archives) in 1705; the [[Hôtel Matignon]] (now the residence of the French Prime Minister) in 1721, by Jean Courtonne; and the Hôtel Biron (now the [[Musée Rodin]]) by Gabriel and [[Jean Aubert the Elder]].  They also appeared in the French provinces, the royal residence by  [[Emmanuel Héré]] in [[Nancy France|Nancy]], and  also in [[Aix-en-Provence]] and [[Bordeaux]]. All of these buildings featured rooms arranged in the new style;  the bedrooms took on new importance, and were surrounded by smaller anterooms and cabinets, including an entirely new kind of room, the dining-room. All of them needed new furniture to match the new style and arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;Wiegandt, pg. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

For a quarter of a century, the furniture designs of the ''rocaille'' style was dominant, particularly under the influence of  [[Juste-Aurèle Meissonier]] (1695-1750), the Italian-born architect who became royal architect and designer of Louis XV, and the ornament designer [[Nicolas Pineau]] (1684-1754). Under their influence, straight lines disappeared, replaced by curves, ornaments lost all symmetry, and garlands of flowers appeared everywhere. Designs inspired by Chinese art and other exotic sources appeared in profusion, though the ''rocaille'' style never reached the excess of exuberance of the [[rococo]] style that appeared in Italy, Austria and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Wiegandt, pg. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1740s, the style began to slowly change;  decoration became less extravagant and more discreet.  In 1754 the brother of Madame de Pompadour, the Marquis de Marigny, accompanied the designer [[Nicolas Cochin]] and a delegation of artists and scholars to Italy to see the recent discoveries at [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]], and made a grand tour of other classical monuments.  They returned full of enthusiasm for a new classical style, based on the Roman and Greek monuments.  In 1754 they published a manifesto against the Rocaille style, calling for a return to classicism. Marigny, after the death of Louis XV, later became director of buildings for Louis XVI.&lt;ref&gt;Wiegandt, pg. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

Betwewen 1755 and 1760, the forms of furniture and interior decoration began to change into what became known as the Second Style Louis XV, or the ''Style Transition''.  The ''rocaille'' decoration remained, but became more discreet and restrained. Secondly, the new wave of enthusiasm for ancient Greece and Rome brought a series of new decorative themes, though the lines of the furniture were not much changed. This marked the beginning of what became French neoclassicism or [[Style Louis XVI]]. {{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=146}}

==Designers==
The earliest furniture designers under Louis XV during the Regency included [[Claude III Audran]], who had been responsible for furniture design under Louis XIV; [[Pierre Lepautre (1652–1716)|Pierre Lepautre]], who in 1699 became chief designer for Louis XIV, and  [[Gilles-Marie Oppenordt]], born in Holland, who became the furniture designer for the Regent.  Opponordt's designs in 1714 for the decor of the Hotel de Pomponne on Place des Victoires, featuring curving S and C forms, helped introduce the new style to Parisians.  Another important figure in introducing the new style was the painter [[Watteau]], a former pupil of Audran, who, besides his famous paintings, made arabesque designs for the woodwork of the new chateau of La Muette. ''{{Sfn|De Morant|1970|355}}

In the 1730s, notable designers included the sculptor and architect [[Nicolas Pineau]] and the jeweler [[Juste-Aurèle Meissonnier]];  their work featured a greater amount of asymmetry, floral design twisting elements and counter-curves.  In 1736 the carver and jewelry sculptor Jean Mondon published ''Premier Livre de form rocquaille et carte'', the first book specifically on the style, and was among the first to include elements of [[Chinoiserie]], notably dragons, a phoenix, and other figures. Engravings of their designs for furniture, woodwork and other decoration circulated widely throughout Europe, making the rocaille style a model for artists and craftsmen in other counties to follow. {{Sfn|De Morant|1970|355}}

==Craftsmen==
[[File:Commode MET DP105702.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Estampille'' or signature mark under top of table by [[Bernard II van Risamburgh]]]]
Louis XV furniture was created by the collaboration of complex network of designers and craftsmen.   The ''Menuisier'', made the wooden framework of the furniture, which was held together by its structure and wooden ''chevilles'' or dowels; the use of nails or glue was forbidden. The ''Ebenist'' then covered the frame and native woods with thin pieces of exotic woods, called [[marquetry]].  In the reign of Louis XIV  ebony was most often used for this covering, but,  beginning in 1675-80,  more exotic and colorful woods were used, which could give more picturesque effects.  This were sometimes placed in cubic designs, or checkerboards, or representing arabesques, floral patterns, trophies, or picturesque scenes.   Originally the plaques were about a centimeter thick, but by the end of the period plaques were only slightly more than two millimeters thick.{{sfn|Wiegandt|2005|page=22-25}}  Then the furniture was completed by the ''bronziers'', who made the handles and knobs;  the ''doreurs'' who gilded them; the ''fondeurs'', who made metalwork; the ''chiselers'' or wood sculptors, who made the decorate details, legs, and other carvings; the ''laqueurs''and ''vernisseurs'', who applied multiple coats of [[lacquer]] or [[varnish]]. {{sfn|De Morant|1970|page=379}}

After 1751 each work was signed by the master craftsman who oversaw the work.  This mark, called the ''Estampille'', used a heated iron to mark the piece with the initials of the master.  It was usually placed on the back of the rear traverse of chairs, under the marble of commodes and ''secretaries'', and under the surrounding ''ceinture'' of tables.  marks are often missing, either forgotten by the craftsman, or defaced.  Given the high value of signed pieces by famous craftsmen, Counterfeit ''Estampilles'' are not unknown.{{sfn|Wiegandt|2005|page=22-25}}

==Chairs and sofas==
Between 1769 and 1775, the furniture designer [[André Jacob Roubo]] published a series of books of engravings called ''L'Art du menusier'', detailing the categories and styles.  He divided the chairs into two categories;  those with a straight back, called ''á la Reine'', and those with a rounded back, called ''en cabriolet''. {{Sfn|Wiegandt|2005|page=54}}   The chairs ''en cabriolet'' were usually lighter, often had cane seats and backs, and could be moved around easily.   included some new styles, notably the ''voyeuse'' a small chair with an armrest on the back, so the person seated could either face forward or turn around and sit astride the chair with his arms on the back of the chair.   {{Sfn|De Morant|1970|page=380}}

The ''fauteuils'', or armchairs, were larger and designed for comfort; their styles evolved during the reign of Louis XV.  During the early years of the Regency (1715-23) the armchairs had short curved feet, the top of the back was slightly curved, while the supports of the back and the arms were straight.  The armchairs of the middle Louis XV period (1723-1750) were smaller than those of the Louis XIV period, but more comfortable. The legs were more curved, the top of the back was rounded, and often had a small ornamental design.  The back of the chair took on a more graceful violin form. This form became known as the ''Chaise a la Reine'', or "Chair of the Queen." {{Sfn|De Morant|1970|page=380}}

A variety of other new forms appeared, designed especially for comfort.  The ''Bergere'' had a low seat with an additional cushion, and  sometimes added padded wings atop the arms on either side of the back which protected the head against drafts, which also made it easier to take naps. Other new types that were introduced were the ''marquise'', basically an armchair expanded to seat two persons, and the ''chaise longue'', an armchair with a lengthened seat to support the legs, and the ''Duchesse'', where two chairs could be combined with an extension between. {{Sfn|De Morant|1970|page=381}}   Another new type was the ''Fauteuil de cabinet'', a type of chair designed to go with a desk, and to provide more comfort while writing.    It was usually upholstered in leather fastened with gilded nails to the frame, had rounded angles, and one leg of the chair was placed in the front, another directly behind, for greater stability.  The curved back and arms of the chair enveloped the person seated. {{Sfn|Wiegandt|2005|page=64}}

The passion for the oriental and exotic soon influenced the furniture.  A new kind of seat, ''La Sultane'' was introduced, with two places; another type called the ''Ottomane'', with the back in a form called ''en gondola'', and arms which wrapped around the oval seat, and another variety, called ''la papose'',without arms or a back;  and finally ''Le Sofa'', which featured cushions which could be moved and rearranged.{{Sfn|De Morant|1970|page=381}}

The last phase of the Louis XV style, the gradual transition toward the neoclassical, had a limited effect on chairs.  The basic forms remained, but the decoration increasingly took the form of garlands of flowers called ''a l'ántique'' in a repetitive rhythm, which opposed the sinuous form of the carved legs and frame.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=146}}

==Consoles and tables==
The ''Table en console'' or [[Console table]], was designed to be placed against a wall, often in front of mirror, and held statuettes or porcelain objects.   It was among the most lavishly decorated pieces of furniture of the early Louis XV period.  It was usually made of oak, carved and gilded,  and drenched with   ''rocaille'' decoration, usually in the form of seashells and foliage. The and legs in the form of an exaggerated S or a reverse S.  The supporting frame under the table was also highly decorated, sometimes holding porcelain objects, and sculpted figures of dragons or other mythical animals.  The face of the table often had rocaille masks. a g rocaille modeled after seashells and foliage.  They usually had a plaque of colored marble on top. {{Sfn|Wiegandt|2005|pages=42-43}}

Another popular style of table was the ''bureau plat'', or flat desk.  It was introduced by [[André-Charles Boulle]] around 1710 in the late reign of Louis XIV, as a replacement for the desk mounted atop two columns of drawes.  The early versions by Boulle were made of ebony and dark wood, and had eight legs, and six drawers, which were decorated with gilded bronze handles. The slightly curved legs ending in gilded ornaments in the shape of deer's feet. Gilded bronze ''espagnolettes''  decorated the corners and legs.  Later in the period, the flat desks featured an abundance of marquetry; they were made of oak or spain, were embedded with thin plaques of exotic woods of contrasting colors.   Another celebrated creator of tables was [[Charles Cressent]], who carried on the refined and harmonious ornamental style of Boulle. {{Sfn|Wiegandt|2005|pages=42-50}}

A number of small, specialized and portable tables appeared around of after 1755, some of them designed for Madame de Pomapdour.  These included the ''table de chevet'', a very small utility table  made of oak and inlaid with rosewood and other precious woods, which could be put in the closet when not needed; the ''Table d'en-cas'', or "Just in case" table, a small piece with two drawers, small cupboard with a grilled door,  and a marble top;  the ''Chiffonière'', a small table with gracefully curving legs and a porcelain top. Another small table was the ''cabaret'' or ''á café'' table,  with a small marble top and long legs, on which  coffee or drinks could be served. The version introduced in 1770 featured geometric designs and a neoclassical frieze around the plateau. {{Sfn|Wiegandt|2005|pages=90-91}}

Another popular type of small table was the ''Table de toilette'', or dressing table.  One particular variety, ''en coeur'', or heart-shaped, was especially designed for men; it stood on three legs mounted on rollers, contained an assortment of drawers and small compartments, and featured a folding mirror on top. {{Sfn|Wiegandt|2005|pages=92}}

In the late, second style of Louis XV, after 1750,  the tables lost the rococo curves and took on classical (or imagined classical) details, including table legs in the form of Doric columns; griffon paws and lion paws on the feet;,  trophies of arms, friezes, and figures of nymphs, tripods and horns of plenty, This style was termed, rather imaginatively,  ''a la Greque'', and presaged the neoclassical period to come.  {{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=138}}

==Commodes and chests==
The [[Commode]] (whose name means "convenient") was invented under Louis XIV to replace the ''coffre'', or large chest. It was  heavy and boxlike, with short legs, and abundant decoration of gilded bronze. During the Regency and early style of Louis XV, particularly in the commodes of [[Charles Cressent]], commodes became more graceful, with longer S-shaped legs and ''espagnolettes'', or stylized female torsos, on the corners above the legs.  The fronts of commodes became more rounded in form.  Gilded bronze vines curled and wound across the facade. Bronze ornaments in the form of masks were replaced by faces of smiling women,  palmettes, and, later in the period, a new theme, s stylized bat wing. The seashell was a common central element of the rocaille decoration, often combined with acanthus leaves.  Handles of drawers were shaped like intertwined flowers.  Sculpted images of various animals also appeared near the end of the early period. {{Sfn|Renault and Lazé|(2006)|pages=63-65}}

A large number of skilled ''[[ébéniste]]s'' from around Europe were employed to make fine wood Commodes and other furniture for the new apartments built by Louis XV at Versailles, Fontainebleau, and his other residences.   They included [[Jean-François Oeben]], [[Roger Vandercruse Lacroix]], [[Gilles Joubert]], [[Antoine Gaudreau]], and [[Martin Carlin]].&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988) pg. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

As the period advanced, the marquetry, or inlays of different-colored woods, became finer and more dominant. Various geometric patterns, including the checkerboard, stars, and losanges, appeared, along with bouquets of flowers made of fine marquetry. {{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=144}}  New techniques of lacquering wood were introduced, based on Chinese and Japanese techniques, which were frequently used on the front panels of commodes.   A particular variation, called the ''façon de Chine'' or "Chinese fashion" was introduced, which contrasted the gilded bronze ornament and handles against the black lacquered wood.  The designs often borrowed motifs from Chinese and Japanese art. {{Sfn|Renault and Lazé|(2006)|pages=63-65}}

Beginning in 1755-60, the reaction against the excesses of the ''rocaille'' form began.  The shapes of commodes became more boxlike, the front flat, and the legs shorter, though they retained their slight S curve. The faces of the commodes were decorated with geometric friezes of oak leaves, roses  or serpents and drapery motifs, the early manifestation of the Greco-Roman Neoclassical style.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=146}}

A new form of commode, the ''Cartonnier'', appeared in the 1760s, inspired by somewhat fantastic ideas of ancient Greek furniture. Its front was lavishly decorated with friezes, trophies of arms and lions heads, while on the top, a pedestal supported by two scrolled ''volutes'' held a group of replicas of classical Greek statues. {{Sfn|Ducher|1988|pages=146-147}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Desks==
During the reign of Louis XV, the ''bureau'' and  ''secretaire'' gradually evolved into the form of the modern desk, along with a wide variety of more elaborate variations.   At the beginning the 18th century, [[André Charles Boulle]] and [[Charles Cressent]] had created the ''bureau au plat''. a writing table with columns of drawers, graceful curving legs, gilded bronze decoration, and fine marquetry in geometric forms.  Jacques Dubois made a series of celebrated desks in this fashion the 1740s.

Around 1750, a new variety appeared, called the ''Secretaire à capuchin'' or ''à la Bourgone'', which contained a section of drawers which could be raised up, while the top folded out into a writing surface. In addition to the drawers, it contained a number of secret compartments concealed within. Numerous other variants appeared soon afterwards;  the ''Secrétaire en pent'', or sloping desk first appeared in about 1735. It was a small cabinet with a sloping front which opened out into a writing surface.  It was also called ''en dos d'âne'', or "style of donkey's back".   Madame de Pompadour possessed one of these, made between 1748–52, with a varnish of red and a blue in the Chinese style, which combined ''rocaille'' and exoticism.  [[Mathieu Criaerd]] made a secretary in this style in about 1750, with marquetry of violette, amarante, satin wood and gided bronze. {{Sfn|Wiegandt|2005|pages=85-88}}

A much simpler variety, the ''pupitre à écrire debut'', of pulpit for writing while standing, arrived at about the same time.  The finest models were usually made of oak and fir, covered with marquetry of rose wood, satin wood, and amaranth.  They had small wheels to be moved around easily, had a locked compartment under the sloping top surface, and shelves below for large documents. {{Sfn|Wiegandt|2005|pages=85-88}}

The ''Secretaire en armoire'' was a larger and more vertical variation, based on the form of an armoire; it was a large chest with a writing surface that folded down and drawers and shelves inside. It was designed to stand against a wall, and appeared in about 1750.  It often featured a marquetry in a geometric pattern resembling cubes of dark and light wood, a design vey popular in the last years of the Louis XV period.

The ''Bonheur-du-jour'' was a small desk with cabinet which appeared in about 1760.  Following the new style of the late Louis XV period, it had no gilded bronze.  It featured graceful curbed legs, but the top part was geometric, with delicate inlays of marquetry flowers.

The most celebrated new type of desk invented under Louis XV was the ''Bureau à cylindre'' or rolltop desk, which appeared in about 1760. The master of this form was [[Jean-François Oeben]].   It had no gilded bronze other than a delicate frieze around the top,;  very fine marquetry of flowers, and an interior with secret compartments. Many variants were made, including the [[Bureau du Roi|desk of Louis XV]] now on display at Versailles.{{Sfn|Wiegandt|2005|pages=85-88}}

==Beds==
Under Louis XV the bedroom  was a place of ceremony; the formal awakening of the King in his bed chamber (even if he had actually slept elsewhere) was a formal  event, attended by members of the Court and visitors to the Palace.  The form of the bed and its covering evolved under Louis XV. Early beds had four posts and a canopy suspended from a rectangual form on top.  Under Louis XV, the ''Lit a la polonaise'' appeared, with a  canopy suspended from a  crownlike structure;  and the ''Lit à la Duchesse'', where the canopy was supported only from one end.  The bed was usually separated from the rest of the room by a balustrade,  and stools were arranged outside the balustrade for the Court to witness the formal awakening.

The famous  [[Encyclopédie]] of [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] (1751–72) included images of beds ''a la Polonaise'', and ''a la Turque'' (a more ornate and exotic version of the Duchesse) and a bed placed into an alcove.  (Volume 8, pg. 216).

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Transition From Rocaille to neo-classicism==
Later in the reign of Louis XV, between 1755 and 1760, tastes in furniture began to change. The ''rocaille'' designs began more discreet and restrained, and the influence of antiquity and neo-classicism began to appear in new designs of furniture.  The Commodes became to have more geometric forms;  the decoration turned from rocaille to geometric forms, garlands of oak leaves, flowers and classical motifs.  The legs gradually changed from s-curves to straight, often modeled after Greek or roman columns, tapering to a point.  Common decorations included stylized pine cones, and knotted ribbons. A new type of tall cabinet, the ''Cartonnier'', made its appearance between 1760 and 1765.  It took its inspiration from Greek mythology and architecture, with friezes, vaulting, sculpted trophies, bronze lion heads,  and other classic, elements.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988) pg. 146-47&lt;/ref&gt;

The ebenists [[Jean-Henri Riesener]],  [[Jean-François Leleu]], [[Martin Carlin]] and [[David Roentgen]]  and menuisier  [[Georges Jacob]] were among the most important creators of the late Louis XV transition style. Their careers continued and reached their peak during the following reign of Louis XVI.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2507">'''Margareta Birgersdotter Grip''' (1538–1586), was a Swedish baroness, writer and landowner. She is known for her writing: she copied letters and documents from the Middle Ages, the originals of which have since been lost, and for her genealogical research. Genealogical works became common among the nobility after her day, and her work is considered the first of the genre in Sweden.

==Life==
She was born to ''[[riksråd]]'' baron Birger Nilsson Grip and Brita Joachimsdotter Brahe. In 1562, she married the noble Erik Månsson [[Natt och Dag]], son of Måns Johansson and [[Barbro Eriksdotter]]. She was thereby the sister-in-law of the lady-in-waiting [[Karin Gyllenstierna]], who were also her neighbor on the estate [[Säby]]. After being widowed shortly after, she managed the estate [[Brokind Castle]] on behalf of her minor son Erik Eriksson Natt och Dag (d. 1566). After the death of her son, she inherited the Bro estate personally. In 1571, she married riksråd [[Sten Axelsson Banér]]. However, she remained the sole manager of the Bro estate.

Traditionally, Margareta Birgersdotter Grip has been named [[Mistress of the Robes]] of Queen [[Karin Månsdotter]] in 1567-1568. However, [[Elin Andersdotter]] is confirmed to have had that position.&lt;ref&gt;Sture Arnell (1951). Karin Månsdotter. Stockholm: Wahlström &amp; Widstrand. ISBN&lt;/ref&gt;

Margareta Grip copied a large amount of documents and letters from the Middle Ages, whose originals have since been lost, and who are therefore important historical documents. She produced a genealogical work, with the intent of vindicating her ancestor, [[Bo Jonsson Grip]], a work she started in 1574. Genealogical research became common among the nobility in the late 16th century, but Grip are regarded as the pioneer of this genre in Sweden. Her work is kept at the [[Trolleholm Castle]] archive.

The '''Mesri mosque''' is a historical [[mosque]] in [[Isfahan]], [[Iran]]. The mosque was built in 1650 in the [[Safavid]] era. There is an [[inscription]] in its [[mihrab]], written by the famous [[calligrapher]] [[Mohammad Reza Emami]] in [[Nastaliq]] script.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arianica.com/%D9%85%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AA/%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%AC%D8%AF-%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%B1%DB%8C-%D8%A7%D8%B5%D9%81%D9%87%D8%A7%D9%86&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''No Cars Go'''" is a song by [[Canada|Canadian]] [[indie rock]] band [[Arcade Fire]]. It is the fourth [[single (music)|single]] released from the band's second full-length album, ''[[Neon Bible]]''. The release date was due to be July 23, 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/arcade-fire/28881 |title=Arcade Fire announce biggest ever UK shows &amp;#124; News |publisher=Nme.com |date=2007-06-11 |accessdate=2012-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the release was delayed to August 6, 2007.

==Overview==
The song title is taken from the solo project of former [[Arcade Fire]] member [[Brendan Reed]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nocarsgo.org NoCarsGo.Org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090925045447/http://www.nocarsgo.org/ |date=2009-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It first appeared on the band's self-released debut EP ''[[Arcade Fire (EP)|Arcade Fire]]'' and was re-recorded for ''[[Neon Bible]]''.

Some pressings of the single list the B-side as "Surf City Eastern Block" and some list it as "Surf City [[Eastern Bloc]]".

==Appearances==
The song was featured in [[Eric Bana]]'s 2009 documentary film ''[[Love The Beast]]''.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} It is also featured in [[Mike Mo Capaldi]]'s part in ''[[Fully Flared]]'', a skateboarding video released by [[Lakai Limited Footwear]] in 2007.

In the UK, the song was also featured in ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'''s video montage/preview at the beginning of Series Ten,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.finalgear.com/top-gear-episode-songs-season-10/10x01-october-7th-2007-a-21971/ |title=[10x01&amp;#93; October 7th, 2007 |publisher=Forums.finalgear.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in ITV's coverage of the [[UEFA Champions League]] in 2007/8. It has also featured on series 6 of ''[[Wheeler Dealers]]'', a motoring programme on the [[Discovery Channel (UK TV channel)|Discovery Channel]]. In Italy it was used as the main theme of the soccer's Sunday TV-show "Quelli Che Il Calcio" hosted by [[Victoria Cabello]], from September 18, 2011 to May 19, 2013 on [[Rai 2]].

The song was jokingly referred to by [[Win Butler]] as "Yes Boats Yes" during their gig at the [[Hackney Empire]] on July 7, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Andy Gill |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/arcade-fire-hackney-empire-london-2022102.html |title=Arcade Fire, Hackney Empire, London - Reviews - Music |publisher=The Independent |date=2010-07-09 |accessdate=2012-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
"No Cars Go" was used by [[Fox Sports (USA)|Fox Sports]] in a post-halftime montage that aired during its coverage of [[Super Bowl XLII]], and for similar segments in other ''[[NFL on Fox]]'' broadcasts throughout the [[2007 NFL season|2007 season]]. Following the Super Bowl broadcast, the band said it would consider legal action against [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], claiming that the network did not seek permission to use the song.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/a88629/arcade-fire-consider-fox-legal-action.html Digital Spy: Arcade Fire consider FOX legal action]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pantazi Ghica''' ({{IPA-ro|panˈtazi ˈɡika}}; also known under the [[pen name]]s '''Tapazin''', '''G. Pantazi''', and '''Ghaki''';&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.390, 515&lt;/ref&gt; 15 March 1831 – 17 July 1882) was a [[Wallachia]]n, later Romanian politician and lawyer, also known as a dramatist, poet, short story writer, and literary critic. A prominent representative of the [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|liberal current]], he was the younger brother and lifelong collaborator of [[Ion Ghica]], who served as [[List of Prime Ministers of Romania|Prime Minister]] of the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian Kingdom]] in 1866-1867 and again in 1870-1871. Pantazi Ghica began his political career as a participant in the [[Wallachian Revolution of 1848]], a collaborator of the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] historian and activist [[Nicolae Bălcescu]], and a member of the [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] grouping headed by [[C. A. Rosetti]]. Although twice involved in the administration of [[Buzău County]], Ghica lived much of his life in exile or in [[Bucharest]], and was also a soldier for the [[Ottoman Empire]] during the [[Crimean War]]. After 1875, he was a prominent member of the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]].

Generally seen as a mediocre writer, he was foremost noted for his associations with the literary figures [[Nicolae Filimon]], [[Vasile Alecsandri]], [[Dimitrie Bolintineanu]], [[Alexandru Odobescu]] and [[Alexandru Macedonski]], as well as for his extended polemic with the [[Conservatism|conservative]] literary society ''[[Junimea]]''. Ghica's work and political convictions were criticized and often ridiculed by ''Junimist'' intellectuals such as [[Titu Maiorescu]], [[Mihai Eminescu]], and [[Ion Luca Caragiale]]. He is most likely one of the unnamed liberal politicians who are negatively portrayed in Eminescu's poem ''[[Scrisoarea a III-a]]''.

Pantazi Ghica suffered from [[kyphosis]]. Notably, this physical defect is mentioned for [[Satire|satirical]] effect in Eminescu's poem and in Caragiale's autobiographical work, ''[[Din carnetul unui vechi sufleur]]''.

==Biography==

===Early life and revolutionary activities===
Pantazi was born into the [[Ghica family]], a prestigious group of [[Phanariotes|Phanariote]] ''[[hospodars]]'' and [[boyar]]s in the [[Danubian Principalities]], whose origins were [[Greeks of Romania|Greek]] and [[Albanians of Romania|Albanian]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Neagu Djuvara]], ''Între Orient şi Occident. Ţările române la începutul epocii moderne'', [[Humanitas publishing house|Humanitas]], Bucharest, 1995, p.90-91. {{ISBN|973-28-0523-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the twelfth of fifteen children born to ''[[Ban (title)|Ban]]'' Dimitrie Ghica and his wife Maria Câmpineanu (a boyaress of the [[Câmpineanu family]]).&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.381, 386&lt;/ref&gt; Ion, Pantazi, Temistocle and Maria Ghica were the only four children to survive into adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.381&lt;/ref&gt;

Like his siblings, Pantazi Ghica studied at the [[Saint Sava College]] in Wallachia's capital.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.386&lt;/ref&gt; It was around that time that he befriended the poet Bolintineanu, who was twelve years his senior and by then already a friend of Ion Ghica.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.229&lt;/ref&gt; His mother later took him to France, where he is known to have been enlisted in a [[boarding house]].&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.387"&gt;Călinescu, p.387&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his return to Wallachia in 1847, together with his brother, Ghica was involved in the agitation leading up to the 1848 uprising, and became Bălcescu's secretary.&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.387"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pippididilema"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Andrei Pippidi]], [http://www.dilemaveche.ro/sectiune/ieri-cu-vedere-spre-azi/articol/acasa-la-pantazi-ghica "Acasă la Pantazi Ghica"], in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Nr. 164, March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Before the revolution toppled [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Prince]] [[Gheorghe Bibescu]] and created a new administration, Bălcescu sent Pantazi Ghica as an agitator, in service to the revolutionary organization ''Frăţia''.&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.387"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pippididilema"/&gt; Ghica was assigned the task of spreading [[propaganda]] in the [[Counties of Romania|counties]] of Buzău and [[Prahova County|Prahova]].&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.387"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pippididilema"/&gt; A common [[Russian Empire|Russian]]-[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] intervention quelled the rebellion in autumn of the same year, to reestablish the ''[[Regulamentul Organic]]'' government. Both Ghica brothers, like most other revolutionaries, were arrested and exiled from Wallachia.&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.387"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pippididilema"/&gt;

===Exile===
[[File:Alecsandri and Ghica in Istanbul, 1855.jpeg|thumb|200px|[[Ion Ghica]] (seated) and [[Vasile Alecsandri]], photographed in [[Istanbul]] (1855)]]
The younger Ghica again settled in Paris, were his mother Maria was still residing.&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.387"/&gt; Following her death, he moved to [[Istanbul]], joining his brother Ion (who was soon after offered protection by [[Ottoman Dynasty|Sultan]] [[Abdülmecid I]]).&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.387"/&gt; Again in Paris by 1849, he became close friends with a group of Wallachian revolutionaries in exile, including D. Berindey, the physician Iatropolu, Alexandru Zissu and [[George Creţeanu]]; the five exiles signed a [[blood brother]]hood pact.&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.387"/&gt;

Ghica attended [[upper class|high society]] meetings, and befriended a [[tenor]] at the [[Opéra National de Paris]].&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.387"/&gt; He later claimed to have maintained close contacts with famous Parisian literary figures such as [[Alexandre Dumas, père|Alexandre Dumas]] and [[Alfred de Musset]], and to have introduced them to [[Culture of Romania|Romanian culture]]—this was to be disputed by his Romanian adversaries, who noted that the account provided inaccurate details.&lt;ref name="odobescu"&gt;[[Alexandru Odobescu]], ''Scene istorice. Pseudo-cynegetikos'', [[Editura Minerva]], Bucharest, 1984, p.241-242. {{OCLC|13700632}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, he also associated with literary critic [[Jean-Baptiste Alphonse Karr]], composers [[Daniel Auber]] and [[Fromental Halévy]], and playwright [[Eugène Scribe]].&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.387"/&gt; He probably studied for a while at the [[University of Paris]]' Law Faculty, but it is unclear whether he ever completed his education.&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.387"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pippididilema"/&gt; His detractors later claimed that Pantazi Ghica had spent more time in the [[debtors' prison]] than among students, while Ion Ghica is known to have objected to his brother's lifestyle and to have asked Bălcescu to supervise him.&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.387"/&gt;

Around 1850, he fell in love with Camila de Fernex, who was related to the family of his French host, Aimé Guyet de Fernex.&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.387"/&gt; They were married in March 1852, when the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] Camila obtained a [[matrimonial dispensation]] from [[Marie-Dominique-Auguste Sibour]], the [[Archbishop of Paris]]. Records of the events show that the matter of his marriage was only settled at the end of a long debate: the [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]] Ghica had initially consented to have his children baptized Catholic, and then retracted his statement, leaving Archbishop Sibour to consent after obtaining a less compelling verbal agreement from him.&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.387"/&gt; The wedding ceremony took place at a [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] church in [[Marseille]].&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.387"/&gt;

The brothers Ghica returned to Bucharest separately during the late 1850s. Their arrival coincided with the outbreak of the [[Crimean War]]: Pantazi Ghica joined the [[Military of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Army]], serving as a ''[[Lieutenant|Yüzbaşı]]'' in the [[Cossacks in Turkey|Cossack Corps]] (part of the Imperial Guard).&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.387"/&gt; Decorated and promoted,&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.387"/&gt; he was again present in Bucharest as Russia was defeated and the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]] allowed Wallachia to decide a new administration.&lt;ref name="pippididilema"/&gt; Ion Ghica, who was promoted ''[[Bey]]'' of [[Samos Island]] in 1854, unsuccessfully applied for the office of Wallachian Prince during 1858, and later rose to ministerial offices.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.383&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prosecutor, lawyer and journalist===
[[File:Garda Oraseneasca in 1866 BAR ILR 493.jpeg|thumb|240px|Members of the Citizens' Guard in [[Bucharest]], 1866]]
In 1856-1858, he was a [[prosecutor]] in [[Dâmboviţa County]], before starting a private practice as a lawyer on Bucharest's [[Calea Victoriei|Podul Mogoşoaiei]].&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.387"/&gt; Pantazi Ghica subsequently became one of the main liberal activists, and rallied with its most [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] wing, that headed by Rosetti.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.85, 347&lt;/ref&gt; This came at a time when Wallachia's united with [[Moldavia]] under the rule of [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]] (proclaimed in 1859, and effected in 1862). Following Cuza's election in both countries, Ghica joined the [[civil service]]: he first replaced his friend George Creţeanu as inspector in the [[Ministry of Justice (Romania)|Ministry of Justice]] (April–September 1859) and department head in the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Romania)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] (before 1860).&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.387"/&gt; He returned to his practice, and, in 1861, was a legal representative for people arrested during the anti-unionist riots in [[Craiova]].&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.391"&gt;Călinescu, p.391&lt;/ref&gt; In 1862, he was appointed attorney for the [[Ministry of Education, Research and Youth (Romania)|Ministry of Education]].&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.387"/&gt;

In 1859, Pantazi Ghica joined [[Dimitrie Bolintineanu]] in editing the journal ''Dâmboviţa'', but, just a year later, his articles were the subject of a scandal, and he was arrested for allegedly breaking the [[Journalism ethics and standards|ethics of journalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.341, 387, 388&lt;/ref&gt; He shared a cell with his colleague, [[N. T. Orăşanu]], a noted adversary of Carol's rule.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.341&lt;/ref&gt; He was also an associate of the writer [[Alexandru Odobescu]], and, after 1861, collaborated on his monthly [[literary magazine]] ''Revista Română''.&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.I, p.99-100"&gt;Vianu, Vol.I, p.99-100&lt;/ref&gt; It was here that he published a critical review of ''[[Ciocoii vechi şi noi]]'', a novel by his friend [[Nicolae Filimon]], which upset the latter (as a consequence, relations between the two soured).&lt;ref name="filimon"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.bmb-on-line.ro/biblioteca/148/169/normala/P92.html "Introductory note to Nicolae Filimon, ''Ciocoii vechi şi noi''], at the [http://www.bmb-on-line.ro/scripts/master.htm Bucharest Municipal Library]; retrieved August 19, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; For a while during those years, Ghica edited two satirical magazine, ''Păcală'' (named in honor of the [[Păcală|eponymous folk hero]]) and ''Scrânciobul''.&lt;ref&gt;Adamescu, "Epoca lui Alecsandri. b"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1863, he went on a trip to Moldavia, where he notably visited his relative Cleopatra Ghica (married into the Russian [[Trubetskoy]] family).&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.387"/&gt; He was again involved in a trial for [[calumny]], but he was able to prove that the incriminated article was not his.&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.387"/&gt; Ghica also took interest in the activities of [[Iacob Negruzzi]], a Moldavian-born writer who arrived in Bucharest around 1865—it was Ghica who introduced Negruzzi to the Rosetti circle.&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.85"&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.85&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1870s, he was also contributing articles to Rosetti's journal ''[[Românul]]''.&lt;ref name="Ornea, p.293"&gt;Ornea, p.293&lt;/ref&gt; During the same period, he began publishing his literary pieces in ''[[Revista Contimporană]]''.&lt;ref name="Cazimir, p.150"&gt;Cazimir, p.150&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1866, ''[[Domnitor]]'' Cuza was replaced with [[Carol I of Romania|Carol of Hohenzollern]]. Apparently, Pantazi Ghica had played a secondary part in the conspiracy that toppled Cuza, as a local commander of the Citizens' Guard.&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.387"&gt;Călinescu, p.387&lt;/ref&gt; Ghica was subsequently assigned the office of Buzău County [[Prefect (Romania)|prefect]] by the first of his brother's cabinets.&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.387"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pippididilema"/&gt; The appointment was welcomed by [[Vasile Alecsandri]], who was keeping a detailed correspondence with both brothers.&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.387"/&gt; However, his time in office was cut short, allegedly because he came to be disliked by Carol.&lt;ref name="pippididilema"/&gt; He returned to the capital, where he purchased a villa on Cometei Street (the present-day Căderea Bastiliei Street), nearby [[Piaţa Romană]].&lt;ref name="pippididilema"/&gt; For a second time in eight years, he was exposed to public scrutiny for having failed to honor his debts: in 1868, his possessions in [[Buzău]] were [[Sequestration (law)|sequestrated]].&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.387"/&gt; Late in the year, he was Alecsandri's representative during a legal conflict with the peasants residing on his domain (after winning the trial, Alecsandri reciprocated by introducing Ghica to his friend, [[List of Romanian Ministers of the Interior|Minister of the Interior]] [[Mihail Kogălniceanu]]).&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.388"&gt;Călinescu, p.388&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final years===
His new Bucharest residence became a meeting spot for literary figures.&lt;ref name="pippididilema"/&gt; Ghica notably associated with the much younger [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] poet [[Alexandru Macedonski]], who was also his neighbor.&lt;ref name="pippididilema"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adamescu, "Epoca lui Alecsandri. b"; Vianu, Vol.II, p.347&lt;/ref&gt; In 1875, Pantazi Ghica was witness to a scandal involving the [[Romanian Army]] and [[Ion Emanuel Florescu]], the Minister of War. That year, the officer Ioan Crainic, who considered himself insulted by Florescu, handed in his resignation from the military and challenged the Minister to a [[duel]] (asking Ghica to serve as both his courier and witness); the problems were eventually avoided after Florescu ordered his subordinates to arrest Crainic.&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.391"/&gt; At the time, Macedonski engaged in liberal politics, and, in 1876, co-founded the short-lived newspaper ''Stindardul'', alongside Ghica, [[Bonifaciu Florescu]], and [[George Fălcoianu]].&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.347"&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.347&lt;/ref&gt; The publication was inspired by the renowned journalist [[Nicolae Moret Blaremberg]].&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.347"/&gt; Later, Ghica also published essays in Macedonski's newly founded and more prestigious magazine, ''[[Literatorul]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Adamescu, "Epoca lui Alecsandri. b"; Ornea, p.301-302&lt;/ref&gt;

He was for long a member of the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Chamber of Deputies]] and the [[Senate of Romania|Senate]], representing the "Red" liberal tendency and, late in life, the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberals]]. In June 1876, shortly after the first concentrated National Liberal cabinet came to power, he and [[Nicolae Fleva]] spearheaded the effort to prosecute the former [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880–1918)|"White" Conservative]] ministers. In opening the case, Ghica stated: "It wasn't just us who condemned those ministers, but public opinion in general, the entire country, cast a blame on them, and we are the expression of that blame".&lt;ref&gt;Bulei, p.26&lt;/ref&gt; The effort pitted Pantazi Ghica against his main literary rival, outgoing [[Ministry of Education, Research, Youth and Sport (Romania)|Education Minister]] [[Titu Maiorescu]], who was called in for questioning.&lt;ref&gt;Bulei, p.29&lt;/ref&gt; The attempt to stage a trial was ultimately defeated by moderates in Ghica's own party, who ignored his vocal protests.&lt;ref&gt;Bulei, p.30&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1881, promoting the designs of one Traian Theodorescu, Pantazi Ghica unsuccessfully presented [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]] with a proposal to have a [[submarine]] built for the [[Romanian Naval Forces|Romanian Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;Florin Manolescu, ''Literatura S.F.'', [[Editura Univers]], Bucharest, 1980, p.47. {{OCLC|7174578}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the same year, he was a cabinet-appointed inspector of historical monuments in Moldavia.&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.387"/&gt; In spring of 1882, shortly before his death, Ghica, like many of his fellow National Liberals, spoke out against I. Filibiliu, a teacher at the [[Matei Basarab High School]] who had administered a mild form of [[corporal punishment]] to one of his pupils.&lt;ref&gt;Perpessicius, p.242-244&lt;/ref&gt;

Pantazi Ghica died at his house on Cometei Street, and was buried at his family's estate in [[Ghergani]].&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.388"/&gt; Camila Ghica survived him by 21 years: reportedly afflicted by [[dementia]] in old age, she died in 1908, at the age of 80.&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.388"/&gt;

==In culture==

===Works===
[[File:Gravura din Bolintineanu, 'Nemesis'.jpeg|thumb|200px|Wallachian [[Romanticism|Romantic]] aesthetics in an illustration to ''Nemesis'', one of [[Dimitrie Bolintineanu]]'s poems]]
Ghica published the first of his many [[Romanticism|Romantic]] [[novella]]s by the 1860s, when he collaborated on Odobescu's magazine.&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.I, p.99-100"/&gt; Literary critic [[Tudor Vianu]] noted that some of his works had a strong connection with [[Bohemianism]],&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.237"&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.237&lt;/ref&gt; while others are thought to be influenced by the Romantic author [[Dimitrie Bolintineanu]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.389, 390&lt;/ref&gt; With time, however, Ghica moved away from Romanticism, and developed his own brand of [[Realism (arts)|Realism]], which did not exclude imagination and speculation, and which hailed Alecsandri as a prime example of writing.&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.388"/&gt; He was also opposed to Macedonski's notion of "sublime absurdity", arguing that the definitive criterion for creating poetic imagery was significance, and proposing elements of [[didacticism]] to feature in every work.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.388, 391&lt;/ref&gt; In one instance, he argued that beauty "must absolutely be united with the good".&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.388"/&gt;

Ghica's work of hidden memoirs, the novella ''Un boem român'' ("A Romanian Bohemian"), was a tale of adventure and [[unrequited love]]: its main character, Paul, whose adventures mirror many in Ghica's life, [[Elopement|elopes]] with a married woman, only to find that she is not faithful to him either.&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.388"/&gt; The plot is probably the first one in [[Romanian literature]] to discuss the topic of [[free love]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.romlit.ro/lecturi_la_zi15 "Lecturi la zi. Şapte teme"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 8/2003&lt;/ref&gt; In 1850, Ghica authored a piece in honor of the deceased poet [[Vasile Cârlova]], titled ''O lacrimă a poetului Cârlova'' ("One of Poet Cârlova's Tears"). It depicted Cârlova drinking from a skull-shaped cup with the inscription ''Lina, adu-ţi aminte!'' ("Lina, remember!", allegedly in honor of a nun he had loved).&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.389"&gt;Călinescu, p.389&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Pantazi Ghica wrote a lengthy [[satire]] the [[upper class|high society]] in his day (''Schiţe din societatea română'', "Sketches of the Romanian Society"), and, as a result of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878]], the play ''Răniţii români'' ("The Wounded Romanians").&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.390, 391&lt;/ref&gt; Ghica was outraged to find that the [[National Theatre Bucharest|National Theater]] did not accept his play, and, as a consequence, issued a formal protest.&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.391"/&gt; He contributed several romantic comedies, including, among others, ''Iadeş'' ("Wishbone") and ''Sterian Păţitul'' (roughly, "Sterian Who Has Learned").&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.391"/&gt; He is also the most likely author of a piece sometimes attributed to his brother, in which the author explores the literary legacy of [[Don Juan]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.390&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Beţia de cuvinte''===
By the close of the 1860s, Pantazi Ghica was among the main targets of early criticism from ''[[Junimea]]''—a literary society which expressed a [[Conservatism|conservative]] vision and was opposed to the cultural and political tenets of liberalism. Ghica's works were among those discussed by ''Junimea''{{'}}s [[Titu Maiorescu]] in his famous essay of 1873, ''Beţia de cuvinte''. The title, meaning literally "inebriation with words", attacked Romantic liberals over their experiments with [[Romanian language]], their [[Romantic nationalism|Romantic nationalist]] aesthetic guidelines, and their emphatic prose. The influential Maiorescu saw these as a main source for the widespread cultural and social problems facing Romania during its process of [[Westernization]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.291-292&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, ''Revista Contimporană'' contributors such as Ghica, [[V. A. Urechia]], [[August Treboniu Laurian]], and [[Gheorghe Sion]] are listed by Maiorescu as negative examples in Romanian literature, for their use of coined [[neologism]]s, as well as for their [[tautology (rhetoric)|tautologies]] and contradictions.&lt;ref name="betiadecuvinte"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Titu Maiorescu]], [http://ro.wikisource.org/wiki/Be%C5%A3ia_de_cuvinte_%C3%AEn_%22Revista_Contimporan%C4%83%22 ''Beţia de cuvinte în "Revista Contimporană"''] (wikisource)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ornea, p.292"&gt;Ornea, p.292&lt;/ref&gt; Maiorescu sarcastically recorded that Ghica was introducing new words to the [[Romanian lexis]], through the means of [[Francization]].&lt;ref name="betiadecuvinte"/&gt; Among other samples, the author used as illustrations several fragments from Pantazi Ghica's novella ''Marele vistier Cândescu'' ("The Great Treasurer Cândescu"). He noted the implicit tautology in Ghica's term ''silenţiu lugubru'' ("lugubrious silence"), pointing out that the first word covered the meaning of "silent" (thus leaving the notion to be read "silent silence").&lt;ref name="betiadecuvinte"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ornea, p.292"/&gt; A more complex one, listing several [[synonym]]s on end, read:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] all left in silence but their faces showed the same pain, the same exasperation, the same desperation."&lt;ref name="betiadecuvinte"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ornea, p.292"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Pantazi Ghica, Urechia, [[Dimitrie August Laurian]] and [[Petru Grădişteanu]] decided to issue a common reply to Maiorescu's accusations, using ''[[Românul]]'' as their venue.&lt;ref name="Ornea, p.293"/&gt; The ''Junimist'' intellectual believed that their answer was an ''[[ignoratio elenchi]]'', and dismissed their defense as "beside the point" (''nu e la chestie'').&lt;ref name="Ornea, p.293"/&gt;&lt;ref name="raspunsurile"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Titu Maiorescu]], [http://ro.wikisource.org/wiki/R%C4%83spunsurile_%22Revistei_Contimporane%22 ''Răspunsurile "Revistei Contimporane"''] (wikisource)&lt;/ref&gt; On the occasion, he also presented Ghica with more of his own mistakes.&lt;ref name="raspunsurile"/&gt;

Although not a ''Junimist'', Odobescu himself agreed with such views, and pointed out further inexactitudes in the works of Pantazi Ghica—these comments are featured in a chapter of his major book, the ''[[Pseudo-cynegetikos]]'', in its revised edition of 1887.&lt;ref name="odobescu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.II, p.249&lt;/ref&gt; Odobescu recorded the polemic between Ghica and the contributors to ''Junimea'''s magazine ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]''—the former stood accused of having embellished his own biography by claiming to have won the interest of French writers during his stay in [[Paris]].&lt;ref name="odobescu"/&gt; Odobescu hinted that he agreed with this assessment, stressing that [[Alexandre Dumas, père|Alexandre Dumas]] and [[Alfred de Musset]] had since died, and thus could not confirm that Pantazi Ghica had befriended them.&lt;ref name="odobescu"/&gt; He also noted, like the ''Junimists'', that the chronological order indicated by Ghica was spurious.&lt;ref name="odobescu"/&gt; The latter argument referred to Ghica's statement that, in 1852, Dumas and de Musset had listened to his rendition of [[Vasile Alecsandri]]'s poem ''Înşiră-te Mărgărite'', which had in fact been completed in 1856, and first made available for the public four years later.&lt;ref name="odobescu"/&gt;

Ghica was unnerved by Maiorescu's reaction to his work, and verbally attacked the younger literary critic in several contexts spanning his career.&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.387"/&gt; This was the case in 1878, when both of them stood in the Chamber for opposite camps, and when Ghica [[Heckler|heckled]] Maiorescu, who was giving a speech.&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.387"/&gt; On one occasion, Pantazi Ghica depicted Maiorescu as "a sort of a literary trickster", and himself claimed that his adversary was "at odds with grammar".&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.387"/&gt; Elsewhere, he claimed that Maiorescu's style "entirely lacks the conditions of serious criticism".&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.388"/&gt; With time, the conflict between Ghica and ''Convorbiri Literare'' degenerated into open hostility. Thus, in an unsigned piece of 1875, the magazine claimed to translate [[Victor Hugo]]'s ''[[Les Chansons des rues et des bois|Chansons des rues et des bois]]'': instead of the hunchback [[Mayeux]], whom Hugo had placed at the end of a cortege grouping all animals, the ''Convorbiri Literare'' version had introduced "Pantazi" and adapted the rhyme accordingly.&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.387"/&gt;

Maiorescu's verdicts on Pantazi Ghica were shared by more modern Romanian critics. Tudor Vianu called Ghica "prolific, but not gifted".&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, Vol.I, p.100&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, he backed Ghica's inclusion among the "victims of ''Inebriation with words'' [italics in the original]", as well as Maiorescu's criticism of his Francized speech.&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.237"/&gt; Vianu's generation colleague [[George Călinescu]] defined Pantazi Ghica as "untalented" (although he acknowledged his "vast literary culture"),&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.388"/&gt; while [[Ştefan Cazimir]] likened his writings for the stage to what he believed was [[Ion Luca Caragiale]]'s worst play, the [[melodrama]] ''[[O soacră]]''.&lt;ref name="Cazimir, p.150"/&gt; Călinescu referred to ''Marele vistier Cândescu'' as featuring "annoying [[neologism]]s" and "the lack of any intuition, no matter how modest, for historical color."&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.389"/&gt; Two exceptions among commentators were [[Gheorghe Adamescu]], who valued several of Ghica's works (including his 1850 piece about [[Vasile Cârlova]]),&lt;ref&gt;Adamescu, "Epoca lui Alecsandri. a"&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ştefan Sihleanu]], who credited Ghica with having single-handedly introduced [[Alessandro Manzoni]]'s type of [[historical novel]]s to local literature, in their adapted novella form.&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.387"/&gt;

===Ghica's politics and the ''Junimists''===
The conservative groupings were especially critical of Pantazi Ghica's politics. [[Iacob Negruzzi]], who eventually rallied with the ''Junimists'', resented Rosetti's radical circle, and left an unflattering memoir of its meetings.&lt;ref name="Vianu, Vol.II, p.85"/&gt; Several other writers who associated with ''Junimea'' attacked the two brothers Ghica for their alleged [[Political corruption|corruption]] and [[demagogy]]. In [[Mihai Eminescu]]'s lengthy poem ''[[Scrisoarea a III-a]]'', an entire section elaborates a virulent anti-liberal discourse. Of it, a group of lyrics are believed to refer to Pantazi Ghica (identified by his appearance and his [[kyphosis]])&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.387"/&gt; or, alternatively, to a composite portrayal of the two brothers.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.197-198&lt;/ref&gt; They read:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|ro|Vezi colo pe uriciunea fără suflet, fără cuget,
Cu privirea-mpăroşată şi la fălci umflat şi buget,
Negru, cocoşat şi lacom, un izvor de şiretlicuri,
La tovarăşii săi spune veninoasele-i nimicuri;
Toţi pe buze-având virtute, iar în ei monedă calpă,
Quintesenţă de mizerii de la creştet până-n talpă.}}
|
See down there the soulless, thoughtless fright,
With his eyebrow-covered sight and his jaws all swollen and bloated,
Black-faced, hunchbacked and greedy, the source of ruses,
To his comrades he recounts his venomous trifles;
All of them having virtue on their lips, and within them forged currency,
A quintessence of filth from tip to toe.}}

Eminescu followed Ghica's political career with interest. In one of his articles for the Conservative journal ''[[Timpul]]'', published in early 1882, he examined the Filibiliu affair, he took the teacher's side, arguing that both Ghica and Filibiliu's other [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal]] detractor, [[Petru Grădişteanu]], were exaggerating.&lt;ref&gt;Perpessicius, p.243&lt;/ref&gt; He commented that the scandal was largely owed to the victim's father having made use of his political connections with the [[Ion Brătianu]] cabinet, and protested when the teacher assigned a provincial post as a punitive measure.&lt;ref&gt;Perpessicius, p.242-248&lt;/ref&gt; This was one of several polemics between Eminescu and various associates of Rosetti: literary historian [[Perpessicius]] argued that they were partly responsible for the "super-tensed" relations between ''[[Românul]]'' and ''Timpul''.&lt;ref&gt;Perpessicius, p.246-247&lt;/ref&gt; George Călinescu identified other, less-known, poems by Eminescu, which also allude to Ghica's style, politics and personal life.&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.387"/&gt;

The dramatist Ion Luca Caragiale, who wrote many of his works under the influence of ''Junimist'' principles, developed his own thesis on the political shortcomings of the liberal trend. As part of it, he argued that there was an essential difference between, on one hand, the major liberal figures of the 1848 revolution ([[Nicolae Bălcescu]], [[Ion Câmpineanu]] and [[Ion Heliade Rădulescu]]) and, on the other, members of the National Liberal Party such as Pantazi Ghica, [[Nicolae Misail]] and [[Mihail Pătârlăgeanu]].&lt;ref name="Ornea, p.203"&gt;Ornea, p.203&lt;/ref&gt; In his view, the latter group usurped the revolutionary legacy, while the former could have found itself best represented by the emerging [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880–1918)|Conservative Party]].&lt;ref name="Ornea, p.203"/&gt;

===Anecdotes===
A socialite, Ghica was famed for his hectic lifestyle and his [[Eclecticism|eclectic culture]], which earned him the moniker ''Fantazaki'' (a pun on his two names, it originated in ''fantezie'', the Romanian word for "fantasy") and the colloquial title of "king of the Romanian Bohemia".&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.387"/&gt; Among his recorded eccentricities were the contrast in his attitudes toward dogs and cats (a lover of the former, he despised the latter), and his refusal to travel anywhere except by coach.&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.388"/&gt; A rumor which probably made it into Eminescu's poetry had it that Pantazi Ghica, the alleged lover of famed and usually foreign actresses, sold tickets to their shows in front of coffee houses.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.387, 388&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, others knew him as a [[gentleman]], praising him for his kindness and sociability.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.387-388&lt;/ref&gt;

At some stage in their lives, Pantazi Ghica and his friend C. A. Rosetti briefly associated with a circle of actors meeting in the house of theater manager [[Iorgu Caragiale]] (Ion Luca's uncle).&lt;ref name="carnetsufleur"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ion Luca Caragiale]], [http://ro.wikisource.org/wiki/Din_carnetul_unui_vechi_sufleur ''Din carnetul unui vechi sufleur''] (wikisource)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ion Luca Caragiale]]'s 1907 work, ''[[Din carnetul unui vechi sufleur]]'', featured an anecdote about Pantazi Ghica and Iorgu Caragiale, recounting how the former had fallen in love with an unnamed actress. According to the story, Ghica, who had asked the group of actors to facilitate an amorous meeting with the object of his affection, was the target of a prank: Iorgu Caragiale reportedly arranged for his colleague, a certain Matache Piţirigă, to dress up in female clothes and meet Ghica in an unlit room.&lt;ref name="carnetsufleur"/&gt; The story went that the Pantazi Ghica caressed Piţirigă, causing the latter to become indignant and thus reveal his true identity.&lt;ref name="carnetsufleur"/&gt; According to Ion Luca Caragiale, a shocked Pantazi Ghica ran out of the room and into the Fialcowsky coffee house. The amused reaction of the public surprised him, and he subsequently found that, in the dark, Piţirigă had smeared his face with [[soot]].&lt;ref name="carnetsufleur"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.267, 387&lt;/ref&gt; In its initial unpublished version, ''Din carnetul unui vechi sufleur'' simply described Iorgu Caragiale's victim as "a hunchback".&lt;ref name="carnetsufleur"/&gt; Caragiale later added to his own text:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"...When, a couple of years back, I was adding the lines above to my notebook, the cheated young man was still alive; today he is dead—may God forgive all the lyrics and all the prose with which he has enriched our young literature, all the speeches he has held in succession in front of the two Chambers and during public meetings!—and since «one should only speak well of the dead», here is name pure and simple: Pantazi Ghica."&lt;ref name="carnetsufleur"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another anecdote of the time had it that Pantazi Ghica was deeply resented by ''[[Domnitor]]'' [[Carol I of Romania|Carol]]. According to the story, this was sparked by one of Carol's hunting trips in the vicinity of [[Buzău]]. Ghica, who was charged with organizing the event, allegedly thought he could gain more favor with the monarch by using a bear which, unbeknown to Carol, had been previously tamed by [[Roma minority in Romania|Romani]] trainers (''see [[Ursari]]'').&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.387"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pippididilema"/&gt; Carol found out that this was the case, and, feeling insulted, ordered Pantazi Ghica to be relieved from his office of prefect.&lt;ref name="pippididilema"/&gt; The short-lived magazine ''Satyrul'' once accused Ghica of having [[Plagiarism|plagiarized]] for his ''Iadeş'', and of having only added a dog as a character to separate his text from the source. As a result, a series of satirical [[lithograph]]s, with Pantazi Ghica as their subject, showed a hunchback man in the company of a hunchback dog.&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.391"/&gt; Jokes about his medical condition even made it into the Chamber: a fellow deputy once made a public reference to Pantazi Ghica's arched spine, to which Ghica replied that it seemed arched because he only presented such colleagues with his back.&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.387"/&gt;

In 2010, researcher Radu Cernătescu proposed that Pantazi Ghica is the inspiration behind Gore Pirgu, the prototype social climber depicted in ''[[Craii de Curtea-Veche]]'' novel.&lt;ref name="ccgrano"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Cosmin Ciotloş]], [http://www.romlit.ro/cum_grano_salis "Cum grano salis"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 44/2010&lt;/ref&gt; The work, a Romanian classic, was written in the 1920s by Caragiale's estranged son [[Mateiu Caragiale|Mateiu]], and, Cernătescu notes, shows Ghica in company with decadent aristocrats from the [[Cantacuzino family|Cantacuzino]] and [[Soutzos family|Soutzos]] clans.&lt;ref name="ccgrano"/&gt;

'''Lu Ping''' ({{zh|c=路平|p=Lù Píng|poj=Lō͘ Pêng}}), born in [[Kaohsiung]] in 1953, is a [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] writer who writes under the pen name “'''Ping Lu'''”.&lt;ref name="QiWang2000"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Qi|first1=Bangyuan|last2=Wang|first2=Dewei|title=Chinese literature in the second half of a modern century: a critical survey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1S3fbay1xj0C&amp;pg=PA27|year=2000|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-33710-8|pages=27–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her writing encompasses a broad range of genres, including [[novels]], [[essays]], [[poems]], commentary, and [[theater]] plays. She is also known in the Chinese-language world for her critique of social phenomenon, ranging from cultural development to [[gender]] issues and [[human rights]]. Over the past two decades, Ms. Lu has successfully established herself as a prominent novelist, columnist, and commentator in [[Taiwan]].

==Background==
Ms. Lu graduated from the Department of [[Psychology]], [[National Taiwan University]], and gained a master's degree from the [[University of Iowa]]. While working as a statistician in the United States, she won first prize with her short story "Death in a Cornfield" in the 1983 United Daily News [[fiction]] competition. Her other works also won her many prizes, including a prize in [[prose]] and a prize in dramatic composition. In 2002, she published a novel about the death of a famous Taiwanese singer [[Teresa Teng]] entitled "When Will You Come Again?" (Chinese title: 何日君再來).

===Literary works===
Of her literary works, "Love and Revolution" (Chinese title: 行道天涯; The Chinese version first came out in 1995, while the English version was published by [[Columbia University]] Press in 2006)attracted the most attention. Ms. Lu re-imagines the lives of [[Sun Yat-sen]] and [[Soong Ching-ling]], a legendary couple in modern China. She not only explores their marital relations, including their failings and desires, but also mentions Sun Yat-sen's political career and Soong Ching-ling's feelings of isolation and loneliness after her husband died. As [[Perry Link]] pointed out in his article entitled "Chinese Shadows" (published on November 16, 2006, by The New York Review), Ms. Lu also tries to find in Soong Ching-ling "the person buried under all the layers of image-making" and to "reconstruct a credible portrait" of the famous woman. He also said Ms. Lu "succeeds in showing the ordinary and sometimes repugnant details of Qingling's life," and that she "may or may not be accurate about Qingling's inner life, but she certainly writes with honesty and with penetration."

Her more recent works includes fiction "The River Darkens" (Chinese title: 黑水; published in 2015) and autobiographical essays collection "Heart Mandala" (Chinese title: 坦露的心; published in 2017). 

==Ambassador at Large ==
Prior to becoming the director of [[Kwang Hwa Information and Cultural Center]] in January 2003, Ms. Lu had worked as an [[Editing|editorial writer]] for The [[China Times]], spent many years lecturing on such subjects as [[feminism]], cultural [[criticism]], and news commentary at [[National Taiwan University]] and [[Taipei National University of the Arts]], and served as [[ambassador-at-large]] for Taiwan for a few years.

Ms. Lu left her post in [[Kwang Hwa Information and Cultural Center]] in December 2009, but is continuously promoting cultural and economical exchanges between Taiwan and Hong Kong.  

She is currently the chairman of [[Radio Taiwan International]].

[[File:Mario Trevi 2010.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mario Trevi]]]]
The '''sceneggiata''' (pl. ''sceneggiate'') or '''sceneggiata napoletana''' is a form of musical [[drama]] typical of [[Naples]].  Beginning as a form of [[musical theatre]] after [[World War I]], it was also adapted for cinema; sceneggiata films became especially popular in the 1970s, and contributed to the genre becoming more widely known outside Naples.  

The sceneggiata can be roughly described as a "musical soap opera", where action and dialogue are interspersed with [[Canzone Napoletana|Neapolitan songs]].  Plots revolve around [[melodrama]]tic themes drawing from the Neapolitan culture and tradition, including passion, jealousy, betrayal, personal deceit and treachery, honor, vengeance, and life in the world of petty crime.  Songs and dialogue were originally in [[Neapolitan dialect]], although, especially in filmic production, [[Italian language|Italian]] has sometimes been preferred, to reach a larger audience.

Outside Italy, sceneggiata is mostly known in areas populated by Italian immigrants.  Besides Naples, the second homeland of sceneggiata is probably [[Little Italy]] in [[New York City]].

==History and evolution==
===The golden age: 1920-1940===
The sceneggiata has its roots in cheap, popular theatrical performances, and scholars believe that economic considerations were decisive in its development.&lt;ref name ="scialo45"&gt;Pasquale Scialò, ''La canzone napoletana'', Newton, 1994, pag.45-48&lt;/ref&gt; This is also true of the genre's most commonly identified forerunners, such as the works of [[Pasquale Altavilla]] (1806-1875), who developed many of his comedies around successful songs to appeal to a larger audience. After [[World War I]], the Italian government increased the taxation of [[variety show]]s, thus causing many authors to devise a mixed type of show that would complement songs with dramatic acting, in order to circumvent such duties.&lt;ref name ="scialo45"/&gt;  This ''escamotage'' is sometimes credited to [[Enzo Lucio Murolo]], who explicitly wrote the song ''Surriento gentile'' with the intent to create a sceneggiata around it and bring it to theatres in that form (the sceneggiata was performed by the Cafiero-Fumo company in 1920).&lt;ref name="isso"/&gt;

One of the first known examples of sceneggiata is ''[[Pupatella]]'' (1918), based on the eponymous song by [[Libero Bovio]], and performed by the theatre company led by [[Giovanni D'Alessio]].  In the following years the sceneggiata quickly developed with the advent of dedicated companies, such as that founded by [[Salvatore Cafiero]] (formerly a variety show author) and [[Eugenio Fumo]] (formerly a popular dramatist), and dedicated venues, such as the ''Trianon'' and ''San Ferdinando'' theatres, that became "temples" of the genre.&lt;ref name="isso"&gt;[http://www.scenaillustrata.com/public/spip.php?article994 Isso, essa e o malamente, l'epopea della sceneggiata]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Cafiero-Fumo company (which starred, among others, [[Nino Taranto]]) largely contributed to establishing the genre's parameters.  The typical sceneggiata included monologues, dialogues, songs, dancing, and its plot was centered on strong emotions such as love, passion, jealousy, honor, betrayal, adultery, vengeance, and the fight between good and evil.  A standard pattern was that of the "triangle" comprising ''isso'' ("he", the hero), ''essa'' ("she", the heroine) and ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;o malamente'' ("the villain").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bella.napoli.it/varie-napoli/il-teatro-napoletano/ Il teatro napoletano]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isso"/&gt;

Sceneggiata remained extremely popular in Naples from the 1920s throughout to the 1940s.  This era was dominated by a relatively small number of authors, called "poeti di compagnia" ("company poets") who wrote most of the screenplays; those included [[Enzo Lucio Murolo]] (1898-1975), [[Oscar Di Maio]], [[Gaspare di Maio]] (1872-1930), and [[Raffaele Chiurazzi]]. 

In this golden era of the sceneggiata, the genre was also exported abroad, especially in communities of Italian immigrants of Neapolitan origin.  [[New York City]]'s [[Little Italy]], most nostably, became a sort of second homeland of the sceneggiata, with notable companies such as [[Maggio-Coruzzolo-Ciaramella]], [[Marchetello-Diaz]], and that led by [[Gilda Mignonette]] (1890-1953), the so-called "Queen of Emigrants".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ildiscobolo.net/MIGNONETTE%20GILDA%20HOME.htm Gilda Mignonette]&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides being performed in theatres, sceneggiate were adapted for film since the early years of cinematography.  The prominent sceneggiata [[movie studio]] was [[Miramare Film]], founded by [[Emanuele Rotonno]], that between 1919 and 1927 produced over 100 largely successful movies.  This era of sceneggiata films, by the way, established a tradition of movies based on hit songs, which remained in Italian film making long after the decline of sceneggiata itself. One of the best known developments of this tradition is the "[[Musicarello]]" subgenre that became popular in the 1950s-1960s in Italy, whereby many popular singer and singer-songwriters (e.g., [[Gianni Morandi]], [[Al Bano]], [[Adriano Celentano]], [[Little Tony (singer)|Little Tony]], and others) would also be actors in movies linked to their major hits.

===Revival: 1970-1990===

The sceneggiata almost disappeared across [[World War II]]. In 1969, a single theatre in Naples (the Teatro Duemila) was continuing this tradition.  Nevertheless, in the 1970s the genre had a new boost.  While this revival was mostly driven by successful sceneggiata films starring popular singers/actors such as [[Mario Merola (singer)|Mario Merola]], [[Mario Trevi]], and [[Nino D'Angelo]], sceneggiata also reappeared in theatres.  Merola, in particular, became so popular with movies such as ''[[Sgarro alla Camorra]]'' or ''[[Zappatore]]'' (the most successful sceneggiata film ever) to earn the title of "king of sceneggiata".  Especially outside Naples, Merola is by far the best known representative of the sceneggiata genre and he is often mentioned to refer to sceneggiata through [[antonomasia]]. 

The revival era of sceneggiata, too, had its "company poets", who worked either for theatres, films, or both. Prominent representatives of this generation of sceneggiata authors include [[Alberto Sciotti]] (1925-1998), [[Aniello Langella]] (1919-1995), [[Francesco Martinelli]], [[Elena Cannio]], and [[Gaetano Di Maio]] (1927-1991).


===In popular culture===
*A scene from "Senza Mamma" a sceneggiata written by Francis Coppola's grandfather Francesco Pennino, is featured in Coppola's [[Godfather Part II]]. 
*The Italian pornographic film director Mario Salieri released his ''Sceneggiata Napoletana'', in which sexual activity with background music takes the rôle of the form's usual musical interludes.

'''Stage hypnosis''' is [[hypnosis]] performed in front of an audience for the purposes of entertainment, usually in a theatre or club. A modern stage hypnosis performance typically delivers a comedic show rather than simply a demonstration to impress an audience with powers of persuasion. Apparent effects of [[amnesia]], mood altering and [[hallucination]] may be demonstrated in a normal presentation.

The causes of behaviour exhibited by volunteers in stage hypnosis shows is an area of dispute. Some claim it illustrates altered states of consciousness (i.e., "hypnotic trance"). Others maintain that it can be explained by a combination of psychological factors observed in group settings such as disorientation, [[Compliance (psychology)|compliance]], [[peer pressure]], and ordinary [[suggestion]]. Others yet allege that deception plays a part.

==History==
Stage hypnosis evolved out of much older shows conducted by Mesmerists and other performers in the 18th and 19th centuries. Scottish surgeon [[James Braid (surgeon)|James Braid]] developed his technique of [[hypnosis]] after witnessing a stage performance by the travelling Swiss magnetic demonstrator [[Charles Lafontaine]] (1803–1892) in November 1841.&lt;ref&gt;"Magnetic demonstrator" – Gauld's term (Gauld, 1992, p. 204) – accurately describes Lafontaine; because whilst he was in the U.K., he only demonstrated "magnetic" phenomena; he never used it to treat anyone at any time (in public or private).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Braid always maintained that he had gone to Lafontaine's demonstration as an open-minded sceptic, eager to examine the evidence and, then, form a considered opinion of Lafontaine's work. He was neither a closed-minded cynic intent on destroying Lafontaine, nor a deluded and naïvely credulous believer seeking authorisation of his already formed belief (''Neurypnology'' (1843), p.2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For an extended account of the interactions between Braid and Lafontaine, see Yeates (2013), pp.103–308 passim.&lt;/ref&gt;

Braid was well aware of similar performances by "electro-biologists" in his day;&lt;ref&gt;"'''Electrobiology''': A mode of inducing hypnotism by having the subject look steadily at metallic disks. The process originated about the middle of the nineteenth century, and its fame was spread by numerous lecturers in England and the United States.", Melton, J.G. [2001] (ed), ''Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology (Fifth Edition), in Two Volumes, Volume 1 (A-L)'', Thomson Gale, (Farmington Hills), 2001, p.489.&lt;/ref&gt; e.g., Braid published the contents of an advertising hand-bill for an "electro-biology" performance by a visiting American, George W. Stone,&lt;ref&gt;Stone was the compiler and editor of [https://archive.org/details/philosophyelect00stongoog ''The Philosophy of Electro-Biology, or Electrical Psychology, in a Course of Nine Lectures, Delivered by J. B. Dods, before the United States Senate, at Washington, in 1850, etc'']. Stone was also involved, for a time, in the active promotion the medium, Maria Basheba Hayden (1826–1883), the wife of his close friend, William Richardson Hayden, M.D. (1820–1903), journalist, and editor of ''The Boston Atlas'', and a monthly newsletter called ''The Star Spangled Banner''. Maria Hayden, who graduated M.D. in 1865, also [[Augustus De Morgan#Spiritualism|assisted Augustus De Morgan in his paranormal investigations]].&lt;/ref&gt; on 12 March 1851, which, as well as clearly emphasising that Stone was claiming to use volunteers from the audience, rather than his own stooges/assistants, details some of the phenomena that Stone's audience might have expected to have displayed to them.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Persons in a perfectly wakeful state, of well-known character and standing in society, who come forward voluntarily from among the audience, will be experimented upon. They will be deprived of the power of speech, hearing, sight. Their voluntary motions will be completely controlled, so that, they can neither rise up nor sit down, except at the will of the operator; their memory will be taken away, so that they will forget their own name and that of their most intimate friends; they will be made to stammer, and to feel pain in any part of their body at the option of the operator – a walking stick will be made to appear a snake, the taste of water will be changed to vinegar, honey, coffee, milk, brandy, wormwood, lemonade, etc., etc., etc. These extraordinary experiments are really and truly performed without the aid of trick, collusion, or deception, in the slightest possible degree.&lt;ref&gt;Braid's quote is at p.512 of [https://books.google.com/books?id=WjwCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA511#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Braid, J., "Electro-Biological Phenomena Physiologically and Psychologically Considered, by James Braid, M.R.C.S. Edinburgh, &amp;c. &amp;c. (Lecture delivered at the Royal Institution, Manchester, March 26, 1851)", ''The Monthly Journal of Medical Science'', Vol.12, (June 1851), pp.&amp;nbsp;511–530.]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These are identical to many of the demonstrations which became central to subsequent "stage hypnosis", in fact it seems that little changes except the name and the introduction of the hypnotic induction, etc. Likewise, the novelist [[Mark Twain]] similarly recounts a Mesmeric performance which clearly resembles 20th century stage hypnosis, in his autobiography.

The absence of any reference to "hypnotism" in these early performances, indeed before the term was coined, and the fact that they often lacked anything resembling a modern hypnotic induction is consistent with the skeptical view, that stage hypnosis is primarily the result of ordinary suggestion rather than hypnotic trance. Indeed, early performers often claimed that they were influencing their subjects by means of telepathy and other supernatural powers.

Others, however, were delivering performances that displayed the wide range of hypnotic manifestations to their audiences. In the United States, for example, in the 1890s, there was a small group of highly skilled stage hypnotists, all whom were managed by Thomas F. Adkin, who toured country-wide, playing to packed houses. Adkin's group included Sylvain A. Lee,&lt;ref&gt;Author of ''The Practice of Hypnotic Suggestion'' (1901). One of his specialties was hypnotising per medium of the telephone; poster at [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/h?pp/PPALL:@field(NUMBER+@band(var+0467))] [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/h?pp/PPALL:@field(NUMBER+@band(var+2023))]&lt;/ref&gt;
Mr. and Mrs. Herbert L. Flint,&lt;ref&gt;Herbert L. Flint was the author of ''Flint's lessons in hypnotism; a comprehensive work on scientific suggestion as applied in hypnotism, mesmerism, personal magnetism, magnetic healing, psycho-therapeutics, suggestive therapeutics and similar manefestations of mental development and control'' (1915); poster at [http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/var.1617]&lt;/ref&gt; and Professor Xenophon LaMotte Sage.&lt;ref&gt;Author of ''Hypnotism as It Is: a Book for Everybody'' (1897). Xenophon LaMotte Sage was the stage name of E. Virgil Neal; see Conroy, (2009), passim, especially pp.&amp;nbsp;27–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===
Throughout the 20th century, despite adopting the term "hypnotism", stage hypnotists continued to explain their performances to audiences by reference to supernatural powers and [[animal magnetism]]. Ormond McGill, e.g., in his Encyclopedia of the subject wrote in 1996 that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Some have called this powerful transmission of thought from one person to another "thought projection". The mental energy used appears to be of two types: magnetic energy&amp;nbsp;... generated within the body and telepathic energy generated within the mind.&amp;nbsp;... The two work together as a unit in applying Power Hypnosis. The operation of the two energies in combination is what Mesmer referred to as "animal magnetism".&lt;ref&gt;Ormond McGill, The New Encyclopedia of Stage Hypnosis, 1996: 24&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, this is not what Braid meant by "hypnotism", a term coined in opposition to theories of Mesmerism, to stress the fact that the results were due to ordinary psychological and physiological processes, such as suggestion and focused attention, rather than telepathy or animal magnetism. Indeed, after meeting with Mr. Stone, experimenting with his own subjects, and presenting his findings on such performances to the [[Royal Institution]], Braid concludes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There is, therefore, both positive and negative proof in favour of my mental and suggestive theory, and in opposition to the magnetic, occult, or electric theories of the Mesmerists and electro-biologists. My theory, moreover, has this additional recommendation, that it is level to our comprehension, and adequate to account for all which is demonstrably true, without offering any violence to reason and common sense, or being at variance with generally admitted physiological and psychological principles.&lt;ref&gt;Braid, J. (1851). ''Electro-Biological Phenomena, etc.'', p.530.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, modern stage performers often continue to misuse the word "hypnosis" in describing their shows and encourage misconceptions about [[hypnotism]] by confusing it with [[Mesmerism]] for dramatic effect.{{Citation needed|reason=No evidence of current misconceptions|date=April 2013}}

==Skepticism==
[[File:Catalepsy example.png|thumb|right|[[Catalepsy]]: "the human bridge".]]
Mesmeric and other stage performances changed their names to "stage hypnotist" in the 19th century. They had originally claimed to produce the same effects by means of telepathy and animal magnetism, and only later began to explain their shows in terms of hypnotic trance and suggestion. Hence, many of the precursors of stage hypnosis did not employ hypnotic induction techniques. Moreover, several modern stage performers{{who|date=April 2013}} have themselves published criticisms which suggest that stage hypnosis is largely the result of sleight of hand, ordinary suggestion, and social compliance, etc., rather than hypnotic trance.{{Citation needed|reason=citation need for 'several' as well as 'modern'|date=April 2013}} Most notably, the well-known American magician and performer, [[Kreskin]], has frequently carried out typical stage hypnosis demonstrations without using any hypnotic induction. After working as a stage hypnotist and magician for nearly two decades, Kreskin became a skeptic and a whistleblower from within the stage hypnosis field.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
For nineteen years I had believed in&amp;nbsp;... the sleeplike "hypnotic trance," practicing it constantly. Though I had nagging doubts at times, I wanted to believe in it. There was an overpowering mystique about putting someone to sleep, something that set me and all other "hypnotists" apart. We were marvellous Svengalis or Dr. Mesmers, engaged in a supernatural practice of sorts. Then it all collapsed. For me anyway.&lt;ref&gt;Kreskin, The Amazing World of Kreskin, 1973: 143.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After experimenting with his own subjects for several years until he was satisfied he could perform "stage hypnosis" without any hypnotic induction or trance, he concluded, "The battle of semantics may be waged for years, but I firmly believe that what is termed 'hypnosis' is, again, a completely normal, not abnormal, response to simple suggestion." An outspoken skeptic regarding stage hypnosis, Kreskin not only actively debunked stage hypnotists' claims, but went so far as to offer a substantial monetary reward, $25,000, to anyone who could prove the existence of hypnotic trance. The reward has been unsuccessfully challenged three times.&lt;ref&gt;Kreskin, The Amazing World of Kreskin, 1973: 152&lt;/ref&gt; While debunking the "sleep-trance" concept, Kreskin, like other skeptics adopting the nonstate position, was keen to emphasise that he felt the value of hypnotic suggestion had been frequently underestimated.

British stage hypnotist Alex Tsander has made a rejection of belief in a "state of hypnosis" a central feature of his career.&lt;ref&gt;Rider, D. 1995. "Playing Those Mind Games", Bath Chronicle, "Night Time" supplement, W/E March 8th&lt;/ref&gt; Tsander, who was among 39 parties consulted by the UK Home Office during their 1995-96 review of the regulation of performance,&lt;ref&gt;Dipple, D. 1996. UK Home Office circular No 39/1996 p. 2, para. 7&lt;/ref&gt; whilst continuing to perform, since 1993, also promoted a sceptical, social psychological view in a series of books. In "The Art and Secrets of Stage Hypnotism" &lt;ref name="Tsander, A 2006"&gt;Tsander, A. 2006, 2012. The Art and Secrets of Stage Hypnotism. Summitother. {{ISBN|0955073162}}&lt;/ref&gt; he stressed a terminological distinction between "hypnotism" and "hypnosis", stating that "hypnotism is the art of creating the illusion of hypnosis". Tsander calls his show "I Can't Believe It's NOT Hypnosis",&lt;ref&gt;Royle, J. 2005. Confessions of A Hypnotist: Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Hypnosis But Were Afraid To Ask. Xlibris Corporation. P450.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}} a title since adopted by others. Tsander boldly states in publicity that no participant is ever in a "state of hypnosis". He argues, in "Beyond Hypnosis",&lt;ref&gt;Tsander, A. 2005. Beyond Hypnosis: Hypnotism, Stage Hypnotism and The Myth of "Hypnosis", Summitother, {{ISBN|0955073189}}&lt;/ref&gt; that all activities that use hypnotic protocols, such as in hypnotherapy, are based in the cultural influence of roles and schemas of what it is to be hypnotised, ultimately created and sustained through the impressions made by stage hypnotists, manipulating social psychological factors. As an extreme illustration of this, Tsander has used the example of Milton Erickson. Whilst Erickson objected to stage hypnotism, Tsander argued, in "Beyond Erickson" &lt;ref&gt;Tsander, A. 2005. Beyond Erickson: A Fresh Look at "The Emperor of Hypnosis", Summitother. {{ISBN|0955073103}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the therapists reputation largely depended upon live demonstrations and that he was in effect a stage hypnotist. He takes Erickson's own accounts of his demonstrations and explains them in terms of normal, social psychological processes and interactions, requiring no special phenomenon or hypnosis to explain.

==Role of deception==

Due to stage hypnotists' showmanship, many people believe that hypnosis is a form of mind control. However, the effects of stage hypnosis are probably due to a combination of relatively ordinary social psychological factors such as peer pressure, social compliance, participant selection, ordinary suggestibility, and some amount of physical manipulation, stagecraft, and trickery.&lt;ref name="Yapko 1990 28"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Yapko | first = Michael |authorlink=Michael D. Yapko | title=Trancework: An introduction to the practice of Clinical Hypnosis | location=New York, New York | publisher=Brunner/Mazel | year=1990 | pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The desire to be the centre of attention, having an excuse to violate their own inner fear suppressors and the pressure to please are thought to convince subjects to "play along".&lt;ref name="Wagstaff"&gt;Wagstaff, Graham F. (1981) ''Hypnosis, Compliance and Belief'', St. Martin's Press, New York. {{ISBN|0-312-40157-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} Books written by stage hypnotists sometimes explicitly describe the use of [[deception]] in their acts. For example, [[Ormond McGill|Ormond McGill's]] ''New Encyclopedia of Stage Hypnosis'' describes an entire "fake hypnosis" act which depends upon the use of private whispers throughout:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[The hypnotist whispers off-microphone:] "We are going to have some good laughs on the audience and fool them&amp;nbsp;... so when I tell you to do some funny things, do exactly as I secretly tell you. Okay? Swell." (Then deliberately wink at the spectator in a friendly fashion.)&lt;ref&gt;McGill, Ormond. (1996) ''The New Encyclopedia of Stage Hypnosis'', p. 506.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to experts such as [[Theodore X. Barber]] and [[André Muller Weitzenhoffer]], stage hypnosis traditionally employs three fundamental strategies:
# '''Participant compliance'''. Participants on stage tend to be compliant because of the social pressure felt in the situation constructed on stage, before an expectant audience.
# '''Participant selection'''. Preliminary suggestion tests, such as asking the audience to clasp their hands and suggesting they cannot be separated, are usually used to select out the most suggestible and [[compliance (psychology)|socially compliant]] subjects from the audience. By asking for volunteers to mount the stage, the performer also tends to select the most [[extraverted]] members of the audience.
# '''Deception of the audience'''. Stage hypnotists are performers who traditionally, but not always, employ a variety of "sleight of hand" strategies to mislead their audience for dramatic effect.

The strategies of deception employed in traditional stage hypnosis can be categorised as follows:
# '''Off-microphone whispers'''. The hypnotist lowers his microphone and whispers secret instructions to the participant on stage, outside the audience's hearing. These may involve requests to "play along" or fake hypnotic responses.&lt;ref name=BSC&gt;Barber, Spanos &amp; Chaves. ''Hypnotism: Imagination &amp; Human Potentialities'' (1974), p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Failure to challenge'''. The stage hypnotist pretends to challenge subjects to defy a suggestion, for example, "You cannot stand up out of your chair because your backside is stuck down with glue." However, no specific cue is given to the participants to begin their effort ("Start trying now!"). This creates the illusion that a specific challenge has been issued and effort made to defy it.&lt;ref name=BSC /&gt;
# '''Fake hypnosis tricks'''. Stage hypnosis literature contains a large repertoire of sleight of hand tricks, of the kind used by professional illusionists. None of these tricks require any hypnosis or suggestion, but depend purely on physical manipulation and audience deception. The most famous example of this type is the "human plank" trick, which involves making a subject's body become rigid (cataleptic) and suspending them horizontally between two chairs, at which point the hypnotist will often stand upon their chest for dramatic effect. This has nothing to do with hypnosis, but simply depends on the fact that when subjects are positioned in the correct way they can support more weight than the audience tends to assume.&lt;ref name=BSC /&gt;
# '''Stooges'''. Several experts, including Kreskin, have stated that stage hypnotists have been known to make use of stooges (also called ''horses'') who travel from show to show. A stage hypnotist may only require a single stooge because by using him first for each demonstration real subjects from the audience will tend to follow his lead and imitate his responses. Moreover, for the climax of the show, the hypnotist will often focus on one or two subjects to demonstrate more difficult and dramatic responses involving apparent hallucinatory experiences. A single stooge can be used for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Kreskin. ''The Amazing World of Kreskin'' (1973), p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weitzenhoffer400&gt;[[André Muller Weitzenhoffer|Weitznehoffer, Andre]]. ''The Practice of Hypnotism'' (2000), p. 400.&lt;/ref&gt;

Weitzenhoffer writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Having not only had a chance to watch famous stage hypnotists of the 1940s and 50s such as [Ralph] Slater&lt;ref&gt;Real name Joseph Bolsky (see [https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.198933960176777.46878.184120231658150&amp;type=3] ("Dr. Wilbur" is [[Cornelia B. Wilbur]]), and [http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/192/308/210802]).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Franz Polgar|Polgar]] at work but having also had a chance to have fairly extensive personal contact with other stage hypnotists, I believe I can throw some light upon the situation. To begin with, one should be aware that many stage hypnotists use stooges or plants.&lt;ref name=Weitzenhoffer400 /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Alex Tsander argues&lt;ref&gt;Tsander, A. 2006,2012. The Art and Secrets of Stage Hypnotism, Summitother. {{ISBN|0955073162}}&lt;/ref&gt; that use of a stooge has in modern times been for all practical purposes inconceivable because of the frequency of their reappearance in different performances (sometimes repeatedly at the same venue) and the dire consequences of being discovered. A likelihood increased by the Internet, social media and camera-phones in the audience.

Whilst denying the existence of a "state of hypnosis", Tsander has since the early 1990s presented "close up" sessions in which volunteers sit with him at a table whilst the audience sit or stand adjacent. An audience in close proximity makes the kind of subterfuge mentioned above, such as stage whispers, impossible. For Tsander, coupled with his denying a state of hypnosis, this demonstrates that social psychology and suggestion offer sufficient explanation for all hypnotic effects. Under favourable circumstances neither "hypnosis" nor deception is necessary to obtain even the most theatrical behaviour from suitable volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;Tsander, A. Visual Reference, 1.Accessed online at: https://www.flickr.com/photos/16196214@N07/1753544748/in/album-721576027209907589/&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, those who argue for a substantial "state" of hypnosis cite clinical claims (not actually evidenced in any case of stage performance, one hopes) such as the following:

"...editorial implying most subjects have no will or interest in not following the suggestion of the hypnotist, conveniently omit the primary interest in hypnotism came in the early 1800's before ether and morphine were widely available. Thousands of extremely painful operations were performed through the use of hypnosis. Patients awoke without memory of the surgery and even healed much faster than those who endured the extreme pain without hypnosis. Sigmund Freud was directly responsible for removing hypnosis from psychotherapy because of so many reports that patients also had intuitions about conditions of patients they had never met while in the trance state."&lt;ref&gt;Anon. 2016. Edit to this Wiki as quoted.{{reliable source|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such arguments originate in the work of James Esdaile at a medical mission in India, recounted in his book of 1847. This was before the concept of "hypnotism" (only recently promoted by Braidin 1843) had spread and Esdailes work was still referred to as "Mesmerism". Whilst Esdaile claimed his patients felt no pain observers on behalf of an independent commission of enquiry for the Bengal government reported scenes of those undergoing such operations writhing in agony. Regarding more recent claims of painless surgery, Barber, among others, has pointed out that detail in accounts of such surgery admit that patients are, even though not unconscious, rendered stuporous by cocktails of anxiolytics. Moreover, the proportion of patients capable of undergoing such procedures (attaining sufficiently "deep" "hypnosis") is as small as the percentage of the population who are capable of undergoing surgery with neither chemical nor hypnotic assistance, inviting the suspicion that these groups of "special" patients overlap. Moreover, Barber also points out that invariably, cases of hypnotic surgery do use local anaesthetic at the area of incision, whilst internal organs are not capable of registering pain in response to a skilled cut rendering many such operations feasible without general anaesthetic, the role of hypnotic influence being essentially at an emotional or anxiolytic level. Furthermore, far from there being "thousands" of such cases of hypno-anaesthesia in surgery it remains sufficiently rare as to warrant the attention of news reports when it occurs. As rare, indeed, as the exceptional individuals able to undergo such surgery.

However, none of the foregoing debate about hypnotic procedures in a clinical setting has any bearing upon stage hypnosis.

==Role of hypnotist and subject==

=== Hypnotist ===
[[File:Nazareth College Hypnotist.jpg|thumb|right|A stage hypnotist and his subjects]]

Due to stage hypnotists' showmanship and their perpetuating the [[illusion]] of possessing mysterious abilities, the appearance of a trance state is often interpreted as an "effect" of the hypnotist's "power". The real power of stage hypnosis comes from the trust the "hypnotist" can instill in their subjects. Subjects have to cooperate and be willing to follow instructions and the hypnotist will employ several tests to choose the best subjects. Some people are very trusting, or even looking for an excuse to abdicate their responsibilities and are apparently able to be "hypnotised" within seconds, while others take more time to counter their fears.

Suggestion is very powerful and a good hypnotist will know how to deliver suggestions that can create better entertainment for the audience. In his book ''Deeper and Deeper'' by Jonathan Chase,&lt;ref&gt;Chase, Jonathan (2005) ''Deeper and Deeper'' the secrets of stage hypnosis - p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; he talks about delivering suggestion, more importantly, The Super Suggestion a phrase he coined in his first published book in 1999:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"From this moment everything I say to you. Every single thing I say, no matter how silly or stupid it seems will instantly become your reality. Everything I say will instantly become your reality."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He emphasises the use of repetition but warns that when they have accepted the suggestion then everything that the hypnotist says to them after this point will become an irresistible suggestion.

Historically, stage hypnotists often made claims for hypnotically induced enhancements to volunteer abilities beyond normal limits. One such routine that persists is that of "The Human Bridge". The English hypnotist Alex Tsander has made a particular theme of taking this cliché routine, which is still touted by many hypnotists as a uniquely hypnotic "feat", and de-bunking it by demonstrating that no hypnosis is required. He does this in studio videos with non-hypnotised volunteers, both models and himself, talking to camera. Whilst emphasising that no weight should ever be placed on a person in that situation (which is specifically forbidden in public UK performances under the Model Conditions) he explains in "The Art and Secrets of Stage Hypnotism" &lt;ref&gt;Tsander, A. 2005, 2012. The Art and Secrets of Stage Hypnotism. Summitother. {{ISBN|0955073162}}&lt;/ref&gt; how performers elsewhere deceive audiences when doing so. At the Kit Kat club, Berlin, in 2012, whilst appearing as himself, Tsander also performed as "Erektor The Bridgebuilder" presenting "Bridgeward Bound",&lt;ref&gt;Residentadvisor. 2012. Wasteland Berlin. Accessed online at: https://www.residentadvisor.net/event.aspx?395975&lt;/ref&gt; an erotic bondage version of the Human Bridge with a female co-performer, that dramatically fore-grounded the fact that the "feat" requires no hypnosis, which was neither induced nor pretended.

===Subjects===
In a stage hypnosis situation the "hypnotist" chooses their participants carefully. First they give the entire audience a few exercises to perform and plant ideas in their minds, such as:
*only intelligent people can be hypnotised
*only those who are open-minded to being hypnotised and willing to participate.

It has been alleged that these suggestions are designed to overcome the natural fear of trusting a stranger with the greater fear of becoming an object of ridicule as one who is unintelligent, unsociable, and joyless. However, whilst a self-proclaimed "sceptic", British stage hypnotist Alex Tsander argues that a more important reason for such admonitions is to filter out "pseudo-volunteers": those who only offer to participate in order to prove that they are as they see it "too intelligent" to respond, or who want to show that they can resist becoming hypnotised, with no intention to genuinely cooperate in achieving a positive result. Tsander advises that a hypnotist should state clearly at the outset that "anyone can resist being hypnotised, so to do so will prove nothing."&lt;ref name="Tsander, A 2006"/&gt;

Out of the crowd the hypnotist will spot people who appear trusting, extroverted and willing to put on a show. The hypnotist starts them off by having them imagine ordinary situations that they have likely encountered, like being cold or hot, hungry or thirsty then gradually builds to giving them a suggestion to do something that is totally out of character, such as tap dancing, singing like [[Elvis]] or clucking like a [[chicken]].

The desire to be the centre of attention, having an excuse to violate their own inner fear suppressors and the pressure to please, plus the expectation of the audience wanting them to provide some entertainment is usually enough to persuade an extrovert to do almost anything. In other words, the participants are persuaded to 'play along'. Yet, whilst this accounts for some situations, it does not accord with those where hecklers, uncooperative audiences and those who wish to "disprove" the hypnotist create a set of negative expectations, uncooperative atmosphere and opposition which the performer must use skill to overcome.

== Law ==
In some countries, there are laws and guidelines regarding stage hypnosis.

In the UK, the Hypnotism Act 1952 governs the use of hypnosis in public. The original Act was amended in 1976 and again in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/changes/affected/ukpga/1952/46&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996 the government released "model conditions" which were refined and revised after consultation with FESH and with medical and academic psychologists. Note that these have no legal force: they are suggested conditions which local authorities may or may not feel appropriate to impose or modify when regulating hypnosis.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fesh.co.uk/Law.htm&lt;/ref&gt; If stage hypnosis is performed at a public venue a permit (permission) must be acquired from the local authority and the local authority is advised to monitor the performance to ensure that all guidelines are followed. It is illegal to hold any form of stage hypnosis in a public venue (amongst other venues) unless the local authority has issued their consent for this.

In the accompanying circular announcing the revised model conditions in 1996&lt;ref&gt;Dipple, D. 1996. UK Home Office circular No39/1996&lt;/ref&gt; it was conceded that, as asserted by skeptical stage hypnotist Alex Tsander during the consultation process:

''"In practice volunteers do not react as if they truly believe that there is, for example, a giant spider behind them or a bomb under their chair."''&lt;ref&gt;Dipple, 1996, p6, sub-section "Previous Section 3(I)(Vi).&lt;/ref&gt;

This was a critical point of distinction and represents a formal recognition of the "as if" nature of behaviour in stage hypnotism in contradistinction to claims for its supposed subjective reality.

In the past, stage hypnosis has been banned in several countries in the world including Denmark and some states in the USA. Most of these countries have revoked these laws or don't enforce them.{{cn|date=June 2018}} In Israel, it remains illegal to perform any kind of hypnosis without a license given to doctors, dentists and psychologists.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}
In [[Belgium]], stage hypnosis has been forbidden since 1892;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/eli/loi/1892/05/30/1892053051/justel Loi sur l'hypnotisme, 30 mai 1892, article 1].&lt;/ref&gt; the law was mentioned in 2017 to force the cancellation of a spectacle by Messmer.&lt;ref&gt;Agence Belga, [http://www.lalibre.be/regions/hainaut/le-spectacle-de-messmer-annule-a-colfontaine-car-l-hypnose-en-spectacle-est-illegal-selon-la-loi-5a0b4a28cd70fa5a063cb55b Le spectacle de Messmer annulé à Colfontaine car l’hypnose en spectacle est illégal selon la loi], ''La Libre Belgique'' (14 novembre 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2924">The '''Symphony No. 72''' in [[D major]] (Hoboken 1/72) is a [[symphony]] by [[Joseph Haydn]].  The symphony was probably composed between [[1763 in music|1763]] and [[1765 in music|1765]].  The date of this composition is earlier than its number suggests. This work is not well chronologically placed in the Hoboken numbering system: it was composed fifteen to twenty years before the neighboring works.

==Instrumentation==
It is scored for [[flute]], two [[oboe]]s, [[bassoon]], four [[Horn (instrument)|horns]] and [[String section|strings]]. It is one of the few [[Classical period (music)|classical-era]] symphonies to include four horns rather than two.  This work is closely related to the [[Symphony No. 31 (Haydn)|Hornsignal Symphony]] because of its many soloistic horn passages&lt;ref name="oxford-jones"&gt;Oxford Composer Companions: Haydn, ed. David Wyn Jones, Oxford University Press, 2002. {{ISBN|0-19-866216-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is also related to the "Day Trilogy" symphonies [[Symphony No. 6 (Haydn)|6]], [[Symphony No. 7 (Haydn)|7]] and [[Symphony No. 8 (Haydn)|8]] because of the concertante passages for other instruments.&lt;ref name="apbrown"&gt;Brown, A. Peter, ''The Symphonic Repertoire'' (Volume 2). Indiana University Press ({{ISBN|025333487X}}), pp. 84-86 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Movements==
#[[Tempo#Italian_tempo_markings|Allegro]]
#[[Tempo#Italian_tempo_markings|Andante]], {{music|time|6|8}}
#[[Minuet|Menuet]] &amp; Trio, {{music|time|3|4}}
#Finale: [[Tempo#Italian_tempo_markings|Andante]] (Thema. Var. I–VI), {{music|time|2|4}} — [[Tempo#Italian_tempo_markings|Presto]], {{music|time|6|8}}

The horns are silent in the second movement.  In their place are solo passages for flute and violin.&lt;ref name="hcrl-chronicle-v1"&gt;HC Robbins Landon, ''Haydn: Chronicle and Works'', 5 vols, (Bloomington and London: Indiana University Press, 1976– ) v. 1, ''Haydn: the Early Years, 1732–1765''&lt;/ref&gt;

The minuet begins and ends with the same phrase ''piano'' with the ending as an echo.  The strings are silent in the trio which is scored for all the winds minus the flute.&lt;ref name="apbrown"/&gt;

The finale is a set of marching variations that features many soloists accompanied by strings.  The first variation features solo flute, the second a solo cello, the third a solo violin and the fourth a solo [[violone]].  The fifth variation is scored for oboe, two horns and strings while the sixth variation is for flute, oboe, bassoon, four horns and strings.  The movement concludes with a Presto [[coda (music)|coda]] in {{music|time|6|8}} and featuring a final horn flourish.&lt;ref name="hcrl-chronicle-v1"/&gt;

==History of Teatr Tworzenia (The Theater of Creation)== 
In the years 2006-2010 - the productions of The Theater of Creation were based on the basis of [[monographs]] and [[performative]] activities of Pijarowski (Scream Nudity, Di Logos Moon Di, Frozen in Monitoring) [[Warsaw]], [[London]] and [[Prague]].&lt;ref name="information about TT"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pawlewicz|first1=Jakub|last2=Pijarowski|first2=Jarosław|title=OFF – Życie bez dotacji|date=2015|publisher=Arcanus &amp; ICB Polska|location=Bydgoszcz|isbn=978-83-88079-33-7|page=12|ref=information about TT}}&lt;/ref&gt; The turning point has become monumental a theatrical-musical spectacle entitled "Sound Castle" from the series:"Castles of Sound"; Realized at [[Golub-Dobrzyń Castle]] in 2011.&lt;ref name="Information about Castle of Sound"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Przybył|first1=Marlena|title=awangardowi-tworcy-zbuduja-dla-siebie-i-dla-nas-zamek-dzwieku,id,t.html|url=http://www.pomorska.pl/wiadomosci/golub-dobrzyn/art/7235072,golubdobrzyn-awangardowi-tworcy-zbuduja-dla-siebie-i-dla-nas-zamek-dzwieku,id,t.html|website=pomorska.pl|accessdate=6 July 2017|ref=Information about Castle of Sound}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants included: Jorgos Skolias - initiator "The Sound of Peace", drummer Sławomir Ciesielski, Boguslaw Raatz, Timothy Sanford, visual artist: Xavier Bayle, Lukasz Wodyński and others.
Another great form was the first Polish avant-garde [[Oratorio]] "Terrarium" realized with [[Józef Skrzek]] &lt;ref name="Information about artist cooperation"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Skrzek|first1=Józef|title=Terrarium – Józef Skrzek &amp; Jarosław Pijarowski|url=http://skrzek.com/news/terrarium-jozef-skrzek-jaroslaw-pijarowski|website=skrzek.com|publisher=Skrzek|accessdate=6 July 2017|ref=Information about artist cooperation}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Saint Andrew Bobola's Church in Bydgoszcz]].&lt;ref name="Information about oratorio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Information about "Terrarium"|url=http://terrarium.art.pl/|website=terrarium.art.pl|publisher=Brain Active Records|accessdate=6 July 2017|ref=Information about oratorio - Terrarium}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Archdukes Albert and Isabella Visiting a Collector's Cabinet''''' is a 17th-century Flemish collaborative painting, now regarded as by [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]] and [[Hieronymus Francken II]].  It is part of the collection of [[The Walters Art Museum]] in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]].

Archdukes [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria|Albert]] and [[Isabella Clara Eugenia|Isabella]] jointly ruled the [[Spanish Netherlands]] in the beginning of the 17th century and were considered patrons of the arts.  Until the death of Albert in 1621, the area of Flanders enjoyed peace and prosperity.  This type of painting known as a ''constkamer'', gallery painting or a depiction of a collector's cabinet was popular during this time in Flanders.  The painting is deemed a collaborative effort between the artists Jan Brueghel the Elder and Hieronymus Francken II.  It had been attributed previously to Hieronymus Francken II's brother [[Frans Francken II]] and [[Adriaan van Stalbemt|Adriaen van Stalbemt]] to whom is attributed a similar work which is now in the collection at the [[Prado]] in [[Madrid]].&lt;ref name=Zafran&gt;{{cite book|last=Zafran|first=Eric M.|title=Fifty old master paintings from the Walters Art Gallery|year=1988|publisher=Trustees of the Walters Art Gallery|location=Baltimore, Md.|isbn=0-911886-34-6|pages=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sot&gt;[http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2014/old-master-british-paintings-evening-l14033/lot.57.html Hieronymus Francken (II), ''A Collector's Cabinet''] at Sotheby’s.  The Sotheby's expert believes on the basis of Ursula Härting's analysis that the painting in the Prado should also be attributed to Hieronymus Francken II&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
[[Image:Jan Brueghel the Elder - Flowers in a Wooden Vessel - Google Art Project.jpg|left|thumb|''Bouquet''. Jan Brueghel the Elder]]
The painting depicts a large room in which many persons and various art and other objects are present.  An unknown Flemish collector accompanies Isabella (seated) and her husband, Albert, who stands behind her.  The composition likely does not represent closely any actual occasion.  The walls are covered by paintings by Flemish artists and there are also numerous sculptures including the bronze ''Allegory of Architecture'' by [[Giambologna]].&lt;ref name="The Walters Art Museum"&gt;[http://art.thewalters.org/detail/14623/ The Walters Art Museum - The Archdukes Albert and Isabella Visiting a Collector's Cabinet]&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting contains representations of the wonders of the natural world (animals, plants, and minerals), along with examples of human creativity (painting and sculpture), and attributes of the five senses.  As such the composition represents the early phase of the genre of collector's cabinets.  During this early ‘encyclopaedic’ phase, the genre reflected the culture of curiosity of that time, when art works, scientific instruments, naturalia and artificialia were equally the object of study and admiration and the cabinets depicted are populated by persons who were as interested in discussing scientific instruments as in admiring paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Marr (2010), 'The Flemish 'Pictures of Collections' Genre: An Overview', Intellectual History Review, 20: 1, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting propped against the chair at the center, ''Allegory of Iconoclasm'' depicts an ass, a cat, a fool, and an ape (symbols of ignorance and evil) destroying musical instruments, paintings, and scientific instruments.  The painting over the mantel depicts an allegory of Painting being rescued by Wisdom and Fame from Ignorance.  The dog, on the left side, appears to have two heads which is a result of the underpainting coming through the surface.&lt;ref name="Zafran"/&gt;  The globe on the table at the left is one of [[Cornelis Drebbel|Cornelis Drebbels']] attempts at a perpetual-motion clock.  The large vase of flowers, at the far left corner, is Jan Brueghel's contribution to the painting.  The flower arrangement is crowned by a large sunflower (''[[Helianthus annuus]]''), an American flower which can grow to 14 feet tall and turns toward the sun.  A recent arrival in Europe,  the flower had been illustrated in botanical books, but this is its earliest inclusion in a painting.  It is shown turning toward Albert and Isabella instead of toward the sun.&lt;ref name="The Walters Art Museum"/&gt;

==Interpretation==
The artworks within the painting such as the ''Allegory of Iconoclasm'' and the painting above the mantel representing Painting saved from Ignorance are references to the [[iconoclasm]] of the [[Beeldenstorm]] that had raged in the Low Countries in the 16th century.  The reference offered by the ''Allegory of Iconoclasm'' to the iconoclasm of the preceding century provides the meaning for the larger picture: the arts will be protected (as shown by the presence of soldiers in the open door) and flourish under the rule of the archdukes.&lt;ref name="Zafran"/&gt;&lt;ref name=sim&gt;James Simpson, ''Under the Hammer: Iconoclasm in the Anglo-American Tradition'', Oxford University Press, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  The sunflower turning toward Albert and Isabella symbolizes the way that the arts will grow and blossom in the light and warmth of princely patronage.&lt;ref name="The Walters Art Museum"/&gt;

==Off the Wall==
In 2012 ''The Archdukes Albert and Isabella Visiting a Collector's Cabinet'' featured in ''Off the Wall'', an open-air exhibition on the streets of [[Baltimore]], Maryland.  A reproduction of the painting, the original is part of [[The Walters Art Museum]] collection, will be on display at Avenue Antiques.&lt;ref name="Off the Wall"&gt;[http://thewalters.org/offthewall/ Walters Art Museum - Off the Wall] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119005400/http://thewalters.org/offthewall/ |date=2012-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The National Gallery in London began the concept of bringing art out of doors in 2007 and the Detroit Institute of Art introduced the concept in the U.S.. The ''Off the Wall'' reproductions of the Walters' paintings are done on weather-resistant vinyl and include a description of the painting and a QR code for smart phones.&lt;ref name="The Baltimore Sun"&gt;Smith, T., Walters Art Museum goes of the wall, ''The Baltimore Sun'', September 11, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Hound of Florence: A Novel''''' ({{lang-de|link=no|Der Hund von Florenz}}) is a 1923 novel written by [[Felix Salten]]. It is best known today for partly inspiring (and even mentioned in) the 1959 [[Walt Disney Pictures]] film, ''[[The Shaggy Dog (1959 film)|The Shaggy Dog]]'', as well as a sequel and remakes. The novel was first translated into English in 1930 by [[Huntley Paterson]], and the translation has illustrations by [[Kurt Wiese]].

''The Hound of Florence'' is an adventure story for young readers, set in early eighteenth-century [[Austria]] and Italy. The adolescent Lukas Grassi has lost his parents and lives in [[Vienna]] in great poverty, longs for his native Italy, and would like to study art in [[Florence]]. By magic, his wish is granted, but every other day he must take the form of a dog, Kambyses,&lt;ref&gt;In the English translation, the names are spelled "Lucas Grassi" and "Cambyses."&lt;/ref&gt; that belongs to the Archduke Ludwig; and alternating daily between human and canine form, he travels from Vienna to Florence along with the Archduke's troops, and there has to lead a unique double life. This is the only book of Salten in which [[supernatural]] elements occur, and they may show influence of [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Ehness | first=Jürgen | title=Felix Saltens erzählerisches Werk: Beschreibung und Deutung | location=Frankfurt am Main | publisher=Peter Lang | date=2002 | isbn=3-631-38178-6 | page=221 | language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book has some "overtly" autobiographical background. In 1890s the journalist Salten had become a friend and confidant of the Austrian archduke [[Archduke Leopold Ferdinand of Austria|Leopold Ferdinand]], and in his novel, Salten makes use of his experiences with the archduke and his brothers. He carried the material for twenty-five years before he dared to write the story. In 1907 he mentioned [[Arthur Schnitzler]] that he was then about to finish the manuscript. However it was not until 1921 when the manuscript was completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Eddy |first=Beverley Driver |date=2010 |title=Felix Salten: Man of Many Faces |location=Riverside (Ca.) |publisher=Ariadne Press |pages=33, 87–89, 131, 195–196, 204–205 |isbn=978-1-57241-169-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain recurring motifs in Saltens œuvre appear also in this book: the deep cleavage between the very rich and the very poor, and the critique of the [[nobility]].&lt;ref&gt;Ehness (2002), p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Salten's biographer Beverley Driver Eddy, the strength of ''The Hound of Florence'' lies in the depiction of the dog Kambyses – a "brilliant portrayal of a dog's character."&lt;ref&gt;Eddy (2010), p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; Salten himself was a passionate dog lover and kept dogs most of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Eddy (2010), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Hound of Florence'' is written as one piece. There are no chapter divisions. The 1920s German-language editions, set in [[Fraktur]], however use an embellished dash to divide the text into large sections,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Salten | first=Felix | title=Der Hund von Florenz | location=Wien | publisher=Herz-Verlag | date=1923 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 1980s edition uses [[asterisk]]s for that purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Salten | first=Felix | title=Der Hund von Florenz | location=Stuttgart | publisher=Klett-Cotta | isbn=3-608-95400-7 | series=Cotta's Bibliothek der Moderne, 42 | year=1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ending of the book differs greatly in the original language and in the English translation. The German-language version ends in [[tragedy]]: the archduke stabs the dog to death, killing Lukas, and his body is disposed of. In the English translation, a wholly new ending of six more pages&lt;ref&gt;From page 230 on, the English translation diverts from and expands the German text.&lt;/ref&gt; has been written: Lukas survives, gets medication and is united with the [[courtesan]]. Currently it is not known if the alternate ending is authorized.

The English-language edition of ''The Hound of Florence'' was out of print for a long time. Only 2014 was a new edition published, this time illustrated by [[Richard Cowdrey]], using the alternate ending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Salten | first=Felix | title=The Hound of Florence | location=New York | publisher=Aladdin | year=2014 | isbn=978-1-4424-8749-9 | others=Illustrated by Richard Cowdrey }}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel was translated into [[French language|French]] in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Salten | first=Felix | title=Le chien de Florence | location=Bruxelles | publisher=Éditions de la Paix | year=1952 | others=Traduit de l’allemand par Maurice Muller-Straus | language=French }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Finnish language|Finnish-language]] edition from 2016 includes both endings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Salten | first=Felix | title=Koiramme Firenzessä | location=Helsinki | publisher=Books on Demand GmbH | date=2016 | isbn=978-952-330-150-4 | language=Finnish | translator=Markus Lång }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Knickerbocker''''', or '''''New-York Monthly Magazine''''', was a [[literary magazine]] of [[New York City]], founded by [[Charles Fenno Hoffman]] in 1833, and published until 1865. Its long-term editor and publisher was [[Lewis Gaylord Clark]], whose "Editor's Table" column was a staple of the magazine.

The circle of writers who contributed to the magazine and populated its cultural milieu are often known as the "Knickerbocker writers" or the "[[Knickerbocker Group]]". The group included such authors as [[William Cullen Bryant]], [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]], [[James Russell Lowell]] and many others.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Callow, James T. ''Kindred Spirits: Knickerbocker Writers and American Artists, 1807–1855''. Chapel Hill: [[The University of North Carolina Press]], 1967: 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Knickerbocker'' was devoted to the fine arts in particular with occasional news, editorials and a few full-length biographical sketches.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Callow 1967, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine was one of the earliest literary vehicles for communication about the United States' "vanishing wilderness." As such, ''The Knickerbocker'' may be considered one of the earliest proto-environmental magazines in the United States.&lt;ref name=nash&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nash |first1=Roderick F |year=2001 |title=Wilderness and the American Mind |edition=4th |location=New Haven |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |pages=97–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Fenno Hoffman]] was the founding editor of ''The Knickerbocker'' in 1833, though he helmed only three issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pattee |first1=Fred Lewis|title=The First Century of Literature: 1770–1870 |location=New York |publisher=[[Cooper Square Publishers]] |year=1966 |page=493}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoffman turned the magazine over to Timothy Flint, who changed the original name ''The Knickerbacker'' to ''The Knickerbocker.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Charles Fenno Hoffman|last=Barnes|first=Homer|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1930|isbn=|location=New York|pages=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flint then sold the magazine to [[Lewis Gaylord Clark]], who bought it in April 1834 and served as editor until 1861.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Perry.

New York: Harvest Book, 1956: 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1840, ''The Knickerbocker'' was the most influential literary publication of its time.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1956, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; The year before, [[Washington Irving]] had reluctantly joined the staff at a salary of $2,000 a year and would stay on staff until 1841.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1956, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Irving disliked magazine work, specifically because of its monthly deadlines and space constraints. However, in his "[[The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent.|Geoffrey Crayon]]" persona, he justified his choice in his debut issue: "I am tired... of writing volumes... there is too much preparation, arrangement, and parade... I have thought, therefore, of securing to myself a snug corner in some periodical work, where I might, as it were, loll at my ease in my elbow chair."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=Brian Jay |title=Washington Irving: An American Original |location=New York |publisher=Arcade |year=2008 |page=333 |isbn=978-1-55970-836-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The circle of writers who contributed to the magazine and populated its cultural milieu are often known as the "Knickerbocker writers" or the "Knickerbocker Group". The group included such authors as [[Washington Irving]],  William Cullen Bryant, [[James Kirke Paulding]], [[Gulian Crommelin Verplanck]], [[Fitz-Greene Halleck]], [[Joseph Rodman Drake]], [[Robert Charles Sands]], [[Lydia M. Child]], [[Nathaniel Parker Willis]], and [[Epes Sargent (poet)|Epes Sargent]].&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Randy F. ''The Almanac of American Letters''.

''The Knickerbocker'' was one of the earliest publications of its type to pay its contributing writers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

At the time, "Knickerbocker" was a term for Manhattan's aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Riis|first=Jacob A.|title=How the other half lives: studies among the tenements of New York|year=2009|publisher=Digireads.com Pub.|location=[[Lawrence, Kansas]]|isbn=1-4209-2503-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knickerbocker was also an imaginary personage created by [[Washington Irving]] to promote his new book at the time, ''A History of New-York from the Beginning of the World to the End of the Dutch Dynasty.'' The work was a satire of both history books and the politics of the time. Irving published the work in 1809 under the pseudonym "[[Diedrich Knickerbocker]]."  Prior to the release of his book though, Irving placed a series of missing person adverts in New York newspapers concerning Diedrich Knickerbocker, convincing the public that he was a legitimate historian. However, though people soon realized it was a [[hoax]], Diedrich Knickerbocker became a much-loved character and legend for those of the city of New York.&lt;ref name=jones&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Brian Jay|title=Washington Irving: an American original|year=2007|publisher=Arcade|location=New York|isbn=978-1-55970-836-4|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is also the namesake of the New York basketball team, [[New York Knicks|The Knicks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Wolfert's Roost and Miscellanies by Washington Irving.|year=2008|publisher=MobileReference.com|location=Boston|isbn=1-60501-996-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Knickerbacker Magazine'' was started in January 1833 with its first issue containing a supposed conversation with Diedrich Knickerbocker. In the interview he “readily forgave the liberty taken with his name in consideration of our having restored it to its ancient spelling.” This refers to the change from ''Knickerbocker'' to ''Knickerbacker''. However, the second issue was published with the title changed to ''Knickerbocker'' including another conversation with Diedrich Knickerbocker in which he says "I wish thee to restore my name to its original spelling as it stands in my celebrated History; so as fortune has given immortal glory to what some would consider a discreditable mistake I will even take it as it came and add the 'O' to the end of time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Knickerbocker|first=Howard|title=Knickerbocker History (Some Thoughts On The Origins Of The Name)|url=http://www.knic.com/Kn_Hist.htm|work=Knickerbocker Genealogy|accessdate=4 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121204190544/http://www.knic.com/Kn_Hist.htm|archivedate=4 December 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Knickerbocker, Volume 2 Volumes 349-360 of American periodical series, 1800-1850|year=1833|publisher=Peabody, 1833|location=New York, New York|asin=B002YD7K36|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4hLZAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=December 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==

''The Knickerbocker'' was devoted to the fine arts in particular with occasional news and editorials. Full-length biographical sketches were also printed on such artists as [[Gilbert Stuart]], [[Hiram Powers]], [[Horatio Greenough]], and [[Frederick Styles Agate]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;
[[File:Edward Hitchcock.jpg|150px|thumbnail|right|Edward Hitchcock]]
According to environmental historian, [[Roderick Nash]], ''The Knickerbocker'' was one of the earliest literary vehicles for communication about the United States' "vanishing wilderness", including serialized articles by [[Thomas Cole]] and [[Francis Parkman|Francis Parkman, Jr.]]&lt;ref name="nash"/&gt; As such, ''The Knickerbocker'' may be considered one of the earliest proto-environmental magazines in the United States.
''The Knickerbocker'' printed the earliest-known reference to the joke "[[Why did the chicken cross the road?]]"&lt;ref&gt;''The Knickerbocker, or The New York Monthly''. March 1847: 283.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1800s, the [[Edward Hitchcock|Reverend Edward Hitchcock]] came across a set of what appeared to him to be giant bird tracks. These later turned out to be [[Hitchcock Ichnological Cabinet|reptile tracks]], however they nonetheless inspired him to write a poem entitled "The Sandstone Bird" involving the reanimation of a great sandstone bird by a female mystic. Later published in ''The Knickerbocker'' by Hitchcock, under the pseudonym Poetaster, this is widely believed to have been the first [[Ichnology|ichnological poem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pemberton|first=S.

== Environmental impact ==

Eric Kaufman, a professor of politics commented in his paper on "American Naturalistic Nationalism" that the "naturalistic aesthetic first took root among writers in New England and New York. These intellectuals, connected by New York literary periodicals like ''Knickerbocker Magazine'' ... responded in several ways to the new naturalistic sensibility" the influence of which can be seen in many of their published works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bender |first1=Thomas |year=1987 |title=New York Intellect: A History of Intellectual Life in New York City, 1750 to the Beginnings of Our Own Time |location=New York |publisher=[[Alfred A.

Some famous works first published in ''The Knickerbocker'' that have influenced environmental thought include:[[File:Oregon Trail reenactment - NARA - 286054.tif|thumbnail|left|On the Oregon Trail]]
* ''[[The Oregon Trail: Sketches of Prairie and Rocky-Mountain Life|The Oregon Trail]]'', by Francis Parkman - An 1846 story of exploring the West published in 21 installments.  It portrays heroic frontiersmen, struggling immigrants, and savage Native Americans. Though it is a romantic work, Parkman does not shy from the violence of the frontier, providing his audience a more realistic view of the frontier than some of his contemporaries. However, he does place emphasis on the beauty of the conquered nature over the wild.&lt;ref name="Jacobs 1992 341–356"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jacobs|first=Wilbur R.|title=Francis Parkman: Naturalist-Environmental Savant|journal=Pacific Historical Review|year=1992|volume=61|issue=3|pages=341–356|doi=10.2307/3640591|jstor=3640591}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Scalp-Hunter," by Francis Parkman - A short story of 1845, chronicling the young Parkman's experiences in the American wilderness. The story contains frenzied hunting scenes, dangerous rock climbing and his daring ascent of a steep, crumbling ravine. The story romanticized nature, transforming harrowing experiences into wilderness adventures.&lt;ref name="Jacobs 1992 341–356"/&gt;
* "Hints on Human Nature," by One of the People (anonymous) - December 1845 piece that compared humans with animals. It suggested that "man shares many of his intellectual and social capabilities with the lower animals. the beaver also laid up stores, the ants also established communities and governments. It was, furthermore the nature of all animals to love, hate, sorrow and rejoice. There were differences to be sure. If dogs and men alike stole, dogs did not pray to their Maker nor take his name in vain since man did both, it was fair to concede that he possessed a conscience...and the general anti-intellectualism of the piece was reflected in the remark that little could be learned about human nature from books or schools or even colleges." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Curti|first=Merle|title=Human Nature in American Thought|journal=Political Science Quarterly|year=1953|volume=68|issue=3|pages=354–375|jstor=2145605|doi=10.2307/2145605}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Washington Irving#Final years and death|Wolfert's Roost]]'', by Washington Irving - A collection of short stories and essays, reprinted in a single volume in 1855, covering a variety of topics including: man's relationship with the land, man's relationship with man and the natural society. This work is the result of Irving's travels and research across the country and his portrayal of the beautiful nature he saw.&lt;ref name=jones /&gt; It has been said however, that this work is rather simplistic and fails to provide any true analysis of the environment.&lt;ref name=jones /&gt;
* "Prometheus," by James Russell Lowell, among the first American poets to rival the popularity of British poets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=James Russell Lowell|url=http://www.poemhunter.com/james-russell-lowell/|accessdate=26 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This poem "proclaims the perfectibility of the human and the supremacy of Beauty" and thus reveals a Transcendentalist influence. The relative simplicity and fluidity of his writing style appealed to families as well as professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bertonneau|first=Thomas F.|title=James Russell Lowell|url=http://www.firstprinciplesjournal.com/articles.aspx?article=544&amp;theme=home&amp;loc=b|accessdate=26 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work provided readers with a contemporary view of nature through the lens of a classical text.

[[File:Cole Thomas Mount Aetna from Taormina 1844.jpg|thumbnail|right|View of Mount Etna by Thomas Cole]]

* "Sicilian Scenery and Antiquities," by Thomas Cole - A sketch of an Italian rural landscape where Cole vacationed. This article, published in 1844, presents the Sicilian landscape through a painter's eyes and is in a way an explanation of his painting on the same subject. It is a romantic portrayal of nature with hints of human influence that showed readers the beauty of the natural landscape, but also emphasizes the inextricably intertwined past and futures of man and nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hoffman|first=Charles Fenno|journal=The Knickerbocker: Or, New-York Monthly Magazine|year=1844|volume=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The meaning of the name itself is quite simple: the whale was often sighted in the vicinity of the island of Mocha, and "Dick" was merely a generic name like "Jack" or "Tom." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Madden|first=J|title=The Origin of the Name "Moby Dick"|url=http://www.melville.org/mobyname.htm|accessdate=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:David Teniers the Younger - modello for Theatrum Pictorium 1673.jpg|thumb|Modello for the frontispiece for the ''Theatrum Pictorium'', by Teniers]]
'''''Theatrum Pictorium''''', or ''Theatre of Painting'', is a short-hand name of a book published in the 1660s by [[David Teniers the Younger]] for his employer, the [[Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria]]. It was a catalog of 243 Italian paintings in the Archduke's collection of over 1300 paintings, with engravings of the paintings taken from small models that Teniers had personally prepared. A second edition with page numbers was published in 1673.

During the years 1646-1656  Leopold Wilhelm was governor of the Netherlands and formed one of the greatest art collections of his age. Teniers effectively became its curator after the death of his predecessor [[Jan van den Hoecke]] in 1651. Leopold Wilhelm’s collection came to hold works by [[Hans Holbein the Elder]], [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], [[Jan van Eyck]], [[Raphael]], [[Giorgione]], [[Paolo Veronese]] and more than 15 works by [[Titian]]. Teniers made a list of the painters in the collection as part of the forward to his 1673 catalog:
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Theatrum Pictorium gri 33125009347911 0012.jpg
File:Theatrum Pictorium gri 33125009347911 0013.jpg
&lt;/gallery&gt;

This list is an important document that reflects the contemporary taste in paintings in Brussels at that time. Of all the painters, the names [[Magdalena Woutiers]] and [[Madonna Fitta de Milano]] are the only women whose work is documented as being in the Archduke's collection. No matter how illustrious the name however, only works by the better known Italian painters were chosen to be engraved for illustrations. At the end of his governorship, the Archduke and his collection moved to the [[Stallburg]]. This archducal collection now forms the heart of Vienna’s [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]].

Before moving to Vienna in 1659, Archduke Leopold Wilhelm formed his art collection in [[Brussels]], where [[David Teniers the Younger]] painted views of the most prized possessions of his Brussels gallery. He painted several of these in various compositions which are now spread among various collections:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.khm.at/en/visit/collections/picture-gallery/history-of-the-collection/ History of the collections] of the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Teniers employed a team of 12 engravers for reproducing the 243 paintings in the Theatrum. He produced small copies in oil of each of the chosen paintings, issuing these as models to his engravers and 120 of which were auctioned by the estate of [[John Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough]] in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7BU-36sK16MC&amp;pg=PA130 Fifteenth- to Eighteenth-century European Paintings in the Robert Lehman Collection: France, Central Europe, The Netherlands, Spain and Great Britain], by [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], Charles Sterling&lt;/ref&gt; Teniers’ painted copies measuring approximately 17 x 25&amp;nbsp;cm are now spread among various collections. The [[Courtauld Institute of Art]] Gallery holds 14 of these works, the largest group in any public collection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.codart.com/exhibitions/details/1139/ David Teniers and the Theatre of Painting, 19 October 2006 – 21 January 2007] exhibition press release on [[codart]]&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 12 engravers, the five who contributed most were [[Jan van Troyen]] with 56, [[Lucas Vorsterman the Younger]] with 52, [[Pieter van Lisebetten]] 40, [[Theodoor van Kessel]] 27, and [[Coryn Boel|Coryn]] or Quirin Boel 25.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hnanews.org/archive/2007/04/vegelin.html History of the project] on website for ''Historians of Netherlandish Art''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johannes Popels]] contributed five engravings.

==Surviving works==
The works listed in the book that survive are generally in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, while the modelli or small models for the engravings have been lost or are in other collections. The engravings and the modelli were inscribed with the dimensions of the original paintings, though their characteristics were often adjusted to take advantage of the maximum illustration possibilities of the album page size. The dimensions were in the form "4 alta 3 lata", which means 4 palm-widths high and 3 palm-widths wide, such as the case with the engraving after [[Francesco Bassano the Younger|Bassano's]] ''Boy with a Flute'':

'''''Travesti''''' (literally "disguised" in French) is a theatrical term referring to the portrayal of a character in an [[opera]], [[Play (theatre)|play]], or [[ballet]] by a performer of the opposite sex.  Depending on sources, the term may be given as '''travesty''',&lt;ref&gt;*Budden, Julian (1992), 'Travesty' in ''The [[New Grove Dictionary of Opera]]'', p 799&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Anne Hermann|title=Travesty and Transgression: Transvestism in Shakespeare, Brecht, and Churchill|journal=Theatre Journal|year=1989|volume=41|issue=2|pages=133–154|doi=10.2307/3207855|url=http://jstor.org/stable/3207855|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''''travesti''''',&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Kennedy, Michael]] (2006), ''The Oxford Dictionary of Music'', p 899&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;*Warrack, John and West, Ewan (1992), ''The Oxford Dictionary of Opera'', p 716&lt;/ref&gt; or '''''en travesti'''''. The ''Oxford Essential Dictionary of Foreign Terms in English'' explains the origin of the latter term as "pseudo-[[French language|French]]",&lt;ref&gt;According to Speake and LaFlaur (1999), the phrase itself is not recorded in French, and derives from the misinterpretation of ''travesti'' (the [[past participle]] of the French verb ''travestir'') as a noun.&lt;/ref&gt; although French sources from the mid-19th century have used the term, e.g. ''Bibliothèque musicale du Théâtre de l'opéra'' (1876),  ''La revue des deux mondes '' (1868), and have continued the practice into the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example Duron (2008) p. 231 and Coste (2004) pp. 26 and 141&lt;/ref&gt;

For social reasons, female roles were played by boys or men in many early forms of theatre, and ''travesti'' roles continued to be used in several types of context even after actresses became accepted on the stage. The popular British theatrical form of the [[pantomime]] traditionally contains a role for a "[[principal boy]]", a [[breeches role]] played by a young woman, and also one or more [[pantomime dame]]s, female comic roles played by men.  Similarly, in the formerly popular genre of [[Victorian burlesque]], there were usually one or more breeches roles.

==Men in female roles==
[[File:Farinelli female caricature edited.jpg|thumb|170 px|left|The famous castrato [[Farinelli]] caricatured in one of his female roles]]
Until the late 17th century in England and the early 19th century in the [[Papal States]]—although not elsewhere in Europe—women were conventionally portrayed by male actors (usually adolescents) in [[drag (clothing)|drag]] because the presence of actual women on stage was considered immoral.

===In theatre===
As a [[boy player]], [[Alexander Cooke]] is thought to have created many of Shakespeare's principal female roles, as well as [[Agrippina the Elder|Agrippina]] in [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''[[Sejanus His Fall]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[F. E. Halliday]], ''A Shakespeare Companion 1564-1964'', Baltimore, Penguin, 1964; pp. 114-15.&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration of the monarchy]] in 1660, women began to appear on the English stage, although some female roles continued to be played by boys and young men, including romantic leads. [[Edward Kynaston]], whose roles included the title role in Ben Jonson's ''[[Epicoene, or the Silent Woman|Epicoene]]'' and Evadne in [[Francis Beaumont|Beaumont]] and [[John Fletcher (playwright)|Fletcher's]] ''[[The Maid's Tragedy]]'', was one of the last of the era's boy players.&lt;ref&gt;Howe (1992) p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

London's [[Shakespeare's Globe]] theatre, a modern reconstruction of the original [[Globe Theatre]], continues the practice of casting men in female Shakespearean roles. Toby Cockerell played Katherine of France in the theatre's opening production of ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'' in 1997,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/audience-plays-its-part-in-shakespeares-wooden-o-1254497.html "Audience plays its part in Shakespeare's wooden O"]. ''[[The Independent]]'',  7 June 1997&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Mark Rylance]] played Cleopatra in the 1999 production of ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/264171.stm "Meet Mr Cleopatra"]. [[BBC News]], 27 January 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

''Travesti'' roles for men are still to be found in British [[pantomime]], where there is at least one humorous (and usually older) female character traditionally played by a male actor, the [[pantomime dame]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2005/12/14/btpanto14.xml&amp;sSheet=/arts/2005/12/14/ixartleft.html "Panto's merriest widow"]. ''The Telegraph'', 14 December 2005, accessed 7 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===In opera===
[[Castrato|Castrati]], adult males with a female singing voice (usually produced by castration before puberty), appeared in the earliest operas &amp;ndash; initially in female roles. In the first performance of [[Monteverdi]]'s ''[[L'Orfeo|Orfeo]]'' in 1607 the roles of [[Eurydice]] and [[Proserpina]] were both sung by castrati. However, by 1680 the castrati had become the predominant singers for leading male roles as well. The use of castrati for both male and female roles was particularly strong in the [[Papal States]], where women were forbidden from public stage performances until the 19th century.

An exception to this practice was in 17th and 18th century French opera where it was traditional to use uncastrated male voices both for the hero and for malevolent female divinities and spirits.&lt;ref&gt;Senelick (2000) p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully]]'s 1686 opera ''[[Armide (Lully)|Armide]]'' the hero (Renaud) was sung by a [[haute-contre]] (a type of high [[tenor]] voice) while the female spirit of hatred (La Haine) was sung by a tenor. In [[Rameau]]'s 1733 ''[[Hippolyte et Aricie]]'', the hero ([[Hippolytus (mythology)|Hippolyte]]) was sung by an haute-contre, while the roles of the three [[Parcae|Fates]] and [[Tisiphone]] were scored for [[bass (voice type)|basses]] and tenors. The remaining female roles in both operas were sung by women. The title role of the vain but ugly marsh nymph in Rameau's ''[[Platée]]'' is also for an haute-contre.

Female roles in opera sung by men can still be found, although they are not common. The role of the witch in [[Engelbert Humperdinck (composer)|Humperdinck]]'s 1890 opera ''[[Hänsel und Gretel (opera)|Hänsel und Gretel]]'' was originally written for a [[mezzo-soprano]], but was sung by the tenor [[Philip Langridge]] in the [[Metropolitan Opera]]'s 2009 production directed by [[Richard Jones (director)|Richard Jones]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Metropolitan Opera]] (2009). [http://www.metoperafamily.org/metopera/news/interviews/detail.aspx?id=10678 "Sweet and Low-Down"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Azio Corghi]]'s 2005 opera ''Il dissoluto assolto'', which incorporates story elements from Mozart's ''[[Don Giovanni]]'', casts a [[counter-tenor]] in the role of the [[mannequin]] of Donna Elvira.&lt;ref&gt;Moiraghi, p. 324&lt;/ref&gt;

===In dance===
The portrayal of women by male dancers was very common in [[Renaissance]] court ballet&lt;ref&gt;Lee (2202) p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; and has continued into more modern times, although primarily restricted to comic or malevolent female characters. The use of male dancers for all the female roles in a ballet persisted well into the 18th century in the Papal States, when women dancers had long been taking these roles elsewhere in Italy. Abbé Jérôme Richard who travelled to Rome in 1762 wrote: "Female Dancers are not permitted on the stages in Rome. They substitute for them boys dressed as women and there is also a police ordinance that decreed they wear black bloomers."&lt;ref name = "HW38"&gt;quoted in Harris-Warrick (2005) p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Another French traveller that year, Joseph-Thomas, comte d'Espinchal, asked himself: "What impression can one have of ballet in which the prima ballerina is a young man in disguise with artificial feminine curves?"&lt;ref name = "HW38" /&gt;

In the original production of ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]'' in 1890, a male dancer, [[Enrico Cecchetti]], created the role of the evil fairy Carabosse, although the role has subsequently been danced by both men and women.&lt;ref&gt;Brillarelli (1995) p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Frederick Ashton]]'s 1948 choreography of  ''[[Cinderella (Ashton)|Cinderella]]'', [[Robert Helpmann]] and Ashton himself danced the roles of the two stepsisters. [[Ben Stevenson (dancer)|Ben Stevenson]] later continued the practice of casting male dancers as the stepsisters in his own choreography of the ballet.&lt;ref&gt;Upper (2004) p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; Other female ballet characters traditionally performed by male dancers are Old Madge, the village sorceress in ''[[La Sylphide]]'' and the Widow Simone in ''[[La fille mal gardée]]''.

==Women in male roles==
[[File:Eugénie Fiocre as a matador.jpg|thumb|180 px|The ballerina [[Eugénie Fiocre]] as a [[matador]] circa 1860]]
With the [[English Restoration|Restoration of Charles II]] in 1660 women started appearing on the English stage, both in the female roles that in Shakespeare's day had been portrayed by men and boys, and in male roles. It has been estimated that of the 375 plays produced in London between 1660 and 1700, nearly a quarter contained one or more roles for actresses dressed as men.&lt;ref&gt;See Howe (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst the 19th century actresses who made a mark in ''travesti'' roles were [[Mary Anne Keeley]] who portrayed Smike in the stage adaptation of ''[[Nicholas Nickleby]]'' and the robber [[Jack Sheppard]] in [[John Baldwin Buckstone|Buckstone]]'s play based on his life; [[Maude Adams]] who played [[Peter and Wendy|Peter Pan]] in the American premiere of [[J. M. Barrie|Barrie]]'s play and went on to play the role over 1,500 times;&lt;ref&gt;Harbin, Marra, and Schanke (2005) p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sarah Bernhardt]] who created the role of [[Napoleon II of France]] in [[Edmond Rostand]]'s ''[[L'Aiglon]]'', played [[Lorenzino de' Medici]] in [[Alfred de Musset|Musset]]'s ''Lorenzaccio'', Pelléas in [[Maurice Maeterlinck|Maeterlinck]]'s ''[[Pelléas and Mélisande]]'' and perhaps most famously played the title role in ''[[Hamlet]]''. In the [[Victorian era]], [[Victorian burlesque|musical burlesques]] generally included several breeches roles.  According to the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', although "an almost indispensable element of burlesque was the display of attractive women dressed in tights, often in travesty roles ... the plays themselves did not normally tend to indecency."&lt;ref&gt;[[Erich Schwandt|Schwandt, Erich]] et al. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/04381 "Burlesque",] ''Grove Music Online''. Oxford Music Online, accessed 3 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the specialists in these roles was [[Nellie Farren]] who created the title roles in numerous burlesques and pantomimes, including ''[[Robert the Devil (Gilbert)|Robert the Devil]]'', ''[[Little Jack Sheppard]]'' and ''[[Ruy Blas and the Blasé Roué]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Culme, John. [http://www.gabrielleray.150m.com/ArchiveTextF/NellieFarren.html Information "Nellie Farren (1848-1904) English burlesque actress"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012233616/http://www.gabrielleray.150m.com/ArchiveTextF/NellieFarren.html |date=12 October 2009 }} at Footlight Notes, 2003, accessed 8 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  In British [[pantomime]], which is still regularly performed, the young male protagonist or [[Principal boy]] is traditionally played by an actress in boy's clothes.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2007) pp. 117 and ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of women performing ''en travesti'' in operas became increasingly common in the early 19th century as [[castrato]] singers went out of fashion and were replaced by [[mezzo-soprano]]s or [[contralto]]s in the young masculine roles. For example, the title role of [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]]'s 1813 ''[[Tancredi]]'' was specifically written for a female singer. However, ''travesti'' mezzo-sopranos had been used earlier by both [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] and [[Mozart]], sometimes because a castrato was not available, or to portray a boy or very young man, such as Cherubino in ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]''. In 20th-century opera, composers continued to use women to sing the roles of young men, when they felt the mature tenor voice sounded wrong for the part. One notable example was [[Richard Strauss]], who used a mezzo-soprano for Octavian in ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'' and the Composer in ''[[Ariadne auf Naxos]]''.

From 1830 to 1850, female ballet dancers were increasingly seen in the ''[[corps de ballet]]'' portraying [[matador]]s, [[hussar]]s, and cavaliers, and even as the [[prima ballerina]]'s 'leading man', a practice which was to last well into the 20th century in France.&lt;ref&gt;Garafola (1985) p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Although both [[Fanny Elssler]] and her sister Thérèse danced ''travesti'' roles at the Paris Opera, Thérèse, who was very tall by the standards of the day, danced them more frequently, often partnering Fanny as her leading man.&lt;ref&gt;Foster (1998) p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; The French ballerina [[Eugénie Fiocre]], who created the role of Franz in ''[[Coppélia]]'',  was particularly known for her ''travesti'' performances.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1992) p. 257&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4241">'''Villagers Theatre''' is a [[community theater]] located in the municipal complex of [[Somerset, New Jersey]], United States. It was founded in 1960 and is still running today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Villagers Theatre celebrates 50 years |quote=It was started in 1960 by 20 theater enthusiasts. Mrs.  Van Middlesworth who owned the [[Colonial Farms]] restaurant, donated $500 ... |work=[[Community Courier]] |date=July 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group has a New Playwrights Series where unpublished plays are performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Villagers accepting scripts for series |url=http://suburban.gmnews.com/news/2008-10-09/bulletin_board/044.html |quote=Scripts must be original, unpublished works. All comedies, dramas and farces of professional quality are welcomed. There is no limit on cast size, although smaller casts (under eight characters) are preferred. Shows designed to be performed on one set, with an eye toward future community theatre productions, are also preferred. One-act plays and shorter scripts will be considered, in addition to full-length scripts. There are no restrictions for content or language. Musical plays will not be considered. |work=[[Sayreville Suburban]] |date=October 9, 2008 |accessdate=2010-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The theatre was founded in 1960 and began doing shows in the Van Middlesworth Barn. In 1979, the barn was sold, and a new barn was built. The new building opened in 1980, but closed in 1987 due to new [[fire code]] laws. Township citizens raised $250,000 to renovate the space, and the theatre re-opened in 1988.

==New Playwrights Series==
Every year, the theatre takes submissions of new plays by unheard of playwrights and presents staged readings of six new, original shows. Musicals are not accepted, due to the short rehearsal span and lack of time for actors to learn the music. The readings take place once a month from February to May, sometimes with two in one night.

==Major Productions==
In 2015, the theatre presented the world premiere of ''[[Mary Poppins (musical)|Mary Poppins Jr.]]'' for their Miniature Musical Makers program. (An acting class and performance program for children 8 to 13.)

Their January 2016 production of ''[[Fences (play)|Fences]]'' received high acclaim and was transferred to a [[Union County, New Jersey|Union County]] [[Black History Month]] festival.

==Education==
The theatre offers its Miniature Musical Makers program (MMM) for kids ages 9 through 13. MMM is a 12 week program that trains the kids in acting, singing, dancing, and production design, culminating in the performance of a full-length 1 to 2 hour show (with a one weekend run). There is also a teen ensemble, which is the same thing but for ages 14 to 17 and goes for 11 weeks. MMM costs $745 and the teen ensemble is $695. There is a $100 discount for early enrollment.

There is also a Summer Theatre Arts program, offering three different sessions for kids 6-8, 8-12, and 12-16. The program runs for three weeks and costs $850 for a full day program and $450 to go for a half day. The camp culminates in a performance.

==Awards==
The theatre has won numerous NJACT (New Jersey Association of Community Theatre) Perry Awards. Here are its previous awards:

'''2009'''
*Outstanding Lighting Design for a Musical for ''[[Jekyll &amp; Hyde (musical)|Jekyll &amp; Hyde]]''

[[File:Wh war room.jpg|thumb|upright|&lt;!--Wally Hedrick, ''War Room'', c. 1967, exterior view.--&gt; Installing Hedrick's ''War Room'' at [[Sonoma State University]] in 2002.]]
The '''''War Room''''' (1967/68–2002), by [[Wally Hedrick]] (1928–2003), consists of eight canvases approximately 5 feet wide and 11 feet tall, all painted a deep black. Hedrick referred to these canvases as "wounded veterans". These canvases are bolted together to create a freestanding cubic room that could be entered via a small door in one of the canvases, thus creating an architectural painting. The black painted surfaces of the canvases face inward and the backs of the canvases face outward. 

The ''War Room'' is an “environmental” painting; the viewer enters a small enclosure of painted blackness. The viewer is left to consider the encompassing darkness and contemplate the vacuity that this space creates. Hedrick refused to ignore the war and instead created a work of cultural and political significance. After the Vietnam War ended he repainted these canvases black in protest of the Gulf War in 1992 and the Iraqi war in 2002.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

During this time, Hedrick was accused of stealing paintings, including a canvas by [[Clyfford Still]], from the [[San Francisco Art Institute]], where he was teaching, then either painting them black or painting his own iconoclastic pictures over them.&lt;ref name=Selz89&gt;Peter Selz and Susan Landauer, Art of Engagement: Visual Politics in California and Beyond, UC Press, 2006, pg.89. &lt;/ref&gt;

The ''War Room'' is a significant item of Bay Area art history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Mass-appeal-Art-comes-at-visitors-from-all-2678761.php |last=Baker |first=Kenneth | title=Mass appeal / Art comes at visitors from all directions at the S.F.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7398">The '''Young Macedonian Literary Society''' was founded in 1891, in Sofia, together with its magazine [[Loza (magazine)|Loza]]. The society formed primarily as a scholarly and literary organization.

After a distinct Bulgarian state was established in 1878, Macedonia remained outside its borders. In the 1880s, the Bulgarian codificators rejected the idea of a Macedono-Bulgarian linguistic compromise, and chose eastern Bulgarian dialects as a basis for standard Bulgarian. One purpose of the Young Macedonian Literary Society magazine was to defend the [[Macedonian dialects]], and to have them more represented in the [[Bulgarian language]]. The articles were historical, cultural, and ethnographic.

An article in the official [[People's Liberal Party]] newspaper "Svoboda" blamed the organization for lack of loyalty and separatism. The Society rejected these accusations for linguistic and national separatism,&lt;ref&gt;"Loza", Issue 1, p.91-96&lt;/ref&gt; and in a response to "Svoboda" claimed that their "society is far from any separatist thoughts, in which we were accused and to say that the ideal of Young Macedonian Literary Society is not separatism, but unity of the entire Bulgarian nation".&lt;ref&gt;"Loza", Issue 1, p.186&lt;/ref&gt; Still some linguists identify this magazine as an early platform of Macedonian ''linguistic separatism'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.uchicago.edu/~vfriedm/Articles/003Friedman75.pdf "Macedonian Language and Nationalism During the Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries"], Victor Friedman, p. 286&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.mk/books?id=I9p_m7oXQ00C&amp;pg=PA145&amp;dq=Macedonians+Loza&amp;hl=mk&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7xsiUYvzAqf14QTb9IGwAw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Macedonians%20Loza&amp;f=false Nationalism, Globalization, and Orthodoxy: The Social Origins of Ethnic Conflict in the Balkans], Victor Roudometof, Roland Robertson, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors considered themselves [[Macedonian Bulgarians]].&lt;ref&gt;"Though Loza adhered to the Bulgarian position on the issue of the Macedonian Slavs' ethnicity, it also favored revising the Bulgarian orthography by bringing it closer to the dialects spoken in Macedonia." Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Macedonia, Dimitar Bechev, Scarecrow Press, 2009, {{ISBN|0810862956}}, p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Young Macedonian Literary Association's Journal, Loza, was also categorical about the Bulgarian character of Macedonia: "A mere comparison of those ethnographic features which characterize the Macedonians (we understand: Macedonian Bulgarians), with those which characterize the free Bulgarians, their juxtaposition with those principles for nationality which we have formulated above, is enough to prove and to convince everybody that the nationality of the Macedonians cannot be anything except Bulgarian." Freedom or Death, The Life of Gotsé Delchev, Mercia MacDermott, The Journeyman Press, London &amp; West Nyack, 1978, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"During the 20th century, Slavo-Macedonian national feeling has shifted. At the beginning of the 20th century, Slavic patriots in Macedonia felt a strong attachment to Macedonia as a multi-ethnic homeland. They imagined a Macedonian community uniting themselves with non-Slavic Macedonians... Most of these Macedonian Slavs also saw themselves as Bulgarians. By the middle of the 20th. century, however Macedonian patriots began to see Macedonian and Bulgarian loyalties as mutually exclusive. Regional Macedonian nationalism had become ethnic Macedonian nationalism. ''Region, Regional Identity, and Regionalism in Southeastern Europe'', Ethnologia Balkanica Series, Klaus Roth, Ulf Brunnbauer, LIT Verlag Münster, 2010, {{ISBN|3825813878}}, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; 
As a whole, the Lozars demonstrated both Bulgarian and Macedonian loyalty, and combined their Bulgarian nationalism with Macedonian regional and cultural identity.&lt;ref&gt;"Macedonian historiography often refers to the group of young activists who founded in Sofia an association called the ‘Young Macedonian Literary Society’. In 1892, the latter began publishing the review Loza [The Vine], which promoted certain characteristics of Macedonian dialects.

At the same time, the activists, called ‘Lozars’ after the name of their review, ‘purified’ the Bulgarian orthography from some rudiments of the Church Slavonic. They expressed likewise a kind of Macedonian patriotism attested already by the first issue of the review: its materials greatly emphasized identification with Macedonia as a genuine ‘fatherland’. In any case, it is hardly surprising that the Lozars demonstrated both Bulgarian and Macedonian loyalty: what is more interesting is namely the fact that their Bulgarian nationalism was somehow harmonized with a Macedonian self-identification that was not only a political one but also demonstrated certain ‘cultural’ contents. "We, the People: Politics of National Peculiarity in Southeastern Europe", Diana Miškova, Central European University Press, 2009, {{ISBN|9639776289}}, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Bulgarian historians, such as Veselin Angelov, Nikola Achkov and Kosta Tzarnushanov continue to publish their research backed with many primary sources to prove that the term 'Macedonian' when applied to Slavs has always meant only a regional identity of the Bulgarians. "Contested Ethnic Identity: The Case of Macedonian Immigrants in Toronto, 1900-1996, Chris Kostov, Peter Lang, 2010, {{ISBN|3034301960}}, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

The society's founders included [[Kosta Shahov]], its chairman. In May 1894, after the fall of Stambolov, the '' Macedonian Youth Society'' in Sofia revived the Young Macedonian Literary Society. The new group had a newspaper called ''Glas Makedonski'', and opened a Reading Room Club. The group included a number of educators, revolutionaries, and public figures from Macedonia—[[Evtim Sprostranov]], [[Petar Pop Arsov]], [[Thoma Karayovov]], [[Hristo Popkotsev]], [[Dimitar Mirchev]], [[Andrey Lyapchev]], [[Naum Tyufekchiev]], [[Georgi Balaschev]], [[Georgi Belev (revolutionary)|Georgi Belev]], etc.—all known as the ''Lozars''.&lt;ref&gt;"100 years IMORO", prof. Dimitŭr Minchev, prof. Dimitŭr  Gotsev, Macedonian scientific institute, 1994, Sofia, p. 37; (Bg.)&lt;/ref&gt; Later, for a short time in the company were involved also [[Dame Gruev]], [[Gotse Delchev]], [[Luka Dzherov]], [[Ivan Hadzhinikolov]] and [[Hristo Matov]].&lt;ref&gt;History of the Sofia University "St. Kliment Okhridski", Georgi Naumov, Dimitŭr Tsanev, University publishing house "St. Kliment Okhridski", 1988, p. 164; (Bg.)&lt;/ref&gt; These activists went on to various careers. Some became leaders in the Macedonian revolutionary movement—both the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] in 1894, and the [[Supreme Macedonian Committee]] in 1895. Others became later prominent Bulgarian intellectuals, and  [[Andrey Lyapchev]] became prime minister of Bulgaria.
