'''"Alles heeft ritme"''' ("Everything has rhythm") was the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1986]], performed in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] by [[Frizzle Sizzle]].

The song is up-tempo with a tropical-tinged musical arrangement, in which the point is made that there is nothing to be gained by worrying about being late or having to make deadlines. The band explains that "everything has a rhythm", people included, and that to try to work against this rhythm would be foolish.

During the previews week before the Contest, the music video for the song was shown, in which the girls lounged about the beach with a large [[mascot]]; the girls sang the song while walking along the beach, watching [[windsurfing]] (and shaking hands with windsurfer [[Stephan van den Berg]]), and in the final part of the song, riding an [[all-terrain vehicle]] (which the mascot drove). In some countries, however, only the footage from the Nationaal Songfestival was shown.

The song was performed seventh on the night, following [[Iceland]]'s [[ICY]] with "[[Gleðibankinn]]" and preceding [[Turkey]]'s [[Klips ve Onlar]] with "[[Halley (song)|Halley]]". At the close of voting, it had received 40 points, placing 13th in a field of 20.

It was succeeded as [[Netherlands in the Eurovision Song Contest|Dutch representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1987|1987 Contest]] by [[Marcha]] with "[[Rechtop in de wind]]".

The border between '''Andorra''' and '''Spain''' is in the [[Pyrenees]] between northern [[Spain]] and southern [[Andorra]].

== Specifications ==
The Spanish-Andorran border runs 64&amp;nbsp;km between the south of Andorra and northern Spain (by the [[Autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community]] of [[Catalonia]]) in the Pyrenees Mountains. Because both Spain and Andorra are situated in the same watershed, travel is easier than travel between Andorra and France. The most used languages of Andorra are also [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

The border begins in the west at the Andorra-France-Spain [[tripoint]] (42 ° 36 '13 "N 1 ° 26' 30" W).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grpdesbf.nl/esfr-html-backgrounds-andorra-tripoints.html The tripoints of Andorra] grpdesbf.nl&lt;/ref&gt; It then follows a generally south-eastern direction, later turning northeast to the eastern Andorra-Spain-France tripoint (42 ° 30 '09 "N 1 ° 43' 34" W). The dividing line between the two countries goes through high mountain areas, often over 2000&amp;nbsp;m, and passes close to the highest point of Andorra, the peak of [[Coma Pedrosa]]. It also borders the [[Madriu-Perafita-Claror Valley]], the only [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in Andorra.

In May 2015 the European commission adopted a cooperation program to improve the protection of the environment at the Spain-Andorra and Andorra-France borders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/newsroom/news/2015/05/spain-france-and-andorra-eu-invests-almost-eur190-million-to-boost-cooperation-across-borders Spain, France and Andorra: EU invests almost €190 million to boost cooperation across borders] 20/05/2015&lt;/ref&gt;

== Border controls ==
The main channel of communication between the two countries is through the [[Valira Valley]] between [[La Seu d'Urgell]] and the [[Parishes of Andorra|parish]] of [[Sant Julia de Loria]]. The only border control at the Andorra–Spain border is located along this road. There is no rail crossing point.

In addition, helicopters are allowed to go to airports with border control in other countries, but not to anywhere else outside Andorra. Flights usually go to the airports of [[Barcelona–El Prat Airport|Barcelona]] or [[Toulouse–Blagnac Airport|Toulouse]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hola-andorra.com/arinsal/english/heligb.html Helicopter flights in Andorra] and [http://www.heliand.com/index.php/serveis Serveis]&lt;/ref&gt;

An agreement signed in 2003 between France, Spain and Andorra governs the movement and residence in Andorra of citizens of third states.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/eli/decret/2003/7/30/MAEJ0330055D/jo/texte Décret n° 2003-740 du 30 juillet 2003 portant publication de la convention entre la République française, le Royaume d'Espagne et la Principauté d'Andorre relative à la circulation et au séjour en Principauté d'Andorre des ressortissants des Etats tiers, signée à Bruxelles le 4 décembre 2000] (French)&lt;/ref&gt; It says that the three countries will coordinate their visa requirements, although in reality today Andorra follows the [[Schengen Agreement]] visa requirements, and that Andorra will only allow entry of those who have right of entry to Spain or France. Andorra is allowed to permit residency to any person and such persons will be treated as long-term residents of France or Spain are treated.

== Contraband ==
Due to the low tax on tobacco in Andorra there is significant [[cigarette smuggling]] between the two countries; it takes place through the border post of La Farga de Molas but also often through the mountains passes. The [[Civil Guard (Spain)|Guardia Civil]] is responsible for surveillance at the border and arrests smugglers on the Spanish side.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://www.elmundo.es/magazine/num140/textos/contra1.html La guardia civil acaba con el contrabando en la frontera con Andorra] http://elmundo.es&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Arredol''''' (English: "Around"; Spanish: "Alrededor") is an electronic newspaper written in the [[Aragonese language]]. The newspaper was founded on 19 September 2011 and at the time was the first digital news source written entirely in [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nace Arredol, un medio digital íntegramente en aragonés|url=http://www.gozazaragoza.com/contenido.php?id=9310|website=gozazaragoza.com|publisher=GozaZaragoza.com|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project is open to contributions from readers themselves who may provide news, articles, and images.

The language model used by Arredol is the standardized spelling of the [[Academia de l'Aragonés]], which is supported by most institutions and associations to be more in keeping with the etymology and medieval Aragonese.

Upon the launch of the newspaper, its editors were Chorche Burgos Romance, Lucía Marco López and Carlos García.

'''Associated Electrical Industries''' ('''AEI''') was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[holding company]] formed in 1928 through the merger of the [[British Thomson-Houston Company]] (BTH) and [[Metropolitan-Vickers]] electrical engineering companies. In 1967 AEI was acquired by [[General Electric Company plc|GEC]], to create the UK's largest electrical group.  A scandal that followed the acquisition is said to have been instrumental in reforming accounting practices in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The AEI-GEC gap revisited |journal=Accounting, Business &amp; Financial History |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=141–161 |date=2006-07-28|doi=10.1080/09585209600000036 |last1 = Rutherford|first1 = Brian A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main subsidiaries==
* [[Metropolitan-Vickers]] (Metrovick)
* [[British Thomson-Houston]] (BTH)
* [[Ferguson, Pailin &amp; Co]] (switchgear)
* [[Edison and Swan Electric Light Company|Edison Swan]] (lamps and radio valves) 
* AEI Lamp and Lighting
* [[Siemens Brothers|Siemens Brothers &amp; Co]] (cables, telephone equipment and railway signaling apparatus)       
* [[Hotpoint]] (domestic appliances)
* Premier Electric Heaters (incorporated into Hotpoint)
* [[W.T. Henley]] (cables, insulators and low voltage switchgear) 
* Newton Victor (X-ray machines)
* Sunvic Controls (heating controls)
* [[Birlec]] (industrial electric furnaces)
* International Refrigerator Company
* Coldrator

==Takeover and restructuring==
Rivalry existed between Metrovick and BTH brands in the Electrical Engineering field, resulting in internal competition and duplicated management. In 1959 AEI decided to remove those brands and consolidate both as AEI brands, resulting in internal problems and a fall in sales and market value.  The abandonment of two well known trademarks and the replacement with the unfamiliar AEI branding lost the company significant work to competitors and resulted in a market weakening of the company.

These problems paved the way for a takeover in 1967 with the recently restructured [[General Electric Company plc]] (GEC) under [[Arnold Weinstock]]. The following year GEC merged with [[English Electric]].

GEC later went through substantial restructuring, including in 1989 forming GEC ALSTHOM and Cegelec Projects. GEC ALSTHOM was created from the GEC's Power and Transport businesses (originally AEI (previously BTH and Metrovick) and English Electric) and the French Compagnie Générale d'Electricité (CGE). The merger was to enable both companies a gain a greater export potential into Europe.

The GEC facilities in [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]] were split into GEC [[Alstom]] and [[Cegelec]] Projects, but in 1998 the two companies were reunited under the Alstom banner.

'''Bermuda black hole''' is the term given to the final destination of corporate [[tax avoidance]] schemes which end up in an offshore [[tax haven]]/[[offshore financial centre]].

The term "black hole" is mostly used in relation to a corporation because once the money enters Bermuda, it does not emerge again (or it could be subject to corporation tax).  Instead, the money is "lent out" to the corporate parent (or its subsidiaries) to avoid repatriation (and taxing).  This has led to US corporations amassing over $1trn in locations like Bermuda by 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/the-real-story-behind-us-companies-off-shore-cash-reserves| title=The real story behind US companies' offshore cash reserves | publisher=McKinsey &amp; Company|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is less applicable to individuals as they can move residence more easily, and release the funds from the "black hole".

The Bermuda black hole is used by US corporations exploiting gaps in the US tax code to shield foreign income in perpetuity from US repatriation (and taxation).

It is the final step of the '''[[double Irish]]''' with a '''[[Dutch Sandwich|dutch sandwich]]''' tax strategy used by US technology firms in Ireland (incl. Google, Apple and Facebook)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/apple-s-cash-mountain-how-it-avoids-tax-and-the-irish-link-1.3281734|title=Apple's cash mountain, how it avoids tax, and the Irish link |publisher=Irish Times |date=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="apple"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/world/apple-taxes-jersey.html|title=After a Tax Crackdown, Apple Found a New Shelter for Its Profits|publisher=New York Times|date=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/double-irish-and-dutch-sandwich-saved-google-3-7bn-in-tax-in-2016-1.3343205 | title=‘Double Irish’ and ‘Dutch Sandwich’ saved Google $3.7bn in tax in 2016| publisher=Irish Times| date=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-02/google-s-dutch-sandwich-shielded-16-billion-euros-from-tax | title=Google's 'Dutch Sandwich' Shielded 16 Billion Euros From Tax| publisher=Bloomberg| date=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="face1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/ca64f938-5dc0-11e3-95bd-00144feabdc0|title='Double Irish' limits Facebook's tax bill to €1.9m in Ireland|publisher=Financial Times|date=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="face2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/technology/facebook-paid-just-30m-tax-in-ireland-despite-earning-12bn-36362527.html|title=Facebook paid just €30m tax in Ireland despite earning €12bn|publisher=Irish Indepdenent|date=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="businessweek.com"&gt;Drucker J.

The change in the US tax code from the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]] ("TCJA") should diminish the ability of US corporations to use a Bermuda black hole as all worldwide income for US corporations is now deemed automatically repatriated under the TCJA.

Note, the term is not unique to Bermuda, and can be used to describe any type of offshore tax haven (i.e. Cayman black hole).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.krys-global.com/2016/07/5614/| title=RECOVERING ILLICIT ASSETS OFFSHORE: DEMYSTIFYING THE BLACK HOLE | publisher=KRyS Global|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openaccess.city.ac.uk/2113/| title=The Governance of the Black Holes of the World Economy: Shadow Banking and Offshore Finance | publisher=City University (London)|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bermuda black hole was classified as the 5th largest of 24 [[Conduit and Sink OFCs|sink ofc]] in the 2017 analysis of [[offshore financial centres]] ''"Uncovering Offshore Financial Centers: Conduits and Sinks in the Global Corporate Ownership Network"'' published in [[Nature (journal)|Nature Magazine]].&lt;ref name="xx"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-06322-9| title=Uncovering Offshore Financial Centers: Conduits and Sinks in the Global Corporate Ownership Network| publisher=Nature Magazine|date=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 5 global [[conduit and Sink OFCs|conduit ofcs]] (Netherlands, United Kingdom, Ireland, Singapore and Switzerland) are countries not formally labelled [[tax havens]] by the EU/OECD, but who have "advanced" legal and tax structuring vehicles that can route funds to the 24 sink ofcs (block hole tax havens), without incurring tax in the conduit ofc.

It is possible the term "sink ofc" will come to replace the term "black hole", in describing corporate tax strategies that use [[tax havens]]/[[offshore financial centres]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2897">'''''Bevilo tutto''''' ("Drink it all", "Drink it up") is an [[Italy|Italian]] [[drinking song]]. A version is documented in ''I Nuovi Goliardi - Periodico mensuale di storia'' [[Trieste]], in the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;S Morpurgo, Albino Zenatti Archivio storico per Trieste, l'Istria e il Trentino - Volumes 1 à 2 1881 -- Page 216 "dei due versi conservati dal Redi ; verso che nella strofa, come la leggiamo nel ms. riccardiano, manca con molto danno della chiarezza e della connessione dell'insieme: E l'ha beuto tutto e non gì' ha fatto male chi lo beve allo boccale bevilo tutto, bevilo tutto che buon prò ti possa fare. ... Sarebbe del resto una ingiustificata pretesa quella di volere ritrovare nella sua originaria integrità una canzona che e per ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Versions==
Apart from the line "Se l'è bevuto tutto, E non gli ha fatto male" (with variant spellings in dialect) the rest of the text has various versions. The version as written in I Nuovi Goliardi&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/ilnuovigoliardi00unkngoog/ilnuovigoliardi00unkngoog_djvu.txt Full text archive.org "Il Nuovi goliardi" sic] text begins at "Io faccio osserrare che nel riccardiano 2849 (Sec. XVII) si legge: "&lt;/ref&gt; Trieste 1881:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Con questo calcione 
si carica la balestra 
e chi ha un bicchier in mano 
al suo compagno il presta 
e mentre che ei berà

noi farem bom, ba, ba, ba 
bom ba ba ba bom ba ba ba ba.

E l'ha beuto tutto 
e non gì' ha fatto male 
chi lo beve allo boccale 
bevilo tutto, bevilo tutto 
che buon prò ti possa fare.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Different versions of the song and different associated drinking games exist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://turistipercaso.it/alicante/59034/matrimonio-in-grande-stile-nella-costa-blanca.html?page=3 Matrimonio in grande stile nella Costa Blanca]  In cucina giocavamo spesso al Duro, un gioco che aveva inventato lei, a base di bicchieri di vino, monete con cui centrare i bicchieri, e una canzoncina, quando facevi centro: “Bevilo tutto bevilo tutto bevilo tutto tutto tutto. E l’ha bevuto tutto, e non gli ha fatto male. L’acqua fa male, il vino fa cantare!”&lt;/ref&gt; In some versions when the song is sung the drink must be drunk during the first 3 lines since the fourth line is 'he has drunk it!'.&lt;ref&gt;Francesca Di Meglio "[http://www.italiansrus.com/articles/ourpaesani/wineinitaly.htm How Italians Love Their Wine]", www.italiansrus.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Bevilo tutto,
Bevilo tutto,
Bevilo tutto!
Se l'e' bevuto tutto,
E non gli ha fatto male,
L'acqua gli fa male,
Il vino lo fa cantare!
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Recordings==
A version of Bevilo tutto was recorded by the [[organetto]] players Andrea and Riccardo, I Ragazzi della Quadriglia on the Album of [[Teramo]] region folk songs Il giro del mondo.

'''CKFM-FM''', branded as ''99.9 Virgin Radio'', is a Canadian radio station, broadcasting at 99.9 [[FM radio|FM]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]. The station is owned by [[Bell Media]]. The station airs a [[Contemporary Hit Radio|Top 40/CHR]] format (as it reports to [[Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems|BDS]] and [[Mediabase]] as a Canadian Top 40 Airplay panel Canadian CHR reporter), and is the flagship of Canada's [[Virgin Radio]] stations. CKFM's studios are located at [[250 Richmond Street West]] in the [[Toronto Entertainment District|Entertainment District]], while its transmitter is located at the top of the [[CN Tower]].

==History==
===Early years===
[[File:Building Of Newstalk 1010 CFRB, CHBM-FM (Boom 97-3) &amp; CKFM-FM (99-9 Virgin Radio).jpg|thumb|right|CKFM's former studios at 2 St. Clair West located Yonge and St. Clair until May 2014, when CKFM moved to Bell Media's [[250 Richmond Street West]] located at Richmond and Duncan streets, adjacent to [[299 Queen Street West]]]]
The station was launched in 1938 by the [[Rogers Vacuum Tube Company|Rogers Radio Broadcasting Co. Ltd.]] (operated by the father of the founder of Rogers Communications, [[Ted Rogers Sr.]]) as experimental FM station '''VE9AK'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CKFM-FM |url=http://www.broadcasting-history.ca/listing_and_histories/radio/ckfm-fm |website=Canadian Communications Foundation |accessdate=28 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The station went off the air between 1942 and 1945 due to the war. It began broadcasting at 99.9 FM in 1947 as '''CFRB-FM''', a simulcast of [[CFRB]]. Rogers Radio Broadcasting eventually became known as [[Standard Broadcasting]] which was acquired by [[Argus Corporation]] in 1948.

In April 1961, the complete simulcast was dropped, in favour of some unique programming.

In April 1963, the station changed its call letters to '''CKFM-FM'''. All CFRB programming was discontinued. The station adopted an [[easy listening]] and [[middle of the road (music)|MOR]] format, which lasted for many years and was very successful in ratings (a 1974 ''[[Billboard magazine]]'' article claimed the station had the most listeners in the 25-to-34-year-old age group of any Canadian radio station, AM or FM). During this time period, CKFM carried a few specialty shows, such as a Sunday evening [[reggae music]] program. Towards the latter part of the 1980s, CKFM transitioned towards a more younger-targeting [[adult contemporary]] format.

===Mix 99.9/99.9 Mix FM===
The station adopted the brand name ''Mix 99.9'', on September 2, 1991, and adopted a [[hot adult contemporary]] format to compete with [[CHUM-FM]]. The first song on "Mix" was "[[Changes (David Bowie song)|Changes]]" by [[David Bowie]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/doc/436481435.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=&amp;author=&amp;pub=&amp;desc=The+ultimate+FM+turn-on The ultimate FM turn-on] Greg Quill, ''Toronto Star'', September 3, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; The brand name was changed slightly to ''99.9 Mix FM'' on August 8, 2006, and the branding was phased in throughout the day. This coincided with the return of former [[CJAQ-FM|Kiss 92]] and [[CHFI-FM]] morning show hosts Mad Dog and Billie to Toronto radio.

A [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) decision from May 31, 2007, stated that the station's call sign was changed to '''CFMX-FM'''.&lt;ref name="astral"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2007/db2007-359.htm|title=ARCHIVED - Acquisition of assets|first=Government of Canada, Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|last=(CRTC)|date=28 September 2007|website=www.crtc.gc.ca|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within weeks, the station reverted to CKFM-FM, due to both potential confusion with [[CFMZ-FM]] as that station, licensed to [[Cobourg, Ontario|Cobourg]] but also heard in Toronto because of a [[rebroadcaster]], was previously known as CFMX-FM; and because&lt;ref name="fybush"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fybush.com/NERW/2007/071022/nerw.html#can |title=NorthEast Radio Watch|accessdate=2007-11-14 |last=Fybush |first=Scott |date=2007-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; as of November 14, 2007, according to [[Industry Canada]] databases, the Toronto rebroadcaster of CFMZ-FM was actually still known as CFMX-FM-1 (not CFMZ-FM-1).&lt;ref name="IC"&gt;[http://sd.ic.gc.ca/pls/eng_alpha/web_search.call_sign_input Call sign search] and [http://spectrum.ic.gc.ca/engineering/engdoc/baserad.zip Broadcasting database (ZIP file)] (using the file ''fmstatio.dbf'') from Industry Canada.  Retrieved on November 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 28, 2007, CKFM was purchased by [[Astral Media]] as part of its purchase of Standard Broadcasting. Since its purchase by Astral, the hot AC format has gone more in a [[rhythmic adult contemporary|rhythmic-leaning]] direction, patterned after sister stations [[CJFM-FM|Mix 96]] in [[Montreal]] and [[CKZZ-FM|Crave 95]] in [[Vancouver]], which both carry rhythmic-leaning hot AC formats. It also began airing the ''[[AT40|American Top 40]]'', which usually airs on [[contemporary hit radio|CHR]] stations across the [[United States]] and Canada.

===Virgin Radio===

[[Image:Mix99.9 FM logo.PNG|thumb|left|Mix 99.9 logo, used from 1992-2006.]]
Astral announced a partnership with the Virgin Group to rebrand the station ''999 Virgin Radio'' on August 25, 2008, taking effect at 4 p.m. that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/August2008/25/c6563.html|title=Astral Media and Virgin launch North America's first Virgin radio station in Toronto|author=|date=|website=www.newswire.ca|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final song on "Mix" was [[Green Day]]'s ''[[Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)]]'', while the first song on "Virgin" was [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s "[[Like a Virgin (song)|Like a Virgin]]". The change came just before the original [[United Kingdom|UK]] Virgin Radio station was slated to lose its licence to the Virgin name and rebrand as [[Absolute Radio]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/may/31/smg.virginrichardbranson SMG sells Virgin Radio for £53m], Kate Allen, ''[[The Guardian]]'', May 31, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Astral officials indicated at the time that, if the rebranding was successful, the Virgin Radio brand would eventually be rolled out to other markets nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20080826.RVIRGIN26/TPStory/Business Astral tests Virgin branding], Grant Robertson, ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', August 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Barely three months later, on December 4, Astral deemed the new brand a success, and announced that stations in [[CJFM-FM|Montreal]], [[CKQB-FM|Ottawa]], and [[CKZZ-FM|Vancouver]] will be rebranded as Virgin Radio stations effective early January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/December2008/04/c7123.html Astral press release], December 4, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; All three stations will retain essentially the same formats (rock at the Ottawa station, hot AC in Montreal and Vancouver). In addition to the aforementioned three stations, the "Virgin" branding has since been expanded to [[CIBK-FM|Calgary]], [[CFMG-FM|Edmonton]], [[CIQM-FM|London]], [[CKMM-FM|Winnipeg]], [[CFCA-FM|Kitchener]] and [[CJCH-FM|Halifax]].

As of September [[2009 in radio|2009]], the station was moved to the Canadian [[contemporary hit radio|CHR]] panel on [[Mediabase]] and [[Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems|BDS]], making the station the first in the [[contemporary hit radio|CHR]] format with a transmitter atop the [[CN Tower]] and the second Top 40 station licensed to the City of Toronto, the other being [[CKIS-FM]]. At the time of the format altering, CKFM adopted the slogan "Toronto's New #1 Hit Music Station". Currently, CKFM competes with CKIS-FM, [[CIDC-FM]], [[CFXJ-FM]], [[CJED-FM]] in [[Regional Municipality of Niagara|Niagara Region]], [[CKBT-FM]] in [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]], and, to a lesser extent, [[WKSE]] in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]].

In June 2010, CKFM slightly changed its branding from ''9-9-9 Virgin Radio'' (pronounced, "nine-nine-nine Virgin Radio"), to ''99-9 Virgin Radio'' (pronounced, "ninety-nine-nine Virgin Radio"). A week after the change, the station held a contest called "Say it &amp; Win!", where the 99th caller gets 10 seconds to say their new branding, "ninety-nine-nine Virgin Radio" for as many times as they can. For each time the contestant read out their new logo, $100 would be given to him/her.&lt;ref&gt;[http://toronto.virginradio.ca/contest/124115 Say it &amp; Win Contest], June 21, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 27, 2013, [[Bell Media]] completed its acquisition of Astral Media, making CKFM a sister station to [[Hot AC]]-formatted [[CHUM-FM]] and [[sports talk]]-formatted [[CHUM (AM)]]. Due to CRTC ownership limits, Bell and Astral's fellow FM stations [[CFXJ-FM]] and [[CHBM-FM]] were sold to [[Newcap Radio]].

On November 20, 2018, veteran DJs were fired for no apparent reason. Those who were fired include the crew of Tucker in the Morning (Tucker, Maura, Robyn, and Wilson), Tessa, Kella, and Will Nash. &lt;ref&gt; http://broadcastdialogue.com/virgin-radio-toronto-lays-off-on-air-staff-amidst-speculation-of-brand-flip/. Retrieved on November 22, 2018 &lt;/ref&gt;

==HD Radio==
On July 4, 2017, CKFM-FM launched [[HD Radio]] multi-casting services. The HD1 sub-channel carries the same programming as the standard analog frequency. As of mid-2018, the HD2 sub-channel carries a simulcast of sister station [[CFRB|NewsTalk 1010]], and the HD3 sub-channel carries a simulcast of [[CHUM (AM)|TSN Radio 1050]].

==Controversies==
After Virgin Radio 999 posters featuring a kitchen radio poised at the edge of a TTC subway platform with the caption "give your radio a reason to live,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adsoftheworld.com/media/print/virgin_radio_subway|title=Ads of the World™|author=|date=|website=adsoftheworld.com|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; had appeared in Toronto,&lt;ref&gt;[http://torontoist.com/2009/04/ttc_kills_the_radio_star.php TTC Kills the Radio Star]. ''[[Torontoist]]'', April 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Toronto Public Space Committee criticized poster ad was "in poor taste". The city's transportation department later ordered the removal of the posters. According to TTC chair [[Adam Giambrone]], the TTC had allowed the photo for the poster to be taken at a subway station based on a request to photograph various radios on TTC platforms. Although a supervisor was on site, there was no indication on how the photos would be used in the ad.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/News/GTA/article/619910 City pulls ad posters with suicide theme].

The '''Cinema of Belarus''' began on 17 December 1924 with the creation by decree of what later became [[Belarusfilm]] studio. The studio was moved to [[Minsk]] in 1939. Film production was interrupted by [[World War II]], and restarted in 1946, when the studio assumed its current name.

Most of the output has been in [[Russian language|Russian]] rather than [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]].

Belarusfilm is also a co-organizer of the [[Listapad]] film festival held in [[Minsk]], [[Belarus]] in November.

'''Cognac Skënderbeu''' is an Albanian [[cognac]] produced and degusted for the first time on September 1, 1967 by then government-owned Kantina Skënderbeu.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.koha.net/?id=8&amp;arkiva=1&amp;l=147025 Ringjallen prodhimet tradicionale shqiptare]&lt;/ref&gt;

The alcohol is prepared and aged only in vats, tuns and barrels made by oak wood, which gives it its unique aroma, bouquet and special colour. Its main ingredients are: aged raki, mountain plants extract, processed fruit (grapes, lemon, black plum), ethyl alcohol, sugar syrup, flower honey, distilled water, caramel, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://konjakskenderbeu.al/?fq=shqip&amp;art=historiku&amp;k=kemba&amp;gj=en|title=Konjak Skenderbeu|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monitor.al/dehje-shqiptare-3 "Dehje" shqiptare]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Draw soup''' is a term given to certain soups originating from the southeastern and southwestern parts of [[Nigeria]]. They are made from [[okra]], [[ogbono]] or [[Corchorus|ewedu]] leaves (jute). The term derives from the thick viscosity characteristic of the broth as it draws out of the bowl when eaten either with a spoon or, more characteristically, by dipping a small piece of solid ([[fufu]]) into it. Ogbono and okra soups are of [[Edo state]] origin and can be served with numerous Nigerian fufu meals, including [[eba]] (garri). Ewedu can be used to make a [[Yorubaland|Yoruba]] soup that is traditionally served with [[amala (food)|amala]].

The '''European Globalisation Adjustment Fund''' ('''EGF''') was set up by the [[European Union]] in late 2006 to support to workers (not companies or institutions) who have been made redundant as a result of [[trade liberalisation]], so that they can either remain in employment or find a new job quickly. It provides counselling; job search and mobility allowances; new [[Information and communication technologies|ICT]] skills and other forms of training; entrepreneurial support, including micro-credits.

Since 2007 EGF has received more than 100 applications from 20 EU member states for programs that would support more than 100,000 workers who either lost their jobs due to [[globalization]] (56%) or as a result of the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|global economic and financial crisis]] (44%). The hardest-hit industries were in automobile manufacturing (22.5%), machinery and equipment (13.5%), textile and apparel (12%), computers, mobile phones and ICT (11.6%) and construction (9.6%).&lt;ref name=reporter&gt;{{cite news|title=Globalization Adjustment Fund: Helping redundant workers find work again|url=http://www.eureporter.co/magazine/2014/09/15/globalisation-adjustment-fund-helping-redundant-workers-find-work-again/|work=EU Reporter|date=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conditions for assistance==
The Fund is activated upon request of a member state when a company (whether national, multinational or SMEs) lays off more than 1,000 people either in an enterprise, or in a sector within a region, due to structural changes in world trade. The Fund seeks to intervene when redundancies have a significant impact on a region or a sector and therefore there is an EU dimension in terms of scale and impact.

The EGF is open to all persons who work legally in the EU. It operates under the principle of [[subsidiarity]], and in a system of shared management between the [[European Commission]] and the member state. Responsibility for implementing the EGF lies with the authorities of the member states. The maximum amount available through the EGF is €500 million per year for the period of 2007 to 2013.

==Activities==
Since 1 January 2007, the EGF has been funding [[active labour market policies]] helping workers made redundant as a result of globalisation, for example through:

*Job-search assistance, occupational guidance, tailor-made training and [[retraining]] including IT skills and certification of acquired experience, [[outplacement]] assistance and entrepreneurship promotion or aid for self-employment,
*Special time-limited measures, such as job-search allowances, allowances to individuals participating in lifelong learning and training activities,
*Measures to stimulate in particular disadvantaged or older workers, to remain in or return to employment.

It complements support provided by the employers and national authorities concerned in terms of active labour market policy measures; it does not fund passive [[social protection]] measures such as retirement pensions or [[unemployment benefits]]. Member states can also use EGF money to publicize activities highlighting the EGF's role in their support for workers.

==Relationship to other funds==
The [[Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds|EU Structural Funds]], in particular the [[Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds#The European Social Fund|European Social Fund (ESF)]], consist of multi-annual programmes&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/budget/biblio/documents/fin_fwk0713/fin_fwk0713_en.cfm "Multiannual financial framework"], European Commission Financial Programming and Budget&lt;/ref&gt; in support of strategic, long-term goals, and management of change and restructuring in the 2007–2013 period, with activities such as lifelong learning. The EGF is a response to a specific, European-scale crisis; it provides one-off, time-limited individual support geared directly to helping workers who have become redundant for reasons related to international trade.

==Global economic crisis==
The [[European Commission]] proposed that, in addition to its current scope, the Fund should be able to support workers made redundant as a result of the global financial and economic crisis on 16 December 2008. In addition, it proposes to reduce the threshold of redundancies from the current 1,000 to 500, to extend the period of each case from 12 months to 24 months, and to increase its contribution from 50% of total cost to 75% (the rest being contributed by the member state). This proposal was submitted to the Council and the [[European Parliament]] in December 2008. It is expected that the amendment will be adopted in mid-2009. There is a need of this fund because the difference in labour costs at the international level remains an important determinant of the geographical distribution of production, because the large apparel companies are constantly seeking production bases lower labour costs. Additionally, the ongoing globalisation of trade has intensified this situation. The search for lower labour costs have led to significant changes in the image of global apparel industry. The production of clothing gradually moved from Europe to Asia, which now accounts for nearly 45% of global garment production.&lt;ref name=early&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.ilera-directory.org/15thworldcongress/files/papers/Track_4/Poster/CS2T_3_MACKENZIE.pdf |title=An early analysis of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund | author1=Chris Forde|author2=Mark Stuart|author3=Robert MacKenzie|author4=Antonios Panagiotakopoulos|authorlink= |date=27 August 2009 |conference= International Industrial Relations Association World Congress |conferenceurl= |editor= |others= |volume= |edition= |booktitle= |publisher= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |location=Sydney, Australia |pages= |format= |id= |isbn= |bibcode= |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Feminism sidebar}}
'''[[Feminism]]''' is a broad term given to works of those scholars who have sought to bring [[gender]] concerns into the academic study of [[international politics]].

In terms of [[international relations]] (IR) theory, a feminist approach is grouped in the broad category of theoretical approaches known as [[reflectivism]], representing a divergence from approaches adhering to a rationalist outlook based on the premises of [[rational choice theory]]; reflectivist approaches, which also include [[Constructivism (international relations)|constructivism]], [[post-structuralism]], and [[Postcolonialism (international relations)|postcolonialism]], regard state identities and interests as continuously in flux, so that norms and identity play as much a role in shaping policy as material interests.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Adam (2016). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=_-n7CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA449 Contemporary Security Studies]''. 4th ed. Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|9780198708315}}. pp.&amp;nbsp;448-449. "Glossary", entries for "rationalism" and "reflectivism".&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most influential works in feminist IR is [[Cynthia Enloe]]'s ''[[Bananas, Beaches and Bases]]'' (Pandora Press 1990). This text sought to chart the many different roles that women play in international politics&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; as plantation sector workers, diplomatic wives, sex workers on military bases etc. The important point of this work was to emphasize how, when looking at international politics from the perspective of women, one is forced to reconsider his or her personal assumptions regarding what international politics is 'all about'.

However, it would be a mistake to think that feminist IR was solely a matter of identifying how many groups of women are positioned in the international political system. From its inception, feminist IR has always shown a strong concern with thinking about men and, in particular, masculinities. Indeed, many IR feminists argue that the discipline is inherently masculine in nature. For example, in her article "Sex and Death in the Rational World of Defense Intellectuals" ''Signs'' (1988), [[Carol Cohn]] claimed that a highly masculinised culture within the defense establishment contributed to the divorcing of war from human emotion.

Feminist IR theory involves looking at how international politics affects and is affected by both men and women and also at how the core concepts that are employed within the discipline of IR (e.g. [[war]], [[security]], etc.) are themselves gendered. Feminist IR has not only concerned itself with the traditional focus of IR on [[Sovereign state|states]], wars, [[diplomacy]] and security, but feminist IR scholars have also emphasized the importance of looking at how gender shapes the current global political [[economy]]. In this sense, there is no clear cut division between feminists working in IR and those working in the area of [[International Political Economy]] (IPE).

Feminist IR emerged largely from the late 1980s onwards. The end of the [[Cold War]] and the re-evaluation of traditional IR theory during the 1990s opened up a space for gendering International Relations. Because feminist IR is linked broadly to the critical project in IR, by and large most feminist scholarship has sought to problematise the politics of knowledge construction within the discipline - often by adopting methodologies of [[deconstructivism]] associated with [[postmodernism]]/[[poststructuralism]]. However, the growing influence of feminist and women-centric approaches within the international policy communities (for example at the [[World Bank]] and the [[United Nations]]) is more reflective of the liberal feminist emphasis on equality of opportunity for women.

In regards to feminism in International Relations, some of the founding feminist IR scholars refer to using a "feminist consciousness" when looking at gender issues in politics. In Cynthia Enloe's article “Gender is not enough: the need for a feminist consciousness”, Enloe explains how International Relations needs to include masculinity in the discussion on war, while also giving attention to the issues surrounding women and girls.&lt;ref name=enloe2004&gt;Enloe, C. (2004), III "‘Gender’ is not enough: the need for a feminist consciousness". ''International Affairs'', 80: 95–97. doi: 10.1111/j.1468-2346.2004.00370.x.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to do so, Enloe urges International Relations scholars to look at issues with a ‘feminist consciousness’, which will ultimately include a perspective sensitive to masculinities and femininities.&lt;ref name=enloe2004 /&gt; In this way, the feminist consciousness, together with a gendered lens, allows for IR academics to discuss International Politics with a deeper appreciation and understanding of issues pertaining to gender around the world.

Enloe argues how the IR discipline continues to lack serious analysis of the experiences, actions and ideas of girls and women in the international arena, and how this ultimately excludes them from the discussion in IR.&lt;ref name=enloe2004 /&gt; For instance, Enloe explains Carol Cohn's experience using a feminist consciousness while participating in the drafting of a document that outlines the actions taken in negotiating ceasefires, peace agreements and new constitutions.&lt;ref name=enloe2004 /&gt; During this event, those involved came up with the word “combatant” to describe those in need during these usually high-strung negotiations.&lt;ref name=enloe2004 /&gt; The use of ‘combatant’ in this context is particularly problematic as Carol points out, because it implies one type of militarized people, generally men carrying guns, and excludes the women and girls deployed as porters, cooks and forced ‘wives’ of male combatants.&lt;ref name=enloe2004 /&gt; This term effectively renders the needs of these women invisible, and excludes them from the particularly critical IR conversation regarding who needs what in war and peace.&lt;ref name=enloe2004 /&gt; This discussion is crucial for the analysis of how various masculinities are at play in International Politics, and how those masculinities affect women and girls during wartime and peace and initially eliminates them from the discussion.

Conversely, feminist IR scholar Charlotte Hooper effectively applies a feminist consciousness when considering how “IR disciplines men as much as men shape IR”.&lt;ref name=hooper1999&gt;Hooper, C. (1999), "Masculinities, IR and the 'Gender Variable': A Cost-Benefit Analysis for (Sympathetic) Gender Skeptics". ''International Studies'', 25: 475-491.&lt;/ref&gt; So, instead of focusing on what and whom IR excludes from the conversation, Hooper focuses on how masculine identities are perpetuated and ultimately are the products of the practice of IR.&lt;ref name=hooper1999 /&gt; In this way, it is ineffective to use a gendered lens and feminist consciousness to analyze the exclusion of a discussion in gender in IR. Hooper suggests that a deeper examination of the ontological and epistemological ways in which IR has been inherently a masculine discipline is needed.&lt;ref name=hooper1999 /&gt;  The innate masculinity of IR is because men compose the vast majority of modern IR scholars, and their masculine identities have been socially constructed over time through various political progressions.&lt;ref name=hooper1999 /&gt; For instance, Hooper gives examples of the historical and political developments of masculinities that are still prevalent in IR and society at large; the Greek citizen/warrior model, the Judeo Christian model and the Protestant bourgeois rationalist model.&lt;ref name=hooper1999 /&gt; These track the masculine identities throughout history, where manliness is measured in militarism and citizenship, ownership and authority of the fathers, and finally, competitive individualism and reason.&lt;ref name=hooper1999 /&gt; These masculinities in turn asks one to not only use the feminist consciousness to analyze the exclusions of femininities from IR, but additionally, Hooper illuminates how one can locate the inherent inclusions of masculinities in the field of IR with a feminist consciousness.

== Gender &amp; War ==
A prominent basis for much of feminist scholarship on war is to emphasize the ways in which men are seen as the sole actors in war. Women, on the other hand, are commonly conceived of as acted upon throughout conflict and conflict resolutions. As asserted by Swati Parashar, they are documented as “grieving widows and mothers, selfless nurses and anti-war activists”. The reality is that women play various roles in war and for different reasons, depending on the conflict. It is noted that women have actively participated in war since the mid-nineteenth century. This process of eliminating women from war is a tool used to discredit women as agents in the international arena. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender Matters in Global Politics: A Feminist Introduction to International Relations|last=Parashar|first=Swati|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=978-0-415-71521-8|location=New York|pages=99-109}}&lt;/ref&gt;A focal point for many feminist scholars is mass rape during wartime. These scholars will seek to explain why wartime sexual violence is so prevalent through history and today. Some scholars turn to explanations such as rape as a weapon or as a reward for soldiers during the war. Others see sexual violence as an inevitable consequence when social restraints are removed. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender Matters in Global Politics: A Feminist Introduction to International Relations|last=Pankhurst|first=Donna|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=978-0-415-71521-8|location=New York|pages=159-169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Feminist Anti-Militarism ===
Feminists within IR often look to how conceptions of masculinity have shaped foreign policy, state identity, and security and armament during and outside of warfare. One tradition that exists within the field for this purpose is that of feminist anti-militarism. This is a stance within Feminist International Relations that opposes weapons of mass destruction, such as nuclear weaponry, and holds gender accountable in part for the propagation of militarism.&lt;ref name=Cohn&amp;Ruddick&gt;Cohn, C., &amp; Ruddick, S. (2003). A Feminist Ethical Perspective on Weapons of Mass Destruction. Boston Consortium on Gender, Security and Human Rights, Working Paper 104, 3-33. Retrieved from http://www.genderandsecurity.umb.edu/cohnruddick.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Gender becomes embedded in relations of power as that which is seen to be stronger is assigned a masculinized identity, while concepts such as emotion are seen as indicators of weakness and become associated with femininity.&lt;ref name=Duncanson&amp;Eschle&gt;Duncanson, C., &amp; Eschle, C. (2008). Gender and the Nuclear Weapons State: A Feminist Critique of the UK Government’s White Paper on Trident. New Political Science, 30(4), 545-563. Retrieved from use: http://www.informaworld.com/terms-and-conditions-of-access.p&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, the military strength and capability of a state becomes associated with its degree of masculinity, which feminist anti-militarists see as problematic. As disarmament could be perceived as emasculatory, states are less likely to disarm; consequently, militarism becomes normalized, downplayed, and more likely to incite warfare.&lt;ref name=Cohn1987&gt;Cohn, C. (1987). Sex and Death in the Rational World of Defense Intellectuals. Signs, 12(4), 687-178. Retrieved from http://genderandsecurity.umb.edu/Carol%20Cohn%20Sex%20and%20Death%&lt;/ref&gt; These are some of the concepts that [[Carol Cohn]] and [[Sara Ruddick]] explored in their article “Feminist Ethical Perspective on Weapons of Mass Destruction,” (2003) which laid out the meaning behind what they referred to as “anti-war feminism”.&lt;ref name=Cohn&amp;Ruddick /&gt; They explain that it opposes the use of weapons of mass destruction whether for military, political, or deterring purposes, yet that it differs from pacifism in that it does not outright reject all forms of warfare.&lt;ref name=Cohn&amp;Ruddick /&gt; Such opposition stems partly from the questionability of how effective warfare/militarism is, and whether the costs, (albeit monetary, environmental, and especially human) that are inevitably incurred yet not always accounted, for are worth it.&lt;ref name=Cohn&amp;Ruddick /&gt;

Manifestations of feminist anti-militarism can be identified in various contexts and methods. In line with Cohn and Ruddick's (2003) aforementioned article, part of what feminist anti-militarism critiques is the framework in which weapons of mass destruction are “discussed”.&lt;ref name=Cohn&amp;Ruddick /&gt; Such discourse assumedly would have large influence in the outcome, as investigated by Cohn in one of her earlier articles, “Sex and Death in the Rational World of Defense Intellectuals." &lt;ref name=Cohn1987 /&gt; Her participation in security discussions allowed her to observe the way in which the “technostrategic” language used by American defense intellectuals was highly gendered, and assigned greater value and strength to that which was assigned masculine or highly sexualized terminology.&lt;ref name=Cohn1987 /&gt; While Cohn does not explicitly identify the use of a feminist anti-militarist view in this article, the ideas and subjects at hand run parallel. Relatedly, [[Claire Duncanson]] and Catherine Eschle do state their use of a feminist anti-militarist perspective in their article “Gender and the Nuclear Weapons State: A Feminist Critique of the UK Government’s White Paper on Trident”.&lt;ref name=Duncanson&amp;Eschle /&gt; The authors borrow Cohn's rendition of the relationship between gender and nuclear weapons to examine the way in which discourses are shaped by underlying dichotomous views of masculinity and femininity.&lt;ref name=Duncanson&amp;Eschle /&gt; This perspective is then applied to the renewal of Trident nuclear weapons, a plan which Duncanson and Eschl argue is enabled by the UK government's use of masculinized language that seems to be constructed into the state's identity.&lt;ref name=Duncanson&amp;Eschle /&gt; The UK Trident Program was the cause of another expression of feminist anti-militarism, beginning a few decades earlier in the form of the Greenham Common Women's Peace Camp. The 1979 decision by NATO to base ground cruise missiles at Greenham Common initiated a response from women largely associated with various feminist and anti-nuclear groups. Their opposition to such militarism was demonstrated in the persistence of peace camps, demonstrations and other forms of resistance for the following two decades (nat. archive website).&lt;ref&gt;The National Archives | Access to Archives. The National Archives. Retrieved September 26, 2013, from http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/a2a/records.aspx?cat=106-5gcw&amp;cid=-1#-1&lt;/ref&gt; Such efforts brought to life the feminist anti-militarist perception of the relationship between gender and militarism as exhibited through nuclear weaponry.

==Gender Theory and Feminisms==

Gender theory highlights the limitations of linguistic categories,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Butler|first=Judith|title=Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity|year=1990|publisher=Routledge|location=New York and London|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; asserts the significance of intersectionality,&lt;ref name="Butler 1990 6"&gt;{{cite book|last=Butler|first=Judith|title=Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity|year=1990|publisher=Routledge|location=New York and London|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; values concrete cultural context over universalisms and essentialisms (for example, the notion of universal patriarchy),&lt;ref name="Butler 1990 6"/&gt; rigorously problematizes sex and gender binaries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Butler|first=Judith|title=Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity|year=1990|publisher=Routledge|location=New York and London|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; recounts and accounts for the history of sex and gender relations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Butler|first=Judith|title=Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity|year=1990|publisher=Routledge|location=New York and London|pages=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; and deals directly with other theoretical strains such as structuralism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Butler|first=Judith|title=Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity|year=1990|publisher=Routledge|location=New York and London|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; post-structuralism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Butler|first=Judith|title=Preface, Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|location=New York and London|pages=viii-ix}}&lt;/ref&gt; socialism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Butler|first=Judith|title=Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity|year=1990|publisher=Routledge|location=New York and London|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; and psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Butler|first=Judith|title=Preface, Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|location=New York and London|page=xviii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Butler|first=Judith|title=Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity|year=1990|publisher=Routledge|location=New York and London|pages=53–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in her book ''Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity'', [[Judith Butler]] explores the possibility of ''troubling gender'' first by examining conventional understandings of gender that support masculine hegemony and heterosexist power, and subsequently wondering about the extent to which one can undermine such constitutive categories (that is, male/female, man/woman) through continually mobilizing, subverting, and proliferating the very foundational illusions of identity which seek to keep gender in its place.&lt;ref name="Butler 1990 44"&gt;{{cite book|last=Butler|first=Judith|title=Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity|year=1990|publisher=Routledge|location=New York and London|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gender theory can inform critical lenses and perspectives such as Cynthia Enloe's “feminist consciousness,”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Enloe|first=Cynthia|title=Gender is not enough: the need for a feminist consciousness|journal=International Affairs|date=January 2004|volume=80|issue=1|pages=95–97|doi=10.1111/j..2004.00370.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as other feminist perspectives such as ''liberal feminism'',&lt;ref name="Jacqui True 2010 192"&gt;{{cite book|title=Gender Matters in Global Politics: A Feminist Introduction to International Relations|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=New York and London|page=192|author=Jacqui True|chapter=Mainstreaming Gender in International Institutions|editor=Laura J. Shepherd}}&lt;/ref&gt;   ''difference feminism'',&lt;ref name="Jacqui True 2010 192"/&gt; and ''poststructuralist feminism''.&lt;ref name="Jacqui True 2010 193"&gt;{{cite book|title=Gender Matters in Global Politics: A Feminist Introduction to International Relations|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=New York and London|page=193|author=Jacqui True|chapter=Mainstreaming Gender in International Institutions|editor=Laura J. Shepherd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In terms of feminist international relations, gender theory engages directly with the notion of mainstreaming gender in both ''institutional politics''&lt;ref name="Jacqui True 2010 194"&gt;{{cite book|title=Gender Matters in Global Politics: A Feminist Introduction to International Relations|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=New York and London|page=194|author=Jacqui True|chapter=Mainstreaming Gender in International Institutions|editor=Laura J. Shepherd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and ''discursive politics''.&lt;ref name="Jacqui True 2010 194"/&gt;

''Liberal feminism'' deals specifically with policy-making, and requires that women as well as perspectives on both women's and men's lived realities are fairly included and represented in that policy-making.&lt;ref name="Jacqui True 2010 192"/&gt;  With regard to liberal feminism, gender theory contemplates, for example, what is meant by the term “women,” whose perspectives on “women’s” and “men’s” lived realities are considered valuable in facilitating fair representation in policy-making, and what aspects of life are considered components of “lived reality”.

''Difference feminism'' focusses on empowering women in particular through specific designs, implementations, and evaluations of policies that account for the material and cultural differences between men and women and their significance.&lt;ref name="Jacqui True 2010 192"/&gt;  With regard to difference feminism, gender theory questions, again, what is meant by the term “women;” what factors might lead to “women” requiring specific designs, implementations, and evaluations of policies; what is considered to constitute “difference” in the material and cultural experience of “men” and “women;” and what aspects of that “difference” suppose its especial significance.

''Poststructuralist feminism'' prioritizes difference and diversity to the extent that it recognizes all identities as absolutely contingent social constructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Leona M. |last=English |article=Poststructuralist Feminism |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Case Study Research |publisher=SAGE Publications |editor=Albert J. Mills |editor2=Gabrielle Durepos |editor3=Elden Wiebe |pages=711–714 |date=2010 |doi=10.4135/9781412957397.n262}}&lt;/ref&gt;   With regard to poststructuralist feminism, gender theory points out that due to this ontological and epistemological discursiveness, poststructuralist feminism can, in some cases, risk understanding the subjects in policy-making as distinct social subjectivities primarily and/or exclusively in terms of gender difference, rather than in terms of the multiplicities of difference that comprise subjectivities in poststructural feminist thought.&lt;ref name="Jacqui True 2010 193"/&gt; Discourse starts with the assertion that the public/private divide has meaningfully contributed to women's marginalization. In order to disrupt this marginalization, feminists must challenge the very assumptions that construct our ideas of identity and citizenship. Primarily, poststructuralist feminism seeks to advance Judith Butler's conception of gender as ‘performative’, whereby there is no pertinent conception of gender outside of the social construction of masculinity or femininity. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender Matters in Global Politics: A Feminist Introduction to International Relations|last=Hansen|first=Lene|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=978-0-415-71521-8|location=New York|pages=14-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Rationalist feminism'' parallels Neorealist thought by placing the state as the primary actor within international relations. It is also linked to Liberal thought, insofar as it highlights ‘democratic peace’ literature, creating an overlap between the paradigms. Relating to gender, rationalist feminism explores not only how war arises, but specifically how gender affects the causes, likelihood and outcome of conflict. Rationalist feminists have, broadly, two strains of research: quantitative foreign policy and comparative case studies. Quantitative foreign policy - may, for example, explore the correlation between gender equality and likelihood of war, or the gender gap on foreign policy opinions. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Comparative case studies - may, for example, include looking at sex-selective abortions in different states, the policies that lead to gender disparity and the consequences of such gender disparity.

''Institutional politics'' describes the political, material, bureaucratic, and organizational relationships and conventions that govern administrative institutions.&lt;ref name="Jacqui True 2010 194"/&gt; Gender theory seeks to examine the ways in which these normalized relationships and conventions shape the policy-making processes of and within these institutions.

''Discursive politics'' refers to the ways in which institutionalized norms, policy procedures, organizational identities, and material structures shape the language and meaning of gender equality and/or difference therein.&lt;ref name="Jacqui True 2010 194"/&gt;  Gender theory, with regard to discursive politics, for instance, would examine the identities, the constitutive categories,&lt;ref name="Butler 1990 44"/&gt;  created and/or perpetuated by the language and meaning of gender equality and/or difference in such international institutions.

==Barriers to femininities and female bodies==

	There are different theories that come into play on femininity and female's bodies when speaking about International Relations and the role females have within it. One theory known as a ‘constructivist’ account of gender, lends itself to arguing that your sex is biological, that is, you are born with it, thus being natural and your gender is something that is social, or learned within the constructs of society. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender Matters in Global Politics: An Introduction to Global Politics|last=Shepherd|first=Laura J.|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=978-0-415-71521-8|location=New York|pages=25-35}}&lt;/ref&gt;A feminist approach to international relations also provides analyses for not only theoretical understandings of gender relations, but also the consequences that perpetuate the subordination of femininities and female-bodies. ‘Women’ (female bodies + performed femininities) endure a higher level of criticism for their actions, personalities, and behaviours within the public and private spheres, particularly while running for political office, whether this at the local or national levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wasburn|first1=Philo|last2=Wasburn|first2=Mara|title=Media Coverage of Women in Politics: The curious case of Sarah Palin|journal=Media, Culture &amp; Society|date=2011|volume=7|issue=33|pages=1027–1041}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to a perception of politically ambitious women as either being too feminine or too masculine, to be capable of the job that certain offices demand. This is typically linked to the ideal that women will take care of ‘women’s issues’, such as education and abortion, while men will take care of ‘men’s issues’ such as the military, national security, and the economy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wasburn|first1=Philo|last2=Wasburn|first2=Mara|title=Media Coverage of Women in Politics: The curious case of Sarah Palin|journal=Media, Culture &amp; Society|date=2011|volume=33|issue=7|pages=1027–1041|doi=10.1177/0163443711415744}}&lt;/ref&gt; This way of thinking can be attributed to the ‘essentialist’ account of gender and plays into the deeply held belief by many in our society that both men and women inherently hold true to their ‘essence’ of either being feminine or masculine. Women are often viewed as being a caring nurturer in comparison to most men being viewed as aggressive and brash. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;It is critical that researchers seek to explain further the barriers that women endure in their attempts to attain political office on any level. To begin with, there must be a consideration of women's socioeconomic status, and thus a difficulty in funding a campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coffe|first1=Hilde|title=Women Stay Local, Men Go National and Global? Gender Differences in Political Interest.|journal=Sex Roles|date=2013|volume=69|pages=323–338|doi=10.1007/s11199-013-0308-x}}&lt;!--|accessdate=15 March 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; While women are more educated in the western world than ever before, the average woman's socioeconomic powers still do not match the average man's.&lt;ref&gt;Coffé, Hilde. “Women Stay Local, Men Go National and Global? Gender Differences in Political Interest.” Sex Roles 69 (2013) : 323-338. Web. 15 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; This results in a further consequence for women, as employment is positively related to one's ability to attain political information, and to build internal political efficacy. Thus, not only does socioeconomic status lead to a lesser ability to finance a political campaign for women, but it also leads to lower levels of political efficacy, impacting women's participation in politics from the very beginning.

	Further barriers exist into women's entrance into politics, which include, but are not limited to, attachment to the private sphere and the scrutiny of the media. Media coverage of campaigns can be particularly detrimental to a woman's ability to attain political office. The media focuses far more on physical appearance and lifestyle, rather than the prominent political questions of the campaign, for female candidates.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Further, women receive less overall media coverage, the media questions women's abilities and potential for future power, as well as focusing on what are deemed as ‘women’s issues’. These kinds of coverage discourage voters from voting or contributing to the campaigns of female candidates, and moreover, discourage women from entering into a campaign.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Thus, the media has demonstrated its ability to deem candidates either capable or ill-suited for political office, simply through the dialogue in which they use, that perpetuates systems of disqualification for women. These dialogues place men in positions of high politics, and reinforce symbolic understandings of ‘women’s issues’ versus ‘men’s issues’, and who best represents offices of high-politics due to naturalized understandings of individual's bodies and gendered identities. Through a feminist lens of international relations however, we may understand the systemic nature of these perceptions of the relationships between bodies and identities in order to discount popular dialogue, and find places for women within high-politics. The way forward would be for people to create their own ‘feminist curiosity’ in order to challenge the status quo and push forward on the stage of Feminism in the International Relations Arena. To view gender as ‘performative’ instead of just something we are born with or into. To pull from Judith Butler's work and view “the sexed body as much a product of discourses about gender as discourse about gender are a product of the sexed body.” &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Critique==
Certain parts of the academic realm of IR theory did not offer the feminist perspective serious attention because of differences with its ways of addressing problems within the discipline.&lt;ref name="Keohane, R. O. 1998"&gt;Keohane, R. O. (1998). Beyond dichotomy: Conversations between international relations and feminist theory. International Studies Quarterly, 42(1):193-197&lt;/ref&gt; Some circles within social sciences are increasingly employing a hypothetico-deductivist way of looking at social phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Model-Discipline-Political-Science-Representations/dp/019538220X&lt;/ref&gt; In that context, feminist perspective is criticized for providing a more politically engaged way of looking at issues than a problem-solving way. [[Robert Keohane]] has suggested that feminists formulate verifiable problems, collect data, and proceed only scientifically when attempting to solve issues.&lt;ref name="Keohane, R. O. 1998"/&gt; Unsurprisingly, Keohane's suggestion received a cold reaction from feminists; one particular  rebuttal was entitled “You Still Don’t Understand: Why Troubled Engagements Continue between Feminists and (Critical) IPE.”.&lt;ref&gt;Waylen, Georgina. 2006. “You Still Don’t Understand: Why Troubled Engagements Continue between Feminists and (Critical) IPE.” Review of International Studies 32(1):145–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Campaigns ==

The current campaign priorities of Friends of the Earth Europe are:
* [[Climate justice]] and energy
* Food, agriculture and [[biodiversity]]
* [[Economic inequality|Economic justice]]
* [[Resource justice]] and sustainability

=== Climate justice and energy ===
Friends of the Earth Europe is "working to create the much-needed, fair and urgent transition to a [[fossil fuel]] free Europe. It wants to deliver a 100% renewable, no nuclear, super energy-efficient, zero-fossil-fuel Europe by 2030."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foeeurope.org/fossilfreeeurope|title=Fossil Free Europe|website=Friends of the Earth Europe|access-date=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization calls for radical improvements in energy efficiency, an accelerated phase-out of fossil fuels, a dramatic shift towards community-owned renewable energies, and reduced overall resource consumption and lifestyle changes. This often means targeting [[extractive industries]], especially those who are involved in fracking and tar sands extraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foeeurope.org/renewable-energy|title=Renewable energy|website=Friends of the Earth Europe|access-date=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foeeurope.org/extractive-industries|title=Extractive industries|website=Friends of the Earth Europe|access-date=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foeeurope.org/energy-savings|title=Energy savings|website=Friends of the Earth Europe|access-date=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Food, agriculture and biodiversity ===

The organization has been a key participant in the European movement against GMO&lt;nowiki/&gt;s which has been successful in stopping the planting of [[Genetically modified crops|GM crops]] across most of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foeeurope.org/gmos|title=GMOs|website=Friends of the Earth Europe|access-date=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization advocates for more environmentally friendly, equitable and sustainable farming. This includes campaigning to reform the European [[Common Agricultural Policy|Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)]] in ways that can mitigate climate change emissions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foeeurope.org/CAP|title=The Common Agricultural Policy|website=Friends of the Earth Europe|access-date=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; (especially through reducing reliance on soy imports for livestock&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foeeurope.org/soy-change-south-america-paying-price-europe-factory-farms-140717|title=Soy change: time to stop South America paying the price for Europe&amp;amp;#039;s factory farms|website=Friends of the Earth Europe|access-date=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;), protect biodiversity, and stop the collapse of family farming in Europe’s agriculture sector.

FoEE has also been active in its opposition to EU trade deals, such as the [[Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement|CETA]] agreement with Canada and [[Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership|TTIP]] with the US, because of a belief that those trade deals do not support human rights and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foeeurope.org/EU-US-trade-deal|title=EU-US trade deal|website=Friends of the Earth Europe|access-date=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of FoEE’s campaigns aims to protect nature and biodiversity by supporting local groups in their preservation initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foeeurope.org/nature|title=Nature|website=Friends of the Earth Europe|access-date=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic Justice ===
Friends of the Earth Europe’s economic justice program is occupied with the influence of companies over EU decision-making and the economic, social and environmental consequences of corporate practices. It works to expose cases of corporate capture of EU regulation and examples of the influence of corporate interests over EU policy process which often results in a lack of regulation or weak regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foeeurope.org/corporate-capture|title=Corporate capture|website=Friends of the Earth Europe|access-date=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foeeurope.org/conflicts-of-interest|title=Conflicts of interest|website=Friends of the Earth Europe|access-date=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foeeurope.org/deregulation|title=Deregulation|website=Friends of the Earth Europe|access-date=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program looks into the issue of European companies which have subsidiaries outside of Europe. Such subsidiaries of multinational companies often fail to respect EU laws and workers’ rights when operating abroad, and victims too often do not have access to justice. It campaigns for guarantees that companies abide by the same safety and social standards for their workers and facilities outside of Europe as in Europe; and that European companies are held accountable for their practices outside of Europe, in particular in cases of abuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foeeurope.org/corporate-accountability|title=Corporate accountability|website=Friends of the Earth Europe|access-date=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the area of lobby transparency, FoEE looks at how companies exert their influence over and sometimes directly shape decision-making in the EU. It campaigns in favor of transparency in business influence and more balanced representation of stakeholders in EU policy making. FoEE has been active in exposing cases of revolving door scandals, misleading lobby registrations and deceptive lobby practices. It has been lobbying EU Commission and Parliament in favor of stricter EU legislation in order to close the current loopholes and prevent such scandals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foeeurope.org/lobby-transparency|title=Lobby transparency|website=Friends of the Earth Europe|access-date=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resource justice and sustainability===

FoEE recognizes and promotes the environmental, economic and social benefits of reducing Europe’s resource consumption. They focus on reducing Europe’s land, water, materials and carbon use – including the embedded resources Europe consumes beyond its borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foeeurope.org/water-use|title=Water use|website=Friends of the Earth Europe|access-date=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foeeurope.org/extractive-industries|title=Extractive industries|website=Friends of the Earth Europe|access-date=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foeeurope.org/land|title=Land|website=Friends of the Earth Europe|access-date=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization promotes the reuse and recycling of materials, opposes incineration, and is calling for the full implementation of the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] and the [https://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/policies/european-development-policy/2030-agenda-sustainable-development_en EU 2030 Agenda].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foeeurope.org/materials-and-waste|title=Materials and waste|website=Friends of the Earth Europe|access-date=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== School of Sustainability ==
FoEE’s School of Sustainability project is inspired by the Latin American ''Escuela de la Sustentabilidad.'' Driven by popular education techniques, the project aims to strengthen the regional network of Friends of the Earth Europe, and create common political analyses of system change from a social justice, environmental justice and human rights perspective, and challenge oppression, power and privilege.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foeeurope.org/school-of-sustainability|title=School of Sustainability|website=Friends of the Earth Europe|access-date=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Coalitions ==

FoEE is an active member of many coalitions working on environmental issues in Europe including:
* '''The Green 10''',&lt;ref name="Green 10 website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.green10.org/ |title=Green 10 Website |publisher=Green10.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; consisting of [[BirdLife International]] (European Community Office), [[Climate Action Network]] Europe (CAN Europe), [https://bankwatch.org/ CEE Bankwatch Network],&lt;ref name="CEE Bankwatch Network"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bankwatch.org/ |title=CEE Bankwatch Network Website |publisher=Bankwatch.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[European Environmental Bureau]] (EEB), [[European Federation for Transport and Environment]] (T&amp;E), Health and Environment Alliance, [[Greenpeace]] Europe, International [[Friends of Nature]] (IFN), [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] European Policy Office and Friends of the Earth Europe.

ALTER-EU gathers 160 civil society groups that are concerned by the growing influence of the corporate sector on EU decision-making.
* '''The European Coalition for Corporate Justice'''

==Youth Network (Young Friends of the Earth Europe)==

{{See also|Young Friends of the Earth}}
In 2007 a youth network called [[Young Friends of the Earth|Young Friends of the Earth Europe]] (YFoEE), was established by national Young Friends of the Earth groups affiliated to FoE member groups. YFoEE is an autonomous and self organised youth-led network, with structures and ways of working set and led by young people, yet retains strong links to Friends of the Earth Europe and the [[Friends of the Earth|Friends of the Earth International]] Federation and their mission, vision and values&lt;ref name="YFoEE Website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foeeurope.org/youngfoee/index.htm |title=Young Friends of the Earth Europe Website |publisher=Foeeurope.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The YFoEE network unites youth organisations and youth groups working on social and environmental justice in Europe, and runs campaigning and educational activities for young people on a European level. It consists of youth member groups in 15 countries from both EU and Non EU countries, including [[Natur og Ungdom]] (Norway),&lt;ref name="Natur og Ungdom Website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nu.no/ |title=Natur og Ungdom Website |language=no |publisher=Nu.no |date=2012-10-31 |accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[BUNDjugend]] (Germany)&lt;ref name="BUNDjugend Website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bundjugend.de/ |title=BUNDjugend Website |publisher=Bundjugend.de |date= |accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; or YFoE Ukraine.&lt;ref name="YFoE Ukraine Website"&gt;[http://melp.dp.ua/ YFoE Ukraine Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The key campaigning topic of the network since 2007 has been advocating for [[climate justice]], in particular opposing what it considers to be false solutions to climate change,&lt;ref name="HOODWINKED IN THE HOTHOUSE: False Solutions to Climate Change"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carbontradewatch.org/publications/hoodwinked-in-the-hothouse-false-solutions-to-climate-c.html |title=HOODWINKED IN THE HOTHOUSE: False Solutions to Climate Change |publisher=Carbontradewatch.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as nuclear energy,&lt;ref&gt;

YFoEE has been active as part of the [[Youth Climate Movement]] and youth delegation at the UNFCCC international climate negotiations, and is one of the founding members of European Youth Climate Movement.&lt;ref name="European Youth Climate Movement Website"&gt;{{cite web|author=L aura, Sep 30, 2009 3:47 PM |url=http://sites.google.com/site/europeanyouthclimatemovement/ |title=European Youth Climate Movement Website |publisher=Sites.google.com |date=2009-09-30 |accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ways of working===

The YFoEE network is supported by a secretariat in the office of FoEE in Brussels, and coordinated by a Steering Group of 8 volunteers, elected from the YFoEE network annually at the Annual General Meeting. 
Campaigns and events are led and developed by individual volunteers and representatives of member groups who make up working groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foeeurope.org/about/how-we-work|title=How we work|website=Friends of the Earth Europe|access-date=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revenue==

Friends of the Earth Europe receives funding from a variety of government and non-government sources. These include the [[European Commission]] under the ‘LIFE+ regulation’, the European Climate Foundation, Oak Foundation, and Isvara Foundation, amongst others. It also gets membership fees from national Friends of the Earth groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foeeurope.org/about/financial|title=Our funding|website=Friends of the Earth Europe|access-date=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Front for National Salvation''' ('''FRONASA''') was a [[Uganda]]n rebel group formed by [[Yoweri Museveni]] in 1972. [[Kikosi Maalum]] (led by [[Milton Obote]]) and FRONASA, as well as several smaller groups including [[Save Uganda Movement]] and [[Uganda Freedom Union]], formed the [[Uganda National Liberation Front]] (UNLF) and its military wing the Uganda National Liberation Army (UNLA) in 1979 to fight alongside [[Tanzania People's Defence Force|Tanzanian forces]] against Idi Amin.

== Synopsis ==
The film tells three stories which are separate and at times connected. In the first one, the young filmmaker Balthazar is looking for money in [[Kigali]] to produce his debut film, ''Le cycle du cafard'', but the government refuses to finance a film based on the aftermath of the [[Rwandan Genocide|genocide in Rwanda]]. In the second, Balthazar's film takes shape and portrays a man, locked up in an asylum, who was an [[genocidaires|assassin]] during the [[Rwandan Civil War|war]]. In the third story, Yvan and Justine, brother and sister, are two young survivors who are trying to rebuild their lives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.festivalcinemaafricano.org/eng/index.php?pag=vis_film&amp;id_film=838 African, Asian and Latin American Film Festival - Milan] - 22nd edition ([http://www.festivalcinemaafricano.org license CC BY-SA])&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1213">'''Iconomaques''' is the name of a group of [[Luxembourg]] artists who moved away from [[figurative art]] in order to promote [[abstract art]]. Created in 1954, the founding members were [[Will Dahlem]], [[Henri Dillenbourg]], [[François Gillen]], [[Emile Kirscht]], [[Joseph Probst]], [[Wenzel Profant]], [[Michel Stoffel]] and [[Lucien Wercollier]]. Iconomaque held its first exhibition on 19 June 1954 at the National Museum in [[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg City]] and at the townhall in [[Esch-sur-Alzette]]. After a second exhibition in 1959, the group did not arrange any further activities.&lt;ref&gt;"Luxemburger Lexikon", ''Editions Guy Binsfeld'', Luxembourg, 2006. {{De icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intelsat 701''' (also known as '''IS-702''' and '''Intelsat 7-F2''') is a [[geostationary]] [[communication]] [[satellite]] that was built by [[Space Systems/Loral]] ('''SSL'''). It is located in the orbital position of 32.9 degrees east longitude and it is currently in an [[inclined orbit]]. The same is owned by [[Intelsat]]. The satellite was based on the HS-601 platform and its estimated useful life was 15 years.

The satellite was successfully launched into space on June 17, 1994, at 07:07:19 UTC, using an [[Ariane 4]]4L vehicle from the [[Guiana Space Center]] in [[French Guiana]], together with the satellites [[Defence Research Agency|STRV 1A]] and [[Defence Research Agency|STRV 1B]]. It had a launch mass of 3,695&amp;nbsp;kg.

The Intelsat 702 is equipped with 26 transponders in [[C band (IEEE)|C band]] and 10 in [[Ku band]] to provide broadcasting, business-to-home services, [[telecommunications]], VSATnetworks.

'''International relations from 1648–1814''' covers the major interactions of the nations of Europe, as well as the other continents, with emphasis on diplomacy, warfare, migration, and cultural interactions, from the [[Peace of Westphalia]] to the [[Congress of Vienna]]. It is followed by [[International relations of the Great Powers (1814–1919)]].

== Diplomacy and warfare ==
The 17th century, 1601–1700, saw very little peace in Europe – major wars were fought every year except 1610, 1669 to 1671, and 1680 to 1682.&lt;ref&gt;John A. Mears, "The Emergence Of The Standing Professional Army in Seventeenth-Century Europe," ''Social Science Quarterly'' (1969) 50#1 pp. 106–115 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/42858465 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; The wars were unusually ugly. Europe in the late 17th century, 1648 to 1700, was an age of great intellectual, scientific, artistic and cultural achievement. Historian Frederick Nussbaum says it was:
:prolific in genius, in common sense, and in organizing ability. It could properly have been expected that intelligence, comprehension and high purpose would be applied to the control of human relations in general and to the relations between states and peoples in particular. The fact was almost completely opposite. It was a period of marked unintelligence, immorality and frivolity in the conduct of international relations, marked by wars undertaken for dimly conceived purposes, waged with the utmost brutality and conducted by reckless betrayals of allies.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick L. Nussbaum, ''The Triumph of Science and Reason, 1660–1685'' (1953) pp 147–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

The worst came during the [[Thirty Years' War]], 1618–1648, which had an extremely negative impact on the civilian population of Germany and surrounding areas, with massive loss of life and disruption of the economy and society. Scholars taking a [[Realism (international relations)|"realist" perspective]] on wars and diplomacy have emphasized the [[Peace of Westphalia]] (1648) as a dividing line. It ended the [[Thirty Years War]] (1618–1648), where religion and ideology had been powerful motivating forces for warfare. Westphalia, in the realist view, ushered in a new international system of sovereign states of roughly equal strength, dedicated not to ideology or religion but to enhance status, and territorial gains. The Catholic Church, for example, no longer devoted its energies to the very difficult task of reclaiming dioceses lost to Protestantism, but to build large-scale missions in overseas colonial possessions that could convert the natives by the thousands Using devoted members of society such as the Jesuits.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Davies, ''Europe: A History'' (1996) p 593–94.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Scott Hamish, the realist model assumes that "foreign policies were guided entirely by "Realpolitik," by the resulting struggle for resources and, eventually, by the search for what became known as a 'balance of power.'&lt;ref&gt;Scott Hamish, book review in ''English Historical Review'' (Oct 2013) pp 1239–1241.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diplomacy before 1700 was not well developed, and chances to avoid wars were too often squandered. In England, for example, King Charles II paid little attention to diplomacy, which proved disastrous. During the Dutch war of 1665–67, England had no diplomats stationed in Denmark or Sweden. When King Charles realized he needed them as allies, he sent special missions that were uninformed about local political, military, and diplomatic situations, and were ignorant of personalities and political factionalism. Ignorance produced a series of blunders that ruined their efforts to find allies.&lt;ref&gt;J.R. Jones, ''Britain and the World: 1649–1815'' (1980), pp 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

France set the standards for the new professional diplomacy, which were soon emulated by the other powers; the French language became the diplomatic tongue. The professional model slowly spread other national government agencies, and included distinct specified scope of operations, a full-time career oriented professional leadership at the top and middle ranks; a code of ethics and standards of expected behavior; and attractive pay scales and retirement pensions. Expertise was highly valued, although at the very highest level aristocratic status and family connections played an important role. The new bureaucracy preserved its documents carefully and central archives, maintain a professional office staff, and gained a reputation at home and abroad for the quality of its work in expressing both the short term needs and long-term alliances and values of the state.&lt;ref&gt;John C. Rule, "Colbert de Torcy, an emergent bureaucracy, and the formulation of French foreign policy, 1698–1715." in Ragnhild Hatton, ed., ''Louis XIV and Europe'' (1976) pp. 261–288.&lt;/ref&gt; King Louis XIV of France worked hard to systematically develop the most sophisticated diplomatic service, with permanent ambassadors and lesser ministers in major and minor capitals, all preparing steady streams of information and advice to Paris. Diplomacy became a career that proved highly attractive to rich senior aristocrats who enjoyed very high society at royal courts, especially because they carried the status of the most powerful nation in Europe. Increasingly, other nations copied the French model; French became the language of diplomacy, replacing Latin.&lt;ref&gt;Gaston Zeller, "French diplomacy and foreign policy in their European setting." in Carsten, ed., ''The New Cambridge Modern History'' vol 5 (1961) p 198–99, 206.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1700, the British and the Dutch, with small land armies, large navies, and large treasuries, used astute diplomacy to build alliances, subsidizing as needed land powers to fight on their side, or as in the case of the Hessians, hiring regiments of soldiers from mercenary princes in small countries.&lt;ref&gt;Charles W. Ingrao, ''The Hessian mercenary state: ideas, institutions, and reform under Frederick II, 1760–1785'' (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; The balance of power was very delicately calculated, so that winning a battle here was worth the slice of territory there, with no regard to the wishes of the inhabitants. Important peacemaking conferences at Utrecht (1713), Vienna (1738), Aix-la-Chapelle (1748) and Paris (1763) had a cheerful, cynical, game-like atmosphere in which professional diplomats cashed in victories like casino chips in exchange for territory.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, ''Europe'' (1996) pp 581–82.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second Hundred Years' War: France as the pivot of warfare ==
{{Main|Second Hundred Years' War}}
In 1648 France was the leading European power, and most of the wars pivoted around its aggressiveness. Only poverty-stricken Russia exceeded it in population, and no one could match its wealth, central location, and a very strong professional army. It had largely avoided the devastation of the Thirty Years War. Its weaknesses included an inefficient financial system that was hard-pressed to pay for all the military adventures, and the tendency of most other powers to gang up against it.

During the very long reign of [[Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV (1643–1715)]], France fought three major wars: the [[Franco-Dutch War]], the [[Nine Years' War|War of the League of Augsburg]], and the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. There were also two lesser conflicts: the [[War of Devolution]] and the [[War of the Reunions]].&lt;ref&gt;John A. Lynn, ''The Wars of Louis XIV 1667–1714'' (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; The wars were very expensive but they defined Louis XIV's foreign policies, and his personality shaped his approach. Impelled "by a mix of commerce, revenge, and pique," Louis sensed that warfare was the ideal way to enhance his glory. In peacetime he concentrated on preparing for the next war. He taught his diplomats that their job was to create tactical and strategic advantages for the French military.&lt;ref&gt;James Nathan, "Force, Order, and Diplomacy in the Age of Louis XIV." ''Virginia Quarterly Review'' 69#4 (1993) 633+.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1695, France retained much of its dominance, but had lost control of the seas to the combination of England and Holland. What's more, most countries, both Protestant and Catholic, were in alliance against it. [[Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban|Vauban, France's leading military strategist]] warned the king in 1689 that a hostile "Alliance" was too powerful at sea. He recommended the best way for France to fight back was to license French merchants ships to privateer and seize enemy merchant ships, while avoiding its navies:
:France has its declared enemies Germany and all the states that it embraces; Spain with all its dependencies in Europe, Asia, Africa and America; the Duke of Savoy [in Italy], England, Scotland, Ireland, and all their colonies in the East and West Indies; and Holland with all its possessions in the four corners of the world where it has great establishments. France has ... undeclared enemies, indirectly hostile hostile and envious of its greatness, Denmark, Sweden, Poland, Portugal, Venice, Genoa, and part of the Swiss Confederation, all of which states secretly aid France's enemies by the troops that they hire to them, the money they lend them and by protecting and covering their trade.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Geoffrey Simcox, ed., ''War, Diplomacy, and Imperialism, 1618–1763'' (1974), pp. 236-37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vauban was pessimistic about France's so-called friends and allies:
:For lukewarm, useless, or impotent friends, France has the Pope, who is indifferent; the King of England [James II] expelled from his country; the Grand Duke of Tuscany; the Dukes of Mantua, Modena, and Parma [all in Italy]; and the other faction of the Swiss. Some of these are sunk in the softness that comes of years of peace, the others are cool in their affections. ... The English and Dutch are the main pillars of the Alliance; they support it by making war against us in concert with the other powers, and they keep it going by means of the money that they pay every year to ... Allies. ... We must, therefore, fall back on privateering as the method of conducting war which is most feasible, simple, cheap, and safe, and which will cost least to the state, the more so since any losses will not be felt by the King, who risks virtually nothing. ... It will enrich the country, train many good officers for the King, and in a short time force his enemies to sue for peace.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Simcox, pp. 237, 242.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Europe 1648–1721 ==
The European political scene changed in the late 17th century. Warfare was still more powerful influence than demography, economics or diplomacy, so the major changes resulted from a series of large wars. At first France, with the largest population in the West, a well-developed economy, and a good Navy, was predominant.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich, ''The age of the baroque, 1610–1660'' (1952) pp. 246–66.&lt;/ref&gt; It lost part of its preeminence in stages during a series of major wars: the Nine Years War, the War of the Spanish Succession, the Turkish wars of 1683–1699 and 1714–1718, and the great Northern war. Europe was largely regionalized, with wars fought either in the West, the North, or the Southeast. By 1700, there were five major states, Britain, France, Spain, Russia, and the Habsburg monarchy (also called Austria, or the Holy Roman Empire). Prussia was emerging primarily because of its aggressive leadership and its advances in the military arts. Spain, the Netherlands, Poland, Venice, Sweden and the Ottoman Empire were declining powers after losses in a series of wars.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich, ''The Age of the Baroque, 1610–1660'' (1952) pp. 197–245.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1659 treaty of the Pyrenees marked Spain's submission to France. The major powers each developed sophisticated diplomatic, military, and financial systems at the national level, with a striking fall-off of the autonomy of regional aristocrats. England, although wracked with an intense civil war (1642–1646), managed to gain strength internationally. Its Royal Navy reigned supreme on the oceans after a [[Anglo-Dutch Wars|series of wars with the Netherlands.]] As an island nation secure from invasion, it could keep its army small, and invest in subsidies to support the armies of smaller countries to maintain its alliances. Its policy was to use diplomacy and enter wars on the weaker side so as to maintain a balance of power, and to thwart the danger of France maintaining its preeminence.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew A. Lossky, "International Relations in Europe," in J.S. Bromley, ed. ''The New Cambridge Modern History'', vol 6 pp 154–192.&lt;/ref&gt;
===Espionage===
The 18th century saw a dramatic expansion of espionage activities.  It was a time of war: in nine years out of 10, two or more major powers were at war. Armies grew much larger, with corresponding budgets. Likewise the foreign ministries all grew in size and complexity. National budgets expanded to pay for these expansions, and room was found for intelligence departments with full-time staffs, and well-paid spies and agents. The militaries themselves became more bureaucratised, and sent out military attaches. They were very bright, personable middle-ranking officers stationed in embassies abroad. In each capital, the attached days evaluated the strength, capabilities, and war plan plans of the armies and navies. France under King Louis XIV was the largest, richest, and most powerful nation. It had many enemies and a few friends, and tried to keep track of them all through a well organized intelligence system. France and England pioneered the [[cabinet noir]] whereby foreign correspondence was opened and deciphered, then forwarded to the recipient. France's chief ministers, especially [[Cardinal Mazarin]]  (1642–1661) did not invent the new methods; they combined the best practices from other states, and supported it at the highest political and financial levels.&lt;ref&gt;William J. Roosen, "The functioning of ambassadors under Louis XIV." ''French Historical Studies'' 6.3 (1970): 311-332.

The [[Great Turkish War]] or the "War of the Holy League" was a series of conflicts between the [[Ottoman Empire]] and ad-hoc European coalition the [[Holy League (1684)|Holy League]] (Latin: ''Sacra Ligua''). The coalition was organized by [[Pope Innocent XI]] and included the [[Papal States]], the [[Holy Roman Empire]] under Habsburg Emperor [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]], the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] of [[John III Sobieski]], and the [[Venetian Republic]]; [[Tsardom of Russia|Russia]] joined the League in 1686. Intensive fighting began in 1683 when Ottoman commander [[Kara Mustafa]] brought an army of 200,000 soldiers to besiege, Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Millar, ''Vienna 1683: Christian Europe Repels the Ottomans'' (Osprey, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; The issue was control of Central and Eastern Europe. By September, the invaders were defeated in full retreat down the Danube. It ended with the signing of the [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] in 1699. The war was a defeat for the Ottoman Empire, which for the first time lost large amounts of territory. It lost lands in Hungary and Poland, as well as part of the western Balkans. The war marked the first time Russia was involved in a western European alliance.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, ''The Emergence of the Great Powers: 1685–1715'' (1951), pp 15–53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Meyer Setton, '' Venice, Austria, and the Turks in the Seventeenth Century'' (Memoirs of the American Philosophical Society, 1991) [https://books.google.com/books?id=XN51y209fR8C&amp;dq=%22great+turkish+war%22+%22%27%27The+Emergence+of+the+Great+Powers:+1685-1715%27%27%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s excerpt]&lt;/ref&gt;

===British policy under William III 1689-1702===
{{Further|History of the foreign relations of the United Kingdom}}
The primary reason the English elite called on  [[William III of England|William]] to invade England in 1688 was to overthrow [[James II of England|King James II]], and stop his efforts to reestablish Catholicism and tolerate Puritanism. However the primary reason William accepted the challenge was to gain a powerful ally in his war to contain the threatened expansion of King [[Louis XIV of France]].  William's goal was to build coalitions against the powerful French monarchy, protect the autonomy of the Netherlands (where William continued in power) and to keep the Spanish Netherlands (present-day Belgium) out of French hands. The English elite was intensely anti—French,  and Generally supported William's broad goals.&lt;ref&gt;George Clark, ''The Later Stuarts, 1660–1714'' (2nd ed. 1956)  pp 148-53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clayton Roberts et al., ''A History of England: volume I Prehistory to 1714'' (5th ed. 2013) pp 245-48.&lt;/ref&gt;  For his entire career in Netherlands and Britain, William was the arch-enemy of Louis XIV. The French king, in turn, denounced William  as a usurper who had illegally taken the throne from the legitimate King James II, and ought to be overthrown.&lt;ref&gt;Mark A. Thomson, "Louis XIV and William III, 1689-1697." ''English Historical Review'' 76.298 (1961): 37-58. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/557057 online]&lt;/ref&gt;  In May 1689, William, now king of England, with the support of Parliament, declared war on France.

England and France were at war almost continuously until 1713, with a short interlude 1697-1701 made possible by the [[Treaty of Ryswick]].&lt;ref&gt;Clark, ''The Later Stuarts, 1660–1714'' (1956)  pp 160-79.&lt;/ref&gt;  The combined English and Dutch fleets could overpower France in a far-flung naval war, but France still had superiority on land. William wanted to neutralize that advantage by allying with [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]], the Habsburg Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire (1658-1705), who was based in Vienna, Austria.  Leopold, however, Was tied down in [[Great Turkish War|war with the Ottoman Empire]] on his eastern frontiers; William worked to achieve a negotiated settlement between the Ottomans and the Empire. William displayed in imaginative Europe-wide strategy, but Louis always managed to come up with a counter play.&lt;ref&gt;For the European context, see J.S. Bromley, ed. ''The New Cambridge Modern History, VI: The Rise of Great Britain and Russia, 1688-1725'' (1970) pp 154-192, 223-67, 284-90, 381-415, 741-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

William was usually supported by the English leadership, which saw France as its greatest enemy. But eventually the  expenses, and war weariness, caused second thoughts.  At first, Parliament voted him the funds for his expensive wars, and for his subsidies to smaller allies. Private investors created the  [[Bank of England]] in 1694; it provided a sound system that made financing wars much easier by encouraging bankers to loan money.&lt;ref&gt;John Brewer, ''The sinews of power: War, money, and the English state, 1688-1783'' (1989) p 133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark, ''The Later Stuarts, 1660–1714'' (1956)  pp 174-79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen B. Baxter. ''William III and the Defense of European Liberty, 1650-1702'' (1966), pp 288-401.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nine Years War: 1688–1697 ===
{{Main|Nine Years' War}}
The [[Nine Years' War]] (1688–97) also called the '''War of the League of Augsburg''' was a major conflict between France and a European-wide coalition of Austria and the Holy Roman Empire, the Dutch Republic, Spain, Britain, and Savoy. It was fought on the European continent and the surrounding seas, Ireland, North America and in India. It is sometimes considered the first truly [[global war]]. It also encompassed a [[Williamite war in Ireland|theatre in Ireland]] and [[Jacobite risings|in Scotland]], where William III and [[James II of England|James II]] struggled for control of Britain and Ireland, and a campaign in colonial North America between French and English settlers and their respective Indian allies, today called '''[[King William's War]]''' by Americans.&lt;ref&gt;John B. Wolf, ''The Emergence of the Great Powers: 1685–1715'' (1951) pp 15–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis XIV had emerged from the [[Franco-Dutch War]] in 1678 as the most powerful monarch in Europe, an absolute ruler who had won numerous military victories. Using a combination of aggression, annexation, and quasi-legal means, Louis XIV set about extending his gains to stabilize and strengthen France's frontiers, culminating in the brief [[War of the Reunions]] (1683–84). The resulting [[Truce of Ratisbon]] guaranteed France's new borders for twenty years, but Louis XIV's subsequent actions – notably his [[Edict of Fontainebleau|revocation of the Edict of Nantes]] in 1685 – led to the deterioration of his military and political dominance. Louis XIV's decision to cross the [[Rhine]] in September 1688 was designed to extend his influence and pressure the [[Holy Roman Empire]] into accepting his territorial and dynastic claims. But when Leopold I and the German princes resolved to resist, and when the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]] and William III brought the Dutch and the English into the war against France, the French King at last faced a powerful coalition aimed at curtailing his ambitions.

William III of England became the main allied leader.  Historian J.R. Jones states that King William was given:
:supreme command within the alliance throughout the Nine Years war.  His experience and knowledge of European affairs made him the indispensable director of Allied diplomatic and military strategy, and he derived additional authority from his enhanced status as king of England – even the Emperor Leopold...recognized his leadership.  William's English subjects played subordinate or even minor roles in diplomatic and military affairs, having a major share only in the direction of the war at sea.  Parliament and the nation had to provide money, men and ships, and William had found it expedient to explain his intentions...but this did not mean that Parliament or even ministers assisted in the formulation of policy.&lt;ref&gt;J.R. Jones, ''Britain and the World, 1649-1815'' (1980) p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

William's main strategy was to form a military alliance of England, the Netherlands, the Holy Roman Empire, Spain, and some smaller states, to attack France at sea, and from land in different directions, while defending the Netherlands.  Louis XIV tried to undermine this strategy by refusing to recognize William as king of England, and by giving diplomatic, military and financial support to a series of pretenders to the English throne, all based in France.  Williams focused most of his attention on foreign policy and foreign wars, spending a great deal of time in the Netherlands (where he continued to hold the dominant political office).  His closest foreign-policy advisers were Dutch, most notably [[William Bentinck, 1st Earl of Portland]]; they shared little information with their English counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;David Onnekink, "‘Mynheer Benting now rules over us’: the 1st Earl of Portland and the Re-emergence of the English Favourite, 1689–99." ''English Historical Review'' 121.492 (2006): 693-713. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3806356 online]&lt;/ref&gt;  The net result was that the Netherlands remained independent, and France never took control of the Spanish Netherlands. The wars were very expensive to both sides but inconclusive.  William died just as the continuation war, the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], (1702–1714), was beginning.

The main fighting took place around France's borders: in the [[Spanish Netherlands]]; the [[Rhineland]]; [[Duchy of Savoy]]; and [[Catalonia]]. The fighting generally favoured Louis XIV's armies, but by 1696 his country was in the grip of an economic crisis. The Maritime Powers (England and the Dutch Republic) were also financially exhausted, and when Savoy defected from the Alliance all parties were keen for a negotiated settlement. By the terms of the [[Treaty of Ryswick]] (1697) Louis XIV retained the whole of [[Alsace]], but he was forced to return [[Lorraine (duchy)|Lorraine]] to its ruler and give up any gains on the right bank of the Rhine. Louis XIV also accepted William III as the rightful King of England, while the Dutch acquired their Barrier fortress system in the Spanish Netherlands to help secure their own borders. However, with the ailing and childless [[Charles II of Spain]] approaching his end, a new conflict over the inheritance of the [[Spanish Empire]] would soon embroil Louis XIV and the Grand Alliance in a final war – the [[War of the Spanish Succession]].

=== Great Northern War: 1700–1721 ===
{{Main|Great Northern War|Swedish Empire|Military history of the Russian Empire}}
[[File:LocationSwedishEmpire.png|thumb|The Swedish Empire at its height in 1658]]
Sweden 1560–1660 had engaged in large-scale territorial expansion in the Baltic region, at the expense of Denmark and Poland.&lt;ref&gt;Henrik O. Lunde, ''A Warrior Dynasty: The Rise and Decline of Sweden as a Military Superpower'' (Casemate, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Baltic Sea map.png|thumb|left|Baltic Sea region in 21st century]]

In 1700, Denmark, Poland and Russia, the countries that had lost the most territory to Sweden, jointly declared war. Denmark was soon forced to peace after a joint intervention of Swedish, English and Dutch armies. King Charles XII took his Swedish army to the Baltic provinces, where Russian and Polish armies were laying siege to several towns. He defeated the Russian army in the [[Battle of Narva (1700)|Battle of Narva]]. Charles then moved into Poland with the intent of dethroning the Polish king [[Augustus II of Poland|Augustus II]]. This took several years, but in 1706, with the [[Treaty of Altranstädt (1706)|Treaty of Altranstädt]], he reached his goal.
[[File:Axel Sparre - Karl den XII, 1682-1718, kung av Sverige.jpg|thumb|[[Charles XII of Sweden]]]]
In the meantime, Russia had managed to take possession of several towns by the Baltic Sea. Instead of trying to retake these, Charles chose to march directly on Moscow, but due to extremely cold weather, failures in his supply lines and the Russian [[scorched earth]] strategy, he was forced to turn towards [[Ukraine]]. He had lost most of his soldiers and supplies but Charles, trusting in supposedly superior skills, faced the Russians in 1709.&lt;ref&gt;Ragnhild M. Hatton, "Charles XII and the Great Northern War." in J.S. Bromley, ed., ''New Cambridge Modern History VI: The Rise of Great Britain and Russia 1688–1725'' (1970) pp 648–80.&lt;/ref&gt; Russia under Tsar [[Peter the Great]] had recently modernized its military forces, and won a decisive victory at the [[Battle of Poltava]]. Charles managed to escape south to the [[Ottoman Empire]], which gave him refuge for six years. Following Poltava, Poland and Denmark re-entered the war, along with other countries wanting parts of the Swedish provinces. In the following years, most of them would fall, and Russia [[Greater Wrath|occupied the eastern half of Sweden]] (present-day Finland). Sweden lost control of the eastern Baltic and never recovered its former greatness. Instead Russia gained Finland and access to the Baltic Sea, gaining recognition as a European power.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Wilson, "Poltava: The battle that changed the world." ''History Today'' 59.3 (2009): 23+&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Nisbet Bain, ''Charles XII and the Collapse of the Swedish Empire, 1682–1719'' (1899) pp 56–190.

==== Russia ====
{{Main|Foreign policy of the Russian Empire|Military history of the Russian Empire}}
All the main decisions in the [[Russian Empire]] were made by the [[Tsar#Russia|tsar]] ([[tsarist autocracy]]), so there was a uniformity of policy and a forcefulness during the long regimes of powerful leaders such as [[Peter the Great]] and [[Catherine the Great]]. However, there were numerous weak tsars—such as children with a regent in control—as well as numerous plots and assassinations. With weak tsars or rapid turnover there was unpredictability and even chaos.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Riasanovsky and Mark Steinberg, ''A History of Russia'' (8th ed. 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Peter der-Grosse 1838.jpg|thumb|[[Peter the Great]] officially renamed the [[Tsardom of Russia]] the Russian Empire in 1721, and became its first emperor.]]

Geographical expansion by warfare and treaty was the central strategy of Russian foreign policy from the small [[Muscovy|Muscovite state]] of the 16th century to [[World War I]] in 1914. The goals were territory, warm water ports, and protection of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]]. The main weapon was the very large and increasingly well-trained [[Imperial Russian Army]], although the large domestic economy was poor and was hard-pressed to provide adequate support given the poor transportation system.&lt;ref&gt;William C. Fuller, Jr., ''Strategy and Power in Russia 1600–1914'' (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

To the northwest, Russia engaged in a century long struggle against Sweden for control of the [[Baltic Sea]]. Peter the Great systematically remodeled the Russian administrative and military system along Western lines, building up a large army in the process. The Russian Navy remains small and unimportant The Empire succeeded by the 1720s, obtaining not just access to the sea but ownership of Finland and the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. To the west, there were a series of wars with Poland and Lithuania, followed by negotiated settlements with Prussia and Austria that gave Russia control of most of Ukraine, and a large slice of Poland.

Napoleon at one point was willing to split Eastern Europe with Russia. In 1812 he unsuccessfully challenged the Russians directly with his [[French invasion of Russia|1812 invasion of Russia]]. The invasion was repelled with heavy losses, and Russia played a decisive role in defeating Napoleon, any new territory, and played a strong conservative voice in the affairs of Europe from 1814 to the 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;Walter G. Moss, ''A History of Russia. Vol. 1: To 1917'' (2d ed. 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The War of the Spanish Succession: 1702–1714 ===
{{Main|War of the Spanish Succession|Bourbon claim to the Spanish throne}}
Spain had a number of major assets, apart from its homeland itself. It controlled important territory in Europe, especially the Spanish Netherlands ( which eventually became Belgian) and the [[Franche-Comté]] province on France's eastern border, as well as a large portion of southern Italy and Sicily. Overseas it had a major empire that dominated much of the New World, including South America, Mexico, Central America, and some critical West Indies islands such as Cuba. Other possessions included the Philippine Islands. The overseas territories were an important outlet for migration by the Spanish population. Most important of all, Spain's colonies produced enormous quantities of silver, which were brought to Spain every few years in convoys. Spain had many weaknesses as well. Its home economy was poor, there was little business or industry, or advanced craftsmanship. It had to Import practically all its weapons. Spain had a large army but it was poorly trained and poorly equipped. It had a surprisingly small navy, for seamanship was a low priority among the Spanish elites. It never recovered from the self-inflicted disaster that destroyed half of the large [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588. Local and regional governments, and the local nobility, controlled most of the decision-making. The central government was quite weak, with a mediocre bureaucracy, and few able leaders. [[Charles II of Spain|King Charles II]] reigned 1665 to 1700, but he was in very poor physical and mental health.&lt;ref&gt;Cathal J. Nolan, ''Wars of the Age of Louis XIV, 1650–1715'' (2008) pp 71, 444–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

King Charles II had no children, and which of two rival would become king of Spain unleashed a major war. Charles II represented the Habsburg family, and that family, based in Vienna, had its candidate.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, ''The Emergence of the Great Powers: 1685–1715'' (1951), pp 59-91.&lt;/ref&gt; However the Bourbons, based in Paris, [[Bourbon claim to the Spanish throne|also had a candidate: the grandson of powerful King Louis XIV.]] Spain's silver, and its inability to protect its assets, made it a highly visible target for ambitious Europeans. For generations, Englishmen had contemplated capturing the treasure fleet—which happened only once—in 1628 by the Dutch. English mariners nevertheless seriously pursued the opportunities for plunder and trade in Spain's colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Shinsuke Satsuma |title=Britain and Colonial Maritime War in the Early Eighteenth Century: Silver, Seapower and the Atlantic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GKoTAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1|year=2013 |pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles II made a disastrous decision: in his will he bequeathed his throne to the Bourbon candidate, a Frenchman who became [[Philip V of Spain]]. France, of course, rallied to the choice. However a coalition of enemies quickly formed, and a major European war broke out 1701–1714.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Kamen, ''The War of Succession in Spain, 1700–15'' (1969).&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of France gaining enormous strength by taking over Spain and all its European and overseas possessions was anathema to France's main rivals. Secondly the prospect of dividing up Spanish holdings prove very attractive. France's enemies formed a Grand Alliance, led by [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|the Holy Roman Empire's Leopold I]]. It included Prussia and most of the other German states, The Netherlands, Portugal, Savoy (in Italy) and especially England. France took control of Spanish forces and added a few allies in Bavaria and among several local dukes in Italy and Germany. Extensive fighting took place primarily in the Netherlands, with both sides swaying back and forth. When Emperor Leopold died, he was succeeded by his oldest son Joseph. However, when Joseph died in 1711, [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|his brother Charles]] became not only the Alliance candidate for king of Spain, but he also became Emperor.&lt;ref&gt;James Falkner, ''The War of the Spanish Succession 1701–1714'' (2015) [https://www.amazon.com/War-Spanish-Succession-1701-1714/dp/1781590311/ excerpt]&lt;/ref&gt; That combination would make the Empire much too powerful, so the allies deserted the alliance, and peace was at hand. The [[Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713 resolved all of the issues. Philip V became king of Spain, and kept all his overseas colonies, but renounced any rights to the French throne. Spain lost its European holdings outside the homeland itself. As the former members of the alliance picked up their spoils. England gained Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and Gibraltar, as well as trading rights in the Spanish colonies. Spain now had a new Bourbon government, which proved far more effective and energetic than the previous Habsburg rulers.&lt;ref&gt;John Lynch, ''Bourbon Spain 1700–1808'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Europe: 1715–1789 ==
=== Peaceful interlude: 1715–1740 ===
{{Further|Ancien Régime}}
The quarter century after the Treaty of Utrecht was a peaceful, with no major wars, and only a few secondary military episodes of minor importance. For example, the  [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] Was a naval war between Britain and Spain regarding British smuggling into Spanish colonies. It started in 1739 was fought in the Caribbean. After a small British victory in 1741, the Spanish repelled a major English invasion, and the fighting petered out with no gain to either side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Spencer C. Tucker|title=A Global Chronology of Conflict: From the Ancient World to the Modern Middle East , vol 2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h5_tSnygvbIC&amp;pg=PA737|year=2009|page=737}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main powers had exhausted themselves in warfare, with many deaths, disabled veterans, ruined navies, high pension costs, heavy loans and high taxes. Utrecht strengthened the sense of useful international law and inaugurated an era of relative stability in the European state system, based on balance-of-power politics that no one country would become dominant.&lt;ref&gt;Dale Miquelon, "Envisioning the French Empire: Utrecht, 1711–1713." ''French Historical Studies'' 24.4 (2001): 653–677.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Walpole]], the key British policy maker, prioritized peace in Europe because it was good for his trading nation and its growing [[British Empire]]. British historian [[G. M. Trevelyan]] argues:
:That Treaty [of Utrecht], which ushered in the stable and characteristic period of Eighteenth-Century civilization, marked the end of danger to Europe from the old French monarchy, and it marked a change of no less significance to the world at large, — the maritime, commercial and financial supremacy of Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;G.M. Trevelyan, ''A Shortened History of England'' (1942) p 363.&lt;/ref&gt;
But "balance" needed armed enforcement. Britain played a key military role as "balancer." The goals were to bolster Europe's balance of power system to main peace that was needed for British trade to flourish and its colonies to grow, and finally to strengthen its own central position in the balance of power system in which no could dominate the rest.  Other nations recognized Britain as the "balancer."  Eventually the balancing act required Britain to contain French ambitions. Containment led to a series of increasingly large-scale wars between Britain and France, which ended with mixed results. Britain was usually aligned with the Netherlands and Prussia, and subsidised their armies. These wars enveloped all of Europe and the overseas colonies. These wars took place in every decade starting in the 1740s and climaxed in the defeat of Napoleon's France in 1814.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Sheehan, "Balance of power intervention: Britain's decisions for or against war, 1733–56." ''Diplomacy and Statecraft'' 7.2 (1996): 271–289. [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09592299608406004 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Louis XV ====
{{Further|Louis XV of France}}
In sharp contrast to the hyperactive Louis XIV, his successor was largely uninterested in the complex diplomacy and warfare during his long reign that officially started as a child in 1715; his active role began in 1722 and lasted to 1774. Louis XIV, with his eagerness for warfare, was gone, replaced by a small sickly child who was the last Bourbon survivor, and his death had the potential to throw France into another round of warfare. He was Louis XV and he lived until the 1770s. France’s main foreign policy decision-maker was [[Cardinal Fleury]]. He recognized that France needed to rebuild, so he pursued a peace policy. France had a poorly designed taxation system, whereby tax farmers kept much of the money, and the treasury was always short. The banking system in Paris was undeveloped, and the treasury was forced to borrow at very high interest rates.

====War of the Quadruple Alliance (1718–1720)====
One of the few military episodes in Western Europe was the [[War of the Quadruple Alliance]] (1718–1720). In Vienna, Austria (formally the Holy Roman Empire) the Habsburg emperors were bickering with the new Bourbon King of Spain, Philip V, over Habsburg control of most of Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Penfield Roberts, ''The Quest for Security: 1715–1740'' (1947), pp 1–20, 240–44.&lt;/ref&gt; Philip V, and especially his wife [[Elisabeth Farnese]] and his chief minister [[Giulio Alberoni]] had designs on recovering much of Italy that Spain had lost to the Habsburgs in 1714 and perhaps even put Philip on the French throne. Spanish fleets captured Sicily and Sardinia. The Quadruple Alliance of Britain, France, Austria, the Dutch Republic and (later) Savoy was a coalition formed to restore the balance of power and end Spanish threats. Naval victories by the Alliance proved decisive and Spain pulled back.&lt;ref&gt;Ogg, ''Europe of the Ancien Régime: 1715–1783 (1965), p 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Britain: the trading nation ===
{{Further|History of the foreign relations of the United Kingdom}}

The major powers were primarily motivated toward territorial gains, and protection of their dynasties (such as the Habsburg and Bourbon dynasties or the [[House of Hohenzollern]]) in Prussia). Britain had a different primary interest (besides defense of the homeland). Its national policy was building a worldwide trading network for its merchants, manufacturers, shippers and financiers. This required a hegemonic Royal Navy so that no rival could sweep its ships from the world's trading routes, nor invade the British Isles. The London government enhanced the private sector by incorporating numerous privately financed London-based companies for establishing trading posts and opening import-export businesses across the world. Each was given a monopoly of English trade to a specified geographical region. The first enterprise was the [[Muscovy Company]] set up in 1555 to trade with Russia. Other prominent enterprises included the [[East India Company]], and the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in Canada. The Company of Royal Adventurers Trading to Africa had been set up in 1662 to trade in gold, ivory and slaves in Africa; it was reestablished as the [[Royal African Company]] in 1672 and focused on the slave trade. British involvement in the each of the four major wars, 1740 to 1783, paid off handsomely in terms of trade. Even the loss of the 13 American colonies was made up by a very favorable trading relationship with the new United States of America. British gained dominance in the trade with India, and largely dominated the highly lucrative slave, sugar, and commercial trades originating in West Africa and the West Indies. China would be next on the agenda. Other powers set up similar monopolies on a much smaller scale; only the Netherlands emphasized trade as much as England.&lt;ref&gt;Eric J. Evans, ''The Forging of the Modern State: Early Industrial Britain, 1783–1872'' (1996) p 31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ann M. Carlos and Stephen Nicholas. "'Giants of an Earlier Capitalism': The Chartered Trading Companies as Modern Multinationals." ''Business History Review'' 62#3 (1988): 398–419. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3115542 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

London’s financial system proved strikingly competent in funding not only the English forces, but its allies as well.&lt;ref&gt;John Brewer, ''The sinews of power: War, money, and the English state, 1688–1783'' (1989) pp 167-78.&lt;/ref&gt; The Treasury raised £46,000,000 in loans to pay for the wars with France of 1689–97 and 1702–13; by 1714 the national debt stood at £40,000,000, with a sinking fund operating to retire the debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Miller|title=Seeds of liberty: 1688 and the shaping of modern Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bSUXAQAAIAAJ|year=1988|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Queen Anne was dead, and her successor King George I was a Hanoverian who moved his court to London, but never learned English and surrounded himself with German advisors. They spent much of their time and most of their attention on Hanoverian affairs. He too was threatened by instability of the throne, for the Stuart pretenders, long supported by King Louis XIV, threatened repeatedly to invade through Ireland or Scotland, and had significant internal support from the Tory faction. However Sir [[Robert Walpole]] was the dominant decision-maker, 1722–1740, although the role was not yet called prime minister. Walpole strongly rejected militaristic options, and promoted a peace program. He signed an alliance with France. The Netherlands was much reduced in power, and followed along with England.

=== Seven Years' War ===
{{Main|Seven Years' War}}
Louis XV is best known for losing badly in the worldwide Seven Years' War. In 1763 Louis ceded [[New France]] in North America to Spain and Great Britain after France's defeat in the war. He incorporated the territories of [[Lorraine (duchy)|Lorraine]] and [[Corsica]] into the kingdom of France. Most scholars argue that Louis XV's decisions damaged the power of France, weakened the treasury, discredited the absolute monarchy, and made it more vulnerable to distrust and destruction. Evidence for this view is provided by the [[French Revolution]], which broke out 15 years after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=J. H. Shennan|title=France Before the Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aTqQ9vCTMHAC&amp;pg=PA44|year=1995|publisher=Routledge|pages=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norman Davies characterized Louis XV's reign as "one of debilitating stagnation," characterized by lost wars, endless clashes between the Court and [[Parlement]], and religious feuds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Norman Davies|title=Europe: A History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jrVW9W9eiYMC&amp;pg=PA627|year=1996|publisher=Oxford U.P.|pages=627–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few scholars defend Louis, arguing that his highly negative reputation was based on later propaganda meant to justify the French Revolution. Jerome Blum described him as "a perpetual adolescent called to do a man's job."&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Blum et al. ''The European World: A History'' (3rd ed 1970) p 454&lt;/ref&gt;

=== American War for Independence===
{{main|American Revolution|American Revolutionary War|Diplomacy in the American Revolutionary War}}
After victory against France in the Seven Years War, The British government, at the time under the personal control of King George III, decided to reign in the rapidly growing American colonies, with 2.5 million population in contrast to Britain's 6 million. The new policy in 1765 of imposing new taxes, without seeking the consent of colonial parliaments, was highly controversial in Britain itself, and deeply unpopular in the 13 American colonies. The Americans claimed it violated their privileges as Englishmen.  For a dozen years different solutions were attempted, but London kept insisting on imposing taxes without consultation.   When American patriots in 1773 destroyed a shipment of taxed British tea in Boston Harbor in the [[Boston Tea Party]], London responded with severe punishment. The colonies rallied, and set up a [[Continental Congress]] to coordinate their actions.  Large scale boycotts proved highly damaging to British merchants who lost their American market overnight.  London sent in more troops to Boston, while the colonists organized and drilled their militia.  Fighting broke out in 1775, and the American Patriots seize control of all 13 colonies, expelling nearly all Royal officials. The king refused to compromise.  An American Army, organized by Congress and under the control of general [[George Washington]], forced the British out of Boston.  After securing unanimous support from the legislatures of all 13 states, Congress voted for independence on July 2. The [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], drafted largely by [[Thomas Jefferson]], was unanimously adopted by the Congress on July 4.&lt;ref&gt;Pauline Maier, ''American Scripture'' (1997) pp. 41–46&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian George Billias says:
:Independence amounted to a new status of interdependence: the United States was now a sovereign nation entitled to the privileges and responsibilities that came with that status. America thus became a member of the international community, which meant becoming a maker of treaties and alliances, a military ally in diplomacy, and a partner in foreign trade on a more equal basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=George Athan Billias|title=American Constitutionalism Heard Round the World, 1776-1989: A Global Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ku0TCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA17|year=2011|publisher=NYU Press|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Benjamin Franklin]], the chief American diplomat in Paris, proved highly popular with elite French opinion, including intellectuals and the Royal court.  France wanted revenge after its defeat in the 1760s, and again heavily funding the American revolt.  After the Americans captured a British invasion force at Saratoga, in upstate New York in 1777, the French officially declared war on Britain, recognize the independence of the new United States, and were joined officially by the Dutch (who recognized the United States) and the Spanish (who did not.) All of Europe was neutral, with the favoritism toward France and the United States.  Britain had no major allies, but it did manage to hire tens of thousands of mercenaries from small German principalities such as Hesse.  The Royal Navy was now outnumbered by the combined Allied navies, and The threat of an Allied Invasion of the British Isles made its military situation precarious.  The British had some success in sending a large invasion force into the southern United States, but combined French-American army captured another invasion army at Yorktown in 1781, as the French Navy drove off a British rescue fleet.  The United States was now effectively independent,  and the British policy was to offer very good terms so as to guarantee strong Anglo-American foreign trade as soon as the war ended.  The naval war was not over, however as the British made decisive gains against the French Navy, and protected Gibraltar against the Spanish threat.  The loss of the First British Empire was made up in the next half-century by building up this Second British Empire, based in India and Asia.  The long-term results were highly negative for France. It did achieve revenge, but its very heavy spending in the seven years war and the war of American Independence effectively bankrupted the French treasury, setting the stage for the French Revolution in 1789.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Flagg Bemis, ''A Diplomatic History Of The United States'' (1950) ch 2-4 [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.544118 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe: 1789-1815: French Revolution and Napoleon===
{{main article|French Revolutionary Wars}}
From 1793 to 1815 France was engaged almost continuously (with two short breaks) in wars with Britain and a changing coalition of other major powers. The many French successes led to the spread of the French revolutionary ideals into neighbouring countries, and indeed across much of Europe. However, the final defeat of Napoleon in 1814 (and 1815) brought a reaction that reversed some – but not all – of the revolutionary achievements in France and Europe. The Bourbons were restored to the throne, with the brother of executed King Louis XVI becoming [[Louis XVIII of France|King Louis XVIII]].&lt;ref&gt;Gunther E. Rothenberg, "The Origins, Causes, and Extension of the Wars of the French Revolution and Napoleon". ''Journal of Interdisciplinary History'' (1988).  18#4: 771–793. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/204824 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Valmy Battle painting.jpg|thumb|French victory over the Prussians at the [[Battle of Valmy]] on 20 September 1792]]
The politics of the period inevitably drove France towards war with Austria and its allies. The King, many of the Feuillants, and the Girondins specifically wanted to wage war. The King (and many Feuillants with him) expected war would increase his personal popularity; he also foresaw an opportunity to exploit any defeat: either result would make him stronger. The Girondins wanted to [[export the Revolution]] throughout Europe and, by extension, to defend the Revolution within France. The forces opposing war were much weaker. Barnave and his supporters among the Feuillants feared a war they thought France had little chance to win and which they feared might lead to greater radicalisation of the revolution. On the other end of the political spectrum [[Maximilien Robespierre#Opposition to war with Austria|Robespierre opposed a war on two grounds]], fearing that it would strengthen the monarchy and military at the expense of the revolution, and that it would incur the anger of ordinary people in Austria and elsewhere. The Austrian emperor [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]], brother of [[Marie Antoinette of Austria|Marie Antoinette]], may have wished to avoid war, but he died on 1 March 1792.&lt;ref&gt;Schama 2004, p. 505&lt;/ref&gt; France preemptively declared war on Austria (20 April 1792) and [[Prussia]] joined on the Austrian side a few weeks later. The invading Prussian army faced little resistance until checked at the [[Battle of Valmy]] (20 September 1792) and was forced to withdraw.&lt;ref&gt;T.C.W. Blanning, ''The French Revolutionary Wars 1787–1802'' (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bataille de Fleurus 1794.JPG|thumb|left|The [[French Revolutionary Army]] defeated the combined armies of Austrians, Dutch and British at Fleurus in June 1794]]
The new-born Republic followed up on this success with a series of victories in Belgium and the [[Rhineland]] in the fall of 1792. The French armies defeated the Austrians at the [[Battle of Jemappes]] on 6 November, and had soon taken over most of the Austrian Netherlands. This brought them into conflict with Britain and the [[Dutch Republic]], which wished to preserve the independence of the southern Netherlands from France. After the king's execution in January 1793, these powers, along with Spain and most other European states, joined the war against France. Almost immediately, French forces faced defeat on many fronts, and were driven out of their newly conquered territories in the spring of 1793. At the same time, the republican regime was forced to deal with rebellions against its authority in much of western and southern France. But the allies failed to take advantage of French disunity, and by the autumn of 1793 the republican regime had defeated most of the internal rebellions and halted the allied advance into France itself.

The stalemate was broken in the summer of 1794 with dramatic French victories. They defeated the allied army at the [[Battle of Fleurus (1794)|Battle of Fleurus]], leading to a full Allied withdrawal from the Austrian Netherlands. They followed up by a campaign which swept the allies to the east bank of the Rhine and left the French, by the beginning of 1795, conquering the Dutch Republic itself. The House of Orange was expelled and replaced by the [[Batavian Republic]], a French satellite state. These victories led to the collapse of the coalition against France. Prussia, having effectively abandoned the coalition in the fall of 1794, made peace with revolutionary France at [[Peace of Basel|Basel]] in April 1795, and soon thereafter Spain, too, made peace with France. Of the major powers, only Britain and Austria remained at war with France.&lt;ref&gt;Sylvia Neely, ''A Concise History of the French Revolution'' (2008) [https://archive.org/details/concisehistoryof00neel online]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Fire in Saint-Domingo 1791, German copper engraving.jpg|thumb|230px|Slave revolt in Saint Domingue]]

===Colonial uprisings===
Although the French Revolution had a dramatic impact in numerous areas of Europe, the French colonies felt a particular influence. As the [[Martinique|Martinican]] author [[Aimé Césaire]] put it, "there was in each French colony a specific revolution, that occurred on the occasion of the French Revolution, in tune with it."&lt;ref&gt;Marcel Dorginy, ''The Abolition of Slavery: From L.F. Sonthonax to Victor Schoelcher, 1793, 1794, 1848'' (Paris: UNESCO, 2003), 167–80.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Haitian Revolution]] (Saint Domingue) became a central example of slave uprisings in French colonies.

===Napoleonic wars===
{{Main||Napoleonic Wars}}
[[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] was one of the world's most  dominant soldiers and statesmen, leading France to great victories over numerous European enemies. Despite modest origins he made himself an Emperor and restructured much of European diplomacy, politics and law, until he was forced to abdicate in 1814. His 100-day comeback in 1815 failed at the [[Battle of Waterloo]], and he died in exile on a remote island, remembered as a great hero by many Frenchmen and as a great villain by British and other enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Englund, ''Napoleon: A Political Life'' (2003) [https://archive.org/details/napoleonpolitica00engl online]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Battle of Waterloo 1815.PNG|left|thumb|The [[Battle of Waterloo]], where Napoleon was finally defeated in 1815]]

Napoleon, despite his youth, was France's most successful general in the Revolutionary wars, having conquered large parts of Italy and forced the Austrians to sue for peace. In 1799 on [[18 Brumaire]] (9 November) he overthrew the feeble government, replacing it with the [[French Consulate|Consulate]], which he dominated. He gained popularity in France by restoring the Church, keeping taxes low, centralizing power in Paris, and winning glory on the battlefield. In 1804 he crowned himself [[First French Empire|Emperor]]. In 1805, Napoleon planned to invade Britain, but a renewed British alliance with Russia and Austria ([[Third Coalition]]), forced him to turn his attention towards the continent, while at the same time the French fleet was demolished by the British at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]], ending any plan to invade Britain. On 2 December 1805, Napoleon defeated a numerically superior Austro-Russian army at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]], forcing Austria's withdrawal from the coalition (see [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]]) and dissolving the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. In 1806, a [[Fourth Coalition]] was set up. On 14 October Napoleon defeated the Prussians at the [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt]], marched through Germany and defeated the Russians on 14 June 1807 at [[Battle of Friedland|Friedland]]. The [[Treaties of Tilsit]] divided Europe between France and Russia and created the [[Duchy of Warsaw]].

On 12 June 1812 Napoleon [[French invasion of Russia|invaded Russia]] with a [[Grande Armée]] of nearly 700,000 troops. After the measured victories at [[Battle of Smolensk (1812)|Smolensk]] and [[Battle of Borodino|Borodino]] Napoleon occupied Moscow, only to find it burned by the retreating Russian army. He was forced to withdraw. On the march back his army was harassed by [[Cossacks]], and suffered disease and starvation. Only 20,000 of his men survived the campaign. By 1813 the tide had begun to turn from Napoleon. Having been defeated by a [[Sixth Coalition|seven nation army]] at the [[Battle of Leipzig]] in October 1813, he was forced to abdicate after the [[Six Days' Campaign]] and the occupation of Paris. Under the Treaty of Fontainebleau he was exiled to the island of [[Elba]]. He returned to France on 1 March 1815 (see [[Hundred Days]]), raised an army, but was finally defeated by a British and Prussian force at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] on 18 June 1815 and the Bourbons returned to power.&lt;ref&gt;Robert B. Asprey, ''The rise and fall of Napoleon Bonaparte'' (2000) [https://archive.org/details/risefallofnapole00aspr online]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Impact of the French Revolution====
{{main article|Influence of the French Revolution}}
Roberts finds that the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars, from 1793 to 1815, caused 4&amp;nbsp;million deaths (of whom 1&amp;nbsp;million were civilians); 1.4&amp;nbsp;million were French deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Roberts, "Why Napoleon merits the title 'the Great,'" ''BBC History Magazine''  (1 November 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside France the Revolution had a major impact. Its ideas became widespread. Roberts argues that Napoleon was responsible for key ideas of the modern world, so that, "meritocracy, equality before the law, property rights, religious toleration, modern secular education, sound finances, and so on-were protected, consolidated, codified, and geographically extended by Napoleon during his 16 years of power."&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, "Why Napoleon merits the title 'the Great," ''BBC History Magazine''  (1 November 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the French armies in the 1790s and 1800s directly overthrew feudal remains in much of western Europe. They liberalised [[property law]]s, ended [[Manorialism|seigneurial dues]], abolished the [[guild]] of merchants and craftsmen to facilitate entrepreneurship, legalised of divorce, closed the [[Ghetto|Jewish ghettos]] and made Jews equal to everyone else. The [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]] ended as did the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The power of church courts and religious authority was sharply reduced and [[Equality before the law|equality under the law]] was proclaimed for all men.&lt;ref&gt;Robert R. Palmer and Joel Colton,  ''A History of the Modern World'' (New York: McGraw Hill, 1995), pp. 428–9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Felix Markham, ''Napoleon and the awakening of Europe'' (1969) [https://archive.org/details/napoleonawakenin00mark online]&lt;/ref&gt;

In foreign affairs, the French Army down to 1812 was quite successful. Roberts says that Napoleon fought 60 battles, losing only seven.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Roberts, "Why Napoleon merits the title 'the Great," ''BBC History Magazine''  (1 November 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;  France conquered Belgium and turned it into another province of France. It conquered the Netherlands, and made it a puppet state. It took control of the German areas on the left bank of the Rhine River and set up a puppet regime. It conquered Switzerland and most of Italy, setting up a series of puppet states. The result was glory for France, and an infusion of much needed money from the conquered lands, which also provided direct support to the French Army. However the enemies of France, led by Britain and funded by the inexhaustible British Treasury, formed a Second Coalition in 1799 (with Britain joined by Russia, the Ottoman Empire and Austria). It scored a series of victories that rolled back French successes, and trapped the French Army in Egypt. Napoleon himself slipped through the British blockade in October 1799, returning to Paris, where he overthrew the government and made himself the ruler.&lt;ref&gt;William Doyle, ''The Oxford History of the French Revolution'' (1989) pp 341–68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steven T. Ross, ''European Diplomatic History, 1789–1815: France Against Europe'' (1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

Napoleon conquered most of [[Italy]] in the name of the French Revolution in 1797–99. He consolidated old units and split up Austria's holdings. He set up a series of new republics, complete with new codes of law and abolition of old feudal privileges. Napoleon's [[Cisalpine Republic]] was centered on Milan; Genoa became a republic; the Roman Republic was formed as well as the small [[Ligurian Republic]] around Genoa. The [[Parthenopean Republic|Neapolitan Republic]] was formed around Naples, but it lasted only five months. He later formed the [[Kingdom of Italy]], with his brother as King. In addition, France turned the Netherlands into the [[Batavian Republic]], and Switzerland into the [[Helvetic Republic]]. All these new countries were satellites of France, and had to pay large subsidies to Paris, as well as provide military support for Napoleon's wars. Their political and administrative systems were modernized, the metric system introduced, and trade barriers reduced. Jewish ghettos were abolished. Belgium and Piedmont became integral parts of France.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Grab, ''Napoleon and the Transformation of Europe'' (2003) pp 62–65, 78–79, 88–96, 115–17, 154–59&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the new nations were abolished and returned to prewar owners in 1814. However, Artz emphasizes the benefits the Italians gained from the French Revolution:
:For nearly two decades the Italians had the excellent codes of law, a fair system of taxation, a better economic situation, and more religious and intellectual toleration than they had known for centuries.... Everywhere old physical, economic, and intellectual barriers had been thrown down and the Italians had begun to be aware of a common nationality.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick B. Artz, ''Reaction and Revolution: 1814–1832 '' (1934) pp 142–43&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise in [[History of Switzerland|Switzerland]] the long-term impact of the French Revolution has been assessed by Martin:
:It proclaimed the equality of citizens before the law, equality of languages, freedom of thought and faith; it created a Swiss citizenship, basis of our modern nationality, and the separation of powers, of which the old regime had no conception; it suppressed internal tariffs and other economic restraints; it unified weights and measures, reformed civil and penal law, authorized mixed marriages (between Catholics and Protestants), suppressed torture and improved justice; it developed education and public works.&lt;ref&gt;William Martin, ''Histoire de la Suisse'' (Paris, 1926), pp 187–88, quoted in Crane Brinson, ''A Decade of Revolution: 1789–1799'' (1934) p 235&lt;/ref&gt;

The greatest impact came of course in France itself. In addition to effects similar to those in Italy and Switzerland, France saw the introduction of the principle of legal equality, and the downgrading of the once powerful and rich Catholic Church to just a bureau controlled by the government. Power became centralized in Paris, with its strong bureaucracy and an army supplied by conscripting all young men. French politics were permanently polarized—new names were given, "left" and "right" for the supporters and opponents of the principles of the Revolution.

British historian Max Hastings says there is no question that as a military genius Napoleon ranks with Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar in greatness. However, in the political realm, historians debate whether Napoleon was "an enlightened despot who laid the foundations of modern Europe or, instead, a megalomaniac who wrought greater misery than any man before the coming of Hitler".&lt;ref&gt;Max Hastings,  "Everything Is Owed to Glory," [https://www.wsj.com/articles/book-review-napoleon-a-life-by-andrew-roberts-1414788232?tesla=y&amp;mod=WSJEUROPE_hpp_sections_ukintl&amp;mg=reno64-wsj&amp;url=https://www.wsj.com/article/SB12003192308051073864504580228211018002950.html?mod=WSJEUROPE_hpp_sections_ukintl ''Wall Street Journal '' 31 October 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ten Great Campaigns ===
{{Main|Ten Great Campaigns}}
The [[Qing dynasty|Manchu or Qing regime]] in Beijing used military force, diplomacy, and reliance on local leaders to extend its domain to western regions where the Han Chinese had not settled, but where Russian expansion was a threat. It launched [[Ten Great Campaigns]] in the mid–late 18th century. Three were launched to enlarge the area of Qing control in [[Central Asia]]: two against the [[Dzungar people|Dzungars]] (1755–1757) and one for the pacification of [[Xinjiang]] (1758–59). The other seven campaigns were more in the nature of police actions on frontiers already established: two wars to suppress rebels in [[Sichuan]], another to suppress rebels in Taiwan (1787–88), and four expeditions abroad against the Burmese (1765–69), the Vietnamese (1788–89), and two against the [[Gurkha]]s in Nepal. The most important and successful saw the final destruction of the [[Dzungar people]] in the 1755 [[Dzungar–Qing War|Pacification of Dzungaria]]. The two campaigns secured the northern and western boundaries of [[Xinjiang]]. It also led to the pacification of the Islamicised, Turkic-speaking southern half of Xinjiang immediately thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;F.W. Mote, ''Imperial China 900–1800'' (1999), pp 936–939&lt;/ref&gt; The Ten Great Campaigns demonstrated China's vitality on its western fringes, and in Mongolia, Tibet, and Turkestan. The main threat was that Russia would take control, but instead they were over Allied and stayed away. Treaties with Russia at Nerchinsk (1689) And 1727 demonstrated that diplomacy could effectively establish stable borders. The treaties allowed for a Russian Orthodox religious mission in Beijing, and a small Russian caravan trade. In Qinghai (Eastern Tibet) China after 1724 divided ethnic groups against each other and relied upon local leaders as a counterweight to the Tibetan religious leader the [[Dalai Lama]] and the Mongols.&lt;ref&gt;Peter C. Perdue, "Empire and nation in comparative perspective: Frontier administration in eighteenth-century China." ''Journal of Early Modern History'' 5.4 (2001): 282–304.&lt;/ref&gt; In Turkestan, they encountered a growing and expanding Muslim population. The solution was to appoint local Muslim chieftains, as governors, and allowing Islamic law to prevail. The Chinese did collect taxes on trade, and tried to keep order. The expansion to the west was the last major expansion of China.&lt;ref&gt;John King Fairbank, ''China: A New History'' (1992) pp 152–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

== India ==
=== The Mughal Empire ===
{{Main|Mughal Empire|Aurangzeb}}
[[File:Taj Mahal Exterior.jpg|thumb|The Taj Mahal near Delhi]]
The Mughal Empire (1526–1720) was founded by [[Babur]], (1483–1530) a Sunni Muslim based in Afghanistan. He used advanced weapons, artillery – and especially mobile cavalry, he captured Delhi in 1526 with only 12,000 soldiers against an enemy force of over 100,000. He continued his conquests across much of North Central India. His vigor and charismatic personality earned him strong loyalties. [[Akbar]] (ruled 1556–1605) followed. He was a charismatic and brilliant leader who organized a highly successful military, and set up a financial system to pay for his extravagances. The Mughal Empire maintained diplomatic relations with numerous local and international powers, including Uzbeks, the Safavid dynasty in Persia, the Ottoman Empire, the [[French East India Company]] and especially the English [[East India Company]]. It tolerated the establishment of trading forts along the coast by Europeans because they brought trade, and because the Europeans had far superior naval power.&lt;ref&gt;John F. Richards, ''The Mughal Empire'' (1995), pp 19, 110–112, 196–201, 239–241.&lt;/ref&gt;

The young new Empire had severe weaknesses. Extravagant spending drained the treasury and forced an extremely unpopular increase in taxes. The artistic achievement remains highly impressive in the 21st century: most notably, the [[Taj Mahal]] shrine, built in 1632–53 by tens of thousands of highly skilled artisans over two decades, using the most expensive materials, including jewels in the walls.&lt;ref&gt;William J. Duiker and Jackson J. Spielvogel, ''World History'' (2013) pp 464–473&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burton Stein, ''A History of India'' (1998), pp 164–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ruling regime did not value cohesion or loyalty to the lineage. Instead, fratricide was the standard in politics: it was son against father, brother against brother. To get the throne heirs murdered their brothers and executed all their retinue. Ugly rumors of betrayal were easy to believe, conspiracies multiplied, loyalties wavered, and competence became less important. By 1700 Europeans had begun to take control of regional trade routes, and started to take sides in internal political factionalism. Even at its height under Akbar, the Mughal Empire was not a centralized state, but a loosely knit collection of heterogeneous principalities. Akbar was a highly efficient military commander, and instead of paying his army salaries, he gave the victorious commanders the rights ("zamindars") to collect taxes locally. They therefore became locally powerful, and did not depend on central authority. A person who converted from Hinduism to Islam had much better political and economic opportunities. Akbar was highly tolerant of the Hindus, and reduced taxes. [[Aurangzeb]] (ruled 1658–1707) was deeply ascetic, and stopped the spending on magnificent palaces and shrines. He tried to curb numerous forms of corruption, and became especially unpopular when he tried to forbid gambling drinking and prostitution. He ended the policy of religious tolerance, and was seen as hostile by the Hindus. They were no longer allowed to build temples, and the [[Jizyah]] tax was reimposed on non-Moslems. Forced conversions to Islam were resumed, and non-Muslims were expelled from high office. Hindus began to revolt.&lt;ref&gt;Satish Chandra, "Jizyah and the State in India during the 17th Century." ''Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient/Journal de l'histoire economique et sociale de l'Orient'' (1969): 322–340.&lt;/ref&gt; Most important, he spent decades in a futile military campaign to capture the large Deccan region south of the already large empire that Akbar had built. It was very expensive in money and lives. It became harder and harder to get the tax money owed by increasingly alienated powerful zamindars whose ancestors had been given the tax-collecting role by Babur or Akbar generations ago. They no longer had close ties to the throne. The result of a weak central government was that local zamindars, land owners, tribal leaders, money-lenders and merchants were increasingly independent of the central government, and instead shifted their allegiance to the East India Company, which paid them cash subsidies. It all greatly weakened the Mughar army, and strengthened the opposition Maratha caste of Hindus who gloried in their militaristic skills and took control of large sectors by 1720. The hapless Mughal emperor became a powerless figurehead; his empire was abolished in 1857.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, ''The Mughal Empire'' (1995) pp 199–204, 282–297.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== East India Company ===
{{Main|East India Company|Company rule in India}}
The East India Company was a privately owned British commercial trading firm that exported British goods to India and adjacent areas, and imported Indian products such as tea, spices, textiles and (for the Chinese market), opium.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Lawson, ''The East India Company: A History'' (1993) [https://www.questia.com/library/1876665/the-east-india-company-a-history online]&lt;/ref&gt; It started with several small port facilities, called factories, and expanded to control most of the Indian subcontinent by the 1850s. It primarily used diplomacy and financial incentives, with occasional use of military force. By 1803, at the height of its rule in India, it had a private army of about 260,000—twice the size of the British army. The company eventually came to rule large areas of India with its private armies, exercising military power and assuming administrative functions. The officers were British; the soldiers were "[[Sepoys]]" (Indians). Parts of the Sepoys revolted in 1857—after heavy loss of life, the British prevailed. The British government abolished the East India Company and set up the [[British Raj]], which ruled most of India directly, and the rest indirectly through semi-autonomous princely states.&lt;ref&gt;Philip J. Stern "History and historiography of the English East India Company: Past, present, and future!." ''History Compass'' 7.4 (2009): 1146–1180.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Linas and Simona''' was a duo, which represented [[Lithuania]] in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004]]. With 26 points they placed 16th in the semifinal and could not participate in the final. However, they befriended [[Ruslana]], the winner of the Eurovision 2004, and together recorded ''Fight for Love and Freedom''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-1.fm/?albumai/show/0000163 Linas ir Simona "I Love U"], interview with Linas Adomaitis, M-1 Radio Station. Accessed 19 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; This song was released in album ''I Love U'' on 22 July 2005. In 2005 they were representatives of an anti-AIDS campaign in Lithuania.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.delfi.lt/news/daily/education/naujaji-dienos-centro-pasaka-sezona-prades-linas-simona-ir-hoksila.d?id=10807888 |title=Naująjį Dienos centro "Pasaka" sezoną pradės Linas, Simona ir Hokšila |date=2006-09-28| publisher=[[Delfi.lt]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple separated in late 2007 ending the duo. Their last work, live album ''Linas and Simona presents UAB MUSIC Live'' featuring [[Stasys Povilaitis]], [[Violeta Riaubiškytė]], was released in February 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.music.lt/?news;id.9448 |title=Pasirodė paskutinis Lino ir Simonos gyvas albumas |publisher=Music.lt |date=2008-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Linas Adomaitis''' was born on 10 April 1976 to a family of a professional violinist. He attended music school from early age and now holds a master's degree from the [[Lithuanian Academy of Music and Theater]]. Linas started his music career in 1995 with quartet called L+. The band played in [[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]] style. They released four albums before adjourning in 2000. Linas then started solo career.

'''Simona Jakubėnaitė''' (born in 1984) participated in about 15 large international music festivals before taking part in ''[[Fizz Superstar]]'' contest in 2002. The show was very similar to the [[American Idol]] and took place in the three [[Baltic states]]. Simona did not win the contest, but met Linas and started working together. For a while she was Linas' backing singer. After the separation from Linas, she went to study at the [[Berklee College of Music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pramogos.delfi.lt/people/simona-jakubenaite-pries-mokslus-jav-dar-dainuosiu-ir-kursiu-namus.d?id=17026624 |title=Simona Jakubėnaitė: prieš mokslus JAV dar dainuosiu ir kursiu namus |first= Viltė |last=Žukauskaitė |date=2008-05-14 |publisher=[[Delfi.lt]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter, Sue and Marc''' were a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] music group from [[Bern]]. The members were Peter Reber (born 1949, vocals / piano / guitar), Sue Schell (born 1950 in New York, vocals), and Marc Dietrich (born 1948, vocals / guitar). They represented Switzerland at the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]&lt;ref name="Barclay"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barclay|first=Simon|title=Eurovision Song Contest - The Complete &amp; Independent Guide 2010|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BfuBF7fOnyoC&amp;pg=PA178|accessdate=29 June 2011|publisher=Simon Barclay|isbn=978-1-4457-8415-1|pages=178–}}&lt;/ref&gt; four times (and in four different languages, French in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1971|ESC 1971]] with "[[Les illusions de nos vingt ans]]", English in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1976|1976]] with "[[Djambo, Djambo]]", German in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1979|1979]] with "[[Trödler und Co]]", Italian in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1981|1981]] with "[[Io senza te]]") and sold over 2 million records in Switzerland. They held concerts in many countries including Germany, Austria, and Japan. Their greatest hit was "Cindy" in 1976 (it was released in South Africa in 1978, where it became a hit, peaking at number 3 on the charts in November of that year). The song "Birds of paradise" became a hit in Slovakia in 2006. Initially the song was played at the funeral of [[2006 Slovak Air Force Antonov An-24 crash|42 military plane crash victims]]. Following that people flooded radio stations across the country with requests for this song.

During their career, Peter Sue and Marc made many other attempts to sing at Eurovision. They came third in the 1973 Swiss qualifier with "Es kommt ein Tag". In 1974 they again missed out on a place at the final, this time with the song "Frei". 1975 saw them finish in second place in the Swiss heat with "Lève-toi le soleil". In 1978 they took part in the German finals, and their entry, "Charlie Chaplin", was placed third. In 1987 Marc attempted to represent Switzerland with the song "Nostradamus", finishing second behind [[Carol Rich]].

"The Birds of Paradise" was covered by the Russian singer [[Dmitry Selivanov]] in 1987 and released in 1990.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3094">'''Radio Muhabura''' was a radio station of RPF ([[Rwandan Patriotic Front]]) during the [[Rwandan Civil War]] from 1990 to 1994. It was created in 1991 and broadcast from [[Uganda]]. It was the first alternative to [[Radio Rwanda]], reaching all but the south of Rwanda by mid-1992. It was recorded by the [[BBC]] starting in 1992. It promoted armed resistance to the "extremist" Rwandan government. In an October 1992 broadcast it claimed that militia forces of the government's party had "devised traps aimed at exterminating the youth." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.article19.org/pdfs/publications/rwanda-broadcasting-genocide.pdf|title=Broadcasting Genocide: Censorship, Propaganda and State-Sponsored Violence in Rwanda, 1990–1994.|year=1996|publisher=Article 19, London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as January 1993, months before the [[Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines|RTLM]] went on-air, Radio Muhabura accused the Rwandan government of genocide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ds.datastarweb.com/ds/products/datastar/sheets/bswb.htm|title=Radio Muhabura 0030, 30 Jan 1993|date=1993-01-30|publisher=BBC Summary of World Broadcasts, 2 Feb 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; It routinely denied RPF involvement in civilian killings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ds.datastarweb.com/ds/products/datastar/sheets/bswb.htm|title=Radio Muhabura 1715, 11 Feb 1993|date=1993-02-11|publisher=BBC Summary of World Broadcasts, 13 Feb 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; and promoted resistance to "[[Hutu]] power", to the [[Juvénal Habyarimana|Habyarimana]] government, and desertion by the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rwandainitiative.ca/symposium/transcript/panel1/questions.html|title=Hate Media in Rwanda &gt; Question Period|accessdate=2007-06-05|date=2004-03-13|publisher=Carleton University School of Journalism and Communication)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It regularly discussed the return of the Rwandan diaspora and the creation of a new government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idrc.org/en/ev-108188-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html|title=Echoes of violence: considerations on radio and genocide in Rwanda|accessdate=2007-06-05|date=March 2004|publisher=Journal of Genocide Research 6 (1))}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the pro-Hutu RTLM (which became an inciting instrument of the [[Rwandan Genocide]] of 1994) was extensively listened to, Radio Muhabura had a much smaller audience, probably because it broadcast in English instead of [[Kinyarwanda]], and its contribution to the Rwandan civil war is not as widely discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rwandainitiative.ca/symposium/transcript/panel1/questions.html|title=Hate Media in Rwanda &gt; Question Period|accessdate=2007-06-05|date=2004-03-13|publisher=Carleton University School of Journalism and Communication)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of Radio Muhabura was cited as a part of the defense in the trial of [[Ferdinand Nahimana]] in the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]].

== History and Layout ==
[[File:Ramu Cantonment 07.jpg|alt=|thumb|Ramu Cantonment]]
24th Infantry Battalion was stationed at Ramu but it lacked infrastructure. So, the government decided to upgrade it to a full-fledged cantonment.

=== Establishment of cantonment ===
Prime Minister [[Sheikh Hasina]] confirmed the approval for a new cantonment in Ramu on 19 April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dhakatribune.com/safety/2014/apr/19/ramu-see-new-cantonment|title=Ramu to see new cantonment {{!}} Dhaka Tribune|website=www.dhakatribune.com|access-date=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Army was allocated 1,800 acres of forest land in Ramu. Of those 1,180 acres in Rajarkul, 264.55 acres in Khuniyapalang, and 344.43 acres in Umakhali Mouza.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2014/04/28/army-allotted-forest-land-illegally|title=Army allotted forest land illegally|newspaper=bdnews24.com|access-date=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 March 2016, she inaugurated construction of a road titled "Bir Sarani", memorial "Ajeyo" commemorating the division, a multipurpose shade "Birangan" and a composite barrack named "Matamuhuri" built at Alikadom Cantonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.albd.org/index.php/en/updates/news/3557-remain-alert-to-protect-constitution-and-sovereignty-hpm-sheikh-hasina-to-bangladesh-army|title=Remain alert to protect Constitution and Sovereignty: HPM Sheikh Hasina to Bangladesh Army|access-date=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key installations ==
=== Bangladesh Army formations ===
The cantonment is home for 10th Infantry Division, two infantry brigade, one artillery brigade &amp; other various units of Bangladesh Army.&lt;ref name="observer"&gt;{{cite news |last=Iqbal |first=Farhad |date=16 October 2014 |title=Army Chief visits under-construction cantonment at Ramu |url=http://www.observerbd.com/2014/10/16/49065.php |newspaper=The Observer |location=Dhaka |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150712025915/http://www.observerbd.com/2014/10/16/49065.php |archivedate=12 July 2015 |accessdate=12 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flag-hoisting ceremony of the newly formed 10th Infantry Division was held at Ramu Cantonment on its inauguration.&lt;ref name="bdnews"&gt;{{cite news |date=1 March 2015 |title=Remain alert against terrorism and militancy: PM to army |url=http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2015/03/01/remain-alert-against-terrorism-and-militancy-pm-to-army |newspaper=[[Bdnews24.com]] |location=Dhaka |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710012824/http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2015/03/01/remain-alert-against-terrorism-and-militancy-pm-to-army |archivedate=10 July 2015 |accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
The land allocated to establish Ramu cantonment was done by bypassing law. Rajarkul Mouza and Khuniyapalang Mouza are reserved forests, while that of Umakhali Mouza was identified marked as reserved forest land based on gazette notifications on 25 May 1907; 12 July 1930 and 11 June 1935. To allocate the land to army they were stripped of the status by invoking specific laws.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Press conference held at the Reporters Unity auditorium by eight organisations which work with human rights, good governance and development criticised governments regarding this matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://en.prothom-alo.com/bangladesh/news/56263/Call-against-land-acquisition-for-army|title=Call against land acquisition for army installations|newspaper=Prothom Alo|access-date=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Turkish Cypriots]] first issued '''[[revenue stamps]]''' in 1962 as part of Cyprus; after 1983 of the UDI of [[Northern Cyprus]], the country has continued to issue the stamps to this day.

==Revenue==
Northern Cyprus first issued stamps in 1962 as part of the [[Republic of Cyprus]]. They had a monogram TCM (Türk Cemaat Meclisi - Turkish Cypriot State) and continued to be reprinted until 1976. There were surcharges on this issue in new currency in 1976 and 1978. A similar issue but with new currency and the monogram KTFD (Kıbrıs Türk Federe Devleti - Turkish Cyprus Federated State). With independence in 1983, a new issue with the monogram KKTC (Kuzey Kıbrıs Türk Cumhuriyeti - Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus) was issued. This design was reissued with a number of differences since then.&lt;ref name="barefoot"/&gt;

==Izin Fonu (Holiday and sickness benefits)==
The first Izin Fonu stamps of Northern Cyprus were issued around 1970. They were inscribed KIBRIS TURK YONETIMI. In 1972, stamps were overprinted with the appropriate inscription, and later that year another issue, inscribed K.T.F.D., was issued. This was followed by another issue in around 2000 which was inscribed K.K.T.C.&lt;ref name="barefoot"/&gt;

==Yardim Pulu (Social Insurance)==
The first Yardim Pulu stamps were issued in April 1970 and had no value due to inflation. A second issue followed in 2001 with a map of Cyprus and a [[star and crescent]].&lt;ref name="barefoot"/&gt;

==Forestry Fund==
Forestry fund stamps were used to pay a fund to aid afforestation. It was a compulsory tax from 1995 to 1996, and voluntary after that. Only two were issued, with the face values of 1000 and 50000 lira.&lt;ref name="barefoot"/&gt;

[[File:SatelliteDishes-5375.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. residential satellite TV receiver dishes]]
Currently, there are two primary '''[[satellite television]]''' providers of subscription based service available to '''[[United States]]''' consumers: [[DirecTV]] and [[Dish Network]], which have 21 and 14 million subscribers respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[https://variety.com/2017/biz/news/att-q2-2017-earnings-directv-time-warner-1202506255/ AT&amp;T Loses Record Number of Traditional TV Subscribers in Q2, Drops 156,000 DirecTV Satellite Customers] - Todd Spanger, Variety, 25 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/295682/dish-posts-gains-in-total-pay-tv-subs-net-income.html Dish Posts Gains In Total Pay TV Subs, Net Income] - Wayne Friedman, MediaPost, 22 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Over the past three decades, various U.S. satellite services have come and gone or combined to form the current primary services. In 1975 [[RCA]] created [[Satcom 1]], the first satellite built especially for use by the then three national television networks ([[CBS]], [[NBC]], and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]). Later that same year, [[HBO]] leased a transponder on Satcom 1 and began transmission of television programs via satellite to cable systems. Owners of cable systems paid $10,000 to install 3-meter dishes to receive TV signals in [[C band (IEEE)|C band]].
In 1976 [[Taylor Howard]] built an amateur system, which consisted of a converted military surplus radar dish and a satellite receiver designed and built by Howard, for home satellite reception. Taylor's system could be used for receiving TV programs both from American and Soviet [[communication satellite]]s. In 1977 [[Pat Robertson]] launched the first satellite-delivered basic cable service called the [[CBN Cable Network]]. In 1979, the Satellite Home Viewers Act allowed homeowners in the US to own and operate their own home satellite system, consisting of C-band equipment from a multitude of manufacturers who were making parts for systems such as Taylor Howard's, and began a large controversy of which channels could be received by whom.

[[United States Satellite Broadcasting|USSB]] was a direct-to-home service founded in 1981. In the early 1990s they partnered with [[Hughes Electronics|Hughes]] and continued operation until purchased in 1998 by DirecTV.

In 1991 [[Primestar]] launched as the first North American DBS service. Hughes’s DirecTV, the first national high-powered upper K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;-band DBS system, went online in 1994. The DirecTV system became the new delivery vehicle for USSB. In 1996, [[EchoStar Communications Corporation|EchoStar]]’s Dish Network went online in the United States and has gone on to similar success as DirecTV’s primary competitor. The [[AlphaStar]] service launched in 1996 and went into bankruptcy in 1997. Primestar sold its assets to Hughes in 1999. Dominion Video Satellite Inc's [[Sky Angel]] also went online in the United States in 1996 with its DBS service geared towards "faith and family" until they sold the license to [[EchoStar Communications Corporation]] in 2008 and switched to an IPTV platform.

In 2004, [[Cablevision]]’s [[Voom]] service went online, specifically catering to the emerging market of [[high-definition television|HDTV]] owners and aficionados, but folded in April 2005. The service’s “exclusive” high-definition channels were migrated to the [[Dish Network]] system. Commercial DBS services are the primary competition to cable television service, although the two types of service have significantly different regulatory requirements (for example, cable television has [[Public access television|public access]] requirements, and the two types of distribution have different regulations regarding carriage of local stations).

[[Image:Antenne-toroidale.jpg|right|thumb|160px|90cm multiple-LNA toroidal satellite dish]]

The majority of [[ethnic-language]] broadcasts in North America are carried on K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band free-to-air. The largest concentration of free-to-air programming is on [[Galaxy 19]] at 97° W. [[Pittsburgh International Telecommunications]] and [[GlobeCast World TV]] offers a mix of free and pay-TV ethnic channels in the internationally-standard DVB-S and S2 formats, as do others. [[Home2US|Home2US Communications Inc.]] also offers several ethnic channels on SES 1 at 101° W, as well as other free and pay-TV channels. Many religious broadcasters reach the [[Direct To Home|DTH]] and distribution markets with unencrypted DVB-S television and radio channels on Galaxy 19. These channels are available as part of the [[Glorystar]] Satellite Service. Several U.S.-English language network affiliates (representing CBS, NBC, ABC, [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]], [[The CW Television Network|the CW]] (formerly [[The WB Television Network|the WB]] and [[UPN]]), [[ION Television|ION Network]] and [[MyNetworkTV]]) are available as free-to-air broadcasts, as are the three U.S.-Spanish language networks ([[Univisión]], [[Unimás]] and [[Telemundo]]). The number of free-to-air specialty channels is otherwise rather limited. Specific FTA offerings tend to appear and disappear rather often and typically with little or no notice, although sites such as LyngSat do track the changing availability of both free and pay channels worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lyngsat.com/ LyngSat tracking]&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 7, 2009, [[National Association of Broadcasters|NAB]] TV Board chair [[Paul Karpowicz]] planned to testify before the [[United States Senate|Senate]] [[United States Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Communications, Technology, and the Internet|Communications Subcommittee]] that broadcasters would be willing to allow subscribers of distant signals to continue to do so even if the [[DTV transition in the United States|digital transition]] resulted in those subscribers receiving stations that they could not before. The NAB did oppose offering new distant signals if a digital signal was available. The [[Satellite TV Modernization Act]] had to be passed by the end of 2009.

If the Senate approves, the House will have to approve the bill, and if the two versions cannot be reconciled, the license to import signals that expires at the end of the year could be extended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/382942-Leahy_Looks_for_Short_Time_Agreement_on_Satellite_Reauthorization.php?rssid=20068&amp;q=digital+tv|title=Leahy Looks for 'Short-Time' Agreement on Satellite Reauthorization|first=John|last=Eggerton|work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|date=2009-11-05|accessdate=2009-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The House version included an agreement with [[Echostar]] that, where possible, all 210 markets could receive signals, and Echostar could once again deliver distant signals.

The [[United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation|Senate Commerce Committee]] approved a version of the bill on November 19, without an amendment requiring local signals in all markets in three years, though a study would be conducted on why 30 markets still had a problem. Before Senate approval, the two versions of the bill will have to be reconciled; the Judiciary Committee had a short market fix, while the Commerce committee bill required [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] in [[High-definition television|HD]] sooner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/389824-Senate_Passes_Satellite_Reauthorization_Bill.php?rssid=20068&amp;q=digital+tv|title=Senate Passes Satellite Reauthorization Bill|first=John|last=Eggerton|work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|date=2009-11-19|accessdate=2009-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The House approved the [[Satellite Home Viewer Reauthorization Act]] December 3. It included both the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|House Commerce Committee]] and [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|House Judiciary Committee]] versions and renewed the ability to use distant signals for five years, allowed Dish Network to offer distant signals again, and required 28 markets to receive signals not available locally. The bill also dealt with some [[copyright]] issues and required Dish Network to offer HD noncommercial signals by 2011 instead of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/417629-SHVRA_Passes_Convincingly_in_House.php?rssid=20065&amp;q=digital+tv|title=SHVRA Passes Convincingly in House|first=John|last=Eggerton|work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|date=2009-12-03|accessdate=2009-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One potential problem: determining who cannot receive a signal is still based on analog rather than digital TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/440498-Satellite_Bill_Extension_Said_To_Be_On_Table_In_House.php?rssid=20103&amp;q=digital+tv|title=Satellite Bill Extension Said To Be On Table In House|first=John|last=Eggerton|work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|date=2009-12-15|accessdate=2009-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 11, 2010, Senate Majority Leader [[Harry Reid]] said the satellite reauthorization was part of a jobs bill. [[Rick Boucher]], House chairman for [[United States House Energy Subcommittee on Communications, Technology and the Internet|communications and the Internet]], believed the bill would pass.

==C band channels==
{{Expand list|date=July 2012}}
These are a list of the TV Channels that are on C-band satellites that are receivable in North America today. Most Cable TV [[Cable television headend|headends]] today use other bands (i.e., [[Ku-band]]) in addition to C-band. C-band (from the mid-1970s to the late-1990s/early-2000s) was the band the vast majority of cable operators used to receive television channels from. (Ku-band TV satellites were becoming more common around the mid-/late-1980s, very few channels were on them at the time of its launch).

The '''Soviet Antarctic Expedition''' ('''SAE''' or '''SovAE''') ({{lang-ru|Советская антарктическая экспедиция, САЭ}}, ''Sovyetskaya antarkticheskaya ekspeditziya'') was part of the [[Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute]] of the [[Soviet Committee on Antarctic Research]] of the [[Academy of Sciences of the USSR]].

The [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Ministry of Sea Transport]] was responsible for the administration, logistics and supply of the expeditions.

The first Soviet contact with [[Antarctica]] was in January 1947 when the Slava [[whaling]] flotilla began whaling in [[Southern Ocean|Antarctic waters]].
