==Background==
Acne Studios was founded in 1996 in Stockholm, Sweden as part of the creative collective ACNE that focused on [[graphic design]], film, production and [[advertising]].&lt;ref name="WSJ"/&gt; In 1997, cofounder [[Jonny Johansson]] created 100 pairs of raw [[denim]] jeans with red stitching and gave them away to friends and family. ''[[Wallpaper (magazine)|Wallpaper*]]'' and ''[[Vogue Paris]]'' quickly picked up on the popularity of the jeans and Acne Studios rapidly expanded their fashion offering outside of denim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2013/jun/25/acne-10-things-fashion-brand |title=Acne: 10 things you should know about the hot fashion brand |first=Lauren |last=Cochrane |date=25 June 2013 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Acne Studios became a standalone company and separated from other entities within the collective ACNE such as Acne Film, Acne Advertising and Acne Digital, at the same time launching their [[e-commerce]]. Since launching, Acne Studios has grown into a global fashion house with retail stores around the world including [[Paris]], [[London]], [[New York City|New York]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Antwerp]] and [[Tokyo]], offering women's and men's ready-to-wear collections, showing at [[Paris Fashion Week]] twice a year and turning over $215 million annually in 2016.&lt;ref name="BoF" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/fashion/alltherage/la-ar-acne-studios-opens-5000-square-foot-store-in-downtown-la-20131218-story.html |title=Acne Studios opens 5,000-square-foot store in downtown L.A. |first=Booth |last=Moore |date=18 December 2013 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Products ==
Acne Studios design men's and women's [[ready-to-wear]] fashion, footwear, denim, and accessories including handbags, small leather goods, and eyewear.

== Acne Studios Blå Konst ==
On April 6, 2017, Acne Studios relaunched its denim collection under the name Acne Studios Blå Konst (meaning "Blue Art" in Swedish) at all of their retail locations and on Acnestudios.com.&lt;ref name="BoF"/&gt; This launch consists of men's and women's ready-to-wear, jeans, and accessories. In addition, an Acne Studios Blå Konst pop-up shop located in Tokyo's Shibuya district was opened to showcase the launch, which it houses exclusively. Six new denim styles including the North, River, and Land for men and the Climb, South, and Log for women have replaced the range of existing denim products. While these jean styles are permanent, the Blå Konst ready-to-wear collection will be updated seasonally.&lt;ref name="BoF"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/bof-exclusive/acne-reboots-denim-strategy |title=Acne Reboots Denim Strategy |first=Daniel |last=Björk |date=20 March 2017 |website=[[The Business of Fashion]] |accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Acne Studios face motif collection ==
On August 17, 2017, Acne Studios launched its face motif collection&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |url=http://www.esquire.com/style/mens-fashion/news/a57081/acne-face-motif-collection-campaign/ |title=Acne Studios Just Launched One of the Coolest Campaigns We've Seen in a While |first=Jonathan |last=Evans |date=17 August 2017 |magazine=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]] |access-date=27 September 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, featuring patches of an emoticon face with two small circles and a long rectangle.

==''Acne Paper''==
Acne Studios avoids traditional forms of [[marketing]] and advertising, choosing instead to publish a biannual magazine called ''[[Acne Paper]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/82754772-fbe0-11de-9c29-00144feab49a.html#axzz1VHadqqf0 |title=The boom in branded magazines |first=Lucie |last=Greene |date=8 January 2010 |newspaper=[[Financial Times]] |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/features/paper-dreams-the-latest-issue-of-acnes-magazine-2329538.html |title=Paper dreams: The latest issue of Acne's magazine |first=Susannah |last=Frankel |date=31 July 2011 |newspaper=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Acne Paper'' covers the disciplines of art, fashion, photography, design, architecture, academia, and culture. Each issue is based around a theme that is interpreted by selected contributors from their field of expertise. Contributors to ''Acne Paper'' have included [[Carine Roitfeld]], [[Noam Chomsky]], [[David Lynch]], [[Lord Snowdon]], [[Azzedine Alaïa]], [[Mario Testino]], [[Sarah Moon]], [[Tilda Swinton]] and [[Paolo Roversi]]. The fifteenth and final issue was published in 2014; Acne Paper has since been discontinued.

==Stores==
Acne Studios has retail locations around the world including [[Stockholm]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Berlin]], [[New York City|New York]], [[San Francisco]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Milan]], [[Melbourne]], [[Sydney]], [[Antwerp]], [[London]], [[Paris]], [[Oslo]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Tokyo]], [[Seoul]], [[Beijing]], and [[Shanghai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acnestudios.com/stores/ |title=Find a store |website=AcneStudios.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Acne Studios' Stockholm flagship store on [[Norrmalmstorg]] was the location of the 1973 bank robbery and subsequent hostage situation that gave rise to the term [[Stockholm Syndrome]] for the psychological phenomenon in which hostages express empathy and sympathy toward their captors.&lt;ref name="NYT2009"/&gt; Acne Studios' first location in Italy, Piazza del Carmine, opened in June 2017. Acne Studios San Francisco opened in July, marking its second location in California.

The series was photographed in three parts, and each was presented globally- from posters plastered on the walls during [[Paris Fashion Week]] and Hong Kong's [[Golden Week (China)|Golden week]], on streetcars in Milan, and to digital images at London's Harrods. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |url=http://wwd.com/business-news/media/acne-studios-david-sims-fall-ad-campaign-jonny-johansson-10519987/ |title=Acne Studios Taps David Sims for Fall Campaign |last=Socha |first=Miles |date=2 September 2016 |magazine=[[Women's Wear Daily|WWD]] |access-date=11 July 2017 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Spring/Summer 2017 campaign, [[Paolo Roversi]] shot a portrait series featuring creatives around the world, such as [[Golshifteh Farahani]], [[Fatima Al Qadiri]], and [[Hayv Kahraman]]. The photography series was exhibited outdoors in New York, Paris, Milan, and Hong Kong. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |url=http://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/acne-studios-spring-campaign-10775768/ |title=Acne Studios Unveils Spring Campaign |last=Garced |first=Kristi |date=2 February 2017 |magazine=WWD |access-date=11 July 2017 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ammanai''' ({{lang-ta|அம்மானை}}) is a type of [[Tamil language|Tamil]] [[poetry]] belonging to the family of "[[Tharavu kochchaga kalippa]]". This is a type of poetry associated with a game of the same name that was popular with teen girls. Ammanai will be in the form of questions and answers. Ammanai generally follows the rules of a [[venpa]], but can occasionally have [[kalithalai]]s and belongs to the [[kalippa]] family.

The earliest ammanai poetry was composed by Saint [[Manikkavasagar]].  There is an ammanai which is said to be sung by the poets [[Ottakuththar]] and [[Pugalzendhi]]. During later times, it became something like a historical ballad.  [[Ramappaiyan Ammanai]] was composed to extol the wars fought by [[Dalavay Ramappaiyan]] who was the general of [[Tirumalai Nayakkar]] of [[Madurai]].

The [[Sivagangai Seemai Kummi]]/Ammanai relates the final wars of the valiant [[Marudhu Brothers]] of [[Sivagangai]].

The [[Palm-leaf manuscript]]'s on [[Ariviyur Nagarathar]] Ammanai was also found in [[Sivagangai]] district which explains the history of the [[Nagarathar]] community.

The '''Antiphonary tonary missal of St. Benigne''' (also called '''Antiphonarium Codex Montpellier''' or '''Tonary of Saint-Bénigne of Dijon''') was supposed to be written in the last years of the 10th century, when the Abbot [[William of Volpiano]] at St. [[Benignus of Dijon]] reformed the liturgy of several monasteries in Burgundy. The chant manuscript records mainly Western plainchant of the Roman-Frankish [[proper (liturgy)|proper mass]] and part of the chant sung during the [[matins]] ("[[Gregorian chant]]"), but unlike the common form of the [[Roman Gradual|Gradual]] and of the [[Antiphonary]], William organized his manuscript according to the chant genre ([[antiphon]]s with psalmody, [[alleluia]] verses, [[gradual]]s, [[offertory|offertories]], and [[trope (music)|proses]] for the missal part), and these sections were subdivided into eight parts according to the [[Hagiopolitan Octoechos#Tonary|octoechos]]. This disposition followed the order of a [[tonary]], but William of Volpiano wrote not only the incipits of the classified chant, he wrote the complete chant text with the music in central French [[neume]]s which were still written in ''campo aperto'', and added a second alphabetic notation of his own invention for the melodic structure of the codified chant.

== Historical background ==

This particular type of a fully notated [[tonary]] only appeared in Burgundy and Normandy. It can be regarded as a characteristic document of a certain school founded by [[William of Volpiano]], who was reforming abbot at St. [[Benignus of Dijon]] since 989. In 1001 he followed a request by [[Richard II, Duke of Normandy|Duke Richard II]] and became first abbot at the [[Abbey of Fécamp]] which was a reforming centre of monasticism in Normandy.

Only this manuscript was written during the time of William by the same hand as several other manuscripts of the Library of the Medical Faculty of Montpellier (today "Bibliothèque interuniversitaire de Médecin") which all belong to St. Bénigne. It is not known, whether it was really written by William of Volpiano in person. The few things known about him can be read in a hagiographic source, the ''Vita domni Willelmi'' in fourteen chapters written by his disciple, the Burgundian monk Raoul Glaber in 1031, and revised probably by demand of the later Abbot John of Fécamp during the late 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;See the edition of Véronique Gazeau and Monique Goullet ([[#Gaz08|2008]]).&lt;/ref&gt; William was born as son of the Alemannic Duke Robert of Volpiano at the citadel of his family on the island S. Giulio of the Lake Orta in Piedmont. The legend said that [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto]] had conquered this island, while William was born, so the Emperor became his patron and he was educated as a monk and made his clerical career at [[Cluny Abbey]] during the reform of [[Majolus of Cluny|Abbot Majolus]] who continued the [[Cluniac reforms|reform]] of his predecessor [[Odo of Cluny|Odo]] and supported reforms connected with papal politics under influence of the Ottonic Emperors. Concerning liturgical reforms, Emperor [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] already emphasized the need for a reform of monasticism in Southern Italy and to abandon local liturgies in favour of the Roman rite, a kind of second Carolingian reform, and he already wished to "liberate" Arab Sicily and to organize church provinces of the island which was mainly populated by Muslims and by a Greek Christians. His plan failed after the catastrophic defeat of his son [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto II]] near [[Reggio Calabria|Reggio]], but the role of [[Cluny Abbey|Cluny]] as a centre for liturgical reforms had increased in Ottonic times.

William's reforms were not only concerned with liturgy and the new design of local chant books, but also with the construction of new churches and buildings for abandoned abbeys, with canon law, with the organization of grammar schools and even rural communities of Normandy. It was typical for a career at [[Cluny Abbey]] to get one of the most prestigious positions as a cantor and to continue as a reforming abbot in another Abbey, which was subjected to this powerful and ambitious Abbey. As Abbot of St. Benignus William reformed several monasteries of Burgundy, Lorraine and the [[Île-de-France]]. There are some testimonies like the ''Libellus de revelatione, edificatione et auctoritate Fiscannensis monasterii'', a chronicle of Fécamp, which reports certain ressentments against Norman culture and its local liturgical customs.&lt;ref&gt;Gazeau ([[#Gaz02|2002, 44]]).&lt;/ref&gt; William appeared as a [[Cluniac reform]]er, but studies of his liturgical reform especially of the Office chant for Fécamp did not confirm, that he just removed local in favour of Cluniac customs.&lt;ref&gt;See the dissertation of Olivier Diard ([[#Dia00|2000]]) which proves that he "corrected" chants as Raoul Glaber called it, and he also added own compositions which can only found in the two manuscripts, and he respected certain customs of the local school.&lt;/ref&gt; Within the reform and the history of Norman monasticism, the reform of William of Volpiano was neither the beginning nor its climax, as a reformer he had to find a balance between local needs and problems and certain interests of the Cluniac Abbot, of the Pope, and of the Norman patrons, whose founding activities cultivated a new form of policy. William contributed to this history with the foundation of an own school.

According to Véronique Gazeau he did not spend too much time in Normandy during the period about 30 years of his Norman activities, but nevertheless his school could be established, because he ordained his students as abbots.&lt;ref&gt;Gazeau ([[#Gaz02|2002, 39f]]).&lt;/ref&gt; He was not only Abbot at Fécamp, but also at Jumièges between 1015 and 1017. He became first Abbot of Bernay, a foundation of [[Judith of Brittany|Countess Judith]], [[Richard II, Duke of Normandy|Richard II]]'s wife, in 1025. By order of Duke Robert he left Fécamp for John of Ravenna in 1028, before 1027 he was assisted at the Abbey at Bernay by a ''custos'' Thierry, an elder and experienced monk and prior from Saint-Bénigne of Dijon. Before he followed Suppo as prior at Mont-Saint-Michel in 1023. These administrative changes were caused by the establishment of monastic centres during certain periods, in which some Abbeys were no longer guided by an abbot, but by a prior of the community who was often called "custos", and several new foundations did not always start as an Abbey, they were subordinated to older abbeys. These monastic centres which had the control over various monasteries including former abbeys, were used to control new foundations as well as to obey liturgical and administrative reforms. This practice was continued after William's death, [[Abbey of Fécamp|Fécamp]] and [[Benignus of Dijon|Saint-Bénigne]] were controlled by one abbot between 1052 and 1054: Abbot John of Ravenna. When the new founded monasteries became abbeys, the abbots were usually chosen among the monks of Fécamp.

Only few writings by William have survived in the Abbey of Fécamp, but it is not always easy to decide, if the collection of Montpellier which belonged obviously to the library of the Abbey St. Benignus of Dijon, had this Abbey as destination. Michel Huglo remarked that the last part of the manuscript H.159, the real Antiphonary with antiphons and responsories for the [[Matins]], was continued by the 13th-century copy of the Antiphonary of the Abbey of Fécamp (Rouen, Bibliothèque municipale, Ms. 254, olim A.190).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  So the destination of the Tonary of Saint-Bénigne is still a matter of discussion. On the other hand, customs of St. Bénigne like the liturgy for the patron can also be found in other Abbeys as Fécamp and Bernay, and the tonaries of Dijon (Montpellier, Ms. H159), of Fécamp (Rouen, Ms. 244, olim A.261), and of Jumièges (Rouen, Ms. 248, olim A.339) are so consistent that they can be regarded as documents of one school which can be ascribed to William of Volpiano.

== The alphabetic notation invented by William of Volpiano ==

One of William's innovations as a cantor and notator was an alphabetic pitch notation. Its point of reference was the Boethian diagramm, which displayed the double octave of the ''[[Tone system#Syst.C3.AAma Ametabolon.2C an overview of the tone system|systema teleion]]'' in the [[Diatonic genus|diatonic]] (semitonium-tonus-tonus), the [[Chromatic genus|chromatic]] (semitonium-semitonium-trihemitonium), and the [[Enharmonic genus|enharmonic]] [[tetrachord]] (diesis-diesis-ditonus). The different positions were represented by alphabetical letters, except the dieses which had special signs not unlike the tyronic letters used by [[Boethius]]:

[[File:William of Volpiano's alphabetic notation.jpg|center|650px|thumb|alt=Introduction into William of Volpiano's aplphabetic notation|Alphabetic notation invented by [[William of Volpiano]]: the letters referred to the Boethian diagramme]]

This alphabetic pitch notation does not only offer insights into microtonal shifts used by the cantors of this local school, it also proves that the common projection of the piano keyboard on the medieval tone system is inadequate. Like many other letter systems used since the 8th century, also the system of William of Volpiano represented the positions of the Boethian diagramm, and the enharmonic signs used for the dieses represented not a change into another genus, but microtonal attractions within the diatonic melos of a certain mode.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Phillips ([[#Phi00|2000]]) offers an overview.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning the diesis [[Guido of Arezzo]] wrote about 1026 in his treatise ''[[Micrologus]]'' that the diesis sharpens the usual tonus between re-mi (a-b; d-e; g-h or h-i) with the proportion 9:8 by a proportion of 7:6 (a-˫; d-˧; g-Γ or h-˥).&lt;ref&gt;See: {{Citation

}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Guido's explanation, how to find this intervall at the monochord, made it already evident that the diesis, taken from the "enharmonic" division of the tetrachord, was used here as a microtonal shift in different melodic modes of the diatonic genus.

== Composition of the manuscript ==

The Tonary of Saint-Bénigne of Dijon is organized in a very rare form of a fully notated [[tonary]], which serves like a fully notated music manuscript for mass ([[gradual]]) and office chant ([[antiphonary]]).&lt;ref&gt;It has been preserved in the Bibliothèque Inter-Universitaire, Section Médecine, at the [[University of Montpellier]] (Ms. H.159), and it was issued as a facsimile in the series illustrating the relics of ancient musical notation, ''Paléographie Musicale'' (first series, Solesmes, [[#PM05|1896]]; reprinted twice: Bern, 1972; Solesmes, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

The first division of the chant book is between the book's gradual (ff. 13r-155v) and an antiphonary fragment (ff. 156r-162v) which has the [[Matins]] for Palm Sunday, St. Blasius and St. Hylarius in the conventional liturgical order, but with tonal rubrics.&lt;ref&gt;This form was also used in a contemporary Aquitanian abridged [[antiphonary]] or [[breviary]] (Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale, fonds lat., Ms. 1085), the only difference is that every chant is just represented by an incipit and that the tonal classification is a Latin ordinal according to the system of Hucbald (tonus I-VIII). William of Volpiano followed also here the shape of another [[tonary]] type and used classifications like [https://archive.org/stream/palographiemus0105gaja#page/308/mode/2up "P TE"] for "Plagi tetrardi" as they were already used in the 9th-century Gradual-Sacramentary of Saint-Denis (Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale, fonds lat., Ms. 118).&lt;/ref&gt; The last leaf was added from another book to use the blank versoside for additions on the last pages written by other hands, chant notated in adiastematic neumes but without alphabetic notation and even diastematic neumes with alphabetic notation (ff. 160r-163r).&lt;ref&gt;See [http://manuscrits.biu-montpellier.fr/images/159161rZ.jpg folio 161 recto].&lt;/ref&gt;

The gradual itself with proper mass chant is divided into six parts: The first are antiphons ([[introit]]s and [[Communion (chant)|communions]]) (ff. 13r-53r). The next three parts are chant genres which precedes lessons: [[Alleluia (chant)|alleluia]] verses for [[Gospel Book|gospel]] readings (ff. 53v-69r), the benedictiones (hymnus trium puerorum) for [[Lectionary|prophetic]] readings (ff. 75r-76v), and the [[Responsory|graduels]] for [[epistle]] readings (ff. 77r-98v). The last two parts are an ''offertorial'' (ff. 99r-151r) and a [[Tract (liturgy)|tractus]] collection (ff. 69r-74v; 151v-155v), dedicated to the genre which replace the alleluia verses during fasten time for all kinds of scriptural readings.&lt;ref&gt;An exact description of its content can be found in the analytic table of the facsimile edition in the serial of [[#PM05|Paléographie musicale]] ([https://archive.org/stream/palographiemus0105gaja#page/n13/mode/2up VIII, 9-18]).&lt;/ref&gt;

The third level of division are the eight parts according to the oktoechos in the order of autentus protus, plagi proti, autentus deuterus etc. In the first part, every tonal section has all introits according to the liturgical year cycle and then all communions according to the liturgical order. The whole disposition is not new, but it is identical with tonaries from different regions of the [[Cluniac Reforms|Cluniac Monastic Association]]. The only difference is, that every chant is not represented by an incipit, it is fully notated in neumes and in alphabetic notation as well. Thanks to this manuscript, even cantors who do not know the chant, can memorize the melody together with its tonus.

As an example might serve the Introitus "Repleatur os meum" used as a refrain for psalm 70 during the procession into the church, at the beginning of the morning mass on Saturday before Pentecost. The introit was written in the first part of the antiphons and is quite at the beginning of the deuterus section (written as heading on each page), hence an introit in the 3rd tone or "autentus deuterus":
[[File:Tonary of Saint-Bénigne de Dijon.jpg|thumb|900px|center|alt=Montpellier, Bibliothèque Inter-Universitaire, Section Médecine, Ms. H159, f. 25v|The introit "Repleatur os meum" of the authentic deuterus mode with the psalm 70 "In te domine speravi" and its ''differentia'' "ii" notated with "amen" ([[Montpellier]], Bibliothèque interuniversitaire de Médecine, Ms. [[#MOfH159|H159]], f. 25v)]]
The beginning with the psalm incipit and the ending of the psalmody, here called ''differentia'' no. "ii", follows the antiphon. The antiphons of the entrance (introits) have the gradual order of the mass as a rubric at the margin (on a verso page as here: left), i.e. the serial for the day with ''gradual'' ('''R'''), ''alleluia'' ('''All''') or ''tractus'' ('''TR'''), ''offertorium'' ('''OF'''), and ''communio'' ('''CO'''). A conventional [[tonary]] with the list of ''differentiae'' was also attached to the beginning of the manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;See the coloured reproductions of the folios [http://manuscrits.biu-montpellier.fr/images/159011rZ.jpg 11 recto] and [http://manuscrits.biu-montpellier.fr/images/159011vZ.jpg 11 verso] and the transcription in the analytic table of the PM edition ([https://archive.org/stream/palographiemus0105gaja#page/n15/mode/2up 1901, VIII, 10]).&lt;/ref&gt; It was used as an index to find the ''differentia'' no. ii or melodic ending used during the recitation of the [[psalm]] - here the incipit refers to psalm 70 of the [[Vulgata]]. This tonary is preceded by an alleluia collection written in central French neumes in campo aperto.

The style of William of Volpiano's tonary which follows, is unique, and Michel Huglo called it one of the finest tonaries which survived in the manuscript collections today. The scribe used red ink for the chant text and different colours to decorate its initials, while the neume and the alphabetic notation was written in black ink.&lt;ref&gt;See folio [http://manuscrits.biu-montpellier.fr/images/159014rZ.jpg 14 recto].&lt;/ref&gt;

== William of Volpiano's contribution to the evolution of musical notation ==

William of Volpiano's innovation of the notation system did not change the habits of central French neume notation, it just added an own alphabetic pitch notation. Often it was not clear how the letters refer to the neumes. Letter groups usually refer to the group of a ligature, but sometimes neumes were added as well to the letters to help the reading cantor for the coordination.

Among the monastic reforms of [[Normandy]] [[William of Volpiano]] was an important protagonist among the local abbots, but his alphabetic notation was only used over the following centuries in the Norman monasteries of his school, but never in the later Italo-Norman manuscripts which were rather influenced by the [[Saint Martial school|Aquitanian school]] (a few manuscripts used central French neumes, but without alphabetic notation). Within the Cluniac Monastic Association, the cantors of the following generation like [[Adémar de Chabannes]] who was taught by his uncle Roger at [[Abbey of Saint Martial, Limoges|Saint-Martial Abbey of Limoges]] ([[Aquitaine]]), developed a new diastematic neume notation which allowed to indicate the ligatures, even if they were separated by the vertical disposition according to their pitch class. His innovation was imitated by Italian cantors, first in Northern Italy than in other reform centres of the 11th century like [[Benevento]] and [[Monte Cassino]]. During the 12th century one are two lines were added to help the scribe and the reader for a constant vertical orientation.

After the first generation of fully notated neume manuscripts written since the early 10th century,&lt;ref&gt;One of the earliest Southern French testimonies of local melodic neume notation («notation protoaquitaine») can be found in a gradual written about 890 (Albi, Bibliothèque municipale Rochegude, Ms. 44), where only 27 pieces have musical notation and usually only in some parts. Nevertheless, the scriptor left space for the notator (see the Christmas masses on [http://archivesnumeriques.mediatheques.grand-albigeois.fr/_images/OEB/RES_MS044/index.htm folio 5r–5v] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140319062306/http://archivesnumeriques.mediatheques.grand-albigeois.fr/_images/OEB/RES_MS044/index.htm |date=March 19, 2014 }}), even if it had not always been used for later additions of neumes.
&lt;/ref&gt; the particular notation system represent a transition between the adiastematic and diastematic neumes. During the 11th century a lot of local traditions, different from the chant repertory of the Roman-Frankish reform, were codified the first time in diastematic neumes: [[Beneventan chant|Old Beneventan chant]] (Beneventan neumes without lines), [[Aquileian Rite|Ravenna chant]] (Beneventan neumes), [[Old Roman chant]] (Roman neumes without lines), [[Ambrosian chant|Ambrosian]] or Milanese chant (square neumes on a penta- or tetragramm).

{{anchor|martini}}[[File:The perfect martini.jpg|thumb|upright=1.14|A [[Martini (cocktail)|martini]] served straight up, with a lime twist]]

Various unique terminology is used in [[Bartender|bartending]].

==Definitions and usage==

===Straight===
{{Anchor|Straight up}}
{{wiktionary|straight up}}
In [[bartending]], the term "straight up" (or "up") refers to an alcoholic drink that is shaken or stirred with ice and then strained and served without ice in a [[Cocktail glass|stemmed glass]].&lt;ref name=Manual&gt;{{cite book|title=National Bartending Center Instruction Manual|last=Walkart|first= C.G.|year=2002|publisher=Bartenders America, Inc|location=Oceanside, California|pages= 104 and 106}} ASIN: B000F1U6HG.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is substantial confusion in the usage of "neat", or "straight up", "straight", and "up".&lt;ref name="morgen" /&gt; In the context of describing ways of serving a drink, all of these mean "served without ice", but only "neat" implies serving the drink at room temperature.&lt;ref name="morgen" /&gt; Some bar patrons and bartenders use the terms inconsistently. The terms "straight" and "straight up" can be ambiguous, as they are sometimes used to mean "neat"; "neat" and "up" are relatively unambiguous.&lt;ref name="morgen"/&gt;

"Straight" is often used interchangeably with "neat" (in the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States). However, "straight" is also often used to refer to a spirit that is in an unmixed state in general, in addition to being used to describe a way of serving it. For example, many [[Bourbon Whiskey|bourbons]] are identified as "[[Kentucky]] straight bourbon whiskey" on their bottling labels, and U.S. Federal law contains a legal definition of the term "[[straight whiskey]]". So sometimes "straight" may be used to mean ''either'' "straight up" (as defined above) or "neat", and clarification may be needed to determine the exact manner for serving it.

===Neat===
{{wiktionary|neat}}
A drink served "neat" is a single, unmixed [[Distilled beverage|liquor]] served without being chilled and without any water, ice, or other [[Drink mixer|mixer]].&lt;ref name=Manual /&gt;&lt;ref name="morgen"&gt;"[http://www.jeffreymorgenthaler.com/2008/up-neat-straight-up-or-on-the-rocks/ Up, Neat, Straight Up, or On the Rocks]", Jeffrey Morgenthaler, Friday, May 9, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Neat drinks are typically served in a [[rocks glass]], [[shot glass]], [[snifter]], [[Glencairn whisky glass|Glencairn]] glass, or [[copita]].

=== On the rocks===
{{wiktionary|on the rocks}}
[[File:Negroni served in Vancouver BC.jpg|thumb|left|A [[negroni]] cocktail with a lemon [[Twist (cocktail garnish)|twist]] served on the rocks]]
"On the rocks" refers to liquor poured over ice cubes, and a "rocks drink" is a drink served on the rocks. Rocks drinks are typically served in a [[rocks glass]], [[highball glass]], or [[Collins glass]], all of which refer to a relatively straight-walled, flat-bottomed glass; the rocks glass is typically the shortest and widest, followed by the highball which is taller and often narrower, then the Collins which is taller and narrower still.

===Garnish===
"With a twist" signals the bartender to add a "[[Twist (cocktail garnish)|twist]]" of the [[Zest_(ingredient)|zest]] of a [[Citrus|citrus]] fruit (bar choice, if unspecified) to the cocktail. Often, the bartender will hang the rind of the citrus on the glass as a [[Cocktail garnish|garnish]] (see [[#martini|martini photo]] above).

=== Details ===
[[Cocktail]]s are generally served chilled, although some (e.g., [[margarita]]s) may be served either with or without ice, and this must be specified. Cocktails can be served "frozen" which is with crushed ice instead of cubes.
 
Unmixed liquors may be served either neat, up, or on the rocks, with differing conventions. High quality [[whisky]] and other aged liquor is most often served neat, while lower quality whisky is usually served with a mixer or on the rocks. [[Vodka]] can be stored as a liquid well below the freezing point of water because of its high proof and low particulate content, and cocktails made with sub-freezing vodka are sometimes requested to minimize the amount of added water from melted ice during shaking.

===Chaser===
{{Wiktionary|chaser}}
A shot of whisky, [[tequila]], or vodka, when served neat in a shot glass,  is often accompanied by a "chaser" (a mild drink consumed after a shot of [[hard liquor]]) or a "water back" (a separate glass of water). These terms commingle as well; it is common in many locales to hear a "beer back" ordered as the chaser to a shot. A drink may specifically be ordered "no chaser" as well.

A "chaser" in the UK however usually refers to a shot taken after a pint of beer or similar.

==Well and top-shelf==
Drinks establishments will often have a lower-priced category of drinks, known as "[[well drink]]s" or "rail drinks", and a higher-priced category known as "top-shelf" or "call" drinks, and will use [[upselling]] by offering the higher-priced category when taking orders. The terms come from the relative positions of the bottles of spirit used for the drinks; the cheapest version of a spirit offered by a bar is typically stored in a long rail or "well" making it readily available to a busy bartender, while the more expensive, better-quality liqueurs and spirits are displayed on shelves behind the bar where they attract patrons to the available selection.

==Sizes==
{{Further|shot glass}}
A "[[Pony (disambiguation)#Fluid volume|pony]]" is slang for {{convert|1|USoz|spell=in}} of spirit, while the standard-size "shot" of alcohol is a {{convert|1.5|USoz|adj=on}} "jigger", with a "double" being {{convert|3|USoz|spell=in}}.

Rather than use measuring equipment, professional bartenders usually use a pour spout inserted into the mouth of the bottle, which restricts the flow of liquid to a standard rate allowing reasonably accurate time-based pours. For instance, a "6-count" is a common analogue for a 1.5oz jigger, which can be trained to by having the bartender upend the bottle (with pour spout installed) and counting to 6 out loud as quickly as the words can be said clearly. This method breaks down into convenient sub-measures; each count is approximately one-quarter fluid ounce, making a "pony" 4 counts and a "half-jigger" 3 counts. This system is not perfect because liquids of different [[viscosity|viscosities]] will pour at different rates through the same spout, but it does allow consistent pours from drink to drink for a consistent result from each bartender, while being much faster than using a thimble measure or similar [[Alcoholic spirits measure|spirit measure]].

A blind tour is a very different experience owing to the absence of one vital sense, sight, thereby stimulating the other relevant senses, namely hearing, feel and smell.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11687">[[File:RobertMontgomeryApr1939.jpg|thumb|right|[[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]] before a Senate committee in Washington, D.C. on April&amp;nbsp;3, 1939 to oppose a bill designed to prohibit block booking]]
'''Block booking''' is a system of selling multiple [[film]]s to a [[Movie theater|theater]] as a unit. Block booking was the prevailing practice among [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]]'s [[studio system|major studios]] from the turn of the 1930s until it was outlawed by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]]'s decision in ''[[United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.]]'' (1948). Under block booking, "independent ('unaffiliated') theater owners were forced to take large numbers of [a] studio's pictures sight unseen. Those studios could then parcel out second-rate product along with A-class features and star vehicles, which made both production and distribution operations more economical."{{sfn|Schatz|1988|p=39}} The element of the system involving the purchase of unseen pictures is known as '''blind bidding'''.

==Origins in the silent era==
[[Paramount Pictures]], under [[Adolph Zukor]]'s leadership, was largely responsible for introducing the practice of block booking to Hollywood:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
At a time when star prominence was the single most important factor determining a film's box-office success, Zukor had cornered the market. In a 1918 popularity poll...the six top stars on the list—[[Mary Pickford]], [[Marguerite Clark]], [[Douglas Fairbanks]], [[Harold Lockwood]], [[William S. Hart]], and [[Wallace Reid]]—were all under contract to Zukor.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Using this leverage, Paramount was able to insist that prospective exhibitors interested in, say, the Pickford films, acquire them in large blocks along with a quantity of less attractive titles. These block-booking arrangements typically included groups of from 13 to 52 or even 104 titles. Paramount salesmen offered a variety of different product lines, from the top-quality Artcraft releases of Pickford, Fairbanks, and Hart to the more modest Realart productions, in which stars such as [[Bebe Daniels]] were being developed. Because these films had not yet been produced, exhibitors were required to "buy blind" from a sketchy prospectus or campaign book.{{sfn|Koszarski|1990|pp=71-72}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
All of the other major studios, with the exception of [[United Artists]], ultimately copied these policies to varying degrees. For much of the 1920s, Paramount and growing [[Warner Bros.]], in particular, "relied heavily on block booking and blind bidding."{{sfn|Schatz|1988|p=39}} Already, in 1921 the [[Federal Trade Commission]] had launched an investigation of the studios' booking practices that would last for eleven years. A 1927 cease-and-desist order was disregarded by the majors.{{sfn|Koszarski|1990|p=72}} Smaller distributors such as [[Associated Exhibitors]] who attempted to retain open booking were eventually driven to accept the practice.&lt;ref&gt;Ward p.86&lt;/ref&gt;

==The system's growth and demise==
With Hollywood's conversion to [[sound film]] in the late 1920s, block booking increasingly became standard practice: in order to get access to a studio's attractive A pictures, many theaters were obliged to rent the company's entire output for a season.{{sfn|Schatz|1988|pp=74-75}}  [[Paramount Pictures]] President Adolph Zukor obtained the Paramount-Publix chains of theaters that totaled in 1,200 screens, and insisted that the exhibitors and independent theaters sign a contract with their company if they wanted the exclusive, top-of-the-line [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] productions.{{sfn|Torre|2009|p=503}} With a whole season's worth of films offered up on an all-or-nothing basis, theaters weren't just bidding on movies they hadn't seen, but on many movies not yet even made. This was also called "blind-bidding" because, other than knowing the genre, the actors and actresses, and a brief overview of the plot, the exhibitors knew nothing about the films they were acquiring. In one case, Zukor had pressured theater operators to buy a block of one hundred and four films each year and forced  them to show two films per week, for fifty-two consecutive weeks.{{sfn|Torre|2009|p=503}} With the [[B movie]]s—less expensively produced films intended to run as the lower half of [[double feature]]s—rented at a flat fee (rather than the box office percentage basis of A films), rates could be set that essentially guaranteed the profitability of every B movie. Block booking and blind bidding meant that the majors didn't have to worry over much about the quality of these B pictures:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Knowing that even the poorest picture would find an outlet, the studios could operate at full capacity. In the process, the majors shifted the risks of production financing to the independent exhibitor. The long-term effects of the policy also stifled competition by foreclosing the market to independent producers and distributors. In short, block booking allowed the majors to wrest the greatest amount of profits from the marketplace.{{sfn|Balio|1993|p=20}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Along with the blocks of features, exhibitors were required to take the major's [[short subject|shorts]] as well—a practice known as ''full-line forcing''.{{sfn|Balio|1993|p=19}} The smaller Hollywood studios—known collectively as [[Poverty Row]]—didn't have the big pictures with A-list stars that would have allowed them to compel theater owners to directly block book. Instead, they mostly sold exclusive regional distribution rights to so-called states' rights firms. These distributors in turn marketed blocks of movies to exhibitors, typically six or more pictures featuring the same star (given that the films' source was Poverty Row, a relatively minor star).{{sfn|Taves|1993|pp=326–327}} In July 1938, the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]]'s [[antitrust]] division filed a suit, ''[[United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.|United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc. et al.]]'', charging the eight major Hollywood studios with violating the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]].

The Sherman Trust Act of 1890 controlled the interstate commerce with different trust-busting provisions and were brought to bear against studio system monopolistic activities.{{sfn|Torre|2009|p=503}} Block booking and blind bidding were at the heart of the practices charged as illegally monopolistic.{{sfn|Schatz|1997|pp=15-16}}
The Department of Justice filed suit against the distribution arms of Hollywood studios in the Famous Players-Lasky antitrust case of 1928. The Department of Justice charged the ten entities that controlled ninety eight percent of the domestic theatrical distribution. Appeals were filed and the studios were able to prevent charges from being followed through until 1929, due to the collapse of the [[stock market]] and the [[Great Depression]] happening at the same time, making this issue moot.{{sfn|Torre|2009|p=503}} The major studios controlled the programming of their theaters and also had negotiated wide-ranging distribution deals that constricted the financial state of independent theaters.

On October 29, 1940, the Big Five studios ([[Loews Cineplex Entertainment|Loews]]/[[MGM]], Paramount, [[20th Century-Fox]], [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros.-First National]], and [[RKO]]—the majors that owned large theater chains) signed a [[consent decree]] in an attempt to settle the case. It provided, among other things, that "block booking would continue, but in blocks no larger than five films; trade shows would be held regularly to provide exhibitors with advance screenings; [and] forcing of shorts and newsreels was banned."{{sfn|Schatz|1997|p=20}} Because the decree was forged after the September 1 beginning of the 1940–41 exhibition season, the new blocks-of-five arrangement did not go into effect until the 1941–42 season.{{sfn|Schatz|1997|p=21}} When the consent decree lapsed in 1942, most of the majors continued with blocks of five, though MGM went with blocks of twelve for two years. In contrast, Warner Bros. abandoned blocks altogether in 1943.{{sfn|Schatz|1997|pp=45, 72, 160–161}} The practice was entirely outlawed by the Supreme Court's 1948 decision, United States v. Paramount et al., against the studios in the ''Paramount'' antitrust case.{{sfn|Barnouw|1990}}

In concurrence with decisions held by the lower courts, the Supreme Court ruled that all of the major movie studios had prevented domestic and foreign competition through their control over theaters. In its 1948 decision, the Supreme Court ordered the elimination of block booking and demanded a separation of theater holdings from production and distribution. Without control over block booking, studios feared that they could no longer force theaters to buy up to 400 movies each year. In anticipation of mass profit-loss, studios cut production schedules and terminated contracts with actors, producers, directors and other staff. Newly unemployed artists began pursuing careers in television. As popular movie actors transitioned from the silver screen to the television screen, viewers followed their favorite artists to the new medium. In 1951, almost all cities with television stations saw a significant increase in movie theater closures corresponding with a simultaneous increase in television viewership. The substantial rise in television’s popularity during the 1950s can be largely attributed to the Supreme Court’s decision to outlaw block booking.{{sfn|Barnouw|1990}}

== Overview ==
{{See also|List of Boogiepop media}}

To face the "enemies of the world", the ''[[shinigami]]'' Boogiepop automatically rises to the surface. In Boogiepop's world, the Towa Organization, a shadowy group seeking to control humanity, managed to capture an alien organism who had taken the form of a [[evolution|highly evolved]] human. By studying him, the Towa Organization was able to create synthetic humans, people who have been artificially enhanced with special abilities. The mission of the Towa Organization and its agents is to find and kill MPLS, people who are more evolved than others and possess special abilities. However, Boogiepop will not let the Towa Organization get its way and he is not alone in his efforts.

The Boogiepop series is very much about the characters: their relationships, their pasts, their memories. This is especially true for how their pasts molded them into the people they are today. It can also be seen through scenes being presented from the perspective of different characters, and how the individual casts a different "feel" by how they relate to events.&lt;ref name="bpdvd1com"&gt;DVD commentary featuring Jeff Thompson and Joe DiGiorgi (August 2001) ''Boogiepop Phantom Evolution 1''&lt;/ref&gt; Another important theme is change.

== Characters ==
{{Main|List of Boogiepop characters}}
Each Boogiepop title has its own cast of characters, and many of these characters will make appearances in more than one title, but there are only four central characters that are consistently at the center of the plot.

; {{nihongo|[[Boogiepop (character)|Boogiepop]]|ブギーポップ|Bugīpoppu}}

The [[shinigami]] whispered of among the female students of Shinyo Academy, few people know that Boogiepop actually exists. Normally dormant, Boogiepop rises to the surface when enemies of the world appear. Boogiepop's appearance and voice are ambiguous: they seem both masculine and feminine at the same time. However, hidden beneath his signature black cloak and black, pipe-shaped hat, little is ever seen of him. Straight-faced and to the point, Boogiepop acts as mechanical as he claims to be. Boogiepop speaks in an archaic manner, and seems fond of whistling the overture to [[Wagner|Wagner's]] ''[[Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg]]''.

; {{nihongo|[[Miyashita Touka|Touka Miyashita]]|宮下藤花|Miyashita Tōka}}

An ordinary, happy school girl at Shinyo Academy, Miyashita is in love with her boyfriend, Keiji Takeda, and close friends with Suema. Not particularly good at school, she does not stand out in any way. Unknown to most, she was hospitalized as a child, and this saw her life change, though even Miyashita herself does not seem to know the truth of what happened, and was simply told that she had been possessed by a [[kitsune]]. Unknowingly, when the world is in trouble, she carries a Spalding sports bag containing the effects of Boogiepop, her [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. She has no recollection of her time as Boogiepop, and alters her memories to explain the blanks.

; {{nihongo|[[Kirima Nagi|Nagi Kirima]]|霧間凪|Kirima Nagi}}

Known as the Fire Witch to many, Kirima has made few friends due the way she distances herself from others: she knows that she is too dangerous for 'normal' people to associate with. She has a [[messianic complex]], and seeks to save the world from whatever may threaten it. As such, whenever there are unusual happenings within the city, Kirima can be found investigating what has happened. In the past, she had spent a period of time in hospital. A combination of the events from that period of her life, as well as the death of her father, the famous writer Kirima Seiichi, brought her to follow this path in life. Extremely gifted both physically and intellectually, she has the basic tools she needs to carry out her self-appointed mission.

; {{nihongo|[[Suema Kazuko|Kazuko Suema]]|末間和子|Suema Kazuko}}

As a result of a childhood trauma, Suema has developed an unusual fascination with [[criminal psychology|criminal]] and [[abnormal psychology]], as well as the desire to not let anything occur around her without her knowing. As a result of this, she desperately seeks the truth about the unexplained events happening in her city, and meddles with forces best left untouched. Good friends with Miyashita Touka, Suema appreciates how she so open and unconditionally accepting of her, and looks out for her friend. She seeks to be closer with Kirima Nagi, who seems to know the answers to the questions that have haunted her all these years. Despite her involvement in several incidents, she has yet to see Boogiepop in action.

== Reception ==

=== Impact and influence ===

''Boogiepop and Others'' won the Fourth [[Dengeki Novel Prize]] in 1997 and was released in the Dengeki Book Collection in 1998 where it gained popularity.&lt;ref name="baohob"&gt;History of Boogiepop (1 March 2005) ''Boogiepop and Others''&lt;/ref&gt; It is credited with popularizing light novels,&lt;ref name="sselicense" /&gt; as well as redefining young adult fiction in Japan.&lt;ref name="annbr1rev"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/reviews/display.php?id=1017|last=Martin|first=Theron|title=Boogiepop Returns: VS Imaginator, Part 1|date=2006-07-27|accessdate=2006-07-28|publisher=Anime News Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later adapted into a live action film by Ryu Kaneda, a two-volume manga by Kouji Ogata and served as the inspiration for a [[soundtrack]] composed by [[Yuki Kajiura]].&lt;ref name="ultimate1" /&gt; ''Boogiepop and Others'' also sets the scene for the anime, ''Boogiepop Phantom'', which has its backstory loosely based on the climax of the light novel. Having already gained a strong readership among High School and University age men, the release of ''[[Boogiepop Returns: VS Imaginator Part 1]]'' was met with overwhelming support. By the time the ''Boogiepop and Others'' film was released, the Boogiepop series was a bestseller, with over two million copies in print.&lt;ref name="baohob" /&gt;

=== Reviews ===
The Boogiepop series has received high praise from critics. ''Boogiepop Phantom'' has received the most exposure, where it is often compared to ''[[Serial Experiments Lain]]'' and ''[[Paranoia Agent]]''.&lt;ref name="ultimate2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gomanga.com/news/boogiepop_02.php|last=Smith|first=Lesley|title=Boogiepop: The Ultimate Guide (Part 2 of 4)|date=2006-01-30|accessdate=2006-06-20|publisher=[[Seven Seas Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been noted that the series is "not your average anime", and one that "demands your attention".&lt;ref name="ntusabprev"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lopez|first=Javier|date=January 2003|title=[[Newtype USA]]|publisher=[[A.D.

Far less critiqued, the ''Boogiepop and Others'' film fares less well than its sequel. Whilst the characters and plot were well received, the [[special effects]] and costumes have been described as "campy", but "par for the course of something of this level and budget".&lt;ref name="aodvdborev"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animeondvd.com/reviews2/disc_reviews/3885.php |last=Beveridge |first=Chris |title=Boogiepop and Others |date=2 July 2005 |accessdate=2006-06-23 |publisher=Anime on DVD |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061101173507/http://www.animeondvd.com/reviews2/disc_reviews/3885.php |archivedate=2006-11-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The movie is, however, cited as being easier to watch, and is recommended to fans of the anime, so as to gain "a complete understanding of the Boogiepop events".&lt;ref name="mementoborev"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.designchronicle.com/memento/archives/boogiepop_and_others.html|title=Boogiepop and Others|date=11 February 2004|accessdate=2006-06-23|publisher=Memento}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Boogiepop and Others'' novel has received more favorable reviews, though these have mostly focused on the translation, which has been cited as "a standard against which future Japanese novel translations are judged".&lt;ref name="annbonrev"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/reviews/display.php?id=959|last=Martin|first=Theron|title=Boogiepop and Others|date=13 March 2006|accessdate=2006-06-23|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also received praise for ripping "the rules of narrative wide open",&lt;ref name="rtobonrev"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/columns/rightturnonly.php?id=25|last=Santos|first=Carlo|title=RIGHT TURN ONLY!!|date=21 March 2006|accessdate=2006-06-23|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially for how it allows the characters to grow on the reader.&lt;ref name="aodvdbonrev"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animeondvd.com/reviews2/manga/manga.php?manga_view=2051|last=Pine|first=Jarred|title=Boogiepop|date=17 March 2006|accessdate=2006-06-23|publisher=Anime on DVD|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060325061759/http://www.animeondvd.com/reviews2/manga/manga.php?manga_view=2051|archivedate=25 March 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Boogiepop Returns: VS Imaginator Part 1'' continues receiving positive feedback for its easy-to-read style and excellent translation, as well as its use of atmosphere and characters. The main flaw, however, is the briefness of the title, which has clearly been used to set up the sequel.&lt;ref name="annbr1rev" /&gt;

''Boogiepop Doesn't Laugh'' has received generally favorable reviews, particularly for capturing some of the more complicated scenes better than the original light novel. This makes the plot easier to follow, and captures the urgency of the climactic battle.&lt;ref name="rtobdl2rev"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/columns/rightturnonly.php?id=34|last=Santos|first=Carlo|title=RIGHT TURN ONLY!!|date=25 July 2006|accessdate=2006-07-26|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has been noted that breaking the complicated plot of ''Boogiepop and Others'' into a multi-volume manga results in individually weak volumes.&lt;ref name="rtobdl1rev"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/columns/rightturnonly.php?id=28|last=Santos|first=Carlo|title=RIGHT TURN ONLY!!|date=2 May 2006|accessdate=2006-06-23|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with ''Boogiepop Phantom'', the character designs have been noted as "lookalike and nondescript", which can make some of the events difficult to follow. The art has also been described as "washed out and dull".&lt;ref name="rtobdl2rev" /&gt;

The '''Brown Paper Bag Test''' in African-American [[oral history]] was a form of racial discrimination practiced within the [[African Americans|African-American]] community by comparing an individual's skin tone to the color of a [[Paper bag|brown paper bag]]. The test was allegedly used as a way to determine whether or not an individual could have certain privileges; only those with a skin color that matched or was lighter than a brown paper bag were allowed admission or membership privileges. The test was believed by many to be used in the 20th century by many African-American social institutions such as sororities, fraternities, and churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pilgram|first1=David|title=Brown Paper Bag Test|url=http://www.ferris.edu/news/JimCrow/question/feb14/index.htm|website=Ferris State University|publisher=Ferris State University|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also used in reference to larger issues of class and social stratification within the African American population. [[Audrey Elisa Kerr]] has researched and documented the practice.&lt;ref name="University of Tennessee Press"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southernct.edu/academics/schools/arts/departments/english/fullandparttimefaculty/kerr.html Dr. Kerr] is a professor at Southern Connecticut State University.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Color discrimination==
[[File:2012 IAAF World Indoor by Mardetanha3245 (cropped).JPG|thumb|Athletes with various skin tones]]
[[Privilege (social inequality)|Privilege]] has long been associated with [[skin tone]] in the [[African-American]] [[community]]. 
This is related to the [[enslavement]] of individuals based on [[race (human categorization)|race]].
Mixed-race children of white fathers were sometimes given [[wikt:privilege|privilege]]s ranging from more desirable work, apprenticeships or formal [[education]], allocation of property, or even freedom from enslavement. African Americans "contributed to colorism because they have benefited from the privilege of having a skin color closer to that of Whites and have embraced the notion that privilege comes with having light skin in America".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=African Americans Still Victims of Colorism|url=http://www.racismreview.com/blog/2011/03/26/african-americans-still-victims-of-colorism/|website=Racism Review|publisher=Wordpress|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lighter-skinned people of color were accorded certain social and economic advantages over darker-skinned people of color, even while suffering [[discrimination]]. According to Gordon, "light-skinned blacks formed exclusive clubs" after slavery was abolished in the United States.&lt;ref name="Skin-Deep Discrimination"&gt;{{cite web|title=Skin-Deep Discrimination|url=http://abcnews.go.com/2020/GiveMeABreak/story?id=548303&amp;page=1|website=ABC News|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some clubs were called "Blue Vein Societies", suggesting that if an individual's skin was light enough to show the blue cast of veins, they had more European ancestry (and, therefore, higher social standing.)&lt;ref name="Skin-Deep Discrimination"/&gt; Such discrimination was resented by African Americans with darker complexions. According to [[Henry Louis Gates Jr.]], in his book ''The Future of the Race'' (1996), the practice of the brown paper bag test may have originated in [[New Orleans, LA]], where there was a substantial third class of free people of color dating from the French colonial era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maxwell|first1=Bill|title=The paper bag test|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/08/31/Columns/The_paper_bag_test.shtml|website=St. Petersburg Times|publisher=Tampa Bay Times|accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The test was related to ideas of [[beauty]], in which some people believed that lighter skin and more European features, in general, were more attractive.

From 1900 until about 1950, "paper bag parties" are said to have taken place in neighborhoods of major [[United States|American]] cities with a high concentration of African Americans. Many churches, fraternities, and nightclubs used the "brown paper bag" principle as a test for entrance. People at these organizations would take a brown paper bag and hold it against a person's skin. If a person was lighter than the bag, he or she was admitted. People whose skin was not lighter than a brown paper bag were denied entry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10995079/page/4/ "Did Hurricane Katrina reveal a historic reality?" Excerpt from [[Michael Eric Dyson]]'s (2006) ''Come Hell or High Water'']&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is, too, a curious color dynamic that persists in our culture. In fact, New Orleans invented the brown paper bag party — usually at a gathering in a home — where anyone darker than the bag attached to the door was denied entrance. The brown bag criterion survives as a metaphor for how the black cultural elite quite literally establishes caste along color lines within black life. On my many trips to New Orleans, whether to lecture at one of its universities or colleges, to preach from one of its pulpits, or to speak at an empowerment seminar during the annual Essence Music Festival, I have observed color politics at work among black folk. The cruel color code has to be defeated by our love for one another. —[[Michael Eric Dyson]], excerpt from ''Come Hell or High Water''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dyson|first=Michael Eric|title=Come hell or high water : Hurricane Katrina and the color of disaster|year=2007|publisher=Basic Civitas|location=New York|isbn=978-0465017720|edition=Pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Historically black colleges and universities]] used the brown paper bag test as a way to critique candidates for admission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carter|first1=Jarrett|title=Bringing Back the Brown Paper Bag Test to HBCUs|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jarrett-l-carter/bringing-back-the-brown-p_b_3059700.html|website=Hoff Post Black Voices|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person's skin tone could affect whether they were admitted to a top school. For instance, Audrey Elisa Kerr refers to colleges requiring applicants to send personal photos.&lt;ref name="University of Tennessee Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kerri|first1=Audrey Elisa|title=The Paper Bag Principle: Class, Colorism, and Rumor and the Case of Black Washington, Part 3|date=2006|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|page=93|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kerr mentioned how this practice took place at a popular [[Historically black colleges and universities|HBCU]], Howard University.&lt;ref name="University of Tennessee Press"/&gt; Dr. Arnold relayed to  Kerr  a story concerning young women at Howard. Dr. Arnold had heard colorism was a factor when it came to admission to Howard.&lt;ref name="University of Tennessee Press"/&gt; Discrimination was also practiced by fraternities and sororities, whose members self-selected others like themselves, generally those reflecting partial European ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paper Bag Test: Letter From 1928 Addresses Black Fraternity And Sorority Colorism At Howard University|url=http://www.watchtheyard.com/history/brown-paper-bag/|website=watchtheyard|publisher=WatchTheYard.|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multi-racial people who had been free before the American Civil War attempted to distinguish themselves from the mass of freedmen after the war, who appeared to be mostly of African descent and had been confined to slavery.

==Colorism through the centuries==
[[File:Herriman 1902.png|thumb|Creole person in 1902]]
The offspring of African men and white women were often born into freedom, because of their mothers' legal status of slave vs. free, regardless of color.&lt;ref name="National Humanities Center"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=Heather|title=How Slavery Affected African American Families|url=http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/tserve/freedom/1609-1865/essays/aafamilies.htm|website=National Humanities Center|publisher=National Humanities Center|accessdate=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Negro womens children to serve according to the condition of the mother"&gt;{{cite web|title=Slavery and Indentured Servants|url=https://memory.loc.gov/ammem/awhhtml/awlaw3/slavery.html|website=Law Library of Congress|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A law, established in Virginia and other colonies in the 17th century, dictated that the legal status of these children would be determined by that of their mothers, rather than by their father's, in opposition to the tradition of English common law.&lt;ref name="National Humanities Center"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Negro womens children to serve according to the condition of the mother"/&gt; These free descendants became well-established, with descendants moving to frontier regions of [[Virginia]], [[North Carolina]] and west as areas opened up. Some prominent Americans were descendants of these early free families, for instance, [[Ralph Bunche]], who served as ambassador to the United Nations.&lt;ref name="freeafricanamericans.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heinegg|first1=Paul|title=Free African Americans of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware|url=http://www.freeafricanamericans.com/|accessdate=15 Feb 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as the 18th century, travelers remarked on the variety of color and features seen in slaves in Virginia, as European ancestry was obvious. Light-skinned slaves, some of whom were descendants of masters and their sons, were sometimes given better treatment on plantations, with domestic jobs inside the  master's house, including as companions or maids to his legal children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Household Slavery|url=https://www.boundless.com/u-s-history/textbooks/boundless-u-s-history-textbook/slavery-and-reform-1820-1840-16/slavery-in-the-u-s-122/household-slavery-656-1313/|publisher=boundless|accessdate=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of them were educated, or at least allowed to learn to read. Occasionally the master may have arranged for an apprenticeship for a mixed-race son and freed him upon its completion, especially in the first two decades after the American Revolution, when numerous slaves were freed in the Upper South. In this region, from the Revolution to 1810, the percentage of people of color who were free increased from 1 to more than 10 percent. By 1810, 75% of blacks in Delaware were free.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Kolchin, ''American Slavery: 1619-1877'', New York: Hill and Wang, 1994 Pbk, pp.78 and 81&lt;/ref&gt;

Newly imported Africans and African Americans with less visible European ancestry were used in hard field labor, and abuse was more frequent in the fields. As tensions concerning slave uprisings rose in the 19th century, slave states imposed more restrictions, including prohibitions on educating slaves and on slaves' movements.  These slaves could be punished for trying to learn to read and write.

In Louisiana especially, [[Creoles of color]] had long comprised a third class during the years of slavery. They had achieved a high level of literacy and sophistication under the French and Spanish rule, becoming educated, taking the names of white fathers or lovers, and often receiving property from the white men involved with their families. Many became artisans, property owners, and sometimes slaveholders themselves. Unlike in the Upper South, where free African Americans varied widely in appearance, free people of color in New Orleans and the Deep South tended to be light-skinned due to generations of intermarriage with people of European ancestry. After the United States negotiated the Louisiana Purchase, more Americans settled in New Orleans, bringing with them their binary approach to society, in which each person was classified only as black or white. They began to curtail the privileges of Creoles of color.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Kolchin, ''American Slavery: 1619-1877'', New York: Hill and Wang, 1994 Pbk, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

{{confuse|Charlottenburg Palace}}
'''Charlottenborg Palace''' ({{lang-da|Charlottenborg Slot}}) is a large town mansion located on the corner of [[Kongens Nytorv]] and [[Nyhavn]] in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. Originally built as a residence for [[Ulrik Frederik Gyldenløve, Count of Laurvig|Ulrik Frederik Gyldenløve]], it has served as the base of the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts]] since its foundation in 1754. Today it also houses [[Kunsthal Charlottenborg]], an institution for contemporary art, and Danmarks Kunstbibliotek, the Royal Art Library.

==History==
===Gyldenløve's mansion===
[[Image:Charlottenborg (Jacob Coning).jpg|thumb|left||Charlottenborg painted by [[Jacob Coning]] in 1694 as seen from the garden.]]
The site was donated by King [[Christian V of Denmark|Christian V]] to his half brother [[Ulrik Frederik Gyldenløve]] on  22 March 1669 in connection with the establishment of [[Kongens Nytorv]]. Gyldenløve built his new mansion from 1672 to 1683 as the first building on the new square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kobenhavnshistorie.dk/bog/kko/c/kko_c-10.html|title=Charlottenborg, Kongens Nytorv 1|publisher=Selskabet for Københavns Historie|language=Danish|accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main wing and two lateral wings were built from 1672 to 1677, probably under the architect [[Ewert Janssen]]. In 1783 mansion was extended with a rear, fourth wing was designed by [[Lambert van Haven]] . The bricks used were brought from [[Kalø Castle]] in [[Jutland]] which Gyldenløve owned and had pulled down.

In his old age, the large mansion became too big for Gyldenløve who sold it to the dowager queen Charlotte Amalie in 1700, hence the name. Gyldenløve built a new, smaller mansion on the corner of [[Bredgade]] and [[Dronningens Tværgade]] which became known as "Gyldenløve's little mansion", now [[Moltke's Mansion]], after a later owner, where he lived until his death in 1705.

After King [[Christian V]]´s death in 1699 the [[Queen Mother]], [[Charlotte Amalie of Hesse-Cassel|Charlotte Amalie]], purchased the Palace for 50,000 Danish crowns and it was renamed Charlottenborg Palace. In 1714, when the Queen Downer died, the place was passed to King [[Christian VI of Denmark|Christian VI]]. Renovations began in 1736-1737, and its use and users shifted for a period of time. A small theater was constructed and used for various concerts, operas and theatrical performances. The Palace Garden contained the [[University of Copenhagen Botanical Garden|Botanical Garden]] between 1778 - 1872.

===The Royal Danish Academy of Arts===
[[File:Charlottenborg 1742.jpg|thumb|200px|Charlottenborg in 1742]] 
In 1701, the old Academy of Arts began its activities in the Palace. The small school slowly grew and was finally formally inaugurated in the Charlottenborg Palace on March 31, 1754. In 1787, the ownership of the Palace was transferred to [[The Royal Danish Academy of Art]]. The Academy still occupies the Palace.

==Architecture==
Charlottenborg is a four-winged, three-storey building designed in the [[Baroque architecture|Dutch Baroque]] style  but also with some Italian influence.&lt;ref name=Gyldendal&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_historie/Danmark_efter_1945/Charlottenborg|title=Charlottenborg|language=Danish|publisher=Gyldendal|accessdate=2011-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main wing towards the square has a central risalit flanked by two more pronounced, two-bay corner risalit. All three are topped by balustrades. The central risalit is decorated with Corinthian pilasters and a Tuscan/Doric portal with balcony The facade has sandstone decorations and window pediments.

The lower rear wing consists of three pavilions. The central pavilion has a Tuscan arcade below, niches with busts above, and a lantern on the copper-covered roof.

===Interior===
The floor plan is remniscient of French castles. It has a [[piano nobile]] with a banguet hall above the main entrance, with access to the balcony, a ground floor with lower ceilings, and a second floors for servants with even lower ones. Ths arrangement became characteristic of mansions and upper-class town houses in the entire 18th century.&lt;ref name=Gyldendal/&gt;

In the rear wing, above the arcade, there is a well-preserved domed Baroque room with a splendid stucco ceiling.&lt;ref name=Gyldendal/&gt;

The '''Cinema of the Caribbean''' refers to the [[film industry]] in the [[Caribbean]].&lt;ref name="Martin 1995"/&gt; Compared to earlier times, a significant amount of filmmaking occurred in the Caribbean in the 1980s and onward.&lt;ref name="Martin 1995"/&gt; Prior to this time, filmmaking in the Caribbean was relatively minor.&lt;ref name="Martin 1995"/&gt; For example, in the 1970s, only a few films were made in Guadeloupe, Haiti and Jamaica.&lt;ref name="Martin 1995"/&gt; In the 1970s and prior to this time, the Caribbean generally lacked an infrastructure for filmmaking and film distribution.&lt;ref name="Martin 1995"/&gt;

In contemporary times, the cinema of the Caribbean has been described as an "expanded and ever-expanding field."&lt;ref name="Stone Cooke Dennison Marlow-Mann 2017"/&gt; It has been suggested that it can be challenging to document all of the full-length, feature films that have been produced in the Caribbean, because each country has its own filmmaking industry that is separate from the other countries' industries.&lt;ref name="Pattison Pattison 2015"/&gt;

==By country==
===Antigua and Barbuda===
''[[The Sweetest Mango]]'' is a 2001 film that was the first full-length feature film made in Antigua and Barbuda.&lt;ref name="Riggs 2006"/&gt;

[[File:Qilin-shaped incense burner 1 CAC.JPG|thumb|right|Chinese cloisonné enamel [[incense]] burner, 17th-18th centuries]]
'''''Cloisonné''''' ({{IPA-fr|klwazɔne}}) is an ancient technique for decorating [[metalwork]] objects. In recent centuries, [[vitreous enamel]] has been used, and inlays of cut [[gemstone]]s, glass and other materials were also used during older periods. The resulting objects can also be called ''cloisonné''. The decoration is formed by first adding compartments (''cloisons'' in French&lt;ref&gt;In French "cloison" is a general word for "compartment" or "partition" or "cell", in English the word is normally only used in the specialized context of cloisonné work, and apparently dentistry ([[OED]], "Cloison")&lt;/ref&gt;) to the metal object by [[solder]]ing or affixing silver or gold wires or thin strips placed on their edges. These remain visible in the finished piece, separating the different compartments of the enamel or inlays, which are often of several colors. Cloisonné enamel objects are worked on with enamel powder made into a paste, which then needs to be fired in a [[kiln]].

In antiquity, the cloisonné technique was mostly used for jewellery and small fittings for clothes, weapons or similar small objects decorated with geometric or schematic designs, with thick cloison walls. In the [[Byzantine Empire]] techniques using thinner wires were developed to allow more pictorial images to be produced, mostly used for religious images and jewellery, and by then always using enamel.  By the 14th century this enamel technique had spread to China, where it was soon used for much larger vessels such as bowls and vases; the technique remains common in China to the present day, and cloisonné enamel objects using Chinese-derived styles were produced in the West from the 18th century.

==History==
[[File:Flickr - portableantiquities - Hilt Fitting.jpg|thumb|8th (?) century [[Anglo-Saxon art|Anglo-Saxon]] sword hilt fitting, gold with [[garnet]] cloisonné  inlay. From the [[Staffordshire Hoard]], found in 2009, and not fully cleaned.]]

===Early techniques===
Cloisonné first developed in the jewellery of the ancient [[Near East]], typically in very small pieces such as rings, with thin wire forming the cloisons. In the jewellery of [[art of Ancient Egypt|ancient Egypt]], including the [[Pectoral (Ancient Egypt)|pectoral jewels]] of the [[Pharaoh]]s, thicker strips form the cloisons, which remain small.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 67-8. For an example see [http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/egyptian_art/pectoral_and_necklace_of_sithathoryunet/objectview.aspx?collID=10&amp;OID=100000450 Pectoral and Necklace of Sithathoryunet] Metropolitan Museum&lt;/ref&gt; In Egypt gemstones and enamel-like materials sometimes called "glass-paste" were both used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceramicstoday.com/articles/092501.htm Egyptian Paste] article from ''Ceramics Today'';. See also [[Egyptian faience]]. There are disputes as to whether, or when, such materials were fired with the object, or fired separately first and then cut into pieces to be inlaid like gems. It seems both methods may have been used. See Day, Enamelling, 7-10&lt;/ref&gt; The Byzantines perfected a unique form of cloisonné icons. [[Byzantine enamel]] spread to surrounding cultures and a particular type, often known as '''garnet cloisonné''' is widely found in the [[Migration Period art]] of the "[[barbarian]]" peoples of Europe, who used gemstones, especially red [[garnet]]s, as well as glass and enamel, with small thick-walled cloisons. Red garnets and gold made an attractive contrast of colours, and for Christians the garnet was a symbol of Christ. This type is now thought to have originated in the [[Late Antique]] [[Eastern Roman Empire]] and to have initially reached the Migration peoples as diplomatic gifts of objects probably made in [[Constantinople]], then copied by their own goldsmiths.&lt;ref&gt;Late Antiquity, 464.  See here for scientific [https://books.google.com/books?id=zP6bgkUWCTsC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=glass+cloisonne&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=glass%20cloisonne&amp;f=false materials analysis]&lt;/ref&gt; Glass-paste cloisonné was made in the same periods with similar results – compare the gold [[Anglo-Saxon]] fitting with garnets (right) and the [[Visigothic]] brooch with glass-paste in the gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RcAOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=Byzantine+cloisonne&amp;num=50&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Byzantine+cloisonne&amp;f=false|title=Dark-age Britain: Studies Presented to E. T. Leeds|first=Donald Benjamin|last=Harden|date=1956|publisher=Methuen|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thick ribbons of gold were soldered to the base of the sunken area to be decorated to make the compartments, before adding the stones or paste.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 173&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Green, 87-88&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes compartments filled with the different materials of cut stones or glass and enamel are mixed to ornament the same object, as in the [[Sutton Hoo purse-lid]].&lt;ref&gt;Gardner. [https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/p/purse_lid_from_the_ship-burial.aspx British Museum, Sutton Hoo purse-lid]&lt;/ref&gt; In the Byzantine world the technique was developed into the thin-wire style suitable only for enamel described below, which was imitated in Europe from about [[Carolingian]] period onwards.

===Enamel===
The earliest surviving cloisonné pieces are rings in graves from 12th century BC [[Cyprus]], using very thin wire.&lt;ref&gt;Michaelides, Panicos, ''The Earliest Cloisonne Enamels from Cyprus'', article from ''Glass on Metal, the Enamellist's Magazine'', April 1989, [http://glass-on-metal.com/pastart/earliestenamels-michaelides.htm online], 
[https://books.google.com/books?id=-aFtPdh6-2QC&amp;pg=PA259&amp;dq=earliest+enamel&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=earliest%20enamel&amp;f=false see also]&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequently, enamel was just one of the fillings used for the small, thick-walled cloisons of the Late Antique and Migration Period style described above.  From about the 8th century, [[Byzantine art]] began again to use much thinner wire more freely to allow much more complex designs to be used, with larger and less geometric compartments, which was only possible using enamel.&lt;ref&gt;The date of the change is uncertain, partly because Early Byzantine enamels were much forged in 19th century Russia, rather confusing historians.&lt;/ref&gt;   These were still on relatively small objects, although numbers of plaques could be set into larger objects, such as the [[Pala d'Oro]], the [[altarpiece]] in [[St Mark's Basilica|Saint Mark's Cathedral]], [[Venice]]. Some objects combined thick and thin cloisons for varied effect.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, 217&lt;/ref&gt; The designs often (as at right) contained a generous background of plain gold, as in contemporary [[Mosaic#Byzantine mosaics|Byzantine mosaics]].  The area to be enamelled was stamped to create the main depression, pricked to help the enamel adhere, and the cloisons added.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, 99, describing what appear to be trainee pieces in bronze, never completed.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two different techniques in Byzantine and European cloisonné enamel are distinguished, for which the German names are still typically used in English. The earliest is the '''''Vollschmelz''''' ("full" enamel, literally "full melt") technique where the whole of a gold base plate is to be covered in enamel. The edges of the plate are turned up to form a reservoir, and gold wires are soldered in place to form the ''cloisons''.  The enamel design therefore covers the whole plate.  In the '''''Senkschmelz''''' ("sunk" enamel, literally "sunk melt") technique the parts of the base plate to hold the design are hammered down, leaving a surrounding gold background, as also seen in contemporary Byzantine icons and mosaics with [[gold glass]] backgrounds, and the saint illustrated here. The wires and enamels are then added as before. The outline of the design will be apparent on the reverse of the base plate.&lt;ref&gt;Bàràny-Oberschall, 122-123; Lasko, 8—he prefers ""full" enamel" and ""sunk" enamel"; [https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/g/gold_and_enamel_cross.aspx British Museum on using the German names]&lt;/ref&gt; The transition between the two techniques occurs around 900 in Byzantine enamel,&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 11&lt;/ref&gt; and 1000 in the West, though with important earlier examples.&lt;ref&gt;Earlier Western examples are few but include the cover of the [[Lindau Gospels]], the foot-reliquary of St Andrew made for [[Egbert of Trier]], and the [[Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire]]; Lasko, 84-85&lt;/ref&gt;  The plaques with apostles of around the latter date on the [[Holy Crown of Hungary]] show a unique transitional phase, where the base plaque has hammered recesses for the design, as in ''senkschmelz'' work, but the enamel covers the whole plaque except for thick outlines around the figures and inscriptions, as in the ''vollschmelz'' technique (see the gallery below for examples of this technique and ''vollschmelz'' work).&lt;ref&gt;Bàràny-Oberschall, 122-123&lt;/ref&gt;  Some 10th-century pieces achieve a ''senkschmelz'' effect by using two plates superimposed on each other, the upper one with the design outline cut out and the lower one left plain.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 13 figure 7&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Chinese - Wine Pot - Walters 44569 - Side.jpg|thumb|An 18th century Chinese wine pot with cloissonné enamel and gilt bronze; the design was loosely based on a Zhou Dynasty inlaid bronzes of the 5th-4th centuries BC]]

From Byzantium or the Islamic world the technique reached [[China]] in the 13–14th centuries; the first written reference is in a book of 1388, where it is called "Dashi ware".  No Chinese pieces clearly from the 14th century are known, the earliest datable pieces being from the reign of the [[Xuande Emperor]] (1425–35), which however show a full use of Chinese styles suggesting considerable experience in the technique.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, 239. See also Dillon ref below.&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially regarded with suspicion by Chinese connoisseurs, firstly as being foreign, and secondly as appealing to feminine taste.  However, by the beginning of the 18th century the [[Kangxi Emperor]] had a cloisonné workshop among the many Imperial factories.  The most elaborate and highly valued Chinese pieces are from the early [[Ming Dynasty]], especially the reigns of the Xuande Emperor and [[Jingtai Emperor]] (1450–57), although 19th century or modern pieces are far more common.  The Chinese industry seems to have benefited from a number of skilled Byzantine refugees fleeing the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, although based on the name alone, it is far more likely China obtained knowledge of the technique from the middle east. In much Chinese  cloisonné blue is usually the predominant colour, and the Chinese name for the technique, ''jingtailan'' ("Jingtai blue ware"), refers to this, and the Jingtai Emperor. Quality began to decline in the 19th century.  Initially heavy [[bronze]] or [[brass]] bodies were used, and the wires soldered, but later much lighter [[copper]] vessels were used, and the wire glued on before firing.&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, 58-59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Orange Coast Magazine]], 95&lt;/ref&gt; The enamels compositions and the pigments change with time.

In Byzantine pieces, and even more in Chinese work, the wire by no means always encloses a separate color of enamel.  Sometime a wire is used just for decorative effect, stopping in the middle of a field of enamel, and sometimes the boundary between two enamel colors is not marked by a wire. In the Byzantine plaque at right the first feature may be seen in the top wire on the saint's black sleeve, and the second in the white of his eyes and collar.  Both are also seen in the Chinese bowl illustrated at top right.

Chinese cloisonné is amongst the best known enamel cloisonné in the world.

[[File:安藤七宝店 (44).jpg|thumb|Production process of an enamel vase by [[Ando Cloisonné Company]] in Nagoya]]
The Japanese also produced large quantities from the mid-19th century, of very high technical quality.&lt;ref&gt;V&amp;A&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan cloisonné enamels are known as ''shippō-yaki'' (七宝焼). Early centres of cloisonné were [[Nagoya]] during the [[Owari Domain]]. Companies of renown were the [[Ando Cloisonné Company]]. Later centres of renown were Edo and Kyoto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/j/japanese-cloisonne-the-seven-treasures/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151003105402/http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/j/japanese-cloisonne-the-seven-treasures/ |archivedate=2015-10-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Kyoto [[Namikawa (company)|Namikawa]] became one of the leading companies of Japanese cloisonné. The [[Namikawa Yasuyuki|Namikawa Yasuyuki Cloisonné Museum]] is specifically dedicated to it.

Russian cloisonné from the Tsarist era is also highly prized by collectors, especially from the [[House of Fabergé]] or [[Khlebnikov (firm)|Khlebnikov]], and the French and other nations have produced small quantities.  Chinese cloisonné is sometimes confused with Canton enamel, a similar type of enamel work that is painted on freehand and does not use partitions to hold the colors separate.

In medieval Western Europe cloisonné enamel technique was gradually overtaken by the rise of [[champlevé enamel]], where the spaces for the enamel to fill are created by making recesses (using various methods) into the base object, rather than building up compartments from it, as in cloisonné.  Later techniques were evolved that allowed the enamel to be painted onto a flat background without running.  [[Plique-à-jour]] is a related enameling technique which uses clear enamels and no metal backplate, producing an object that has the appearance of a miniature stained glass object - in effect cloisonné with no backing. Plique-a'-jour is usually created on a base of mica or thin copper which is subsequently peeled off (mica) or etched away with acid (copper).

Other ways of using the technique have been developed, but are of minor importance.  In 19th century Japan it was used on [[pottery]] vessels with ceramic glazes, and it has been used with [[lacquer]] and modern [[acrylic resin|acrylic]] fillings for the cloisons.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter&lt;/ref&gt;  A version of cloisonné technique is often used for lapel badges, logo badges for many objects such as cars, including [[BMW]] models, and other applications, though in these the metal base is normally cast with the compartments in place, so the use of the term cloisonne', though common, is questionable. That technique is correctly referred by goldsmiths, metalsmiths and enamellists as champlevé.

A large collection of 150 Chinese cloisonné pieces is at the [[G.W. Vincent Smith Art Museum]] in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]].

==Modern process==
[[File:CPPatternAndCloisons.jpg|thumb|right|Adding cloisons according to the pattern previously transferred to the workpiece]]
[[File:CPAddingFrit.jpg|thumb|right|Adding [[frit]] with dropper after sintering cloisons. Upon completion the piece will be fired, then ground (repeating as necessary) then polished and electroplated]]

First the object to be decorated is made or obtained; this will normally be made by different craftspeople. The [[metal]] usually used for making the body is copper, since it is cheap, light and easily hammered and stretched, but [[gold]], [[silver]] or other metals may be used. Cloisonné wire is made from fine silver or [[fine gold]] and is usually about .010 x .040&amp;nbsp;inches in cross section. It is bent into shapes that define the colored areas. The bends are all done at right angles, so that the wire does not curve up. This is done with small pliers, tweezers, and custom-made jigs. The cloisonné wire pattern may consist of several intricately constructed wire patterns that fit together into a larger design. Solder can be used to join the wires, but this causes the enamel to discolour and form bubbles later on. Most existing Byzantine enamels have soldered cloisons, however the use of solder to adhere the cloison wires has fallen out of favor due to its difficulty, with the exception of some "purist contemporary enamellists" who create fine watch faces and high quality very expensive jewelry. Instead of soldering the cloisons to the base metal, the base metal is fired with a thin layer of clear enamel. The cloisonné wire is glued to the enamel surface with gum [[tragacanth]]. When the gum has dried, the piece is fired again to fuse the cloisonné wire to the clear enamel. The gum burns off, leaving no residue.

Vitreous enamels in the different colors are ground to fine powders in an agate or porcelain mortar and pestle, then washed to remove the impurities that would discolor the fired enamel.&lt;ref name="BlairRamsay1991"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Blair|author2=Nigel Ramsay|title=English Medieval Industries: Craftsmen, Techniques, Products|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mxjCN8R4pgsC&amp;pg=PA127|year=1991|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-1-85285-326-6|pages=127–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The enamel is made from silica, niter, and lead oxide to which metallic oxides are added for coloring.  These ingredients are melted together, forming a glassy [[frit]] which is ground again before application. Each color of enamel is prepared this way before it is used and then mixed with a very dilute solution of gum tragacanth. Using fine spatulas, brushes or droppers, the enameler places the fine colored powder into each cloison.  The piece is left to dry completely before firing, which is done by putting the article, with its enamel fillings, in a kiln. The enamel in the cloisons will sink down a lot after firing, due to melting and shrinkage of the granular nature of the glass powder, much as sugar melting in an oven. This process is repeated until all cloisons are filled to the top of the wire edge.

Three styles of cloisonné are most often seen: concave, convex, and flat.  The finishing method determines this final appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Enamels Enameling Enamelists G.L. Matthews pp 146-147&lt;/ref&gt;  With concave cloisonné the cloisons are not completely filled. Capillary action causes the enamel surface to curve up against the cloisonné wire when the enamel is molten, producing a concave appearance. Convex cloissoné is produced by overfilling each cloison, at the last firing.  This gives each color area the appearance of slightly rounded mounds.  Flat cloisonné is the most common.  After all the cloisons are filled the enamel is ground down to a smooth surface with lapidary equipment, using the same techniques as are used for polishing cabochon stones.  The top of the cloisonné wire is polished so it is flush with the enamel and has a bright lustre.&lt;ref name="LibanMitchell2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Felicia Liban|author2=Louise Mitchell|title=Cloisonné Enameling and Jewelry Making|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G0PCAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT92|date=6 July 2012|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=978-0-486-13600-4|pages=92–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Matthews1984"&gt;{{cite book|author=Glenice Lesley Matthews|title=Enamels, Enameling, Enamelists|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P3NQAAAAMAAJ|year=1984|publisher=Chilton Book Company|isbn=978-0-8019-7285-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some cloisonné wire is [[electroplating|electroplated]] with a thin film of gold, which will not tarnish as silver does.&lt;ref name="Radok2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephanie Radok|title=An Opening: Twelve Love Stories about Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ap8RWIyXv2QC&amp;pg=PA104|year=2012|publisher=Wakefield Press|isbn=978-1-74305-043-9|pages=104–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hesse2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rayner W.

{{Anti-consumerism |Theories}}

'''Collaborative consumption''' encompasses the [[sharing economy]]. Collaborative consumption can be defined as the set of [[resource]] circulation systems, which enable [[consumer]]s to both "obtain" and "provide", temporarily or permanently, valuable resources or [[service (economics)|service]]s through direct interaction with other consumers or through a mediator.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ertz|first=Myriam |last2=Durif|first2=Fabien|last3=Arcand|first3=Manon|date=2016 |title=Collaborative consumption: Conceptual snapshot at a buzzword|ssrn=2799884 |journal=Academy of Strategic Management Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taeihagh|first=Araz|date=2017-06-19|title=Crowdsourcing, Sharing Economies, and Development|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0169796X17710072|journal=Journal of Developing Societies|doi=10.1177/0169796x17710072}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ertz|first=Myriam |last2=Durif|first2=Fabien|last3=Arcand|first3=Manon|date=2016 |title=Collaborative consumption or the rise of the two-sided consumer|ssrn=2799886 |journal=International Journal of Business and Management|volume=4|issue=6|pages=195–209}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collaborative consumption is not new; it has always existed (e.g. in the form of [[flea market]]s, [[swap meet]]s, [[garage sale]]s, [[car boot sale]]s, and [[second-hand shop]]s)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Belk|first=Russell |last2=Sherry|first2=John|last3=Wallendorf|first3=Melanie|date=1988 |title=A naturalistic inquiry into buyer and elle behavior at a swap meet|url=http://jcr.oxfordjournals.org/content/14/4/449.abstract |journal=Journal of Consumer Research |doi=10.1086/209128 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stone|first=Jonathan |last2=Horne|first2=Suzanne|last3=Hibbert|first3=Sally|date=1996 |title=Car boot sales: a study of shopping motives in an alternative retail format|doi=10.1108/09590559610131682| journal=International Journal of Retail &amp; Distribution Management|volume=24|issue=11 |page=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Definition==

The first detailed explanation of collaborative consumption in the modern era was contained in a paper from Marcus Felson and Joe L. Spaeth in 1978 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Felson|first=Marcus|title=Structure and Collaborative Consumption: A Routine Activity Approach |journal=American Behavioral Scientist|volume=21|issue=4|page=61|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/000276427802100411|accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It has regained a new impetus through [[information technology]], especially [[Web 2.0]], [[mobile technology]] and [[social media]].&lt;ref name="ritzer2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ritzer|first=George|title=Prosumption: Evolution, revolution, or eternal return of the same?|journal=Journal of Consumer Culture|year=2014|volume=14|issue=1|url=http://joc.sagepub.com/content/14/1/3|accessdate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collaborative consumption stands in sharp contrast with the notion of conventional consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Belk|first=Russell|title=You are what you can access: Sharing and collaborative consumption online|journal=Journal of Business Research|year=2014|volume=67|url=http://collaborativeeconomy.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Belk-R.2014.-You-are-what-you-can-access-Sharing-and-collaborative-consumption-online.Journal-of-Business-Research.pdf|accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conventional consumption involves passive consumers who cannot or are not given the capacity to provide any resource or service. In contrast, collaborative consumption involves not mere "consumers" but "obtainers", who do not only "obtain" but also "provide" resources to others (e.g. consumers, [[organization]]s, [[government]]s).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; Overall, consumers' capacity to switch roles from "provider" to "obtainer" and from "obtainer" to "provider", in a given resource distribution system, constitutes the key distinguishing criteria between conventional consumption and collaborative consumption.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

The sharing economy is built on the sharing of underused assets, both tangible and intangible. If people start sharing these underused resources or services, this will decrease not only our physical waste, but also our waste of resources.

There are broadly two forms of collaborative consumption:
(1) '''Mutualization''' or access systems: resource distribution systems in which individuals may provide and obtain temporary access to resources, either free or for a fee.&lt;ref name="arnould1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arnould|first=Eric J.|last2=Rose|first2=Alexanders S.|date=2016 |title=Mutuality: Critique and substitute for Belk's "sharing"|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/45414623/Arnould_Rose_2015.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ56TQJRTWSMTNPEA&amp;Expires=1467004604&amp;Signature=oUyfr7Tl%2FZGj4o2PCLSkBdfJPRw%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DMutuality_Critique_and_substitute_for_Be.pdf|journal=Marketing Theory|volume=16|issue=1}}{{dead link|date=September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marketer-managed access schemes (e.g. [[Car2Go]], [[Zipcar]], [[BIXI Montréal|Bixi]]) do not allow individuals to source resources,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bardhi|first=Fleura |last2=Eckhardt|first2=Giana M.|date=2012 |title=Access-based consumption: The case of car sharing|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|volume=39|doi=10.1086/666376}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lamberton|first=Cait Ponor |last2=Rose|first2=Randall L.|date=2012 |title=When is ours better than mine?

(2) '''Redistribution''' systems: resource distribution systems in which individuals may provide and obtain resources permanently, either free or for a fee.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Botsman|first=Rachel|last2=Rogers|first2=Roo|date=2010|title=What's mine is yours: The rise of collaborative consumption|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Focusing on redistribution systems only, the Canadian-based Kijiji Secondhand Economy Index of 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://secondhandeconomy.kijiji.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Kijiji-Index-Report-2016.pdf|title=The Kijiji Secondhand Economy Index 2016|accessdate=26 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510154329/http://secondhandeconomy.kijiji.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Kijiji-Index-Report-2016.pdf#|archive-date=10 May 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; estimated that about 85% of consumers acquired or disposed of pre-owned goods through [[second-hand]] marketplaces (secondhand purchase and resale), [[donation]], or [[barter]], through either online or offline exchange channels. According to the Kijiji Secondhand Economy Index of 2015, the Canadian second-hand market, alone, was estimated at 230 billion dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://secondhandeconomy.kijiji.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Kijiji-Index.pdf|title=The Kijiji Secondhand Economy Index 2015|accessdate=26 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920090404/http://secondhandeconomy.kijiji.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Kijiji-Index.pdf#|archive-date=20 September 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Besides, for-profit mutualization platforms, commonly referred to as "[[Sharing economy|Commercial Peer-to-peer Mutualization Systems]]" (CPMS) or, more colloquially, the sharing economy, represented a global market worth 15 billion dollars, in 2014; 29 billion dollars, in 2015; and are expected to reach 335 billion dollars by 2025.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pwc.com/us/en/technology/publications/assets/pwc-consumer-intelligence-series-the-sharing-economy.pdf|title=The Sharing Economy|accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rachel Botsman ===
Rachel Botsman, author of "What's Mine Is Yours: The Rise of Collaborative Consumption", and researcher of collaborative consumption defines collaborative consumption-also known as shared consumption-as "traditional sharing, bartering, lending, trading, renting, gifting, and swapping redefined through technology and peer communities."&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQa3kUJPEko|title="The Case For Collaborative Consumption."|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She states that we are reinventing "not just what we consume – but how we consume."&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt; Botsman uses the example of a power drill to make her case for collaborative consumption, stating how power drills are inherently underused since "what [is needed] is the hole, not the drill"&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt; and so instead we should share goods such as these. Cars cost at least 8000 dollars per year to run, even though they sit parked roughly 96 percent of the time.

Botsman defines the three systems that make up collaborative consumption. The first is distribution markets where services are used to match haves and wants so that personal unused assets can be redistributed to places where they will be put to better use. Collaborative lifestyles allow people to share resources like money, skills, and time, this is best explained as the sharing of intangible resources. Product service systems provide the benefits of a product without having to own it outright, instead of buying products that are used to fulfill specific purposes, they can be shared. These different systems are bringing about change in society, by providing new employment opportunities, including ways for people to earn money peer-to-peer, and decreasing the ecological impact on the environment.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt;

=== Consumer two-sided role ===
Collaborative consumption is challenging to business scholars and practitioners alike because, as a concept, it induces a two-sided consumer role which goes beyond the classic notion of a buyer/consumer, who typically has no input in the production or distribution process.&lt;ref name="ritzer3"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ritzer|first=George|date=2014|title=Prosumption: Evolution, revolution, or eternal return of the same?|url=http://joc.sagepub.com/content/14/1/3|journal=Journal of Consumer Culture|volume=14|page=3|issue=1|doi=10.1177/1469540513509641}}&lt;/ref&gt; Companies have traditionally sold products and services to consumers, they now start pulling on their resources too through [[co-creation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Prahalad|first=Coimbatore|last2=Ramaswamy|first2=Venkat|date=2004|title=Co-creation experiences: The next practice in value creation|url=https://wiki.aalto.fi/download/attachments/58076597/experiences.pdf|journal=Journal of Interactive Marketing|volume=18|issue=3|page=5|doi=10.1002/dir.20015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or prosumption.&lt;ref name="ritzer3"/&gt; According to Scaraboto, this means that individuals are able to "switch roles, engage in embedded entrepreneurship and collaborate to produce and access resources".&lt;ref name="scaraboto1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scaraboto|first=Daiane|date=2015|title=Selling, sharing, and everything in between: The hybrid economies of collaborative networks|url=http://jcr.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/05/28/jcr.ucv004|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|volume=42|issue=1|doi=10.1093/jcr/ucv004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collaborative consumption is characterized by consumers' capacity of being both "providers" and "obtainers"  of resources, in a given "resource circulation system". A collaborative consumption systems means therefore a resource circulation system in which the individual is not only a mere "consumer" but also an obtainer who has the opportunity to endorse, if wanted or needed, a "provider" role (e.g. [[Kijiji]], [[Craigslist]], [[eBay]]), as follows:&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

* '''Obtainer''' – The individual who seeks to obtain a resource or service that is provided directly by another consumer (i.e. the provider), or indirectly through the mediation of an organization known as the "mediator", which may be for-profit (e.g. [[IKEA]]'s used furniture sales) or not-for-profit (e.g. [[The Salvation Army]]);
* '''Provider''' – The individual who provides  a resource or service either directly, to a consumer (i.e. the obtainer), or indirectly, through a "mediator" (for-profit or not-for-profit).

Through CC, consumers invite themselves in the [[value creation]] process, not as formal [[worker]]s, [[employee]]s or [[Manufacturer|suppliers]], but as informal suppliers (i.e. providers), in order to successfully reconcile their personal interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ritzer|first=George|date=2014|title=Prosumption: Evolution, revolution, or eternal return of the same?|url=http://joc.sagepub.com/content/14/1/3|journal=Journal of Consumer Culture|volume=14|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, organizations tap into the sphere of private [[asset]]s and [[skill]]s, as formal organizations and not as [[family]], [[friend]]s, or acquaintances, to make profits or reach other objectives.&lt;ref name="ritzer2014"/&gt; The practices in which obtainers and providers may engage are therefore classified into:&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

* '''Obtainment''' – entails second-hand purchase, reception of donation, barter, temporary access to resources  free or for a compensation (excluding conventional consumption rentals), reconditioned/[[Refurbishment (electronics)|refurbished]] consumption, and to a lesser extent, recycled consumption;
* '''Provision''' – involves second-hand sale, donation, barter, provision of temporary access to resources free or in exchange of a compensation, [[trade in]] (i.e. with an organization), and to a lesser extent, recycling.

===Other actors===
Consumers may exchange resources and services directly with or without the support of an "intermediary", which is an entity that facilitates the exchange between obtainer and provider&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; (e.g. [[Kijiji]], [[The Freecycle Network|Freecycle]], [[Yerdle]]). Consumers set the terms and conditions of the exchange, and this refers to pure collaboration. There are also other types of third-parties which are more heavily involved in the consumer-to-consumer relationship. These are called "mediators". They determine the terms and conditions of the exchange between consumers and may typically take a predetermined proportion of the amount of value being exchanged.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; Examples include [[second-hand]] stores to which consumers may donate or resell goods that are then subsequently resold to other consumers. Some platforms such as [[Uber (company)|Uber]], [[Airbnb]], [[TaskRabbit]] or [[Lending Club]] are also included. The intervention of mediators in a peer-to-peer relationship signals sourcing collaboration and its corollary trading collaboration.

==Collaborative intensity==
Collaborative consumption can be best conceived in a perspective of "resource circulation system"&lt;ref name="arnould1"/&gt; incurring different levels of collaborative intensity, namely: '''(1) pure collaboration''' (C2C, or Consumer-to-Consumer); '''(2) sourcing collaboration''' (C2O, or Consumer-to-Organization); and (3) '''trading collaboration''' (O2C, or Organization-to-Consumer). The organization may be a for-profit or a not-for-profit:&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-

|-
| Presence of mediator || No || Yes || Yes
|}

===Pure collaboration===
* '''Pure collaboration'''&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; involves direct P2P exchanges, in which consumers directly exchange a specific resource or service. For example, on online platforms such as classified ads or auctions websites, consumers directly provide and obtain resources or services. Although these online platforms are intermediates they are not "mediators", because consumers are free to devise the terms and conditions of distribution and consumption of the resource or service together, whereas mediators interfere in the devising. In sum, mediators are intermediates but not all intermediates are necessarily mediators. For example, the Canadian-based [[Real-time ridesharing|ridesharing]] website Amigo Express does not allow obtainers ([[carpooling]] obtainers) and providers (carpooling providers) to get into contact to arrange the terms of the ride. Rather, each agent needs to separately contact and pay a fee to the website in order to, respectively, obtain and provide the service. Amigo Express is therefore an intermediate that is a mediator. Conversely, using TheCarpoolingNetwork enables consumers to arrange themselves the terms and conditions of the exchange and the website acts as a facilitator, not as a mediator. Most C2C websites are online platforms and operate on the [[freemium]] model, where the use of the website is free, but premium features must be paid for (e.g. [[Craigslist]]).&lt;ref name="scaraboto1"/&gt; Others have a donationware mode of exchange, whereby website use is free but financial donations are requested or accepted to offset production and maintenance costs (e.g. The Khan Academy).&lt;ref name="scaraboto1"/&gt;

===Sourcing collaboration===
* '''Sourcing collaboration'''&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; New technologies have sparked entrepreneurial creativity to develop new breeds of intermediates. They claim to challenge conventional [[business]], and they do so, because they operate business differently, without delivering or producing anything by themselves, but by capitalizing on the logics of [[crowdsourcing]] to do so. Sourcing collaboration therefore means that organizations do not provide a resource or deliver a service to consumers by themselves, but rely on providers (i.e. consumers) to perform any of both. They benefit from the [[Internet]] to mediate, at a cost and more efficiently, exchanges that would otherwise be authentically C2C exchanges. As an example, sourcing collaboration may refer to refurbished or reconditioned products, sold by conventional organizations, but provided by consumers (i.e. providers) who were, for some reason, dissatisfied with the products in question. Other examples include consumer provision of resources to antique dealers, consignment shops or [[Amazon.com|Amazon]]'s Fulfillment By Amazon (FBA) program. Similarly, online platforms which take a percentage off the transaction cost in supposedly C2C exchanges (e.g. [[Uber (company)|Uber]], [[Instacart]], [[TaskRabbit]], [[Airbnb]]), actually outsource the fulfillment of specific tasks or jobs to consumer A in order to efficiently redistribute those to consumer B. Also, a tangible resource may circulate across multiple organizations (intermediates) from the provider to the obtainer. For example, a car sold by a consumer to a professional car dealer may then be sold and resold by several other car dealers, before being eventually resold to a consumer. A Deloitte study found that people wasted an extra three minutes waiting for a taxi, with most Uber passengers picked up in about four and a half minutes as opposed to eight minutes with a taxi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Standing|first=Craig|last2=Standing|first2=Susan|last3=Biermann|first3=Sharon|date=2018-03-09|title=The implications of the sharing economy for transport|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1080%2F01441647.2018.1450307|journal=Transport Reviews|language=en|pages=1–17|doi=10.1080/01441647.2018.1450307|issn=0144-1647}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trading collaboration===
* '''Trading collaboration'''&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; is the symmetrical opposite of "sourcing collaboration", in that it refers to the obtainer who enjoys a resource mediated by an organization but originally provided by another consumer (i.e. provider) via sourcing collaboration. The obtainer thus benefits from a resource that has been originally sourced by a provider to a mediator. The mediator, in turn, offers the providers' resource to the obtainer, usually-but not exclusively- at a cost, which will be fully, partially or not at all returned to the original provider. In contrast to conventional consumption where the resource being enjoyed, even temporarily, originates from a company, trading collaboration presupposes that the resource enjoyed by the obtainer has originally been sourced by another consumer. For example, trading collaboration occurs when consumer B obtains a cheaper refurbished [[iPhone]] that has been traded in to Best Buy by consumer A. Or it occurs when consumer B enjoys the delivery of her groceries by consumer A, through the [[Instacart]] [[crowdsourcing]] application.

The '''Constantinian bronzes''' were a series of [[bronze]] [[coin]]s introduced in the [[Roman Empire]] in the middle of the [[4th century]]. The specific denominations are unclear and debated by historians and [[numismatist]]s. They are referred to as AE1, AE2, AE3, and AE4, with the former being the largest (near 27 mm) and the latter the smallest (averaging 15 mm) in diameter:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;" border="1"

! AE1 !! AE2 !! AE3 !! AE4
|-
|  over 25&amp;nbsp;mm || 21 – 25&amp;nbsp;mm  ||  17 – 21&amp;nbsp;mm ||  under 17&amp;nbsp;mm 
|}

In November 2013, the largest [[hoard]] of [[Constantine the Great|Constantinian]] bronze coins was discovered in [[Devon]], [[England]]. The [[Seaton Down Hoard]] consists of 22,000 coins, mostly Constantinian bronzes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sundaypost.com/that-s-life/memories/large-roman-coin-hoard-unearthed-1.597455 Large Roman coin hoard unearthed]&lt;/ref&gt;

They often are considered [[sacred]] accounts and can be found in nearly all known [[religion|religious traditions]].&lt;ref name="johnston"&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are all stories with a [[plot (narrative)|plot]] and [[character (arts)|characters]] who are either [[deity|deities]], human-like figures, or animals, who often speak and transform easily.&lt;ref&gt;''See:''

* {{harvnb|Encyclopædia Britannica|2009}}
* {{harvnb|Leeming|chapter="Creation"|2011a}}
* {{harvnb|Long|1963}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are often set in a dim and nonspecific past that historian of religion [[Mircea Eliade]] termed ''in illo tempore'' ("at that time").&lt;ref name="johnston"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eliade|1963|p=429}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creation myths address questions deeply meaningful to the society that shares them, revealing their central [[worldview]] and the framework for the self-identity of the culture and individual in a universal context.&lt;ref&gt;''See:''

Creation myths develop in [[oral tradition]]s and therefore typically have multiple versions;&lt;ref name="womack"/&gt; found throughout human [[culture]], they are the most common form of myth.&lt;ref name="kimball"&gt;{{harvnb|Kimball|2008}}{{page needed|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
Creation myth definitions from modern references:
* A "symbolic narrative of the beginning of the world as understood in a particular tradition and community. Creation myths are of central importance for the valuation of the world, for the orientation of humans in the universe, and for the basic patterns of life and culture."&lt;ref name="mwewr"&gt;{{harvnb|Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions |1999|p=267}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Creation myths tell us how things began. All cultures have creation myths; they are our primary myths, the first stage in what might be called the psychic life of the species. As cultures, we identify ourselves through the collective dreams we call creation myths, or cosmogonies. … Creation myths explain in metaphorical terms our sense of who we are in the context of the world, and in so doing they reveal our real priorities, as well as our real prejudices. Our images of creation say a great deal about who we are."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leeming|2010|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A "philosophical and theological elaboration of the primal myth of creation within a religious community. The term myth here refers to the imaginative expression in narrative form of what is experienced or apprehended as basic reality … The term creation refers to the beginning of things, whether by the will and act of a transcendent being, by emanation from some ultimate source, or in any other way."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/142144/creation-myth creation myth], ''Enyclopædia Britannica'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Religion professor [[Mircea Eliade]] defined the word ''myth'' in terms of creation: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Myth narrates a sacred history; it relates an event that took place in primordial Time, the fabled time of the "beginnings." In other words, myth tells how, through the deeds of Supernatural Beings, a reality came into existence, be it the whole of reality, the Cosmos, or only a fragment of reality – an island, a species of plant, a particular kind of human behavior, an institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eliade|1964|pp=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Meaning and function==
[[File:Ba-Gua animated.gif|thumb|left|upright|In [[Chinese creation myth|Daoist creation myth]], "The Way gave birth to unity; unity gave birth to duality; duality gave birth to trinity; trinity gave birth to the myriad creatures." (''[[Daodejing]]'', 4th century BCE)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mair|1990|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
All creation myths are in one sense [[etiological]] because they attempt to explain how the world was formed and where humanity came from.&lt;ref name="Leeming 2005"/&gt; Myths attempt to explain the unknown and sometimes teach a lesson.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushistory.org/civ/5c.asp Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes]. ''Ancient Civilizations''. US History.org &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.cocc.edu/cagatucci/classes/hum211/CoursePack/culture.htm Culture, Religion, &amp; Myth: Interdisciplinary Approaches]. Cora Agatucci. Central Oregon Community College.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnologists and anthropologists{{which|date=December 2013}} who study these myths say that in the modern context theologians try to discern humanity's meaning from [[revelation|revealed truth]]s and scientists investigate [[cosmology]] with the tools of [[empiricism]] and [[rationality]], but creation myths define human reality in very different terms.  In the past historians of religion and other students of myth thought of them as forms of [[Primitive culture|primitive]] or early-stage science or religion and analyzed them in a [[wikt:literal|literal]] or logical sense.  Today, however, they are seen as symbolic narratives which must be understood in terms of their own cultural context. Charles Long writes, "The beings referred to in the myth – gods, animals, plants – are forms of power grasped existentially. The myths should not be understood as attempts to work out a rational explanation of deity."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Long|1963|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While creation myths are not literal [[explication]]s they do serve to define an orientation of humanity in the world in terms of a birth story. They are the basis of a worldview that reaffirms and guides how people relate to the natural world, to any assumed spiritual world, and to each other. The creation myth acts as a cornerstone for distinguishing primary reality from relative reality, the origin and nature of [[being]] from non-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sproul|1979|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense they serve as a [[meaning of life|philosophy of life]] but one expressed and conveyed through [[Symbolic anthropology|symbol]] rather than systematic reason. And in this sense they go beyond [[Etiological myth#Mythology|etiological myth]]s which mean to explain specific features in religious rites, natural phenomena or cultural life. Creation myths also help to orient human beings in the world, giving them a sense of their place in the world and the regard that they must have for humans and nature.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

Historian [[David Christian (historian)|David Christian]] has summarised issues common to multiple creation myths:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Each beginning seems to presuppose an earlier beginning. ... Instead of meeting a single starting point, we encounter an infinity of them, each of which poses the same problem. ... There are no entirely satisfactory solutions to this dilemma. What we have to find is not a solution but some way of dealing with the mystery .... And we have to do so using words. The words we reach for, from ''God'' to ''gravity'', are inadequate to the task. So we have to use language poetically or symbolically; and such language, whether used by a scientist, a poet, or a shaman, can easily be misunderstood.&lt;ref&gt;

==Classification==
{{See also|List of creation myths}}
[[File:Mayan - Dwarf Figurine - Walters 20092036 - View A.jpg|thumb|upright|In [[Maya religion]], the [[dwarfism|dwarf]] was an embodiment of the [[Maya maize god|Maize God]]'s [[Maya religion#Goblins and dwarfs|helpers]] at [[Maya maize god#Cosmological creation myth|creation]].&lt;ref&gt;[[commons:File:Mayan - Dwarf Figurine - Walters 20092036 - View A.jpg|Description]] from [[Walters Art Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Mythologist]]s have applied various schemes to classify creation myths found throughout human cultures.  Eliade and his colleague Charles Long developed a classification based on some common [[Motif (literature)|motifs]] that reappear in stories the world over. The classification identifies five basic types:&lt;ref name="lm3233"&gt;{{harvnb|Leonard|McClure|2004|page=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Shesh shaiya Vishnu.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Brahma|Brahmā]], the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] ''[[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]]'' of creation, emerges from a [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]] risen from the navel of [[Vishnu|Viṣņu]], who lies with [[Lakshmi]] on the serpent [[Ananta Shesha]].]]

* Creation ''[[ex nihilo]]'' in which the creation is through the thought, word, dream or bodily secretions of a divine being.
* [[Earth diver]] creation in which a diver, usually a bird or amphibian sent by a creator, plunges to the seabed through a [[cosmic ocean|primordial ocean]] to bring up sand or mud which develops into a terrestrial world.
* Emergence myths in which progenitors pass through a series of worlds and metamorphoses until reaching the present world.
* Creation by the dismemberment of a primordial being.
* Creation by the splitting or ordering of a primordial unity such as the cracking of a [[cosmic egg]] or a bringing order from [[Chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]].

[[Marta Weigle]] further developed and refined this typology to highlight nine themes, adding elements such as ''deus faber'', a creation crafted by a deity, creation from the work of two creators working together or against each other, creation from sacrifice and creation from division/conjugation, accretion/conjunction, or secretion.&lt;ref name="lm3233"/&gt;

An alternative system based on six recurring narrative themes was designed by Raymond Van Over:&lt;ref name="lm3233"/&gt;
* Primeval [[Abyss (religion)|abyss]], an infinite expanse of waters or space.
* Originator deity which is awakened or an eternal entity within the abyss.
* Originator deity poised above the abyss.
* [[Cosmic egg]] or [[embryo]].
* Originator deity creating life through sound or word.
* Life generating from the corpse or dismembered parts of an originator deity.

===''Ex nihilo''===
{{main article|Ex nihilo}}
[[File:Hieronymus Bosch - The Garden of Earthly Delights - The exterior (shutters).jpg|thumb|upright|''Creation'' on the exterior shutters of [[Hieronymus Bosch]]'s [[triptych]] ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]'' (1480–90)]]

The idea that God created the world out of nothing – ''[[ex nihilo]]'' – is central today to Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and the medieval Jewish philosopher [[Maimonides]] felt it was the only concept that the three religions shared.{{sfn|Soskice|2010|p=24}} Nonetheless, the concept is not found in the entire Hebrew Bible.{{sfn|Nebe|2002|p=119}} The authors of Genesis 1 were concerned not with the origins of matter (the material which God formed into the habitable cosmos), but with assigning roles so that the Cosmos should function.{{sfn|Walton|2006|p=183}} In the early 2nd century AD, early Christian scholars were beginning to see a tension between the idea of world-formation and the omnipotence of God, and by the beginning of the 3rd century creation ''ex nihilo'' had become a fundamental tenet of Christian theology.{{sfn|May|2004|p=179}}

''Ex nihilo'' creation is found in creation stories from [[ancient Egypt]], the [[Rig Veda]], and many [[animism|animistic]] cultures in Africa, Asia, Oceania and North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leeming|2010|pages=1–3, 153}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Debate between sheep and grain]] is an example of an even earlier form of ''ex nihilo'' creation myth from ancient [[Sumer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wasilewska|2000|pages=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most of these stories the world is brought into being by the speech, dream, breath, or pure thought of a creator but creation ex nihilo may also take place through a creator's bodily secretions.

The literal translation of the phrase ''ex nihilo'' is "from nothing" but in many creation myths the line is blurred whether the creative act would be better classified as a creation ''ex nihilo'' or creation from chaos. In ''ex nihilo'' creation myths the potential and the substance of creation springs from within the creator. Such a creator may or may not be existing in physical surroundings such as darkness or water, but does not create the world from them, whereas in creation from chaos the substance used for creation is pre-existing within the unformed void.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leeming|Leeming|1994|pages=60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creation from chaos===
{{main article|Chaos (cosmogony)}}
In creation from chaos myth, initially there is nothing but a formless, shapeless expanse.  In these stories the word "chaos" means "disorder", and this formless expanse, which is also sometimes called a void or an abyss, contains the material with which the created world will be made.  Chaos may be described as having the consistency of vapor or water, dimensionless, and sometimes salty or muddy.  These myths associate chaos with evil and oblivion, in contrast to "order" (''cosmos'') which is the good.  The act of creation is the bringing of order from disorder, and in many of these cultures it is believed that at some point the forces preserving order and form will weaken and the world will once again be engulfed into the abyss.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leeming|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example is the [[Genesis creation narrative|Genesis creation myth]] from the first chapter of the [[Book of Genesis]].

===World parent===
[[Image:WahineTane.jpg|right|thumb|upright|In one [[Māori mythology|Maori creation myth]], the primal couple are [[Rangi and Papa]], depicted holding each other in a tight embrace.]]
There are two types of world parent myths, both describing a separation or splitting of a primeval entity, the world parent or parents.  One form describes the primeval state as an eternal union of two parents, and the creation takes place when the two are pulled apart.  The two parents are commonly identified as Sky (usually male) and Earth (usually female) who in the primeval state were so tightly bound to each other that no offspring could emerge.  These myths often depict creation as the result of a sexual union, and serve as genealogical record of the deities born from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leeming|2010|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second form of world parent myth, creation itself springs from dismembered parts of the body of the primeval being.  Often in these stories the limbs, hair, blood, bones or organs of the primeval being are somehow severed or sacrificed to transform into sky, earth, animal or plant life, and other worldly features. These myths tend to emphasize creative forces as animistic in nature rather than sexual, and depict the sacred as the elemental and integral component of the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leeming|2010|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example of this is the [[Norse mythology|Norse]] creation myth described in ''[[Gylfaginning]]'' exactly in the poem [[Völuspá]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9I62BcuPxfYC&amp;pg=PA209&amp;lpg=PA209&amp;dq=creation+myth+in+voluspa#v=onepage&amp;q=creation%20myth%20in%20voluspa&amp;f=false|title=Creation Myths of the World: An Encyclopedia|last=Leeming|first=David Adams|date=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781598841749|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emergence===
In emergence myths humanity emerges from another world into the one they currently inhabit. The previous world is often considered the womb of the [[earth mother]], and the process of emergence is likened to the act of giving birth.  The role of midwife is usually played by a female deity, like the spider woman of several mythologies of Indigenous peoples in the Americas.  Male characters rarely figure into these stories, and scholars often consider them in counterpoint to male-oriented creation myths, like those of the ''ex nihilo'' variety.&lt;ref name="Leeming 2005"&gt;{{harvnb|Leeming|chapter="Creation"|2011a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Image-sipapu.JPG|thumb|upright|left|In the [[kiva]] of both [[Ancient Pueblo Peoples|ancient]] and present-day [[Pueblo people]]s, the [[sipapu]] is a small round hole in the floor that represents the portal through which the ancestors [[Hopi mythology#Four Worlds|first emerged]]. (The larger hole is a fire pit, here in a ruin from the [[Mesa Verde National Park]].)]]
Emergence myths commonly describe the creation of people and/or supernatural beings as a staged ascent or [[metamorphosis]] from nascent forms through a series of subterranean worlds to arrive at their current place and form.  Often the passage from one world or stage to the next is impelled by inner forces, a process of germination or gestation from earlier, embryonic forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leeming|2010|pages=21–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Long|1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The genre is most commonly found in Native American cultures where the myths frequently link the final emergence of people from a hole opening to the underworld to stories about their subsequent migrations and eventual settlement in their current homelands.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheeler-Voegelin|Moore|1957|pages=66–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earth-diver===
The earth-diver is a common character in various traditional creation myths. In these stories a supreme being usually sends an animal into the primal waters to find bits of sand or mud with which to build habitable land. Some scholars interpret these myths psychologically while others interpret them [[Cosmogony|cosmogonically]]. In both cases emphasis is placed on beginnings emanating from the depths.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leeming|chapter="Earth-Diver Creation"|2011b}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earth-diver myths are common in [[Native American mythology|Native American folklore]] but can be found among the [[Chukchi people|Chukchi]] and [[Yukaghir]], the [[Tatars]] and many [[Uralic mythologies|Finno-Ugrian]] traditions. The pattern of distribution of these stories suggest they have a common origin in the [[Geography of Asia#East Asia|eastern Asiatic]] coastal region, spreading as peoples migrated west into [[Siberia]] and east to the [[North America]]n continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Booth|1984|pages=168–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Napolskikh]] (2012), ''[https://www.academia.edu/4918926/Diving_Bird_Myth_after_20_years_2012 Earth-Diver Myth (А812) in northern Eurasia and North America: twenty years later]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Characteristic of many Native American myths, earth-diver creation stories begin as beings and potential forms linger asleep or suspended in the primordial realm. The earth-diver is among the first of them to awaken and lay the necessary groundwork by building suitable lands where the coming creation will be able to live. In many cases, these stories will describe a series of failed attempts to make land before the solution is found.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leonard|McClure|2004|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cultural bias''' is the phenomenon of interpreting and judging phenomena by standards inherent to one's own culture. The phenomenon is sometimes considered a problem central to social and human sciences, such as [[economics]], [[psychology]], [[anthropology]], and [[sociology]]. Some practitioners of the aforementioned fields have attempted to develop methods and theories to compensate for or eliminate cultural bias.

Cultural bias occurs when people of a culture make assumptions about conventions, including conventions of language, notation, proof and evidence. They are then accused of mistaking these assumptions for laws of logic or nature. Numerous such biases exist, concerning cultural norms for color, mate selection, concepts of justice, [[linguistics|linguistic]] and logical validity, the acceptability of evidence, and taboos.

==Cultural bias by discipline==
=== Psychology ===
Cultural bias has no a priori definition. Instead, its presence is inferred from differential performance of socioracial (e.g., [[Black people|Blacks]], [[Whites]]), ethnic (e.g., [[Latino]]s/Latinas, [[English people|Anglos]]), or national groups (e.g., U.S. [[Americans]], [[Japanese people|Japanese]]) on measures of psychological constructs such as cognitive abilities, knowledge or skills (CAKS), or symptoms of psychopathology (e.g., depression). Historically, the term grew out of efforts to explain between‐group score differences on CAKS tests primarily of [[African American]] and Latino/Latina American test takers relative to their [[White American]] counterparts and concerns that test scores should not be interpreted in the same manner across these groups. Although the concept of cultural bias in testing and assessment also pertains to score differences and potential misdiagnoses with respect to a broader range of psychological concepts, particularly in applied psychology and other social and behavioral sciences, this aspect of cultural bias has received less attention in the relevant literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/9780470479216.corpsy0244|title=Cultural Bias in Psychological Testing|last=Helms|first=Janet|editor1-last=Weiner|editor1-first=I. B.|editor2-last=Craighead|editor2-first=W. E.|date=January 30, 2010|encyclopedia=The Corsini Encyclopedia of Psychology|publisher=Wiley Online Library, American Cancer Society|accessdate=April 19, 2018|doi=10.1002/9780470479216.corpsy0244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural bias in [[psychological testing]] refers to the standardized psychological tests that are conducted to determine the level of intelligence among the test-takers. Limitations of such verbal or non-verbal intelligence tests have been observed since their introduction. However, the limitations they put forth, due to their particular culture-friendliness, has been realized much later. Many tests have been objected to, as they produced poor results for the ethnic or racial minorities (students), as compared to the racial majorities. The problem lies not with the test-taker, but with the test itself. As discussed above, the learning environment, the questions posed or situations given in the test may be familiar and strange at the same time to students from different backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://psychologenie.com/understanding-cultural-bias-with-examples.|title=Understanding the Phenomena of Cultural Bias With Examples|last=PsycholoGenie|first=|date=|website=psychologenie.com|access-date=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economics===
Cultural bias in economic exchange is often overlooked. A study done at the [[Northwestern University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Guiso |first=Luigi |last2=Sapienza |first2=Paola |date=October 2008 |title=Cultural Bias in Economic Exchange? |url=http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/sapienza/htm/cultural_biases.pdf |journal=Forthcoming: Quarterly Journal of Economics |access-date=April 22, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the cultural perception that two countries have of each other plays a large factor in the economic activity between them. This study suggests that low bilaterial trust between two countries will result in less trade, less [[portfolio investment]], and less [[direct investment]]. This effect is amplified for goods, as they are more trust intensive.

===Anthropology===
The concept of [[culture theory]] in anthropology explains that cultural bias is a critical piece of human group formation.

===Sociology===
It is thought that societies with conflicting beliefs will more likely have cultural bias as it is dependent on the group's standing in society, where the [[social construction]]s affect how a problem is produced. One example of cultural bias within the context of sociology can be seen in a study done at the [[University of California]] by Jane R. Mercer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mercer|first1=Jane R. |title=Test "validity", "bias", and "fairness": An analysis from the perspective of the sociology of knowledge|journal=Interchange|date=March 1978|volume=9|issue=1|pages=1–16|doi=10.1007/BF01807733|url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF01807733.pdf|accessdate=April 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; of how test "validity", "bias", and "fairness" in different cultural belief systems affect one's future in a [[Cultural pluralism|pluralistic]] society. A definition of the cultural bias was given as "the extent that the test contains cultural content that is generally peculiar to the members of one group but not to the members of another group", which leads to a belief that "the internal structure of the test will differ for different cultural groups". In addition, the different types of errors made on culture-biased tests are dependent on different cultural groups. This idea progressed to the conclusion that a non-cultural-test will represent the ability of a population as intended and will not reflect the abilities of a group that is not represented.

===History===
Cultural bias may also arise in historical scholarship, when the standards, assumptions and conventions of the historian's own era are [[anachronism|anachronistically]] used to report and assess events of the past. This tendency is sometimes known as [[Presentism (literary and historical analysis)|presentism]], and is regarded by many historians as a fault to be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=David H. |last=Fischer |authorlink=David Hackett Fischer |title=Historians' Fallacies: toward a logic of historical thought |location=New York |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |year=1970 |isbn=0061315451 |pages=137–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Marwick]] has argued that "a grasp of the fact that past societies are very different from our own, and ... very difficult to get to know" is an essential and fundamental skill of the professional historian; and that "anachronism is still one of the most obvious faults when the unqualified (those expert in other disciplines, perhaps) attempt to do history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Arthur |last=Marwick |authorlink=Arthur Marwick |title=The New Nature of History: knowledge, evidence, language |place=Basingstoke |publisher=Palgrave |year=2001 |isbn=0-333-96447-0 |page=63 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6597">'''Culture change''' is a term used in [[public policy]] making that emphasizes the influence of [[cultural capital]] on individual and community behavior. It has been sometimes called repositioning of culture,&lt;Ref&gt;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13668803.2014.981506&lt;/ref&gt; which means the reconstruction of the cultural concept of a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chigbu|first1=Uchendu Eugene|title=Repositioning culture for development: women and development in a Nigerian rural community|journal=Community, Work &amp; Family|date=2015|volume=18|issue=3|pages=334–350|doi=10.1080/13668803.2014.981506|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13668803.2014.981506}}&lt;/ref&gt; It places stress on the social and cultural capital determinants of decision making and the manner in which these interact with other factors like the availability of information or the financial incentives facing individuals to drive behavior.
[[Image:culture change model.jpg|thumb|Model of culture change]] 

These cultural capital influences include the role of parenting, families and close associates; organizations such as schools and workplaces; communities and neighborhoods; and wider social influences such as the media. It is argued that this cultural capital manifests into specific values, attitudes or social norms which in turn guide the behavioral ''intentions'' that individuals adopt in regard to particular decisions or courses of action. These behavioral intentions interact with other factors driving behavior such as financial incentives, regulation and legislation, or levels of information, to drive actual behavior and ultimately feed back into underlying cultural capital.

In general, cultural stereotypes present great resistance to change and to their own redefinition. Culture, often appears fixed to the observer at any one point in time because cultural mutations occur incrementally.&lt;ref&gt;P.E. Petrakis, P.C. Kostis (2013) “[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053535713000218#! Economic Growth and Cultural Change]”, Journal of Socio-Economics, Issue C, Vol. 47, pp. 147-157, DOI 10.1016/j.socec.2013.02.011.&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural change is a long-term process. Policymakers need to make a great effort to improve some basics aspects of a society’s cultural traits.

==Achieving culture change==
The term is used by Knott et al. of the [[Prime Minister's Strategy Unit]] in the publication: ''[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100125070726/http://cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/cabinetoffice/strategy/assets/achieving_culture_change.pdf Achieving Culture Change: A Policy Framework]'' (Knott et al., 2008). The paper sets out how public policy can achieve social and cultural change through 'downstream' interventions including fiscal incentives, legislation, regulation and information provision and also 'upstream' interventions such as parenting, peer and mentoring programs, or development of social and community networks.

The key concepts the paper is based on include:

* ''Cultural capital'' - such as the attitudes, values, aspirations and sense of self-efficacy which influence behavior. Cultural capital is itself influenced by behavior over time
* The shifting ''social zeitgeist'' - whereby social norms and values that predominate within the cultural capital in society evolve in over time
* The process by which political narrative and new ideas and innovations shift the social zeitgeist over time within the constraint of the 'elastic band' of public opinion
* The process of ''behavioral normalization'' - whereby behavior and actions pass through into social and cultural norms (for example, Knott et al. argue that the UK experience of seat belt enforcement established and reinforced this as a social norm)
* The use of [[customer insight]]
* The importance of tailoring policy programmes around an ecological model of human behavior to account for how policy will interact with cultural capital and affect it over time

Knott et al. use examples from a range of policy areas to demonstrate how the culture change framework can be applied to policymaking. For example:

* To encourage educational aspiration they recommend more use of early years and parenting interventions, an improved childhood offer, and development of positive narratives on education as well as integrated advisory systems, financial assistance and targeted social marketing approaches.
* To promote healthy living and personal responsibility they recommend building healthy living into community infrastructure, building partnerships with schools and employers, more one-to-one support for wellbeing alongside use of regulation and legislation on unhealthy products, provision of robust health information and health marketing to promote adaptive forms of behaviour.
* To develop environmentally sustainable norms they recommend reinforcing sustainability throughout policy narratives, using schools and the voluntary sector to promote environmental messages, development of infrastructure that make sustainable choices easy, together with a wider package of measures on fiscal incentives, regulation, advisory services and coalition movements.

In [[education]], a '''curriculum''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|r|ɪ|k|j|ʊ|l|ə|m}}; plural: '''curricula''' {{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|r|ɪ|k|j|ʊ|l|ə}} or '''curriculums''') is broadly defined as the totality of student experiences that occur in the educational process.{{sfn|Kelly|2009|p=13}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Leading Curriculum Development|first=Jon |last=Wiles | year=2008| ref=harv |isbn=9781412961417| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rX--P1YUgI0C&amp;pg=PA2&amp; |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term often refers specifically to a planned sequence of instruction, or to a view of the student's experiences in terms of the educator's or school's instructional goals. In a 2003 study Reys, Reys, Lapan, Holliday and Wasman refer to  curriculum as a set of learning goals articulated across grades that outline the intended mathematics content and process goals at particular points in time throughout the K–12 school program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reys|first1=Robert|last2=Reys|first2=Barbara|last3=Lapan|first3=Richard|last4=Holliday|first4=Gregory|last5=Wasman|first5=Deanna|title=Assessing the Impact of Standards-Based Middle Grades Mathematics Curriculum Materials on Student Achievement|journal=Journal for Research in Mathematics Education|date=2003|pages=74–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Curriculum may incorporate the planned interaction of pupils with instructional content, materials, resources, and processes for evaluating the attainment of educational objectives.&lt;ref name="adams"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OSdCOlR2Ad0C&amp;pg=PA31|title=Urban Education: A Reference Handbook|first=Kathy L.|last=Adams|author2=Adams, Dale E.|year=2003|isbn=9781576073629|pages=31–32|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Curriculum is split into several categories, the explicit, the implicit (including the hidden), the excluded and the extra-curricular.&lt;ref name="Kelly, A.

Curricula may be tightly standardized, or may include a high level of instructor or learner autonomy.{{sfn|Adams|2003|pp=33–34}}  Many countries have national curricula in [[primary education|primary]] and [[secondary education]], such as the United Kingdom's [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]].

[[UNESCO]]'s [[International Bureau of Education]] has the primary mission of studying curricula and their implementation worldwide.

== Etymology ==
[[File:Petrus Ramus Tabula Artium 1576.jpg|thumb|First published use of "curriculum" in 1576.]]
The word "curriculum" began as a [[Latin]] word which means "a race" or "the course of a race" (which in turn derives from the verb ''currere'' meaning "to run/to proceed").&lt;ref name="oed"&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', "Curriculum," 152&lt;/ref&gt;  The first known use in an educational context is in the ''Professio Regia'', a work by [[University of Paris]] professor [[Petrus Ramus]] published posthumously in 1576.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wZTcAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA55|page=55|title=Towards a Theory of Schooling|first=David|last=Hamilton|isbn=9780415857086|year=2014|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term subsequently appears in [[University of Leiden]] records in 1582.{{sfn|Hamilton|2014|p=7}} The word's origins appear closely linked to the [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] desire to bring greater order to education.{{sfn|Hamilton|2014|p=47}}

By the seventeenth century, the [[University of Glasgow]] also referred to its "course" of study as a "curriculum", producing the first known use of the term in English in 1633.&lt;ref name="oed"/&gt; By the nineteenth century, European universities routinely referred to their curriculum to describe both the complete course of study (as for a degree in surgery) and particular courses and their content.

==Definitions and interpretations==
{{section too long|date=July 2016}}
There is no generally agreed upon definition of curriculum.{{sfn|Wiles|2008|p=2}}  Some influential definitions combine various elements to describe curriculum as follows:
*Kerr defines curriculum as, "All the learning which is planned and guided by the school, whether it is carried on in groups or individually, inside or outside of school." &lt;ref name="Kelly, A. V. 2009 pp. 1–55"/&gt;
*Braslavsky states that curriculum is an agreement among communities, educational professionals, and the State on what learners should take on during specific periods of their lives. Furthermore, the curriculum defines "why, what, when, where, how, and with whom to learn." &lt;ref name="Braslavsky, C. 2003"/&gt;
* Outlines the skills, performances, attitudes, and values pupils are expected to learn from schooling. It includes statements of desired pupil outcomes, descriptions of materials, and the planned sequence that will be used to help pupils attain the outcomes.
* The total learning experience provided by a school. It includes the content of courses (the syllabus), the methods employed (strategies), and other aspects, like norms and values, which relate to the way the school is organized.
* The aggregate of courses of study given in a learning environment. The courses are arranged in a sequence to make learning a subject easier. In schools, a curriculum spans several grades.
* Curriculum can refer to the entire program provided by a classroom, school, district, state, or country. A classroom is assigned sections of the curriculum as defined by the school.
* Through the readings of Smith,&lt;ref name="smithmk"&gt;Smith, M. K. (1996, 2000) ‘Curriculum theory and practice’ the encyclopedia of informal education, www.infed.org/biblio/b-curric.htm.
&lt;/ref&gt; Dewey,&lt;ref name="deweychild"&gt;{{Cite book|first=John|last=Dewey|authorlink=John Dewey|title=The child and the curriculum|year=1902|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29259}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Kelly,{{sfn|Kelly|2009}} four curriculums could be defined as:
*Explicit curriculum: subjects that will be taught, the identified "mission" of the school, and the knowledge and skills that the school expects successful students to acquire.
*Implicit curriculum: lessons that arise from the culture of the school and the behaviors, attitudes, and expectations that characterize that culture, the unintended curriculum.
*Hidden curriculum: things which students learn, ‘because of the way in which the work of the school is planned and organized but which are not in themselves overtly included in the planning or even in the consciousness of those responsible for the school arrangements (Kelly, 2009).  The term itself is attributed to Philip W. Jackson and is not always meant to be a negative.  Hidden curriculum, if its potential is realized, could benefit students and learners in all educational systems.  Also, it does not just include the physical environment of the school, but the relationships formed or not formed between students and other students or even students and teachers (Jackson, 1986&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jackson|first1=Philip|title=Life in Classrooms|date=1986|publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston|location=New York|isbn=0-8077-3034-3|pages=33–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  
*Excluded curriculum: topics or perspectives that are specifically excluded from the curriculum.
*Extracurricular: May include school-sponsored programs, which are intended to supplement the academic aspect of the school experience, or community-based programs and activities.  Examples of school-sponsored extracurricular programs include sports, academic clubs, and performing arts. Community-based programs and activities may take place at a school (after hours) but are not linked directly to the school. Community-based programs frequently expand on the curriculum that was introduced in the classroom. For instance, students may be introduced to environmental conservation in the classroom. This knowledge is further developed through a community-based program.  Participants then act on what they know with a conservation project. Community-based extracurricular activities may include “environmental clubs, 4-H, boy/girl scouts, and religious groups” (Hancock, Dyk, &amp; Jones, 2012).&lt;ref&gt;Hancock, D., Dyk, P. H., &amp; Jones, K. (2012). Adolescent Involvement in Extracurricular Activities. Journal of Leadership Education, 11(1), 84–101.&lt;/ref&gt;
Curriculum can be ordered into a procedure:&lt;ref name="smithmk"/&gt;
:Step 1: Diagnosis of needs.
:Step 2: Formulation of objectives.
:Step 3: Selection of content.
:Step 4: Organization of content.
:Step 5: Selection of learning experiences.
:Step 6: Organization of learning experiences.
:Step 7: Determination of what to evaluate and of the ways and means of doing it.

Under some definitions, curriculum is prescriptive, and is based on a more general [[syllabus]] which merely specifies what topics must be understood and to what level to achieve a particular grade or standard. The word Syllabus originates from Greek. The Greek meaning of the word basically means a "concise statement or table of the heads of a discourse, the contents of a treatise, the subjects of series of lectures.&lt;ref name="Kelly, A. V. 2009 pp. 1–55"/&gt;

'Curriculum' has numerous definitions, which can be slightly confusing. In its broadest sense a curriculum may refer to all courses offered at a school, explicit. The intended curriculum, which the students learn through the culture of the school, implicit. The curriculum that is specifically excluded, like racism. Plus, the extra curricular activities like sports, and clubs. This is particularly true of schools at the university level, where the diversity of a curriculum might be an attractive point to a potential student.

A curriculum may also refer to a defined and prescribed course of studies, which students must fulfill in order to pass a certain level of education. For example, an elementary school might discuss how its curriculum, or its entire sum of lessons and teachings, is designed to improve national testing scores or help students learn the basics. An individual teacher might also refer to his or her curriculum, meaning all the subjects that will be taught during a school year.

On the other hand, a high school might refer to a curriculum as the courses required in order to receive one’s diploma. They might also refer to curriculum in exactly the same way as the elementary school, and use curriculum to mean both individual courses needed to pass, and the overall offering of courses, which help prepare a student for life after high school.

Curriculum can be envisaged from different perspectives. What societies envisage as important teaching and learning constitutes the  "intended" curriculum.{{sfn|Kelly|2009}} Since it is usually presented in official documents, it may be also called the "written" and/or "official" curriculum.{{sfn|Kelly|2009}} However, at classroom level this intended curriculum may be altered through a range of complex classroom interactions, and what is actually delivered can be considered the "implemented" curriculum.{{sfn|Kelly|2009}} What learners really learn (i.e. what can be assessed and can be demonstrated as learning outcomes/learner competencies) constitutes the "achieved" or "learned" curriculum.{{sfn|Kelly|2009}} In addition, curriculum theory points to a "hidden" curriculum (i.e. the unintended development of personal values and beliefs of learners, teachers and communities; unexpected impact of a curriculum; unforeseen aspects of a learning process).{{sfn|Kelly|2009}} Those who develop the intended curriculum should have all these different dimensions of the curriculum in view.{{sfn|Kelly|2009}} While the "written" curriculum does not exhaust the meaning of curriculum, it is important because it represents the vision of the society.{{sfn|Kelly|2009}} The "written" curriculum is usually expressed in comprehensive and user-friendly documents, such as curriculum frameworks; subject curricula/syllabuses, and in relevant and helpful learning materials, such as textbooks; teacher guides; assessment guides.{{sfn|Kelly|2009}}

In some cases, people see the curriculum entirely in terms of the subjects that are taught, and as set out within the set of textbooks, and forget the wider goals of competencies and personal development.&lt;ref name="deweychild"/&gt; This is why a curriculum framework is important. It sets the subjects within this wider context, and shows how learning experiences within the subjects need to contribute to the attainment of the wider goals.&lt;ref name="deweychild"/&gt;

There are many common misconceptions of what curriculum is and one of the most common is that curriculum only entails a syllabus.  Smith (1996,2000) says that, "A syllabus will not generally indicate the relative importance of its topics or the order in which they are to be studied.  Where people still equate curriculum with a syllabus they are likely to limit their planning to a consideration of the content or the body of knowledge that they wish to transmit". 
Regardless of the definition of curriculum, one thing is certain.  The quality of any educational experience will always depend to a large extent on the individual teacher responsible for it (Kelly, 2009).

Curriculum is almost always defined with relation to schooling.&lt;ref name="smithmk"/&gt; According to some, it is the major division between formal and informal education.&lt;ref name="smithmk"/&gt; However, under some circumstances it may also be applied to informal education or free-choice learning settings. For instance, a science museum may have a "curriculum" of what topics or exhibits it wishes to cover. Many after-school programs in the US have tried to apply the concept; this typically has more success when not rigidly clinging to the definition of curriculum as a product or as a body of knowledge to be transferred. Rather, informal education and free-choice learning settings are more suited to the model of curriculum as practice or praxis.

===Historical conception===
{{rquote|right|Action is response; it is adaptation, adjustment. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;mdash; John Dewey&lt;ref name="deweychild"/&gt;}}
In the early years of the 20th century, the traditional concepts held of the "curriculum is that it is a body of subjects or subject matter prepared by the teachers for the students to learn." It was synonymous to the "course of study" and "syllabus".

In ''The Curriculum'',&lt;ref&gt;Bobbitt, John Franklin. The Curriculum. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1918.&lt;/ref&gt; the first textbook published on the subject, in 1918, [[John Franklin Bobbitt]] said that curriculum, as an [[idea]], has its [[Root (linguistics)|roots]] in the [[Latin]] word for ''race-course'', explaining the curriculum as the course of deeds and experiences through which [[child]]ren become the [[adult]]s they should be, ''for success in adult [[society]]''. Furthermore, the curriculum encompasses the entire scope of formative deed and experience occurring in and out of school, and not only experiences occurring in [[school]]; experiences that are unplanned and undirected, and experiences intentionally directed for the purposeful formation of adult members of society. (cf. image at right.)

To Bobbitt, the curriculum is a [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] arena. Per his cultural presumptions and social definitions, his curricular formulation has two notable features: (i) that [[scientific]] experts would best be qualified to and justified in designing curricula based upon their expert [[knowledge]] of what qualities are desirable in adult members of society, and which experiences would generate said qualities; and (ii) curriculum defined as the deeds-experiences the student ''ought to have'' to become the adult he or she ''ought to become''.

Hence, he defined the curriculum as an ideal, rather than as the concrete [[reality]] of the deeds and experiences that form who and what people become.

Contemporary views of curriculum reject these features of Bobbitt's postulates, but retain the basis of curriculum as the course of experience(s) that forms human beings into persons. Personal formation via curricula is studied both at the personal and group levels, i.e. [[cultures]] and societies (e.g. professional formation, [[academic discipline]] via historical experience). The formation of a group is reciprocal, with the formation of its individual participants.

Although it formally appeared in Bobbitt's [[definition]], curriculum as a course of formative experience also pervades [[John Dewey]]'s work (who disagreed with Bobbitt on important matters). Although Bobbitt's and Dewey's idealistic understanding of "curriculum" is different from current, restricted uses of the word, curriculum writers and researchers generally share it as common, substantive understanding of curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Philip W. "Conceptions of Curriculum and Curriculum Specialists." In Handbook of Research on Curriculum: A Project of the American Educational Research Association, edited by Philip W. Jackson, 3–40. New York: Macmillan Pub. Co., 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pinar, William F., William M. Reynolds, Patrick Slattery, and Peter M. Taubman. Understanding Curriculum: An Introduction to the Study of Historical and Contemporary Curriculum Discourses. New York: Peter Lang, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Development does not mean just getting something out of the mind.&lt;ref name="deweychild"/&gt; It is a development of experience and into experience that is really wanted.&lt;ref name="deweychild"/&gt;

[[Robert M. Hutchins]], president of the [[University of Chicago]], regarded curriculum as "permanent studies" where the rules of grammar, rhetoric and logic and mathematics for basic education are emphasized. Basic education should emphasize 3 Rs and college education should be grounded on liberal education. On the other hand, [[Arthur Bestor]] as an essentialist, believes that the mission of the school should be intellectual training, hence curriculum should focus on the fundamental intellectual disciplines of grammar, literature and writing. It should also include mathematics, science, history and foreign language.

This definition leads us to the view of Joseph Schwab that discipline is the sole source of curriculum. Thus in our education system, curriculum is divided into chunks of knowledge we call subject areas in basic education such as English, Mathematics, Science, Social Studies and others. In college, discipline may include humanities, sciences, languages and many more. Curriculum should consist entirely of knowledge which comes from various disciplines.To learn the lesson is more interesting than to take a scolding, be held up to general ridicule, stay after school, receive degrading low marks, or fail to be promoted.&lt;ref name="deweychild"/&gt;

Thus, curriculum can be viewed as a field of study. It is made up of its foundations (philosophical, historical, psychological, and social foundations); domains of knowledge as well as its research theories and principles. Curriculum is taken as scholarly and theoretical. It is concerned with broad historical, philosophical and social issues and academics. Under a starting definition offered by John Kerr and taken up by Vic Kelly in his standard work on the curriculum, curriculum is “all the learning which is planned and guided by the school, whether it is carried on in groups or individually, inside or outside the school.&lt;ref name="smithmk"/&gt;

Four ways of approaching curriculum theory and practice:&lt;ref name="smithmk"/&gt;
# Curriculum as a body of knowledge to be transmitted.&lt;ref name="smithmk"/&gt;
# Curriculum as an attempt to achieve certain ends in students – products.&lt;ref name="smithmk"/&gt;
# Curriculum as a process .&lt;ref name="smithmk"/&gt;
# Curriculum as praxis.&lt;ref name="smithmk"/&gt;

In recent years the field of education, and therefore curriculum, has expanded outside the walls of the classroom and into other settings such as [[museums]]. Within these settings curriculum is an even broader topic, including various teachers such as other visitors, inanimate objects such as audio tour devices, and even the learners themselves. As with the traditional idea of curriculum, curriculum in a free choice learning environment can consist of the explicit stated curriculum and the hidden curriculum, both of which contribute to the learner's experience and lessons from the experience.&lt;ref&gt;Museum Education as Curriculum: Four Models, Leading to a Fifth Elizabeth Vallance Studies in Art Education Vol. 45, No. 4 (Summer, 2004), pp. 343–358&lt;/ref&gt; These elements are further compounded by the setting, cultural influences, and the state of mind of the learner.&lt;ref&gt;Falk, J.H. &amp; Dierking, L.D. (2000). Learning from museums: Visitor experiences and the making of meaning. Walnut Creek, CA; AltaMira Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Museums and other similar settings are most commonly leveraged within traditional classroom settings as enhancements to the curriculum when educators develop curricula that encompass visits to museums, zoos, and aquariums.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, M., &amp; Dopico, E. (2014). Science education through informal education. Cultural Studies of Science Education, 1–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Progressivist views===

On the other hand, to a progressivist, a listing of school subjects, syllabi, course of study, and list of courses of specific discipline do not make a curriculum. These can only be called curriculum if the written materials are actualized by the learner. Broadly speaking, curriculum is defined as the total learning experiences of the individual. This definition is anchored on [[John Dewey]]'s definition of experience and education. He believed that reflective thinking is a means that unifies curricular elements. Thought is not derived from action but tested by application.

Caswell and Campbell viewed curriculum as "all experiences children have under the guidance of teachers." This definition is shared by Smith, Stanley and shores when they defined "curriculum as a sequence of potential experiences set up in schools for the purpose of disciplining children and youth in group ways of thinking and acting."

Curriculum as a process is when a teacher enters a particular schooling and situation with: an ability to think critically, in-action; an understanding of their role and the expectations others have of them; and a proposal for action which sets out essential principles and features of the educational encounter.&lt;ref name="smithmk"/&gt; Guided by these, they encourage conversations between, and with, people in the situation out of which may come a course of thinking and action.&lt;ref name="smithmk"/&gt; Plus, the teacher continually evaluates the process and what they can see of outcomes.&lt;ref name="smithmk"/&gt;

Marsh and Willis on the other hand view curriculum as all the "experiences in the classroom which are planned and enacted by teacher, and also learned by the students.&lt;ref&gt;Bilbao, Purita P., Lucido, Paz I., Iringan, Tomasa C., and Javier, Rodrigo B. (2008). Curriculum Development. Quezon City: Lorimar Publishing, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Any definition of curriculum, if it is to be practically effective and productive, must offer much more than a statement about knowledge-content or merely the subjects which schooling is to teach or transmit or deliver.{{sfn|Kelly|2009}} Some would argue of the course that the values implicit in the arrangements made by schools for their pupils are quite clearly in the consciousness of teachers and planners, again especially when the planners are politicians, and are equally clearly accepted by them as part of what pupils should learn in school, even though they are not overtly recognized by the pupils themselves.{{sfn|Kelly|2009}} In other words, those who design curricula deliberately plan the schools’ ‘expressive culture’. If this is the case, then, the curriculum is ‘hidden’ only to or from the pupils, and the values to be learnt clearly from a part of what is planned for pupils. They must, therefore, be accepted as fully a part of the curriculum, and most especially as an important focus for the kind of study of curriculum with which we are concerned here, not least because important questions must be asked concerning the legitimacy of such practices.{{sfn|Kelly|2009}}

Currently, a [[spiral curriculum]] is promoted as allowing students to revisit a subject matter's content at the different levels of development of the subject matter being studied. The [[constructivist teaching methods|constructivist]] approach proposes that children learn best via pro-active engagement with the educational environment, i.e. learning through discovery.

==Primary and secondary education==

A curriculum may be partly or entirely determined by an external, authoritative body (e.g., the [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum for England]] in [[England|English]] schools).

Crucial to the curriculum is the definition of the course objectives that usually are expressed as learning outcomes and normally include the program's [[assessment (education)|assessment]] strategy. These outcomes and assessments are grouped as units (or modules), and, therefore, the curriculum comprises a collection of such units, each, in turn, comprising a specialised, specific part of the curriculum. So, a typical curriculum includes communications, numeracy, information technology, and social skills units, with specific, specialized teaching of each.

Core curricula are often instituted, at the [[primary education|primary]] and [[secondary education|secondary]] levels, by school boards, Departments of Education, or other administrative agencies charged with overseeing education. A core curriculum is a curriculum, or course of study, which is deemed central and usually made mandatory for all students of a [[school]] or school system. However, even when core requirements exist, they do not necessarily involve a requirement for students to engage in one particular class or activity. For example, a school might mandate a music appreciation class, but students may opt out if they take a performing musical class, such as orchestra, band, chorus, etc.

=== Australia ===
In [[Australia]], the [[Australian Curriculum]] took effect nationwide in 2014,&lt;ref name="auscur"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/|title=Australian Curriculum|accessdate=2015-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; after a [[curriculum development]] process that began in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.qcaa.qld.edu.au/13636.html|title=Senior secondary Australian Curriculum|publisher=Queensland Curriculum &amp; Assessment Authority}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, each state's Education Department had traditionally established curricula. The Australian Curriculum consists of one curriculum covering eight subject areas through year 10, and another covering fifteen subjects for the [[senior secondary]] years.&lt;ref name="auscur" /&gt;

=== Canada ===
In [[Canada]] each [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province and territory]] has the authority to create its own curriculum. However, the [[Northwest Territories]] and [[Nunavut]] both choose to use the [[Alberta]] Curriculum for select parts of their curriculum. The territories also use [[Standardized Testing in Alberta|Alberta's standardized tests]] in some subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/northwest-territories-nunavut-to-have-input-in-albertas-k-12-curriculum-redesign|title=Northwest-Terrirtories and Nunavut to Have Input in Albertas K—12 Curriculum Redesign|last=French|first=Janet|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=November 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South Africa ===
In South Africa the Caps curriculum is used in Public schools. Private schools use IEB,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.Leeuwenhof.co.za|title=Leeuwenhof - Tuisblad|website=www.leeuwenhof.co.za|accessdate=2015-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cambridge, etc.

=== South Korea ===
The National Curriculum of Korea covers [[kindergarten]], primary, and secondary education, as well as [[special education]].&lt;ref name="korcur"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ncic.kice.re.kr/english.kri.org.inventoryList.do|title=National Curriculum of Korea Source Inventory|publisher=National Curriculum Information Center|accessdate=2015-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The version currently in place is the 7th National Curriculum, which has been revised in 2007 and 2009.&lt;ref name="korcur" /&gt;  The curriculum provides a framework for a common set of subjects through 9th grade, and elective subjects in grades 10 through 12.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ncic.kice.re.kr/english.dwn.ogf.originalFileTypeDownload.do?fileNo=10000018&amp;fileExp=PDF&amp;refPath=%EF%BF%BD%EF%BF%BD%EF%BF%BD%EF%BF%BD+PDF+%EF%BF%BD%EF%BF%BD%EF%BF%BD%EF%BF%BD+%EF%BF%BD%D9%BF%EF%BF%BD%CE%B5%EF%BF%BD|title=THE SCHOOL CURRICULUM OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA: Proclamation of the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology:  #2009-41|type=PDF|accessdate=2015-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
The curriculum in Japan is determined based on the guidelines for education and the guidelines for learning presented by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology.When deciding on the curriculum for each school, the school's organizers will decide on the outline by referring to the manuals and explanations prepared by the Education, Science and Technology Ministry and other public offices, and the schools will decide on additional annual plans.
The Courses of Education and Courses of Study are fully revised every 10 years.
Before World War II, the curriculum was based on the school regulations corresponding to each school type.

The Dutch system is based on directives coming from the [[Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (Netherlands)|Ministry of Education, Culture and Science]] (OCW). Primary and secondary education use key objectives to create curricula. For primary education the total number of objectives has been reduced from 122 (back in 1993) to 58 in 2006. Starting in 2009/2010 all key objectives are obligatory for primary education. The key objectives are oriented towards subject areas such as language, mathematics/arithmetic, orientation towards self and the world, art, and physical education. All of the objectives have accompanying concrete activities. Also final exams are determined by the OCW and required. Parts of those exams are taken in a national setting, created by a committee: [[Centrale examencommissie vaststelling opgaven]]. Furthermore, OCW will determine the number of hours to be spent per subject. Apart from these directives every school can determine its own curriculum.

===Nigeria===

In 2005, the Nigerian government adopted a national Basic Education Curriculum for grades 1 through 9.  The policy was an outgrowth of the [[Universal Basic Education]] program announced in 1999, to provide free, [[compulsory schooling|compulsory]], continuous public education for these years.&lt;ref name="danmole"&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=Pakistan Journal of Social Sciences|year=2011 | volume= 8 | issue= 1 | pages= 62–68| doi=10.3923/pjssci.2011.62.68 |title=Emerging Issues on the Universal Basic Education Curriculum in Nigeria: Implications for the Science and Technology Component |first=B.T. |last=Danmole |url = http://www.medwelljournals.com/fulltext/?doi=pjssci.2011.62.68 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the government implemented a revised version of the national curriculum, reducing the number of subjects covered from 20 to 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/166030-nigeria-revises-basic-education-curriculum.html|first=Amina|last=Mohammed|date=2014-08-14|accessdate=2015-01-12|title=Nigeria revises basic education curriculum|work=Premium Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
In [[Sweden]] since 2011, the primary school curriculum is [[Lgr 11]], while secondary schools use [[Lgy 11]].

===Scotland===
In [[Scotland]], the Curriculum for Excellence (CfE) was introduced in August 2010 in all schools. The national qualifications were introduced in 2013 by the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA). The national qualifications include:
[[Life Skills Coursework]] (SFL),
[[National 3]] (NAT3),
[[National 4]] (NAT4),
[[National 5]] (NAT5),
[[Higher (Scottish)|Higher]],
[[Advanced Higher]].

===United Kingdom===
{{main|National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)}}

The [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]] was introduced into [[National Curriculum for England|England]], [[National Curriculum for Wales|Wales]] and [[National Curriculum for Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland]] as a nationwide curriculum for primary and secondary [[public education|state]] schools following the [[Education Reform Act 1988]]. Notwithstanding its name, it does not apply to [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|independent school]]s, which may set their own curricula, but it ensures that state schools of all [[local education authority|local education authorities]] have a common curriculum. [[Academy (English school)|Academies]], while publicly funded, have a significant degree of autonomy in deviating from the National Curriculum.

The purpose of the National Curriculum was to standardise the content taught across schools to enable [[National Curriculum assessment|assessment]], which in turn enabled the compilation of [[league tables]] detailing the assessment statistics for each school.  These league tables, together with the provision to parents of some degree of choice in assignment of the school for their child (also legislated in the same act) were intended to encourage a '[[free market]]' by allowing parents to choose schools based on their measured ability to teach the National Curriculum.

===United States===

In the [[United States|U.S.]], each [[U.S. state|state]], with the individual [[school district]]s, establishes the curricula taught.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hnn.us/articles/22591.html National Education Standards...They're Back!] (article)&lt;/ref&gt; Each state, however, builds its curriculum with great participation of national&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brook.edu/press/books/NATLSTDS2.HTM Diane Ravitch, National Standards in American Education A Citizen's Guide] (book)&lt;/ref&gt; academic subject groups selected by the [[United States Department of Education]], e.g. National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) nctm.org for mathematical instruction.

The [[Common Core State Standards Initiative]] (CCSSI) promulgates a core set of standards which are specific information and skills a student needs to know at each grade level in order to graduate. States may adopt these standards in part or whole and expand upon them. Schools and states (depending on how much control a state gives to its local schools) then develop their curriculum to meet each of these standards. This coordination is intended to make it possible to use more of the same textbooks across states, and to move toward a more uniform minimum level of education attainment.

According to the CCSSI, “Decisions on how to implement the standards, including the right supports to put in place, are made at the state and local levels. As such, states and localities are taking different approaches to implementing the standards and providing their teachers with the supports they need to help students successfully reach the standards.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corestandards.org/about-the-standards/frequently-asked-questions/ Common Core Frequently Asked Questions] (article)&lt;/ref&gt;

Many educational institutions are currently trying to balance two opposing forces. On the one hand, some believe students should have a common knowledge foundation, often in the form of a core curriculum; on the other hand, others want students to be able to pursue their own educational interests, often through early specialty in a major, however, other times through the free choice of courses. This tension has received a large amount of coverage due to [[Harvard University]]'s reorganization of its core requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harvard Gazette: Discussing the Core Curriculum|url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2002/11.14/11-core.html|publisher=Harvard University|accessdate=9 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703105329/http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2002/11.14/11-core.html|archive-date=3 July 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Harvard approves new general education curriculum|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2007/05/15/harvard_approves_new_general_education_curriculum/|accessdate=9 February 2013 | work=The Boston Globe|date=15 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many labor economics studies report that employment and earnings vary by college major and this appears to be ''caused'' by differences in the labor market value of the skills taught in different majors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Simkovic|first = Michael|date = 2013|title = Risk-Based Student Loans|ssrn = 1941070|journal = Washington &amp; Lee Law Review|volume = 70|page = 527|doi =|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Majors also have different labor market value even after students complete graduate degrees such as law degrees or business degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = McIntyre|first = Frank|last2 = Simkovic|first2 = Michael|date = 2016|title = Value of a Law Degree by College Major|ssrn = 2742674|journal = Social Science Research Network|doi =|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An essential feature of curriculum design, seen in every college catalog and at every other level of schooling, is the identification of prerequisites for each course. These prerequisites can be satisfied by taking particular courses, and in some cases by examination, or by other means, such as work experience. In general, more advanced courses in any subject require some foundation in basic courses, but some coursework requires study in other departments, as in the sequence of math classes required for a physics major, or the language requirements for students preparing in literature, music, or scientific research. A more detailed curriculum design must deal with prerequisites within a course for each topic taken up. This in turn leads to the problems of course organization and scheduling once the dependencies between topics are known.

===Russia===

Core curriculum has typically been highly emphasized in Soviet and Russian universities and technical institutes.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

====Core curriculum====
&lt;!--Ernest L. Boyer links here--&gt;
[[File:Shimer IS 5 fall 1994 Sappho Bible.jpg|thumb|[[Shimer College]] students discussing texts in the school's core curriculum.]]
At the [[undergraduate]] level, individual [[college]] and [[university]] administrations and faculties sometimes mandate core curricula, especially in the [[liberal arts]]. But because of increasing specialization and depth in the student's major field of study, a typical core curriculum in [[higher education]] mandates a far smaller proportion of a student's course work than a [[high school]] or [[elementary school]] core curriculum prescribes.

Amongst the best known and most expansive core curricula programs at leading American colleges and universities are that of [[Core Curriculum (Columbia College)|Columbia University]], as well as the [[University of Chicago]]'s. Both can take up to two years to complete without [[advanced standing]], and are designed to foster critical skills in a broad range of academic disciplines, including: the social sciences, humanities, physical and biological sciences, mathematics, writing and foreign languages.

In 1999, the [[University of Chicago]] announced plans to reduce and modify the content of its core curriculum, including lowering the number of required courses from 21 to 15 and offering a wider range of content. When ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Economist]]'', and other major news outlets picked up this story, the University became the focal point of a national debate on education. The [[National Association of Scholars]] released a statement saying, "It is truly depressing to observe a steady abandonment of the University of Chicago's once imposing undergraduate core curriculum, which for so long stood as the benchmark of content and rigor among American academic institutions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nas.org/print/pressreleases/hqnas/releas_16apr02.htm |title=Home Page |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412050655/http://www.nas.org/print/pressreleases/hqnas/releas_16apr02.htm |archivedate=12 April 2013 |website=National Association of Scholars |accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, however, a set of university administrators, notably then-President [[Hugo F. Sonnenschein|Hugo Sonnenschein]], argued that reducing the core curriculum had become both a financial and educational imperative, as the university was struggling to attract a commensurate volume of applicants to its undergraduate division compared to peer schools as a result of what was perceived by the pro-change camp as a reaction by “the average eighteen-year-old” to the expanse of the collegiate core.

As core curricula began to diminish over the course of the twentieth century at many American schools, some smaller institutions became famous for embracing a core curriculum that covers nearly the student’s entire undergraduate education, often utilizing classic texts of the [[western canon]] to teach all subjects including science. Four [[Great Books]] colleges in the United States follow this approach: [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John’s]], [[Shimer College|Shimer]], [[Thomas Aquinas College|Thomas Aquinas]], [[Gutenberg College]] and [[Thomas More College of Liberal Arts|Thomas More]].&lt;ref name="smallcampus"&gt;{{cite news | title = Small Campus, Big Books | last = Johnson | first = Dirk | date = 2007-11-04 | newspaper = The New York Times |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/04/education/edlife/shimer.html | accessdate = 2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Association for Core Texts and Courses}}

====Distribution requirements====
Some colleges opt for the middle ground of the continuum between specified and unspecified curricula by using a system of distribution requirements. In such a system, students are required to take courses in particular [[academic fields|fields of learning]], but are free to choose specific courses within those fields.

====Open curriculum====
Other institutions have largely done away with core requirements in their entirety. [[Brown University]] offers the "New Curriculum," implemented after a student-led reform movement in 1969, which allows students to take courses without concern for any requirements except those in their chosen concentrations (majors), plus two writing courses. In this vein it is certainly possible for students to graduate without taking college-level science or math courses, or to take only science or math courses. [[Amherst College]] requires that students take one of a list of first-year seminars, but has no required classes or distribution requirements. Similarly, [[Grinnell College]] requires students to take a First-Year Tutorial in their first semester, and has no other class or distribution requirements. Others include [[Evergreen State College]], [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]], and [[Smith College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://openjar.org/curricular-freedom-examples-in-action |title=Examples in Action: Our List of Open Curriculum Colleges &amp; Universities |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804043018/http://openjar.org/curricular-freedom-examples-in-action |archivedate=4 August 2012 |website=Open Jar Foundation |accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wesleyan University]] is another school that has not and does not require any set distribution of courses. However, Wesleyan does make clear "General Education Expectations" such that if a student does not meet these expectations, he/she would not be eligible for academic honors upon graduation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wesleyan.edu/registrar/academic_regulations/general_education_expectations.html |title=General Education Expectations, Registrar |website=Weslayan University |accessdate=7 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720205647/http://www.wesleyan.edu/registrar/academic_regulations/general_education_expectations.html |archive-date=20 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gender inequality in curricula ==
{{Main|Gender inequality in curricula}}

[[Gender inequality]] in curricula shows how men and women are not treated equally in several types of curricula. More precisely, gender inequality is visible in the curriculum of both schools and Teacher Education Institutes (TEIs). [[Physical education]] (PE) is an example where gender equality issues are highlighted because of preconceived [[Gender stereotyping|stereotyping]] of boys and girls. The general belief is that boys are better at physical activities than girls, and that girls are better at ‘home’ activities such as sewing and cooking. This is the case in many cultures around the world and is not specific to one culture only.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002316/231646e.pdf|title=A Guide for Gender Equality in Teacher Education Policy and Practices|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100069-0|location=|pages=9, 59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dal bhat''' ({{lang-ne|दालभात}}, {{lang-bn|ডাল ভাত}}, {{lang-gu|દાળ ભાત}}, {{lang-mr|डाळ भात}}, {{lang-as|দাইল ভাত}} ''dail bhat'' / ডালি ভাত ''dali bhat'') is a traditional meal from the [[Indian subcontinent]], popular in many areas of [[Nepal]], [[Bangladesh]] and [[India]]. It consists of [[steamed rice]] and a cooked [[lentil]] soup called ''[[dal]]''. It is a [[staple food]] in these countries. ''Bhat'' or ''Chawal'' means "boiled rice" in a number of [[Indo-Aryan languages]].

[[File:Collage of dal bhat pictures.jpg|thumbnail|left|250px|Dal bhat]]
[[File:Assamese thali.JPG|thumb|250px|left|Dal bhat in Assamese [[thali]]]]
At higher elevations in Nepal, above {{convert|6500|ft}}, where rice does not grow well, other grain such as [[maize]], [[buckwheat]], [[barley]] or [[millet]] may be substituted in a cooked preparation called [[Dhindo]] or ''atho'' in Nepal.  Bhat may be supplemented with [[roti]] in Nepal (rounds of unleavened bread).

Dal may be cooked with [[onion]], [[garlic]], [[ginger]], [[chili pepper|chili]], [[tomato]]es, or [[tamarind]], in addition to lentils or [[bean]]s.  It always contains herbs and spices such as [[coriander]], [[garam masala]], [[cumin]], and [[turmeric]]. Recipes vary by season, locality, ethnic group and family.

Dal bhat is often served with [[tarkari|vegetable tarkari or torkari]] ({{lang|ne|तरकारी}} in Nepali) – a mix of available seasonal vegetables. It is also called '''Dal Bhat Tarkari''' (दाल भात तरकारी) in [[Nepali language|Nepali]]. There may also be [[dahi (curd)|dahi]] (yogurt) or curry made of [[chicken (food)|chicken]], [[goat meat]] or [[fish (food)|fish]]. A small portion of  [[pickling|pickle]] (called ''achar'') is sometimes included.

"'''Death and the Maiden'''" is a song by New Zealand rock band [[The Verlaines]]. It was released as a single in 1983 and is arguably the most popular song in their discography.
The 'B' side of the record was ''CD, Jimmy Jazz &amp; Me''.

"Death and the Maiden" later appeared on the 1987 album ''Juvenilia'', which was a collection of The Verlaines early singles and EP's.

New Zealand rock band [[Elemeno P]] released a cover version of this song on their 2005 album ''[[Trouble In Paradise (Elemeno P album)|Trouble in Paradise]]''. Former [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]] frontman [[Stephen Malkmus]] also recorded a version for the [[Flying Nun Records|Flying Nun]] tribute album ''[[Under the Influence - 21 Years of Flying Nun Records]]'' in 2002.  Boston band Prickly covered the song on their 1997 LP ''Velleity.''

==Meaning of the lyrics==
[[File:Egon Schiele 012.jpg|thumb|''Death and the Maiden'' by [[Egon Schiele]]]]
''You'll only end up like Rimbaud''&lt;br&gt;''Get shot by Verlaine, Verlaine, Verlaine, Verlaine....''&lt;br&gt;
The lyrics above refer to [[Paul Verlaine]], a 19th-century French poet. After going into a drunken rage, Verlaine shot his lover – fellow poet [[Arthur Rimbaud]] in July 1873.  The Verlaines took their name from the French poet.

''Shall we have our photo taken?''&lt;br&gt;''We'll look like Death and the Maiden''&lt;br&gt; 
This is a reference to a painting of the same name by [[Egon Schiele]], which shows a woman embracing a skeleton. The image is reproduced on the label of Verlaines' side of the "Dunedin Double" EP, issued in 1982 (the year before the release of "Death and the Maiden".

Baker | title=Learning analytics and educational data mining: towards communication and collaboration | journal = Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Learning Analytics and Knowledge | year=2012 | pages=252–254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Educational data mining refers to techniques, tools, and research designed for automatically extracting meaning from large repositories of data generated by or related to people's [[learning]] activities in educational settings. Quite often, this data is extensive, fine-grained, and precise. For example, several [[learning management systems]] (LMSs) track information such as when each student accessed each [[learning object]], how many times they accessed it, and how many minutes the learning object was displayed on the user's computer screen. As another example, [[intelligent tutoring system]]s record data every time a learner submits a solution to a problem; they may collect the time of the submission, whether or not the solution matches the expected solution, the amount of time that has passed since the last submission, the order in which solution components were entered into the interface, etc. The precision of this data is such that even a fairly short session with a computer-based learning environment (''e.g.'', 30 minutes) may produce a large amount of process data for analysis.

In other cases, the data is less fine-grained. For example, a student's [[university]] [[Transcript (education)|transcript]] may contain a temporally ordered list of courses taken by the student, the [[Grade (education)|grade]] that the student earned in each [[Course (education)|course]], and when the student selected or changed his or her [[academic major]]. EDM leverages both types of data to discover meaningful information about different types of learners and how they learn, the structure of [[domain knowledge]], and the effect of instructional strategies embedded within various learning environments. These analyses provide new information that would be difficult to discern by looking at the [[raw data]]. For example, analyzing data from an LMS may reveal a relationship between the learning objects that a student accessed during the course and their final course grade. Similarly, analyzing student transcript data may reveal a relationship between a student's grade in a particular course and their decision to change their academic major. Such information provides insight into the design of learning environments, which allows students, teachers, school administrators, and educational policy makers to make informed decisions about how to interact with, provide, and manage educational resources.

==History==
While the analysis of educational data is not itself a new practice, recent advances in [[educational technology]], including the increase in computing power and the ability to log fine-grained data about students' use of a computer-based learning environment, have led to an increased interest in developing techniques for analyzing the large amounts of data generated in educational settings. This interest translated into a series of EDM workshops held from 2000 to 2007 as part of several international [[Academic conference|research conferences]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;C. Romero, S. Ventura. Educational Data Mining: A Review of the State-of-the-Art. IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C: Applications and Reviews. 40('''6'''), 601-618, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, a group of researchers established what has become an annual international research conference on EDM, the first of which took place in [[Montreal, Quebec]], Canada.&lt;ref&gt;"http://educationaldatamining.org/EDM2008/" Retrieved 2013-09-04&lt;/ref&gt;

As interest in EDM continued to increase, EDM researchers established an [[academic journal]] in 2009, the ''[http://www.educationaldatamining.org/JEDM/ Journal of Educational Data Mining]'', for sharing and disseminating research results. In 2011, EDM researchers established the [http://educationaldatamining.org/ International Educational Data Mining Society] to connect EDM researchers and continue to grow the field.

With the introduction of public educational data repositories in 2008, such as the Pittsburgh Science of Learning Centre's ([[PSLC]]) DataShop and the [[National Center for Education Statistics]] (NCES), public data sets have made educational data mining more [[accessible]] and feasible, contributing to its growth.&lt;ref name="Baker"&gt;{{cite web|last=Baker|first=Ryan|title=Data Mining for Education|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~rsb2162/Encyclopedia%20Chapter%20Draft%20v10%20-fw.pdf|publisher=oxford, UK: Elsevier|accessdate=9 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals==
[[Ryan S. Baker]] and Kalina Yacef &lt;ref name="Baker 2009 2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baker|first=R.S.|author2=Yacef, K|title=The state of educational data mining in 2009: A review and  future visions|journal=JEDM-Journal of Educational Data Mining|year=2009|volume=1|issue=1|page=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; identified the following four goals of EDM:

#'''Predicting students' future learning behavior''' – With the use of [[student modeling]], this goal can be achieved by creating student models that incorporate the learner's characteristics, including detailed information such as their knowledge, behaviours and motivation to learn. The [[user experience]] of the learner and their overall [[Contentment|satisfaction]] with learning are also measured. 
#'''Discovering or improving domain models''' – Through the various methods and applications of EDM, discovery of new and improvements to existing models is possible. Examples include illustrating the educational content to engage learners and determining optimal instructional sequences to support the student's learning style.
#'''Studying the effects of educational support''' that can be achieved through learning systems.
#'''Advancing scientific knowledge about learning and learners''' by building and incorporating student models, the field of EDM research and the [[technology]] and [[software]] used.

==Users and stakeholders==

There are four main users and stakeholders involved with educational data mining. These include: 
* '''Learners''' – Learners are interested in understanding student needs and methods to improve the learner's experience and performance.&lt;ref name="Romero 12–27"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Romero|first=Cristobal|author2=Ventura, Sebastian|title=WIREs Data Mining Knowl Discov|journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery|date=January–February 2013|volume=3|issue=1|pages=12–27|doi=10.1002/widm.1075}}&lt;!--|accessdate=13 February 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; For example, learners can also benefit from the discovered knowledge by using the EDM tools to suggest activities and resources that they can use based on their interactions with the [[E-learning|online learning]] tool and insights from past or similar learners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Romero|first=Cristobal|author2=Ventura, Sebastian|title=Educational data mining: A survey from 1995 to 2005|journal=Expert  Systems with Applications|year=2007|volume=33|issue=1|pages=135–146}}&lt;/ref&gt; For younger learners, educational data mining can also inform parents about their child's learning progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Industry Canada|title=Assessing the Economic  Impact of Copyright Reform in the Area of Technology-Enhanced Learning|url=https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/ippd-dppi.nsf/eng/ip01102.html|accessdate=6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also necessary to effectively group learners in an online environment. The challenge is to learn these groups based on the complex data as well as develop actionable models to interpret these groups.&lt;ref&gt;Azarnoush, Bahareh, et al. "Toward a Framework for Learner Segmentation." JEDM-Journal of Educational Data Mining 5.2 (2013): 102-126.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Educators]]''' – Educators attempt to understand the learning process and the methods they can use to improve their teaching methods.&lt;ref name="Romero 12–27"/&gt; Educators can use the applications of EDM to determine how to organize and structure the [[curriculum]], the best methods to deliver course information and the tools to use to engage their learners for optimal learning outcomes.&lt;ref name="U.S. Department of Education"&gt;{{cite web|last=U.S. Department of Education|first=Office of Educational Technology|title=Enhancing Teaching and Learning Through Educational Data Mining and Learning Analytics: An Issue Brief|url=https://www.ed.gov/edblogs/technology/files/2012/03/edm-la-brief.pdf|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the distillation of data for human judgment technique provides an opportunity for educators to benefit from EDM because it enables educators to quickly identify behavioural patterns, which can support their teaching methods during the duration of the course or to improve future courses. Educators can determine indicators that show student satisfaction and engagement of course material, and also monitor learning progress.&lt;ref name="U.S. Department of Education"/&gt;
* '''Researchers''' – Researchers focus on the development and the evaluation of data mining techniques for effectiveness.&lt;ref name="Romero 12–27"/&gt; A yearly international conference for researchers began in 2008, followed by the establishment of the [http://www.educationaldatamining.org/JEDM/index.php/JEDM Journal of Educational Data Mining] in 2009. The wide range of topics in EDM ranges from using data mining to improve institutional effectiveness to student performance.
* '''[[Administrator (business)|Administrators]]''' – Administrators are responsible for allocating the resources for implementation in institutions.&lt;ref name="Romero 12–27"/&gt; As institutions are increasingly held responsible for student success, the administering of EDM applications are becoming more common in educational settings. Faculty and advisors are becoming more proactive in identifying and addressing at-risk students. However, it is sometimes a challenge to get the information to the decision makers to administer the application in a timely and efficient manner.

==Phases==

As research in the field of educational data mining has continued to grow, a myriad of data mining techniques have been applied to a variety of educational contexts. In each case, the goal is to translate raw data into meaningful information about the learning process in order to make better decisions about the design and trajectory of a learning environment. Thus, EDM generally consists of four phases:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# The first phase of the EDM process (not counting [[pre-processing]]) is discovering relationships in data. This involves searching through a repository of data from an educational environment with the goal of finding consistent relationships between [[Variable and attribute (research)|variables]]. Several algorithms for identifying such relationships have been utilized, including [[Statistical classification|classification]], [[Regression analysis|regression]], [[Cluster analysis|clustering]], [[factor analysis]], [[social network analysis]], [[association rule mining]], and [[Sequential Pattern Mining|sequential pattern mining]].
# Discovered relationships must then be [[Validity (statistics)|validated]] in order to avoid [[overfitting]].
# Validated relationships are applied to make [[predictions]] about future events in the learning environment.
# Predictions are used to support decision-making processes and policy decisions.
During phases 3 and 4, data is often visualized or in some other way distilled for human judgment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A large amount of research has been conducted in best practices for [[Data visualization|visualizing data]].

==Main approaches==

Of the general categories of methods mentioned, [[prediction]], [[Cluster analysis|clustering]] and relationship mining are considered universal methods across all types of data mining; however, '''Discovery with Models''' and '''Distillation of Data for Human Judgment''' are considered more prominent approaches within educational data mining.&lt;ref name="Baker"/&gt;

===Discovery with models===

In the Discovery with Model method, a model is developed via prediction, clustering or by human reasoning [[knowledge engineering]] and then used as a component in another analysis, namely in prediction and relationship mining.&lt;ref name="Baker"/&gt; In the '''prediction''' method use, the created model's predictions are used to predict a new [[Dependent and independent variables|variable]].&lt;ref name="Baker"/&gt; For the use of '''relationship mining''', the created model enables the analysis between new predictions and additional variables in the study.&lt;ref name="Baker"/&gt; In many cases, discovery with models uses validated prediction models that have proven generalizability across contexts.

Key applications of this method include discovering relationships between student behaviors, [[Receiver operating characteristic|characteristic]]s and contextual variables in the learning environment.&lt;ref name="Baker"/&gt; Further discovery of broad and specific research questions across a wide range of contexts can also be explored using this method.

===Distillation of data for human judgment===

Humans can make inferences about data that may be beyond the scope in which an automated [[data mining]] method provides.&lt;ref name="Baker"/&gt; For the use of education data mining, data is distilled for human judgment for two key purposes, [[Identification (information)|identification]] and [[Statistical classification|classification]].&lt;ref name="Baker"/&gt;

For the purpose of [[Identification (information)|identification]], data is distilled to enable humans to identify well-known patterns, which may otherwise be difficult to interpret. For example, the [[learning curve]], classic to educational studies, is a pattern that clearly reflects the relationship between learning and experience over time.

Data is also [[distilled]] for the purposes of [[Statistical classification|classifying]] features of data, which for educational data mining, is used to support the development of the prediction model. Classification helps expedite the development of the prediction model, tremendously.

The goal of this method is to summarize and present the information in a useful, [[interactive]] and visually appealing way in order to understand the large amounts of education data and to support [[decision making]].&lt;ref name="Romero 12–27"/&gt; In particular, this method is beneficial to educators in understanding usage information and effectiveness in course activities.&lt;ref name="Romero 12–27"/&gt; Key applications for the distillation of data for human judgment include identifying patterns in student learning, behavior, opportunities for [[collaboration]] and labeling data for future uses in prediction models.&lt;ref name="Baker"/&gt;

==Applications==
A list of the primary applications of EDM is provided by Cristobal Romero and Sebastian Ventura.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In their taxonomy, the areas of EDM application are:
* Analysis and visualization of data
* Providing feedback for supporting instructors
* Recommendations for students
* Predicting student performance
* Student modeling
* Detecting undesirable student behaviors
* Grouping students
* Social network analysis
* Developing concept maps
* Constructing courseware – EDM can be applied to course management systems such as open source [[Moodle]]. Moodle contains usage data that includes various activities by users such as test results, amount of readings completed and participation in [[discussion forums]]. Data mining tools can be used to customize learning activities for each user and adapt the pace in which the student completes the course. This is in particularly beneficial for [[online courses]] with varying levels of competency.
* Planning and scheduling

New research on [[Mobile phone|mobile]] learning environments also suggests that data mining can be useful. Data mining can be used to help provide personalized content to mobile users, despite the differences in managing content between [[mobile devices]] and standard [[Personal computer|PC]]s and [[web browsers]].

New EDM applications will focus on allowing non-technical users use and engage in data mining tools and activities, making [[data collection]] and processing more accessible for all users of EDM. Examples include statistical and visualization tools that analyzes [[social networks]] and their influence on learning outcomes and productivity.&lt;ref name="CRC Press"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Romero, C. |author2= Ventura, S. |author3=Pechenizkiy, M. |author4= Baker, R. S.|title=Handbook of  educational data mining|year=2010|publisher=CRC Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Courses==

In October 2013, [[Coursera]] offered a free online course on "Big Data in Education" that taught how and when to use key methods for EDM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Coursera|title=Big Data in Education|url=https://www.coursera.org/course/bigdata-edu|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This course moved to [[edX]] in the summer of 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=edXedxed|title=Big Data in Education|url=https://www.edx.org/course/big-data-education-pennx-bde1x-0|accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has continued to run on edX annually since then. A course archive is now available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Big Data in Education|url=http://www.upenn.edu/learninganalytics/MOOT/bigdataeducation.html|accessdate=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Teachers College, Columbia University]] offers a [[Master of Science|MS]] in Learning Analytics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Learning Analytics {{!}} Teachers College Columbia University|url = http://www.tc.columbia.edu/human-development/learning-analytics/|website = www.tc.columbia.edu|accessdate = 2015-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publication venues ==
Considerable amounts of EDM work are published at the peer-reviewed International Conference on Educational Data Mining, organized by the [http://www.educationaldatamining.org/ International Educational Data Mining Society].

EDM papers are also published in the ''[http://www.educationaldatamining.org/JEDM/ Journal of Educational Data Mining]'' (JEDM).

Many EDM papers are routinely published in related conferences, such as Artificial Intelligence and Education, [[International Conference on Intelligent Tutoring Systems|Intelligent Tutoring Systems]], and [[International Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation, and Personalization|User Modeling, Adaptation, and Personalization]].

In 2011, [[Chapman &amp; Hall]]/[[CRC Press]], [[Taylor and Francis Group]] published the first Handbook of Educational Data Mining. This resource was created for those that are interested in participating in the educational data mining community.&lt;ref name="CRC Press"/&gt;

== Contests==
In 2010, the [[Association for Computing Machinery]]'s [http://www.kdd.org/kdd2010/kddcup.shtml KDD Cup] was conducted using data from an educational setting. The data set was provided by the [[Pittsburgh Science of Learning Center|Pittsburgh Science of Learning Center's]] [https://pslcdatashop.web.cmu.edu/ DataShop], and it consisted of over 1,000,000 data points from students using a [[cognitive tutor]]. Six hundred teams competed for over 8,000 USD in prize money (which was donated by [[Facebook]]). The goal for contestants was to design an algorithm that, after learning from the provided data, would make the most accurate predictions from new data. The [https://pslcdatashop.web.cmu.edu/KDDCup/results.jsp winners] submitted an algorithm that utilized feature generation (a form of [[Machine learning#Representation learning|representation learning]]), [[random forests]], and [[Bayesian networks]].

==Costs and challenges==

Along with technological advancements are costs and challenges associated with implementing EDM applications. These include the costs to store logged data and the cost associated with hiring staff dedicated to managing data systems.&lt;ref name="edtechreview.in"&gt;{{cite web|website=EdTechReview|title=How Can Educational Data Mining and Learning Analytics Improve and Personalize Education?|url=http://edtechreview.in/trends-insights/insights/389-data-mining-and-learning-analytics-improving-education|accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, data systems may not always integrate seamlessly with one another and even with the support of statistical and visualization tools, creating one simplified version of the data can be difficult.&lt;ref name="edtechreview.in"/&gt; Furthermore, choosing which data to mine and analyze can also be challenging,&lt;ref name="edtechreview.in"/&gt; making the initial stages very time consuming and labor-intensive. From beginning to end, the EDM strategy and implementation requires one to uphold [[Internet privacy|privacy]] and [[ethics]]&lt;ref name="edtechreview.in"/&gt; for all stakeholders involved.

==Criticisms==

* '''[[Generalizability]]''' – Research in EDM may be specific to the particular educational setting and time in which the research was conducted, and as such, may not be generalizable to other institutions. Research also indicates that the field of educational data mining is concentrated in [[North America]] and [[western cultures]] and subsequently, other countries and cultures may not be represented in the research and findings.&lt;ref name="Baker 2009 2017"/&gt; Development of future models should consider applications across multiple contexts.
* '''[[Privacy]]''' – Individual privacy is a continued concern for the application of data mining tools. With free, accessible and user-friendly tools in the market, students and their families may be at risk from the information that learners provide to the learning system, in hopes to receive feedback that will benefit their future performance. As users become savvy in their understanding of [[online privacy]], [[Business Administrator|administrators]] of educational data mining tools need to be proactive in protecting the privacy of their users and be transparent about how and with whom the information will be used and shared. Development of EDM tools should consider protecting individual privacy while still advancing the research in this field.
* '''[[Plagiarism]]''' – Plagiarism detection is an ongoing challenge for educators and faculty whether in the classroom or online. However, due to the complexities associated with detecting and preventing digital plagiarism in particular, educational data mining tools are not currently sophisticated enough to accurately address this issue. Thus, the development of predictive capability in plagiarism-related issues should be an area of focus in future research.
* '''Adoption''' – It is unknown how widespread the adoption of EDM is and the extent to which institutions have applied and considered implementing an EDM strategy. As such, it is unclear whether there are any barriers that prevent users from adopting EDM in their educational settings.

Between 1589–92,&lt;ref&gt;Some contemporary sources speculate about the exact date; e.g. Rachel Hilliam gives 1591 (''Galileo Galilei: Father of Modern Science'', The Rosen Publishing Group, 2005, p. 101).&lt;/ref&gt; the Italian scientist [[Galileo Galilei]] (then professor of mathematics at the [[University of Pisa]]) is said to have dropped two spheres of different [[mass]]es from the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]] to demonstrate that their time of descent was independent of their mass, according to a biography by Galileo's pupil [[Vincenzo Viviani]], composed in 1654 and published in 1717.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vincenzo Viviani]] (1717), ''Racconto istorico della vita di Galileo Galilei'', p. 606: [...dimostrando ciò con replicate esperienze, fatte dall'altezza del Campanile di Pisa con l'intervento delli altri lettori e filosofi e di tutta la scolaresca...

According to the story, Galileo discovered through this experiment that the objects fell with the same acceleration, proving his prediction true, while at the same time disproving [[Aristotle]]'s theory of gravity (which states that objects fall at speed proportional to their mass). Most historians consider it to have been a [[thought experiment]] rather than a physical test.

==Galileo's experiment==
At the time when Viviani asserts that the experiment took place, Galileo had not yet formulated the final version of his [[law of free fall]]. He had, however, formulated an earlier version which predicted that bodies ''of the same material'' falling through the same medium would fall at the same speed.&lt;ref name=Drake/&gt;{{rp|20}} This was contrary to what Aristotle had taught: that heavy objects fall faster than lighter ones, in direct proportion to their weight.&lt;ref name=Drake/&gt;{{rp|9}}&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; An exception is [[Stillman Drake]], who argues that it took place, more or less as Viviani described it, as a demonstration for students.&lt;ref name=Drake/&gt;{{rp|19&amp;ndash;21, 414&amp;ndash;416}}

Galileo set out his ideas about falling bodies, and about projectiles in general, in his book ''[[Two New Sciences]]''. The two were the science of motion, which became the foundation-stone of physics, and the science of materials and construction, an important contribution to engineering. Galileo arrived at his hypothesis by a famous thought experiment outlined in his book ''[[De Motu Antiquiora|On Motion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This experiment runs as follows: Imagine two objects, one light and one heavier than the other one, are connected to each other by a string. Drop this system of objects from the top of a tower. If we assume heavier objects do indeed fall faster than lighter ones (and conversely, lighter objects fall slower), the string will soon pull taut as the lighter object retards the fall of the heavier object. But the system considered as a whole is ''heavier'' than the heavy object alone, and therefore should fall ''faster''. This contradiction leads one to conclude the assumption is false.

A similar experiment took place some years earlier in [[Delft]] in [[the Netherlands]], when the mathematician and physicist [[Simon Stevin]] and [[Jan Cornets de Groot]] (the father of [[Hugo de Groot]]) conducted the experiment from the top of the [[Nieuwe Kerk (Delft)|Nieuwe Kerk]]. The experiment is described in Simon Stevin's book ''[[De Beghinselen der Weeghconst]]'' (The Principles of Statics), published in 1586 and a landmark book on [[statics]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'Let us take (as the highly educated Jan Cornets de Groot, the diligent researcher of the mysteries of Nature, and I have done) two balls of lead, the one ten times bigger and heavier than the other, and let them drop together from 30 feet high, and it will show, that the lightest ball is not ten times longer under way than the heaviest, but they fall together at the same time on the ground.

Astronaut [[David Scott]] performed a version of the experiment on the moon during the [[Apollo 15]] mission in 1971, dropping a feather and a hammer from his hands. Because of the negligible lunar atmosphere, there was no drag on the feather, which hit the ground at the same time as the hammer.

'''''Haunted''''' is a 2005 [[novel]] by [[Chuck Palahniuk]]. The plot is a [[frame story]] for a series of 23 [[short story|short stories]], most preceded by a [[free verse]] poem. Each story is followed by a chapter of the main [[narrative]], is told by a character in main narrative, and ties back into the main story in some way. Typical of Palahniuk's work, the dominant motifs in ''Haunted'' are [[Paraphilia|sexual deviance]], [[sexual identity]], [[homosexuality]], [[Despair (emotion)|desperation]], [[Taste (sociology)#Bad taste|social distastefulness]], disease, murder, death, and [[existentialism]].

The synopsis on the dustjacket describes ''Haunted'' as a satire of [[reality television]], but according to Palahniuk, the novel is actually about "the battle for credibility" that has resulted from the ease with which one can publish through the use of modern technology.{{ref|metro}}

The cover of the 2006 U.S. [[Paperback#Trade paperback|trade paperback]] reprint features a [[Phosphorescence|glow-in-the-dark]] image. &lt;!-- I'm fairly certain the hardcover's dustjacket doesn't glow, but if I'm wrong, please correct this. --&gt;

==Plot summary==

Each of the book's chapters contains three sections: a story chapter, which acts as a [[framing device]] for the otherwise unconnected short stories; a poem about a particular writer on the tour, its author being unspecified; and the short story written by that writer.

The main story centers on a group of seventeen individuals (all of whom go by nicknames based on the story they tell) who have decided to participate in a secret writers' retreat, frequently compared by characters to the [[Villa Diodati]] retreat of 1816. After having noticed an invitation to the retreat posted on the bulletin board of a cafe in Oregon, the characters follow instructions on the invitation to meet Mr. Whittier, the retreat's organizer. Whittier tells them to each wait for a bus to pick them up the next morning and bring only what they can fit into one piece of luggage (in particular, only what they feel they need most).

The next day, the seventeen characters, Whittier, and his assistant Mrs. Clark are driven to an abandoned theatre. Whittier locks all of them inside the theatre, telling them they have three months to each write a [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] before he will allow them to leave. In the meantime, they will have enough food and water to survive, as well as heat, electricity, bedrooms, bathrooms, and a clothes washing and drying machine provided.

The characters live under harmless conditions at first. However, the group (not including Whittier or Clark) eventually decide that they could make a better story of their own suffering inside the theatre, and thereby become rich after the public discovers their fate. They then begin to individually sabotage the food and utilities provided to them, with each character trying to only destroy one food or utility to slightly increase the drama of their stay. Since the characters are not co-ordinating their plans, they end up destroying all their food and utilities, forcing all of them to struggle to survive starvation, cold, and darkness.

With Whittier accidentally dying from a [[stomach rupture]], the writers find themselves trapped without him. Believing a great increase in their suffering will provide a better story for when they're rescued, several writers start to willingly engage in self-mutilation and cannibalism, doing so to give the pretense Whittier tortured them. With numerous characters committing suicide, killing one another, or succumbing to their ailments, they continue to formulate their story whilst the theatre somehow repairs its broken utilities.

With numerous people dead, Mrs. Clark included, the writers continue to sabotage themselves, such as destroying the lighting and wasting any additional food supplies they find. The eleven remaining writers eventually group in the main theatre, only for Whittier to appear and reveal he faked his death (with Clark's help) and has been observing the writers through hidden cameras. Informing the writers their three months have passed and that they are free to leave, Whittier notes that, by continuing to blame him for everything and playing the victim to extreme extents, they haven't acted any differently from the other groups. Whittier unlocks the exit and leaves with Miss Sneezy, choosing her as the person he saves and offering her a new life. Mother Nature, objecting that they need to wait a little longer for other writers to die and for someone to rescue them, stabs Miss Sneezy. To prevent Whittier from leaving with her, they drag Miss Sneezy back inside and break the lock, and continue to wait for rescue.

=="Guts"==
The book is best known for the short story "Guts", which had been published before the book in the March 2004 issue of ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine as well as on Palahniuk's website. It is a tale of violent accidents involving masturbation, in which the reader is instructed to hold his or her breath in the very first line.

A New York City public school 11th grade teacher was suspended for letting his English class read "Guts".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bronx/teacher_suspended_for_giving_self_nV6xCRYzrjDVUIZFbdXD2L Teacher suspended for giving 'self-pleasure' reading to students]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plot summary===
"Guts" begins with the narrator, aptly named "Saint Gut-Free," telling the reader to hold his/her/their breath for the duration of the story.

The narrator then describes three stories of male [[masturbating|masturbation]] gone horribly awry. In the first story, an adolescent boy inserts a Vaseline-lubricated carrot into his rectum to stimulate his [[prostate]], then,  in haste, stashes it in a pile of laundry when he is called to dinner. Later, his mother takes the laundry away and presumably discovers the used carrot, but never mentions the incident. Next, the narrator tells the tale of a young boy who, having heard that it enhances masturbatory pleasure, inserts a thin stick of candle wax into his [[urethra]]. The wax unexpectedly slips back into the boy's bladder, thereby blocking his urine flow and causing blood to seep from his penis. Because he requires expensive surgery, his parents are forced to pay to repair his bladder with the boy's college savings. Finally, the narrator explains how he himself suffered a sexual injury, when sitting on the water-intake valve at the bottom of his home swimming pool while masturbating. While swimming down to the bottom of the pool to stimulate his prostate before coming up for air—a repetitive process he refers to as "Pearl diving"—the suction from the valve causes his rectum and lower intestines to [[Rectal prolapse|prolapse]] and become tangled in the filter. Ultimately, he finds himself stuck on the bottom of the pool and must gnaw through his own innards to free himself and avoid drowning. When Saint Gut-Free's sister later becomes pregnant, he falsely believes that he is the father of an incestuous child, since he thinks his sister has encountered the semen he leaves in their family swimming pool on that fateful day (she is actually pregnant by her boyfriend and decided to have an abortion).

In between the main stories, Saint Gut-Free muses over families who cover up their loved ones' accidental deaths by autoerotic asphyxiation. In doing so, he highlights the theme of sexual repression throughout the tale. For example, in all three cases of sexual trauma, the parents are aware of the erotic nature of their son's accidents, but never discuss them afterwards. As a result, their sons are forced figuratively  to "hold their breath" in the silence that lingers. Saint Gut-Free refers to these moments of sexual repression as the "invisible carrot," referring to both the mother in the first story and to the total denial of all the parents involved.

Purportedly all three of these incidents are based on true stories. According to Palahniuk, the first two tales came from his friends' experiences and the third he heard while shadowing [[sexual addiction]] support groups as research for ''Choke''. In one of these groups, he met an extremely thin man. When Palahniuk asked him how he stayed so thin, he told him "I had a massive bowel [[Segmental resection|resection]]ing." When Palahniuk asked what he meant, he told him the story which was the basis for the third episode in "Guts".

== Reception ==
Haunted received mixed to favorable reviews from critics upon its release. ''Haunted'' received a negative review from [[The New York Times]] columnist Tom Shone who noted that despite being referred to as a horror novel it is "...stubbornly unscary. It burps up its shock moments with so little ceremony that the Gothic virtue of stealthily sidewinding suspense -- the art of allowing a story to steal up on you before you even knew it was there -- is left whistling in the wind." Shone additionally noted the repetitive nature of many of the stories within the novel noting that every single story regardless of which character was narrating all utilized Palahniuk's distinctive style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/22/books/review/haunted-gore-values.html|title='Haunted': Gore Values|last=Shone|first=Tom|date=2005-05-22|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tasha Robinson of the A.V. Club reviewed the novel soon after its release giving it a positive review, stating "...Palahniuk is as unique and colorful as ever, with his predilection for odd factoids and weird twists. But none of this makes the arbitrary deaths, the ludicrous behavior, or the pages upon pages about corpse-rot and vivisection any easier to deal with. Like his characters, Palahniuk sometimes seems to be operating under the presumption that he can never sink too low, or vomit up too much. Here's hoping he's wrong, for everyone's sake." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/review/chuck-palahniuk-ihauntedi-4537|title=Chuck Palahniuk: Haunted|date=2005-05-17|website=www.avclub.com|access-date=2016-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hidden Christian Sites in the Nagasaki Region''' ({{lang-ja|長崎と天草地方の潜伏キリシタン関連遺産}}) is a group of twelve sites in [[Nagasaki Prefecture]] and [[Kumamoto Prefecture]] relating to the history of [[Christianity in Japan]]. The Nagasaki churches are unique in the sense that each tells a story about the revival of Christianity after a long period of official suppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5096/ |title=Churches and Christian Sites in Nagasaki |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=21 Sep 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposed jointly in 2007 for inscription on the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage List]] under criteria [[World Heritage Site#Cultural criteria|ii, iii, iv, v, and vi]], the submission named at the time '''Churches and Christian Sites in Nagasaki''' on the [[World Heritage Site#Nominating process|Tentative List]], was recognized on January 30, 2018 as a World Heritage Site. 

The initial nomination included 26 sites; however, after reconsideration the Nagasaki Prefecture reduced the monuments to 13 sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5096/ |title=Churches and Christian Sites in Nagasaki |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=}}; {{cite web |url=http://www.pref.nagasaki.jp/s_isan/en/assets/|title=Outline of Churches and Christian Sites |publisher=[[Nagasaki Prefecture]] |accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twelve sites were recognized. Controversies over the Hidden Christian Sites in the Nagasaki Region have been widely discussed in the academic literature.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.drustvo-antropologov.si/AN/PDF/2017_3/Anthropological_Notebooks_XIII_3_Delakorda.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity in Japan==
{{main|History of Roman Catholicism in Japan|Kirishitan|Kakure Kirishitan}}

[[Christianity]] arrived in [[Japan]] in 1549 with the [[Jesuit]] missionary [[Francis Xavier]]. Fanning out from [[Nagasaki]], the new faith won many converts, including a number of ''[[daimyō]]s''. [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] then [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] persecuted those professing to be Christian. After the [[Shimabara Rebellion]] of 1637–1638, the official repression of Christian practices was combined with a [[Sakoku|policy of national seclusion]] that lasted over two centuries. With the [[Opening of Japan#Commodore Perry .281853–54.29|advent of Western powers and reopening of Japan]] in the 1850s and the reforms of the [[Meiji Restoration]], missionary activity was renewed and a number of [[Kakure Kirishitan|Hidden Christians]] resurfaced. [[Ōura Cathedral]] of 1864 is the first of the churches built in subsequent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Meiji Revisited: The Sites of Victorian Japan |author=Finn, Dallas |publisher=[[Weatherhill]] |year=1995 |ISBN=0-8348-0288-0 |pages=12f}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Hooch co-founder Aleksey Kernes conceived of the idea of Hooch while working as a doorman at Hotel Chantelle.&lt;ref name = latimes&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.latimes.com/food/dailydish/la-dd-hooch-app-20160114-story.html | publisher = Los Angeles Times | title = Why the new Hooch app is the greatest deal in L.A.: $99 buys you 365 cocktails | accessdate = 18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kernes wanted to reward loyal customers with drink tickets but found current systems burdensome and not scalable. Following an initial prototype of the Hooch app, Kernes recruited Lin Dai as CEO, who departed his post as [[Chief Marketing Officer]] at Keek, which had gone public on the [[Toronto Stock Exchange]]. Jared Christopherson joined as Chief Revenue Officer and cofounder after leaving social-media marketing firm Yellowhammer.&lt;ref name = techcrunch/&gt;&lt;ref name = forbes/&gt; The three bootstrapped the app’s build out from Dai’s apartment at Caledonia in New York. In an interview with [[Forbes]], Dai explained that he decided to cofound Hooch just before his wedding and broke the news to his wife on their honeymoon.&lt;ref name = forbes/&gt;

In 2015, TimeOut New York uncovered Hooch’s app in beta phase and listed it as one of the five best drinking apps in New York City.&lt;ref name = timeout&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.timeout.com/los-angeles/blog/a-new-drinking-app-called-hooch-is-buying-you-one-cocktail-per-day-020516 | publisher = TimeOut | title = A new drinking app called HOOCH is buying you one cocktail per day| accessdate = 18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2016 the company raised a seed round of $1.25 million in funding led by Blue Scorpion Investments in early 2016. In October 2016 the company announced a larger seed round in the amount of $1.5 million&lt;ref name = nypost&gt;{{cite web | url = https://nypost.com/2016/10/10/hooch-raises-1-4m-more-for-subscription-based-cocktail-app/ | title = Hooch raises $1.5M more for subscription-based cocktail app | publisher = NY Post | accessdate = 18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; that included celebrity investors Russell Simmons, Chris Burch, [[Shaun White]], Leonard Blavatnick, Baron Davis, [[Emeka Okafor]], [[Tyson Ritter]] and Maxwell.&lt;ref name = huffingtonpost&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-you-need-to-know-about-hooch-and-how-they-attracted_us_59e78482e4b0e60c4aa36716 | publisher = Huffington Post | title = Why you need to know about Hooch and how they attracted investment from celebrities | accessdate = 18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017, Hotel Chantelle is one of over 500 venues where Hooch customers redeem a drink. Kernes remains its doorman. Actress Rosario Dawson joined Hooch’s list of celebrity investors in fall 2017.&lt;ref name = businessinsider&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.businessinsider.com/rosario-dawson-invests-in-free-drink-app-hooch-2017-9 | title = Rosario Dawson is the latest celebrity investor in an app that provides months of free cocktails

Hooch markets itself as a cost-saving lifestyle app for consumers and a predictive-analytics and revenue tool to its clients, which range from alcohol brands to restaurants.&lt;ref name = spirits&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2016/10/hooch-raises-us1-5m-to-expand-its-cocktail-app/ | publisher = The Spirits Business | title = Cocktail app Hooch secures US$1.5m funding | accessdate = 18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = huffingtonpost2&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-a-drinking-app-uses-smart-data-to-understand-customer_us_58f62c1be4b01566972252d1 | title =How A Drinking App Uses Smart Data To Understand Customer Behavior | publisher = Huffington Post | accessdate = 18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017 Hooch is available at over 500 bars and lounges in New York, Los Angeles, Miami, Dallas, Austin, [[San Diego]], Phoenix, San Francisco, and Hong Kong.

In 2016 the [[New York Post]] reported that along with the redeemed drink through the Hooch app, the average user purchases $100 to $140 in other drinks and food at the participating restaurant.&lt;ref name = nypost/&gt;
Adweek reported that Hooch’s data trove from its user base enables the company to identify local drink purchasing trends in real time. Specifically, the report said that Hooch “was able to predict that the [[Moscow Mule]] would dominate California before the trend was recognized in popular culture.”&lt;ref name = adweek/&gt;

'''Household plot''' is a legally defined farm type in all former socialist countries in [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] and [[Central and Eastern Europe|CEE]]. This is a small plot of land (typically less than 0.5 hectares) attached to a rural residence. The household plot is primarily cultivated for subsistence and its traditional purpose since the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] times has been to provide the family with food. Surplus products from the household plot are sold to neighbors, relatives, and often also in farmer markets in nearby towns. The household plot was the only form of private or [[family farm]]ing allowed during the Soviet era, when household plots of rural people coexisted in a symbiotic relationship with large [[kolkhoz|collective and state farms]]. Since 1990, the household plots are classified as one of the two components of the individual farm sector, the other being [[peasant farms]] – independent family farms established for commercial production on much larger areas of agricultural land (typically 10-50 hectares). In terms of legal organization, household plots are [[natural person|natural (physical) persons]], whereas peasant farms generally are [[legal person|legal (juridical) persons]].

==Names==
Household plots are called in Russian subsidiary (or auxiliary) household plots – личные подсобные хозяйства, abbreviated in writing and in speech as ЛПХ ([[Romanization of Russian|transliteration]]: LPKh). They are also often referred to (especially in official statistical publications) as хозяйства населения ({{lang-uk|господарства населення}}), i.e., plots (or farms) of rural residents (where the term “rural residents” is used to distinguish them from [[peasant farm]]ers). This Russian terminology was universally accepted in all former Soviet countries until the early 1990s, but a certain terminological divergence has since emerged in the [[Newly Independent State|newly independent states]]. For instance, in [[Uzbekistan]] the traditional household plots are now called [[Agriculture in Uzbekistan#Changing farm structure|dehkan farms]] and in [[Ukraine]] the Russian abbreviation ЛПХ has been replaced with OСГ (from Ukrainian: ''osobysti selyanski hospodarstva'').

==History==
In [[Czarist Russia]], the plot (''usad'ba'') was usually adjacent to the peasant's house.  Here the peasants traditionally grew vegetables, hemp (a source of oil and livestock feed) and a little fruit.  Gardens varied in size; they could be as much as a hectare, but most were smaller.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Hoch, ''Serfdom and Social Control in Russia: Petrovskoe, a Village in Tambov'' (Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1986), pp.48-9.&lt;/ref&gt;  The plot was normally in the hereditary tenure of the household, and not subject to [[repartition]] (unlike the peasants' holdings in the [[open field system|open fields]]).

In the later 19th century the growth of towns and cities in central Russia encouraged the development of market gardening and truck farming in this region.  By the eve of the Revolution the garden economy was developing quickly.  A further stimulus was provided in the first years of the Revolution by the Bolshevik policy of requisitioning peasant produce.  Fruit and vegetables were exempt from this policy, and this resulted in a strong swing from grain farming to kitchen and market gardening.  In the grain-producing regions (Black-Earth belt and North Caucasia) the garden economy increased its share of peasant commodity production from 3.3% in 1913 to 12.2% in 1920, while the field economy declined from 62.6% to 39.3% in the same period.  Market gardening continued to develop during the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Christine D Worobec, ''Peasant Russia: Family and Community in the Post-Emancipation Period'' (Princeton University Press, 1991), p.34; Orlando Figes, ''Peasant Russia, Civil War: The Volga Countryside in Revolution (1917 - 1921)''(Oxford, Clarendon Press, corrected paperback edn. 1991)'', p.283 note; V P Danilov, ''Rural Russia Under the New Regime'' (Hutchinson, 1988) (translation of ''Sovetskaya dokolkhoznaya derevnya: naselenie, zemlepol'zovanie, khozyaistvo ''[Moscow, 1977]), p.286.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|mass collectivization]] decree of January 1930 made no mention of garden plots, and in many areas the local Communist authorities abolished them.  But in March 1930, after the chaos and peasant resistance engendered by the all-out drive, the right of the peasant to have a personal plot was recognised.  No maximum size was agreed at this stage, however, and the garden plot remained in a legislative limbo until the kolkhoz model charter of February 1935.

This charter specified that plots could vary from one-quarter to one-half hectare, and up to 1 hectare in special districts.  The legislation regarded individual peasants as the holders but in practice plots were still in household tenure.  The private plots were responsible for a significant fraction of agricultural production, and provided the peasants with a large part of their food and income.  In 1938 they accounted for 21.5% of agricultural produce.  The average peasant household earned about twice as much from marketings from the private plot as from its work on collective land.

By the late 1930s market gardening, with the private plot as its base, was perhaps becoming the dominant part of agriculture in the Black-Sea hinterland and the truck-gardening areas around big cities like Moscow and Leningrad.  The government, alarmed by this `resurgence of private capitalism', passed legislation to contain it in 1939, but it continued to play an important role in agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Alec Nove, ''An Economic History of the USSR'' (Penguin, 1969), pp.*; Sheila Fitzpatrick, ''Stalin's Peasants: Resistance and Survival in the Russian Village After Collectivization'' (New York, Oxford University Press, 1994), pp.130, 131; ''Agricultural Workers in the USSR'' (Bodley Head, 1968), Soviet Studies series, ed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14316">In [[interpersonal communication]], an '''I-message''' or '''I-statement''' is an assertion about the feelings, beliefs, values etc. of the person speaking, generally expressed as a sentence beginning with the word "I", and is contrasted with a "'''you-message'''" or "'''you-statement'''", which often begins with the word "you" and focuses on the person spoken to.  [[Thomas Gordon (psychologist)|Thomas Gordon]] coined the term "I message" in the 1960s while doing play therapy with children. He added the concept to his book for parents, ''P.E.T.: Parent Effectiveness Training'' (1970).&lt;ref&gt;[[#refGordon1995|Gordon 1995]] p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Thomas. [http://www.gordontraining.com/thomas-gordon/origins-of-the-gordon-model/ Origins of the Gordon Model]. Gordon Training International. Retrieved on: 2012-01-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

I-messages are often used with the intent to be [[assertive]] without putting the listener on the defensive. They are also used to take ownership for one's feelings rather than implying that they are caused by another person. An example of this would be to say: "I really am getting backed up on my work since I don't have the financial report yet", rather than: "you didn't finish the financial report on time!" (The latter is an example of a "you-statement").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colorado.edu/conflict/peace/treatment/istate.htm "I" Statements not "You" Statements], International Online Training Program On Intractable Conflict, Conflict Research Consortium, University of Colorado, USA&lt;/ref&gt;

I-messages or I-statements can also be used in [[constructive criticism]]. For instance, one might say, "I had to read that section of your paper three times before I understood it", rather than, "This section is worded in a really confusing way", or "You need to learn how to word a paper more clearly." The former comment leaves open the possibility that the fault lies with the giver of the criticism. According to the Conflict Resolution Network, I-statements are a [[dispute resolution]] [[conversation opener]] that can be used to state how one sees things and how one would like things to be, without using inflaming language&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071023214256/http://www.crnhq.org/windskill4.html When to Use "I" Statements] from 12 Skills: 4. Appropriate Assertiveness. Conflict Resolution Network. Retrieved 2007-11-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==I-message construction==
While the underlying rationale and approach to I-messages is similar in various systems, there are both three-part and four-part models for constructing I-messages. A three-part model is proposed by the University of Tennessee Family &amp; Consumer Sciences for improving communication with children:
# I feel... (Insert feeling word)
# when... (tell what caused the feeling).
# I would like... (tell what you want to happen instead).&lt;ref&gt;Brandon, Denise [fcs.tennessee.edu/humandev/kidsmart/ks_c2a.pdf "I" Message Worksheet]. University of Tennessee, Extension Family and Consumer Sciences. Retrieved on: 2012-01-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hope E. Morrow, a common pitfall in I-statement construction is using phrases like "I feel that..." or "I like that..." which typically express an opinion or judgment. Morrow favors following "I feel..." with a feeling such as "sad", "angry", etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.traumacentral.net/i-statements.htm Constructing I-Statements], Hope E. Morrow, Massachusetts, MFT, CTS, 1998–2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  {{dead link|date=January 2018}}

Gordon advises that to use an I-message successfully, there should be congruence between the words one is using and one's [[affect (psychology)|affect]], [[tone of voice]], [[facial expression]] and [[body language]]. Gordon also describes a 3-part I-message, called a "confrontive" I-message, with the following parts:
*non-blameful description of the listener's behavior
*the effect of that behavior on the speaker
*the speaker's feelings about that effect
He describes the I-message as an appeal for help from the other person, and states that the other person is more likely to respond positively when the message is presented in that way.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refGordon1995|Gordon 1995]] p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict resolution===
If an "I" message contains "you-messages", it can be problematic in conflict situations. For example: "I feel..., when you..., and I want you to..." This can put the receiver of the statement on the defensive. In a dispute, use of a phrase that begins with "I want" may encourage the parties to engage in positional problem solving. This may make conflicts more difficult to resolve. An "interest-based" approach to conflict resolution suggests using statements that reflect why the individual wants something.&lt;ref name=Ohio&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101227141411/http://disputeresolution.ohio.gov/schools/contentpages/Istate21.htm Rethinking "I" Statements], from Communication Skills, Skills and Concepts of Conflict Management. Ohio Commission on Dispute Resolution &amp; Conflict Management. Retrieved 2011-02-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The goals of an "I" message in an interest-based approach:
* to avoid using "you" statements that will escalate the conflict
* to respond in a way that will de-escalate the conflict
* to identify feelings
* to identify behaviors that are causing the conflict
* to help individuals resolve the present conflict and/or prevent future conflicts.&lt;ref name = Ohio/&gt;

The [[Ohio Commission on Dispute Resolution and Conflict Management]] summarized this approach as follows: "A sender of a message can use a statement that begins with 'I' and expresses the sender's feelings, identifies the unwanted behavior, and indicates a willingness to resolve the dispute, without using 'you' statements or engaging in positional problem solving.&lt;ref name = Ohio/&gt;

The Commission proposed a four-part I-message:
#"I feel like___ (taking responsibility for one's own feelings)
#"I don't like it when__ " (stating the behavior that is a problem)
#"because____" (what it is about the behavior or its consequences that one objects to)
#"Can we work this out together?" (be open to working on the problem together).&lt;ref name = Ohio/&gt;

Marital stability and relationship analysis researcher [[John Gottman]] notes that although I-statements are less likely than You-statements to be critical and to make the listener defensive, "you can also buck this general rule and come up with 'I' statements like 'I think you are selfish' that are hardly gentle. So the point is not to start talking to your spouse in some stilted psychobabble. Just keep in mind that if your words focus on how ''you're'' feeling rather than on accusing your spouse, your discussion will be far more successful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work|author1=Gottman, John  |author2=Silver, Nan|chapter=Solve Your Solvable Problems|pages=164–165|date=1999|isbn=0-609-80579-7|publisher=Three Rivers Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Benefits of I-Statements, Self-Talk===

I-statements have been found to offer a tremendous benefit to clients – patients.  I-statements encourage growth and maturation.  They are beneficial when employed with an individual struggling with self-defeating thoughts and mindset.

The therapeutic model varies on its take on the use of I-statements.  I-statements are designed to rid the myths from the reality of life.  I-statements are further productive in challenging one's innermost feelings.  Dr. Asa Don Brown, author with the Canadian Counseling and Psychotherapy Association stated that "Self-talk reflects your innermost feelings." If they reflect your "inner most" feelings, then understanding those feelings are necessary in overcoming one's negative perceptions and worldviews, according to Dr. Brown.

I-statements are capable of influencing one's path and design in life.  According to Girlshealth.gov, "An I-statement is a sentence that begins with the word "I." It helps the... (individual) take responsibility for their feelings instead of saying they are caused by the other person. This can help keep relationships open and honest between people when there is a conflict." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.girlshealth.gov/relationships/conflict/i_statements.cfm Changing statements from "you" to "I" – Relationships]&lt;/ref&gt;

I statements are important for clarifying one's position, contribution, and desires around a situation, event, and/or life perspective.   According to family psychology movement, I-statements are necessary for establishing a healthy relationship and an appropriate level of intimacy.

I-statements help the individual avoid blame, turning blame into personal responsibility.  Personal responsibility is key to learning to use I-statements.  Without personal responsibility, I-statements are null in their intention.

===Shifting gears===
Gordon states, "Although I-messages are more likely to influence others to change than You-messages, still it is a fact that being confronted with the prospect of having to change is often disturbing to the changee." A quick shift by the sender of the I-message to an [[active listening]] posture can achieve several important functions in this situation, according to Gordon.  He states that in Leader Effectiveness Training courses, this is called "shifting gears", and states that the person might shift back to an I-message later in the conversation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Leader Effectiveness Training (L.E.T.): The Foundation for Participative Management and Employee Involvement |last=Gordon |first=Thomas |year=2001 |publisher=Perigee |location= |isbn= 9780399527135 |pages=113&amp;ndash;115 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sXr4tbe45ekC&amp;pg=PA113&amp;dq=%22leader+effectiveness+training%22+%22shifting+gears%22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of the concept==
A book about [[mentoring]] states that communications specialists find that I-messages are a less threatening way to confront someone one wants to influence, and suggests a three-part I-message:  a neutral description of planned behaviour, consequences of the behaviour, and the [[emotions]] of the speaker about the situation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refShea2001|Shea 2001]] p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

A manual for health care workers calls I-messages an "important skill", but emphasizes that use of an I-message does not guarantee that the other person will respond in a helpful way.  It presents an I-message as a way that one can take responsibility for one's own feelings and express them without blaming someone else.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refDavis1996|Davis 1996]] p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; A manual for social workers presents I-messages as a technique with the purpose of improving the effectiveness of communication.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSheafor1996|Sheafor 1996]] p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
A study in Hong Kong of children's reactions to messages from their mothers found that children are most receptive to I-messages  that reveal distress, and most antagonistic towards critical you-messages.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refCheung2003|Cheung 2003]] pp. 3&amp;ndash;14&lt;/ref&gt; A study with university students as subjects &lt;!-- (since clearly [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=601983 this] is the same study)--&gt; did not find differences in emotional reactions to I-messages and you-messages for negative emotions, but did find differences in reactions for positive emotions.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBippus2005|Bippus 2005]] pp. 26&amp;ndash;45&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of self-reported emotional reactions to I-statements and you-statements by adolescents found that accusatory you-statements evoked greater anger and a greater inclination for antagonistic response than assertive I-statements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ451193&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ451193 Kubany, E.S. et. al., "Verbalized Anger and Accusatory "You" Messages as Cues for Anger and Antagonism among Adolescents", ''Adolescence'', Vol. 27, No. 107, pp. 505-16, Fall 1992.]&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''intimate part''', '''personal part''' or '''private part''' is a place on the human body which is customarily kept covered by [[clothing]] in public venues and conventional settings, as a matter of [[fashion]] and cultural norms. In several cultures, revealing these parts is seen as a religious offence.

Definitions vary, but usually they are primarily the parts involved in [[sexual arousal]], [[reproduction|procreation]], and elimination of [[excreta]] and related matter, including:
*for both genders: the [[buttocks]], [[human anus|anus]], [[perineum]], [[mons pubis]] and [[groin]]
*for males: the [[human penis|penis]] and [[scrotum]]
*for females: the [[vulva]] (including [[pudendal cleft]]), [[vagina]] and [[breasts]].

The term ''intimate parts'' may be construed to mean only the external body parts that are visible when [[nudity|naked]], rather than the body parts more commonly referred to. For example, when naked, a woman's pudendal cleft is predominantly visible rather than the [[vagina]], and a man's scrotum is visible rather than the [[testes]] which are contained within.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercksource.com/pp/us/cns/cns_hl_dorlands_split.jsp?pg=/ppdocs/us/common/dorlands/dorland/nine/000957635.htm |title=Health Information—Find Articles, Tools, and Tips at MerckEngage.com|publisher=Mercksource.com |date=2011-06-25 |accessdate=2011-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Female breasts are considered as parts that would be covered in most contexts but with a degree of tolerance for [[toplessness]] varying in different regions and cultures. For example, Fischtein, Herold and Desmarais (2005) found that acceptance of toplessness in a sample of [[Canadians]] varied depending on both personal factors (such as the respondent's gender, age, and religion) and contextual factors (i.e. toplessness in streets, parks, or beaches).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_go1966/is_3-4_14/ai_n29238305/?tag=content;col1 |title=Canadian attitudes toward female topless behaviour: a national survey |journal=The Canadian Journal of Human Sexuality |first1=Dayna S. |last1=Fischtein |first2=Edward S. |last2=Herold |first3=Serge |last3=Desmarais |year=2005 |accessdate=2011-08-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119080421/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_go1966/is_3-4_14/ai_n29238305/?tag=content%3Bcol1 |archivedate=2012-01-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some periods of [[History of Europe|European history]], female shoulders and legs may have been considered intimate parts.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} More conservative viewpoints in the West in some contexts still find it appropriate that females should cover their shoulders, particularly when entering a [[Church (building)|church]] or other sacred space.

In Islamic traditions, the definition of [[awrah]] is similar to the definition of intimate parts in [[Western culture]]. The extent of cover for the female body depends upon the situation, but may include the hair, shoulders, and neck in addition to the aforementioned "intimate parts". A majority of scholars agree that the entire body except the face and hands should be covered in public or in front of unrelated non-Muslim women and in front of unrelated men. The exceptions are the scholars from [[Hanafi]] school of thought, which has the largest number of followers, which agree that the feet are not part of the awrah and therefore may be revealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/beliefs/hijab_1.shtml#section_4 |title=Religions - Islam: Hijab |publisher=BBC |date=2009-09-03 |accessdate=2011-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; For males, most scholars regard all parts of body from the navel to the knees as awrah.

The intentional exposure of one's intimate parts is a form of [[exhibitionism]]. Such exposure may be subject to strict [[Sociology|social rules]], [[social control]] and even [[criminal justice]], if it is considered to be a form of [[indecent exposure]]. The unintentional exposure of intimate parts (as in the case of a "[[wardrobe malfunction]]") may be connected with feelings of [[shame]].

Intentionally touching the intimate parts of another person, even through [[clothing]], is often associated with [[human sexual behaviour|sexual]] [[intent (law)|intent]]. If this is done without legally valid consent of the person being touched, it is considered groping or in some cases [[sexual harassment]] or [[sexual assault]].

[[Naturism]] is a lifestyle choice that is characterized by the practice of nudity both alone and in groups. Some naturists hold that nakedness is not automatically a sexual state and that covering areas of the body is merely a [[social construct]]: they believe that the [[social norms|norms]] of society can be upheld even when all are nude.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inf-fni.org/ International Naturist Federation] Welcome page. Retrieved Jan 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Blarcom, Jeffrey. "Physician Attire: A Scholarly Look." Hospital pediatrics 2.4 (2012): 249-252.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2462">{{Japanese name|Ishida}}
{{nihongo|'''Ishida Eiichirō'''|石田 英一郞||June 13, 1903 &amp;ndash; November 9, 1968}}  was a Japanese student of folklore. He became a [[communist]] at an early age, and was convicted under the [[Peace Preservation Law]] in 1928 and sentenced to five years jail. During his term of incarceration, he read widely, both in the Chinese classics and Western [[anthropology]]. On his release in 1934, he attended a lecture by the doyen of folklore studies, [[Yanagita Kunio]], where he became acquainted with [[Oka Masao]], who had just returned from completing a degree in [[ethnology]] at [[Vienna]] University. Through Oka's offices he was introduced to, and married, a granddaughter of Yanagita's older brother. Vexations were not wholly relieved by this advantageous connection. He remained unemployed, and had to suffer monthly visits by police agents who kept him under surveillance. The impasse in his career was overcome when Oka managed to secure for him a scholarship to study abroad at his own [[alma mater]], Vienna University.

At the late age of 34, Ishida began following lectures there from March 1937. After Hitler's invasion and annexation of [[Austria]], many of his teachers in ethnology, among them Father [[Wilhelm Schmidt (linguist)|Wilhelm Schmidt]], the world-famous [[list of linguists|linguist]] and [[anthropologist]] were forced into exile, and with the outbreak of [[World War II]] he himself was repatriated on the last available ship for Japanese nationals sailing from [[Bordeaux]], the ''Kagoshima-maru''. 

His expertise in ethnography was quickly turned to profitable uses on his return, and he finally received employment as member of a government organization interested in research on folk minorities in East Asia. In 1941, he surveyed the tribes of southern [[Sakhalin]]/[[Karafuto]], such as the Gilyak ([[Nivkhs]]),  the [[Ainu people|Ainu]] and the [[Oroks]].

This page features a '''list of [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] clans or tribes''' historically centered in the [[Hakkari province|Hakkari]], [[Sirnak province|Sirnak]] and [[Mardin province|Mardin]] provinces in [[Turkey]] and [[West Azerbaijan Province]] in [[Iran]],&lt;ref&gt;Poizat, Bruno, "The Sureth-Speaking Villages in Eastern Turkey," ''Journal of the Assyrian Academic Society, 1985–86'', Vol. I, no. 1&lt;/ref&gt;  prior to 1915, or before [[Seyfo]], when they were purely Assyrian settlements starting from around 3rd–[[4th century AD]], before early 20th century resettlement in [[Northern Iraq]] (which simultaneously had [[Chaldean Christians|Catholic-Assyrian]] tribes since the [[1st millennium]]) and northwestern [[Syria]] (namely in [[Al-Hasakah]]) after they were displaced, slaughtered and driven out by [[Ottoman Turks]] in 1915 and in the early 1930s, respectively, during the [[Simele massacre]] where they endured a similar anguish and predicament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aina.org/books/aov.htm M.Y.A . Lilian, ''Assyrians Of The Van District During The Rule Of Ottoman Turks'', 1914]&lt;/ref&gt;

Having lived in the ancient [[Assyria]]n cities of [[Nineveh]], [[Assur]], [[Nohadra]], [[Arrapha]] and [[Erbil|Arbela]],&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Gary N., ''From Urmia to the Stanislau: a cultural-Historical-Geography of Assyrian Christians in the Middle East and America'' (Davis, 1981)&lt;/ref&gt; which now lie in modern-day northern Iraq, before the [[common era]] (dating from around [[2500 BC]]), they eventually settled, and found refuge, in the mountainous region that is now southeastern Turkey and northwestern Iran after the [[spread of Islam]]&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, John, ''The Nestorians and their Muslim Neighbors'' (Princeton, 1961)&lt;/ref&gt; and their [[Christianization]] in [[post-classical history]].&lt;ref&gt;Atiyah, Aziz S. ''A History of Eastern Christianity'' (South Bend, Ind., 1968)&lt;/ref&gt; The villages in southeastern Turkey are primarily centered in the modern-day towns of [[Yuksekova]], [[Çukurca]] and [[Semdinli]] in [[Hakkâri]] (specifically the [[Hakkari|historical region of Hakkari]]), [[Uludere]] in Sirnak Province and [[Tur Abdin]] in Mardin Province.&lt;ref&gt;Wigram, W.A., "The Ashiret Highlands of Hakkari (Mesopotamia)," ''Royal Central Asian Society Journal'', 1916, Vol. III, pg. 40. -- The Assyrians and their Neighbors (London, 1929)&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the historical Assyrian tribes are located in the region stretching from [[Tur Abdin]] to Hakkari, in [[Upper Mesopotamia]], which formed the [[Nairi]] lands, serving as the northern Assyrian frontier and border with their [[Urartian]] rivals. The Assyrians of this region were [[Nestorian Christian]]s adhering to the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] and lived here until 1924, when the very last Assyrians who survived the [[Assyrian Genocide]] and massacres that occurred during 1918 were expelled. Most subsequently moved to the [[Nahla valley]] in northern Iraq or elsewhere.

The people of these tribes are an ancient people of [[Mesopotamia]] who speak [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]], a modern [[Syriac language]] that's derived from [[old Aramaic]] and has influences of [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Costa-Roberts|first1=Daniel|title=8 things you didn’t know about Assyrian Christians |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/8-things-didnt-know-assyrian-christians/|accessdate=6 July 2015|publisher=[[PBS]]|date=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early-mid 20th century, most settled in [[Iraq]], [[Jordan]], [[Syria]] and [[Iran]], where many eventually immigrated to the [[western world]] in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aina.org/maps/hakkarimap.png Assyrian villages in Hakkari Assyrian villages in Hakkari]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dalley, Stephanie (1993). "Nineveh After 612 BC." ''Alt-Orientanlische Forshchungen 20''. P.134.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Mongol conquest, 14th–15th century===
Following the devastation of the urban centres of [[Mesopotamia]] at the hands of [[Timur]], a [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] military leader of the [[Mongol Empire]] subjugated [[Baghdad]] and the general area, destroying [[Tikrit]], which effected the [[Syrian Oriental Orthodox Church|Syrian Orthodox Church]] which sheltered near Nineveh at [[Mar Mattai Monastery]] following the destruction of Christians in the region by [[Timur]] during the second part of the 14th century. The few survivors sought refuge among the Assyrians of Hakkari and the surrounding region, who have lived there since the [[Iron Age]] at time of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]]. This region also produced many bishops and patriarchs as hereditary succession was used to prevent a full ecclesiastical collapse of the church. By the 16th century, the Assyrians disappeared from many cities where they previously thrived, such as in [[Tabriz]] and [[Nisibis]].&lt;ref name=Alexander36&gt;{{Harvnb|Alexander|1994|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schism, 16th century===
By now, the Assyrians were concentrated in a mountainous triangular region with its head at [[Lake Van]] and [[Lake Urmia]] and [[Mosul]]. The [[Church of the East]] lost some of its members in the few centuries following the [[Schism of 1552]] to the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]]. The head of the [[Church of the East]] moved from [[Baghdad]] to [[Maragha]] in Urmia by 1553. Those living in Hakkari, however, were unaffected by the disputes and around 1600 the Chaldean Archbishop [[Shimun IX Dinkha]] broke away from [[Holy See|Rome]] and moved to [[Qudshanis]] in Hakkari where he reintroduced the Shimun line hereditary patriarchy which continued until 1976.&lt;ref name=Wilmshurst277&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilmshurst|2000|p=277}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Assyrians formed intricate alliances with neighbouring Kurdish tribes and their Ottoman lords, each tribe was led by a ''Malik'' ({{lang|syr|ܡܠܟ}}) who also functioned as a military leader during wartime.&lt;ref name=Aboona35&gt;{{Harvnb|Aboona|2008|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kurdish wars, 19th century===
{{main|Massacres of Badr Khan}}
In the 19th century, several competing Kurdish centers began emerging in the region. Mir Muhammed, the Kurdish Emir of [[Soran Emirate|Soran]] based in [[Rawanduz]] was able to establish a powerful emirate and depose his rivals controlling a region stretching from [[Mardin]] to [[Persian Azerbaijan]].&lt;ref name=Aboona173&gt;{{Harvnb|Aboona|2008|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was however defeated in battle when he tried to subdue the Assyrians of Hakkari in 1838. The Ottomans, seeking to consolidate their control of the region, engaged him in a costly war which led eventually to the dissolution of his Emirate.&lt;ref name=Aboona174&gt;{{Harvnb|Aboona|2008|p=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fall of his main rival, [[Bedir Khan]] of [[Bohtan]], Badr Khan sought to extend his dominion by annexing the Assyrian regions in Hakkari.&lt;ref name=Aboona179&gt;{{Harvnb|Aboona|2008|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took advantage of a rift between the patriarch [[Shimun XVII Abraham]] and [[Nur Allah]] the Emir of Hakkari. Badr Khan allied with Nur Allah and attacked the Assyrians of Hakkari in the summer of 1843 massacring them and taking those who survived as slaves.&lt;ref name=McDowall47&gt;{{Harvnb|McDowall|2000|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another massacre was inflicted in 1846 on the Assyrians of [[Tyari]], also residing in Hakkari.&lt;ref name=McDowall47 /&gt; The western powers, alarmed by the massacres pressured the Ottomans to intervene. Badr Khan was subsequently defeated and exiled to [[Crete]] in 1847.&lt;ref name=McDowall47 /&gt;

Although the region was nominally under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] control since the 16th century, it was in reality administered by its Assyrian and Kurdish inhabitants and their lords. The situation changed after the Kurdish war as the Ottomans now were able to extend their full control unopposed, and in 1868 the Sandjaq of Hakkari was created.&lt;ref name=Aboona3&gt;{{Harvnb|Aboona|2008|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genocide and exodus, 20th cenutry===
[[File:Qudshanis-Hakkari Mar Shimon house.jpg|thumb|220px|Residence of the Assyrian Patriarch in Qudshanis.]]
On the eve of the First World War, patriarch [[Shimun XI Benyamin]] was promised preferential treatment in anticipation of the war.&lt;ref name=Stafford23&gt;{{Harvnb|Stafford|2006|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the war began, however, Assyrian and Armenian settlements to the north of Hakkari were attacked and sacked by Kurdish irregulars allied with the Ottoman Army in the [[Assyrian Genocide]].&lt;ref name=Stafford24&gt;{{Harvnb|Stafford|2006|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gaunt134&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaunt|Beṯ-Şawoce|2006|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others were forced into [[Ottoman labour battalions|labour battalions]] and later executed.&lt;ref name=gaunt136&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaunt|Beṯ-Şawoce|2006|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The turning point was when the patriarch's brother was taken prisoner as he was studying in [[Constantinople]]. The Ottomans demanded Assyrian neutrality and executed him as a warning.&lt;ref name=tat&gt;{{citation|last1=Malik|first1=Yusuf|title= The Assyrian Tragedy |url= http://www.aina.org/books/tat.html |year=1934|publisher=S. Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stafford25"&gt;{{Harvnb|Stafford|2006|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In return, the patriarch declared war on the Ottomans on 10 April 1915.&lt;ref name=stafford25/&gt;

The Assyrians were immediately attacked by Kurdish irregulars backed by the Ottomans, driving most of the Assyrians of Hakkari to the mountain tops, as those who stayed in their villages were killed.&lt;ref name=stafford25 /&gt; Shimun Benjamin was able to move unnoticed to [[Urmia]], which at the time was under [[Imperial Russia|Russian]] control, and tried to persuade them to send a relief force to the besieged Assyrians.&lt;ref name="stafford25" /&gt; When the Russians replied that the request was unreasonable, he returned to Hakkari and led the surviving 50,000 Assyrians through the mountains to safety in Urmia.&lt;ref name="stafford25" /&gt; Thousands perished from cold and hunger during this march.&lt;ref name="stafford25" /&gt;

During the peace conferences in Paris in 1919, the Assyrians asked for a state in [[Diyarbekir]] and northern Mesopotamia in Iraq; others requested a British protectorate in [[Upper Mesopotamia]], northern Mosul, and Urmia.&lt;ref name=Nisan187&gt;{{Harvnb|Nisan|2002|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Assyrians tried to retake the region, but the Turks and Kurds objected to the Nestorian Christians desire to retake their ancestral lands in Hakkari, and an attempt to occupy the region by [[Agha Petros]] failed. In 1924 Turkey formally occupied northern Hakkari and expelled the last Christian inhabitants who still remained in the region.&lt;ref name=Nisan188&gt;{{Harvnb|Nisan|2002|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Assyrians still live in the Southern [[Barwari]] region of the Hakkari mountains, and in the [[Sapna valley|Sapna]] and [[Nahla, Iraq|Nahla]] valleys.

==Turkey==
===Albaq===
Qalanis is situated in the district of Albaq in [[Yüksekova]], [[Hakkari province]], [[Turkey]]. Prior to 1915 it was a purely Assyrian settlement, home to more than 25 households with three churches.

===Be-Aziza===
Located in Dilek, Oğul, Hakkari, the village of Be-Aziza was home to nearly 50 households prior to 1915, with two ancient churches. The largest and most important of these was dedicated to [[St. George]]. The village takes its name from the historic figure of King Aziz of Tal, who lived in the 4th-5th centuries AD and was the father of St. Talya (Mar Tlaye). In 1935, many Assyrians from Be-Aziza, who are called "Aziznaye", were resettled, with other Assyrians from Tal, in the village of Tell-Tal, on the banks of the Khabur River in Syria.

===[[Barwar Tribe|Barwar]] (Upper)===
Situated to the northwest of Upper Tyari in Hakkari, Turkey, Upper Barwaris speak a dialect very similar to Jilu and Diz people – Rather distinct to those in the Lower Barwari in Northern Iraq, who speak more like those of the Lower Tyari tribes. ''Barwar'' is "village" in [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]. Furthermore, unlike those in the Lower Barwari, the tribes in the Upper Barwar area do not identify as "Barwari" but rather with the names of their own individual tribes listed below. 

====Shwawuta====
[[File:Barwartribe.jpg|thumb|220px|Shwawuta village.]]
[[File:Qudshanis,upperbarwar.jpg|thumb|220px|Qudshanis meadows.]]
Located in Kolbaşı, Yüksekova, the village of Shwawuta (from the [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic|Assyrian]] word meaning "neighborhood") was one of the three centres of the Upper Barwar district in Hakkari. Prior to 1915 it was a purely Assyrian settlement, home to more than 20 households with two churches. A group of Assyrians from Upper Barwar settled in the village of Tell-Misas, along the Khabur River in Syria, in 1935.

====Qudshanis====
The village of [[Qudshanis]], traditionally called ''Qodchanis'' (and also spelled ''Qudshanes'', ''Kotchanes'', ''Qochanis'' or ''Kocanis''), located in Konak, Hakkari, was home to the family of the Catholicos-Patriarch of the Church of the East - the [[Shimun XIX Benyamin]]. Its main church of St. Shallita, built at the turn of the 17th century, therefore served as the [[List of Patriarchs of the Church of the East|patriarchal cathedral of the Church of the East]] from its founding in 1692 until 1918. The neighboring tribes were subservient to the Patriarch, based in Qochanis, and paid him [[taxes]], with which the patriarch then gave to the Ottomans.&lt;ref&gt;"The wild Christian tribes of Hakkari, whither no Government of any sort has ever extended, still pay tribute to their Patriarch for transmission to the Sultan; and not taxes through the tax-collector"&lt;/ref&gt; The [[confederation]] was in effect almost like a [[vassal state]] ruled by the Ottoman Empire, and even then the Assyrians were not subservient to the [[Sultan]], but rather the Patriarch. Hence why upon his [[declaration of war]] in 1915 the tribes of the region immediately went into open [[rebellion]] against the Turks before they were forced off of their ancestral lands in the [[Assyrian Genocide]], never to return again.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Stafford|first=R|title=The Tragedy of the Assyrians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LSzuzsRh37gC|year=2006|origyear=1935|publisher=Gorgias Press|isbn=978-1-59333-413-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The village was founded in 1672 by Chaldean Catholics from the city of [[Amida (Mesopotamia)|Amida]], who upon settling here broke off with the Catholic church and founded a new branch of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] in 1692, ruled by the Shimun line. From that point on the village functioned as the [[de facto]] capital of the Assyrian tribes in the region. The Patriarch residing in the Church of Mār Shalīṭa enjoyed both spiritual and political power over his subjects. Since priests were required to remain [[celibate]]s the patriarchy moved from uncle to nephew. This system came to be known as ''{{transl|syr|Nāṭar Kursyā}}'' ({{lang|syr|ܢܛܪ ܟܘܪܣܝܐ}} "Guardian of the throne"), and by the 19th century this system was applied to all dioceses of Hakkari.&lt;ref name=Alexander36/&gt;  A group of Assyrians from Qudshanis settled in the villages of Tell-Hufyan and Tell-Damsheej, along the Khabur River in Syria, in 1935. In Tell-Hufyan they built a new church dedicated to St. Shallita, and in Tell-Damsheej they built a new church dedicated to St. John.

Around the mid-19th century the Assyrians of Bejo converted from the [[Church of the East]] to [[Catholicism]] and came under the authority of the [[Chaldean Church|Chaldean Patriarchate]] of Babylon. Because of Bejo's location right on the Iraqi-Turkish border, the villagers were expelled by the Turkish military in 1925. After their final expulsion from Turkey, the Assyrians of Bejo ("Bejwaye") were resettled in a new village which they named [[Bejo]] (or Bajwa), near Zakho in north Iraq. This village had a population of 79 as per the 1957 Iraqi census. Its inhabitants were again moved out in 1976 by the Iraqi authorities and have not yet been able to return to their homes.

[[File:Dizlandscape.jpg|thumb|220px|The mountainous plains of Diz.]]
Diz have a dialect similar to Jilu people where they shorten the vowels, but to a high extent (''raba'' or plenty, is ''riba''), drop the ''t'' in some words and/or use 'y" instead (''beta'' or "house" is ''biya'' and ''mata'' or "village" is ''ma''). "Ta" ("come") in Standard Assyrian is "hay" in Diz. Like the Tyari people, they say "hon lakha" ("I'm here") as instead of "don lakha" in Standard Assyrian. 

====Irk====
Prior to the [[First World War]], the small and stray village of Irk in the Upper Zab Valley, in Depin, Hakkari, was at times associated with the main town of [[Julamerk]] and at others with the Assyrian tribal district of Diz. Around that time, its population numbered approximately 30 households, with an ancient church dedicated to St. George. It is not known if the former Assyrian inhabitants of this village have any descendants anywhere in the world today.

====Mar Quryaqus====
Mar Quryaqus is located in Kırıkdağ, [[Hakkari]]. At that time it was home to about 5 households, with an ancient church dedicated to [[St. Cyriacus]]. The church was well known for its [[Energy medicine|healing properties]], and maniacal people would often be locked inside it overnight to be healed. In 1935, many Assyrians from Diz were settled in the villages of Tell-Balu'ah and Qabr-Shamiyah, on the banks of the Khabur River in Syria. Others can now be found in Russia and other countries of the [[Assyrian diaspora]].&lt;ref&gt;Dauphin, C., "Rediscovery of the Nestorian Churches of the Hakkari (South Eastern Turkey)," Eastern Churches Review, Vol. VIII, 1976, pp. 56-57&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gawarspring.jpg|thumb|230px|Gawar plain blooming in springtime.]]

===Gawar===
Located in Ovası and Dereiçi in [[Yüksekova]], the Gawar plain was home to over 35 Assyrian villages, 30 churches and about 1,000 households up until 1915. The district centre was the town of Dizza d-Gawar (modern-day [[Yüksekova]]). People of Jilu and Gawar were very consanguineous and had close ties with each other, and speak the same dialect of Neo Aramaic.However, Jilu is to the east while Gawar is more proximate to the Tkhuma or Baz. Urisha was a purely Assyrian settlement prior to 1915, with a population of more than 20 households. Its church was dedicated to St. Sava the [[Physician]], and was a major centre of [[pilgrimage]] in the Gawar Plain.

===Gaznakh===
[[File:Gaznakhvillage.jpg|thumb|240px|Gaznakh is the only village in Turkey to still have a [[Assyrian continuity|persevering]] Assyrian presence since ancient times.]]
Located in Cevizağacı, Beytüşşebap, Şırnak Province, Gaznakh has always been a purely Assyrian settlement. Its modern Turkish name means "[[walnut tree]]", due to the predominance of walnut trees in the village. In the second half of the [[19th century]] it was home to nearly 100 households. The many sacred sites around the village included the monastery of St. John, and churches dedicated to [[Isaiah|St. Isaiah]], St. Gawsa, [[Woman with seven sons|St. Shmuni]] and [[Gabriel|St. Gabriel]]. Originally, those in the village were adherents to the Church of the East. After the 1920s, though, with the rest of their community having been banished from Turkey, they turned to either the Chaldean Catholic and [[Syriac Orthodox Church]]es in order to be supplemented with the fundamental spiritual and sacramental necessities.

The Assyrians of Gaznakh were not forced out of their village in either 1915 or 1924/5, and remained there until the conflict between the Turkish military and rebels from the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]] (PKK) got worse in 1988. The district of [[Beytüşşebap]], in which Gaznakh is located, remained part of Hakkari province until 1990, when it added to the newly-created province of Şırnak. At that time there were at least 300 Assyrians living in Gaznakh, but by 1995 all of them had left. By 2000 it was estimated that there were as many as 1,600 Gaznakh people dispersed in countries such as Turkey, Iraq, [[France]], and [[Belgium]].

In 2004, Assyrians began to return to Gaznakh, spearheading a movement in which another 3 Assyrian villages have also been resettled by their former inhabitants, in the same province. Currently, there are about 50 Assyrians who live in Gaznakh all year round, with many more returning to spend their holidays there in the summer months. The village has [[electricity]], telephone lines, [[running water]], and is accessible by way of an unsealed dirt road.

===Harmanis===
Located in Gövelek, [[Van Province]], Harmanis was a mixed settlement in the Timar district of [[Van, Turkey|Van]] around Lake Ercheg.

The village also had a population of 3 [[Armenian people|Armenian]] families (24 people) and 50 [[Kurds]] families (250 people). Some Assyrians from Harmanis were settled in the village of Umm al-Kayf, on the banks of the Khabur River in Syria, in 1935.

===Iyil===
Located in Kamber, Yüksekova, Iyil was housed 90 families with an ancient church dedicated to Rabban Mar Yonan (the saint and monk [[Jonah]]). Its name probably derives from the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] phrase "'Ayna d-El", meaning God's spring. This was the birthplace of Mar Thoma Darmo, first Catholicos-Patriarch of the Ancient Church of the East, and many well-known Assyrians originate from here. A group of Assyrians from Iyil settled in the village of Tell-Jazirah, along the Khabur River in Syria, in 1935. There they built a new church dedicated to Rabban Mar Yonan. Significantly, the Rabban Mar Yonan church at Iyil is now the first Assyrian church in Hakkari province to undergo a major and official restoration project.

===[[Jilu]]===
Located between the tribes of Baz and Gawar. The Tyari tribes are just to the west. Its speakers tend to have a distinct dialect, with shortened vowels, where /a/ turns into /e/ (e.g. ''raba'' or "plenty" is ''reba''). They tend drop the ''t'' in some words and/or use 'y" instead (''kteta'' or "''chicken''" is ''kteya'' and ''khata'' or "''sister''" is ''kha''). ''Ta'' in Standard Assyrian (meaning "come") is ''hiya'' in the Jilu dialect. Those of Baz and Gawar tribes may also have these features in their speech, but it's mostly Jilu people that have retained these conservative sounds in the modern era. 
[[File:Jiluassyrian.jpg|thumb|230px|Lake nestled by [[orchard]]s and a mountain in Jilu.]]

====Alsan and Meedi====
Located in Demirli, Yüksekova, Alsan was native to roughly 100 households with an ancient church dedicated to [[St. Michael]]. Nearby Meedi, was a mixed settlement of Assyrians and Kurds under the jurisdiction of Greater Jilu. Before 1915 there were about 10 Assyrian households in that village.

====Ishtāzin====
Located in [[Yeşiltaş, Yüksekova]], the Ishtāzin valley was a sub-district of Jīlū. This long [[valley]], which runs from northwest to southeast, near a [[tributary]] of the [[Great Zab]]. By the 1840s it was the only Kurdish-inhabited village in the Ishtāzin valley. In 1850 the Assyrian population of these villages was about 250 households, and by 1915 they would have increased to about 450 families. There were also five churches in the Ishtāzin valley, two of which were dedicated to St. George and St. Mary. The Assyrians of Ishtāzin were led by a [[Malik]] ([[chieftain]]), who resided in the village of Samsikké. After 1918, the Assyrians of Ishtāzin were dispersed. Many of them went on to form communities in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Iran]], and also in Russia, [[Iraq]] and Syria.&lt;ref&gt;Lālāyān, K.A., ''Āthorāyé d-Māhal d-Wān'', Tehran: Assyrian Youth Cultural Society Press, 1968, pp. 27-31&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mata d-Mar Zay'a====
The village of Mar Zay'a, in Çevrecik, Yüksekova, was a purely Assyrian settlement occupied by 70 households before 1915. Its ancient church was built by [[Zayya|St. Zaya]] and his disciple St. Tavor in 427 AD. For centuries the village served as the seat of the Mar Sargis metropolitan bishops of Jilu, whose jurisdiction also extended as far as the districts of Baz, Tkhuma and Rekan. The church of Sts. Zay'a and Tavor served as their [[cathedral]]. The Assyrians of Mata d-Mar Zay'a were mostly settled in the village of Khirsheniya, in the [[Dohuk province]] of north Iraq, in 1922. Most of them, however, went on to create urban neighbourhoods, such as the Jilu Camp (Camp al-Sikak) in [[Baghdad]], Jilo Mahallesi in [[Kirkuk]] and Sarbaz in [[Tehran]].

====Sāt====
Located in İkiyaka, Yüksekova, Sāt (also known as Sāten) was mixed Assyrian-Kurdish settlement. The Upper and Middle sections of the [[village]] were occupied by Kurds, the Lower part was populated solely by Assyrians. At that time, it was home to more than 300 people with an ancient church dedicated to St. Mārī the Apostle and Proselytiser of the East, and a village school run by the local [[Chaldean Christians|Chaldean Catholic]] priest. The church was significant as being the only one in the Hakkâri highlands dedicated to that particular [[saint]], and it was believed to have been built in the 3rd or [[4th century AD]]. Also near the village was a mountain [[shrine]] called ''Mārī'm'', sacrosanct to both Christian Assyrians and Muslim Kurds alike.&lt;ref&gt;Chabot, J.B., ''Synodicon Orientale'', Paris, 1902, p. 285&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kespiyanish===
Located in Mutluca, [[Beytüşşebap]], [[Şırnak Province]], the village of Kespiyanish is now a Kurdish settlement and it is not mentioned in any [[Syriac language|Syriac]] sources, manuscripts, or travelers' accounts from the 19th and 20th centuries. Its name though is similar to that of other known Assyrian villages, such as Minyanish, Sharanish, Alanish, Maranish, Azyanish, etc. Furthermore, author and scholar Gordon Taylor reported that, when he visited Kespiyanish in 1977, he was shown the intact structure of the village's old Assyrian church. It is not known if this structure still stands today.

===Lewin===
[[File:Lewinbeekeeping.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Beekeeping]] by a lake in Lewin.]]
Located in Geçitli Bucağı, Hakkari, the district of Lewin (Levin) is located in the northwest of Hakkari province and contained roughly 11 Assyrian settlements, with about 7 churches and monasteries before 1915. Up to 3,600 Assyrians (about 600 families) lived there, all of whom belonged to the Church of the East. The religious centre of the district was the village of Mata d-‘Umra d-Mar Giwargis d-Khargil which, in 1607, was the seat of a bishop named Mar Dinkha. In 1935, many Assyrians from Lewin were resettled in the village of Tell-Kayfchi, on the banks of the Khabur River in Syria. There they built a new church dedicated to St. George of Khargil.

===[[Karakilise, Şemdinli|Mar b'Ishu]]===
Located in Sarıkaya, Yüksekova, on the Turkish-Iranian border, close to the tribes in [[Targavar Rural District]] in [[Iran]], Mar b'Ishu was inhabited by roughly 350 menages. It was home to a 5th century monastery dedicated to St. Beh-Isho' of Kmol, which was destroyed in the war between the [[Turkish military]] and the [[PKK]] in the 1980s. At the end of the 19th century, the Kurds ravaged the villages in Mar Bisho with so many of the residents fleeing to Iran, where they founded seven villages in [[Bradost]], eight in [[Margawar]] and seventeen in [[Tergawar]]. A group of Assyrians from Mar-Bhishu settled in the village of Tell-Shamiran, along the Khabur River in Syria, in 1935. Others settled in the village of Qal'ah d-Qasha Avner, near [[Urmia]] in Iran. In both villages they built new churches in honor of St. Beh-Isho'.

===Marga===
Situated in Yemişli, Uludere in the Şırnak Province, Marga was a purely Assyrian settlement prior to 1925. Its name in Syriac means a [[pasture]] or [[meadow]]. In 1914 it was home to about 800 people (150 families), with an ancient church dedicated to St. Abraham. Around the mid-[[19th century]] the Assyrians of Marga converted from the Church of the East to [[Catholicism]] and came under the authority of the Chaldean Patriarchate of Babylon. Because of Marga's location right on the Iraqi-Turkish border, the villagers were displaced by the [[Turkish military]] in 1925. After their final banishment from Turkey, the Assyrians of Marga were resettled in the villages of Levo, Navkandala and Pirakka, near [[Zakho]] in north Iraq. In Levo they built a new church dedicated to St. Abraham. The largest community of "Margaye" outside the Middle East is now in [[Melbourne]], Australia. Margaye people are known to pronounce words that have a T sound with an S, so for instance "beta" ('house') will be "besa". This is a feature also present in the [[Senaya]] dialect, an Assyrian variety based in [[Iranian Kurdistan]].

===[[Nochiya Tribe|Nochiya]]===
Located on the eastern periphery of Hakkari, on the Turkey-Iran border. The Nochiya dialect is the most similar to Urmian of the Hakkari varieties, where they pronounce words akin to those of Standard Assyrian or Iraqi Koine (''beta'', ''kteta'', ''ta'', ''dooli''). Unlike the Urmian dialect though, they lack [[Farsi language|Farsi]] influence, such as the use of [v] instead of [w], and they would use an [e] sound instead of [i] for ''ika'' ("where"), just like the other adjacent Hakkari dialects. Moreover, some varieties may say "msawoteh" ("speaking"), akin to the Tyari dialects, instead of "hamzomeh", which is in Urmian and Standard Assyrian.

====[[Silvaneh District]]====
In [[Targavar Rural District]], there are 1,019 Assyrians in the purely Assyrian town of [[Mavana]], along with a few thousand more in other villages throughout the district and in the [[Margavar Rural District]] to the south.

===Benturé===
Located in Çubuklu, [[Şemdinli]], Benture was home to more than 20 households with an ancient church. Its name may [[Derivation (linguistics)|derive]] from the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] phrase "Beth-Naturé", which means "Place of the Guards", but most likely comes from the Syriac phrase "Bayn-Turé", meaning "Between the Mountains". The Kurdish name for the region around the village derives from the phrase "Nav-Çiya", which also has the same definition. In 1922 the Assyrians of Benturé were mostly relocated in villages of Iraq's Erbil province. Some were later resettled in the village of Fell-Faydhah, on the banks of the Khabur River in Syria, in 1935.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Solomon (Sawa) Solomon from Nineveh Magazine 1st &amp; 2nd quarter 1997, vol. 20, no 1&amp;2.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bé-Dīwé====
Bé-Dīwé, in [[Beyyurdu, Şemdinli]], was home to upwards of 25 households with two ancient churches dedicated to [[St. John the Baptist]] and [[St. Cyriacus]], as well as a shrine to St. 'Avdā. The name Bé-Dīwé is Assyrian, and derives from the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] or [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] phrase Beth-Dīvé, meaning, "Home of the [[Wolves]]". In 1922 the Assyrians of Bé-Dīwé (Bādūnāyé) were mostly resettled in villages of Iraq's [[Erbil governorate]]. Some of them were later resettled in the village of Fell-Faydhah, on the banks of the Khabur River in Syria, in 1935.

====Mār Dinkhā and Tīs====
Located in Soğuksu, Şemdinli was home to upwards of 30 homes. Nearby Tīs had the ancient monastery of Mār Dinkhā. The last bishop of this family was killed by invading [[Ottoman Turks|Ottoman]] personnel outside the village of Charbash, near Urmia (Iran), in February 1915, during the [[Assyrian Genocide]]. The former [[Catholicos]]-Patriarch of the Assyrian Church of the East, [[Mar Dinkha IV]], belongs to this family, and Tīs is his ancestral village. In 1922 the Assyrians of Tīs and 'Umra were mostly relocated in the village of Darbandoke in Iraq's Erbil province. Some of them were later resettled in the village of Fell-Faydhah, on the banks of the Khabur River in Syria, in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Stafford|first1=Ronald Sempill|title=The Tragedy of the Assyrians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LSzuzsRh37gC&amp;pg=PA32|year=2006|page=41|publisher=Gorgias Press LLC|isbn=978-1-59333-413-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Shapatan====
[[File:Shaputnochiya.jpg|thumb|240px|The meadows of Shaput.]]
In modern-day Şemdinli, [[Hakkari]], the district of Nochiya (Navçiya, [[Dağ İçinde]]) was flecked with more than 30 Assyrian communities preceding 1915. At that time, over 700 Assyrian families dwelled there, and they had approximately 34 churches and monasteries. The name Shapatan goes back to ancient times, when it was a province of the [[Assyrian Empire]]. The Assyrians of Nochiya were mostly settled in villages of [[Erbil]] province in northern Iraq, such as [[Diyana]], Hawdiyan, [[Harir]], Batas and Darbandoke, in 1922. A few relocated in the village of Tell-Faydah, along the Khabur River in Syria, in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dgDi9qFT41oC&amp;pg=PA47 A modern history of the Kurds], David McDowall&lt;/ref&gt;

====Berijaye====
Lying in Kaynaklı, Çukurca, Berijaye contained three churches, the largest of which was dedicated to St. Cyriacus (Mar Quryaqus), located outside the village near a water-powered [[Watermill|mill]] - called Dêra Laşawê by local Kurds today. The others were dedicated to St. George (Mar Gewargis) and St. [[Jonah]]. It was one of the last villages to capitulate on 15 September 1915, when the Assyrians were forced out of Hakkari by Ottoman troops and their Kurdish allies. The Assyrians of Berijaye were mostly settled in the hamlet of Tell-Mukhadah, along the Khabur River in Syria, in 1935. There they built a new church dedicated to St. Cyriacus.

====Gawaya====
Located in Çeltik, Çukurca, the village was the literal centre of the Tkhuma Assyrian tribal district. Prior to the [[First World War]] it was a purely Assyrian settlement, inhabited by 650 Assyrian families. It was also home to an ancient church dedicated to St. Shallita, and was the residence of the chieftains or maliks of Tkhuma. The Assyrians of Tkhuma Gawaya were mostly resettled in the villages of Tell-Hirmiz and Umm-Ghargan, along the Khabur River in Syria, in 1935. In Tell-Hirmiz, they built a new church dedicated to St. Shallita.

====Gundiktha====
Situated in what's now Başak, Çukurca, to the west of Baz and Jelu and just east of Tyari, it was home to 350 families. Its ancient church was dedicated to [[Ananias of Damascus|St. Ananias]] of the Oaths (Beth-Khanya d-Momatha). Local Kurds now know the church as Derâ Miskin. This church was notable for a cross called the "Oath Cross". The belief was that if someone incorrectly swore an [[oath]] on this cross they would suddenly die. The Assyrians of Gundiktha speak a dialect similar to Tyari people. They mostly settled in the villages of Tell-Sakrah and Tell-Shamah, along the Khabur River in Syria, in 1935. In each village they built a church dedicated to St. Ananias.&lt;ref&gt;Dodge, Bayard, "The Settlement of the Assyrians on the Khabur," Royal Central Asian Society Journal, July 1940, pp. 301-320.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gissa====
Located in Yapraklı, Çukurca contained 75 families and featured an ancient church dedicated to the 4th century Martyr Saint and Catholicos Mar Shim'on Bar-Sabba'e. It was one of the last villages to [[capitulation (surrender)|surrender]] on 15 September 1915, when the Assyrians were forced out of Hakkari by Ottoman troops and their Kurdish allies. The Assyrians of Gissa were mostly settled in the village of Tell-Kharitah, along the Khabur River in Syria, in 1935.

====Mazra====
In Manastırı, Çukurca, it was home to 300 families before Seyfo. Its Turkish name today is Yaylak. Its [[place of worship|spiritual]] centre was the 4th century Monastery of Rabban Pithyon, which was also a highly regarded place of pilgrimage across the Hakkari highlands, famed for its golden cross. This monastery is located between Mazra'ya and nearby Tkhuma Gawaya, and is known to local Kurds as Derâ Berujî. It was established by the monk Rabban Pithyon, who was a nephew and disciple of St. Eugene. The Assyrians of Mazra'ya were mostly settled in the villages of Tell-Rumman Tahtani and Tell-Wardiyat, along the Khabur River in Syria, in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Rowlands, J., "The Khabur Valley," Royal Central Asian Society Journal, 1947, pp. 144-149.&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Tyari]] (Lower)===
Tyari lies on the western periphery of the Hakkari province, with some villages being just within the Sirnak province. Tyari (and incidentally, Barwari) people have a distinguishable dialect which features, and rather retains, the [[Conservative (language)|conservative]] [[Voiceless dental fricative|voiceless ''th'']] and [[Voiced dental fricative|voiced ''th'']] sounds instead of [[dental stop]]s, ''t'' and ''d'', which are used in many other Assyrian dialects. A distinctive feature among Tyari speakers is saying ''hayo'' for ''ta'' ("come") and ''hola'' for ''doola'' ("there"). Each Tyari village will have subtle dialect differences. Most of the Assyrians from Lower Tyari resettled in Northern Iraq.

====[[Ortaköy, Uludere|Arosh]]====
An Assyrian tribe in Ortaköy, [[Uludere]], just south of Geramon and Halmon. Located in [[Sirnak province]], it closely borders the [[Hakkari province]] and also the Iraq border. The Sirnak portion is known as ''Ārosh Taxtayta'' (Lower Arosh) and the Hakkari part is called ''Ārosh Alayta'' (Upper Arosh), which is now designated as Yukariarus, a small hamlet. Due to the close proximity of the tribes, some Arosh people have mixed with those in Geramon, which lies a few kilometers north of the tribe, and they may be confused for them.

====[[Çığlı, Çukurca|Ashithā]]====
[[File:Ashitatribe.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Entrance to Ashita.]]
Located in [[Çığlı, Çukurca]], Ashita was home to nearly 800 families with a church dedicated to St. George and a shrine to St. [[Abraham]]. The village was divided into the following quarters: Isroor, Meweetha, Matha d-'Umra (Khateebin), Chammaneh and Chammaneh Khtaitha. The name Ashitha comes from the Assyrian word meaning "[[avalanche]]", because a part of the village is prone to that natural phenomenon. Even the modern Turkish name of the village, Çığlı, comes from the Turkish word Çığ, meaning "avalanche". In 1922, the Assyrians of Ashitha were mostly resettled in villages of [[Nineveh Governorate]] and Dohuk provinces in northern Iraq, mainly in [[Sharafiya]], [[Bakhetme]] and [[Sarsing]]. Furthermore, most Tyari Assyrians tend to be from Ashita (''Ashetnaye'') and it is one of the most common Assyrian tribe.&lt;ref&gt;Sykes, BG Sir Percy, "The Assyrians in Iraq: A summary of their history from 1918-1933," Royal Central Asian Society Journal, 1934, Vol. XXI, p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Belāthā====
Situated in Taşlık, Çukurca, Belatha was home to 100 families, and was also the village where the chiefs of Lower Tyare resided. Belatha is held to be one of the four original villages of the Tyare districts. Many Assyrians from the districts of Upper Tyare and Tkhuma, as well as the Be-Nikho and Be-Majje clans of Ashitha, have their heritage here. Above the village was the ancient monastery of [[Babai (Nestorian patriarch)|St. Babai]], which still stands today. The name Belatha comes from the Syriac phrase "Beth-'Allatha," meaning "place of fruits" or "place of crops". It may also derive from the Syriac phrase "Beth-'Ilyatha," meaning "place of the heights". The Assyrian dance "Belati" originate from this village. After 1924, Assyrians from Belatha settled in several villages of north of [[Amadiya]] and in the [[Nahla valley]] in the district of '[[Aqrah]] in Iraq. In the 1960s, the Assyrians of Chamme-Sineh were forced out by Kurds and eventually resettled in the nearby village of Kashkawa.&lt;ref&gt;http://soc-wus.org/ourchurch/Pat_V_Adiyaman.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gérāmon====
Located in Yarma, [[Uludere]] in [[Sirnak province]], in the valleys (Galliyane) west of Tyare, Geramon was home to more than 80 households, containing a 6th-century church that was dedicated to [[John of Damascus|St. John the Arab]]. From 1922 onward, the Assyrians of Geramon immigrated to Iraq. Its inhabitants are called ''Geresenayeh''. Due to its very close proximity to Halmon, the tribes share a cultural [[symbiosis]] and have an affinity towards each other. As such, many Assyrians from Iraq fallaciously consider ''Halmonaye'' as being ''Geresnaye'', whereas those [[Syrian Assyrians|from Syria]], conversely, label people from Geramon as ''Halmonaye''. Moreover, ''Aroshnaye'' are a tribe within their vicinity who may also be confused for either of them.&lt;ref&gt;Rassam, A. Hormuzd, "Non-Arab Minorities of Iraq," Royal Central Asian Society Journal, 1931, Vol. XVIII, p. 564.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Halmon====
[[File:HalmonAndac.jpg|thumb|240px|Snowfall in Halmon village.]]
Located in [[Andaç, Uludere]], Halmon is around 500 meters away from Geramon (Yarma, which is now part of Andaç as well) and, as such, the two groups are affiliated with each other and have [[Interethnic marriage|intermarried]]. The village consisted of over 60 households, with a [[4th century]] church dedicated to St. Shmuni. The Assyrians of Halmon were eventually settled in the village of Cham-Suske, in the Dohuk province of northern Iraq, in 1922, after violence and persecution. Afterwards, some were resettled in the village of Tell-Jum'ah, along the Khabur River in Syria, in 1935.

There are many [[Assyrian folk/pop music|Assyrian songs]] that have the word ''Halmon'' in their titles and lyrics. The songs are usually associated with the [[Assyrian folk dance]]. [[Adwar Mousa]] is a prominent Assyrian singer and lyricist from Halmon.

Unlike other Assyrian tribes, Halmonites are the only speakers who have [[Conservative (language)|retained]] the [[classical Syriac]] [[diphthong]] {{IPA|[eɪ̯]}} in words like ''psh'''ey'''na'' ("greetings") and ''kh'''ey'''la'' ("power"), where in other dialects and also Standard Assyrian speech (or Iraqi Koine), the [[monophthong]] /ɛ/ is used instead. Nonetheless, in formal speech, [[hymns]] and some forms of [[anthems|nationalistic music]], /ɛ/ may be diphthongized in Standard Assyrian as well.&lt;ref&gt;Chevalier, Michel, Les Montagnards Chrétiens du Hakkari et du Kurdistan Septentrional (Paris, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lizan====
[[File:Lizantyari.jpg|thumb|230px|The lush village of Lizan.]]
In Köprülü, Çukurca, Lizan was contained 80 households with an ancient church dedicated to [[St. George]]. The Assyrians of Lizan were forced out of their village in 1915 and again in 1924. The village was known for its famous bridge, which spanned the Upper Zab River between Lizan and the Kurdish village of Geyman. As such, the contemporary [[Turkish name]] for the village means "bridged". Currently, the church of St. George in Lizan is being used as a [[barracks]] by the Turkish military, which supervises the nearby Kurdish village of Geyman, as well as the Iraqi border nearby. The Assyrians of Lizan originated from the village of Matha d-Qasra (Qasran, now known as Güllüce). After 1925 the Assyrians of Lizan were resettled in the districts of Barwari-Bala and Nahla in northern Iraq's Dohuk and Ninawa governorates.&lt;ref&gt;Brigadier-Gen. H.H. Austin, "The Baqubah Refugee Camp", The Faith Press, london 1920.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Minyānish====
Located in Güzeldere, Çukurca, Minyānish was one of the largest villages in Lower Tyāré inhabited by more than 100 menages. The four ancient churches of the village were dedicated to the Virgin Mary, St. Shmuni, Rabbān Yāqu and Rabbān Sāhdā. The Assyrians of Minyānish are believed to originate from the ancient village of Lagippā, also in Lower Tyāré, and they must have settled there sometime prior to the [[10th century]], over 1,000 years ago.  After 1924, the Assyrians of Minyānish were settled in northern Iraq. Their most important settlement there, right now, is the village of Kashkāwā in the Nahlā Valley north of the town of 'Aqrah (Akre). Unlike the other Lower Tyari tribes, they use "sh" sound instead of "th" or "t" – So "beta" (''house'') will be "besha".&lt;ref&gt;Bird, Isabella. "Journeys in Persia and Kurdistan, including a summer in the Upper Karun region and a visit to the Nestorian rayahs". John Murray, London. 1891.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mnelgipa====
An Assyrian settlement just to the south of Minyanish, in Cukurca.

====Zawita====
An Assyrian village near Çukurca. [[Zawita]] in Northern Iraq was named after this village, after the Assyrians settled there.

===Tyari (Upper)===
The valley of Upper Tyare, in Hakkari, straddles the banks of the Upper Zab River. Up until 1915, this [[valley]] contained 20 purely Assyrian settlements (not including those in side valleys, such as Koh, Malota d-Malik, Mabbuwa, Rumta, Qallayatha, Sarspidho, etc.). At that time, these 20 settlements contained as much as 450 Assyrian families with 8 ancient churches. The dialects of the Assyrians in the Upper Tyari area, unlike those in Lower Tyari, generally use an "sh" sound instead of "th" for words like "beta" ("besha"), meaning "house"

The Assyrian settlements in the Upper Zab valley of Uper Tyare included: Zorawa, Chamba d-Badal, Dizza, Chamba Khadta (Chamba d-Mira), Darawa d-Walto, Chamba d-Hasso, Roma Smoqa, Be-Mariggo, Chamba d-Kurkhe, Dadosh, Chamba d-Tuwan, Be-Dalyatha, Chamba d-Malik, Be-Samano, Chamba d-Rora, Mazra d-Rumta, Chamba d-Be-Eliya, Chamba d-Qurdaye and ''Siyadhor.

The descendants of Assyrians from the Upper Tyare valley now live in the village of Kore-Gavana in northern Iraq's Dohuk province, as well as the villages of Tell-Tamr and [[Tell Tawil]] on the banks of the Khabur River in Syria.

====Mazra d-Rumta====
In Kaynaklı, Hakkari, Mazra d-Rumta was a purely Assyrian settlement home to roughly 5 households. This was one of the more than 10 [[hamlets]] in the Rumta sub-district of Upper Tyare, known in [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] as Rumtik or Rindke. The village of Mazra d-Rumta was based around the 5th century Monastery of St. Sava, which was a major pilgrimage site and served as an abode for the [[patriarchs]] of the Church of the East, whenever they would visit the Upper Tyare valley. Most Assyrians from Rumta were resettled in the village of Tel-Taweel, on the banks of the Khabur River in Syria, in 1935. Unlike the majority of Tyari tribes, they use "sh" sound instead of "th" or "t" – So "beta" (''house''), which is in standard Assyrian, will be "besha".&lt;ref&gt;Browne, W.H. The Catholicos of the East and His People, Being the Impressions of Five Years' Work in the Archbishop of Canterbury's Assyrian Mission (London, 1892)&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Qalaythatribe.jpg|thumb|230px|Qalyatha village.]]

====Qalaytha====
Located in Geçimli, Hakkari, Qalaytha (or Kelayta) was home to roughly 65 households. Their main church was built in 1818 and was dedicated to Christ's [[Holy Sepulcher]] in [[Jerusalem]] (Qaddishta). Other shrines in the village were dedicated to St. John and [[Macarius of Egypt|St. Abba Macarius]]. Today the village, which has been repopulated by Kurds, mainly serves as the location of an important Turkish military base. The Assyrians of Qalayatha were largely resettled in Tell-Tamr, on the banks of the Khabur River in Syria, in 1935.

====Chamba d-Malik====
Situated in the modern village of Olgunlar in Hakkari, the village was home to more than 60 households and was the residence of the Maliks of Upper Tyare. The ancient church in was dedicated to St. Sergius the Martyr (Mar Sargis). There was also a monastery near the village dedicated to [[Abraham Kidunaia|St. Abraham]], where the [[Chaldean Catholic]] bishop Mar Abraham d-Bet Mar Shimun died in 1915. In 1935, the Assyrians of Chamba d-Malik ("Chammanaye") were relocated in the village of Tell-Tamr, on the banks of the Khabur River in Syria. There they built a new church dedicated to [[Sergius and Bacchus|St. Sergius]] and St. George, which belongs to the Ancient Church of the East.

====Walto====
=====Khidhyana and Resha d-Nahra=====
[[File:KhidhyanaWalto.jpg|thumb|220px|The village of Khidyana.]]
Located in Ceylanlı, Hakkari, the villages of Khidhyana and Resha d-Nahra ("Head of the River") were purely Assyrian settlements. At that time, Khidhyana was had about 100 Assyrian households with an ancient church dedicated to St. John. Resha d-Nahra was inhabited by roughly 50 households and its church was dedicated to the Virgin Mary. In 1935, most of the Assyrians of Khidhyana and Resha d-Nahra were resettled in the village of [[Tell Nasri]], on the banks of the Khabur River in Syria. There, with other Assyrians from the Walto valley, they built a new church dedicated to the Virgin Mary.

=====Sirta=====
Located in Sütçüler, Hakkari, the village of Sirta was home to at least 80 households. It was situated in the district of Walto, and its church was dedicated to St. John. The Assyrians of Sirta were mostly resettled in the village of Tell-Nasri, along the Khabur River in Syria, in 1935. There, they inhabit their own neighbourhood in a village populated only by other Assyrians from the Walto district.

=====Ishta d-Nahra=====
Located in Derav, Hakkari, its Assyrian name means "the end of the river", since it was located at the concourse of the Walto River with the Upper Zab. Its more ancient name, found in Syriac manuscripts, is "Tra'-Nahra" (meaning the River's Gate). Prior to 1915, Ishta d-Nahra was home to more than 30 Assyrian households, with an ancient church dedicated to St. Eugene the Blessed (Mar Awgin, or Mar Marogen), who lived in the 4th century. The Assyrians of Ishta d-Nahra were mostly resettled in Tell-Tamer on the banks of the Khabur River in Syria, in 1935. They did not build a new church dedicated to St. Eugene, but still kept the cross from this church and celebrate his [[feast day]] every year.

==Iran==
In 1900, Assyrians numbered over 76,000 in northwestern Iran, constituting over a quarter of the [[West Azerbaijan Province]]'s population and were the largest non-Muslim majority in [[Urmia]]. Of the 300 villages around Urmia, 60 were exclusively Assyrians and 60 were mixed villages with Assyrian, Armenian, and [[Azeri]] communities. Nevertheless, there were over 115 documented Assyrian villages to the west of [[Lake Urmia]] prior to 1918. The home of the Assyrians in Iran has traditionally been along the western shore of [[Lake Urmia]] from the [[Salmas]] area to the Urmia plain. 

Although similar to Iraq Koine, where Koine ultimately derives from it, the Urmian dialect of this region has [[Farsi language|Farsi]] influence (such as the use of [v] instead of [w]), where, for instance, ''warda'' ("flower") will pronounced as "varda". Furthermore, unlike many Iraqi Koine speakers, Urmians use /[[Voiceless postalveolar affricate|tʃ]]/ instead of /k/ and /[[Voiced postalveolar affricate|dʒ]]/ instead of /g/ – So for example, words like ''kma'' ("how much") in Standard Assyrian (Iraqi Koine) will be ''chma'', and ''gana'' will be ''jana'' ("self"), respectively. Incidentally, /dʒ/ may also be used in some Tyari dialects as well. Furthermore, in many Urmian speakers, namely those who come from Iran, the [[Vowel length#Traditional long and short vowels in English orthography|long /a/]] sound as heard in "r'''a'''b'''a'''" ("plenty") will be turned into an /ɒ/ sound, so the word may sound like "''r'''o'''b'''o'''''".&lt;ref name="jaas.org"&gt;http://www.jaas.org/edocs/v20n1/Arianne-diaspora.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Urmia]] dialect was the prestige dialect of Assyrian Neo-Aramaic in the 19th and early 20th century, when it was chosen by [[Justin Perkins]], an American [[Presbyterian]] missionary, for the creation of a standard literary dialect of Assyrian, before ultimately a second standard dialect derived from ''General Urmian'' known as "''Iraqi Koine''" was developed in the 20th century.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Rev. Justin Perkins : “A residence of eight years in Persia among the Nestorian Christians”, New York, 1843 – P: 304.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|List of Assyrian settlements#Iraq}}
[[File:Iraqvillagebaghdeda.JPG|thumb|220px|A Syriac church in [[Bakhdida]].]]
Most traditional Assyrian settlements in Iraq, which were once ancient cities home to Assyrians from around 1500 BC-2000 BC, are now towns or small cities in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] and [[Iraq]] that are largely populated by Kurds and Arabs, with Assyrians being a significant minority. Such townships include [[Alqosh]], [[Tel Keppe]], [[Bartella]] and [[Tel Esqof]] (which are historical [[Chaldean Christians|Chaldo-Assyrian]] tribes) in [[Nineveh Governorate]] and [[Nineveh plains]], and the Kurdish-populated cities of [[Dohuk]] and [[Zakho]] (another Chaldo-Assyrian tribe) in [[Dohuk Governorate]]. [[Batnaya]], in the [[Tel Keppe District]] in Nineveh Governorate, is a Chaldo-Assyrian tribe that is currently uninhabited due to [[Islamic terrorism]].&lt;ref name="SmithNJp61"&gt;Smith, Natalie Jill. "Ethnicity, Reciprocity, Reputation and Punishment: An Ethnoexperimental Study of Cooperation among the Chaldeans and Hmong of Detroit (Michigan)" (PhD dissertation). [[University of California, Los Angeles]], 2001. p. 61. UMI Number: 3024065.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Assyrians inhabiting Nineveh Province are mostly adherents of the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]], whilst those in Dohuk adhere to the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] and [[Ancient Church of the East]]. Many Assyrians native to [[southeastern Turkey]] have settled in Northern Iraq from the 1920s and 1930s after torment, genocidal violence and [[discrimination against Christians|discrimination]], whilst some immigrated to Syria and the [[Caucasus]]. The nearby ancient Assyrian cities of [[Assur]] and [[Nineveh]] scarcely have Assyrians, if any, due to [[Iraq War]] and spread of [[ISIS]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atour.com/news/assyria/20030617a.html Indigenous People in Distress], Fred Aprim&lt;/ref&gt;

===Barwar (Lower)===
{{further|Barwari#List of settlements}}
[[File:Doorehassyrian.jpg|thumb|230px|The town of Dooreh, which still has an Assyrian presence.]]
Located in what is now [[Northern Iraq]], Lower Barwari is the only region in Iraq that is native to [[Nestorian]] Assyrians (as other Assyrian natives in Northern Iraq are predominantly Chaldean Catholics) and one of the few historical Assyrian regions to still have an Assyrian presence in the modern era. The Assyrians indigenous to this territory speak a dialect that is virtually homogeneous to those of the Lower [[Tyari]] region in southeastern Turkey, and unlike those in the Upper Barwari region.

[[File:DanteDetail.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Dante, poised between the mountain of purgatory and the city of Florence, a detail of a painting by [[Domenico di Michelino]], Florence 1465.]]
The '''''[[Divine Comedy]]''''' by [[Dante Alighieri]] is a long allegorical poem in three parts (or [[cantica]]s): the ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'' ([[Hell]]), ''[[Purgatorio]]'' ([[Purgatory]]), and ''[[Paradiso (Dante)|Paradiso]]'' ([[Paradise]]), and 100 [[canto]]s, with the Inferno having 34, Purgatorio having 33, and Paradiso having 33 cantos. Set at [[Easter]] 1300, the poem describes the living poet's journey through hell, purgatory, and paradise.

Throughout the poem, Dante refers to people and events from [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] and [[Biblical]] history and [[mythology]], the history of [[Christianity]], and the Europe of the [[Medieval]] period up to and including his own day. A knowledge of at least the most important of these references can aid in understanding the poem fully.

For ease of reference, the cantica names are abbreviated to Inf., Purg., and Par. [[Roman numerals]] are used to identify cantos and [[Arabic numerals]] to identify lines. This means that '''Inf. X, 123''' refers to line 123 in Canto X (or 10) of the Inferno and '''Par. XXV, 27''' refers to line 27 in Canto XXV (or 25) of the Paradiso. The line numbers refer to the original Italian text.

In the absence of texts of '''[[#Homer|Homer]]''', the readers in the [[Middle Ages]] considered Virgil's [[Aeneid]] to be the great epic poem of the [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] world. In Dante's time, many believed that Virgil had predicted the arrival of [[Christianity]] in lines from his ''Eclogue IV'': "at the boy's birth in whom/the iron shall cease, the golden race arise" (trans [[John Dryden]]).

The latter ruled Logudoro until 1290, when he was murdered by his son-in-law [[#Branca|Branca Doria]].

There have been many accounts of the '''[[origin of language]]''' in the world's '''[[mythology|mythologies]]''' and other stories pertaining to the origin of language, the development of language and the reasons behind the diversity in languages today.

These myths have similarities, recurring themes, and differences, having been passed down through [[oral tradition]]. Some myths go further than just storytelling and are religious, with some even having a literal interpretation even today. Recurring themes in the myths of language dispersal are floods and catastrophes. Many stories tell of a great [[deluge (mythology)|deluge]] or flood which caused the peoples of the Earth to scatter over the face of the planet. Punishment by a god or gods for perceived wrongdoing on the part of man is another recurring theme.

Myths regarding the origins of language and languages are generally subsumed or footnoted into larger [[creation myth]]s, although there are differences. Some tales say a [[Creator deity|creator]] endowed language from the beginning, others count language among later gifts, or curses.

==Hebrew Bible==
{{main|Adamic language|Tower of Babel#Confusion of tongues}}
{{further|Tower of Babel}}
[[File:Confusion of Tongues.png|right|thumb|The "[[confusion of tongues]]" by [[Gustave Doré]], a [[woodcut]] depicting the [[Tower of Babel]] from [[Abrahamic]] myth.]]
The [[Hebrew Bible]] attributes the origin of language per se to humans, with Adam being asked to name the creatures that God had created.

One of the most well known examples in the West is the [[Tower of Babel]] passage from [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]. 
It tells of [[YHWH|God]] punishing [[Human beings|humanity]] for arrogance and disobedience by means of the [[confusion of tongues]].

:And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.
:Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.  (Genesis 11:5-6, [[KJV]] translation)

This became the standard account in the European Middle Ages, reflected in medieval literature such as the tale of [[Fénius Farsaid]].

==India==
[[Vāc]] is the Hindu goddess of speech, or "speech personified". As ''[[brahman]]'' "sacred utterance", she has a cosmological role as the "Mother of the [[Veda]]s".
She is presented as the consort of [[Prajapati]], who is likewise presented as the origin of the Veda.&lt;ref&gt;"Veda, Prajāpati and Vāc" in Barbara A. Holdrege, 'Veda in the Brahmanas', in: Laurie L. Patton (ed.) ''Authority, anxiety, and canon: essays in Vedic interpretation'', 1994, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-1937-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
She became conflated with [[Sarasvati]] in later Hindu mythology.

==Americas==
[[File:Gustave Doré - The Holy Bible - Plate I, The Deluge.jpg|thumb|right|Doré's "The Deluge". Man and beast take refuge on an isolated rock during the [[Deluge (mythology)|Great Flood]], a feature of [[creation myth]]s from around the world.]]
In common with the mythology of many other civilizations and cultures which tell of a [[Flood myth|Great Flood]], certain [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes tell of a deluge which came over the Earth. After the water subsides, various explanations are given for the new diversity in speech.

===Mesoamerica===
The [[Aztecs]]' story maintains that only a man, [[Coxcox]], and a woman, [[Xochiquetzal]], survive, having floated on a piece of bark. They found themselves on land and begot many children who were at first born unable to speak, but subsequently, upon the arrival of a [[dove]] were endowed with language, although each one was given a different speech such that they could not understand one another.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, P. and Russell-Coulter, C. (2001) ''Dictionary of Ancient Deities'' (Oxford: OUP)&lt;/ref&gt;

===North America===
A similar flood is described by the [[Kaska]] people from North America, however, like with the story of Babel, the people were now "widely scattered over the world". The narrator of the story adds that this explains the many different centres of population, the many tribes and the many languages, "Before the flood, there was but one centre; for all the people lived together in one country, and spoke one language."&lt;ref&gt;Teit, J. A. (1917) "Kaska Tales" in ''Journal of American Folklore'', No. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

:They did not know where the other people lived, and probably thought themselves the only survivors. Long afterwards, when in their wanderings they met people from another place, they spoke different languages, and could not understand one another.

An [[Iroquois]] story tells of the god [[Taryenyawagon]] (''Holder of the Heavens'') guiding his people on a journey and directing them to settle in different places whence their languages changed.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, E. [http://www.library.jbsheets.com/america/LegendsTraditionsandLawsoftheIroquois.htm Legends, Traditions, and Laws of the Iroquois, or Six Nations, and History of the Tuscarora Indians] (Access date: 4 June 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Salishan]] myth tells how an argument led to the divergence of languages.  Two people were arguing whether the high-pitched humming noise that accompanies ducks in flight is from air passing through the beak or from the flapping of wings.  The argument is not settled by the chief, who then calls a council of all the leading people from nearby villages.  This council breaks down in argument when nobody can agree, and eventually the dispute leads to a split where some people move far away.  Over time they slowly began to speak differently, and eventually other languages were formed.&lt;ref&gt;Boas, F. (ed.) (1917) "The Origin of the Different Languages". ''Folk-Tales of Salishan and Sahaptin Tribes'' (New York: American Folk-Lore Society)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mythology of the [[Yuki tribe|Yuki]], [[indigenous people of California]], a creator, accompanied by [[Coyote (mythology)|Coyote]] creates language as he creates the tribes in various localities. He lays sticks which will transform into people upon daybreak.

:Then follows a long journey of the creator, still accompanied by Coyote, in the course of which he makes tribes in different localities, in each case by laying sticks in the house over night, gives them their customs and mode of life, and each their language.&lt;ref&gt;Kroeber, A. L. (1907) "Indian Myths of South Central California" in ''American Archaeology and Ethnology'', Vol. 4, No. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amazonas, Brazil===
The [[Ticuna people]] of the [[Amazon Rainforest|Upper Amazon]] tell that all the peoples were once a single tribe, speaking the same language until two hummingbird eggs were eaten, it is not told by whom. Subsequently the tribe split into groups and dispersed far and wide.&lt;ref&gt;Carneiro, R. (2000) "Origin Myths" in ''California Journal of Science Education''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Europe==

In [[Ancient Greece]] there was a myth which told that for ages men had lived without law under the rule of [[Zeus]] and speaking one language, gifted to them by the god and goddess of ingenuity, Philarios and Philarion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/966398472|title=Multilingualism : a very short introduction|last=1951-|first=Maher, John C.,|isbn=9780198724995|edition= First |location=Oxford|oclc=966398472}}&lt;/ref&gt; The god [[Hermes]] brought diversity in speech and along with it separation into nations and discord ensued. Zeus then resigned his position, yielding it to the first king of men, [[Phoroneus]].

In [[Norse mythology]], the faculty of speech is a gift from the third son of [[Borr]], [[Vé]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Vili and Vé]]&lt;/ref&gt; who gave also hearing and sight.

:When the sons of [[Borr]] were walking along the sea-strand, they found two trees, and took up the trees and shaped men of them: the first gave them spirit and life; the second, wit and feeling; the third, form, speech, hearing, and sight.

==Africa==
The Wa-Sania, a [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] people of [[East Africa]]n origin have a tale that in the beginning, the peoples of the earth knew only one language, but during a severe [[famine]], a madness struck the people, causing them to wander in all directions, jabbering strange words, and this is how different languages came about.

A god who speaks all languages is a theme in [[African mythology]], two examples being [[Eshu]] of the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]], a trickster who is a messenger of the gods. Eshu has a parallel in [[Legba]] from the Fon people of [[Benin]]. Another [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] god who speaks all the languages of the world is [[Orunmila]], the god of [[divination]].

==Southeast Asia and Oceania==

===Polynesia===
A group of people on the island of [[Hao (French Polynesia)|Hao]] in [[Polynesia]] tell a very similar story to the Tower of Babel, speaking of a God who, "in anger chased the builders away, broke down the building, and changed their language, so that they spoke diverse tongues".&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, R. W. (1933) ''Religious and Cosmic Beliefs of Central Polynesia'' (Cambridge), vol. I, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
In [[South Australia]], a people of [[Encounter Bay]] tell a story of how diversity in language came about from [[cannibalism]]:

:In remote time an old woman, named Wurruri lived towards the east and generally walked with a large stick in her hand, to scatter the fires around which others were sleeping, Wurruri at length died. Greatly delighted at this circumstance, they sent messengers in all directions to give notice of her death; men, women and children came, not to lament, but to show their joy. The Raminjerar were the first who fell upon the corpse and began eating the flesh, and immediately began to speak intelligibly. The other tribes to the eastward arriving later, ate the contents of the intestines, which caused them to speak a language slightly different. The northern tribes came last and devoured the intestines and all that remained, and immediately spoke a language differing still more from that of the Raminjerar.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, H. E. A., (1879) "Manners and Customs of the Aborigines of the Encounter Bay Tribe", published in Wood, D., et al., ''The Native Tribes of South Australia'', (Adelaide: E.S. Wigg &amp; Son) (available online [http://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/coll/special//SAhistory/Meyer.pdf here])&lt;/ref&gt;

Another group of [[Australian Aboriginal]] people, the [[Gunwinggu]], tell of a goddess in [[dreamtime]] giving each of her children a language of their own to play with.

===Andaman Islands===
The traditional beliefs of the indigenous inhabitants of the [[Andaman Islands]] in the [[Bay of Bengal]] describe language as being given by the god [[Pūluga]] to the first man and woman at their union following a great deluge. The language given was called ''bojig-yâb-'', which is the language spoken to this day, according to their belief, by the tribe inhabiting the south and south-eastern portion of middle [[Andaman Islands|Andaman]]. This language is described by the inhabitants as the "mother tongue" from which all other dialects have been made.

Their beliefs hold that even before the death of the first man,

:... his offspring became so numerous that their home could no longer accommodate them. At Pūluga's bidding they were furnished with all necessary weapons, implements, and fire, and then scattered in pairs all over the country. When this exodus occurred Puluga- provided each party with a distinct dialect.&lt;ref&gt;Man, E. H. (1883) "On the Aboriginal Inhabitants of the Andaman Islands. (Part II.)" in ''The Journal of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland'', Vol. 12, pp. 117–175.&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus explaining the diversity of language.

'''Neofeminism''' describes an emerging view of women as becoming empowered through the celebration of attributes perceived to be conventionally feminine, that is, it glorifies a womanly essence over claims to equality with men. It is a term that has come into use in the early 21st century to refer to a popular culture trend, what critics see as a type of "[[lipstick feminism]]" that confines women to stereotypical roles, while it erodes cultural freedoms women gained through the [[second-wave feminism]] of the 1960s and 1970s in particular. 

==Origins==
The term has been used since the beginning of [[second-wave feminism]] to refer broadly to any recent manifestation of feminist activism, mainly to distinguish it from the [[First-wave feminism]] of the [[suffragettes]]. It was used in the title of a best-selling 1982 book by Jacques J. Zephire about French feminist [[Simone de Beauvoir]], ''Le Neo-Feminisme de Simone de Beauvoir'' (Paris: Denoel/Gonthier 9782282202945). Zephir used the term to differentiate de Beauvoir's views from writers described as "Neofeminist", such as literary theorist [[Luce Irigaray]], who indicated in her own writing that women had an essentialist femininity that could express itself in ''[[écriture féminine]]'' (feminine writing/language), among other ways. Céline T. Léon has written, "one can only identify the existentialist's [de Beauvoir's] glorification of transcendence with the type of feminism that Luce Irigaray denounces in ''Ce sexe qui n'en est pas un'': "Woman simply equal to men would be like them and therefore not women"."{{page needed|date=July 2015}}

de Beauvoir's views were quite the opposite: {{blockquote|Over and against the neofeminists' attempts at getting rid of phallogocentrism and creating a new [feminine] writing style, she denounces as a contradiction this imprisonment of women in a ghetto of difference/singularity: "I consider it almost antifeminist to say that there is a feminine nature which expresses itself differently, that a woman speaks her body more than a man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leon|first=Celine T.|title=Feminist Interpretations of Simone de Beauvoir|year=2010|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|isbn=9780271041759|pages=150–2|editor=Margaret A. Simons}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Later writers and popular culture commentators appear to have continued this use of the term to describe essentialist feminism. It has been used by sociologists to describe a new popular culture movement that "celebrates both the feminine body and women's political achievements": {{blockquote|Women do and should realize their autonomy through their femininity. In its "''Elle'' magazine form" (Chollet 2004), Neofeminism champions the free choice of women in appearance, lifestyle, and sexuality. This consumerist orientation retains the advances of legal equality in political space but urges women to celebrate their femininity in their personal lives, a category that includes careers, clothing, and sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowen|first=John R.|title=Why the French Don't Like Headscarves: Islam, the State, and Public Space|year=2010|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9781400837564|page=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

==Other uses==
The term has also been equated with the [[New feminism]] described by Pope John Paul II. Feminist film scholar, Hilary Radner has used the term neo-feminism to characterized the iteration of feminism advocated by Hollywood's spate of romantic comedies inaugurated by ''Pretty Woman'' (Gary Marshall, 1990) often described as postfeminist. Radner argues that the origins of neo-feminism can be traced back to figures such as Helen Gurley Brown writing in the 1960s, meaning that the term postfeminism (suggesting that these ideas emerged after second wave feminism) is potentially misleading .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/526111216|title=Neo-feminist cinema : girly films, chick flicks and consumer culture|last=Hilary.|first=Radner,|date=2011|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415877732|location=New York|oclc=526111216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2072">In the [[Kuba Kingdom|Kuba]] region of the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], the belief in nature spirits, called ''ngesh'' or ''mingeh'', is widespread. Ngesh are believed to possess human characteristics, live near water sources in forests or villages, and may be encountered at any time.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Mack, John. "Animal Representations in Kuba Art: An Anthropological Interpretation of Sculpture" in ''Oxford Art Journal'', Vol. 4, No. 2, Sculpture (Nov., 1981), pp. 50-56. Published by: Oxford University PressArticle Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/1360140&lt;/ref&gt; Community residents know the name of local ''ngesh'' and their offspring. ''Ngesh'' impose themselves on various human affairs, including the control of harvest and the fertility of women.&lt;ref name="Binkley 2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Binkley|first=David A|title=Kuba|year=2009|publisher=5 Continents Edition|location=Milan|author2=Patricia Darish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each ''ngesh ''is named and distinguished from one another; the Kuba invest each ''ngesh'' with its own particular temperament, the likes and dislikes of which set off its volatile nature. The ''ngesh ''have their own individual character.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Ngesh and Kuba masquerade==
Origin stories for some [[Kuba masquerade]] traditions describe how the mask's creator first encountered an ''ngesh'' in the forest and, after a period of disorientation, returns home to carve a likeness of the ''ngesh''. While ''ngesh ''are rarely represented by figurative sculpture, they are thought to be personified in masquerade figures, which are in turn empowered by these nature spirits.

The potential for masked performers to become aggressive is a fundamental part of [[Kuba masquerade]],and it is a reflection of the influence of the unpredictable nature of ngesh on Kuba masked dancers. The association between ''ngesh'' and masquerade is also underscored by the strict rule that forbid spectators from touching the masks or coming to close to a masked dancer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7867">In [[Western classical music]], '''''obbligato''''' ({{IPA-it|obbliˈɡaːto}}, also spelled '''''obligato'''''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/obligato obligato] in dictionary at [[Merriam-Webster]] website&lt;/ref&gt;) usually describes a musical line that is in some way indispensable in performance. Its opposite is the marking ''[[ad libitum]]''. It can also be used, more specifically, to indicate that a passage of music was to be played exactly as written, or only by the specified instrument, without changes or omissions. The word is borrowed from Italian (an adjective meaning ''fixed''; from Latin ''obligatus'' p.p. of ''obligare'', to oblige); the spelling ''obligato'' is not acceptable in British English,&lt;ref&gt;"Obbligato" in ''The Oxford Dictionary of Music'', Oxford University Press: Michael Kennedy (ed.), 1985&lt;/ref&gt; but it is often used as an alternative spelling in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wordnik.com/words/obligato|title=Wordnik|author=|date=|website=Wordnik.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word can stand on its own, in English, as a noun, or appear as a modifier in a noun phrase (e.g. ''organ obbligato'').

==Independence==
''Obbligato'' includes the idea of independence, as in [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach|C.P.E. Bach]]'s 1780 Symphonies "''mit zwölf obligaten Stimmen''" ("with twelve ''obbligato'' parts") by which Bach was referring to the independent woodwind parts he was using for the first time. These parts were also ''obbligato'' in the sense of being indispensable.

==Continuo==
In connection with a keyboard part in the baroque period, ''obbligato'' has a very specific meaning: it describes a functional change from a ''[[basso continuo]]'' part (in which the player decided how to fill in the harmonies unobtrusively) to a fully written part of equal importance to the main melody part.

==Contradictory usage==
A later use has the contradictory meaning of ''optional'', indicating that a part was not obligatory.&lt;ref&gt;"Obbligato" in Lectionary of Music, Nicolas Slonimsky. McGraw-Hill {{ISBN|0-07-058222-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; A difficult passage in a concerto might be furnished by the editor with an easier alternative called the ''obbligato''; or a work may have a part for one or more solo instruments, marked ''obbligato'' (but more commonly and correctly termed an ''[[ossia]]''), that is decorative rather than essential; the piece is complete and can be performed without the added part.&lt;ref&gt;"Obbligato" in ''Collins Music Encyclopedia'', Westrup &amp; Harrison: Collins, London, 1959&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional term for such a part is ''[[ad libitum]]'', or ''ad lib.'', or simply ''optional'', since ''ad lib.'' may have a wide variety of interpretations.

==Contemporary usage==
In [[classical music]] the term has fallen out of use by modern-day practitioners, as composers, performers and audiences alike have come to see the musical text as paramount in decisions of musical execution. As a result, everything is now seen as ''obbligato'' unless explicitly specified otherwise in the score. It is still used to denote an orchestral piece with an instrumental solo part that stands out, but is not as prominent as in a solo concerto, as in Bloch's Concerto Grosso mentioned below. The term is now used mainly to discuss music of the past. One contemporary usage, however, is that by [[Erik Satie]] in the third movement of "''[[Embryons desséchés]]''" ("Desiccated Embryos"), where the ''obbligato'' consists of around twenty F-major chords played at [[Dynamics (music)|''fortissimo'']] (this is satirising Beethoven's symphonic style).

The term is also used with an entirely different meaning, signifying a [[countermelody]].

==Examples==

===Explicit instances===
*[[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]] used ''organ obbligato'' to show at a glance the importance of the organ part (in for example cantata ''[[Wer sich selbst erhöhet, der soll erniedriget werden, BWV 47]]'' and cantata ''[[Gott ist mein König, BWV 71]]'').

*[[John Philip Sousa]]'s march "[[The Stars and Stripes Forever]]" contains a ''piccolo obbligato'' in its ''grandioso''.

*[[Malcolm Arnold]]'s ''A Grand, Grand Overture'', Op. 57 (1956) is a 20th-century parody of the late 19th century concert overture, and contains ''obbligato'' parts for four rifles, three Hoover vacuum cleaners (two uprights in B{{music|flat}}, one horizontal with detachable sucker in C), and an electric floor polisher in E{{music|flat}}
*[[Benjamin Britten]]'s 1958 ''[[Nocturne for tenor, 7 obligato instruments &amp; strings]]'' in which the tenor soloist is accompanied by one or more ''obbligato'' instruments in each of the eight movements (apart from the first)
*[[Hector Berlioz]]'s ''[[Harold en Italie]]'' contains an extensive part for viola obbligato

'''Payola''', in the [[music industry]], is the [[Commercial bribery|illegal practice of payment]] or other inducement by record companies for the broadcast of recordings on [[music radio#Commercial radio|commercial radio]] in which the song is presented as being part of the normal day's broadcast, without announcing that there has been consideration paid in cash or in kind for its airplay adjacent to the recording's broadcast. Under US law, a radio station can play a specific song in exchange for money, but this must be disclosed on the air as being sponsored airtime.&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|47|317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has come to refer to any undisclosed payment made to cast a product in a favorable light (such as obtaining positive reviews). Some radio stations report spins of the newest and most popular songs to industry publications. The number of times the songs are played can influence the perceived popularity of a song.

The term ''payola'' is a combination of "pay" and "ola", a common suffix of product names in the early 20th century, such as [[Pianola]], [[Victrola]], [[Blue Amberol Records|Amberola]], [[Crayola]], [[Rock-Ola]], [[Shinola (shoe polish)|Shinola]], or brands such as the radio equipment manufacturer [[Motorola]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=payola&amp;searchmode=none|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Payola has come to mean the payment of a bribe in commerce and in law to say or do a certain thing against the rules of law, but more specifically a commercial bribe. The FCC defines "payola" as a violation of the sponsorship identification rule that in 2005-06 resulted in tens of millions of dollars in illegal fines to cable corporations in New York. {{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

== History {{anchor|PScandal}}== &lt;!-- This section is linked from the Rdr [[Payola scandal]] --&gt;

In earlier eras there was not much public scrutiny of the reasons songs became hits. The ad agencies which had sponsored NBC's radio/TV show ''[[Your Hit Parade]]'' for 20 years refused to reveal the specific methods that were used to determine top hits, only stating generally that they were based on "readings of radio requests, [[sheet music]] sales, [[dance hall]] favorites and [[jukebox]] tabulations".&lt;ref name="jdun"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dunning|first=John |title=On the air: the encyclopedia of old-time radio|publisher=Oxford University Press US|year=1998|edition=revised|pages=739|isbn=0-19-507678-8}}&lt;br&gt;Only a general statement that hit status was based on "readings of [[Request (broadcasting)|radio requests]], sheet music sales, dance hall favorites and jukebox tabulations"&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts to create a code to stop payola were met with mainly lukewarm silence by publishers.&lt;ref name="bb49"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=October 29, 1949|title=Pluggers war on old curse|journal=Billboard magazine|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|volume=61|issue=44|pages=3, 13, 47|issn=0006-2510}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prosecution for payola in the 1950s was in part a reaction of the traditional music establishment against newcomers.&lt;ref name="tcow"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cowen|first=Tyler |title=In praise of commercial culture|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2000|pages=164, 166|isbn=0-674-00188-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hit radio was a threat to the wages of [[song-plugger]]s.&lt;ref name="bb49"/&gt; Radio hits also threatened old revenue streams; for example, by the middle of the 1940s, three-quarters of the records produced in the USA went into jukeboxes.&lt;ref name="tcow"/&gt; Still, in the 1950s, independent record companies or music publishers frequently used payola to promote rock and roll on American radio; it promoted cultural diversity and disc jockeys were less inclined to indulge their own personal and racial biases.&lt;ref name="TylerCowen"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cowen|first=Tyler |title=In praise of commercial culture|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1998|pages=166, 167 |isbn=0-674-44591-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alan Freed]], a [[disc jockey]] and early supporter of rock and roll (and also widely credited for actually coining the term), had his career and reputation greatly harmed by a payola scandal. [[Dick Clark]]'s early career was nearly derailed by a payola scandal, but he avoided trouble by selling his stake in a record company and cooperating with authorities.&lt;ref&gt;"The Jordan brothers: A Musical Biography of Rock's Fortunate Sons", by Maxim W. Furek. Kimberley Press, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts were made to link all payola with rock and roll music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=Jan 16, 1960|title=Has payola cued a new inspirational wax kick?|journal=Billboard magazine|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=6|issn=0006-2510}} &lt;br/&gt;"Even now after the payola scandals and the attempt to link all payola with rock and roll recordings, the music with a beat still dominates over 60 percent of The Billboard's Hot 100 chart. This isn't to say that rock and roll isn't fading, or actually evolving into pop music, but .... "&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, inner-city urban soul DJ [[Frankie Crocker]] was indicted in a payola scandal, causing him to leave NY radio, where his influence was greatest. The charges were later dropped and he returned to NY, hosting MTV's video jukebox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/568/1049/288359/|title=United States of America v. Frankie Crocker, Appellant, 568 F.2d 1049 (3d Cir. 1977)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of money involved is largely unpublished; however, one DJ, Phil Lind of Chicago's [[WAIT (AM)|WAIT]], disclosed in [[Congressional hearing]]s that he had taken $22,000 to play a record.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Campbell et al, Media and Culture: An Introduction to Mass Communication, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue was featured in a 1978 episode of ''[[WKRP in Cincinnati]]'', where Johnny Fever's morning show replacement (when Johnny left to take a new job in Los Angeles) was caught taking [[cocaine]] as a bribe to play certain records from a label that he was associated.

Payola to DJs is less of a concern today because they rarely are involved in choosing the songs. Modern radio is widely based on company-delivered [[playlist]]s, often scheduling every song, commercial break, and DJ talk time, and most shows are pre-recorded well in advance of their broadcasts. Especially with shows that are [[voicetracking|voicetracked]] from elsewhere where an off-air assistant may choose the playlists rather than the DJs themselves, local radio staff have little to no input on a playlist outside of special but rare segments where a local artist might be spotlighted, or contests where local artists are offered the opportunity to open a station-sponsored concert or music festival for more well-known acts.

===Congressional payola investigations===
The Congressional Payola Investigations occurred in 1959, after the United States Senate began investigating the payola scandal. Among those thought to have been involved were DJ Alan Freed and television personality and host Dick Clark.&lt;ref name="clark" /&gt;

The term Congressional Payola Investigations refers to investigations by the [[House Subcommittee on Legislative Oversight]] into payola, the practice of record promoters paying DJs or radio programmers to play their labels' songs. Payola can refer to monetary rewards or other types of reimbursement, and is a tool record labels use to promote certain artists. Other forms of payola include making arrangements to purchase certain amounts of advertising in exchange for staying on a station's playlist, forcing bands to play station-sponsored concerts for little or no money in order to stay in a station's good graces, and paying for stations to hold "meet the band" contests, in exchange for air time for one of the label's newer, lesser-known bands.

The first major payola investigation occurred in the early 1960s. DJ Alan Freed, who was uncooperative in committee hearings, was fired as a result. Dick Clark also testified before the committee, but survived, partially due to the fact that he had divested himself of ownership interest in all of his music-industry holdings.

After the initial investigation, radio DJs were stripped of the authority to make programming decisions, and payola became a misdemeanor offense. Programming decisions became the responsibility of station program directors. As a result, the process of persuading stations to play certain songs was simplified. Instead of reaching numerous DJs, record labels only had to connect with one station program director.

Labels turned to independent promoters to circumvent allegations of payola. This practice grew more and more widespread until a 1986 NBC News investigation called "The New Payola" instigated another round of Congressional investigations.

With the creation of Napster and other now illegal music sharing websites, the power of the independent promoters began to decline. Labels once more began dealing with stations directly.

In 2002, investigations by the office of then-New York District Attorney Eliot Spitzer uncovered evidence that executives at Sony BMG music labels had made deals with several large commercial radio chains. In July 2005, the company acknowledged their improper promotional practices and agreed to pay a $10 million fine.

==Modus operandi==

===Third-party loophole===
A different form of payola has been used by the record industry through the loophole of being able to pay a third party or [[independent promoter|independent record promoters]] ("indies"; not to be confused with [[independent record label]]s), who will then go and "promote" those songs to radio stations. Offering the radio stations "promotion payments", the independents get the songs that their clients, record companies, want on the playlists of radio stations around the country.

This newer type of payola was an attempt to sidestep FCC regulations.&lt;ref&gt;Rachel M. Stilwell, "Which Public - Whose Interest - How the FCC's Deregulation of Radio Station Ownership Has Harmed the Public Interest, and How We Can Escape from the Swamp," 26 Loy. L.A. Ent. L. Rev. 369, 419-428, Mar. 1, 2006, available at: http://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1511&amp;context=elr.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the independent intermediaries were the ones actually paying the stations, it was thought that their inducements did not fall under the "payola" rules, so a radio station need not report them as paid promotions.

Former New York State Attorney General [[Eliot Spitzer]] prosecuted payola-related crimes in his jurisdiction. His office settled out of court with [[Sony BMG Music Entertainment]] in July 2005, [[Warner Music Group]] in November 2005 and [[Universal Music Group]] in May 2006. The three conglomerates agreed to pay $10 million, $5 million, and $12 million respectively to New York State non-profit organizations that will fund music education and appreciation programs. [[EMI]] remains under investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Radio Payoffs Are Described as Sony Settles |first=Jeff |last=Leeds |author2=Story, Louise |publisher=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/26/business/26music.html |date=2005-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=New Settlement in Payola Probe |first=Brian |last=Ross |author2=Walter, Vic |author3= Esposito, Richard  |publisher=ABC News |date=2006-05-11 |url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/theblotter/2006/05/new_settlement_.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concern about contemporary forms of payola prompted an investigation during which the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] established firmly that the "loophole" was still a violation of the law. In 2007, four companies ([[CBS Radio]], [[Citadel Broadcasting Corporation|Citadel]], [[Clear Channel]], and [[Entercom]]) settled on paying $12.5 million in fines and accepting tougher restrictions than the legal requirements for three years, although no company admitted any wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=FCC unveils settlement with radio firms |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/2007-04-13-2144814802_x.htm |first=John |last=Dunbar |publisher=USA Today |date=13 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the increased legal scrutiny, some larger radio companies (including industry giant [[iHeartMedia, Inc.|Clear Channel]]) now flatly refuse to have any contact with independent promoters.

Clear Channel Radio through [[iHeartRadio]] launched a program called ''On the Verge'' that required the stations to play a given song at least 150 times in order to give a new artist exposure. Brand managers at the top of the Clear Channel chain, after listening to hundreds of songs and filtering them down to about five or six favorites from various formats, send those selections to program directors across the country. These program directors vote on which ones they think radio listeners will like the most. One of the songs that benefited with the exposure was [[Iggy Azalea]]'s "Fancy". [[Tinashe]]'s "2 On", [[Anthony Lewis]]' "Candy Rain", and [[Jhené Aiko]]'s "The Worst", among others, have been featured on the program, however, those failed to duplicate Azalea's chart hit. Tom Poleman, president of national programming platforms for the company, stated that the acts selected are based solely on the quality of their music and not on label pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rollingout.com/entertainment/radio-stations-forced-play-iggy-azaleas-fancy-least-150-times/|title=Why radio stations were forced to play Iggy Azalea’s ‘Fancy’ at least 150 times|date=20 July 2014|publisher=|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2014/07/15/clear-channels-on-the-verge-program-helped-make-iggy-azalea-a-star-heres-how-it-works/?utm_term=.a8d77ce27b60 |title=Clear Channel’s ‘On the Verge’ program helped make Iggy Azalea a star. Here’s how it works. |work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[Spotify]], labels can pay for tracks to appear in user play-lists as "Sponsored Songs". It is possible to opt out of it using a setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/19/spotify-sponsored-content/|title=Spotify ‘Sponsored Songs’ lets labels pay for plays|first=Josh|last=Constine|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/19/15833880/spotify-sponsored-songs-playlists-test|title=Spotify is testing "Sponsored Songs" in playlists|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As money laundering scheme===
In Mexico, South America and some regions of the U.S. southern border, it is common to hear the sudden appearance of "new artists", mainly in folk radio stations, who are not known in the music industry, have no previous career and with no explanation of where they come from. These music groups and singers start to appear consistently on radio, television and public broadcasts with a strong promotion of their concerts. This happens for a fixed amount of time, and in the same sudden way they appear, they stop their promotion and disappear from the music scene, or change their stage name. Such artists are commonly manufactured by producers of dubious origin, who pay payola and do events in order to launder money from drug trafficking, prostitution or other illegal operations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zetatijuana.com/html/Edicion1888/Espectaculoz_Principal.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2003/01/18/06an1esp.php|title=La Jornada Virtu@l|publisher=|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Communications Act of 1934&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/fccs-payola-rules|title=Payola Rules}}&lt;/ref&gt; both have strict requirements and rules regarding the issue of payola. Both the FCC and the Act demand that "employees of broadcast stations, program producers, program suppliers and others who, in exchange for airing material, have accepted or agreed to receive payments, services or other valuable consideration must disclose this fact. Disclosure of compensation provides broadcasters the information they need to let their audiences know if material was paid for, and by whom." But even with these requirements in place, big-time record companies have found loopholes to continue the practice legally.

The reason why record companies have managed to find relatively big loopholes in an otherwise complex and strict document is because of the wording. According to the current regulations in place,  it is still considered legal to pay to play a particular song on the radio. The only hitch is that the broadcaster has to reveal who paid. In addition, the disclosures must be from DJ to station manager to program director and upwards. The loose wording has created a loophole that makes it easier for wealthy record company officials to pay the DJs large sums of money to play certain songs a certain number of times at a given time during the day. The loophole has created a "grey market, one in which shady, quasi-legal deals take place, and independent artists lose out more often than not."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The loophole has made it sure that independent artists will be isolated from mainstream media. And a current example of this is the lengths Macklemore and Ryan Lewis went to get their music heard. Because Lewis and Macklemore belonged to an independent label, they feared payola laws would interfere with their airtime. So they “hired an independent arm of Warner Music Group, the Alternative Distribution Alliance, which helps independent acts get their stuff on radio. Zach Quillen, manager of Macklemore and Ryan Lewis, discussed how "they paid the alliance a flat monthly fee to help promote the album."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/01/28/how-macklemore-tapped-major-label-muscle-to-market-an-indie-album|title=How Macklemore Tapped Major Label Muscle to Market an Indie Album}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One side effect of the vagueness of the law and the creation of the loophole is the expansion of the concept at the hands of online music sharing websites. In 2009, the website Jango created a plan to do payola legally by saying they have been paid to play the songs. "For as little as $30, a band can buy 1,000 plays on the music-streaming service, slotted in between established artists The artists themselves choose what other music they'd like to be played next to."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2009/apr/16/payola-internet-radio|title=Payola: Once a dirty word, now the basis of internet radio|work=The Guardian|date=16 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another side effect with payola is that it is not just limited to the music industry anymore. The TV industry has engaged in a form of payola with interviews. Networks deny paying for interviews, but are willing to pay large sums of money in cases that garner a lot of attention. An example is the [[Death of Caylee Anthony|Casey Anthony]] case in 2011. It was reported that [[ABC News]] paid Anthony around $200,000 for personal photographs.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

'''''Peter and the Shadow Thieves''''' is a [[children's novel]] that was published by [[Hyperion Books]], a subsidiary of [[The Walt Disney Company]], in 2006.  Written by [[humorist]] [[Dave Barry]] and [[novelist]] [[Ridley Pearson]], the book is a sequel to their book ''[[Peter and the Starcatchers]]'', continuing the story of the orphan Peter and his latest adventures with the Starcatchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bluerectangle.com/book_reviews/view_one_review/1959 |title= ''Peter and the Shadow Thieves'' |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another book, ''[[Peter and the Secret of Rundoon]]'', continues the "Starcatchers" series, which serve as a [[prequel]] to [[J.M. Barrie]]'s classic novel ''[[Peter and Wendy]]''.  It was illustrated by artist [[Greg Call]].  Hyperion has also begun a series of [[chapter book]]s by these creators, which spin off from the series, called the [[Never Land Books]].  In May 2008 the writers announced a fourth book: ''[[Peter and the Sword of Mercy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ridleypearson.com/appearances.html Pearson's web site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511213832/http://www.ridleypearson.com/appearances.html |date=2008-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.davebarry.com/books.html Barry's web site]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
The book starts three months after the end of ''Peter and the Starcatchers''.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 13&lt;/ref&gt; Slank returns to the island with more of the Others, including a certain Lord Ombra, to reclaim the trunk of starstuff lost in the previous book. When they learn that the Starcatchers have taken the trunk back to England, they set sail for London. Peter follows, fearing for Molly's safety, and with Tinker Bell's help conceals himself on their ship.

Once in London, Peter does not know where to find Molly. After unpleasant encounters with [[beggar]]s, [[trade]]rs and the [[police]], Peter finally gets directions from [[J. M. Barrie]] to Lord Aster's house, and rescues Molly from Lord Ombra in the nick of time. However, Louise Aster (Molly's mother) has been kidnapped by the Others, and the children must find Lord Aster who is guarding the starstuff.

Meanwhile, back on the island, the pirates are hunting the Lost Boys. They capture the boys to use as bait for Peter, not knowing he is not on the island.

After Molly and Peter's escape, Molly takes Peter to her old best friend's house, where she introduces Peter to George, who soon become acquaintances. They begin to search for the site of which the "Return", a mystical taking a starstuff, occurs. Molly, Peter and George eventually go by themselves due to Aster's cautions, and are all nearly killed. In the end, Louise is rescued and the Return takes place, and Peter inadvertently destroys Ombra in the process. He eventually returns to his island and rescues the Lost Boys from Hook's capture.

==Characters==
Many of the characters from ''Peter and the Starcatchers'' are back for this sequel. However, a few characters are also mentioned in ''Peter Pan and Wendy'', and some were created exclusively for ''Peter and the Shadow Thieves''.

*'''[[Peter Pan|Peter]]''' has gained the permanent ability to fly and to never physically grow older because of his exposure to starstuff. Peter has red hair. Growing cocky from his new abilities, he torments Captain Hook. When Hook captures one of Peter's friends, James, Peter vows to become more mature. So, when he learns his friend Molly will be in danger, because Lord Ombra will use her to exchange the starstuff, stating that fathers have soft spots for their daughters, he immediately sets out to save her. He is more than a little disturbed that she has a male friend named George Darling. Peter is accompanied in his adventures by his guardian Tinker Bell, a small fairy or "birdwoman", who is very protective of Peter.
*'''[[Tinker Bell]]''' was originally a green-and-yellow-coloured bird put in a bag of starstuff and was made into the guardian of Peter by Molly's father, the famous starcatcher, Lord Leonard Aster. She hates when she is called a fairy, because she would much rather be called "birdwoman" because it supports her heritage. She is very protective of Peter, she supremely dislikes when Peter pays attention to any other female, she calls the mermaid, Teacher, "a big fat grouper", tends to hope she gets eaten by an octopus, and Molly Aster as "a stupid fat cow". She is able to emit a very bright light. This helps Peter many times against Lord Ombra, though this technique often ends in her exhaustion and sometimes fainting.
*'''Molly Aster''', daughter to the great Starcatcher Leonard Aster, looks a lot like her mother, with long brown hair, but inherited her father's startling green eyes. London society views her as a beautiful child, but also unusual, seeing as she is not interested in the things girls her class are into, and appears have her mind is always thinking of something else. When her father leaves to move a great amount of starstuff to a safe location, she is left behind as company for her mother. Soon, Molly learns that her house is invaded by spies, and that the creature Lord Ombra wants to steal her family's shadows. Molly sets off with Peter to continue protecting the starstuff, even at the cost of her mother's life. Molly lives in a mansion near Kensington Gardens, and she is a childhood friend to George Darling. They both have feelings for each other, as hinted in this book, and don't know how or whether to express their feelings. It is hinted she also has feelings for Peter.
*'''[[Peter Pan's Lost Boys|The Lost Boys]]''' (first called Lost Boys in ''Peter and the Shadow Thieves'') were originally orphans from St. Norbert's Home for Wayward Boys. James is leader to Thomas, Prentiss, and Tubby Ted when Peter is not around. The Lost Boys discover their underground home in this book—they are also captured and nearly killed by Captain Hook, but manage to escape.
*'''[[Captain Hook]]''', formerly Black Stache, is a disgusting, filthy pirate, captain of the ship, the ''Jolly Roger''. As his left hand was cut off by Peter, he replaced it with a hook-shaped dagger, earning his nickname from Peter. Annoyed by Peter's constant teasing, Hook tries unsuccessfully to use the Lost Boys as a ransom. He can not bear to leave his newly built fortress, for fear of being eaten by the huge [[crocodile]], Mr. Grin.
*'''Mr. Slank''' is the evil sailor from the ''Never Land'', returning from the first book. Slank is one of the "Others" who use starstuff corruptly, and he has joined forces with the creature Lord Ombra to avenge his humiliation by Peter. In ''Starcatchers'', Slank had a sidekick named Little Richard. Slank had to kill Richard and eat him in order to survive for months in an adrift rowboat. His fate is unknown after the encounter with Starcatchers.
*'''Lord Ombra''' is the new villain in this novel. He is part man, part shadow, and he moves like liquid. He causes a chill to come over anyone he nears, because he is able to steal their shadow or possess them to read their thoughts and enslave them. Ombra is afraid of the light, but it aids him in capturing shadows. He is one of the greater "Others". Lord Ombra is destroyed by a brilliant flash of light that breaks him into millions of tiny shadows. The name ''Ombra'' is derived from the Italian word for "shadow".{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}
*'''Captain Nerezza''' is captain of the ship ''Le Fantome'', and he is one of the "Others" who uses starstuff for evil. Nerezza takes Lord Ombra and Slank from England and back again in search of starstuff. One important feature of Nerezza is he has no nose—it was cut off in Africa, but replaced by a wooden nose carved from blackwood and held on with a leather strap. Nerezza is able to smell by lifting the false nose and breathing through a hole in his face. The name ''Nerezza'' is derived from the Italian word for "blackness".{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}
*'''[[George Darling (Peter Pan)|George Darling]]''' is Molly Aster's London friend, and he grows up to become the father of Wendy, John, and Michael. George apparently has feelings for Molly, but he finds her changed since she returned from her voyage at sea. He is very loyal, and allows even Peter to stay in his room without his parents' knowledge. George is most likely featured in this novel because in Disney's 1953 film, Mr. Darling mentions meeting Peter Pan "a long time ago, when I was very young".
*'''Lord Leonard Aster and Lady Louise Aster''', Molly's parents, live in a mansion near Kensington Gardens. Molly's father is an ambassador to King Zarboff III of Rundoon, but he is secretly one of the greatest Starcatchers. Leonard jeopardizes the mission of returning the starstuff at Stonehenge, because his wife and daughter are about to be killed. Leonard himself is shot in ''Shadow Thieves'', but Peter heals him with a bit of starstuff. Louise Aster is Molly's mother, who is left behind with her daughter when her husband leaves to look after the starstuff. Lady Aster's shadow is stolen by Lord Ombra, and her corpse-like body is used to lure Molly out of hiding. Louise Aster's shadow is returned by the end of the novel.

There is one point in the book where the authors introduce J.M. Barrie.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 54&lt;/ref&gt; He gives Peter directions to Molly's house by saying "…it's the second path to the right and straight on until you hit the white house with two towers." It plays on the directions to Never Land in ''[[Peter and Wendy]]'', "…the second star to the right and straight on till morning."

==Differences from the works of Barry==

:''See [[Peter and the Starcatchers#Differences from the works of Barrie]]''
Ombra is actually derived from the Latin word ''umbra'', meaning shadow or ghost.

It is estimated to have been spoken about 7,000 years ago somewhere in the American Northwest, possibly around the Columbia Plateau.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Bakker, ''Diachrony and typology in the history of Cree'', in ''Diachronic and typological perspectives on verbs''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Proulx Phonological Sketch"&gt;Paul Proulx, ''Proto-Algic I: Phonological Sketch'', in the ''International Journal of American Linguistics'', volume 50, number 2 (April 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Proulx, ''Algic Color Terms'', in ''Anthropological Linguistics'', volume 30, number 2 (Summer 1988)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Proulx, ''Proto-Algic IV: Nouns'', in ''Studies in Native American Languages VII'', volume 17, number 2 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; It is an example of a second-level proto-language (a proto-language whose reconstruction depends on data from another proto-language, namely its daughter language [[Proto-Algonquian language|Proto-Algonquian]]) which is widely agreed to have existed.&lt;ref name="Proulx Phonological Sketch"/&gt; Its chief researcher was [[Paul Proulx]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amherst.edu/amherst-story/magazine/in_memory/1965/paul-m.-proulx-65] Amherst Obituary for Paul Proulx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vowels==

Proto-Algic had four basic vowels, which could be either long or short:
:long: *i·, *e·, *a·, *o·
:short: *i, *e, *a, *o

==Consonants==

Proto-Algic had the following consonants:

:&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; The identity of this consonant is not entirely certain; in Proto-Algonquian, it is sometimes alternatively reconstructed as ''θ'' /θ/.

It is unclear if ''č'' /tʃ/ was an independent phoneme or only an allophone of ''c'' and/or ''t'' in Proto-Algic (as in Proto-Algonquian). In 1992, [[Paul Proulx]] theorized that Proto-Algic also possessed a phoneme ''gʷ'', which became *''w'' in Proto-Algonquian and ''g'' in Wiyot and Yurok.

All stops and affricates in the above chart have aspirated counterparts, and all consonants, except fricatives, have glottalized ones. [[Proto-Algonquian]] significantly reduced this system by eliminating all glottalized and aspirated phonemes.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Proulx, Proto-Algic I: Phonological Sketch, in the International Journal of American Linguistics, volume 50, number 2 (April 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4520">[[File:Silk Loom Jim Thompson House photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|170px|Thai women wearing sabai, [[Jim Thompson House]]]]

'''Sabai or''' '''sbai''' ({{lang-km|ស្បៃ}}; {{lang-th|สไบ}}, {{RTGS|''sabai''}}, {{IPA-th|sābāj|pron}}; {{lang-lo|ສະໄບ}}), or '''phaa biang''' ({{lang-lo|ຜ້າບ່ຽງ}}; {{lang-th|ผ้าเบี่ยง}}, {{IPA-th|pʰâː bìa̯ŋ|pron}}) is shawl-like garment, or breast cloth worn in [[mainland Southeast Asia]]. The term "Sabai" is used for a woman's silk breast wrapper in [[Cambodia]], [[central Thailand]], [[southern Thailand]], [[northern Thailand]], [[Isan]], and [[Laos]] while in coastal Sumatra it is described as a shoulder cloth.&lt;ref name=Maxwell&gt;Robyn J. Maxwell, Mattiebelle Gittinger, ''Textiles of Southeast Asia: Tradition, Trade and Transformation''&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|410}} A Sabai can also be worn by men in Lao weddings or when attending religious ceremonies. The type of Sabai typically worn by Lao men often has checkered patterns. Sabai also well known as a long piece of silk, about a foot wide, draped diagonally over the chest covering one shoulder with one end dropping behind the back."&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie Ghazarbekian, Jane Siegel, ''Sawaddi, 15 years'', p.130.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Femme-serail.jpg|thumb|left|upright|150px|A Khmer lady dressed in a sabai across her left shoulder covered with the popular ornamental chain called "cheang", with traditional "[[chang kben]]", c. late-1800s.]]
[[File:Kmer Dance..JPG|right|thumb|150px|A Khmer female dancer wearing a rich-decorative sabai on her right shoulder along with [[Chang kben|sampot chang kben]].]]

Along with the shoulder sash, ''selendang'' of [[Malaysia|Malay]] and Sabai of [[Cambodia]] and [[Thailand]] may have been derived from the [[India]]n garment called a [[sari]], the end of which is worn over one shoulder&lt;ref name="Maxwell" /&gt;{{RP|153}}, as most [[Southeast Asia]] countries were ruled by [[Indianized kingdoms]].

There are related mythologies in the [[Culture of Cambodia|Khmer culture]] concerning the history of Sabai, which was likely invented during the [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan]] era in [[History of Cambodia|Cambodia's history]], in the 1st century AD. The Sabai is mentioned in [[Preah Thaong and Neang Neak]], a legend with the founders of the Kingdom of Funan as the two main characters. In one scene, Preah Thong clings to a piece of cloth known worn on the Nagini in order to make the journey to the [[Nāga]]'s kingdom; that piece of cloth is a Sabai. In that tale, Sabai is symbolic of Neang Neak, the Naga princess's tail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trustedcambodiatours.com/tours_detail.php?id=39 Khmer Traditional Wedding]&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, there is an important little rite within the marriage ceremony called Preah Thong Taong Sbai Neang Neak, a symbolic representation of the legend as the groom must to hang on to the bride's Sabai as they go to their room for the honeymoon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambodianscene.com/index.php?target=article&amp;title=women Cambodian history rich with female role-models and rulers]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, according to illustrations in temples since the beginning of [[Khmer Empire]] rule, most [[Apsara]] seemed to have left the upper body nude, wearing only Khmer traditional sarong kor and their style of [[Sampot]]. Sabai may reflect the clothing of Buddhist monks whose robes also have one end hanging over a shoulder. Beginning from [[Ponhea Yat]] of the [[Phnom Penh|Chatomok era]], the court lady is known to have worn the Sabai.&lt;ref name="Maxwell" /&gt;{{RP|374}}. The Sabai is [[Cambodia]]'s national costume together with the ancient [[Sampot|sampot]] and [[Chang kben|chang kben]].

Archaeological evidence from a [[Mon people|Mon]] [[Dvaravati]] site depicts five ladies playing instruments and wearing what seems to be a piece of fabric hanging from their shoulder which is quite similar to Sabai.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chatnirun.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Poon1.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mon people|Mon]] [[Dvaravati]] culture practices [[Theravada]] Buddhism which later influenced the [[Tai peoples|Tai]] in the 13th century.

'''''Santiniketan: The Making of a Contextual Modernism''''' was an exhibition curated by [[R. Siva Kumar]] at the [[National Gallery of Modern Art]] in 1997, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of India's Independence.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aaa.org.hk/Collection/Details/48720&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhibition, through bringing about a hundred works each of four modern Indian artists, namely [[Nandalal Bose]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Ram Kinker Baij]] and [[Benode Behari Mukherjee]] on the centre stage, put the Santiniketan art movement into focus.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1418/14180690.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Kumar argues that the "Santiniketan artists did not believe that to be indigenous one has to be historicist either in theme or in style, and similarly to be modern one has to adopt a particular trans-national formal language or technique. Modernism was to them neither a style nor a form of internationalism. It was critical re-engagement with the foundational aspects of art necessitated by changes in one’s unique historical position".&lt;ref&gt;http://humanitiesunderground.org/all-the-shared-experiences-of-the-lived-world-ii/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contextual modernism==
The year 1997 bore witness to two parallel gestures of canon formation. On the one hand, the Baroda Group, a coalition whose original members included [[Vivan Sundaram]], [[Ghulam Mohammed Sheikh]], [[Bhupen Khakhar]], and [[Nalini Malani]]—and which had left its mark on history in the form of the 1981 exhibition "Place for People"—was definitively historicized in 1997 with the publication of Contemporary Art in Baroda, an anthology of essays edited by Sheikh. On the other hand, the art historian Kumar’s exhibition and related publication, ''A Contextual Modernism'', focused on the [[Santiniketan]] artists [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Nandalal Bose]], [[Benode Behari Mukherjee]], and [[Ramkinkar Baij]]. Of the Santiniketan artists, Kumar observed that they "reviewed traditional antecedents in relation to the new avenues opened up by cross-cultural contacts. They also saw it as a historical imperative. Cultural insularity, they realized, had to give way to eclecticism and cultural impurity."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nyu.edu/greyart/publications/AbbyGreyAndIndianModernism_GreyNYU_20150116.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kumar "The Santiniketan artists were one of the first who consciously challenged this idea of modernism by opting out of both internationalist modernism and historicist indigenousness and tried to create a context sensitive modernism."&lt;ref&gt;http://humanitiesunderground.org/all-the-shared-experiences-of-the-lived-world-ii/&lt;/ref&gt;

The literary critic [[Ranjit Hoskote]] while reviewing the works of contemporary artist [[Atul Dodiya]] writes, "The exposure to Santinketan, through a literary detour, opened Dodiya’s eyes to the historical circumstances of what Kumar has called a “contextual modernism” developed in eastern India in the 1930s and ’40s during the turbulent decades of the global Depression, the Gandhian liberation struggle, the Tagorean cultural renaissance and World War II."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tehelka.com/creator-of-a-floating-world/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contextual modernism and the Bengal School of Art==
{{Culture of Bengal}}
Kumar had been studying the work of the Santiniketan masters and thinking about their approach to art since the early 1980s. The practice of subsuming [[Nandalal Bose]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Ram Kinker Baij]] and [[Benode Behari Mukherjee]] under the [[Bengal School of Art]] was misleading. According to Kumar, "this happened because early writers were guided by genealogies of apprenticeship rather than their styles, worldviews, and perspectives on art practice".&lt;ref&gt;http://humanitiesunderground.org/all-the-shared-experiences-of-the-lived-world-ii/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Santiniketan: art movement and school==
{{History of art sidebar}}
Kumar draws distinction between ''Santiniketan the art movement'' and ''Santiniketan the School'':

{{Quotation| I am not sure, however, if everyone noticed the distinction I drew between Santiniketan as an art movement and Santiniketan as a school very clearly. There was both a Santiketan movement and a Santiniketan school, but these are two different things. The movement was shaped by the practices of the masters, chiefly Nandalal, Benodebehari, Ramkinkar and Rabindranath. Their art practices were interrelated but did not stylistically converge. They were linked more by concerns and as participants in a discourse to which each contributed in a different manner. They themselves saw this very clearly but many who wrote about them did not. They either plumped for Nandalal and Benodebehari, or for Ramkinkar and Rabindranath; one pair representing a traditionalist position and the other a modernist position. I am not suggesting that there are no differences between them but that they saw themselves as co-authors of an art scene being essayed around shared issues, complementing each other and expanding their concerns and reach rather than at war with each other.|''ALL THE SHARED EXPERIENCES OF THE LIVED WORLD &lt;ref&gt;http://humanitiesunderground.org/all-the-shared-experiences-of-the-lived-world-ii/&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==The shared perspectives==
{{Quotation|The brief survey of the individual works of the core Santiniketan artists and the thought perspectives they open up makes clear that though there were various contact points in the work they were not bound by a continuity of style but by a community of ideas. Which they not only shared but also interpreted and carried forward. Thus they do not represent a school but a movement.|''Santiniketan: The Making of a Contextual Modernism, 1997}}

[[File:Vegetables and ornamental plants in SELROSLT's Rutland-Washington Garden.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Vegetables and ornamental plants in  SELROSLT's Rutland-Washington Garden.]]

The '''South End Lower Roxbury Open Space Land Trust''' &lt;small&gt;(SELROSLT)&lt;/small&gt; is a membership-supported, non-profit organization that owns, protects, and manages 16 [[community garden]]s and [[pocket park]]s in the [[South End, Boston, Massachusetts|South End]] and [[Roxbury, Massachusetts|Lower Roxbury]] neighborhoods of [[Boston]], in the U.S. state of [[Massachusetts]]. It is a member of the [[American Community Gardening Association]], the [[Boston Natural Areas Network]], the [[Land Trust Alliance]], and a partnering grantee of the New England Grassroots Environment Fund.

In July 2012, SELROSLT officially voted to merge with, and was absorbed by [[Boston Natural Areas Network]].

==Mission==
The South End Lower Roxbury Open Space Land Trust works to acquire, own, improve, and maintain open space for community gardening and pocket parks in the South End and Lower Roxbury neighborhoods of Boston for the public benefit in perpetuity.

==History==
The Land Trust was established in 1991 with the intent to incorporate and protect eight established community gardens. The existing gardens were owned by a variety of institutions, none of them with long term legal protection. The legal incorporation as a non-profit organization with an elected board composed of neighbors created an entity that was able to partner with [[The Trust for Public Land]] to purchase the range of properties from a variety of owners, and set in place a process to use and care for the gardens in perpetuity. Many of the original eight gardens were primarily food producing, helping to augment the budgets of low and moderate-income urban families. Land Trust gardens continue to be places of food production, as well as gardeners growing ornamental plants.

&lt;small&gt;SELROSLT&lt;/small&gt;held and operated sixteen community gardens, gardened by approximately 600 gardeners, and accessible to their adjacent neighborhoods. Individual gardens have received awards from the [[Massachusetts Horticultural Society]], the City of Boston, and ''Horticulture'' magazine. Three &lt;small&gt;SELROSLT&lt;/small&gt; community gardens have been the subject of the nationally distributed [[WGBH-TV|WGBH-produced]] program [[The Victory Garden (TV series)|The Victory Garden]].

In July 2012, after a year of joint planning, &lt;small&gt;SELROSLT&lt;/small&gt; voted to merge into [[Boston Natural Areas Network]] (BNAN).  The time had come for &lt;small&gt;SELROSLT&lt;/small&gt; to move from an all volunteer organization to an organization that provided full-time staff and greater resources.  The merger gives the community gardens access the resources of BNAN, and their affiliate [[The Trustees of Reservations]].  The deeds for all &lt;small&gt;SELROSLT&lt;/small&gt; community spaces were all transferred to BNAN, ensuring the protection of community gardens and open spaces in perpetuity.

==Membership==
Membership is open to individuals and families interested in urban gardening. Each community garden maintains a waiting list. Most individual community gardens have a membership committee which manages the waiting list, works with the garden's leadership committee, and helps orient new gardeners to the garden. Waiting periods vary by garden and there are no statistics available on wait time. Members pay an annual plot fee, and an additional Land Trust membership fee. Costs are moderate, and payable on a sliding fee. Members may vote at an annual meeting, participate on committees, and are required to maintain their plot in a clean and productive state.

==Gardening==
Plot sizes vary from {{convert|5|by|9|ft|m|abbr=on|1}} to {{convert|14|by|28|ft|m|abbr=on|1}}. Gardening members come from the immediately adjoining neighborhoods. Individual gardens vary greatly in what is grown and harvested. Located in two diverse urban neighborhoods, a wide variety of food, flowers and plant material is grown based somewhat on ethnicity, ancestry, or if a gardener is a recent immigrant, their home country. Land Trust rules allow individual garderns to grow whatever they choose in their plot as long as it is not grown for commercial sale. Most garderners grow a mix of vegetables and ornamentals. A few of the gardens operate a composting system to convert discarded plant material to soil and fertilizer. Roughly half of the gardens have perimeter borders termed community borders, which are planted with ornamental plants, flowers and small shrubs.

==Funding and operations==
The Land Trust operates with funds raised through garden plot fees, fundraising activities including the annual South End Garden Tour, and varied other events. Additional funds from private and public sources, via direct grants, have contributed over $1,000,000. Funds have been used to provide water systems, decontaminate soils, to install consistent iron fencing and granite curbing, and to build gazebo community spaces in the local gardens.

==Governance==
Each of the community gardens elects or appoints a representative to the &lt;small&gt;SELROSLT &lt;/small&gt; board. The board elects a president from membership. The president is a volunteer position, focused on day-to-day operations of the gardens, coordination with the City of Boston and membership. The individual community gardens send plot fees to the Land Trust to pay liability insurance and water service. Individual gardens are intended to be democratically self-governing, and the form of governance varies from garden to garden. Some gardens elect a coordinator, or two coordinators; others elect a leadership committee.

'''Takalo''' is the performing of a traditional [[Niue]] war dance by an individual warrior or group of warriors prior to engaging the enemy in warfare between warriors using traditional war clubs.  In modern times, the takalo is often performed prior to a rugby game or winning a game of some sport code.  The takalo is also performed to welcome dignitaries as soon as they land in Niue, persons of high status like prime ministers, presidents and governors general – it signifies that the dignitaries' arrival is for the purpose of peace and harmony.

[[File:TheAscentOfF6.jpg|thumb|First UK edition]]

'''''The Ascent of F6: A Tragedy in Two Acts''''', by [[W. H. Auden]] and [[Christopher Isherwood]], was the second and most successful play in the Auden-Isherwood collaboration, first published in 1936. It was a major contribution to English poetic drama in the 1930s. It has been seen as a parable about will, leadership and the nature of power: matters of increasing concern in Europe as that decade progressed.&lt;ref&gt;M. Drabble, J. Stringer, and D. Hahn, ''The Concise Oxford Companion to English Literature'', 3rd edition, 2007.[http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095427800 (extract)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==

The play tells the story of Michael Ransom, a climber, who, against his better judgement, accepts the offer of the British press and government to sponsor an expedition to the peak of F6, a mountain on the border of a British colony and a colony of the fictional country of Ostnia. Ransom is destroyed by his haste to complete the expedition ahead of the Ostnian climbers.

==Background==

The play is widely regarded as an allegory of Auden's own temptation to be a public figure; this interpretation was first offered by [[R. G. Collingwood]] in ''The Principles of Art'' (1938).

The play was published in three slightly different versions: the first English edition in 1936, the American edition in 1937, and a second English edition in 1937.

The play is dedicated to Auden's geologist brother [[John Bicknell Auden]] who had taken part in an expedition near  the [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] mountain [[K2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Stearn, Roger T. |chapter=Auden, John Bicknell (1903–1991)|title= Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher= Oxford University Press|year=2004 | doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/53476}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Auden personally invited [[Benjamin Britten]] to write the incidental music for the play. Britten composed the music in February 1937, the month of the play's first production, including a choral setting of "Stop all the clocks" (titled "[[Funeral Blues]]").&lt;ref name=Britten1487/&gt;

==Production history==
The play was first produced at the [[Mercury Theatre, Notting Hill Gate|Mercury Theatre]], London on 26 February 1937, with incidental music by Benjamin Britten conducted from the piano by [[Brian Easdale]].&lt;ref name=Britten1487&gt;Mitchell, ''Letters from a Life'', Vol. 1: p. 487&lt;/ref&gt; Directed by [[Rupert Doone]],&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, ''Britten'': p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; the cast included [[William Devlin (actor)|William Devlin]] as Michael Ransom, Dorothy Holmes-Gore as Mrs Ransom, and [[Hedli Anderson]] as the Singer.&lt;ref name=Britten1487/&gt; After its initial run, ''The Ascent of F6'' received 17 performances over the next two years.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; It was broadcast live by the [[BBC]] on the 31st May 1937 in the early days of television with William Devlin again playing Michael Ransom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ascent Of F.6., The (BBC 1937 with William Devlin and Barry Barnes)|url=http://www.memorabletv.com/tv/ascent-of-f-6-the-bbc-1937-with-william-devlin-and-barry-barnes/|website=Memorable TV|accessdate=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

although the adaptation did not ultimately emerge.

==Setting==
''The Diamond Age'' depicts a near-future world revolutionised by advances in [[nanotechnology]], much as [[Eric Drexler]] envisioned it in his nonfiction book ''[[Engines of Creation]]'' (1986). Molecular nanotechnology is omni-present in the novel's world, generally in the form of [[molecular assembler|Matter Compilers]] and the products that come out of them.  The book explicitly recognizes the achievements of several existing nanotechnology researchers: [[Richard Feynman|Feynman]], [[K. Eric Drexler|Drexler]] and [[Ralph Merkle|Merkle]] are seen among characters of the fresco in Merkle-Hall, where new nanotechnological items are designed and constructed.

The book contains descriptions of various exotic technologies, such as the ''chevaline'' (a mechanical horse that can fold up and is light enough to be carried one-handed), and forecasts the use of technologies that are in development today, such as [[Electronic paper|smart paper]] that can show personalized news headlines. Major cities have immune systems made up of [[aerostat]]ic defensive micromachines, and public matter compilers provide basic food, blankets, and water [[Post-scarcity|for free to anyone who requests them]].

Matter compilers receive their raw materials from the Feed, a system analogous to the electrical grid of modern society.  The Feed carries streams of both energy and basic [[molecules]], which are rapidly assembled into usable goods by matter compilers. The Source, where the Feed's stream of matter originates, is controlled by the Victorian [[phyle]] (though smaller, independent Feeds are possible).  The hierarchic nature of the Feed and an alternative, anarchic developing technology, known as the Seed, mirror the cultural conflict between East and West that is depicted in the book.  This conflict has an economic element as well, with the Feed representing a centrally-controlled distribution mechanism, while the Seed represents a more flexible, open-ended, decentralized method of creation and organization.

===Phyles===
Society in ''The Diamond Age'' is dominated by a number of ''phyles,'' also sometimes called ''tribes.''  Phyles are groups of people often distinguished by shared [[values]], similar [[ethnic]] heritage, a common religion, or other cultural similarities.  In the extremely [[Globalization|globalized]] future depicted in the novel, these cultural divisions have largely supplanted the system of [[nation-states]] that divides the world today.  Cities in ''The Diamond Age'' appear divided into sovereign [[enclaves]] affiliated or belonging to different phyles within a single metropolis. Most phyles depicted in the novel have a global scope of sovereignty, and maintain segregated enclaves in or near many cities throughout the world.

The phyles coexist much like historical nation-states under a system of justice and mutual protection, known as the [[Common Economic Protocol]] (CEP). The rules of the CEP are intended to provide for the co-existence of, and peaceful economic activity between, phyles with potentially very different values.  The CEP is concerned particularly with upholding rights to [[personal property]], being shown to provide particularly harsh punishment for harming the economic capability of another person. The role of the CEP in the world of the novel could be seen in comparison with the roles of real-life international organizations such as the United Nations and the [[International Monetary Fund]].

"Thetes" are individuals who are not members of any phyle and are often socially disadvantaged and economically poor, being similar to second-class citizens under the CEP.  In the novel, the material needs of nearly all thetes are satisfied by freely-available food and clothing, albeit of low quality; thetes without the political connections of a phyle are entitled to similarly low-quality "[[legal aid|free justice]]."

The book distinguishes three Great Phyles: the Han (consisting of [[Han Chinese]]), the [[Neo-Victorian]] New Atlantis (consisting largely of [[Anglo-Saxons]], but also accepting Indians, Africans and other members of the [[Anglosphere]] who identify with the culture) and Nippon (consisting of Japanese). The novel raises the question as to whether Hindustan (consisting of [[Hindu]] [[India]]ns) is a fourth Great Phyle, or a "riotously diverse collection of microtribes sintered together according to some formula we don't get."

Internally, the New Atlantis phyle is a [[Oligarchy#Corporate Oligarchy .28Corporatocracy.29|corporate oligarchy]] whose "equity lords" rule the organization and its bylaws under allegiance to the vestigial [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarchy]]. Other phyles are less defined – some intentionally, as with the CryptNet group or the mysterious hive-mind Drummers. Over the course of the story, the Common Economic Protocol sponsors the investigation of clandestine Seed technologies in order to preserve the established order from subversion, using the justification that unrestricted access to Sources would lead to the proliferation of high tech weapons and result in anarchy. It is also hinted that property rights are so expansive that the Protocol recognizes children as the economic assets of their parents.

==Plot summary==
The [[protagonist]] in the story is Nell, a ''thete'' (or person without a tribe; equivalent to the lowest working class) living in the Leased Territories, a lowland slum built on the artificial, [[diamondoid]] island of New Chusan, located offshore from the mouth of the [[Yangtze River]], northwest of Shanghai.&lt;ref&gt;Stephenson, ''The Diamond Age'' (1995):66.&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of four, Nell receives a stolen copy of an interactive book, ''Young Lady's Illustrated [[wikt:primer#Noun|Primer]]: a [[wikt:propaedeutic|Propædeutic]] [[wikt:enchiridion|Enchiridion]], in which is told the tale of Princess Nell and her various friends, kin, associates, &amp;c.'',&lt;ref&gt;Stephenson, ''The Diamond Age'' (1995):184.&lt;/ref&gt;  originally intended for the wealthy Neo-Victorian "Equity Lord" Alexander Chung-Sik Finkle-McGraw's granddaughter. The story follows Nell's development under the tutelage of the Primer, and to a lesser degree, the lives of Elizabeth and Fiona,  girls who receive similar books. The Primer is intended to steer its reader intellectually toward a more ''interesting life,'' as defined by "Equity Lord" Alexander Chung-Sik Finkle-McGraw,&lt;ref&gt;Stephenson, ''The Diamond Age''(1995):24.&lt;/ref&gt; and growing up to be an effective member of society.  The most important quality to achieving an "interesting life" is deemed to be a subversive attitude towards the [[status quo]]. The Primer is designed to react to its owner's environment and teach them what they need to know to survive and develop.

''The Diamond Age'' is characterized by two intersecting, almost equally-developed story lines: Nell's education through her independent work with the Primer, and the social downfall of engineer and designer of the Primer, John Percival Hackworth, who has made two illegal copies of the Primer for his own young daughter, Fiona. (One copy is stolen by Nell's brother.) His crime becomes known both to Lord Finkle-McGraw and to Dr. X, the black market engineer whose compiler Hackworth used to create the copy of the Primer, and each man attempts to exploit Hackworth to advance the opposing goals of their tribes. A third storyline follows an actress, Miranda, who plays the voice of Nell's Primer and has almost become Nell's surrogate mother, in her attempts to find Nell. Later Miranda's storyline is taken over by Miranda's associate Carl Hollywood after Miranda disappears.

''Diamond Age'' also includes fully narrated educational tales from the Primer that map Nell's individual experience (e.g. her four toy friends) onto [[Archetype|archetypal]] [[Folklore|folk tales]] stored in the primer's [[database]]. Although ''The Diamond Age'' explores the role of technology and personal relationships in [[child development]], its deeper and darker themes also probe the relative values of cultures (which Stephenson explores in his other novels as well) and the shortcomings in communication between them.

==Title==
"Diamond Age" is an extension of labels for [[List of archaeological periods|archeological time periods]] that take central technological materials to define an entire era of human history, such as the [[Stone Age]], the [[Bronze Age]] or the [[Iron Age]]. Technological visionaries such as [[Eric Drexler]] and [[Ralph Merkle]], both of whom receive an honorary mention in ''The Diamond Age'', have argued that if nanotechnology develops the ability to manipulate individual [[atom]]s at will, it will become possible to simply assemble diamond structures from [[carbon]] atoms, materials also known as [[diamondoid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Dinello, 2005:232&lt;/ref&gt; Merkle states: "In diamond, then, a dense network of strong bonds creates a strong, light, and stiff material. Indeed, just as we named the Stone Age, the Bronze Age, and the Steel Age after the materials that humans could make, we might call the new technological epoch we are entering the Diamond Age".&lt;ref&gt;

==Characters==
[[File:Diamond Age Penguin 1998.jpg|thumb|right|Cover of the 1998 Penguin edition.]]
*'''Nell''' (Nellodee) – The story's protagonist, from the viewpoint of the novel as a coming-of-age story. She is born to Tequila, a lower-class single mother, and, with the help of the nanotech Primer, grows up to become an independent woman and the leader of a new phyle.
*'''Harv''' (Harvard) – Nell's older brother, who plays an important role in the beginning as her protector; he obtains the Primer for his sister by mugging John Percival Hackworth. Harv is forced to leave Nell when she joins the Neo-Victorians, and he later dies in hospital of [[Tuberculosis|consumption]].
*'''Bud''' – A petty criminal and "thete", or tribeless individual, Bud is Tequila's boyfriend and Nell and Harv's father. He is obsessed with his muscular body, and possesses a cranial weapon implant (known as a "skull gun"), which he uses to mug a member of the [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] phyle. He is executed for this crime early in the novel.
*'''Tequila''' – Nell and Harv's neglectful thete mother. After Bud's death, she has a series of boyfriends who abuse the children.
*'''John Percival Hackworth''' – The novel's second protagonist. He is a Neo-Victorian nanotech engineer, and develops the code for the Primer. He makes an illicit copy of the Primer for his daughter Fiona, who is Nell's age. When his crime is detected, he is forced to become a [[double agent]] in a covert power struggle between the Neo-Victorians and the Chinese Celestial Kingdom. Hackworth is forced to spend ten years with a colony of "Drummers," using their distributed intelligence (similar but not identical to [[distributed artificial intelligence]]) for the development of a new form of nanotech, known as the Seed.
*'''Fiona Hackworth''' – Hackworth's daughter, and his motivation for stealing a second copy of the Primer. During Hackworth's decade-long exile with the Drummers, he is able to maintain a connection with his daughter through the Primer, and when he returns she joins him, eventually choosing to stay with a surrealistic acting troupe in London.
*'''Gwendolyn Hackworth''' – Hackworth's wife and Fiona's mother, who divorces Hackworth after he joins the Drummers.
*'''Lord Alexander Chung-Sik Finkle-McGraw''' – A Neo-Victorian "Equity Lord" with the Apthorp conglomerate, who commissions the development of the Primer for his granddaughter Elizabeth.
*'''Elizabeth Finkle-McGraw''' – Lord Finkle-McGraw's granddaughter. It was for her that the project to develop the Illustrated Primer was begun. However, she never became as engrossed in the stories created by the Primer as Nell, and later rebelled against her Neo-Victorian upbringing due in part to the abuse of Miss Stricken. Elizabeth runs away from her wealthy aristocratic family to join the secretive CryptNet phyle.
*'''Judge Fang''' – A Chinese [[Confucianism|Confucian]] judge who sentences Bud to death in the beginning of the book. He also investigates Hackworth's mugging by Harv after he had illicitly had a second edition of the Primer created. As a civil official abiding by deep Confucian principles, his decision to let Nell keep the stolen primer is one of the pivotal plot elements that allows Nell's story to unfold. The fallout from that choice leads him to question his allegiances to the Coastal Republic (which rules Shanghai and the surrounding area), and he eventually joins the inland Celestial Kingdom.
*'''Chang''' and '''Miss Pao''' – Judge Fang's assistants.
*'''Dr. X.''' – A mysterious character who evolves from being an illicit technology specialist and hacker to being a powerful Confucian leader and nefarious force. His name comes from the fact that most westerners cannot pronounce his Chinese name; he encourages people to instead call him by the first letter of his name, 'X'.
*'''Constable Moore''' - Constable of the Dovetail community, semi-retired soldier, and Nell's adoptive father/guardian.
*'''Miranda Redpath''' – A "ractor" (actor in interactive movies) who, by performing in the stories of Nell's Primer, effectively becomes a mother figure for Nell.
*'''Carl Hollywood''' – A ractor and performance artist, Miranda's friend and adviser. He becomes more important towards the end of the novel, when he is involved in the battle between the Celestial Kingdom and the Coastal Republic.
*'''Miss Matheson'''- The head teacher at the academy where Nell, Fiona and Elizabeth attend. She instructs Nell to find her own path.  
*'''Miss Stricken'''- An authoritarian teacher at Miss Matheson's Academy who frequently uses corporal punishment on the students for minor infractions. During a confrontation with Nell, Stricken attempts to strike her with the ruler only to be immediately disarmed due to Nell's physical training by the Primer, this leads to her Elizabeth and Fiona all being placed in detention where they are forced to mindlessly copy from textbooks.

==Allusions to other works and genres==

===Charles Dickens===
The novel's neo-Victorian setting, as well as its narrative form, particularly the chapter headings, suggest a relation to the work of [[Charles Dickens]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite web
  | url = http://www.complete-review.com/reviews/stephenn/diamond.htm
  | title = The Diamond Age by Neal Stephenson
  | work = [[complete review]]
  | accessdate = 2010-08-07
  | quote = Dickens immediately surfaces as a point of comparison, not only because of the size of the book but because the future Stephenson presents his readers with is, in many respects, a skewed reflection and imitation of the Victorian age.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protagonist's name points directly to Little Nell from Dickens' 1840 novel ''[[The Old Curiosity Shop]]''.

===Judge Dee mysteries===
The novel's character Judge Fang is based on a creative extension of [[Robert van Gulik]]'s [[Judge Dee]] mystery series, which is based around a Confucian judge in ancient China who usually solves three cases simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite web

  | accessdate = 2010-08-07
  | quote = And the update on Judge Dee is utterly wonderful, with the Confucian classics given loving attention.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Judge Dee stories are based on the tradition of Chinese mysteries, transposing key elements into Western [[detective fiction]].

===Cyberpunk===
Nell's father, Bud, is presented as an archetypal [[cyberpunk]] character. He is a career criminal (though not a particularly skilled or high-ranking one) with various surgically implanted devices to aid him in his 'work'. Stephenson attempts to establish ''The Diamond Age'' as a "postcyberpunk" book by killing this character early on, while acknowledging the influence of the cyberpunk genre.

===''The Wizard of Oz''===
When Nell enters the castle of King Coyote in the Primer's final challenge for her, she encounters an enormous computer apparently designed to think and placed in charge of the kingdom. The computer is named "Wizard 0.2", a typographical allusion to ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]''. In that book, the Wizard puts on a grand appearance but is later revealed to be merely a man hiding behind a curtain. In similar fashion, Wizard 0.2 creates an impressive light show as it apparently processes data, but it is then revealed that the computer's decisions are in fact made by King Coyote himself.

===''Snow Crash''===
''The Diamond Age'' can be seen as a sequel to ''[[Snow Crash]]'', set many years later. This reading is based on a connection between Y.T., a major character in ''Snow Crash'', and the aged neo-Victorian Miss Matheson in ''The Diamond Age'', who drops oblique references to her past as a hard-edged skateboarder. This would set ''The Diamond Age'' some 80–100 years after ''Snow Crash''.

Further supporting evidence to connect these two novels include:
* Stephenson's short story "[[The Great Simoleon Caper]]" which refers to both the Metaverse seen in ''Snow Crash'' and the First [[distributed republic|Distributed Republic]] seen in ''The Diamond Age'' (another short story which fits in the ''Diamond Age'' milieu and even shares a character is "Excerpt from the Third and Last Volume of ''Tribes of the Pacific Coast''").
* references to Franchise-Organized Quasi-National Entities (FOQNEs) in both novels.

"The Great Simoleon Caper" depicts a United States in which rising inflation encourages people to use an [[Anonymous internet banking|untraceable relay system]] that makes it [[Underground economy|impossible to enforce taxes]] on [[electronic money|online transactions]] (which was later used as a plot element in another of Stephenson's works, the 1999 novel ''[[Cryptonomicon]]''). By the setting of ''Snow Crash'' the United States and most other [[nation-states]] have collapsed because of [[hyperinflation]]; in ''The Diamond Age'', one character tells Miranda that they collapsed from the lack of tax revenue. Small, voluntary governments like the burbclaves depicted in ''Snow Crash'' replaced nation-states.

Both novels deal with an almost "primitive tech" replacing a current, worldwide use technology, in the sense of the reprogramming of the mind through ancient Sumerian chanting in ''Snow Crash'' (which also uses allusions to Babylonian prostitutes passing an information virus like a sexually transmitted disease), and the idea of nanotechnology propagating and communicating through sexual intercourse, passing from body to body like a virus. Both novels use an ancient, almost primitive threat to modern, "Western" technology and ideology (The Raft in ''Snow Crash'' and The Fists of Righteous Harmony in ''The Diamond Age''). Stephenson explores the idea of the tech divide and its social and economic ramifications to the extreme using these violent, but not surprising, social revolutions.

==Proposed television adaptation==
In January 2007, the [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]] announced that it would be making a six-hour [[miniseries]] based on ''The Diamond Age.'' According to a June 2009 report in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', [[Zoë Green]] had been hired to write the series, with [[George Clooney]] and Grant Heslov of Smokehouse Productions as executive producers on the project.&lt;ref name=variety&gt;

'''''The Thorn''''' is a comic, religious satire movie released on May 24, 1974, as '''''The Divine Mr. J'''''. It was first shown as '''''The Greatest Story Overtold''''' at the [[Detroit Institute of Art]] in 1971. It was released on video in the early 1980s as ''The Thorn''. It was written, directed and produced by [[Peter McWilliams|Peter Alexander]]. Its release was legally challenged on grounds that its title and advertising deceptively exploited the fame of its co-star, [[Bette Midler]].

==Cast==
''The Thorn'' starred [[John Hassberger]] as [[Jesus Christ]] with supporting roles of Bette Midler as the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]]; James Harrison as [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]]; John Greenburg as [[John the Baptist]]; [[Fred LaBour]] as the Angel Fred; Richard Pollard as Rabbi Gabriel; Diana David as [[Salome]]; and Jack Castor and Chi Chi as [[Queen (slang)|queens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/570506 |title= The Divine Mr J (1974) |work= Film &amp; TV Database |publisher=British Film Institute |year=2011 |accessdate=May 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of these actors were unknown and had no other film credits, with the exception of Bette Midler who was just beginning to build her singing career, had acted in a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical, and had briefly played a lead role in the [[off-Broadway]] musical ''[[Salvation (musical)|Salvation]]'' in 1969. Midler had a brief appearance as a boat passenger in the 1966 film ''[[Hawaii (1966 film)|Hawaii]]''.

==Conception and production==
Originally conceived as ''The Greatest Story Overtold'', an irreverent spoof of the 1965 movie ''[[The Greatest Story Ever Told]]'', the film was influenced by the increase in popularity and profitability of Christian [[evangelism]]. [[Peter McWilliams]] wrote, produced, directed and edited the film under the pseudonym Peter Alexander. He went on to write a broad range of mostly self-published, popular books.

Filmed in [[16mm]] on a shoestring budget, the crew included Paul Josephson on camera and lighting, Craig Reynolds and [[Jay Cassidy]] on camera, and Jon Duff on sound recording. It was filmed mostly in a suburb of [[Detroit]], Michigan from 1970 to 1971.

==Release, marketing and legal challenge==
[[Image:The Devine Mr. J - premiere poster 1974.png|thumb|right|194px|alt=stock image of Bette Midler next to text: "National Entertainment Corp. presents Bette Midler in her film debut, The Divine Mr. J, a religious satire, More than a movie... it's a Happening, In the tradition of Lenny Bruce and Woody Allen, a film by Peter Alexander, [R], World premiere now, The Festival (Theater)"|Poster for premiere showing on 1974 May 24 in New York City]]

After its premiere showing in Detroit, the film remained underground until it was released by National Entertainment Corp. as ''The Divine Mr. J'' a few years later, to capitalize on Midler's growing fame as "[[The Divine Miss M]]." Its premiere showing under the new title at the Festival Theater in New York City on May 24, 1974, was [[Picketing (protest)|picketed]] by Midler's agent, who also challenged the film's title and marketing in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Bette: An Intimate Biography of Bette Midler |last=Mair |first=George |year=1995 |publisher=Birch Lane Press/Carol Publishing Group |location=Secaucus, NJ |isbn= |pages=96–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film received very poor reviews&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9505E4DF103FEF34BC4D51DFB366838F669EDE |title= Movie Review: The Divine Mr. J at Festival Theater |work=movies.nytimes.com |date=May 25, 1974 |accessdate=May 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and soon closed.

''The Divine Mr. J'' was re-released by Rochelle Films, Inc. in 1980 after Bette Midler's starring role in ''[[The Rose (film)|The Rose]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.betteontheboards.com/boards/link-07-01-08.htm |title=Bette on the Boards |work=betteontheboards.com |year=1979 |accessdate=May 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was blocked from opening in the U.S., but it did show overseas in the early 1980s. It received poor reviews.

The film reappeared as ''The Thorn'' on a Magnum Entertainment [[VHS]] video release around 1984. It was again blocked by the courts and returned underground.

==Plot==
The [[List of recurring characters in Futurama#Robot Mafia|Robot Mafia]] holds up an armored car in space and steals $8 million in cash, but jettisons it into a dumpster on Earth when the police give chase. Meanwhile, the Planet Express crew takes a vacation to Mars, planning to stay at [[List of recurring characters in Futurama#Leo and Inez Wong|Leo]] and [[List of recurring characters in Futurama#Leo and Inez Wong|Inez Wong]]'s hotel and casino. [[Amy Wong|Amy]] suggests that [[Doctor Zoidberg]] stay behind, given how poor he is. Disappointed, Zoidberg climbs into a dumpster, only to have the robbery money fall into his lap.

On Mars, Amy explains that her parents built their fortune thanks to her ancestor, Sir Reginald Wong, who swindled the native Martians out of their land. The Native Martians now work in the casino. She takes them on a tour of the high-security money room and its vault, patrolled by a blind Martian [[security guard]] named Blind Joe whose keen sense of smell alerts him to [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender]]'s attempt to steal some cash. Zoidberg arrives, surprising the crew, and quickly turns his $8 million into more than $10 billion at the [[roulette]] tables. His next bet loses, costing him everything, but he tells the shocked crew that he has enjoyed himself and helped everyone else have a little fun as well.

Returning to the dumpster on Earth, he is confronted by the Robot Mafia, who threaten to kill him unless he returns the money. He escapes by squirting [[cephalopod ink]] on them and himself and running away. At Planet Express, as the crew recovers from a severe [[hangover]], [[Professor Farnsworth]] uses a [[laser]] to make the ink in [[Fry (Futurama)|Fry]]'s new facial tattoo invisible. A misfire hits Zoidberg, turning him invisible because of the ink covering his body. On Mars, the Robot Mafia forcibly takes over all of the Wongs' properties, leaving the family broke and homeless. Amy realizes that Zoidberg's invisibility gives them a chance to rob the casino and return it to its rightful owners.

The crew sneaks Zoidberg into the vault, using a batch of spoiled shrimp from the casino buffet to cover his natural body odor and foil Blind Joe. Zoidberg quickly swallows all the cash he can grab, along with a small box that, according to Amy, is "the most valuable thing of all." The crew hurries to get him out as he starts to belch up the cash, but they are caught at the door by Blind Joe. Amy retrieves the box and opens it to reveal a document signed by Sir Reginald, which returns the land to its rightful owners (the Martians) after 100 years. Because that time has long since passed, Blind Joe and the Martians take ownership of the casino and throw the Robot Mafia out. In gratitude, they give the Wongs' ranch and a second casino back to them.

==Reception==
[[The A.V.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28678">'''Youth mentoring''' is the process of matching [[mentorship|mentors]] with young people who need or want a caring, responsible adult in their lives. Adult mentors are usually unrelated to the child or teen and work as volunteers through a community-, school-, or church-based social service program. The goal of youth mentoring programs is to improve the well-being of the child by providing a [[role model]] that can support the child academically, socially and/or personally. This goal can be accomplished through school work, communication, and/or activities. Goals and settings within a mentoring program vary by country because of cultural values.&lt;ref name="Herrera"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Herrera|first=Carla|author2=Grossmen, Jean |author3=Kauh, Tina |author4= McMaken, Jennifer |title=Mentoring in Schools: An Impact Study of Big Brothers Big Sisters School Based Mentoring|journal=Child Development|date=January–February 2011|volume=82|issue=1|pages=346–381|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2010.01559.x |pmid=21291446}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although informal mentoring relationships exist, formal, high-quality mentoring matches made through local or state mentoring organizations are often the most effective.

According to ''The Encyclopedia of Informal Education'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The classic definition of mentoring is of an older experienced guide who is acceptable to the young person and who can help ease the transition to adulthood by a mix of support and challenge. In this sense it is a developmental relationship in which the young person is inducted into the world of adulthood."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infed.org/learningmentors/mentoring.htm |title=Mentoring and young people |accessdate=2005-11-16 |last=Philip |first=Kate |date=August 2000 |work=The Encyclopedia of Informal Education |publisher=Infed }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Mentoring Effects==

'''Research on Mentoring Effects'''

Much research has been conducted on youth mentoring with the intent of determining whether or not there are positive benefits for youth and, if so, under what conditions the positive effects are most likely to occur.  The evidence is somewhat mixed, however.  According to some studies, not all mentoring programs are found to have positive effects.&lt;ref name="Herrera and Grossman"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Herrera | first1 = C. | last2 = Grossman | first2 = J. B. | last3 = Kauh | first3 = T.

L. | year = 2006 | title = Understanding and facilitating the youth mentoring movement | url = | journal = Social Policy Report | volume = 22 | issue = | page = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, some studies that demonstrated positive outcomes for youth suggested that benefits from mentoring do not always last for an extended period of time after the [[Psychological intervention|intervention]] has ended.&lt;ref name="e.g. Britner"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Britner | first1 = P. A. | last2 = Balcazar | first2 = F. E. | last3 = Blechman | first3 = E.

(2007).  The benefits associated with youth mentoring relationships. In T.D. Allen &amp; L.T. Eby (Eds.). The blackwell handbook of mentoring: A multiple perspectives approach (pp. 165-188).  Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Meta-Analysis'''

One method of determining how effective mentoring relationships have become is with the use of [[meta-analysis]].  Meta-analysis allows a researcher to synthesize several studies and has been said to provide an unbiased, objective, and quantifiable method to test for significant differences in the results found across studies.&lt;ref name="DuBois 2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = DuBois | first1 = D. L. | last2 = Holloway | first2 = B. E. | last3 = Valentine | first3 = J. C. | last4 = Cooper | first4 = H. | year = 2002 | title = Effectiveness of mentoring programs for youth: A meta-analytic Review | url = | journal = American Journal of Community Psychology | volume = 30 | issue = 2| pages = 157–196 | doi=10.1023/a:1014628810714}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two studies utilizing this method are presented below.

In a meta-analysis of 55 studies on mentoring programs, the overall effectiveness of mentoring as well as the factors relating to variation in mentoring effects were studied.&lt;ref name="DuBois 2002"/&gt; In this study, articles found on popular databases as well as possible search engines (such as Yahoo, etc.) that were published between 1970 and 1998 were selected and evaluated. Findings from this meta-analysis indicated that there was an overall positive, though modest, effect from mentoring.  The effect appeared to be especially beneficial for youth classified as “at risk” (see [[at-risk students]]) or “[[disadvantaged]]”.  Further findings indicated that [[effect size]] may be increased with the use of specific strategies and practices, such as providing continual support and structure to the mentor and relationship.  It is important to note, however, that this study cannot imply causality and further research is recommended to explore this relationship.&lt;ref name="DuBois 2002"/&gt;

In another meta-analysis, 39 articles published between 1970 and 2005 were analyzed.  Articles were required to measure a quantifiable effect on either [[juvenile delinquency|delinquency]], [[aggression]], [[substance abuse|substance use]], or [[academic achievement]].&lt;ref name="Tolan 2008"&gt;Tolan, P., Henry, D., Schoeny, M., Bass, A. (2008). Mentoring interventions to affect juvenile delinquency and associated problems. Campbell Systematic Reviews, 16. doi: 10.4073/csr.2008.16 Retrieved from www.campbellcollaboration.org/lib/download/238/&lt;/ref&gt; The overall effects were found to be positive with delinquency as well as with the other outcomes studied.  Effects were stronger with the delinquent and aggressive outcomes, while still remaining moderate with the group measuring substance use and academic achievement. This suggests that mentoring programs are especially effective with delinquent behavior.&lt;ref name="Tolan 2008"/&gt;

'''Use of Best Practices'''

Research indicates that the use of specific best practices can be used to improve the mentoring experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rhodes | first1 = J. E. | last2 = Reddy | first2 = R. | last3 = Grossman | first3 = J. B. | year = 2005 | title = The protective influence of mentoring on adolescents' substance use: Direct and indirect pathways | url = | journal = Applied Developmental Science | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 31–47 | doi = 10.1207/s1532480xads0901_4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keating | first1 = L. M. | last2 = Tomishima | first2 = M. A. | last3 = Foster | first3 = S. | last4 = Alessandri | first4 = M. | year = 2002 | title = The effects of a mentoring program on at-risk youth | url = | journal = Adolescence | volume = 37 | issue = | page = 717 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the meta-analysis listed above, several best practices were found to increase effect sizes in mentoring programs:&lt;ref name="DuBois 2002"/&gt;

# Monitoring of program implementation
# Screening of prospective mentors
# Matching of mentors and youth on the basis of one or more relevant criteria
# Both pre-match and ongoing training
# Supervision for mentor
# Support group for mentors
# Structured activities for mentors and youth
# Parent support or involvement components
# Expectations for both frequency of contact and length of relationship
# Mentor background in a helping role

In addition, there are several mentor websites that suggest the inclusion of similar best practices with the hopes of created greater outcomes for youth.

'''Research on Informal VS Formal Mentoring'''

In the research, there is a distinction between a naturally occurring adult-youth relationship (referred to as informal mentoring) and a structured adult-youth relationship where the mentor is assigned or matched (referred to as formal mentoring).&lt;ref name="Blinn-Pike 2007"&gt;Blinn-Pike, L. (2007) The benefits associated with youth mentoring relationships. In T.D. Allen &amp; L.T. Eby (Eds.). The blackwell handbook of mentoring: A multiple perspectives approach (pp. 165-188). Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;   There is less research available for informal mentor relationships than there is for formal, but the research indicates that benefits exist for both the mentor and mentee.&lt;ref name="Blinn-Pike 2007"/&gt; Research is also available that suggests no effect or negative effects from mentoring, especially if the relationship with the adult fails.&lt;ref name="Blinn-Pike 2007"/&gt;  Formal mentoring has been better studied in the research and, therefore, more findings are available on this topic.  In a review of literature, it was suggested that an emphasis in quality of mentoring relationship and programming has been steadily increasing in the research and a shift in outcome measures is apparent, with most studies measuring general youth development as opposed to reductions in particular deviant behaviors.&lt;ref name="Blinn-Pike 2007"/&gt;  In another review of literature, 10 studies were analyzed and found a moderate positive effect on mentee grades, reduction of substance use, reduction of some delinquent behaviors, but not with youth self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Blinn-Pike 2007"/&gt;

These studies suggest that, although research is conflicting, there is typically an overall positive effect as a result of a mentoring relationship.  This positive effect is more likely with the use of established best practices and within the population of youth classified as delinquent or "at risk".  Most research agrees, however, that further research is necessary and that research with more rigorous methods would be beneficial to the field.

=== Mentoring Benefits ===

The mentoring program for youngsters was mentioned as having significant benefits such as lower dropout rates in high school and subsequently increased graduation rates also at the secondary level. Students adopt a more positive attitude towards formal classroom learning with more formidable relationships between students, teachers, and parents. Youngsters also acquire more self-confidence and better behavior at home and school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://youth.gov/youth-topics/mentoring/benefits-mentoring-young-people|title=Benefits for Young People {{!}} Youth.gov|website=youth.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, there is reduced risk of students making the first move towards alcohol and substance abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=DuBois|first=David L.|last2=Portillo|first2=Nelson|last3=Rhodes|first3=Jean E.|last4=Silverthorn|first4=Naida|last5=Valentine|first5=Jeffrey C.|date=2011-08-01|title=How Effective Are Mentoring Programs for Youth?

==Approaches to mentoring==

===School-based===
One prevalent method is referred to as the "School-Based" approach. The mentor meets with the youth in an academic setting and facilitates school work while acting as a supportive role-model.They may also play games, do crafts or partake in non-academic activities.&lt;ref name="Herrera"/&gt; This approach is practiced by organizations such as [[Big Brothers Big Sisters of America|Big Brothers Big Sisters]] which is located in eleven countries including Ireland, the United States, Israel, and Bulgaria. As of 2005, there was an estimated 870,000 adults mentoring youth in a school-based program throughout The United States alone.&lt;ref name="Herrera"/&gt; [[Canada]] has developed an in-school program in which elderly Aboriginal mentors are paired with both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children to raise self-esteem, teach about native cultures, and provide support to youth in school.&lt;ref name=Aboriginal&gt;{{cite web|last=Community Education|title=Aboriginal Elders and Community Members in Schools|url=http://www.education.gov.sk.ca/aborigininal-elders-community-workers|work=Government of Saskatchewan Education|publisher=Saskatchewan Learning|accessdate=17 December 2013|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Statistics prove that school-based mentoring will increase academic student involvement. The school-based approach revealed improvement in the classroom and socially. Mentors are matched with a student and they work one on one with the student throughout the school year. Focusing on schoolwork, the student’s interest, and other activities. As a mentor the expectation is to be a positive role model that is supportive and encouraging. This relationship will help motivate the student to be successful in school, reducing school infractions and truancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pryce|first1=Julia|last2=Keller|first2=Thomas E|title=An Investigation Of Volunteer-Student Relationship Trajectories Within School-Based Youth Mentoring Programs|journal=Journal of Community Psychology|date=2012|volume=40|issue=2|pages=228–248|ref=Academic Search Complete|doi=10.1002/jcop.20487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Community-based===
"Community Based" is another approach to mentoring.&lt;ref name="Pryce"/&gt; In this setting, a mentor meets youth in the community such as a church, community facility, or by taking the child to community events. Both approaches can be done in a one-on-one or group setting. Individual vs. community based mentoring may be culturally specific, such as in India where youth are less in need of individual attention and thrive in a group setting, according to ''The International Journal of Social Work''.&lt;ref name="Pryce"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pryce|first=Julia|author2=Goins, Margaret |author3=Reiland, Melissa |title=The Development of a Youth Mentoring Program in the South of India|journal=International Social Work|date=January 2011|volume=54|issue=1|pages=51–65|doi=10.1177/0020872810372559|url=http://isw.sagepub.com/content/54/1/51.abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Community engagement statistics states that mentees after mentoring programs are 55% more likely to enroll in college, 78% more likely to volunteer regularly, 90% are interested in becoming a mentor, and 130% more likely to hold leadership positions. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mentoring.org/get-involved/community-engagement/.|title=Community Engagement|last=|first=|date=2014|website=Mentor|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Individual===
Individual mentoring, or a one on one setting is where there is one mentor who repeatedly meets with the same mentee for the duration of their program. These partnerships can be found in both community and school-based One on one mentoring is seen in programs such as Big Brothers, Big Sisters in The United States, as well as Mentor Me India in India. Individual mentor relationships or mixed with some group meetings were found to be more effective than solely group mentoring, found in a study in The New Zealand Journal of Psychology.&lt;ref name="Farruggia"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Farruggia|first=Susan|author2=Pat Bullen |author3=Joy Davidson |author4=Ann Dunphy |author5=Frank Solomon |author6=Efeso Collins |title=The Effectiveness of Youth Mentoring Programmes in New Zealand|journal=New Zealand Journal of Psychology|year=2011|volume=40|issue=3|pages=52–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Group===
Small group mentoring can be beneficial in places where there is a shortage of mentors, or youth are able to learn collectively in a group setting. This works with career oriented mentoring, when the focus is to encourage future success of the individual by bringing in successful professionals as mentors. This has found to be a successful approach in The Roma Mentor Project throughout Europe; it is able to build self-confidence, and social skills while also teaching the importance of Romani culture.&lt;ref name="Gruber"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gruber|first=Andrea|title=Reclaiming Roma Students in Hungary|journal=Reclaiming Children and Youth|date=Fall 2012|volume=21|issue=3|pages=34–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender Matching===
Research shows that youth mentorship relationships have the highest impact for "[[at-risk students]]” or “[[disadvantaged]]” students. Mentoring has shown to have great academic gains for these populations that have higher risk of school failure and dropping out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thompson|first1=Lynn|title=The impact of mentoring on academic achievement of at-risk youth|journal=Children and Youth Services Review|date=2001|volume=23|issue=3|pages=227–242|doi=10.1016/s0190-7409(01)00134-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=Kellie|title=Mentoring At-risk Youth: Improving Academic Achievement in Middle School Students|journal=Nonpartisan Education Review|date=2010|volume=6|issue=1|pages=1–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there have been many studies that look at the impact of mentorship and the importance of the length of the mentorship relationship, there has not been many studies that look at the impact of gender in a mentoring relationship. The research that has been done on gender matching in mentoring relationships has resulted in conflicting findings. For example, in a dissertation study the researcher looked at the impact that a male role model may have on “successful” African American middle school males. The study found that the gender of the role model is not the most important factor, the most important factor was that the role model is someone that has certain qualities such as leadership, accomplishments, work ethic, and creates a caring environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Joyner|first1=Sonya|title=The Impact of Positive Role Models of the Successful African American Male Student's School Performance|date=2013|journal=ProQuest Dissertations and Theses}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, another study looked at the differences between the mentoring relationships that men and women mentors have with their mentees and found that men and women mentor differently. They found that women mentors give more [[psychosocial]] mentoring, where as male mentors give more career mentoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allen|first1=T|title=Factors Related to Mentor Reports of Mentoring Functions Provided: Gender and Relational Characteristics|journal=Sex Roles|date=2004|volume=50|issue=1|pages=129–139|doi=10.1023/b:sers.0000011078.48570.25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet another study found that natural male mentors had a significant impact on African American youth in regards to their future economic benefits. The study found that African American fatherless youth benefited the most when they had a male mentor compared to a female mentor or no mentor at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Timpe|first1=Z.|last2=Lunkenheimer|first2=E.|title=The Long-Term Economic Benefits of Natural Mentoring Relationships for Youth|journal=American Journal of Community Psychology|date=2015|volume=56|issue=1-2|pages=12–24|doi=10.1007/s10464-015-9735-x|pmc=4643259}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these conflicting findings on the impact of gender matching in mentorship relationships, further research needs to be done on this topic.

==Mentoring programs by country==
Youth mentoring takes place around the world, and countries take varying approaches to the concept based off values and needs of that country's youth. There are organizations such as [[Big Brothers Big Sisters International]] that have locations worldwide, as well as country specific organizations, such as Mentor Me India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who We Are - Big Brothers Big Sister International|url=http://www.bbbsi.org/about-us/|website=Big Brothers Big Sister International}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Program - Mentor Me India|url=https://mentormeindia.org/program/|website=Mentor Me India}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Australia===
Australia has a large number of mentoring program operating across the country utilising a number of mentoring practices - in school mentoring, one on one mentoring, e-mentoring are some common example. Australia also has a peak body representing the youth mentoring sector known as the [http://www.aymn.org.au Australian Youth Mentoring Network] - or the AYMN. The AYMN works with interested youth mentoring organisations and practitioners to foster the growth and development of high quality mentoring programs for young people in Australia by providing a national base of collaboration, support, guidance and expertise. It has played a major role in building stronger mentoring practice, and performance in the field. One of the Network’s key achievements includes the creation of the National Youth Mentoring Benchmarks, where over 500 individuals from the mentoring sector contributed to the consultation process and the final product.

===Hungary===
[[File:Monte-Roma3.JPG|thumb|Romani Children]]
The [[Romani people|Romani]] population is about 1.9% of the total population in [[Hungary]], according to the 2001 census.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Central Intelligence Agency|title=Hungary|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2075.html|publisher=Cia.Gov|accessdate=19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 12 Million [[Romani People|Romani]] across Europe, and they account for one of Europe's most vulnerable populations. Within the Romani population, there is a lack of education amongst youth accompanied by large numbers of illiteracy. Because of this trend, there was the creation of The Roma Mentor Project, which provides successful Romani adults to be role models of Romani youth. The program started in 2006, and by 2011, it spread to four other European countries with 1,400 participants. The program matches professionals in many different fields, such as government officials, professors, musicians, and media figures. These adults meets with groups of youth for two to three hours, twice a month, to influence their future decisions on education and career development. Already the program has found a shift in attitudes toward education and improvement in grades.&lt;ref name="Gruber"/&gt;

===India===
[[File:Cherubic Child India.jpg|thumb|Smiling Indian Boy]]
Mentoring programs in the south of India have begun to rise in [[rural]] settings. Mentoring in India can be found in both a one-to-one setting as well as group settings. Mentor Me India is a specific program within urban India and is a program that executes one-to-one mentoring within the community. These mentorships have a focus on girls for aged 10 to 12 for the pilot phase, providing them female professional mentors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mentor Me India|url=http://mentormeindia.org/contact/|accessdate=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another mentoring program that is starting in rural India implemented by United States researches as well as Indian community members. The purpose was to help with the impoverished youth who do not have access to the same resources as youth in an urban setting. When creating the program, Indian cultural norms and limited resource access were taken into account. The focus of this mentorship program is to develop leadership, academic achievement, and spiritual development while having a community service portion among the youth.&lt;ref name="Pryce"/&gt; According to The Journal of International Social Work, one-on-one mentorships are not as fitting in rural India as they be elsewhere due to a lack of mentors as well as the desire to building peer relationships.&lt;ref name="Pryce"/&gt;

===South Africa===
[[File:Soweto Marimba Youth League-001.jpg|thumb|South African youth playing the marimba]]
Starting in the 1990s, after high rates of youth incarceration due to [[apartheid]], non-governmental agencies decided there was need to advocate for the youth. The purpose of these organizations is to have an alternative to the formal justice setting, which kept around 30,000 youth per year out of criminal trial. One of the programs, Diversion into Music Education (DIME), has incorporated a mentor base approach through music appreciation. The program does not require any previous music capabilities and focuses on the student, not on the performance. The program is also located in Tampa, Florida, United States and allows for an intercultural exchange of staff members and video between organizations. The mentor's role in this organization is to help youth set and achieve goals and assist in personal growth of the individual. Results from the program have shown positive outcomes on family relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Woodward|first=Sheila|author2=Nielsen, Julia |author3=Mathiti, Vuyisile |title=South Africa, The Arts and Youth in Conflict with the Law|journal=International Journal of Community Music|year=2008|volume=1|issue=1|pages=69–88|doi=10.1386/ijcm.1.1.69_0 |url=http://repository.uwc.ac.za/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10566/1123/WoodwardLaw2007.pdf?sequence=3|accessdate=19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
[[File:Man and boy high-fiving each other (Strike Zone Bowling Center, Camp Humphreys).jpg|thumb|Man and boy [[high five|high-fiving]] at a bowling alley]]
The largest mentoring program in the United States is [[Big Brothers Big Sisters of America]], a program for youth from ages 6–18. The organization implements both community-based as well as school-based mentoring, and is typically a one-on-one mentorship.&lt;ref name="Herrera"/&gt; There are also programs that are for specific groups of youth such as The National CARES Mentoring Movement, which was created in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]]. The program provides strong black leaders to empower black youth in America for a better future. At the start of the program, 86 percent of black fourth graders were reading below grade level, and 1,000 black children a day were being arrested.&lt;ref name="Mitchell"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mitchell|first=Martin|title=National CARES Mentoring Movement|journal=Reclaiming Children and Youth|date=Spring 2013|volume=22|issue=1|pages=30–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; After joining the mentoring movement, 98 percent of participants stayed in school as well as avoided gang activity, and [[teen pregnancy]], while 85 percent of youth in the program did not use drugs. Since starting in 2005, the program has influenced over 125,000 black youths. The mentoring typically takes place in the community in a group setting to create positive relations amongst the youth.&lt;ref name="Mitchell"/&gt; In 2002, the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences published a major report examining after-school and other community programs designed to foster positive youth development.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=10022#toc&lt;/ref&gt;  The report concluded that very few after-school programs “have received the kind of comprehensive experimental evaluation necessary to make a firm recommendation about replicating the program in its entirety across the country.”  However, the report singled out mentoring programs modeled after the Big Brothers Big Sisters mentoring program as a rare exception, and recommended its widespread replication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=10022#toc |title=Community Programs to Promote Youth Development |page=307 |author=Institute of Medicine, National Academy of Sciences |year=2002 |publisher=The National Academies Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
