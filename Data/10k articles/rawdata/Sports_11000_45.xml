'''Brobham''' (first name and dates unknown) was an English [[first-class cricket|first-class]] [[cricket]]er who was active in the 1760s and 1770s. He played for [[Dartford Cricket Club|Dartford]] and [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent]]. Brobham was recorded twice. He played for [[John Frederick Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset]]'s team in a [[single wicket cricket|single wicket "fives" match]] at the [[Artillery Ground]] in May 1768.&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, p.47.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1775, he was a member of the Dartford team playing against [[Chertsey Cricket Club|Chertsey]] at [[Laleham Burway]].&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, p.75.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Brobham had established his reputation by 1768, he must have been active for some years previously and was possibly near the end of his career in 1775. Very few players were mentioned by name in contemporary reports and there are no other references to Brobham.

'''Diadora''' is an Italian [[association football|football]], [[tennis]], [[running]], [[cycling]], [[rugby league|rugby]], [[athletic shoe]], [[clothing]], and [[fashion accessory]] manufacturer with locations in Italy, the [[United States]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Australia]] and [[Bangladesh]].

==History==
[[File:Diadora Mythos Axeler.JPG|thumb|right|180px|Diadora Mythos Axeler, 2009]]
Diadora is an Italian athletic footwear and apparel manufacturer, a tradition that began in 1948 when the company's founder, Marcello Danieli, first began working in the trade as a young boy.

He called his company "Diadora" a name suggested by a friend. In Greek, "dia dora" means "by means of gifts" which was appropriate, but probably not the origin of his friend's suggestion. More likely, it came from the name given by the Greeks of Byzantium to the Dalmatian town of [[Zadar]]. Originally called "de ladera" or "from Zadar," it was mistakenly copied and translated from Dalmatian to Latin, becoming, along the way "Diadora."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.footballshirtculture.com/History/the-history-of-diadora.html |title=The history of Diadora |publisher=Football Shirt Culture |accessdate=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Danieli, helped by his wife, managed to successfully launch his first product, [[mountaineering|mountain climbing]] boots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diadoraamerica.com/history.html |title=History |publisher=Diadora America |accessdate=2008-08-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704074306/http://diadoraamerica.com/history.html |archivedate=4 July 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1950s, a reputation for excellence and quality helped the company grow and become a familiar name throughout the Italian market.

During the economic boom of the 1960s, people began to enjoy prosperity and increased recreation. [[Skiing]] became popular and Danieli once again met the needs of the market by manufacturing ski boots and the first apres-ski boots.

Next, Diadora introduced [[running]] shoes and shortly thereafter, [[tennis]] shoes. With the 1970s came a young generation whose explosive interest in [[athletics (track and field)|athletics]] initiated a boom in the sporting goods industry. Based originally on the renowned Italian artisan techniques, Diadora's shoes became more and more technologically advanced, thanks to cooperation from champions such as [[Guillermo Vilas]], [[Martin Mulligan]] and [[Björn Borg]].

The mid-'70s also marked Diadora's entry into the [[association football|football]] category, aided by [[Roberto Bettega]], who both provided invaluable consulting information. [http://www.diadoraamerica.com Diadora America] is the #3 brand in the market share in football (soccer). AC Milan striker [[Marco van Basten]] became the face of the company in the late 1980s, and launched his own personalized football boots, the San Siro Van Basten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=1980s Diadora San Siro Van Basten |url=https://footballcollectorsitems.com/football-boots/1980s-diadora-san-siro-van-basten-football-boots.html |accessdate=26 July 2018 |agency=Football Collectors Items.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diadora had and currently have a number of other high-profile football players under their sponsorship such as; [[George Weah]], [[Roberto Baggio]], [[Giuseppe Signori]], [[Francesco Totti]], [[Roy Keane]] and [[Antonio Cassano]].

On 30 June 1998, Invicta, an outdoor athletics equipment company, was acquired by Diadora.

In 2007, Diadora signed a contract with football club [[NK Dinamo Zagreb]], [[Croatia]]. [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.]] wore kits for several seasons in the mid 2000s. [[Maccabi Netanya]] and [[Beitar Jerusalem]] also wore kits for several seasons in the mid to late 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calcalist.co.il/sport/articles/0,7340,L-3291722,00.html|title=מכבי נתניה תלבש בעונה הבאה דיאדורה|date=25 May 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-1282329,00.html|title=גם דיאדורה תאמץ את בית"ר|date=6 November 2001|publisher=|via=Ynet}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Diadora signed contracts with [[FK Željezničar Sarajevo|FK Željezničar]] and [[Collingwood Magpies Netball]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.klix.ba/sport/nogomet/stoljetni-simboli-osnovni-elementi-novih-dresova-zeljeznicara/160620128|title=Stoljetni simboli osnovni elementi novih dresova Željezničara (FOTO+VIDEO)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.collingwoodfc.com.au/news/2016-09-21/collingwood-netball-team-takes-flight|title=Collingwood Netball team takes flight - collingwoodfc.com.au|work=collingwoodfc.com.au|access-date=2017-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Agreement ==
In 2008, Diadora SpA signed a joint venture with Win Hanverky Holdings Limited forming a new company called Winor International Company Limited that owns the trademark "DIADORA" in [[China]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[Macau]] and will manufacture, design, promote, distribute, and sell products bearing the "DIADORA" in those countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.winhanverky.com/UserFiles/File/Appendix%20E_eng.pdf |format=PDF|title=Win Hanverky Forms Joint Venture Asserts Ownership of DIADORA Brand in the PRC, Hong Kong and Macau Market |publisher=Win Hanverky |date=2008-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2009, Diadora reached an agreement with Italian shoe-making company [[Geox]]'s founder and chairman Mario Moretti Polegato to buy its assets through his family's investment arm, LIR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Geox billionaire steps into Diadora|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/sole-searching-geox-billionaire-steps-into-diadora-1711250.html|accessdate=10 July 2011 | location=London|work=The Independent|first=Margareta|last=Pagano|date=21 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7258">[[Image:ELECTROLINE.jpg|thumb|The Electroline; the first computerized, electronic line judge device, introduced in 1974.]]
An '''electronic line judge''' is a device used in [[tennis]] to automatically detect where a ball has landed on the court. Attempts to revolutionize tennis officiating and the judging of calls in the sport began in the early 1970s and has resulted in the design, development and prototyping of several computerized, electronic line-judge devices. The methods have been based upon the use of pressure sensors, sensors to detect magnetized or electrically conductive tennis balls, infrared laser beams, and most recently video cameras.

== Development ==
The first successful public demonstration of a computerized device to make automated line calls at a professional tennis tournament was in 1974. (The Electroline-control computer pictured at the right). This original tennis electronic line judge device, invented by Geoffrey Grant, an avid tennis player, and Robert Nicks, an electronics engineer, was used in the championship finals of both the Men’s [[World Championship Tennis]] in Dallas in May, 1974 and the Ladies’ [[LA Women's Tennis Championships|Virginia Slims]] tour in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;Electronic Design Magazine 9 April 26, 1976, p55-57. An electronic linesman decides where the tennis ball bounces. By John F. Mason [http://www.geoffreygrant.com/EDM.pdf   pdf file]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tennis Magazine January 1975, p20-22. Is the tennis lineman obsolete? by Ken Bentley. [http://www.geoffreygrant.com/TM.pdf   pdf file]&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Grant-Nicks pressure sensor based system was given rave reviews in the press at its introduction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geoffreygrant.com/ElectrolineArticles.html |title=Electroline Newspaper Articles |publisher=Geoffreygrant.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and was issued with a [[USPTO]] patent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=k3N8AAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=3,982,759 |title=# 3,982,759 |publisher=Google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the product was never commercialized.

[[Image:ELECTROLINE-SENSORS.jpg|thumb|The Mylar sensors used beneath the carpet to detect where the ball landed for the first computerized, electronic line judge device. The inventors; Grant (left) and Nicks.]]
This inaugural electronic line-judge device worked on a principle of large, thin [[mylar]] conductive plastic pressure sensors beneath the surface of a carpet court. It was able to distinguish between a foot and the tennis ball; the computer detected the sharp, millisecond pulse of the ball bounce striking the ground, as compared to the slowness and electronic print of player’s foot movements. Even when a foot was present on the sensor a dynamic load circuit was able to detect and distinguish between the signals. Beneath the court surface on each boundary line of the court were both and "in" and "out" sensors so that if a ball hit the outside of the line and also hit the  "out" sensor the computer would correctly overrule the "out" call allowing play to continue.

This first electronic device made decisions not only as to whether the ball landed within the boundaries of the playing zones, but also was wired to make [[foot fault]] and service net-cord [[Serve (tennis)#Legal serves|legal serve]] decisions. The foot fault judge used directional microphones to detect the striking of the ball by the player’s racquet, when serving the ball, that functioned in conjunction with a timing circuit to detect if the players foot had activated the baseline line ‘IN’ sensor immediately prior to, or during, the striking of the ball. The net cord  ‘Let’ sensor was a simple [[Piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] device, initially a guitar pickup, to detect if the tennis ball touched the net during the service delivery. The service line sensors, net-cord sensor, legal serve and foot fault devices were turned "on" in unison during the process of a player serving the ball at the beginning of each point and then turned "off" as the opponent returned the ball.

In its successful inaugural use, at the Men’s World Championships of Tennis 1974 finals in  the [[Southern Methodist University]] indoor stadium in [[Dallas]] TX, the device was limited to judging only the service line. A later prototype was used to call all tennis court lines plus the net-cord as at the Ladies Virginia Slims championships in Los Angeles during 1975.

The second system that was publicly demonstrated to electronically officiate line calls was introduced in Edinburgh, Scotland, UK at the Pernod sponsored tennis event in July 1977.&lt;ref&gt;The (LONDON) Times-Online July 26, 1977. By Rex Bellamy.’Electronic Linesman to aid rectitude’.&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.geoffreygrant.com/Times.pdf   pdf file]. The system was invented by Lyle David,[http://www.geoffreygrant.com/Times.pdf   (pdf file) ] who patented electrically conductive tennis balls, a micro-computer network systems equipment and installed wires at the boundaries of the court to detect and determine the location of the contact of the ball with the surface.&lt;ref&gt;USPTO patents [http://www.google.com/patents?id=mdgyAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=4071242  # 4071242].
[http://www.google.com/patents?id=CV8TAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=4432058   #  443258] and
[http://www.google.com/patents?id=6PYyAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=4855711   # 4855711].&lt;/ref&gt;

The system had some failings with respect to reliability and, like the Grant-Nicks pressure sensor device, did not emerge as a commercial product.

Commercially, the most successful system to emerge in the early experimental period of electronic officiating was the "[[Cyclops (computer system)|Cyclops]]". Cyclops was a device used only for service line calls but functioned reliably and was used around the world for many years until superseded by video and television technology. The Cyclops system consisted of a series of infrared laser light beams projected, at a centimeter above the ground, to a receiver device across the court and then to a computer. The series of beams were aligned to accurately determine if the ball was inside the service area. This determination was only valid with respect to the main service line and not the side or center service lines. The Cyclops system was used only on show courts and covered only the main service lines.

In the 2000s, the sport began to embrace video camera methodology such as [[Hawk-Eye]].

Hawk-Eye allows review of player questioned line calls on a select few ‘high’ visibility televised matches. This limited use has been criticized as a social discontinuity in that players of lesser stature that are not asked to play on show courts are being unfairly discriminated against.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

The professional tennis players associations, both the [[Association of Tennis Professionals]] and the [[Women's Tennis Association]] have approved a method and process of instantaneous re-evaluation of questionable line calls and the system of television video review has become popular.

'''Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys''' ({{IPA-ca|əsˈtaði uˈlimpiɡ ʎuˈis kumˈpaɲs}}, formerly known as the '''Estadi Olímpic de Montjuïc''' and '''Estadio de Montjuic''') is a [[stadium]] in [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Originally built in 1927 for the [[1929 Barcelona International Exposition|1929 International Exposition]] in the city (and Barcelona's bid for the [[1936 Summer Olympics]], which were awarded to [[Berlin]]), it was renovated in 1989 to be the main stadium for the [[1992 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1992/1992s2.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528011647/http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1992/1992s2.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-05-28 |title=Official Report of the XXV Games of the Olympiad Barcelona 1992; Volume II; p.127 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium has a capacity of 55,926 (67,007 during the 1992 Olympics), and is located in the [[Anella Olímpica]], in [[Montjuïc]], a large hill to the southwest of the city which overlooks the harbor.

==History==
[[File:Barcelona Olympic Stadium (Inside).jpg|thumb|Internal view of the stadium in 2014.]]
Designed by architect Pere Domènech i Roura for the 1929 Expo, the stadium was officially opened on 20 May 1929. Montjuïc hosted its first ever event, [[Spain national rugby union team|Spain]]'s first official rugby international game against [[Italy national rugby union team|Italy]].

It was meant to host the [[People's Olympiad]] in 1936, a protest event against the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] in [[Berlin]], but the event had to be cancelled due to the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]].

In the fifties, the stadium was the centerpiece of the [[1955 Mediterranean Games]], and in 1957 it hosted the only [[Copa del Rey|national football cup]] Final between [[FC Barcelona]] and [[RCD Espanyol]], the two local clubs.

In the seventies the stadium was disused, and the stands deteriorated. When the [[Spanish Grand Prix]] and other races were held at the [[Montjuïc circuit|Montjuïc racing circuit]], the stadium was used as a paddock for the teams. Due to safety concerns, the 1975 F1 race was nearly boycotted by drivers.

Due to the award of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] to Barcelona, the stadium was renovated with the involvement of Italian architect [[Vittorio Gregotti]]. The stadium was gutted, preserving only the original facades, and new grandstands were built. In 1989 the venue was re-inaugurated for the [[IAAF Continental Cup|World Cup in Athletics]], and three years later it hosted the opening and closing ceremonies and the [[Athletics at the 1992 Summer Olympics|athletics]] competitions of the Olympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080528011647/http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1992/1992s2.pdf 1992 Summer Olympics official report.] Volume 2. pp. 160-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium served as the home of football club RCD Espanyol from 1997 until 2009. The Estadi Olímpic made its final [[La Liga]] appearance during the 2008-2009 season, as Espanyol moved to the newly constructed [[RCDE Stadium]].

It also served as the home of the [[Barcelona Dragons]] [[American football]] team until 2002. Because the size of the playing surface was slightly shorter than the regulation [[American Football]] length, the stadium only had 7-yard end zones, three yards shorter than regulation NFL size in 1991 and 1992. They were later lengthened to the standard 10 yards. The stadium also played host to the [[National Football League]]'s [[American Bowl]] in 1993 and in 1994. The [[San Francisco 49ers]] played the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] on 1 August 1993. The second game was played on 31 July 1994 between the [[Oakland Raiders|Los Angeles Raiders]] and the [[Denver Broncos]].

In 2001, the stadium was renamed after the former president of the [[Generalitat de Catalunya]] [[Lluís Companys]], who was executed at the nearby Montjuïc Castle in 1940 by the [[Spain under Franco|Franco regime]]. In 2010, the stadium hosted the [[2010 European Athletics Championships|20th European Athletics Championships]].

The '''Estadio Nemesio Díez''', (formerly '''Estadio Luis Dosal''') nicknamed '''La Bombonera''', is one of the oldest [[football (soccer)|football]] stadiums in [[Mexico]]. Opened on August 8, 1954, with a capacity of 35,000 seats, it is located in the city of [[Toluca]], [[Estado de Mexico|Mexico]], near [[Mexico City]]. It is the home of [[Deportivo Toluca Fútbol Club]]. Because of its location this stadium has hosted two [[Football World Cup|World Cups]] ([[Football World Cup 1970|1970]] and [[Football World Cup 1986|1986]]). One former nuance about this stadium is that it did not have a lighting system, which forced the local team as a tradition to play at noon.

==Renovation (2015 - 2017)==
With an investment of 800 million [[MXN]] (about 40 million [[USD]]), the announcement to remodel The Nemesio Diez stadium by 2017 was made, when Club Deportivo Toluca celebrates  its centenary and does so with a remodeled and more functional stadium.

Within the Nemesio Diez, four macro support columns that will sustain the stadium structure will be built to replace the current columns obstructing visibility. In the shadow stands, a second level will be built so the capacity, which currently stands at 22,000 will increase to 30,000.

The project also includes four giant screens at each end of the building, replacement of all seats and a sunroof in the preferred (shaded) section, to assist in the process of maintaining the natural grass in the field.

The remodeled stadium officially opened on January 15, 2017 with a league match against Club America. The first goal was scored by Gabriel Hauche for toluca with a screamer outside of the box. Toluca FC won that match 2-1.

The stadium was completed in the summer 2017 where it had been confirmed that the club would play against [[Atletico Madrid]] for the official inauguration of the remodeled stadium.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mediotiempo.com/futbol/2017/04/20/toluca-celebrara-centenario-contra-el-atletico-de-madrid&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Estadio 3 de Marzo''', is situated in [[Zapopan]], [[Jalisco]], [[México]], district that forms part of the [[Guadalajara Metropolitan Area]]; it is the ground of [[Tecos F.C.|Tecos]]; which plays in the [[Tercera Division de Mexico]]. It has a capacity of 18,779 and was constructed inside the campus of the [[Universidad Autónoma de Guadalajara]].

== Construction ==

Due to the need of money this having a place to accommodate the football team of the [[Universidad Autónoma de Guadalajara]] that was then on the third tier of Mexican football; construction on the stadium began in 1971.

The steel stands were prefabricated and had a capacity of around 3,000 people. In virtue of UAG ascending to the second level of Mexican football in the year 1973 and according to a ruling from the [[Federación Mexicana de Fútbol Asociación]]. New concrete stands were constructed on the sides of the pitch. This brought the stadium capacity to 15,000 people, the minimum forum for a second division stadium.

In 1975, after the [[Estudiantes Tecos|Tecos de la UAG]] ascended to the [[Primera División de Mexico]], the stands were once again remodeled in order to meet the minimum demands of the division which was 25,000 people.

The stadium once again went through renovation in order to accommodate the [[1986 World Cup]] which brought the capacity to 30,015 people after new standing room areas were created.

In 1999, Estadio Tres de Marzo underwent its last major renovation which included improvements such as a new pitch and drainage system. The stadium earns its name for the founding date of the [[Universidad Autónoma de Guadalajara]], On March 3, 1935.

Later, in 2009, Estadio Tres de Marzo was remodeled to fit the new modern look of [[Estudiantes Tecos]] and changed the stands' colors from being yellow and red, to wine red, while also drawing out the team's logo in the middle of both the east and west sides of the main stands.

The '''EuroGames''' are an [[LGBT]] sporting event in Europe, hosted by license of the [[European Gay and Lesbian Sport Federation]] and organised by one or more of the federation's member clubs. Similar to the [[Gay Games]], Eurogames are a sports-for-all-event, open to everyone, irrespective of sex, age, sexual identity or physical ability.

==Scheduling==
The EuroGames is a two-day event. The most recent EuroGames were held from 29 June to 2 July 2016 in Helsinki, Finland. The organizing sport club was HOT Helsinki. There were 14 sports on offer and the games attracted 3000 participants. The next EuroGames are planned for Rome in 2019.

[[Image:Exertris bike210 300.jpg|thumb|The Exertris Interactive Exercise Bike]]
'''Exertris''' was an [[exergaming]] company founded in 2000 by Gareth Davies. Their flagship product was the Exertris Interactive Exercise Bike, an [[exercise bike]] that uses several built in [[video game]]s to motivate users.&lt;ref name="World's First Interactive Gaming Bike"&gt;http://whitepapers.zdnet.co.uk/0,1000000651,260149776p,00.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==The bike==
Davies, a Ph.D physicist and a keen fitness enthusiast, invented the Exertris Interactive Exercise Bike to solve the motivation problem with respect to cardiovascular exercise. Observing that traditional exercise bikes simply discarded the energy input of the cyclist as waste heat and sound, he conceived of a system to put the cyclist's energy to use as well as giving direct feedback of their performance.

The Exertris system combined the addictive qualities of video games with the health benefits of exercise. Unlike previous attempts to 'virtualise' cycling, few of the games on the Exertris bike bore any resemblance to cycling. Instead, the cyclist's energy was virtualised and this virtual energy used to power elements of the games, all of which were designed specifically for the platform. The games also controlled the cycle's resistance in theme with the games.  

The Exertris bike was one of the first [[Windows XP]] Embedded systems in the world. [[Bill Gates]] show-cased the Exertris bike at the [[Consumer Electronics Show]] 2003 during his keynote speech.&lt;ref name="BillGates"&gt;http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2003/jan03/01-08ces2003overallpr.mspx&lt;/ref&gt; The Exertris bike was also featured on [[BBC]]'s ''[[Tomorrow's World]]'' in 2002 and televised on the show again the following year when Davies was nominated for the Tomorrow's World Innovation Awards.

===Features===
The bike incorporated a gaming platform, an [[Liquid crystal display|LCD screen]], a [[gamepad]] and an arm-rest with a patented system that simultaneously raised the screen and arm-rest when the seat was raised ensuring correct posture in a single movement. The system was covered by two other patents: one for a motivational system to convert cycle speed into a virtual energy; a second covered the gearboxed resistance unit that dispensed with the need for a large, separate flywheel.

The bike also had a 'manual' mode which allowed it to operate as a standard exercise bike, complete with a simulated LED control panel.

===Games===
The Exertris Bike originally shipped with four games:
* Solitaire - the player had to cycle in order to move the cards. Higher value cards represented higher resistance.
* Gems - a ''Columns''-style [[Computer puzzle game|puzzle game]] in which the players cycling slow the descent of falling gems. Matching gems of same colour exploded them, allowing players to clear levels in order to complete them. Different colour gems controlled resistance levels.
* Space Tripper - a scrolling shoot-em-up adapted and licensed from [[PomPom Games]]. In the ported version, the firepower of the ship was linked to the cyclist pedal speed. The player could also optionally charge the weapons system for increased firepower which also increase pedalling resistance.
* Orbit - a [[multiplayer game]] in which players on linked bikes competed in an arena to collect gems scattered around levels for points.

In a later release of the bike's software two more games were added:
* Maze - a pacman-style game in which the user guides a cartoon ladybug around a mazed trying to avoid being eaten by hungry spiders.
* Light Cycles - a multiplayer game inspired by the famous scene in the 1982 film ''[[Tron]]''.

==Demise==
Although the Exertris Bike was received enthusiastically by consumers and press alike, economic factors at the time led to financial problems early on. The high manufacturing cost of the bike at low volumes combined with a poor funding environment following the [[dotcom bust]] and [[September 11 attacks|9/11]] meant the company never achieved profitable status and was forced to close in 2004.

The '''football helmet''' is a piece of [[American football protective equipment|protective equipment]] used mainly in [[American football]] and [[Canadian football]]. It consists of a [[duroplast|hard]] [[plastic]] shell with thick padding on the inside, a [[face cage|face mask]] made of one or more plastic-coated metal bars, and a chinstrap. Each position has a different type of face mask to balance protection and visibility, and some players add [[polycarbonate]] visors to their helmets, which are used to protect their eyes from glare and impacts. Helmets are a requirement at all levels of organized football, except for non-tackle variations such as [[flag football]]. Although they are protective, players can and do still suffer head injuries such as [[concussion]]s.

==History==
{{Main|History of the football helmet}}
[[File:Dogearteam.jpg|thumb|left|350px|alt=members of a football team wearing old-fashioned leather helmets|Football team, turn of the 20th century]]

===Invention===

One of the first instances of football headgear dates to [[1896 in sports|1896]] when [[Lafayette College]] halfback [[George Barclay (sportsperson)|George "Rose" Barclay]] began to use straps and earpieces to protect his ears. It is not certain who invented the football helmet. Many sources give credit for the creation of the helmet to [[James Naismith]], while other sources credit [[Navy Midshipmen football|U.S. Naval Academy Midshipman]] [[Joseph M. Reeves]] (later to become the "Father of Carrier Aviation"), who had a protective device for his head made out of mole skin to allow him to play in the 1893 [[Army-Navy game]]. Reeves had been advised by a Navy doctor that another kick to his head would result in "instant insanity" or even death, so he commissioned an Annapolis shoemaker to make him a helmet out of leather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Football Helmet|url=http://www.pasttimesports.biz/history.html|publisher=Past Time Sports|accessdate=2011-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, helmets were made of padded leather and resembled aviators' helmets or modern day [[scrum cap]]s. At least in professional football, they were optional. Some [[National Football League]] players, notably [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall-of-Famer]] [[Bill Hewitt (American football)|Bill Hewitt]], played all or most of their careers without a helmet.

===Early years===

One innovation from the early 1900s period was hardened leather. 1917 marked the first time helmets were raised above the head in an attempt to direct blows away from the top of the head.{{clarify|date=October 2012}} Ear flaps also had their downfall during this period as they had little ventilation and made it difficult for players to hear. The 1920s marked the first time that helmets were widely used in the sport of football. These helmets were made of leather and had some padding on the inside, but the padding was insufficient and provided little protection. In addition, they lacked face masks. As a result, injuries were very common. Early helmets also absorbed a lot of heat, making them very uncomfortable to wear.

[[File:Leather football helmet (circa 1930's).JPG|thumb|right|A leather football helmet believed to have been worn by [[Gerald Ford]] while playing for the [[University of Michigan]] between 1932 and 1934.]]

In 1939, the [[Riddell Sports Group, Inc.|Riddell]] Company of Chicago, Illinois started manufacturing plastic helmets because it felt that plastic helmets would be safer than those made of leather. Plastic was found to be more effective because it held its shape when full collision contact occurred on a play. These helmets were also much more comfortable and had more padding to cushion the head in an impact. Included with the plastic helmet came plastic face mask, which allowed the helmet to protect the entire head. By the mid-1940s, helmets were required in the [[National Football League|NFL]]. They were still made of leather, but with improved manufacturing techniques had assumed their more familiar spherical shape. The NFL initially allowed either plastic or leather helmets, but in 1948 the league outlawed the plastic helmet, considering the hard-plastic material to be an injury risk. The NFL repealed this rule in 1949, and by 1950, the plastic helmet had become universal in that league.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helmethut.com/062102.html|title=Letters|author=|date=|website=www.helmethut.com|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Introduction of advanced materials===
By the 1950s, the introduction of polymers ended the leather helmet era. The last leather helmet manufacturer, MacGregor, ceased production of leather helmets in the mid-1960s. The NFL also recommended face masks for players in 1955,&lt;ref&gt;'''Factory Made''' television program, segment entitled "Football helmets", [[Science Channel]].&lt;/ref&gt; reducing the number of broken noses and teeth, but also necessitating new rules prohibiting opposing players from grabbing the face mask. By varying accounts, either [[Pat Studstill]] or [[Garo Yepremian]] was the last to forgo the facemask; among non-kickers, [[Tommy McDonald (American football)|Tommy McDonald]] was the last to do so.

===Inflatable padding===
According to Andrew Tucker, football helmets adequately protected players from catastrophic brain injuries, but helmet manufacturers were motivated to design helmets that decrease the risk of concussions. Vin Ferrara,&lt;ref&gt;Shwartz, Alan. 'Helmet Design Absorbs Shock in a New Way' ''The New York Times''. 2007 https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/27/sports/football/27helmets.html&lt;/ref&gt; a former Harvard quarterback, accidentally discovered a new way to cushion football helmets. One night, Ferrara was looking for an aspirin when he saw a squirt bottle in his medicine cabinet. As he pumped it and then punched it, he realized that the bottle withstood the blows of different forces. Ferrara immediately came up with the idea to encase football helmets with a number of inflatable pockets in order to cushion the blows a football player receives and reduce concussions.

More recently, in 2003 Schutt sports introduced their football helmets which contained TPU, or thermoplastic urethane. They would argue that this helps cushion the head more than any other helmet in the market. Schutt also believes that TPU makes the helmet less prone to mold and easier overall to clean and keep sanitary.&lt;ref name="schuttsports.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.schuttsports.com/science-of-domination|title=The Science of Domination {{!}} Schutt Sports|website=www.schuttsports.com|access-date=2017-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visors===
A more recent addition to the football helmet is the visor or eye shield, which is affixed to the [[face cage|face mask]] to protect players from glare or eye injuries, such as pokes. It is believed that the first player to use a protective visor was [[Mark Mullaney]] of the NFL's Minnesota Vikings in 1984, in order to protect a healing eye injury. Top manufacturers of visors are [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Oakley, Inc.|Oakley]], and [[Under Armour]], with Leader being the first to come out with a visor/shield for former [[Chicago Bears]] quarterback [[Jim McMahon]] (who needed the visor because of a childhood eye injury).{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} While Mullaney and McMahon's visors were tinted, most of the earlier visors were clear or smoked, but they are now offered in a variety of styles ranging from blue, gold, black, rainbow, silver, or amber. High-school and pee-wee leagues prohibit all but clear visors. This rule was enacted so that training staff and coaches can easily view a player's face and eyes in the case of a serious injury, to discern if the player is conscious.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} The NCAA banned the use of tinted visors for the same reason, and the NFL has followed suit as well. However, players with eye problems may still obtain special permission to wear tinted visors, some notable examples being [[LaDainian Tomlinson]] and Chris Canty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnronline.com/search_details.php?AID=6002&amp;CHID=3&amp;author=&amp;channelid=3&amp;key=&amp;title= Keep On Tickin' Posted 2006-08-25: The NCAA hopes its new rules shorten games this season.]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:AmericanFootballTraining.jpg|thumb|Players from the [[United States Air Force Academy]] in Colorado Springs wearing football helmets during a drill in 2004]]

===Sensors===
Helmet [[shock data logger]]s and [[shock detector]]s  monitor impacts a player receives, such as the force and direction of the impact. If the force recorded by the sensors is over 100 Gs, it signals a possible concussion.{&lt;ref&gt;University of Denver. "Most concussions deliver 95 g's, neuropsychologist says." ScienceDaily. ScienceDaily, 25 June 2010. &lt;www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/06/100624092526.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;} Some players will experience up to 2,000 of these potential concussion blows each season.This data is then analyzed by doctors.  New rules have been implemented {{vague|date=June 2018}} which instruct that any player who has a particularly high reading of force needs to be taken off the field and examined before they can play another down.

===Headsets===
Two Ohio inventors devised a headset for Cleveland Browns coach Paul Brown so he could radio plays to his quarterback. It was banned shortly after its first use in 1956. The NFL approved use of headsets for all NFL teams in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://operations.nfl.com/the-game/technology/|title=In the NFL, Balancing Technology with Tradition - NFL Football Operations|author=|date=|website=operations.nfl.com|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NFL rules state that all helmets equipped with headsets must have a visible green dot on the back.  A few times in 2006, the holder on the field goal attempt was told to pull up and throw or run at the last second because of a change the coaches saw on the field. According to the NFL, this gave teams an "unfair advantage." The new rules let each team know who is wearing a headset and hearing the plays being called.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

[[File:20090905 Kevin Grady.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kevin Grady]] wearing the [[winged football helmet]].]]

===One-bar face masks===
The one-bar face mask was once common but its use has been supplanted in professional and amateur sport. For example, it has been illegal in the [[National Football League]] since [[2004 NFL season|2004]], but a [[grandfather clause]] allowed players who wore the mask prior to 2004 to continue to do so for the remainder of their careers.  No current professional player currently wears such a face mask; the last player to do so was [[Scott Player]], who last played professionally in 2009.

Typically, by the mid-1980s only [[placekickers]] and [[Punter (American football)|punters]] in professional football in Canada and the United States wore the one-bar face mask, a notable exception being [[quarterback]] [[Joe Theismann]].

The one-bar had two different variations.  The standard one-bar was made from nylon or other hard plastic and was bolted to both side of the helmet just in front of the earholes.  There was a "snub" version that did not extend as far out in front of the helmet as the standard.

Face masks for football helmets today are multibar.  The multibar facemasks are typically constructed out of metal, such as titanium, stainless steel, or most commonly carbon steel. Each facemask is coated with Polyarmor G17, a powder coating that is resistant to impact and corrosion.  The Polyarmor is a thermoplastic coating used on a number of surfaces. While some organizations purchase new face masks every season, others have their equipment reconditioned.

==Recent designs==
In 2002, American football equipment manufacturer [[Riddell Sports Group, Inc.|Riddell]] released a new design of helmet called the Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.riddell1.com/newsite/product_com.php?cPath=104_76_105 Riddell: Product Detail&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The newer design was released in response to a study on concussions. In addition, Riddell has recently come out with a new design of helmets, the Riddell Speed Flex. This helmet came out in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap2000000338193/article/riddell-gaining-attention-with-new-speedflex-updated-technology|title=Riddell gaining attention with new Speedflex, updated technology|work=NFL.com|access-date=2017-05-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new helmet uses elements of Riddell's older helmets, the 360 and the Revolution, such as Side Impact Protection and All Points Quick Release face mask attachment system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.riddell.com/speedflex#story|title=About Riddell Speedflex Helmet - Buy New Football Impact Helmets|website=www.riddell.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Iowa_St_Helmet_Riddell_Speed.jpg|thumb|Iowa St Riddell Speed Helmet|214x214px]]

In [[2007 in sports|2007]], [[Schutt Sports]] announced the arrival of a next generation helmet, the Schutt ION 4D. This next generation design was in response to the demand for a safer football helmet.  The design includes an integrated face guard. This new face guard design features shock absorbing "Energy Wedges" that reduce the force of impacts to the face guard. College teams wearing the helmet include [[Air Force Falcons football|Air Force]], [[Penn State Nittany Lions football|Penn State]] and [[Virginia Cavaliers football|Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schuttsports.com/aspx/feature/WhosInIt.aspx|title=The Science of Domination - Schutt Sports|author=|date=|website=www.schuttsports.com|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schutt has also distinguished between their varsity helmets and youth helmets. The varsity helmets from Schutt are made with polycarbonate, which is a very strong polymer designed to take bigger hits. The Schutt youth helmets however; are made from ABS, which is a lighter material, meant for kids who do not take as powerful of hits.&lt;ref name="schuttsports.com" /&gt;

Recently, a brand new type of helmet has come into play. Vicis is a new company that is producing helmets that have a softer outer layer. The softer layer absorbs more energy from impacts. In addition, the inside of the helmet also has a foam like substance which absorbs energy and improves comfort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-vicis-football-helmet/|title=This Football Helmet Crumples—and That's Good|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reliance on NOCSAE certification has been criticized on numerous grounds, including that organization's control by equipment manufacturers causes a conflict of interest, testing data that focuses on skull fractures instead of concussions, and failure to take into account new research.&lt;ref name="Borden" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nowinski"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nowinski |first1=Chris |title=Head Games: Football's Concussion Crisis from the NFL to Youth Leagues |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pgH8Sk2FRi0C&amp;pg=PA116&amp;lpg=PA116&amp;dq=NOCSAE |year=2006 |isbn=9781597630139 |pages=110, 116}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Culverhouse"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Culverhouse |first1=Gay |title=Throwaway Players: Concussion Crisis From Pee Wee Football to the NFL |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eJpbcYH6yNgC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;lpg=PA79&amp;dq=NOCSAE |year=2011 |publisher=Behler Publications |isbn=9781933016702 |page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common NOCSAE test is the  drop test. This test uses a 13-pound dummy head full of sensors and a gelatin material. The head and helmet is dropped from a height of 60 at one of the six NOCSAE specified locations on the helmet. These locations include the front, rear, left side, right side, right boss, and left boss. The sensors in the dummy head measure the amount of force that the head experiences. The NOCSAE has certain regulations such as the peak severity index can never  more than1200 SI. If a helmet fails to meet these requirements, they do not pass the NOCSAE drop test.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nj.com/rutgersfootball/index.ssf/2017/04/behind_the_scenes_look_at_how_a_rutgers_nfl_or_hig.html

===Current research===
There has been significant study/research regarding head injuries in football, as well as football helmet design in recent years.  [[Kevin Guskiewicz]], a professor at [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|The University of North Carolina]] and a [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur Fellow]], has for many years been researching [[Concussions in American football|concussions in football]] of all age groups.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unc.edu/spotlight/Guskiewicz-wins-MacArthur&lt;/ref&gt;  He has been equipping UNC football helmets with accelerometers to measure impacts and concussions.   Also, the [[National Football League|NFL]] has awarded over $1.6 million in sports medical research, almost $1 million of which has been toward concussion prevention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d81d15901/printable/nfl-charities-awards-grants-for-sports-medical-research|title=NFL Charities awards grants for sports medical research - NFL.com|author=|date=|website=www.nfl.com|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; All this concussion prevention research has led football helmet manufacturers to develop safer products.  A joint effort between [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University|Virginia Tech]] and [[Wake Forest University|Wake Forest]] has been testing current football helmets and giving them yearly ratings since 2011.  On a scale out of 5 stars, only one helmet was awarded a 5 in 2011. In 2012, two additional helmet designs were awarded 5 stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.wsls.com/news/2012/may/01/10/virginia-tech-helmet-ratings-released-ar-1881592/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601092556/http://www2.wsls.com/news/2012/may/01/10/virginia-tech-helmet-ratings-released-ar-1881592/ |archivedate=2012-06-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbes.vt.edu/nid|title=Virginia Tech Helmet Ratings|first=|last=Html5TemplatesDreamweaver.com|date=|website=www.sbes.vt.edu|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversies revolving around football helmets always regard their ability to decrease head/brain injury rates, including concussions. However, recent research has begun to assess the tests specifically employed to create the safest football equipment. In 2015, David Camarillo at Stanford conducted a study that suggested football helmet tests did not account for the delay between injury-causing brain movement and stress impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.stanford.edu/2015/07/20/football-helmet-tests-072015/|title=Stanford research: football helmet tests may not account for concussion-prone actions|last=University|first=Stanford|date=2015-07-20|website=Stanford News|access-date=2017-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other research===
Neuroscientists  at Ohio State University launched baseballs from air cannons at football helmets in order to simulate a kick or blow to the head such as a tackle. It was found that the helmets could withstand 2,500 Newtons or about 562 pounds of force.

Vijay Gupta, a professor at UCLA, has done research and produced a special polymer that if added as a layer on the inside of football helmets can produce up to a 25% decrease in the g-forces a player would experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsroom.ucla.edu/stories/developing-new-materials-to-prevent-248008|title=Making football helmets safer to prevent concussions|first=Mike|last=Fricano|date=|website=UCLA Newsroom|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This reduction of forces would produce a similar amount of reduction of the probability of a player suffering a concussion from the same hits.

==Logo display==
===National Football League===
In 1948, the [[Los Angeles Rams]] were the first NFL team to put logos on their helmets; the basic "ram's horn" logo on the helmet has remained mostly the same, except for color, ever since. {{as of|2018}} the [[Cleveland Browns]] are the last remaining NFL teams not using any form of primary logo on its helmets. The [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] are the only NFL team that puts its logo on only one side of the helmet (the right side),{{why?|date=June 2018}} while the [[Cincinnati Bengals]], after using a wordmark for a helmet logo into the 1980s, use a striping pattern instead of a logo.

[[File:Croke Park fans on the hill.jpg|thumb|right|Fans of [[Cork GAA|Cork]] (red and white) and [[Meath GAA|Meath]] (green and yellow) on [[Hill 16]] in [[Croke Park]] watching the [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship 2007]] semifinal.]]
The '''county colours''' of an [[Counties of Ireland|Irish county]] are the colours of the kit worn by [[GAA county|that county's representative team]] in the inter-county competitions of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] (GAA), the most important of which are the [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]] and the [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship]].  Fans attending matches often wear replica jerseys, and wave [[flag]]s and [[banner]]s in the county colours.  In the build-up to a major match, flags and [[Bunting (textile)|bunting]] are flown or hung from cars, buildings, telegraph poles, and other fixtures across the county, especially in those regions where GAA support is strong.

Where a county's jersey is multi-coloured, these are the county colours.  Where the jersey is a single colour, the colour of the shorts is also included.  Shorts were formerly always white, but some counties adopted coloured shorts from the 1960s, such as [[Dublin GAA|Dublin]]'s now familiar navy blue. 

In the early years of the All-Ireland championships, each county was formally represented by the club which won its county championship;  players from other clubs within the county were soon added to reinforce the squad, and gradually from 1900 county committees took over the selection of the team. At that date most inter-county teams still wore the kit of the champion club, but by 1910 some counties had adopted a standard strip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cronin |first1=Mike |last2=Duncan |first2=Mark |last3=Rouse |first3=Paul |title=The GAA : county by county |date=2011 |publisher=Collins Press |location=Cork |isbn=9781848891289 |pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1913 [[GAA Congress]] passed a motion proposed by [[P. D. Mehigan]] and seconded by [[Harry Boland]], "That a distinctive county colour be compulsory for inter-county, inter-provincial and All-Ireland contests, such colours to be approved of by the Provincial Councils concerned and registered with Central Council."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Maher |first1=Jim |title=Harry Boland |date=1998 |publisher=Mercier Press |isbn=9781856352369 |page=18 |language=en}}; {{cite web |title=Agenda for 1913 Congress |url=http://www.gaa.ie/centenary/administrative-docs/agenda-f/ |website=Centenary |publisher=GAA |accessdate=9 August 2018 |page=2, Motion 15 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flags==
[[File:Dublin Castle Upper Yard county flags.jpg|thumb|Flags with counties' colours and [[List of Irish counties' coats of arms|coats of arms]] flying in the Upper Yard at [[Dublin Castle]]]]
While [[List of Irish counties' coats of arms|each county council has a coat of arms]], there are no official county flags.  Flags with the GAA county colours serve as de facto county flags.  However, there are no standardised formats for these, except [[Kildare GAA|Kildare]] whose flag, like their kit, is all-white. Typically, flags are formed as vertical bicolours or tricolours. Usually, the major colour is nearer the hoist. Moreover, horizontal stripes are used by some individuals. (This is common in [[County Offaly]], where vertical county colours might be mistaken for the [[flag of Ireland]]; however other Offaly fans deliberately exploit this double significance.)

Flags with [[checkerboard]], repeating stripes, and other patterns are also found.  In recent years, flags have been commercially produced which feature the county's GAA logo on the flag.  These logos are sometimes based on the official county coat-of-arms, but some have been replaced with unrelated designs.  Fans may also wave other flags of the appropriate colours.  For example, among the red-and-white flags used by individual [[Cork GAA]] supporters have been the [[flag of Canada]] and the [[ensign of the Imperial Japanese Navy]].  As Cork is nicknamed the "Rebel County", its fans have also flown the [[Confederate Flag#Confederate flag|Rebel Flag]] of the [[American Civil War]]. With the Blue and Gold flags used by individual [[Tipperary GAA]] supporters, there has been the [[Flag of Sweden]] and the [[Flag of Ukraine]]. Mayo fans have used the flags of Italy, [[Portugal]] and [[Bangladesh]]. Kerry supporters have been seen to wave Brazilian flags due to the similar colours and fact that Brazil have always dominated soccer while Kerry are considered the "Brazil of Gaelic Football" due to their enormous success at the sport.

'''''Ice Princess''''' is a 2005 American figure-skating film directed by [[Tim Fywell]], written by Hadley Davis from a story by [[Meg Cabot]] and Davis, and starring [[Michelle Trachtenberg]], [[Joan Cusack]], [[Kim Cattrall]] and [[Hayden Panettiere]]. The film focuses on Casey Carlyle, a normal teenager who gives up a promising future academic life in order to pursue her new-found dream of being a professional [[Figure skating|figure skater]]. The film was released on March 18, 2005. ''Ice Princess'' had an unsuccessful performance at the box office, grossing $24 million in the United States during its theatrical run against a production budget of $25 million.

==Plot==
Casey Carlyle ([[Michelle Trachtenberg]]) a very smart and talented science student, plans to pursue a scholarship to [[Harvard University]]. For the scholarship, Casey must present a personal summer project about [[physics]]. While watching a [[figure skating]] competition with her mathematically inclined friend Ann, Casey realizes that her favorite childhood hobby, [[ice skating]], would make a perfect project. She decides to try to improve her own skating by applying physics and what she has discovered from watching other skaters.

She becomes proficient and skips two levels to become a junior skater. She helps junior skaters Gennifer "Gen" Harwood ([[Hayden Panettiere]]) Tiffany Lai (Jocelyn Lai) and Nikki Fletcher ([[Kirsten Olson]]) improve their skating. Torn between her Harvard dream and her growing love of skating, Casey has difficulty juggling schoolwork, skating, and a part-time job. Joan Carlyle ([[Joan Cusack]]) Casey's mother, attempts to prevent Casey from skating due to her declining academic performance. Meanwhile, tension arises between Casey's mother and Casey's coach Tina Harwood ([[Kim Cattrall]]), a disgraced former skater.

Tina, who manages the rink where Casey trains, has Gen on a strict training program. During a competition where both Casey and Gen compete, Tina sees that Casey may outrank Gen, and attempts to sabotage Casey's performance by switching her skates. Upset at this, and frustrated by all the restrictions of training, Gen quits. Casey declines the Harvard scholarship competition to devote herself to skating to her mother's dismay. Casey asks Tina to be her personal coach and help her train for [[Figure skating competition#Qualifying competitions in the United States|sectionals]]. Her mother, upset at this change of direction in her life, refuses to watch her skate.

At the sectionals, Casey's mind is not fully focused on the competition and she falls while attempting a triple [[salchow jump]]. To her surprise, she discovers that her mother is in the audience. Inspired, Casey gives a highly rated artistic performance. The sectionals ends with Nikki going to the nationals and Casey becoming the runner-up. Gen's brother, Teddy ([[Trevor Blumas]]), gives Casey flowers to congratulate her, and they kiss. Later, Joan and Tina bicker about how many college courses Casey should take, Teddy and Casey's budding [[Romance (love)|romance]], Casey's sponsors, and Casey's future in figure skating.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1666">The '''J.W. Isenhour Tennis Center''' houses the men's and women's [[tennis]] programs of [[North Carolina State University]] in [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]], [[North Carolina]]. It is located across the street from [[Doak Field]] on the NC State campus.

Completed in 2004, the facility was named in honor of a former head coach of the men's tennis program, who led it to the [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]] Championships in 1978 and 79, and to play in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] Championship in 1978.

==Facilities==

In 2004, the facility was granted the [[United States Tennis Association]]'s Outstanding Facility award, making it one of only four collegiate facilities to have received the award, and one of fifteen nationwide.

Currently, the complex has four inside [[tennis court]]s, and six outside tennis courts. Renovations are in progress to upgrade the outdoor seating area to 1000 seats, from the current 200. Also, the complex includes locker rooms, a lounge for the players, and public restrooms.

'''Kirkuk Olympic Stadium''', is a multi-use [[stadium]] in [[Kirkuk]], [[Iraq]].  It is currently used mostly for [[football (soccer)|football]] matches and it also has an athletics track.  The stadium holds 24,000.&lt;ref name="k1"&gt;{{Cite web |author= |date= |url=https://www.facebook.com/Abtaan/videos/1849596898465397/ |title=تقرير عمل اليوم في ملعب كركوك الأولمبي ٢٤٠٠٠ متفرج . |work= |publisher=[[عبد الحسين عبطان]] |accessdate=2018-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium was built in 1982 for an Olympics that never happened. After the fall of the former regime in 2003 at least 500 [[Kurds]] displaced by [[Saddam Hussein]]'s forced resettlement "Arabization" policy returned to Kirkuk and settled in the stadium. The families stayed in the ground for more than seven years, only recently moving on.

The stadium refurbishment is being done in two phases. First the stadium is being comprehensively rebuilt. Phase two will augment the facilities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="74592">In [[Rugby league|rugby league football]], the '''Laws of the Game''' are the rules governing how the sport is played.&lt;ref name="ILG-2004-p1"&gt;[[#RLIF-ILG-2004|RLIF, 2004]]: 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ARL-laws-2009-p1"&gt;[[#ARL-laws-2009|ARL, 2009]]: 1&lt;/ref&gt; The Laws are the responsibility of the [[Rugby League International Federation]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rlif.com/about_the_rlif/regulations_and_laws The Laws of Rugby League]&lt;/ref&gt; and cover the play, officiating, equipment and procedures of the game. 

The Laws have undergone significant changes since pioneers of the sport broke away from the [[Rugby football]] establishment in 1895. The sport has been described as a "constantly evolving animal, particularly with professional coaches, [with which] the rules have to keep pace".&lt;ref name="fagan20-11-07"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rl1908.com/blog/rules-fix.htm |title=Evolving animal |last=Fagan |first=Sean |date=2007-11-20 |publisher=rl1908.com |accessdate=7 January 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5masdTO86?url=http://www.rl1908.com/blog/rules-fix.htm |archivedate= 7 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laws==
The current ''Laws of the Game'' and ''Notes on the Laws'' are set out in 17 sections:&lt;ref name="ILG-2004-p1"/&gt;
* Section&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1: [[Rugby league playing field|Playing Field]]
* Section&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2: [[List of rugby league terms|Glossary]]
* Section&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3: [[Football (ball)#Rugby football|Ball]]

The current 17 sections, which include notes, are detailed in fewer than 50 pages and around 17,000 words. The Laws therefore have some flexibility to enable decisions to be made without the need to amend them. For example, Section 15, Law 1 (i) considers behaviour "in any way contrary to the true spirit of the game" to be misconduct.&lt;ref name="ILG-2004-p38"&gt;[[#RLIF-ILG-2004|RLIF, 2004]]: 38&lt;/ref&gt; That law has been used to prevent [[List of rugby league terms#Chicken wing|chicken-wing tackling techniques]], for example.&lt;ref name="rfl-disciplinary"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.therfl.co.uk/about/disciplinary_item.php?id=791 |publisher=The RFL |work=Disciplinary |title=Case number: ON/89/09 |author=RFL |accessdate=2009-07-30 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5n9UORpDk?url=http://www.therfl.co.uk/about/disciplinary_item.php?id=791 |archivedate=29 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bott16-04-08"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/rugbyleague/article-1015649/RUGBY-LEAGUE-RFL-determined-stop-outlawed-chicken-wing-tackle.html |publisher=Mail Online |title=RFL determined to stop outlawed 'chicken-wing' tackle |author=Richard Bott |date=2008-04-16 |accessdate=2008-07-30 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5nM17iVVF?url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/rugbyleague/article-1015649/RUGBY-LEAGUE-RFL-determined-stop-outlawed-chicken-wing-tackle.html |archivedate= 7 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==

===Rugby football===
The rules of football as played at [[Rugby School]] in the 19th century were decided regularly and informally by the pupils. For many years the rules were unwritten.&lt;ref name="IRB-2007-10-22"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.irb.com/history/halloffame/newsid=2026170.html |title=2006: The Rugby School Legacy - The Laws |author=IRB.com |date=2007-10-22 |publisher=International Rugby Board |accessdate=29 May 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5q5yhdDmY?url=http://www.irb.com/history/halloffame/newsid=2026170.html |archivedate=29 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1845 three pupils at the school, [[William Delafield Arnold]], [[Walter Waddington Shirley]] and Frederick Leigh Hutchins were tasked with writing a codified set of rules by the then [[Head Schoolboy]] and football captain Isaac Gregory Smith.&lt;ref name="IRB-2007-10-22"/&gt; The three pupils submitted 37 rules which were approved on 28 August 1845.&lt;ref name="trueman2006-laws"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/laws.htm |title=History of the Laws of Rugby Football |last=Trueman |first=Nigel |year=2006 |publisher=rugbyfootballhistory.com |accessdate=5 January 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5mYyEija4?url=http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/laws.htm |archivedate= 5 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rugby-laws-1845"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/resources/Laws/Full/Rugby%20School%20Laws%201845.pdf |title=Laws of Football |author1=Delafield Arnold, William |author2=Shirley, W.W. |author3=Hutchins, Frederick |date=1845-08-28 |publisher=J.S.

Unions were formed to govern the game in other countries but the English RFU continued to control the Laws until 1885.&lt;ref name="rfumuseum-historyofgame"/&gt; In 1884, there had been a dispute over the rules between the English and Scottish unions after a match between the two countries;&lt;ref name="rfumuseum-historyofgame"/&gt; this led to the formation of the [[International Rugby Board|International Rugby Football Board]] in 1886 with the intention of settling such disputes.&lt;ref name="trueman2006-laws"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rfumuseum-historyofgame"/&gt; The RFU refused to join and in 1887 the members of the new organisation, [[Irish Rugby Football Union|Ireland]], [[Scottish Rugby Union|Scotland]] and [[Welsh Rugby Union|Wales]], stated that no matches would be played against England until the RFU joined and accepted its rules.&lt;ref name="trueman2006-laws"/&gt; In 1890 the RFU joined and in 1892 a significant revision of the laws took place.&lt;ref name="trueman2006-laws"/&gt;

===Rugby league===
From 1895, the year of the [[History_of_rugby_league#The_schism_in_England|schism]] in the game, the laws of rugby league were initially referred to as "Northern Union" rules, after the new governing body, and were a slight variation on the rules of rugby football as played at that time.&lt;ref name="fagan01-04-08"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rl1908.com/History/northern-union.htm |title=To the last day of the Northern Union |last=Fagan |first=Sean |date=2008-04-01 |publisher=rl1908.com |accessdate=3 January 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5nM1asVTx?url=http://www.rl1908.com/History/northern-union.htm |archivedate= 7 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; What began as modifications to make the competition more entertaining to spectators continued until a distinct sport had emerged.&lt;ref name="oralhist-rulechanges-2007"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rugbyleagueoralhistory.co.uk/subjects/view/rule-changes |title=Rule changes |year=2007 |work=Interviews |publisher=The Rugby League Oral History Project |accessdate=6 January 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5mZMMp6DE?url=http://www.rugbyleagueoralhistory.co.uk/subjects/view/rule-changes |archivedate= 6 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially the rules were decided by the Northern Rugby Football Union, today's [[Rugby Football League]], the governing body for rugby league in the United Kingdom. As the sport spread to around the world, other rugby leagues were established, notably in Australia, France and New Zealand, a more international approach was adopted. In 1948, the [[Rugby League International Federation#International Rugby League Board|International Rugby League Board]] (IRLB) was formed.&lt;ref name="edgar-ORconquer-09-98"&gt;{{Citation |last=Edgar |first=Harry | publication-date =September 1998  | date =  | year =1998 |title=Can League conquer the world? |pages=14–17| periodical =Open Rugby  | series =  | place =Brighouse, UK  | publisher =League Publications  | volume =  | issue =210 | issn =0958-5427}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the RFL retained this responsibility for the Laws while it was seen how the new Board would develop.&lt;ref name="goodman26-01-1948"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Goodman |first=Tom |title=Board urges trial of new R.L. rule |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18058684 |publisher=''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' |accessdate=14 May 2010 |page=7 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5q5o2E9pu?url=http://newspapers.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/18058684 |archivedate=29 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IRLB was invested with responsibility for the Laws later.

During the [[Super League war]], a dispute over media rights and the control of the game originating in Australia, the laws of rugby league were altered by the rival factions, the IRLB and its only remaining member, the Australian Rugby League, and the [[Super League International Board]] and its members.

Since 1998 when the different sides reunited, the Laws have been the responsibility of the [[Rugby League International Federation]].

==History of changes to the Laws==
The Northern Rugby Football Union inherited the existing laws of rugby football, as played until that time by its member clubs. The NRFU immediately made changes. In addition to the time before 1948 when an international governing body was established, members of the International Federation and its predecessors have had the authority to make significant changes to the Laws applied within their jurisdiction.

'''The following is an incomplete list''' of changes made to the laws of rugby league since the [[History of rugby league#The schism in England|1895 schism]]. Changes to the laws used for senior competitions within the jurisdictions of RLIF members with test nation status are included here.

{{Small|Additional detail: ''Included are the flags or icons of the territory affected as well as the name of the governing body responsible and a link to the first season the change was implemented in senior competition(s) by that body. If a Law has since been changed, the Law's current status is indicated, and a link given to the year of the change in this article.''}}

'''Life Style Sports (Ireland) Limited''' is Ireland's largest sports retailer, operating 53 outlets spread across the [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. They stock [[sporting goods]] and sport fashions.

== History ==
[[File:Life Style Sports Flagship Store, Mary Street, Dublin 1, 2014.jpg|thumb|300px|Life Style Sports in Mary Street, [[Dublin]]]]

Life Style Sports was established in 1979 in the Republic of Ireland by [[Quinnsworth]], a subsidiary of Associated British Foods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lifestylesports.com/en/restofworld/page/storysofar]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 it was bought by [[Tesco]] PLC but was later spun off via a [[management buy-out]] of seven directors, led by MD Andrew Sharkey and [[venture capital]] firm, ACT.

In November 2005, it was acquired by Stafford Holdings – an Irish family-owned company who stated, "This latest acquisition is in line with its stated strategy of seeking acquisition opportunities in new sectors which offer strong growth potential, while maintaining a strong commitment to its current portfolio of businesses."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/news/2005/1129/stafford-business.html Stafford Holdings buys Lifestyle Sports – RTÉ News]. Rte.ie (30 January 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, former [[Dunnes Stores]] senior director Eoin McGettigan was appointed CEO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/news/2006/1108/sports-business.html Lifestyle Sports names Dunnes Executive as CEO – RTÉ News]. Rte.ie (26 January 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Stafford took up the role of chairman. In early 2009, Mark Stafford replaced McGettigan as CEO. He was joined by former [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] Ireland general manager Nigel Cowman as Finance Director, Dan Ryan from Penneys and Brown Thomas as Trading Director.

In September 2007 a new flagship store opened in the [[Blanchardstown Centre]], [[Dublin]]. This remained their largest store, at {{convert|21000|sqft}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishjobs.ie/member.asp?Mid=1267 Lifestyle Sports Ltd Jobs – Jobs in Ireland]. irishjobs.ie.&lt;/ref&gt; until 2017.  In July 2017, the company's new flagship store opened in The Capitol building [[St Patrick's Street]] in [[Cork (city)|Cork]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.businessworld.ie/news/Life-Style-Sports-opens-new-flagship-store-in-Cork-568838.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Life Style Sports became the official retail partner of [[Leinster Rugby]], with a Life Style Sports store located in [[Donnybrook Stadium]] and the [[Royal Dublin Society|Royal Dublin Society (RDS)]], home of Leinster Rugby.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leinsterrugby.ie/news/10535.php#.U58VmJRdXTo]&lt;/ref&gt; Life Style Sports is also the official retail partner of [[Munster Rugby]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lifestylesports.com/en/restofworld/rugby/munster-rugby/icat/page/rugbymunsterrugbyabout]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Luzhniki Palace of Sports''', formerly the '''Palace of Sports of the Central Lenin Stadium''', is a sports arena in Moscow, Russia, a part of the [[Luzhniki Olympic Complex]]. Built in 1956, it originally had a spectator capacity of 13,700. In the past it was the host site of the world and European championships in [[ice hockey]], [[gymnastics]], [[volleyball]], [[basketball]], [[boxing]], [[skateboarding]] and other sports.

It hosted several games during the 1972 [[Summit Series]] ice hockey tournament between the [[Soviet Union national ice hockey team|Soviet Union]] and [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Canada]] and was a venue for [[Gymnastics at the 1980 Summer Olympics|gymnastics]] and [[Judo at the 1980 Summer Olympics|judo]] events at the [[1980 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1980/or1980v2pt1.pdf 1980 Summer Olympics official report.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081118143909/http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1980/or1980v2pt1.pdf |date=2008-11-18 }} Volume 2. Part 1. pp. 58–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the arena experienced a major reconstruction and the [[seating capacity]] was lowered to 11,500. The arena subsequently hosted the [[2005 World Figure Skating Championships]]. It was primarily used for [[ice hockey]] as the home arena for [[HC Dynamo Moscow]] until the year 2000,&lt;ref name="stadium"&gt;[http://www.dynamo.ru/stadium.php Стадион] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519075323/http://www.dynamo.ru/stadium.php |date=2009-05-19 }} {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the club moved to [[Luzhniki Small Sports Arena]].&lt;ref name="stadium"/&gt;

'''''Ozark Ike''''' was a [[newspaper]] [[comic strip]] about dumb but likable Ozark Ike McBatt, a youth from a rural area in the mountains. The strip was created by Rufus A. ("Ray") Gotto while he was serving in the [[US Navy|Navy]] during [[World War II]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] as an illustrator for Navy instruction manuals.

==Characters and story==
Strong-but-simple Ike McBatt is from a [[hillbilly]] family living in the small backwoods community of Wildweed Run (pop. 49). Ozark Ike is an all-around athlete, playing [[baseball]], [[American football|football]] and [[basketball]]. Between seasons, he enters the [[boxing]] ring. The characters and the baseball park settings are apparently inspired by [[Ring Lardner]]'s well-known baseball short story "Alibi Ike" (1915), filmed in 1935 as the comedy ''Alibi Ike'', starring [[Joe E. Brown (comedian)|Joe E. Brown]] in the title role and [[Olivia de Havilland]] in her film debut.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

Ozark Ike's girlfriend is Dinah Fatfield, whose family has been involved in a feud with the McBatt clan for several generations. As is evident in the names, this background situation was inspired by the [[Hatfield-McCoy feud]].

==Personnel==
Gotto is famous for using extreme perspectives to achieve great drama an action in sports. As such ''Ozark Ike'' attracted publisher [[Stephen Slesinger]]'s attention. Slesinger also owned ''[[Red Ryder]]'', ''[[King of the Royal Mounted]]'', US and Canadian rights to ''[[Winnie-the-Pooh]]'', and had exclusive licensing arrangements for other notable fictional characters including Tarzan and all of the NEA newspaper comics. Slesinger produced the cartoon for distribution through [[King Features Syndicate]], and it debuted November 12, 1945. 

One of the assistants on the strip was Fred Rhoads. Gotto left in 1954, but the strip continued until 1959 under [[Bill Lignante]] and [[George Olesen]]. Lignante was also a leading courtroom artist for network television, and is most famous as the artist who created hundreds of drawings of famous patrons that decorate the Palm Restaurants. 

Gotto eventually went on to design the [[New York Mets]] logo.

"Ozark Ike" was the nickname of [[Major League Baseball|major league]] baseball players [[Gus Zernial]] {{Cn span|and [[Ralph Kiner]]|date=November 2013}}.

'''Palace House''' is the home of Great Britain’s National Heritage Centre of Horseracing and Sporting Art in the remaining part of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]'s racing palace in [[Newmarket, Suffolk]], England. It is home to the '''National Horseracing Museum''', the '''British Sporting Art Trust''' and [[Retraining of Racehorses]], and was opened by [[Elizabeth II]] in 2016.

==National Horseracing Museum==
The National Horseracing Museum of the United Kingdom, a [[Charitable organization|registered charity]],&lt;ref&gt;{{EW charity|283656|THE NATIONAL HORSERACING MUSEUM}}&lt;/ref&gt; tells the story of horse racing from its earliest origins to the world-wide phenomenon it is today. This is explored through works of art, silver, bronzes and artifacts including silks worn by famous jockeys such as Lester Piggott and Frankie Dettori. Using the latest interactive and audio-visual displays, the museum also takes a different look at the sport, examining the physical attributes of the elite equine athlete and the importance of thoroughbred pedigree.

It contains collections and records of people and horses involved in the sport of [[horse racing]] from its [[Monarchy|royal]] origins to the present day. Exhibits include the history of horse racing, horse racing in Britain, trophies, paintings of famous horses, trainers and jockeys, jockey uniforms, betting, and horse racing memorabilia. The '''Vestey Gallery of British Sporting Art''' is located in the museum, and features changing exhibits of art relating to sports, including [[hunting]], [[shooting]], fishing, [[boxing]], [[archery]], [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]] and horse racing.

==The British Sporting Art Trust==

The British Sporting Art Trust, a registered charity,&lt;ref&gt;{{EW charity|274156|THE BRITISH SPORTING ART TRUST}}&lt;/ref&gt; hosts a large collection of important pieces of British sporting art at Palace House. In the remaining part of Charles II’s racing palace is the Fred Packard Museum and Galleries of British Sporting Art and a new home for the British Sporting Art Trust. Paintings by [[George Stubbs]] and [[Sir Alfred Munnings]] rub shoulders with works from [[John Singer Sargent]] and [[John Wootton]], showcasing some of the finest examples of British Sporting Art.

The gallery explores the development of popular sporting images through paintings, sculpture, print-making and the applied arts. Significant loans have come from the [[Tate Museum|Tate]] and the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]], along with a number of private and public art collections. 

==Retraining of Racehorses==

Retraining of Racehorses hosts a number of retired racehorses in the  '''Rothschild Yard''' in the Palace House grounds to meet with members of the public.

==List of horses==
The National Horseracing Museum contains an extensive archive of images from glass negatives with accompanying biographies. The list includes both runners and breeding stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Horseracing History Online - Browse Archive (Horses)|url=http://www.horseracinghistory.co.uk/hrho/action/viewBrowse|website=www.horseracinghistory.co.uk|accessdate=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Séraphin "Séra" Martin''' (2 July 1906 – 23 April 1993) was a [[France|French]] [[Middle-distance running|middle-distance runner]] who set [[List of world records in athletics|world records]] in the [[800 metres]] and [[1000 metres world record progression|1000 metres]]. He competed at the 1928 and 1932 Olympics and placed sixth and eighth in the 800 metres, respectively.

==Career==

Martin set a [[List of world records in athletics|world record]] at [[1000 metres]] in 1926, running 2:26.8 to break [[Sven Lundgren]]'s old record of 2:28.6.&lt;ref name="butler"&gt;{{citation |author1=Butler, Mark |author2=IAAF Media &amp; Public Relations Department |publisher=[[International Association of Athletics Federations]] |title=IAAF Statistics Handbook Daegu 2011 |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks before the [[1928 Summer Olympics]], Martin ran [[800 metres]] in 1:50.6, breaking [[Otto Peltzer]]'s world record by a full second.&lt;ref name="butler"/&gt;{{#tag:ref|The qualitative difference between these records was much smaller. Peltzer's time of 1:51.6 was set at 880 yards and was roughly equivalent to 1:50.9 for 800 metres.&lt;ref name="jukola"/&gt;&lt;ref name="otto"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/pe/otto-peltzer-1.html |title=Otto Peltzer Bio, Stats and Results |publisher=Sports Reference LLC |accessdate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="note"}} This established him as one of the favourites for the [[1928 Summer Olympics|Olympics]] in [[Amsterdam]].&lt;ref name="jukola"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sr"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1928/ATH/mens-800-metres.html |title=Athletics at the 1928 Amsterdam Summer Games: Men's 800 metres |publisher=Sports Reference LLC |accessdate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did make the [[Athletics at the 1928 Summer Olympics &amp;ndash; Men's 800 metres|Olympic final]], but was never a major factor in the race&lt;ref name="jukola"/&gt; and finished sixth in a time of 1:54.6,&lt;ref name="srsm"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/ma/sera-martin-1.html |title=Séra Martin Bio, Stats and Results |publisher=Sports Reference LLC |accessdate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; clearly slower than the 1:53.0 he ran in the semi-finals.&lt;ref name="srsm"/&gt;

He returned to the Olympics in [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932]], placing eighth with a time of 1:53.6.&lt;ref name="srsm"/&gt; Martin was one of the [[Pacemaker (running)|pacemakers]] when [[Jules Ladoumègue]] set his world record at [[1500 metres]].&lt;ref name="jukola"&gt;{{cite book |title=Huippu-urheilun historia |year=1935 |publisher=[[Werner Söderström Osakeyhtiö]] |author=Jukola, Martti |language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vivint Smart Home Arena''' is an [[list of indoor arenas|indoor arena]] located in [[Salt Lake City|Salt Lake City, Utah]]. The building is owned by the [[Gail Miller (businesswoman)|Miller Family]] [[trust law|Legacy Trust]]. The arena is the home of the [[Utah Jazz]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) and has been the home venue for other professional athletic teams such as the [[Utah Blaze]] of the [[Arena Football League]] and the [[Utah Starzz]] of the [[Women's National Basketball Association]] (WNBA). It seats 18,306 for basketball, has 56 [[luxury suites]], and 668 [[club seating|club seats]].

Opened in 1991, the arena was known as the '''Delta Center''', under a [[naming rights]] deal with [[Delta Air Lines]], which has a hub at [[Salt Lake City International Airport]]. Salt Lake City-based [[EnergySolutions]] purchased the naming rights in November 2006, after Delta decided not to renew their 15-year contract due to filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy the year prior. From 2006 to 2015 it was known as '''EnergySolutions Arena'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/jazz/energysolutions-arena|title=EnergySolutions Arena|website=nba.com|publisher=[[Utah Jazz]]|date=November 20, 2006|accessdate=March 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ksl.com/?nid=148&amp;sid=661171|title=Delta Center Renamed EnergySolutions Arena|last1=Anderton|first1=Dave|last2=Osterloh|first2=Shelly|work=[[KSL-TV|ksl.com]]|publisher=[[Deseret Digital Media]]|location=Salt Lake City|date=November 20, 2006|accessdate=March 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 26, 2015, the arena was renamed as part of a 10-year naming rights contract with the [[Provo, Utah]]-based home security system provider [[Vivint]].&lt;ref name="VivintJazzArena"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lea|first=Bill|title=LHM Sports &amp; Entertainment Introduces Vivint Smart Home Arena for the Utah Jazz|url=http://www.nba.com/jazz/news/lhm-sports-entertainment-introduces-vivint-smart-home-arena-utah-jazz|website=UtahJazz.com|publisher=Utah Jazz|date=October 26, 2015|accessdate=March 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arena was also home to the [[Figure skating at the 2002 Winter Olympics|figure skating]] and [[Short track speed skating at the 2002 Winter Olympics|short track speed skating]] competitions of the [[2002 Winter Olympics]], where it was referred to as the '''Salt Lake Ice Center'''.

==History==
[[File:Energy Solutions Arena.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Interior arena bowl, 2006.]]
The arena was originally imagined as 20,000-seat home for the [[Utah Jazz]] and [[Salt Lake Golden Eagles]] to replace the since-demolished arena of the [[Salt Palace (arena)|Salt Palace]], which had 12,616 seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Will Delta Center Pack in the Fans? Ticket Sales Say Yes|last=Hemphill|first=Lex|newspaper=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|location=Salt Lake City|page=A6|date=September 29, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the leadership and private financing of Utah businessman [[Larry H. Miller]], ground was broken on May 22, 1990, and it was completed on October 4, 1991 in time for late-October basketball games, at a cost of $93 million (${{formatprice|{{Inflation|US|93000000|1991}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Truss Erection System Scores at Utah Arena|first=Richard|last=Sandomir|publisher=[[Engineering News-Record]] vol. 226|date=October 21, 1991|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{inflation-fn|US}} &lt;!-- need material about the government land grant and partial financing --&gt;

The first game played in the arena was a Golden Eagles match against the [[Peoria Rivermen (IHL)|Peoria Rivermen]] on October 16, 1991, which the home team lost 4–2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Eagles Disappoint|last=Kragthorpe|first=Kurt|newspaper=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|location=Salt Lake City|page=C1|date=October 17, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Eagles had also played the inaugural game in the [[Salt Palace (arena)|Salt Palace arena]] when it opened on October 10, 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Golden Eagles Jazz up Delta Center|last=Rosetta|first=Dick|newspaper=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|location=Salt Lake City|page=C1|date=October 17, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Eagles, which were purchased by Miller in 1990, lost nearly a million dollars annually and would not long play in the Delta Center.

The first basketball game played in the arena was a Jazz pre-season loss against [[Patrick Ewing]] and the [[New York Knicks]], 101–95.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Knicks Win to Spoil Jazz Debut|last=Luhm|first=Steve|newspaper=[[Salt Lake Tribune]]location=Salt Lake City|page=D1|date=October 24, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Image:Delta-center.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Exterior view of arena under original name, 2005]]
The 1993–95 [[Western Athletic Conference]] men's basketball tournaments were held at the facility, as was the [[1993 NBA All-Star Game]]. The Delta Center also hosted games of the [[1997 NBA Finals|1997]] and [[1998 NBA Finals]] between the Jazz and [[Chicago Bulls]].

In addition to the Utah Jazz and Blaze, the arena has also been the home of the [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]]'s [[Utah Starzz]] from 1997 to 2002, the [[Salt Lake Golden Eagles]] from 1991 to 1994, and the [[Utah Grizzlies (1995–2005)|Utah Grizzlies]] from 1995 to 1997, both of the [[International Hockey League (1945–2001)|International Hockey League]]. Notably, on June 8, 1996, the Delta Center hosted what was then the largest crowd in the history of American minor league hockey: 17,381 fans attended Game 4 of the 1996 [[Turner Cup]] Finals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1996-06-09/sports/9606090196_1_orlando-solar-solar-bears-utah-grizzlies|title=Orlando Ousted in OT|last=Turner|first=Tim|newspaper=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|date=June 9, 1996|accessdate=March 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Grizzlies won 3–2 in overtime, completing a four-game sweep of the [[Orlando Solar Bears (IHL)|Orlando Solar Bears]] and earning the IHL championship in their first season in Utah.

===Upgrades and renovations===
{{Update|date=February 2018}}
[[File:Energy solutions arena.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The exterior of the arena (then known as EnergySolutions Arena) in 2009.]]
In 2002, the arena upgraded its super system with ribbon display technology and auxiliary scoreboards from [[Brookings, South Dakota]]-based [[Daktronics]].

During the summer of 2010, the Arena was remodeled, which included the installation of Bear's Backyard, a playground for kids, a new dining area for adults and over 500 television screens. On June 17, 2013 the Utah Jazz announced that the arena would receive a new scoreboard and ribbon display technology, including display screens in each corner of the arena. The new scoreboard and display systems were installed during the 2013 NBA off-season.

On September 21, 2016, the Utah Jazz announced plans to renovate and upgrade Vivint Smart Home Arena. The majority of the construction related to the building's renovation, which is estimated to cost US$125 million, will begin at the conclusion of the [[2016–17 Utah Jazz season|2016–17 Utah Jazz basketball season]], with anticipated completion of the renovation by fall 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=$125 Million Arena Transformation to Begin|url=http://www.nba.com/jazz/125-million-arena-transformation-begin|publisher=Utah Jazz|date=September 21, 2016|accessdate=September 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaming===
[[File:EnergySolution Arena logo.svg|thumb|150px|left|EnergySolutions Arena logo, 2006–2015]]
During the [[2002 Winter Olympics|Salt Lake City Olympics]], due to [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] policies about having corporate sponsorship for venues, the arena was referred to as the '''Salt Lake Ice Center''' during events.

After [[Delta Air Lines]] declined to renew their 15-year naming rights contract, which expired on September 30, 2006, the stadium's owner, Larry H. Miller, opted to sell naming rights to [[EnergySolutions]], a [[Low-level waste|low-level nuclear waste]] disposal company headquartered in Salt Lake City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.sltrib.com/story.php?ref=/ci_4694165|title=Delta Center's Out, EnergySolutions Arena Is In|newspaper=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|date=November 20, 2006|accessdate=March 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/650208779/EnergySolutions-Arena-Its-a-mouthful.html|title=Marjorie Cortez: EnergySolutions Arena?

Two stickers were placed on the court, covering up the arena's old name with the new one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://torontosun.ca/Sports/Basketball/2006/11/21/pf-2432303.html |title=Utah Understands Hoffa |last=Koreen|first=Mike|newspaper=[[The Toronto Sun]]|date=November 21, 2006|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The temporary logos were replaced with official logos on the court sometime in December. EnergySolutions naming rights were set to expire in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leg.wa.gov/JointCommittees/LFOKC/Documents/2008-10-01BasketBall.pdf |title=Sports Facilities Reports |website=leg.wa.gov |publisher=[[Washington State Legislature]] |page=20 |format=PDF |accessdate=March 19, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616162733/http://www.leg.wa.gov/JointCommittees/LFOKC/Documents/2008-10-01BasketBall.pdf |archive-date=June 16, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial fan reactions to the new name were predominantly negative. Early nicknames for the arena included "the Dump", a jab at EnergySolutions' radioactive and hazardous waste disposal operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archive.sltrib.com/story.php?ref=/ci_4698067 |title=Arena's new name a winner, Miller says |last=Gorrell |first=Mike |newspaper=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]] |date=November 21, 2006 |accessdate=March 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other suggestions included the Glow Dome, Radium Stadium, Isotope, Chernobowl, Jazzmat, Big Bang, Tox Box, Power House, Hot Spot, Plutonium Palace, Fallout Shelter, Melta Center, and Energy Pollutions Arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/29/sports/basketball/29stadium.html?_r=0|title=In Utah, the Half-Life of Arena Naming Rights|last=Sandomir|first=Richard|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 29, 2006|accessdate=March 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 26, 2015, the naming rights were acquired by the locally based home security and automation provider [[Vivint]] in a 10-year contract.&lt;ref name="VivintJazzArena"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VivintJazzBusinessWire"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20151026005788/en/LHM-Sports-Entertainment-Introduces-Vivint-Smart-Home |title=LHM Sports &amp; Entertainment Introduces Vivint Smart Home Arena for the Utah Jazz: Vivint signs multi-year naming rights agreement for downtown facility |website=businesswire.com |publisher=[[Berkshire Hathaway]] |location=San Francisco |date=October 26, 2015 |accessdate=March 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Stockton and Karl Malone statues===
Outside the arena are statues of two players widely regarded as the greatest in the history of the Jazz, as well as among the greatest players in NBA history. The [[John Stockton]] statue was unveiled on March 30, 2005. The [[Karl Malone]] statue was unveiled on March 23, 2006. The Jazz played games on each of those nights but lost both games.

On April 15, 2010, over a year after the death of Jazz owner Larry H. Miller, the Jazz [[basketball court]] was named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jazz honor late owner Miller, rename home floor|url=http://www.nba.com/2010/news/04/15/jazz.miller.ap/index.html|agency=Associated Press|publisher=National Basketball Association|website=NBA.com|date=April 15, 2010|accessdate=March 19, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504125408/http://www.nba.com/2010/news/04/15/jazz.miller.ap/index.html|archive-date=May 4, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the announcement of the arena's new name on October 26, 2015, the new official name of the court is '''Larry H. Miller Court at Vivint Smart Home Arena'''.

==Notable events==
===Other sports===
The facility played host to the 1999 [[U.S. Figure Skating Championships]]. The arena was also home to the [[Figure skating at the 2002 Winter Olympics|figure skating]] and [[Short track speed skating at the 2002 Winter Olympics|short track speed skating]] competitions of the [[2002 Winter Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2002/2002v1.pdf|title=Official Report of the XIX Olympic Winter Games |publisher=Salt Lake Olympic Committee|volume=1|pages=93–4|format=PDF|isbn=0-9717961-0-6|accessdate=March 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final of the [[Short track speed skating at the 2002 Winter Olympics – Men's 1000 metres|Men's 1000 metres]] Short track speed skating event at the 2002 Winter Olympics, veteran Australian [[Steven Bradbury]] became the most unlikely winner in Winter Olympic history when he won the race after [[Apolo Anton Ohno]] (USA), [[Mathieu Turcotte]] (Canada), [[Ahn Hyun-Soo]] ([[South Korea]]), and [[Li Jiajun]] (China) all fell on the final turn and left Bradbury, who was running last and about {{convert|15|m|ft}} behind the pack, to come through and claim Australia's first ever Winter Olympics Gold Medal.

Vivint Smart Home Arena was the site of the West regional semifinals ("[[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament#Regional semifinals and finals|Sweet Sixteen]]") and championship ("[[Elite Eight]]") in the [[2010 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]]. The venue also hosted first and second-round games in the [[2013 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|2013]] and [[2017 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|2017]] editions of the tournament, and it will do so again in [[2019 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|2019]].

===Concerts===
In addition to sports, the arena was intended to host large music concerts. On October 24, 1991, [[Oingo Boingo]] became the first headlining act to rock the Delta Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Elfman Makes Delta Center Roll in Rock-Concert Debut|last=Butters|first=Lori|newspaper=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|location=Salt Lake City|page=D1|date=October 24, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In film===
The movie ''[[Legally Blonde 2: Red, White &amp; Blonde]]'' was partially filmed in the arena.

==Tornado==
The arena's roof was damaged by severe winds associated with the [[Salt Lake City Tornado]] of August 11, 1999, costing $3,757,000 (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|3757000|1999|fmt=C}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}) to repair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Real Twister: 1 Year Later: A Whirlwind of Memories; Salt Lake City Recalls Devastating Tornado that Changed Lives Forever|last=Woolf|first=Jim|newspaper=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|location=Salt Lake City|page=|date=August 10, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and recognitions==
Vivint Smart Home Arena is well known for being one of the hardest places to play for visiting teams in the NBA. According to an NBA Players Poll taken by ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' on February 11, 2008, the Vivint Arena is considered "the most intimidating arena in the NBA" with 20% of the vote made up of 240 current NBA players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Si Players Nba Poll |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1109385/index.htm |work=[[Sports Illustrated]] |date=February 11, 2008 |accessdate=March 19, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130326192626/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1109385/index.htm|archivedate=March 26, 2013|via=[[Internet Archive|web.archive.org]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many commentators referred to the arena as the "Decibel Center", a play on the name "Delta Center". During Game 5 of the [[1997 NBA Finals]], a decibel meter installed at floor level had readings of over 110 decibels, close to the noise generated by a jet takeoff. Also, during the [[1997 NBA Finals]], [[NBA on NBC|NBC's]] [[Hannah Storm]] called the then-named Delta Center "one of the loudest places in sports".&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|id=1vWHDxG0YLk|title=NBA on NBC Intro - 1997...}} {{dead link|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
