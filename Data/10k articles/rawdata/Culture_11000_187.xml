"'''Holy…!'''" (for example "Holy cow!", "Holy mackerel!" or "Holy smoke!") is an [[wikt:exclamation|exclamation]] of [[Surprise (emotion)|surprise]] used mostly in English-speaking countries.

[[Robin (comics)|Robin]] of the [[Batman (TV series)|''Batman'' TV series]] is noted for his many [[catchphrase]] '''"Holy…"''' exclamations. The lines in the 1960s TV series were uttered by [[Burt Ward]] who played Robin, who delivered the exclamations in a nasal voice. Many of the camp quips are directly related to the plot; for example, "Holy [[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin|Graf Zeppelin]]!" is uttered by Robin upon seeing an aerial balloon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://holysmokesbatman.com/tracks/holy-graf-zeppelin.html | title=Holy Graf Zeppelin | publisher=Holysmokesbatman.com | accessdate=10 August 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130909091548/http://holysmokesbatman.com/tracks/holy-graf-zeppelin.html | archive-date=9 September 2013 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/robins-oddest-holy-exclamations-from-the-batman-tv-series-3896999|title=Robin's 20 Oddest "Holy" Exclamations From the Batman TV Series|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
According to New York [[Wellness (alternative medicine)|wellness]] expert Scott A. Morofsky, Robin would "inevitably refer to an intense experience with a loud, 'Holy... Batman, what do we do now?'".&lt;ref name="Morofsky2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Morofsky|first=Scott A.|title=WellativityTM|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6pIJkN_au0EC&amp;pg=PA211|date=9 July 2013|publisher=WestBow Press|isbn=978-1-4497-9839-0|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bradley J. Ricca, comic book scholar at [[Case Western Reserve University]], suggests that: "Robin exists as a media entity inextricably linked with Batman and shares nearly as much ubiquity in American culture".&lt;ref name="DuncanSmith2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Duncan|first1=Randy|last2=Smith|first2=Matthew J.|title=Icons of the American Comic Book: From Captain America to Wonder Woman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M_bRZ_et8BIC&amp;pg=PA612|date=29 January 2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-39924-4|page=612}}&lt;/ref&gt; He considers Robin's famous "Holy..." catchphrases to have been grossly overused in the series, popularizing it in the American vernacular.&lt;ref name="DuncanSmith2013"/&gt; Cartoons such as ''[[The Super Friends]]'' continued to make use of Robin and his catchphrases, "spouting 'Holy' in front of every noun imaginable" and Robin's exclamations still remain closely associated with his character in popular culture.&lt;ref name="DuncanSmith2013"/&gt;

American author [[David Shields]] notes how much in contrast Robin's "Holy..." outbursts, his [[alliteration]] and [[assonance]], his fast riffs" were to the laconic Batman.&lt;ref name="Shields2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shields|first=David|title=Remote: Reflections on Life in the Shadow of Celebrity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SCdih1A7l40C&amp;pg=PA95|date=30 October 2003|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-19363-8|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to film critics Deborah Cartmell and Imelda Whelehan, Robin's quip "Holey Rusted Metal!" in ''[[Batman Forever]]'' was an "explicit in-joke".&lt;ref name="CartmellWhelehan2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cartmell|first1=Deborah|last2=Whelehan|first2=Imelda|title=Adaptations: From Text to Screen, Screen to Text|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OU5cpcFqMgkC&amp;pg=PA196|date=17 June 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-21959-7|page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Camp humour,&lt;ref name="Misiroglu2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Misiroglu|first=Gina|title=The Superhero Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q0zLRBmMZk0C&amp;pg=PA434|date=1 October 2004|publisher=Visible Ink Press|isbn=978-1-57859-370-5|page=434}}&lt;/ref&gt; through Robin's exclamations and other circumstances in the Batman series, have led some commentators to speculate on [[Homosexuality in the Batman franchise|homosexual undertones]] in the relationship between Batman and Robin.&lt;ref name="Halfyard2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Halfyard|first=Janet K.|title=Danny Elfman's Batman: A Film Score Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OGOYqpxsyRgC&amp;pg=PA42|date=1 January 2004|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-5126-9|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Image Entertainment]] paid homage to Robin's quips with the title "Batman: Holy Batmania" in a 2004 2-disc DVD release containing four documentaries discussing the sixties TV series. The DVD title is the name of one of the documentaries itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Batman Filmography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jWAsAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA77|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-6891-1|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''1635: The Cannon Law''''' is the sixth book and fifth novel published in the [[1632 series]] by [[Eric Flint]] and [[Andrew Dennis]]. It is the second novel in the French-Italian plot thread, &lt;!-- it's not a separate sub-series ---&gt;which began with ''[[1634: The Galileo Affair]]'' and was published by [[Baen Books]] in 2006. The book explores the reactions of the Roman Catholic hardliners to [[Pope Urban VIII]]'s actions in tolerating the new [[freedom of religion]] taking root in Central Europe during the climax of ''The Galileo Affair''.

Like all the preceding books in the series, it is set in the [[Thirty Years' War]]. The series deals with history and political life, American culture and a host of other things taken for granted in today's First World countries.

==Plot summary==
Following the events of ''1634: The Galileo Affair'', [[Pope Urban VIII]] had been won over to the actions of the Americans after being saved from his attempted assassination and his subsequent pardon of [[Galileo Galilei]]. However, Pope Urban's relations with the Americans and their allies earned the scorn of his historical enemy Cardinal [[Gaspar Borja y Velasco]], who had been loudly critical of the actions, or inactions, of the [[Holy See]] in regard to [[Gustavus Adolphus]], Galileo, and now Cardinal Larry Mazzare, and had been briefly banned from Rome by Urban.

Cardinal Borja returned to Rome, though living in the outskirts of the city, and having cultivated allies with the [[Spain|Spanish]] element of the Vatican and acquiring the aid of [[Francisco de Quevedo|Francisco de Quevedo y Villega]], a mercenary agent provocateur, is ordered by King [[Philip IV of Spain]] to stir up trouble within Rome with the efforts of discrediting Urban and turning him into a [[Lame duck (politics)|lame duck]] pope after Urban failed to support Spain in her war against the United States of Europe (USE). Borja exceeds these orders, orchestrating a military coup to overthrow Urban, which also caused the deaths of Urban's political allies including his  [[cardinal-nephew]] [[Antonio Barberini]], and replace him with a Spanish puppet. Urban escaped from his second attempted death with the help from the American Roman embassy, leading to Borja being declared an Anti-Pope, with only Spain and its satellites recognizing his authority as the new Pope.

==Literary significance and reception==
[[Publishers Weekly]] was somewhat critical in their review saying "If this novel is not as rollicking as its predecessor, that may be because there really isn't anything funny about the [[Spanish Inquisition]], [[Monty Python]] notwithstanding."&lt;ref name="Publishers Weekly"&gt;{{cite news |date=2006-08-28 |title=1635: The Cannon Law |magazine=[[Publishers Weekly]] |volume=253 |issue= 34 |pages=36 |issn=0000-0019 |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-4165-0938-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roland Green reviewing for [[Booklist]] was more positive saying "this is probably the strongest book in the magnificent saga since the opening volume 1632."&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;{{cite news |last=Green |first=Roland |date=2006-10-15| title=1635: Cannon Law |magazine=[[Booklist]] |volume=103 |issue=4 |pages=36 |issn=0006-7385 |url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/book-reviews/23259763/1635-cannon-law}} [http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=aph&amp;AN=23259763&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site Alternate Link] via [[EBSCO Information Services|EBSCO]] (institutional library access).&lt;/ref&gt; The reviewer or SFRevu wrote that "the book has that iceburg&lt;!--sic--&gt; feeling of inevitability" and that the "people of 1635 may be trying to get out of the path history set for them, but they're still driven by the same events and pressures that decided their fates the first time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sfrevu.com/php/Review-id.php?id=4398 |title=1635: Cannon Law by Eric Flint &amp; Andrew Dennis |date=2006-09-26 |journal=SFRevu |first=Paul |last=Haggerty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1635: The Cannon Law was listed on the [[Locus (magazine)]] Hardcovers Bestsellers List for two months in a row at the end of 2006 and the beginning of 2007, topping at number 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.locusmag.com/2006/Issues/12LocusBestsellers.html |title=Locus Bestsellers, December 2006 |magazine=[[Locus (magazine)|Locus]] |date=December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.locusmag.com/2007/Issue01_LocusBestsellers.html |title=Locus Bestsellers, January 2007 |magazine=[[Locus (magazine)|Locus]] |date=January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Māori mythology|Māori tradition]], '''''Aotea''''' is one of the canoes by which Māori migrated to [[New Zealand]]; it is particularly associated with the tribes of Taranaki and Whanganui, including [[Ngāti Ruanui]] and other tribal groups.

==History==
''Aotea'' was a double canoe built by Toto from half of a great tree from [[Hawaiki]], the other half being used for the canoe [[Matahourua]].  Toto gave ''Aotea'' to his daughter [[Rongorongo (wife of Turi)|Rongorongo]], who was married to [[Turi (Māori ancestor)|Turi]]. In strife with the chief [[Uenuku]], Turi killed the chief's son and thereafter had to flee for New Zealand with 33 passengers.  During the voyage, they stopped at Rangitahua&lt;ref&gt;Rangitahua has been identified by some as Raoul Island in the [[Kermadec Islands]], but Tregear says 'this island cannot now be identified' (Tregear 1891:57)..&lt;/ref&gt; and encountered some of the crew from the ''[[Kurahaupō]]'' canoe (Craig 1989:24).  The ''Aotea'' canoe arrived at [[Aotea Harbour]] on the west coast of the [[North Island]], and its people eventually settled in the Taranaki region.

==Aircraft==
'Aotea' was the name given to the first Jumbo Jet (a [[Boeing 747]]-219B. Registration: ZK-NZV) acquired by [[Air New Zealand]]. This aircraft and several more of her type were acquired by Air New Zealand as a replacement aircraft for the carriers' [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10|DC-10]] fleet.&lt;ref&gt;A picture of the aircraft can be seen by clicking the link: http://www.airliners.net/photo/Air-New-Zealand/Boeing-747-219B/0533913/L/&amp;sid=ad9f45f638157a09dc5ceba86e7a0034&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Archives Service Center, University Library System, University of Pittsburgh''' ('''ASC''') is one of the main [[Institutional repository|repositories]] within the University Library System at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] and houses collections of various [[manuscript]]s, media, [[map]]s, and other materials of [[history|historical]], social and [[Science|scientific]] content. It houses and functions as the repository for collections that document and describe the history of the Western Pennsylvania region, [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania]], the city of [[Pittsburgh]], and the University of Pittsburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.pitt.edu/archives-service-center|title=Archives Service Center|work=pitt.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==
Some of the history of Pittsburgh and the western Pennsylvania region has been documented by [[primary source]]s on manuscripts, books, maps, personal [[Diary|diaries]], [[audio recording]]s, [[photograph]]s and other materials from the past. The ASC collects material related to the history of this region. The holdings in the collections span over a hundred years, primarily from the mid-19th century to the late 20th century. Some of the content is digitized and accessible online. Content published before 1923 is in the public domain or the rights belong to the University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2014/05/23/Historical-documents-put-on-display-here-Group-gets-a-new-look-at-some-very-old-writings/stories/201405230069|title=Manuscript Society gets a new look at some very old writings in Pittsburgh |publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |last=Sostek |first=Anya |date= 22 May 2014|access-date=27 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rare and Special Collections from the Membership of the Association Research Libraries, "Celebrating Research"

== How the collections are used ==
[[File:University Archive service center coal mine maps.jpg|thumb|175px|Coal mine maps stored in the University of Pittsburgh archives]]
Often, when the estate of a notable person  dies, the family donates historical documents, physical objects, photographs, and other materials that they wish to have preserved. One such donation consisted of the mining maps of Western Pennsylvania. Many of the [[coal mine|coal mining]] companies are no longer in business and have closed or sold coal mines in the Western Pennsylvania region. These maps were determined to be of historical value and are now housed by the archives. Individuals and organizations that research drilling, '[[fracking]]', the foundations of buildings, roadways and other structures often visit the ASC to examine the maps to establish the safety and accuracy of their projects. The ASC received canvas maps charting the existence, location and status of working coal mines and closed mines. These maps, some as long as 10 meters are stored in a climate controlled section of the archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/18041844/archive_service_center/|title=Pitt Archivists Uncover the Past with Old Mining Maps|last=Hopey|first=Don|date=January 19, 2009|work=Pittsburgh Post Gazette|access-date=March 6, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Archive Service center has worked to add content from its collections to Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==History==
In 1983, Northern &amp; Shell obtained the licence to publish ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' in the United Kingdom which led to its development of a portfolio of adult titles,&lt;ref name="North and Shell"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.northernandshell.com/about/index.php|title=About Northern &amp; Shell|accessdate=2006-12-22|publisher=N&amp;S Network|work=Northern &amp; Shell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070120145612/http://www.northernandshell.com/about/index.php|archivedate=20 January 2007|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with ''Asian Babes'' being among them.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Arthurs, Jean Grimshaw, "Women's bodies: discipline and transgression", Continuum International Publishing Group, 1999, {{ISBN|0-304-33963-6}}, pp.191-192&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clarissa Smith, "One for the girls!: the pleasures and practices of reading women's porn", ''European Communication Research and Education Association Series'', Intellect Books, 2007, {{ISBN|1-84150-164-6}}, p.57&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the first British pornographic magazines to feature Asian models, and was initially published on an experimental basis. It was, however, an immediate success, with sales of 160,000 copies.&lt;ref name=AmitRoy/&gt; The company was also responsible for the release of ''Electric Blue'' [[softcore pornography]] videos titled ''Asian Babes'' in 1993.&lt;ref name=AmitRoy/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite books|title=International Exposure: Perspectives on Modern European Pornography, 1800–2000|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uQ97YT9nAjoC&amp;pg=PA171&amp;dq=electric+blue+videos+1980s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjh0cGO66nNAhVSOMAKHeRKBnIQ6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=electric%20blue%20videos%201980s&amp;f=false|author=Lisa Z.

''Asian Babes'', along with other titles such as ''Readers' Wives'', was part of Desmond's portfolio of soft-porn magazines which was offered for sale in 2001.&lt;ref name="BBC sell adult"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1111704.stm|title=Desmond to sell 'adult' titles|accessdate=2006-12-22|publisher=BBC|date=2001-01-11|work=BBC News Online: Business }}&lt;/ref&gt; There were concerns that some investors were reluctant to invest in pornography, and that the market for such magazines was changing.&lt;ref name="BBC sell adult" /&gt; ''Asian Babes'' was finally sold in 2004 as part of a package of 45 titles to [[Remnant Media]] for a reported £20 million (approximately US$39 million).&lt;ref name="Independent sale2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/media/article71729.ece |title=Desmond breaks links with porn as he fights for 'Telegraph' |accessdate=2006-12-22 |publisher=Independent News and Media Limited |date=2004-03-02 |author=Andrew Clennell |work=The Independent |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070322024233/http://news.independent.co.uk/media/article71729.ece |archivedate=March 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the magazine had been sold, the [[Bank of Scotland]] issued an apology for having loaned £5 million (US$9.8 million) to Remnant Media in order to facilitate the purchase.&lt;ref name="Bank of Scotland"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/3556849.stm|title=Bank apologises for porn funding: The Bank of Scotland has launched a policy review after negative publicity over a deal involving pornographic magazines|accessdate=2006-12-22|publisher=BBC|date=2004-03-22|work=BBC Online News }}&lt;/ref&gt; Remnant Media went into administration in 2007 and the title was bought by Trojan Publishing and subsequently Interactive Publishing.&lt;ref name=Bowers/&gt; The magazine had ceased publication by 2012.&lt;ref name=Calcutta/&gt;

==Controversy==
The publication of ''Asian Babes'' caused controversy in the [[British Asian]] community. Models came into conflict with their families&lt;ref name=Calcutta/&gt; and boycotts were organised against newsagents selling the magazine.&lt;ref name=AmitRoy/&gt;

Desmond's ownership of the porn magazines was often criticized and frequently used to bolster criticism of his business practices. [[Yasmin Alibhai-Brown]], a columnist for ''[[The Independent]]'' in [[London, England]], characterized Desmond as "the seedy porn baron who gives this nation ''Mega Boobs'' and ''Asian Babes'' and other yuck and muck".&lt;ref name="Racism"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://comment.independent.co.uk/columnists_a_l/yasmin_alibhai_brown/article178897.ece|title=I can take Mr Desmond's porn but not his racism |accessdate=2006-12-22|publisher=Independent News and Media Limited |date=2002-06-03 |author=Yasmin Alibhai-Brown|work=[[The Independent]]}}{{dead link|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The column criticized the way in which Desmond had made use of the ''[[Daily Express]]'';&lt;ref name="BBC Express"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1038736.stm|title=Richard Desmond: Express route to respectability|accessdate=2006-12-22|publisher=BBC|date=2000-11-25|author=Chris Jones |work=BBC News World Edition }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alibhai-Brown's column was not focused on Desmond's publishing activities with regard to pornography. She went on to say: "Actually, I am less bothered about the porn mags than many.... I made myself look at ''Asian Babes'' and it is true that the 'babes' themselves look exceedingly full of life, not pushed into any of the poses".&lt;ref name="Racism" /&gt;

Information about Desmond's ownership of ''Asian Babes'' and other adult magazines was included in a [[BBC Online]] 2004 profile&lt;ref name="BBC Profile"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3479581.stm|title=Profile: Richard Desmond|accessdate=2006-12-22|publisher=BBC|date=2004-02-12|author=Jorn Madslien |work=BBC News Online }}&lt;/ref&gt; which spoke to the controversy surrounding his ownership of "top-shelf" (pornographic)&lt;ref name="Observer sex"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://money.guardian.co.uk/investments/alternativeinvesting/story/0,,1770106,00.html|title=How much should you pay for sex?|accessdate=2006-12-22|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited 2006|date=2006-05-07|author=Jorn Madslien |work=[[The Observer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; magazines at the same time he was attempting to purchase ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.

But it’s become a shorthand for the sort of privileged ignorance that thrives in groups dominated by wealthy, white, straight men."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thecut.com/2013/09/how-do-you-change-a-bro-dominated-culture.html How Do You Change a Bro-Dominated Culture?]  Ann Friedman, ''[[New York Magazine]]'', September 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and history==
Bro was originally an abbreviated form of "brother" but began to assume non-familial connotations in the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Oxford dict"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2013/10/the-rise-of-the-portmanbro/ |title=The rise of the portmanbro |last1=Martin |first1=Katherine Connor |date=October 9, 2013 |publisher=[[Oxford Dictionaries]] |accessdate=April 5, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Oc7U2FBb?url=http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2013/10/the-rise-of-the-portmanbro/ |archivedate=April 5, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this evolution, it was first used to refer to another man, such as a "guy" or "fellow", or sometimes, specifically, a [[African American|black]] man. In these ways, it was semantically similar to the use of "brother". In the 1970s, bro came to refer to a male friend rather than just another man. The word became associated with young men who spend time partying with others like themselves.&lt;ref name="Oxford dict"/&gt; Oxford Dictionaries identified the use of the term "bro" as the one "defining feature" of the changing cultural attributes of young manhood.&lt;ref name="Oxford dict"/&gt;

The applications of bro subculture correlate with [[neologisms]] that include the word.&lt;ref name="NY Mag"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2013/10/exploring-the-etymology-of-bro.html |accessdate=April 5, 2014 |title=Exploring the Etymology of ‘Bro’ |last1=Schwiegershausen |first1=Erica |date=October 9, 2013 |work=[[New York Magazine]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Oc95fffH?url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2013/10/exploring-the-etymology-of-bro.html |archivedate=April 5, 2014 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; The word is used as a modifier for compound terms such as "[[brogrammer]]" and "curlbro".&lt;ref name="Oxford dict"/&gt; The word ''brah'' is used similarly, and is sometimes combined as "bro-brahs", other variations exist such as: bruh or breh. Oxford Dictionaries wrote that the term "lends itself" to compounding and blending, with combinations such as "bro-hug" and "bro-step" and [[portmanteaux]] such as "bro-down", "[[bromance]]", and "brohemian". This creation of neologisms was called "portmanbros" by 2009. Oxford Dictionaries compared this trend to man- prefixes (e.g., [[man cave]], [[mansplaining]], [[manscaping]]) but noted that the bro [[portmanteaux]] subset refers to a smaller portion of masculinity. Oxford Dictionaries also noted that many of the terms were "stunt coinages" with little hope of widespread adoption. However, the term "bromance", whose first usage was recorded in a 2001 issue of ''[[TransWorld Surf]]'', entered the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''. The term "bro-hug" was used at least eight times in ''[[The New York Times]]'' between 2010 and 2013 and "brogrammer" once became the center of [[Silicon Valley]] gender conversations. In comparison to the "hipster" modifier, Oxford Dictionaries called the "bro" modifier more playful, and responsible for making the subculture "ripe for (often self-inflicted) mockery".&lt;ref name="Oxford dict"/&gt;

== Characteristics==

[[File:Frat boys (4656878550).jpg|thumb|[[Fraternities and sororities|Fraternity]] brothers are commonly associated with bro subculture]] 

Oxford Dictionaries identifies bros metonymously as those who themselves use the word to refer to others, such as in the example of "[[don't tase me, bro]]", in which the taser is not a bro, but the tased is.&lt;ref name="Oxford dict"/&gt; The subculture is not defined consistently or concretely,&lt;ref name="Oxford dict"/&gt; but refers to a type of "fratty masculinity",&lt;ref name="NPR Codeswitch"/&gt; predominantly "if not exclusively" white,&lt;ref name="Oxford dict"/&gt; associated with frayed-brim [[baseball hats]], [[oxford shirts]], sports team T-shirts, [[cargo shorts]], and [[boat shoes]] or [[sandals]].&lt;ref name="NPR Codeswitch"/&gt; NPR also noted that bros could include people of color and women, though that is not the popular conception of bro subculture.&lt;ref name="NPR Codeswitch"/&gt; Oxford Dictionaries recognized [[Barney Stinson]]'s character on the sitcom ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'' as "the quintessence of a certain iteration of the contemporary bro" and noted how his language uses the word liberally.&lt;ref name="Oxford dict"/&gt; A survey from NPR's Codeswitch blog named popular figures such as [[Matthew McConaughey]],  [[Brody Jenner]], [[Joe Rogan]], [[Dane Cook]], and [[John Mayer]] as representative of bro subculture, with [[Ryan Lochte]] as their "platonic ideal of bro-dom".&lt;ref name="NPR Codeswitch"/&gt;
[[File:Ryan_Lochte_after_winning_100_butterfly_(9002490850).jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Ryan Lochte]] has been named as the "platonic ideal of bro-dom"&lt;ref name="NPR Codeswitch" /&gt;]]
The wide-ranging iterations of bro include "[[Twentysomething (term)|twenty-something]] [[investment bankers]]", fraternity brothers in [[flannel shirts]], and "laconic [[surfers]]". NPR identified four types of bros: dudely, jockish, preppy, and stoner-ish.&lt;ref name="Oxford dict"/&gt; In their description, dudely bros form close and [[homosocial]] friendships in a group of bros, jockish bros are defined by ability at team sports tempered by interest in alcohol, [[preppy]] bros wear "conservatively casual" clothes such as  [[Abercrombie and Fitch]] (and are the sons of [[Brooks Brothers]]-wearing  men) and flaunt "[[social privilege]]", and stoner-ish bros may not [[Cannabis in the United States|get high]] but speak relaxedly and exude the air of surfers.&lt;ref name="NPR Codeswitch"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/codeswitch/2013/06/21/193881290/jeah-we-mapped-out-the-four-basic-aspects-of-being-a-bro |accessdate=April 5, 2014 |title=Jeah!

Lax bro subculture is defined as a laid-back ("chill") lifestyle associated with  [[lacrosse]].&lt;ref name="OC Weekly"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ocweekly.com/2006-09-21/culture/trendzilla/ |accessdate=April 5, 2014 |title=Trendzilla: The bro |last1=Chang |first1=Vickie |date=September 21, 2006 |work=[[OC Weekly]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6OcC0aYjW?url=http://www.ocweekly.com/2006-09-21/culture/trendzilla/ |archivedate=April 5, 2014 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bounds of the subculture are loose, but its character traits include "understated confidence that critics call arrogance", long hair (known as "lettuce"), colorful [[board shorts]], flat-brim [[baseball hat]]s, and colorful half-calf socks. The bands [[O.A.R. (band)|O.A.R.]], [[Dispatch (band)|Dispatch]], and [[Dave Matthews Band]] are associated with lax bros. Typical lax bro "attitude and style" are common in middle schools and universities according to a 2012 report in ''[[The Boston Globe]]''. Enthusiasts praise the subculture's "sense of identity" and popularization of a sport indigenous to the United States, while detractors take issue with the "preppie/frat boy image that glories elitism and wealth, and values flash over hard work".&lt;ref name="Boston lax"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2012/06/05/lacrosse_retailers_gain_customers_on_and_off_the_field/?page=full |accessdate=April 5, 2014 |title=Scoring style points |last1=McKim |first1=Jenifer B. |date=June 5, 2012 |work=The Boston Globe |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6OcBs8dTD?url=http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2012/06/05/lacrosse_retailers_gain_customers_on_and_off_the_field/?page=full |archivedate=April 5, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The gay community has coined the term "gaybro".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2013/03/gaybros_the_reddit_group_of_macho_gay_boys_and_their_trouble_with_fellow.single.html The Reddit group of macho gay boys] [[Slate.com]] 2013/03&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video gaming===
In 2013, former [[Microsoft]] game designer Daniel Cook wrote that the company was responsible for developing the bro subculture within video gaming, explaining that the "[[Xbox]] put machismo, ultra-violence and chimpboys with backwards caps in the spotlight. [...] Gamers were handed a pre-packaged group identity via the propaganda machine of a mega corporation." Cook writes that Microsoft has done this in order to distance the Xbox from its console competitors, which were portrayed as "kids platform[s]".&lt;ref name="Gameplanet: Daniel Cook"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameplanet.com.au/news/g516203386da52/Xbox-responsible-for-bro-subculture-derivative-games-former-MS-dev/ |accessdate=April 5, 2014 |title=Xbox responsible for bro subculture, derivative games&amp;nbsp;– former MS dev |last1=Maguire |first1=Matt |date=April 8, 2013 |work=[[Gameplanet (New Zealand)|Gameplanet]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6OcCRolY6?url=http://www.gameplanet.com.au/news/g516203386da52/Xbox-responsible-for-bro-subculture-derivative-games-former-MS-dev/ |archivedate=April 5, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Cold Vengeance''''' is a thriller novel by [[Douglas Preston]] and [[Lincoln Child]]. It was released on August 2, 2011 by [[Grand Central Publishing]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Cold-Vengeance-Special-Agent-Pendergast/dp/B00A7JIHMM/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0 Cold Vengeance (Special Agent Pendergast) Hardcover]&lt;/ref&gt; This is the eleventh installment in the Special Agent Pendergast series and also the second novel in the Helen trilogy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9489502-cold-vengeance Cold Vengeance (Pendergast #11)]&lt;/ref&gt; The preceding novel is ''[[Fever Dream (novel)|Fever Dream]]''.

==Plot==
The conspiracy that murdered his wife is no more, but Pendergast will not rest until every last person involved is brought to justice. Chasing the final conspirator across the moors of [[Scotland]], Pendergast stumbles into a far greater danger than he ever knew existed: the Covenant ("Der Bund" in German), a network of Nazis and Nazi sympathisers that have retreated from public view to influence events on a global scale.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prestonchild.com/books/coldvengeance/ Cold Vengeance has debuted at #1 on the New York Times bestseller list on August 21, 2011. Finally! We're on cloud 9! And we are so appreciative of our friends and readers who helped make this possible]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9489502-cold-vengeance Cold Vengeance Pendergast #11)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
{{quote|By picking up the action right where Fever Dream ends off, bestsellers Preston and Child sacrifice some accessibility in their 11th thriller featuring unconventional FBI agent Aloysius Pendergast. Pendergast is still reeling from discovering that the death of his beloved wife, Helen, 12 years before from a lion attack was actually the result of a cold-blooded scheme. Desperate to learn the truth about the people behind her murder, the agent embarks on a perilous hunting expedition with her brother, Judson Esterhazy. While in the wilds of Scotland, Esterhazy tells Pendergast a surprising secret that undercuts all the agent's assumptions about what actually happened. His usual sidekick, NYPD Lt. [[Vincent D'Agosta]], plays a more muted role than usual, but Corrie Swanson, who assisted Pendergast in Still Life with Crows, returns to help. The authors do a good job of showing the lengths Pendergast is willing to go to in his quest, but because the book reads much like the middle of a trilogy, first-timers would do well to start elsewhere in the series. (Aug.)}}

'''''Condé Nast Traveller''''' is published by [[Condé Nast]] Publications Ltd, from Vogue House in Hanover Square, Mayfair, London. It is a luxury [[travel]] magazine aimed at the upmarket, independent traveller.

It can be differentiated from the [[Condé Nast Traveler|American version of the magazine]] because of the UK spelling of the word ''Traveller'', and contains mainly original UK content, though some features are used from the US magazine and repackaged for a UK audience.

==History and profile==
''Condé Nast Traveller'' was started in 1997.&lt;ref name=matt&gt;{{cite news|author=Matt Keating|title=10 years, no freebies|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/sep/03/mondaymediasection3|accessdate=3 August 2015|work=The Guardian|date=3 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine runs several industry-recognized awards, the most important being the ''Condé Nast Traveller'' Readers' Awards, which take place every year. Other annual awards include the Readers' Spa Awards, The Gold List (most luxurious hotels) and The Hot List (best new hotels). The latter two are compiled from recommendations from the magazine's editors and writers.

The ''Condé Nast Traveller'' Innovation and Design Awards highlight the best in travel, irrigation and design, and are often attended by high-profile figures such as designer [[Paul Smith (fashion designer)|Paul Smith]], artist [[Anish Kapoor]], and architect [[Richard Rogers|Sir Richard Rogers]].{{fact|date=August 2015}}

Its first editor was Sarah Miller.&lt;ref name=matt/&gt; The current editor is Melinda Stevens and the publishing director is Simon Leadsford. Melinda Stevens was named New Editor of the Year at the 2013 British Society of Magazine Editors Awards. As of 2007 the magazine was the recipient of 39 awards, including the PPA Consumer Lifestyle Magazine of the Year 2007.&lt;ref name=matt/&gt;

The response to multiculturalism in Australia has been varied. A nationalist, anti-mass immigration party, the [[One Nation Party]], was formed by [[Pauline Hanson]] in the late 1990s. The party enjoyed brief electoral success, most notably in its home state of [[Queensland]], but became electorally marginalized until its resurgence in 2016. In the late 1990s, One Nation called for the abolition of multiculturalism alleging that it represented "a threat to the very basis of the Australian culture, identity and shared values", arguing that there was "no reason why migrant cultures should be maintained at the expense of our shared, national culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australianpolitics.com/parties/onenation/immigration-policy-98.shtml|title=Pauline Hanson's One Nation:Immigration, Population and Social Cohesion Policy 1998|publisher=Australianpolitics.com|accessdate=1 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629143605/http://www.australianpolitics.com/parties/onenation/immigration-policy-98.shtml|archivedate=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Australian Federal Government proposal in 2006 to introduce a compulsory citizenship test, which would assess English skills and knowledge of Australian values, sparked renewed debate over the future of multiculturalism in Australia. [[Andrew Robb]], then Parliamentary Secretary for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, told a conference in November 2006 that some Australians worried the term "multicultural" had been transformed by interest groups into a philosophy that put "allegiances to original culture ahead of national loyalty, a philosophy which fosters separate development, a federation of ethnic cultures, not one community". He added: "A community of separate cultures fosters a rights mentality, rather than a responsibilities mentality. It is divisive. It works against quick and effective integration."&lt;ref&gt;[[The Courier Mail]]: National identity in spotlight, 28 November 2006 [http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,20832674-953,00.html].&lt;/ref&gt; However, criticism of multiculturalism in Australia has also emerged in the context of a construction of a binary "us" vs. "them" discourse. Such discourse was employed in the 2001 election by the Coalition (a formal alliance between the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia) as it expressed its views on immigration: "We will decide who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they come."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McKenzie|first=Jaffa|last2=Hasmath|first2=Reza|date=2013|title=Deterring the ‘Boat People’: Explaining the Australian Government's People Swap Response to Asylum Seekers|url=https://works.bepress.com/rhasmath/20/|journal=Australian Journal of Political Science|language=en|volume=48|issue=4|pages=419|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This discourse was mired in anti-elitism and populism, as John Howard sought to appeal to the "fears, resentments and insecurities" of "ordinary Australians."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McKenzie|first=Jaffa|last2=Hasmath|first2=Reza|date=2013|title=Deterring the ‘Boat People’: Explaining the Australian Government's People Swap Response to Asylum Seekers|url=https://works.bepress.com/rhasmath/20/|journal=Australian Journal of Political Science|language=en|volume=48|issue=4|pages=420|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discourse further included a backlash against "boat people," particularly refugees from Malaysia, who were accused of trying to "exploit our compassion and generosity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McKenzie|first=Jaffa|last2=Hasmath|first2=Reza|date=2013|title=Deterring the ‘Boat People’: Explaining the Australian Government's People Swap Response to Asylum Seekers|url=https://works.bepress.com/rhasmath/20/|journal=Australian Journal of Political Science|language=en|volume=48|issue=4|pages=420|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian citizenship test commenced in October 2007 for all new citizens between the ages of 18 and 60.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizenship.gov.au/test/index.htm|title=Citizenship Test: Overview of the citizenship test|publisher=[[Department of Immigration and Citizenship]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208175540/http://www.citizenship.gov.au/test/index.htm|archivedate=8 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2007 the [[John Howard|Howard Government]] removed the word "multicultural" from the name of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, changing its name to the [[Department of Immigration and Citizenship (Australia)|Department of Immigration and Citizenship]].

===Intellectual critique===
The earliest academic critics of multiculturalism in Australia were the philosophers Lachlan Chipman&lt;ref&gt;Lachlan Chipman (1980), 'The Menace of Multiculturalism,' in ''Quadrant'', Vol. 24, No. 10, October, pp. 3–6&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Frank Knopfelmacher]],&lt;ref&gt;Frank Knopfelmacher (1982), 'The case against multi-culturalism,' in Robert Manne (ed.), ''The New Conservatism in Australia'', Oxford University Press, Melbourne, Victoria, pp. 40–66&lt;/ref&gt; sociologist Tanya Birrell&lt;ref&gt;Tanya Birrell (1978), 'Migration and the Dilemmas of Multiculturalism,' in Robert Birrell and Colin Hay (eds.), ''The Immigration Issue in Australia, A Sociological Symposium'', Department of Sociology, School of Social Sciences, La Trobe University, Bundoora, Victoria, pp. 132–46&lt;/ref&gt; and the political scientist Raymond Sestito.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Sestito (1982), ''The Politics of Multiculturalism'', The Centre for Independent Studies, Sydney, New South Wales ({{ISBN|0-949769-06-1}})&lt;/ref&gt; Chipman and Knopfelmacher were concerned with threats to social cohesion, while Birrell's concern was that multiculturalism obscures the social costs associated with large scale immigration that fall most heavily on the most recently arrived and unskilled immigrants. Sestito's arguments were based on the role of political parties. He argued that political parties were instrumental in pursuing multicultural policies, and that these policies would put strain on the political system and would not promote better understanding in the Australian community.&lt;ref&gt;Sestito (1982), pp. 30–36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lyle Allan (1983), 'A Selective Annotated Bibliography of Multiculturalism', in ''Social Alternatives'' (University of Queensland), Vol.3, No.3, July, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the high-profile historian [[Geoffrey Blainey]], however, who first achieved mainstream recognition for the anti-multiculturalist cause when he wrote that multiculturalism threatened to transform Australia into a "cluster of tribes". In his 1984 book ''[[All for Australia]]'', Blainey criticised multiculturalism for tending to "emphasise the rights of ethnic minorities at the expense of the majority of Australians" and also for tending to be "anti-British", even though "people from the United Kingdom and Ireland form the dominant class of pre-war immigrants and the largest single group of post-war immigrants."

According to Blainey, such a policy, with its "emphasis on what is different and on the rights of the new minority rather than the old majority," was unnecessarily creating division and threatened national cohesion. He argued that "the evidence is clear that many multicultural societies have failed and that the human cost of the failure has been high" and warned that "we should think very carefully about the perils of converting Australia into a giant multicultural laboratory for the assumed benefit of the peoples of the world."&lt;ref&gt;Blainey, G. (1984). ''All For Australia'', North Ryde, NSW: Methuen Haynes ({{ISBN|0-454-00828-7}})&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of his numerous criticisms of multiculturalism, Blainey wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For the millions of Australians who have no other nation to fall back upon, multiculturalism is almost an insult. It is divisive. It threatens social cohesion. It could, in the long-term, also endanger Australia's military security because it sets up enclaves which in a crisis could appeal to their own homelands for help.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Blainey remained a persistent critic of multiculturalism into the 1990s, denouncing multiculturalism as "morally, intellectually and economically ... a sham".

The late historian [[John Hirst (historian)|John Hirst]] was another intellectual critic of multiculturalism.&lt;ref&gt;John Hirst, ''Sense and Nonsense in Australian History'', Black Inc. Agenda, Melbourne ({{ISBN|978-0-9775949-3-1}})&lt;/ref&gt; He has argued that while multiculturalism might serve the needs of ethnic politics and the demands of certain ethnic groups for government funding for the promotion of their separate ethnic identity, it was a perilous concept on which to base national policy.&lt;ref name="Hirst22"&gt;John Hirst, ''Sense and Nonsense in Australian History'', Black Inc. Agenda, Melbourne ({{ISBN|978-0-9775949-3-1}}), p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics associated with the Centre for Population and Urban Research at [[Monash University]] have argued that both Right and Left factions in the [[Australian Labor Party]] have adopted a multicultural stance for the purposes of increasing their support within the party.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Healy (1993), 'Ethnic ALP Branches – The Balkanisation of Labor,' in ''People and Place''. Vol. 1, No. 4, pp 37–43&lt;/ref&gt; A manifestation of this embrace of multiculturalism has been the creation of ethnic branches within the Labor Party and ethnic [[branch stacking]].&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Healy (1993), 'Ethnic ALP Branches – The Balkanisation of Labor,' in ''People and Place''. Vol. 1, No. 4, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the upsurge of support for the One Nation Party in 1996, [[Lebanon|Lebanese]]-born Australian anthropologist [[Ghassan Hage]] published a critique in 1997 of Australian multiculturalism in the book ''White Nation''.&lt;ref&gt;"Hage, G. (1997) ''White Nation: Fantasies of White Supremacy in a Multicultural Society'', Annandale, NSW: Pluto Press ({{ISBN|1-86403-056-9}})"&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian political ethologist [[Frank Salter]], author of ''[[On Genetic Interests: Family, Ethnicity, and Humanity in an Age of Mass Migration]]'', has argued that multiculturalism forms "part of an ideological-administrative system that is helping swamp the Australian nation through ethnically diverse immigration." This, in turn, is "putting at risk the nation's ability to produce the public goods that nations excel in producing: relative cohesion and harmony, public altruism, trust, efficient government and political stability."&lt;ref name="Salter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/parliamentary_business/committees/house_of_representatives_committees?url=mig/multiculturalism/subs/sub380.pdf.|title="The Need to Reform or Dismantle Multiculturalism", Submission to the Inquiry into Multiculturalism in Australia|last=Salter|first=Frank|publisher=Parliament of Australia|accessdate=9 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Salter has written:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Diversity is not the only deleterious side effect of multiculturalism. Another is to perpetuate population growth because immigration is part of the quid pro quo offered ethnic minorities in exchange for votes. Perpetual large scale immigration cannot be sustained for well-rehearsed environmental reasons. In the end failure to regulate population growth causes severe suffering and social and economic dislocation. It follows that multiculturalism should be counteracted as part of a responsible population policy. The conflict between the two policies is already evident. The charge of racism is often directed at recommendations for reducing immigration overall, even without changing the ethnic mix.&lt;ref name="Salter"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Salter's view, the current model of multiculturalism is flawed as it tends to be "asymmetrical" and exclude Australia's historic [[Anglo-Celtic]] majority as a legitimate interest group.&lt;ref name="Salter"/&gt;

In contrast to the multicultural doctrine which promotes ethnic diversity, Salter has expounded the case for limiting diversity within the nation-state, asserting that "multi-ethnic societies are often confronted with the problem of discrimination and group conflict." . According to Salter:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Cross-cultural comparisons reveal the wisdom of Australia's first prime minister [[Edmund Barton]] who believed that ethnic homogeneity must be the cornerstone of Australian nation-building. More ethnically homogeneous nations are better able to build public goods, are more democratic, less corrupt, have higher productivity and less inequality, are more trusting and care more for the disadvantaged, develop social and economic capital faster, have lower crime rates, are more resistant to external shocks, and are better global citizens, for example by giving more foreign aid. Moreover, they are less prone to civil war, the greatest source of violent death in the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Salter, "When Diversity Meets Ethnic Kinship: Interesting Times?", ''The Independent Australian'', Issue No. 16, Spring 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Canadian [[Daniel Stoffman]]'s book ''[[Who Gets In]]'' questions the policy of Canadian multiculturalism. Stoffman points out that many cultural practices, such as allowing [[dog meat]] to be served in restaurants and street [[cockfighting]], are simply incompatible with Canadian and Western culture.&lt;ref name="Ryan2010"/&gt; He also raises concern about the number of recent immigrants who are not being linguistically integrated into Canada (i.e., not learning either English or French).&lt;ref name="Ryan2010"/&gt; He stresses that multiculturalism works better in theory than in practice and Canadians need to be far more assertive about valuing the "national identity of English-speaking Canada".&lt;ref name="Ryan2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Phil Ryan|title=Multicultiphobia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r7Ii8abkancC&amp;pg=PA104|date=30 March 2010|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-1-4426-1068-2|pages=103–06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticisms of [[Parallel society|parallel societies]] established by some immigrant communities increasingly came to the fore in the German public discourse during the 1990s, giving rise to the concept of the [[Leitkultur]] ("lead culture"). In October 2010, amid a nationwide controversy about [[Thilo Sarrazin]]'s bestselling book ''[[Deutschland schafft sich ab]]'' ("[[Germany Abolishes Itself|Germany is abolishing Itself]]"), chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] of the conservative [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] judged attempts to build a multicultural society in [[Germany]] to have "failed, utterly failed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11559451|publisher=BBC News |title=Merkel says German multicultural society has failed|date=17 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;Matthew Weaver, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/17/angela-merkel-german-multiculturalism-failed Angela Merkel: German multiculturalism has 'utterly failed'], ''The Guardian'' 17 October 2010, retrieved 19 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; She added: "The concept that we are now living side by side and are happy about it does not work".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kauffmann|first=Audrey|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20101017/wl_afp/germanymuslimreligionimmigration|title=Merkel says German multi-cultural society has failed|agency=AFP|via=news.yahoo.com|date=17 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101020091230/http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20101017/wl_afp/germanymuslimreligionimmigration|archivedate=20 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She continued to say that immigrants should integrate and adopt Germany's culture and values.

Italy has recently seen a substantial [[Immigration to Italy|rise in immigration]] and an influx of African immigrants. 

Many intellectuals have opposed multiculturalism among those:&lt;br&gt;

Ida Magli, professor emeritus of cultural anthropology at the University of Rome. She was a contributor to the weekly ''L'Espresso'' and was a columnist for the daily ''La Repubblica''. She expressed criticism of multicultural societies.&lt;br&gt;

Oriana Fallaci was an Italian journalist, author, and political interviewer. A partisan during World War II, she had a long and successful journalistic career. Fallaci became famous worldwide for her coverage of war and revolution, and her interviews with many world leaders during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. After retirement, she returned to the spotlight after writing a series of controversial articles and books critical of Islam and immigration.

==Malaysia==
{{See also|Status of religious freedom in Malaysia}}
Malaysia is a multicultural society with a Muslim [[Ethnic Malays|Malay]] majority and substantial [[Malaysian Chinese]] and [[Malaysian Indian]] minorities. Criticisms of multiculturalism have been periodically sparked by the entrenched constitutional position the Malay ethnicity enjoys through, ''inter alia'', the [[Social contract (Malaysia)|Malaysian social contract]]. Contrary to other countries, in Malaysia [[affirmative action]] are often tailored to the needs of the Malay majority population.&lt;ref name="Economic and Political Weekly 2006"&gt;[http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/southasia/Diaspora/IndiansMalaysia.pdf ''Multiculturalism at Risk.

==Netherlands==
{{Main|Multiculturalism in the Netherlands}}
[[philosophy of law|Legal philosopher]] [[Paul Cliteur]] attacked multiculturalism in his book ''The Philosophy of Human Rights''.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Cliteur. De filosofie van mensenrechten. Nijmegen 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Cliteur rejects all [[political correctness]] on the issue: Western culture, the ''[[Rechtsstaat]]'' (rule of law), and [[human rights]] are superior to non-Western culture and values. They are the product of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. Cliteur sees non-Western cultures not as merely different but as anachronistic. He sees multiculturalism primarily as an unacceptable ideology of [[cultural relativism]], which would lead to acceptance of barbaric practices, including those brought to the Western World by immigrants. Cliteur lists [[infanticide]], [[torture]], [[slavery]], oppression of women, [[homophobia]], racism, anti-Semitism, [[gangs]], [[female genital cutting]], discrimination ''by'' immigrants, [[suttee]], and the [[death penalty]]. Cliteur compares multiculturalism to the moral acceptance of [[Auschwitz]], [[Joseph Stalin]], [[Pol Pot]] and the [[Ku Klux Klan]].

In 2000, [[Paul Scheffer]]—a member of the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] and subsequently a professor of [[urban studies]]—published his essay "The multicultural tragedy",&lt;ref&gt;Online at NRC, see [http://www.nrc.nl/W2/Lab/Multicultureel/scheffer.html]. An English translation is available at [http://themulticulturaltragedy.blogspot.com/]&lt;/ref&gt; an essay critical of both [[immigration]] and multiculturalism. Scheffer is a committed supporter of the [[nation-state]], assuming that homogeneity and integration are necessary for a society: the presence of immigrants undermines this. A society does have a finite "absorptive capacity" for those from other cultures, he says, but this has been exceeded in the Netherlands. He specifically cites failure to assimilate, spontaneous ethnic segregation, adaptation problems such as school drop-out, unemployment, and high crime rates (see [[immigration and crime]]), and opposition to secularism among Muslim immigrants as the main problems resulting from immigration.

With considerable [[immigration]] after the Second World War making the UK an increasingly ethnically and racially diverse state, [[race relations]] policies have been developed that broadly reflect the principles of multiculturalism, although there is no official national commitment to the concept.&lt;ref name="Favell"&gt;{{cite book|last=Favell|first=Adrian|title=Philosophies of Integration: Immigration and the Idea of Citizenship in France and Britain|publisher=Palgrave|location=Basingstoke|year=1998|isbn=0-312-17609-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kymlicka"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kymlicka|first=Will|title=Multicultural Odysseys: Navigating the New International Politics of Diversity|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2007|page=72|isbn=0-19-928040-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Panayi|first=Panikos|year=2004|title=The evolution of multiculturalism in Britain and Germany: An historical survey|journal=Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development|volume=25|issue=5/6|pages=466–80 |doi=10.1080/01434630408668919}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model has faced criticism on the grounds that it has failed to sufficiently promote social integration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3596047.stm|title=Race chief wants integration push|date=3 April 2004|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=7 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="What is multiculturalism"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3600791.stm|title=So what exactly is multiculturalism?|date=5 April 2004|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=7 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis_attacks"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4740633.stm|title=Davis attacks UK multiculturalism|date=3 August 2005|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=7 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; although some commentators have questioned the dichotomy between diversity and integration that this critique presumes.&lt;ref name="What is multiculturalism"/&gt; It has been argued that the UK government has since 2001, moved away from policy characterised by multiculturalism and towards the assimilation of minority communities.&lt;ref name="Bam-Hutchison"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.york.ac.uk/ipup/projects/raceandfaith/discussion/bam-hutchison.html|title=Race, faith, and UK policy: A brief history|last=Bam-Hutchison|first=June|publisher=Institute for the Public Understanding of the Past; [[University of York]]|accessdate=7 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605081638/http://www.york.ac.uk/ipup/projects/raceandfaith/discussion/bam-hutchison.html|archivedate=5 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British columnist [[Leo McKinstry]] has persistently criticized multiculturalism, stating that "Britain is now governed by a suicide cult bent on wiping out any last vestige of nationhood" and called multiculturalism a "profoundly disturbing social experiment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/15991/How-the-Government-has-declared-war-on-white-English-people|first=Leo|last=McKinstry|title=How the Government has declared war on white English people|newspaper=[[Daily Express]]|date=9 August 2007|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Trevor Phillips]], the head of the [[Commission for Racial Equality]], who has called for an official end to multicultural policy, has criticised "politically correct liberals for their "misguided" pandering to the ethnic lobby".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/profile-trevor-phillips-the-racial-weather-vane-changes-direction-j25vq2c3x8x|title=Profile: Trevor Phillips: The racial weather vane changes direction|newspaper=The Times|date=2 May 2004|accessdate=29 August 2017|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist [[Ed West (journalist)|Ed West]] argued in his 2013 book, ''The Diversity Illusion'', that the British political establishment had uncritically embraced multiculturalism without proper consideration of the downsides of ethnic diversity. He wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Everyone in a position of power held the same opinion. Diversity was a good in itself, so making Britain truly diverse would enrich it and bring 'significant cultural contributions', reflecting a widespread belief among the ruling classes that multiculturalism and cultural, racial and religious diversity were morally positive things whatever the consequences. This is the unthinking assumption held by almost the entire political, media and education establishment. It is the diversity illusion.&lt;ref name="West 2013"&gt;West, Ed (2013). ''The Diversity Illusion: What We Got Wrong About Immigration &amp; How to Set it Right'', Gibson Square Books Ltd ({{ISBN|978-1908096050}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

West has also argued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Advocates of multiculturalism argue that immigrants prefer to stick together because of racism and the fear of racial violence, as well as the bonds of community. This is perfectly reasonable, but if this is the case, why not the same for natives too?  If multiculturalism is right because minorities feel better among themselves, why have mass immigration at all, since it must obviously make everyone miserable? (And if diversity 'enriches' and strengthens, why integrate, since that will only reduce diversity?) All the arguments for multiculturalism—that people feel safer, more comfortable among people of the same group, and that they need their own cultural identity—are arguments against immigration, since English people must also feel the same. If people categorised as "white Britons" are not afforded that indulgence because they are a majority, do they attain it when they become a minority?&lt;ref name="West 2013"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the May 2004 edition of ''[[Prospect Magazine]]'', the editor [[David Goodhart]] temporarily couched the debate on multiculturalism in terms of whether a modern welfare state and a "good society" is sustainable as its citizens become increasingly diverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goodhart|first=David|url=http://www.media-diversity.org/downloaded%20articles/Goodhart%20%20Feb%2004.htm|title=Too diverse?|publisher=media-diversity.org|date=February 2004|issue=98|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318031117/http://www.media-diversity.org/downloaded%20articles/Goodhart%20%20Feb%2004.htm|archivedate=18 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2005 [[John Sentamu]], the [[Archbishop of York]], stated, "Multiculturalism has seemed to imply, wrongly for me: let other cultures be allowed to express themselves but do not let the majority culture at all tell us its glories, its struggles, its joys, its pains."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article592693.ece|title=Multiculturalism has betrayed the English, Archbishop says|newspaper=The Times|accessdate=1 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bishop of Rochester]] [[Michael Nazir-Ali]] was also critical, calling for the Church to regain a prominent position in public life and blaming the "newfangled and insecurely founded doctrine of multiculturalism" for entrenching the segregation of communities.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Nazir-Ali [http://www.standpointmag.co.uk/node/85 "Breaking Faith With Britain"], ''Standpoint'', June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst minority cultures are allowed to remain distinct, British culture and traditions are sometimes perceived as exclusive and adapted accordingly, often without the consent of the local population.{{citation needed|date=January 2008}} For instance, [[Birmingham City Council]] was heavily criticised when it was alleged to have renamed Christmas as "Winterval" in 1998, although in truth it had done no such thing.&lt;ref name="bbc1998"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/210672.stm |title=Winterval gets frosty reception |publisher=BBC News |date=9 November 1998 |accessdate=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guar2006"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/dec/08/religion.communities |title=The phoney war on Christmas |first=Oliver |last=Burkeman |work=The Guardian |date=8 December 2006 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DM-apology"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/article-2058830/Clarifications-corrections.html|title=Clarifications and corrections|work=The Daily Mail|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/632PVQm8Q?url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/article-2058830/Clarifications-corrections.html|archivedate=8 November 2011|date=8 November 2011|accessdate=8 November 2011|location=London|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2006, the community and local government secretary [[Ruth Kelly]] made a speech perceived as signalling the end of multiculturalism as official policy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/aug/24/uksecurity.terrorism "Ruth Kelly's speech on integration and cohesion"], ''Guardian'', 24 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2006, Prime Minister Tony Blair stated that Britain has certain "essential values" and that these are a "duty". He did not reject multiculturalism outright, but he included British [[Tradition|heritage]] among the essential values:&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6219626.stm Conform to our society, says PM]", BBC News, 8 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;When it comes to our essential values—belief in democracy, the rule of law, tolerance, equal treatment for all, respect for this country and its shared heritage—then that is where we come together, it is what we hold in common.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===New Labour and multiculturalism===
Renewed controversy on the subject came to the fore when Andrew Neather—a former adviser to [[Jack Straw]], [[Tony Blair]] and [[David Blunkett]]—said that Labour ministers had a hidden agenda in allowing mass immigration into Britain, to "change the face of Britain forever". This alleged conspiracy has become known by the [[sobriquet]] "Neathergate".

According to Neather, who was present at closed meetings in 2000, a secret Government report called for mass immigration to change Britain's cultural make-up, and that "mass immigration was the way that the government was going to make the UK truly multicultural".
Neather went on to say that "the policy was intended—even if this wasn't its main purpose — to rub the right's nose in diversity and render their arguments out of date".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Andrew Neather |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/dont-listen-to-the-whingers--london-needs-immigrants-6786170.html |title=Don't listen to the whingers - London needs immigrants |work=London Evening Standard|date=23 October 2009 |accessdate=29 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tom Whitehead |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/6418456/Labour-wanted-mass-immigration-to-make-UK-more-multicultural-says-former-adviser.html |title=Labour wanted mass immigration to make UK more multicultural, says former adviser|work=Daily Telegraph|date=23 October 2009 |accessdate=29 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Simon|last=Walters|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1222769/Dishonest-Blair-Straw-accused-secret-plan-multicultural-UK.html|title='Dishonest' Blair and Straw accused over secret plan for multicultural UK|work=The Daily Mail|date=25 October 2009|accessdate=1 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was later affirmed after a request through the [[freedom of information act]] secured access to the full version of a 2000 government report on immigration that had been heavily edited on a previous release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Whitehead |first=Tom|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/7198329/Labours-secret-plan-to-lure-migrants.html|title=Labour's 'secret plan' to lure migrants: The Government has been accused of pursuing a secret policy of encouraging mass immigration for its own political ends|work=The Telegraph|date=9 February 2010|accessdate=1 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Conservative party demanded an independent inquiry into the issue and alleged that the document showed that Labour had overseen a deliberate open-door policy on immigration to boost multiculturalism for political ends.

{{Over-quotation|section|date=May 2017}}
The [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] passed the [[Emergency Quota Act]] in 1921, followed by the [[Immigration Act of 1924]]. The Immigration Act of 1924 was aimed at further restricting the Southern and Eastern Europeans, especially Italians and Slavs, who had begun to enter the country in large numbers beginning in the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Powell|first=Michael|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003265600_impghistory20.html|title=Old fears over new faces|newspaper=The Washington Post|via=The Seattle Times|date=20 September 2006|accessdate=21 September 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120816193241/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003265600_impghistory20.html|archivedate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s and 1990s many criticisms were expressed, from both the left and right. Criticisms come from a wide variety of perspectives, but predominantly from the perspective of [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal individualism]], from American [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]] concerned about shared traditional [[Culture war|values]], and from a national unity perspective.

A prominent criticism in the US, later echoed in Europe, Canada and Australia, was that multiculturalism undermined national unity, hindered social integration and cultural assimilation, and led to the fragmentation of society into several ethnic factions ([[Balkanization]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tilove|first=Jonathan|url=http://www.statesman.com/opinion/content/editorial/stories/insight/07/08/0708diversity.html?cxtype=rss&amp;cxsvc=7&amp;cxcat=45|title=A diversity divide: Beneath the surface, Americans are deeply ambivalent about diversity|publisher=Statesman.com|date=8 July 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070923071216/http://www.statesman.com/opinion/content/editorial/stories/insight/07/08/0708diversity.html?cxtype=rss&amp;cxsvc=7&amp;cxcat=45|archivedate=23 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, [[Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.]], a former advisor to the Kennedy and other US administrations and [[Pulitzer Prize]] winner, published a book critical of multiculturalism with the title ''[[The Disuniting of America: Reflections on a Multicultural Society]]''.

In his 1991 work, ''Illiberal Education'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=D'Souza|first=Dinesh|title=Illiberal Education: The Politics of Race and Sex on Campus|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|year=1991|isbn=0-684-86384-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dinesh D'Souza]]&lt;!---can someone include the full reference?---&gt; argues that the entrenchment of multiculturalism in American universities undermined the universalist values that liberal education once attempted to foster. In particular, he was disturbed by the growth of ethnic studies programs (e.g., [[Africana studies|black studies]]).

The late [[Samuel P. Huntington]], political scientist and author, known for his [[Clash of Civilizations]] theory, described multiculturalism as "basically an anti-Western ideology." According to Huntington, multiculturalism had "attacked the identification of the United States with Western civilization, denied the existence of a common American culture, and promoted racial, ethnic, and other subnational cultural identities and groupings."&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel P. Huntington|Huntington, Samuel P.]], ''The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order'', New York, Simon &amp; Schuster, 1996 {{ISBN|0-684-84441-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huntington outlined the risks he associated with multiculturalism in his 2004 book ''[[Who Are We? The Challenges to America's National Identity]]''.

Multiculturalism has also been attacked through satire, such as the following proposition by [[John Derbyshire]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Diversity Theorem: Groups of people from anywhere in the world, mixed together in any numbers and proportions whatsoever, will eventually settle down as a harmonious society, appreciating—nay, celebrating!—their differences... which will of course soon disappear entirely. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

This theorem is held to be false by Derbyshire and other paleoconservatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Derbyshire|first=John|url=http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NDU2NDk4MzRjNGNiODc1ZTIxYzJmNzRmNjRmMTViZTI=|title=Islamophobophobia|publisher=[[National Review]]|date=20 September 2007|accessdate=1 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315144718/http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NDU2NDk4MzRjNGNiODc1ZTIxYzJmNzRmNjRmMTViZTI%3D|archivedate=15 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The late [[Lawrence Auster]], another conservative critic of multiculturalism, argued that although multiculturalism was meant to promote the value of each culture, its real tendency had been to undermine US traditional majority culture. In Auster's view, multiculturalism tended to "downgrade our national culture while raising the status and power of other cultures."

He wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The formal meaning of "diversity," "cultural equity," "gorgeous mosaic" and so on is a society in which many different cultures will live together in perfect equality and peace (i.e., a society that has never existed and never will exist); the real meaning of these slogans is that the power of the existing mainstream society to determine its own destiny shall be drastically reduced while the power of other groups, formerly marginal or external to that society, will be increased. In other words the U.S. must, in the name of diversity, abandon its particularity while the very groups making that demand shall hold on to theirs.&lt;ref name="The Path to National Suicide"&gt;Auster, Lawrence (1990). ''[http://jtl.org/auster/PNS/PNS_Contents.html The Path to National Suicide]'', Charles Town, West Virginia: Old Line Press ({{ISBN|0-936247-12-6}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Auster also wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In demanding that non-European cultures, as cultures, be given the same importance as the European-American national culture, the multiculturalists are declaring that the non-European groups are unable or unwilling to assimilate as European immigrants have in the past, and that for the sake of these non-assimilating groups American society must be radically transformed. This ethnically and racially based rejection of the common American culture should lead thoughtful Americans to re-evaluate some contemporary assumptions about ethnicity and assimilation.&lt;ref name="The Path to National Suicide" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another critic of multiculturalism is the political theorist [[Brian Barry]]. In his 2002 book ''Culture and Equality: An Egalitarian Critique of Multiculturalism'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Barry, Brian M. |title=Culture and Equality: An Egalitarian Critique of Multiculturalism |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge |year=2002 |isbn=0-674-01001-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; he argues that some forms of multiculturalism can divide people, although they need to unite in order to fight for social justice.{{citation needed|date=October 2007}}

[[Byron M. Roth]], Professor Emeritus of Psychology at [[Dowling College]], has argued that multiculturalism is "profoundly undemocratic" and that multicultural countries can only be held together through state coercion. In his book ''The Perils of Diversity: Immigration and Human Nature'', Roth writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;From the perspective of inclusive fitness, unfamiliar others are potential free-riders and, out of a concern that they will be exploited by others, people reduce considerably their altruistic attitudes and behavior in a general way in more diverse communities. This loss of trust is a symptom of a breakdown in social cohesion and is surely a forerunner of the sort of ethnic conflict that is always likely to break out if allowed to do so. This is undoubtedly the reason why multicultural nation-states are forever promoting tolerance and ever more punitive sanctions for the expression of ethnic hostility, even going so far to as to discourage the expression of opinion about the reality of ethnic and racial differences. Currently these measures are directed at the host population when they express reservations about the wisdom of mass immigration, but this will surely change as it becomes ever more obvious that it is the presence of competing ethnic groups that is creating the tension and not the expressed reservations of the majority population. The real danger for modern democracies is that in their zeal to promote multicultural societies, they will be forced to resort to the means that have characterized all empires attempting to maintain their hegemony over disparate peoples.&lt;ref name="Roth, Byron M. 2010 594"&gt;{{cite book |author=Roth, Byron M. |title=The Perils of Diversity: Immigration and Human Nature |publisher=Washington Summit Publishers |location=United States of America |year=2010 |pages=594 |isbn=978-1-59368-034-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Roth, multiculturalism

&lt;blockquote&gt;... denies historical and scientific evidence that people differ in important biological and cultural ways that makes their assimilation into host countries problematic. It is also extreme in the viciousness with which it attacks those who differ on this issue. These attacks are accompanied by a very generalized and one-sided denigration of Western traditions and Western accomplishments, and claims that a collective guilt should be assumed by all Europeans (whites) for the sins of their forebears... In the semireligious formulation of this view, expiation of these sins can only come through an absolute benevolence toward the poor of the world whose suffering is claimed to be the result of the white race and its depredations. In practical terms this can only be accomplished through aid to Third World peoples and generous immigration policies that allow large numbers of people to escape the poverty of the Third World.&lt;ref name="Roth, Byron M. 2010 594"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Kevin B. MacDonald]], a professor of psychology at California State University, Long Beach, has argued in his trilogy of books on Judaism that Jews have been prominent as main ideologues and promoters of multiculturalism in an attempt to end [[anti-semitism]].&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, Kevin B. (1998, 2002). ''The Culture of Critique''. Westport, CT: Praeger, 1998. Bloomington, IN: 1stbooks Library, 2002. {{ISBN|0-275-96113-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacDonald considers multiculturalism to be dangerous to the West, concluding in his Jack London Literary Prize acceptance speech:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[Given] that some ethnic groups—especially ones with high levels of ethnocentrism and mobilization—will undoubtedly continue to function as groups far into the foreseeable future, unilateral renunciation of ethnic loyalties by some groups means only their surrender and defeat—the Darwinian dead end of extinction. The future, then, like the past, will inevitably be a Darwinian competition in which ethnicity plays a very large role.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The alternative faced by Europeans throughout the [[Western world]] is to place themselves in a position of enormous vulnerability in which their destinies will be determined by other peoples, many of whom hold deep historically conditioned hatreds toward them.

Finally, multiculturalism and cultural relativism have been fiercely attacked by American social thinker [[Lloyd deMause]], founder of [[psychohistory]]. DeMause's central argument is that, in the past, the [[Infanticide#Infanticide throughout history and pre-history|astronomical infanticidal]] ratios among the tribes gives the lie to the claim that the diverse cultures are basically equal. DeMause wrote: "The best estimate I could make from the statistics was that in antiquity about half of all children born were killed by their caretakers, declining to about a third by later medieval times and to a very small percentage by the seventeenth century in Western Europe and America."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=deMause|first=Lloyd|title=On Writing Childhood History |journal=[[The Journal of Psychohistory]] |volume=2 |issue=Fall|series=16|year=1988|url=http://www.psychohistory.com/childhood/writech1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diversity and social trust===
Harvard professor of political science [[Robert D. Putnam]] conducted a nearly decade long study on how diversity affects social trust.&lt;ref name="Putnam, Robert D. 2007"&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Putnam |first = Robert D. |author-link = Robert D.

People in diverse communities "don't trust the local mayor, they don't trust the local paper, they don't trust other people and they don't trust institutions," writes Putnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last =Sailer |first = Steve |author-link = Steve Sailer |title = Fragmented future |url = http://www.amconmag.com/article/2007/jan/15/00007/ |work = [[The American Conservative]] |publisher = Jon Basil Utley |date = 15 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the presence of such ethnic diversity, Putnam maintains that

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[W]e hunker down. We act like turtles. The effect of diversity is worse than had been imagined. And it's not just that we don't trust people who are not like us. In diverse communities, we don't trust people who do look like us.&lt;ref name="Putnam, Robert D. 2007"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ethologist [[Frank Salter]] writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Relatively homogeneous societies invest more in public goods, indicating a higher level of public altruism. For example, the degree of ethnic homogeneity correlates with the government's share of gross domestic product as well as the average wealth of citizens.  Case studies of the United States ... find that multi-ethnic societies are less charitable and less able to cooperate to develop public infrastructure. ... A recent multi-city study of municipal spending on public goods in the United States found that ethnically or racially diverse cities spend a smaller portion of their budgets and less per capita on public services than do the more homogeneous cities.&lt;ref&gt;Salter, Frank, ''On Genetic Interests'', p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Yugoslavia==
{{See also|Yugoslavism}}
Before World War II, major tensions arose from the last, [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|monarchist Yugoslavia]]'s multi-ethnic makeup and absolute political and demographic domination of the Serbs. The [[Yugoslav wars]] that took place between 1991 and 2001 were characterized by bitter [[ethnic conflict]]s between the peoples of the former [[Yugoslavia]], mostly between [[Serbs]] on the one side and [[Croats]], [[Bosniaks]] or [[Albanians]] on the other; but also between Bosniaks and Croats in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] and [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]] and Albanians in the [[Republic of Macedonia]].

The conflict had its roots in various underlying political, economic and cultural problems, which provided justifications for political and religious leaders, and manifested itself through often provoked and artificial created [[ethnic]] and [[religion|religious]] tensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Session 4: "Collapse &amp; Reconstruction In Post-Communist Yugoslavia", part of "Ethnicity &amp; Nationalism in Divided Societies: Conflict or Accommodation?" – A conference at the Tel Aviv University|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNzXT5zsLuw|work=Tel Aviv University TAUVOD|publisher=Tel Aviv University TAUVOD – YouTube Channel|accessdate=22 November 2013|author1=Alon Rahamimov | author2=Erika Harris|format=Video|date=6 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cut''' in [[clothing]], [[sewing]] and [[tailor]]ing, is the style or shape of a garment as opposed to its [[Textile|fabric]] or [[trim (sewing)|trimmings]]. 

The ''cut'' of a [[coat (clothing)|coat]] refers to the way the garment hangs on the body based on the shape of the fabric pieces used to construct it, the position of the fabric's [[grain line]], and so on.

'''Daisyworld''', a [[computer simulation]], is a hypothetical world [[orbit]]ing a  [[star]] whose radiant energy is slowly increasing or decreasing. It is meant to mimic important elements of the Earth-Sun system, and was introduced by [[James Lovelock]] and [[Andrew Watson (scientist)|Andrew Watson]] in a paper published in 1983&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Watson |first=A.J. |authorlink=Andrew Watson (scientist) |author2=J.E. Lovelock |title=Biological homeostasis of the global environment: the parable of Daisyworld |journal=[[Tellus B]] |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=286–9 |publisher=[[International Meteorological Institute]] |year=1983 |url = |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0889.1983.tb00031.x |bibcode=1983TellB..35..284W }}&lt;/ref&gt; to illustrate the plausibility of the [[Gaia hypothesis]].  In the original 1983 version, Daisyworld is seeded with two [[variety (botany)|varieties]] of [[Asteraceae|daisy]] as its only life forms: black daisies and white daisies. White petaled daisies reflect [[light]], while black petaled daisies absorb light. The simulation tracks the two daisy populations and the surface temperature of Daisyworld as the sun's rays grow more powerful.   The surface temperature of Daisyworld remains almost constant over a broad range of solar output.

== Mathematical model to sustain the Gaia hypothesis ==

The purpose of the model is to demonstrate that feedback mechanisms can evolve from the actions or activities of self-interested organisms, rather than through classic [[group selection]] mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The colour of the daisies influences the [[albedo]] of the planet such that black daisies absorb light and warm the planet, while white daisies reflect light and cool the planet. Competition between the daisies (based on temperature-effects on growth rates) leads to a balance of populations that tends to favour a planetary temperature close to the optimum for daisy growth.

Lovelock and Watson demonstrated the stability of Daisyworld by making its [[star|sun]] evolve along the [[main sequence]], taking it from low to high [[Solar radiation#Solar constant|solar constant]]. This perturbation of Daisyworld's receipt of [[solar radiation]] caused the balance of daisies to gradually shift from black to white but the planetary temperature was always regulated back to this optimum (except at the extreme ends of solar evolution). This situation is very different from the corresponding [[abiotic]] world, where temperature is unregulated and rises linearly with solar output.

Later versions of Daisyworld introduced a range of grey daisies, as well as populations of [[grazing|grazers]] and [[predation|predators]], and found that these further increased the stability of the [[homeostasis]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}. More recently, other research, modeling the real biochemical cycles of Earth, and using various types of organisms (e.g. [[photosynthesis]]ers, [[decomposition|decomposers]], [[herbivores]] and primary and secondary [[carnivores]]) has also been shown to produce Daisyworld-like regulation and stability, which helps to explain planetary [[biodiversity|biological diversity]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

This enables nutrient [[recycling]] within a regulatory framework derived by [[natural selection]] amongst [[species]], where one being's harmful waste becomes low energy food for members of another guild. This research on the [[Redfield ratio]] of nitrogen to phosphorus shows that local biotic processes can regulate global systems (See Keith [https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=cache:5cOZ-ijfXIoJ:www.ifi.ntnu.no/grupper/ai/eval/guild/guild.ps.gz+Gaia+theory  Downing] &amp; Peter Zvirinsky, ''The Simulated Evolution of Biochemical Guilds: Reconciling Gaia Theory with Natural Selection'').

== Original 1983 simulation synopsis ==
[[File:This World Is Black and White.ogv|thumb|300px|A short video about the DaisyWorld model and its implications for real world earth science.]]

At the beginning of the simulation, the sun's rays are weak and Daisyworld is too cold to support any life. Its surface is barren, and gray. As the [[luminosity]] of the sun's rays increases, [[germination]] of black daisies becomes possible. Because black daisies absorb more of the sun's [[radiant energy]], they are able to increase their individual temperatures to healthy levels on the still cool surface of Daisyworld. As a result, they thrive and the population soon grows large enough to increase the average surface temperature of Daisyworld.

As the surface heats up, it becomes more habitable for white daisies, whose competing population grows to rival the black daisy population. As the two populations reach [[:wikt:equilibrium|equilibrium]], so too does the surface temperature of Daisyworld, which settles on a value most comfortable for both populations.

In this first phase of the simulation we see that black daisies have warmed Daisyworld so that it is habitable over a wider range of solar luminosity than would have been possible on a barren, gray planet. This allowed growth of the white daisy population, and the two populations of daisies are now working together to regulate the surface temperature.

The second phase of the simulation documents what happens as the sun's luminosity continues to increase, heating the surface of Daisyworld beyond a comfortable range for the daisies. This temperature increase causes white daisies, who are better able to stay cool because of their high [[albedo]] or ability to reflect sunlight, to gain a selective advantage over the black daisies. White daisies begin replacing black daisies, which has a cooling effect on Daisyworld. The result is that Daisyworld's surface temperature remains habitable - in fact almost constant - even as the luminosity of the sun continues to increase.

In the third phase of the simulation, the sun's rays have grown so powerful that soon even the white daisies can no longer survive. At a certain luminosity their population crashes, and the barren, gray surface of Daisyworld, no longer able to reflect the sun's rays, rapidly heats up.

At this point in the simulation solar luminosity is programmed to decline, retracing its original path to its initial value. Even as it declines to levels that previously supported vast populations of daisies in the third phase, no daisies are able to grow because the surface of barren, gray Daisyworld is still far too hot. Eventually, the sun's rays decrease in power to a more comfortable level which allows white daisies to grow, who begin cooling the planet.

== Relevance to Earth ==

Because Daisyworld is so simplistic, having for example, no [[atmosphere]], no animals, only one species of plant life, and only the most basic population growth and death models, it should not be directly compared to Earth. This was stated very clearly by the original authors. Even so, it provided a number of useful predictions of how Earth's [[biosphere]] may respond to, for example, human interference. Later adaptations of Daisyworld (discussed below), which added many layers of complexity, still showed the same basic trends of the original model.

One prediction of the simulation is that the biosphere works to regulate the [[climate]], making it [[Planetary habitability|habitable]] over a wide range of solar luminosity. Many examples of these regulatory systems have been found on Earth.{{citation needed|date=March 2009}}

== Modifications to the original simulation ==

Daisyworld was designed to refute the idea that there was something inherently mystical about the Gaia hypothesis that Earth's surface displays homeostatic and homeorhetic properties similar to those of a living organism. Specifically, thermoregulation was addressed. The Gaia hypothesis had attracted a substantial amount of criticism from scientists such as Richard Dawkins,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dawkins | first1= R | authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=[[The extended phenotype]]: the long reach of the gene |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1982 |pages= |isbn=0-19-286088-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who argued that planet-level thermoregulation was impossible without planetary natural selection, which might involve evidence of dead planets that did not thermoregulate. Dr. W. Ford Doolittle&lt;ref&gt;Doolittle, W.F. "Is nature really motherly?" The Coevolution Quarterly, Spring:58–
63, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; rejected the notion of planetary regulation because it seemed to require a "secret consensus" among organisms, thus some sort of inexplicable purpose on a planetary scale. Incidentally, neither of these neoDarwinians made a close examination of the wide-ranging evidence presented in Lovelock's books that was suggestive of planetary regulation, dismissing the theory based on what they saw as its incompatibility with the latest views on the processes by which evolution works. Lovelock's model countered the criticism that some "secret consensus" would be required for planetary regulation by showing how in this model thermoregulation of the planet, beneficial to the two species, arises naturally.&lt;ref&gt;Sagan, D. and Whiteside, J. "Gradient-reduction theory: thermodynamics and the purpose of life" in Scientists Debate Gaia: The Next Century, MIT Press, Stephen H. Schneider, James R. Miller, Eileen Crist, and Penelope J. Boston, eds, pp. 173-186, 2004.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Later criticism of Daisyworld itself centers around the fact that although it is often used as an analogy for Earth, the original simulations leaves out many important details of the true [[Earth]] system. For example, the system requires an ad-hoc death rate (γ) to sustain homeostasis, and it does not take into account the difference between species-level phenomena and individual level phenomena. Detractors of the simulation believed inclusion of these details would cause it to become unstable, and therefore, false. Many of these issues are addressed in a more recent paper by Timothy Lenton and James Lovelock in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lenton |first=T.M. |author2=J.E. Lovelock |title=Daisyworld revisited: quantifying biological effects on planetary self-regulation |journal=[[Tellus B|Tellus Series B - Chemical and Physical Meteorology]] |volume=53 |issue=3 |year=2001 |pages=288–305 |doi=10.1034/j.1600-0889.2001.01191.x|bibcode = 2001TellB..53..288L }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this paper it is shown that inclusion of these factors actually improves Daisyworld's ability to regulate its climate.

==Biodiversity and stability of ecosystems==

The importance of the large number of species in an ecosystem, led to two sets of views about the role played by [[biodiversity]] in the stability of ecosystems in Gaia theory. In one school of thought labelled the "species redundancy" hypothesis, proposed by Australian ecologist [[Brian Walker (ecologist)|Brian Walker]], most species are seen as having little contribution overall in the stability, comparable to the passengers in an aeroplane who play little role in its successful flight. The hypothesis leads to the conclusion that only a few key species are necessary for a healthy ecosystem. The "rivet-popper" hypothesis put forth by [[Paul R. Ehrlich]] and his wife [[Anne H. Ehrlich]], compares each species forming part of an ecosystem as a rivet on the aeroplane (represented by the ecosystem). The progressive loss of species mirrors the progressive loss of rivets from the plane, weakening it  till it is no longer sustainable and crashes.&lt;ref name="LeakeyLewin1996"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard E. Leakey|author2=Roger Lewin|title=The sixth extinction: biodiversity and its survival|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=reogHQAACAAJ|accessdate=27 June 2011|date=4 November 1996|publisher=Phoenix|isbn=978-1-85799-473-5|pages=137–142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later extensions of the Daisyworld simulation which included [[rabbit]]s, [[fox]]es and other species, led to a surprising finding that the larger the number of species, the greater the improving effects on the entire planet (i.e., the temperature regulation was improved). It also showed that the system was robust and stable even when perturbed. Daisyworld simulations where environmental changes were stable gradually became less diverse over time; in contrast gentle perturbations led to bursts of species richness. These findings lent support to the idea that biodiversity is valuable.&lt;ref name="Lovelock2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Lovelock|title=The ages of Gaia: a biography of our living Earth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xW_T4jV9mFAC&amp;pg=PA215|accessdate=27 June 2011|date=28 September 2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-286217-4|pages=213–216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This finding was supported by an eleven-year-old study of the factors species composition, dynamics and diversity in successional and native grasslands in Minnesota by [[David Tilman]] and [[John A. Downing]] wherein they discovered that "primary productivity in more diverse plant communities is more resistant to, and recovers more fully from, a major drought". They go on to add "Our results support the diversity stability hypothesis but not the alternative hypothesis that most species are functionally redundant".&lt;ref name="LeakeyLewin1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tilman &amp; Downing 1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tilman |first1=David |last2=Downing |first2=John A. |year=1994 |title=Biodiversity and stability in grasslands |journal=Nature |publisher=Nature Publishing Group |volume=367 |issue=6461 |pages=363–365 |url=http://www.eeescience.utoledo.edu/Faculty/Gottgens/Conservation%20Biology/Hans%20papers%202010/Tilman%20and%20Downing%201994%20Nature.pdf |doi=10.1038/367363a0 |accessdate=27 June 2011 |bibcode=1994Natur.367..363T |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927030649/http://www.eeescience.utoledo.edu/Faculty/Gottgens/Conservation%20Biology/Hans%20papers%202010/Tilman%20and%20Downing%201994%20Nature.pdf |archivedate=27 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Death''', due to its [[wikt:prominence|prominent]] place in human culture, is frequently imagined as a [[personification|personified]] force, also known as the '''Grim Reaper'''. In some mythologies, the Grim Reaper causes the victim's death by coming to collect them. In turn, people in some stories try to hold on to life by avoiding Death's visit, or by fending Death off with bribery or tricks. Other beliefs hold that the Spectre of Death is only a [[psychopomp]], serving to sever the last ties between the soul and the body, and to guide the deceased to the [[afterlife]], without having any control over when or how the victim dies. Death is most often personified in male form, although in certain cultures Death is perceived as female (for instance, [[Marzanna]] in [[Slavic mythology]], or [[La Catrina]] in [[Mexico]]).

{{Main|Mot (god)}}
Mot (&lt;small&gt;{{abbr|lit.|literally}}&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;"Death") was personified to [[Canaanite religion|Canaanites]] as a [[god of death]]. He was considered a son of the [[king of the gods]], [[El (god)|El]]. His contest with the [[storm god]] [[Baʿal]] forms part of the [[Baʿal Cycle|myth cycle]] discovered in the 1920s in the ruins of [[Ugarit]]. [[Lacuna (MS)|Lacunae]] obscure some of the details, but Mot apparently consumes Baʿal before being split open and mutilated by that god's sister, the warrior 'Anat. After a time, both gods are restored and resume battle before the sun goddess [[Shapash]] prompts a truce by warning Mot that, if forced to, El would intervene on Baʿal's behalf. The [[Phoenician religion|Phoenicians]] also worshipped death under the name Mot and a version of Mot later became Maweth, the devil or angel of death in Judaism.&lt;ref name="Baal and Mot in the Ugaritic Texts"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cassuto|first1=U.|title=Baal and Mot in the Ugaritic Texts|journal=Israel Exploration Journal|date=1962|volume=12|issue=2|pages=81–83|jstor=27924890}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{bibleref|Hab.|2:5|HE}} &amp; {{bibleref|Job|18:13|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Thanatos}}
In [[Ancient Greek religion]] and [[Greek mythology]], death ([[Thanatos]]) is one of the children of [[Nyx]] (night). Like her, he is seldom portrayed directly. He sometimes appears in art as a bearded and winged man, less often as a winged and beardless youth. He has a twin, [[Hypnos]], the god of sleep. Together, Thanatos and Hypnos generally represent a gentle death. Thanatos, led by [[Hermes (mythology)|Hermes ''psychopompos'']], takes the shade of the deceased to the near shore of the river [[Styx]], whence the boatman [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]], on [[Charon's obol|payment of a small fee]], conveys the shade to [[Hades]], the realm of the dead. Homer's ''[[Iliad]]'' 16.681, and the [[Euphronios Krater]]'s depiction of the same episode, have [[Apollo]] instruct the removal of the heroic, semi-divine [[Sarpedon#Son of Zeus and Laodamia|Sarpedon]]'s body from the battlefield by Hypnos and Thanatos, and conveyed thence to his homeland for proper funeral rites.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Among the other children of Nyx are Thanatos' sisters, the [[Keres (Greek mythology)|Keres]], blood-drinking, vengeant spirits of violent or untimely death, portrayed as fanged and taloned, with bloody garments.

===Celtic===
[[Image:Banshee.jpg|thumbnail|left|''Bunworth Banshee'', "Fairy Legends and Traditions of the South of Ireland", by Thomas Crofton Croker, 1825]]
[[Bretons|Breton]] folklore shows a spectral figure portending death, the [[Ankou]] (''yr Angau'' in [[Welsh language|Welsh]]). Usually, the Ankou is the spirit of the last person that died within the community and appears as a tall, haggard figure with a wide hat and long white hair or a skeleton with a revolving head who sees everyone, everywhere. The Ankou drives a deathly wagon or cart with a creaking axle. The cart or wagon is piled high with corpses and a stop at a cabin means instant death for those inside.&lt;ref&gt;Anatole Le Braz : Légende de la Mort&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ireland there was a creature known as a [[dullahan]], whose head would be tucked under his or her arm (dullahans were not one, but an entire species), and the head was said to have large eyes and a smile that could reach the head's ears. The dullahan would ride a black horse or a carriage pulled by black horses, and stop at the house of someone about to die, and call their name, and immediately the person would die. The dullahan did not like being watched, and it was believed that if a dullahan knew someone was watching them, they would lash that person's eyes with their whip, which was made from a spine; or they would toss a basin of blood on the person, which was a sign that the person was next to die.

Also in Ireland there is a female [[spirit]] known as [[Banshee]] (Gaelic: ''ban sibh'' pron. banshee, ''white spirit/fairy''), who heralds the death of a person, usually by shrieking or keening. The banshee is often described in Gaelic lore as wearing red or green, usually with long, disheveled hair. She can appear in a variety of forms. Perhaps most often she is seen as an ugly, frightful hag, but she can also appear as young and beautiful if she chooses. In Ireland and parts of Scotland, a traditional part of mourning is the keening woman (bean chaointe), who wails a lament – in [[Irish language|Irish]]: Caoineadh, caoin meaning "to weep, to wail". When several banshees appear at once, it indicates the death of someone great or holy. The tales sometimes recounted that the woman, though called a fairy, was a ghost, often of a specific murdered woman, or a mother who died in childbirth.

In Scottish folklore there was a belief that a black, dark green or white dog known as a [[Cù Sìth]] took dying souls to the afterlife.

In Welsh Folklore Gwyn ap Nudd is the escort of the grave, the personification of Death and Winter who leads the wild hunt to collect wayward souls and escort them to the Otherworld, sometimes it is Melwas, Arawn or Afallach in a similar position.

===Latin America===
[[File:Posada2.Catrina.jpeg|thumbnail|left|[[La Calavera Catrina]]]]

[[La Calavera Catrina]] is a character in Mexican culture and art that symbolizes death. She is an icon of the Mexican [[Day of the Dead]], a holiday that focuses on the remembrance of the dead.

[[Santa Muerte|Our Lady of the Holy Death]] (Santa Muerte) is a female [[deity]] or [[folk saint]] of Mexican folk religion, whose faith has been spreading in [[Mexico]] and the [[United States]]. In Spanish the word "muerte" (death in English) is a [[Grammatical gender in Spanish|female noun]], so it is common in Spanish-speaking countries for death to be personified as female figures. This also happens in other [[Romance languages|Romanic languages]] like [[French language|French]] ("la mort"), [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ("a morte") and [[Italian language|Italian]] ("la morte"). Since the [[pre-Columbian era]] Mexican culture has maintained a certain reverence towards death, which can be seen in the widespread commemoration of the [[Day of the Dead]]. Elements of that celebration include the use of skeletons to remind people of their mortality. The cult of Santa Muerte is indeed a continuation of the Aztec cult of the goddess of death [[Mictecacihuatl]] ([[Nahuatl]] for "Lady of the Dead") clad in Spanish iconography.

In [[Aztec mythology]], Mictecacihuatl is the "[[Queen regnant|Queen]] of [[Mictlan]]" ([[Mictlancihuatl]]), the [[underworld]], ruling over the [[afterlife]] with [[Mictlantecuhtli]], another [[deity]] who is designated as her husband. Her role is to keep watch over the bones of the dead. She presided over the ancient festivals of the dead, which evolved from Aztec traditions into the modern Day of the Dead after synthesis with Spanish cultural traditions. She is said now to preside over the contemporary festival as well. She is known as the "Lady of the Dead" since it is believed that she was born, then sacrificed as an infant. Mictecacihuatl was represented with a defleshed body and with jaw agape to swallow the stars during the day.

[[San La Muerte]] (Saint Death) is a skeletal folk saint that is venerated in [[Paraguay]], the Northeast of [[Argentina]] and southern [[Brazil]]. As the result of internal migration in Argentina since the 1960s the veneration of San La Muerte has been extended to [[Greater Buenos Aires]] and the national prison system as well. Saint Death is depicted as a male skeleton figure usually holding a [[scythe]]. Although the [[Catholic Church]] in Mexico has attacked the devotion of Saint Death as a tradition that mixes paganism with Christianity and is contrary to the Christian belief of Christ defeating death, many devotees consider the veneration of San La Muerte as being part of their [[Catholic faith]]. The rituals connected to and powers ascribed to San La Muerte are very similar to those of Santa Muerte.

In [[Guatemala]], [[San Pascualito]] is a skeletal folk saint venerated as "King of the Graveyard". He is depicted as a skeletal figure with a scythe, sometimes wearing a cape and crown. He is associated with death and the curing of diseases.

In the Brazilian religion [[Umbanda]], the [[orixá]] [[Omolu]] personifies sickness and death, and also the cure. The image of the death is also associated with [[Eshu|Exu]], lord of the crossroads, who rules the midnight and the cemeteries.

In [[Haitian Vodou]], the [[Guédé]] are a family of spirits that embody death and fertility.

===Slavic===
In [[Poland]], Death, or ''Śmierć'', has an appearance similar to the traditional Grim Reaper, but instead of a black robe, Death has a white robe. Also, due to grammar, Death is a female (the word ''śmierć'' is of feminine gender), mostly seen as an old skeletal woman, as depicted in 15th-century [[dialogue]] [[Master Polikarp's Dialog with Death|''"Rozmowa Mistrza Polikarpa ze Śmiercią"'']] (Latin: ''"Dialogus inter Mortem et Magistrum Polikarpum"'').

In Serbia and other Slavic countries, Grim Reaper is well known as ''Smrt'' ("Death") or ''Kosač'' ("Billhook"), Slavic people found this very similar to the Devil and other dark powers. One popular saying about the Grim Reaper is: ''Smrt ne bira ni vreme, ni mesto, ni godinu'' ("Death is not choosing a time, place or years" - which means she is destiny.){{original research inline|date=May 2017}}

===The Low Countries===
In the [[Netherlands]], but also to lesser extent in [[Belgium]], the personification of Death is known as ''Magere Hein'' ("Meager Hein"). Historically, he was sometimes simply referred to as ''Hein'' or variations thereof such as ''Heintje'', ''Heintjeman'' and ''Oom Hendrik'' ("Uncle [[Henry (given name)|Hendrik]]"). Related archaic terms are ''Beenderman'' ("Bone-man"), ''Scherminkel'' (very meager person, "skeleton") and ''Maaijeman'' ("[[mower|mow]]-man", a reference to his [[scythe]]).&lt;ref name=booze/&gt;

The concept of ''Magere Hein'' was pre-[[Christian]] and tied to [[Pagan]] beliefs, but it was [[Christianization of saints and feasts|Christianized]] and likely gained its modern name and features (scythe, skeleton, black robe etc.) during the [[Middle Ages]]. The designation "Meager" comes from its portrayal as a [[Skeleton (undead)|skeleton]], which was largely influenced by the Christian "[[Dance of Death]]" ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''dodendans'') theme that was prominent in Europe during the late Middle Ages. "Hein" was a [[Middle Dutch]] name originating as a short form of ''Heinric'' (see [[Henry (given name)]]). Its use was possibly related to the comparable German concept of "Freund Hein". Notable is that many of the names given to Death can also refer to the Devil, showing how his status as a feared and "evil" being led to him being merged into the concept of [[Satan]].&lt;ref name=booze&gt;{{cite book |last1=Niermeyer |first1=Antonie |date=1840 |title=Verhandeling over het booze wezen in het bijgeloof onzer natie: eene bijdrage tot de kennis onzer voorvaderlijke mythologie |trans-title=Treatise on the evil being in the superstition of our nation: a contribution to the knowledge of our ancestral mythology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n09bAAAAQAAJ |language=Dutch |location=[[Rotterdam]] |publisher=A.

In Belgium, this personification of Death is now commonly called ''Pietje de Dood'' "Little Pete, the Death".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hln.be/hln/nl/960/Buitenland/article/detail/1730183/2013/10/27/Pietje-de-Dood-jaagt-mensen-de-stuipen-op-het-lijf-in-de-VS.dhtml|title='Pietje de Dood' jaagt mensen de stuipen op het lijf in de VS|publisher=|accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with some of the Dutch names, it can also refer to the Devil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.verhalenbank.nl/items/show/35545|title=Nederlandse Volksverhalenbank - Duivel|website=www.verhalenbank.nl|accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Hel (1889) by Johannes Gehrts.jpg|thumb|''Hel'' (1889) by [[Johannes Gehrts]], pictured here with her hound [[Garmr]].]]
In [[Scandinavia]], in [[Norse mythology]] death was personified in the shape of [[Hel (being)|Hel]], the goddess of death and ruler over the realm of the same name, where she received a portion of the dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/259835/Hel |title=Hel (Norse deity) – Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Global.britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the times of the [[Black Plague]], Death would often be depicted as an old woman known by the name of Pesta, meaning "plague hag". She wore a black hood. She would go into a town carrying either a rake or a broom. If she brought the rake, some people would survive the plague; if she brought the broom, however, everyone would die.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://snl.no/d%C3%B8d%2Ffolketro |title=død – folketro – Store norske leksikon |publisher=Snl.no |date= |accessdate=2013-12-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212113026/http://snl.no/d%C3%B8d/folketro |archivedate=12 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Scandinavians adopted the classic Grim Reaper with a scythe and black robe.{{Citation needed|reason=When? Why?|date=December 2018}}

===Baltic===
[[Lithuanian people|Lithuanians]] named Death ''Giltinė'', deriving from the word ''gelti'' ("to sting"). Giltinė was viewed as an old, ugly woman with a long blue nose and a deadly poisonous tongue. The legend tells that Giltinė was young, pretty and communicative until she was trapped in a coffin for seven years. The goddess of death was a sister of the goddess of life and destiny, [[Laima]], symbolizing the relationship between beginning and end.

Lithuanians later adopted the classic Grim Reaper with a scythe and black robe.

===India===
[[File:Yama's Court and Hell.jpg|thumb|[[Yama (Hinduism)|Yama]], the Hindu lord of death, presiding over his court in hell]]
The Sanskrit word for death is ''mrityu'' (cognate with Latin ''mors'' and Polish ''śmierć''), which is often personified in [[Dharmic religions]].

In [[Hinduism|Hindu]] scriptures, the lord of death is called [[Yama (Hinduism)|King Yama]] ({{lang|sk|यम राज}}, ''Yama Rājā''). He is also known as the King of [[Dharma|Karmic Justice]] (''Dharmaraja'') as one's [[karma]] at death was considered to lead to a just [[reincarnation|rebirth]]. ([[Yudhishthira]], eldest of the [[pandava]]s and a personification of justice, was born through [[Kunti]]'s prayers to Yama.) Yama rides a black [[Water Buffalo|buffalo]] and carries a rope lasso to carry the [[soul]] back to his home, called [[Naraka (Hinduism)|Naraka]], pathalloka, or Yamaloka. There are many forms of reapers, although some say there is only one who disguises himself as a small child. His agents, the [[Yamaduta]]s, carry souls back to Yamalok. There, all the accounts of a person's good and bad deeds are stored and maintained by [[Chitragupta]]. The balance of these deeds allows Yama to decide where the soul has to reside in its next life, following the theory of [[reincarnation]]. Yama is also mentioned in the [[Mahabharata]] as a great philosopher and devotee of the Supreme [[Brahman]].

Buddhist scriptures also mention [[Mara (demon)|Mara]], much in the similar way.

===East Asia===
[[Yama (East Asia)|Yama]] was introduced to [[Chinese mythology]] through [[Buddhist mythology|Buddhism]]. In Chinese, he is known as [[King Yan]] (&lt;small&gt;[[traditional characters|t]]&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{lang|zh|{{linktext|閻|王}}}}, &lt;small&gt;[[simplified characters|s]]&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{lang|zh|{{linktext|阎|王}}}}, &lt;small&gt;[[pinyin|p]]&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;''Yánwáng'') or [[Yanluo]] (&lt;small&gt;[[traditional characters|t]]&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{lang|zh|{{linktext|閻羅|王}}}}, &lt;small&gt;[[simplified characters|s]]&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{lang|zh|{{linktext|阎罗|王}}}}, &lt;small&gt;[[pinyin|p]]&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;''Yánluówáng''), ruling the ten gods of the [[underworld]] [[Diyu]]. He is normally depicted wearing a Chinese judge's cap and [[hanfu|traditional Chinese robes]] and appears on most forms of [[hell money]] offered in [[Chinese ancestral veneration|ancestor worship]]. From China, Yama spread to [[Japanese mythology|Japan]] as the Great King Enma ({{lang|ja|{{linktext|閻魔|大|王}}}}, ''Enma-Dai-Ō''), ruler of Jigoku ({{lang|ja|{{linktext|地獄}}}}); [[Korean mythology|Korea]] as the Great King Yŏmna ({{lang|ko|{{linktext|염라|대|왕}}}}), ruler of Jiok ({{lang|ko|{{linktext|지옥}}}}); and [[Vietnamese mythology|Vietnam]] as ''{{lang|vi|Diêm La Vương}}'', ruler of ''{{lang|vi|Địa Ngục}}'' or ''{{lang|vi|Âm Phủ}}''

Separately, the ''[[Kojiki]]'' relates that the [[Japanese mythology|Japanese]] goddess [[Izanami-no-Mikoto|Izanami]] was burnt to death giving birth to the fire god [[Kagu-tsuchi|Hinokagutsuchi]]. She then entered a realm of perpetual night called [[Yomi|Yomi-no-Kuni]]. Her husband [[Izanagi]] pursued her there but discovered his wife was no longer as beautiful as before. After an argument, she promises she will take a thousand lives every day, becoming a goddess of death. There are also death gods called [[shinigami]] (死神), which are closer to the Western tradition of the Grim Reaper; while common in modern Japanese arts and fiction, they were essentially absent in traditional mythology.

In [[Korean mythology]], the equivalent of the Grim Reaper is the "Netherworld Emissary" Jeoseung-saja ({{lang|ko|{{linktext|저승사자}}}}). He is depicted as a stern and ruthless bureaucrat in Yŏmna's service. A [[psychopomp]], he escorts all—good or evil—from the land of the living to the netherworld when the time comes.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://210.204.213.131/minsok/dic_index.jsp?P_MENU=04&amp;DIC_ID=2506&amp;ref=T2&amp;s_idx=4&amp;P_INDEX=0&amp;cur_page=1 |title=The Korean National Encyclopedia of Ethnic Practices (Page in Korean) |publisher=210.204.213.131 |date= |accessdate=2013-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Abrahamic religions==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Angel]] --&gt;
{{see also|Destroying angel (Bible)}}
The "[[Angel of the Lord]]" smites 185,000 men in the [[Assyria]]n camp (II Kings 19:35). When the Angel of Death passes through to [[Plagues of Egypt|smite the Egyptian first-born]], [[God]] prevents "the destroyer" (''shâchath'') from entering houses with blood on the lintel and side posts ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 12:23). The "destroying angel" (''mal'ak ha-mashḥit'') rages among the people in Jerusalem (II Sam. 24:16). In I Chronicles 21:15 the "angel of the Lord" is seen by [[David|King David]] standing "between the earth and the [[heaven]], having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over [[Jerusalem]]." The biblical [[Book of Job]] (33:22) uses the general term "destroyers" (''memitim''), which tradition has identified with "destroying angels" (''mal'ake Khabbalah''), and Prov. 16:14 uses the term the "angels of death" (''mal'ake ha-mavet''). The angel [[Azrael|Azra'il]] is sometimes referred as the Angel of Death as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|last1=Davidson|first1=Gustav|year=1967|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/A_dictionary_of_angels.html?id=Ed7yHWuTEewC|title=A Dictionary of Angels, Including the Fallen Angels|ISBN=9780029070505}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|64–65}}

Jewish tradition also refers to Death as the Angel of Dark and Light, a name which stems from Talmudic lore. There is also a reference to "[[Abaddon]]" (The Destroyer), an Angel who is known as the "Angel of the Abyss". In [[Talmudic lore]], he is characterized as [[archangel]] [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]].&lt;ref&gt;Bunson, Matthew, (1996). Angels A to Z : Who's Who of the Heavenly Host.

===In Judaism===
[[File:Mort du fossoyeur.jpg|thumb|''La mort du fossoyeur'' (Death of the gravedigger) by [[Carlos Schwabe]]]]

In Hebrew scriptures, Death ("''Maweth''/''Mavet(h)''") is sometimes personified as a devil or angel of death (e.g., {{bibleverse||Habakkuk|2:5|NRSV}}; {{bibleverse||Job|18:13|NRSV}}).&lt;ref name="Baal and Mot in the Ugaritic Texts"/&gt; In both the [[Book of Hosea]] and the [[Book of Jeremiah]], [[Mot (god)|Maweth/Mot]] is mentioned as a deity to whom Yahweh can turn over Judah as punishment for worshiping other gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Appearance of the Pantheon in Judah in The Triumph of Elohim|last=Handy|first=Lowell|publisher=Eerdmans|year=1995|isbn=0-8028-4161-9|location=Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The memitim are a type of angel from biblical lore associated with the mediation over the lives of the dying. The name is derived from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word ''mĕmītǐm'' (מְמִיתִים – "executioners", "slayers", "destroyers") and refers to angels that brought about the destruction of those whom the [[guardian angel]]s no longer protected.&lt;ref&gt;Olyan, S.M., A Thousand Thousands Served Him: Exegesis and the Naming of Angels in Ancient Judaism, page 21.&lt;/ref&gt; While there may be some debate among religious scholars regarding the exact nature of the memitim, it is generally accepted that, as described in the [[Book of Job]] 33:22, they are killers of some sort.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, M.B., Medicine among the Ancient Hebrews, page 472.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Form and functions====
According to the [[Midrash]], the Angel of Death was created by God on the first day.&lt;ref&gt;[[Midrash]] [[Tanhuma]] on [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 39:1&lt;/ref&gt; His dwelling is in [[heaven]], whence he reaches earth in eight flights, whereas Pestilence reaches it in one.&lt;ref&gt;[[Talmud]] [[Berakhot (Talmud)|Berakhot]] 4b&lt;/ref&gt; He has twelve wings.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer]] 13&lt;/ref&gt; "Over all people have I surrendered thee the power," said God to the Angel of Death, "only not over this one [i.e. [[Moses]]] which has received freedom from death through the Law."&lt;ref&gt;[[Midrash]] [[Tanhuma]] on [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 31:18&lt;/ref&gt; It is said of the Angel of Death that he is full of eyes. In the hour of death, he stands at the head of the departing one with a drawn sword, to which clings a drop of [[bile|gall]]. As soon as the dying man sees Death, he is seized with a convulsion and opens his mouth, whereupon Death throws the drop into it. This drop causes his death; he turns putrid, and his face becomes yellow.&lt;ref&gt;[[Talmud]] [[Avodah Zarah]] 20b; on putrefaction see also Pesikta de-Rav Kahana 54b; for the eyes compare Ezekiel 1:18 and [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 4:6&lt;/ref&gt; The expression "the taste of death" originated in the idea that death was caused by a drop of gall.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jewish Quarterly Review]] vi. 327&lt;/ref&gt;

The soul escapes through the mouth, or, as is stated in another place, through the throat; therefore, the Angel of Death stands at the head of the patient ([[Adolf Jellinek]], l.c. ii. 94, Midr. Teh. to Ps. xi.). When the soul forsakes the body, its voice goes from one end of the world to the other, but is not heard (Gen. R. vi. 7; Ex. R. v. 9; Pirḳe R. El. xxxiv.). The drawn sword of the Angel of Death, mentioned by the Chronicler (I. Chron. 21:15; comp. Job 15:22; Enoch 62:11), indicates that the Angel of Death was figured as a warrior who kills off the children of men. "Man, on the day of his death, falls down before the Angel of Death like a beast before the slaughterer" ([[Grünhut]], "Liḳḳuṭim", v. 102a). R. Samuel's father (c. 200) said: "The Angel of Death said to me, 'Only for the sake of the honor of mankind do I not tear off their necks as is done to slaughtered beasts'" ('Ab. Zarah 20b). In later representations, the knife sometimes replaces the sword, and reference is also made to the cord of the Angel of Death, which indicates death by throttling. [[Moses]] says to God: "I fear the cord of the Angel of Death" (Grünhut, l.c. v. 103a et seq.). Of the four [[Jewish]] methods of execution, three are named in connection with the Angel of Death: Burning (by pouring hot lead down the victim's throat), slaughtering (by beheading), and throttling. The Angel of Death administers the particular punishment that God has ordained for the commission of sin.

A peculiar [[Mantle (vesture)|mantle]] ("idra"-according to Levy, "Neuhebr. Wörterb." i. 32, a sword) belongs to the equipment of the Angel of Death ([[Ecclesiastes Rabbah|Eccl. R.]] iv. 7). The Angel of Death takes on the particular form which will best serve his purpose; e.g., he appears to a scholar in the form of a beggar imploring pity (The beggar should receive [[Tzedakah]].)(M. Ḳ. 28a). "When pestilence rages in the town, walk not in the middle of the street, because the Angel of Death [i.e., pestilence] strides there; if peace reigns in the town, walk not on the edges of the road. When pestilence rages in the town, go not alone to the synagogue, because there the Angel of Death stores his tools. If the dogs howl, the Angel of Death has entered the city; if they make sport, the prophet [[Elijah]] has come" (B. Ḳ. 60b). The "destroyer" (''saṭan ha-mashḥit'') in the daily prayer is the Angel of Death (Ber. 16b). Midr. Ma'ase Torah (compare Jellinek, "B. H." ii. 98) says: "There are six Angels of Death: [[Gabriel]] over kings; Ḳapẓiel over youths; Mashbir over animals; Mashḥit over children; Af and Ḥemah over man and beast."

====Scholars and the Angel of Death====
[[File:Paolo Monti - Serie fotografica (Venezia, 1951) - BEIC 6342929.jpg|thumb|''The Angel of Death'', sculpture of a funeral gondola, Venice. Photo by Paolo Monti, 1951.]]
[[Talmud]] teachers of the 4th century associate quite familiarly with him. When he appeared to one on the street, the teacher reproached him with rushing upon him as upon a beast, whereupon the angel called upon him at his house. To another, he granted a respite of thirty days, that he might put his knowledge in order before entering the next world. To a third, he had no access, because he could not interrupt the study of the Talmud. To a fourth, he showed a rod of fire, whereby he is recognized as the Angel of Death (M. K. 28a). He often entered the house of Bibi and conversed with him (Ḥag. 4b). Often, he resorts to strategy in order to interrupt and seize his victim (B. M. 86a; Mak. 10a).

The death of [[Joshua ben Levi]] in particular is surrounded with a web of fable. When the time came for him to die and the Angel of Death appeared to him, he demanded to be shown his place in paradise. When the angel had consented to this, he demanded the angel's knife, that the angel might not frighten him by the way. This request also was granted him, and Joshua sprang with the knife over the wall of paradise; the angel, who is not allowed to enter paradise, caught hold of the end of his garment. Joshua swore that he would not come out, and God declared that he should not leave paradise unless he was absolved from his oath; if not absolved, he was to remain. The Angel of Death then demanded back his knife, but Joshua refused. At this point, a heavenly voice (''bat ḳol'') rang out: "Give him back the knife, because the children of men have need of it will bring death." Hesitant, Joshua Ben Levi gives back the knife in exchange for the Angel of Deaths name. To never forget the name he carved Troke into his arm the Angel of Death's chosen name. When the knife was returned to the Angel Joshua's carving of the name faded and he forgot.
(Ket. 77b; Jellinek, l.c. ii. 48–51; Bacher, l.c. i. 192 et seq.).

====Rabbinic views====
The [[Rabbi]]s found the Angel of Death mentioned in [[Psalm]] 89:48, where the Targum translates: "There is no man who lives and, seeing the Angel of Death, can deliver his soul from his hand." Eccl. 8:4 is thus explained in [[Midrash]] Rabbah to the passage: "One may not escape the Angel of Death, nor say to him, 'Wait until I put my affairs in order,' or 'There is my son, my slave: take him in my stead.'" Where the Angel of Death appears, there is no remedy, but his name ([[Talmud]], Ned. 49a; Hul. 7b). If one who has sinned has confessed his fault, the Angel of Death may not touch him ([[Tanhuma|Midrash Tanhuma]], ed. Buber, 139). God protects from the Angel of Death (Midrash [[Genesis Rabba]]h lxviii.).

By acts of benevolence, the anger of the Angel of Death is overcome; when one fails to perform such acts the Angel of Death will make his appearance (Derek Ereẓ Zuṭa, viii.). The Angel of Death receives his orders from God (Ber. 62b). As soon as he has received permission to destroy, however, he makes no distinction between good and bad (B. Ḳ. 60a). In the city of Luz, the Angel of Death has no power, and, when the aged inhabitants are ready to die, they go outside the city (Soṭah 46b; compare Sanh. 97a). A legend to the same effect existed in Ireland in the Middle Ages (''[[Jewish Quarterly Review|Jew. Quart. Rev.]]'' vi. 336).

===In Islam===
{{Main|Islamic view of death}}
In [[Islam]], Archangel [[Azrail]] is the ''Malak al-Maut'' (angel of death). He and his many subordinates pull the souls out of the bodies, and guide them through the journey of the afterlife. Their appearance depends on the person's deed and actions, with those that did good seeing a beautiful being, and those that did wrong seeing a horrific monster.

Islamic tradition discusses elaborately, almost in graphic detail, as to what exactly happens before, during, and after the death. The angel of death appears to the dying to take out their souls. The sinners' souls are extracted in a most painful way while the righteous are treated easily.&lt;ref name="Stefon-83"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Matt Stefon|title=Islamic Beliefs and Practices |publisher=[[Britannica Educational Publishing]] |year=2010 |location=[[New York City|New York]] |isbn=978-1-61530-060-0|pages=83–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the burial, two angels – [[Munkar and Nakir]] – come to question the dead in order to test their faith. The righteous believers answer correctly and live in peace and comfort while the sinners and disbelievers fail and punishments ensue.&lt;ref name="Stefon-83"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nigosian-123"&gt;{{cite book |last=Nigosian |first=S. A. |title= Islam: Its History, Teaching, and Practices |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=my7hnALd_NkC&amp;pg=PA123 |year=2004 | isbn= 0-253-21627-3 |pages=123–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The time period or stage between death and resurrection is called ''[[barzakh]]'' (the interregnum).&lt;ref name="Stefon-83"/&gt;

Death is a significant event in Islamic life and theology. It is seen not as the termination of life, rather the continuation of life in another form. In Islamic belief, God has made this worldly life as a test and a preparation ground for the [[Afterlife#Islam|afterlife]]; and with death, this worldly life comes to an end.&lt;ref name="Leaman-27"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor= Oliver Leaman |encyclopedia= The Qur'an: An Encyclopedia |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=isDgI0-0Ip4C&amp;pg=PA27|publisher=[[Routledge]] |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-415-32639-1|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, every person has only one chance to prepare themselves for the life to come where [[God in Islam|God]] will resurrect and judge every individual and will entitle them to rewards or punishment, based on their good or bad deeds.&lt;ref name="Leaman-27"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor=Juan E. Campo |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Islam |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OZbyz_Hr-eIC&amp;pg=PA185 |publisher=[[Facts on File]] |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-8160-5454-1|page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; And death is seen as the gateway to and beginning of the afterlife. In Islamic belief, death is predetermined by God, and the exact time of a person's death is known only to God.

[[File:Decentralization.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Graphical comparison of a centralised (A) and a decentralised (B) system]]

A '''decentralised system''' in [[systems theory]] is a system in which lower level components operate on local information to accomplish global goals. The global pattern of behaviour is an [[emergent property]] of dynamical mechanisms that act upon local components, such as indirect communication, rather than the result of a central ordering influence (see [[centralised system]]).

==Centralised versus decentralised systems==
A centralised system is one in which a central controller exercises control over the lower-level components of the system directly or through the use of a power [[hierarchy]] (such as instructing a middle level component to instruct a lower level component).&lt;ref&gt;Bekey, G. A. (2005). Autonomous Robots: From Biological Inspiration to Implementation and Control. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. {{page needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[complexity|complex]] [[behaviour]] exhibited by this system is thus the result of the central controller's "control" over lower level components in the system, including the active supervision of the lower level components.

A decentralised system, on the other hand, is one in which complex behaviour emerges through the work of lower level components operating on local information, not the instructions of any commanding influence. This form of control is known as [[distributed control]], or control in which each component of the system is equally responsible for contributing to the global, complex behaviour by acting on local information in the appropriate manner. The lower level components are implicitly aware of these appropriate responses through mechanisms that are based on the component's interaction with the environment, including other components in that environment.

==Self-organisation==
Decentralised systems are intricately linked to the idea of [[self-organisation]]—a phenomenon in which local interactions between components of a system establish order and coordination to achieve global goals without a central commanding influence. The rules specifying these interactions emerge from local information and in the case of biological (or biologically-inspired) agents, from the closely linked perception and action system of the agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(97)01048-3 |title=Self-organization in social insects |year=1997 |last1=Bonabeau |first1=Eric |last2=Theraulaz |first2=Guy |last3=Deneubourg |first3=Jean-Louls |last4=Aron |first4=Serge |last5=Camazine |first5=Scott |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |volume=12 |issue=5 |pages=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; These interactions continually form and depend on [[spatio-temporal pattern]]s, which are created through the [[positive feedback|positive]] and [[negative feedback]] that the interactions provide. For example, recruitment in the [[foraging]] behaviour of [[ants]] relies on the positive feedback of the ant finding food at the end of a [[pheromone]] trail while ants' [[task switching (psychology)|task-switching]] behaviour relies on the negative feedback of making [[antenna (biology)|antennal]] contact with a certain number of ants (for example, a sufficiently low encounter rate with successful foragers can cause a midden worker to switch to foraging, although other factors like food availability can affect the threshold for switching).

== Examples ==
While decentralised systems can easily be found in nature, they are also evident in aspects of human society such as governmental and economic systems.

=== Biological: Insect colonies ===
[[File:Ants eating fruit.jpg|right|thumb|A large number of [[Ant]]s eating a piece of [[fruit]].]]

One of the most well known examples of a "natural" decentralized system is one used by certain [[Insect colony|insect colonies]]. In these insect colonies, control is distributed among the [[homogeneous]] biological agents who act upon local information and local interactions to collectively create complex, global behaviour. While individually exhibiting simple behaviours, these agents achieve global goals such as feeding the colony or raising the [[Offspring|brood]] by using dynamical mechanisms like non-explicit communication and exploiting their closely coupled action and perception systems. Without any form of central control, these insect colonies achieve global goals by performing required tasks, responding to changing conditions in the colony environment in terms of task-activity, and subsequently adjusting the number of workers performing each task to ensure that all tasks are completed.&lt;ref name="Gordon"&gt;Gordon, D. (2010). Ant Encounters: Interaction Networks and Colony Behavior. Princeton, NJ: [[Princeton U Press]]. {{page needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ant colonies guide their global behaviour (in terms of foraging, patrolling, [[brood care]], and nest maintenance) using a pulsing, shifting web of [[spatio-temporal pattern]]ed interactions that rely on antennal contact rate and [[olfaction|olfactory]] sensing. While these interactions consist of both interactions with the environment and each other, ants do not direct the behaviour of other ants and thus never have a "central controller" dictating what is to be done to achieve global goals.

Instead, ants use a flexible [[task allocation and partitioning of social insects|task-allocation system]] that allows the colony to respond rapidly to changing needs for achieving these goals. This task-allocation system, similar to a [[division of labor]] is flexible in that all tasks rely on either the number of ant encounters (which take the form of antennal contact) and the sensing of chemical gradients (using olfactory sensing for pheromone trails) and can thus be applied to the entire ant population. While recent research has shown that certain tasks may have physiologically and age-based response thresholds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=19776072 |year=2009 |last1=Robinson |first1=EJ |last2=Feinerman |first2=O |last3=Franks |first3=NR |title=Flexible task allocation and the organization of work in ants |volume=276 | issue=1677 |pages=4373–80 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2009.1244 |pmc=2817103 |journal=Proceedings: Biological Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; all tasks can be completed by "any" ant in the colony.

For example, in foraging behaviour, [[red harvester ants]] (''Pogonomyrmex barbatus'') communicate to other ants where [[food]] is, how much food there is, and whether or not they should switch tasks to forage based on cuticular [[hydrocarbon]] scents and the rate of ant-interaction. By using the combined odors of forager cuticular hydrocarbons and of seeds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/423032a |title=Social insects: [[Cuticular hydrocarbon]]s inform task decisions |year=2003 |last1=Greene |first1=Michael J. |last2=Gordon |first2=Deborah M. |journal=Nature |volume=423 |issue=6935 |pages=32 |pmid=12721617}}&lt;/ref&gt; and interaction rate using brief antennal contact, the colony captures precise information about the current availability of food and thus whether or not they should switch to foraging behaviour "all without being directed by a central controller or even another ant". The rate at which foragers return with seeds sets the rate at which outgoing foragers leave the nest on foraging trips; faster rates of return indicate more food availability and fewer interactions indicate a greater need for foragers. A combination of these two factors, which are solely based on local information from the environment, leads to decisions about switching to the foraging task and ultimately, to achieving the global goal of feeding the colony.

In short, the use of a combination of simple cues makes it possible for red harvester ant colonies to make an accurate and rapid adjustment of foraging activity that corresponds to the current availability of food&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0052219 |title=Interactions with Combined Chemical Cues Inform Harvester Ant Foragers' Decisions to Leave the Nest in Search of Food |year=2013 |editor1-last=Fenton |editor1-first=Brock |last1=Greene |first1=Michael J. |last2=Pinter-Wollman |first2=Noa |last3=Gordon |first3=Deborah M. |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=8 |pages=e52219 |pmid=23308106 |issue=1 |pmc=3540075}}&lt;/ref&gt; while using positive feedback for regulation of the process: the faster outgoing foragers meet ants returning with seeds, the more ants go out to forage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Carey |first=Bjorn |work=Stanford Report |date=May 15, 2013 |url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2013/may/ants-forage-evolve-051413.html |title=Evolution shapes new rules for ant behavior, Stanford research finds |accessdate=November 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ants then continue to use these local cues in finding food, as they use their olfactory senses to pick up pheromone trails laid by other ants and follow the trail in a descending gradient to the food source. Instead of being directed by other ants or being told as to where the food is, ants rely on their closely coupled action and perception systems to collectively complete the global task.&lt;ref name="Gordon" /&gt;

While [[red harvester ant]] colonies achieve their global goals using a decentralised system, not all insect colonies function this way. For example, the foraging behaviour of ''[[wasps]]'' is under the constant regulation and control of the queen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1163/156853986X00090 |title=Queen Regulation of Worker Foraging in [[Paper Wasp]]s: A Social Feedback Control System (Polistes Fuscatus, Hymenoptera: Vespidae) |year=1987 |last1=Reeve |first1=Hudson K. |last2=Gamboa |first2=George J. |journal=Behaviour |volume=102 |issue=3 |pages=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human society: Market economy ===
A [[market economy]] is an economy in which decisions on investment and the allocation of producer goods are mainly made through markets and not by a plan of production (see [[planned economy]]). A market economy is a decentralised economic system because it does not function via a central, economic plan (which is usually headed by a governmental body) but instead, acts through the distributed, local interactions in the market (e.g. individual [[investment]]s). While a "market economy" is a broad term and can differ greatly in terms of state or governmental control (and thus central control), the final "behaviour" of any market economy emerges from these local interactions and is not directly the result of a central body's set of instructions or regulation.

===Artificial intelligence and robotics===
While classic [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) in the 1970s was focused on knowledge-based systems or planning robots, [[Rodney Brooks]]' [[behavior-based robotics|behaviour-based robots]] and their success in acting in the real, unpredictably changing world has led many AI researchers to shift from a planned, centralised symbolic architecture to studying intelligence as an emergent product of simple interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1109/JRA.1986.1087032 |title=A robust layered control system for a mobile robot |year=1986 |last1=Brooks |first1=R. |journal=IEEE Journal on Robotics and Automation |volume=2 |pages=14|url=http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA160833 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This thus reflects a general shift from applying a centralised system in robotics to applying a more decentralised system based on local interactions at various levels of abstraction.

For example, largely stemming from [[Allen Newell|Newell]] and [[Herbert A. Simon|Simon's]] [[physical symbol system|physical-symbol theory]], researchers in the 1970s designed robots with a course of action that, when executed, would result in the achievement of some desired goal; thus the robots were seen as "intelligent" if they could follow the directions of their central controller (the program or the programmer) (for an example, see [[STRIPS]]). However, upon Rodney Brooks' introduction of [[subsumption architecture]], which enabled robots to perform "intelligent" behaviour without using symbolic knowledge or explicit reasoning, increasingly more researchers have viewed intelligent behaviour as an emergent property that arises from an agent's interaction with the environment, including other agents in that environment.

While certain researchers have begun to design their robots with closely coupled perception and action systems and attempted to [[embodied agent|embody]] and [[situated cognition|situate]] their agents a la Brooks, other researchers have attempted to simulate multi-agent behaviour and thus further dissect the phenomena of decentralised systems in achieving global goals. For example, in 1996, Minar, Burkhard, Lang-ton and Askenazi created a multi-agent software platform for the stimulation of interacting agents and their emergent collective behaviour called "[[Swarm (simulation)|Swarm]]". While the basic unit in Swarm is the "swarm", a collection of agents executing a schedule of actions, agents can be composed of swarms of other agents in nested structures. As the software also provides object-oriented libraries of reusable components for building models and analyzing, displaying and controlling experiments on those models, it ultimately attempts to not only simulate multi-agent behaviour but to serve as a basis for further exploration of how collective groups of agents can achieve global goals through careful, yet implicit, coordination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Minar |first1=N. |last2=Burkhart |first2=R. |last3=Langton |first3=C. |last4=Askenazi |first4=M. |year=1996 |url=http://www.santafe.edu/research/working-papers/abstract/70e0c84b2cff6e8e87f2940fa60965e9/ |title=The Swarm Simulation System: A Toolkit for Building Multi-Agent Simulations |work=SFI Working Papers |publisher=Sante Fe Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Fight Club''''' is a 1999 &lt;!--discuss on talk page BEFORE adding genres here --&gt;film based on the [[Fight Club (novel)|1996 novel]] by [[Chuck Palahniuk]]. It was directed by [[David Fincher]] and stars [[Brad Pitt]], [[Edward Norton]], and [[Helena Bonham Carter]]. Norton plays [[The Narrator (Fight Club)|the unnamed narrator]], who is discontent with his white-collar job. He forms a "fight club" with soap salesman Tyler Durden (Pitt), and becomes embroiled in a relationship with him and a destitute woman, Marla Singer (Bonham Carter).

Palahniuk's novel was [[Option (filmmaking)|optioned]] by [[20th Century Fox]] producer [[Laura Ziskin]], who hired [[Jim Uhls]] to write the film adaptation. Fincher was selected because of his enthusiasm for the story. He developed the script with Uhls and sought screenwriting advice from the cast and others in the film industry. He and the cast compared the film to ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'' (1955) and ''[[The Graduate]]'' (1967), with a theme of conflict between [[Generation X]] and the [[value (ethics)#Value system|value system]] of advertising.&lt;ref name=CNN1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=Laist/&gt; Fincher used the [[homoeroticism|homoerotic]] overtones of Palahniuk's novel to make audiences uncomfortable and keep them from anticipating the [[twist ending]].&lt;ref name="fiction" /&gt;

Studio executives did not like the film and restructured Fincher's marketing campaign to try to reduce anticipated losses. ''Fight Club'' failed to meet the studio's expectations at the box office and received polarized reviews, becoming one of the most controversial and talked-about films of the year. Critics praised the acting, directing, and themes, but debated the violence and [[moral ambiguity]]. Over time, however, critical and public reception towards the film has become largely positive, and the film found success with its DVD release, which established ''Fight Club'' as a [[cult film]]. Many have called ''Fight Club'' one of the greatest films of all time.&lt;ref name=empiremag/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/pictures/readers-poll-the-25-best-movies-of-the-1990s-20140430 |title=Reader's Poll: The 25 Best Movies of the 1990s |publisher=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=April 18, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170419104049/http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/pictures/readers-poll-the-25-best-movies-of-the-1990s-20140430 |archivedate=April 19, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/1990s-best-movies-of-nineties-trivia-90s/?view=all |title=20 Best Movies of the 1990s |publisher=[[Screen Rant]] |accessdate=April 18, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170419103201/http://screenrant.com/1990s-best-movies-of-nineties-trivia-90s/?view=all |archivedate=April 19, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.generationfilm.net/2009/06/12/top-10-most-influential-movies-of-the-90s/amp/ |title=The 10 Most Influential Films of the 90s |publisher=Generation Film |accessdate=April 18, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170419102631/https://generationfilm.net/2009/06/12/top-10-most-influential-movies-of-the-90s/amp/ |archivedate=April 19, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the word count in this section should be 400-700 words. --&gt;
The unnamed [[The Narrator (Fight Club)|Narrator]] is an automobile [[Product recall|recall]] specialist who is unfulfilled by his job and possessions, and has developed severe [[Insomnia]]. He finds catharsis by posing as a sufferer of [[testicular cancer]] and other afflictions in [[support group]]s, helping his insomnia. His bliss is disturbed by another impostor, Marla Singer, whose presence reminds him he is attending these groups dishonestly. The two agree to split which groups they attend, but not before Marla gives him her number.

On a flight home from a business trip, the Narrator meets and interacts with soap salesman Tyler Durden. The Narrator returns home to find that his apartment has been destroyed by an explosion. Deciding against asking Marla for help, he calls Tyler, and they meet at a bar. Tyler says the Narrator is beholden to [[consumerism]]. In the parking lot, he asks the Narrator to hit him, and they begin a fistfight.

The Narrator moves into Tyler's home: a large, dilapidated house in an industrial area. They have further fights outside the bar, which attract growing crowds of men. The fights moves to the bar's basement where the men form Fight Club, which routinely meets for the men to fight recreationally.

Marla overdoses on pills and telephones the Narrator for help; he ignores her, but Tyler goes to her apartment to save her. Tyler and Marla get romantically involved, and Tyler warns the Narrator never to talk to Marla about him. The Narrator blackmails his boss and quits his job.

Fight clubs form across the country. Tyler recruits their members to a new anti-[[economic materialism|materialist]] and [[anti-corporate]] organization, Project Mayhem, without the Narrator's involvement. The group engages in subversive acts of vandalism and violence, increasingly troubling the Narrator. After the Narrator complains that Tyler has excluded him, Tyler leaves the house. The Narrator realizes that Tyler caused the explosion at his apartment.

When a member of Project Mayhem is killed by the police during a botched sabotage operation, the Narrator tries to halt the project. He follows a paper trail to cities Tyler has visited to find him. In one city, a Project Mayhem member greets the Narrator as Tyler Durden. The Narrator calls Marla and discovers that she also believes he is Tyler. Tyler then appears in his hotel room and reveals that they are [[Dissociative identity disorder|dissociated personalities]] in the same body; the Narrator became Tyler when he believed he was sleeping.

The Narrator blacks out. When he returns to the house, he uncovers Tyler's plans to erase debt by destroying buildings that contain credit card records. He apologizes to Marla and warns her that she is in danger, but she is tired of his contradictory behavior. He tries to warn the police, but the officers are members of the Project. He attempts to disarm the explosives in one building, but Tyler subdues him and holds him at gunpoint on the top floor. The Narrator realizes that, as he and Tyler are the same person, he is holding the gun. He fires it into his own mouth, shooting through his cheek, and Tyler collapses with an exit wound on his head and disappears. Project Mayhem members bring a kidnapped Marla to the building. Holding hands, the Narrator and Marla watch as the explosives detonate, collapsing buildings around them.

{{quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote=We're designed to be hunters and we're in a society of shopping. There's nothing to kill anymore, there's nothing to fight, nothing to overcome, nothing to explore. In that societal emasculation this everyman [the Narrator] is created.|source=—David Fincher&lt;ref name="smith64" /&gt;}}
Director [[David Fincher]] said ''Fight Club'' is a [[coming of age]] film, like the 1967 film ''[[The Graduate]]'' but for people in their 30s. Fincher described the Narrator as an "[[everyman]]";&lt;ref name="smith64"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1999|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; the character is identified in the script as "Jack", but left unnamed in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = 100 DVDs You Must Own | page = 31 |magazine=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] |date=January 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fincher outlined the Narrator's background: "He's tried to do everything he was taught to do, tried to fit into the world by becoming the thing he isn't." He cannot find happiness, so he travels on a path to enlightenment in which he must "kill" his parents, god, and teacher. By the start of the film, he has "killed off" his parents. With Tyler Durden, he kills his god by doing things they are not supposed to do. To complete the process of maturing, the Narrator has to kill his teacher, Tyler Durden.&lt;ref name="smith60"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1999|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character is a 1990s inverse of the ''Graduate'' archetype: "a guy who does ''not'' have a world of possibilities in front of him, he has ''no'' possibilities, he literally cannot imagine a way to change his life." He is confused and angry, so he responds to his environment by creating Tyler Durden, a [[Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzschean]] ''[[Übermensch]]'', in his mind. While Tyler is who the Narrator wants to be, he is not empathetic and does not help the Narrator face decisions in his life "that are complicated and have moral and ethical implications". Fincher explained: "[Tyler] can deal with the concepts of our lives in an idealistic fashion, but it doesn't have anything to do with the compromises of real life as modern man knows it. Which is: you're not really necessary to a lot of what's going on. It's built, it just needs to run now."&lt;ref name="smith64" /&gt; While studio executives worried that ''Fight Club'' was going to be "sinister and seditious", Fincher sought to make it "funny and seditious" by including humor to temper the sinister element.&lt;ref name="empire" /&gt;

Screenwriter [[Jim Uhls]] described the film as a [[romantic comedy]], explaining: "It has to do with the characters' attitudes toward a healthy relationship, which is a lot of behavior which ''seems'' unhealthy and harsh to each other, but in fact does work for them—because both characters are out on the edge psychologically."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Sragow |url=http://www.salon.com/ent/col/srag/1999/10/14/fincher/index1.html |title=Testosterama |work=[[Salon.com]] |date=October 14, 1999 |accessdate=December 2, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209021705/http://www.salon.com/ent/col/srag/1999/10/14/fincher/index1.html |archivedate=December 9, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Narrator seeks intimacy, but avoids it with Marla Singer, seeing too much of himself in her.&lt;ref name="DVDcom" /&gt; While Marla is a seductive and negativist prospect for the Narrator, he embraces the novelty and excitement that comes with befriending Tyler.

''Fight Club'' also parallels the 1955 film ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]''; both probe the frustrations of the people in the system.&lt;ref name="showbiz" /&gt;  The characters, having undergone societal [[emasculation]], are reduced to "a generation of spectators".&lt;ref name="calgary"&gt;{{cite news | first=Louis B. | last=Hobson | url= | title=Get ready to rumble | work=[[Calgary Sun]] | date=October 10, 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A culture of advertising defines society's "external signifiers of happiness", causing an unnecessary chase for material goods that replaces the more essential pursuit of spiritual happiness. The film references consumer products such as [[Gucci]], [[Calvin Klein]], and the [[Volkswagen New Beetle]].

We're so concerned with failure and success—like these two things are all that's going to sum you up at the end."&lt;ref name="tribune" /&gt;

==Production==

===Development===
The novel ''[[Fight Club (novel)|Fight Club]]'' by [[Chuck Palahniuk]] was published in 1996. Before its publication, a [[20th Century Fox]] book scout sent a [[galley proof]] of the novel to creative executive Kevin McCormick. The executive assigned a studio reader to review the proof as a candidate for a film adaptation, but the reader discouraged it. McCormick then forwarded the proof to producers [[Lawrence Bender]] and [[Art Linson]], who also rejected it. Producers Josh Donen and Ross Bell saw potential and expressed interest. They arranged unpaid screen readings with actors to determine the script's length, and an initial reading lasted six hours. The producers cut out sections to reduce the running time, and they used the shorter script to record its dialogue. Bell sent the recording to [[Laura Ziskin]], head of the division [[Fox 2000]], who listened to the tape and purchased the rights to ''Fight Club'' from Palahniuk for $10,000.&lt;ref name="mav1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Waxman|2005|pp=137–151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ziskin initially considered hiring [[Buck Henry]] to write the adaptation, finding ''Fight Club'' similar to the 1967 film ''[[The Graduate]]'', which Henry had adapted. When a new screenwriter, [[Jim Uhls]], lobbied Donen and Bell for the job, the producers chose him over Henry. Bell contacted four directors to direct the film. He considered [[Peter Jackson]] the best choice, but Jackson was too busy filming the 1996 film ''[[The Frighteners]]'' in New Zealand. [[Bryan Singer]] received the book but did not read it. [[Danny Boyle]] met with Bell and read the book, but he pursued another film. [[David Fincher]], who had read ''Fight Club'' and had tried to buy the rights himself, talked with Ziskin about directing the film. He hesitated to accept the assignment with 20th Century Fox at first because he had an unpleasant experience directing the 1992 film ''[[Alien 3]]'' for the studio. To repair his relationship with the studio, he met with Ziskin and studio head [[Bill Mechanic]].&lt;ref name="mav1" /&gt; In August 1997, 20th Century Fox announced that Fincher would direct the film adaptation of ''Fight Club''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Michael |last=Fleming |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1116678264.html?categoryid=3&amp;cs=1 |title=Thornton holds reins of 'Horses' |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=August 19, 1997 |accessdate=March 23, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011203539/http://variety.com/article/VR1116678264.html?categoryid=3&amp;cs=1 |archivedate=October 11, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casting===

Producer Ross Bell met with actor [[Russell Crowe]] to discuss his candidacy for the role of Tyler Durden. Producer Art Linson, who joined the project late, met with Pitt regarding the same role. Linson was the senior producer of the two, so the studio sought to cast Pitt instead of Crowe.&lt;ref name= mav1 /&gt; Pitt was looking for a new film after the failure (in the US market) of his 1998 film ''[[Meet Joe Black]]'', and the studio believed ''Fight Club'' would be more commercially successful with a major star. The studio signed Pitt for US$17.5&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name= mav2 /&gt;

For the role of the unnamed Narrator, the studio desired a "sexier marquee name" such as [[Matt Damon]] to increase the film's commercial prospects; it also considered [[Sean Penn]]. Fincher instead considered Norton based on his performance in the 1996 film ''[[The People vs. Larry Flynt]]''.&lt;ref name="vanity"&gt;{{cite magazine | first=Peter | last=Biskind | url= | title=Extreme Norton |magazine=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |date=August 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studios were approaching Norton for leading roles in developing films like ''[[The Talented Mr. Ripley (film)|The Talented Mr. Ripley]]'' and ''[[Man on the Moon (film)|Man on the Moon]]''. He was cast in ''[[Runaway Jury]]'', but the film did not reach production. 20th Century Fox offered Norton $2.5&amp;nbsp;million for ''Fight Club''. He could not accept the offer immediately because he still owed [[Paramount Pictures]] a film; he had signed a contractual obligation with Paramount to appear in one of the studio's future films for a smaller salary. Norton later satisfied the obligation with his role in the 2003 film ''[[The Italian Job (2003 film)|The Italian Job]]''.&lt;ref name= mav2 /&gt;

In January 1998, 20th Century Fox announced that Pitt and Norton had been cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Chris |last=Petrikin |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117434297.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 |title=Studio Report Card: Fox |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=January 7, 1998 |accessdate=March 23, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011191741/http://variety.com/article/VR1117434297.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 |archivedate=October 11, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The actors prepared by taking lessons in [[boxing]], [[taekwondo]], [[grappling]],&lt;ref name="details"&gt;{{cite magazine | first=Stephen | last=Garrett | url= | title=Freeze Frame |magazine=[[Details (magazine)|Details]] |date=July 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[soapmaking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | first=Johanna | last=Schneller | url= | title=Brad Pitt and Edward Norton make 'Fight Club' |magazine=[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]] |date=August 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pitt voluntarily visited a dentist to have pieces of his front teeth chipped off so his character would not have perfect teeth.

Fincher's first choice for the role of Marla Singer was [[Janeane Garofalo]], who objected to the film's sexual content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Story Behind Fight Club |work=Total Film |url=http://www.totalfilm.com/features/the-story-behind-fight-club |quote=The studio wanted Winona Ryder.

===Writing===
Uhls started working on a draft of the adapted screenplay, which excluded a [[voice-over]] because the industry perceived at the time that the technique was "hackneyed and trite". When Fincher joined the film, he thought that the film should have a voice-over, believing that the film's humor came from the Narrator's voice.&lt;ref name="mav2"&gt;{{harvnb|Waxman|2005|pp=175–184}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described the film without a voice-over as seemingly "sad and pathetic".&lt;ref name="smith61"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1999|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fincher and Uhls revised the script for six to seven months and by 1997 had a third draft that reordered the story and left out several major elements. When Pitt was cast, he was concerned that his character, Tyler Durden, was too one-dimensional. Fincher sought the advice of writer-director [[Cameron Crowe]], who suggested giving the character more ambiguity. Fincher also hired screenwriter [[Andrew Kevin Walker]] for assistance. He invited Pitt and Norton to help revise the script, and the group drafted five revisions in the course of a year.&lt;ref name="mav2" /&gt;

Palahniuk praised the faithful film adaptation of his novel and applauded how the film's plot was more streamlined than the book's. Palahniuk recalled how the writers debated if film audiences would believe the plot twist from the novel. Fincher supported including the twist, arguing, "If they accept everything up to this point, they'll accept the plot twist. If they're still in the theater, they'll stay with it."&lt;ref name="dvdtalk"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kleinman |first=Geoffrey |url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/interviews/chuck_palahniuk.html |title=Interview With Fight Club Author Chuck Palahniuk |work=DVD Talk |accessdate=March 23, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123071414/http://www.dvdtalk.com/interviews/chuck_palahniuk.html |archivedate=January 23, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Palahniuk's novel also contained [[homoeroticism|homoerotic]] overtones, which Fincher included in the film to make audiences uncomfortable and accentuate the surprise of the twists.&lt;ref name="fiction"&gt;{{cite news | first=Louis B. | last=Hobson | url= | title=Fiction for real | work=[[Calgary Sun]] | date=October 10, 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bathroom scene where Tyler Durden bathes next to the Narrator is an example of the overtones; the line, "I'm wondering if another woman is really the answer we need," was meant to suggest personal responsibility rather than homosexuality.&lt;ref name="DVDcom" /&gt; Another example is the scene at the beginning of the film in which Tyler Durden puts a gun barrel down the Narrator's mouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Stephen | last=Schaefer | url=http://mrshowbiz.go.com/news/Todays_Stories/991013/fightclubauthor101399.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010416022913/http://mrshowbiz.go.com/news/Todays_Stories/991013/fightclubauthor101399.html | title=Fight Club's Controversial Cut | work=MrShowbiz.com | publisher=ABC News Internet Ventures | archivedate=April 16, 2001 | date=October 13, 1999 | accessdate=December 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Narrator finds redemption at the end of the film by rejecting Tyler Durden's dialectic, a path that diverged from the novel's ending in which the Narrator is placed in a mental institution.&lt;ref name="empire"&gt;{{cite magazine | first=Damon | last=Wise | url= | title=Menace II Society |magazine=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] |date=December 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Norton drew parallels between redemption in the film and redemption in ''The Graduate'', indicating that the protagonists of both films find a middle ground between two divisions of self.&lt;ref name="reel"&gt;{{cite news|first=Barbara |last=Teasdall |url=http://www.reel.com/reel.asp?node=features/interviews/norton |title=Edward Norton Fights His Way to the Top |work=Reel.com |publisher=[[Movie Gallery]] |year=1999 |accessdate=March 24, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011095947/http://reel.com/reel.asp?node=features%2Finterviews%2Fnorton |archivedate=October 11, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fincher considered the novel too infatuated with Tyler Durden and changed the ending to move away from him: "I wanted people to love Tyler, but I also wanted them to be OK with his vanquishing."&lt;ref name="empire" /&gt;

===Filming===
Studio executives Mechanic and Ziskin planned an initial budget of US$23&amp;nbsp;million to finance the film,&lt;ref name="mav1" /&gt; but by the start of production, the budget was increased to $50&amp;nbsp;million. Half was paid by [[New Regency]], but during filming, the projected budget escalated to US$67&amp;nbsp;million. New Regency's head and ''Fight Club'' executive producer [[Arnon Milchan]] petitioned Fincher to reduce costs by at least US$5&amp;nbsp;million. Fincher refused, so Milchan threatened Mechanic that New Regency would withdraw financing. Mechanic sought to restore Milchan's support by sending him tapes of [[dailies]] from ''Fight Club''. After seeing three weeks of filming, Milchan reinstated New Regency's financial backing.&lt;ref name="mav3"&gt;{{harvnb|Waxman|2005|pp=199–202}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final production budget was $63&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="mojo" /&gt;

The [[stage combat|fight scenes]] were heavily choreographed, but the actors were required to "go full out" to capture realistic effects such as having the wind knocked out of them.&lt;ref name=tribune&gt;{{cite news | url= | title='Club' fighting for a respectful place in life | work=[[Post-Tribune]] | date=March 15, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Makeup artist Julie Pearce, who had worked for Fincher on the 1997 film ''[[The Game (1997 film)|The Game]]'', studied [[mixed martial arts]] and [[pay-per-view]] boxing to portray the fighters accurately. She designed an extra's ear to have cartilage missing, inspired by [[Evander Holyfield vs. Mike Tyson II|the boxing match]] in which [[Mike Tyson]] bit off part of [[Evander Holyfield]]'s ear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url= | title=It Bruiser: Julie Pearce | journal=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | date=July 25, 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Makeup artists devised two methods to create sweat on cue: spraying mineral water over a coat of [[Vaseline]], and using the unadulterated water for "wet sweat". [[Meat Loaf]], who plays a fight club member who has "[[gynecomastia|bitch tits]]", wore a 90-pound (40&amp;nbsp;kg) fat harness that gave him large breasts.&lt;ref name="details" /&gt; He also wore eight-inch (20&amp;nbsp;cm) [[elevator shoes|lifts]] in his scenes with Norton to be taller than him.&lt;ref name="DVDcom"&gt;''Fight Club'' DVD commentary featuring David Fincher, Brad Pitt, Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter, [2000], 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt;

The locations were in and around [[Los Angeles]] and on sets built at the studio in [[Century City]].&lt;ref name="anarchy"&gt;{{Harvnb|Probst|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production designer Alex McDowell constructed more than 70 sets.&lt;ref name="details" /&gt;  The exterior of Tyler Durden's house was built in [[San Pedro, California]], while the interior was built on a sound stage at the studio's location.  The interior was given a decayed look to illustrate the deconstructed world of the characters.&lt;ref name="anarchy" /&gt;  Marla Singer's apartment was based on photographs of the Rosalind Apartments in downtown LA.&lt;ref name="comment65" /&gt;  Overall production included 300 scenes, 200 locations, and [[#Visual effects|complex special effects]].  Fincher compared ''Fight Club'' to his succeeding and less complex film ''[[Panic Room (film)|Panic Room]]'', "I felt like I was spending all my time watching trucks being loaded and unloaded so I could shoot three lines of dialogue. There was far too much transportation going on."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Colin | last=Covert | url= | title=Fear factor is Fincher's forte | work=[[Star Tribune]] | date=March 29, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cinematography===
Fincher used the [[Super 35]] format to film ''Fight Club'' since it gave him maximum flexibility to compose shots. He hired [[Jeff Cronenweth]] as cinematographer; Cronenweth's father [[Jordan Cronenweth]] had been cinematographer for Fincher's 1992 film ''[[Alien 3]],'' but left midway through production due to [[Parkinson's disease]]. Fincher explored visual styles in his previous films ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]'' and ''The Game'', and he and Cronenweth drew elements from these styles for ''Fight Club''.&lt;ref name="anarchy" /&gt;

Fincher and Cronenweth applied a lurid style, choosing to make people "sort of shiny".&lt;ref name="comment65" /&gt; The appearance of the Narrator's scenes without Tyler were bland and realistic. The scenes with Tyler were described by Fincher as "more hyper-real in a torn-down, deconstructed sense—a visual metaphor of what [the Narrator is] heading into". The filmmakers used heavily desaturated colors in the costuming, makeup, and art direction.&lt;ref name="anarchy" /&gt; Bonham Carter wore opalescent makeup to portray her romantic nihilistic character with a "[[Heroin|smack]]-fiend [[patina]]". Fincher and Cronenweth drew influences from the 1973 film ''[[American Graffiti]]'', which applied a mundane look to nighttime exteriors while simultaneously including a variety of colors.&lt;ref name="comment65" /&gt;

The crew took advantage of both natural and practical light. Fincher sought various approaches to the lighting setups; for example, he chose several urban locations for the city lights' effects on the shots' backgrounds. The crew also embraced fluorescent lighting at other practical locations to maintain an element of reality and to light the prostheses depicting the characters' injuries.&lt;ref name="anarchy" /&gt; On the other hand, Fincher also ensured that scenes were not so strongly lit so the characters' eyes were less visible, citing cinematographer [[Gordon Willis]]' technique as the influence.&lt;ref name="DVDcom" /&gt;

''Fight Club'' was filmed mostly at night, and Fincher filmed the daytime shots in shadowed locations. The crew equipped the bar's basement with inexpensive work lamps to create a background glow. Fincher avoided stylish camerawork when filming early fight scenes in the basement and instead placed the camera in a fixed position. In later fight scenes, Fincher moved the camera from the viewpoint of a distant observer to that of the fighter.&lt;ref name="anarchy" /&gt;

The scenes with Tyler were staged to conceal that the character was a mental projection of the unnamed Narrator. Tyler was not filmed in [[two shot]]s with a group of people, nor was he shown in any [[over the shoulder shot|over-the-shoulder shot]]s in scenes where Tyler gives the Narrator specific ideas to manipulate him. In scenes before the Narrator meets Tyler, the filmmakers inserted Tyler's presence in single frames for [[subliminal message|subliminal effect]].&lt;ref name="comment65" /&gt; Tyler appears in the background and out of focus, like a "little devil on the shoulder".&lt;ref name="DVDcom" /&gt; Fincher explained the subliminal frames: "Our hero is creating Tyler Durden in his own mind, so at this point he exists only on the periphery of the Narrator's consciousness."&lt;ref name="cinefex" /&gt;

While Cronenweth generally rated and exposed the Kodak [[film stock]] normally on ''Fight Club'', several other techniques were applied to change its appearance. [[Flashing (cinematography)|Flashing]] was implemented on much of the exterior night photography, the [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] was stretched to be purposely ugly, the print was adjusted to be [[exposure (photography)|underexposed]], [[Technicolor]]'s ENR [[bleach bypass|silver retention]] was used on a select number of prints to increase the [[optical density|density]] of the blacks, and high-contrast print stocks were chosen to create a "stepped-on" look on the print with a dirty patina.&lt;ref name="comment65" /&gt;

===Visual effects===
Fincher hired [[visual effects supervisor]] [[Kevin Tod Haug]], who worked for him on ''The Game'', to create visual effects for ''Fight Club''. Haug assigned the visual effects artists and experts to different facilities that each addressed different types of visual effects: CG modeling, animation, compositing, and scanning. Haug explained, "We selected the best people for each aspect of the effects work, then coordinated their efforts. In this way, we never had to play to a facility's weakness." Fincher visualized the Narrator's perspective through a "[[mind's eye]]" view and structured a [[myopia|myopic]] framework for the film audiences. Fincher also used [[previsualization|previsualized]] footage of challenging main-unit and visual effects shots as a problem-solving tool to avoid making mistakes during the actual filming.&lt;ref name="cinefex"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Kevin H. |last=Martin |title=A World of Hurt |journal=[[Cinefex]] |date=January 2000 |url=http://www.edward-norton.org/fc/articles/worldofhurt.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040227070738/http://www.edward-norton.org/fc/articles/worldofhurt.html |archivedate=2004-02-27 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The network was mapped using an [[L-system]] and drawn out by a medical illustrator.]]
The film's title sequence is a 90-second visual effects composition that depicts the inside of the Narrator's brain at a microscopic level; the camera pulls back to the outside, starting at his fear center and following the thought processes initiated by his fear impulse.&lt;ref name="comment61–62"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1999|pp=61–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sequence, designed in part by Fincher, was budgeted separately from the rest of the film at first, but the sequence was awarded by the studio in January 1999.&lt;ref name="cinefex" /&gt; Fincher hired [[Digital Domain]] and its visual effects supervisor [[Kevin Mack (visual effects artist)|Kevin Mack]], who won an [[Academy Award for Visual Effects]] for the 1998 film ''[[What Dreams May Come (film)|What Dreams May Come]]'', for the sequence. The company mapped the computer-generated brain using an [[L-system]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | first=Mark | last=Frauenfelder | authorlink=Mark Frauenfelder | url= | title=Hollywood's Head Case |magazine=[[Wired magazine|Wired]] |date=August 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the design was detailed using renderings by medical illustrator Katherine Jones. The pullback sequence from within the brain to the outside of the skull included [[neuron]]s, [[action potential]]s, and a [[hair follicle]]. Haug explained the artistic license that Fincher took with the shot, "While he wanted to keep the brain passage looking like [[electron microscopy|electron microscope photography]], that look had to be coupled with the feel of a night dive—wet, scary, and with a low depth of field." The shallow [[depth of field]] was accomplished with the [[ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]] process.&lt;ref name="cinefex" /&gt;

Other visual effects include an early scene in which the camera flashes past city streets to survey Project Mayhem's destructive equipment lying in underground parking lots; the sequence was a three-dimensional composition of nearly 100&amp;nbsp;photographs of Los Angeles and [[Century City]] by photographer Michael Douglas Middleton. The final scene of the demolition of the credit card office buildings was designed by Richard Baily of Image Savant; Baily worked on the scene for over fourteen&amp;nbsp;months.&lt;ref name="cinefex" /&gt;

Midway through the film, Tyler Durden points out the [[cue mark]]—nicknamed "cigarette burn" in the film—to the audience. The scene represents a turning point that foreshadows the coming rupture and inversion of the "fairly subjective reality" that existed earlier in the film. Fincher explained: "Suddenly it's as though the projectionist missed the changeover, the viewers have to start looking at the movie in a whole new way."&lt;ref name="cinefex" /&gt;

===Score===
Fincher was concerned that bands experienced in writing [[film score]]s would be unable to tie the movie's themes together, so he sought a band which had never recorded for film. He pursued [[Radiohead]],&lt;ref name="DVDcom" /&gt; but singer [[Thom Yorke]] declined as he was recovering from the stress of promoting their album ''[[OK Computer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/thom-yorke-nearly-wrote-soundtrack-fight-club-2386137|title=Thom Yorke on how he nearly wrote the soundtrack for ''Fight Club''|last=Trendell|first=Andrew|date=3 October 2018|work=[[NME]]|access-date=4 October 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fincher instead commissioned the [[breakbeat]] producing duo [[Dust Brothers]], who created a post-modern score encompassing drum loops, electronic scratches, and computerized samples. Dust Brothers performer [[Michael Simpson (producer)|Michael Simpson]] explained the setup: "Fincher wanted to break new ground with everything about the movie, and a nontraditional score helped achieve that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Amanda | last=Schurr | url= | title=Score one for musicians turned film composers | work=[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]] | date=November 19, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's climax and end credits feature the song "[[Where Is My Mind?]]" by the [[Pixies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | last=Spitz | first=Marc |date=September 2004 | title=Life to the Pixies |magazine=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] | page=77 }} "[Kim] Deal: I think [that last scene in] ''Fight Club'' got 'Where Is My Mind?' popular.

===Marketing===
Filming concluded in December 1998, and Fincher edited the footage in early 1999 to prepare ''Fight Club'' for a screening with senior executives. They did not receive the film positively and were concerned that there would not be an audience for the film.&lt;ref name="mav4"&gt;{{harvnb|Waxman|2005|pp=253–273}}&lt;/ref&gt; Executive producer [[Art Linson]], who supported the film, recalled the response: "So many incidences of ''Fight Club'' were alarming, no group of executives could narrow them down."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Linson|2002|p=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, ''Fight Club'' was originally slated to be released in July 1999&lt;ref name="blood"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Benjamin |last=Svetkey |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,271117,00.html |title=Blood, Sweat, and Fears |journal=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=October 15, 1999 |accessdate=April 30, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080519221626/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C271117%2C00.html |archivedate=May 19, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but was later changed to August&amp;nbsp;6, 1999. The studio further delayed the film's release, this time to autumn, citing a crowded summer schedule and a hurried post-production process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Leonard |last=Klady |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117503196.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 |title=Fox holds the 'Fight' to fall |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=June 17, 1999 |accessdate=March 23, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012002014/http://variety.com/article/VR1117503196.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 |archivedate=October 12, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Outsiders attributed the delays to the [[Columbine High School massacre]] earlier in the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Christopher | last=Goodwin | url= | title=The malaise of the American male |work=The Sunday Times |location=UK | date=September 19, 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marketing executives at 20th Century Fox faced difficulties in marketing ''Fight Club'' and at one point considered marketing it as an [[art film]]. They considered that the film was primarily geared toward male audiences because of its violence and believed that not even Pitt would attract female filmgoers. Research testing showed that the film appealed to teenagers. Fincher refused to let the posters and trailers focus on Pitt and encouraged the studio to hire the advertising firm [[Wieden+Kennedy]] to devise a marketing plan. The firm proposed a bar of pink soap with the title "Fight Club" embossed on it as the film's main marketing image; the proposal was considered "a bad joke" by Fox executives. Fincher also released two early trailers in the form of fake [[public service announcement]]s presented by Pitt and Norton; the studio did not think the trailers marketed the film appropriately. Instead, the studio financed a $20&amp;nbsp;million large-scale campaign to provide a press junket, posters, billboards, and trailers for TV that highlighted the film's fight scenes. The studio advertised ''Fight Club'' on cable during [[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]] broadcasts, which Fincher protested, believing that the placement created the wrong context for the film.&lt;ref name="mav4" /&gt; Linson believed that the "ill-conceived one-dimensional" marketing by marketing executive Robert Harper largely contributed to ''Fight Club''{{'}}s lukewarm box office performance in the United States.&lt;ref name="what"&gt;{{harvnb|Linson|2002|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[British Board of Film Classification]] reviewed ''Fight Club'' for its November&amp;nbsp;12, 1999 release in the United Kingdom and removed two scenes involving "an indulgence in the excitement of beating a (defenseless) man's face into a pulp". The board assigned the film an 18 certificate, limiting the release to adult-only audiences in the UK. The BBFC did not censor any further, considering and dismissing claims that ''Fight Club'' contained "dangerously instructive information" and could "encourage anti-social (behavior)". The board decided, "The film as a whole is—quite clearly—critical and sharply parodic of the amateur fascism which in part it portrays. Its central theme of male machismo (and the [[anti-social behaviour]] that flows from it) is emphatically rejected by the central character in the concluding reels."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Adam |last=Dawtrey |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117757863.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 |title=UK to cut 'Club' |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=November 9, 1999 |accessdate=March 23, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012002022/http://variety.com/article/VR1117757863.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 |archivedate=October 12, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The scenes were restored in a two-disc DVD edition released in the UK in March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Philip |last=French |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/mar/04/3 |title=Fight Club |work=The Observer |location=UK |date=March 4, 2007 |accessdate=March 30, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141002232826/http://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/mar/04/3 |archivedate=October 2, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Julie Markell, 20th Century Fox's senior vice president of creative development, said the DVD packaging complemented Fincher's vision: "The film is meant to make you question. The package, by extension, tries to reflect an experience that you must experience for yourself. The more you look at it, the more you'll get out of it."

The title "Fight Club" was labeled diagonally across the front, and packaging appeared tied with twine. Markell said, "We wanted the package to be simple on the outside, so that there would be a dichotomy between the simplicity of brown paper wrapping and the intensity and chaos of what's inside."&lt;ref name=package/&gt; Deborah Mitchell, 20th Century Fox's vice president of marketing, described the design: "From a retail standpoint, [the DVD case] has incredible shelf-presence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Wendy | last=Wilson | title=Fox's ''Fight Club'' delivers knockout package, promo | journal=Video Business | date=June 12, 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
When ''Fight Club'' premiered at the [[56th Venice International Film Festival]], the film was fiercely debated by critics. A newspaper reported, "Many loved and hated it in equal measures." Some critics expressed concern that the film would incite copycat behavior, such as that seen after ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' debuted in Britain nearly three decades previously.&lt;ref name="slugging"&gt;{{cite news | first=David | last=Gritten | title=Premiere of ''Fight Club'' leaves critics slugging it out in Venice |work=The Ottawa Citizen | date=September 14, 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the film's theatrical release, ''[[The Times]]'' reported the reaction: "It touched a nerve in the male psyche that was debated in newspapers across the world."&lt;ref name="how"&gt;{{cite news | first=James | last=Christopher | url= | title=How was it for you? |work=The Times |location=UK | date=September 13, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the film's makers called ''Fight Club'' "an accurate portrayal of men in the 1990s," some critics called it "irresponsible and appalling". Writing for the ''Australian'' newspaper, Christopher Goodwin stated: "''Fight Club'' is shaping up to be the most contentious mainstream Hollywood meditation on violence since [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''A Clockwork Orange''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Christopher | last=Goodwin | title=The beaten generation |work=The Australian | date=September 24, 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Janet Maslin]], reviewing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', praised Fincher's direction and editing of the film. She wrote that ''Fight Club'' carried a message of "contemporary manhood", and that, if not watched closely, the film could be misconstrued as an endorsement of violence and [[nihilism]].&lt;ref name="maslin"&gt;{{cite news|first=Janet |last=Maslin |authorlink=Janet Maslin |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/15/movies/film-review-such-a-very-long-way-from-duvets-to-danger.html |title=Film Review; Such a Very Long Way From Duvets to Danger |work=The New York Times |date=October 15, 1999 |accessdate=April 30, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100307015217/http://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/15/movies/film-review-such-a-very-long-way-from-duvets-to-danger.html |archivedate=March 7, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]], reviewing for the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', called ''Fight Club'' "visceral and hard-edged", but also "a thrill ride masquerading as philosophy", whose promising first act is followed by a second that panders to macho sensibilities and a third he dismissed as "trickery".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Roger |last=Ebert |authorlink=Roger Ebert |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19991015/REVIEWS/910150302/1023 |title=Fight Club |work=Chicago Sun-Times |date=October 15, 1999 |accessdate=March 23, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405103509/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19991015%2FREVIEWS%2F910150302%2F1023 |archivedate=April 5, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ebert later acknowledged that the film was "beloved by most, not by me".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Roger |last=Ebert |authorlink=Roger Ebert |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070823/REVIEWS/708230308/-1/REVIEWS01 |title=Zodiac |work=Chicago Sun-Times |date=August 24, 2007 |accessdate=April 30, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522094413/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20070823%2FREVIEWS%2F708230308%2F-1%2FREVIEWS01 |archivedate=May 22, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later requested to have a shot-by-shot analysis of ''Fight Club'' at the [[Conference on World Affairs]]; he stated that "[s]eeing it over the course of a week, I admired its skill even more, and its thought even less."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ebert |first1=Roger |title=The Great Movies |date=2003 |publisher=Broadway Books |isbn=978-0767910385 |page=xvi |edition=Reprint |url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Great-Movies-Roger-Ebert/dp/0767910389 |accessdate=6 January 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160118125122/http://www.amazon.com/The-Great-Movies-Roger-Ebert/dp/0767910389 |archivedate=January 18, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jay Carr of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' opined that the film began with an "invigoratingly nervy and imaginative buzz", but that it eventually became "explosively silly".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Jay | last=Carr | url= | title='Fight Club' packs a punch but lacks stamina |work=Boston Globe | date=October 15, 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Newsweek]]''{{'}}s David Ansen described ''Fight Club'' as "an outrageous mixture of brilliant technique, puerile philosophizing, trenchant satire and sensory overload" and thought that the ending was too pretentious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=David | last=Ansen | url= | title=A Fistful of Darkness | journal=[[Newsweek]] | date=October 18, 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Schickel of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' described the [[mise en scène]] as dark and damp: "It enforces the contrast between the sterilities of his characters' aboveground life and their underground one. Water, even when it's polluted, is the source of life; blood, even when it's carelessly spilled, is the symbol of life being fully lived. To put his point simply: it's better to be wet than dry."

''[[Cineaste (magazine)|Cineaste]]''{{'}}s Gary Crowdus reviewed the critical reception in retrospect: "Many critics praised ''Fight Club'', hailing it as one of the most exciting, original, and thought-provoking films of the year." He wrote of the negative opinion, "While ''Fight Club'' had numerous critical champions, the film's critical attackers were far more vocal, a negative chorus which became hysterical about what they felt to be the excessively graphic scenes of fisticuffs&amp;nbsp;... They felt such scenes served only as a mindless glamorization of brutality, a morally irresponsible portrayal, which they feared might encourage impressionable young male viewers to set up their own real-life fight clubs in order to beat each other senseless."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | last=Crowdus | first=Gary | title=Getting Exercised Over ''Fight Club'' |magazine=[[Cineaste (magazine)|Cineaste]] |date=September 2000 | volume=25 | issue=4 | pages=46–48 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''flex model''' is a method of teaching for students who are [[Non-traditional student|non-traditional learners]]. [[Learning]] material and instructions are given online and the lessons are self-guided. The [[teacher]] is available on-site. The students work independently and learn to develop and create new concepts in a [[digital environment]]. They work in [[computer lab]]s most of the time. The schedules of learning modalities are customized individually and the teacher-of-record is on-site. Though most of the instructions are given online, the face-to-face support as needed by the student is given by the teacher-of-records and adults through activities such as group projects, small group instruction and individual [[tutoring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=https://aspirepublicschools.org/media/filer_public/2013/07/22/aspire-blended-learning-handbook-2013.pdf |title=BLENDED LEARNING 101 |publisher=Webcache.googleusercontent.com |date=2013-07-22 |accessdate=2015-09-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226101305/http://aspirepublicschools.org/media/filer_public/2013/07/22/aspire-blended-learning-handbook-2013.pdf |archivedate=2015-02-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This model provides the students a flexible [[learning environment]]. They are free to arrive and leave the learning premises within the given timing of the day. The teacher in this model acts as a mentor and give equal importance in delivering the proper instruction to the students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.inacol.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/iNACOL_Blended-Learning-The-Evolution-of-Online-And-Face-to-Face-Education-from-2008-2015.pdf |title=Blending Learning: |publisher=Webcache.googleusercontent.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-19 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915122142/http://www.inacol.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/iNACOL_Blended-Learning-The-Evolution-of-Online-And-Face-to-Face-Education-from-2008-2015.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
* Students will be able to carry out the learning process at their own pace.
* There is a facilitation of credit accumulation during the course of learning.
* The school operates at a lower cost compared to [[alternative school]]s.

==Disadvantages==
* Due to the lack of fixed schedules for the students to attend the classes, it is difficult for the school to accommodate the scheduling system.
* This model demands larger spaces and many devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://charterschoolconference.com/2013/handouts/Carrandi_Blended_Learning_Model.pdf |title=Model 1: ROTATION A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8009">{{About|the (sometimes historical) social practice of children being raised by families not their own|the modern child welfare system of placing children in state custody in the homes of temporary caregivers|Foster care}}
{{Globalize|date=July 2010}}

'''Fosterage''', the practice of a family bringing up a child not their own, differs from [[adoption]] in that the child's parents, not the foster-parents, remain the acknowledged parents. In many modern western societies [[foster care]] can be organised by the state to care for children with troubled family backgrounds, usually on a temporary basis.  In many pre-modern societies fosterage was a form of [[patronage]], whereby influential families cemented political relationships by bringing up each other's children, similar to [[arranged marriage]]s, also based on dynastic or alliance calculations.

This practice was once common in Ireland, Wales, and Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fosterage|title=Fosterage
|publisher= Merriam-Webster |accessdate=2012-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Fosterage in the Hebrides==
In his ''[[A Journey to the Western Isles of Scotland]]'' (1775), writer [[Samuel Johnson]] described the fosterage custom as he saw it practised.&lt;ref&gt;''A Journey to the Western Isles of Scotland'' by Samuel Johnson. 1775 edition. [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/0/6/2064/2064.txt Gutenberg text] accessed May 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|There still remains in the [[Hebrides|Islands]], though it is passing fast away, the custom of fosterage.  A [[Laird]], a man of wealth and eminence, sends his child, either male or female, to a [[tacksman]], or tenant, to be fostered. It is not always his own tenant, but some distant friend that obtains this honour; for an honour such a trust is very reasonably thought.  The terms of fosterage seem to vary in different islands.  In [[Isle of Mull|Mull]], the father sends with his child a certain number of cows, to which the same number is added by the fosterer.  The father appropriates a proportionable extent of ground, without rent, for their pasturage.  If every cow brings a calf, half belongs to the fosterer, and half to the child; but if there be only one calf between two cows, it is the child's, and when the child returns to the parent, it is accompanied by all the cows given, both by the father and by the fosterer, with half of the increase of the stock by propagation.  These beasts are considered as a portion, and called Macalive cattle, of which the father has the produce, but is supposed not to have the full property, but to owe the same number to the child, as a portion to the daughter, or a stock for the son.

Children continue with the fosterer perhaps six years, and cannot, where this is the practice, be considered as burdensome.  The fosterer, if he gives four cows, receives likewise four, and has, while the child continues with him, grass for eight without rent, with half the calves, and all the milk, for which he pays only four cows when he dismisses his Dalt, for that is the name for a foster child.

Fosterage is, I believe, sometimes performed upon more liberal terms.  Our friend, the young Laird of Col, was fostered by Macsweyn of Grissipol. Macsweyn then lived a tenant to Sir James Macdonald in the Isle of Sky; and therefore Col, whether he sent him cattle or not, could grant him no land.  The Dalt, however, at his return, brought back a considerable number of Macalive cattle, and of the friendship so formed there have been good effects.  When Macdonald raised his rents, Macsweyn was, like other tenants, discontented, and, resigning his farm, removed from Sky to Col, and was established at Grissipol.}}

==Fosterage in Medieval Iceland==
Fosterage or "fostering" is frequently referred to in the medieval [[Sagas of Icelanders]].  Original family ties and rights of inheritance were not affected, nor was it required for the fostered child to be an orphan or for the biological father to be deceased. Moreover, the fostering of another man's child was regarded as a source of honor to the birth father; and conventionally the fostering party was  of inferior social status to the biological father. An exception to this convention is found in [[Njáls saga]], where [[Njáll Þorgeirsson|Njál Thorgeirsson]], a very prominent man, fosters Hoskuld, the son of Thrain Sigfusson, after the death of Thrain in battle.
 
Portions of Ireland, Scotland and the Hebrides were ruled for long periods of time by Norse invaders during the Middle Ages; but it is unknown which culture was the original source of the custom of fosterage.

==Literary fosterage==
In [[Ancient Ireland]], [[ollam]]s taught children either for payment or for no compensation. Children were taught a particular trade and treated like family; their original family ties were often severed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.libraryireland.com/Brehon-Laws/Fosterage.php|title=Fosterage in Ancient Ireland|publisher=Library Ireland|accessdate=2012-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fosterage in other cultures==

There was similar custom in the [[Caucasus]], called Atalik - [[:ru:Аталычество]].

The '''golden apple''' is an element that appears in various national and ethnic [[folk legends]] or [[fairy tales]]. Recurring themes depict a hero (for example [[Hercules]] or [[Făt-Frumos]]) retrieving the golden [[apple (symbolism)|apple]]s hidden or stolen by a monstrous [[antagonist]]. Alternatively, they are depicted as divine food and the source of [[immortality]] in [[Norse mythology]], and as part of the mysterious [[Silver Branch|apple branch]] of [[Celtic Otherworld|Otherworld]] in [[Irish mythology]].

== Greek mythology ==
Three instances of golden apples were featured in [[Greek mythology]]:

===Atalanta===
{{Main article|Atalanta}}
[[Image:Guido Reni - Atalanta e Ippomene (Napoli).jpg|thumb|left|340px|''Atalanta and Melanion'', [[Guido Reni]], c. 1622&amp;ndash;25]]

The first case concerns a huntress named Atalanta who raced against a suitor named [[Melanion]].  Melanion used golden apples to distract Atalanta so that he could win the race.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Though abandoned by her father as an infant, Atalanta became a skilled hunter and received acclaim for her role in the hunt for the Calydonian boar.  Her father claimed her as his daughter and wished to marry her off.  However, Atalanta was reluctant to marry due to a prophecy that marriage would be her downfall.  Because of her beauty, she gained a number of suitors and finally agreed to marry, but under the condition that her suitor was obligated to beat her in a footrace.  Competitors who failed to beat her would be put to death.  As Atalanta could run extremely fast, all her suitors died.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Realizing that Atalanta could not be defeated in a fair race, Melanion prayed to [[Aphrodite]] for help.  The goddess gave him three golden apples and told him to drop them one at a time to distract Atalanta.  Sure enough, she quit running long enough to retrieve each golden apple.  It took all three apples and all of his speed, but Melanion finally succeeded, winning the race and Atalanta's hand.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Eventually they had a son [[Parthenopeus|Parthenopaios]], who was one of the Seven against Thebes.  Their marriage ended in misfortune when they were transformed into lions (which the Greeks believed were unable to mate with their own species, only with leopards) for offending the gods.

===Golden Apple of Trojan War Fable===
{{Main article|Judgement of Paris|Apple of Discord}}
[[File:Enrique Simonet - El Juicio de Paris - 1904.jpg|thumb|left|390px|[[El Juicio de Paris (Simonet)|''El Juicio de Paris'']] by [[Enrique Simonet]], 1904. [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] is holding the golden apple on his right hand while surveying the goddesses in a calculative manner.]]

[[Zeus]] held a [[banquet]] in celebration of the marriage of [[Peleus]] and [[Thetis]]. [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], the goddess of discord, was not invited for her troublesome nature, and upon turning up uninvited, she threw a golden apple into the ceremony, with an inscription that read:  "ΤΗΙ ΚΑΛΛΙΣΤΗΙ" ({{lang-grc|τῇ καλλίστῃ|translit=tē(i) kallistē(i)}}, [[Greek language|Modern Greek]]: τη καλλίστη ''ti kallisti''; "for/to the most beautiful" – cf. [[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]]). Three goddesses claimed the apple: [[Hera]], [[Athena]], and [[Aphrodite]]. They brought the matter before Zeus. Not wanting to get involved, Zeus assigned the task to [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] of Troy. Paris had demonstrated his exemplary fairness previously when he awarded a prize unhesitatingly to [[Ares]] after the god, in bull form, had bested his own prize bull.

Zeus gave the apple to [[Hermes]] and told him to deliver it to Paris and tell him that the goddesses would accept his decision without argument. As each goddess wanted to receive the apple, they each stripped off their own clothing and appeared naked before [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]]. Each of the goddesses also offered Paris a gift as a bribe in return for the apple; Hera offered to make him the king of Europe and Asia Minor, Athena offered him wisdom and skill in battle, and Aphrodite offered to give to him the love of the world's most beautiful woman, [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] of Sparta, who was already married to King Menelaus. Paris chose Aphrodite, a decision that caused the [[Trojan war]], and ultimately the destruction of both Paris and his city, Troy.

==Norse mythology==
[[Image:Ring5.jpg|right|thumb|[[Freia]], from ''[[Das Rheingold]]'', with the tree of golden apples]]
In [[Norse mythology]], the golden apples are the source of the gods' immortality and perpetual youth; comparable to the role of [[ambrosia]] in [[Greek mythology]]. They are cultivated by—and most often associated with—the goddess [[Iðunn]].

===In myth===
In the book ''[[Skáldskaparmál]]'', Iðunn is mentioned in its first chapter (numbered as 55) as one of eight [[Æsir|ásynjur]] (goddesses) sitting in their thrones at a banquet in [[Asgard]] for [[Ægir]].&lt;ref name=FAULKES59&gt;Faulkes (1995:59).&lt;/ref&gt; In chapter 56, [[Bragi]] tells Ægir about Iðunn's abduction by the [[jötunn]] [[Þjazi]]. Bragi says that after hitting an eagle (Þjazi in disguise) with a pole, [[Loki]] finds himself stuck to the bird, and being pulled further and further into the sky, his feet banging against stones, gravel, and trees, and he felt his arms might be pulled out from his shoulders. Loki shouted and begged the eagle for a truce, and the eagle responds that Loki would only be freed if he made a solemn vow to have Iðunn come outside of Asgard with her apples. Loki accepts and returns to his friends [[Odin]] and [[Hœnir]]. At the time the Þjazi and Loki agreed on, Loki lures Iðunn out of Asgard into "a certain forest", telling her that he had discovered some apples that she would find worth keeping, and told Iðunn that she ought to bring her apples with her so that she may compare them with the apples Loki discovered. Þjazi arrives in eagle shape, snatches Iðunn, flies away with her, and takes her to his home, [[Þrymheimr]].&lt;ref name=FAULKES60&gt;Faulkes (1995:60).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Æsir begin to grow grey and old at the disappearance of Iðunn. The Æsir hold an assembly [[thing (assembly)|thing]], where they ask one another when Iðunn had been seen last. The Æsir realize that the last time that Iðunn was seen was when she was going outside of Asgard with Loki, and so they have Loki arrested and brought to the assembly, where he is threatened with death and torture. Terrified, Loki says that he will search for Iðunn in the land of [[Jötunheimr]] if the goddess [[Freyja]] will lend him her "[[falcon]] shape". Freyja lends the falcon shape to Loki, and with it he flies north to Jötunheimr, and arrives a day later at Þjazi's home. Loki finds that Þjazi is out in a boat at sea, and that Iðunn is home alone. Loki turns her into a [[nut (fruit)|nut]], holds her in his claws, and flies away with her as fast as possible.&lt;ref name=FAULKES60/&gt;

Upon Þjazi's arrival home, he finds that Iðunn is gone. Þjazi assumes his eagle shape, and chases after Loki, causing a storm wind. The Æsir see a falcon flying with a nut, as well as the pursuing eagle, so they go outside from Asgard, with loads of wood shavings. The falcon flies over the fortification, and drops down by the wall. The eagle is unable to stop when he misses the falcon, the feathers of the eagle catch fire, and he falls. The Æsir, close by, kill the jötunn Þjazi within the gates of Asgard, "and this killing is greatly renowned."&lt;ref name=FAULKES60/&gt;

==Irish mythology==
The role of the Golden Apple is far more minor and less specific in [[Irish mythology|Irish lore]], mostly because it is an element of the [[Silver Branch]], or ''Silver Bough'', symbol that is connected to the [[Celtic Otherworld]].

===Apple branch===
Described in [[The Voyage of Bran]] as "a silver branch of the sacred apple-tree bearing blossoms",&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Eleanor Hull, The Silver Bough in Irish Legend, in Folk-Lore, xii.&lt;/ref&gt; it is said that "to enter the Otherworld before the appointed hour marked by death, a passport was often necessary, and this was usually a silver branch,"&lt;ref&gt;Extract from Gods of the Celts, published by Dalriada Publications – http://www.manannan.net/library/godofthecelts.html&lt;/ref&gt; thus continuing the apple's divine connection found in Greek and Norse myth.&lt;ref name="MacKillop1"&gt;James MacKillop, ''Dictionary of Celtic Mythology'', Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1998, pp.21, 205, 270, 322–3, 346, 359–60. {{ISBN|0-19-280120-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This connection is particularly strong regarding the Irish [[water deity|sea deity]] and Otherworld guardian [[Manannán mac Lir]], as evidenced in the tale [[His Three Calls to Cormac]]. In this story Manannán gifts a "branch of silver with three golden apples" to King [[Cormac mac Airt]] and, when shaken, these golden apples produced a music that could put anybody to sleep.&lt;ref&gt;This tale exists in several manuscripts of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries; i. e. Book of Ballymote, and Yellow Book of Lecan, as edited and translated by Stokes, in Irische Texts, III. i. 183–229; cf. Voy. of Bran, i. 190 ff.; cf. Le Cycle Myth. Irl., pp. 326–33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Part I Book IV: His Three Calls to Cormac – http://www.manannan.net/library/Lady%20Gregory/His%20Three%20Calls%20to%20Cormac.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gregory1"&gt;Gregory, Lady Augusta (1903) [http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/gafm/gafm21.htm online "Part I Book IV: His Three Calls to Cormac"] in ''Gods and Fighting Men''. Buckinghamshire, Colyn Smyth&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Joseph. "The Fate of the Children of Lir." More Celtic Fairy Tales. Illustrated by John D. Batten. London: David Nutt, 1894. 204–209. – http://www.luminarium.org/mythology/ireland/cormacfairy.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gods and Fighting Men – The Story of the Tuatha De Danaan and of the Fianna of Ireland, arranged and put into English by  Lady Gregory with a preface by W.B. Yeats (1905) – Chapter XI. His Three Calls to Cormac – https://www.gutenberg.org/files/14465/14465-h/14465-h.htm#L22&lt;/ref&gt; This gift however, was conditional in that the price was the King's family and, though they are eventually restored to him, Manannán used to silver branch of golden apples as the means to teach Cormac a harsh lesson. In addition, in her ''[[Gods and Fighting Men]]'' (1904),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Gods and Fighting Men, Lady Gregory |year=1904 |url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/gafm/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Augusta, Lady Gregory]] describes Manannán's gift as a "shining branch having nine apples of red gold."&lt;ref name="Gregory1"/&gt;

==Music==
In [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'', the golden apples have their own [[leitmotif]]. It is first sung by [[Fafnir|Fafner]], when he explains to his brother Fasolt why they must take Freia away from the gods.

In [[Stravinsky]]'s ballet [[The Firebird]] (1910) which is based upon an amalgam of Russian folk-legends, the hero Prince Ivan enters a garden where he witnesses 13 young Princesses' playing with Golden Apples which grow there. (Tableaux VII Scherzo. Jeux des princesses avec les pommes d'or / The Princesses' Game with the Golden Apples).

==Fairy tales==
[[Image:Firebird.jpg|right|thumb|[[Ivan Tsarevich]] catches the [[Firebird (Slavic folklore)|Firebird]] who tries to steal golden apples in ''[[Tsarevitch Ivan, the Fire Bird and the Gray Wolf]]'']]
Many European fairy tales begin when golden apples are stolen from a king, usually by a bird:
*"[[Tsarevitch Ivan, the Fire Bird and the Gray Wolf]]" (Russian)
*"[[The Golden Bird]]" (German)
*"[[The Golden Mermaid]]" (German)
*"[[The Nine Peahens and the Golden Apples]]" (Serbian/Bulgarian)
*"[[Prâslea the Brave and the Golden Apples]]" (Romanian, where the thief is not a bird but a [[zmeu]])
*"[[The Three Brothers and the Golden Apple]]" (Bulgarian, where the thief is not a bird but a [[zmey]])
*"[[The White Snake]]" (German)

==Modern literature==
The [[William Butler Yeats]] poem "The Song of the Wandering Aengus", has the lines:
:''I will find out where she has gone''
:''And kiss her lips and take her hands;''
:''And walk among long dappled grass,''
:''And pluck till time and times are done''
:''The silver apples of the moon,''
:''The golden apples of the sun.''

The [[Augusta, Lady Gregory]] play called ''The Golden Apple: A Play for Kiltartan Children'' is a fable in the invented [[Kiltartan]] dialect based on Irish mythology and folklore.

''The Golden Apples'' is the name of Southern writer, Eudora Welty's, fourth short story collection, published in 1949. The stories are interrelated and center around the citizens of the fictional town of Morgana, Mississippi.

A golden apple plays a crucial role in the climax of [[David Mitchell (author)|David Mitchell's]] sixth novel ''[[The Bone Clocks]]'', published by Random House in 2014.

==Discordianism==
The contemporary religion [[Discordianism]] draws upon the Golden Apple of the goddess [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], also known as the "Apple of Discord", which Eris used to set off the conflict among the goddesses of Olympus that lead to the [[Trojan War]] because she was not invited to a party (the so-called "Original Snub". Emblazoned upon the apple is the word "''[[Kallisti]]''" ("to the fairest").&lt;ref name="principiadiscordia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.principiadiscordia.com/book/24.php |title=Page 17-18 |publisher=Principia Discordia |date= |accessdate=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The golden apple can be seen as a metaphor for a practical joke meant to cause [[cognitive dissonance]] in the target.

==Identity and use in other languages==

===Argan fruit===
Michael Hübner has suggested that the fruit of the [[Argania|Argan tree]], endemic to the [[Sous Valley]] in present-day [[Morocco]], may be the golden apples of the [[Hesperides (poetry)|Hesperides]]. Arguing that the location matches most closely the description given in classical texts of [[Atlantis]] and the garden of the Hesperides, he notes that the ripe fruits look like small golden apples and have an aroma like baked apples. He equates the fruit, the seeds of which produce [[Argan oil]], with [[Plato]]'s account of Atlantean fruits "which afford liquid and solid food and unguents", and proposes that the trees' almost reptilian-scale like bark and thorns may have inspired the mythical guardian dragon of the golden apples, [[Ladon (mythology)|Ladon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Michael|last=Hübner|title=Circumstantial Evidence for Plato's Island Atlantis in the Souss-Massa plain in today's South-Morocco|url=http://asalas.org/papers/Huebner_Atlantis_Circumstantial_Evidence_full.pdf|pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oranges===
In many languages, the [[orange (fruit)|orange]] is referred to as a "golden apple". For example, the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''χρυσομηλιά,'' and [[Latin]] ''pomum aurantium'' both literally describe oranges as "golden apples". Other languages, like [[German language|German]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and [[Russian language|Russian]], have more complex [[etymologies]] for the word "orange" that can be traced back to the same idea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gernot-katzers-spice-pages.com/engl/Citr_sin.html#etym ''Orange (Citrus sinensis [L.&amp;#93; Osbeck) Etymology''], Gernot Katzer, [http://gernot-katzers-spice-pages.com/engl/index.html Gernot Katzer Spice Pages], formerly [[University of Graz]], February 3, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

In later years it was thought that the "golden apples" of myth might have actually been [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]], a fruit unknown to [[Europe]] and the [[Mediterranean]] before the [[Middle Ages]]. Under this assumption, the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[botanical]] name chosen for all [[citrus]] species was ''Hesperidoeidē'' (Ἑσπεριδοειδῆ, "hesperidoids"). It was also used by [[Carl Linnaeus]], who gave the name Hesperides to an [[order (biology)|order]] containing the [[genus]] Citrus, in allusion to the golden apples of the Hesperides, and is preserved in the term [[Hesperidium]] for the fruits of citrus and some other plants.

One reason why oranges might be considered to be "magical" in so many stories is because they bear flowers and fruit at the same time, unlike other fruit.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

===Quinces===
Frequently, the term "golden apple" is used to refer to the [[quince]], a fruit originating in the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.saucemagazine.com/a/890 |title=Quince, the 'Golden Apple'| author=Arnot, Sharon | work= Sauce Magazine|date=April 26, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tomatoes===
The [[tomato]], unknown to the ancient world of the Greeks, is known as the ''pomodoro'' in [[Italian language|Italian]], meaning "golden apple" (from ''pomo d'oro'').{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

==Popular Culture==
Golden apples are also items that are featured in video games such as *[[Minecraft]]&lt;ref&gt;https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Golden_Apple&lt;/ref&gt; and *[[Hello Neighbor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://helloneighbor.gamepedia.com/Apple|website=helloneighbor.gamepedia.com|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was educated in [[Vienna]], then subsequently in [[Paris]] and [[London]]. He studied sociology and psychology at [[London University]] before obtaining a lectureship in social psychology at the [[University of Manchester]]. In 1952 he took up a post at the [[University College of the Gold Coast]] (now Ghana) in the Department of Sociology, where he carried out pioneering research into cross-cultural psychology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/gustav-jahoda Biography for Gustav Jahoda]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, Gustav Jahoda was invited to set up a new psychology department in the [[University of Strathclyde]], although he continued to make field trips to West Africa. He retired in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Jahoda, Gustav. ''Always something new out of Africa''. In Bond, M H: ''Working at the Interface of Cultures: Eighteen Lives in Social Science''.

He published works on cross-cultural psychology, socio-cognitive development and history of the social sciences. He also published more than 200 articles.

Homespun offers music instruction for many instruments and styles on CD, DVD and streaming media.

==History==
[[Happy Traum]]'s inspiration for Homespun came in 1967, when he was a musician and part-time guitar teacher in New York City. When he moved to Woodstock, New York and began to tour with his brother [[Artie Traum]], he made tapes (based on his 1965 book ''Fingerpicking Styles for Guitar'') for his guitar students to use when he was unavailable.&lt;ref name=HS-puremusic-2017&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.puremusic.com/71happy1.html|title=Puremusic interview with Happy Traum|work=puremusic.com|accessdate=July 5, 2017|author=Frank Goodman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also received letters from others who wanted to learn to play, so he made more tapes and sold them via classified advertisements in ''[[Guitar Player]]'', ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', and ''[[Sing Out!]]'' magazines.&lt;ref name=HS-monitor-1993&gt;{{cite news|last1=MacLachlan|first1=Suzanne L.
|title=Homespun Tapes Runs with Music Giants|url=https://m.csmonitor.com/1993/0913/13061.html|accessdate=July 5, 2017|work=Christian Science Monitor|date=September 13, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HS-rollmag-2011&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cordtz|first1=Kay|title=Documenting the Greats, Teaching the New: Happy and Jane Traum’s Homespun Tapes and Video|url=http://www.rollmagazine.com/archive/jul11/articles/music.php|accessdate=July 7, 2017|work=Roll Magazine|date=July 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He decided to turn this effort into the Homespun business, with his wife Jane as co-owner and his brother Artie assisting. They invited musicians they knew to record instructional tapes. [[Bill Keith (musician)|Bill Keith]] (banjo) and [[Kenny Kosek]] (fiddle) were among the first to participate.&lt;ref name=HS-deseret-1989&gt;{{cite news|last1=staff writer|first1= |title=Tapes Bring Homespun Sound Home|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/43034/TAPES-BRING-HOMESPUN-SOUND-HOME.html?pg=all|accessdate=July 7, 2017|work=Deseret News|date=April 20, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homespun's first instructional lessons were recorded in Traum's home and sold on five-inch reel-to-reel tapes, as cassettes were not yet generally available.&lt;ref name=HS-whichside-2005&gt;{{cite book |last=Weissman|first=Dick|authorlink= |date=2005|title=Which Side Are You On?: An Inside History of the Folk Music Revival in America|edition=1|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Which_Side_Are_You_On.html?id=ocXMnBpa-DYC|access-date=July 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tapes were manually reproduced one by one at home: thus the name "Homespun."&lt;ref name=HS-rollmag-2011 /&gt;

Traum produced the sessions, and provided guidance for artists who were uncomfortable teaching.&lt;ref name=HS-namm-2017&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.namm.org/library/oral-history/jane-traum|title=Oral Histories: Jane Traum|work=NAMM.org|accessdate=July 7, 2017|author= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the business grew, Traum traveled to other locations to record more musicians, and invited musicians outside their circle of friends to participate.&lt;ref name=HS-puremusic-2017 /&gt;

In 1983, Homespun introduced music instruction on VCR tapes, before most homes had video players. Through the years, Homespun has expanded its audio and video formats, moving from audio cassette and video tape to CDs, DVDs, and streaming media.&lt;ref name=HS-billboard-1997&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bessman|first1=Jim|title=Homespun Turns 30 with CD Instructional, Video Lines|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7QkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=homespun+music+instruction&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=V2a56is6-B&amp;sig=BdlbEe13wwqmkjoYz9BpOVZvM70&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjq9fjD-fjUAhUU1GMKHX9gAUc4HhDoAQgjMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=homespun%20music%20instruction&amp;f=false|accessdate=July 7, 2017|work=Billboard|date=November 8, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HS-rhythm-2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Patience|first1=Iain|title=Happy Traum Interview|url=https://rhythms.com.au/happy-traum-interview-by-iain-patience/|accessdate=July 5, 2017|work=Rhythms|date=March 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hal Leonard Corporation]] has been distributing Homespun products since 1995. Homespun products are also sold at their website, and the Roots music channel offers a web subscription service for Homespun streaming media.&lt;ref name=HS-retailer-2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Van Dyke|first1=Matthew|title=Hal Leonard &amp; Homespun Celebrate 20 Years Together|url=http://msretailer.com/hal-leonard-homespun-celebrate-20-years-together/

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2002">The '''line of thrust''' is the [[Locus (mathematics)|locus]] of the points, through which forces pass in a [[retaining wall]] or an [[arch]]. It is the line, along which [[internal forces]] flow, [http://www.ring.shef.ac.uk/ring150_theory.pdf], [http://www.bristol.ac.uk/civilengineering/bridges/Pages/HowtoreadabridgeArches.html].

In a [[stone structure]], the line of thrust is a theoretical line that through the structure represents the path of the [[Resultant force|resultant]]s of the [[compressive forces]], [http://web.mit.edu/masonry/papers/block_dejong_ochs_NNJ.pdf]. For a structure to be stable, the line of thrust must lie entirely inside the structure, [http://web.mit.edu/masonry/papers/block_dejong_ochs_NNJ.pdf], [http://www.ring.shef.ac.uk/ring150_theory.pdf].

==Where important==

The line of thrust is important in almost any [[architecture]] bearing weight. This includes [[aircraft]], [[bridge|bridges]], plus [[arch|arches]]; see [[catenary arch]].

An arch won't collapse, when the line of thrust is entirely internal to the arch, [http://www.wseas.us/e-library/conferences/2014/Florence/SEMOTEC/SEMOTEC-20.pdf].

A '''luxury tax''' in professional sports is a surcharge put on the aggregate payroll of a team to the extent to which it exceeds a predetermined guideline level set by the league. The ostensible purpose of this "tax" is to prevent teams in major markets with high incomes from signing almost all of the more talented players and hence destroying the competitive balance necessary for a sport to maintain fan interest. The money derived from the "tax" is either divided among the teams that play in the smaller markets, presumably to allow them to have more revenue to devote toward the contracts of high-quality players,&lt;ref&gt;Dietl, H., Lang, M. and Werner, S. (2010): "[http://www.isu.uzh.ch/static/ISU_WPS/91_ISU_full.pdf The Effect of Luxury Taxes on Competitive Balance, Club Profits, and Social Welfare in Sports Leagues]", forthcoming in ''International Journal of Sport Finance''.&lt;/ref&gt; or in the case of Major League Baseball, used by the league for other pre-defined purposes.

In [[North America]], [[Major League Baseball]] has implemented the luxury tax system. The [[National Basketball Association]] also has a luxury tax provision; its utility is somewhat limited by the fact that the league also has a [[salary cap]] provision. The "hard" salary cap of the [[National Football League]] and the [[National Hockey League]] has prevented any need for a luxury tax arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Andreff|first=Wladimir |author2=Stefan Szymański |title=Handbook on the economics of sport|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|year=2006|isbn=978-1-84376-608-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PGRkblShhU8C&amp;pg=PA656&amp;lpg=PA656&amp;dq=sports+luxury+tax|pages=656}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods for limiting payroll==
In the Big 4 North American sports leagues (Major League Baseball (MLB), National Basketball Association (NBA), National Football League (NFL), and National Hockey League (NHL)), there are three different methods employed to limit individual teams payroll: hard salary cap, soft salary cap with luxury tax, and luxury tax.

===Hard salary cap===
A hard [[salary cap]] is where the league sets a maximum amount of money allowed for player salaries, and no team can exceed that limit.

===Soft salary cap===
A soft salary cap has a set limit to player salaries, but there are several major exceptions that allow teams to exceed the salary cap. For example, in the case of the NBA, teams can exceed the salary cap when keeping players that are already on the team.

===Luxury tax===
A luxury tax system does not have a limit to how much money can be spent on player salaries. However, there is a tax levied on money spent above a threshold set by the [[Collective bargaining|Collective Bargaining Agreement]] (CBA) between the players union and the owners. For every dollar a team spends above the tax threshold, they must also pay some fraction to the league. This system is used to discourage teams from greatly exceeding the tax threshold, with the goal of ensuring parity between large and small market teams.

==Luxury tax rules by league==

[[Image:George Steinbrenner s life work 13july2010 000150.jpg|thumb|Former Owner [[George Steinbrenner]]'s [[New York Yankees]] have paid over $297 million in luxury tax since 2003 (as of December 2016).]]

===Major League Baseball (MLB)===
{{main|Major League Baseball Luxury Tax}}

As explained by Fangraphs: "Technically called the 'Competitive Balance Tax', the Luxury Tax is the punishment that large market teams get for spending too much money. While MLB does not have a set salary cap, the luxury tax charges teams with high payrolls a considerable amount of money, giving teams ample reason to want to keep their payrolls below that level."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fangraphs.com/library/business/luxury-tax/&lt;/ref&gt;

The threshold level for the luxury tax will be $189MM in 2014 (up from $178MM from 2011-2013) and will remain at $189MM through 2016. From 2012 through 2016, teams who exceed the threshold for the first time must pay 17.5% '''of the amount they are over''', 30% for the second consecutive year over, 40% for the third consecutive year over, and 50% for four or more consecutive years over the cap.&lt;ref&gt;Luxury Tax" [http://www.fangraphs.com/library/business/luxury-tax/ Fangraphs]&lt;/ref&gt;

Only seven teams have ever exceeded the luxury tax threshold: the [[San Francisco Giants]], the [[Boston Red Sox]], the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]], the [[Detroit Tigers]], the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], the [[New York Yankees]] and the [[Chicago Cubs]]  for the very first time in 2016. Only the Red Sox, Dodgers and Yankees have exceeded it more than once. The LA Dodgers have exceed it four times. Boston has exceeded it six times. New York has exceeded it fourteen times, or, every year since it has been in enforcement. In aggregate, the Yankees have paid out some $325.00 MM, 73.78%, of the total fines assessed since the luxury tax began. 

In 2016 a record six teams were issued the luxury tax by the MLB. The [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] ($31.8 million), the [[New York Yankees]] ($27.4 million), the [[Boston Red Sox]] ($4.5 million), the [[Detroit Tigers]] ($4 million), the [[San Francisco Giants]] ($3.4 million) and the[[Chicago Cubs]] ($186.5 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.durhamregion.com/sports-story/7024591-record-6-mlb-teams-to-pay-luxury-tax/|title=Record 6 MLB teams to pay luxury tax|date=6 December 2016|publisher=Metroland News|accessdate=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 the same six teams from 2016 were issued the luxury tax by the MLB.  Against the $195 million threshold + $13 million for player benefits, payrolls for the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] ($244 million), [[New York Yankees]] ($209.3 million ), [[Boston Red Sox]] ($187.9 million), [[Detroit Tigers]] ($190.4 million), [[San Francisco Giants]] ($186.4 million) and [[Chicago Cubs]] ($199.5 million) were in excess.  This was the 15th straight year the [[New York Yankees]] paid the luxury tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sbnation.com/mlb/2017/11/14/16651638/luxury-tax-teams-yankees-dodgers-red-sox-cubs-tigers-giants|title=6 teams will pay the luxury tax this year, and yes, of course, one of them is the Yankees|date=14 November 2017|publisher=SBnation|accessdate=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 only two teams met the luxury tax by the MLB: The Boston Red ($9.4 million) and The Washington Nationals ($1.2 million).  Several teams came just under the $197 million tax threshold: The San Francisco Giants ($196.66 million), The Chicago Cubs ($183.9 million), Houston Astros ($182.4 million), Los Angeles Dodgers ($181.99 million) and New York Yankees ($178.8 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/23297301/boston-red-sox-washington-nationals-only-teams-track-pay-luxury-tax|title=Red Sox, Nationals only teams on track to pay MLB's luxury tax|date=23 April 2018|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The luxury tax is separate from revenue sharing, which is a system to balance out the income distribution between large and small market teams by dividing money from merchandise sales and media contracts. The money generated from the luxury tax is not distributed to the rest of the league, as is the case with the NBA, but rather is used for other purposes. The first $2,375,400 and 50% of the remaining total are used to fund player benefits, 25% goes to the Industry Growth Fund, and the remaining 25% is used to defray teams' funding obligations from player benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MLB CBA|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/pa/pdf/cba_english.pdf|accessdate=18 October 2016|pages=132-133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Basketball Association (NBA)===
{{main|NBA salary cap}}

The NBA utilizes a soft salary cap, meaning there is a salary cap but there are a variety of exceptions that allow teams to exceed that cap. For example, teams can re-sign players already on the team to an amount up to the maximum salary allowed by the league for up to five years regardless of where their payroll is relative to the cap. This provision is known as the [[NBA Salary Cap#Larry Bird exception|"Larry Bird" exception]], named after the former [[Boston Celtics]] great who was retained by that team until his retirement under the provisions of this rule. The result is that the majority of teams are over the cap at any given time.

In addition to the soft cap, the NBA utilizes a luxury tax system that is applied if the team payroll exceeds a separate threshold higher than the salary cap. These teams pay a penalty for each dollar their team salary exceeds the tax level.  From 2002 to 2013, if a team exceeded the luxury tax threshold, they must pay one dollar to the league for every dollar that they are over the limit. For the 2013-14 season and onward, teams paid an incremental rate based on their team salary. They also have to pay a repeat offender rate, which is an additional dollar for every dollar over. For 2014-15 teams pay the repeater rate if they also were taxpayers in all of the previous three seasons. For 2015-16 and all subsequent seasons, teams pay the repeater rate if they were taxpayers in at least three of the four previous seasons. The table of rates is shown below.

==== Current tax levels ====
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
! Amount over tax threshold
! Standard tax per excess dollar
! Repeat offender tax per excess dollar
|-
| $4,999,999 or less
| $1.50
| $2.50
|-
| $5 million to $9,999,999

| $4.25
|-
| Over $20 million
| $3.75 + $0.50 per $5 million
| $4.75 + $0.50 per $5 million
|}

The resulting total is then distributed to the remaining teams that are under the tax threshold.  

There was no luxury tax implemented in the 2004-2005 season due to insufficient basketball-related income.

Although exceeding the luxury tax threshold costs a team twice as much money, it does not seem to limit teams' willingness to spend big money on players.{{Cn|date=May 2018}}

===Other leagues===
The National Football League (NFL) and the National Hockey League (NHL) both have hard salary caps, making it unnecessary to utilize the luxury tax.

Several other leagues in the United States and abroad use salary caps, but the luxury tax is uncommon.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3306">The '''''Mouvement anti-utilitariste dans les sciences sociales''''' (Anti-utilitarian Movement in the Social Sciences) is a French intellectual movement.&lt;ref name="Graeber"&gt;[http://www.freewords.org/graeber.html GIVE IT AWAY By Anthropologist David Graeber, published at www.freewords.org]&lt;/ref&gt; It is based around the ideology of "anti-[[utilitarianism]]", a critique of [[economism]] in social sciences and [[instrumental rationalism]] in moral and [[political philosophy]]. The movement was founded in 1981 by sociologist [[Alain Caillé]], with the establishment of its interdisciplinary monthly journal '''''Revue du MAUSS'''''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.revuedumauss.com/ La revue du M.A.U.S.S.]&lt;/ref&gt; which is still published and edited by Caillé.

The journal covers topics in economics, anthropology, sociology and political philosophy from an anti-utilitarian perspective. His name is both an acronym and a tribute to the famous anthropologist [[Marcel Mauss]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://thememorybank.co.uk/2007/11/09/a-short-history-of-economic-anthropology/ Short History of Economical Anthropology by Chris Hann published at www.thememorybanck.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; The movement works to promote a third paradigm, as a complement to, or replacement for [[holism]] and [[methodological individualism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.revuedumauss.com/ À propos du M.A.U.S.S.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://revue-sociologique.org/Alain-Caill%C3%A9 Interview with Alain Caillé at www.revue-sociologique.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michèle Richman. 2002. The French Sociological Revolution from Montaigne to Mauss. SubStance. Vol. 31, No. 1, Issue 97: Special Issue: The American Production of French Theory (2002), pp. 27-35&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement began through conversations between Caillé and Swiss anthropologist Gerald Berthoud wondering why the economic theory of [[Marcel Mauss]] based on obligatory reciprocity and debt did not provide any possibilities of a "free gift" motivated by empathy rather than rational self-interest. The movement's early efforts considered the possibility of reintroducing an aspect of genuine interest in the welfare of others in economic theory. Among the economic policies suggested by the movement is the [[basic income guarantee]] a concept originally developed by [[Thomas Paine]].&lt;ref name="Graeber"/&gt;

'''''Mr. Nanny''''' is a 1993 [[family]] [[comedy film]] starring [[professional wrestler]] [[Hulk Hogan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlecrap.com/oldinductions.html |title=Mr. Nanny: Yet another Hulk Hogan disaster of a film, this time with the Orange Goblin being tortured by nerdy children |publisher=Wrestlecrap.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The working title of the film was ''Rough Stuff'', and [[David Johansen]] also recorded a song by that name for the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107612/releaseinfo#akas|title=Mr. Nanny (1993) : Release info|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=2013-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107612/soundtrack|title=Mr. Nanny (1993) : Soundtracks|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=2013-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Sean Armstrong ([[Hulk Hogan]]) is a former wrestler living in [[Palm Beach, Florida]] and suffering from wrestler-days' nightmares. Burt Wilson ([[Sherman Hemsley]]), Sean's friend and former manager, has a bum leg from saving Sean's life and financial difficulties with his personal security business. With much whining and acting, Burt manages to persuade Sean to take a bodyguard job for Alex Mason, Sr. ([[Austin Pendleton]]), the head of the prestigious tech firm, Mason Systems, which is developing a new anti-missile system, the Peacefinder Project. The vital information for this project is stored on a [[integrated circuit|microchip]]. But it is neither the inventor nor the chip Sean has to guard - he is to look after the two Mason kids: Alex Jr. ([[Robert Hy Gorman]]) and Kate ([[Madeline Zima]]).

As it turns out, Alex and Kate are two highly mischievous brats who vie for their often-too-absent father's attention by wreaking havoc in the household via elaborate and rather vicious pranks and booby-traps, with their specialty targets being the nannies he has assigned to take care of them (Alex Sr. is a widower). Sean witnesses the last nanny jumping into the fountain in front of the house to extinguish the fire in her hair. However, their father proves to be either too distracted or too lenient, which causes the children to continue their schemes. Thinking that he is a new (albeit unusual) replacement, they find a new target in Sean. But after one prank too many, which involves a swimming pool full of red dye ("the Pit of Blood"), Sean finally exerts his authority and not only gets to quiet Alex and Kate down, he also manages to open the eyes of their father to his family problems, as well as bonding with the kids and managing to help them sort out problems of their own.

However, the real trouble has just started. The unscrupulous and vain Tommy Thanatos ([[David Johansen]]) is after Alex Sr.'s chip, and he will not stop at anything to get it. As it turns out, Sean and Burt had been once at the receiving end of one of his schemes: he had ordered them to throw a match, and when they had not complied, he attempted to shoot them. However, Burt threw himself in front of Sean, taking the bullet in his right leg (thus his bum leg); Sean had chased Thanatos to the roof of the stadium, and after a furious fight Thanatos ended up plunging head-first into an empty pool. This accident fractured the top of his skull, forcing the attachment of a steel skullplate and removing part of his [[afro]] of which he was so proud.

Thanatos kidnaps Alex Sr. with the help of Frank Olsen ([[Raymond O'Connor]]), the corrupt security chief of Mason Systems (who is disposed of en route to the hideout), and demands of him to hand over the chip. When Alex Sr. (who stowed the chip in Kate's doll) refuses, Thanatos has Alex and Kate kidnapped in order to force him to comply. Despite a valiant effort, Sean is overpowered and Burt is taken as well, giving Thanatos an unexpected revenge bonus. But Sean manages to track down Thanatos, and with the help of his friends is able to beat the villains. As Thanatos prepares to charge Sean, Alex Sr. and the children activate an improvised electromagnet to launch him into the night sky, leaving only his skullplate.

The movie ends with Sean preparing to take a leave of absence from the Masons. But Alex and Kate intend to have him back much sooner - and therefore Sean falls victim to yet another prank.

'''Mrs. Pepperpot''' ({{lang-no|'''Teskjekjerringa'''}}, {{lang-sv|'''Teskedsgumman'''}}, translation: the teaspoon lady or the teaspoon hag) is a fictional character in a series of children's books created by the Norwegian author [[Alf Prøysen]].

[[Image:Kereru001.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Māui took on the appearance of a [[New Zealand pigeon|Kererū]] when he went to find his father in the underworld.]]

In [[Māori mythology]], as in other [[Polynesian mythology|Polynesian traditions]], '''Māui''' is a [[culture hero]] and a trickster, famous for his exploits and cleverness. 

Māui is credited with catching a giant fish using a fishhook taken from his grandmother's jaw-bone; the giant fish would become the [[North Island]] of New Zealand, known as ''Te Ika-a-Māui''. In some traditions, his [[waka (canoe)]] became the [[South Island]], known as ''[[Te Waka a Māui]]''. His last trick, which led to his death, involved the [[Goddess]] [[Hine-nui-te-pō]].  While attempting to make mankind [[Immortality|immortal]] by changing into a worm, Māui entered her [[vagina]], intent on leaving through her mouth while she slept. He was, however, crushed by the [[obsidian]] teeth in her vagina.

==Names and epithets==
*Māui-tikitiki ("Māui the top-knot") 
*Māui-tikitiki-a-Taranga ("Māui the top-knot of Taranga")
*Māui-pōtiki ("Māui the last born").
*Maui te whare kino ("Maui the house of trouble").

== Origin myth ==
The offspring of [[Tūmatauenga|Tū]] (humankind) increased and multiplied and did not know death until the generation of Māui-tikitiki.{{sfn|McLintock|1966|p=449}} 

===Sharn birth===
Māui is the son of [[Taranga (Māori mythology)|Taranga]], the wife of [[Makea Tutara|Makeatutara]]. He has a miraculous birth &amp;mdash; his mother threw her premature infant into the sea wrapped in a tress of hair from her topknot (tikitiki) &amp;mdash; hence Māui is known as Māui-tikitiki-a-Taranga. Ocean spirits find and wrap the child in seaweed. Sharn divine ancestor, [[Tama-nui-te-rā|Tama-nui-te-ra]] (or [[Rangi and Papa|Rangi]]) then takes the child and nourishes him to adolescence.

===Discovery of his mother and brothers===
Māui emerged from the sea and traveled to his mother's house, finding his four brothers, Māui-taha, Māui-roto, Māui-pae, and Māui-waho. Māui's brothers are at first wary of the newcomer, but after he performed feats such as transforming himself into different kinds of birds, they acknowledged his power and admired him.

At first, Taranga does not recognise Māui as her child.

When he became old enough, he came to his relatives while they were gathered in the marae, dancing and being merry. Maui crept in and sat down behind his brothers. Soon his mother called the children and found a strange child, who proved to be her son, and was taken in as one of the family. Some of the brothers were jealous, but the eldest addressed the others as follows:

{{Quote|text=Never mind; let him be our dear brother. In the days of peace remember the proverb, 'When you are on friendly terms, settle your disputes in a friendly way; when you are at war, you must redress your injuries by violence.' It is better for us, brothers, to be kind to other people. These are the ways by which men gain influence – by laboring for an abundance of food to feed others, by collecting property to give to others, and by similar means by which you promote the good of others.|sign=|source=}}

Thus Maui was received in his home.

== Legends ==
=== Early exploits ===
Māui created the islands of New Zealand, altered the length of the day and obtained the secret of fire.

In his first expedition, Māui took the jaw-bone of his ancestress Muri-ranga-whenua and used it as a weapon to ensnare the Sun to lengthen the day, as the days were too short for people to finish their work. With the help of his brothers, Māui caught the Sun and beat him severely with the jaw-bone club until the Sun promised to move slower in the future.{{sfn|Tregear|1891|p=234}}

His next exploit was to haul up land from the depth of the ocean. He used the jaw-bone as a fish-hook. Using blood from his nose as bait, Māui hauled a great fish up from the depths. When it emerged from the water, Māui left to find a priest to perform the appropriate ceremonies and prayers, leaving his brothers in charge. They, however, do not wait for Māui to return but begin to cut up the fish. The fish began to writhe in agony, causing it to break up into mountains, cliffs and valleys. If the brothers had listened to Māui, the island would have been a level plain, and people would have been able to travel with ease on its surface. Thus the [[North Island]] of New Zealand is known as [[North Island|Te Ika-a-Māui]] (The Fish of Māui),{{sfn|Tregear|1891|p=234}} also known as [[Hāhau-whenua]].

In Northern Māori traditions of New Zealand, Māui's canoe became the South Island, with [[Banks Peninsula]] marking the place supporting his foot as he pulled up that extremely heavy fish. Besides the official name of [[Te Waipounamu]], another [[Māori language|Māori]] name for the South Island is [[South Island|Te Waka-a-Māui]], the canoe of Māui. In southern traditions, he sailed a canoe called Maahanui and after he had pulled up the North Island (Te Ika a Maui) he left Maahanui on top of a mountain in the foothills behind what is now Ashburton. That mountain now bears the name Maahanui, and the coastline between Banks Peninsula and the Waitaki River is called Te tai o Maahanui (the tides of Maahanui).[[Image:NgaManawa.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Māui stole fire from the fingernails of Mahuika]]In another myth, finding that fire has been lost, Māui resolves to find [[Mahuika]] the Fire-goddess and learn the secret art of obtaining fire. During his visit, his tricks made her furious, and although he obtains the secret of fire, he barely escapes with his life. He transforms himself into a [[Swamp Harrier|hawk]], but to no avail, for Mahuika sets both land and sea on fire. Māui prays to his great ancestors [[Tāwhirimātea]] and [[Whaitiri|Whatiri-matakataka]] who answer by pouring rain to extinguish the fire. Soon after, Māui goes fishing with his sister [[Hina (goddess)|Hina]]'s husband, Irawaru. They disagree when their fishing lines get tangled, and when they returned to shore, Māui turns Irawaru into a dog. Hina is distraught and throws herself into the sea, but she does not die.{{sfn|Tregear|1891|p=234}}

=== Quest for human immortality and death ===
Māui is staying with his mother and brothers. Each morning Taranga disappears. Taking the shape of a [[kererū]] (wood pigeon), Māui follows her and finds her with his father, Makeatutara. When Māui's father is performing baptismal ceremonies for Māui, he errs in the incantations and this ill omen leads, in the end, to Māui's death.{{sfn|Tregear|1891|p=233}}[[Image:Greyfantail.jpg|thumb|right|200px|In some versions, small birds like the [[New Zealand fantail|fantail]] accompanied Māui on his quest to win immortality for humankind.]]
After his early exploits, Māui considered himself ready to win immortality for humankind. His father tried to dissuade him, predicting that he will fail because of the mistakes in his baptismal ceremony. His father says to him, "My son, I know that you are a brave fellow and that you have done all things. Yet I am afraid that there is someone who will defeat you."

"Who could that be?" asked Māui.

"Your ancestress [[Hine-nui-te-pō]] (Goddess of the Night). You can see her flashing there on the horizon."

"Is she as strong as the sun?" asked Māui. "I trapped him and beat him. Is she greater than the sea, which is greater than the land? Yet I have dragged land from it. Now let us see whether we will find life or death."

His father answered, "You are right, my last-born and the strength of my old age. Go, find your ancestress who lives at the side of the sky."

"What does she look like?" asked Māui.

"The red flashing in the western sky comes from her," said the father. "Her body is like a human being, but her eyes are [[Pounamu|greenstone]], her hair [[Kelp|sea-kelp]], and her mouth is like a [[Barracuda|barracouta's]] mouth."{{sfn|McLintock|1966|p=449}}

Māui, undaunted, set out westward, with his companions, to the home of Hine-nui-te-pō. In some versions, his companions are the smallest birds of the forest, the [[tomtit]], the [[Petroicidae|robin]], the [[grey warbler]] and the [[New Zealand fantail|fantail]]. In other versions, his companions are his brothers. He finds Hine asleep with her legs apart, and he and his companions see sharp flints of [[obsidian]] and greenstone between her thighs. "Now," Māui tells his friends, "when I go into the body of this old woman, do not laugh at me. Wait until I come out again from her mouth. Then you may laugh as much as you want."

"You will be killed!" was all the companions could say.

"If you laugh I will indeed be killed. But if I pass right through her body I will live, and she will die."

Then he readied himself, winding the cord of his battle club tightly around his wrist and casting aside his garment. As Māui began his task, the cheeks of his watching friends puckered with suppressed laughter. As his head and arms disappear, one of his brothers - or the fantail bird - cannot hold back any longer and burst out in laughter. The old lady wakes, opens her eyes, claps her legs together and cuts Māui in two. Now Māui has become the first being to die and, because he had failed in his task, all human beings are mortal. The goddess keeps her position at the portal to the underworld through which all humans must travel.{{sfn|McLintock|1966|p=449-450}}{{sfn|Tregear|1891|p=234}}

===Māui and Rohe===
In a rare version, a goddess named [[Rohe (mythology)|Rohe]] was Māui's wife. He mistreated her in a cruel and unusual way. He wished for her to exchange faces with him because she was beautiful and he was not. When she objected, he recited an incantation over her as she slept. When she awoke and realized what had happened, she left the living world and traveled to the underworld where she became a goddess of death.{{sfn|Tregear|1891|p=421}}

==Popular culture==
In the 2016 [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] [[Animation|animated film]] ''[[Moana (2016 film)|Moana]]'', the demigod Maui is voiced by [[Dwayne Johnson]]. Abandoned by his human parents as a baby, he is given demigod status, shapeshifting powers, and a magic fish hook by the gods who take pity on him. He performs [[miracles]] to win back the love of humanity, each of which earns him an animated tattoo. He is fabled to have stolen the heart of Te Fiti, a powerful island goddess who creates life. The protagonist of the film, Moana, persuades him to help her return it. In his song "You're Welcome," composed by [[Lin-Manuel Miranda]], Maui mentions and takes credit for several of the deeds he is credited with in folklore. This Maui incorporates elements of [[Māui (Hawaiian mythology)|Hawaiian mythology]] and other [[Polynesian narrative]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1415">'''New Milford''' is a fictional town in [[New Hampshire]], [[United States]]. It was the subject of a hoax article published in 2011 by ''The White Pine Series of Architectural Monographs'', which described the community as being a flourishing [[Victorian-era]] village in the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]] during the early 20th century. According to the article, New Milford had been incorporated in 1852 by working-class quarry workers, had enjoyed prosperity for many years, and then declined in the early 20th century, following a succession of unfortunate disasters at the quarry site, the decline of rail-based tourism, the [[Great Depression]], and the outbreak of World Wars. Research by the [[Milford, New Hampshire]], Historical Society and the New Hampshire State Library following the publication of the article led to the discovery that the article was fictitious.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.cabinet.com/cabinetcabinetnews/914158-308/tale-of-milford-history.html| title=Tale of Milford History| author=Kathy Cleveland| publisher=''The Milford Cabinet''| date=March 31, 2011| accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Prose|date=September 2016}}
"'''One size fits all'''" is a description for a product that would fit in all instances. The term has been extended to mean one style or procedure would fit in all related applications. It is an alternative for "Not everyone fits the mold
".&lt;ref name="EET"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
It has been in use for over 5 decades. There are both positive and negative uses of the phrase.

==History of the phrase==
The term ''"one size fits all"'' has been used as a common, cliche phrase for over 5 decades. It was already a popular term, in 1975, when [[Frank Zappa]] recorded the album ''[[One Size Fits All (Frank Zappa album)|One Size Fits All]]''.&lt;ref name="lnk"&gt;For source references, refer to each nearby linked article.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Positive views of the phrase==
There are several positive views of the phrase ''"one size fits all"'':

:* A [[wristwatch]] could be considered as fitting all people.&lt;ref name=lnk/&gt;
:* In women's clothing, a flexible or open garment can be labeled as one-size-fits-all; however, the size is typically a medium size (able to expand), rather than actually fitting petite or extra-large (XL) sizes.
:* A neck chain could be designed to be worn by men or women.
:* [[Bicycle helmet]]s with ring fit systems allow for a single size, also known as [[universal fit]].&lt;ref name=lnk/&gt;&lt;ref name="bhsi"&gt;
  "One Size Fits All Bicycle Helmets", BHSI, April 2009,
  web: [http://www.bhsi.org/onesize.htm BHSI-onesiz].&lt;/ref&gt;
:* In military gear, some items have just one size (but smaller or larger people have already been excluded from military service).
:* Many baseball hats available for commercial purchase are labeled "one-size-fits-all"

==Negative views of the phrase==
There are many negative views of the phrase ''"one size fits all"'' including:
:* Many customers prefer to have custom-tailored clothing.
:* Men's [[Suit (clothing)|dress suit]]s typically have specific sizes for chest &amp; waist measurements.&lt;ref name=lnk/&gt;
:* [[Shoes]] are an example where sizes (and widths) vary depending on the specific person.&lt;ref name=lnk/&gt;
:* For the [[United States|U.S.]] [[GI Bill]] in education, options and coverage will vary depending on each person.&lt;ref name=lnk/&gt;

Politically, the phrase has come to mean that methods of administration or political beliefs in one country should not necessarily be applied to another.

'''''Osama''''' is a 2011 [[alternate history]] [[metafictional]] novel by [[Lavie Tidhar]]. It was first published by [[PS Publishing]].

==Synopsis==
In a world without [[terrorism]], a private detective is hired to locate Mike Longshott, the mysterious author of a popular series of novels about a fictional [[vigilante]] named "[[Osama bin Laden]]".

==Reception==

''Osama'' won the 2012 [[World Fantasy Award for Best Novel]].&lt;ref name=Io9WFA&gt;[https://io9.gizmodo.com/5956915/lavie-tidhars-osama-wins-world-fantasy-award Lavie Tidhar's Osama wins World Fantasy Award], by [[Charlie Jane Anders]], at [[Io9]]; published November 4, 2012; retrieved June 23, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' described it as "offbeat and enigmatic", but with "less than rigorous internal logic".&lt;ref name=PW&gt;[https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-848631-92-2 Osama], reviewed at ''[[Publishers Weekly]]''; published March 3, 2011; retrieved June 23, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Guardian]]'' saw conceptual parallels to [[Philip K. Dick]]'s ''[[The Man in the High Castle]]'', emphasizing that Tidhar's goal is to "show that behind every manufactured enemy, is a real human being".&lt;ref name=Walter&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/11/political-science-fiction-damien-walter The political possibilities of SF], by Damien Walter, in ''[[The Guardian]]''; published October 11, 2011; retrieced June 23, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

in ''[[Locus (magazine)|Locus]]'', [[Gary K. Wolfe]] observed that although Longshott is supposed to be a [[Pulp magazine|pulp fiction]] writer, the excerpts of Longshott's works (depicting various real-world instances of terrorism) "aren’t pulpish at all" but rather are "rendered in a crisp, journalistic prose" — unlike the rest of the novel, which is in a "deliberately pulp-noir style".&lt;ref name=Wolfe&gt;[http://locusmag.com/2011/09/gary-k-wolfe-reviews-lavie-tidhar/ Gary K.

== History ==
{{Expand section|date=December 2011}}
The Phonoscène was a forerunner of sound film.  It combined a chronophone sound recording with a chronograph film shot with actors lip-synching to the sound recording.  The recording and film were synchronized by a mechanism patented by [[Léon Gaumont]] in 1902.  The first Phonoscènes were presented by Gaumont in 1902 in France.&lt;ref name=Schmitt/&gt;

'''Pianwen''' (骈文, literally 'parallel writing') is a highly stylised prose style, prevalent throughout the history of [[Chinese literature]]. Its prominent features lie in its regular lines arranged in couplets; in its early history, these lines were mostly of either four or six characters, and so pianwen are also known as Four-Six Prose (四六文).

While the pianwen form was frequently utilised in official writings, or in describing scenery, its tight restrictions in metrical, tonal and thematic terms restricted its literary development. Subsequent movements, such as the [[Classical Prose Movement]], were a response to these restrictions, but pianwen would continue to be written until the end of the Imperial Chinese era and the widespread use of [[Vernacular Chinese]] in writing.

==Name==

According to the [[Shuowen Jiezi]], the word 'pian' (骈), with a horse radical and the character for 'aligned, in line', originally referred to a two-horse carriage where the horses run alongside each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdic.net/z/28/sw/9A88.htm|title=说文解字骈的解释-说文解字骈的意思-汉典“骈”字的说文解字|first=|last=ZDIC.NET|website=www.zdic.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is analogous to the way pianwen couplets are aligned and parallel each other.

==Characteristics==

The characteristics and restrictions on pianwen prose evolved throughout its long history, but its key feature is the predominance of couplets. The [[Chinese couplet]] form is more tightly restrained than in English; these restrictions include:

*'''Length''': Couplets are almost invariably of the same length. In its early stages, lines of 4 or 6 characters were most prevalent, though 5 or 7, or even more characters also occurred. During the Southern Dynasties period, though, 4 or 6 lines became the standard.
*'''Structure''': The phrase structure within the couplets should match – verbs to verbs, nouns to nouns, and nouns of certain categories together with, or in contrast with, each other. The opening of the ''[[Tengwang Ge Xu]]'', introducing the location of the pavilion, illustrates this:

豫章故郡，&lt;br&gt;
洪都新府。&lt;br&gt;
星分翼轸，&lt;br&gt;
地接衡庐。

"Formerly Yuzhang Commandery, &lt;br&gt;
Currently Hongdu Prefecture. &lt;br&gt;
Among stars, it separates the Wings and Chariot Constellations, &lt;br&gt;
On the ground, it abuts the Heng and Lu Mountains..."

*'''Tone''': As tone became a feature of spoken Chinese during the period when pianwen became widespread, rules began to arise restricting couplets in this regard too, becoming more complex by the Tang Dynasty.

At the same time, the use of uncommon words and allusions to literary or historical events was also emphasised.

==History==

The use of couplets in prose writing, with each line matching in length and reinforcing a certain theme, has ancient roots in Chinese prose; examples can be seen in the [[Book of Documents]], dating from the [[Zhou Dynasty]]. Li Si's ''[[Jianzhuke Shu]]'' (Petition against the Expulsion of Guest-officers), from the [[Warring States period]], also contained couplets.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zgpww.cn/main/home/ns_detail.php?id=191&amp;nowmenuid=12&amp;cpath=&amp;catid=0 (in Chinese)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the writing of essays composed almost entirely of such couplets first arose during the [[Han Dynasty]], and became widespread during the [[Three Kingdoms|Wei]]-[[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin]] period and the [[Northern and Southern Dynasties]]. The pianwen form was especially suited to the descriptive themes common in this period, and during the Southern Dynasties it became obligatory to write court documents in the pianwen form as well; this explicit official backing further spurred the development of pianwen prose as an art form.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zgpww.cn/main/home/ns_detail.php?id=189&amp;nowmenuid=12&amp;cpath=&amp;catid=0&lt;/ref&gt;

A renowned pianwen essay is the Tengwang Ge Xu, written by the early Tang Dynasty poet [[Wang Bo (poet)|Wang Bo]]; by the mid-Tang, however, the Classical Prose Movement headed by [[Han Yu]] and [[Liu Zongyuan]] challenged the pianwen form, advocating a return to the freer, more direct and less restrained prose that prevailed in pre-imperial times. While this movement waned in the late Tang era, it was revived under writers like [[Ouyang Xiu]], [[Zeng Gong]] and [[Su Shi]], and eventually the pianwen form fell out of favour as a literary form from the mid-Song onwards, in favour of the revived "classical style". The preference for freer prose can be seen in the grouping of the [[Eight Great Prose Masters of the Tang and Song]], all of whom were accomplished in the classical style rather than the pianwen form.

During the Qing Dynasty, pianwen again experienced a resurgence, before falling into disuse as Vernacular Chinese overtook Classical Chinese as the standard written form of the language. The characteristics of vernacular Chinese, where many words are formed from more than one character, make it almost impossible to write the strictly parallel couplets demanded by pianwen.

The '''Post-'80''' (also the '''Post-1980''', {{zh|c=八零后|p=bālínghòu}}) is a colloquial term which refers to the generation, especially in urban cities, whose members were born between 1980 and 1989 in [[People's Republic of China|Mainland China]] after the introduction of the [[one-child policy]]. This generation, the first to grow up entirely within the reformist era, currently ranges in age from {{age|1989|12|31}} to {{age|1980|1|1}}, making up a major portion of China's [[Young adult (psychology)|young adult]] demographic.

==Etymology==
In English, this group is also sometimes called [[China]]'s [[Generation Y]] after the use of the term in the book ''China’s Generation Y'' by Michael Stanat in 2005 (though he references the dates 1981–1995&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homabooks.com/general/books/east_asia/china/1029.php|title=China's Generation Y|website=www.homabooks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title= China’s Generation Y: Understanding the Future Leaders of the World’s Next Superpower
|last= Stanat

|isbn=  1-931907-25-0  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*People born in other periods are also named in the same way in [[Mainland China]].
:The '''Post-'70''' is used to describe Chinese people born in the 1970s.
:The '''[[Post-90s|Post-'90]]''' (九零后) means people born from 1990 to 1999 in urban areas. They are usually concerted to [[brain-disabled characters]] and [[non-mainstream]] culture. This generation has similar traits to post-'80 such as being open to [[premarital sex]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-sex/more-than-half-chinese-say-premarital-sex-ok-poll-idUSPEK3401020070612|title=More than half Chinese say premarital sex ok: poll|date=12 June 2007|publisher=|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; but to an even greater degree. It also has a much larger male surplus population than the post-80s, who already have a significant gap between the male and female population. As birth rates rapidly fell between 1990 and 1991 following the [[Tiananmen Square massacre]] this cohort is much smaller than the post-80s generation.
:The '''Pre-'60''' (六零前) means people born before the year 1960.

It is a [[generation]] of approximately 240 million people born between 1980 and 1990, although characteristics of the after-eighty generation have also been seen in those born in the 1990s. Growing up in modern China, this generation has been characterized by its optimism for the future, newfound excitement for [[consumerism]], [[entrepreneurship]], and acceptance of its historic role in transforming modern China into an [[World economy|economic]] [[superpower]].

These people are also distinguished by their increased access to digital media such as [[computer]]s, [[MP3]] players and [[mobile phone]]s. Post-'80ers in China often experience a palpable [[generation gap]] between them and their elders; while their parents lived during the [[Mao Zedong]] era, experienced famine and [[political instability]] and lack proper [[education]] because of the policies set forth under the [[Cultural Revolution]], they live in an environment of tremendous [[economic growth]] and [[social change]], high [[technology]], and rigorous education standards. There is also a significant generation gap between them and Post-'90, who are even more thoroughly entrenched in digitality and capitalism.

A clash between tradition and modern influences is noticeable in purchasing habits, [[career]] pursuits, and daily interaction between child and elders. Furthermore, young adults have been indirectly affected by forced government shutdowns of thousands of [[Internet café|Internet bars]] each year that prevent the excessive use of [[Internet in the People's Republic of China|the Internet]]. Young people are also affected by China's large socioeconomic divide between urban and rural residents and societal problems resulting from [[modernization]].
&lt;!-- (Taken from a similar article, may need to be rephrased)
It is said that they do not feel the inferiority complex of their elders towards the western world and rather have a sense of belonging with that of modern people.  They are also generally proud of their country and their people and can be seen as nationalists.  They are also seen as very independent, driven, and intelligent internet savvy entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;Korea Times, Generation X Shakes China, Sunny Lee, August 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  --&gt;

==Future==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2010}}
The Post-'80 generation illuminates important questions not only about China's future but also those of the United States and the global economy. Several factors that may influence the generation are individualism, [[consumerism]], modernization, and [[technology]].

=="Little emperors"==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2010}}
{{Main|Little Emperor Syndrome}}
{{Wiktionary|little emperor}}
When parents over-indulge their [[only child]], who has no siblings as a result of the [[One Child Policy]], the indulged children may be referred to as "[[Little Emperor Syndrome|little emperors]]" (''xiaohuangdi'' 小皇帝). Many Chinese families have the [[4-2-1 phenomenon|4-2-1]] format: 4 grandparents, 2 parents, one child. Parents and grandparents eat less and spend less money on themselves, only so the youngster could feel physically and mentally strong, focus on one's studies and be successful later on in life.&lt;ref name="Fong"&gt;Vanessa L. Fong. Only Hope: Coming of Age Under China's One-Child Policy. [[Stanford University Press]], 2004, 256 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost all Chinese families usually adopt a set of traditional [[Confuciansim|Confucian]] values when raising their only child.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Because Confucianism considers [[Ren (Confucianism)|''Ren'']] (仁; love and social responsibility) the core [[emotion]] that develops moral conceptions into genuine personal [[motivation]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}, a child who has received too much familial attention but also endured high mental and physical restrictions because the economic future of the family depends on their academic success directly leads to a situation that is often considered in academic and popular discourse as over-indulging the children, in opposition to concepts of ''Ren'' and [[filial piety]] (孝; ''xiao''). There is substantial evidence that many young Chinese feel a heavy burden&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xljk.sdnu.edu.cn/Item/Show.asp?m=1&amp;d=360 Psychological problems in the post-'90 generation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714143226/http://www.xljk.sdnu.edu.cn/Item/Show.asp?m=1&amp;d=360 |date=2015-07-14 }} (Chinese; 90后易出现的心理问题) - Psychology Center of Shandong Normal University&lt;/ref&gt; and a huge responsibility towards their parents, understanding that their performances in school or other domains can be of crucial consequences towards their family.&lt;ref name="Fong"/&gt;

Depending on the specific family conditions and children's mental healthy condition, this burden could lead to a diligent lifestyle by youngsters or to a more rebellious attitude to traditional Confucian codes or not being able to cope with such pressure nor develop self-discipline.&lt;ref name="Thinking"&gt;[http://thinkingchinese.com/index.php?page_id=117 Chinese Singletons - Basic ‘Spoiled’ Related Vocabulary], [http://thinkingchinese.com Thinking Chinese], September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

While being nurtured by parents and relatives gives children some clear advantages and opportunities, the fact that a child doesn't have sibling who 'compete' with him or her in a younger age could also lead to some psychological difficultes as the child grows. "Lacking adapting capabilities" ({{zh|c=没有适应能力|p=méiyǒu shìyìng nénglì}}) is a description which is commonly associated with the new post-'80 generation.&lt;ref name="Thinking"/&gt; Since such children don't need to put any efforts in order to gain parents' attention or to win family resources, they develop no competitive abilities and have weak social skills once they are older and need to be self-sufficient.

Traditionally seen as a rite of passage, marriage has been linked as milestones to adulthood. Yet, the Chinese millennials are late bloomers when it comes to marriage. Although some members of the millennials are well in their 30s, statistics show they are still living their lives as bachelors or bachelorettes.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} 

Having grown up in times of modern [[consumerism]] and popular media, rather than the ideals of the [[Cultural Revolution]], many single-children are inclined to spend large amounts of money on themselves and thus are a cornerstone of retail sales.&lt;ref&gt;NHK World, Japan 7 Days, Matter of Fact: "Cause for Celebration" aired February 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Families which are well-off economically sometimes allow their children to indulge in the new materialistic sphere, while poorer families often still make efforts to keep their children inside the consumers' race, allowing them to purchase new clothes, new cell-phone brands, etc{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}.
&lt;!--
Aside from consumer importance they have been observed as having a different new parenting style of their own, giving their children much more independent freedom.  One opinion for the reason is that they grew up with too much pressure to be the best and want their children to have less pressure and more happiness.&lt;ref&gt;China Daily, 'Spoiled Generation' Paves the Way for New Age Parenting, Guan Xiaomeng, July 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

Their campaigns include the fight for the preservation of [[Lee Tung Street]], the Star Ferry Pier and the Queen's Pier, Choi Yuen Tsuen Village, real political reform (on June 23), and a citizen-oriented [[West Kowloon Cultural District]]. Their discourse mainly develops around themes such as [[anti-colonialism]], [[sustainable development]], and democracy.

==Post-'80 in Canada==

According to the Canadian Census, among the population that was never married, there was a large increase in the proportions for those in their 20s and 30s in 2011 in comparison to 1981. For young adults aged 25 to 29, the proportion who were never married increased from 26.0% of the population in 1981 to close to 73.1% in 2011. Even among individuals in their early 30s, the proportion of men who were never married increased from 15.0% in 1981 to 54.0% in 2011. For women, the increase was from 10.5% in 1981 to 43.4% in 2011.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2227">The '''reveal''' (also known as the '''big reveal''') is a [[plot device]] in [[narrative structure]], and is the exposure to the reader or audience of a previously unseen key character or element of [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] or of the [[performance]].

A reveal is different from Aristotle's ''[[anagnorisis]]'', in which something is revealed to a character rather than to the audience.

==Narrative==
The reveal may result in a [[plot twist]], and could be the key plot turn or unexpected [[Post-credits scene|coda]] in the story – in the [[Mystery fiction|mystery]] [[Literary genre|genre]], for example. It may also be used as a device (particularly in the [[Climax (narrative)|climax]]) in [[stage magic]] by an [[Magic (illusion)|illusionist]] or [[escape artist]].&lt;ref name=Clark_2012&gt;{{cite book |author=Clark, James L. |year=2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mekGtpHh5zUC&amp;pg=PT159&amp;dq=%22the+reveal%22+magic&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Qgz7T-bhF4uZiAfklsmABw&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20reveal%22&amp;f=false |chapter=Performing the Corkscrew |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd |title=Mind Magic and Mentalism for Dummies |accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stage magic ==
In a magician's act, "the reveal" may refer to&lt;ref name=Clark_2012/&gt;
* the normal culmination of a trick
* the unexpected (to the [[audience]]) culmination of the trick
* an explanation of the trick – which itself may be immediately eclipsed by a version of the trick that the first reveal can't explain.

==Film==
''Reveal'' is also used for two distinct cinematographic techniques:
* A slow, theatrically presented image of an important character or item not seen previously in the film;
* A close-up, wide shot, or other unusual camera point-of-view that shows the audience an important visual clue not known to characters in the same scene.

In the sense of first-time showing of a character, a ''reveal'' is similar to, but usually not same as, the [[opening shot]] or [[Establishing shot]] that gives the location or context of a new scene.

'''Robopsychology''' is the study of the personalities and behavior of [[intelligent machine]]s. The term was coined by [[Isaac Asimov]] in the short stories collected in ''[[I, Robot]]'', which featured robopsychologist [[Susan Calvin|Dr. Susan Calvin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Reichert |first=Mickey|title=I, Robot: to obey |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fCxdd2TUcbUC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true|publisher=Penguin Group|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and whose plots largely revolved around the protagonist solving problems connected with intelligent [[robot]] behaviour.

==In real life==

Andrea Kuszewski, a self-described robopsychologist gives the following examples of potential responsibilities for a robopsychologist in [[Discover (magazine)|Discover]].

*"Assisting in the design of [[cognitive architectures]]
*Developing appropriate lesson plans for teaching  AI targeted skills
*Create guides to help the AI through the learning process
*Address any [[maladaptive]] machine behaviors
*Research the nature of ethics and how it can be taught and/or reinforced
*Create new and innovative therapy approaches for the domain of computer-based intelligences"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/crux/2012/02/07/i-robopsychologist-part-1-why-robots-need-psychologists/#.WgC-i1S0PIU |title=I, Robopsychologist, Part 1: Why Robots Need Psychologists |publisher=[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
There is a robospychology research division at [[Ars Electronica Futurelab]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-movies-can-help-robots-and-people-get-along-1489372002&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==
The stories also introduced Asimov's famous [[Three Laws of Robotics]]. Another robopsychologist mentioned by name is Clinton Madarian, who is introduced as being Susan Calvin's successor in the story "[[Feminine Intuition]]".

As described by Asimov, robopsychology appears to be a mixture of detailed [[mathematics|mathematical analysis]] and traditional [[psychology]], applied to robots. Human psychology is also a part, covering human interaction with robots. This includes the "[[Frankenstein complex]]" – the irrational fear that robots (or other creations) will turn on their creator.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5653">Artificial humans and autonomous artificial servants have a long history in human culture, though the term [[Robot]] and its modern literary conception as a mobile machine equipped with an advanced [[artificial intelligence]] are more fairly recent. The literary role of artificial life has evolved over time: early myths present animated objects as instruments of divine will, later stories treat their attempted creation as a blasphemy with inevitable consequences, and modern tales range from apocalyptic warnings against blind technological progress to explorations of the ethical questions raised by the possibility of sentient machines.

Recently, a popular overview of the history of [[android (robot)|android]]s, [[robots]], [[cyborgs]] and [[replicants]] from antiquity to the present has been published.&lt;ref name="Glaser/Rossbach"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Glasjer, Horst Albert|first=Rossbach, Sabine|title=The Artificial Human|publisher=[[Peter Lang (publishing company)|Peter Lang]]|location=Frankfurt/M., Bern, New York|year=2011|isbn=978-3631578087}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treated fields of knowledge are: [[history of technology]], [[history of medicine]], [[philosophy]], [[literature]], [[film]] and [[art history]], the range of topics discussed is worldwide.

==Early uses==
The earliest examples were all presented as the results of divine intervention and include: The dry bones that came to life in the Book of Ezekiel (Chapter 37); three-legged self-navigating tables created by the god Hephaestus (Iliad xviii); and the statue Galatea, brought to life by the prayers of her creator Pygmalion.

More recent humaniform examples include the brooms from the legend of the sorcerer's apprentice derived from a tale by [[Lucian of Samosata]] in the 1st century AD, the Jewish legend of the [[golem]] created like Adam from clay, and Mary Shelley's ''[[Frankenstein]]''. These tales include an indictment of human folly at presuming to take on the role of creator.

Notable mechanical representations of humans include the life-sized singing puppet ''Olimpia'' in the short story "[[The Sandman (short story)|The Sandman]]" by [[E.T.A. Hoffman]] in 1816 and a bipedal anthropomorphic mechanism in ''[[The Steam Man of the Prairies]]'' by [[Edward S. Ellis]] in 1868.&lt;ref&gt;37 original stories about anthropomorphic and zoomorphic machines appeared in dime novels between 1868 and 1899. See Dime Novel Robots by Joseph A. Lovece. https://www.amazon.com/Dime-Novel-Robots-1868-1899-Bibliography/dp/1511578661/&lt;/ref&gt; These examples are stories about human-controlled mechanisms without autonomy or self-awareness.

In [[Lyman Frank Baum]]'s [[children's novel]] ''[[Ozma of Oz]]'', the first-ever introduction of a humanoid-appearance mechanical man that would satisfy the later "humanoid robot" definition occurred in 1907 - some fifteen years before the word "robot" was coined - with [[Tik-Tok (Oz)|Tik-Tok]], powered with a trio of clockwork movements for his thinking, movement and speech, none of which he could wind up himself.

==The modern "Robot"==
The first use of the word ''[[Robot]]'' was in [[Karel Čapek]]'s play ''[[R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)]]'' written in 1920 and first performed in [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1921, in [[New York City]] in 1922 and an [[English language|English]] edition published in 1923. Artificial living beings are created from a chemical substitute for protoplasm but over time they learn about violence from their human creators and begin to revolt. The play ends on an optimistic, even spiritual, note as the artificial biology leads a male and female robot to fall in love and inherit the earth.

While Karel Čapek's play introduced the word "robot" into languages around the globe but he later wrote a letter to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] of etymology in which he named his brother, painter and writer [[Josef Čapek]], as its true inventor. In an article in the Czech [[Lidové noviny]] in 1933 he also explains that he originally wanted to call the creatures "laboři" from the Latin word ''labor''. Karel found the word too bookish and sought advice from Josef who suggested to call them "robots". The word, which is always capitalized in Čapek's play, derives from ''robota'' which means "drudgery" in [[Czech language|Czech]] and means "work" in [[Slovakian language|Slovak]].)

The theme of robots has been picked up by science fiction writers and many volumes are focused on robots and their interaction with the human species. Of particular note is the work of [[Isaac Asimov]] as a large part of his work centers on robots. Asimov is particularly known for his creation of the ''[[Three laws of robotics]]'' which he uses in his stories as both to define his robots and how these interact within the worlds he creates.&lt;!--''Technically no - it does not sense nor have axes of movement nor is it autononmous - it does what it is told.'':  A modern type of robot used today is the [[computer]]. No need for a robot to be autonomous. Most extant robots are not. Computers still don't really qualify though, since they normally don't react to or interact with their environment. --&gt;

'''Samuel Plimsoll''' (10 February 1824 – 3 June 1898) was an English                                          politician and social reformer, now best remembered for having devised the [[Plimsoll line]] (a line on a ship's hull indicating the maximum safe draft, and therefore the minimum [[freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]] for the vessel in various operating conditions).

==Early life==
Samuel Plimsoll was born in [[Bristol]] and soon moved to [[Whiteley Wood Hall]], [[Sheffield]], also spending part of his childhood in [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith, Cumberland]].  Leaving school at an early age, he became a clerk at Rawson's Brewery, and rose to be manager.

In 1853, he attempted to become a coal merchant in London. 
He failed and was reduced to destitution. 
He himself told how for a time he lived in a common lodging for seven shillings and two pence a week.

Through this experience, he learnt to sympathise with the struggles of the poor, and when his good fortune returned, he resolved to devote his time to improving their condition.

His efforts were directed especially against what were known as "[[coffin ship (insurance)|coffin ships]]": unseaworthy and overloaded vessels, often heavily insured, in which unscrupulous owners risked the lives of their crews.

==Political career==
In 1867, Plimsoll was elected as the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] Member of Parliament for [[Derby (UK Parliament constituency)|Derby]], and endeavoured in vain to pass a bill dealing with the subject of a safe load line on ships. The main problem was the number of powerful ship-owning MPs in Parliament.

In 1872, he published a work entitled ''Our Seamen'', which became well known throughout the country.  Accordingly, on Plimsoll's motion in 1873, a Royal Commission was appointed, and in 1875 a government bill was introduced, which Plimsoll, though regarding it as inadequate, resolved to accept.

On 22 July, the Prime Minister, [[Benjamin Disraeli]], announced that the bill would be dropped. Plimsoll lost his self-control, applied the term "villains" to members of the House, and shook his fist in the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker]]'s face.&lt;ref&gt;http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1875/jul/22/parliament-breach-of-order-mr-plimsoll&lt;/ref&gt;

Disraeli moved that he be reprimanded, but on the suggestion of [[Spencer Compton Cavendish|Lord Hartington]] agreed to adjourn the matter for a week to allow Plimsoll time for thought.
[[Image:load line.jpg|thumb|right|Load Line Mark and Lines and Timber Load Line Mark and Lines for power driven merchant vessels]]
Eventually Plimsoll made an apology. Many people, however, shared his view that the bill had been stifled by the pressure of the shipowners, and popular feeling forced the government to pass a bill which in the following year was amended into the Merchant Shipping Act.
[[Image:Memorial To Samuel Plimsoll.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Memorial to Samuel Plimsoll on [[Victoria Embankment]], London]]
This gave stringent powers of inspection to the [[Board of Trade]], and the mark that indicates the safe limit to which a ship may be loaded became generally known as [[Waterline|Plimsoll's mark or line]].

Plimsoll was re-elected for Derby at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1880|general election of 1880]] by a great majority, but gave up his seat to [[William Vernon Harcourt (politician)|William Vernon Harcourt]], believing that the latter, as Home Secretary, could advance sailors' interests more effectively than any private member.

Offered a seat by 30 constituencies, Plimsoll was an unsuccessful candidate in [[Sheffield Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Sheffield Central]] in [[United Kingdom general election, 1885|1885]]. He did not re-enter the house, and later became estranged from the Liberal leaders by what he regarded as their breach of faith in neglecting the question of shipping reform.

He was for some years the honorary president of the [[National Union of Seamen|National Sailors' and Firemen's Union]], and drew attention to the horrors of the cattle-ships, where animals were transported under appalling and over-crowded conditions.

==Later life==
Later, he visited the United States to try to secure the adoption of a less bitter tone towards England in the historical textbooks used in American schools. 
He died in [[Folkestone]] on 3 June 1898, and is buried in St Martin's churchyard, [[Cheriton, Kent]].

==Family==
Plimsoll married his first wife, Eliza Ann, daughter of Hugh Railton of [[Chapeltown, Sheffield|Chapeltown]], near [[Sheffield]], in 1858. In Census 1871 they were enumerated in Hastings where Eliza Ann is recorded as being blind in her right eye and deaf in her left ear. She died in Australia in 1882. There were no children by this marriage. He married his second wife, Harriet Frankish, daughter of Mr. Joseph Armitage Wade, J.P., of Hull and [[Hornsea]], in 1885. By this marriage there were six children, of whom a son, Samuel Richard Cobden Plimsoll, and two daughters survived him.{{sfn|Orme|1901}}

In 1873, the '''''Samuel Plimsoll''''', an iron hulled full-rigged merchant sailing ship, was launched at the shipyard of Walter Hood &amp; Co. in Aberdeen, Scotland for the Aberdeen White Star Line (G. Thompson &amp; Co.).  She was assigned the official British Reg. No. 65097 and the signal MKDH.  In 1899, she caught fire in the [[Thames River]] and had to be scuttled, but was refloated and repaired in 1900.  In 1902, she was severely dismasted and damaged on voyage to Port Chalmers, Australia. Towed to Sydney and subsequently to Fremantle, she was reduced to hulk status the following year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bruzelius.info/Nautica/Ships/Merchant/Sail/S/Samuel_Plimsoll(1873).html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.pacific.net.au/~hannahhome/ships/samuelplimsoll.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821134521/http://home.pacific.net.au/~hannahhome/ships/samuelplimsoll.html |archivedate=21 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s, [[Plimsoll shoe]]s were named for their similarity in appearance to the Plimsoll line on boats.

In Whitehall Garden, a Victoria Embankment garden, there is a monument to Samuel Plimsoll in front of the railings.

British writer [[Nicolette Jones]] published ''The Plimsoll Sensation'', a highly acclaimed biography – getting the idea for it from living in 1995 in Plimsoll Road in [[Finsbury Park]], north London, but knowing hardly anything about whom it was named after.

Samuel Plimsoll appears in the third series of the BBC historical television drama ''[[The Onedin Line]]'', portrayed by actor David Garfield.

{{Anthropology of religion}}
The '''slametan''' (or '''selametan''', '''slamatan''', and '''selamatan''') is the communal [[Banquet|feast]] from [[Java]], symbolizing the social unity of those participating in it. [[Clifford Geertz]] considered it the core [[ritual]] in [[Kebatinan|Javanese religion]], in particular the [[abangan]] variant.&lt;ref name="G11"&gt;Geertz, 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The feast is common among the closely related [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] and [[Madurese people]].

A slametan can be given to celebrate almost any occurrence, including [[birth]], [[marriage]], [[death]], [[relocating|moving to a new house]], and so forth. Depending on the intention, the mood and emphasis may vary somewhat, but the main structure is the same.&lt;ref name="G11"/&gt; Geertz categorizes them into four main types:&lt;ref&gt;Geertz, 30.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Those relating to the crises of life: birth, [[circumcision]], marriage, and death
*Those associated with events of the [[Islamic calendar]]
*The ''bersih désa'' ("cleaning of the village"), concerned with the social integration of the village
*Those held irregularly depending on unusual occurrences: departing for a long trip, moving residence, changing personal names, illness, sorcery, and so on

The ceremony takes its name from the [[Javanese language|Javanese]] word ''slamet'', from [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: ''[[S-L-M|salam]]'', which refers to a peaceful state of equanimity, in which nothing will happen. This is what the host intends for both himself and his guests, by experiencing the egalitarian structure of the slametan and the petitions of supernatural protection from spirits.&lt;ref&gt;Geertz, 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Geertz's fieldwork in [[Mojokuto]] in the 1950s, he found that costs of slametans varied from 3 to 5,000 [[Indonesian rupiah]]s, depending on the type and the relative wealth of the host.

==Procedure==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM 'Een religieuze maaltijd 'selamatan' in Tjibodas' TMnr 10003361.jpg|thumb|A Slametan in a mosque in [[Cibodas]], with [[tumpeng]] as its main menu. ca. 1907.]]
Slametans are generally held in the evening, after [[Maghrib|evening prayer]] is finished. The date is determined either by the occurrence it is celebrating (for births and deaths, for example), or on auspicious days in the [[Javanese calendar]]. The guests, always men, are always close neighbors, and the selection of guests is based entirely on proximity, and not whether they are friends or relatives. They are called by a messenger of the host (usually a child of his) only five or ten minutes before the ''slametan'' is to begin, and they must drop whatever they are doing to come.&lt;ref name="G12"&gt;Geertz, 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

When they arrive, the guests sit on floor mats around the food which has been placed in the center, while incense fills the room. The ceremony begins with a formal speech (''udjub'') in high [[Javanese language|Javanese]]. The speech thanks the attendees for coming, presents the reason for the slametan, announces his intentions and petitions the spirits to secure for himself and his guests a state of equanimity (''slamet'', hence the name of the ritual), and finally apologizes for any errors in his speech and the humble inadequacy of the food. During pauses in the speech, the audience responds with solemn "inggih" ("yes").&lt;ref&gt;Geertz, 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the speech, somebody present gives an Arabic chant-prayer. Many will not know how, but the host makes sure that someone there had attended a [[pesantren|religious school]] (usually a [[kyai]]); for special occasions he may even invite the village religious specialist (the ''[[Javanese people#Villages|modin]]''). Fragments of the [[Koran]], especially the [[al-Fatiha]], are most commonly used, although special prayers may be used if they are known. At pauses the audience says "amen" (''amin''). The prayer leader receives a small payment (''wadjib'').&lt;ref name="G13"&gt;Geertz, 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

At last, the food is served. While the ceremony is strictly for men, the food preparation falls upon the women in the family, who for larger ceremonies may draw on kin to assist in the preparation.&lt;ref name="G12"/&gt; Each guest receives a cup of tea and a banana-leaf dish containing each sort of food in the center of the room. The food is fancier than average, and each variety has a symbolic meaning, which is sometimes explained in the speech. The host himself does not eat, nor does he serve the food, which one or two of the guests do. When everybody has a dish, the host invites them to eat, which they do quickly without speaking. After a few minutes, and before eating most of the food, the guests excuse themselves, and finish eating the food in their own homes, with their own wives and children. The whole ceremony usually lasts only ten or fifteen minutes.&lt;ref name="G13"/&gt;

==Timing and characteristics==
[[File:Tumpeng Slametan IGDA.JPG|thumb|[[Tumpeng]] is commonly the main menu in a slametan.]]
===Life cycle events===
Around [[birth]], there are four major slametans and a number of minor ones. The four major ones are:&lt;ref&gt;Geertz, 38, 47.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Tingkeban'', at about seven months of pregnancy (held only for the first child of either the mother or father)
* ''Babaran'' or ''brokokan'', at the birth itself
* ''Pasaran'', five days after birth, including the naming of the child
* ''Pitonan'', seven "months" after birth (a month being the 35-day cycle of the Javanese calendar)

The [[circumcision]] slametan (''islamam'' or ''sunatan'', held for boys between the ages of ten and fourteen) and the [[wedding]] slametan (''kepanggihan'') are similar in their ceremony and foods offered, and can be seen as coming-of-age ceremonies for boys and girls, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Geertz, 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Funeral]]s (''layatan'') generally take place as soon as possible after the death, and inevitably involve the religious specialist (''modin'') of the village. Slametans are held the day of the death, and then repeated in increasing size (both in number of guests and length of the chant) three, seven, forty, and 100 days after the death, the first and second anniversaries, and 1000 days after the death. The final one is the most elaborate, and is thought to mark the point when the body has completely decayed to dust.&lt;ref&gt;Geertz, 58-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic feasts===
The most important of the calendrical slametans are for the [[Mawlid|Prophet's birthday]] (''Muludan'', on 12 [[Rabi' al-awwal]]) and near the end of [[Ramadan]] (''Maleman''). Other notable holidays infrequently have slametans, and [[Satu Suro]], the New Year's Day (1 [[Muharram]]) is celebrated by those who are self-consciously anti-Muslim. Because these dates are shared by everybody, it is common to attend slametans for many of one's neighbors in succession. For this reason, they tend to be relatively small, and particularly based on the principle of inviting neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;Geertz, 77-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Community feasts===
The ''bersih désa'' is always held in [[Dhu al-Qi'dah]] (''Sela''), the eleventh month, on different days according to village tradition. This slametan is given at the place of burial of the ''[[hyang|dhanyang]] désa'', the guardian spirit of the village. In [[santri]] villages, it may take place at a [[mosque]] and consist entirely of Muslim prayers. For this type of slametan, all families in the village are expected to contribute food, with the adult head of each family obliged to attend.&lt;ref&gt;Geertz, 81-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal feasts===
Geertz's final category of slametans, intermittently occurring and dependent on a specific situation, are somewhat less frequent and tend to be smaller affairs. Reasons for holding these slametans include changing residences, changing names, going on a journey, bad dreams (it can prevent the fearful event), prevention or encouragement of rain, anniversaries of clubs and organizations, sorcery, healing, and others.&lt;ref&gt;Geertz, 83-84.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10849">'''Speech acquisition''' focuses on the development of [[spoken language]] by a child.  Speech consists of an organized set of sounds or phonemes that are used to convey meaning while language is an arbitrary association of symbols used according to prescribed rules to convey meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Bernthal, J.E., Bankson, N.W., &amp; Flipsen, P. (2009) Articulation and Phonological Disorders: Speech Sound Disorders in Children. (6th edition). Boston, MA: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt;
While [[grammatical]] and [[syntactic]] learning can be seen as a part of [[language acquisition]], speech acquisition focuses on the development of [[speech perception]] and [[speech production]] over the first years of a child's lifetime.  There are several models to explain the norms of speech sound or phoneme acquisition in children.

== Development of speech perception ==
Sensory learning concerning acoustic speech signals already starts during pregnancy.  Hepper and Shahidullah (1992) described the progression of fetal response to different pure tone frequencies.  They suggested fetuses respond to 500 Hertz (Hz) at 19 weeks gestation, 250&amp;nbsp;Hz and 500&amp;nbsp;Hz at 27 weeks gestation and finally respond to 250, 500, 1000, 3000&amp;nbsp;Hz between 33 and 35 weeks gestation.&lt;ref&gt;Hepper, P. G., &amp; Shahidullah, B. S. (1994). Development of fetal hearing. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition, 71(2), F81–F87.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lanky and Williams (2005)&lt;ref&gt;Lasky, R.E. &amp; Trickey, A.W. (2005). The Development of the Auditory System from Conception to Term. NeoReviews 6(3). DOI: 10.1542/neo.6-3-e141.&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that fetuses could respond to pure tone stimuli of 500&amp;nbsp;Hz as early as 16 weeks.

The newborn is already capable of discerning many phonetic contrasts. This capability may be innate. 
Speech perception becomes language-specific for vowels at around 6 months, for sound combinations at around 9 months and for language-specific consonants at around 11 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nrn1533 |pmid=15496861 |title=Early language acquisition: Cracking the speech code |journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience |volume=5 |issue=11 |pages=831–43 |year=2004 |last1=Kuhl |first1=Patricia K. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also important that a newborn is already capable of detecting typical word stress patterns around the age of 8 months.

As an infant grows into a child their ability to discriminate between speech sounds should increase.  Rvachew (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Rvachew, S. (2007). Phonological Processing and Reading in Children With Speech Sound Disorders. American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology. 16. 260-270. https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9b7e/1674775fc3775c9c1a1da4b57c1e0ed2e821.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; described three developmental stages in which a child recognizes or discerns adult-like, phonological and articulatory representations of sounds.In the first stage, the child is generally unaware of phonological contrast and can produce sounds that are acoustically and perceptually similar.  In the second stage the child is aware of phonological contrasts and can produce acoustically different variations imperceptible to adult listeners. Finally, in the third stage, children become aware of phonological contrasts and produce different sounds that are perceptually and acoustically accurate to an adult production.

It is suggested that a child's perceptual capabilities continue to develop for many years. Hazan and Barrett (2000)&lt;ref&gt;Hazan, V. &amp; Barrett, S.(2000) Development of phonemic categorization in children aged 6-12. Journal of Phonetics 28(4):377-396 · https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222834995_The_development_of_phonemic_categorization_in_children_aged_6-12&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that this development can cotton into late childhood; 6 to 12 year old children showed increasing mastery of discriminating synthesized differences in place, manner, and voicing of speech sounds with out yet achieving adult-like accuracy in their own production.

== Typologies of infant vocalization==

Infants are born with the ability to vocalize, most notably through crying.  As they grow and develop, infants add more sounds to their inventory. 
There are two primary typologies of infant vocalizations. Typology 1: Stark Assessment of Early Vocal Development&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/02699200500211451 |pmid=16728333 |pmc=3412408 |title=Assessing vocal development in infants and toddlers |journal=Clinical Linguistics &amp; Phonetics |volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=351–69 |year=2009 |last1=Nathani |first1=Suneeti |last2=Ertmer |first2=David J. |last3=Stark |first3=Rachel E. }}&lt;/ref&gt; consists of 5 phases. 
#Reflexive (0 to 2 months of age) consisting of crying, fussing, and vegetative sounds
#Control of phonation (1 to 4 months of age) consonant-like sounds, clicks, and raspberry sound
#Expansion (3 to 8 months of age) isolated vowels, two or more vowels in a row, and squeals
#Basic canonical syllables (5 to 10 months of age) – a consonant vowel (CV) combination, often repeated (e.g. ba ba ba ba).
#Advanced forms (9 to 18 months of age) complex combinations of differing constant-vowel combinations (CVC) and jargon.

Typology 2: Oller's typology of infant phonations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Oller |first1=J. W. |last2=Oller |first2=S. D. |last3=Badon |first3=L. C. |year=2006 |title=Milestones: Normal Speech and Language Development Across the Life Span |publisher=Plural Publishing |location=San Diego }}{{page needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; consists primarily of 2 phases with several substages.  The 2 primary phases include Non-speech-like vocalizations and Speech-like vocalizations.  Non-speech-like vocalizations include a. vegetative sounds such as burping and b. fixed vocal signals like crying or laughing.  Speech-like vocalizations consist of a. quasi-vowels, b. primitive articulation, c. expansion stage and d. canonical babbling.

== Speech sound normative data ==

Knowing when a speech sound should be accurately produced helps parents and professionals determine when child may have an articulation disorder. There have been two traditional methods used to compare a child's articulation of speech sounds to chronological age. The first is comparing the number of correct responses on a standardized articulation test with the normative data for a given age on the same test.  This allows evaluators to see how well a child is producing sounds compared to their same aged peers.  The second method consists of comparing an individual sound a child produces with developmental norms for that individual sound. The second method can be difficult when considering the differing normative data and other factors that affect typical speech development. 
Many norms are based on age expectations in which a majority of children of a certain age are accurately producing a sound (75% or 90% depending on the study). Using the results from Sander (1972),&lt;ref&gt;Sander, E. K. (1972). When are speech sounds learned? Journal of Speech and Hearing Disorders, 37(1), 55–63.&lt;/ref&gt;  Templin (1957),&lt;ref&gt;Templin, M. (1957). Certain language skills in children: Their development and interrelationships. Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  and Wellman, Case, Mengert, &amp; Bradbury, (1931),&lt;ref&gt;Wellman, B., Case, I., Mengert, I., &amp; Bradbury, D. (1931). Speech sounds of young children. University of Iowa Study, Child Welfare, 5(2), 1–82.&lt;/ref&gt; the American Speech-Language Hearing Association suggests the following: Sounds mastered by age 3 include /p, m, h, n, w, b/; by age 4 /k, g, d, f, y/; by age 6 /t, ŋ, r, l/; by age 7 /tʃ, ʃ, j, θ/. and by age 8 /s, z, v, ð, ʒ/.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asha.org/uploadedFiles/ASHA/Practice_Portal/Clinical_Topics/Late_Language_Emergence/Consonant-Acquisition-Chart.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early, Middle, and Late 8s===

Shriberg (1993)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1044/jshr.3601.105 |pmid=8450654 |title=Four New Speech and Prosody-Voice Measures for Genetics Research and Other Studies in Developmental Phonological Disorders |journal=Journal of Speech Language and Hearing Research |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=105–40 |year=1993 |last1=Shriberg |first1=Lawrence D. }}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a model for speech sound acquisition known as the Early, Middle, and Late 8 based on 64 children with speech delays ages 3 to 6 years. Shriberg proposed that there were three stages of phoneme development. Using a profile of "consonant mastery" he developed the following:

* Early 8 – /m, b, j, n, w, d, p, h/
* Middle 8 – /t, ŋ, k, g, f, v, tʃ, dʒ/
* Late 8 – /ʃ, θ, s, z, ð, l, r, ʒ/

Founded in 1989, by Burkinabe sculptor Siriky Ky,&lt;ref name=beauceky&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beauceart.com/fr/siriki_ky|title=SIRIKI KY|website=http://www.beauceart.com/|publisher=Beauce Art, L'International de sculptures|accessdate=May 13, 2015|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; the symposium takes place on a site located about 35&amp;nbsp;km from [[Ouagadougou]], in the province of [[Oubritenga]]. Invited sculptors create their works ''in-situ'' using granite from the site. Some works combine local granite and other materials such as metal.

The first iteration of the biennal symposium opened January 13, 1989, gathering 18 sculptors from 13 countries.&lt;ref name=rivages&gt;{{cite web|title=Le site de Laongo – symposium international de sculptures de granit|url=http://rivagesdumamouausahel.over-blog.com/article-site-de-laongo-88387538.html|website=Rivages association de solidarité internationale – Burkina Faso – boucle du Mouhoun  – du Mamou au Sahel de Giou à Tougan Rivages association de solidarité internationale|publisher=Rivages association de solidarité internationale – Burkina Faso – boucle du Mouhoun  – du Mamou au Sahel de Giou à Tougan Rivages association de solidarité internationale|accessdate=May 13, 2015|language=French|date=July 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tenth edition took place over twenty days in May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ouedraogo|first1=Privat|title=Burkina Faso: Symposium sculpture sur granit de Laongo – Bientôt une nouvelle dimension à l'événement|url=http://fr.allafrica.com/stories/201205220802.html|accessdate=May 13, 2015|work=Sidwaya Quotidien|date=May 21, 2012|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2010, the legal status of the site was unclear, with overlaps and gaps in jurisdictions.&lt;ref name=memoirestatus&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ouédraogo|first1=Zoéwendsaongo Fabrice|title=Analyse de la situation juridique du site de sculpture sur granite de Laongo|date=2011|publisher=Ecole Nationale d'Administration et de Magistrature|location=Burkina Faso|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Māori mythology|Māori tradition]], '''''Tauira''''' was one of the great [[Māori migration canoes|ocean-going, voyaging canoes]] that was used in the migrations that settled [[New Zealand]]. ''Tauira'' was captained by Mōtataumaitawhiti and landed at [[Te Kaha]] in the eastern [[Bay of Plenty]]. [[Panenehu]] and [[Te Whānau-a-Apanui]] [[iwi]] trace their ancestry back to Tauira.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.teara.govt.nz/NewZealanders/MaoriNewZealanders/CanoeTraditions/4/en Te Ara: Encyclopedia of New Zealand&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2078">'''Temporary laws''', '''temporary legislation''' or '''sunset legislation''' are [[laws]] whose duration is limited at the time of enactment. Temporary laws are often used to adapt for unusual or peculiar situations. Clauses limiting the duration of such laws are often called "sunset" clauses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/t/temporary-statue/|title=Temporary Statue Law and Legal Definition - USLegal, Inc.|first=US Legal,|last=Inc.|website=definitions.uslegal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Temporary laws are commonly given temporal validity by the inclusion of an expiration date at which the law ceases to be in effect unless it is extended. But a law can also acquire temporal status by stipulating that it only applies to a certain event. For example, only to the next election or only for victims of a named catastrophe.

Temporary laws are favored by adherents of "[[Experimentalist governance]]" because it allows policy makers to conduct experiments and evaluate the effects of introducing legislation.

Temporary laws are often easier to pass since they last for a shorter time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2159549|title=Law and the Limits of Government: Temporary versus Permanent Legislation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Temporary law should not be confused with ''ratione temporis'' or ''temporal jurisdiction'' which refers to the jurisdiction of a ''court'' of law in relation to the passage of time. 

== Examples ==
Some examples of temporary laws:
* [[May Laws]], enacted in [[Russia]] in 1882. Originally intended to expire after one year but were extended indefinitely.
* [[Tehcir Law]], enacted by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1915 authorized the [[ethnic cleansing]] of the empire's [[Armenians|Armenian]] population. 
* [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]] passed in 1994 contained several provisions that were temporary in nature.
* [[Patriot Act]], enacted in the [[United States]] in 2001.
* [[Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law]], enacted in [[Israel]] in 2003.

'''''The Chronicles of Narnia''''' is a [[heptalogy|series of seven]] [[fantasy novels]] by [[C. S. Lewis]]. It is considered a classic of [[children's literature]] and is the author's best-known work, having sold over 100 million copies in 47 languages.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/9694561/CS-Lewis-Chronicles-of-Narnia-author-honoured-in-Poets-corner.html "CS Lewis, Chronicles of Narnia author, honoured in Poets' corner"]. The Telegraph. Retrieved 24 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-20426778 "CS Lewis to be honoured in Poets' Corner"]. BBC News. Retrieved 23 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Written by Lewis, illustrated by [[Pauline Baynes]], and originally published in London between 1950 and 1956, ''The Chronicles of Narnia'' has been [[Adaptations of The Chronicles of Narnia|adapted several times]], complete or in part, for radio, television, the stage, and film.

Set in the [[Fictional universe|fictional realm]] of [[Narnia (world)|Narnia]], a fantasy world of magic, mythical beasts, and talking animals, the series narrates the adventures of various children who play central roles in the unfolding history of that world. Except in ''[[The Horse and His Boy]]'', the [[protagonist]]s are all children from the real world, magically transported to Narnia, where they are called upon by the lion [[Aslan]] to protect Narnia from evil and restore the throne to its rightful line. The books span the entire history of Narnia, from its creation in ''[[The Magician's Nephew]]'' to its eventual destruction in ''[[The Last Battle]]''.

Inspiration for the series was taken from multiple sources; in addition to adapting numerous traditional [[Christianity|Christian]] themes, Lewis freely borrowed characters and ideas from [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]] as well as from traditional British and Irish [[fairy tales]].

The books have profoundly influenced adult and children's fantasy literature since [[World War II]]. Lewis's exploration of themes not usually present in children's literature, such as religion, as well as the books' perceived treatment of issues including race and gender, has caused some controversy.

==Background and conception==

Although Lewis originally conceived what would become ''The Chronicles of Narnia'' in 1939&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Lancelyn Green]] &amp; [[Walter Hooper]], ''C. S. Lewis: A Biography: fully revised &amp; expanded edition.'' (2002), pp. 302–307. {{ISBN|0-00-715714-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the picture of a Faun with parcels in a snowy wood has a history dating to 1914),&lt;ref name="OS53"&gt;C. S. Lewis. ''On Stories: And Other Essays on Literature''. 1982, p. 53. {{ISBN|0-15-668788-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; he did not finish writing the first book ''[[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'' until 1949. ''[[The Magician's Nephew]]'', the penultimate book to be published, but the last to be written, was completed in 1954. Lewis did not write the books in the order in which they were originally published, nor were they published in their current chronological order of presentation.&lt;ref name="Ford"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ford|first1=Paul|title=Companion to Narnia: A Complete Guide to the Magical World of C.S. Lewis's The Chronicles of Narnia|date=2005|publisher=Harper|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-0-06-079127-8|edition=Revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|24}} The original illustrator, Pauline Baynes, created pen and ink drawings for the ''Narnia'' books that are still used in the editions published today. Lewis was awarded the 1956 [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]] for ''The Last Battle'', the final book in the saga. The series was first referred to as ''The Chronicles of Narnia'' by fellow children's author [[Roger Lancelyn Green]] in March 1951, after he had read and discussed with Lewis his recently completed fourth book ''[[The Silver Chair]]'', originally entitled ''Night under Narnia''.&lt;ref&gt;Green &amp; Hooper, 2002, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewis described the origin of ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' in an essay entitled "It All Began with a Picture":
:The ''Lion'' all began with a picture of a [[Faun]] carrying an umbrella and parcels in a snowy wood. This picture had been in my mind since I was about sixteen. Then one day, when I was about forty, I said to myself: 'Let's try to make a story about it.'&lt;ref name="OS53" /&gt;
Shortly before the start of World War II, [[Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II|many children were evacuated]] to the English countryside in anticipation of attacks on London and other major urban areas by Nazi Germany. As a result, on 2 September 1939, three school girls named Margaret, Mary and Katherine&lt;ref&gt;Ford, 2005, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; came to live at [[The Kilns]] in [[Risinghurst]], Lewis's home three miles east of [[Oxford]] city centre. Lewis later suggested that the experience gave him a new appreciation of children and in late September&lt;ref&gt;Owen Dudley Edwards. ''British Children's Fiction in the Second World War.'' 2007, p. 129. {{ISBN|978-0-7486-1650-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; he began a children's story on an odd sheet of paper which has survived as part of another manuscript:
:This book is about four children whose names were Ann, Martin, Rose and Peter. But it is most about Peter who was the youngest. They all had to go away from London suddenly because of Air Raids, and because Father, who was in the Army, had gone off to the War and Mother was doing some kind of war work. They were sent to stay with a kind of relation of Mother's who was a very old professor who lived all by himself in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Green &amp; Hooper, 2002, p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt;

In "It All Began With a Picture" C. S. Lewis continues:
:At first I had very little idea how the story would go. But then suddenly Aslan came bounding into it. I think I had been having a good many dreams of lions about that time. Apart from that, I don't know where the Lion came from or why he came. But once he was there, he pulled the whole story together, and soon he pulled the six other Narnian stories in after him.&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Lewis. ''On Stories: And Other Essays on Literature''. 1982, p. xix &amp; 53. {{ISBN|0-15-668788-7}}. "It All Began with a Picture" is reprinted there from the ''Radio Times'', 15 July 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Lewis pled ignorance about the source of his inspiration for Aslan, Jared Lobdell, digging into Lewis’s history to explore the making of the series, suggests Charles Williams’s ''The Place of the Lion'' as a likely influence.&lt;ref name="Lobdell, 2016"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lobdell |first1=Jared |title=Eight Children in Narnia: The Making of a Children's Story |date=2016 |publisher=Open Court |location=Chicago, IL |isbn=978-0-8126-9901-2 |page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The manuscript for ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' was complete by the end of March 1949.

===Name===
The name ''Narnia'' is based on [[Narni]], Italy, written in [[Latin]] as ''Narnia''. Green wrote:
:When Walter Hooper asked [C. S. Lewis] where he found the word 'Narnia', Lewis showed him Murray's Small Classical Atlas, ed. G.B. Grundy (1904), which he acquired when he was reading the classics with Mr Kirkpatrick at Great Bookham [1914–1917]. On plate 8 of the Atlas is a map of ancient Italy. Lewis had underscored the name of a little town called Narnia, simply because he liked the sound of it. Narnia&amp;nbsp;— or 'Narni' in Italian&amp;nbsp;— is in [[Umbria]], halfway between Rome and Assisi.&lt;ref&gt;Green &amp; Hooper, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;306.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==

''The Chronicles of Narnia's'' seven books have been in continuous publication since 1956, selling over 100 million copies in 47 languages and with editions in [[Braille]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kelly |first=Clint |year=2006 |title=Dear Mr. Lewis |journal=Response |volume=29 |issue=1 |url=http://www.spu.edu/depts/uc/response/winter2k6/features/lewis.asp |accessdate=22 September 2008 |quote=The seven books of Narnia have sold more than 100 million copies in 30 languages, nearly 20 million in the last 10 years alone}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Guthmann |last=Edward |title='Narnia' tries to cash in on dual audience |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/12/11/NARNIA.TMP |work=SFGate |date=11 December 2005 |accessdate=22 September 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515201654/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2005%2F12%2F11%2FNARNIA.TMP |archivedate=15 May 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://inklingsfocus.com/translation_index.html Glen H.

The first five books were originally published in the United Kingdom by Geoffrey Bles. The first edition of ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' was released in London on 16 October 1950. Although three more books, ''Prince Caspian'', ''The Voyage of the Dawn Treader'' and ''The Horse and His Boy'', were already complete, they were not released immediately at that time, but instead appeared (along with ''The Silver Chair'') one at a time in each of the subsequent years (1951–1954). The last two books (''The Magician's Nephew'' and ''The Last Battle'') were published in the United Kingdom originally by [[The Bodley Head]] in 1955 and 1956.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Schakel, ''The Way Into Narnia'', William B. Eerdmans, 2005, p 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ford, 2005, p 464.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the publication rights were first owned by [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan Publishers]], and later by [[HarperCollins]]. The two issued both hardcover and paperback editions of the series during their tenure as publishers, while at the same time [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic, Inc.]] produced paperback versions for sale primarily through direct mail order, book clubs, and book fairs. Harper Collins also published several one-volume collected editions containing the full text of the series. As noted below (see '''[[#Reading order|Reading order]]'''), the first American publisher, Macmillan, numbered the books in publication sequence, whereas Harper Collins, at the suggestion of Lewis's stepson, opted to use the series' internal chronological order when they won the rights to it in 1994. Scholastic switched the numbering of its paperback editions in 1994 to mirror that of Harper Collins.&lt;ref name="Ford"/&gt;{{rp|24}}

===''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' (1950)===
{{Main article|The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe}}
''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'', completed by the end of March 1949&lt;ref&gt;Green &amp; Hooper, 2002, p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt; and published by Geoffrey Bles in the United Kingdom on 16 October 1950, tells the story of four ordinary children: [[Peter Pevensie|Peter]], [[Susan Pevensie|Susan]], [[Edmund Pevensie|Edmund]], and [[Lucy Pevensie]], who have been evacuated to the English countryside from [[London]] in 1940 following the outbreak of [[World War II]]. They discover a wardrobe in Professor [[Digory Kirke]]'s house that leads to the magical land of Narnia. The Pevensie children help Aslan, a talking lion, save Narnia from the evil [[White Witch]], who has reigned over the land of Narnia for a century of perpetual winter with no Christmas. The children become kings and queens of this new-found land and establish the Golden Age of Narnia, leaving a legacy to be rediscovered in later books.

===''Prince Caspian: The Return to Narnia'' (1951)===
{{Main article|Prince Caspian}}
Completed after Christmas 1949&lt;ref&gt;Green &amp; Hooper, 2002, p. 309.&lt;/ref&gt; and published on 15 October 1951, ''Prince Caspian: The Return to Narnia'' tells the story of the Pevensie children's second trip to Narnia. They are drawn back by the power of Susan's horn, blown by [[Caspian X|Prince Caspian]] to summon help in his hour of need. Narnia as they knew it is no more, as 1,300 years have passed, their castle is in ruins, and all Narnians have retreated so far within themselves that only Aslan's magic can wake them. Caspian has fled into the woods to escape his uncle, [[Miraz]], who has usurped the throne. The children set out once again to save Narnia.

===''The Voyage of the Dawn Treader'' (1952)===
{{Main article|The Voyage of the Dawn Treader}}
Written between January and February 1950&lt;ref name="S. Lewis 2002, p. 310"&gt;Green &amp; Hooper, 2002, p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt; and published on 15 September 1952, ''The Voyage of the Dawn Treader'' sees Edmund and Lucy Pevensie, along with their [[wikt:prig|priggish]] cousin, [[Eustace Scrubb]], return to Narnia, three years after their last departure. Once there, they join Caspian's voyage on the ship ''Dawn Treader'' to find the seven lords who were banished when Miraz took over the throne. This perilous journey brings them face to face with many wonders and dangers as they sail toward Aslan's country at the edge of the world.

===''The Silver Chair'' (1953)===
{{Main article|The Silver Chair}}
Completed at the beginning of March 1951&lt;ref name="S. Lewis 2002, p. 310"/&gt; and published 7 September 1953, ''The Silver Chair'' is the first Narnia book not involving the Pevensie children, focusing instead on Eustace. Several months after ''The Voyage of the Dawn Treader'', Aslan calls Eustace back to Narnia along with his classmate [[Jill Pole]]. They are given four signs to aid them in the search for Prince Caspian's son [[Rilian]], who disappeared ten years earlier on a quest to avenge his mother's death. Fifty years have passed in Narnia since the events from ''The Voyage of the Dawn Treader''; Eustace is still a child, but Caspian, barely an adult in the previous book, is now an old man. Eustace and Jill, with the help of [[Puddleglum]] the [[Marsh-wiggle]], face danger and betrayal on their quest to find Rilian.

===''The Horse and His Boy'' (1954)===
{{Main article|The Horse and His Boy}}
Begun in March and completed at the end of July 1950,&lt;ref name="S. Lewis 2002, p. 310"/&gt; ''The Horse and His Boy'' was published on 6 September 1954. The story takes place during the reign of the Pevensies in Narnia, an era which begins and ends in the last chapter of ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe''. The protagonists, a young boy named [[Shasta (Narnia)|Shasta]] and a talking horse named [[Bree (Narnia)|Bree]], both begin in bondage in the country of [[Calormen]]. By "chance", they meet and plan their return to Narnia and freedom. Along the way they meet [[Aravis]] and her talking horse [[Hwin]], who are also fleeing to Narnia.

===''The Magician's Nephew'' (1955)===
{{Main article|The Magician's Nephew}}
Completed in February 1954&lt;ref&gt;Green &amp; Hooper, 2002, p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt;
and published by Bodley Head in London on 2 May 1955, ''The Magician's Nephew'' serves as a prequel and presents Narnia's [[Creation myth|origin story]]: how Aslan created the world and how evil first entered it. [[Digory Kirke]] and his friend [[Polly Plummer]] stumble into different worlds by experimenting with magic rings made by Digory's uncle. In the dying world of [[Charn]] they awaken Queen Jadis, and another world turns out to be the beginnings of the Narnian world (where Jadis later becomes the [[White Witch]]). The story is set in 1900, when Digory was a 12-year-old boy. He is a middle-aged professor by the time he hosts the Pevensie children in ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' 40 years later.

===''The Last Battle'' (1956)===
{{Main article|The Last Battle}}
Completed in March 1953&lt;ref&gt;Green &amp; Hooper, 2002, p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; and published 4 September 1956, ''The Last Battle'' chronicles the end of the world of Narnia. Jill and Eustace return to save Narnia from the ape [[Shift (Narnia)|Shift]], who tricks [[Puzzle (Narnia)|Puzzle]] the donkey into impersonating the lion Aslan, thereby precipitating a showdown between the Calormenes and [[Tirian|King Tirian]]. This leads to the end of Narnia as it is known throughout the series, but allows Aslan to lead the characters to the "true" Narnia.

==Reading order==
Fans of the series often have strong opinions over the order in which the books should be read. The issue revolves around the placement of ''The Magician's Nephew'' and ''The Horse and His Boy'' in the series. Both are set significantly earlier in the story of Narnia than their publication order and fall somewhat outside the main story arc connecting the others. The reading order of the other five books is not disputed.

When first published, the books were not numbered. The first American publisher, Macmillan, enumerated them according to their original publication order, while some early British editions specified the internal chronological order. When Harper Collins took over the series rights in 1994, they adopted the internal chronological order.&lt;ref name="Ford"/&gt;{{rp|24}} To make the case for the internal chronological order, Lewis's stepson, [[Douglas Gresham]], quoted Lewis's 1957 reply to a letter from an American fan who was having an argument with his mother about the order:

:I think I agree with your [chronological] order for reading the books more than with your mother's. The series was not planned beforehand as she thinks. When I wrote ''The Lion'' I did not know I was going to write any more. Then I wrote ''P. Caspian'' as a sequel and still didn't think there would be any more, and when I had done ''The Voyage'' I felt quite sure it would be the last, but I found I was wrong. So perhaps it does not matter very much in which order anyone read them. I’m not even sure that all the others were written in the same order in which they were published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dorsett |first=Lyle |editor=Marjorie Lamp Mead |title=C. S. Lewis: Letters to Children |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster|Touchstone]] |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-684-82372-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2005 Harper Collins adult editions of the books, the publisher cites this letter to assert Lewis's preference for the numbering they adopted by including this notice on the copyright page:

:Although The Magician's Nephew was written several years after C. S. Lewis first began The Chronicles of Narnia, he wanted it to be read as the first book in the series. Harper Collins is happy to present these books in the order in which Professor Lewis preferred.

Paul Ford cites several scholars who have weighed in against this view,&lt;ref&gt;Ford, 2005, p xxiii–xxiv.&lt;/ref&gt; and continues, "most scholars disagree with this decision and find it the least faithful to Lewis's deepest intentions".&lt;ref name="Ford"/&gt;{{rp|24}} Scholars and readers who appreciate the original order believe that Lewis was simply being gracious to his youthful correspondent and that he could have changed the books' order in his lifetime had he so desired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Brady |first=Erik |title=A closer look at the world of ''Narnia'' |date=1 December 2005|accessdate=21 September 2008|work=USA Today |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2005-12-01-narnia-side_x.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; They maintain that much of the magic of Narnia comes from the way the world is gradually presented in ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' – that the mysterious wardrobe, as a narrative device, is a much better introduction to Narnia than ''The Magician's Nephew'', where the word "Narnia" appears in the first paragraph as something already familiar to the reader. Moreover, they say, it is clear from the texts themselves that ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' was intended to be read first. When Aslan is first mentioned in ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'', for example, the narrator says that "None of the children knew who Aslan was, any more than you do"&amp;nbsp;— which is nonsensical if one has already read ''The Magician's Nephew''.&lt;ref name="Schakel"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schakel |first=Peter |title=Reading with the Heart: The Way into Narnia |publisher=Erdmans |location=Grand Rapids |isbn=978-0-8028-1814-0 |year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other similar textual examples are also cited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rilstone |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Rilstone |url=http://www.aslan.demon.co.uk/narnia.htm  |title=What Order Should I Read the Narnia Books in (And Does It Matter?)|work=The Life and Opinions of Andrew Rilstone, Gentleman |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051130010333/http://www.aslan.demon.co.uk/narnia.htm |archivedate = 30 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doris Meyer, author of ''C. S. Lewis in Context'' and ''Bareface: A guide to C. S. Lewis'', writes that rearranging the stories chronologically "lessens the impact of the individual stories" and "obscures the literary structures as a whole".&lt;ref name="Ford"/&gt;{{rp|474}} Peter Schakel devotes an entire chapter to this topic in his book ''Imagination and the Arts in C. S. Lewis: Journeying to Narnia and Other Worlds'', and in ''Reading with the Heart: The Way into Narnia'' he writes:

:The only reason to read ''The Magician's Nephew'' first [...] is for the chronological order of events, and that, as every story teller knows, is quite unimportant as a reason. Often the early events in a sequence have a greater impact or effect as a flashback, told after later events which provide background and establish perspective. So it is [...] with the ''Chronicles''. The artistry, the archetypes, and the pattern of Christian thought all make it preferable to read the books in the order of their publication.&lt;ref name="Schakel"/&gt;

==Main characters==
{{further information|List of The Chronicles of Narnia characters}}

===Aslan===
{{Main article|Aslan}}
Aslan, the Great Lion, is the [[eponymous]] lion of ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'', and his role in Narnia is developed throughout the remaining books. He is also the only character to appear in all seven books. Aslan is a talking lion, the King of Beasts, son of the [[Emperor-Over-the-Sea]]. He is a wise, compassionate, magical authority (both temporal and spiritual) who serves as mysterious and benevolent guide to the human children who visit, as well as being the guardian and saviour of Narnia. C. S. Lewis described Aslan as an alternative version of Jesus as the form in which Christ might have appeared in an alternative reality.&lt;ref&gt;See Walter Hooper’s ''C. S. Lewis: A Companion and Guide''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pevensie family===
The four Pevensie siblings are the main human protagonists of ''The Chronicles of Narnia''. Varying combinations of some or all of them appear in five of the seven novels. They are introduced in ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' (although we do not learn their surname until ''The Voyage of the Dawn Treader''), and eventually become Kings and Queens of Narnia reigning as a tetrarchy. Although introduced in the series as children, the siblings grow up into adults while reigning in Narnia. They go back to being children once they get back to their own world, but feature as adults in ''The Horse and His Boy'' during their Narnian reign.

All four appear in ''The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe'' and ''Prince Caspian''; in the latter, however, Aslan tells Peter and Susan that they will not return, as they are getting too old. Susan, Lucy, and Edmund appear in ''The Horse and His Boy'' – Peter is said to be away fighting giants on the other side of Narnia. Lucy and Edmund appear in ''The Voyage of the Dawn Treader'', where Aslan tells them, too, that they are getting too old. Peter, Edmund, and Lucy appear as Kings and Queens in Aslan's Country in ''The Last Battle''; Susan does not.  Asked by a child in 1958 if he would please write another book entitled "Susan of Narnia" so that the entire Pevensie family would be reunited, C. S. Lewis replied: "I am so glad you like the Narnian books and it was nice of you to write and tell me. There's no use just asking &lt;u&gt;me&lt;/u&gt; to write more. When stories come into my mind I have to write them, and when they don't I can't!..."&lt;ref&gt;Private collection, Patricia Baird&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lucy Pevensie====
{{Main article|Lucy Pevensie}}
Lucy is the youngest of the four Pevensie siblings. Of all the Pevensie children, Lucy is the closest to Aslan, and of all the human characters who visit Narnia, Lucy is perhaps the one who believes in Narnia the most. In ''The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe'' she initiates the story by entering Narnia through the wardrobe, and (with Susan) witnesses Aslan's execution and resurrection. She is named Queen Lucy the Valiant. In ''Prince Caspian'' she is the first to see Aslan when he comes to guide them. In ''The Voyage of the Dawn Treader'', it is Lucy who breaks the spell of invisibility on the [[Dufflepuds]]. As an adult in ''The Horse and His Boy'' she helps fight the Calormenes at Anvard. Although a minor character in ''The Last Battle'', much of the closing chapter is seen from her point of view.

====Edmund Pevensie====
{{Main article|Edmund Pevensie}}
Edmund is the second child to enter Narnia in ''The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe'', where he falls under the White Witch's spell from eating the Turkish Delight she gives him. Instantiating that book's Christian theme of betrayal, repentance, and subsequent redemption via blood sacrifice, he betrays his siblings to the White Witch. But he quickly realizes her true nature and her evil intentions, and is redeemed by the sacrifice of Aslan's life. He is named King Edmund the Just. In ''Prince Caspian'' and ''The Voyage of the Dawn Treader'' he supports Lucy; in ''The Horse and His Boy'' he leads the Narnian delegation to Calormen and, later, the Narnian army breaking the siege at Anvard.

====Susan Pevensie====
{{Main article|Susan Pevensie}}
In ''The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe'' Susan accompanies Lucy to see Aslan die and rise again. She is named Queen Susan the Gentle. In ''Prince Caspian'', however, she is the last of the four to believe and follow Lucy when the latter is called by Aslan to guide them. As an adult queen in ''The Horse and His Boy'' she is courted by Prince Rabadash of Calormen but refuses his marriage proposal, and his angry response leads the story to its climax. In ''The Last Battle'', we are told that she has stopped believing in Narnia and remembers it only as a childhood game.

====Peter Pevensie====
{{Main article|Peter Pevensie}}
Peter is the eldest of the Pevensies. In ''The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe'' he kills a Talking Wolf to save Susan, and leads the Narnian army against the White Witch. Aslan names him [[High King]], and he is known as Peter the Magnificent. In ''Prince Caspian'' he duels the usurper King [[Miraz]] to restore Caspian's throne. In ''The Last Battle'' it is Peter whom Aslan entrusts with the duty of closing the door on Narnia for the final time.

===Eustace Scrubb===
{{Main article|Eustace Scrubb}}
Eustace Clarence Scrubb is a cousin of the Pevensies, and a classmate of Jill Pole at their school [[List of places in The Chronicles of Narnia#E|Experiment House]]. He is portrayed at first as a brat and a bully, but comes to improve his nasty behaviour when his greed turns him into a dragon for a while. His distress at having to live as a dragon causes him to reflect upon how horrible he has been, and his subsequent improved character is rewarded when Aslan changes him back into a boy. In the later books, Eustace comes across as a much nicer person, although he is still rather grumpy and argumentative. Nonetheless, he becomes a hero along with Jill Pole when the pair succeed in freeing the lost Prince Rilian from the clutches of an evil witch. He appears in ''The Voyage of the Dawn Treader'', ''The Silver Chair'', and ''The Last Battle.''

===Jill Pole===
{{Main article|Jill Pole}}
Jill Pole is not related to any of the other children who enter Narnia. She is a classmate and neighbour of Eustace Scrubb. She appears in ''The Silver Chair'', where she is the viewpoint character for most of the action, and returns in ''The Last Battle''. In ''The Silver Chair'' Eustace introduces her to the Narnian world, where Aslan gives her the task of memorising a series of signs that will help her and Eustace on their quest to find Caspian's lost son. In ''The Last Battle'' she and Eustace accompany King Tirian in his ill-fated defence of Narnia against the Calormenes.

===Digory Kirke===
{{Main article|Digory Kirke}}
Digory Kirke is the character referred to in the title of ''The Magician's Nephew''. He first appears as a minor character in ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'', known only as "The Professor", who hosts the Pevensie children when they are evacuated from London and defends Lucy's story of having found a country in the back of the wardrobe. In ''The Magician's Nephew'' the young Digory, thanks to his uncle's magical experimentation, inadvertently brings [[White Witch|Jadis]] from her dying homeworld of Charn to the newly-created world of Narnia; to fix his mistake Aslan sends him to fetch a magical apple which will protect Narnia and heal his dying mother. He returns in ''The Last Battle''.

===Polly Plummer===
{{Main article|Polly Plummer}}
Polly Plummer appears in ''The Magician's Nephew'' and ''The Last Battle''. She is the next-door neighbour of the young Digory Kirke. She is tricked by a wicked magician (who is Digory's uncle) into touching a magic ring which transports her to the [[Wood between the Worlds]] and leaves her there stranded. The wicked uncle persuades Digory to follow her with a second magic ring that has the power to bring her back. This sets up the pair's adventures into other worlds, and they witness the creation of Narnia as described in ''The Magician's Nephew''.

===(Mr) Tumnus===
{{Main article|Mr. Tumnus}}
Tumnus, called "Mr Tumnus" by Lucy, is a [[faun]] who is featured prominently in ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' and also appears in ''The Horse and His Boy'' and ''The Last Battle''. He is the first creature Lucy meets in Narnia, as well as the first Narnian to be introduced in the series; he invites her to his home with the intention of betraying her to Jadis, but quickly repents and befriends her. In ''The Horse and His Boy'' he devises the Narnian delegation's plan of escape from Calormen. He returns for a brief dialogue at the end of ''The Last Battle''. Tumnus is the faun in the snowy wood: the mental image of which, according to Lewis, was the initial inspiration for the entire Narnia series.&lt;ref name="OS53" /&gt;

===Prince Caspian / Caspian X===
{{Main article|Caspian X}}
Prince Caspian, later to become King Caspian X of Narnia, Lord of Cair Paravel and Emperor of The Lone Islands – also called "Caspian the Seafarer" and "Caspian the Navigator" — is the title character of the second book in the series, first introduced as the young nephew and heir of King Miraz of Narnia. ''Prince Caspian: The Return to Narnia'' is set 1300 years after the rule of High King Peter and his siblings, when Old Narnians have been driven into hiding by Caspian's ancestors the [[Telmar]]ines. Caspian is also a central character in ''The Voyage of the Dawn Treader'', and appears briefly at the beginning and end of ''The Silver Chair''.

===Trumpkin===
{{Main article|Trumpkin}}
Trumpkin the Dwarf is the narrator of several chapters of ''Prince Caspian''; he is one of Caspian's rescuers and a leading figure in the "Old Narnian" rebellion, and accompanies the Pevensie children from the ruins of Cair Paravel to the Old Narnian camp. In ''The Voyage of the Dawn Treader'' we learn that Caspian has made him his Regent in Narnia while he is away at sea, and he appears briefly in this role (now elderly and very deaf) in ''The Silver Chair''.

===Reepicheep===
{{Main article|Reepicheep}}
Reepicheep the Mouse is the leader of the Talking Mice of Narnia in ''Prince Caspian''.  Utterly fearless, infallibly courteous, and obsessed with honour, he is badly wounded in the final battle but healed by Lucy and Aslan. In ''The Voyage of the Dawn Treader'' his role is greatly expanded; he becomes a visionary as well as a warrior, and ultimately his willing self-exile to Aslan's Country breaks the enchantment on the last three of the Lost Lords, thus achieving the final goal of the quest. Lewis identified Reepicheep as "specially" exemplifying the latter book's theme of "the spiritual life".&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Anne Jenkins, 5 March 1961, in {{cite book|last=Hooper|first=Walter|title=The Collected Letters of C. S. Lewis, Volume III|year=2007|publisher=HarperSanFrancisco|isbn=978-0-06-081922-4|page=1245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Puddleglum===
{{Main article|Puddleglum}}
Puddleglum the Marsh-wiggle guides Eustace and Jill on their quest in ''The Silver Chair''. Though always comically pessimistic, he provides the voice of reason and as such intervenes critically in the climactic enchantment scene.

===Shasta / Cor===
{{Main article|Shasta (Narnia)}}
Shasta, later known as Cor of [[Archenland]], is the principal character in ''The Horse and His Boy''. Born the eldest son and heir of [[King Lune]] of Archenland, and elder twin of Prince Corin, Cor was kidnapped as an infant and raised as a fisherman's son in the country of [[Calormen]]. Learning that he is about to be sold into slavery at the beginning of ''The Horse and His Boy'', Shasta escapes to freedom, saves Archenland and Narnia from invasion, learns of his true identity, and is restored to his heritage. Shasta grows up to become King of Archenland, marries the Calormene Tarkheena [[Aravis]], and fathers the next (and most famous) king of Archenland, Ram the Great.

===Aravis===
{{Main article|Aravis}}
Aravis, daughter of Kidrash Tarkaan, is a character in ''The Horse and His Boy''. Escaping a forced betrothal to the loathsome Ahoshta, she joins Shasta on his journey and inadvertently overhears a plot by Rabadash, crown prince of Calormen, to invade Archenland. She later marries Shasta, now known as Prince Cor, and becomes queen of Archenland at his side.

===Bree===
{{Main article|Bree (Narnia)}}
Bree (Breehy-hinny-brinny-hoohy-hah) is Shasta's mount and mentor in ''The Horse and His Boy''. A Talking Horse of Narnia, he wandered into Calormen as a foal and was captured. He first appears as a Calormene nobleman's war-horse; when the nobleman buys Shasta as a slave, Bree organises and carries out their joint escape. Though friendly, he is also vain and a braggart until his encounter with Aslan late in the story.

===King Tirian===
{{Main article|Tirian}}
The last King of Narnia is the viewpoint character for much of ''The Last Battle''.  Having rashly killed a Calormene for mistreating a Narnian Talking Horse, he is imprisoned by the villainous ape Shift but released by Eustace and Jill.  Together they fight faithfully to the last and are welcomed into Aslan's Kingdom.

===Antagonists===

====White Witch / Jadis====
{{Main article|White Witch}}
Jadis, commonly known during her rule of Narnia as the White Witch, is the main [[villain]] of ''The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe'' and ''The Magician's Nephew'' – the only [[antagonist]] to appear in more than one Narnia book. In ''The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe'', she is the witch responsible for the freezing of Narnia resulting in the Hundred Year Winter; she turns her enemies into statues and kills Aslan on the Stone Table, but is killed by him in battle after his resurrection. In ''The Magician's Nephew'' she is wakened from a magical sleep by Digory in the dead world of Charn and inadvertently brought to [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[London]] before being transported to Narnia, where she steals an apple to grant her the gift of immortality.

====King Miraz====
{{Main article|Miraz}}
King Miraz is the lead villain of ''Prince Caspian''. Prior to the book's opening he has killed King Caspian IX, father of the titular Prince Caspian, and usurped his throne as king of the Telmarine colonizers in Narnia. He raises Caspian as his heir, but seeks to kill him after his own son is born. As the story progresses he leads the Telmarine war against the Old Narnian rebellion; he is defeated in single combat by Peter and then murdered by one of his own lords.

====Lady of the Green Kirtle====
{{Main article|Lady of the Green Kirtle}}
The Lady of the Green Kirtle is the lead villain of ''The Silver Chair'', and is also referred to in that book as "the Queen of Underland" or simply as "the Witch". She rules an underground kingdom through magical mind-control. Prior to the events of ''The Silver Chair'' she has murdered Caspian's Queen and then seduced and abducted his son Prince Rilian. She encounters the protagonists on their quest and sends them astray. Confronted by them later, she attempts to enslave them magically; when that fails, she attacks them in the form of a serpent and is killed.

====Prince Rabadash of Calormen====
{{Main article|Rabadash}}
Prince Rabadash, heir to the throne of [[Calormen]], is the primary antagonist of ''The Horse and His Boy''. Hot-headed, arrogant, and entitled, he brings Susan Pevensie, with a small retinue including Edmund Pevensie, to Calormen in the hope of marrying her. When the Narnians escape his clutches, he attacks [[Archenland]] with the intention of establishing a base from which to raid Narnia and take Susan back, but his plan is foiled by Shasta and Aravis warning the Archenlanders. He is captured by Edmund and transformed into a donkey by Aslan as a punishment.

====Shift the Ape====
{{Main article|Shift (Narnia)}}
Shift is the most prominent villain of ''The Last Battle''. He is an elderly [[Talking animals in fiction|Talking ]][[Ape]] – Lewis does not specify what kind of ape, but Pauline Baynes' illustrations depict him as a [[chimpanzee]]. He persuades the naïve donkey Puzzle to pretend to be Aslan (wearing a lion-skin) in order to seize control of Narnia, and proceeds to cut down the forests, enslave the other Talking Beasts, and invite the Calormenes to invade. He loses control of the situation due to over-indulging in [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], and is eventually swallowed up by the evil Calormene god [[Tash (Narnia)|Tash]].

=== Title characters ===
* ''[[The Magician's Nephew]]'' — [[Digory Kirke]]
* ''[[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'' — [[Aslan]], [[Jadis]]
* ''[[The Horse and His Boy]]'' — [[Bree (Narnia)|Bree]], [[Shasta (Narnia)|Shasta]]

==Narnian universe==
&lt;!--

NOTE TO EDITORS: This section is JUST A SUMMARY of the sections in the main article. All new material should be added to the Narnia (world) article.

--&gt;
{{Main article|Narnia (world)}}
[[File:Narnian.world.map.jpg|400px|thumb|A map by David Bedell of the [[fictional universe]] of the Narnian world.]]
The main setting of ''The Chronicles of Narnia'' is the world of Narnia constructed by Lewis and, in ''The Magician's Nephew'', the world containing the city of [[Charn]]. The Narnian and Charnian worlds are themselves posited as just two in a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|multiverse]] of countless worlds that includes our own universe, the main protagonists' world of origin. Passage between these worlds is possible, though rare, and may be accomplished by various means. Narnia itself is described as populated by a wide variety of creatures, most of which would be recognisable to those familiar with European mythologies and British and Irish fairy tales.

===Inhabitants===
:''See also: [[List of Narnian creatures|Narnia creatures]] and [[List of The Chronicles of Narnia characters]]''

Lewis's stories are populated with two distinct types of character: Humans originating from the reader's world of Earth, and Narnian creatures and their descendants created by Aslan. This is typical of works that involve parallel universes. The majority of characters from the reader's world serve as the protagonists of the various books, although some are only mentioned in passing depending on chronology. &lt;!--HIDE THIS PENDING CLARIFICATION-Those inhabitants that Lewis creates through the character Aslan are viewed, either positively or negatively, as diverse.{{clarify|post-text=Diverse in what way?|date=March 2011}}--&gt; Lewis does not limit himself to a single source of inspiration; instead, he borrows from many sources,including ancient Greek and German mythology, as well as [[Celtic literature]]. &lt;!--HIDE THIS UNTIL WE CAN GET A PROPER SOURCING-He also adds a few original creations of his own to the mix.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}--&gt;

===Geography===
{{refimprove section|date=March 2011}}
{{See also|List of places in The Chronicles of Narnia|l1=Narnian places}}

''The Chronicles of Narnia'' describes the world in which Narnia exists as one major landmass encircled by an ocean.&lt;ref&gt;Ford, 2005, p. 490&lt;/ref&gt; Narnia's capital sits on the eastern edge of the landmass on the shores of the Great Eastern Ocean.  This ocean contains the islands explored in ''The Voyage of the Dawn Treader''. On the main landmass Lewis places the countries of Narnia, Archenland, Calormen, and [[Telmar]], along with a variety of other areas that are not described as countries. The author also provides glimpses of more fantastic locations that exist in and around the main world of Narnia, including an edge and an underworld.&lt;ref&gt;Ford, 2005, p. 491&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several maps of the Narnian universe available, including what many consider the "official" one, a full-colour version published in 1972 by the books' illustrator, Pauline Baynes. This is currently out of print, although smaller copies can be found in the most recent HarperCollins 2006 hardcover edition of ''The Chronicles of Narnia''. Two other maps were produced as a result of the popularity of the 2005 film ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]''. One, the "Rose Map of Narnia", is based loosely on Baynes' map and has Narnian trivia printed on the reverse. The other, made in a monochromatic, archaic style reminiscent of maps of Tolkien's [[Middle-earth]], is available in print and in an interactive version on the DVD of the movie. The latter map depicts only the country Narnia and not the rest of Lewis's world.

===Cosmology===
A recurring plot device in ''The Chronicles'' is the interaction between the various worlds that make up the Narnian multiverse. A variety of methods are used to initiate these cross-overs which generally serve to introduce characters to the land of Narnia. The Cosmology of Narnia is not as internally consistent as that of Lewis's contemporary Tolkien's Middle-earth, but suffices given the more fairy tale atmosphere of the work. During the course of the series we learn in passing, that the world of Narnia is flat and [[Geocentric model|geocentric]] and has different stars from those of Earth, and that the passage of time does not correspond directly to the passage of time in our world.

===History===
:See also: ''[[Narnian timeline]]'' and ''[[Narnia (world)#History|History of Narnia]]''

''The Chronicles'' cover the entire history of the world of Narnia, describing the process by which it was created, offering snapshots of life in Narnia as its history unfolds, and how it is ultimately destroyed. As is often the case in a children's series, children themselves, usually from our world, play a prominent role in all of these events. The history of Narnia is generally divided into the following periods: creation and the period shortly afterwards, the rule of the White Witch, the Golden Age, the invasion and rule of the Telmarines, their subsequent defeat by Caspian X, the rule of King Caspian and his descendants, and the destruction of Narnia. Like many stories, the narrative is not necessarily always presented in chronological order.

===Lewis's life===
Lewis's early life has parallels with ''The Chronicles of Narnia''. At the age of seven, he moved with his family to a large house on the edge of [[Belfast]]. Its long hallways and empty rooms inspired Lewis and his brother to invent make-believe worlds whilst exploring their home, an activity reflected in Lucy's discovery of Narnia in ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=C. S. |title=Surprised by Joy |publisher=Fount Paperbacks |year=1990 |isbn=0-00-623815-7 |page=14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like Caspian and Rilian, Lewis lost his mother at an early age, spending much of his youth in English boarding schools similar to those attended by the Pevensie children, Eustace Scrubb, and Jill Pole. During World War II many children were evacuated from London and other urban areas because of German air raids. Some of these children, including one named Lucy (Lewis's goddaughter) stayed with him at his home The Kilns near Oxford, just as the Pevensies stayed with [[Digory Kirke|The Professor]] in ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wilson |first=Tracy V. |title=How Narnia Works |work=[[HowStuffWorks]] |date=7 December 2005|accessdate=28 October 2008|url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/narnia.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influences from mythology and cosmology===
Drew Trotter, president of the Center for Christian Study, noted that the producers of the film ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe]]'' felt that the books' plots adhere to the archetypal "[[monomyth]]" pattern as detailed in [[Joseph Campbell]]'s ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Trotter |first=Drew |title=What Did C. S. Lewis Mean, and Does It Matter? |url=http://www.leaderu.com/popculture/meaningandlewis-lwwpreview.html |date=11 November 2005|accessdate=28 October 2008|publisher=Leadership U }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewis was widely read in [[British literature#Early Celtic literature|medieval Celtic literature]], an influence reflected throughout the books, and most strongly in ''The Voyage of the Dawn Treader.'' The entire book imitates one of the [[immram]]a, a type of traditional [[Old Irish]] tale that combines elements of Christianity and [[Irish mythology]] to tell the story of a hero's sea journey to the [[Celtic Otherworld|Otherworld]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huttar|first=Charles A.|title="Deep lies the sea-longing": inklings of home (1)|journal=Mythlore / The Free Library|date=22 September 2007|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/%22Deep+lies+the+sea-longing%22%3A+inklings+of+home+(1).-a0171579955|accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Duriez|first=Colin|title=A Field Guide to Narnia|year=2004|publisher=InterVarsity Press|page=80, 95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval Ireland also had a tradition of High Kings ruling over lesser kings and queens or princes, as in Narnia. Lewis's term "Cair," as in [[Cair Paravel]], also mirrors "Caer", or "fortress" in the Welsh language. [[Reepicheep]]'s small boat is a ''[[coracle]]'', a type of vessel traditionally used in the [[Celtic nations|Celtic]] regions of the British Isles.  Some creatures in the book such as the one-footed [[Monopod (creature)|Dufflepuds]] reflect elements of Greek, Roman and Medieval mythology while other Narnian creatures are borrowed from Greek and Germanic mythology: for example, [[centaurs]] from the former and [[Dwarf (Germanic mythology)|dwarfs]] from the latter.

====''Planet Narnia''====

[[Michael Ward (scholar)|Michael Ward]]'s 2008 book ''Planet Narnia''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ward|first=Michael|title=Planet Narnia: The Seven Heavens in the Imagination of C. S. Lewis|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-531387-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposes that each of the seven books related to one of the [[Classical planet|seven moving heavenly bodies or "planets"]] known in the Middle Ages according to the [[Ptolemaic system|Ptolemaic geocentric model]] of [[cosmology]] (a theme to which Lewis returned habitually throughout his work). At that time, each of these heavenly bodies was believed to have certain attributes, and Ward contends that these attributes were deliberately but subtly used by Lewis to furnish elements of the stories of each book:
:In ''The Lion'' [the child protagonists] become monarchs under sovereign [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jove]]; in ''Prince Caspian'' they harden under strong [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]; in ''The "Dawn Treader"'' they drink light under searching [[Sol (mythology)|Sol]]; in ''The Silver Chair'' they learn obedience under subordinate [[Luna (mythology)|Luna]]; in ''The Horse and His Boy'' they come to love poetry under eloquent [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]; in ''The Magician's Nephew'' they gain life-giving fruit under fertile [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]; and in ''The Last Battle'' they suffer and die under chilling [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]].&lt;ref&gt;Ward, 2008, p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewis's interest in the literary symbolism of medieval and Renaissance astrology is more overtly referenced in other works such as his study of medieval cosmology ''[[The Discarded Image]]'', and in his early poetry as well as in ''[[The Space Trilogy|Space Trilogy]]''. Narnia scholar [[Paul F. Ford]] finds Ward's assertion that Lewis intended ''The Chronicles'' to be an embodiment of medieval astrology implausible,&lt;ref name="Ford"/&gt;{{rp|16}} though Ford addresses an earlier (2003) version of Ward's thesis (also called ''Planet Narnia'', published in the ''Times Literary Supplement'').  Ford argues that Lewis did not start with a coherent plan for the books, but Ward's book answers this by arguing that the astrological associations grew in the writing:
:Jupiter was... [Lewis's] favourite planet, part of the "habitual furniture" of his mind... ''The Lion'' was thus the first example of that "idea that he wanted to try out". ''Prince Caspian'' and ''The "Dawn Treader"'' naturally followed because Mars and Sol were both already connected in his mind with the merits of the [[Samuel Alexander|Alexander]] technique.... at some point after commencing ''The Horse and His Boy'' he resolved to treat all seven planets, for seven such treatments of his idea would mean that he had "worked it out to the full".&lt;ref&gt;Ward, 2008, p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

A quantitative analysis on the imagery in the different books of ''The Chronicles'' gives mixed support to Ward's thesis: ''The Voyage of the Dawn Treader'', ''The Silver Chair'', ''The Horse and His Boy'', and ''The Magician's Nephew'' do indeed employ concepts associated with, respectively, Sol, Luna, Mercury, and Venus, far more often than chance would predict, but ''The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe'', ''Prince Caspian'', and ''The Last Battle'' fall short of statistical correlation with their proposed planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Barrett |first=Justin L. |title=Some Planets In Narnia: a quantitative investigation of the ''Planet Narnia'' thesis |url=https://www.wheaton.edu/media/migrated-images-amp-files/media/files/centers-and-institutes/wade-center/Barrett_Narnia_web.pdf |date=2010|accessdate=28 April 2018|publisher=Seven: an Anglo-American literary review (Wheaton College)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influences from literature===
George MacDonald's ''[[Phantastes]]'' (1858) influenced the structure and setting of "The Chronicles".{{clarify|date=April 2018}} It was a work that was " a great balm to the soul".&lt;ref&gt;Into The Wardrobe: C.S. Lewis and the Narnia Chronicles, Downing, David C., 2005, pp. 12–13 {{ISBN|978-0-7879-7890-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plato]] was an undeniable influence on Lewis’s writing of ''The Chronicles''. Most clearly, Digory explicitly invokes Plato's name at the end of ''The Last Battle'', to explain how the old version of Narnia is but a shadow of the newly revealed “true” Narnia.&lt;ref name="Johnson and Houtman, 1986"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Johnson |first1=William C. |last2=Houtman |first2=Marcia K. |title=Platonic Shadows in C. S. Lewis' Narnia Chronicles |journal=Modern Fiction Studies |date=1986 |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=75-87 |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/article/244283 |accessdate=1 October 2018 |doi=10.1353/mfs.0.1154}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plato’s influence is also apparent in ''The Silver Chair'' when the Queen of the Underland attempts to convince the protagonists that the surface world is not real. She echoes the logic of [[Allegory of the Cave|Plato’s Cave]] by comparing the sun to a nearby lamp, arguing that reality is only that which is perceived in the immediate physical vicinity.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson and Houtman, 1986, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

The White Witch in ''The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe'' shares many features, both of appearance and character, with the villainous Duessa of [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene|Faerie Queene]]'', a work Lewis studied in detail. Like Duessa, she falsely styles herself Queen; she leads astray the erring Edmund with false temptations; she turns people into stone as Duessa turns them into trees. Both villains wear opulent robes and deck their conveyances out with bells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hardy|first=Elizabeth Baird|title=Milton, Spenser and The Chronicles of Narnia: literary sources for the C. S. Lewis novels|year=2007|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc.|isbn=978-0-7864-2876-2}} pp. 20–25.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Magician's Nephew'' Jadis takes on echoes of [[Satan#In art and literature|Satan]] from [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'': she climbs over the wall of the paradisal garden in contempt of the command to enter only by the gate, and proceeds to tempt Digory as Satan tempted [[Eve]], with lies and half-truths.&lt;ref&gt;Hardy, 2007, pp. 30–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the Lady of the Green Kirtle in ''The Silver Chair'' recalls both the snake-woman Errour in ''The Faerie Queene'' and Satan's transformation into a snake in ''Paradise Lost''.&lt;ref&gt;Hardy, 2007, pp. 38–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewis read [[Edith Nesbit]]'s children's books as a child and was greatly fond of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lindskoog| first = Kathryn Ann | title = Journey into Narnia: C. S. Lewis's Tales Explored | page = 87 | publisher = Hope Publishing House | year = 1997 | ISBN = 0-932727-89-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described ''The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe'' around the time of its completion as "a children's book in the tradition of E. Nesbit".&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, Chad (1974). ''C. S. Lewis: Apostle to the Skeptics''. Norwood Editions. p. 10. {{ISBN|0-88305-779-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Magician's Nephew'' in particular bears strong resemblances to Nesbit's ''[[The Story of the Amulet]]'' (1906). This novel focuses on four children living in London who discover a magic amulet. Their father is away and their mother is ill, as is the case with Digory. They manage to transport the queen of [[Babylon|ancient Babylon]] to London and she is the cause of a riot; likewise, Polly and Digory transport Queen Jadis to London, sparking a very similar incident.&lt;ref&gt;Lindskoog, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Marsha Daigle-Williamson argues that [[Dante Alighieri|Dante’s]] ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' had a significant impact on Lewis’s writings. In the Narnia series, she identifies this influence as most apparent in ''The Voyage of the Dawn Treader'' and ''The Silver Chair''.&lt;ref name="Daigle-Williamson, 2015"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Daigle-Williamson |first1=Marsha |title=Reflecting the Eternal: Dante's Divine Comedy in the Novels of C. S. Lewis |date=2015 |publisher=Hendrickson Publishers |location=Peabody, MA |isbn=978-1-61970-665-1 |pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daigle-Williamson identifies the plot of ''The Voyage of the Dawn Treader'' as a Dantean journey with a parallel structure and similar themes.&lt;ref&gt;Daigle-Williamson, 2015, pp. 162-170.&lt;/ref&gt; She likewise draws numerous connections between ''The Silver Chair'' and the events of Dante’s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Daigle-Williamson, 2015, pp. 170-174.&lt;/ref&gt;

Colin Duriez, writing on the shared elements found in both Lewis’s and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]’s works, highlights the thematic similarities between Tolkien’s poem ''Imram'' and Lewis’s ''The Voyage of the Dawn Treader''.&lt;ref name="Duriez, 2015"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Duriez |first1=Colin |title=Bedeviled: Lewis, Tolkien and the Shadow of Evil |date=2015 |publisher=IVP Books |location=Downers Grove, IL |isbn=978-0-8308-3417-4 |pages=180-182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences on other works==

===Influences on literature===
''The Chronicles of Narnia'' has been a significant influence on both adult and children's fantasy literature in the post-World War II era. In 1976, the scholar Susan Cornell Poskanzer praised Lewis for his "strangely powerful fantasies".&lt;ref name="Poskanzer pages 523-526"&gt;Poskanzer, Susan Cornell "Thoughts on C. S. Lewis and the Chronicles of Narnia" pages 523-526 from ''Language Arts'', Volume 53, Issue #5, May 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; Poskanzer argued that children could relate to ''Narnia'' books because the heroes and heroines were realistic characters, each with their own distinctive voice and personality.&lt;ref name="Poskanzer pages 523-526"/&gt; Furthermore, the protagonists become powerful kings and queens who decide the fate of kingdoms, while the adults in the ''Narnia'' books tended to be buffoons, which by inverting the normal order of things was pleasing to many youngsters.&lt;ref name="Poskanzer pages 523-526"/&gt; However, Poskanzer criticized Lewis for what she regarded as scenes of gratuitous violence, which she felt were upsetting to children.&lt;ref name="Poskanzer pages 523-526"/&gt; Poskanzer also noted Lewis presented his Christian message subtly enough as to avoid boring children with overt sermonizing.&lt;ref name="Poskanzer pages 523-526"/&gt;

Examples include:

[[Philip Pullman]]'s fantasy series, ''[[His Dark Materials]]'', is seen as a response to ''The Chronicles''. Pullman is a self-described [[atheist]] who wholly rejects the spiritual themes that permeate ''The Chronicles'', yet his series nonetheless addresses many of the same issues and introduces some similar character types, including talking animals. In another parallel, the first books in each series – Pullman's ''[[Northern Lights (novel)|Northern Lights]]'' and ''The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe'' – both open with a young girl hiding in a wardrobe.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;Miller, "[http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/12/26/051226fa_fact Far From Narnia]'' The New Yorker, 26 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fantasy"&gt;[[Cathy Young]], "[http://www.reason.com/news/show/124392.html A Secular Fantasy&amp;nbsp;– The flawed but fascinating fiction of Philip Pullman]", [[Reason (magazine)|Reason Magazine]] (March 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hitchens"&gt;Peter Hitchens, "[http://home.wlv.ac.uk/~bu1895/hitchens.htm This is the most dangerous author in Britain]", ''The Mail on Sunday'' (27 January 2002), p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AtheistChronicles"&gt;Chattaway, Peter T. "[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2007/december/12.36.html The Chronicles of Atheism]'', ''Christianity Today''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neil Gaiman]]'s young-adult horror novella ''[[Coraline]]'' has been compared to ''[[The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe]]'', as both books involve young girls travelling to magical worlds through doors in their new houses and fighting evil with the help of talking animals. His ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|Sandman]]'' comic book series also features a Narnia-like "dream island" in its story arc entitled ''[[A Game of You]]''.  When the island is unmade by its creator [[Dream (comics)|Morpheus]], the inhabitants march into the shadow of his cloak in a scene visually similar to [[Aslan]]'s judgement of the inhabitants of Narnia in ''[[The Last Battle]]''.

[[Bill Willingham]]'s comic book series ''[[Fables (comics)|Fables]]'' makes reference at least twice to a king called "The Great Lion", a thinly veiled reference to Aslan. The series avoids explicitly referring to any characters or works that are not in the public domain.

The novel ''[[Bridge to Terabithia (novel)|Bridge to Terabithia]]'' by [[Katherine Paterson]] has Leslie, one of the main characters, reveal to Jesse her love of Lewis's books, subsequently lending him ''The Chronicles of Narnia'' so that he can learn how to behave like a king. Her book also features the island name "Terabithia", which sounds similar to [[Terebinthia]], a Narnian island that appears in ''Prince Caspian'' and ''The Voyage of the Dawn Treader''. Katherine Paterson herself acknowledges that Terabithia is likely to be derived from Terebinthia:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I thought I had made it up. Then, rereading ''The Voyage of the Dawn Treader'' by C. S. Lewis, I realized that I had probably gotten it from the island of Terebinthia in that book. However, Lewis probably got that name from the [[Pistacia palaestina|Terebinth]] tree in the Bible, so both of us pinched from somewhere else, probably unconsciously."&lt;ref&gt;''Bridge to Terabithia'', 2005 Harper Trophy edition, section "Questions for Katherine Paterson."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Science-fiction author [[Greg Egan]]'s short story "Oracle" depicts a parallel universe in which an author nicknamed Jack (Lewis's nickname) has written novels about the fictional "Kingdom of Nesica", and whose wife is dying of cancer, paralleling the death of Lewis's wife [[Joy Davidman]]. Several Narnian allegories are also used to explore issues of religion and faith versus science and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Egan, Greg. [http://gregegan.customer.netspace.net.au/MISC/ORACLE/Oracle.html "Oracle"], 12 November 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lev Grossman]]'s ''New York Times'' best-seller ''[[The Magicians (Grossman novel)|The Magicians]]'' is a contemporary dark fantasy about an unusually gifted young man obsessed with Fillory, the magical land of his favourite childhood books. Fillory is a thinly veiled substitute for Narnia, and clearly the author expects it to be experienced as such. Not only is the land home to many similar talking animals and mythical creatures, it is also accessed through a grandfather clock in the home of an uncle to whom five English children are sent during World War II. Moreover, the land is ruled by two Aslan-like rams named Ember and Umber, and terrorised by The Watcherwoman. She, like the White Witch, freezes the land in time. The book's plot revolves heavily around a place very like the "wood between the worlds" from ''The Magician's Nephew'', an interworld waystation in which pools of water lead to other lands. This reference to ''The Magician's Nephew'' is echoed in the title of the book.&lt;ref&gt;Publishers Weekly blog ''[http://blogs.publishersweekly.com/blogs/PWxyz/?p=2115 Decatur Book Festival: Fantasy and its practice « PWxyz] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100911041544/http://blogs.publishersweekly.com/blogs/PWxyz/?p=2115 |date=11 September 2010 }}''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J. K. Rowling]], author of the [[Harry Potter]] series, has said that she was a fan of the works of Lewis as a child, and cites the influence of ''The Chronicles'' on her work: "I found myself thinking about the wardrobe route to Narnia when Harry is told he has to hurl himself at a barrier in [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross Station]]&amp;nbsp;— it dissolves and he's on platform Nine and Three-Quarters, and there's the train for [[Hogwarts]]."&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;{{cite web | author= Renton, Jennie| title=The story behind the Potter legend|work=Sydney Morning Herald| url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2001/1001-sydney-renton.htm|accessdate=10 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, she is at pains to stress the differences between Narnia and her world: "Narnia is literally a different world", she says, "whereas in the Harry books you go into a world within a world that you can see if you happen to belong. A lot of the humour comes from collisions between the magic and the everyday worlds. Generally there isn't much humour in the Narnia books, although I adored them when I was a child. I got so caught up I didn't think CS Lewis was especially preachy. Reading them now I find that his subliminal message isn't very subliminal."&lt;ref name="Lewis" /&gt; ''New York Times'' writer Charles McGrath notes the similarity between [[Dudley Dursley]], the obnoxious son of Harry's neglectful guardians, and Eustace Scrubb, the spoiled brat who torments the main characters until he is redeemed by Aslan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Narnia Skirmishes|first=Charles | last= McGrath|work=The New York Times| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/13/movies/13narnia.html?ei=5090&amp;en=49132a2956301464&amp;ex=1289538000&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all|accessdate=29 May 2008|date=13 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influences on music===
''[[The Roar of Love]]'' is a 1980 [[concept album]] by Christian band [[2nd Chapter of Acts]] based on ''[[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]''.

The song "[[Further Up, Further In]]" from the album ''[[Room to Roam]]'' by [[The Waterboys]] is heavily influenced by ''The Chronicles of Narnia'', with the title coming from a passage in ''[[The Last Battle]]''.  [[C. S. Lewis]] is acknowledged in the liner notes as an influence.

==Christian themes==
{{Main article|Religion in The Chronicles of Narnia}}

A convert to Christianity in later life, Lewis had authored a number of works on Christian [[apologetics]] and other literature with Christian-based themes before writing the ''Narnia'' books.

See also Lewis's own autobiography ''Surprised by Joy''&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis did not initially plan to incorporate [[Christian theology|Christian theological concepts]] into his ''Narnia'' stories.

''The Chronicles'' have, consequently, a large Christian following, and are widely used to promote Christian ideas.

--&gt;
In later years, both Lewis and the ''Chronicles'' have been criticised (often by other authors of fantasy fiction) for [[gender role]] stereotyping, though other authors have defended Lewis in this area. For example, Lucy gets a healing potion and a dagger, while Peter gets a sword. Most allegations of [[sexism]] centre on the description of Susan Pevensie in ''The Last Battle'' when Lewis writes that Susan is "no longer a friend of Narnia" and interested "in nothing nowadays except nylons and lipstick and invitations".

[[Philip Pullman]], inimical to Lewis on many fronts, calls the ''Narnia'' stories "monumentally disparaging of women".&lt;ref name="Ezard"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ezard|first1=John|title=Narnia books attacked as racist and sexist|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/jun/03/gender.hayfestival2002|accessdate=26 March 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=3 June 2002|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208163207/http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/jun/03/gender.hayfestival2002|archivedate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His interpretation of the Susan passages reflects this view:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Susan, like [[Cinderella]], is undergoing a transition from one phase of her life to another. Lewis didn't approve of that. He didn't like women in general, or [[human sexuality|sexuality]] at all, at least at the stage in his life when he wrote the Narnia books. He was frightened and appalled at the notion of wanting to grow up.&lt;ref name="Pullman"&gt;Pullman "[http://www.crlamppost.org/darkside.htm The Darkside of Narnia]" The Cumberland River Lamppost, 2 September 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In fantasy author [[Neil Gaiman]]'s short story "The Problem of Susan" (2004),&lt;ref name="WagnerGolden2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hank Wagner|author2=Christopher Golden|author3=Stephen R. Bissette|title=Prince of Stories: The Many Worlds of Neil Gaiman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tFIuyrWnjGYC&amp;pg=PA395|date=28 October 2008|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-1-4299-6178-3|pages=395–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gaiman2010FragileThings"&gt;"The Problem of Susan" can be found in: {{cite book|author=Neil Gaiman|title=Fragile Things: Short Fictions and Wonders|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NoFHsQiguDIC|date=9 February 2010|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-051523-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; an elderly woman, Professor Hastings, deals with the grief and trauma of her entire family's death in a train crash.  Although the woman's maiden name is not revealed, details throughout the story strongly imply that this character is the elderly Susan Pevensie. The story is written for an adult audience and deals with issues of sexuality and violence and through it Gaiman presents a critique of Lewis's treatment of Susan.&lt;ref name="WagnerGolden2008"/&gt;

Other writers, including fan-magazine editor [[Andrew Rilstone]], oppose this view, arguing that the "lipsticks, nylons and invitations" quote is taken out of context. They maintain that in ''The Last Battle'', Susan is excluded from Narnia explicitly because she no longer believes in it. At the end of ''The Last Battle'' Susan is still alive with her ultimate fate unspecified. Moreover, in ''The Horse and His Boy'', Susan's adulthood and sexual maturity are portrayed in a positive light, and therefore argued to be unlikely reasons for her exclusion from Narnia.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Lewis supporters also cite the positive roles of women in the series, including Jill Pole in ''The Silver Chair'', Aravis Tarkheena in ''The Horse and His Boy'', Polly Plummer in ''The Magician's Nephew,'' and particularly Lucy Pevensie in ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe''. Alan Jacobs, an English professor at Wheaton College, asserts that Lucy is the most admirable of the human characters and that generally the girls come off better than the boys throughout the series (Jacobs, 2008: 259).&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.livejournal.com/users/synaesthete7/176635.html The Problem of Susan]" RJ Anderson, 30 August 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RilstoneLipstick"&gt;[http://andrewrilstone.blogspot.com/2005/11/lipstick-on-my-scholar.html Lipstick on My Scholar]" Andrew Rilstone, 30 November 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In her contribution to ''The Chronicles of Narnia and Philosophy'', Karin Fry, an Assistant Professor of Philosophy at the University of Wisconsin, Stevens Point, notes that "the most sympathetic female characters in ''The Chronicles'' are consistently the ones who question the traditional roles of women and prove their worth to Aslan through actively engaging in the adventures just like the boys."&lt;ref name="Bassham"&gt;Chapter 13: ''No Longer a Friend of Narnia: Gender in Narnia'' ''The Chronicles of Narnia and Philosophy: The Lion, the Witch and the Worldview'' Edited by Gregory Bassham and Jerry L. Walls; Open Court, Chicago and La Salle, Illinois, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Fry goes on to say:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The characters have positive and negative things to say about both male and female characters, suggesting an equality between sexes. However, the problem is that many of the positive qualities of the female characters seem to be those by which they can rise above their femininity ... The superficial nature of stereotypical female interests is condemned.&lt;ref name="Bassham"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Taking a different stance altogether, Monika B. Hilder provides a thorough examination of the feminine ethos apparent in each book of the series, and proposes that critics tend to misread Lewis’s representation of gender. As she puts it “...we assume that Lewis is sexist when he is in fact applauding the “feminine” heroic. To the extent that we have not examined our own chauvinism, we demean the “feminine” qualities and extol the “masculine” - not noticing that Lewis does the opposite.”&lt;ref name="Hilder, 2012"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hilder |first1=Monika B. |title=The Feminine Ethos in C.

--&gt;
In addition to sexism, Pullman and others have also accused the Narnia series of fostering racism.&lt;ref name="Ezard"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4347226.stm Pullman attacks Narnia film plans]" ''[[BBC News]]'', 16 October 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Over the alleged racism in ''The Horse and His Boy'', newspaper editor [[Kyrie O'Connor]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It's just too dreadful. While the book's storytelling virtues are enormous, you don't have to be a bluestocking of [[political correctness]] to find some of this fantasy anti-[[Arab]], or anti-Eastern, or anti-[[Ottoman Turks|Ottoman]]. With all its stereotypes, mostly played for belly laughs, there are moments you'd like to stuff this story back into its closet.&lt;ref name="OConnor"&gt;Kyrie O'Connor, "[https://web.archive.org/web/20051214153306/http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20051201%2FLIVING%2F512010303%2F1007 5th Narnia book may not see big screen]" IndyStar.com, 1 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Gregg Easterbrook]], writing in ''The Atlantic'', calls the Calormenes "standins for Muslims",&lt;ref&gt;October 2001 of The Atlantic&lt;/ref&gt; while novelist [[Philip Hensher]] raises specific concerns that a reader might gain the impression Islam is a "Satanic cult".&lt;ref&gt;Philip Hensher, "[http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;id=907 Don't let your children go to Narnia: C. S. Lewis's books are racist and misogynist]" Discovery Institute, 1 March 1999&lt;/ref&gt; In rebuttal to this charge, at an address to a C. S. Lewis conference,&lt;ref&gt;Keynote Address at The 12th Annual Conference of The C. S. Lewis and Inklings Society Calvin College, 28 March 2009 [http://www.narniaweb.com/resources-links/are-the-chronicles-of-narnia-sexist-and-racist/ Are The Chronicles of Narnia Sexist and Racist? | NarniaWeb]&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Devin Brown argued that there are too many dissimilarities between the Calormene religion and Islam, particularly in the areas of polytheism and human sacrifice, for Lewis's writing to be regarded as critical of Islam.

Nicholas Wanberg has argued, echoing claims by Mervyn Nicholson, that accusations of racism in the books are "an oversimplification", but he asserts that the stories employ beliefs about human aesthetics, including equating dark skin with ugliness, that have been traditionally associated with racist thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wanberg |first=Nicholas |date=2013 |title=Noble and Beautiful: Race and Human Aesthetics in C.

Critics also argue whether Lewis's work presents a positive or negative view of colonialism. Nicole DuPlessis favors the anticolonial view, claiming "the negative effects of colonial exploitations and the themes of animals' rights and responsibility to the environment are emphasized in Lewis' construction of a community of living things. Through the negative examples of illegitimate rulers, Lewis constructs the 'correct' relationship between humans and nature, providing examples of rulers like Caspian who fulfill their responsibilities to the environment."&lt;ref&gt;DuPlessis, Nicole. "EcoLewis: Conversationism and Anticolonialism in the Chronicles of Narnia." Wild Things: Children's Culture and Ecocriticism. Ed. Sidney I. Dobrin and Kenneth B. Kidd. Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 2004. pp. 125&lt;/ref&gt; Clare Etcherling counters with her claim that "those 'illegitimate' rulers are often very dark-skinned" and that the only "legitimate rulers are those sons and daughters of Adam and Eve who adhere to Christian conceptions of morality and stewardship – either white English children (such as Peter) or Narnians who possess characteristics valued and cultivated by the British (such as Caspian)."&lt;ref&gt;Echterling, Clare.

==Adaptations of ''The Chronicles of Narnia''==
{{Main article|Adaptations of The Chronicles of Narnia}}
&lt;!--NOTE: The article is about the books, this section should just summarise other its appearances in other media, details belong elsewhere--&gt;

===Television===
Various books from ''The Chronicles of Narnia'' have been adapted for television over the years, including:

''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' was first [[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (1967 TV serial)|adapted in 1967]]. Comprising ten episodes of thirty minutes each, the screenplay was written by Trevor Preston, and directed by Helen Standage. Unlike subsequent adaptations, it is currently unavailable to purchase for home viewing. The book was  [[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (1979 film)|adapted again in 1979]], this time as an animated cartoon co-produced by [[Bill Meléndez]] and the [[Children's Television Workshop]], with a screenplay by David D. Connell. Winner of the 1979 [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour)|Emmy award for Outstanding Animated Program]], it was one of the first major made-for-television feature-length animated films. Many of the characters' voices in the British TV release were re-recorded by British actors with the exception of the characters Aslan, Peter, Susan, and Lucy.

Between 1988 and 1990, the first four books (as published) were adapted by the BBC as [[The Chronicles of Narnia (TV serial)|four television serials]]. They were also aired in America on the PBS/Disney show [[WonderWorks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.movieretriever.com/videohound_lists/90154/Wonderworks-Family-Movie-Series|title=Wonderworks Family Movie Series|work=movieretriever.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403090306/http://www.movieretriever.com/videohound_lists/90154/Wonderworks-Family-Movie-Series|archivedate=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were nominated for a total of 14 Emmy awards, including "Outstanding Children's Program", and a number of [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA]] awards including Best Children's Programme (Entertainment / Drama) in 1988, 1989 and 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Children's Nominations 1988|url=http://www.bafta.org/awards/childrens/nominations/?year=1988|publisher=BAFTA|accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Children's Nominations 1989|url=http://www.bafta.org/awards/childrens/nominations/?year=1989|publisher=BAFTA|accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Children's Nominations 1990|url=http://www.bafta.org/awards/childrens/nominations/?year=1990|publisher=BAFTA|accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The serials were later edited into three feature-length films (the second of which combined ''Prince Caspian'' and ''The Voyage of the Dawn Treader'' into one) and released on VHS and DVD.

On 3 October 2018, the C.S. Lewis Company announced that [[Netflix]] had acquired the rights to new film and series adaptations of the Narnia books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thewrap.com/netflix-develop-series-films-based-cs-lewis-chronicles-narnia/|title=Netflix to Develop Series, Films Based on CS Lewis’ ‘The Chronicles of Narnia'|website=the wrap|author=Beatrice Verhoeven|date=3 October 2018|accessdate=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'', this was the first time that rights to the entire ''Narnia'' catalogue had been held by a single company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jenkins|first=Aric|date=November 1, 2018|title=Netflix Looks in the Wardrobe to Find a Fantasy Hit|url=|journal=Fortune|type=Paper|volume=178|issue=5|pages=19|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Entertainment One]], which had acquired production rights to a fourth ''Narnia'' film, also joined the series. [[Mark Gordon]], Douglas Gresham and Vincent Sieber will serve as executive producers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2018/10/netflix-the-chronicles-of-narnia-tv-series-and-films-eone-1202475272|title=Netflix To Develop ‘The Chronicles of Narnia’ TV Series &amp; Films|first=Nellie|last=Andreeva|date=3 October 2018|publisher=|accessdate=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio===
A critically acclaimed [[BBC Radio 4]] dramatisation was produced in the 1980s, starring [[Maurice Denham]] as Professor Kirke. Collectively titled ''Tales of Narnia'', the  programs covered the entire series with a running time of approximately 15 hours.  In Great Britain, BBC Audiobooks release both audio cassette and compact disc versions of the series.

Between 1998 and 2002 Focus on the Family produced radio dramatisations of the entire series through its [[Focus on the Family's Radio Theatre|Radio Theatre]] program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wright|first=Greg|title=Reviews by Greg Wright&amp;nbsp;— Narnia Radio Broadcast|url=http://hollywoodjesus.com/comments/greg/2005/06/narnia-radio-broadcast.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050710013141/http://www.hollywoodjesus.com/comments/greg/2005/06/narnia-radio-broadcast.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=10 July 2005|accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over one hundred performers took part including [[Paul Scofield]] as the storyteller and [[David Suchet]] as Aslan.  Accompanied by an original orchestral score and cinema-quality [[Digital audio|digital sound]] design, the series was hosted by Lewis's stepson Douglas Gresham and ran for just over 22 hours. Recordings of the entire adaptation were released on compact disc between 1999–2003.

===Stage===
Many stage adaptations of ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' have been produced over the years.

In 1984, Vanessa Ford Productions presented ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' at London's Westminster Theatre. Adapted by Glyn Robbins, the play was directed by [[Richard Williams (theatre director)|Richard Williams]] and designed by Marty Flood. The production was later revived at Westminster and The Royalty Theatre and went on tour until 1997. Productions of other tales from ''The Chronicles'' were also staged, including ''The Voyage of the Dawn Treader'' (1986), ''The Magician's Nephew'' (1988) and ''The Horse and His Boy'' (1990).

In 1997, Trumpets Inc., a Filipino Christian theatre and musical production company, produced a musical rendition of "The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe" that Douglas Gresham, Lewis's stepson (and co-producer of the Walden Media film adaptations), has openly declared that he feels is the closest to Lewis's intent. The book and lyrics were written by Jaime del Mundo and Luna Inocian, while the music was composed by Lito Villareal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] premiered ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' in [[Stratford-upon-Avon]] in 1998. The novel was adapted as a musical production by Adrian Mitchell, with music by Shaun Davey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cavendish|first=Dominic|title=Theatre: The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-the-lion-the-witch-and-the-wardrobe-1186280.html|accessdate=31 March 2011|newspaper=The Independent|date=21 November 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was originally directed by Adrian Noble and designed by Anthony Ward, with the revival directed by Lucy Pitman-Wallace. Well received by audiences, the production was periodically re-staged by the RSC for several years afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Melia|first=Liz|title=Engaging fairytale is sure to enchant all|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/coventry/stage/stories/2002/12/lion-the-witch-and-the-wardrobe.shtml|accessdate=31 March 2011|newspaper=BBC|date=9 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Limited engagements were subsequently undertaken at the Barbican Theatre in London and at Sadler's Wells.  This adaptation also toured the United States in the early 2000s.

{{Main article|The Chronicles of Narnia (film series)}}
[[File:2008Narniapremiere.jpg|thumb|The premiere of ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian]]'' in 2008]]

Sceptical that any cinematic adaptation could render the more fantastical elements and characters of the story realistically, Lewis never sold the film rights to the ''Narnia'' series.&lt;ref&gt;A general dislike of cinema can be seen in ''Collected Letters'', Vol. 2, a letter to his brother Warren on 3 March 1940, p. 361; see also ''All My Road Before Me'', 1 June 1926, p. 405&lt;/ref&gt; In answering a letter with a question posed by a child in 1957, asking if the Narnia series could please be on television, C. S. Lewis wrote back: "They'd be no good on TV. Humanized beasts can't be presented to the ''eye'' without at once becoming either hideous or ridiculous. I wish the idiots who run the film world [would] realize that there are stories [which] are for the ''ear'' alone."&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Baird, private collection&lt;/ref&gt; Only after seeing a demo reel of [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] animals did Douglas Gresham, Lewis's stepson and [[literary executor]], and the films' co-producer, give approval for a film adaptation.

The first novel adapted was ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' as ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'' released in December 2005. Produced by [[Walden Media]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Pictures]], the film was directed by [[Andrew Adamson]], with a screenplay by Ann Peacock, Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus. The movie was a critical and box-office success, grossing over $745 million worldwide. Disney and Walden Media then co-produced a sequel ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian]]'', released in May 2008, which grossed over $419 million worldwide.

In December 2008 Disney pulled out of financing the remainder of the ''Chronicles of Narnia'' film series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Sanford|first = James|title = Disney No Longer Under Spell of Narnia|date = 24 December 2008|url = http://blog.mlive.com/james_sanford/2008/12/disney_is_no_longer_under_the.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Disney opts out of 3rd 'Narnia' film|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/orlando/stories/2008/12/29/daily3.html|accessdate=27 March 2011|newspaper=Orlando Business Journal|date=29 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Already in pre-production at the time, [[20th Century Fox]] and Walden Media eventually co-produced ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader]]'', which was released in December 2010 going on to gross over $415 million worldwide.

'''Wongaksa Pagoda''' is a twelve metre high ten storey marble pagoda in the center of [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]]. It was constructed in 1467 to form part of [[Wongaksa temple]], that King [[Sejo]] had founded two years before on the site of an older [[Goryeo]]-period temple, Heungbok-sa. The temple was closed and turned into a [[kisaeng]] house by the (later deposed) king known as [[Yeonsan-gun]] (1476 – 1506, r. 1494-1506), and under his successor, King [[Jungjong]] (1488 – 1544, r.1506–1544) the site was turned into government offices. The pagoda and a memorial stele commemorating the foundation of Wongaksa alone survived. The site of the temple was later occupied by houses. During the [[Imjin War]] of the 1590s, the top portion of the pagoda was pulled down and lay on the ground at the foot of the pagoda until it was replaced by American military engineers in 1947.

Foreign visitors to Seoul in the late 19th century often went to admire the beautiful pagoda but it was almost inaccessible, hidden in the courtyard of a small house, and in 1897 [[John McLeavy Brown]], the Irish financial advisor to King Gojong, was authorized by the king to turn the area into Seoul's first public park. He called it Pagoda Park, the name it had at the time of the 1919 [[March 1st Movement]]. Today the park is known as [[Tapgol Park|Tapgol (Pagoda) Park]] ([[:ko:탑골 공원|탑골 공원]]) and the pagoda stands in a protective glass case. The [[Korean language|Korean name]] literally means "ten storeyed stone pagoda of Wongaksa Temple site." 

The pagoda is considered by art historians to be one of the finest examples of [[Joseon dynasty]] pagoda art.  The pagoda was designated as the second [[national treasures of Korea|national treasure of Korea]] on December 12, 1962. From an inscription on the upper part of the pagoda it is known that the pagoda was built in 1467, the thirteenth year of [[Sejo of Joseon|King Sejo]]'s reign.

It is one of the few pagodas made from marble in Korea. Typical Korean pagodas are made from granite, a material abundant on the peninsula. The pedestal supporting the pagoda is three-tiered, and its shape seen from the top looks like a Chinese character, 亞. The first three storeys of the pagoda follow the shape of the base and the next seven storeys are shaped in form of squares. Dragons, lions, [[lotus flower]]s, [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]]es, [[Buddhahood|Buddhas]], [[Bodhisattva]]s, and the [[Four Heavenly Kings]] carved on each storey of the pagoda. The pagoda, while made of stone, is carved to look as if it was made from wood. The pagoda has brackets, pillars, and curved roof shapes that imitate a wooden pagoda design.

The pagoda was clearly modelled on the beautiful [[Gyeongcheonsa Pagoda]], which was made during the [[Goryeo]] Era. Originally erected in 1348 at Gyeongcheon-sa temple on Mt. Busosan in Gwangdeok-myeon, Gaepung-gun, Gyeonggi-do (near Gaesong, now in North Korea), it was taken to Japan in 1907, returned to Korea in 1918, and is now housed at the [[National Museum of Korea]].

The first detailed description of the pagoda in English, together with a translation of the inscription on the stele, was published in 1915 by the scholarly missionary [[James Scarth Gale]] in the [[Royal Asiatic Society Korea Branch]]'s ''Transactions'' Vol. VI, part II:1-22   “The Pagoda of Seoul.”
